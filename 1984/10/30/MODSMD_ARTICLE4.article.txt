# Voters eye risks, rewards of lottery

This week The Daily looks at five of the
key constitutional amendments on the Cal
ifornia ballot in next week's general elec
tion. Today: state lottery. Tomorrow:
English-only ballot.

Some California voters are gambling on
their favorite candidates in next week's
elections, and if Proposition 37 becomes
law they'll keep gambling long after the
polls close.
Strictly speaking, Proposition 37
prohibits gambling casinos like the ones in
Nevada and New Jersey. But if approved,
it would amend the state constitution to
make California the eighteenth state to
adopt a government-sponsored lottery

system.
Revenue from the lottery, according to
a publication from the League of Women
Voters, would be distributed in three di
rections, including a 50 percent return to
lottery participants and no more than 16
percent to cover expenses. The remaining
34 percent, estimated at $500 million an
nually after two years of operation, would
be used for public education in the state.
According to Article One of the
amendment known formally as "The Cali
fornia State Lottery Act of 1984," the
purpose of the lottery is "support for
preservation of the rights, liberties and
welfare of the people by providing addi
tional monies to benefit education with
out the imposition of additional or in
creased taxes."

Many California legislators, including
Governor George Deukmejian, are
against the proposition because they feel
it would increase crime. On the other side
of the aisle are those who see the proposi
tion as an optimal way of generating reve
nue for schools without a formal raise in
taxes.
Karen Van Buskirk, a member of
Californians for Better Education, an or
ganization backing Proposition 37, dis
agrees with the notion that the lotteries
trigger an increase in crime. "Seventeen
states show that's not the case," she said.
Van Buskirk said there has "never been
an incident of organized crime involve
ment," in the twenty years since New
Hampshire became the first state to adopt
a lottery.

In fact, Van Buskirk said, there is actu
ally "a decrease in illegal numbers games"
in states that adopt lotteries.
Van Buskirk and others point out there
are tight controls in the text of the pro
posed law to guard against crime. She
noted the establishment of a California
State Lottery Commission and the sweep
ing powers that group of five members
will have to watch over lottery operations.
According to the League of Women
Voters, that commission would be
"required to make quarterly reports on
the performance of the lottery. The direc
tor would be required to arrange for
studies on how the lottery could be
operated most effectively, who par-
