Teaching in the rain
After escaping a History Corner fire drill, English Prof. Bill Chace continues his James Joyce class
despite the rain. Other students were not so lucky. Students in Prof. Gregory Clark's economics class
were taking a midterm when the alarm went off. The tests were collected, but it was not determined
whether or not they would be graded.
