EPA says Superfund dump leaking
WASHINGTON — A massive hazardous-waste landfill in Niagara
Falls, N.Y., that received thousands of tons of material from Superfund
cleanups is leaking and "could endanger the health of the public living
downstream," according to an internal Environmental Protection
Agency report.
The landfill, a Cecos International facility, was constructed according
to the most modern technology for hazardous-waste disposal, with spe
cially designed liners and a collection system that is supposed to catch
leaks before contamination occurs.
The facility's two newest units have been open less than three years
and have accepted waste from at least seven Superfund toxic waste
cleanup sites.
The site has been formally under investigation for several months as a
result of tests that showed high levels of contamination in ground water.
Cecos and regional EPA officials, however, have attributed the results to
"irregularities" in testing procedures.
But the new report, prepared by an investigator from the agency's
Washington office, found "substantial circumstantial evidence" that the
two newest units are leaking "and probably were leaking at the time Su
perfund wastes were deposited in them."
According to the report, chemical contaminants from the site, includ
ing chloroform, vinyl chloride and industrial solvents, appear headed for
a residential area less than one-fourth of a mile away.
Reagan downplays lead in polls
LANCASTER, Pa. — Cautioning against overconfidence. President
Reagan urged his supporters yesterday to "stop reading the polls" and
vote next Tuesday in large numbers not only for him but also for Repub
lican congressional candidates.
Before several thousand cheering Millersville University students,
Reagan assailed Democratic presidential contender Walter Mondale's
tax increase proposal, saying, "We're hoping the voters will deliver a
message next week. You can say that you're simply not going to allow
[Democrats] to pick the American wallet again "
Ironically, with all major public opinion polls showing Reagan holding
a wide lead over Mondale, both candidates were disavowing the surveys
— Mondale because they were too discouraging to his supporters, and
Reagan because he feared they could lull his potential voters into com
placency.
"We're coming down to the wire. And, I tell you, stop reading the
polls," Reagan told the students, packed into a gymnasium here in the
heart of Amish farming country. "Don't let anything keep you on Nov. 6
from getting out there and doing what we must do — and seeing that
your neighbors get out there and get to the polls."
Mondale turns to rights issues
SEATTLE — With his strategists banking on a major break, Demo
cratic presidential candidate Walter Mondale yesterday continued cam
paigning on his personal political creed, this time as a champion of
human rights abroad.
At a warmly enthusiastic rally on the chilly downtown streets of this
city and earlier at a crowded college gymnasium in overcast Portland,
Ore., Mondale drew a portrait of the Reagan administration as one that
had "dumped human rights as a foreign-policy priority."
Mondale's lengthy litany of charges against President Reagan in
cluded arms sales to "dictatorships" in Guatemala and Haiti, sending
top diplomats to Chile to "clink glasses with the thugs that run that
country" and making the United States the sole dissenter from a recent
U.N. Security Council resolution condemning mass arrests in South
Africa.
In New York, vice-presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro yesterday
demanded an apology from President Reagan for what she said was his
"disgraceful falsehood" in asserting that the Democratic Party lacked
the moral courage to denounce anti-Semitism.
"I will riot accept the base implication that my party is soft on anti-
Semitism," Ferraro told about 1,000 people at Temple Kehilath Jesh
run, referring to Reagan's comments at a Long Island, N.Y. synagogue
last week.
"In an effort to impress his audience, President Reagan insulted it. In
an effort to assail us, he debased himself. The president's remark was in
correct, indecent and he should apologize for making it," she said.
Canadian autoworkers end strike
TORONTO — Autoworkers at General Motors Corp.'s 13 Canadian
plants ratified a new labor contract yesterday, ending a strike that forced
more than 40,000 layoffs in the United States.
Meanwhile, the United Auto Workers announced that its members
had approved a new three-year contract with Ford Motor Co. in the
United States by a vote of 33,312 to 18.386, or 64 percent to 36 percent.
The Canadian GM workers voted in favor of the pact by more than 86
percent, the union said. Vote totals were to be announced later.
The contract covers 36,000 GM workers in Canada.
Robert White, the Canadian director of the UAW, told a news confer
ence that the striking workers were "relieved and glad to be going back
to work."
White said the principle of distinct contract provisions for Canadian
and U.S. autoworkers had been established.
"The days of rubber-stamping a U.S. agreement are now gone,"
White said.
Maintenance workers at some plants were being called in last night,
with full production expected to resume today or tomorrow, union offi
cials said.
Chile arrests 150 demonstrators
SANTIAGO, Chile — Chile's military government confined at least
150 opponents yesterday at a desert camp for political prisoners after a
wave of arrests against alleged agitators for a national strike.
Opposition leaders supporting the strike said that more than 300
people had been arrested since Saturday night. Small groups of
demonstrators in the center of this capital were arrested by national
police when they tried to march in the streets yesterday at noontime.
The Ministry of Interior said that 135 people have been sent to the
Pisagua detention center in northern Chile. They were described as
"delinquents" who had been arrested for "rehabilitation." Another 15
names were on a list to be made public soon.
The general strike called for today is the latest in a succession of
protest movements that began in Chile last year, calling for the resigna
tion of President Augusto Pinochet, who has been in power for 11 years.
The strike call came from the leftist National Workers Command and
a political front called the Democratic Popular Movement. Both groups
are run by the outlawed Communist Party.
The strike call has been weakened by the refusal of strong union
groups, who refuse to cooperate with the Communists, to take part. This
includes unions that are closely linked to the Christian Democratic
Party. This party is also in opposition to Pinochet, but it opposes the use
of violence, which the Communists and the far left Revolutionary Left
Movement have increasingly turned to in their struggle to overthrow the
government.
U.N. cites 'disaster' in Africa
GENEVA, Switzerland — More than 35 million people living in all
parts of drought-ravaged Africa are desperately hungry, and their plight
is the "worst human disaster in the recent history" of the continent, a
United Nations report said yesterday.
Around the world, more appeals and promises of aid were made for
Ethiopia, where an estimated 6 million to 7 million people are in danger
of starving. But the International Red Cross warned that "similar horror
pictures" are possible in other parts of Africa.
Stocks down in light trading
NEW YORK — Stock prices sagged yesterday in the slowest trading
in three weeks, continuing their recent retreat.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which spent the session
hovering just above the 1,200 level, closed at 1,201.41, down 3.54 from
Friday's close. Last week the average dropped 20.98 points.

Mondale turns to rights issues
SEATTLE — With his strategists banking on a major break, Demo
cratic presidential candidate Walter Mondale yesterday continued cam
paigning on his personal political creed, this time as a champion of
human rights abroad.
At a warmly enthusiastic rally on the chilly downtown streets of this
city and earlier at a crowded college gymnasium in overcast Portland,
Ore., Mondale drew a portrait of the Reagan administration as one that
had "dumped human rights as a foreign-policy priority."
Mondale's lengthy litany of charges against President Reagan in
cluded arms sales to "dictatorships" in Guatemala and Haiti, sending
top diplomats to Chile to "clink glasses with the thugs that run that
country" and making the United States the sole dissenter from a recent
U.N. Security Council resolution condemning mass arrests in South
Africa.
In New York, vice-presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro yesterday
demanded an apology from President Reagan for what she said was his
"disgraceful falsehood" in asserting that the Democratic Party lacked
the moral courage to denounce anti-Semitism.
"I will riot accept the base implication that my party is soft on anti-
Semitism," Ferraro told about 1,000 people at Temple Kehilath Jesh
run, referring to Reagan's comments at a Long Island, N.Y. synagogue
last week.
"In an effort to impress his audience, President Reagan insulted it. In
an effort to assail us, he debased himself. The president's remark was in
correct, indecent and he should apologize for making it," she said.
Canadian autoworkers end strike
TORONTO — Autoworkers at General Motors Corp.'s 13 Canadian
plants ratified a new labor contract yesterday, ending a strike that forced
more than 40,000 layoffs in the United States.
Meanwhile, the United Auto Workers announced that its members
had approved a new three-year contract with Ford Motor Co. in the
United States by a vote of 33,312 to 18.386, or 64 percent to 36 percent.
The Canadian GM workers voted in favor of the pact by more than 86
percent, the union said. Vote totals were to be announced later.
The contract covers 36,000 GM workers in Canada.
Robert White, the Canadian director of the UAW, told a news confer
ence that the striking workers were "relieved and glad to be going back
to work."
White said the principle of distinct contract provisions for Canadian
and U.S. autoworkers had been established.
"The days of rubber-stamping a U.S. agreement are now gone,"
White said.
Maintenance workers at some plants were being called in last night,
with full production expected to resume today or tomorrow, union offi
cials said.
Chile arrests 150 demonstrators
SANTIAGO, Chile — Chile's military government confined at least
150 opponents yesterday at a desert camp for political prisoners after a
wave of arrests against alleged agitators for a national strike.
Opposition leaders supporting the strike said that more than 300
people had been arrested since Saturday night. Small groups of
demonstrators in the center of this capital were arrested by national
police when they tried to march in the streets yesterday at noontime.
The Ministry of Interior said that 135 people have been sent to the
Pisagua detention center in northern Chile. They were described as
"delinquents" who had been arrested for "rehabilitation." Another 15
names were on a list to be made public soon.
The general strike called for today is the latest in a succession of
protest movements that began in Chile last year, calling for the resigna
tion of President Augusto Pinochet, who has been in power for 11 years.
The strike call came from the leftist National Workers Command and
a political front called the Democratic Popular Movement. Both groups
are run by the outlawed Communist Party.
The strike call has been weakened by the refusal of strong union
groups, who refuse to cooperate with the Communists, to take part. This
includes unions that are closely linked to the Christian Democratic
Party. This party is also in opposition to Pinochet, but it opposes the use
of violence, which the Communists and the far left Revolutionary Left
Movement have increasingly turned to in their struggle to overthrow the
government.
U.N. cites 'disaster' in Africa
GENEVA, Switzerland — More than 35 million people living in all
parts of drought-ravaged Africa are desperately hungry, and their plight
is the "worst human disaster in the recent history" of the continent, a
United Nations report said yesterday.
Around the world, more appeals and promises of aid were made for
Ethiopia, where an estimated 6 million to 7 million people are in danger
of starving. But the International Red Cross warned that "similar horror
pictures" are possible in other parts of Africa.
Stocks down in light trading
NEW YORK — Stock prices sagged yesterday in the slowest trading
in three weeks, continuing their recent retreat.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which spent the session
hovering just above the 1,200 level, closed at 1,201.41, down 3.54 from
Friday's close. Last week the average dropped 20.98 points.

EPA says Superfund dump leaking
WASHINGTON — A massive hazardous-waste landfill in Niagara
Falls, N.Y., that received thousands of tons of material from Superfund
cleanups is leaking and "could endanger the health of the public living
downstream," according to an internal Environmental Protection
Agency report.
The landfill, a Cecos International facility, was constructed according
to the most modern technology for hazardous-waste disposal, with spe
cially designed liners and a collection system that is supposed to catch
leaks before contamination occurs.
The facility's two newest units have been open less than three years
and have accepted waste from at least seven Superfund toxic waste
cleanup sites.
The site has been formally under investigation for several months as a
result of tests that showed high levels of contamination in ground water.
Cecos and regional EPA officials, however, have attributed the results to
"irregularities" in testing procedures.
But the new report, prepared by an investigator from the agency's
Washington office, found "substantial circumstantial evidence" that the
two newest units are leaking "and probably were leaking at the time Su
perfund wastes were deposited in them."
According to the report, chemical contaminants from the site, includ
ing chloroform, vinyl chloride and industrial solvents, appear headed for
a residential area less than one-fourth of a mile away.
Reagan downplays lead in polls
LANCASTER, Pa. — Cautioning against overconfidence. President
Reagan urged his supporters yesterday to "stop reading the polls" and
vote next Tuesday in large numbers not only for him but also for Repub
lican congressional candidates.
Before several thousand cheering Millersville University students,
Reagan assailed Democratic presidential contender Walter Mondale's
tax increase proposal, saying, "We're hoping the voters will deliver a
message next week. You can say that you're simply not going to allow
[Democrats] to pick the American wallet again "
Ironically, with all major public opinion polls showing Reagan holding
a wide lead over Mondale, both candidates were disavowing the surveys
— Mondale because they were too discouraging to his supporters, and
Reagan because he feared they could lull his potential voters into com
placency.
"We're coming down to the wire. And, I tell you, stop reading the
polls," Reagan told the students, packed into a gymnasium here in the
heart of Amish farming country. "Don't let anything keep you on Nov. 6
from getting out there and doing what we must do — and seeing that
your neighbors get out there and get to the polls."
