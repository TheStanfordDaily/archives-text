## OPEC to cut oil production 
### 
GENEVA, Switzerland — The Or
ganization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries agreed yesterday to cut oil
production immediately by 1.5 mil
lion barrels a day in an effort to stop
world oil prices from dropping.
"A consensus has been reached,"
Soebroto, the Indonesian oil minister,
announced late in the day. "We will
suppress production from 17.5 mil
lion barrels to 16 million barrels,
which we believe will be sufficient to
stabilize the market. We could have
cut production more, but we do not
want to overdo it. We expect the cuts
to last a couple of months."
Soebroto is acting as chairman of
the OPEC emergency conference
here.
The delegates went into a night
meeting to work out new production
quotas. Saudi Arabia was expected to
take the brunt of the cut, but the size
of the Saudi reduction will depend on
what other countries are prepared to
do.
Libya and Venezuela were said to

be ready to cut back production by
100,000 barrels a day; Kuwait by
100,000 to 150,000, and Algeria per
haps by 50,000 barrels. According to
Soebroto, Egypt and Mexico, which
are not among the 13 members of
OPEC, have committed themselves
to sharing in the cutback.
Asked whether Nigeria would go
along, Soebroto said, "Nigeria was in
the room and there was a consensus
agreement."
A decision by Nigeria to drop its
price to $2 below the OPEC bench
mark price of $29 a barrel — after
price cuts two weeks ago by the non-
OPEC countries Norway and Britain
— triggered the emergency meeting
here.
Going into the meeting, the
Nigerian oil minister, Tam Sokari
David-West, said his government
would not increase its production but
also said it would not rescind its price
cut until the price of oil on the spot
market is back in line with the OPEC
base price.

The 1.5 million-barrel reduction is
expected to be in effect by the end ot
this week.
There are differing opinions among
oil market analysts as to how deep the
production cut should be and how
long it will take to turn the market
around. The consensus seems to be
that it can probably be done by the
end of the year if all the OPEC mem
bers adhere to the reduced quotas.
The OPEC ministers are scheduled
to meet here Dec. 19-20 for their reg
ular semiannual meeting, and they
clearly hope that by that time the spot
market price will have moved back up
into line with the OPEC fixed price,
and that production can be raised
again.
The Saudi Arabian oil minister,
Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani, said he
has been assured by the Norwegians
that they will rescind their cut of
$1.35 a barrel for North Sea crude
once the spot market price goes back
up. In any case, the Norwegians had
contracts at the reduced price only

through November.
Once the new quotas are agreed to,
the ministers will move today to what
may prove to be the real problem of
this meeting — price differentials.
The members have agreed to defend
the OPEC base price of $29 a barrel
for Saudi light crude, against which
all types of oils are differentiated. But
in the past two years, oil refineries
have been upgraded to use heavier
and cheaper crudes, and, as a result,
light crudes are now overpriced.
Some producers of light crudes are
insisting that the price of heavier oils
must be raised in order to restore an
orderly market pattern. They are ex
pected to insist on a new price
structure as part of the agreement to
cut back production.
But the overriding interest of all
OPEC members seems to be to get
back on top of current market forces
and keep prices from falling further.
