# Alternative to transplant cited
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES — California doctors
proceeded with an extraordinary baboon-to-baby
heart transplant after indicating they had no
suitable alternative to save the child from certain
death despite success by Philadelphia and Boston
surgeons in treating more than 50 infants with
similar heart defects.
Dr. Leonard Bailey, the head of a surgical team
that performed the operation, could not be reached
for comment yesterday on the reason a transplant
was selected over other surgery.
"He is primarily concerned with the infant right
now," a spokesman for Loma Linda University
said.
A press release distributed after the Friday
morning transplant of a baboon's heart into a 14-
day-old baby at the university medical center men
tioned the work of Dr. William Norwood in
Philadelphia. But the release said he had "limited
success" correcting such defects and "other experi
enced infant-heart surgeons have been unable to
reproduce [his] results."
In a telephone interview from Philadelphia
Children's Hospital yesterday, Norwood said not
only he but doctors at Boston Children's hospital
had succeeded in helping children suffering from
hypoplastic left heart syndrome, the condition that
led to the baboon-heart transplant for "Baby Fae"
in Loma Linda.
He said about 40 of the 100 patients he has
treated with a special two-step surgical procedure
have survived. The oldest is now 4 years old, he
said, and expected to lead a normal life, barring
major exertions like running a marathon. Dr. Aldo
Castaneda of Boston Children's Hospital said
about 15 of his 30 most recent patients have

survived.
Some experts on medical ethics have protested
the use of an infant for an experimental procedure,
and animal-rights advocates have attacked the kil
ling of a 7-month-old baboon for the operation.
But Loma Linda University officials said the
child would have died soon without the procedure
and a university ethics committee approved the op
eration as long as it had a chance of saving the in
fant. The day after the operation, a hospital
spokeswoman described the condition with which
the baby was born as "100 percent fatal."
A spokesman for the medical center, at the
Seventh-day Adventist university 60 miles east of
Los Angeles where the transplant occurred, said
yesterday that Baby Fae, the name used to protect
her identity, remained in stable condition, with the
transplanted heart performing normally. The in
fant, although awake and apparently healthy, is
listed in serious condition — after being taken off
the critical list last night — as part of normal proce
dure for post-operative heart patients, a hospital
spokesman said.
Four previous human recipients of ape hearts in
Mississippi, South Africa and Britain have survived
no longer than a few days. Bailey, the head of the
Loma Linda surgical team, said Sunday he once
kept a goat alive with a lamb's heart for 165 days.
He said he has performed nearly 150 heart
transplants between animals in the last seven years
and has reason to believe humans and apes may be
more compatible than sheep and goats.
Given the possibility of fatal rejection of a
transplant and possible harmful side effects from
drugs to suppress rejection, Norwood, 43, chief of
cardiac surgery at the hospital, said, "If I had my

druthers I would rather use other options short of
transplants."
Castaneda, 54, chief of cardiac surgery at the
Boston hospital and a former research partner of
Norwood, said, "At least people ought to know
that it is an alternative."
A spokeswoman for the Loma Linda University
Medical Center said she did not know if Baby Fae's
parents were advised of the Philadelphia or Boston
successes or why the university press release erred
in reporting the Norwood procedure.
At a news conference Sunday, Bailey cited a July
1983 report on Norwood's work that he said indi
cated only two of 35 patients had survived the pro
cedure.
Norwood said he could not say whether the
"Baby Fae" transplant was right or wrong without
knowing the circumstances at the time of the oper
ation. Asked if he could have helped the infant if
her parents had called him before the transplant,
Norwood said "Yes."
Norwood said he is now seeing 30 to 50 babies a
year with hydroplastic left heart syndrome, a con
genital defect in which most of the left side of the
heart is missing, and some of them have been
brought from other parts of the country.
Under the procedure, the circulation through the
newborn heart is redirected to the route used by a
fetal heart so that blood can be pumped into the
body through the right rather than the missing left
side. The child is sent home and after its lungs have
developed sufficiently in two or three years, its cir
culation is rerouted again to allow blood returning
to the heart to go directly to the lungs for a new
supply of oxygen.
