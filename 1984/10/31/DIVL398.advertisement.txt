STRESS
MANAGEMENT.
So, not one of the problems in the entire
problem set works, you can t find the bug in
your program, and tomorrow s paper is thus
far three sentences long Quit
hyperventilating and stop by The Store for
some munchies, cold drinks, and maybe a
magazine or two, And something you could
use right now â€” a friendly atmosphere.
Clear your mind, fill your stomach, and avoid
high blood pressure. You'll make it.
