NEW DELHI, India — Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi was assassinated today, reportedly by two
members of her own security guard who shot her at
least eight times outside her home.
Sikh extremists claimed responsibility for the attack.
The 66-year-old prime minister was rushed to the
All-India Institute of Medical Sciences, the country's
most prestigious hospital, immediately after the shoot
ing. The United News of India quoted doctors as
saying she died less than two hours later.
She reportedly was shot in the heart, abdomen and
thigh.
A spokesman in the prime minister's office said that
all armed forces have been put on a security alert and
all military personnel on leave were ordered to report
to duty.
Her son, Rajiv Gandhi, who is general-secretary of
the governing Congress Party, rushed back to New
Delhi after hearing the news that she was shot. He was
addressing a public meeting in the western state of
West Bengal.
In Washington, White House spokesman Anson
Franklin said President Reagan has been notified of
Gandhi's death and "expressed deep personal sor
row."
Several hours after the shooting, which occurred at
9:20 a.m. (7:40 p.m. Tuesday, California time), an uni
dentified caller told The Associated Press: "We have
taken our revenge. Long live the Sikh religion."
Asked who he was and what organization he was
from, the man said: "This is the action of the entire
Sikh sect." Then the caller hung up.
Gandhi was highly criticized by leaders of India's
Sikh minority for her government's handling of recent
violence in Punjab, a northern Indian state. Indian
army troops in June besieged and then assaulted the
Golden Temple, the Sikhs' holiest place of worship, in
Amritsar.
The Gandhi government said the siege was neces
sary to root out Sikh extremists who were waging a ter
rorist campaign to gain more control for the Sikhs, a
breakaway Hindu sect.
The government said about 492 Sikhs and 93 army
soldiers were killed in the assault; military and police
sources put the death toll at about 1,000 Sikhs and 220
soldiers.
There were reports that at least one and possibly all
of the men said to be involved in the attack today were
Sikhs.
An assistant Cabinet secretary told The Associated
Press by telephone that the Cabinet was meeting today
in emergency session.
The United News of India said the prime minister
was shot at by two members of her own security detail
and that the two were killed on the spot by other secur
ity guards. Without elaborating, the agency also said an

officer of the security police was injured and
"overpowered."
UNI said Gandhi came out of her house this morn
ing to make a video recording when "suddenly, out of
the blue, two persons carrying Sten guns — one uni
formed and one in civilian clothes — shot at Mrs.
Gandhi.
"Eight to 10 bullets from the gun hit her. The two
persons, stated to be on security duty at the prime min
isters' residence, were instantly shot dead."
Gandhi fell down with a cry, UNI said, and members
of the household and other security personnel rushed
to the spot. She was immediately taken to the hospital.
The prime minister, who had returned to New Delhi
late yesterday from a two-day election campaign tour
in eastern Orissa state, had been under heavy security
in recent weeks because of assassination threats,
reportedly from Sikh extremists.
Gandhi's assassination was the latest incident in a
stormy political career which at times has mirrored the
turbulence of Indian politics.
The daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first
prime minister, Gandhi was born Nov. 19, 1917.
A Los Angeles Sikh leader said last night the assas
sination was "God's act and justice."
Dr. Amrit Singh, president of the Southern Califor
nia chapter of the World Sikh Organization, who has
led several local demonstrations against alleged per
secution of Sikhs in India, called Gandhi "India's Hit
ler."
Singh, a cardiologist, made the statements after at
tending a service at the Sikh Temple Los Angeles.
During the service, he said, a congregation of about 70
prayed for her death. (The service preceded news of
her death.)
The physician added, "We are so proud that she has
been killed in her own house under the protection of
Russian security." He then claimed that her personal
security was provided by Soviet Russia.
