## Latin America experts clash 
### R. TAEZA PIERCE Staff writer 
The upcoming Nicaraguan
presidential elections "will be uni
versally condemned" because
"they're going to be a farce," a
State Department official said here
last night.
Robert Driscoll, special assistant
to the chairman of Policy and Plan
ning, defended the administra
tion's position in Central America,
saying the "bloodbath" there
would have been much worse"
had the U.S. not provided a direct
military presence.
Driscoll was joined by Raymond
Bonner, a New York Times corre
spondent in Latin America from
1981-83, and Nora Hamilton, as
sistant history professor at the Uni
versity ot Southern California, in a
Kresge auditorium panel discus
sion that attracted about 300.
Bonner said the Nicaraguan
elections "are not going to be dem
ocratic as we know them here," but
stressed, "that doesn't mean we
have the right to go in and over
throw that government." He
disputed the claim that the current
U.S. policy is the most appropriate
strategy to addressing the unrest in
Central America.

"We have to look beyond just El
Salvador" and consider the whole
region "to analyze U.S. policy and
see if we make a difference," Bon
ner said. "More could be done. . ..
The U.S. could do one hell of a lot
more to bring it (violence) to an
end."
Driscoll, who was a political
counselor to the embassy in El Sal
vador from 1981-83, defined the
current situation in El Salvador as
"a military problem in the sense
that the issue is being decided by
force of arms."
Bonner said the same reasoning
should be applied to U.S. policy in
Nicaragua. "Deciding with arms
is precisely what we are doing in
Nicaragua," he said. "You have to
compare it (Nicaragua) to El Sal
vador and ask if the policy is justi
fied."
Bonner asked the largely student
audience to compare "the war we
are waging against the Sandinista
government" to the U.S. "policy to
prop up the Salvadoran
[government] with a billion dollars
in aid."
The United States spent $2 mil
lion to defeat Salvadoran Presiden
tial Candidate Alberto
D'Aubuisson in 1984, Bonner

said. "I don't call it democracy
when the U.S. interferes to that ex
tent."
He said that in Nicaragua there
is more freedom of the press, a bet
ter life for peasants and fewer
human rights violations than in El
Salvador. According to State De
partment statistics, the Sandinistas
were responsible for 12 deaths in
1983. During that same year, Bon
ner said the Salvadoran govern
ment was responsible for 140
deaths per month.
Bonner stressed he was "not
defending the anti-democratic
policies of the Sandinistas." But
later said, "You can defend the
Nicaraguan Revolution if you want
to. I think there's a lot to defend."
He cited improvements in the
health and education of
Nicaraguan citizens, but cautioned,
"Don't try to defend it on grounds
that it's a liberal, democratic
[movement]. American liberals
will be the first to bail out," of the
conflict in Nicaragua because "it
does not meet their needs," he
said.
Hamilton criticized what she
called a "mental isolation", or ig-
