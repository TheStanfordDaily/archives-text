# Students come to grips with bully/sissy complex
## 
### FRANK LESTER Staff writer 
The lifelong tension between men's
aggressive and passive extremes —
between being "bullies" and "sissies"
— causes violent attitudes toward
women that can erupt in the form of
rape, two counselors told a small
Florence Moore Hall audience last
night.
Only seven people — three of them
women, four of them not from Stan
ford — attended a workshop on the
"bully/sissy" complex that seems to
follow men through their lives, build
ing up a reservoir of ambiguities
about their "humanity" that may lead
to violence against women.
Chris Anderegg, from the Contra
Costa Rape Crisis Center, and Allan
Creighton, from Men Overcoming
Violence, directed an hour-long com
bination of role-playing and confes
sions during which the audience
recalled childhood situations when
they had acted as "bullies" or
"sissies" and tried to come to conclu
sions about what motivated their ac
tions.
The hour began with Anderegg and
Creighton playing the roles of

elementary school boys on a play
ground. The role playing illustrated
the beginnings of the bully/sissy com
plex: Anderegg, the bully, shoved
Creighton, the sissy, around, asking
him what he had been doing with an
imagined girl on the other side of the
playground.
The counselors used the play
ground experience as a metaphor for
the continuous cycle of oscillation be
tween aggression and passivity that
men go through all their lives. "Most
of us exist in a gray area between
being the sissy and the bully," An
deregg said.
The gray area men live in often
masks negative sexual experiences
they had as children, the counselors
said. Anderegg said that at a junior
high school he had surveyed, one out
of six boys mentioned having been
sexually assaulted. "I think the truer
figure is one in one, though," An
deregg said, explaining that he hadn't
met a single man in his counseling ex
perience who hadn't undergone a
sexual assault of one sort or another.
The counselors said that suppres
sion of these negative childhood
sexual experiences — the

"profoundness of having to shut up
about it," as Anderegg termed it —
shapes the way boys act as men, both
toward other men and toward wo
men. Shutting up, according to the
counselors, forces men to assume
what they think is a masculine role in
an effort to cover up experiences that
may have made them feel less than
"masculine."
The end result is that men try to
avoid becoming the people and things
that are the frequent objects of soci
ety's sexual scorn: "faggots,"
"pussies," "girls," — in short, sissies.
This attempt at avoidance also
results in endowing men with a hatred
of women and women's bodily parts
and homosexuals, all of which society
deems unmasculine, the counselors
said. They called this the genesis of
unhealthy attitudes which lead to
rape. "I would rather be a bully than
a sissy, given a choice," Anderegg
said.
The counselors broke the audience
into pairs to play the roles of "bully"
and "sissy." Each audience member
related to his partner an experience
he had of each role when younger.
