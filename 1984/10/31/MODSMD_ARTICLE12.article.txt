## The 						Stanford Daily Reach out and help 
### 
Not long ago. Ruby Lee Scott, a 71-year-old
East Palo Alto woman, broke her arm and suf
fered a stroke. Her home began to fall into dis
repair: "I couldn't do anything," she said. "I
neeeded help."
On Saturday, Ruby Lee Scott got the help she
needed. A small army of Stanford students
invaded her yard, removed the garbage and
brambles and cleaned her house.
"Nobody here would believe Stanford students
would do this," said one organizer. But Stanford
students — members of the yuppie class, inter
ested only in high grades and high tech — rolled
up their collective sleeves and helped out some
one who needed them.
Ruby Lee Scott wasn't the only person to
benefit from Stanford students Saturday. Patients
at the Veterans Administration Hospital enjoyed
a Halloween party hosted by students, and Penin
sulans who use Stevenson House and the Com
munity Association for the Retarded will appre
ciate for months to come the painting and
renovating work Stanford students did Saturday.
This outpouring of good will was all part of
Reach Out Today, the first major project by the
Stanford Volunteer Network. In all, some 350 to
400 Stanford students chipped in to help out Sat
urday, a day when most of us were safe in our
rooms, studying for midterms.
Reach Out Today was also one of the first
visible effects of University President Donald

Kennedy's emphasis on public service. During
the past months, Kennedy has repeatedly trum
peted the values of helping others. And Kennedy
is right: Public service is an admirable goal. Sat
urday's Reach Out Today proved that Stanford
students are willing to take to heart Kennedy's
urgings.
Stanford Volunteer Network Director Peter
Spivack said more Reach Out Today programs
are likely, and that's good news. Those students
who volunteered this time can prove that theirs is
more than a one-time commitment to helping.
And those who missed Saturday's effort will have
another chance to try their hands at lending a
hand.
Spivack said the volunteer network "should
make students realize that there are other things
out there besides money, status and careers. It
will give them a chance to see how other people
live and the factors they face."
And it will give all of us a chance to experience
life on the other side of El Camino Real, where
the real world begins and where we can offer
others some of the Utopia that is Stanford life.
Time will tell whether optimism for the Reach
Out Today concept is warranted, and a one-time,
one-day commitment is a long way from the
lifelong commitment to public service that Ken
nedy has been pushing. But it's a start. And a
good one at that.
