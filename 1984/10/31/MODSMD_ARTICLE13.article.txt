## Full divestiture not feasible 
### 
The ASSU referendum on Stan
ford investments in South Africa and
the recent letter (The Daily, Oct. 19)
by Rachel Samoff advocate the for
mulation of an investment policy that
will aid, it is hoped, in the eventual
elimination of apartheid practices in
s»outh Africa. The ultimate end these
authors are seeking is laudable. It is
worthwhile, however, to consider
carefully the means used to achieve

VIEWPOINT

this end. Some of the means that
hrave been proposed (e.g., total
divestiture) seem not to include the
crucial processes of fact finding and
value balancing in their race for the
laudable end.
: The ASSU referendum requests
tjlat Stanford "formulate a respon
sible investment policy which in
cludes as criteria for selective
divestment insufficient compliance
with the Sullivan Principles and the
sale of equipment directly
strengthening the apartheid system to
Sfcuth Africa." (The resolution also
specifically requests divestiture of
hpldings in the Motorola Corpora
tion.) Samoff believes that "total
divestment should be the goal," and
advocates a "yes" vote on the ASSU
referendum as a first step.
'Stanford already has a responsible
investment policy. It was formulated
iij 1977 to deal with precisely the set
of issues now facing us. (See the
"Statement on Investment Responsi
bility Concerning Endowment Secur
ities," Dec. 27, 1977.) The policy
provides for:
T(1) Voting of proxies in the interest
of social responsibility;
T(2) Divestiture, where the trustees
conclude that a company's activities
c&use substantial social injury and:
(a) a desired change in the company's
activities would have a direct and ma
larial effect in alleviating such injury.

(b) ... practical shareholder rights
(e.g., voting proxies) have been ex
hausted, (c) the company has been af
forded the maximum reasonable
opportunity to alter its activities, and
(d) no alleviation of the substantial
social injury is likely within a
reasonable time; and
(3) A campus Commission on In
vestment Responsibility (consisting
of faculty, students, alumni and staff)
to hear members of the University
community, consider issues and make
recommendations to the trustees.
Insufficient compliance with the
Sullivan Principles and the sale of
equipment that directly strengthens
apartheid certainly fall within the
scope of Paragraph (2) of the policy.
The results of the ASSU referen
dum will inform the CIR of student
attitudes on the issue and, one would
expect, influence its agenda for the
year. (The Commission held its first
meeting on Oct. 22.) It is important
to understand, however, that the ref
erendum will mark the beginning of a
long, careful and well-established
process and that, accordingly,
precipitous action should not be ex
pected.
Stanford's policies for responsible
and ethical investing were developed
with very strong and articulate stu
dent input, and they have been
refined over seven years of the ClR's
existence. They are effective policies,
and they can encompass the remedies
sought in the ASSU referendum if
these can be justified by fact finding
and deliberation. (This would have
been explained in the ASSU Fall
Election Pamphlet had the sponsors
of the referendum asked one of Stan
ford's investment officers for a state
ment.) The policies are designed, to
the best of the ability of the many
people involved, to balance the effec
tiveness of taking specific actions
against apartheid (and other in

stances of substantial social injury)
with the financial impact such actions
may have on Stanford and those who
pay its bills.
For example, the policy provides
for selective divestiture in the circum
stances described above. The exis
tence of these circumstances must be
determined on a case-by-case basis.
(It is the job of the campus CIR to re
search the matter and make recom
mendations to the trustees.) Total
divestiture, such as called for Samoff,
or divestiture according to a mechani
cal formula, would violate an impor
tant principle of due process, would
be unfair to many of the companies
involved and would be an unworthy
act by Stanford regardless of its moti
vation. Moreover, it would be inef
fective because it would soon be
forgotten and would completely
remove Stanford's voice from the
arena of shareholder action with
respect to South Africa.
Total divestiture could also be
costly to Stanford in financial terms.
One would want to be sure that
potentially large financial sacrifices
on Stanford's part would actually
produce tangible results before con
sidering total divestiture. But the fact
is, there is no evidence that any such
results would be forthcoming.
We interpret the ASSU referen
dum as advocating selective
divestiture. Total divestiture would
not be a responsible policy and would
not be acceptable at Stanford. We
must find ways of dealing with apar
theid, and other cases of substantial
social injury, within an investment
structure that is fully responsible and
balanced, that has due regard for the
rights of all concerned and that deals
with the complexities of the issue in a
realistic fashion.

'Stanford already has a responsible
investment policy. It was formulated
iij 1977 to deal with precisely the set
of issues now facing us. (See the
"Statement on Investment Responsi
bility Concerning Endowment Secur
ities," Dec. 27, 1977.) The policy
provides for:
T(1) Voting of proxies in the interest
of social responsibility;
T(2) Divestiture, where the trustees
conclude that a company's activities
c&use substantial social injury and:
(a) a desired change in the company's
activities would have a direct and ma
larial effect in alleviating such injury.

(b) ... practical shareholder rights
(e.g., voting proxies) have been ex
hausted, (c) the company has been af
forded the maximum reasonable
opportunity to alter its activities, and
(d) no alleviation of the substantial
social injury is likely within a
reasonable time; and
(3) A campus Commission on In
vestment Responsibility (consisting
of faculty, students, alumni and staff)
to hear members of the University
community, consider issues and make
recommendations to the trustees.
Insufficient compliance with the
Sullivan Principles and the sale of
equipment that directly strengthens
apartheid certainly fall within the
scope of Paragraph (2) of the policy.
The results of the ASSU referen
dum will inform the CIR of student
attitudes on the issue and, one would
expect, influence its agenda for the
year. (The Commission held its first
meeting on Oct. 22.) It is important
to understand, however, that the ref
erendum will mark the beginning of a
long, careful and well-established
process and that, accordingly,
precipitous action should not be ex
pected.
Stanford's policies for responsible
and ethical investing were developed
with very strong and articulate stu
dent input, and they have been
refined over seven years of the ClR's
existence. They are effective policies,
and they can encompass the remedies
sought in the ASSU referendum if
these can be justified by fact finding
and deliberation. (This would have
been explained in the ASSU Fall
Election Pamphlet had the sponsors
of the referendum asked one of Stan
ford's investment officers for a state
ment.) The policies are designed, to
the best of the ability of the many
people involved, to balance the effec
tiveness of taking specific actions
against apartheid (and other in

stances of substantial social injury)
with the financial impact such actions
may have on Stanford and those who
pay its bills.
For example, the policy provides
for selective divestiture in the circum
stances described above. The exis
tence of these circumstances must be
determined on a case-by-case basis.
(It is the job of the campus CIR to re
search the matter and make recom
mendations to the trustees.) Total
divestiture, such as called for Samoff,
or divestiture according to a mechani
cal formula, would violate an impor
tant principle of due process, would
be unfair to many of the companies
involved and would be an unworthy
act by Stanford regardless of its moti
vation. Moreover, it would be inef
fective because it would soon be
forgotten and would completely
remove Stanford's voice from the
arena of shareholder action with
respect to South Africa.
Total divestiture could also be
costly to Stanford in financial terms.
One would want to be sure that
potentially large financial sacrifices
on Stanford's part would actually
produce tangible results before con
sidering total divestiture. But the fact
is, there is no evidence that any such
results would be forthcoming.
We interpret the ASSU referen
dum as advocating selective
divestiture. Total divestiture would
not be a responsible policy and would
not be acceptable at Stanford. We
must find ways of dealing with apar
theid, and other cases of substantial
social injury, within an investment
structure that is fully responsible and
balanced, that has due regard for the
rights of all concerned and that deals
with the complexities of the issue in a
realistic fashion.

The ASSU referendum on Stan
ford investments in South Africa and
the recent letter (The Daily, Oct. 19)
by Rachel Samoff advocate the for
mulation of an investment policy that
will aid, it is hoped, in the eventual
elimination of apartheid practices in
s»outh Africa. The ultimate end these
authors are seeking is laudable. It is
worthwhile, however, to consider
carefully the means used to achieve

VIEWPOINT

this end. Some of the means that
hrave been proposed (e.g., total
divestiture) seem not to include the
crucial processes of fact finding and
value balancing in their race for the
laudable end.
