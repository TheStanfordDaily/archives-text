## Roots of cold war are within 
### 
I No subject has girded American foreign policy
more than the problem of relations with the Soviet
Union. After surveying the unrivaled intellectual
resources of this nation and its traditions of
tolerance for a wide spectrum of political and moral
beliefs, one may find the apparent inability of the
United States to develop a consistent, long-range
design for superpower relations at best enigmatic
and at worst distressing.
I In many respects, the United States has yet to
comprehend the unusual circumstances which
brought it to a position of world leadership. Those
of us born in the 1960s may have difficulty imagin
ing America as a nation in self-imposed isolation.
In the present context, naked fear of a nuclear win
ter surely cannot substitute for self-awareness and
historical understanding.
• For years, scholars literally have sought to dis
cover the roots of superpower rivalry in the two na
tions' war-time negotiations over Eastern Europe,
tlieir dispute regarding the fate of Germany, and
tUeir mutually exclusive programs to develop
atomic technology. Yet, to grasp the conflicting im
pulses behind U.S.-Soviet relations, one ultimately
must look beyond the postwar record to America's
first tentative encounters with the outside world.
Contrary to the view engendered by a popular un
dergraduate course. American history did not
begin in 1945. Contrary to the prophetic writings of
Jonathan Schell. nuclear weapons did not alter the
e&during moral tensions in American diplomacy
bOt merely exacerbated beyond imagination the
consequence of failure.
'The recent commemoration of D-Day on the
beaches ot Normandy may provide a starting point
toward broader understanding. With a keen eye to
live present situation. Lance Morrow wistfully
romarked: "Never again, it may be, would war
soem so unimpeachably right, so necessary and
just. Never again, perhaps, would American power

and morality so perfectly coincide."
The problem of reconciling our unprecedented
military strength and deeply felt yearnings for se
curity with our national conceptions of justice has
formed the central challenge for American foreign
policy. Like (former President) Woodrow Wilson
at Versailles, we fervently seek to prevail not by
force but by the goodness of our values; we
desire to bring about permanent peace through our
trustworthiness and good will. Like the Declaration
of Independence, we hold our truths to be "self
evident"; yet, we ultimately consign ourselves to
dejection when we presume that genuine peace
turns upon such homilies.
Never before in its history has the United States
confronted a foreign adversary over an extended
period of time. In 1917 and 1941, the American
people responded unashamedly to overt aggression
by bringing to bear overwhelming military force.
As such, the nation today remains largely unpre
pared to deal with an ongoing conflict to which we
can envision no resolution, an engagement which
nonetheless remains charged with moral ambiguity.
The recent events in Central America exemplify
our inability to respond to marginal accretions of
power by the Soviet Union while preserving our
sympathy for the people of the region. One may
not give Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko high marks for congeniality, yet it would
appear the venerable Soviet diplomat does possess
an understanding of the conflicting impulses behind
American foreign policy that is in many respects
superior to our own. The Soviet Union's longtime
lack of formidable military might and its historical
connection with 19th-century European diplomacy
have enabled its leaders to operate in an interna
tional system ultimately governed by calculations of
power and national interest. By contrast, America
has yet to reconcile its visionary ideals with the lim
ited range of possibilities.

While posterity may legitimately question Henry
Kissinger's policies regarding Chile and Southeast
Asia, the former secretary of state understood that
the United States could not simply ignore its co
equal rival while attempting to bring the Soviet mil
itary economy to its knees. Yet, unlike so many
leaders today, he also realized that no nation could
build international stability through a frantic dash
to the negotiating table. Even a skeptical reader of
the historical record would note the anomalous
stability within the Politburo (and for that matter,
within the White House) that brought the SALT
process to fruition. Both Kissinger and Gromyko
viewed arms control not as an end in itself but as a
limited means for the achievement of imperfect
peace, which — outside of heaven — is the only
kind.
The young Kissinger once observed that "nations
learn only by experience; they 'know' only when it
is too late to act." Far from serving as a memorial
to detente, contemporary events underscore the
failure of Kissinger — for all his secretive
diplomatic wizardry — to lead the American
people toward a deeper understanding of their na
tional experience. As a consequence, today's politi
cal dialogue lacks a sober assessment of
U.S.-Soviet relations, one bled of the moral
declamations of the political left and right.
To understand the Soviet Union, we must first
understand ourselves. Like Quentin Compson in
William Faulkner's "Absalom, Absalom," we must
confront the ambiguous legacy of our own past; we
must recognize the peculiar set of conflicting
desires that is the essence of being an American.
Perhaps then the United States may fulfill its ambi
tion to play a constructive role in the enduring
struggle for peace and dignity that we call history.
