Escondido rent ripoff
My remarks in "Unfair rent in
creases still trouble Escondido resi
dents" (The Daily, Oct. 26) were so
profoundly misrepresented, I won't
even try to make sense of the story.
It's so much more important to
get out the facts.
In May, at the height of
graduate student protests against
rent increases proposed for Escon
dido Village, the University quietly
adopted a 1984-85 housing budget
that overcharges campus residents
for electricity by $300,000 or about
10 percent.
One month later, in June, the
University utility system cut its rates
44 percent to all campus users be
cause electrical rates had not risen
as rapidly as projected. The reduc
tion lasted three months and saved
the University Housing Office
$102,000, according to Housing
Director Edward Scoles. Not a
penny of the savings were passed on
to campus residents.
The two decisions, involving
$402,000, could have shaved about
3 percent from the rental increase
approved for Escondido Village,
Scoles estimated.
In fact, the University considered
reducing its 1984-85 rent increase in
the Village to reflect the lower than
expected rates. But administrators
rejected the idea for reasons of
bureaucratic convenience. The elec
trical surcharge paid by Escondido
Village residents, instead, will allow
the University to reduce the impact
of paying for Governor's Corner,
the lavish new undergraduate
residence.
Here's what happened.
In May, it became clear that
Pacific Gas and Electric Company
rates were growing more slowly than
the University had projected, Scoles
said. (The wet winters of 1981-82
and 1982-83 permitted greater than
usual generation of cheap
hydroelectric power.) So a proposal
was prepared. It would raise Village
rents 9.5 percent across the board
instead of the 10.85 percent in
crease then under consideration.
The lower rent increase was
vetoed, however, by Vice President
for Business and Finance William
Massy, with the approval of Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy,
Massy said. Massy and Housing
Director Scoles gave two reasons for
retaining the higher rent hike even
though the projection upon which it
was based was discredited.
First, the University had already
notified financial aid providers of

Stanford's costs. "To go hack to
those agencies, we felt, would be
very bad public relations," Scoles
explained. "We've never changed
rates that late."
"it would have meant re-doing a
whole lot of school forms by small
amounts," added Massy.
Massy said the second reason for
retaining the higher rent was a
policy of sticking with a budget once
it is drawn. The electricity
"windfall," he said, was substantial,
"but I feel quite comfortable that
it's not good policy to go back and
make an adjustment when one of
these hits."
That policy, however, was not
observed by the University Utility
System when it cut its rates. The
utility system had "over-recovered"
so much money from other depart
ments for electricity in the fiscal
year that ended Aug. 31, that it
slashed rates from June 1 to Sept. 1
from 8 cents per kilowatt hour to
4.5 cents, according to Scoles.
Scoles said the second windfall
was not passed on to residents be
cause the housing system is cur
rently operating at a deficit. Since
the debt service for Governor's
Corner was added, the housing
system has operated with a planned
loss. The deficits, however, are
covered by past rental surpluses,
Scoles noted.
"A fortuitous event like this was
very welcome," said Scoles. "You
take this as a freebie [from]
P.G. & E."
But this "fortuitous" event was
not a "freebie" from P.G. & E. It
was and is being paid by the resi
dents of Escondido Village who
have been trying without success to
communicate to this administration
their pain over rents that have
doubled in five years.
Escondido Village rents for the
1984-85 fiscal year just begun
should yield $7,519,000, according
to Scoles. Twenty-six percent of
that, or $1,998,000, is used to sub
sidize other housing operations,
principally the debt service on the
800-unit Governor's Corner com
plex, he explained.
That 26 percent means I pay
$130 per month to subsidize rents at
Governor's Corner. On top of that,
I pay an additional $17 a month in
fake electrical charges.
It's too much.

Only want to help
As three members of the Dean of
Student Affairs Committee on Alco
hol, we would like to respond to

your editorial regarding resident
assistants in the role of "party
police." There are several major
inaccuracies in the editorial which
we would like to correct.
First, the alcohol-incident forms
do not originate from Residential
Education but from the Dean of
Student Affairs Committee on Alco
hol, which has been in existence for
four years. We have heard many
reports from students, usually
anecdotal, of physical illness and
injury, assaultive behavior and van
dalism related to alcohol misuse.
The form you refer to is designed to
determine the extent and conse
quences of alcohol-related incidents
in the residence system. It will be
used to guide student programming
to avoid alcohol-related problems.
In no way will this data be used to
regulate alcohol use, nor to uncover
the problems of specific students or
residences.
The sole concern of the DOS A
Committee on Alcohol is health and
safety, not policing Stanford stu
dents. We would like to know the
true extent of alcohol-related prob
lems to prevent inappropriate and
avoidable situations which have
occurred, such as students walking
through plate glass windows, being
brought comatose to the emergency
room or driving through a crowd of
people while intoxicated.

"World Culture?" (The Daily, Oct.

Put if this results in more work for
the Western Culture tracks, then
Stanford will dissatisfy even more
students' desires for history than
now. For example. History 1-2-3
students read hundreds of pages of
text each week, yet the discussion
sections are extremely short. How
fully can a student understand Aris

one hour's worth of discussion? The
lectures are well-structured for note
taking, but is mere note taking
equivalent to appreciating our past?
I know Western Culture "gets
one's feet wet" with readings of
important periods in history, but
there's a difference between getting
one's feet wet and being drowned.

explained. "We've never changed
rates that late."
"it would have meant re-doing a
whole lot of school forms by small
amounts," added Massy.
Massy said the second reason for
retaining the higher rent was a
policy of sticking with a budget once
it is drawn. The electricity
"windfall," he said, was substantial,
"but I feel quite comfortable that
it's not good policy to go back and
make an adjustment when one of
these hits."
That policy, however, was not
observed by the University Utility
System when it cut its rates. The
utility system had "over-recovered"
so much money from other depart
ments for electricity in the fiscal
year that ended Aug. 31, that it
slashed rates from June 1 to Sept. 1
from 8 cents per kilowatt hour to
4.5 cents, according to Scoles.
Scoles said the second windfall
was not passed on to residents be
cause the housing system is cur
rently operating at a deficit. Since
the debt service for Governor's
Corner was added, the housing
system has operated with a planned
loss. The deficits, however, are
covered by past rental surpluses,
Scoles noted.
"A fortuitous event like this was
very welcome," said Scoles. "You
take this as a freebie [from]
P.G. & E."
But this "fortuitous" event was
not a "freebie" from P.G. & E. It
was and is being paid by the resi
dents of Escondido Village who
have been trying without success to
communicate to this administration
their pain over rents that have
doubled in five years.
Escondido Village rents for the
1984-85 fiscal year just begun
should yield $7,519,000, according
to Scoles. Twenty-six percent of
that, or $1,998,000, is used to sub
sidize other housing operations,
principally the debt service on the
800-unit Governor's Corner com
plex, he explained.
That 26 percent means I pay
$130 per month to subsidize rents at
Governor's Corner. On top of that,
I pay an additional $17 a month in
fake electrical charges.
It's too much.

Only want to help
As three members of the Dean of
Student Affairs Committee on Alco
hol, we would like to respond to

your editorial regarding resident
assistants in the role of "party
police." There are several major
inaccuracies in the editorial which
we would like to correct.
First, the alcohol-incident forms
do not originate from Residential
Education but from the Dean of
Student Affairs Committee on Alco
hol, which has been in existence for
four years. We have heard many
reports from students, usually
anecdotal, of physical illness and
injury, assaultive behavior and van
dalism related to alcohol misuse.
The form you refer to is designed to
determine the extent and conse
quences of alcohol-related incidents
in the residence system. It will be
used to guide student programming
to avoid alcohol-related problems.
In no way will this data be used to
regulate alcohol use, nor to uncover
the problems of specific students or
residences.
The sole concern of the DOS A
Committee on Alcohol is health and
safety, not policing Stanford stu
dents. We would like to know the
true extent of alcohol-related prob
lems to prevent inappropriate and
avoidable situations which have
occurred, such as students walking
through plate glass windows, being
brought comatose to the emergency
room or driving through a crowd of
people while intoxicated.

"World Culture?" (The Daily, Oct.

Put if this results in more work for
the Western Culture tracks, then
Stanford will dissatisfy even more
students' desires for history than
now. For example. History 1-2-3
students read hundreds of pages of
text each week, yet the discussion
sections are extremely short. How
fully can a student understand Aris

one hour's worth of discussion? The
lectures are well-structured for note
taking, but is mere note taking
equivalent to appreciating our past?
I know Western Culture "gets

important periods in history, but
there's a difference between getting
one's feet wet and being drowned.

Escondido rent ripoff
My remarks in "Unfair rent in
creases still trouble Escondido resi
dents" (The Daily, Oct. 26) were so
profoundly misrepresented, I won't
even try to make sense of the story.
It's so much more important to
get out the facts.
In May, at the height of
graduate student protests against
rent increases proposed for Escon
dido Village, the University quietly
adopted a 1984-85 housing budget
that overcharges campus residents
for electricity by $300,000 or about
10 percent.
One month later, in June, the
University utility system cut its rates
44 percent to all campus users be
cause electrical rates had not risen
as rapidly as projected. The reduc
tion lasted three months and saved
the University Housing Office
$102,000, according to Housing
Director Edward Scoles. Not a
penny of the savings were passed on
to campus residents.
The two decisions, involving
$402,000, could have shaved about
3 percent from the rental increase
approved for Escondido Village,
Scoles estimated.
In fact, the University considered
reducing its 1984-85 rent increase in
the Village to reflect the lower than
expected rates. But administrators
rejected the idea for reasons of
bureaucratic convenience. The elec
trical surcharge paid by Escondido
Village residents, instead, will allow
the University to reduce the impact
of paying for Governor's Corner,
the lavish new undergraduate
residence.
Here's what happened.
In May, it became clear that
Pacific Gas and Electric Company
rates were growing more slowly than
the University had projected, Scoles
said. (The wet winters of 1981-82
and 1982-83 permitted greater than
usual generation of cheap
hydroelectric power.) So a proposal
was prepared. It would raise Village
rents 9.5 percent across the board
instead of the 10.85 percent in
crease then under consideration.
The lower rent increase was
vetoed, however, by Vice President
for Business and Finance William
Massy, with the approval of Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy,
Massy said. Massy and Housing
Director Scoles gave two reasons for
retaining the higher rent hike even
though the projection upon which it
was based was discredited.
First, the University had already
notified financial aid providers of

Stanford's costs. "To go hack to
those agencies, we felt, would be
very bad public relations," Scoles
explained. "We've never changed
rates that late."
"it would have meant re-doing a
whole lot of school forms by small
amounts," added Massy.
