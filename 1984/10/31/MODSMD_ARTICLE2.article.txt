# Local 680 wins
## 
### MARK BEYREIS Staff writer 
Stanford technical, maintenance
and service workers voted 782 to 424
yesterday to adopt Local 680 as its
collective bargaining representative,
rejecting the University's "Stanford
Alternative."
Local 680 President Linda Crouse
said the vote was "a direct repudia
tion of (University President) Donald
Kennedy's union-busting tactics."
Stanford Counsel Priscilla Wheeler
said the University had wanted its
employees to decide in a National
Labor Relations Board elec
tion. "I'm glad they were able to do
that," Wheeler said.
"They appear to have made a
choice, and as I have said all along,
we will respect that choice and deal
responsibly with Local 680, if they
are certified by the NLRB," Wheeler
said.
Both sides said they were pleased
that 1,206 of about 1,330 eligible
voters cast ballots. Crouse said she
was happy about both the margin of
victory and the turnout.
Rob Parker, the University's direc
tor of personnel, said he was "very

pleased" with the turnout. "We really
wanted the outcome to be decided by
all the voters, not just a fraction,"
Parker said.
United Stanford Workers Counsel
Jim Eggleston said the results might
be official in as few as five days. The
process could be delayed if the Uni
versity chooses to file appeals.
At the time the election results
were announced, Parker said he was
not aware of any grounds for protest.
When the election is certified,
Stanford will once again recognize
the contract negotiated by Local
680's predecessor, Local 715, making
Local 680 the official representative
of Stanford workers. The contract
expires Aug. 1, 1985.
Eggleston said that in the light of
the outcome, he could see no legal
basis or any practical reasons for
Stanford to protest the result. A
University protest would show that
Stanford's desire to have an NLRB
election was a "sham," Eggleston
said.
Parker said, "I hope that [the two
sides] can come back together with a
fresh willingness to solve problems
earlier."

Crouse said the success of future
University-union relations depends
upon two things. First, Stanford must
recognize Local 680 as the demo
cratic choice of the workers, and
second, both sides must put the past
behind them.
A. H. Raskin, who served for many
years as a labor correspondent and
member of the editorial board of The
New York Times, said the University
ought to take the initiative toward a
more stable and cooperative relation
ship.
The union victory came after
several weeks of campaigning by both
the University and Local 680. In its
campaign for the "Stanford Alterna
tive," the University criticized Local
680's record and current leadership.
Crouse said Local 680 waged a
positive campaign while Stanford ran
"a dirty campaign."
Crouse said she was "filled with
pride" that the Local 680 bargaining
unit had withstood the University's
"union-breaking" campaign.
"I think Stanford wants a union
and union leadership it can control,"
she said. She accused the University
of favoring another union (Local
715) over Local 680 and favoring one
union leadership over another.
"Neither the internal workings of
the union nor the union leadership
are any of (University President)
Donald Kennedy's business," Crouse
added.
The union victory marks the end of
an eight-month battle between Local
680 and the University. The battle
concerns University recognition of
USW's change of affiliation from
Local 715 to Local 680.
Raskin, who is an ASSU guest pro
fessor, said the issue of changing from
Local 715 to 680 had always been
"microscopic." The University was
seizing upon the transfer of affiliation
as an excuse to rid itself of the union,
Raskin said.
