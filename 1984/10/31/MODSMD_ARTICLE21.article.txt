## Strong faculty recruits boost Stanford image 
### JOSEPH FIRSCHEIN 
"The academic image of Stanford
has increased substantially over the
last 20 years. We've made the big
time as an undergraduate institu
tion." These words of Provost James
Rosse reflect an opinion many at the
University share.
And there is a strong basis for this
opinion. Alumni Association Direc
tor William Stone, a 1963 Stanford
graduate, cites better test scores and
grades of recent applicants, a greater
number of applicants (15,600) and
higher yield (over 64 percent) of ac
cepted students enrolling as evidence
of the improving academic image of
the University. In addition to the high
number of applications, students ap
plied from 4,349 different high
schools, also a record number.
What is the reason for this in
creased interest in Stanford? What
did the University do to boost its
academics? According to Stanford
News Service Director Bob Beyers,
the answer to both of these questions
lies largely in the quality of the fac
ulty.
Beyers said that in the late 1950s
and early '60s the University took ad
vantage of increased research funding
and private support in order to get
the best faculty members possible.
This push was accomplished mainly
through the work of then University

President Wallace Sterling and
Provost Frederick Terman.
Sterling was president of the Uni
versity from 1949 to 1968 and ap
pointed Terman, who was then dean
of the Engineering Department, as
provost in 1955. According to
Beyers, Sterling was a key person in
providing broad leadership for Uni
versity education and fund raising.
He initiated the first study of under
graduate education at Stanford in
more than 20 years, and in 1961 he
organized the largest fund-raising
drive in Stanford history. During his
presidency, Stanford's faculty nearly
tripled in size and enrollment in
creased 40 percent, mainly at the
graduate level.
Sterling, who has been chancellor
since his retirement from the
presidency, led what was called "The
Stanford Campaign" from 1972-77.
This fund-raising drive netted $300
million for the University. It was un
der Sterling's leadership that the Uni
versity moved up to number two be
hind Harvard in private-gift support.
Because of Sterling's work in edu
cation and fund raising, Terman was
able to put his strategy to work in
bringing the best faculty to Stanford.
"Terman's strategy (in getting fac
ulty) was profoundly prophetic and
powerful," Beyers said. "He believed
that if the University could get the

pre-eminent professors, it would at
tract other professors and would get
students."
Beyers explained that many uni
versities would spend $60,000 to hire
five professors at $12,000 each. In
stead of this policy, Terman looked
for one outstanding professor at
$20,000 and was able to bring four
more into the department at $10,000.
The one excellent professor would
lead the department in the right di
rection and, in turn, would attract the
best students.
The success of Terman's philoso
phy can be seen in the development
of an outstanding computer science
faculty at Stanford. George Forsythe
came to Stanford in 1957 to be a pro
fessor of mathematics. At this time
there was some dispute about whe
ther the computer science depart
ment should be separate from the
mathematics department. Forsythe
was in favor of a separate department
and believed that the field of com
puter science could be beneficial to
other fields. In a Stanford news ser
vice release dated June 1962, For
sythe said, "Computer science itself
lies midway between engineering and
the humanities. It can serve as a con
necting link to heighten mutual un
derstanding and bring them closer to
gether."
It was decided that computer sci
ence should be a separate department
and Forsythe became executive head
in 1965. He proceeded to bring in im
portant people such as Profs. Edward
Feigenbaum and John McCarthy.
These professors formed two of the
main areas in which Stanford is now
dominant. McCarthy became a leader
in the development of artificial intel
ligence. Feigenbaum, together with
Prof. Bruce Buchanan and Nobel
Prize winner Joshua Lederburg,
began the Heuristic Programing Proj
ect at Stanford. It was in this project
that the first expert system was
developed.
Evidence of Stanford's excellent
computer science faculty can be
found in a 1982 survey of faculty in
the nation's major research institu
tions. In this survey the computer sci
ence faculty here received the num
ber one rating, followed by the Mas
sachusetts Institute of Technology.
The Stanford Chemistry Depart
ment, ranked fifth by the 1982 sur
vey, was similarly helped by Terman's
faculty choices in the late 19505. The
chemistry faculty was ranked 15th
nationally in 1957 and began rapid
improvement with Terman's appoint
ment of Prof. William Johnson as
head of the department. Johnson
proceeded to bring Profs. Henry
Taube, Carl Djerassi and Paul Flory
to the University. Flory and Taube
both went on to receive Nobel Prizes
in chemistry and all three professors

Computer science and chemistry
are only two examples of how a pro
fessor can initiate the improvement of
a department. Faculty improvements
made during the '50s and '60s also
improved a number of other depart
ments.
The 1982 survey of graduate fac
ulty mentioned above was also taken
in 1957, 1964 and 1969. In 1957 the
survey ranked Stanford faculty 13th
nationally overall, and in the 1982
survey the faculty received higher
rankings in every field except botany.
Although no overall ranking was
given in the 1982 survey, Stanford
ranked among the top 10 in 25 differ
ent departments, exceeded only by
the University of California at
Berkeley, which finished among the
top 10 in 30 of 32 fields. Besides
computer science, Stanford was rated
number one in biochemistry, psychol
ogy and statistics-biostatistics, and
was among the top five in seven other
fields.
Beyers said of the study, "the thing
that is clear is that overall, no other
private university moved as far and as
fast as Stanford in the '50s and '605."
The impact an excellent faculty in
graduate departments has on under
graduate teaching has been ques
tioned. But in the case of Stanford,
the good graduate faculty members
teach undergraduate classes as well.
For example, Chemistry Prof.
Richard Zare, a laser expert, recently
offered a comprehensive introductory
course on chemistry to non-science
undergraduates. Zare, who recently
discovered a technique for observing
and measuring the quantum states of
the products of chemical reactions
through use of a laser, said that the
only prerequisite for his Chemistry
123 course was an intellectual
curiosity about chemistry. Zare said
he hoped his course would provide a
shared appreciation by the students
of why science can be so exciting and
an appreciation of the "chemistry in
the world around them."
The emphasis on undergraduate
teaching by all faculty members is
shown in the publication "Stanford
Today," which lists the number of
graduate and undergraduate teachers
by department. The two numbers are
not always the same at major re
search universities, but at Stanford a
teaching emphasis is apparent. For
example, the Classics Department
has 17 faculty in the department and
17 faculty members teaching under
graduates. The Chemistry Depart
ment has 20 faculty in the department
and 20 teaching undergraduates. This
means that undergraduates are
exposed to professors who are often
the leading researchers in their fields.
According to Rosse, the presence

of a strong faculty at Stanford has
made it possible for the University to
take academic risks. One risk that he
mentioned is the work in interdis
ciplinary programs at Stanford. These
programs bring together faculty
members from different departments.
Stanford has interdisciplinary pro
grams in international relations,
human biology, public policy, VTS
and math sciences, to name a few.
According to Rosse, starting these
programs at Stanford was a risk be
cause they had no precedent. Most
schools would rather establish a new
department instead of going to an in

terdisciplinary program. Rosse said
that this method uses up resources in
ways that don't always pay off.
Stanford's interdisciplinary pro
grams do pay off because of the
department-based system here. "If
you are going to have a department
based institution like Stanford does,
then you need a mechanism to get the
right courses taught. You need a
meaningful interdisciplinary pro
gram," Rosse said.
Stanford also has not been afraid to
try non-traditional research programs
such as the Stanford Linear Ac

celerator Center the Center
for Research on Integrated Systems
(CIS), the Center For International
Security and Arms Control, the Stan
ford Synchrotron Radiation Research
Lab (a physics-based research pro
gram), the Center for Research on
Women (CROW) and Feminist
Studies.
These research programs, which in
itially posed funding risks to the Uni
versity, are successful because they
make it possible for detailed study
and often bring visiting scholars to
the University. The scholars, because

of their relations with the Stanford
departments and community, are
sometimes attracted here as full-time
faculty.
The faculty strength and successful
academic programs, when combined
with the favorable environment at
Stanford, has made the University
more attractive than ever. As John
Bunnell, associate dean of admissions
and director of freshman admissions,
said, "People see the excellence of
the faculty and the environment and
conclude that this is the place they
want to be."

Computer science and chemistry
are only two examples of how a pro
fessor can initiate the improvement of
a department. Faculty improvements
made during the '50s and '60s also
improved a number of other depart
ments.
The 1982 survey of graduate fac
ulty mentioned above was also taken
in 1957, 1964 and 1969. In 1957 the
survey ranked Stanford faculty 13th
nationally overall, and in the 1982
survey the faculty received higher
rankings in every field except botany.
Although no overall ranking was
given in the 1982 survey, Stanford
ranked among the top 10 in 25 differ
ent departments, exceeded only by
the University of California at
Berkeley, which finished among the
top 10 in 30 of 32 fields. Besides
computer science, Stanford was rated
number one in biochemistry, psychol
ogy and statistics-biostatistics, and
was among the top five in seven other
fields.
Beyers said of the study, "the thing
that is clear is that overall, no other
private university moved as far and as
fast as Stanford in the '50s and '605."
The impact an excellent faculty in
graduate departments has on under
graduate teaching has been ques
tioned. But in the case of Stanford,
the good graduate faculty members
teach undergraduate classes as well.
For example, Chemistry Prof.
Richard Zare, a laser expert, recently
offered a comprehensive introductory
course on chemistry to non-science
undergraduates. Zare, who recently
discovered a technique for observing
and measuring the quantum states of
the products of chemical reactions
through use of a laser, said that the
only prerequisite for his Chemistry
123 course was an intellectual
curiosity about chemistry. Zare said
he hoped his course would provide a
shared appreciation by the students
of why science can be so exciting and
an appreciation of the "chemistry in
the world around them."
The emphasis on undergraduate
teaching by all faculty members is
shown in the publication "Stanford
Today," which lists the number of
graduate and undergraduate teachers
by department. The two numbers are
not always the same at major re
search universities, but at Stanford a
teaching emphasis is apparent. For
example, the Classics Department
has 17 faculty in the department and
17 faculty members teaching under
graduates. The Chemistry Depart
ment has 20 faculty in the department
and 20 teaching undergraduates. This
means that undergraduates are
exposed to professors who are often
the leading researchers in their fields.
According to Rosse, the presence

of a strong faculty at Stanford has
made it possible for the University to
take academic risks. One risk that he
mentioned is the work in interdis
ciplinary programs at Stanford. These
programs bring together faculty
members from different departments.
Stanford has interdisciplinary pro
grams in international relations,
human biology, public policy, VTS
and math sciences, to name a few.
According to Rosse, starting these
programs at Stanford was a risk be
cause they had no precedent. Most
schools would rather establish a new
department instead of going to an in

terdisciplinary program. Rosse said
that this method uses up resources in
ways that don't always pay off.
Stanford's interdisciplinary pro
grams do pay off because of the
department-based system here. "If
you are going to have a department
based institution like Stanford does,
then you need a mechanism to get the
right courses taught. You need a
meaningful interdisciplinary pro
gram," Rosse said.
Stanford also has not been afraid to
try non-traditional research programs
such as the Stanford Linear Ac

celerator Center the Center
for Research on Integrated Systems
(CIS), the Center For International
Security and Arms Control, the Stan
ford Synchrotron Radiation Research
Lab (a physics-based research pro
gram), the Center for Research on
Women (CROW) and Feminist
Studies.
These research programs, which in
itially posed funding risks to the Uni
versity, are successful because they
make it possible for detailed study
and often bring visiting scholars to
the University. The scholars, because

of their relations with the Stanford
departments and community, are
sometimes attracted here as full-time
faculty.
The faculty strength and successful
academic programs, when combined
with the favorable environment at
Stanford, has made the University
more attractive than ever. As John

tracting name faculty to Stanford during the '50s and '60s.
"The academic image of Stanford
has increased substantially over the
last 20 years. We've made the big
time as an undergraduate institu
tion." These words of Provost James
Rosse reflect an opinion many at the
University share.
And there is a strong basis for this
opinion. Alumni Association Direc
tor William Stone, a 1963 Stanford
graduate, cites better test scores and
grades of recent applicants, a greater
number of applicants (15,600) and
higher yield (over 64 percent) of ac
cepted students enrolling as evidence
of the improving academic image of
the University. In addition to the high
number of applications, students ap
plied from 4,349 different high
schools, also a record number.
What is the reason for this in
creased interest in Stanford? What
did the University do to boost its
academics? According to Stanford
News Service Director Bob Beyers,
the answer to both of these questions
lies largely in the quality of the fac
ulty.
Beyers said that in the late 1950s
and early '60s the University took ad
vantage of increased research funding
and private support in order to get
the best faculty members possible.
This push was accomplished mainly
through the work of then University

President Wallace Sterling and
Provost Frederick Terman.
Sterling was president of the Uni
versity from 1949 to 1968 and ap
pointed Terman, who was then dean
of the Engineering Department, as
provost in 1955. According to
Beyers, Sterling was a key person in
providing broad leadership for Uni
versity education and fund raising.
He initiated the first study of under
graduate education at Stanford in
more than 20 years, and in 1961 he
organized the largest fund-raising
drive in Stanford history. During his
presidency, Stanford's faculty nearly
tripled in size and enrollment in
creased 40 percent, mainly at the
graduate level.
Sterling, who has been chancellor
since his retirement from the
presidency, led what was called "The
Stanford Campaign" from 1972-77.
This fund-raising drive netted $300
million for the University. It was un
der Sterling's leadership that the Uni
versity moved up to number two be
hind Harvard in private-gift support.
Because of Sterling's work in edu
cation and fund raising, Terman was
able to put his strategy to work in
bringing the best faculty to Stanford.
"Terman's strategy (in getting fac
ulty) was profoundly prophetic and
powerful," Beyers said. "He believed
that if the University could get the

pre-eminent professors, it would at
tract other professors and would get
students."
Beyers explained that many uni
versities would spend $60,000 to hire
five professors at $12,000 each. In
stead of this policy, Terman looked
for one outstanding professor at
$20,000 and was able to bring four
more into the department at $10,000.
The one excellent professor would
lead the department in the right di
rection and, in turn, would attract the
best students.
The success of Terman's philoso
phy can be seen in the development
of an outstanding computer science
faculty at Stanford. George Forsythe
came to Stanford in 1957 to be a pro
fessor of mathematics. At this time
there was some dispute about whe
ther the computer science depart
ment should be separate from the
mathematics department. Forsythe
was in favor of a separate department
and believed that the field of com
puter science could be beneficial to
other fields. In a Stanford news ser
vice release dated June 1962, For
sythe said, "Computer science itself
lies midway between engineering and
the humanities. It can serve as a con
necting link to heighten mutual un
derstanding and bring them closer to
gether."
It was decided that computer sci
ence should be a separate department
and Forsythe became executive head
in 1965. He proceeded to bring in im
portant people such as Profs. Edward
Feigenbaum and John McCarthy.
These professors formed two of the
main areas in which Stanford is now
dominant. McCarthy became a leader
in the development of artificial intel
ligence. Feigenbaum, together with
Prof. Bruce Buchanan and Nobel
Prize winner Joshua Lederburg,
began the Heuristic Programing Proj
ect at Stanford. It was in this project
that the first expert system was
developed.
Evidence of Stanford's excellent
computer science faculty can be
found in a 1982 survey of faculty in
the nation's major research institu
tions. In this survey the computer sci
ence faculty here received the num
ber one rating, followed by the Mas
sachusetts Institute of Technology.
The Stanford Chemistry Depart
ment, ranked fifth by the 1982 sur
vey, was similarly helped by Terman's
faculty choices in the late 19505. The
chemistry faculty was ranked 15th
nationally in 1957 and began rapid
improvement with Terman's appoint
ment of Prof. William Johnson as
head of the department. Johnson
proceeded to bring Profs. Henry
Taube, Carl Djerassi and Paul Flory
to the University. Flory and Taube
both went on to receive Nobel Prizes
in chemistry and all three professors

schools, also a record number.
What is the reason for this in
creased interest in Stanford? What
did the University do to boost its
academics? According to Stanford
News Service Director Bob Beyers,
the answer to both of these questions
lies largely in the quality of the fac
ulty.
Beyers said that in the late 1950s
and early '60s the University took ad
vantage of increased research funding
and private support in order to get
the best faculty members possible.
This push was accomplished mainly
through the work of then University

President Wallace Sterling and
Provost Frederick Terman.
Sterling was president of the Uni
versity from 1949 to 1968 and ap
pointed Terman, who was then dean
of the Engineering Department, as
provost in 1955. According to
Beyers, Sterling was a key person in
providing broad leadership for Uni
versity education and fund raising.
He initiated the first study of under
graduate education at Stanford in
more than 20 years, and in 1961 he
organized the largest fund-raising
drive in Stanford history. During his
presidency, Stanford's faculty nearly
tripled in size and enrollment in
creased 40 percent, mainly at the
graduate level.
Sterling, who has been chancellor
since his retirement from the
presidency, led what was called "The
Stanford Campaign" from 1972-77.
This fund-raising drive netted $300
million for the University. It was un
der Sterling's leadership that the Uni
versity moved up to number two be
hind Harvard in private-gift support.
Because of Sterling's work in edu
cation and fund raising, Terman was
able to put his strategy to work in
bringing the best faculty to Stanford.
"Terman's strategy (in getting fac
ulty) was profoundly prophetic and
powerful," Beyers said. "He believed
that if the University could get the

pre-eminent professors, it would at
tract other professors and would get
students."
Beyers explained that many uni
versities would spend $60,000 to hire
five professors at $12,000 each. In
stead of this policy, Terman looked
for one outstanding professor at
$20,000 and was able to bring four
more into the department at $10,000.
The one excellent professor would
lead the department in the right di
rection and, in turn, would attract the
best students.
The success of Terman's philoso
phy can be seen in the development
of an outstanding computer science
faculty at Stanford. George Forsythe
came to Stanford in 1957 to be a pro
fessor of mathematics. At this time
there was some dispute about whe
ther the computer science depart
ment should be separate from the
mathematics department. Forsythe
was in favor of a separate department
and believed that the field of com
puter science could be beneficial to
other fields. In a Stanford news ser
vice release dated June 1962, For
sythe said, "Computer science itself
lies midway between engineering and
the humanities. It can serve as a con
necting link to heighten mutual un
derstanding and bring them closer to
gether."
It was decided that computer sci
ence should be a separate department
and Forsythe became executive head
in 1965. He proceeded to bring in im
portant people such as Profs. Edward
Feigenbaum and John McCarthy.
These professors formed two of the
main areas in which Stanford is now
dominant. McCarthy became a leader
in the development of artificial intel
ligence. Feigenbaum, together with
Prof. Bruce Buchanan and Nobel
Prize winner Joshua Lederburg,
began the Heuristic Programing Proj
ect at Stanford. It was in this project
that the first expert system was
developed.
Evidence of Stanford's excellent
computer science faculty can be
found in a 1982 survey of faculty in
the nation's major research institu
tions. In this survey the computer sci
ence faculty here received the num
ber one rating, followed by the Mas
sachusetts Institute of Technology.
The Stanford Chemistry Depart
ment, ranked fifth by the 1982 sur
vey, was similarly helped by Terman's
faculty choices in the late 19505. The
chemistry faculty was ranked 15th
nationally in 1957 and began rapid
improvement with Terman's appoint
ment of Prof. William Johnson as
head of the department. Johnson
proceeded to bring Profs. Henry
Taube, Carl Djerassi and Paul Flory
to the University. Flory and Taube
both went on to receive Nobel Prizes
in chemistry and all three professors

Computer science and chemistry
are only two examples of how a pro
fessor can initiate the improvement of
a department. Faculty improvements
made during the '50s and '60s also
improved a number of other depart
ments.
The 1982 survey of graduate fac
ulty mentioned above was also taken
in 1957, 1964 and 1969. In 1957 the
survey ranked Stanford faculty 13th
nationally overall, and in the 1982
survey the faculty received higher
rankings in every field except botany.
Although no overall ranking was
given in the 1982 survey, Stanford
ranked among the top 10 in 25 differ
ent departments, exceeded only by
the University of California at
Berkeley, which finished among the
top 10 in 30 of 32 fields. Besides
computer science, Stanford was rated
number one in biochemistry, psychol
ogy and statistics-biostatistics, and
was among the top five in seven other
fields.
Beyers said of the study, "the thing
that is clear is that overall, no other
private university moved as far and as
fast as Stanford in the '50s and '605."
The impact an excellent faculty in
graduate departments has on under
graduate teaching has been ques
tioned. But in the case of Stanford,
the good graduate faculty members
teach undergraduate classes as well.
For example, Chemistry Prof.
Richard Zare, a laser expert, recently
offered a comprehensive introductory
course on chemistry to non-science
undergraduates. Zare, who recently
discovered a technique for observing
and measuring the quantum states of
the products of chemical reactions
through use of a laser, said that the
only prerequisite for his Chemistry
123 course was an intellectual
curiosity about chemistry. Zare said
he hoped his course would provide a
shared appreciation by the students
of why science can be so exciting and
an appreciation of the "chemistry in
the world around them."
The emphasis on undergraduate
teaching by all faculty members is
shown in the publication "Stanford
Today," which lists the number of
graduate and undergraduate teachers
by department. The two numbers are
not always the same at major re
search universities, but at Stanford a
teaching emphasis is apparent. For
example, the Classics Department
has 17 faculty in the department and
17 faculty members teaching under
graduates. The Chemistry Depart
ment has 20 faculty in the department
and 20 teaching undergraduates. This
means that undergraduates are
exposed to professors who are often
the leading researchers in their fields.
According to Rosse, the presence

of a strong faculty at Stanford has
made it possible for the University to
take academic risks. One risk that he
mentioned is the work in interdis
ciplinary programs at Stanford. These
programs bring together faculty
members from different departments.
Stanford has interdisciplinary pro
grams in international relations,
human biology, public policy, VTS
and math sciences, to name a few.
According to Rosse, starting these
programs at Stanford was a risk be
cause they had no precedent. Most
schools would rather establish a new
department instead of going to an in

terdisciplinary program. Rosse said
that this method uses up resources in
ways that don't always pay off.
Stanford's interdisciplinary pro
grams do pay off because of the
department-based system here. "If
you are going to have a department
based institution like Stanford does,
then you need a mechanism to get the
right courses taught. You need a
meaningful interdisciplinary pro
gram," Rosse said.
Stanford also has not been afraid to
try non-traditional research programs
such as the Stanford Linear Ac

celerator Center the Center
for Research on Integrated Systems
(CIS), the Center For International
Security and Arms Control, the Stan
ford Synchrotron Radiation Research
Lab (a physics-based research pro
gram), the Center for Research on
Women (CROW) and Feminist
Studies.
These research programs, which in
itially posed funding risks to the Uni
versity, are successful because they
make it possible for detailed study
and often bring visiting scholars to
the University. The scholars, because

of their relations with the Stanford
departments and community, are
sometimes attracted here as full-time
faculty.
The faculty strength and successful
academic programs, when combined
with the favorable environment at
Stanford, has made the University
more attractive than ever. As John
Bunnell, associate dean of admissions
and director of freshman admissions,
said, "People see the excellence of
the faculty and the environment and
conclude that this is the place they
want to be."

Computer science and chemistry
are only two examples of how a pro
fessor can initiate the improvement of
a department. Faculty improvements
made during the '50s and '60s also
improved a number of other depart
ments.
The 1982 survey of graduate fac
ulty mentioned above was also taken
in 1957, 1964 and 1969. In 1957 the
survey ranked Stanford faculty 13th
nationally overall, and in the 1982
survey the faculty received higher
rankings in every field except botany.
Although no overall ranking was
given in the 1982 survey, Stanford
ranked among the top 10 in 25 differ
ent departments, exceeded only by
the University of California at
Berkeley, which finished among the
top 10 in 30 of 32 fields. Besides
computer science, Stanford was rated
number one in biochemistry, psychol
ogy and statistics-biostatistics, and
was among the top five in seven other
fields.
Beyers said of the study, "the thing
that is clear is that overall, no other
private university moved as far and as
fast as Stanford in the '50s and '605."
The impact an excellent faculty in
graduate departments has on under
graduate teaching has been ques
tioned. But in the case of Stanford,
the good graduate faculty members
teach undergraduate classes as well.
For example, Chemistry Prof.
Richard Zare, a laser expert, recently
offered a comprehensive introductory
course on chemistry to non-science
undergraduates. Zare, who recently
discovered a technique for observing
and measuring the quantum states of
the products of chemical reactions
through use of a laser, said that the
only prerequisite for his Chemistry
123 course was an intellectual
curiosity about chemistry. Zare said
he hoped his course would provide a
shared appreciation by the students
of why science can be so exciting and
an appreciation of the "chemistry in
the world around them."
The emphasis on undergraduate
teaching by all faculty members is
shown in the publication "Stanford
Today," which lists the number of
graduate and undergraduate teachers
by department. The two numbers are
not always the same at major re
search universities, but at Stanford a
teaching emphasis is apparent. For
example, the Classics Department
has 17 faculty in the department and
17 faculty members teaching under
graduates. The Chemistry Depart
ment has 20 faculty in the department
and 20 teaching undergraduates. This
means that undergraduates are
exposed to professors who are often
the leading researchers in their fields.
According to Rosse, the presence

of a strong faculty at Stanford has
made it possible for the University to
take academic risks. One risk that he
mentioned is the work in interdis
ciplinary programs at Stanford. These
programs bring together faculty
members from different departments.
Stanford has interdisciplinary pro
grams in international relations,
human biology, public policy, VTS
and math sciences, to name a few.
According to Rosse, starting these
programs at Stanford was a risk be
cause they had no precedent. Most
schools would rather establish a new
department instead of going to an in

terdisciplinary program. Rosse said
that this method uses up resources in
ways that don't always pay off.
Stanford's interdisciplinary pro
grams do pay off because of the
department-based system here. "If
you are going to have a department
based institution like Stanford does,
then you need a mechanism to get the
right courses taught. You need a
meaningful interdisciplinary pro
gram," Rosse said.
Stanford also has not been afraid to
try non-traditional research programs
such as the Stanford Linear Ac

celerator Center the Center
for Research on Integrated Systems
(CIS), the Center For International
Security and Arms Control, the Stan
ford Synchrotron Radiation Research
Lab (a physics-based research pro
gram), the Center for Research on
Women (CROW) and Feminist
Studies.
These research programs, which in
itially posed funding risks to the Uni
versity, are successful because they
make it possible for detailed study
and often bring visiting scholars to
the University. The scholars, because

of their relations with the Stanford
departments and community, are
sometimes attracted here as full-time
faculty.
The faculty strength and successful
academic programs, when combined
with the favorable environment at
Stanford, has made the University
more attractive than ever. As John
Bunnell, associate dean of admissions
and director of freshman admissions,
said, "People see the excellence of
the faculty and the environment and
conclude that this is the place they
want to be."
