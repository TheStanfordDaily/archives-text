### CLINT HIGHFILL 
Stop that booth
Thursday, Oct. 18, 1:30 a.m. The Den
ser. Colo., Police Department receives a
call. Heading down University Avenue — a
four-lane artery that runs through the city —
is a Mountain Bell telephone booth.
Apparently, four members of Denver Uni
versity's Sigma Chi fraternity had decided
earlier in the day to snag a phone booth.
So, motivated by a few drinks and armed
with wire cutters and explosives — to separate
booth and anchor bolts— the students set out
to assault the victim in front of the university's
administration building.

All went smoothly, but the M-80 firecrack
ers used to dislodge the phone booth were a
little loud, and someone notified the authori
ties.
Meanwhile, the four loaded their phone
booth into a Safeway shopping cart and
started down University Avenue in the gen
eral direction of the Sigma Chi House.
But when the miscreants turned down the
side street leading home, they were surprised
to meet a squad car from the Denver Police
Department, Channel 4 News and Campus
Security.
The students all made a dash for it, and
three escaped. The one student caught was

charged with criminal mischief, but formal
charges were later dropped and the phone
booth returned.
Big game hunting
When the air turns crisp and the leaves fall
from the trees at Stanford, thoughts turn to
Big Game. At Washington State University,
autumn brings desires for a different sort of
big game.
It seems there's a bit of a stir at Washington
State over hunting. And while Stanford stu
dents this time of year are ready to go Bear
hunting, it seems Washington State students
are ready to go deer hunting.
An editorial in the Daily Evergreen states
its point clearly enough: "Hunting season is in
its second week now, and some of you are
probably dying to get away from the books
and out into that crisp autumn air. Hunting is
a good thing."
Hunting is tainted, the editorial says, by a
few bad apples who don't kill responsibly.
Meanwhile, Washington States' director of
Residence Living is offering a series of semi
nars on the joy of hunting. "The unfortunate
thing about hunting is taking an animal's life,"
the director said. "But there is much more to
the total experience than just killing. I like to
convey this to students."
The director shouid know what he's talking
about. He's hunted deer, Alaskan sheep and
Grizzly bears. But times are changing, and the
director finds his options limited. "Now I
can't hunt mountain sheep in Alaska in the
summer, but I can hunt Grizzly in the spring."
So when the Washington State Cougars
come down to Memorial Stadium in Berkeley
next month, Cal fans had better take seriously
any Washington State threats to kill the bears.
Vote for Nobody
In this year of less than desirable presiden
tial candidates, voting for nobody seems like
the best course.
And Nobody is exactly who the Nobody for
President Campaign is supporting as it moves
through 21 states this fall.
The campaign's special transport, "Nobody
One," arrived at Washington University in St.
Louis one day last week. The old, grey Grey

hound bus brought with it black and white
posters pushing its candidate and promises of
a political rally.
The posters advocated Nobody for presi
dent because: Nobody keeps campaign prom
ises, Nobody understands the economy.
Nobody will disarm nuclear weapons and
Nobody should have that much power.
At noon last Friday, the awaited rally
transpired. The extravaganza featured cam
paign rhetoric, rock and roll and Nobody's
visit.

Wavy Gravy, also known as Hugh Romney,
led the crowd through Nobody cheers. "Who
will balance the budget . . . Who will lower
your taxes?" he yelled to an audience that an
swered correctly each time.
Gravy, a self-described "psychedelic relic,"
guides the Berkeley-based campaign. Gravy
was also a member of Ken Kesey's Merry
Pranksters in the late 19605. The Merry
Pranksters were a group which hosted "acid
tests" — mass parties centered around the
then new drug LSD — as they toured the
West Coast in a multi-colored bus.
Nobody's supporters pay for the campaign
totally through donations since Nobody has
donated millions of dollars.

Labor theory of sperm
When Marx analyzed the contradictions in
herent in capitalist societies, he overlooked
one important one.
Students in capitalist societies face a di
lemma, Marx should have written. Work
study affords them no pleasure, but to enjoy
the pleasures available under capitalism, they
must acquire money.
Now, to the joy of the bourgeoisie, the Uni
versity of Michigan has eliminated that con
tradiction.
Earning money can be satisfying there,
where a headline in the campus paper re
ported that students can "get rich quick sell
ing sperm."
Students seeking pleasure in a society with
a free-market economy have two employers
to choose from. The university's lmmuno
fertility and Andrology Lab pays donors, who
can give twice a week, $15 per donation. A
nearby company pays $25 a sample if a donor
meets its standards.
The opportunities, available to only about
one-half the Michigan student body to begin
with, are limited. "The average person
screened cannot be used," said an employee
at the university lab.
The sperm, used for immunologic testing
and reproductive biology, must meet the lab's
criteria in terms of composition, sperm count,
color and volume, according to the Michigan
Daily.
They've got nothing to lose but their . . .
chains.
Learning to be free
Students at the University of Oregon who
will open their minds to teachers in faded or
ange robes with shaven heads may find
freedom from the monotonous routine of
campus life.
"We feel we have some education to give
young people as far as spiritual knowledge,"
Hare Krishna Vyasa Pada told the Oregon
Daily Emerald.
The group of Hare Krishnas who stopped at
the campus are traveling up the coast from
San Francisco to Seattle to spread the faith to
young people.

They found the atmosphere in Eugene, site
of the U. of O. campus, inviting and now plan
to "start a yoga club at the university and es
tablish a center in Eugene for devotees to live
and meet," writes the Emerald.
Some students will undoubtedly take up the
faith — look at the benefits.
"Hare Krishna devotees strive to live their
lives according to Krishna's doctrines. This
means a diet without meat, fish or eggs. In ad
dition, they must refrain from sex outside of
marriage, gambling and taking intoxicants
into the body ," reports the campus newspa
per. The last part may sound harsh, but the
diet would certainly free one from university
food service.
In addition, devotees would be free to live a
life outside the library since "another doctrine
involves prayer to Krishna through singing
and chanting." Librarians don't go for that.
Pada himself has obviously recognized
these benefits. "I saw that Krishna conscious
ness was a practical solution to my questions,"
Pada told the Emerald. "It(Krishna con
sciousness) has helped me to develop better
appreciation for the higher values of life."

Labor theory of sperm
When Marx analyzed the contradictions in
herent in capitalist societies, he overlooked
one important one.
Students in capitalist societies face a di
lemma, Marx should have written. Work
study affords them no pleasure, but to enjoy
the pleasures available under capitalism, they
must acquire money.
Now, to the joy of the bourgeoisie, the Uni
versity of Michigan has eliminated that con
tradiction.
Earning money can be satisfying there,
where a headline in the campus paper re
ported that students can "get rich quick sell
ing sperm."
Students seeking pleasure in a society with
a free-market economy have two employers
to choose from. The university's lmmuno
fertility and Andrology Lab pays donors, who
can give twice a week, $15 per donation. A
nearby company pays $25 a sample if a donor
meets its standards.
The opportunities, available to only about
one-half the Michigan student body to begin
with, are limited. "The average person
screened cannot be used," said an employee
at the university lab.
The sperm, used for immunologic testing
and reproductive biology, must meet the lab's
criteria in terms of composition, sperm count,
color and volume, according to the Michigan
Daily.
They've got nothing to lose but their . . .
chains.
Learning to be free
Students at the University of Oregon who
will open their minds to teachers in faded or
ange robes with shaven heads may find
freedom from the monotonous routine of
campus life.
"We feel we have some education to give
young people as far as spiritual knowledge,"
Hare Krishna Vyasa Pada told the Oregon
Daily Emerald.
The group of Hare Krishnas who stopped at
the campus are traveling up the coast from
San Francisco to Seattle to spread the faith to
young people.

They found the atmosphere in Eugene, site
of the U. of O. campus, inviting and now plan
to "start a yoga club at the university and es
tablish a center in Eugene for devotees to live
and meet," writes the Emerald.
Some students will undoubtedly take up the
faith — look at the benefits.
"Hare Krishna devotees strive to live their
lives according to Krishna's doctrines. This
means a diet without meat, fish or eggs. In ad
dition, they must refrain from sex outside of
marriage, gambling and taking intoxicants
into the body ," reports the campus newspa
per. The last part may sound harsh, but the
diet would certainly free one from university
food service.
In addition, devotees would be free to live a
life outside the library since "another doctrine
involves prayer to Krishna through singing
and chanting." Librarians don't go for that.
Pada himself has obviously recognized
these benefits. "I saw that Krishna conscious
ness was a practical solution to my questions,"
Pada told the Emerald. "It(Krishna con
sciousness) has helped me to develop better
appreciation for the higher values of life."




Stop that booth
Thursday, Oct. 18, 1:30 a.m. The Den
ser. Colo., Police Department receives a
call. Heading down University Avenue — a
four-lane artery that runs through the city —
is a Mountain Bell telephone booth.
Apparently, four members of Denver Uni
versity's Sigma Chi fraternity had decided
earlier in the day to snag a phone booth.
So, motivated by a few drinks and armed
with wire cutters and explosives — to separate
booth and anchor bolts— the students set out
to assault the victim in front of the university's
administration building.

All went smoothly, but the M-80 firecrack
ers used to dislodge the phone booth were a
little loud, and someone notified the authori
ties.
Meanwhile, the four loaded their phone
booth into a Safeway shopping cart and
started down University Avenue in the gen
eral direction of the Sigma Chi House.
But when the miscreants turned down the
side street leading home, they were surprised
to meet a squad car from the Denver Police
Department, Channel 4 News and Campus
Security.
The students all made a dash for it, and
three escaped. The one student caught was

charged with criminal mischief, but formal
charges were later dropped and the phone
booth returned.
Big game hunting
When the air turns crisp and the leaves fall
from the trees at Stanford, thoughts turn to
Big Game. At Washington State University,
autumn brings desires for a different sort of
big game.
It seems there's a bit of a stir at Washington
State over hunting. And while Stanford stu
dents this time of year are ready to go Bear
hunting, it seems Washington State students
are ready to go deer hunting.
An editorial in the Daily Evergreen states
its point clearly enough: "Hunting season is in
its second week now, and some of you are
probably dying to get away from the books
and out into that crisp autumn air. Hunting is
a good thing."
Hunting is tainted, the editorial says, by a
few bad apples who don't kill responsibly.
Meanwhile, Washington States' director of
Residence Living is offering a series of semi
nars on the joy of hunting. "The unfortunate
thing about hunting is taking an animal's life,"
the director said. "But there is much more to
the total experience than just killing. I like to
convey this to students."
The director shouid know what he's talking
about. He's hunted deer, Alaskan sheep and
Grizzly bears. But times are changing, and the
director finds his options limited. "Now I
can't hunt mountain sheep in Alaska in the
summer, but I can hunt Grizzly in the spring."
So when the Washington State Cougars
come down to Memorial Stadium in Berkeley
next month, Cal fans had better take seriously
any Washington State threats to kill the bears.
Vote for Nobody
In this year of less than desirable presiden
tial candidates, voting for nobody seems like
the best course.
And Nobody is exactly who the Nobody for
President Campaign is supporting as it moves
through 21 states this fall.
The campaign's special transport, "Nobody
One," arrived at Washington University in St.
Louis one day last week. The old, grey Grey

hound bus brought with it black and white
posters pushing its candidate and promises of
a political rally.
The posters advocated Nobody for presi
dent because: Nobody keeps campaign prom
ises, Nobody understands the economy.
Nobody will disarm nuclear weapons and
Nobody should have that much power.
At noon last Friday, the awaited rally
transpired. The extravaganza featured cam
paign rhetoric, rock and roll and Nobody's
visit.

Wavy Gravy, also known as Hugh Romney,
led the crowd through Nobody cheers. "Who
will balance the budget . . . Who will lower
your taxes?" he yelled to an audience that an
swered correctly each time.
