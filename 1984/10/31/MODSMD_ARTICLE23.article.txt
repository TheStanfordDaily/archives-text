# A 						little off the top at the shop with Roy

### TRASK LEONARD 
Students come, and students go. In
the last few decades, their political
leanings, social values, career ambi
tions, not to mention their dress and
hairstyles, have become almost
reliably cyclical.
Yet, for over 35 years, at least one
thing has remained the same: For a
good, old-fashioned haircut with a
special personal touch, students have
gone to Roy Ruiz at President Barber
Shop in Palo Alto.
"Roy is always there when I need
him," said Tom Roupe, who has been
going to President since a friend rec
ommended it last fall. "I can walk in
without an appointment, talk with the
guys and get a great cut for a
reasonable price."
Graduate student Ted Tuescher
also finds the quality of Ruiz's hair
cuts to be good.
"I had been to other, newer places
before I heard about Roy," explained
Tuescher. "But after coming out of
these places, I felt that I was given a
'fast-food' treatment. Roy, on the
other hand, adds his personal touch
and does you up right."
This personal aspect, perhaps more
than just being able to get a good
haircut, draws the Stanford crowd.
"You can go almost anywhere to
get a decent haircut," explained
sophomore Jon Mann. "But when I
walk into his (Ruiz's) shop, I get a
certain special feeling. It's a classic
barber shop, complete with Playboy
magazines, Stanford football posters
and the standard 'all-male' conversa
tion. I get the sense of being a part of
an extended family whenever I come
in to see Roy."
According to Mann, word of mouth
is the greatest attraction to President
Barber Shop.
"I started going to Roy after I had

heard all sorts of things about him
from the guys on the track team.
Then, after I went in and saw for
myself, I was hooked, and all my
friends got dragged in by me in a
similar manner," said Mann.
Ruiz has been cutting hair for a
living since he left the Air Force in
1948, and he's been at President
since 1960. He now co-owns the shop
with his brother Al, who cuts hair at
his other shop in Palo Alto.
"I started cutting hair with the
thought that I would only be doing it
for a while, until I found more per
manent work," Ruiz said. "But I
became so attached to the people and
the area that I kept at it. And here I
am today.
"It's still just a temporary job, you
know,"he joked. "My real ambition
in life is to become a Playboy photog
rapher."
Working beside Ruiz in the shop
are his brother-in-law Moe Sanchez
and nephew Carlos Ruiz. All three
commute from San Jose five days a
week. Mondays are "reserved for a
game of golf," according to Ruiz.
Over the years, Ruiz has cut the
hair of several notable Stanford ath
letes, including Bob Matthias, Paul
Wiggin, Jim Plunkett and John
Brodie. Jack McKittrick and Wayne
Erickson, two Stanford football
players from the late 19405, still come
in on a regular basis. Nowadays, most
of the men's track team goes to Presi
dent.
"Hairstyles sure have changed over
the years," explained Ruiz. "In the
'50s, I'd have guys coming in once a
week to keep their flat-tops or crew
cuts in form. The late '60s and '70s
were awful for us, since hardly
anyone ever cut Lhis] hair. Now, the
students are coming in very often to
keep their hair short."
