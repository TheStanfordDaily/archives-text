## Harmon not your 'typical' placekicker 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
Place kickers are often stereotyped
as flakes. They aren't a real part of
the team. They rarely practice with
the team but instead spend their af
ternoons at one corner of the field
kicking footballs off tees.
And placekickers are short, super
stitious guys who tie their shoes in
weird ways and never step on hash
marks. Guys who trot on the field
four or five times a game, do their
thing, and trot off.
But Stanford placekicker Mark
Harmon says he's different.
"I don't like to be in a type like,
He just goes on the field and kicks,
and then goes off the field and sits on
the bench,' " Harmon said. "I like to
consider myself part of the team."
Harmon also can consider himself
part of Stanford's record books. Bar
ring nuclear holocaust, the fifth-year
senior will be the Cardinal's all-time
leading scorer at the end of this
season.
Harmon, all 5-foot-9 and 183
pounds of him, is four points shy of
tying the career Stanford scoring
mark of 242 points set by running
back Darrin Nelson, who now plays
for the Minnesota Vikings.
Asked what his thoughts are just
days before the game — this Satur
day's against USC — in which the
record will probably fall, Harmon
simply replied, "1 don't want to think
about anything but the team win
ning."
Will he be nervous Saturday?
Probably not, Harmon said. "I have a
feeling if I kick four extra points (to
tie the record) and we get out there
again, somebody might say something
to me, but I'm not worrying about it."
However, things haven't always
been so good for Harmon, whose 47
career field goals are a Stanford
record. In fact, after Harmon statisti
cally regressed in his first three
seasons, he considered hanging up his
cleats and not returning as a fifth
year senior.
Harmon and Cardinal Coach Jack
Elway are happy he changed his
mind.

"After last year when the team
didn't do so well, and I had a horrible
year. I decided 1 wanted to go out a
winner," Harmon said. "I thought,
'Hey, come back and play with a win
ning team and improve on last
year." "
And improve he has. After hitting
85.7 percent of his field goals his first
year, he dropped to 70 percent in
1982 and to 55.6 percent last year. So
far this season, Harmon has made 11-
of-12 field goals (91.7 percent) and

18-of-19 extra points.
"1 couldn't tell you why 1 was mis
sing last year," he said. "A miss is a
miss, but last year it just seemed that
I was missing things that were so
close. This season, I haven't been
kicking too well in practice, but it's
been surprising how well I've kicked
in games."
Besides accuracy, Harmon has dis
tance as an asset. His 59-yarder in
1981 against Purdue tied him with
Rod Garcia for the longest field goal

in Stanford history. Harmon also has
field goals of 57, 53 and 50 yards this
season.
Harmon, who said he once kicked a
63-yarder in practice, prefers long
kicks to short ones because there is
less pressure. "A lot of the short kicks
are harder because 1 tend to be more
nervous," he said. "On the short
ones, the team drives all the way
down the field and expects you to
score."
Harmon, a four-year starter, never

had faced stiff competition for his job
until this August, when he and fresh
man David Sweeney were involved in
what Elway called a "placekicker
controversy."
"1 think competition is good for
everybody," Harmon said. "But 1 al
ways put more pressure on myself. I
always thought I had the job and it
was mine to lose."
Making 11-of-12 field goals and
18-of-19 extra points is one way to
keep your job.


Fifth-year senior kicker Mark Harmon says He decided he "wanted to
go out a winner" after last season, when he made 55.6 percent of his

Rod Searcey/Daily
field goal attempts. This season, Harmon has missed one field goal at
tempt and made 18 of 19 point-after-touchdowns.
