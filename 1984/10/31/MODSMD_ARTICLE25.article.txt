# Card field hockey team to play final regular-season game
## 
### DAVE DUTCHER Daily staff 
The Stanford field hockey team will play its final regular
.season game today against host University of California at
Berkeley, and then the Cardinal will sit back and wait.
Stanford Coach Onnie Killefer said she will learn Monday
whether the Cardinal (9-6) will receive a bid to play in the Na
tionul Collegiate Athlctic Association tournament, which is
scheduled to begin Nov. 9.
Stanford is ranked 16th in the nation in the latest NCAA poll.
Twelve teams will be chosen for the NCAA tournament.

One of those bids likely will go to San Jose State University,
which leads the Northern Pacific Conference. The Spartans, who
have defeated Stanford three times this year, have been ranked
11th all season.
If it wins the NorPac title, San Jose State will be going to the
NCAA playoffs for the third consecutive season as the first-place
team from the NorPac. In both 1982 and 1983, Cal finished
second and Stanford was third â€” and out of the playoffs. But the
Bears received at-large bids and went to the NCAA playoffs
both seasons.
The Cardinal has split its past four games with Cal, which is

ranked 20th, dating to last season. Stanford defeated the Bears,
5-1, at home Sept. 21, but lost two of three games to Cal in 1983.
In the Cardinal's 5-1 victory, two-time All-America forward
Patsy Huntington, a senior, scored three goals. Sophomore Andi
Wolpert and senior Jen Bleakley scored one apiece in that game.
The Bears used questionable strategy in their loss to the Car
dinal earlier this season. Cal put their best defensive player at
midfield, enabling Stanford to get several second shots.
The Cal player at midfield "couldn't move back to clear the
ball out, and we got a lot of rebound shots," Killefer said after
that NorPac victory, Stanford's first this season.
