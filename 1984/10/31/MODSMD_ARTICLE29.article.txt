# Top 2 in volleyball â€” Card, UCLA to play
## 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
The pressure never seems to end
for the Stanford women's volleyball
team, which will play another signifi
cant conference match tonight at
UCLA.
The Bruins are in second place in
the Western Collegiate Athletic As
sociation with an 8-2 record. The
Cardinal is half-a-game up in the
WCAA at 8-1.
Stanford defeated UCLA in three
games at home earlier this season,
and since then the Cardinal has won
conference matches over San Diego
State University, Cal State Fullerton
and USC to move into first place in
the WCAA. Stanford is also ranked
as the top women's volleyball team in
the country, and UCLA is ranked
second in the nation.
The Cardinal has played well since
the first UCLA match. "We weren't
practicing well at all leading up to
[the UCLA] game," Stanford Asst.
Coach Don Shaw said. "Since then,
we've had good practices and the
results have shown."
Stanford hopes its progress is not
tainted by the fact that tonight's
match is the first of five games on the
road. Although the Cardinal
strengthened its record in its recent
homestand, the home-court advan
tage will be missing in future games.
"[The game with UCLA] will be
another No. 1 vs. No. 2 match for
us," Shaw said. "But playing away is
a different story. If word gets out
about the meaning of the match, a lot
of people will be there from the L.A.
area."
Stanford not only expects a large
Bruin crowd, but an improved UCLA
squad. In the teams' first meeting,
UCLA playing was flawed with
several mental errors, especially
missed serves.
"[UCLA] didn't serve well," Shaw
said. "They were a little flat. I expect
them to do much better this time."

According to Cardinal setter Karen
Haserot, "[UCLA] tries to keep the
pressure on you (with its serves), and
if they miss, it's a great lift for us."
Shaw said Stanford's defense and
blocking will be important. "We're
not a team that normally stuffs the
block. We area block more, so it will
be important that our blocking
doesn't get in the way of our
defense."
According to Haserot, the Cardinal
has also been working on faster
transitions between offense and
defense.
"We've been trying to speed up our
transitions and move faster to our
spots. If we can speed everything up
on our side, [our opponent's] offense
will seem slow . . . and everything will
be that much easier for us to pick
up."
It will be a challenge to outrun
UCLA's offense. The Bruins are led
by 5-foot-8 hitter Liz Masakayon.
Her jumping ability not only makes
her a potent force at the net, but, as a
back-row player, she occasionally hits
from the 10-foot line.
UCLA's top middle blocker is
Merja Connolly, a 6-foot Ail-
American from Culver City. She has
been ill for much of this season but
recently began playing better. She
pulled a hamstring, however, in the
Bruins' match against Arizona State
University last weekend.
Another questionable player for
the Bruins is hitter Katie McGarrey.
She is second on the team in kills with
216 and leads UCLA in hitting
percentage at .335. Against Arizona
State, she pulled a neck muscle
during pre-game warmups.
Shaw said there would be a
"psychological aspect" in the game.
"[UCLA] can either be psyched out
(by its last match against the Car
dinal) or have revenge on their minds
... I don't know which will be the
case."
