# Panel eyes military funding
## 
### GREGORY WEINGARTEN Staff writer 
"Students have little idea of why the Department of
Defense (DoD) is funding their research at Stanford, and
how their research has to do with military needs," junior
Sam Rhoads, a member of the forum discussing military
funding for research here, told a small audience at Schiff
House last night.
The panel discussed the practical as well as ethical ap
pliction of DoD funding which is especially concentrated
in Applied Physics, Computer Science and Electrical En
gineering Departments. In the Department of Applied
Physics alone, the DoD alots $36,556 per student.
Applied Physics Prof. Robert Byer noted that the DoD
supplies "very nice, high quality," research grants, but
asserted that there are "no strings attached" to the funds.
Byer said the conditions placed on federal funding for
department research by the Stanford Commitee on Re
search and approved by the Faculty Senate ensure the
autonomy of the University's research. These conditions
include open and free inquiry into any field of research
without a criterion placed on "end use" of the study and
open discussion and publication of research results.
John Harris, engineer at the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC), characterized recent research
proposals submitted by the military as a "pernicious influ
ence" that threatens to turn SLAC into a "weapons labo
ratory."
According to Harris, these proposals include research
and development on technology that would be used for
nuclear weapons testing, and an X-ray laser that ties into

the "whole 'Star Wars' thing."
"The end use of that research is for a better way to
build a bomb. That's what you get when you read between
the lines of the research proposal. The University knows
damn well what it will be used for.
"When I started work at SLAC, I had no idea I might
be doing weapons-related research. The employees there
don't want that," Harris said.
Londa Schiebinger, professor of Values. Technology,
Science and Society, questioned the military funding from
a feminist perspective. She noted that a gender gap exists
in the military funding of research.
"Where military funding is high, the amount of women
are low," Schiebinger said. She cited the absence of
tenured female professors in the Department of Engi
neering, which she said receives a great deal of military
funding.
"Military funding serves to reinforce those values
ascribed to men" and "serves to reinforce domination of
men over women," she said.
Schiebinger also said the University is not promoting
freedom of inquiry by accepting military funding that
"sets priorities and expects results."
Joe Praxel, an engineering technician at the Stanford
Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory, said weapons re
search proposals have created a dilemma among
employees who do not want to be affiliated with the pro
duction of nuclear weapons but who want to continue
working at the research facility.
"People do not want to work for the cause of nuclear
weapons," Praxel said.
