### ERIK ESELIUS Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford women's soccer team
will try to boost its record over .500
for the first time this season tonight
against host Chico State.
The Cardinal (6-6) will play a
Chico team that has had its "ups and
downs," according to Stanford Head
Coach Helen Keohane.
"They will play a good team
tough," Keohane said, "then lose to
someone who isn't that good."
"Sonoma State, a good team, beat
them by only 1-0. They are an OK
team without any real outstanding
players — not an easy team to beat,"
she said.
Tonight's game will mark the first
time this season Stanford will play
under lights. Keohane said that
"could be a factor."

Keohane voiced concern about the
field at Chico State According to
scouting reports, the field has "lots of
bumps," Keohane said.
Going into tonight's game, Stan
ford has scored 24 goals and allowed
23. Sue Moore leads the Cardinal in
scoring with 10 goals. Amy Geisse
has three goals and is ranked second
on the Stanford team.
