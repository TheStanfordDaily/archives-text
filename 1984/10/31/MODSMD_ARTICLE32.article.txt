# Memorial service today for student
## 
### 
Friends of Thomas Apcl, the Stan
ford sophomore who died in
Yosemite National Park Sunday, will
hold a memorial service at 5 p.m.
today.
The group will meet at the bottom
of the path leading to The Dish and
walk to the top for an informal ser
vice.
Apel, 19, of Pasadena, was climb
ing with a friend from the University
of California at Berkeley. They were

branded on a peak near the top of
Upper Yosemite Falls at sunset with
out adequate clothing.
Apel's friend hiked to a ranger sta
tion for help in the morning, and
Apel was lifted in a sling from the cliff
by a helicopter rescue team. He was
pronounced dead on arrival at the
park clinic at 1 p.m.
Apel was a resident of Storey
House here.
