### 
Stanford and the University of Cal
ifornia at Berkeley lead the nation in
a new listing of "America's 100
brightest scientists under 40."
Eight scientists were named at each
of the two schools, followed by the
Massachusetts Institute of Technol
ogy with seven, Princeton with four
and the University of Chicago with
three. Listed with two scientists each
are Columbia, Cornell, Rockefeller,
Harvard, Yale and the University of
California at San Diego.
The listing of America's top young
scientists will be a special cover
feature in the December issue of Sci
ence Digest, a 600,000-circulation
popular science magazine. Editors
there said they set out "to take a
census, in effect, of the innovators,
the men and women who will truly
shape our tomorrows."
Listed at Stanford are Profs. Mark

Davis, microbiology; Corey Good
man, developmental neurobiology;
Roger Kornberg, biochemistry; Doug
Lenat, computer science; Sharon
Long, molecular biology; Brian Reid,
computer science; James Rothman,
biochemistry; and Pate Skene,
neurobiology.
A nominating group of 56 senior
scientists included four Nobel Prize
winners, directors of major research
laboratories and many of those
named in a listing of the top 20 U.S.
scientists published in Fortune maga
zine 30 years ago.
"America's top 100 young scien
tists have already made discoveries
that are changing the course of sci
ence and technology," the Science
Digest editors said of the 1984 group.
"The implications of their work
over the next decades will be more
profound than we can imagine."
