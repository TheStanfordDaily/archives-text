First the essentials. University
President Donald Kennedy will join
Daily staffers for a special lunch at
our offices today at noon. All
reporters should attend.
Edit hoard will meet at 2 p.m.
today. Steve.
Now the filler. Troy did it all last
night. He returned from Los Angeles
only to find us hours behind, and
when we really needed him, he was
there. He came through in the clutch.
Tim wasn't had, either.
This just in: Sandra says to write
that we're having a staff lunch today.
