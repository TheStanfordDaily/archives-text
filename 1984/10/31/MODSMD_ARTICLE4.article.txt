Proponents and opponents of Proposition 38 —
the controversial California ballot initiative de
signed to put an end to multilingual elections ma
terials — agree that they are fighting over an issue
of fairness.
But each side claims the other is being unfair.
Backers of the proposition say multilingual bal
lots and literature are unfair to English-speaking
Americans with immigrant ancestors. They say this
country's immigrant population was never afforded
a similar luxury during its struggles to adapt to a
new culture.
Opponents say reverting to English-only elec
tions material would cripple the 1965 federal
Voting Rights Act and effectively disenfranchise
hundreds of thousands of voters nationwide.
Proposition 38 requires Gov. George Deuk
mejian to deliver to the president, the U.S. attor
ney general and all members of Congress a letter
urging enactment of an amendment to the Voting
Rights Act. The amendment would stipulate that
ballots, voter information and elections pamphlets
be printed in English only.
A 1975 amendment to the Voting Rights Act re
quires counties to offer ballots in Hispanic, Asian-
American, American Indian and Alaskan lan
guages if more than 5 percent of that county s
voting population is native to one of these lan
guages.
Ten of California's 58 counties currently provide
elections material in at least one of these foreign
language groups.
Stanley Diamond, chairman of the California
Committee for Ballots in English, said that non-
English speaking sects have a "personal obligation

to learn the language of the country.
"Why should they be treated any differently than
our immigrant ancestors?" he asked. "Why should
they have ballots in their own language? Nobody
else ever did."
Diamond said that the government is offering
"disincentives to learning English" by providing
multilingual materials.
Diamond said his group supports the Voting
Rights Act, but opposes the 1975 amendment
mandating multilingual materials.
"We hope the impact (of Proposition 38) on
Congress will be sufficiently strong so we will have

a chance to delete those sections in the Voting
Rights Act," he said.
Opponents of the measure claim English-only
ballots prevent Hispanics, Asians and other
minorities from fulfilling their duty to vote as
citizens.
U.S. Congressman Don Edwards (D-San Jose), a
co-author of the argument against Proposition 38
in the California Elections Pamphlet, said his goal
is to include as many people as possible in the
voting process.
"We think it's in the public interest that people
who vote understand what they're voting about,"
Edwards said. "There's just no reason why we
shouldn't help people understand the material."
Edwards said he is not discouraging people from
learning English — he says" that's the only way you

can live a successful business and political life in the
United States" — but instead is seeking to encour
age political participation.
Proponents of the measure point to the fact that
any person who has earned the right to vote has
lived in this country at least five years and has
passed a basic English literacy test; thus, they say,
multilingual ballots are unnecessary.
But Edwards, a 22-year congressman and co
author of the Voting Rights Act, refutes the notion
that there is no need for the ballots.
He points to the federal laws that require im
migrants to have a fifth-grade level of English to be
naturalized. Edwards said this is insufficient be
cause "California ballots are so difficult to under
stand." Furthermore, many voters are citizens born
in the United States whose first language is not En
glish, he said.
Diamond said he doesn't accept that argument
because "the language in the public schools is En
glish."
David Ayon, a graduate student in political sci
ence and a program coordinator at El Centro
Chicano, agreed with Edwards. According to
Ayon, there are thousands of "people who are
citizens by birth whose primary language is
Spanish."
Ayon said he opposes the proposition not be
cause he favors the abstract concept of multilin
gualism. but because there is a practical need to of
fer elections material in Spanish as well as English.
"There's clearly a practical problem with an
abstract endorsement of multilingualism," Ayon
said. "But the case can be made for the practicality
of bilingual ism.
"In fact, it's on the grounds of practicality that I
think Spanish has a special status in this country,"
he said.
Ayon called the proposition "unnecessary,
provocative and backward.
"It is a blow against achieving the greatest possi-
