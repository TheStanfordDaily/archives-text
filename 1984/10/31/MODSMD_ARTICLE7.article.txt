Filipino police, marchers clash
MANILA, Philippines — Baton- and gun-wielding policemen yester
day used water hoses, smoke bombs and truncheons to disperse
hundreds ot supporters of slain opposition leader Benigno Aquino Jr.
The demonstration protested the conclusion of an official five-member
panel that exonerated President Ferdinand Marcos, whom protesters
believe had a hand in Aquino's murder.
I he estimated 2,000 marchers, mostly from the conservative business
sector, were following a major street in the top of the international fin
ancial district of Makati when they were attacked by police, who said
they had no permit to march.
A five-member commission that investigated Aquino's assasination
on Aug. 21, 1983 concluded that the slaying of the popular opposition
leader, who was Marcos' chief rival, routed from a military conspiracy.
But the commission voted 4-1 with the majority implicating Armed
Forces chief Gen. Fabian Ver, two other generals, 22 soldiers and a civil
ian.
The protesters said they believe that Marcos was included in the plot
because Ver, a known Marcos loyalist, could not have acted on his own
without orders from the president.
NRC accused of 'serious abuses'
WASHINGTON — In a bluntly worded attack, a dissident member of
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has accused his colleagues of
"serious abuses" of commission rules in their granting of an operating
license for the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant in California.
The NRC, "motivated solely by the objective of avoiding delay" in
licensing, failed to consider the "complicating effects of earthquakes" in
preparing emergency plans for Diablo Canyon, Commissioner James
Asselstine charged.
In a letter to Rep. Edward Markey (D-Mass.), chairman of a House
oversight committee, Asselstine said that because the NRC wanted to
move quickly, it ignored the need for hearings on the potential threat of
earthquake and fire at the plant.
But the four other NRC members believe strongly "there have been
no abuses" and "deny categorically" Asselstine's "speculation as to the
motives' behind the licensing, NRC Chairman Nunzio Palladino said in
a rebuttal contained in the same letter. A copy of the letter was made
available to the Los Angeles Times yesterday.
Study says wage gap closing
SANIA MONICA — The wage gap between working men and
women is rapidly closing and will be substantially reduced by the turn of
the century, according to a new Rand Corp. study to be released today.
The study, conducted by two male labor economists at the Santa
Monica think tank, concludes that the average hourly wage for working
women will be 75 percent of the average for working males by the year
2000, compared with 64 percent currently.
Further, the researchers conclude, the trend toward greater wage
parity — which they say has accelerated appreciably since 1980 — has
few roots in equal employment opportunity legislation enacted during
the 1960s and '70s. Instead, they conclude, it reflects historical shifts in
the work force dating to before World War 11.
The study was conducted by Rand economists James Smith and Mi
chael Ward under the auspices of the National Institute of Child Health
and Human Development. The institute became interested in the sub
ject because of declines in female fertility and American family size that
began well before 1920.
Smith and Ward used Census Bureau data dating from 1890 and other
statistical information to analyze trends in women's wages. They spent
nearly two years on the project, although each had previously done re
search in the field.
S&Ls warned against rapid growth
WASHINGTON — The chief regulator of the nation's savings and
loan industry, citing a threat to the insurance fund that backs their
deposits, warned S&Ls yesterday not to try to expand too rapidly or his
agency would rein them in.
Edwin Gray, Federal Home Loan Bank board chairman, speaking at a
convention of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, criticized what he
called the "go-go crowd, the daredevils, the high-flyers who dance on
the high wire, those who by their actions and their exceedingly fast
growth can only bring harm to the thrift system."
Instead of investing in housing. Gray said, "go-go thrifts" have been
financing such risky ventures as windmill farms, fast-food restaurants,
airlines and oil-drilling operations.
Gray's remarks reflected the concern federal regulators feel over the
growing number of failures of financial institutions and the impact on the
trust fund that insures their deposits. So far this year, 70 commercial
banks and 20 savings and loans have failed.
The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. has just over $6 billion
in its trust fund to insure $735 billion in deposits at S&Ls. But bank
board officials warn that the insurance fund could decline by $1 billion
this year, the first drop since it was established a half century ago.
New nations near nuclear arms
WASHINGTON — Libyan strongman Moammar Khadafy could be
on the way to owning a nuclear bomb without even having to test it, and
other nations also may be taking shortcuts to membership in the nuclear
club, a new global survey on the proliferation of nuclear weapons re
ported yesterday.
In the report by the Carnegie Endowment for Peace, author Leonard
Spector listed eight nations as "emerging" nuclear powers: not only the
three earliest contenders, India, Israel and South Africa, but also Libya,
Pakistan, Iraq, Argentina and Brazil.
Nearly all of these nations took steps toward building or expanding
their nuclear weapons capability in the past year, Spector said. Particu
larly troubling, he said, is the indication that Pakistan's incipient nuclear
role may heighten the threat of war between that nation and its tradi
tional enemy, India.
At a news conference, Spector stressed that the threat of nuclear
proliferation now is posed primarily by covert black-market or "gray
market trafficking, rather than by government-to-government transfers
of nuclear fuel or technology.
Moreover, key data that were formerly obtainable only through test
ing now can be determined by computer analysis, he said. Thus, he
declared, any of these "emerging" nuclear powers could possess a bomb
without having to test it.
240 Soviets believed dead in crash
NEW DELHI, India — About 240 Soviet soldiers are believed to
have died when a Soviet plane crashed on the outskirts of the Afghan
capital Kabul on Sunday, Western diplomatic sources said here yester
day.
Although details of the incident were sketchy, the sources said the
aircraft crashed shortly after take-off from Kabul airport. The troops
were returning to the Soviet Union after duty in Afghanistan.
According to one report the aircraft may have been hit by a missile
fired by Afghan resistance fighters, who have kept up a constant barrage
of rocket attacks on Kabul during the last few weeks.
But the sources said the aircraft might have been involved in a mid-air
collision with another plane carrying young Afghans to the Soviet
Union.
The diplomats also reported the downing of two Soviet helicopters
over Kabul on Oct. 25. One helicopter reportedly disintegrated over the
Ministry of Defense building, apparently after being hit over the Logar
Valley, north of the capital.
Interest rates spark stock rally
NEW YORK — Stock prices staged a spirited rally yesterday, getting
a boost from falling open-market interest rates.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had fallen 24.52
points over the past six sessions, rebounded 15.90 to 1,217.31.
Today's weather
Mostly fair today after morning fog and low clouds. Highs in the upper
50s and 60s.
