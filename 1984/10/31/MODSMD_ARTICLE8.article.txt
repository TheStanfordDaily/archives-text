WARSAW, Poland â€” Divers
found the body yesterday of mur
dered dissident Polish priest Jerzy
Popieluszko, 37, kidnapped Oct. 19
by three interior ministry members.
An interior ministry statement
broadcast by Polish television yester
day evening said the body was
recovered in the afternoon from a
reservoir near the northern Polish
town Wloclawek.
The body was taken to medical ex
aminers for an autopsy. Authorities
are in contact with the country's
church leaders, the statement added.
An investigation into who
"inspired the kidnapping and the
murder" was under way on the order
of Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw
Kiszczak.
Popieluszko, an outspoken sup
porter of the banned Solidarity move
ment, was abducted near the city of

Torun in northern Poland. From the
start there were fears for his life.
The leader of the accused kidnap
pers is a captain in the Polish security
police, Grzegorz Piotrowski, accord
ing to official statements. He headed
a department in the interior ministry.
The two other accused kidnappers
were lieutenants under him.
A few hours before the official con
firmation of the killing, government
spokesman Jerzy Urban said inves
tigations were being made into all
contacts of Piotrowski's in the hope
of finding a clue to possible initiators
of the crime.
Since the latter might be in the se
curity apparatus, the three kidnap
pers were being held in a jail under
special protection.
Piotrowski had withdrawn an ear
lier statement saying that he had him
splf killed the priest. He subsequently

claimed to have thrown Popieluszko
into a river "in a state in which he had
a chance to survive."
His two alleged accomplices were
said to have admitted, however, to
sinking the body in the reservoir.
Urban also told a press conference
that police were following up infor
mation from a senior churchman that
the kidnappers had sent an
anonymous letter to the Roman
Catholic Church demanding a big
ransom.
People flocked to the dead priest's
own parish church of Saint Stanislaw
here after hearing the news. Many
carried burning candles.
Within a short time some 1,000
people had gathered at the church.
Some were in tears.
A priest who just before had been
conducting a mass for Popieluszko's

safety announced the news of his
death to the congregation.
Late yesterday, Solidarity founder
Lech Walesa called for calm. In a
statement from his Gdansk home,
Walesa said "avoid demonstrations,
rioting and other tensions in these
days."
He urged the "silence of mourning
in the whole of Poland, but let it he
the silence of hope."
He expressed the wish that mourn
ing would "create the possibility to
start a dialogue. We shall meet, all of
us, at the funeral."
He said, "I call on all . . . respon
sible organizations, on the authorities
and on the underground structures"
of the banned Solidarity trade union
movement to take part in the
dialogue.
