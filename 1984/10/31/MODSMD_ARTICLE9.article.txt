# Police kill at least two
## Chilean strike leads to violence 
### 
SANTIAGO, Chile â€” At least two people were
killed by police in violent incidents during a general
strike against Chile's military government yester
day that seriously disrupted work in this capital.
With barricades of burning automobile tires in
shantytowns and gangs of rock-throwing
demonstrators roaming deserted streets, the auth
orities imposed a curfew from 10 p.m. yesterday to
5 a.m. today.
As in other days of protest against the regime of
President Augusto Pinochet, the actions of uni
formed police and agents of the intelligence
services led to the deaths.
A 23 year-old-man was killed by police gunfire
on a main street in the San Miguel district, a
working-class section of this capital. Another man
was killed when police opened fire on
demonstrators in the La Capilla shantytown.
Eight plainclothes agents, some wearing masks,
raided the offices of the Popular Democratic
Movement, a Marxist group, that supported the
strike. They held 28 persons at gunpoint while they
ransacked the offices, removed files and office
equipment, and scrawled anti-Communist slogans
on the wall, according to witnesses.
This was the first attempt by Chile's labor
sition to organize a general strike in a combined
demand for wage increases, more jobs and political
reforms that would restore an elected government
after 11 years of authoritarian military rule under
Pinochet.
Paralyzation of bus transportation here and in
other major cities disrupted the main form of
public transport and kept many workers from
reaching factories, government offices and com
mercial centers. Schools closed when both students
and teachers joined the strike.
Two young national labor leaders who head the
National Workers Command, Manuel Bustos, a
textile worker, and Rodolfo Seguel, a copper

worker, called the strike.
"Chile has said enough to 11 years of abuses and
violence. If the armed forces don't recognize this,
they run the risk of facing a generalized rebellion,"
Bustos said at a press conference.
In addition to the two dead from gunfire, two
other people died from electrocution when a
power line fell after an explosion damaged a trans
mission tower. Hospitals said that 15 other people
had been admitted with gunshot wounds.
Sergio Poblete, a Chilean factory worker, tried to
go to work yesterday but was stranded along with
tens of thousands of others.
"I support the strike as a protest against this gov
ernment, but I am not a fool. I can't risk losing my
job," said Poblete, standing on a street corner with
dozens of other workers waiting for a bus that did
not come.
The scene on San Pablo Avenue, in the working
class neighborhood of Pudahuel, was repeated all
over this capital of nearly 4 million people. Many
workers walked miles or rode bicycles to get to
their factories, offices or shops and punch in their
presence on time cards, even if they arrived late.
Although armed police and army troops
patrolled the main streets and stood guard at rail
road and subway stations, the military government
was unable to fulfill its promise to guarantee public
transportation.
Among the few buses that were on the streets
early in the morning, many came to a halt midway
on their routes when their tires were punctured by
nails, twisted into spikes like children's jacks, that
were scattered by strike activists on the streets.
Some big factories, like the Goodyear Tire plant
in the Cerrillos industrial belt, provided private
buses. Most of Goodyear's 350 workers arrived for
the morning shift. The company also announced it
was granting a 22 percent wage increase demanded
by the union last month.

By mid-morning most banks were operating with
reduced staffs. Government offices were all open,
but long lines formed as people tried to pay tele
phony, electric and water bills due yesterday.
The strike was not supported by the Democratic
Workers Union, an anti-Marxist group led by
Eduardo Rios, president of the maritime workers
union, and other leaders who have longstanding
ties with the American AFL-CIO labor movement.
Rios, a moderate Christian Democrats, said Sun
day that his group could not back a strike that
would not have wide backing from the workers and
would lead to violence and military repression of
the opposition labor unions.
Although the copper workers union, the most
powerful labor force in Chile, backed the strike,
there was no work stoppage in the big state mines,
which were under military control yesterday.
Troops patrolled the streets of Iquique and other
big copper ports in northern Chile.
The labor militants said, however, the extent of
the stoppage in industries here showed that "the
majority of workers want clear, decisive action
against the dictatorship."
"The political parties have to understand that
this government only gives ground to worker's
demands when there is social mobilization," Bustos
said.
The strike was called in demand for a minimum
wage for all workers of 12,000 pesos (equivalent to
$100) a month. The strike leadership also
demanded government measures to reactivate the
Chilean economy, where production has dropped
20 percent since 1982, when a major recession
took hold. Unemployment now stands at about 30
percent of the labor force.
