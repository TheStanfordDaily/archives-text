After eight months, the union battle is finally
over.
Tuesday night, Stanford workers approved
Local 680 as their collective bargaining represen
tative. According to Local 680 President Linda
Crouse, the victory is "a direct repudiation of
(University President) Donald Kennedy's union
busting tactics."
Crouse's confrontational attitude may have
been inspired by the excitement of a hard-fought
battle finally won, but it is not the way to begin
reconciliation with the University. And reconcili- '
ation, on both sides, must occur.
Both sides fought hard. The University's
"Stanford Alternative" campaign criticized Local
680's record and the union's current leadership.
Some may say that Crouse and the United Stan

ford Workers have a legitimate claim to celebrate
their success. But the election is only the first
step.
The union will be as effective as its bargaining
relationship with the University allows.
The union can be effective only by putting
aside personality conflicts and sitting down at
the bargaining table.
And according to Kennedy, the University is
ready to begin.
"We're going to bargain in good faith and be
cheerful about it," he said yesterday. "We're not
going to file any kind of objections at all."
We applaud Kennedy's decision to accept the
results of the election, and we hope the election
results become official in as few as five days, as
USW Counsel Jim Eggleston predicted.
