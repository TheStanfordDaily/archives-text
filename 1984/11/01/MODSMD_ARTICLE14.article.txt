## Gay bathhouse ban will fail 
### 
Tuesday, Oct. 30, 1984 marks the court-order
date for the permanent closure of San Francisco's
gay bathouses. The closure is intended to check the
spread of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome
(AIDS). In the light of historical precedence, I
think it is doubtful that the intended effect will be
achieved. In the early part of this century, cities all

VIEWPOINT

across the United States closed down brothels in an
attempt to check the spread of veneral disease. The
rationale was that VD was spread by prostitutes
and that closing down the brothels would end pros
titution and. with it, VD. Obviously, the plan
failed. The result, rather than a decrease, was an in
crease in the incidence of VD, resulting from a
sharp increase in the amount of street prostitution.
The point is that the prostitutes, shut out of their
brothels, did not take up other lines of work.
Shutting down the gay bathhouses will not end
those particular sexual activities that have been
linked to the transmission of AIDS. Instead, as was
the case with the brothels, closing the bathhouses
will only result in relocating the activity from the
private to the public arena.
Studies have shown that street prostitutes sustain
a much higher percentage of VD than do those wo
men who work in regulated brothels in Nevada.
Brothels provide a forum for the dissemination of
health education, opportunity for regular health
check-ups for both prostitutes and clients and the
time and place for cleanliness and caution. Pushing
the prostitutes out onto the streets cuts off these
opportunities. The gay bathhouses likewise provide
a means for educating people about safe sex
practices, distribution of condoms, hygiene and the
time for men to talk to each other and act respon
sibly. Another thing that the bathhouses provide,
which would be very helpful in stopping the spread
of disease, is the feasibility of recordkeeping, so
that in the event of diagnosed cases of sexually

transmitted diseases, it would be possible to notify
people who may have been exposed.
A somewhat less tangible, but probably more im
portant, effect has to do with people's attitudes
toward sex. In the case of gay bathhouses, one of
the very reasons that they exist at all has to do with
' this society's attitudes toward homosexuality. Some
of the people who frequent bathhouses do so be
cause they are so closeted in their homosexuality
that they are afraid to go to the slightly more public
places such as gay bars. There is very little risk of
running into a straight person who knows you in a
bathhouse. These men are not going to stop having
sex. They are not suddenly going to get the courage
to go to more "acceptable" gay gathering places.
They are simply going to relocate their sexual
encounters to the parks and bathrooms, where the
need for furtiveness will certainly prohibit respon
sible actions and where they will be out of reach of
health education campaigns.
Since at this stage of the game there is very little
we can do to have an immediate effect on attitudes,
it makes a lot of sense to preserve those places
where those who most need to know can be ed
ucated about AIDS, and to provide the amenities
necessary for safe sex practices. Closing down the
bathhouses simply adds to the furtiveness and
shame that haunt sexual encounters and discourage
responsible behavior.
It's instructive to note that since the dimensions
of the AIDS epidemic became known and educa
tional efforts were made both in the bathhouses
and in the gay community at large, the incidence of
rectal gonorrhea in San Francisco has decreased by
more than 50 percent. Facts like these indicate to
me that the gay community has reacted in a sane
and responsible manner to the danger of AIDS and
that media horror stories of doctors raiding the
bathhouses and finding their own AIDS patients
there are not representative of the situation as a
whole. Reports from men who do frequent the
baths indicate that the media image of a negligent
and reckless group who can't be trusted to behave

responsibly is just false.
If the authorities are really worried about people
not having enough sense to make responsible
choices about risks, why have we not seen alcohol
and tobacco outlawed? The use of these is clearly
unhealthy and, witness the dangers of drunk
driving and second-hand smoke, endangers those
who do behave responsibly as well. The difference
between prohibiting alcohol and tobacco and
closing the gay bathhouses is that in the latter case,
there is a certain righteousness about trying to
prohibit what is not only perceived to be unhealthy
but also immoral.
Obviously a society which has not yet come so far
as to accept long-term, monogamous gay relation
ships as normal is not ready to look objectively at
the multiple-partners/anonymous gay sex that is
going on in the bathhouses. The authorities who
are closing the bathhouses are surely aware of the
fact that AIDS is transmitted by certain sexual ac
tivities, not by the buildings in which they take
place. They are surely aware of the lessons of the
outlawing of prostitution and its effect on the in
cidence of VD. This indicates to me that the real
driving force behind the bathhouse closure is not
health concerns, but morality.
If what we have here is an attempt to outlaw
sexual behavior that is perceived to be immoral by
a group with the power to do so, then everybody,
not just those who go to bathhouses, should be con
cerned. Such a move is clearly an infringement of
civil liberties and should be vehemently protested
by all who value those liberties. Realizing that the
closing of the bathhouses sets a dangerous prece
dent, the American Civil Liberties Union has
already registered its opposition. When morality
begins to be legislated, then civil liberties fall prey
to the vagaries of whatever moral codes are held by
those in power.
