A farewell to arms
The recent viewpoint "The impli
cations of bomber development"
(The Daily, Oct. 29) was a welcome
bit of rationality amid the paranoia
and confusion that surround the
arms-control debate. The authors did
not, however, point out one potential
change in our nuclear policy that
could make us much safer. This
change would be to remove all our
land-based missiles. The reason for
this is simple: If the Soviets'
suspicion of us ever leads them to

launch a pre-emptive first strike, it is
obvious they would try to knock out
our retaliatory capability. As long as
a large part of our retaliatory force is
based on land, rather than in sub
marines at sea,these land-based
missiles are simply tempting targets
for a strike on our homeland.

It just ain't so
Upon reading the most recent

litany of hysterical and inaccurate
anti-Reagan propaganda in The
Daily ("Reagan? Thank you, no,"
Oct. 30), I felt compelled to respond.
Reflecting further before acting,
however, I came to a conclusion:
Though I might shed light on a few
of the more misleading and fallacious
assertions concerning our president
put forth in recent days by that
renowned group of savants euphe
mistically refered to as the editor
ial board of The Daily, I could not
realistically hope to respond to even
a significant fraction of the ground

less charges in so brief a space as an
editorial letter allows. So, 1 finally
resolved, why not let The Daily and
those who share its views have their
moment in the sun, for in less than a
week's time, the American people
will have repudiated both their can
didate and the archaic principles
upon which his candidacy is based,
and President Reagan, with a fresh
mandate from the public, will be
preparing to enter his second term in
office.
