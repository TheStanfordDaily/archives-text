## Hope for a peaceful solution 
### 
Although we were faced with loads of work and
impending midterms, we really had to go see
Charlie Clements. As the author of "Witness to
War: An American Doctor in El Salvador," Cle
ments had managed to revive in many of us our
latent concern for that tormented country, even
before he got here; devoted as we are to our
studies, that is no small feat. Speaking at Terman
Friday, Clements duly rewarded the time we spent
listening to him. You can see more hope for the
world when you see and hear a real live person,
who risked so much to undertake a medical mission
to such a beleaguered country, describing his story
in front of a capacity crowd, right before your eyes.
Charlie Clements was the pilot of a C-130
transport during the Vietnam War. After Hying 50
missions (the same number that was supposed to
get Yossarian out of his war in "Catch-22," before
they kept pushing the numbers up), Clements
became disenchanted with the war and requested a
discharge. He was declared insane and stuck in a
mental institution, but after a while they let him out
anyway. Back in the states, Clements entered
medical school and emerged as a doctor.
While working at a hospital in Salinas, he began
to see firsthand the horrors of civil war in Central
America. A young child with his face slashed, a wo
man with a breast lopped off by a machete, all dem
onstrated that civilians were bearing the brunt of
this war.
As in Vietnam. Clements began to question our
role in the region — and the necessity of war in
general. In keeping with his developing beliefs in
non-violence, Clements had become a Quaker, a
member of a faith which places great importance
on the principle of "bearing witness" to injustice in
the world. And it was in accordance with this prin
ciple that Clements finally made the decision to go
down and see what was happening in El Salvador.

He worked as the only doctor for the FMLN in the
rebel-controlled Guazapa volcano region for one
year, only 20 miles from the capital city of San Sal
vador. He snuck in, and so avoided the fate of an
other American, a young man on vacation irom
college during Christmas. The young man was
dragged off a bus, tortured and murdered at a gov
ernment checkpoint for the contraband Alka
Seltzer in his backpack. He was wearing blue jeans;
and blue jeans, as everyone in EI Salvador knows,
are the unofficial uniform of the FMLN.
Many would disagree with the direction of Cle
ments' sympathies at this point. After all, his aiding
of the rebels suggests tacit approval of their ends.
The means they are using to attain those ends are
violent. How is his support for the rebels consistent
with his beliefs in non-violence?
Clements had to follow his faith to its logical con
clusion. He felt he must bear witness to the origins
of the injustice he saw confronting him in that
Salinas hospital, injustice that had become
grotesquely familiar to him 10 years before in Viet
nam. By going down to help the rebels, who he felt
were more responsive to the needs of the mass ot
suffering people, he would be addressing the in
justice by witnessing the war itself. And by refusing
to pick up a gun, he would not be contributing to
the violence.
Clements' visit was more than merely in
formative; it was also appropriately timed. The day
before his talk. The Washington Post had quoted a
high Pentagon official as saying that the U.S. armed
forces planned to hold maneuvers with the Sal
vadoran army early next year. The Pentagon
promptly denied this. Clements maintains that this
is a common tactic — called "desensitization" — of
the powers that be. The public is first set on edge
about a particularly worrisome topic like these
maneuvers, and then reassured that it won't hap

pen. But then, should the maneuvers actually be
undertaken, we won't be very quick to protest it.
We thought that it was settled a long time ago, after
all. It keeps cropping up; there really doesn't seem
to be anyway to stop it.
Neither Clements nor I feel such "maneuvers"
could be in our interest; after all, how smart could
it be to hold war games in a country already torn by
civil war? Such a move would probably be a pretext
for occupation, and occupation, as we should have
learned by now, has done no one any good since
World War 11. Clements urges us to convince our
leaders that any such action would be highly un
popular. Making any effort at all to prevent the
chain of events that led us into Vietnam from
beginning again can't help but help.
So in these days, when collective action is
(temporarily) a matter of hypothetical discourse, it
is good to take time out from our studies to hear
men like Clements speak. Meeting someone with a
deep faith in anything can often be an alienating
experience. After all, differences of opinion aside,
deep faith is unsettling to the unsure. But Clements
came off as neither a finger-pointer nor a threaten
ing dogmatist. As such, his message is readily ac
cessible; in fact, he reassures by example. Charlie
Clements provides us with the hope that one per
son can help,
that we will pay attention to those who seek an
alternative to fear and worry, and help ease our
own,
that we will listen to the peacekeepers and
reawaken,
open our eyes,
and bear witness to both the complex horror of
war and the hopeful possibility of peace in our
world.

experience. After all, differences of opinion aside,
deep faith is unsettling to the unsure. But Clements
came off as neither a finger-pointer nor a threaten
ing dogmatist. As such, his message is readily ac
cessible; in fact, he reassures by example. Charlie
Clements provides us with the hope that one per
son can help,
that we will pay attention to those who seek an
alternative to fear and worry, and help ease our
own,
that we will listen to the peacekeepers and
reawaken,
open our eyes,
and bear witness to both the complex horror of
war and the hopeful possibility of peace in our
world.

Although we were faced with loads of work and
impending midterms, we really had to go see
Charlie Clements. As the author of "Witness to
War: An American Doctor in El Salvador," Cle
ments had managed to revive in many of us our
latent concern for that tormented country, even
before he got here; devoted as we are to our
studies, that is no small feat. Speaking at Terman
Friday, Clements duly rewarded the time we spent
listening to him. You can see more hope for the
world when you see and hear a real live person,
who risked so much to undertake a medical mission
to such a beleaguered country, describing his story
in front of a capacity crowd, right before your eyes.
Charlie Clements was the pilot of a C-130
transport during the Vietnam War. After Hying 50
missions (the same number that was supposed to
get Yossarian out of his war in "Catch-22," before
they kept pushing the numbers up), Clements
became disenchanted with the war and requested a
discharge. He was declared insane and stuck in a
mental institution, but after a while they let him out
anyway. Back in the states, Clements entered
medical school and emerged as a doctor.
While working at a hospital in Salinas, he began
to see firsthand the horrors of civil war in Central
America. A young child with his face slashed, a wo
man with a breast lopped off by a machete, all dem
onstrated that civilians were bearing the brunt of
this war.
As in Vietnam. Clements began to question our
role in the region — and the necessity of war in
general. In keeping with his developing beliefs in
non-violence, Clements had become a Quaker, a
member of a faith which places great importance
on the principle of "bearing witness" to injustice in
the world. And it was in accordance with this prin
ciple that Clements finally made the decision to go
down and see what was happening in El Salvador.

He worked as the only doctor for the FMLN in the
rebel-controlled Guazapa volcano region for one
year, only 20 miles from the capital city of San Sal
vador. He snuck in, and so avoided the fate of an
other American, a young man on vacation irom
college during Christmas. The young man was
dragged off a bus, tortured and murdered at a gov
ernment checkpoint for the contraband Alka
Seltzer in his backpack. He was wearing blue jeans;
and blue jeans, as everyone in EI Salvador knows,
are the unofficial uniform of the FMLN.
Many would disagree with the direction of Cle
ments' sympathies at this point. After all, his aiding
of the rebels suggests tacit approval of their ends.
The means they are using to attain those ends are
violent. How is his support for the rebels consistent
with his beliefs in non-violence?
Clements had to follow his faith to its logical con
clusion. He felt he must bear witness to the origins
of the injustice he saw confronting him in that
Salinas hospital, injustice that had become
grotesquely familiar to him 10 years before in Viet
nam. By going down to help the rebels, who he felt
were more responsive to the needs of the mass ot
suffering people, he would be addressing the in
justice by witnessing the war itself. And by refusing
to pick up a gun, he would not be contributing to
the violence.
Clements' visit was more than merely in
formative; it was also appropriately timed. The day
before his talk. The Washington Post had quoted a
high Pentagon official as saying that the U.S. armed
forces planned to hold maneuvers with the Sal
vadoran army early next year. The Pentagon
promptly denied this. Clements maintains that this
is a common tactic — called "desensitization" — of
the powers that be. The public is first set on edge
about a particularly worrisome topic like these
maneuvers, and then reassured that it won't hap

pen. But then, should the maneuvers actually be
undertaken, we won't be very quick to protest it.
We thought that it was settled a long time ago, after
all. It keeps cropping up; there really doesn't seem
to be anyway to stop it.
Neither Clements nor I feel such "maneuvers"
could be in our interest; after all, how smart could
it be to hold war games in a country already torn by
civil war? Such a move would probably be a pretext
for occupation, and occupation, as we should have
learned by now, has done no one any good since
World War 11. Clements urges us to convince our
leaders that any such action would be highly un
popular. Making any effort at all to prevent the
chain of events that led us into Vietnam from
beginning again can't help but help.
So in these days, when collective action is
(temporarily) a matter of hypothetical discourse, it
is good to take time out from our studies to hear
men like Clements speak. Meeting someone with a
deep faith in anything can often be an alienating
experience. After all, differences of opinion aside,
deep faith is unsettling to the unsure. But Clements
came off as neither a finger-pointer nor a threaten
ing dogmatist. As such, his message is readily ac
