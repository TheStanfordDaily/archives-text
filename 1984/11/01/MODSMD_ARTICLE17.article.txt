## Plant moleheads beneath our cities 
### 
WESTGULLEY, Wash. — Politi
cal leaders in the United States and
the Soviet Union today agreed on the
first steps toward placement of the
revolutionary "Mole" type warheads

VIEWPOINT

beneath every major city of both
countries. If implemented, this plan
means that in the event of a future
nuclear crisis the aggressing nation
will simply detonate the bombs
beneath its own populous areas in
retaliation to its own attack.
Theoretically, this will give leaders of
the attacked nation the signal that
they have been launched upon and
they will respond by exploding their
own nuclear warheads and destroying
their own major cities. State Depart
ment officials say that this new plan is
"almost a certainty" and that the only
details remaining to be worked out
are those concerning methods of sur
veillance. Initially, both countries will
need a means to remain certain that
the warheads are only planted
beneath cities with more than 10,000
inhabitants. Said one State Depart
ment official who asked not to be
identified, "Surveillance is the key to
the 'Mole' project. Putting warheads
beneath isolated military installations
or smaller civilian concentrations
would be a flagrant violation of the
tentative treaty conditions. Of course
either country could attempt to gain
nuclear superiority by mining as
many of its smaller towns and military
installations as possible if sufficient
surveillance techniques could not be
found."
The administration contends that
the ramifications of the "Mole" proj
ect would be almost purely economic
and strategic. Military experts agree
that it would reduce impact time by
five to seven minutes. This would al
low simultaneous first strike and
detonation and would completely
eliminate any possibility of dangerous
new "destabilizing" technology. Be
cause the new non-mobile warheads
would render nuclear weapons with
any sort of distance-strike capability
obsolete, a completely new stockpile
of warheads would have to be
produced, both from scratch and by
modifying some existing missiles.

Retired Maj. Gen. Cruger, a long
time insider, predicted yesterday at a
press conference here in Westgulley
thai "the possible deflationary aspect
of associated economic facteria would
facilitate possible production of non
auto-mobile poly-megaton warheads
in areas of little or no real economic
activity."
Pentagon projections show that be
cause the "Moleheads" are less ex
pensive, it may soon be feasible to
extend the treaty to include towns
with as few as 700 or even 500 in
habitants.
In a recent press conference on the
subject, the president pointed out
that the only real problem with the
project would be finding a satisfac
tory defense. Said the president,
"Defense? Well, we have boys at
Film Magic working on that one."
On the world scene today the inter
national community deplored the
proposed move, charging that it

. . . the Soviet
Union would
retaliate by
completely an
nihilating the
U.S.S.R.

would remove the possibility of other
countries ever gaining serious nuclear
leverage. But the administration has
responded by saying that the danger
is just as real as ever that "some
fanatic might get a hold of a nuclear
weapon and detonate it under his
own capital," thus precipitating an in
ternational nuclear incident. The offi
cial Soviet news agency Tass has let it
be known that if any nuclear warhead
were to be exploded in any national
capital, the Soviet Union would
retaliate by first destroying Moscow
and then completely annihilating the
U.S.S.R.
The administration has dubbed the
new program "The Home Saver."
