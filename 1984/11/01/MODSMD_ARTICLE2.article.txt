# Drinking survey puts RAs in limbo
## 
### BAIE NETZER Senior staff writer 
Faced with strong objections over an alcohol
abuse report form, the Office of Residential
Education is now attempting to salvage a survey
through meetings with campus resident assis
tants.
Distributed at the beginning of the year, the
forms require RAs to report alcohol-abuse inci
dents in which students are ''mildly intox
icated," "intoxicated" or "very intoxicated"
within their houses. RAs have complained that
the survey questions are too specific and un
dermine their relationship with fellow residents.
Diana Conklin, assistant dean of Residental
Education and director of the Row, said she is
withholding the forms until meeting with the
RAs on the Row.
"It seemed to me it was very possible the
forms might cause some anxiety," Conklin said.
"I'm holding them because I think it is some
thing we should discuss first."
Conklin sent a memo along with a copy of the
form to each RA on the Row, informing them
that she was holding the forms and would like to
meet with them to discuss them.
The Row RAs are scheduled to discuss the
survey with Conklin at their next staff meeting a
week from today.
Steve Leonhardt, a Phi Delta Theta RA, said
there was "a big communication problem" in
the way the survey was presented to RAs.
"It's all come up in a tremendous atmosphere
of distrust, and Res Ed hasn't done a lot in
avoiding those feelings," Leonhardt said. RAs
should be able to report an incident while still
keeping the house in which it occurred con
fidential, he said.
"I think Res Ed should try to make it clear
exactly what they're after," Leonhardt said.
"The focus should be on incidents that RAs are

concerned about, not on every time someone
has a bottle of beer in the hall."
Sigma Chi Omega RA Dave Mackay also said
he would not report every incident the survey
form asks for since it might lead to a "stilted
view of the level of drinking in the house."
Mackay said the report seemed to suggest
reporting an incident everytime someone has
two or three drinks.
"People have beer for dinner, and if I have to
report every time someone has two or three
drinks, I'd be reporting continuously," Mackay
said.
"I'm not going to actively seek out every mild
intoxication and fill out a detailed report on it,"
he said. "But if a case of alcohol abuse isn't han
dled properly, then I'd definitely report it."
Alice Supton, the associate dean for Residen
tial Education, said that Res Ed is now meeting
with RAs "to find ways that they feel com
fortable in providing the information."
Supton stressed that the Res Ed survey was
intended to find out the frequency of alcohol
related incidents and the extent of alcohol abuse
that occurs.
"We understand the interest in protecting the
names of individuals, and we're not really inter
ested" in getting those names, Supton said.
Supton said a number of RAs expressed con
cern that the report of any information would
undercut the relationship between the RAs and
students.
"I think that if we find a way of getting the in
formation without asking for the names of stu
dents or the name of the house or even of the
person reporting it, then it doesn't impede or
undercut the relationships that exist in the
house," Supton said.
