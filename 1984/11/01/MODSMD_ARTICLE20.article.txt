## Vineberg rounds up current films 'Teachers'-a series of underdeveloped plots 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
Like the late Paddy Chayevsky's screenplays for "The
Hospital"and "Network," W. R. McKinney's "Teachers"
tries to do two things at once: find a wild, satiric style ap
propriate to conveying the lunacy in a large institution,
and fit into the liberal social-drama category — or, to put
it another way, to he 1960s vaudeville and '50s TV at the
same time. Flailing about desperately to Ix relevant and
touching and hilarious, these movies don't come close to
the documentaries Frederick Wiseman has shot on some
of the same topics. (He has one called "Hospital," too.)
All Wiseman does is to train his camera on the truth; the

humor and the horror emerge naturally out of his keen
observations. Obviously you have to be a gifted reporter
and filmmaker to accumulate the kind and quantity of ob
servations that pile up in the best Wiseman pictures, but
perhaps a writer like McKinney can learn something
about organization and consistency from Wiseman.
There's not much that the director of "Teachers," Ar
thur Hiller, can learn from Wiseman or anyone else — it's
too late for that. After sitting through enough of Hiller's
movies (they include "Love Story," "Plaza Suite," "Man
of La Mancha," "Silver Streak," "The In-Laws,"
"Author! Author!" —and"The Hospital") you realize
that he has no sensitivity to focus or dramatic structure or
editing, and the most you can hope for is a breakthrough
from an actor (Peter O'Toole in "Man of La Mancha") or,
even rarer, from a writer (Andrew Bergman in "The In-
Laws"). McKinney's script for "Teachers," set in an over
crowded big-city high school, asks Hiller to keep half a
dozen subplots in the air. some of them absurd (like the

progress of a substitute teacher, played by Richard Mul
ligan, who is in reality an escapee from a mental institu
tion), some of them melodramatic (like the pregnancy of a
senior student who has been sleeping with the phys. ed.
teacher), and all of them underdeveloped. Hiller makes
sense of none of them, but at least he keeps the picture
moving; it's never boring, and two or three times he
stumbles across an exchange or a situation that is crazy in
an unself-conscious way (and therefore funny).
The major thrust of "Teachers" is the story of a dis
enchanted mid-30s social studies instructor, Alex Jurel
(Nick Nolte). Once a 1960s cause-fighter who cared pas
sionately about his job. Alex has grown so disenchanted
with the way the school system throws boulder-size obsta
cles in the path of education that he prefers to stay in bed
on Monday mornings. His fellow rebel, Roger (Judd
Hirsch), has been co-opted (as they used to say); he's now
vice principal, and since the principal (William Schallert)
retains a comical unawareness of how the school func
tions, Roger really has all of the power — that is, all of the
power delegated him by the school superintendent, Ms.
Burke (Lee Grant), whose concerns are purely political.
In the course of the film, Alex receives a double jolt that
springs him back into the battle against the establishment.
He takes on a challenging kid, Eddie (Ralph Macchio),
who has grown a tough skin to protect himself from his
self-absorbed, warring parents and his own academic in
adequacies (he reads at a sixth-grade level). And he
becomes involved with a former student, Lisa Hammond
(Joßeth Williams), now an idealistic lawyer defending a
high school graduate who claims he was allowed to pass
through the school without learning how to read or write.
Nick Nolte is ideally cast as Alex; perhaps no one in the
history of movies has taken the image of the burn-out as
far as Nolte did in "Who'll Stop the Rain?" and "North
Dallas Forty." And for about half the movie, the accuracy
of his portrayal, which never falters, carries us through
even his scenes with Joßeth Williams, who gives approxi
mately the same dopey, starstruck performance she gave
in "The Big Chill." (Her dialogue doesn't help much. One
scene begins as she and Alex finish the supper she has
cooked for them, and her first line is "So that's how I
passed the bar exam." You wonder what revelation could
possibly have preceded it.) But as the separate bits of plot
begin to gather in one unwieldy snowball, which Alex is
somehow supposed to be at the core of, he loses his
credibility as a character — especially since we never get
to see him teach a single class that might persuade us he's
as special a teacher as his reputation implies.
Besides, we can't fathom Alex's relationships with two
of the three people we're led to believe are most impor
tant to him. Lisa resists his sexual advances at one point,
for no apparent reason other than McKinney's and Hil

ler's insistence on dragging out a bad joke about Lisa s
non-stop involvement in her law case. (This moment is
reminiscent of the scene in "Network" in which Faye
Dunaway keeps chattering about her television station
during sex with William Holden.) We never discover whe
ther these two have actually become lovers, though that
piece of information is withheld so casually its as it the
filmmakers simply forgot to pass it on.
And Alex's friendship with Roger disintegrates off
screen; before we've had a chance to examine why
Roger's fondness for his old buddy has (evidently) sud
denly turned to rancor, Roger has slipped quietly but ir
revocably into the role of the villain, and the last half of
the movie finds him campaigning (underhandedly) to oust
Alex from the staff. Who could believe Nick Nolte and
Judd Hirsch as buddies, anyway? They aren t the same
kind of actor: Nolte's lived-in naturalism can t establish
any point of communication with Hirsch's showcase comic
style, in which timing is all, and when Hirsch tries his
schtick on Nolte he has nothing to bounce off. (Hirsch,
who is occasionally an actor of genius, comes off so badly
in this movie that you begin to think he signed on without
asking to see the script. Surely an actor as shrewd as
Hirsch would know that Barrymore couldn't have made
this unmotivated son of a bitch appealing.)
The film's only emotional veracity comes in the scenes
between Alex and Eddie — not because Hiller resists the
urge to wax sentimental, but because Ralph Macchio (this

summer's "Karate Kid")), whose taut presence is the
most unusual quality in the movie, gives us a character
worth caring about. Macchio looks sleek and dangerous in
his bum's overcoat and his "Guys and Dolls" fedora, and
he has tiny, dark ferret's eyes that grow very still when he
listens. You can believe there's something important
going on between Alex and Eddie because Eddie listens
so hard when Alex talks; Macchio shows you how Eddie
takes in Alex's words, how his entire face seems to process
them even though he makes no vocal acknowledgement.
(In fact, the one scene Macchio blows is his big angry
speech to Alex when another student is shot to death by a
frightened cop. This was probably McKinney's miscal
culation and not Macchio's — Eddie should have
remained a boy of extraordinary eloquence and few words
straight through the picture.) None of the other kids at
Kennedy High act believably like high school students, in
dividually or in a group, but Ralph Macchio reminds you
how intense and frightening real adolescence often is.
"Thief of Hearts"
In its first week in the theaters, "Thief of Hearts"
ranked second (to "Teachers") in box office returns,
which is hardly surprising, considering the entire movie is
a commercial for the San Francisco good life. The charac
