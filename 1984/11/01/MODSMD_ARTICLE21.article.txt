# 'Crimes' allusive, not simple sex farce
## 
### DAVID KONUCH 
If you're interested in the dynamics
of sexual relationships, you should go
see "Crimes of Passion." This new
film by Ken Russell ("Altered
States") is the first in a while that
tries for not just exploitation, but ex
plication of this touchy subject. Rus
sell did a good job on the direction,
and the performances are wonderful;
Barry Sandler's screenplay is overly
clever, tending to make Anthony
Perkins' deranged priest sound like
Allen Ginsberg on a bad day. The les
sons the film tries to teach us about
sex are too complex for me to try to
completely convey here. So go see it.
Excuse me, I digress. The film does
not, however, stick to its subject of
sex like all but the most errant of
Amtrak trains stays to its tracks. The
characters have loads of sex — indeed
spend more time having sex than not
having sex in this film. When they're
not having sex, though, they're plan
ning to have sex, or at least thinking
about it. This is, after all, what I ex
pect in a film about sex. Most of the
effect is achieved through the
screenplay, though, so we see less

gratuitous titillation here than in most
R-rated lilms. The reason for this is
that Russell is trying to make a film
with some allusions of artistry as
opposed to just a simple sex farce.
"Crimes of Passion," as I said, is
not a simple sex farce, and never
shows any hint of deterioratingjnto
one. The film concerns the married
life of Amy (Annie Potts) and Bobby
Grady (John Laughlin). Bobby dis
covers that his married life is not the
green pasture he thought it was. His
wife is unhappy; it seems she no
longer enjoys having sex with him.
At the opposite extreme, we have
Joanna, played by Kathleen Turner.
A strait-laced man-hater with a good
job as a fashion designer by day, she
walks the streets as China Blue, a
more - expensive - than - average
hooker, by night. It seems she has
never been able to find the right man
to have sex with, or to open up with.
She becomes China Blue in order to
exercise power over men by helping
them carry out their secret fantasies
in the impersonal environment of the
red-light district. Anthony Perkins
plays a lecherous, homicidal street

priest out to save China Blue and
reunite her with her public self.
Here's where the film breaks down.
Anthony Perkins' character is never
fully realized in the film. We get the
feeling that the studio had him on
retainer, and decided to write him
into its next project, whatever it was.
Anyone who has seen "Psycho"
might find one important scene of
"Crimes" reminding them a bit too
much of the Hitchcock classic. I think
that this ends up cheapening the film
and diluting its message.
And just what is this film's
message? It's a little hard to codify
having only seen the film once, and
having limited space. The film is very
complex, and laden with symbols I
couldn't begin to describe. Suffice it
to say "Crimes" is a film that tries to
explain certain paradigms of sexual
behavior, while attempting to show
that different things from sex. The
performances here overwhelm the
defects of the screenplay. If you're
really interested, I encourage you to
go see the film and draw your own
conclusions.


John Laughlin, trapped in a stale marriage, turns to Kathleen Turner, who plays a mysterious woman
trapped in sexual power games.
