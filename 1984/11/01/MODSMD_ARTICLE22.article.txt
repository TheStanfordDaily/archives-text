# The Cure takes effect slowly
## 
### JOHN PHILLIPS 
One result of British and American
punk movements was that much of
the energy inherent in a rock-and-roll
show was returned to the audience.
The 1970s was a decade of observing
concerts and yelling between songs.
Hardcore helped to restore the audi
ence as a main attraction at a rock
show — often to excess. Slamming,
thrashing, blood and general inter
active mayhem on the dance floor
became (and still is) a sad overreac
tion.
Concurrent with and as a result of
the punk explosion, bands appeared
whose stage presence was almost
reclusive; these groups were so in
volved in their sounds that it ap
peared they didn't care to acknowl
edge anyone else's presence, and
even seemed to disdain the audi
ence's behavior.
The Cure is a typical post-punk
band that prefers to remain detached
from its audience in performance.
This attitude is never a problem on a
record, but it can lead to less-than

wonderful results in a concert. I won't
say that they didn't put on a good
show, but I will say that they could
have had a much better one if they
had shown a little less responsibility
to convey a reclusive image and in
stead tried to have some fun.
Two different soloists opened the
show. The first gentleman, calling
himself "My Sin," fronted TV sets,
taped sounds and a keyboard. He was
novel but not that novel. He was fol
lowed by a talented juggler/comedian
who hit it off well with the crowd,
particularly when he quipped about
hairstyle or clothing.
After an extended break (just how
long does it take to move a juggler
and three balls offstage?), the Cure
appeared.
This version of the touring Cure
consisted of leader Robert Smith and
four others: drummer, bassist, two
keyboardists, one of whom also
backed on guitar. They each wore
blue coats and white shirts that basi
cally matched. A lot of makeup was

applied in the dressing room, espe
cially to Smith, who came out looking
like a gussied-up racoon. Word is that
he was ill with a bug picked up in
Hong Kong, their last tour stop.
Their first song was "Shake Dog
Shake," from their most recent and
fairly reactionary album, "The Top."
They played selections from all their
American releases. They concen
trated on none, but they did favor
their older, less danceable material.
And herein lies the whole problem
of giving a band like this a fair review.
The bottom line reads that they aren't
a dance band. They're a dirge band.
But regardless of a rock band's style,
it must impart some sort of musical
energy to make a concert worthwhile.
The Cure eventually accomplished
this task but they wasted a lot of time.
Perhaps it was due to Smith's illness,
and perhaps they felt it was necessary
to remain aloof for artistic reasons,
but they came off as lifeless until the
end of the set. Both "The Walk" and
"Let's go to Bed," were hurried
through and shelved quickly. The
bass was buried in the mix. Their big
gest hit, "The Love Cats," wasn't
played.
They began to wake up with the
last, darkly moody song of the set. Fi
nally the majority of patrons on the
spacious Kabuki floor began to sway.
The encore featured songs from the
"Boys Don't Care" album, including a
fiery rendition of "Killing an Arab"
(a clever musical adaptation of
Kafka's "The Stranger"). The
encores lasted a good half hour, and
in this time the Cure redeemed them
selves for their set's lag. As he left the
stage for the last time. Smith turned
and responded to the cries of a young
group by smiling and sticking out his
tongue. Playing a little of this face
during the show would have been
much better than the net result ob
tained by his resigning himself to the
gloomy role of non-smiling frontman
of a cold-wave ensemble wearing evil
black mascara under his eyes, re
sponding to no one.
Smith can be compared with John
Lydon of Public Image Limited (PiL),
who also played in town recently. PiL
is a sullen rhythm band and doesn't
play happy songs (their biggest hit is
titled "Bad Life"). Both Lydon and
Smith are known for very unsocial
behavior, and they both completely
dominate their bands onstage. But
while Lydon played very well to his
audience — talking, gesturing, occa
sionally engaging in retaliatory spit
ting, Smith kept his eyes closed, stood
motionless under a sole spotlight,
didn't speak and constructed a wall
between himself and the audience
that took a whole set to surmount. If
only Smith had used the PiL method,
we might have seen a real Cure.


The Cure's Robert Smith, virtually out of character, opens his eyes.
