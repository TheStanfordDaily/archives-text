J. Geils Band — You're Gettin' Even While rm
Gettirt Odd ☆ ☆ ☆
A listen to both the J. Geils Band's latest and Peter
Wolf s solo "Lights Out" suggests that in their case the
whole is greater than the sum of its parts. The band
successfully evades the commercial trap that reduced
Wolfs effort to the level of Jackson/Jagger's "State of
Shock." But though the Band's musical innovation and
technical skill are still intact, the fast-paced craziness
that distinguished it from mainstream rock's more con
ventional (read: boring) offerings has dissipated, much
as its ex-lead singer has. Some of the instrumental ar
rangements were flat-out lifted from "Freeze-Frame,"
losing their impact in the transition, and even the
music's unpredictability seems forced at times. Even
with these faults, however, "You're Gettin' Even" still
provides a welcome relief from the stagnation that
plagues leather-and-Loverboy radio formats, and is
guaranteed to refresh your memory of the good oP
days before "Double D" and MTV. Overall, the
record's basic strengths prove that a band can survive
both its frontman and its era without losing its touch.

Orchestral Manoeuv res in the Dark — Junk Culture
☆ ☆ ☆ V2
One of the few bands to successfully ignore the com
mercialization of synth pop, OMD has constantly ex
panded the borders of their music: past the usual song
formulas, past conventional instruments, probably
even past their own skills as musicians. The music s
catchy melodies and harmonies are elementary, its
lyrics are usually ignorable and it packs tew surprises;
but for some reason, OMD's sound is unlike any other
— it can be danceable, nostalgic, industrial, or all
three. At any rate, it avoids the antiseptic quality ot
most synth music and resists the temptation to over
whelm the listener with drum machines and robotics.
"Junk Culture" is more of a comfortable album than
pioneers like "Architecture and Morality" or "Dazzle
Ships"; its music incorporates fewer gadgets and more
conventional instruments. Though the sound is more
professional and "acceptable," it is not unique, and
moves OMD more toward the mainstream and away
from the artistic ideal it originally created. Still,
OMD's music is challenging, interesting and, ulti
mately, worthwhile.

Mannheim Steamroller — Christmas ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ Vi
Of the endless collections of Christmas carols
available, Mannheim Steamroller has produced some
thing wonderfully distinct that simply stands above the
rest. Musical innovation is merged with Christmas
spirit as has never been done before. The group mixes
the precise rhythms of rock, the syncopation and chor
dal elements of jazz and the open-air purity of classical
into a package that is guaranteed to please everyone,
even mom and dad. Instruments ranging from drums
and synth to medieval lute and dulcimer are played,
coming together to create a musical fusion that truly
represents the best of what music has to offer. No
sacrifices are made in sound quality, as each record is
carefully mastered and pressed on virgin vinyl for un
paralleled sound. These refinements are reflected in
the album's price, but audiophiles will find every penny
well spent. All of Mannheim Steamroller's six albums
are equally excellent — and this latest release truly
brings a new dimension to Christmas carols that must
be heard to be believed.
