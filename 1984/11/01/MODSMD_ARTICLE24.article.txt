## Birnbach 'College Book' shallow, superficial 
### BRADLEY RUBIDGE 
"Lisa Birnbach's College Book"
By Lisa Birnbach
Ballantine, $9.95 paper, 515 pp.
"Lisa Birnbach's College Book" is
a disappointing follow-up to "The
Preppy Handbook." The genre of
serious writing that the "Handbook"
and its imitations parody is the how
to-book — a collection of instruc
tions, advice or useful information.
One reason why "The Preppy Hand
book" stood out from the mass of
humor books patterned after it is that
in it this element received relatively
scant emphasis. Birnbach's new book
is presented as a genuine guide to col
leges, with a humorous approach and
some extra sections thrown in just for
fun. The result totters between two
stools.
Birnbach's intention is laudable.
Many of the established guides pro
vide little information on what non
academic life at college is like. But
Birnbach attends to leisure to the ex
clusion of academics. Moreover, the
information she thinks is useful may
be of interest once you settle on
where you're going, but provides
little insight for prospective fresh
men. When you were looking at col
leges, would you have been interested
in what the best and worst places to
study were, or where to look for
housing? Would it have affected your
choice of college to know that The
Goose and The "O" are popular off
campus hangouts? Birnbach collected
her information by interviewing stu
dents during brief tours and with
follow-up questionnaires. Her
queries were adapted to the knowl
edge and interest of those already in
residence who are concerned with
making the best of what they've got,
not choosing something better.
The descriptions of the colleges are
often superficial and one-sided. The
interview technique allows her to let a
school's own students indicate what
kind of people (or jerks) they are.
Yet Birnbach seems shy to speak her
own mind, and hesitates to generalize
to any end except to raise a laugh.
Her portraits of schools in the same
academic range as Stanford were only
about 50 percent on target.
The best parts of this book are the
sections that interrupt the survey of
colleges, when Birnbach explains how

to evaluate your roommate, the dis
tinctions between high school and
college, and what sort of social
encounter rates what level of sexual
activity. If you wonder about these
things enough to spend $10 on them
alone, you might consider buying this
book. If you're looking for something
that a younger sibling or friend might
find useful for a college search, the
Yale Daily's "Underground Guide"
is more accurate, objective and per
tinent.
"The Experts Speak"
By Christopher Cerf & Victor
Navasky
Pantheon, $9.95, 392 pp.
This "Definitive Compendium of
Authoritative Misinformation"
panders to a facile, pseudo
intellectual smugness and cynicism
that is not uncommon among the
half-educated. Authors Cerf and
Navasky have assembled a huge num
ber of statements about which they
make two doubtful claims; first, that
the statements are made by experts in
the field being discusssed, and,
second, that the statements are
grossly mistaken. Their intention is to
demonstrate the fallibility of experts
in the areas of their own specializa
tion.
It seems obvious that they think
this should be funny. Some of the
quotations are amusing, hut a think
ing reader will find this material en
tertaining more because it makes him
wonder why these erroneous state
ments were made than because he
feels a cheap superiority at the ac
curacy of his hindsight.
The frequency with which Ronald
Reagan is quoted in "The Experts
Speak" is a tipoff that Cerf and
Navasky have accepted certain fig
ures as experts only because they oc
cupy positions which induce layper
sons to trust their statements. When
those cited have a legitimate claim to
informedness in the area addressed,
the editors make no attempt to ex
plain why they might be "wrong," im
plicity attributing all the errors to a
uniform source — stupidity. There
are long sections of "mistaken" judg
ments of works in the fine arts and
literature. Of all the statements in this
book, these are the least clearly

wrong, and some of them might be
supported today — Virginia Woolfs
opinion of "Ulysses," for example,
could find many adherents, and not
just among "experts."
The statements which this book
tries to show up as wrong concern
areas of common knowledge. The er
rors consist in judgments contrary to
assumptions which many people hold
without ever really thinking about
them. But the source of such assump
tions is often just the kind of unques
tioning acceptance of the majority
view that provides many of the state
ments in "The Experts Speak." In
stead of encouraging a productive
kind of skepticism, Cerf and Navasky
embrace a barren cynicism which
induces an unearned sense of superi
ority and knowledgeability.

"Ernest Hemingway on Writing"
Edited by Larry W. Phillips
Scribner's, $12.95, 140 pp.
"The most essential gift for a good
writer is a built-in, shockprooof, shit
detector. This is the writer's radar
and all great writers have had it."
Reader's should have it too, and it
will get some exercise in this collec
tion of Ernest Hemingway's remarks
on issues related to literature and the
writer's trade. But the amount of
"dross" in this little book is surpris
ingly low, and the power of some of
Hemingway's statements make up for
the embarrassment one sometimes
feels reading others.
Unless they feel a special need to
have Hemingway's statements about

being a writer conveniently as
sembled, Hem's fans might better go
directly to the letters or to "By Line:
Ernest Hemingway." But less avid
readers can get a good general sense
of Hemingway's feelings about
writing from this little book. The
most prominent feature of his state
ments about why he writes is well
summed up in this passage from "By
Line": "There is no use writing any
thing that has been written before un
less you can beat it. What a writer in
our time has to do is write what hasn't
been written before or beat dead men
at what they have done. The only way
he can tell how he is going is to com
pete with dead men."
This book seems directed most at
aspiring writers, and it's impossible to

predict how it will serve them; if you
feel some sympathy with the state
ment just quoted, you'll probably get
something, even if only a sense of en
couragement, from "Ernest
Hemingway on Writing." If you still
take "literarieness" very seriously,
you may be turned into a Hemingway
hater. I have to confess some sympa
thy for him when he writes: "Carlos
Baker really baffles me. Do you think
he can con himself into thinking 1
would put a symbol into anything on
purpose. It's hard enough just to
make a paragraph." There are plenty
of times when Hemingway mistakes
taking oneself seriously for being
serious, but the sincerity with which
he speaks about his trade is too much
in evidence for his opinions to be dis
missed.
