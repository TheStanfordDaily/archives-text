## Women's volleyball Cardinal holds on to first with victory 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
The No. 1-ranked Stanford wo
men's vollevball team defeated No. 2
ranked UCLA, 15-7, 6-15, 15-9, 15-
11, last night in Los Angeles. The
Cardinal is now 12-2 overall and 9-1
in the Western Collegiate Athletic
Association. UCLA is 19-4 overall
and 8-3 in the WCAA.
Against UCLA, Stanford had a
team hitting percentage of .270. The
Bruins hit .140. According to Stan
ford Asst. Coach Don Shaw, the Car
dinal did not play up to its ability
against the Bruins. "We didn't play
real well. In fact, we struggled at
times. UCLA played much better this
time."
At the teams' first meeting on Oct.
17, Stanford defeated the Bruins in
three games. In that match, UCLA's
serving was "Hat," and the Bruins'
play was flawed with several mental
errors.
Last night, however, UCLA served
much better, Shaw said. UCLA's
serves were "especially good in the
second game. They beat us really
quickly," he said. UCLA had a total
of 11 service aces in the match.
After winning the first game, Stan
ford dropped the second with a low
.061 team hitting percentage. The
Cardinal was able to come back in the
final two games with percentages of
.333 and .362, respectively.
"I was glad that we were able to
come back strong," Shaw said. "This
was a tough match to win. . . . We
took charge again in game three and
got back on the right track."
UCLA was unable to play two
starters against Stanford. Hitter Katie
McGarrey did not play due to a
pulled neck muscle. She is second on

the team in kills with 216 and leads
UCLA in hitting percentage at .335.
A Bruin setter, Michelle Boyette, was
also out with an injury.
But according to Shaw, the absence
of these starters was not a great help
to the Cardinal. "It didn't necessarily
work to our advantage. We were
prepared for UCLA's best. They
brought in some unorthodox players
which made things even more
frustrating for us."
Kim Oden led Stanford offensively
with 20 kills and only three hitting er

rors. She also had four blocks and
seven digs. Susan Compton was
second in kills with nine. Setter
Diedra Dvorak had 30 assists. The
Bruins were led by Liz Masakayon,
who had 17 kills.
With four conference matches left
to play, Stanford has taken a fairly
comfortable lead over its top oppo
nents in the WCAA. Tuesday,
USC defeated San Diego State Uni
versity to give the Aztecs their third
conference loss. As the conference
stands, USC, San Diego State and

UCI.A have three losses each, while
Stanford has only one loss.
With last night's win. the Cardinal
has won eight straight conference
matches. According to Shaw, the
team needs a rest. Stanford had
planned to play in the National lnvi
tional Volleyball Tournament this
weekend at UCLA, but will take a
break "for the girls to get some rest
and catch up on their studies."
Stanford's next away game will be
against Cal State Long Beach on Nov.
6.
