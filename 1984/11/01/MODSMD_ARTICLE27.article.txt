## Heroes aren't free anymore 
### 
Every once in a while I get
asked the eternal sports question,
"Who are your sports heroes?"
As I think about my answer I
get this 10-year-old, starry-eyed
sort of dreamy look on my face.
The person who asked me the
question starts to anticipate my
answer by saying, "Babe Ruth, Ty
Cobb, Pete Rose, Hank Aaron,
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Wilt
Chamberlain, Jim Brown, Dick
Butkus. Those guys, right?"
No. My answer throws the ques
tioner off a little and he gets this
puzzled look. That look of puzzle
ment gets more pronounced when
I start to give my list of names.
Andy Messersmith, Catfish
Hunter, Reggie Jackson, Dave
Goltz, Rennie Stennett and
Manny Trillo. Recently, 1 added
Rick Sutcliffe, Bruce Sutter, Willie
Hernandez and Dave Kingman to
that list.
Now comes the next question.
"Why?"
Well, for those of you who know
recent sports history, these names
are familiar. For those of you who
don't, these sports figures are all
free agents.
Free agents are the modern-day
sports figures. They have made
sports what it is today, a place for
rich guys to hit home runs, strike
out batters and snort the latest fad
drug.
To be truthful, free agents
didn't really bother me that much
before. I actually thought some of
these guys were changing the
sports establishment for the bet
ter.
Before there were free agents,
professional sports was a place
where rich owners got richer and
gave very little of the spoils to the
athletes. Up until the early 19705,
the minimum salary in major
league baseball was in the $20,000
range. The average yearly salary
was between $50,000 and
$60,000.
But now free agency has gotten
out of hand. Players are now
jumping from team to team with
only their pocketbooks in mind
Players no longer seem to care

whether or not they even play in a
good city or if they play for a win
ning team.
The best example is Detroit
Tigers relief ace Hernandez. Yes
terday, Hernandez won the Amer
ican League Cy Young award for
his magnrticent year. With all his
bonus money and playoff money,
he earned approximately
$530,000 tor the 1984 season.
Last week, Hernandez started
to complain that he wanted his
contract renegotiated. He is now
listed as a player who has
"demanded to be traded." In
doing so, if he is not traded by
March 15, 1985, he automatically
becomes a free agent.
Hernandez wants $4.5 million
for the next four years. Evidently,
he and the Tigers are close to sign
ing but are still a "few thousand
dollars apart," according to Her
nandez.
I he funny thing about all of this
is that Hernandez also claims that
he doesn't care that much about
the money. "Money is not the
most important thing in my life,"
he told the New York Times.
Well, Willie, you may not know
what to say, but you do know how
to lie. Hernandez is playing for the
dollars, period.
What's really too bad about that
is Hernandez is in a pretty good
situation. He is on a world cham
pion team, he's now considered
the best pitcher in his league and
probably would have gotten a
hefty raise even without demand
ing it. If he had another great
season like this one, he could
probably have owned half of
Detroit within a year.
But Hernandez decided to spoil
the party. Instead of being happy
with what he had or even proving
his worth with another great year,
he became a crybaby. The funny
thing is that he will probably get
what he wants. Within the next
month, the Tigers will sign Her
nandez to some mega-dollar con
tract.
Willie will be rich and famous.
He'll be a hero to me.
