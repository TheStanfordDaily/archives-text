# Field hockey team ends on losing note
## 
### JASON COLE Daily staff 
No matter what the outcome of
yesterday's field hockey game at the
University of California at Berkeley,
Stanford was going to seal its fate as
well as its season.
If the Cardinal had won, it would
have made itself a viable candidate
for an at-large berth to the National
Collegiate Athletic Association
tournament. The team entered the
game as the No. 16-ranked team in
the country, but only 12 teams are
invited to the tournament.
However, after yesterday's NorPac
conference loss, 3-2, to the Bears, the
Cardinal will probably not make the
cut for the NCAA tournament. The
Cardinal finished the season at 9-7
overall, 4-4 in conference.
Stanford is now in second place in
the conference, but that standing is
precarious since Cal and the Univer
sity of the Pacific have one and two
games remaining on their schedules,
respectively.
Even if Stanford manages to keep
its precarious second-place standing
it would be unlikely that the NCAA

would take a team with its record. As
Coach Onnie Killefer explained ear
lier in the season, teams in the west
ern region of the country sometimes
aren't ranked as highly as they
deserve to be. "I'm not sure that's
necessarily indicative of hockey out
west."
Thus, the Eastern bias of the
NCAA selection process may inhibit
the Cardinal's chances even if it can
finish in second. What is more likely,
however, is that Stanford will finish
either third or fourth behind Cal or
UOP. That would pretty much assure
no spot for the Cardinal.
But Stanford has only itself to
blame for being out of the playoff
picture. The team took a 2-1 lead into
the second half of yesterday's game,
but allowed Cal to come back for the
victory with two second-half goals.
Fifth-year senior and two-time AII-
American Patsy Huntington finished
her last regular season game as a Car
dinal with both of the team's goals.
Huntington, the team's leading
scorer, got her first goal on an assist
from sophomore Andi Wolpert.
Senior Jen Bleakley assisted on
second goal.

Stanford junior Susan Fisher will have chance to help the Cardinal get
an NCAA Tournament bid, but that chance will probably not come un
til next season.
