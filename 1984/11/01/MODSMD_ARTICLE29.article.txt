## 
### ERIK ESELIUS Staff sportswriter 
Playing its first night game, the
Stanford women's soccer team ad
justed to the lights and came away
with a 1-0 victory over host Chico
State University.
The Cardinal had several good
chances in the game, including one
shot that hit off the goalpost. Accord
ing to Stanford Head Coach Helen
Keohane, Chico State's goalkeeper
was very good.
With 18 minutes left in the game,
Stanford broke the scoreless tie.
Stanford's lone goal came from its
usual offensive source — senior for
ward Sue Moore who notched her
11th goal of the season. Senior
midfielder Lisa Shaffer assisted on
the score.
"It was a good back-and-forth
game," Keohane said. "We didn't
really dominate the game but we con
trolled the game a little more (than
they did)."

Stanford played both goalkeepers.
Helen Norton started the game, but
had trouble with night vision. Teresa
Greaney came in the second half and
recorded "a couple of nice saves" ac
cording to Keohane.
It was the second shutout of the
year for the Cardinal. With the vic
tory, the Cardinal went over the .500
mark for the first time all season.
"It feels real good," Keohane said.
"We should have had a winning
record much earlier, but we lost some
games early in the year that were
close."
Stanford closes its season against
Sonoma State University. The Car
dinal scrimmaged Sonoma State ear
lier in the year and lost 4-0.
Keohane says though that Friday's
home game "will probably be decided
by one goal again" since the Cardinal
has added some new players and is
more experienced since the first time
the teams met.
