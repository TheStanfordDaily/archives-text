### HEATHER WRIGHT Staff writer 
The presidential candidate of the nation's third-largest
political party called for an end to income taxes" and the
Internal Revenue Service at a campaign stop here yester
day afternoon.
Libertarian David Bergland told a small group at Fair
child Auditorium that his party's platform is based on
"maximizing personal liberty while minimizing the gov
ernment role and involvement."
"The federal government serves only two legitimate
functions: national defense and protecting our constitu
tional rights," Bergland said. "We can reduce the size of
government and replace coercive measures [of making
people contribute to society] with voluntary ones."
In lieu of income taxes, Bergland suggested lotteries as
a potential way of generating government revenue with
out infringing on personal liberties. He also spoke of a
"national defense endowment" program where the
federal government would begin selling off its vast land
holdings, railroads, and other investments "the govern
ment shouldn't have anyway." The profits from these
sales would help pay for national defense, he said.
Bergland questioned the abilities of President Reagan
and Democratic candidate Walter Mondale, asking,
"Does either one demonstrate the competence and
qualities necessary to hold the highest office?"
Bergland also said a vote for him is not a wasted vote.

"The purpose of
voting is to tell
the politicians
which direction
to take. You
have to tell
politicians what
you think is
right. If you
vote for a Dem
ocrat or Repub
lican you are
saying 'nice
going.' "
Bergland said
that if Reagan
and Mondale
were the only
people running
for president he

wouldn't vote, he'd "go to the beach instead.
In 1980, Libertarian presidential candidate Ed Clark
garnered nearly a million votes.
Bergland was nominated to lead his party at the Liber
tarian Presidential Nominating Convention in New York
City last fall. His running mate, Jim Lewis, is a former lib
ertarian candiate for the U.S. Senate trom Connecticut.
Bergland was born in Mapleton, lowa in 1935 and grew
up in Southern California. He currently operates a private
law practice in Costa Mesa.
