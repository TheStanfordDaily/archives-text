# Women's golf team finishes fourth again
## 
### ROB GRAHAM Staff sportswriter 
In its second performance of the
year, the Stanford women's golf
team finished fourth in the three
day, 54-hole Western Intercol
legiate Tournament at the Rancho
Murieta Country Club near
Sacramento.
The women were coming off
their fourth-place showing last
week at the Nancy Lopez Invita
tional in Tulsa, Okla.
The Western Intercollegiate was
played on a course that Coach Tim
Baldwin described as "by far the
hardest we play all year." Rancho
Murieta is a par-74, 6,100 yard
course. Worse, Monday's round
was played during a consistent and
miserable drizzle, Baldwin said.
Still, the Card was able to

overcome the weather and a field
that was "way above average
strength for an intercollegiate
event." He hopes the tournament
primes the women for this
weekend's Stanford Women's Fall
All-Intercollegiate Tournament.
The Cardinal's total of 954 was
13 strokes behind the winner, the
University of Tulsa. San Jose State
was eight strokes off the pace in
second place.
Sophomore Kathleen McCarthy
led the women with a nine-over
par 231, good for third in the indi
vidual* competition. Ninth-place
finisher Kay Cornelius chipped in
with a 238. Kathy Kostais
Stephanie Kondrick (247) and
Adriane Gilmartin (253) rounded
out the scoring for Stanford.
