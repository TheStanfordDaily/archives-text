# Panel explores election

Four experts on international relations presented
views on disarmament, Third-World policy, NATO,
"the national mood" and the upcoming presidential
election at a panel discussion in Branner Hall last
night.
Political Science Prof. Condoleezza Rice, a specialist
on Eastern Europe, said she was disappointed that the
presidential candidates have skirted important issues
on international policy in the campaign. She noted
constraints that "the president can do very little
about."
"He enters a situation with a long history, and he
must deal with issues in this context," she said. These
constraints are most obvious in Eastern Europe, and
"any president who doesn't face this is whistling
Dixie."
Rice stressed the need to treat NATO allies with a
certain level of maturity, a topic she feels has been
ignored.
Gregory Newell, assistant secretary of state for in
ternational organizations and a former special assistant
to President Reagan, said he has found the president's
"dialogue with world leaders to be fruitful."
Newell said that "while foreign leaders are not al
ways pleased, they know where we stand. Our position
is clear. . . . Dealings with the U.S. have never been
tougher, but never more productive."
On the issue of Third-World relations, he said statist

theories would have "the North transfered to the
South, abandoning American interests. We have
realized that the U.S. has interests, values, which must
be protected through our influence in multinational or
ganizations."
Lt. Col. Ralph Cossa, a Hoover Institution specialist
on southeast Asia, said he feels the election is "not
very important" becauses he sees more similarity than
difference between the two candidates.
He agreed with the need to create a bipartisan na
tional consensus, adding that "no president can get too
far ahead of the national mood, nor too far behind. . . .
The U.S. can't lead a free-world alliance if we do not
restore bipartisanship to our foreign policy," he said.
Political Science Prof. David Abernethy predicted
that Reagan will "win by a landslide, but has small
coattails," adding that he expects the elections will ef
fect little change in either house. Abernethy found it
difficult to divine what Reagan's behavior might be in a
second term, saying it will be "easier for Mr. Reagan to
be Mr. Reagan. .. whatever that is."
Abernethy was critical of Reagan's policy in regard
to Third-World countries, which is based on what he
called "essentially an East-West orientation," an out
look that has caused misapplications of power.
He cited South Africa, a case in which Reagan has
"refused to see in the light of human rights, seeing [it]
as a strategic ally, putting us clearly on the side of the
government."
