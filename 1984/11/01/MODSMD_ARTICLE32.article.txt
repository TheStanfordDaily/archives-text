# Police nab robbery suspect
## 
### 
In a pre-dawn raid, Stanford Police
arrested an East Palo Alto resident
yesterday who allegedly pulled a
knife on a Tresidder Union employee
Sunday and absconded with more
than $500.
Donald Timothy Phillips, 33, was
charged with armed robbery and
booked into North County Jail,
where he is now being held in lieu of
$15,000 bail.
Police believe Phillips held up a
female employee of Servomation
Corp. at 4:20 p.m. on Sunday, not
Monday as earlier reported in The
Daily. A former employee of Ser
vomation, Phillips allegedly took the
food concession's receipts of more
than $500 from the employee as she
was carrying the money to the Tresid
der basement.
The robber wore a Mervyn's bag
over his head, but removed it after

basing won't work. . . . 'Star Wars'

cribed. ... It is a bad idea."
Kendall, who is chairman of Con
cerned Scientists, said the "space
shield" and build-up of space weap
ons would be perceived by the Soviet
Union as an addition to U.S. "first
strike" capability.
The Soviet response, Kendall said,
would be a missile build-up which
would have the effect of "decreasing
our security."
The MIT physicist said Reagan
"talks about it (the "Star-wars" plan)
as total security," and added as a po
litical note that the plan is not a move
a Mondale administration would
make.

shutting the victim in a closet. But the
employee caught a glimpse of the
robber, and said she recognized
Phillips' voice and physical appear
ance. Phillips had worked at Tresid
der "up until recently," according to
Stanford Police Capt. Raoul
Niemeyer.
Niemeyer said Phillips "knew the
routine" with the daily receipts and
"laid in wait" for the employee.
"Basically, he threatened her by
saying 'Give me the money,' and he
was carrying a knife," Niemeyer said,
adding that he did not threaten or
harm her in any other way. The vic
tim got out of the closet quickly after
Phillips left.
Having spent Monday and Tuesday
doing "detective work," Detective
John McMullen and Sgt. Philip Love
tracked Phillips to his apartment yes

terday with the aid of the San Mateo
County Sheriffs Department. They
awoke him at 6:00 a.m. with a war
rant for his arrest. Phillips' female
roommate, who is not being held,
refused to let police search the apart
ment.

vestigation," Niemeyer said. Officers
will take the knife and bag they
believed Phillips used the Depart
ment of Justicc forensic lab in
Sacramento tomorrow to match fin
gerprints and establish other items of
evidence. They do not expect to
recover the money.
Niemeyer predicts that Phillips,
who lists his occupations as cook and
construction worker, will probably
plead not guilty. "He says he doesn't
know anything about it," Niemeyer
said.
