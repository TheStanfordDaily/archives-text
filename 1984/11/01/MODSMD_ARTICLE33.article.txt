# Letters still missing

### 
The 15 letters spelling "Stanford Stadium" that were stolen from the
stadium's front wall late last week are worth $3500 three times more
than originally reported by police, according to Stanford Police Capt.
Raoul Niemeyer.
"That's pretty damn expensive," Niemeyer said. "We're not talking
about stealing ice cream cones or something." Stealing property worth
more than $400 is considered grand theft in Calitornia.
Niemeyer said he believes the letters may turn up soon, with Nov. 17
as the likely date. "We have a theory that someone stole them with the
intent of displaying them at the Big Game," he said. The Stanford foot
ball team plays the University of California at Berkeley in Berkeley on
Nov. 17.
"We're going to have our people in the stands working the crowds,
and if they see those letters, some people are going to jail," Niemeyer
said.
