# Scientists poke holes in 'Star Wars' defense
## 
### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER Senior staff writer 
Five prominent scientists from across the
country converged here yesterday to discuss
the idea of placing an electronic shield over
the United States that would keep space
weapons from getting close enough to fire.
Carl Sagan, a Pulitzer Prize-winning sci
ence writer and professor at Cornell Univer
sity, is one of the major opponents of the
"space shield." He said such a defense bar
rier would not make Soviet missiles
"impotent and obsolete," as proponents of
President Reagan's "Star Wars" defense
plan have suggested.
Sagan was joined by Wolfgang Panofsky,
director of the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center; Sidney Drell, co-director of Cen
ter for International Security and Arms Con
trol here; William Perry, a former under
secretary of defense for research and engi
neering; and Henry Kendall, professor of
physics at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
The scientists spoke to a near capacity
crowd at Dinkelspiel Auditorium. They are
traveling across the country to promote the
campaign of Democratic presidential candi

date Walter Mondale.
Sagan said that if the United States con
structs a space shield, the Soviets would in
stall a similar system over their country.
"The moment the shields became less than
impenetrable," warheads would be let in,
Sagan said. The Cornell professor noted that
the Soviet Union currently has 10,000 war
heads: "plenty to kill all of us Americans."
To explain the space shield, Sagan said,
"Let's imagine the following situation:
Suppose there was a kind of shield over the
United States that would let air in and sun
light, but not Soviet warheads. The warheads
come in, they hit the shield, go 'boing' and
slither off into the Gulf of Mexico.
"If the United States shot 10,000 war
heads at the Soviet Union, they would go
bouncing off and fall in the Sea of Okhotsk."
The main problems with an impenetrable
system are that it "simply cannot work," and
would cost SI trillion, Sagan said.
Several nations have discussed the "shield
plan," Sagan said, but "the only nation on
the planet that thought it was a good idea
was the United States."

Reagan's "Star Wars" defense plan at a Dinkelspiel Auditorium speech yesterday af
ternoon. Sagan and other scientists are touring the country on behalf of Democratic
presidential candidate Walter Mondale.
Panofsky noted that since World
War II the total number of missiles
and other strategic weapons has in
creased, "but our real security has
decreased."
Discussing the space shield idea,
Panofsky said, "There is a unanimous

feeling that this is an enterprise that
we might explore to a greater level."
William Perry, an undersecretary
of defense during the Carter adminis
tration, said there is a considerable
amount of confusion concerning new
weapons in space and the treaties
relating to them. Perry said a space
weapons plan is "simple but not
feasible."
The former Carter administration

official said the shield would not work
because it is easily attacked. Perry
added that he thinks weapons would
be able to "get under the shield."
Perry said that if the new device
was put in space, it would use one
third of the country's research and
development program.
Drell said, " We have to work to get
rid of those (space) weapons."
Drell said he believes that no de-
