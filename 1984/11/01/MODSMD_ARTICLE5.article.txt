Measure cuts campaign funds

In this, the fourth article in a week
long series on key ballot propositions
facing California voters in Tuesday's
election, The Daily looks at Proposi
tion 40, which would put a ceiling on
campaign spending. Tomorrow: the
state Supreme Court initiative.
By BRYAN WALSER
Candidates seeking seats in the
California legislature will spend
nearly $50 million this year on elec
tion campaigns; the average would
be legislator pays about half a million
dollars trying to win an office which
pays barely $28,000 year.
Some people want to change that.
Proposition 40, the California
Campaign Contribution Limitations
initiative, is billed by its proponents
as a way to reduce campaign spending
while making legislators more
responsive to their constituents â€” in
stead of to the enormous special in
terest groups proponents say provide
most campaign funds.
Opponents, such as the California
Taxpayers' Association and the Cali
fornia Chamber of Commerce, main
tain that Proposition 40, though
heralded as a campaign reform mea
sure, is actually an incumbent
protection plan and a scheme to allow
public financing of political cam
paigns.
The measure itself is relatively
straightforward. A $1,000-per-year
limit would be placed on the amount
individuals, political parties and
political-action committees would be
allowed to contribute to a particular
candidate, and a $10,000 per year
limit would be placed on the amount
any individual could contribute to all
campaigns combined.
In addition, transfers of funds be
tween candidates and among various
accounts by a candidate would be
outlawed, as well as contributions to a
political campaign from corporations
and labor unions. Finally, since no
limit can be placed legally on the
amount spent by a candidate from his
personal funds, the measure would
allow matching public funds to be
awarded to all opponents if a candi-

date used his own money in a cam
paign.
The controversy over this proposi
tion boils down to its use of public
funds in political campaigns and its
limits on campaign contributions. Ac
cording to John Sullivan of the Cali
fornia Taxpayers' Association, this
proposition is "a foot in the door of
public financing." Sullivan ac
knowledges problems with the current
situation, but maintains that any
reform plan must not involve any sort
of public financing which would bur
den California taxpayers.
Assemblyman Ross Johnson, the
chairman of the Committee for Fair
Campaign Finance and a chief sup-

porter of the initiative, points out that
the measure does not allow a compre
hensive scheme of public campaign
financing, but allows public money to
be used "only if a candidate tried to
use personal wealth to buy office." In
addition, Johnson says, "Only candi
dates facing this unfair competition
could ever receive public financing"
Opponents of the measure, such as
Dean Watkins, a past chairman of the
California Chamber of Commerce,
charge that it would act to protect in
cumbents by limiting the funds any
potential challenger could raise. Ac
cording to Watkins, "An incumbent
has the advantage of already being
known in the district, so a challenger
has to spend extra money in order to
get his message out."
Johnson disagrees, saying this view
assumes that the only way campaigns
can be run is under the current sys
tem. "What's wrong with spending
time in service and becoming known
to your community?
