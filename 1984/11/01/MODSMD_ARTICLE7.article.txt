'Suspicious' explosion rips tanker
SAN F RANCISCO — Three "highly suspicious" explosions ripped
through a 632-foot petrochemical tanker early yesterday, injuring eight
crewmen and leaving one man missing off the Northern California coast,
the U.S. Coast Guard said.
I'he FBI is investigating the possibility that a bomb was planted on
board the SS Puerto Rican because investigators considered the blasts
"highly suspicious," said Robert Gast, the FBI agent in charge.
Flames from the ship leapt 100 feet into the pre-dawn sky after the ex
plosions hurled at least two burned men into the chilly ocean, Chief
Petty Officer John Hollis said. The men were rescued and taken to Let
terman Hospital.
"It was such a violent explosion that it just peeled 50 feet of the deck
right back." Gast said. "It is unusual that an explosion would affect the
ship in that way. These are all factors that give rise to speculation" that a
bomb was on board.
The Puerto Rican was embroiled in a nationwide dispute between the
Masters, Mates and Pilots Union and five shipping companies last week
when it was left stranded inside the Oakland Estuary.
Coast Guard firefighters yesterday battled the flames for six hours but
had to abandon the ship when the blaze erupted again. Public Affairs
Officer Brad Terrill said.
A commercial tugboat towed the flaming vessel seven miles farther
out to sea to reduce the environmental damage a spill might cause if the
ship sinks, Hollis said.
"There's still a possibility that it could go down," he said. "The farther
out (the ship is taken) the better."
The 20,295-ton ship, owned by Keystone Shipping of Philadelphia,
was carrying lube oils, fuel additives, butane and other petrochemicals,
Hollis said.
Diablo Canyon injunction lifted
WASHINGTON — The U.S. Court of Appeals yesterday lifted its
seven-week injunction blocking the commercial operation of the Diablo
Canyon nuclear plant near San Luis Obispo.
The order frees the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to issue a full
power license for the first of two reactors at the $5.1 billion atomic plant,
which has become a nationwide symbol of the controversy over nuclear
power.
Joseph Fouchard, an NRC spokesman, said the the agency "is
working on the license and it could be issued sometime this week."
The five-member commission approved the full-power operating
license for Diablo Canyon on Aug. 2 in a 3-1 vote after the facility had
been delayed for more than a decade by earthquake fears and design
flaws.
However, in a response to a suit by opponents that not all of the po
tential earthquake problems had been adequately addressed, the Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia two weeks later issued a stay
preventing the commission from actually issuing the license.
The court issued an order late yesterday lifting the stay after hearing
90 minutes of oral arguments on the case, including new accusations that
the commission had improperly handled concerns that an earthquake
might hamper the evacuation of a 10-mile area around the plant in an
accident.
Soviets say CIA supports Sikhs
MOSCOW — Within hours of the assassination of Indian Prime Mini
ster Indira Gandhi, the Soviet news media yesterday renewed their
charge that the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency supports Sikh ex
tremists.
The state-run press and radio stopped short of accusing the United
States of involvement in the slaying, however, and a senior government
spokesman said it was up to India to decide who committed the crime.
But Pravda, the Communist Party newspaper, said in a story printed
before the assassination that the CIA was trying to split India into a
group of "banana republics" by fostering opposition to Gandhi's gov
ernment.
"Washington is prepared to pay any price" to defeat Gandhi's govern
ment, the Pravda article said, adding, "The Indian leaders are on the
ClA's target."
A commentary carried by Tass, the official news agency, also assailed
the CIA, asking, "What can be said of a whole series of political assas
sinations, masterminded by the CIA, its agents, mercenaries and ac
complices?"
In a formal message of condolence to Indian President Zail Singh, the
Presidium of the Supreme Soviet said, "Soviet people wrathfully stig
matize the criminals and their patrons." It did not name any patrons.
Earlier, the press department of the Soviet Foreign Ministry charged
at a news briefing that the United States was conducting a "policy of
state terrorism." Briefing officer Vladimir Lomeiko, however, said the
briefing was arranged Tuesday, before the Gandhi assassination.
"It is up to the government of India to establish facts and punish those
who carried out this murderous attack," he said.
Nicaraguans allege U.S. flyover
MANAGUA. Nicaragua — The Sandinista government says a U.S.
spy plane flew over Nicaragua, causing sonic booms that panicked
people who thought they were being bombed. In Washington, the Pent
agon denied the claim.
A Defense Ministry communique from the leftist government in
Managua said the alleged incident yesterday substantiated a long-voiced
Sandinista claim that U.S. military forces are planning to invade
Nicaragua if President Reagan is re-elected next week.
Residents of Granada, about 28 miles southeast of the capital, told
The Associated Press by telephone that two explosions shook build
ings in their city yesterday, shortly before what sounded like an explo
sion was heard in Managua.
Capt. Guillermo Gonzalez, a Defense Ministry spokesman, claimed
that a high-flying spy plane — a supersonic U.S. Air Force Lockheed
SR-71 known as the Blackbird — had violated Nicaraguan air space and
"carried out acts of espionage while at the same time causing justified
alarm in our population in breaking the sound barrier."
Gonzalez told a news conference the plane's mission had the double
purpose of "espionage and creating panic and intimidation among the
people of Nicaragua." According to the government's communique, the
spy plane flew over Nicaragua for about 10 minutes shortly before noon.
Earlier in the day, the government radio claimed that "various
airplanes," which it did not identify, flew in from Honduras and made
bombing raids in Nicaragua near the Honduran border.
Chile returns to relative quiet
SANTIAGO, Chile — Working life returned to normal yesterday
after a 24-hour national strike against the government of President
Augusto Pinochet, during which seven people died in political violence
and at least 50 were injured.
After virtually paralyzing this capital of 3.5 million people by bringing
bus service to a near-standstill on Tuesday, the opposition labor leaders
who had called the strike urged opposition political parties to join them
in a more active front against the Pinochet regime.
But the government minimized the strike's effect, saying what it called
extremist violence had caused some absenteeism but had not shut down
the economy.
Pinochet, an army general who has governed Chile for 11 years, in
augurated an international agricultural and industrial fair here yesterday
afternoon and repeated his rejection of opposition demands that he call
early congressional elections and shorten his presidential term, which is
due to end in 1989.
Stocks fall after Tuesday's rally
NEW YORK — Stock prices slumped yesterday after Tuesday's
strong rally faded.
Tuesday's advance was attributed largely to falling interest rates in the
credit markets. But rates turned mixed in today's activity.
Today's weather
It will be sunny in the morning with increasing cloudiness in the after
noon and a chance of rain tonight. Today's highs will be in the 60s to low
70s.

before the assassination that the CIA was trying to split India into a
group of "banana republics" by fostering opposition to Gandhi's gov
ernment.
"Washington is prepared to pay any price" to defeat Gandhi's govern
ment, the Pravda article said, adding, "The Indian leaders are on the
ClA's target."
A commentary carried by Tass, the official news agency, also assailed
the CIA, asking, "What can be said of a whole series of political assas
sinations, masterminded by the CIA, its agents, mercenaries and ac
complices?"
In a formal message of condolence to Indian President Zail Singh, the
Presidium of the Supreme Soviet said, "Soviet people wrathfully stig
matize the criminals and their patrons." It did not name any patrons.
Earlier, the press department of the Soviet Foreign Ministry charged
at a news briefing that the United States was conducting a "policy of
state terrorism." Briefing officer Vladimir Lomeiko, however, said the
briefing was arranged Tuesday, before the Gandhi assassination.
"It is up to the government of India to establish facts and punish those
who carried out this murderous attack," he said.
Nicaraguans allege U.S. flyover
MANAGUA. Nicaragua — The Sandinista government says a U.S.
spy plane flew over Nicaragua, causing sonic booms that panicked
people who thought they were being bombed. In Washington, the Pent
agon denied the claim.
A Defense Ministry communique from the leftist government in
Managua said the alleged incident yesterday substantiated a long-voiced
Sandinista claim that U.S. military forces are planning to invade
Nicaragua if President Reagan is re-elected next week.
Residents of Granada, about 28 miles southeast of the capital, told
The Associated Press by telephone that two explosions shook build
ings in their city yesterday, shortly before what sounded like an explo
sion was heard in Managua.
Capt. Guillermo Gonzalez, a Defense Ministry spokesman, claimed
that a high-flying spy plane — a supersonic U.S. Air Force Lockheed
SR-71 known as the Blackbird — had violated Nicaraguan air space and
"carried out acts of espionage while at the same time causing justified
alarm in our population in breaking the sound barrier."
Gonzalez told a news conference the plane's mission had the double
purpose of "espionage and creating panic and intimidation among the
people of Nicaragua." According to the government's communique, the
spy plane flew over Nicaragua for about 10 minutes shortly before noon.
Earlier in the day, the government radio claimed that "various
airplanes," which it did not identify, flew in from Honduras and made
bombing raids in Nicaragua near the Honduran border.
Chile returns to relative quiet
SANTIAGO, Chile — Working life returned to normal yesterday
after a 24-hour national strike against the government of President
Augusto Pinochet, during which seven people died in political violence
and at least 50 were injured.
After virtually paralyzing this capital of 3.5 million people by bringing
bus service to a near-standstill on Tuesday, the opposition labor leaders
who had called the strike urged opposition political parties to join them
in a more active front against the Pinochet regime.
But the government minimized the strike's effect, saying what it called
extremist violence had caused some absenteeism but had not shut down
the economy.
Pinochet, an army general who has governed Chile for 11 years, in
augurated an international agricultural and industrial fair here yesterday
afternoon and repeated his rejection of opposition demands that he call
early congressional elections and shorten his presidential term, which is
due to end in 1989.
Stocks fall after Tuesday's rally
NEW YORK — Stock prices slumped yesterday after Tuesday's
strong rally faded.
Tuesday's advance was attributed largely to falling interest rates in the
credit markets. But rates turned mixed in today's activity.
Today's weather
It will be sunny in the morning with increasing cloudiness in the after
noon and a chance of rain tonight. Today's highs will be in the 60s to low
70s.

'Suspicious' explosion rips tanker
SAN F RANCISCO — Three "highly suspicious" explosions ripped
through a 632-foot petrochemical tanker early yesterday, injuring eight
crewmen and leaving one man missing off the Northern California coast,
the U.S. Coast Guard said.
I'he FBI is investigating the possibility that a bomb was planted on
board the SS Puerto Rican because investigators considered the blasts
"highly suspicious," said Robert Gast, the FBI agent in charge.
Flames from the ship leapt 100 feet into the pre-dawn sky after the ex
plosions hurled at least two burned men into the chilly ocean, Chief
Petty Officer John Hollis said. The men were rescued and taken to Let
terman Hospital.
"It was such a violent explosion that it just peeled 50 feet of the deck
right back." Gast said. "It is unusual that an explosion would affect the
ship in that way. These are all factors that give rise to speculation" that a
bomb was on board.
The Puerto Rican was embroiled in a nationwide dispute between the
Masters, Mates and Pilots Union and five shipping companies last week
when it was left stranded inside the Oakland Estuary.
Coast Guard firefighters yesterday battled the flames for six hours but
had to abandon the ship when the blaze erupted again. Public Affairs
Officer Brad Terrill said.
A commercial tugboat towed the flaming vessel seven miles farther
out to sea to reduce the environmental damage a spill might cause if the
ship sinks, Hollis said.
"There's still a possibility that it could go down," he said. "The farther
out (the ship is taken) the better."
The 20,295-ton ship, owned by Keystone Shipping of Philadelphia,
was carrying lube oils, fuel additives, butane and other petrochemicals,
Hollis said.
Diablo Canyon injunction lifted
WASHINGTON — The U.S. Court of Appeals yesterday lifted its
seven-week injunction blocking the commercial operation of the Diablo
Canyon nuclear plant near San Luis Obispo.
The order frees the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to issue a full
power license for the first of two reactors at the $5.1 billion atomic plant,
which has become a nationwide symbol of the controversy over nuclear
power.
Joseph Fouchard, an NRC spokesman, said the the agency "is
working on the license and it could be issued sometime this week."
The five-member commission approved the full-power operating
license for Diablo Canyon on Aug. 2 in a 3-1 vote after the facility had
been delayed for more than a decade by earthquake fears and design
flaws.
However, in a response to a suit by opponents that not all of the po
tential earthquake problems had been adequately addressed, the Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia two weeks later issued a stay
preventing the commission from actually issuing the license.
The court issued an order late yesterday lifting the stay after hearing
90 minutes of oral arguments on the case, including new accusations that
the commission had improperly handled concerns that an earthquake
might hamper the evacuation of a 10-mile area around the plant in an
accident.
Soviets say CIA supports Sikhs
MOSCOW — Within hours of the assassination of Indian Prime Mini
ster Indira Gandhi, the Soviet news media yesterday renewed their
charge that the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency supports Sikh ex
tremists.
The state-run press and radio stopped short of accusing the United
States of involvement in the slaying, however, and a senior government
spokesman said it was up to India to decide who committed the crime.
But Pravda, the Communist Party newspaper, said in a story printed
