## 
### 
In New Delhi yesterday, Rajiv
Gandhi was sworn in as prime mini
ster shortly after an official an
nouncement confirmed to a shocked
nation that his mother, Indira
Gandhi, had been assassinated In
three of her security guards.
The 40-year-old son. who had
rushed from east India to the capital,
was sworn in earlier in the day, ap
parently during a five-hour delay be
tween his mother's death and the offi
cial announcement of it by the gov
ernment, the United News of India
(UNI) reported.
The younger Gandhi thus becomes
the third generation of the Nehru
family to take power, after the first
prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru, and
Gandhi, who presided for nearly lb
years over the turbulent nation's des
tiny.
The new prime minister appealed
last night to the people of India to ex
ercise maximum restraint as riots
were reported from all over the
country in the wake of the assassina
tion.
In a two-minute broadcast to the
nation shortly before midnight — his
first as the country's sixth prime mini
ster — Rajiv Gandhi urged the
people not to let "our emotions get
the better of us, because passion
would cloud judgment."
While messages of condolence and
shock poured in from world leaders,
militant Sikhs outside India hailed the
assassination as a justified act of ven
geance for Gandhi's having ordered
the storming of the Sikh Golden
Temple in Amritsar last June.

Doctors at the All India Institute of
Medical Sciences said Ghandi was
shot 16 times in the chest, abdomen
and thigh. She died 19 days before
her 67th birthday.
Violence rocks country
The Indian army enforced curfews
in 11 cities today in a bid to contain
Hindu-Sikh violence while more than
a half-million mourners, many chant
ing "Long live Indira Gandhi,"
surged past the flag-draped body of
their assassinated leader.
At least three people were re
ported killed and 60 wounded as
crowds of Hindus roamed streets in
New Delhi and cities across northern
India, setting fire to cars or shops and
dragging Sikhs from their homes and
beating them to revenge the killing of
the prime minister by Sikh members
of her security guard.
In New Delhi, fires flared across
the city. One reporter saw a crowd
strip a Sikh man naked, beat him and
chase him down the street.
Army troops moved into five police
stations in New Delhi, and witnesses
said police used tear gas against at
least one mob in the capital. Shoot
to-kill orders were issued in the
northeast city of Patna to deter
rioting.
The assassination was claimed by
anonymous Sikh extremists as
revenge for the Indian army attack on
the Sikh Golden Temple to flush out
Sikh separatists in Punjab province
last June. The Sikhs number 13 mil
lion in the predominantly Hindu na

tion of 730 million.
Rajiv Ghandi, appearing outside
the building in which his mother's
body lies in state, admonished
mourners to stop chanting the slogan
"Blood for blood."
"Nothing would hurt the soul ot
our beloved Indira Gandhi more than
the occurrence of violence in any part
of the country," he said. Some fell
silent, but most igored him.
Reagan visits Indian Embassy
In Washington yesterday. Presi
dent Reagan briefly visited a somber
and subdued Indian Embassy to con
vey personal condolences on the
death of Gandhi, telling Indian Am
bassador K. Shankar Bajpai that "no
words can express" his feelings.
During his five-minute visit to the
embassy shortly after 10 a.m., the
president was ushered into a tirst
floor reception room where he was
the first to sign a condolence book,
which sat next to a framed photo
graph of Gandhi on a table draped in
black cloth.
Indians in California react
Cookies of celebration were passed
out in San Francisco while sermons ot
mourning were delivered in Los An
geles as Indians throughout Califor
nia reacted with passion to Gandhi's
assassination.
"Most Sikhs today feel the way the
Jews felt when Hitler died. We feel
that she, too, was guilty of genocide,"

said Sukhmindr Chahal, a Sikh en
gineer in the San Joaquin County
Public Works Department.
Tens of thousands of Indians, many
of them Sikhs, reside in California.
But even within the religious commu
nity. reaction was extreme.
"This is human insanity. It's not a
matter of joy. More innocent people
will be killed. Please don't take
revenge," Siri Singh Sahib Yogi
Bhajan. a Sikh minister, told his Los
Angeles congregation yesterday
morning.
Gandhi's assassination followed
violence between the Indian army
and the Sikhs. In June, the army
overran the Golden lemple, the
Sikhs' holiest place of worship, which
the government said was the base
for a terror campaign aimed at form
ing a separate state. Some reports put
the number of Sikhs killed at more
than 1.000, but some Sikhs claimed
the figure was closer to 2,500.
"There will be great celebration in
India. All of the Sikh people wanted
to kill her. I wish I had done it," said
Sohan Dillon, a Turlock farmworker
and retired Indian officer.
But Narinder Kapany, chairman of
the Sikh Foundation, USA, in Palo
Alto, said, "We extend our con
dolences to Mrs. Gandhi's family and
friends and we hope that in the com
ing days and months, India can pull
itself together and avoid further vio
lence and bloodshed."
