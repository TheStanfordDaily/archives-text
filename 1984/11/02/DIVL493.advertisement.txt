Good journalism means more than good
reporting and good editing. It means
good layout, too. It means not leaving
ugly vertical spaces to fill with
ridiculous drivel.
We're pros at The Daily. We don't leave
room for mistakes. We don't leave room
for approximations. We don't leave
room when we have nothing to say.
If you think you meet our standards, if
you think you can work with the
efficiency and precision of Daily
staffers, if you think you cut the muster,
then you belong among us.
The Daily. More than just a refuge from
the academic world.
