### CLINT HIGHFILL Senior staff writer 
A fight between members of the Sigma Chi and Beta
Theta Pi fraternities early this morning resulted in the
arrest of a Stanford student.
Junior Dan Ballesteros, a Beta member, was ar
rested and charged with assault and battery, according
to a policeman at the scene.
According to Sigma Chi President Mike Llerandi, a
member of his fraternity said he would press charges
because of injuries the fraternity member received
after a fight over the alleged theft of a keg of beer from
the Sigma Chi house. The incident, which drew about
100 spectators and two police cars, took place between
midnight and 1 a.m.
Several Betas allegedly stole the keg from a party
being held at the Sigma Chi house, and three Sigma
Chis went to the Beta house to negotiate its return, ac
cording to Llerandi.
Before the Sigma Chis succeeded in obtaining the
keg, a fight broke out between Sigma Chi and Beta
members, according to Eric Croft, a Beta member who
said he witnessed the scene. Llerandi said he received a
blow to the mouth in tho nitcrcution.

By the time Llerandi got the keg and started back to
the house, an angry crowd of Sigma Chis had gathered
on the Beta house lawn to demand the return of their
keg, witnesses said.
The arrest resulted from this altercation, witnesses
said.
"It was mostly yelling and a couple of thrown
punches," Croft said. "Scattered punches were traded,
but there was no real fighting."
In the process though, one Sigma Chi had his hand
gashed, allegedly by Ballesteros. When the police
arrived, the wounded Sigma Chi member said he
would press charges against his assailant. Several on
lookers said the Sigma Chi member had been bitten on
the hand, but no Sigma Chi members would confirm
the fact.
"Nobody is willing to say he was bitten," said
Llerandi, "He went to a doctor to get it looked at."
Beta members declined to comment on the incident.
"We'd rather not create any animosity," said Beta
house Resident Assistant Mike Melendez.
Many present at the scene this morning said they

were anxious to downplay the signifi
cance of the event.
"I hope it's the end of it," said
Llerandi. "It was an incident between
two individuals â€” not an incident be
tween the two houses."
But "one individual does something
of his own accord, and that implicates
the whole (fraternity) system," he
added.
Sigma Chi Jay Vavra expressed
concern that the event would be
blown out of proportion. The Univer
sity gets concerned with "something
like this when it's reported and it
becomes a big deal," he said.
