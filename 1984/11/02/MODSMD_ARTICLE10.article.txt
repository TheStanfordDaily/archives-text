## Mob violence sweeps India 
### 
NEW DELHI, India — At least
115 persons died and hundreds were
injured as mob violence directed
against the Sikh community swept
across India yesterday in the wake of
Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's assas
sination.
In New Delhi alone, 60 deaths
were reported by the United News of
India news agency. The government
ordered a 24-hour curfew here and in
29 other cities.
Furious crowds pulled Sikhs from
buses and cars, dragged them from
buildings and stabbed and beat them
in vengeance for the killing of Gandhi
by Sikh members of her bodyguard.
Homes, shops and hotels were set
ablaze, devastating parts of the capi
tal.
Police and army reinforcements,
helplessly outnumbered, did little to
counter the mobs.
There were reports of an exchange
of gunfire between paramilitary
forces and Sikhs, who took refuge
inside their temple a stone's throw
from the Parliament building. Offi
cials refused to give any details about
the incident.
Home Secretary Manmohan Kis
hen Wali asserted that the situation
was "under control" in most places or
"going to be under control soon."
He said the people were undergo
ing "tremendous trauma" in the wake
of the death of a leader "who was
something more than a mere prime
minister."
Wali did admit that at least half of
India's 22 states and provinces had
seen incidents of stabbing, arson and
plundering during the past two days.
The former leader's son, Rajiv
Gandhi, plunged into deep crisis as
fledgling prime minister, ordered the
sternest possible measures to bring
the situation under control, authori
ties said.

Even as Wali was briefing the
press, vehicles were being set ablaze
on the street outside the government
press office.
The capital was littered with
burned-out and battered vehicles.
Frightened Sikhs sought refuge in the
homes of foreigners. Others besieged
barbers to cut off their hair and shave
off their beards so they could escape
mob assaults.
Thousands View Body
Benumbed and in mourning yester
day, tens of thousands of Indians con
verged on the capital, where Gandhi's
body lay in state at the palatial Teen
Murti (Three Statues) House, once
the official residence of her father
and India's first prime minister,
Jawaharlal Nehru.
"Indira Amma (mother) is no
more," they whispered, almost un
believingly, in villages, towns and
cities as news of hef assassination
Wednesday filtered to the remotest
corners of India.
Her body, covered with roses and
marigolds and draped in the national
tricolor, lay on a raised platform. It
was flanked by her son and other
members of her family.
The former leader's face bore some
evidence of the violent death she suf
fered. Her lips were pursed, and faint
traces of blood were visible on her
cheeks.
Cabinet ministers and members of
Parliament lined up alongside ordi
nary citizens to pay their final
respects. Many clutched flowers,
which Gandhi was especially fond of.
Crowds surged to catch a glimpse
of the body as it was carried on a gun
carriage from the former leader's of
ficial residence to lie in state.
At one stage, the situation seemed
to be getting out of control and Rajiv

Gandhi was forced to come out and
chide security officers. "Please try to
control them," he said. "Why do you
want to burn your fingers again?"
The jittery guards were jeered by
mourners, who blamed them for the
assassination. Said one officer: "We
are helpless. People are not listening
to us anymore."
Soviets Hint at CIA Involvement
The Soviet press yesterday hinted
broadly at CIA involvement in
Gandhi's assassination.
The press accounts made no direct
accusations but said pointedly that
"reactionary forces" were behind the
murder in New Delhi.
These references were combined
with articles accusing the CIA of ar
ranging other assassinations around
the world and together pointed to an
attempt by the Soviet propaganda
machine to insinuate U.S. complicity
in Gandhi's death.
The most direct connection was
drawn in art article in yesterday's
Pravda, the Communist Party daily,
appearing under the headline
"Terrorism — the Politics of Wash
ington," which repeated charges that
"large-scale CIA activities" had sup
ported Sikh separatists in an opera
tion named the "Brahmaputra Proj
ect." Indian newspapers have re
ported that the assassination was
carried out by Sikh extremists who
have been battling the government in
the state of Punjab.
"It is noteworthy that the U.S. Em
bassy in New Delhi most actively sup
ported the separatist movement in
Punjab state," Pravda said yesterday.
The Soviets have made no accusa
tions in their official statements, al
though a message from the Soviet
leadership to Indian President Zail
Singh vaguely condemned the

"patrons' of the assassins.
While the official stance has been
circumspect, Soviet reporting from
India has elaborated on the theme of
a foreign-backed conspiracy, des
cribed by the news agency Tass as an
attempt "to destabilize the situation in
India and split the unity of the Indian
nation." Tass reported that
demonstrations took place yesterday
outside U.S. consulates in Calcutta
and Madras and noted that in Madras
protesters "blamed the Central Intel
ligence Agency of the U.S.A. and its
agents in India for Indira Gandhi's
death."
U.S. Calls Allegations 'Absurd'
In response to the Soviet media ac
counts linking the CIA to the assas
sination, the U.S. government yester
day reproved the Kremlin and ac
cussed it of endangering the lives of
Americans in India.
Formal protest notes were
delivered both in Washington and
Moscow branding as "outrageous . ..
absurd and irresponsible" the reports
in the government-controlled Soviet
press, State Department spokesman
Alan Romberg said.
Leaving Washington at the start of
a campaign trip, President Reagan
was asked if the Soviets would try to
exploit the assassination. "I think
that's always a danger with regard to
the Soviets," he replied, but did not
elaborate.
Reacting to the Soviet press
reports, Romberg said: "We strongly
resent the Soviet allegations that the
U.S., and specifically the CIA, were
involved in or inspired this act of poli
tical terrorism."
