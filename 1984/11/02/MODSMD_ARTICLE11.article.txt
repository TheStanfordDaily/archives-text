## Journalist portrays Afghanistan crisis 
### KURT JOHNSON 
Steve Raymer, a staff photog
rapher for National Geographic mag
azine, says he evaded bombs and bul
lets during his recent six-day trip to
Afghanistan, but he still discovered
"many lovely things" about Kabul.
Raymer discussed his Afghanistan
experiences yesterday at the Bechtel
International Center.
His trip was dangerous from the
outset. While waiting for his luggage
in the airport at Kabul, the capital
city, a bomb exploded nearby, killing
several dozen people in the airport.
Raymer explained that the airport is,
"for all practical purposes, a Soviet
airbase," making it a target for the
rebels.
According to Raymer, Kabul main
tains an outside guise of prosperity
complete with Coca-Cola and Calvin
Klein jeans; at the same time it
remains a "city in the midst of revolu
tion." For the Soviets, the "streets of
Kabul can be a pretty dangerous
place to be." Almost every night the
rebels begin shelling, eventually
provoking the Soviets to send out
helicopter gunships.
Nevertheless, "except for the
nightime pyrotechnics, you don't
have the feeling of a city at war," and
there's actually "many lovely things
about the city," he said.
However, sources of information
were very difficult to find, he said.
"We found the only place to talk to
people the government didn't want us
to talk to was at the bazaar, where the
guides were sometimes distracted,
and where people were quite willing
to speak with us once they found out
we were American.
"We played up to their stereotype

of filthy-rich Americans," he said,
feigning desire to buy more
souvenirs, in order to make frequent
trips to the bazaar.
Explaining what the Soviets might
have expected to gain by allowing two
National Geographic journalists into
Afghanistan, Raymer said that per
haps it was to "show us that they at
least had Kabul under control." He
added that the Soviets were embar
rassed that he had been in the airport
when the bombing took place, and
that there was an overall
"embarrassment on their part that we
saw as much fighting as we did." He
noted that they could occasionally see
fighting from their hotel balcony.
He said that in Kabul itself, food is
plentiful, while in the countryside
there is a "tremendous food
shortage" due to "frequent and bru
tal Soviet crop destruction pro
grams."
He also described how the Soviets
had reorganized the educational sys
tem, cutting the number of school
years, adding required courses in
Marxism, and sending large numbers
of young Afghans to the Soviet Union
for further schooling.
Asked about the compliance of the
Afghans, Raymer explained that "it's
game-playing in order to survive."
"They can't get people to work for
the government," he said, citing a
high vacancy rate in the civil service.
Overall, the Soviets "appear to be
terribly bogged down" and "no closer
to achieving their initial political ob
jectives," he said.
"It's difficult not to make some
comparisons with the American ex
perience in Vietnam," he said.
