# Panel blasts Reagan
## 
### JACK ALDEN Staff writer 
"Ronald Reagan is driving into the
future while looking into the rearview
mirror," said Cecilia Burciaga, a
panel member last night at Branner
Hall's political forum, "What's At
Stake in '84."
The panel included Coit Blacker,
associate director at the Stanford
Center for International Security and
Arms Control; Burciaga, associate
dean of Graduate Studies and a
major figure in national Hispanic or
ganizations; Robert Hamerton-Kelly,
dean of the chapel; and Thomas
Mcßride, associate dean at the law
school, Watergate prosecutor and
perennial political appointee. Each

panel member agreed with Burciaga's
statements about Reagan.
Blacker opened his remarks by
quoting a recent Field poll that said
Reagan is likely to carry 47 to 50
states on Tuesday. This is due to
people voting for their pocketbooks
despite their fears of Reagan's
foreign and defense policies, Blacker
said.
To compound this effect, he con
tinued, "both candidates have been
incoherent" in explaining their posi
tions during this campaign. Many is
sues have not emerged yet because of
this muddled discussion, Blacker said,
and only a major crisis could make
the issues apparent before the elec
tion.

Hamerton-Kelly discussed the role
of religion in the election. "If this
world is destroyed, it will be by
mistake or by religion," he said.
Hamerton-Kelly concentrated on the
"Falwell Factor," or Reagan's sup
port of and by the Protestant right.
He also mentioned the Catholic
Church hierarchy's attacks on New
York Governor Mario Cuomo and
vice-presidential candidate Geral
dine Ferraro.
While "religion and politics have
never been separated and never will
be separated," Hamerton-Kelly said,
the Reagan administration's view on
religion in politics is limited to school

prayer and abortion. This tunnel vi
sion ignores poverty, Central
America, CIA covert wars and the
urgency of arms control, Hamerton-
Kelly said, all of which are issues that
"Reagan has been deafeningly silent
on from a religious viewpoint."
Hamerton-Kelly went on to
criticize Archbishop John O'Connor
of New York for criticizing Ferraro
and Cuomo on their stands on abor
tion as Catholic legislators.
Hamerton-Kelly noted that Thomas
Aquinas said canon laws should not
be made into civil laws.
O'Connor, Hamerton-Kelly said, is
telling Catholic legislators if they do
not follow Church policy in national
politics, "they are taking chances with
their immortal souls." Hamerton-
Kelly finished by saying the
"assumption that God is on anyone's
side is a joke."
Reagan still believes in
Dick, Jane, Spot and mom in the
kitchen, even though this ideal is only
true for 17 percent of the United
States' population, Burciaga said.
Furthermore, during Reagan's ad
ministration there has been a renais
sance of racism and the positions of
women and minorities in society have
declined, Burciaga said. All of these
conditions will worsen if Reagan
remains in office, she added.
The administration does not
believe there is poverty or hunger in
America, Burciaga said, and it has
drastically cut aid that would help
destitute women and children. In ad
dition, the administration has helped
foster racist attitudes in this country
through its support of the Simpson-
Mazzoli bill, the English-only elec
tion material amendment and the
recent "last-hired, first-fired" deci
sion by the Supreme Court that helps
negate the effects of affirmative ac
tion.
Mcßride closed the discussion by
playing devil's advocate and pretend
ing to support Reagan. He outlined
all of Reagan's policies and analyzed
' their effects. While Reagan may have
accomplished some goals such as re
ducing inflation, cutting taxes, return
ing power to the states and getting
government off business' backs,
Mcßride said, all of these were at the
cost of social programs and issues.
But Mcßride felt that even if
Reagan is elected, the situation in the
United States will not be intolerable.
