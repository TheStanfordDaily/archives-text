# Panel blasts Reagan
## 
### JACK ALDEN Staff writer 
"Ronald Reagan is driving into the
future while looking into the rearview
mirror," said Cecilia Burciaga, a
panel member last night at Branner
Hall's political forum, "What's At
Stake in '84."
The panel included Coit Blacker,
associate director at the Stanford
Center for International Security and
Arms Control; Burciaga, associate
dean of Graduate Studies and a
major figure in national Hispanic or
ganizations; Robert Hamerton-Kelly,
dean of the chapel; and Thomas
Mc√üride, associate dean at the law
school, Watergate prosecutor and
perennial political appointee. Each

panel member agreed with Burciaga's
statements about Reagan.
Blacker opened his remarks by
quoting a recent Field poll that said
Reagan is likely to carry 47 to 50
states on Tuesday. This is due to
people voting for their pocketbooks
despite their fears of Reagan's
foreign and defense policies, Blacker
said.
To compound this effect, he con
tinued, "both candidates have been
incoherent" in explaining their posi
tions during this campaign. Many is
sues have not emerged yet because of
this muddled discussion, Blacker said,
and only a major crisis could make
the issues apparent before the elec
tion.

Hamerton-Kelly discussed the role
of religion in the election. "If this
world is destroyed, it will be by
mistake or by religion," he said.
Hamerton-Kelly concentrated on the
"Falwell Factor," or Reagan's sup
port of and by the Protestant right.
He also mentioned the Catholic
Church hierarchy's attacks on New
York Governor Mario Cuomo and
vice-presidential candidate Geral
dine Ferraro.
While "religion and politics have
never been separated and never will
be separated," Hamerton-Kelly said,
the Reagan administration's view on
religion in politics is limited to school
