## The
						Stanford Daily ASSU gobbledygook 
### 
"The nominal amount collected in support of
each Capital Fee shall be no larger than the maxi
mum annual amount approved by the Associa
tion, adjusted for any decrease in the purchasing
power of the dollar from the time the Fee was ap
proved to the present."
"The total amount may be contingent on the
success or failure of one or more Special Fee re
quests on the ballot in the Spring quarter general
election, provided that both any contingent
amounts and the non-contingent or base amount
are approved by the Senate prior to the election,
in accordance with the provisions of this Sec
tion."
Don't feel bad if you don't recognize these sen
tences. The proposed amendments on this week's
ASSU Special Election ballot made tiresome fare
for the most diligent of readers.
If you couldn't understand any of the constitu
tional amendments or referendums, don't feel
bad at all. Unless bureaucratic-legalese
gobbledygook becomes our primary language, we
cannot be expected to fathom the meaning of

much of what the ASSU says or writes.
And nor should we be.
We were never taught ASSU-ese in our
elementary schools. The SATs didn't make us an
swer questions based on confusing and badly
written passages. The Stanford application for
admission didn't even attempt to measure our
legislation-reading aptitude.
The fact is, most Stanford students have grown
up using a language other than ASSU-ese. It
doesn't make sense for those of us whose native
language is, say, English, to be forced to use bal
lots with no English translation.
If we want students to vote in an election in
which they actually understand the issues, an
English-ballot alternative is only fair.
Be it resolved, then, by The Stanford Daily Ed
itorial Board that all sections, subsections and
paragraphs of the Constitution of the Associated
Students of Stanford University be adopted as
part of the English language, which most Stan
ford students can understand.
