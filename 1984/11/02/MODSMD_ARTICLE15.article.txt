## Sit down and discuss the issues of this election 
### 
This letter is prompted by a conversation I
overheard, in which two Democrats were con
gratulating themselves over the recent poll
result: Mondale had a 12-percent lead over
President Reagan among undergraduates at
Stanford. If someone asked me (and no one
has), 1 would say this is a pretty embarrassing
statistic. Even among sophomores, juniors

VIEWPOINT

and seniors, Mondale only leads by about 22
percent. And among frosh, Reagan actually
leads by something like a 20-percent margin
(At the risk of sounding arrogant, this is pos
sibly because many freshmen are just begin
ning to develop the independent critical
thinking processes necessary in Stanford's
competitive environment).
If Mondale can't win at least two-thirds of
the vote in a community which represents one
of the most highly educated and motivated
sectors in this country, this could be a dis
astrous election.
What's gone wrong? I can hear the excuses
already:
"Thirty-two percent of undergrads are Re
publican." So what. While registering voters
this summer, 1 talked to quite a few
Republicans who said they wouldn't vote for
Reagan.
"Mondale's not a very exciting candidate."
That's too bad. We're not choosing a cheer
leader. We're electing a president.
What's gone wrong is that we haven't
forced enough people to sit down and face the
issues. We've held rallies that make us feel
good, but we haven't taken the issues to the
people. Sure, we've had educational events,
but 80 percent of the people who came to

hear former CIA official John Stockwell, for
example, already knew that the CIA
promotes terrorism. They're already voting
against Reagan.
We have to sit down with our friends and
neighbors, one at a time if necessary, and go
down the list. It is the young people of this
country whose lives will be most affected by
the outcome on Nov. 6, because they will live
(or not live) with its consequences the longest.
What issues should we discuss?
1. The environment. Damage to our natural
surroundings is difficult and expensive to
reverse and is often permanent. The Reagan
administration has slashed the budget of the
Environmental Protection Agency and ap
pointed two extreme anti-environmentalists
(James Watt and Anne Burford) to the high
est environmental posts in the federal govern
ment. Watt has justified the plunder of our
resources by suggesting that Armageddon
may be around the corner anyway.
Mondale is endorsed by every major envi
ronmental group in the country. Cognizant of
the current threat, even the normally non
partisan Sierra Club is endorsing Mondale.
2. Central America. By now, most people
around here already know that the Reagan
administration is using the CIA to train the
contras, operating along Nicaragua's border,
in terrorist tactics. Also, because no evidence
of weapons flows has been found over the
past three years, the administration has
practically stopped using that excuse for ter
rorizing the people in northern Nicaragua.
Yet, since we at home have yet to feel the ad
verse effects of this policy, most people don't
really care. Most people don't vote on the
basis of moral issues.
It's more effective to appeal to people's sel-

fish instincts. Explain to these voters that if
Reagan is re-elected, this war is going to
widen. It was just leaked last week that the
administration has plans to begin military ex
ercises inside El Salvador in December.
(That's New Speak for U.S. combat troops
entering the war zone. It's like Vietnam all
over again.) A widening of that war is going to
bring a tremendous strain on the social fabric
of this country, given the current level of
public and congressional opposition to the ad
ministration's not-so-secret dirty war.
The Vietnam War cost about $267 billion,
not to mention years of inflation and the
rollercoaster economy of the 19705. A war in
Central America means higher taxes, higher
deficits and/or higher inflation. One way or
another, it comes out of our pockets.
3. Arms Control/Race. Most students prob
ably know that Reagan has opposed every
major nuclear arms agreement, even those
negotiated by Republican presidents. It's
probably not worth repeating that Reagan
thought submarine-launched missiles could
be recalled, since by now he must know it's
not true. Besides, he's got "Cap the Knife"
Weinberger to tell him what to do.
4. On the issue of space weapons, don't
bother talking about the fact that financing an
arms race in space will leave hundreds of bil
lions in additional debt on the backs of young
people and their children. The point is moot.
If there is such an arms race, we most likely
won't be around long enough to pay for it.
Most experts outside the administration
believe that starting such a race will only
make the United States less secure, and the
danger of nuclear annihilation more likely. If
this argument isn't convincing enough, then
forget this issue.

5. Armageddon. Don't bother talking
about Reagan's preoccupation with Ar
mageddon/nuclear holocaust. Attacking his
philosophy is like attacking his personality. 1
People have a propensity for believing what
they want to believe and only what they want
to believe. Most young people who are still
considering voting for Reagan are probably
doing so because they like his personality. If
you attack that, no one will listen to you.
6. Civil Rights. Most Stanford students are
too young to understand the importance of
the civil-rights movement for minorities in this
country, but give it a shot anyway. Mondale's
record on civil rights is one of his strongest as
sets. He has consistently fought for civil rights
throughout his career.
Reagan is on record for opposing every civil
rights law, including the 1964 Civil Rights
Act, the 1965 Voting Rights Act and the
1968 Fair Housing Law. It was probably his
record on this issue that earned him the rare
endorsement of the Ku Klux Klan during both
the 1980 and 1984 campaigns.
7. Big Government. Despite his rhetoric,
Reagan is clearly the candidate of big govern
ment. He has tried to institute mandatory
prayer back in the public schools; he will con
tinue to push for an amendment to outlaw
abortion. Reagan has also taken many actions
which infringe upon our civil liberties and the
free flow of information.
In order to limit dissent and democratic
debate around his Central American policy,
for example, he issued a secrecy order which
would force thousands of government officials
to pre-clear anything they write or speak
about publicly, even after they leave office.
(The order has been temporarily withdrawn

due to the public outcry led by the American
Civil Liberties Union.) Reagan's Executive
Order No. 12356 lets the government classify
a document as secret even if no specific iden
tifiable damage to our national security would
result from its release.
8. The Economy. The economy has gone up
and down throughout history and will con
tinue to do so. Under Reagan, we experi
enced the worst recession since the Great
Depression. We also experienced a reason
ably strong recovery. Now, growth has
dropped to 2.7 percent in the third quarter,
and some signals indicate the slowing will
continue.
The only way in which Reagan has affected
our economy in a semi-permanent way is by
shifting the emphasis of production toward
the military sector, away from consumer
goods, and by shifting the financing of gov
ernment spending from the present to the
future.
One parting shot: Under Ronald Reagan,
the poverty rate has increased to 15.2 per
cent, the highest level in 18 years. More than
one in five children is growing up in poverty,
and in many regions infant mortality is at
levels comparable to poor Third-World na
tions.
Well, that should get the conversation
started. No one asked me, but I'd say that if
graduate students vote 3-to-l for Mondale,
sophomores, juniors and seniors vote 2-to-l
for Mondale, and freshmen split half-and
half, I think we can consider our mission a
success.

the military sector, away from consumer
goods, and by shifting the financing of gov
ernment spending from the present to the
future.
One parting shot: Under Ronald Reagan,
the poverty rate has increased to 15.2 per
cent, the highest level in 18 years. More than
one in five children is growing up in poverty,
and in many regions infant mortality is at
levels comparable to poor Third-World na
tions.
Well, that should get the conversation
started. No one asked me, but I'd say that if
graduate students vote 3-to-l for Mondale,
sophomores, juniors and seniors vote 2-to-l
for Mondale, and freshmen split half-and
half, I think we can consider our mission a
success.
(Steve Sharpe is a graduate student in econom
ics.)
This letter is prompted by a conversation I
overheard, in which two Democrats were con
gratulating themselves over the recent poll
result: Mondale had a 12-percent lead over
President Reagan among undergraduates at
Stanford. If someone asked me (and no one
has), 1 would say this is a pretty embarrassing
statistic. Even among sophomores, juniors

VIEWPOINT

and seniors, Mondale only leads by about 22
percent. And among frosh, Reagan actually
leads by something like a 20-percent margin
(At the risk of sounding arrogant, this is pos
sibly because many freshmen are just begin
ning to develop the independent critical
thinking processes necessary in Stanford's
competitive environment).
If Mondale can't win at least two-thirds of
the vote in a community which represents one
of the most highly educated and motivated
sectors in this country, this could be a dis
astrous election.
What's gone wrong? I can hear the excuses
already:
"Thirty-two percent of undergrads are Re
publican." So what. While registering voters
this summer, 1 talked to quite a few
Republicans who said they wouldn't vote for
Reagan.
"Mondale's not a very exciting candidate."
That's too bad. We're not choosing a cheer
leader. We're electing a president.
What's gone wrong is that we haven't
forced enough people to sit down and face the
issues. We've held rallies that make us feel
good, but we haven't taken the issues to the
people. Sure, we've had educational events,
but 80 percent of the people who came to

hear former CIA official John Stockwell, for
example, already knew that the CIA
promotes terrorism. They're already voting
against Reagan.
We have to sit down with our friends and
neighbors, one at a time if necessary, and go
down the list. It is the young people of this
country whose lives will be most affected by
the outcome on Nov. 6, because they will live
(or not live) with its consequences the longest.
What issues should we discuss?
1. The environment. Damage to our natural
surroundings is difficult and expensive to
reverse and is often permanent. The Reagan
administration has slashed the budget of the
Environmental Protection Agency and ap
pointed two extreme anti-environmentalists
(James Watt and Anne Burford) to the high
est environmental posts in the federal govern
ment. Watt has justified the plunder of our
resources by suggesting that Armageddon
may be around the corner anyway.
Mondale is endorsed by every major envi
ronmental group in the country. Cognizant of
the current threat, even the normally non
partisan Sierra Club is endorsing Mondale.
2. Central America. By now, most people
around here already know that the Reagan
administration is using the CIA to train the
contras, operating along Nicaragua's border,
in terrorist tactics. Also, because no evidence
of weapons flows has been found over the
past three years, the administration has
practically stopped using that excuse for ter
rorizing the people in northern Nicaragua.
Yet, since we at home have yet to feel the ad
verse effects of this policy, most people don't
really care. Most people don't vote on the
basis of moral issues.
It's more effective to appeal to people's sel-

fish instincts. Explain to these voters that if
Reagan is re-elected, this war is going to
widen. It was just leaked last week that the
administration has plans to begin military ex
ercises inside El Salvador in December.
(That's New Speak for U.S. combat troops
entering the war zone. It's like Vietnam all
over again.) A widening of that war is going to
bring a tremendous strain on the social fabric
of this country, given the current level of
public and congressional opposition to the ad
ministration's not-so-secret dirty war.
The Vietnam War cost about $267 billion,
not to mention years of inflation and the
rollercoaster economy of the 19705. A war in
Central America means higher taxes, higher
deficits and/or higher inflation. One way or
another, it comes out of our pockets.
3. Arms Control/Race. Most students prob
ably know that Reagan has opposed every
major nuclear arms agreement, even those
negotiated by Republican presidents. It's
probably not worth repeating that Reagan
thought submarine-launched missiles could
be recalled, since by now he must know it's
not true. Besides, he's got "Cap the Knife"
Weinberger to tell him what to do.
4. On the issue of space weapons, don't
bother talking about the fact that financing an
arms race in space will leave hundreds of bil
lions in additional debt on the backs of young
people and their children. The point is moot.
If there is such an arms race, we most likely
won't be around long enough to pay for it.
Most experts outside the administration
believe that starting such a race will only
make the United States less secure, and the
danger of nuclear annihilation more likely. If
this argument isn't convincing enough, then
forget this issue.

5. Armageddon. Don't bother talking
about Reagan's preoccupation with Ar
mageddon/nuclear holocaust. Attacking his
philosophy is like attacking his personality. 1
People have a propensity for believing what
they want to believe and only what they want
to believe. Most young people who are still
considering voting for Reagan are probably
doing so because they like his personality. If
you attack that, no one will listen to you.
6. Civil Rights. Most Stanford students are
too young to understand the importance of
the civil-rights movement for minorities in this
country, but give it a shot anyway. Mondale's
record on civil rights is one of his strongest as
sets. He has consistently fought for civil rights
throughout his career.
Reagan is on record for opposing every civil
rights law, including the 1964 Civil Rights
Act, the 1965 Voting Rights Act and the
1968 Fair Housing Law. It was probably his
record on this issue that earned him the rare
endorsement of the Ku Klux Klan during both
the 1980 and 1984 campaigns.
7. Big Government. Despite his rhetoric,
Reagan is clearly the candidate of big govern
ment. He has tried to institute mandatory
prayer back in the public schools; he will con
tinue to push for an amendment to outlaw
abortion. Reagan has also taken many actions
which infringe upon our civil liberties and the
free flow of information.
In order to limit dissent and democratic
debate around his Central American policy,
for example, he issued a secrecy order which
would force thousands of government officials
to pre-clear anything they write or speak
about publicly, even after they leave office.
(The order has been temporarily withdrawn

due to the public outcry led by the American
Civil Liberties Union.) Reagan's Executive
Order No. 12356 lets the government classify
a document as secret even if no specific iden
tifiable damage to our national security would
result from its release.
8. The Economy. The economy has gone up
and down throughout history and will con
tinue to do so. Under Reagan, we experi
enced the worst recession since the Great
Depression. We also experienced a reason
ably strong recovery. Now, growth has
dropped to 2.7 percent in the third quarter,
and some signals indicate the slowing will
continue.
The only way in which Reagan has affected
our economy in a semi-permanent way is by
shifting the emphasis of production toward
the military sector, away from consumer
goods, and by shifting the financing of gov
ernment spending from the present to the
future.
One parting shot: Under Ronald Reagan,
the poverty rate has increased to 15.2 per

about publicly, even after they leave office.
(The order has been temporarily withdrawn

due to the public outcry led by the American
Civil Liberties Union.) Reagan's Executive
Order No. 12356 lets the government classify
a document as secret even if no specific iden
tifiable damage to our national security would
result from its release.
8. The Economy. The economy has gone up
and down throughout history and will con
tinue to do so. Under Reagan, we experi
enced the worst recession since the Great
Depression. We also experienced a reason
ably strong recovery. Now, growth has
dropped to 2.7 percent in the third quarter,
and some signals indicate the slowing will
continue.
The only way in which Reagan has affected
our economy in a semi-permanent way is by
shifting the emphasis of production toward
the military sector, away from consumer
goods, and by shifting the financing of gov
ernment spending from the present to the
future.
One parting shot: Under Ronald Reagan,
the poverty rate has increased to 15.2 per
cent, the highest level in 18 years. More than
one in five children is growing up in poverty,
and in many regions infant mortality is at
levels comparable to poor Third-World na
tions.
Well, that should get the conversation
started. No one asked me, but I'd say that if
graduate students vote 3-to-l for Mondale,
sophomores, juniors and seniors vote 2-to-l
for Mondale, and freshmen split half-and
half, I think we can consider our mission a
success.
