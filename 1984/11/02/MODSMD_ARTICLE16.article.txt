## Constructive reform needed 
### 
Imagine troops of policemen surrounding the
Stanford campus at 3 a.m. one day. They conduct
an extensive crackdown in all the dorms, search
through our drawers and closets and hold us at bay
with automatic rifles. When they have finished,
they mark our hands with red dye and move on.
Imagine that a few Stanford students were killed
during this search, a few hundred arrested and that
this was all the result of your merely expressing the
desire to participate in the process of governing the
Stanford community. Unimaginable?
This is not very hard for South Africans to imag
ine because it happened to them last month in the
black townships of Sebokeng, Sharpeville and
Bioatang. A total of 80 were killed and more than 300
were arrested. Louis LeGrange, the South African
minister of law and order, claims the purpose of the
raids was to "rid the area of criminal and revolu
tionary elements."
Criminal and revolutionary elements!?! It is
NOT criminal to demand racial equality, and the
revolution in South Africa is long overdue. It does
not have to be a bloody revolution, but as Nobel
Peace Prize winner Bishop Desmond Tutu claims, a
peaceful civil rights revolution in South Africa
depends upon internal as well as international pres
sure for change.
Bishop Tutu embodies the internal pressure for
change. A contribution to the international pres
sure can be made right here on campus. By passing
the divestment referendum, we Stanford students
have begun efforts to apply the necessary interna
tional pressure. We believe the facts have already
been found in the case of Motorola, a company
guilty of not even following the lax Sullivan Prin
ciples, and therefore divestment is in order. The
white South African government is dependent on

foreign firms and lenders who are actually hurting
the black South Africans more than helping them.
These companies sell supplies to the government
and military; they employ more whites than blacks;
and they employ less than 1 percent of the total
black population anyway. We Stanford students
have already shown our support of Bishop Tutu's
assertion that foreign investment in South Africa
"is a moral as well as an economic issue."
Now we can continue our efforts to press for
reform in South Africa by voting for someone who
will prioritize the issue. Walter Mondale does not
support the sale of electric-shock batons to South

Now there is a chance
for hope — Bishop
Tutu's envisioned hope
of ending apartheid.

African police as President Reagan does. Mondale
and the Democratic party stand for and promise to
work toward equality and freedom — in race rela
tions, among the sexes, in religious issues and in
economic opportunity — at home as well as
abroad.
Quite to the contrary, Reagan's policy of
"constructive engagement" has been anything but
constructive. It has not achieved one significant
step toward equal rights there; it has not encour
aged integrated educational programs; it has not
even discouraged the present forced migration of
blacks to the bleak "homelands." South Africa's

claimed reform of allowing Asians and "Coloreds"
limited parliamentary participation is a sham, as
was evidenced in the massive boycott of the elec
tions.
Constructive engagement illustrates Reagan's
hypocrisy in that he refused to speak with the
Soviets for three-and-a-half years, called them an
"evil empire" and joked about outlawing and
bombing them; yet he described the United Na
tions' condemnation of South African raids as ex
cessive and unconstructive. The hypocrisy is further
illustrated when he sends Marines to kill in the
Caribbean and wages nasty covert wars in Central
America — all in the stated effort of establishing
"real" democracies there, yet would not dream of
lifting a hand against South Africa, the sorriest
excuse for a democracy in the world. Why not be
consistent and use "constructive engagement" with
the Soviets, the Grenadans or the Sandinistas?
There is an unjust double standard.
When I used to think of South Africa, I
screamed, I cried, I hated. Apartheid is the ugliest
scar on the face of the earth. Now there is the
chance for hope — Bishop Tutu's envisioned hope
of ending apartheid. He aspires to lead South
Africa toward peaceful revolution just as Martin
Luther King led the revolution in America. Bishop
Tutu was choosen as this year's peace prize
recipient because the Nobel Peace Prize Commit
tee has redefined peace. Egil Aarvik, the com
mmittee chairman, states that, "Real peace is
where people can live in freedom." On Tuesday we
have the chance to elect someone who will strive to
bring real peace to South Africa — Walter
Mondale.

This is not very hard for South Africans to imag
ine because it happened to them last month in the
black townships of Sebokeng, Sharpeville and
Bioatang. A total of 80 were killed and more than 300
were arrested. Louis LeGrange, the South African
minister of law and order, claims the purpose of the
raids was to "rid the area of criminal and revolu
tionary elements."
Criminal and revolutionary elements!?! It is
NOT criminal to demand racial equality, and the
revolution in South Africa is long overdue. It does
not have to be a bloody revolution, but as Nobel
Peace Prize winner Bishop Desmond Tutu claims, a
peaceful civil rights revolution in South Africa
depends upon internal as well as international pres
sure for change.
Bishop Tutu embodies the internal pressure for
change. A contribution to the international pres
sure can be made right here on campus. By passing
the divestment referendum, we Stanford students
have begun efforts to apply the necessary interna
tional pressure. We believe the facts have already
been found in the case of Motorola, a company
guilty of not even following the lax Sullivan Prin
ciples, and therefore divestment is in order. The
white South African government is dependent on

foreign firms and lenders who are actually hurting
the black South Africans more than helping them.
These companies sell supplies to the government
and military; they employ more whites than blacks;
and they employ less than 1 percent of the total
black population anyway. We Stanford students
have already shown our support of Bishop Tutu's
assertion that foreign investment in South Africa
"is a moral as well as an economic issue."
Now we can continue our efforts to press for
reform in South Africa by voting for someone who
will prioritize the issue. Walter Mondale does not
support the sale of electric-shock batons to South

Now there is a chance

of ending apartheid.

African police as President Reagan does. Mondale
and the Democratic party stand for and promise to
work toward equality and freedom — in race rela
tions, among the sexes, in religious issues and in
economic opportunity — at home as well as
abroad.
Quite to the contrary, Reagan's policy of
"constructive engagement" has been anything but
constructive. It has not achieved one significant
step toward equal rights there; it has not encour
aged integrated educational programs; it has not
even discouraged the present forced migration of
blacks to the bleak "homelands." South Africa's

claimed reform of allowing Asians and "Coloreds"
limited parliamentary participation is a sham, as
was evidenced in the massive boycott of the elec
tions.
Constructive engagement illustrates Reagan's
hypocrisy in that he refused to speak with the
Soviets for three-and-a-half years, called them an
"evil empire" and joked about outlawing and
bombing them; yet he described the United Na
tions' condemnation of South African raids as ex
cessive and unconstructive. The hypocrisy is further
illustrated when he sends Marines to kill in the
Caribbean and wages nasty covert wars in Central
America — all in the stated effort of establishing
"real" democracies there, yet would not dream of
lifting a hand against South Africa, the sorriest
excuse for a democracy in the world. Why not be
consistent and use "constructive engagement" with
the Soviets, the Grenadans or the Sandinistas?
There is an unjust double standard.
When I used to think of South Africa, I
screamed, I cried, I hated. Apartheid is the ugliest
scar on the face of the earth. Now there is the
chance for hope — Bishop Tutu's envisioned hope
of ending apartheid. He aspires to lead South
Africa toward peaceful revolution just as Martin
Luther King led the revolution in America. Bishop
Tutu was choosen as this year's peace prize
recipient because the Nobel Peace Prize Commit
tee has redefined peace. Egil Aarvik, the com
mmittee chairman, states that, "Real peace is
where people can live in freedom." On Tuesday we
have the chance to elect someone who will strive to
bring real peace to South Africa — Walter
Mondale.
