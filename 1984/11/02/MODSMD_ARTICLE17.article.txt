Epitaph for Gandhi
The scariest Halloween ever: turn
on the television in the cocooning
warmth of the Communication De
partment and surprise, what is the
pendulous, jowled face of a generic
Asian "expert" doing on Good
Morning America? A ray of hope —
has every communication re
searcher's dream come true? Have
the television magnates woken up to
the fact that there are real countries
skulking behind that nebulous and
well-worn label — the Third World?
But no, the shattering truth is that it

has taken a tragedy, the worst kind
of outrage to catapult India to
prime-time television. Or else why
would news about a country nor
mally relegated to 3 a.m. documen
taries on starving brown babies in
Calcutta confront Americans over
their first bowl of morning cereal?
A mad scramble for a newspaper
— I'm reduced to reading the
Chronicle — what will my friends
think? The headlines scream at me
that assassins have killed Indira
Gandhi, prime minister of India
since 1967. Indira Gandhi, a name
my generation grew up with — the
image of a graceful and sophisticated

diplomat with the signature grey
streak in her hair and the steely
voice, a woman that world leaders
respected, albeit with reserve, regard
ing her administrative policies, the
personification of elegance, dignity
and charm. All that she meant to me
and more has been snuffed out in a
violent and successful murder at
tempt.
Yet another assassination of an
Indian leader in just over a quarter
of a century, the newspapers high
lighting a mockery of national secur
ity and a mockery of martyrdom —
India, darling of Gandhian scholars
and one-time ideal of pacifists,

where are you going to?
An extension of the tragedy, as I
saw today, was the unfortunate truth
of the words of a popular song, it is a
crime to feel too much any one time.
So life at Stanford must go on; one
takes one's alienation and distress,
one's fine anguish and carefully
bundles it up in one's pocket hand
kerchief, for it is midterm time. But I
refuse to engage in "intellectual"
discussions of the situation; I leave
that to political analysts and let this
be my epitaph.
