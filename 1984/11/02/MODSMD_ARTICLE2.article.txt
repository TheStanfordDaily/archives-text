# Baby Fae causes concern
## 
### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER Senior staff writer 
Baby Fae, the infant who received
the heart of a female baboon just a
week ago, appears to be improving
daily but her case continues to raise
medical and ethical questions.
The open heart surgery was per
formed at the Loma Linda University
Medical Center in Southern Califor
nia.
Doctors and administrators at the
Stanford Medical Center are some
what skeptical about the operation
and say there are not any plans for
primate-to-human transplants here.
Such an experimental precedure
would have to go through the hospi
tal's ethics committee, said Lawrence
Crowley, vice president for medical

affairs. "It would be very thoroughly
studied."
And "no one has proposed it to us
yet," he added.
Crowley said the hospital is con
centrating almost solely on human
transplants. "That's the way we're
going right now," he said.
Asked specifically about the Loma
Linda case, Crowley said, "It's pretty
hard to pass judgement from a dis
tance. ... I have to believe that it
(the case) was reviewed" by an ethics
committee.
Norman Shumway, chairman of
cardiovascular surgery at the hospital,
"has said that in about 10 years," pig
hearts may be considered for human
transplants, according to Mike Good

kind, medical center news director.
Randall Morris, a member of the
cardiovascular surgery department at
the hospital, agreed that Baby Fae's
transplant should not "be considered
a major scientific breakthrough."
Morris said the doctors at Loma
Linda have not published papers on
any of their laboratory work on
animal-to-human transplants.
Morris added that cyclosporine, the
drug used to combat infections result
ing from transplants, is "not a perfect
drug." It has "life-threatening side
effects," including viruses, fungi and
malignancies.
Cyclosporine has been in use for
only five years; it supports the
immune system.
