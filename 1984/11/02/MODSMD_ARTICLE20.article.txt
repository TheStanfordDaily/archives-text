## Into the light Speed envisions expanded bookstore 
### KEN McCLAIN 
Every weekday morning at 5:30 a light goes
on in a Fremont home. Eldon Speed, general
manager of the Stanford Bookstore, is begin
ning another day.
By the time he comes into the bookstore,
Speed, who is also president of a Mormon
"stake" (a group of congregations), has per
haps attended a seminary meeting, spoken
with one of the 11 bishops reporting to him
and studied in preparation for a weekly ser
mon.
At the bookstore, Speed oversees an opera
tion that now includes three stores, nearly 200
employees and close to $12.5 million in an
nual revenues. He has served on the Board of
Trustees of the National Association of Col
lege Stores (NACS), presiding over that or
ganization from 1982-83. A book he
co-authored, "The Principles of College
Bookstore Management," is now a standard
textbook for NACS convention seminars.
After work, Speed returns home to inter
view young missionaries, hear from more bis
hops and counsel some of the 5,000 Mormons
in his stake.
To cap it all off, Speed is married and has
five children, ranging in age from eight to 18.
But in spite of his demanding schedule, he al
ways reserves Monday night for his family and
Friday evening for his wife.
Yet Speed feels he could do still more.
"Most of us haven't learned how to fully tap
our potential," he says. Once his extensive
commitment to the church lessens, in fact, he
would like to enter law school. "Not to
become an attorney," he explains, "but to
gain an understanding of the legal system and
to have the clout that the degree carries."
How did Speed become involved with the
university bookstore business? Quite by
chance, actually. As an education major at
Brigham Young University, he had no aspira
tions of becoming a bookstore general
manager, or even of entering the bookselling
trade. One day, however, he realized he was
flat broke and unable to continue school un
less he could find a job or obtain financial aid.
When the school's financial aid office of
fered him neither, he resorted to a "sit-in":
He parked himself in the waiting room to em
phasize the severity of his case.
One day passed. "It was no use going to
classes," he said, "because I knew I'd have to
take a train home unless I could find some
money." Two days passed. People in the of
fice began to wonder why he was still there.
Finally, on the third day of his sit-in, someone
handed him a notice of a job opening in the

college bookstore. He responded to it, got the
job, and began his bookstore career as a
check-casher.
Eventually he was promoted and given re
sponsibility for a small part of the store, or
dering and stocking merchandise. When he
graduated, already married, he applied his
education to a teaching job. After a year, he
gave up teaching to start a sales and market
ing company with two others. This work led
to a position as a sales manager for a medi
cal instruments firm. After five years of hard
work and no vacations, he quit and decided
to take a three-month vacation with his wife.
During this vacation, in 1969, chance again
played a part in determining Speed's future.
While visiting BYU, he ran into the manager

of the BYU bookstore, who was leaving for
the same position at Stanford. Upon discover
ing that his former employee was looking for
a new job, he asked Speed to become the new
assistant manager at the Stanford Bookstore.
Speed, who was born and raised across the
Bay in Oakland, had little trouble accepting
the offer.
After one-and-a-half years, Speed took
over the general manager's position, where he
has remained ever since. During that time the
bookstore has grown from a small, ailing or
ganization to a competitive, well-managed
corporation whose great success belies its
non-profit status.
"Just because the bookstore is a non-profit
organization doesn't mean it has to be run like
one," says Speed. "Sometimes the philosophy
of a non-profit company is to not worry about
turning a profit. But I think the bookstore
should be run as a profit-seeking enterprise,
with the profits being returned to those who
helped earn it."
Speed's philosophy has helped to expand
the campus store to its present size, add both

the medical bookstore downtown and the
Track House at Angell Field and reinstitute
the annual book rebates. The last accomplish
ment is especially noteworthy considering the
expansion the store has undergone since
Speed's arrival.
After 15 years in one place, having
developed a successful, smooth-running oper
ation, one might expect that Speed would be
looking to move to bigger and better things.
In fact, he doesn't even have a resume. "I'm a
small-business man," he explains. "I like to be
able to implement new ideas and see the
results. You can't do that as easily in a big
corporation.
"Also, I like being in a business that pro
vides a service to people. I feel the bookstore

is a valuable adjunct to the University. I tell
the employees that they have the potential to
completely ruin things here. If a textbook isn't
ordered on time, for example, a lot of money
and time is wasted. I'm very pleased to be a
part of an institution of Stanford's caliber."
And where does he go from here? "I have a
vision for the bookstore," he said. "I would
like to see a bookstore that would be one of
the best in the world. I would like to see a
bookstore three to five times bigger than it is
now, with perhaps 500,000 titles instead of
100,000. I've already begun planning it. You
may be able to see the first signs of it within
five to 10 years."
A bookstore the siae of Macy's? Speed
believes it is distinctly possible. And because
he also believes that managing a bookstore,
attending law school, serving his church and
caring for a seven-member family is sparing
his full potential, such a possibility may not be
so unrealistic.
As Mona Wong, the bookstore's personnel
manager, relates, "Everything he touches
here turns to gold."

believes it is distinctly possible. And because
he also believes that managing a bookstore,
attending law school, serving his church and
caring for a seven-member family is sparing
his full potential, such a possibility may not be
so unrealistic.
As Mona Wong, the bookstore's personnel
manager, relates, "Everything he touches
here turns to gold."

Every weekday morning at 5:30 a light goes
on in a Fremont home. Eldon Speed, general
manager of the Stanford Bookstore, is begin
ning another day.
By the time he comes into the bookstore,
Speed, who is also president of a Mormon
"stake" (a group of congregations), has per
haps attended a seminary meeting, spoken
with one of the 11 bishops reporting to him
and studied in preparation for a weekly ser
mon.
At the bookstore, Speed oversees an opera
tion that now includes three stores, nearly 200
employees and close to $12.5 million in an
nual revenues. He has served on the Board of
Trustees of the National Association of Col
lege Stores (NACS), presiding over that or
ganization from 1982-83. A book he
co-authored, "The Principles of College
Bookstore Management," is now a standard
textbook for NACS convention seminars.
After work, Speed returns home to inter
view young missionaries, hear from more bis
hops and counsel some of the 5,000 Mormons
in his stake.
To cap it all off, Speed is married and has
five children, ranging in age from eight to 18.
But in spite of his demanding schedule, he al
ways reserves Monday night for his family and
Friday evening for his wife.
Yet Speed feels he could do still more.
"Most of us haven't learned how to fully tap
our potential," he says. Once his extensive
commitment to the church lessens, in fact, he
would like to enter law school. "Not to
become an attorney," he explains, "but to
gain an understanding of the legal system and
to have the clout that the degree carries."
How did Speed become involved with the
university bookstore business? Quite by
chance, actually. As an education major at
Brigham Young University, he had no aspira
tions of becoming a bookstore general
manager, or even of entering the bookselling
trade. One day, however, he realized he was
flat broke and unable to continue school un
less he could find a job or obtain financial aid.
When the school's financial aid office of
fered him neither, he resorted to a "sit-in":
He parked himself in the waiting room to em
phasize the severity of his case.
One day passed. "It was no use going to
classes," he said, "because I knew I'd have to
take a train home unless I could find some
money." Two days passed. People in the of
fice began to wonder why he was still there.
Finally, on the third day of his sit-in, someone
handed him a notice of a job opening in the

college bookstore. He responded to it, got the
job, and began his bookstore career as a
check-casher.
Eventually he was promoted and given re
sponsibility for a small part of the store, or
dering and stocking merchandise. When he
graduated, already married, he applied his
education to a teaching job. After a year, he
gave up teaching to start a sales and market
ing company with two others. This work led
to a position as a sales manager for a medi
cal instruments firm. After five years of hard
work and no vacations, he quit and decided
to take a three-month vacation with his wife.
During this vacation, in 1969, chance again
played a part in determining Speed's future.
While visiting BYU, he ran into the manager

of the BYU bookstore, who was leaving for
the same position at Stanford. Upon discover
ing that his former employee was looking for
a new job, he asked Speed to become the new
assistant manager at the Stanford Bookstore.
Speed, who was born and raised across the
Bay in Oakland, had little trouble accepting
the offer.
After one-and-a-half years, Speed took
over the general manager's position, where he
has remained ever since. During that time the
bookstore has grown from a small, ailing or
ganization to a competitive, well-managed
corporation whose great success belies its
non-profit status.
"Just because the bookstore is a non-profit
organization doesn't mean it has to be run like
one," says Speed. "Sometimes the philosophy
of a non-profit company is to not worry about
turning a profit. But I think the bookstore
should be run as a profit-seeking enterprise,
with the profits being returned to those who
helped earn it."
Speed's philosophy has helped to expand
the campus store to its present size, add both

the medical bookstore downtown and the
Track House at Angell Field and reinstitute
the annual book rebates. The last accomplish
ment is especially noteworthy considering the
expansion the store has undergone since
Speed's arrival.
After 15 years in one place, having
developed a successful, smooth-running oper
ation, one might expect that Speed would be
looking to move to bigger and better things.
In fact, he doesn't even have a resume. "I'm a
small-business man," he explains. "I like to be
able to implement new ideas and see the
results. You can't do that as easily in a big
corporation.
"Also, I like being in a business that pro
vides a service to people. I feel the bookstore

way, Stanford Bookstore General Manager

loftier plans for the future.

is a valuable adjunct to the University. I tell
the employees that they have the potential to
completely ruin things here. If a textbook isn't
ordered on time, for example, a lot of money
and time is wasted. I'm very pleased to be a
part of an institution of Stanford's caliber."
And where does he go from here? "I have a
vision for the bookstore," he said. "I would
like to see a bookstore that would be one of
the best in the world. I would like to see a
bookstore three to five times bigger than it is
now, with perhaps 500,000 titles instead of
100,000. I've already begun planning it. You
may be able to see the first signs of it within
five to 10 years."
