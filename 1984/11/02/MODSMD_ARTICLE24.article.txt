## USC may Paye price if it looks ahead 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
Never mind that the University of
Southern California Trojans are com
ing to town. Never mind that CBS is
televising tomorrow's game, which
begins at 3:10 p.m. And never mind
that it will be the first time football
has been played under lights at Stan
ford Stadium.
The big story for the Cardinal foot
ball team this week is the return of
sophomore quarerback John Paye.
How much of a return Paye will
make tomorrow is still uncertain, and
Coach Jack Elway said he may not
know who will start at quarterback
until game time.
"It's up to him," Paye said yester
day, pointing at Elway. "He's the one
who determines if I'm capable of
playing Saturday. But I'll be ready.
I'm preparing myself to play Saturday
and that's the important thing."
After watching from the sidelines
and, on some occasions, the stands
for four weeks, Paye began throwing
the ball and practicing with the team
this week.
"I feel about 75 percent," Paye
said, eyeing his swollen index finger
and the inch-long scar on it."It (the
finger) feels good although I'm still
having accuracy problems. My arm
feels a little tired since I've been
throwing for three days."
Asked if his throwing distance has
been affected, Paye replied, "That's
confidential."
One person who would probably
give his right leg — or even the right
side of his offensive line — to know is
USCs second-year coach, Ted Toll
ner.
"It becomes difficult to prepare for
them (Stanford) because you look at
the four games John Paye played and
then you look at the four games they
went with (Fred) Buckley," Tollner
said. "They go from 33 passes a game
(with Paye) to 18 (a game with Buck
ley). Thaf s quite a difference."
Actually, Buckley has averaged
24.5 passes per game when he's
started. But other than that, Tollner's
right. Stanford has leaned more
toward the run and less toward the
pass when Buckley's starting.
Before Paye's injury, the Car
dinal's ratio of run to pass plays was
nearly even (151 to 134). With Buck
ley at the controls, however, it
jumped to almost 2-to-l in favor
of the run (192 to 98).
"They have the ability to both run
and pass, but you don't know to what
proportion, depending on what quar
terback they use," Tollner said.
Tollner isn't the only coach worry
ing about the other team, though. El
way has more than his share of
worries about the Trojans, 6-1 over
all and leading the Pacific 10 Confer
ence at 5-0.
"We won't have the margin of er
ror against USC that we did against
Oregon State," Elway said, referring
to last week's 28-21 victory after
Stanford spotted the Beavers a 21-0
lead.
To win, "we've got to have our best
offensive day and we have to have
our best defensive day,"he contin
ued. "We've got to make them earn
it. It's going to be a very physical
football game."
After the probation-laden
Trojans finished 4-6-1 last year, their
first losing season in 22 years, and
Tollner almost finished unemployed,
USC is back to its winning ways of the
past. For those who forgot, 11-0 or
10-1 seasons and bowl games are as

traditional at USC as the Trojan
horse.
And so, it seems, is probation. But
the Trojans' most recent spell on
probation, a three-year sentence,
ended last season and, according to
Tollner, that might explain why USC
returned to winning form so quickly.
"Way back in January when we
evaluated what happened to us a year
ago, and how not to let it happen
again, the subject of probation came
up," Tollner said. "We have a lot of
guys in our senior class who have
never had the chance to go to a bowl
and they're highly motivated."
But with the season winding down
and the date when bowl invitations
are extended drawing closer, such
motivation could work against USC.
The Trojans host No. 1-ranked
Washington next week at the Los An
geles Coliseum in a game that, bar
ring an upset tomorrow, should
decide the Rose Bowl race. After
Washington, USC plays UCLA and
then Notre Dame.
And one can't help but think the
Trojans will be looking ahead.
Still, USC has pulled more than
one victory out of a hat this season.
"We're becoming a solid football
team," Tollner said. "We've had our
shortages throughout the season, but
we've found ways to win. We've been

improving each week and improving
in the areas that we were deficient
earlier in the season."
After last Saturday's 31-7 shelling
of the University of California at
Berkeley, the Trojans might not need
to do much more improving. USC is
second in the Pac-10 behind Wash
ington State in rushing offense,
averaging 205 yards per game. And
although the Trojans are ninth in
passing offense, quarterback Tim
Greene is easily first in passing effi
ciency with a 122.4 rating.
Greene replaced senior Sean Salis
bury after he went down in the third
game of the season with what seems
like his 17th knee injury of his career.
Tollner said the injury-prone Salis
bury, who showed up John Elway in
USCs 41-21 victory two years ago at
Stanford, is eligible to redshirt and
may return as a fifth-year senior next
season.
Though USC hasn't had one of its
all-everything tailbacks since Marcus
Allen graduated, Fred Crutcher is
doing his best to uphold the USC
policy of rush for 100 yards a game or
find a seat on the bench. Crutcher,
despite a few minor injuries, is second
in the Pac-10 with his 101.9 yards per
game average.
USC may have its next Allen in 6-
foot-1, 205-pound freshman Ryan

Knight. Knight replaced an
Crutcher in the second quarter last
week and rushed for 122 yards and
two touchdowns on 22 carries.;
Twelve of those carries came on;
USCs final 14-play scoring march in
the fourth quarter.
"But defense is the strength of our
team," Tollner is quick to point out.
"We have more experience on;
defense than in any other part of our
football team." Seven seniors, three
juniors and a sophomore start on a
defense ranked seventh in the nation
both in scoring (12.9 points) and
rushing defense (96.1 yards) per
game. It's also a defense that features
Duane Bickett and Jack Del Rio,
probably the two best outside
linebackers in the country.
USC, as a team, features some true
physical specimens — the offensive
line alone averages 6-6, 268 pounds.
But Cardinal defensive lineman Terry
Jackson said Stanford players don't
have nightmares about the Trojans.
"I think we here at Stanford can
play as physical as any team in the
country," he said. "We here at Stan
ford, we're not afraid of them."
Card notes
A victory tomorrow would be the J
first time the Cardinal has defeated
both USC and UCLA in the same
season since 1971.

USC's senior linebacker Jack Del Rio was a prominent face in the Stan
ford backfield during last year's game. Del Rio leads a successful
defense which is seventh in the nation in both scoring and rushing
defense.


Jill Gilbert/Daily
Stanford junior middle linebacker Dave Wyman leads the team far and
away in tackles with 102. The Cardinal defense has been best against
the run this year and will get tested on the ground by the USC offense
tomorrow.


Whether or not John Paye will start tomorrow may not be determined until game time, but he will almost
certainly play. When he does step on the field, the Stanford offense will likely take on a new look featuring
more passing.
