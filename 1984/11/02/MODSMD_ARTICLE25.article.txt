# Trojan poloists shoot for No. 1 Card
## 
### INGRID SEYER Staff sportswriter 
11 The Stanford water polo team moved into the No. 1 po
sition in the National Collegiate Athletic Association this
'week following its 11-8 victory over Cal State-Long
Beach last weekend.
Last week's No. 1 team, the University of California at
1 Berkeley, dropped to the No. 2 after its 14-13 loss to the
|! University of Southern California last Saturday.
' Stanford will host third-ranked USC tomorrow at noon
DeGuerre Pool in what coach Dante Dettamanti says
will be "an extremely close Pacific 10 league match."
"At this point in the season there is very little separat
ing Cal, USC and Stanford, the top three teams in the na
tion," Dettamanti said. "Whoever gets the little breaks in
tomorrow's game is going to win the match. It will cer
tainly be that close."

Both teams will be working their hardest to win tomor
row's game, especially since it is a Pac-10 match. The Car
dinal, 20-3 overall, leads the league with a 3-0 record.
The Trojans are tied with Cal with a 2-1 record.
USC will have a rematch with Cal today at Cal before
coming to Stanford. But Stanford's No. 1 ranking is sure
to be enough incentive to keep the Trojans from letting
up.
"Any time a team moves into the top position, every
one wants to knock them down. Our guys have worked
hard all season and they deserve the ranking, but we are
not going to blow it out of proportion and get swelled
heads or anything," Dettamanti said. "We really want the
No. 1 ranking heading into the NCAA championships,
and we are going to strive to maintain our ranking for that
reason."

The Cardinal players feel much the same way Detta
manti does in respect to their new ranking.
"We are always striving to reach No. 1 and we were
really psyched when we got there, but all of us are staying
level-headed," sophomore Chris Thompson said. "We are
going to focus on one game at a time, and we all know we
are really going to have to focus on tomorrow's game if we
want to win it."
The Trojans, 20-4-1 overall, are an extremely experi
enced team, led almost entirely by returning seniors. Ac
cording to Dettamanti, the top Trojan players to watch to
morrow are seniors Mike Spicer and Charlie Harris.
"Spicer is one of the best overall water polo players in
the country and Harris is one of the top holemen playing
in the nation today," Dettamanti said. "We are going to
have to stop both of those guys if we want to win."
The Cardinal will be attempting to minimize errors in

Saturday's match, as the little errors are sure to be the
ones that cost the game, according to Dettamanti. The
Stanford team will also be focusing on its counterattack
and will be trying to score when it is down a man. Th e
team will try to take advantage of the Trojans unusual 3-3
defense in a 6-5 situation.
Though the game is sure to be a close one, many of the
players are still confindent in the team s talent and ability
to win.
"We all realize how important these last few games are
and we are going to work together to win them all, fresh
man Erich Fisher said. "This weekend's game is going to
be a tough one, but I think we can do it."
The Cardinal has four more games remaining in the
season, three of them Pac- 10 conference matches. The
Cardinal will be playing Cal twice in the next three weeks,
once away and once at home.

not look too far or the Trojans may give it a surprise.
