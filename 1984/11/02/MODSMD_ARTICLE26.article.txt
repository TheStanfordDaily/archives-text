## Cardinal closes year with loss 
### ERIK ESELIUS Staff sportswriter 
In its final game of the season yes
terday, the Stanford women's soccer
team lost to Sonoma State University
2-0.
Sonoma State, ranked sixth in the
Western Region, raised its record to
12-5-5, while the Cardinal finished at
7-7.
Sonoma State scored both its goals
in the first half. Kelly Montross, who
was All-League in the Northern Cali
fornia Athletic Association last
season, scored first about seven
minutes into the game. Shaun Sloan
closed the scoring at about the 25-
minute mark.
While managing only one shot in
the first half, the Cardinal played
stronger in the second half and
created more scoring opportunities,
notably a breakaway by Sue Moore,
who was stopped by All-League
goalkeeper Kelly Robison.
The game was characterized by ag
gressive play and hard tackling with
very few blown whisles by the
referees.
"They're aggressive. Our team
tends to get a little intimidated by
that," senior co-captain Lisa Shaffer
said. "Last year they were just as
physical and we beat them by skill
alone. If we would have played up to

par," Shaffer continued, "we would
have blown them away."
Stanford Head Coach Helen
Keohane said that the Cardinal did
not play up to its capabilities, espe
cially in the first half.
"I think we didn't play well,"
Keohane said. "The first 45 minutes,
at least, we didn't play like we can.
People were aware that they were
playing poorly and tried to correct
too hard."
The Cardinal season has been char
acterized by fluctuating performances,
with victories over Western Region
ranked teams such as the University
of Santa Clara and Texas A&M Uni
versity and losses to lesser-regarded
teams like St. Mary's College and
Chico State.
"Our season was characterized by
too many ups and downs," according
to junior co-captain Carol Berryman.
"We have great potenial. If we put it
together on the field as well as off, we
will be hot next year."
Though somewhat disappointed by
some earlier close losses, Keohane
felt positive about the Cardinal
season.
"I think the players have a basic
idea of how I would like them to play.
Some of the goals of the year were to
grow as a team and try to get our-
selves organized in the department,"

Keohane said. "I think we're getting
there, not there yet, but the base has
been set."
Sophomore midfielder Amy Geisse
was also pleased by the season and
praised Keohane's coaching. "No
matter how our record turned out we
learned a lot and we have Helen
Keohane to thank for that."
Senior forward Sue Moore led
Stanford scoring with 11 goals and four
assists for a total of 26 points. Geisse
had three goals and three assists for

nine points, followed by Hilary Lauer,
who scored twice and assisted three
times for seven points.
Senior goalkeepers Helen Norton
and Teresa Greaney shared goalie
duties. Norton ended her season with
a 1.50 goals-against average in 13
games while Greaney, playing in
three games, finished with a 2.00
goals-against average.
Stanford will continue to work out
over the winter and plans an alumni
game in November.
