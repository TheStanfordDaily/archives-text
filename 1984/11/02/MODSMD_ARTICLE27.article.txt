# Men's soccer team to face California
## 
### DARREN THORNEYCROFT Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford men's soccer team
will face the Pacific Soccer Confer
ence's highest-scoring team tomorrow
when it plays the University of Cali
fornia at Berkeley.
The Cardinal, which is 9-6-3 this
season, will travel to Berkeley for the
2 p.m. match. The Bears, who are 14-
5, have scored 49 goals this season
while allowing 19, and boast three of
the top four scorers in the PSC: Mike
Nieto (12); Mike Deleray (12); and
Mark Deleray (11). Nieto, with 10
assists, is the conference's leading
scorer with 34 points.
Cal goalkeeper Todd Harmon is
second in conference play with a 1.05
goals-against average and with eight
shutouts this season. The Bears as a
team have the largest goals-for/goals
against difference in the PSC.
Stanford Head Coach Sam Koch
has no secret plan to stop the Bears'
potent offense. "We'll just mark the
Deleray brothers," Koch said, "and
hope that if we can deny them the
ball, we can stop their offense."
To test Cal's defense the Cardinal
will "try and cross the ball a lot, and
see what happens," Koch said. He
added that he has a more specific plan
of attack but declined to reveal it.
Cal and Stanford are both coming
off of big wins. The Bears blew out
the University of Santa Clara on
Wednesday, 4-0, and Stanford
defeated Fresno Pacific College,
which was ranked seventh in the Na

tional Association of Intercollegiate
Athletics, by a 3-0 margin.
The Bears had been undefeated in
PSC play until they lost to the Uni
versity of San Francisco on Oct. 25
and league-leading Fresno State Uni
versity on Oct. 27.
The Cardinal's shutout victory over
Fresno Pacific ended a five-game spell
(of which it lost three) during which it
had given up 11 goals and scored
three. Koch said the victory "was a
good game, and snapped us out of it.
It was a good team effort, and every
one played well. For us to win, every
one has to play well."
Striker Giancarlo Ferruzzi and
goalkeeper Willy Burkhardt, both
seniors, have been among league
leaders all season. Ferruzzi is seventh
in scoring with five goals and nine as
sists for 19 points, while Burkhardt is
fifth in goalkeeping with a 1.60 goals
against average.
Burkhardt shared a shutout with
sophomore goalkeeper Tom Austin,
who made two saves in the second
half against Fresno Pacific. Koch said
he thought Austin turned in a good
performance against the Sunbirds.
"He's worked hard in practice, has
improved steadily, and is ready to
play," Koch said. "Willy is a senior
and won't be here next year, and I
wanted Tom to get some playing
time." Burkhardt was used at
midfielder during the second half
against the Sunbirds.

The Stanford women's soccer team couldn't out maneuver Sonoma
State yesterday, but ended its first year as a varsity sport at 7-7 overall.
The battle for the PSC champion
ship is heating up. Fresno State, 5-0
in the conference, meets second
place USF (4-0-1) on Nov. 9 at
USF in a match that likely will decide
the champion. USF was shocked by
7th-place St. Mary's College Oct. 30,
which tied the Dons in what Koch

termed "the upset of the season."
Barring any more upsets, the Dons
will need to beat Fresno State to win
the PSC title and the automatic berth
in the National Collegiate Athletic
Association playoffs that comes with
it.
