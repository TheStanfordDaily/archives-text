# Two fourth-place finishes so far
## Women's golf team hosts invite 
### ROB GRAHAM Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford women's golf team
hopes to showcase its talented lineup
here today in the first round of the
three-day, 54-hole Stanford Wo
men's Intercollegiate Invitational at
the par-73, 5,903-yard Stanford Golf
Course.
In describing this weekend's com
petition, Cardinal Coach Tim
Baldwin said that "21 fine golf teams
are coming from all over the
country." Moreover, Baldwin expects
"the strongest field of any intercol
legiate event of the year."
So far this year, the women have
recorded two fourth-place finishes,
first at the Nancy Lopez Invitational
two weeks ago in Tulsa, Okla. and
this week's Western Intercollegiate
near Sacramento.
Baldwin feels that as the lineup
solidifies and as his veterens return to
form, the women will not only im
prove but push for national honors.
He has "an extremely high amount of
confidence in the girls" and is con
vinced that Stanford boasts a
"stronger team than we had last
year."
That is quite an assessment. Last
year's Stanford squad entered the
National Collegiate Athletic Associa
tion Spring Invitational ranked fifth
nationally, and although they finished
a disappointing ninth, made a impres
sion upon the country's golf elite.
A succession of fine recruiting ef
forts have attracted talent, like

Swedish native Anna Oxenstierna, to
the Farm. Because Oxenstierna is in
Hong Kong this week to represent
her country in World-Cup play, she
will not be on hand for the Stanford
tournament.
The Nancy Lopez Invitational and
Western Intercollegiate provided a
"learning experience" for the
younger members of Baldwin's team.
In turn, Baldwin is "learning a lot
about all our players."
The Cardinal will "stick with the
same lineup we used the last three
days in Sacramento." That means the
women will be led by sophomore
Kathleen McCarthy, whose perfor
mance in Sacramento placed her third
individually. Furthermore, McCarthy
has an excellent track record at the
Stanford tournament. Last year, she
set a tournament record with her
four-under-par 215.
Junior Kathy Kostas has also
played a prominent role for the wo
men. Two weeks ago at the Lopez In
vitational, Kostas' three-day effort
put her in a first-place tie for individ
ual honors. That performance earned
some exuberant praise from Baldwin.
"That was Kathy's best performance
at Stanford," he said.
Freshmen Kay Cornelius,
Adrienne Gilmartin and Stephanie
Kondik round out the rest of Stan
ford's lineup. Gilmartin and Kondik
are relative new-comers to the top
five, having beaten out more
experienced players Julie Carmichael
and Kerre Dubinsky.

The team is hoping to improve
upon last year's fourth-place finish in
this event. To succeed, Stanford will
have to contend with the likes of last
year's winner, the University of
Tulsa. Other powers such as San Jose
State University, Arizona State Uni
versity, New Mexico State University,

United States International Univer
sity and the University of Florida will
also vie for the championship.
The team, according to Baldwin, is
"all excited about the tournament."
With an inexperienced but talented
group, Stanford should be exciting no
matter what the outcome.
