# Students vote for stock referendum
## 
### CLINT HIGHFILL Senior staff writer 
Students voted resoundingly for divestiture of all Uni
versity holdings of Motorola Corp. stock and for the
Democratic presidential slate of Walter Mondale and
Geraldine Ferraro in this week's ASSU special election,
election officials announced yesterday.
Fhe election results also revealed student support for
five of eight proposed constitutional amendments and for
a proposal that the Committee of Fifteen be convened.
Results of the graduate senate elections will not be
released until later owing to the need to tally
write-in votes and secure declarations of intent from
write-in candidates, said Elections Commissioner Chris
Reid.
The referendum on University investments, which calls
on the University to sell its stock in Motorola and
"establish criteria for selective divestment" in other com
panies, was supported 81 percent to 19 percent. The pres
idential-preference poll found 68 percent of the voters for
the Democratic ticket and 27 percent for the Republican
nominees.
The President's Commission on Investment Responsi
bility will consider the results of the investment referen
dum at its meeting next Friday, according to Political Sci
ence Prof. Richard Brody, incoming chairman of the com
mittee.
"All the issues will be aired," he said, and student con
cerns will be "given the most serious consideration."
Brody said he could not predict whether the commis
sion, which reports to the University Board of Trustees,

would recommend selling the University's 94,000 shares
of Motorola stock at the trustees' next meeting in Decem
ber.
ASSU Senator Jon Adelstein, a co-sponsor of the refer
endum, said the outcome showed that "students expect
basic human values to guide the University's policies.
"I think that Stanford will eventually divorce itself from
these morally bankrupt companies," he said.
Supporters of the amendment cite the company's 1982
sale of $3.2 million worth of communications equipment
to the South African police and military, and its low level
of compliance with the Sullivan employment principles as
evidence that the company supports apartheid. The Sul
livan principles are a code of conduct for companies that
do business in South Africa.
The results of the ASSU survey on the presidential
election were in sharp contrast to those of a campus-wide
poll conducted last month by undergraduates. Last month's
poll, which had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 per
cent, found Mondale leading Reagan by 12 percentage
points, compared to a Mondale lead of 41 points in this
poll.
Students voted 1,675 to 674 for the Democratic slate,
with 102 voting for other tickets.
Tod Bergstrom, a co-terminal student in history who
organized the earlier poll, said that the two polls were
"probably both very good," and added that he didn't find
"any fundamental problem" in the
varying results. Taking statistical er
ror into account, the new poll indi
cated a shift of only about 3 to 4
points, he said.
Five amendments to the constitu
tion acquired the needed two-thirds
approval by student voters.
Amendments providing for the
equitable representation of graduate
students, for the partitioning of spe
cial-fee budgets, for section titles in
the ASSU Constitution and for the
modification of the existing structure
of the nominations committee all
passed.
Two amendments, providing for
the elimination of gender-specific
language from the constitution and
bylaws and for a structure to levy fees
to fund ASSU capital improvements,
received a majority of votes but failed
to garner the necessary two-thirds of
the votes cast.
The only measure which failed out
right was a bill to strengthen the veto
of the Council of Presidents (COP).
