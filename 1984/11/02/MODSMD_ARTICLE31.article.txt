## Rape awareness stressed 
### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Staff writer 
The necessity for women to protect themselves and ex
press their feelings were the underlying themes at a semi
nar last night on acquaintance rape. The seminar was
sponsored by the Rape Education Project (REP).
"Acquaintance rape is something that affects all of us.
People don't talk about it, and it is important for them to
be able to express their true feelings," said Pilar Ossorio,
a graduate student in microbiology and a representative of
REP.
The seminar consisted of three panelists who discussed
the psychological effects of acquaintance rape and therapy
methods to aid both the survivors and assaulters involved
in these situations.
Nadine Wisniewski, a Ph.D. student at Kent State Uni
versity, has been directly involved with research involving
rape victims. She said that based on statistics of
3,800 women surveyed in Ohio, 96 percent of all rape
cases are not reported.
These statistics differ tremendously from current law
enforcement statistics, which contend that 40 to 50 per
cent of all rape cases are reported. This discrepancy oc
curs because most officers do not deal with acquaintance
rapes very often; as a result, they do not include these
incidents in their percentages.
"Battering can be defined as any violence committed
against a woman by a man who has an intimate relation
ship with his victim. This may consist of threats of physical
or even psychological abuse," said Juanita Pena-Franco,
Mid-Peninsula Support Network educator.

"Studies by the FBI estimate that a woman is battered
every 15 to 18 seconds. A total of 2.8 million women are
battered each year," Pena-Franco said.
Stanford is not immune to rape incidents. The shelter
has received calls from both students and professors
asking how to deal with acquaintance rape incidents.
Many myths surround acquaintance rapes and batter
ings, according to Pena-Franco. People believe these inci
dents are rare and more prominent among poor people.
But studies show that acquaintance rapes and batterings
cross all boundaries. Most also assume that these are one
time incidents involving a single slap. Pena-Franco said
that although the first incident may be just a shove or
push, it often escalates into repetitive physical violence.
Also, people often believe that women provoke this
abuse and that they want it.
"Never have I met a woman who enjoyed being bat
tered," Peno-Franco said.
Rape is a life-changing event, according to Cari Wilson,
director of the YWCA Rape Crisis Center in Palo Alto.
She quoted FBI statistics that one-third of all women will
be sexually assaulted in their lifetime.
Wilson discussed the painful process of recovery a wo
man must undergo after being raped. To regain power and
control over her life, she must re-establish a supportive
environment through the on-going aid of partners and
friends.
"Women must learn to trust their instincts. Women
need to be shown that it is OK to protect themselves,"
Wilson said.
