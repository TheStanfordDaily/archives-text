## Inn's plain exterior hides elegant eatery 
### CHARLIE GOFEN STEPHANIE GUIGOU 
Prime Rib Inn
4175 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
493-3060
It could be a Rustler's steakhouse
from its outer appearance, but don't
let the bleak exterior of the Prime
Rib Inn deceive you.
The Palo Alto restaurant, located
about a half-mile south of campus on
El Camino Real, offers great food in
a warm atmosphere so seldom found
at local eateries, and prices are
reasonable for the large, beautifully
arranged dishes. Not all the entrees
are meat dishes: The selection ranges
from the specialty prime rib to
chicken teriyaki, steak and lobster,
scampi, snapper and sole. Appetizers
include crab, shrimp and snails.

Defensive linemen may opt for the
larger dish, but the smaller cut pro
vides sufficient food for most other
humans. The Prime Rib Inn takes
pride in its specialty, and that pride is
justified: The prime rib is juicy, tasty
and tender.

Burgundy tablecloths, adequate
but not excessive lighting, com
fortable furniture and wood walls
dotted with landscape and seascape
paintings not unlike the familiar art
form of fingerpainting all contribute
to the pleasant ambience of the Prime
Rib Inn. The absence of windows is
notable.
Also notable is a sparse weekday
dinner crowd. The Prime Rib Inn is a
well-kept secret, apparently attended
by middle-aged gourmands and few
University students. But the meals
are affordable. Appetizers are mainly
in the $5 range, entrees around $11.
And the complimentary bread
must not be overlooked.
First on a list of recommendations
is the house white wine (half carafe,
$3.95; carafe, $5.95), one of the
finest house wines in recent memory.
Water is provided, and both water
and wine glasses are kept comfortably
full by an attentive waiter whose
heavy French accent sets the atmo

sphere of a fine, gourmet restaurant.
The Shrimp Cocktail Supreme
($4.95), four jumbo shrimp averaging
$1.24 apiece before tax, is a tasty if
not cost-efficient appetizer which
comes with a zestful condiment that
could only be described as "shrimp
sauce."
Entrees are served with a tasty,
crisp salad, rice pilaf or a baked
potato doused in sour cream and
chives, carrots and peas, and the
dishes truly look attractive.
Two cuts of the roasted prime rib
of beef au jus are offered (Chef s Cut,
$11.95; M'Lord's Cut, $13.95). De
fensive linemen may opt for the
larger dish, but the smaller cut pro
vides sufficient food for most other
humans. The Prime Rib Inn takes

pnde in its specialty, ana that pride is
justified: The prime rib is juicy, tasty
and tender.
The brochette of beef sirloin
($9.95), skewered marinated steak
with green peppers, mushrooms and
onions, is another large meat dish
with a great flavor.
A rich chocolate mousse dessert
dish, whipped to perfection and
served decoratively in a tall parfait
glass, clears the palate and climaxes a
wonderful meal. Dessert offerings —
many of which were not available
earlier in the week — include cherries
jubilee, creme caramel, Kahlua
mousse and cheesecake (average
price, $2.50).
Service is outstanding, the waiters
are friendly, the food is good. The
Prime Rib Inn is worth the five
minute drive down El Camino Real
and the $35 for a meal-for-two.
