Walking to the entrance of The Cellar, a lunch and din
ner establishment in Los Altos, I was impressed by the
quaint exterior, with umbrellas shading tables on the
patio, the cool, white, plastered walls and the cream
colored Rolls Royce parked near the entrance.
At the entrance is a sign directing you either straight
ahead to the bar or up the stairs to the dining area. It ap
peared there was no "cellar," as the name had led us to
expect.
We decided to go upstairs and were pleased to see that
here the dining area is divided so that you feel more
secluded. The hostess was there to seat us immediately.
Our waiter, very gregarious and attentive throughout the
evening, quickly arrived with water glasses and a basket of
bread and butter.
Appetizers at The Cellar are quite inexpensive: $2.25
for either deep-fried mushrooms, zucchini, artichoke
hearts or supremes of chicken.
We ordered clam florentine, which is a blend of spinach
and clams, topped with swiss and parmesan cheese and
served hot on a large clam shell ($2.25). I enjoyed the
spinach, but the clams were cut so small that the taste was
lost, and all I noticed was how chewy they were.
Dinners include rice, soup du jour, fresh salad and
french bread. You get your own salad from the salad bar.
It was arranged very nicely but was your average salad
bar.
This restaurant had few surprises. The soup was potato

leek and looked appetizing with chunks of potato and fine
strips of leek. However, it was bland and I returned to the
salad bar to flavor it generously with fresh ground pepper.
Entrees range from seafood items to choice steaks and
the specialties of the house. The specials were salmon
filet, swordfish filet, calamari steak, fresh fettucine and
chicken prima vera. I ordered the swordfish ($12.95) and
my friend ordered the prime rib, which was served with a
baked potato ($13.95).
The filet of Pacific red snapper was the most reasonably
priced item on the menu for $7.95. The calamari and
chicken prima vera were each $8.95.1 think the prices are
comparable to many other restaurants, but here some of
the atmosphere you find at other places is lacking.
The Cellar, though perhaps not a chain itself, is similar
to chain restaurants like TTie Cask and Cleaver where
you'll never be served anything very creative or unusual.
Our waiter carefully spaced the time between our ap
petizer and our dinners, so we were relaxed and un
hurried. My swordfish was served with a side of Meuniere
and rice cooked perfectly with some green peppers anft
carrots.
My friend had to return his steak, which he ordered
medium and was served blood red. The waiter returned
with another in a matter of*minutes. We noticed it was a
different, larger cut. This time it was well cooked and deli
cious, and my friend also enjoyed the baked potato.
Overall, we had a very nice evening. I wouldn't not
recommend The Cellar, but I'd be lying if I said it was a
memorable experience.
