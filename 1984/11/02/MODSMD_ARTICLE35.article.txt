Good food at a reasonable price.
That's what most budget-minded
diners look for when they choose a
restaurant. Around this area, it's easy
to find restaurants that serve good
food, but it's more difficult to dis
cover places that offer both quality
food and low prices.
However, Sirloin & Brew is one
place where that elusive combination
can be found. It may just be the best
deal in the area.

It may just be the
best deal in the
area.

Entrees range from $5.50 for
broiled ground beef to $10.95 for
steak and lobster. But at Sirloin &
Brew, it's the extras that make the
difference.
Those extras include unlimited
access to a full salad bar; soup; a
choice of a pitcher of sangria beer, or
a bottle of wine; a potato and
vegetables; and unlimited bread and
butter. Those who choose a soft drink
as their beverage get unlimited refills.
All these extras are included in the
cost of the entree.
But maybe the best deals at Sirloin
and Brew are the early bird specials,
which are meals discounted between
4 and 5:30 p.m. Diners who arrive at
that time pay just $4.89 (and that in
cludes all the extras) for certain selec
ted entrees.
The atmosphere at Sirloin &

Brew's Mountain View branch does
not seem like that of a budget restau
rant: The dimly lit, tastefully
decorated interior could make you
think that you're spending a lot more
for your dinner.
As the name suggests, Sirloin &
Brew specializes in steaks. The res
taurant offers several cuts of sirloin,
including a V.I.P. steak ($6.99), small
sirloin steak ($7.95), regular sirloin
steak ($9.25), teriyaki sirloin ($9.25),
and gourmet cut sirloin steak
($10.25). Any unsatisfactory steaks
will be replaced on request.
The restaurant also offers Pacific
red snapper ($5.95) and three vari
eties of chicken: teriyaki ($6.95),
marinated ($6.95) and Catalina
($5.95). Desserts offered include
cheesecake (95 cents) and chocolate
Bavarian cake (95 cents).
We started off with crispy, fresh
salad from the extensive salad bar,
tasty mushroom soup and sourdough
bread. The cordial and attentive
waiters quickly brought the teriyaki
chicken steak and lobster that we
chose as entrees.
The chicken was smothered in a
delicious teriyaki sauce and served
with a large potato. Unlimited access
to bacon bits, sour cream and butter
help make the potato a delicious,
though fattening, concoction.
The tender steak was cooked to
perfection, and the accompanying
lobster tail was bathed in a tasty
sauce. Small pitchers of fruity sangria
helped wash down an excellent, inex
pensive and complete meal.
Sirloin & Brew has branches in
Mountain View, Oakland, Saratoga,
Belmont, Fremont and San Fran
cisco. The restaurants are open every
day starting at 4 p.m.
