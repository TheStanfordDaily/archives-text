Shaikh's doesn't have elegant tables covered with long
white tablecloths and fine china and silver. It doesn't have
candlelight or soft music to offer.
Its tables are plastic — bright orange plastic — and the
food is served on plastic plates with plastic utensils. The
menu — a large board showing the curry of the day
(chicken, vegetable or beef on the day we ate there) and
the other dishes Shaikh's offers — is actually plastic too.
But Shaikh's shortcomings in atmosphere are more
than made up for by its tasty and reasonably priced dishes.
The restaurant doesn't offer very many dishes — just
chutney, samosa, pakoda and gulabjam in addition to
curry — but the few items served are delicious.
Two very helpful and friendly Indian women took our
order from behind the counter. My friend and I both
chose the Indian combo, which includes your selection of
curry and chutney, one samosa and one pakoda — all for
only $2.50.
You can also get three samosas — pastries filled with
vegetables or meat — for $1. Pakodas, crispy spinach and
garbanzo flour balls, are six for $1.
Only a few minutes passed before our food was ready.
My friend and I both thought all the different items were
very good. His vegetable curry and my chicken curry were
flavorful-and spicy. They were not too spicy either, unlike
some Indian food I have tried before.
The chutney had the pleasant flavor of mixed spices and
herbs, predominantly mint. Our favorite items, though,
were the pakodas: although fried, they were not greasy at
all.
To accompany his meal, my friend tried a sweet yogurt
drink flavored with cumin. I, not as adventuresome,
settled for sparkling cider, which Shaikh's offers along
with apple juice and assorted soft drinks.
For the grand finale, we asked for a couple of gulabjam.
We weren't quite sure how the small wheat flour balls
dipped in syrup were cooked, but we both thought they
were delicious.
We left Shaikh's satisfied and happy to have found a
place where you can get a good, tasty meal fast and at a
low price.
