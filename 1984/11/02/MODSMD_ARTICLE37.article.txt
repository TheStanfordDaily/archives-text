My Night at Maud's (1969)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
323-6411
This is the film that won Eric Rohmer
international acclaim. Francoise Fabian
and Jean-Louis Trintignant give deli
cate, observant performances in this
joyously intelligent comedy of manners
which is (like all of Rohmer's films)
about the way articulate men and wo
men relate to each other, and about the
discrepancy between what they say and
what they do. Nestor Almendros is the
cinematographer.
Plays Monday and Tuesday with
"Pauline at the Beach."

Holiday (1938)
Kresge Auditorium
This was the second film version of
Philip Barry's hit comedy of the late
19205; the first, in 1930, had starred
Ann Harding, Robert Ames and Mary
Astor. This one, directed by George
Cukor, features Cary Grant as Johnny
Case, who wants adventure, and Kat
harine Hepburn as Linda Seton, the
rebellious kid sister of Johnny's stuffy
fiancee (Doris Nolan) — and it may well
be the warmest of all the comedies of
this epoch. Donald Ogden Stewart's
screenplay improved on the elegant
stage dialogue, and although one keeps
wondering how Grant could ever have
settled on Doris Nolan, even for an in
stant (it's the central question — the
flaw — of most comedies in this genre),
the rest of the acting is superlative. Lew
Ayres, as Hepburn's alcoholic brother,
probably never got to be this sensitive
and touching again, and Edward Everett
Horton and Jean Dixon are grand as
Grant's best friends. Grant is wonderful,
and as for Katharine Hepburn, she sur
passes one's greatest expectations. Has
any American actress ever given a more
complex and affecting comic perfor
mance?
Plays tonight at 9.
Against All Odds (1984)
Memorial Auditorium
Jacques Tourneur's 1947 "Out of the
Past" has something of a cult status
among film noir aficionados, and though
it's a fairly crummy picture, it is in fact
much more enjoyable than this revamp
ing, written by Eric Hughes and directed
by Taylor Hackford. Jeff Bridges contri
butes his vivid persona as a football
player hired by James Woods to track
down his girl friend, Rachel Ward. The
talented cast also includes Saul Rubinek,
Swoosie Kurtz, Bill McKinney and
Dorian Harewood, but the supporting
roles are just a pittance — even Woods',
though he is nominally the third lead.
(He can play sleazo roles like this one in
his sleep.) The love scenes could have
held the film together, but there's no
sexual chemistry between Bridges and
Ward. The best sequence is a
remarkably tense car chase early in the
picture, and even that lacks the impact it
could have had, since it doesn't erupt out
of the plot at all. Evocatively shot by
Donald Thorin.
Plays Sunday evening at 7 & 9:30.
Pather Panchali (1955)
Cubberley Auditorium
When Jean Renoir went to India in
the early '50s to film "The River,"
Satyajit Ray apprenticed with him and
then went on to make his first film:
"Pather Panchali (Song of the Road),"

the first of a trilogy based on the novels
of Bibhuti Bhushan Bandyopadhyay.
Perhaps no other director in the history
of movies has made such an astonishing
debut. Subir Banerjee plays the boy,
Apu, who lives with his mother (the ex
traordinary actress Karuna Banerjee),
his sister (Champa Banerjee) and his
wizened old aunt (Chunibala Devi) in a
Bengalese village; they live in poverty,
and Apu's father (Kanu Banerjee), a
Brahmin, spends most of his time
travelling from village to village, unable
to support them. Like his mentor,
Renoir, Ray is an impassioned director,
but he has a serene style: Moments of al
most unbearable beauty seem to be
suspended like a painter's images, yet
you wouldn't call the film painterly — it
has an inexorable movement, but Ray's
sense of time is so different from ours
that you have to enter it before you can
begin to feel the flow of the movie. The
rewards of giving yourself over to the ex
perience of the film are very great.
Plays Tuesday at 8.
The Stranger (1967)
Cubberley Theatre (4000 Middlefield
Road), Palo Alto
In Albert Camus' 1942 novel, one of
the cornerstones of French existentialist
literature, Meursault mourns his dead
mother without feeling, carries on an af
fair with a pretty shopgirl without love,
kills a man for no legally defensible rea
son and is condemned to death. In this
painstaking adaptation, Luchino Vis
conti has preserved every detail of the
book, and his photographer, Giuseppe
Rotunno, has caught the mood of the
squalid neighborhood and the op
pressive heat of the Sunday beach scenes
admirably; it's a respectable film — even
a fine one — but it fails to capture the
esprit of the book, which towers above it,
out of reach. As Meursault, Marcello
Mastroianni, though physically wrong
for the role — Meursault shouldn't look
so much like a movie star — does first
rate work, as do Anna Karina as his un
complicated paramour, Marie, Georges
Geret as the pimp Raymond, Joseph
Marechal as Salamano, the dog owner,
and Bruno Cremer as the priest.
Plays Wednesday at 8.
Never Cry Wolf (1983)
Bijou, Palo Alto
326-6196
Full of glorious footage, Carroll Bal
lard's second commercial film is none
theless a disappointment. Perhaps if the
Farley Mowat book that was its source
— the report of a man sent by the
Canadian government to confirm the
widely held belief that wolves are
causing the gradual elimination of
caribou in the far north — had provided

a more compelling story, the movie
would have a sense of movement, of ur
gency. As it is, the picture as a whole
seems peculiarly passive. It has a
strange, arbitrary quality, as if no one
had devised a strategy for linking its gen
erally magnificent scenes. It's a wonder
ful collection of observations without a
point. (Even Mowat's obvious, ironic
message — that men, not wolves, are re
sponsible for the devastation of the
caribou — hasn't made it into the final
print.) With Charles Martin Smith, mis
cast as the hero, Tyler, and two amazing
looking Innuit actors, Zachary It
timangnaq and Samson Jorah. Put to
gether by half a dozen writers (credited),
and shot, superbly, by Hiro Narita.
Plays Sunday with "The Man from
Snowy River.".
Tempest (1982)
Bijou, Palo Alto
A Big Personal Film from Paul
Mazursky with nothing really personal
about it; perhaps because of the pres
ence of John Cassavetes and Gena
Rowlands in the cast, much of it seems
to have been forged in the lumpy im
provisational style of Cassavetes' own
psychodramas. Mazursky has converted
Shakespeare's last play into a tale of a
New York architect (Cassavetes) in the
throes of a midlife crisis and employed a
scrambled flashback structure and four
or five styles in the process. It's an im
prov slapstick quest parody filled with
soliloquies and spontaneous songs and
dances, and with a large cast but only
two appealing performances: Susan
Sarandon's and 14-year-old Molly
Ringwald's (as, respectively,
Aretha/Ariel and Miranda).
Plays Monday with "The Dresser."
Citizen Kane (1941)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Orson Welles was only in his mid-20s
when he came to Hollywood to make
this film, but he had already established
himself as an enfant terrible on Broad
way and on radio. The bristling, vibrant
feeling of the picture is due in part to the
youthfulness of most of the people who
collaborated on it (only the screenwriter,
Herman J. Mankiewicz, had been
working in movies for long) and in part
to the subject: publisher William Ran
dolph Hearst, who was still very much
alive. An extraordinary movie. With a
Mercury Theater cast: Welles as Kane,
Joseph Cotten, Dorothy Comingore,
Ruth Warrick, Agnes Moorehead,
Everett Sloane. Photographed by Gregg
Toland.
Plays Wednesday with "The Foun
tainhead."

Pauline at the Beach (1983)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Eric Rohmer's enjoyable trifle sug
gests Feydeau slowed down to vacation
pace. It's a thesis comedy, too neatly
worked out to present much of a chal
lenge to an audience. There are two
messages: that no one in love acts as he
or she expected to, and that children can
be much sharper-eyed and wiser than
their elders. Neither of these theses is
likely to knock down any skyscrapers,
and there's a tiresome regularity to the
way in which Rohmer carries them out,
though the movie is an impeccable piece
of filmmaking, so seamlessly staged and
shot (by Nestor Almendros) that not a
trace of work shows. With Amanda
Langlet, Arielle Dombasle, Pascal Greg
gory, Feodor Atkine, Rosette and Simon
de la Brosse.
Plays Monday and Tuesday with "My
Night at Maud's."
The Thin Man (1934)
Festival, Palo Alto
329-1848
Most people have forgotten who the
murderer is in this famous adaptation of
the Dashiell Hammett novel, but not
who the detectives are: Nick and Nora
Charles, the most elegant sleuthing com
bination in the history of movies. Never
without a highball or a bon mot, they
suavely killed off the stagebound, sche
matic thrillers of the early talkie period,
and became so popular that five sequels
were made (the last one in 1947). (An
amusing bit of trivia: The title alludes to
a detail of the mystery, but it caught on

so fast that all the follow-ups had "The
Thin Man" stuck, irrelevantly, in their
titles.) William Powell and Myrna Loy
proved to be so good together (and such
a smash at the box office) that they
teamed up on several other films, too,
including "The Great Ziegfeld," in
which he played the celebrated im
presario and she played Billie Burke.
Screenplay (a smart one) by Frances
Goodrich and Albert Hackett; W.S. Van
Dyke directed (more deftly than usual).
With Maureen O'Sullivan, Nat
Pendleton, Minna Gombell, Edward El
lis, Porter Hall, Cesar Romero, Edward
Brophy and others.
Plays through Wednesday with
"Murder Ahoy!"
