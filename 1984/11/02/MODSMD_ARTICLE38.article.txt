# Medical school faculty member dies suddenly
## 
### 
Anne Yeager, a prominent
pediatric researcher and Stanford
Medical School faculty member for
the past 10 years, died suddenly
Wednesday of a blood clot in the
lungs. She was 45.
Yeager stopped breathing in a
paramedic ambulance en route to
Stanford Hospital from her Palo Alto
home, according to her physician,
Norman Rizk. She was declared dead
in the emergency room at 7:45
p.m.
An autopsy to disclose the underly
ing cause of death was performed
yesterday and results were not imme
diately available. But Rizk said
pulmonary embolism, or a blood clot
entering the lungs, is usually caused
by phlebitis or a tumor and is respon
sible for about 100,000 deaths an
nually.
Irving Schulman, Yeager's depart
ment chairman, said she was perhaps
best-known nationally for her re
search leading to avoidance of herpes
in newborn infants. She also is
credited by colleagues for important
work on cytomegalovirus, a viral in
fection that once felled about 7.5 per
cent of the nation's premature in
fants. Improved blood donor screen
ing was initiated to conquer this ail

ment based on her work.
Other research, centering on infec
tious diseases, included a 1976 study
which reported that giving measles
vaccines to infants was less effective
than waiting until they were toddlers.
Because of her work, the recom
mended age for measles immuniza
tion was raised from 12 to 15 months
in the United States and other
countries.
A native of Baltimore, Yeager
graduated from Cornell University
Medical College in 1965. She joined
the Stanford faculty as an assistant
professor in 1974 after four years in a
similar position at the University of
Colorado Medical Center. She was
promoted to associate professor in
1977.
She is survived by her parents as
well as a brother and sister.
