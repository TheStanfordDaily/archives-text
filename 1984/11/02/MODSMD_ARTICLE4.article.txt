# Honor code reviewed
## 
### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Staff writer 
The Student Conduct Legislative
Council intends to present
legislation proposing changes in the
interpretations and applications of
the Honor Code next week.
The SCLC, a body that defines
misconduct and penalties resulting
from Honor Code violations, will
present the proposed changes to Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy,
the ASSU Senate, the Faculty
Cpuoic anil 'h-.- Stanford
community.
The changes include redefining the
position of a proctor during an exam
and distinguishing between
"intellectual" and "moral" viola
tions.
In addition, the proposed legisla
tion "would eliminate the privilege of
a faculty member to act as a moral
judge as well as an academic mentor
in cases concerning academic viola
tions of the Honor Code in his or her
class," according to Sally Cole, judi
cial affairs officer.
For example, a professor is cur
rently allowed to devise his own sys
tem of penalties, such as the lowering
of a grade or another similar aca
demic penalty, if he suspects a stu
dent has cheated.
Cole believes that it is more impor
tant to stop the behavior of the stu
dent than to penalize the student. In
her annual report for 1983-84, Cole
said: "Some students have already
learned the lesson of a lifetime before

I even meet them, and the self
inflicted misery they have endured far
exceeds anything likely to be caused
by institutional sanctions."
Twenty Stanford students were
charged last year with plagiarism,
cheating, stealing and forging grade
charged by the University last year
with plagiarism, cheating, stealing and
forging grade-change cards. This
Honor Code violations, six Funda
mental Standard violations, and one
case of a student who violated both
codes.
Although the number represents
only a small fraction of the 13,000-
member student body, "any number
greater than zero is too many," ac
cording to Arthur Keller, chairman of
the Honor Code Commission.
The 13 Honor Code violations last
year included:
• five cases in which students submit
ted papers written partially or wholly
by other students;
• two cases in which students were
unlawfully aided by notes during an
exam;
• one instance of collaboration during
an in-class examination.
Six students were charged with
violating the University's Fundamen
tal Standard, which expects students
to respect order, personal honor and
the rights of others. For example, two
students stole their roommates'
money and two students forged
grade-change cards.
Eight female and 12 male students
were formally charged with viola

tions; 17 were undergraduates and
three were graduate students. Of the
20 violations, one charge has been
dropped.
TTie 20 charges of misconduct of
last year do not accurately represent
the number of times Cole has been
involved with Honor Code violations.

Cole said that during the 1983-84
academic year, approximately 30 in
vestigations did not result in the filing
of charges.
In her annual report. Cole says
there are several reasons that Honor
Code investigations do not result in
penalties, including those cases in
which "the evidence supporting an al
legation is not strong enough; for ex
ample, eye-witness testimony."
