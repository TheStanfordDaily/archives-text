## Prop 32: Gives state Supreme Court flexibility 
### JOHN CALLON 
"Due process" by a speedy trial is fundamen
tal to the American notion of justice. But ac
cording to proponents of California State Ballot
Proposition 32, the constitutional right to a fair
and speedy trial is being jeopardized by the
litigation logjam in the state Supreme Court.
Proposition 32, sponsored by the administra
tive arm of the state judiciary and by State
Senator Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles
County), is intended to streamline appellate
case review procedures by granting the state Su
preme Court greater flexibility in managing its
case load. It has proven a largely uncontrover
sial amendment with overwhelming support in
the state legislature and administration.
John Miller, a member of Watson's staff, feels
that the 800-percent increase in the number of
cases appealed to the court since 1958 has left
the court with a "fundamental problem with the
case load."
If passed, the proposition will allow the court
to decide specific issues in appealed cases,
rather than the requisite review of all issues in
volved in a case accepted for hearing. It also
empowers the justices to return a case after the

initial decision to hear it and clarifies the court's
ability to transfer cases from one appellate court
to another.
The proposition is designed to bring Califor
nia into line with judicial procedures in 48 other
states and at the federal level. It will have no ef
fect on cases involving the death penalty, which
are automatically appealed to the Supreme
Court.
State Supreme Court Justice Otto Kaus ex
plained the need for the reforms contained in
the proposition. "Under the present system, a
court of appeals asks us for a hearing, and there
may be a very important issue involved," he
said. "In order to reach it (the issue), we have to
get through the nine or 10 other issues involved.
It's as if the appeals court had not done a
thing."
The ability to return cases after a hearing has
been "improvidently granted" is also important
for what he called a "burdensome case load."
Since the justices work under terrific pressure,
he said, they sometimes inadvertently grant a
