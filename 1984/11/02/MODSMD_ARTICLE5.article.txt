## Prop 32: Gives state Supreme Court flexibility 
### JOHN CALLON 
"Due process" by a speedy trial is fundamen
tal to the American notion of justice. But ac
cording to proponents of California State Ballot
Proposition 32, the constitutional right to a fair
and speedy trial is being jeopardized by the
litigation logjam in the state Supreme Court.
Proposition 32, sponsored by the administra
tive arm of the state judiciary and by State
Senator Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles
County), is intended to streamline appellate
case review procedures by granting the state Su
preme Court greater flexibility in managing its
case load. It has proven a largely uncontrover
sial amendment with overwhelming support in
the state legislature and administration.
John Miller, a member of Watson's staff, feels
that the 800-percent increase in the number of
cases appealed to the court since 1958 has left
the court with a "fundamental problem with the
case load."
If passed, the proposition will allow the court
to decide specific issues in appealed cases,
rather than the requisite review of all issues in
volved in a case accepted for hearing. It also
empowers the justices to return a case after the

initial decision to hear it and clarifies the court's
ability to transfer cases from one appellate court
to another.
The proposition is designed to bring Califor
nia into line with judicial procedures in 48 other
states and at the federal level. It will have no ef
fect on cases involving the death penalty, which
are automatically appealed to the Supreme
Court.
State Supreme Court Justice Otto Kaus ex
plained the need for the reforms contained in
the proposition. "Under the present system, a
court of appeals asks us for a hearing, and there
may be a very important issue involved," he
said. "In order to reach it (the issue), we have to
get through the nine or 10 other issues involved.
It's as if the appeals court had not done a
thing."
The ability to return cases after a hearing has
been "improvidently granted" is also important
for what he called a "burdensome case load."
Since the justices work under terrific pressure,
he said, they sometimes inadvertently grant a
hearing to a case in order to address
an issue that "really isn't in the case."
In those cases, he said, "we have to
decide something which has no im
portant issue, something that's been
settled since the 19th century. Obvi
ously, if we spend 50 percent of our
time writing up issues which have
nothing of a controversial nature, we
are not being very efficient."
Criticism of the amendment has
focused on the third element of the
proposition, which reads, "The Su
preme Court may review the decision
of a court of appeal in any case." As
semblyman Bill Leonard (R-San Ber
nadino County), the only state legis
lator who voted against the proposi
tion, feels it is an issue of fairness and
power, a "power grab."
Elliot Stevenson, a consultant on
Leonard's staff, said Leonard is con
cerned "mostly on the issue of judi
cial activism. . .. The court is getting
into the arena of legislating."
Stevenson said he understands that
the parties in a case must request a
hearing under the current system, but
that the proposition will change that.
"The Supreme Court will now be able
to pull up and transfer cases without a
request," he said.
But Arnie Overoye, assistant attor
ney general in the criminal division,
points out that the Supreme Court
"had this power before Proposition
32. Last year, the court transferred
50 eases in the Fresno district."
Miller agreed. "There is no doubt
that the court has the ability to trans
fer to themselves. Some constitu
tional attorneys have argued over the

court's right to take a case out of trial
court. It is really just a clarification."
Stevenson also charges that there
has not been a sufficient
"demonstration of a particular over
load at the state level," adding that if
this were the case, there is an alterna
tive method for alleviating the prob
lem.
"They could come to the
legislature and request additional re
sources. The legislature has rather
routinely granted budget requests,"
he said.
Miller admitted that "others have
complained that this procedural rule
is not the basis for the backlog in the
supreme court. They point to more
structural problems."
But Miller said that the proponents
of Proposition 32 are not seeking "to
reconstruct the whole court system.
We don't feel we are treating anyone
unfairly. It is only a logical adjust
ment."
Given Leonard's accusation that
the Supreme Court "has made it vir
tually impossible to enforce the death
penalty for murderers" and "has in
creased the rights available to the
accused and convicted criminals but it
has not increased the rights of victims
of crime or their survivors," Miller is
worried that "this might become a
chance for people to express their
opinion on the Supreme Court, whe
ther it's too hard, or too soft, rather
than accepting this as a necessary
procedural improvement."
Miller added that the Supreme
Court has been very careful about
proposing the amendment. "It was
first introduced in 1929. An identical
measure was introduced two years
ago. They are very cautious, very
bound by tradition. But a concern has
been steadily growing."
