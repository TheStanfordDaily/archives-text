# Prop 41: Welfare reductions create controversy
## 
### BAIE NETZER Senior staff writer 
Proposition 41, a measure to reduce state
welfare payments to 10 percent above the na
tional average, has met with a large opposition
block composed of church groups, medical as
sociations and public-interest organizations.
Those who oppose the proposition argue that
the measure promises devastating effects on
welfare recipients and that the establishment of
a $250,000 Public Assistance Commission gives
money to bureaucrats rather than to those who
need it. Proponents of the bill argue that the
measure maintains needed welfare programs
but cuts unnecessary payments to those able to
work.
Prop. 41 would cut state expenditures for
Medi-Cal, foster care, family planning, job
training and Aid to Families with Dependent
Children. State payments would be reduced to
10 percent above the national average of the
other 49 states.
According to the Friends Committee on
Legislation, a Quaker-sponsored lobbying
group, the proposition's formula for determin
ing payments does not take into account the

cost of living in other states or the number of
people dependent on assistance in those states.
"It's a very arbitrary, overzealous attack on
the welfare system," the group's legislative adv
ocate, Candace Blase, said. "It's a meat-axe ap
proach which is arbitrary, and it doesn't do any
thing to reform the system."
But most of the measure's criticism comes
from the expected effects of reduced payments
on welfare recipients. While most opponents
say the effects would be devastating, they pres
ent a wide range of estimates on the actual cuts
that would be made.
Blase estimated that the AFDC program and
foster-care programs that are part of the AFDC
would be cut in half, resulting in a family of
three receiving only $225 per month on which
to live. She said family planning would be "vir
tually eliminated" because of a 95-percent cut.
Ray Uzeta, president of the California Asso
ciation of the Physically Handicapped and co
author of a statement against Proposition 41 in
the California Elections pamphlet, estimated
cuts in Medi-Cal to reach one-third.
A flyer distributed by a registered
nurse and a nursing student at the
Stanford Medical Center reported the
cuts as ranging from 20 to 80 percent.
Assemblyman Ross Johnson (R-
Orange County), author of state
ments in favor of Proposition 41 in
the elections pamphlet, maintains the
measure will reduce state aid from
double the national average, and no
program designed specifically for the
elderly or the handicapped will be
cut.
Uzeta says the proposed cuts in
Medi-Cal lead him to believe the
handicapped would be "significantly
affected" by the measure's passage.
"Those who are in the medically
needy category face an increase in
shared costs," Uzeta said. "And if
reimbursements are reduced, people
with disabilities will have a harder
time accessing medical services."
In a flyer discussing the effects of
Proposition 41 on Stanford Medical
Center, Director of Finances David
Sakai is quoted as saying. "If Prop. 41
passes, it's likely that Stanford will no
longer be able to serve Medi-Cal
patients."
But proponent Johnson argues that
California exceeds the national
welfare-payment average by $2 bil
lion while spending $1 billion less
than the average on education and
transportation. He maintains educa
tion a..J transportation should have
the same priority for the public's tax
money as welfare payments.
Glen Holman. director of the Cali
fornia Council of Churches, says the
surplus in California is enough to

cover the states education and trans
portation costs.
California had a surplus of almost
$1 billion last year and will probably
have a similiar surplus this year, Hol
man said.
"You don't have to cut welfare to
build roads or to improve schools,"
he said.
Opponents of Proposition 41 also
believe that the proposition only
shifts the cost of welfare onto county
agencies.
The state legislative analyst has es
timated that the reduction in state
payments will cause the state to lose
part of the matching funds offered by
the federal government and will cause
costs to increase for county govern
ments since counties are required to
provide aid for needy persons unable
to receive state assistance.
Blase said counties are not now
able to handle the level of assistance
required of them. She cited a study by
the New England Journal of
Medicine which showed increased
deaths and a general decline in health
among those who were transferred to
county welfare services.
Johnson has said Proposition 41
will force "healthy, young welfare
recipients" to go to work because the
measure protects programs which are
exclusively for the elderly, physically
handicapped or blind.
Because of the limit on funds,
Johnson argues that the state will be
forced to do away with any wasteful
programs which encourage young,
able-bodied people not to work.
