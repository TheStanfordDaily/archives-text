# Prop 41: Welfare reductions create controversy
## 
### BAIE NETZER Senior staff writer 
Proposition 41, a measure to reduce state
welfare payments to 10 percent above the na
tional average, has met with a large opposition
block composed of church groups, medical as
sociations and public-interest organizations.
Those who oppose the proposition argue that
the measure promises devastating effects on
welfare recipients and that the establishment of
a $250,000 Public Assistance Commission gives
money to bureaucrats rather than to those who
need it. Proponents of the bill argue that the
measure maintains needed welfare programs
but cuts unnecessary payments to those able to
work.
Prop. 41 would cut state expenditures for
Medi-Cal, foster care, family planning, job
training and Aid to Families with Dependent
Children. State payments would be reduced to
10 percent above the national average of the
other 49 states.
According to the Friends Committee on
Legislation, a Quaker-sponsored lobbying
group, the proposition's formula for determin
ing payments does not take into account the

cost of living in other states or the number of
people dependent on assistance in those states.
"It's a very arbitrary, overzealous attack on
the welfare system," the group's legislative adv
ocate, Candace Blase, said. "It's a meat-axe ap
proach which is arbitrary, and it doesn't do any
thing to reform the system."
But most of the measure's criticism comes
from the expected effects of reduced payments
on welfare recipients. While most opponents
say the effects would be devastating, they pres
ent a wide range of estimates on the actual cuts
that would be made.
Blase estimated that the AFDC program and
foster-care programs that are part of the AFDC
would be cut in half, resulting in a family of
three receiving only $225 per month on which
to live. She said family planning would be "vir
tually eliminated" because of a 95-percent cut.
Ray Uzeta, president of the California Asso
ciation of the Physically Handicapped and co
author of a statement against Proposition 41 in
the California Elections pamphlet, estimated
cuts in Medi-Cal to reach one-third.
