Blaze on oil tanker extinguished
SAN FRANCISCO — Coast Guard and Navy firefighters yesterday
extinguished flames and hot spots on a petrochemical tanker that was
blasted by three explosions that authorities believe may have been
caused by a bomb.
"The last two hot spots . . . were put out about 1:15 p.m.," said Chief
Petty Officer John Hollis of the Coast Guard.
After the flames were extinguished, 22 investigators from the FBI,
Coast Guard and Navy shuffled about the charred 632-foot tanker,
searching for signs of possible sabotage and assessing the damage.
The explosion was considered to be highly suspicious by FBI agents
who yesterday interviewed crew members of the ship.
The Navy and Coast Guard spent yesterday morning battling flames
aboard the SS Puerto Rican and trying to keep the tanker afloat 25 miles
off the Northern California coast before a predicted storm hits the area.
"If the storm does come in it will make it harder for the Coast Guard
to work on the vessel," spokeswoman Gail Williams said. "I'm not
saying it's going to break up the ship, but it poses a threat to the situa
tion."
Gale warnings were posted through yesterday for winds 20 to 40 knots
and seas to 18 feet, Williams said, adding, "It doesn't look too good as
far as the weather goes."
The explosions, which occurred as crew members were sleeping early
Wednesday, injured nine people and left three hospitalized. One
Philadelphia man whose identity was withheld was reported missing and
presumed dead.
No leakage has been reported, but the Coast Guard said the threat
remained.
Striking workers sue restaurants
SAN FRANCISCO — Union officials, claiming striking restaurant
workers were beaten while police looked the other way, filed an $8 mil
lion lawsuit against three restaurants yesterday and complained to City
Hall about the officers.
As the strike against 72 dining spots entered its third month and pick
eters marched outside 36 of them, charges of violence by both sides in
creased and negotiations remained at a standstill.
"The San Francisco Police Department has been negligent in securing
our members' rights and has been more concerned with limiting their
rights," said Charles Lamb, president of Local 2 of the Flotel and Res
taurant Employees and Bartenders Union.
The police, he charged, "have been acting as private security guards to
these restaurants," and have been "out taking noise readings while our
members are being beaten and threatened with poisonous chemicals."
He also said at least two union members were "falsely arrested, taken
to jail and booked for no apparent reason. In one case, the district attor
ney refused to prosecute apparently because there was no basis for the
arrests." Twenty-two strikers have been arrested, he said, and all
charges were dropped. Police Capt. William Scheffler denied that offi
( cers were turning their backs on alleged attacks against strikers and said,
on the contrary, there have been more reports of violence by the union.
Reagan vies for Democratic votes
BOSTON — President Reagan, in a buoyant mood on the first day of
a final campaign swing, jousted with hecklers and invoked the name and
memory of John Kennedy yesterday as he urged lifelong Democrats to
vote Republican Tuesday.
Reagan drew cheers and chants of "50 states" from a noisy crowd of
several thousand supporters and boos from hundreds of opponents when
he concluded his speech at an outdoor rally by quoting the words Ken
nedy spoke when he left Masschusetts to assume the presidency in 1961.
In that famous speech Kennedy said that the enduring qualities of
Massachusetts and its diverse heritage "are part of my life, my convic
tion, my views of the past and my hopes in the future."
On the first stop of a 10-state campaign tour, Reagan portrayed
Raymond Shamie, the conservative Republican candidate for U.S. Sen
ate in Massachusetts, as a self-made man who understands the problems
of the poor and the young better than his Democratic opponent, John
Kerry.
In this traditionally Democratic city, Reagan portrayed his adminis
tration and his party as deserving of rank-and-file Democratic support.
He repeated a familiar theme that the Democratic leaders of today had
joined the "blame-America-first crowd" and favored higher taxes that
hurt the middle class.
Mondale, Ferraro appear together
NEW YORK — In their last joint appearance before Election Day,
Walter Mondale and Geraldine Ferraro drew an estimated 100,000 sup
porters to a garment-district rally where the Democratic candidates
denounced the "radical preachers" and "extremists who control the Re
publican Party."
Later, at an appearance in Brooklyn, Mondale warned that President
Reagan's reelection could "unleash an orgy of (religious) intolerance in
our land."
In a pair of garment-district speeches clearly intended to woo Jewish,
black and women voters, Mondale vowed to reassert the American
"sense of pluralism" while Ferraro said her selection as Mondale's run
ning mate "did more for equal opportunity in a single day than Ronald
Reagan did in four long years."
Mondale again harshly denounced Reagan for saying last week that
the Democratic Party has failed to condemn anti-Semitism aggressively.
"Mr. President, that charge says something about you. That is false
and contemptible and the American people do not like that kind of
politics anywhere in this country," Mondale said.
"1 have denounced (Black Muslim leader Louis) Farrakhan many
times over. And I've . . . stood up to those radical preachers who are so
close to this president, who've taken over the Republican Party," he
added.
Duarte makes appeal in L.A.
LOS ANGELES — President Jose Napoleon Duarte of El Salvador
appealed yesterday for greater understanding for the plight of Sal
vadoran refugees in the United States, saying many of them were fleeing
from political persecution or injustice.
"They would certainly like to have an opportunity in this country to
make an honest living," he declared. "They have to grab whatever possi
bility they have."
Duarte spoke at a news conference at the Century Plaza Hotel after
addressing a private meeting of business leaders during breakfast. Later,
he delivered the closing speech at the annual convention of the Inter
American Press Association.
Asked whether the estimated hundreds of thousands of Salvadoran
refugees who have fled to the United States in recent years should
receive political asylum, Duarte replied that they were compelled to flee
for many reasons.
"Most of the reason is the historical process of injustice in our
country," he said. "Some are pinpointed as rebels or as communists, as I
was."
Duarte is the principal leader of the Christian Democratic Party of El
Salvador and was sent to Venezuela in exile for several years by the
army after he was denied victory in the presidential election of 1972.
Acknowledging that many of his countrymen enter the United States
illegally, Duarte said that if immigration enforcement were relaxed,
"you would have millions of Salvadorans here, not hundreds of
thousands."
Interest rates help raise stocks
NEW YORK — The stock market rallied with renewed force yester
day, aided by falling interest rates and anticipation of possible moves by
the Federal Reserve toward easier credit.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 9.71 to 1,217.09.
Today's weather
Early morning rain will taper off to scattered showers later on. The
high will be in the 60s.

Walter Mondale and Geraldine Ferraro drew an estimated 100,000 sup
porters to a garment-district rally where the Democratic candidates
denounced the "radical preachers" and "extremists who control the Re
publican Party."
Later, at an appearance in Brooklyn, Mondale warned that President
Reagan's reelection could "unleash an orgy of (religious) intolerance in
our land."
In a pair of garment-district speeches clearly intended to woo Jewish,
black and women voters, Mondale vowed to reassert the American
"sense of pluralism" while Ferraro said her selection as Mondale's run
ning mate "did more for equal opportunity in a single day than Ronald
Reagan did in four long years."
Mondale again harshly denounced Reagan for saying last week that
the Democratic Party has failed to condemn anti-Semitism aggressively.
"Mr. President, that charge says something about you. That is false
and contemptible and the American people do not like that kind of
politics anywhere in this country," Mondale said.
"1 have denounced (Black Muslim leader Louis) Farrakhan many
times over. And I've . . . stood up to those radical preachers who are so
close to this president, who've taken over the Republican Party," he
added.
Duarte makes appeal in L.A.
LOS ANGELES — President Jose Napoleon Duarte of El Salvador
appealed yesterday for greater understanding for the plight of Sal
vadoran refugees in the United States, saying many of them were fleeing
from political persecution or injustice.
"They would certainly like to have an opportunity in this country to
make an honest living," he declared. "They have to grab whatever possi
bility they have."
Duarte spoke at a news conference at the Century Plaza Hotel after
addressing a private meeting of business leaders during breakfast. Later,
he delivered the closing speech at the annual convention of the Inter
American Press Association.
Asked whether the estimated hundreds of thousands of Salvadoran
refugees who have fled to the United States in recent years should
receive political asylum, Duarte replied that they were compelled to flee
for many reasons.
"Most of the reason is the historical process of injustice in our
country," he said. "Some are pinpointed as rebels or as communists, as I
was."
Duarte is the principal leader of the Christian Democratic Party of El
Salvador and was sent to Venezuela in exile for several years by the
army after he was denied victory in the presidential election of 1972.
Acknowledging that many of his countrymen enter the United States
illegally, Duarte said that if immigration enforcement were relaxed,
"you would have millions of Salvadorans here, not hundreds of
thousands."
Interest rates help raise stocks
NEW YORK — The stock market rallied with renewed force yester
day, aided by falling interest rates and anticipation of possible moves by
the Federal Reserve toward easier credit.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 9.71 to 1,217.09.

Blaze on oil tanker extinguished
SAN FRANCISCO — Coast Guard and Navy firefighters yesterday
extinguished flames and hot spots on a petrochemical tanker that was
blasted by three explosions that authorities believe may have been
caused by a bomb.
"The last two hot spots . . . were put out about 1:15 p.m.," said Chief
Petty Officer John Hollis of the Coast Guard.
After the flames were extinguished, 22 investigators from the FBI,
Coast Guard and Navy shuffled about the charred 632-foot tanker,
searching for signs of possible sabotage and assessing the damage.
The explosion was considered to be highly suspicious by FBI agents
who yesterday interviewed crew members of the ship.
The Navy and Coast Guard spent yesterday morning battling flames
aboard the SS Puerto Rican and trying to keep the tanker afloat 25 miles
off the Northern California coast before a predicted storm hits the area.
"If the storm does come in it will make it harder for the Coast Guard
to work on the vessel," spokeswoman Gail Williams said. "I'm not
saying it's going to break up the ship, but it poses a threat to the situa
tion."
Gale warnings were posted through yesterday for winds 20 to 40 knots
and seas to 18 feet, Williams said, adding, "It doesn't look too good as
far as the weather goes."
The explosions, which occurred as crew members were sleeping early
Wednesday, injured nine people and left three hospitalized. One
Philadelphia man whose identity was withheld was reported missing and
presumed dead.
No leakage has been reported, but the Coast Guard said the threat
remained.
Striking workers sue restaurants
SAN FRANCISCO — Union officials, claiming striking restaurant
workers were beaten while police looked the other way, filed an $8 mil
lion lawsuit against three restaurants yesterday and complained to City
Hall about the officers.
As the strike against 72 dining spots entered its third month and pick
eters marched outside 36 of them, charges of violence by both sides in
creased and negotiations remained at a standstill.
"The San Francisco Police Department has been negligent in securing
our members' rights and has been more concerned with limiting their
rights," said Charles Lamb, president of Local 2 of the Flotel and Res
taurant Employees and Bartenders Union.
The police, he charged, "have been acting as private security guards to
these restaurants," and have been "out taking noise readings while our
members are being beaten and threatened with poisonous chemicals."
He also said at least two union members were "falsely arrested, taken
to jail and booked for no apparent reason. In one case, the district attor
ney refused to prosecute apparently because there was no basis for the
arrests." Twenty-two strikers have been arrested, he said, and all
charges were dropped. Police Capt. William Scheffler denied that offi
( cers were turning their backs on alleged attacks against strikers and said,
on the contrary, there have been more reports of violence by the union.
Reagan vies for Democratic votes
BOSTON — President Reagan, in a buoyant mood on the first day of
a final campaign swing, jousted with hecklers and invoked the name and
memory of John Kennedy yesterday as he urged lifelong Democrats to
vote Republican Tuesday.
Reagan drew cheers and chants of "50 states" from a noisy crowd of
several thousand supporters and boos from hundreds of opponents when
he concluded his speech at an outdoor rally by quoting the words Ken
nedy spoke when he left Masschusetts to assume the presidency in 1961.
In that famous speech Kennedy said that the enduring qualities of
Massachusetts and its diverse heritage "are part of my life, my convic
tion, my views of the past and my hopes in the future."
On the first stop of a 10-state campaign tour, Reagan portrayed
Raymond Shamie, the conservative Republican candidate for U.S. Sen
ate in Massachusetts, as a self-made man who understands the problems
of the poor and the young better than his Democratic opponent, John
Kerry.
In this traditionally Democratic city, Reagan portrayed his adminis
tration and his party as deserving of rank-and-file Democratic support.
He repeated a familiar theme that the Democratic leaders of today had
joined the "blame-America-first crowd" and favored higher taxes that
hurt the middle class.
