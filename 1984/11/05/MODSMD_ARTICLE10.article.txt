Gandhi cremated
NEW DELHI. India — Assassinated Prime Minister
Indira Gandhi was consigned to the flames of a Hindu fu
neral pyre Saturday as a grieving India reeled from four
days of sectarian violence that ranked among the worst
since independence was won 37 years ago.
As nearly 300,000 mourners strained for a glimpse of
the cremation and millions more watched on television,
Gandhi's son and her successor to the leadership of the
world's largest democracy, Rajiv, walked around the fu
neral pyre seven times with a flaming torch in his hand
and turned the sandalwood bier into a sheet of fire.
Leaders representing 100 nations, including 14 presi
dents, attended the funeral. Britain and the Soviet Union
were represented by their prime ministers, Margaret
Thatcher and Nikolai Tikhonov, respectively, and the
United States by Secretary of State George Shultz and
four former U.S. ambassadors to India. Three of India's
neighbors, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, were
represented by their respective presidents.
Shultz and Tikhonov met at the Soviet embassy here for
30 minutes and, according to Indian news agencies, dis
cussed the international situation.
During the meeting, Tikhonov denied that the Soviet
press had linked the United States to the Sikh assassins,
Shultz said afterwards.
"He (Tikhonov) said that he had looked into it and that
the Soviet Union had no such view," Shultz said.
Asked how Tikhonov reconciled that observation with
the press reports, Shultz said, "He suggested I was wrong
in saying they came out of the Soviet Union."
Though Shultz did not comment on Tikhanov's denial,
a U.S. official traveling with the secretary commented,
"The Soviet propaganda organs are hard at work to sow
discord and distrust in India about the U.S., while offi
cially the Soviet government is keeping it at arm's length."
The tranquility of Saturday's cremation spectacle was
offset only partially by the presence of thousands of in

fantry soldiers and armed paramilitary security forces
around the pyre and the approaches to it, vividly under
scoring the fear of Hindu-Sikh violence that kept many
mourners from attending the funeral.
In an effort to restore order to India and to quell
criticism from political opposition within the state, Rajiv
Gandhi yesterday made his first moves to assert authority
as prime minister.
He formally reinstated all but one of his mother's
Cabinet ministers. He also fired the chief civil servant in
the capital for his failure to move more quickly in con
trolling the violence.
And over the weekend, the prime minister met with a
series of foreign leaders, including Pakistani President
Mohammed Zia ul-Haq.
The Indian government placed the official death toll
from four days of Hindu-Sikh violence at 458, but most of
those who have toured riot-torn areas believe that far
more have died. Domestic news agencies place the num
ber of dead nationally at 1,000.
2 more arrests in Poland
WARSAW, Poland — Two senior officials in the Mini
stry of Internal Affairs were arrested in connection with
the death of the Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko, the government
announced Friday night, and a brigadier general, Zenon
Platek, who heads the ministry's department that
monitors religious activities was suspended from his duties
for failing to exercise proper supervision.
Arrested were officers identified only as Col. Adam P.,
who serves in Platek's department, and Lt. Col. Lescek
W., head of an unspecified section in the Warsaw militia.
The officials are the highest ranking to be implicated so
far in an affair that has plunged the regime of Polish
leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski into its most difficult test
since the declaration of martial law nearly three years ago.

Three officers in the secret police — a captain and two
lieutenants — who also report to Platek have already been
charged with Popieluszko's kidnapping Oct. 19 and are
expected to be formally accused soon of his murder. The
cleric's corpse was pulled from a reservoir in Wloclawek
Tuesday.
By acting swiftly to counter what is now generally seen
as a calculated internal challenge to his authority,
Jaruzelski appears anxious to limit the damage done and
reinforce his own position. Few suspect that the plot
against Popieluszko, one of Poland's best-known militant
priests, was limited to a few security officers.
Popieluszko's popularity was underscored Saturday,
when more than a quarter-of-a-million Poles attended an
open-air requiem Mass for him and Roman Catholic offi
cials and opposition figures praised the slain cleric as a
"national hero" for his dedication to Poland's Solidarity
movement.
Stalin's daughter returns
MOSCOW — Svetlana Alliluyeva, the only daughter of
Josef Stalin, returned to the Soviet Union 17 years after
she defected to the United States and repudiated the So
viet system.
An official announcement issued Friday afternoon said
the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, or parliament, had
restored Soviet citizenship to Alliluyeva, 58. It had
been taken from her in 1969.
The Presidium also conferred Soviet citizenship on her
13-year-old daughter, Olga, who was born in the United
States. Olga's father is an American architect, William
Peters, whom Alliluyeva married in 1970. The marriage
broke up two years later.
Alliluyeva's defection in 1967 created a worldwide sen
sation and caused a major propaganda blow to the Krem
lin. Her return created something of a sensation here
Friday night as the official announcement was read over
the main television evening news broadcast and published
in the government newspaper Izvestia.
The circumstances of her return to Moscow were not
disclosed, and it was not possible to reach her or members
of her family. Officials said Alliluyeva and her daughter
were with their relatives. It is believed that the family is at
their country home in Zhubrovka, outside Moscow.
U.S. to give more aid
WASHINGTON — The United States, responding to
.increasingly grim reports of threatened mass starvation in
Ethopia, will immediately ship 50,000 more tons of food
to the drought-stricken nation, U.S. and Ethiopian emer
gency relief officials announced Friday.
Despite Reagan administration criticism of the Ethiop
ian government's response to the crisis, the new shipments
of food will be distributed by the Addis Ababa regime

rather than private relief agencies, M. Peter McPherson,
administrator for the Agency for International Develop
ment, said at a news conference.
Standing at McPherson's side, Ethiopian Relief Com
missioner Dawit Walde Giorgis pledged that his govern
ment will provide substantially more trucks than previ
ously have been available to transport relief supplies.
Giorgis, thanking the American public for its
"overwhelming response," said that the food would be
delivered to all areas of the nation, including those where
insurgents have been fighting government forces.
In New York, a conference of church agencies esti
mated Friday that as many as 10 million Ethiopians might
die from the drought that has plagued the East African
nation for two years. The four-group consortium said that
it had launched a major cooperative effort to distribute
200,000 tons of food in Ethiopia, most of it donated by
Western governments, within the next year.
The additional food from AID — mostly in the form of
grain, worth $12 million — will bring the total U.S. ship
ments to Ethiopia in the last month to 130,127 tons,
worth $51.2 million. A total of $6 million in U.S. medical
supplies has also been allocated since Oct. 1, to be
delivered by the International Red Cross.
Tanker splits, spills oil
SAN FRANCISCO — The stern section of a crippled
petrochemical tanker sank Saturday after breaking up in a
storm, spewing at least a million gallons of oil onto the
surface of the wave-tossed Pacific, the U.S. Coast Guard
said.
The stern of the 632-foot SS Puerto Rican, ripped apart
by three mysterious explosions Wednesday, sank in 2,400
feet of water about 26 miles off the Northern California
coast, and Chief Warrant Officer Dale Puckett said no
one was aboard when it went down.
Officers also said they were fortunate the spill occurred
in fierce ocean water, where it was being dissipated by the
current. "There's very little chance the oil will come
ashore," said another Coast Guard spokesman, John Hol
lis, adding that 1.43 million gallons of various oils had
gone down with the stern. The floating bow has 2.8 mil
lion gallons of oils.
After the pre-dawn sinking of the stern, a tugboat
began towing the remaining two-thirds of the vessel
around the area in an effort to get Coast Guard approval
to bring it under the Golden Gate Bridge to port.
A German salvage vessel took over yesterday the tow
of the bow section, and two large tanks from the bow were
towed to San Francisco Bay for examination in connection
with the explosion that ripped the ship.
Puckett said the empty tanks, which floated free from
the bow section when the ship broke, were considered im
portant as possible evidence of what happened to the ship.

against Popieluszko, one of Poland's best-known militant
priests, was limited to a few security officers.
Popieluszko's popularity was underscored Saturday,
when more than a quarter-of-a-million Poles attended an
open-air requiem Mass for him and Roman Catholic offi
cials and opposition figures praised the slain cleric as a
"national hero" for his dedication to Poland's Solidarity
movement.
Stalin's daughter returns
MOSCOW — Svetlana Alliluyeva, the only daughter of
Josef Stalin, returned to the Soviet Union 17 years after
she defected to the United States and repudiated the So
viet system.
An official announcement issued Friday afternoon said
the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, or parliament, had
restored Soviet citizenship to Alliluyeva, 58. It had
been taken from her in 1969.
The Presidium also conferred Soviet citizenship on her
13-year-old daughter, Olga, who was born in the United
States. Olga's father is an American architect, William
Peters, whom Alliluyeva married in 1970. The marriage
broke up two years later.
Alliluyeva's defection in 1967 created a worldwide sen
sation and caused a major propaganda blow to the Krem
lin. Her return created something of a sensation here
Friday night as the official announcement was read over
the main television evening news broadcast and published
in the government newspaper Izvestia.
The circumstances of her return to Moscow were not
disclosed, and it was not possible to reach her or members
of her family. Officials said Alliluyeva and her daughter
were with their relatives. It is believed that the family is at
their country home in Zhubrovka, outside Moscow.
U.S. to give more aid
WASHINGTON — The United States, responding to
.increasingly grim reports of threatened mass starvation in
Ethopia, will immediately ship 50,000 more tons of food
to the drought-stricken nation, U.S. and Ethiopian emer
gency relief officials announced Friday.
Despite Reagan administration criticism of the Ethiop
ian government's response to the crisis, the new shipments
of food will be distributed by the Addis Ababa regime

rather than private relief agencies, M. Peter McPherson,
administrator for the Agency for International Develop
ment, said at a news conference.
Standing at McPherson's side, Ethiopian Relief Com
missioner Dawit Walde Giorgis pledged that his govern
ment will provide substantially more trucks than previ
ously have been available to transport relief supplies.
Giorgis, thanking the American public for its
"overwhelming response," said that the food would be
delivered to all areas of the nation, including those where
insurgents have been fighting government forces.
In New York, a conference of church agencies esti
mated Friday that as many as 10 million Ethiopians might
die from the drought that has plagued the East African
nation for two years. The four-group consortium said that
it had launched a major cooperative effort to distribute
200,000 tons of food in Ethiopia, most of it donated by
Western governments, within the next year.
The additional food from AID — mostly in the form of
grain, worth $12 million — will bring the total U.S. ship
ments to Ethiopia in the last month to 130,127 tons,
worth $51.2 million. A total of $6 million in U.S. medical
supplies has also been allocated since Oct. 1, to be
delivered by the International Red Cross.
Tanker splits, spills oil
SAN FRANCISCO — The stern section of a crippled
petrochemical tanker sank Saturday after breaking up in a
storm, spewing at least a million gallons of oil onto the
surface of the wave-tossed Pacific, the U.S. Coast Guard
said.
The stern of the 632-foot SS Puerto Rican, ripped apart
by three mysterious explosions Wednesday, sank in 2,400
feet of water about 26 miles off the Northern California
coast, and Chief Warrant Officer Dale Puckett said no
one was aboard when it went down.
Officers also said they were fortunate the spill occurred
in fierce ocean water, where it was being dissipated by the
current. "There's very little chance the oil will come
ashore," said another Coast Guard spokesman, John Hol
lis, adding that 1.43 million gallons of various oils had
gone down with the stern. The floating bow has 2.8 mil
lion gallons of oils.
After the pre-dawn sinking of the stern, a tugboat
began towing the remaining two-thirds of the vessel
around the area in an effort to get Coast Guard approval
to bring it under the Golden Gate Bridge to port.
A German salvage vessel took over yesterday the tow
of the bow section, and two large tanks from the bow were
towed to San Francisco Bay for examination in connection
with the explosion that ripped the ship.
Puckett said the empty tanks, which floated free from
the bow section when the ship broke, were considered im
portant as possible evidence of what happened to the ship.

Gandhi cremated
NEW DELHI. India — Assassinated Prime Minister
Indira Gandhi was consigned to the flames of a Hindu fu
neral pyre Saturday as a grieving India reeled from four
days of sectarian violence that ranked among the worst
since independence was won 37 years ago.
As nearly 300,000 mourners strained for a glimpse of
the cremation and millions more watched on television,
Gandhi's son and her successor to the leadership of the
world's largest democracy, Rajiv, walked around the fu
neral pyre seven times with a flaming torch in his hand
and turned the sandalwood bier into a sheet of fire.
Leaders representing 100 nations, including 14 presi
dents, attended the funeral. Britain and the Soviet Union
were represented by their prime ministers, Margaret
Thatcher and Nikolai Tikhonov, respectively, and the
United States by Secretary of State George Shultz and
four former U.S. ambassadors to India. Three of India's
neighbors, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, were
represented by their respective presidents.
Shultz and Tikhonov met at the Soviet embassy here for
30 minutes and, according to Indian news agencies, dis
cussed the international situation.
During the meeting, Tikhonov denied that the Soviet
press had linked the United States to the Sikh assassins,
Shultz said afterwards.
"He (Tikhonov) said that he had looked into it and that
the Soviet Union had no such view," Shultz said.
Asked how Tikhonov reconciled that observation with
the press reports, Shultz said, "He suggested I was wrong
in saying they came out of the Soviet Union."
Though Shultz did not comment on Tikhanov's denial,
a U.S. official traveling with the secretary commented,
"The Soviet propaganda organs are hard at work to sow
discord and distrust in India about the U.S., while offi
cially the Soviet government is keeping it at arm's length."
The tranquility of Saturday's cremation spectacle was
offset only partially by the presence of thousands of in

fantry soldiers and armed paramilitary security forces
around the pyre and the approaches to it, vividly under
scoring the fear of Hindu-Sikh violence that kept many
mourners from attending the funeral.
In an effort to restore order to India and to quell
criticism from political opposition within the state, Rajiv
Gandhi yesterday made his first moves to assert authority
as prime minister.
He formally reinstated all but one of his mother's
Cabinet ministers. He also fired the chief civil servant in
the capital for his failure to move more quickly in con
trolling the violence.
And over the weekend, the prime minister met with a
series of foreign leaders, including Pakistani President
Mohammed Zia ul-Haq.
The Indian government placed the official death toll
from four days of Hindu-Sikh violence at 458, but most of
those who have toured riot-torn areas believe that far
more have died. Domestic news agencies place the num
ber of dead nationally at 1,000.
2 more arrests in Poland
WARSAW, Poland — Two senior officials in the Mini
stry of Internal Affairs were arrested in connection with
the death of the Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko, the government
announced Friday night, and a brigadier general, Zenon
Platek, who heads the ministry's department that
monitors religious activities was suspended from his duties
for failing to exercise proper supervision.
Arrested were officers identified only as Col. Adam P.,
who serves in Platek's department, and Lt. Col. Lescek
W., head of an unspecified section in the Warsaw militia.
The officials are the highest ranking to be implicated so
far in an affair that has plunged the regime of Polish
leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski into its most difficult test
since the declaration of martial law nearly three years ago.

Three officers in the secret police — a captain and two
lieutenants — who also report to Platek have already been
charged with Popieluszko's kidnapping Oct. 19 and are
expected to be formally accused soon of his murder. The
cleric's corpse was pulled from a reservoir in Wloclawek
Tuesday.
By acting swiftly to counter what is now generally seen
as a calculated internal challenge to his authority,
Jaruzelski appears anxious to limit the damage done and
reinforce his own position. Few suspect that the plot
against Popieluszko, one of Poland's best-known militant

lis, adding that 1.43 million gallons of various oils had
gone down with the stern. The floating bow has 2.8 mil
lion gallons of oils.
After the pre-dawn sinking of the stern, a tugboat
began towing the remaining two-thirds of the vessel
around the area in an effort to get Coast Guard approval
to bring it under the Golden Gate Bridge to port.
A German salvage vessel took over yesterday the tow
of the bow section, and two large tanks from the bow were
towed to San Francisco Bay for examination in connection
with the explosion that ripped the ship.
Puckett said the empty tanks, which floated free from
the bow section when the ship broke, were considered im
portant as possible evidence of what happened to the ship.

Gandhi cremated
NEW DELHI. India — Assassinated Prime Minister
Indira Gandhi was consigned to the flames of a Hindu fu
neral pyre Saturday as a grieving India reeled from four
days of sectarian violence that ranked among the worst
since independence was won 37 years ago.
As nearly 300,000 mourners strained for a glimpse of
the cremation and millions more watched on television,
Gandhi's son and her successor to the leadership of the
world's largest democracy, Rajiv, walked around the fu
neral pyre seven times with a flaming torch in his hand
and turned the sandalwood bier into a sheet of fire.
Leaders representing 100 nations, including 14 presi
dents, attended the funeral. Britain and the Soviet Union
were represented by their prime ministers, Margaret
Thatcher and Nikolai Tikhonov, respectively, and the
United States by Secretary of State George Shultz and
four former U.S. ambassadors to India. Three of India's
neighbors, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, were
represented by their respective presidents.
Shultz and Tikhonov met at the Soviet embassy here for
30 minutes and, according to Indian news agencies, dis
cussed the international situation.
During the meeting, Tikhonov denied that the Soviet
press had linked the United States to the Sikh assassins,
Shultz said afterwards.
"He (Tikhonov) said that he had looked into it and that
the Soviet Union had no such view," Shultz said.
Asked how Tikhonov reconciled that observation with
the press reports, Shultz said, "He suggested I was wrong
in saying they came out of the Soviet Union."
Though Shultz did not comment on Tikhanov's denial,
a U.S. official traveling with the secretary commented,
"The Soviet propaganda organs are hard at work to sow
discord and distrust in India about the U.S., while offi
cially the Soviet government is keeping it at arm's length."
The tranquility of Saturday's cremation spectacle was
offset only partially by the presence of thousands of in

fantry soldiers and armed paramilitary security forces
around the pyre and the approaches to it, vividly under
scoring the fear of Hindu-Sikh violence that kept many
mourners from attending the funeral.
In an effort to restore order to India and to quell
criticism from political opposition within the state, Rajiv
Gandhi yesterday made his first moves to assert authority
as prime minister.
He formally reinstated all but one of his mother's
Cabinet ministers. He also fired the chief civil servant in
the capital for his failure to move more quickly in con
trolling the violence.
And over the weekend, the prime minister met with a
series of foreign leaders, including Pakistani President
Mohammed Zia ul-Haq.
The Indian government placed the official death toll
from four days of Hindu-Sikh violence at 458, but most of
those who have toured riot-torn areas believe that far
more have died. Domestic news agencies place the num
ber of dead nationally at 1,000.
2 more arrests in Poland
WARSAW, Poland — Two senior officials in the Mini
stry of Internal Affairs were arrested in connection with
the death of the Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko, the government
announced Friday night, and a brigadier general, Zenon
Platek, who heads the ministry's department that
monitors religious activities was suspended from his duties
for failing to exercise proper supervision.
Arrested were officers identified only as Col. Adam P.,
who serves in Platek's department, and Lt. Col. Lescek
W., head of an unspecified section in the Warsaw militia.
The officials are the highest ranking to be implicated so
far in an affair that has plunged the regime of Polish
leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski into its most difficult test
since the declaration of martial law nearly three years ago.

Three officers in the secret police — a captain and two
lieutenants — who also report to Platek have already been
charged with Popieluszko's kidnapping Oct. 19 and are
expected to be formally accused soon of his murder. The
cleric's corpse was pulled from a reservoir in Wloclawek
Tuesday.
By acting swiftly to counter what is now generally seen
as a calculated internal challenge to his authority,
Jaruzelski appears anxious to limit the damage done and
reinforce his own position. Few suspect that the plot
against Popieluszko, one of Poland's best-known militant
priests, was limited to a few security officers.
Popieluszko's popularity was underscored Saturday,
when more than a quarter-of-a-million Poles attended an
open-air requiem Mass for him and Roman Catholic offi
cials and opposition figures praised the slain cleric as a
"national hero" for his dedication to Poland's Solidarity
movement.
Stalin's daughter returns
MOSCOW — Svetlana Alliluyeva, the only daughter of
Josef Stalin, returned to the Soviet Union 17 years after
she defected to the United States and repudiated the So
viet system.
An official announcement issued Friday afternoon said
the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, or parliament, had
restored Soviet citizenship to Alliluyeva, 58. It had
been taken from her in 1969.
The Presidium also conferred Soviet citizenship on her
13-year-old daughter, Olga, who was born in the United
States. Olga's father is an American architect, William
Peters, whom Alliluyeva married in 1970. The marriage
broke up two years later.
Alliluyeva's defection in 1967 created a worldwide sen
sation and caused a major propaganda blow to the Krem
lin. Her return created something of a sensation here
Friday night as the official announcement was read over
the main television evening news broadcast and published
in the government newspaper Izvestia.
The circumstances of her return to Moscow were not
disclosed, and it was not possible to reach her or members
of her family. Officials said Alliluyeva and her daughter
were with their relatives. It is believed that the family is at
their country home in Zhubrovka, outside Moscow.
U.S. to give more aid
WASHINGTON — The United States, responding to
.increasingly grim reports of threatened mass starvation in
Ethopia, will immediately ship 50,000 more tons of food
to the drought-stricken nation, U.S. and Ethiopian emer
gency relief officials announced Friday.
Despite Reagan administration criticism of the Ethiop
ian government's response to the crisis, the new shipments
of food will be distributed by the Addis Ababa regime

rather than private relief agencies, M. Peter McPherson,
administrator for the Agency for International Develop
ment, said at a news conference.
Standing at McPherson's side, Ethiopian Relief Com
missioner Dawit Walde Giorgis pledged that his govern
ment will provide substantially more trucks than previ
ously have been available to transport relief supplies.
Giorgis, thanking the American public for its
"overwhelming response," said that the food would be
delivered to all areas of the nation, including those where
insurgents have been fighting government forces.
In New York, a conference of church agencies esti
mated Friday that as many as 10 million Ethiopians might
die from the drought that has plagued the East African
nation for two years. The four-group consortium said that
it had launched a major cooperative effort to distribute
200,000 tons of food in Ethiopia, most of it donated by
Western governments, within the next year.
The additional food from AID — mostly in the form of
grain, worth $12 million — will bring the total U.S. ship
ments to Ethiopia in the last month to 130,127 tons,
worth $51.2 million. A total of $6 million in U.S. medical
supplies has also been allocated since Oct. 1, to be
delivered by the International Red Cross.
Tanker splits, spills oil
SAN FRANCISCO — The stern section of a crippled
petrochemical tanker sank Saturday after breaking up in a
storm, spewing at least a million gallons of oil onto the
surface of the wave-tossed Pacific, the U.S. Coast Guard
said.
The stern of the 632-foot SS Puerto Rican, ripped apart
by three mysterious explosions Wednesday, sank in 2,400
feet of water about 26 miles off the Northern California
coast, and Chief Warrant Officer Dale Puckett said no
one was aboard when it went down.
Officers also said they were fortunate the spill occurred
in fierce ocean water, where it was being dissipated by the
current. "There's very little chance the oil will come
ashore," said another Coast Guard spokesman, John Hol
lis, adding that 1.43 million gallons of various oils had
gone down with the stern. The floating bow has 2.8 mil
lion gallons of oils.
After the pre-dawn sinking of the stern, a tugboat
began towing the remaining two-thirds of the vessel
around the area in an effort to get Coast Guard approval
to bring it under the Golden Gate Bridge to port.
A German salvage vessel took over yesterday the tow
of the bow section, and two large tanks from the bow were
towed to San Francisco Bay for examination in connection
with the explosion that ripped the ship.
Puckett said the empty tanks, which floated free from
the bow section when the ship broke, were considered im
portant as possible evidence of what happened to the ship.
