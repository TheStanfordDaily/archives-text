## The 						Stanford Daily 'No' on Prop. 38 
### 
Proposition 38 would require Gov.
Deukmejian to write a letter to the presi
dent and the congress urging them to amend the
Voting Rights Act so that all official voting ma
terials would be printed only in English.
There are many reasons to vote against this ini
tiative.
First, it is an attack on the Voting Rights Act.
Many people died just so that the right of fran
chise would be extended to all Americans regard
less of race, color, creed or sex. Coming 189
years after we declared that "all men are created
equal" (leaving out women, blacks, Hispanics,
and Native Americans), it was a long overdue
bill. To now amend that bill and effectively dis
enfranchise hundreds of thousands of voters is
going backwards and showing complete disregard
for those that died for equality.
The argument that everybody who lives in
America should speak English reeks of ignorance

and arrogance.
The language on the ballots is not simple,
everyday, easy to understand prose. It is confus
ing and difficult to understand even for those of
us whose first language is English. To expect
people raised with a different culture and lan
guage to exercise the same degree of fluency and
comprehension as the rest of us is unrealistic and
unfair.
Finally, there is a deeper, more insidious
message behind this proposition; a message of
cultural chauvinism. Requiring everybody to be
fluent in English implies that the Euro-American
culture is better than other cultures. America is
not great because it has many people of English
descent. It is great because it tolerates a wide di
versity of cultures.
Passage of Proposition 38 would be an attack
on minorities and a victory for intolerance.
Vote "NO" on Prop. 38.
