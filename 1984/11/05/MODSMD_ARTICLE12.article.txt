# 'No' on Prop. 41
## 
### 
Proposition 41, the welfare initiative, is a cyni
cal, cold-hearted attack on the poor, the elderly,
the disabled and the children of this state.
This initiative would limit California's welfare
spending to 10 percent above the per capita
average of the other 49 states, resulting in several
billion dollars being cut from programs that help
the needy.
Three state offices have concluded that Prop.
41 would result in total cuts of from $2.7 to $3.4
billion from MediCal and Aid to Families with
Dependent Children. Family planning programs
could be cut by 95 percent, and cuts in foster care
could leave the fate of 27,000 children up in the
air.
It is not surprising, then, that 120 medical and
social welfare groups, including the Stanford
Medical Center, oppose the measure. Dr.
Lawrence Crowley, vice president for medical af
fairs at the medical center, warns of the
"devastating impact on health care if this legisla
tion passes." Furthermore, he adds that the vic
tims of the cuts would be the"aged, blind, and

disabled Californians and children, those least
able to fend for themselves."
The sponsors of this initiative are demonstrat
ing contempt for poor people.
Those of us who haven't been born into des
titution and despair, received third-rate educa
tions and been unable to find decent employment
may find it difficult to understand the plight of
the poor. But poor people are not the lying cheats
Prop. 41's sponsors would have us believe.
No one likes to be poor and on welfare.
Moreover, the poor are not lazy. Most poor
people work, and their jobs are generally harder
and nastier than those of corporate executives.
Apparently, the backers of Prop. 41 would
rather see many needy people suffer than one so
called welfare cheat abscond with the taxpayers'
money. People on welfare are not trying to take
anybody's money, they are trying to survive
against great odds. We need to give them a hand,
not a hard time.
Vote "NO" on Prop. 41.
