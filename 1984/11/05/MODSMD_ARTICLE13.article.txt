## New students of the '80s 
### 
Watching some 400 Stanford stu
dents participate in the Stanford
Volunteer Network's Reach Out
Today a week ago has renewed my
faith in today's college student. There
is a spirit that is rising on this campus

VIEWPOINT

in a slow crescendo — that is the
spirit of the 1980s — service.
For those who participated in one
of the 20-plus community-service
projects, the rewards were in the
smiles of the elderly they talked to,
the laughter of the kids who looked
up to them, the satisfaction of clean
ing up a yard that hours before was in
utter chaos. To understate the fact,
those that we helped were thrilled
that a bunch of students would give
up their Saturday — midterms and all
— for them. Stanford students of
every type — from freshmen to grad
students, from every ethnic group and
background you could name,
representing dorms or clubs — were
all side by side working to help those
around them, many of whom they
had never met before. It was a truly
inspiring sight.

Today's new breed are students
/argely motivated by a constructive
force. Often misinterpreted as being
selfish and overly concerned with
career goals, the students of the '80s
are actually searching for a produc
tive way to use their skills for the
benefit of society, as well as them
selves. An increase in the number of
students going into business and engi
neering is not an increase in the drive
for the almighty dollar; it is really a
way of saying "I'd like to do some
thing productive with my life —
now!" Regardless of major or career
choice, the factor that distinguishes
these students from their predeces
sors is the spirit of serving others.
Speaking as one of the new breed, I
can say that the spirit of service per
meates everything we do — from
career goals to academics to extracur
ricular activities to relationships —
the emphasis is on giving. For the
growing number of this new breed,
the school year is looked upon not as
a game where the object is to mini
mize studying while maximizing so
cial life and GPAs. Rather, it is a time
to make the most of every opportu
nity to learn, to participate, to give

and to love.
I know there are some out there
who are here primarily to "Work,
Study and Get Rich." It is you that I
feel the most sorry for — to go
through your years at Stanford with
out ever doing something for those
around you is truly a sad story. It is
time you woke up. On this campus,
fortunately, your kind is a dying
breed.
The tide here has turned toward
the spirit of service. You can mark
the day of service a week ago as the
turning-point if you like. More stu
dents are catching the spirit and dis
covering the secret of helping others
— that in giving to another person,
the giver benefits more than the
receiver.
"Service," says University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy, "is nothing
less than the infusion of meaning into
one's life." Yes, this is the spirit of the
'80s. But you'll never catch it by
spending your entire Saturday in the
library.
