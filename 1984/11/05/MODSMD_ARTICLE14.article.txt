## Democrats need an identity 
### 
Up until the Democratic National Convention,
Jesse Jackson was the mover and shaker of the
Democratic Party. Gary Hart was the smart candi
date and Walter Mondale was the inevitable
nominee, but Jackson was the one with flair and a
message. Jackson understands what is vital to the
Democratic Party. If the Democrats are to remain
the majority party they have to get back to broad
base politics. They have to appeal to the huge num
bers of people who aren't benefiting from President
Reagan's economic recovery. That's what the
Rainbow Coalition is all about.
Even at the convention, Jackson was out front.
His speech was by far the best of the three candi
dates, and he stuck to the themes he had based his
campaign on. Jackson had the power to appeal to
minorities, and it seemed he was going to do just
that.
But what has happened to Jackson since then?
What's happened to Gary Hart, John Glenn, Ted
Kennedy and Ernest Hollings? Have they united to
work on behalf of the Democratic ticket? No, they
clearly have not. John Glenn isn't even campaign
ing for Mondale-Ferraro in Ohio, and Jackson
started criticizing the racial balance of the cam
paign staff immediately after the convention.
But the question "Have they united to work on
behalf of the Democratic Party?" is really not to
the point. A more pertinent question may well be:
Has the Democratic Party, and more specifically,
this Democratic ticket, unified the Democratic
Party? Again, the answer is clearly no.
There's no way of getting around the fact that
part of the problem is Walter Mondale himself. He
simply isn't a mover or a shaker. Because Mondale
didn't appear to be a feasible candidate between
the time the convention euphoria wore off and the
point where he made a strong showing in the first

presidential debate, a lot of team unity was lost.
National Democratic funding organizations deter
mined that it was more strategic to fund local and
regional races than the presidential race.
The fundamental problem is the lack of a Demo
cratic Party identity. We rallied around Cuomo's
New Deal speech, but that may not be good enough
any more. Blue-collar workers are now as likely to
behave as middle-class Republican voters as they
are as Democratic Party supporters. Overall, the

Overall, the Democratic
Party can no longer be
sure of the support of
even traditionally Demo
cratic voting groups.

Democratic Party can no longer be sure of the sup
port of even traditionally Democratic voting
groups.
As a result, the party has had to operate on pins
and needles, and that creates problems for
"extremists" like Jesse Jackson. Some analysts
feel Mondale may have asked Jackson to maintain
a low profile so as not to further aggravate South
ern whites in the wake of the Bert Lance fiasco. A
strong Jackson profile might also offend Jewish
voters, especially important in New York. On the
whole, while Jackson was a positive influence
within the black community, the tenuous position

of the Democratic Party with respect to the
majority of white voters meant that Jackson had to
be subservient.
Initially I had intended to criticize Jackson for
bailing out and acting too autonomously. I felt he
had failed to utilize his strong position to produce
Democratic support. But on further analysis, I
think wc have to question whether or not there
were really many avenues Jackson could have
pursued. The Democratic position vis-a-vis Ameri
can voters is so uncertain, and the Democratic
nominee so uninspiring that many Democrats have
found it difficult to work effectively for the party.
Jackson's drive to register Democratic voters is
probably the most productive path he could have
chosen.
Columnist George Will claims that the roles of
America's political parties have switched. The
Republicans have taken over the historically Dem
ocratic role as the party of prosperity for the
majority. The Democrats have assumed the tradi
tionally Republican position as the party of
frugality, pragmatism and realism. Will Rogers
once said that he didn't belong to any organized
party â€” he was a Democrat.
Both men got to the heart of the Democratic
problem, and until the Democratic party can
redefine its position as the party of the majority
and organize itself around that theme, the success
of the party will be imperiled. The task of unifying
a party as diverse as Jesse Jackson, Ron Dellums
and John Glenn is a formidable one, especially in
the face of a Republican resurgence. But until the
party finds itself again, it will not be the party of
average Americans, minorities and women that it
has the potential to be.
