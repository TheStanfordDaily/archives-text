## 'Star Wars' not appropriate 
### 
Not long ago you ran a letter to the editor, "Don't bust
Reagan" (The Daily, Oct. 25), by a Stanford freshman
concerned about the "misconceptions of the space
weapons system." He seemed especially anxious about
Democratic presidential candidate Walter Mondale's lack
of knowledge, naivete and idealism in expressing his op
position to that plan in the previous Sunday's debate. Let
me say that the young writer is himself quite idealistic,
naive and at a lack for knowledge regarding the so-called
"Star Wars" plan.
From the start, however, I'd like to put him and those
who agreed with his letter at ease by agreeing that they

VIEWPOINT

are right. The Star Wars defense system was never meant
to be used as an offensive weapon. By treaty agreement,
in fact, the deployment of weapons in space is banned.
Otherwise the Strategic Defense Initiative would prob
ably have been called the Strategic Offense Initiative. If
and when we get this system up into orbit we're only going
to be allowed to use it as a defensive measure anyway. "So
what are Mondale and all of the rest of us worried
about?" the writer seems to be saying. Again, I must
agree. Let's relax about the whole thing. It won't lead to
an arms buildup as Mondale claims. It won't even "incite
paranoia in the Soviet leadership." At least not as much as
Mondale's Midgetman proposal.
But, wouldn't you just know it: Though the deployment
of weapons in space is a no-no according to this treaty, the
research into this techr logy and the development of
weapons on it are are nut prohibited. I'll bet most of us
never really considered this fact. Still, let's not get overly
excited. The Star Wars plan is "only theory" and the un
derlying technology is little more than a twinkle in its con
ceivers' eyes. The most powerful laser in the world today
(the Nova at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory)
is only capable of emitting a mere 150 trillion watts.
Naturally we have to improve on this because to produce
such a burst now requires facilities the size of the Quad.
We do have much smaller nuclear detonated X-ray beam
devices being tested, in Nevada for example, for planned
use in space, that will eventually be even more powerful.
Indeed, we need such power in order to knock out those
incoming Soviet missiles, capable of reaching our soil 12
minutes after their launch. In fact, we could even vaporize
Lenin's tomb from high above Minnesota if we wanted
to. Just pretend we missed one of those incoming SS-20s.
An idea in this vein would not be an unrealistic notion,
would it? And our president now wants to give the tech
nology to the Soviets? Does he think we could get them to
promise, by crossing their hearts and hoping to die, that
they would never use our "gifts" against us or against our
own theoretical space defense system? Or would we have
to send specialists to Moscow to monitor the use of their
new technology? Who is the one that's idealistic and
naive?
Well, all right, what if, as Mondale urges, we don't give
the Soviets our space defense system technology? We

continue to research and develop and soon find that the
construction of a defensive "curtain" against the threat of
a Soviet nuclear attack is imminent. The poor Soviets: All
they have are their missiles now. We have our missiles and
a curtain.
Now what are you gonna do, you nasty Soviets? You
had better just give up while you still have a prayer 'cause
we know your missiles ain't gonna cut it anymore. And
they'd probably give up, right? Or at least start disman
tling their weapons stockpile, right?
It turns out that that is more like wishful thinking. The
paranoia incited in the Soviet leadership by our very dis
cussion of the space defense system plan is already causing
a frenzy in Moscow. What will happen when we actually
begin its implementation? The reaction, as one could ex
pect from a cornered bear, might well be an all-out nu
clear attack of unfathomable proportion before we would
even have a chance to complete the system's space

deployment. I don't think we'd last too long in that
scenario by "holding out for optimum terms," as the
writer suggests we do.
The answer to the threat of nuclear war does not lie in
the development of more advanced technology. This is a
human problem. Never in the history of the world has
more advanced technology been the solution to a conflict
between nations unless it resulted in victory for one side.
Have we really decided that war is inevitable and should
be fought in space rather than on earth? Will we go after vic
tory? This isn't science fiction or the planet Krypton. We are
humans and therefore capable of the decision to come to
terms as such.
Reagan has a preference for mutually assured defense
as opposed to mutually assured destruction. Yet, no mat
ter how I read it, the acronyms as well as the ideas are ut
terly MAD, and only spell more MADness. The
president's intentions are unquestionably good, but we all
know where the road paved with those can lead.
