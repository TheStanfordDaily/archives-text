# Forgivable federal loans
## University lobbies for public service incentive 
### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
As part of University President Donald Kennedy's
promotion of public service, a University staff member is
working on federal legislation that would make govern
ment loans more attractive to students who commit them
selves to helping others.
Catherine Milton, special assistant to Kennedy for
public service, is conferring with representatives from uni
versities across the country in an effort to design legisla
tion that would receive the support of the leaders of
h gvier education in the United States.
Although the project is still in the planning stages and
the legislation has not been written, Milton said the idea is
to create an incentive for students to enter public service
through programs that would either reduce the amount
that students would have to pay back on their government
loans or forgive students of those loans entirely.
Milton said the project is based on "the theory that
you're going to get a loan from your country and you have
to give something back."
Representatives from Stanford, Brown, Harvard and
Vanderbilt, as well as from the Carnegie and Ford
Foundations, will meet with congressional staff members
next month in Washington, D.C., to discuss proposals for
the legislation.
Milton, along with Asst. Dean of Student Affairs Mar
garet Ann Fidler and Council of Presidents Chair Melissa
Auchard, met with representatives from Brown, Harvard
and Yale during an East Coast swing in September. Last
week, a representative from Brown came to Stanford to
firm up plans and strategy for next month's Washington
meeting.
Susan Stroud, an assistant to Brown's president who is
working on this project, spent several days here in
meetings with Milton discussing the project.
According to Stroud, students who participate in the
loan program "would be expected to spend a particular
'period of time in public service in exchange for the gov
ernment paying for their education."
Stroud said there is no accepted definition of public ser
vice, but she includes "any direct service to particular
populations . . . working with the elderly, handicapped
and poor."
Kennedy's ardent promotion of public service resulted
in the creation of an admininstrative position. Milton was
hired to.oversee public service in July 1983.
Since then, she has supervised a variety of programs
targeted to increase student involvment in public service.
Projects under her guidance include the "You Can Make
A Difference" conference, the $10,000 Public Service
Summer Fellowship Program, the Stanford Volunteer
Network and the public service advisory program. In ad
dition, she is working closely with the people from

Stanford-in-Government to open a campus in Washing
ton, D.C. and to develop more internship programs in
Washington and Sacramento.
Stroud, who also serves as the director of the 11-
member College Venture Consortium, said the legislation
will probably be modeled after programs that historically
have provided personal benefits in exchange for govern
ment service.
One such program is the G.I. Bill, a measure introduced
after World War II to provide tuition benefits to former
soldiers who wanted to continue their education.
Similar incentive programs for teachers and doctors
have'also proved successful, Stroud said.
She said these bills have "been a pretty effective way of
exchanging educational benefits for service." Stroud and
Milton say they are hoping to capitalize on the success of
these models.
"We hope to put through a Gl-like bill that, instead of
military service, would reward students who had been in
volved in public service," Stroud said.
She said the legislation might be attached to the
Higher Education Reauthorization Bill — a measure due
to come before Congress in 1985 — or it might be intro
duced as an independent bill.
In any event, Stroud said they will have to work within
"Hill politics" both to get the legislation considered and
to find the best sponsors.
"Good legislative ideas can fail if they're not introduced
by the right people," she said. "It's a question of who's
going to have the best chance of pushing this through "
Stroud mentioned Sen Daniel Patrick Moymhan (D
N.Y.), as a possible sporsoi
She also concedcs thai the legislation hinges on who is
sitting in the White House. Even if Congress approves the
measure, it might fall victim to the budget-cutting sword
of a second Reagan administration, Stroud said.
"The current administration is doing its level best to
decrease the amount of financial support for these pro
grams," she said.
Nevertheless, Stroud and Milton are confident, partly
because they predict support from the presidents of many
of the country's major universities. Stroud said the timing
is particularly good because many top educators are sym
pathetic to legislation of this kind.
"We've got a group of university presidents nationally
who have taken stands on public service," she said.
"There's sort of a generation of college presidents who
are similar in age and have had public service [and that]
makes them sympathetic to the idea of encouraging col
lege students to the idea of public service careers," she
said.
According to Stroud, Kennedy and Brown President
Howard Swearer are two of the
leaders of this new movement.
"Kennedy is right outfront, taking

a real leadership role," she said.
Other universities that have indi
cated support for legislation linking
financial aid with public service in
clude Johns Hopkins, Notre Dame,
Pennsylvania, Columbia, George
town and the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology according to Milton.
