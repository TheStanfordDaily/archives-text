## Support groups help children of alcoholics 
### FRANK LESTER Staff writer 
If you are a Stanford student, the
chances are one in twelve that one or
both of your parents is an alcoholic,
according to Steve Jacobson, a clini
cal psychologist at the Stanford Alco
hol Ginic. This statistic becomes even
scarier when coupled with another:
The chances of your becoming an al
coholic are two to four times higher if
you are the child of an alcoholic than
if you are not.
"It would not be difficult to imag
ine that among undergraduates at
Stanford there are perhaps a
thousand adult children of al
coholics," he said. He based this esti
mate on statistics conducted on a na-

they get older.

tional basis showing that alcoholism
affects 8 percent of the American
population. According to related es
timates, there are between 28 and 34
million children of alcoholics in this
country.
Stephanie Brown, the director of
the alcohol clinic, calls children of al
coholics a "treatment population
never before identified." Part of the
problem of being the child of an al
coholic, she wrote in an article in the
Stanford Magazine in 1982, is
denying that you have any problems
as the result of having grown up in an
alcoholic environment.
This is especially true at Stanford,
she said, where wealthy students with
alcoholic parents hide behind a mask
of self-confidence and success.
"Affluence confers a sense of special
ness and entitlement," Brown wrote.
"It confers authority, legitimacy and
a belief in immunity — all absolutely

contrary to acknowledging a lack of
control."
"Many people believe that they
can't possibly be alcoholic if they
have managed to become part of the
Stanford community in any capacity,"
she wrote.
This denial extends to children of
alcoholics as well, according to Jacob
son. "Children of alcoholics at Stan
ford often appear to be successful,
but inside, they're struggling much
more than other people realize," he
said.
Jacobson depicted the internal
struggle of children of alcoholics as
involving feelings of instability,
manifested in self-consciousness,

guilt and anxiety. Jacobson said that
these feelings are developed partly as
a result of their having had to put on a
front of maturity as children to deal
with their parents' lack of stability.
The problems this internal denial
engenders often do not show up until
the child graduates from college and
is thrust into the adult world, Jacob
son said.
When it comes time for the
children of alcoholics to become in
volved in an intimate relationship,
they find that they cannot get close to
their partners, and feel uncomfort
able displaying affection. These kinds
of problems can be avoided with dis
cretion in college, Jacobson said, but
when relationships assume more real
istic proportions — for example, in a
marriage — the internal conflicts
come to a head.
One particularly striking way in
which these unresolved conflicts af

feet the thinking of children of al
coholics is in the bearing and raising
of their own children. "They feel a
lack of confidence in being able to be
a good parent because they don't feel
they have models of what it is to be a
good parent," Jacobson said.
"Their standards become idealistic.
They have to create an ideal, and it
seems like too much for them to do."
Thus, Jacobson said, many children
of alcoholics forego having children
altogether.
Momentous life decisions such as
these, in addition to continuing in
securities about their role in the adult
world, cause many children of al
coholics to turn to the bottle them
selves for solace as they get older,
Jacobson said. When they are intox
icated, they don't have to think about
their insecurities.
According to Jacobson, this very
effect is partly what makes alcohol
such a force in the American social
climate. "It's the American way to
believe in quick results to deal with
stress," he said. "For a lot of people,
there's no quicker way on an immedi
ate basis to get relief than to use
drugs like alcohol."
Jacobson condemns this "quick
results" philosophy as being inherent
in the way the University deals with
alcohol on campus. "The University
doesn't want to alienate people. Part
of the myth is that this is a good-time
school. People at Stanford are
supposed to be mellow, relaxed, not
intellectuals.
"Alcohol abuse is tied up in the
image of Stanford and the type of
place it wants itself to be known as,
which makes it very attractive for a
lot of students. If Stanford came
down hard against alcoholism, it
would create a backlash.
"You're considered abnormal
around here if you point the finger
and say, 'This is ridicuolous. This is
wrong. Why is alcohol being used
here for these purposes?' " he said.
Two programs exist on campus to
help children of alcoholics come to
terms with their internal conflicts.
One is the traditional Al-Anon pro
gram, which relies on ritualistic
confession to help its members admit
their powerlessness over alcohol.
Most of the members of the Al-
Anon group, which meets each Tues
day at 8 p.m. in the University Lu

theran Church, are already well into
the adult world and are dealing more
with their personal struggles than
with any immediate problems with
their parents, Jacobson said.
Much of the confessional therapy
that goes on in this group revolves
around the members' quest for the
"priceless gift of serenity."
Jacobson said that Al-Anon's
ritualistic approach to helping al
coholics' children overcome their
problems is beneficial to many
people.
The other Stanford program
for children of alcoholics is
run out of the alcohol clinic itself. It is
basically a secularized and specialized

version of the Al-Anon group.
Whereas the Al-Anon group is in
tent on dealing with the long-term in
ternal conflicts of its members, the
clinic's student group is equipped to
"spend a lot more time sharing with
each other what's happening right
now in the members' families," ac
cording to Jacobson.
This is because "students are more
currently involved with their parents"
than members of the traditional
groups. "Students are trying to get
more independence from their par
ents. The alcohol problem of the par
ents impinges on their lives. It upsets
them, it keeps them from studying, it
preoccupies them," Jacobson said.

In the student group, he said,
"there's more of a supportive empha
sis than is true in the other groups."
From Jacobson's point of view,
Stanford has a "real soft policy" on
limiting how much alcohol students
can consume. Authorities
"rationalize" their laxness, he said,
"in terms of students being mature
enough to make their own decisions."
Jacobson said that this maturity
isn't as much in evidence as it would
be if students, especially those from
alcoholic families, took a long look at
their internal doubts and fears about
alcohol and acceptance. This long
look, he thinks, is what the groups on
campus can offer.
