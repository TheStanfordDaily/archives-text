# 'Patsy's Legacy' exposes problems of abuse, power in relationships
## RAPE EDUCATION PROJECT AT STANFORD PRESENTS PATSY'S LEGACY 
### MARY YUH Staff writer 
Rape, incest, battery: issues diffi
cult to discuss, difficult even to con
template. "Patsy's Legacy" is a play
presented by the Rape Education
Project that treats these issues in an
honest manner. Avoiding the pitfalls
ot sensationalism, all-encompassing
rage, and stridency, "Patsy's Legacy"
treads carefully and yet openly into
areas layered with emotion, contro
versy and pain.
Set in a rape crisis center, "Patsy's
Legacy" focuses on two victims.
Jennie, a counselor played by
Suzanne Wight, is a victim of incest
who had blocked the memories from
her mind, and only recently have
these memories surfaced to her con
sciousness. Rocked by the realization
that she is a survivor of incest, she
quits her counseling job and attempts
to come to terms with her experience
and her feelings of rage and betrayal.
Roxanne, a client played by Juanita
Pena Franco, is a victim of wife abuse
who discovers her husband engaging
in oral sex with her 10-year-old
daughter. To her, the most important
thing is to shield her daughter from
further harm, and she does, but only
at the price of her own freedom.
"Patsy's Legacy" is simultaneously
set in an 1840 jail cell where the slave
woman, Patsy, is held for the murder
of her newborn daughter. Patsy,
played by Isoke Ndeya Femi, is the
victim of continual rape by her slave
master, and her child is the product of
those rapes.
Like Roxanne, the most important
thing to Patsy is to save her child from
harm. She knows that her child, being
a slave and being female, will in
evitably be exposed to the same kind
of treatment that she herself has ex
perienced. And so, out of tremendous
love and strength, she smothers her
daughter.
"Patsy's Legacy" depicts three
abused women, their situations, their
support resources and their
responses. From Jennie who has all
the support of a group of friends and
counselors, to Patsy who has no one
except herself, the play delves into
the emotions and dynamics of the in
dividual situations, exposing their dif
ferences and, more important, their

similarities.
Each woman experiences rage,
feelings of helplessness, guilt and
personal violation. And when they
reach their conclusions and make
their decisions, they experience a tre
mendous amount of release and tri
umph. They have overcome their ex
periences.
In addition to the women there are
several male characters, men who are
important in the lives of the women
and who have formed a support
group in order to understand their
relationships better.
According to playwright Toni
Press, the men are present because

the abuse of women is a societal issue,
one involving both males and
females, and she wanted to show a
continuum of male-female relation
ships from the progressive and en
lightened to the abusive and op
pressive.
The play shows that even in the
progressive relationship, there is still
an element of male dominance. The
scene that really pinpoints this is one
in which the director of the rape crisis
center breaks down and cries. Her
lover responds to this with "let's go
get you a bikini" and "come to
Sausalito with me, baby."
The sexism and take-charge atti

tude in those remarks is seen as only
as a very mild version of the sexism
and domination expressed in rape.
This scene, said Press, dem
onstrates that the issue behind rape
and the abuse of women is one of
power in a relationship. The problem
is that power is unequally distributed
and society conditions men to expect
the greater share of power in a rela
tionship, so much so that men will
resort to violence in order to achieve
power, said Press. It points out that
power is demonstrated through other,
subtler, and often unconscious
means.
