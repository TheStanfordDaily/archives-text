## USC turns lights out on Stanford 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
Stanford Coach Jack Elway said
it week that "it's obvious we're not
ing to win a football game in any
nventional way or manner."
But Elway said nothing about
iing, and Stanford lost a football
me Saturday to the University of
uthern California Trojans, 20-11,
a pretty conventional way or man
r.
USC had five turnovers, four in the
:ond half. Stanford failed to capi
ize on any of them. '
That conventionally results in a
s, and Saturday's dropped the Car
lal to 4-5 overall and 2-4 in the
cific 10 Conference. The 18th
lked Trojans, meanwhile, stayed
>p the conference at 6-0, and are 7-
>verall.
'Our defense played a tremendous
me," said Elway, who was at his
ain-smoking best in his post-game
erview session, polishing off five
arettes in 20 minutes. "We had our
portunities (on offense) and didn't
lh in."
Sophomore John Paye, who was
way's surprise starter at quarter
ed also had his opportunities, but
ly a quarter-and-a-half worth,
ye, playing in his first game since
taking his right index finger five
:eks ago, injured the the middle
iger on his right hand midway
•ough the second quarter.
X-rays revealed the finger is not
oken and instead has tendon
mage. Nonetheless, Paye is listed
uncertain for next week's game at
i University of Arizona and his

status will be determined on a day
by-day basis.
Saturday's game was the Cardinal's
last this season at Stanford Stadium
and the first ever played under lights.
Although the portable lights were
used for the entire second half, the
lights on Stanford's party — and
chances for an upset — went out just
minutes into the third quarter.
USCs Elbert Watts fumbled the
second-half kickoff, Stanford's Paul
Svitenko recovered it, and the Car
dinal had the ball at the Trojan 21-
yard line. Three runs by Brad Muster
and another by Kevin Scott made it
second and goal from the two.
Muster, who gained 57 of Stan
ford's 65 net rushing yards, went up
the middle on both second and third
down but was still eight inches short
of a touchdown.
On fourth down, Elway sent
Muster up the middle again. Again,
the Trojans stopped him.
"I was gonna go for it and I'd do it
again," Elway said of his decision not
to kick a field goal. "We wanted a
touchdown. I called the wrong play.
"I'd do that (go for the touchdown)
over again, but I'd choose the quar
terback sneak," he continued. "I'd
choose any goddamn play but that one.
Getting that touchdown could've
changed things."
Fred Buckley, who was in the
familiar position of replacing a start
ing quarterback with a finger injury,
agreed the goal-line stand was the
turning point in the game.
"I think that changed the com
plexion of the game," he said. "There

were no mistakes on our part. They
just made a great play."
Though a touchdown there would
have given Stanford a 10-7 lead, not
to mention momentum, USC wasn't
finished giving the Cardinal golden
opportunities to score. As if fumbling
the kickoff wasn't enough, the
.Trojans turned the ball over on their
next two possessions as well.
And Stanford squandered both op
portunities, the first after Toi Cook
intercepted at the Trojan 48 and the
second after Dave Wyman recovered
a fumble at the Cardinal 47.
The latter drive ended when Mark
Harmon missed a 43-yard field goal,
one that would have made him Stan
ford's all-time leading scorer. As it
was, Harmon scored only three
•points, a 36-yard field goal with nine"
seconds left in the first half and is
one point behind Darrin Nelson's
record of 242.
"We feel very fortunate that we
can make those kind of mistakes and
have our guys believe so strongly that
we'll find a way to win, that they keep
playing," USC Coach Ted Tollner
said of his team's four second-half
turnovers.
"Normally, when you have that
many turnovers, you're going to get
beat," he continued, "unless your
defense comes up with a magnificent
performance. And they did."
Stanford averaged just 1.9 yards
per rushing attempt (65 yards on 33
carries) and Cardinal quarterbacks
completed just 12-of-29 passes for

149 yards.
"We felt like we could establish a
running game early on, but we just
came up short both times," Paye said
of the Stanford offense, which didn't
throw a pass in the first quarter. "We
came up half a yard short on both
third downs (of its first two posses
sions)."
In the meantime, USC was doing
exactly what Stanford couldn't —
running the football and capitalizing
on the opposition's mistakes.
Tailback Fred Crutcher was the
Trojans' only running threat, but with
statistics like 146 yards on 41 carries,
he was all they needed.
Crutcher also scored USC's two
second-half touchdowns, both of
which followed Buckley interceptions
in the fourth quarter. Crutcher
capped a 56-yard, 12-play drive by
going into the end zone from a yard
out with 11:02 remaining. Less than
four minutes later, Crutcher put the
game out of reach with another one
yard plunge. Steve Jordan, who
missed a point-after on the previous
touchdown, kicked this one to make
the score 20-3.
Stanford mounted a too-little, too
late comeback with 1:46 to go when
Buckley found Thomas Henley in the
end zone and then hit freshman Carl
Morris over the middle for a two
point conversion that cut USC's lead
to 20-11. Stanford got the ball back
with 0:51 left, but Buckley fumbled
while being sacked and USC
linebacker Jack Del Rio recovered it.

End of comeback.
Besides the Trojans' turnovers, the
only thing that kept the Cardinal in
the game was freshman Doug
Robison's punting. Robison, who
punted seven times for an average of
44.4 yards per kick, has been erratic
all season. Saturday happened to be a
game when he was erratically good.
"Our special teams did well and
our defense did extremely well," El
way said. "But we couldn't get a han
dle offensively, couldn't get going
consistently. We flat out didn't score,
that's all."
Card notes
This from Sports Illustrated's
"They Said It" section: "Pat Haden,
CBS-TV college football commenta
tor, late in Ohio State's 45-38 win
over Illinois, 'The defenses have
played like the Stanford band.'
Haden, a Rhodes scholar, played
quarterback at USC in the mid
-19705.
Stanford's third-quarter scoring
problems continued Saturday. The
Cardinal, which has been outscored
43-17 in the third quarter, was shut
out Saturday in the third period for
the seventh time this season.
Stanford's rushing total of 65 yards
was not its season low. Against
Arizona State University, ironically
the first game Paye injured a finger,
the Cardinal rushed for only 61. But
the big question is, when was the last
time a Stanford team did not throw a
pass in the first quarter? When was
the forward pass invented?

Sophomore running back Brad Muster (25) was Stanford's leading rusher, unfortunately he didn't lead the
team to very much. The Cardinal gained only 65 yards on 33 carries.


USC tailback Fred Crutcher (49) scored two touchdowns and rushed
for 146 yards on 41 carries, as the Trojans ground out another victory

Rod Searcey/Daily
over the Cardinal. Both of Crutcher's touchdowns came after Stanford
turnovers, as USC was able to capitalize on Stanford errors.
