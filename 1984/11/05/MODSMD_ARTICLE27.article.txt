# Paye would rather be all thumbs

I The heralded comeback of quarter
back John Paye lasted all of a quarter
and a half.
| Paye started Saturday's game
against the University of Southern

California, threw four passes, com
pleted none of them, and then left the
game in the middle of the second
quarter.
With another injured finger on his
right hand.
This time, Paye injured his middle

finger, the next door neighbor of the
index finger that spent most of the
last five weeks in a splint — and not
throwing a football.
Although X-rays revealed Paye's
middle finger isn't broken, like his in
dex finger was, they did show that it
has tendon damage. Doctors are call
ing it an extensor tendon injury and
list Paye as "uncertain" for next Sat
urday's game at the University of
Arizona.
The good news is that Stanford has
only two games left, meaning Paye
can at most injure a finger in his right
hand twice more this season.
"I just can't believe I hurt another
finger," a downcast Paye said. "I was
really excited today. This was a big
game and the team was really up for
it."
Paye broke the lower knuckle in his
index finger five weeks ago against
Arizona State University when the
follow-through on a pass introduced
his hand to a defender's helmet. Sat
urday's version of "To Hurt a Finger"
was just as freaky.
On third and 19 from the Trojan
40-yard line, Paye dropped back to
pass and, under pressure, scrambled
right towards the USC sideline with
6-foot-5, 235-pound Duane Bickett
in hot pursuit. "I didn't really get hurt
when I got hit," Paye explained, "but
when I fell on it (the finger)."
Paye, perhaps favoring his still
swollen and sore index finger, broke
his fall with his right hand and, in par
ticular, his middle finger.
"He turned his arm and his hand
broke the fall," USC Coach Ted Toll
ner said. "I could tell from his reac
tion that he was hurt. I was trying to
keep him calm until the Stanford
trainers got there."
Paye, whose finger will be in a
splint until it is well enough to throw
again, said he tried to shake off the
injury on the sidelines, but to no
avail.
"I felt like I could still throw, I just
didn't have any velocity," he said.
it was up to me (if I
wanted return). But I just couldn't

throw the ball with the velocity I
wanted."
Instead, on came Fred Buckley, the
man who led Stanford to two road
victories in his four-week stint as
Paye's replacement. Buckley played
the rest of the game and completed
12-of-25 passes for 149 yards and
one touchdown. Buckley also threw
two fourth-quarter interceptions,
both of which led to Trojan touch
downs.
Buckley, however, said he was
planning to play Saturday, though not
as Paye's replacement. Buckley
thought he would start against the
Trojans and admitted he was "a little
bit" surprised when Coach Jack El
way gave Paye the starting call.
"I had a good week (of practice)
and I didn't know how healthy John
(Paye) was," Buckley said. "I guess
he made the decision last (Friday)
night."
Elway decided Friday night, but
didn't tell the two quarterbacks until
the morning before the game. And
when a persistent reporter asked him
where he told Paye that he would
start Saturday, Elway joked, "Let's
see. 1 think we were in the lavatory
and 1 was in one stall and John was in
the other.
"It was a matter of positive think
ing," Elway said. "He (Paye) looked
good in practice all week and threw
well. I asked him if there was any
thing he couldn't do and he said, 'No.'
"I thought it was a tremendous
decision," he continued. "I'm proud
of myself and I'd do it again."
While Buckley was surprised with
Elway's decision, he didn't second
guess it."It was handled like anything
the coaches have handled all year —
very professionally," Buckley said.
"As I've said from day one, he
(Elway) has been nothing but fair
with me.
"Not at all did I feel like a forgot
ten man this week," he continued.
"When a player comes back, the at
tention should be centered on him. It
wasn't like I was cast aside, or not
given dinner or anything."

Senior quarterback Fred Buckley was relegated to his previous position
as a backup before the game. By the end, however, he was once again
replacing injured starter |ohn Paye.

Sophomore John Paye was the vision of dejection and frustration as his
return to the Stanford lineup was spoiled by another injury to his
throwing hand.
