### INGRID SEYER Staff sportswriter 
A season-record crowd was on hand Saturday after
noon to watch the No. 1 -ranked Stanford water polo team
defeat USC, 8-7, at DeGuerre Pool in a Pacific 10 Con
ference match.
The victory boosted the Cardinal's bid for the top seed
in the National Collegiate Athletic Association champion
ships to be held Nov. 24-25 at Long Beach. Stanford, 4-0
in the Pac-10, now holds a one-game lead over second
ranked University of California at Berkeley (3-1) and a
two-game lead over No. 3 USC (2-2).
Sophomore David Imbernino led the Cardinal's scoring
with four goals. According to Stanford Coach Dante Det
tamanti, lmbernino's play in Saturday's match was impor
tant to the game's outcome.
"Imbernino came through with the crucial goals when
we needed them," Dettamanti said. "He was in the right
places at the right times and he was really shooting well."
Imbernino, who now leads the Cardinal in scoring with
49 goals, was pleased with his play, but felt the victory was
a team effort.

"Our intensity was really up for this same," Imbernino
said. "We were all working hard, and it just turned out I
was the one who had the most scoring opportunities."
Although the Trojans scored the first goal of the match
early in the first quarter, the Cardinal quickly rebounded
with a goal and the Trojans were unable to regain their
lead.
Both teams were within one goal of each other or tied
most the the game, a fact that was not pleasing to Detta
manti. Stanford was unable to convert its first two 6-5 sit
uations into goals in the first quarter due to offensive er
rors. According to Dettamanti, those mistakes set the
tone for the remainder of the game.
"Overall, I was not very pleased with our offense. I
believe we are three to four goals better than USC, but
our scoring didn't show it today," Dettamanti said. "USC
was really pulling some razzle-dazzle plays, and our
defense is what really pulled us through this one, espe
cially our man-on-man defense and the play of goalie
Steve Moyer."

Moyer, a senior, made several important saves in the
final quarter, including one that decided the match's
outcome. Moyer blocked an open shot by USCs Dickie
Riley with 37 seconds remaining in the match, allowing
the Cardinal to win the game. Although these saves were
important, Moyer did not feel his overall play was up to
par.
"I feel I should have made the good saves at the begin
ning of the game instead of having to make them at the
end, but I made one save enough, and that's what really
matters," Moyer said. "I'm glad I was able to hold up un
der pressure at the end of the game, but I wish it hadn't
come down to that."
Another player who came through under pressure at
the end of the game was freshman Erich Fisher, who
scored the last two goals of the game for Stanford. Ac
cording to Dettamanti, Fisher's play Saturday was typical
of his play all season.
"When a freshman can come through in a game like this
and score on the shots he did, it certainly shows great
presence of mind," Dettamanti said. "Erich has adjusted

to the pressures of college water polo more quickly than
any player I have ever coached."
Fisher was pleased with his play but did not feel that his
play was any more spectacular than that of his teammates.
"The real core of our strength today was the fantastic
play of Moyer and Imbernino," Fisher said. "In the final
quarter, the opportunities to score were there and I was
able to convert them when we needed them."
The Trojans were led by Charlie Harris' three goals and
two apiece by Mike Howell and Dickie Riley. Stanford s
defense stopped the strong scoring of senior Mike Spicer,
an effort that payed off for the Cardinal.
"Going into this game, we knew we had to stop Spicer
and we did," Dettamanti said. "Even though we didn't look
super throughout the game, we were able to pull through
in the end. I told the team after the game that we look
pretty sloppy sometimes and we make a lot of mistakes,
but we always pull togther when it's on the line â€” and we
win, that's what we are out there to do."
The Cardinal will play again Friday when it hosts Cal at
3 p.m. in DeGuerre Pool.
