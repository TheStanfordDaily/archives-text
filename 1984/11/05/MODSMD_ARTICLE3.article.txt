# Campus group accuses STAR of violations
## 
### FRANK LESTER Staff writer 
Amid last-minute hustling by student poli
tical groups to get the vote out, Stanford's Re
publican student organization has accused a
student group of violating University regula
tions against partisan political activity on
campus and has asked the University to ter
minate the group's status as a voluntary stu
dent organization.
Steve Dauber and Jason Matherly, leaders
of College Republicans, charged Students
against Reaganism (STAR) with violating the
"Guidelines for Political Activity on the Stan
ford Campus," a formal statement by former
University President Richard Lyman con
cerning the limitations on the kinds of politi
cal activities allowed on campus.

STAR officials denied any illegal or inap
propriate action, calling the charges
"baseless."
Specifically, Dauber and Matherly accused
STAR of using a telephone in an Old
Firehouse office for partisan solicitation.
They additionally charged that the Students
Against Reaganism Political Action Commit
tee (STAR-PAC) used the Law School
lounge for a fund-raising party Oct. 18.
In a letter sent to University President
Donald Kennedy and Registrar Sally
Mahoney, among other officials, Dauber and
Matherly asked that STAR's status be ter
minated because the activities threaten Stan
ford's tax-exempt status.
Both Republican leaders emphasized the
importance of the role of trust in student poli

tical activity. "There is so much trust implied
in these rules," Dauber said. "Two or three
people working for Student Organization
Services can't keep up with every single or
ganization on campus.
"It's time somebody said, 'Look, we're not
going to stand for these rules being violated.
They should be obeyed. If you're going to vio
late them, you're going to have to suffer the
consequences.' "
Matherly added, "It's a great responsibility
for a partisan student organization to operate
on campus during an election, and they
proved themselves irresponsible. Their status
should be terminated — period."
Dauber said a student organization that
breaks the rules will continue breaking them
if it isn't caught, citing the example of STAR's

alleged' dissemination of pamphlets recom
mending candidates and giving the Old
Firehouse number to call for further informa
tion. "They did it even after they knew about
the letter," Dauber said.
University officials are still investigating the
facts of the Republicans' charge. Mahoney,
who is accountable for interpreting the par
tisan guidelines, said, "Our first task is to
resolve whether the activities are as they have
been described. Until we have all the facts, we
have no basis for judging the particulars."
STAR and STAR-PAC representatives
denied all the charges made against them in
the letter and said that many of the charges
arise from the Republicans' ignorance about
the functions of the two organizations. The
letter implies that the two organizations are

connected, according to Steve Silverman, a
co-chairman of STAR-PAC. when it calls
STAR-PAC a "political fund-raising arm" of
STAR.
But according to both Silverman and Brad
Barham. STAR volunteer coordinator, there
is no connection between the two groups.
STAR-PAC is an off-campus fund-raising or
ganization with an on-campus educational
and informational branch called STAR, Sil
verman said.
'"We've had a split operation," he said, re
ferring to the Office of Student Activities' re
quest that STAR and STAR-PAC divide
their organization into two branches. This oc-
curred last spring, according to Sil
verman, when STAR first applied to
the ASSU for voluntary student or
ganization status.
STAR Coalition, on the other
hand, is the organization currently ac
tive on campus in promoting the anti-
Reaganism agenda, Silverman said. It
is also the organization that is using
the Old Firehouse phone. Silverman
STAR Coalition has not made
clear the distinction between "the
normal STAR" and itself.
"We could go in and blow the
whistle on STAR Coalition and sav,

' Don't use the name STAR without
the name Coalition added to it —
you're confusing people.' But the
practical tact is, we don't care. Every
thing they do, we agree with. Why
give them a hard time?"
STAR Coalition. Barham said,
started this fall with "all new funds
and all new people" and is a "quite
distinct operation" from STAR-PAC
and STAR Thus, "STAR Coalition
has not procured ASSU funds at all,"
he said. "All the money we've had
has been raised with T-shirt and but
ton sales."
Silverman said the accusation that
STAR-PAC used University facilities
to raise funds is false. He said the
Oct. 18 party in question was simply a
chance for members to express their

preference for which campaigns they
wanted to donate to, not to collect
money from the members. "We're
not doing anything behind the Uni
versity's back u doesn't know about."
"Steve Dauber and his cohorts
remind me of self-appointed
Keystone Cops. The Republicans
have no productive programs of their
own to run, apparently. They seem to
derive most of their activism from
protesting against what the liberals
are doing. Every single charge
Dauber has is baseless. It seems to be
about the only thing the College
Republicans are capable of doing,"
Silverman said.
While denying that the phone at
the Old Firehouse has been used for
political solicitation, Barham ad

mitted it has been used as a "resource
for people who want to plug in to
STAR Coalition."
"If that's in violation of the
guidelines, then Dauber's right," he
said. "But it should be very clear that
we have not been using the phone for
advocating paitisan positions."
Silverman said the problem lies in
the vagueness of the guidelines.
"Inquiries like the Republicans' ex
emplify this," he said. "Their rules
don't really make sense, and as a
result, we follow them, but it gets so
hard because they're so illogical.
There might be little technical foul
ups here and there, which reflect
more the University's inherent prob
lems in regulating this stuff than any
thing else."
