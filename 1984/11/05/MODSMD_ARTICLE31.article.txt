STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP)
— Top-seeded John McEnroe
faced at least a 21-day suspension
after being fined $2,100 for three
counts of misbehavior yesterday in
a stormy 1-6, 7-6, 6-2 semifinal
victory over Anders Jarryd of
Sweden in the Stockholm Open-
Scandinavian Tennis Champion
ships.
McEnroe's outbursts in the
second set — slamming a ball into
the stands, calling the Swedish
umpire a "jerk" and hitting a soft
drink can with his racket during a
change-over — pushed his fines
this year past the $7,500 limit.
Ken Farrar, the Grand Prix
chief of supervisors, said
McEnroe's fines had totaled
$6,400 going into this tournament.
McEnroe now has two options,
to play no tennis at all for 21 days
or no Grand Prix tennis for 42
days, which would allow him to
play exhibitions and the Davis
Cup.
The Davis Cup final between
Sweden and the United States is
scheduled for Dec. 16-18 at
Goteborg.
Farrar said McEnroe would be
fined $350 for ball abuse, $750 for
abuse of official and $1,000 for
"unsportsmanlike conduct."
McEnroe will play Mats

Wilander of Sweden in the final of
this $315,000 event Monday.
Wilander, the No. 3 seed, defeated
No. 2 seed Jimmy Connors 6-7, 6-
3, 6 3 in the other semifinal.
Wilander, who never has lost to
Connors, outlasted the American
veteran in a 2-hour, 37-minute
duel in reaching the final for the
third straight time.
Wilander, the defending cham
pion, and Connors played a tie
breaker for the third time in two
matches and six sets.
Connors won this one 7-5. But
Wilander took control midway
through the second set.
Winner of a record 105 Grand
Prix titles, Connors has failed six
times to win this event, the world's
oldest Grand Prix indoor tourna
ment and the only official indoor
championship recognized by the
International Tennis Federation.
Wilander, ranked fourth in the
world behind McEnroe, Connors
and Ivan Lendl of Czechoslovakia,
has worked on his first serves in
recent months and they were a
major weapon yesterday.
He slammed a half-dozen aces
past Connors, who has an excel
lent service return although he
quite did not show it yesterday,
and picked up at least twice as
many winners off his first delivery.
