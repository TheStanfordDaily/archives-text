# Men's team begins play in Southwestern Invitational
## Women's golf team wins one at home 
### ROB GRAHAM Staff sportswriter 
Spurred by Kathleen McCarthy's show-stealing ex
ploits, the Stanford women's golf team swept to the team
championship in the Stanford Women's Intercollegiate
Tournament held here yesterday at the par-73, 5,903-
yard Stanford Golf Course.
The women rebounded from two earlier fourth-place
finishes — at the Nancy Lopez Invitational in Tulsa,
Okla., and the Western Intercollegiate in Sacramento —
to post their first tournament victory of the young season
in the three-day, 54-hole event.
The Cardinal, which led from wire-to-wire, stretched its
seven-stroke, first-day lead to a ten-stroke margin of vic
tory over runner-up San Jose State University. Arizona
State University wound up in third-place overall, 28
strokes behind Stanford.
The University of Tulsa, last year's winner and a team
that was expected to challenge for the championship,
ended in fifth, a distant 29 shots off the pace.
Stanford Coach Tim Baldwin was understandably ec
static after the performance. "It was a terrific win for us,"
he said. In describing a lineup that includes two freshmen,
two sophomores and a junior, Baldwin said his "young,
inexperienced team . . . played like veterans."
Before this weekend's victory, Baldwin had expressed
concern that his lineup was ill-defined and unstable. But
the team's performance convinced him that "we could
play extremely well with any of our 10 girls." That, he
said, was a tribute to the Cardinal's depth.
Stanford's convincing victory was important beyond its
immediate meaning. Earlier, Baldwin said the"the
strongest field of any intercollegiate event of the year"
would be on hand at the Stanford tournament and that
event was developing into "the year's number one tourna
ment aside from the NCAA (National Collegiate Athletic
Association) finale held at the end of the year."
Twenty-one teams from all over the country competed
at the invitational. Perennial powerhouses San Jose, ASU,
the United States International University and pre-season
favorite Tulsa presented the Cardinal with a formidable
challenge.
The team's "veteran," junior Kathy Kostas echoed
Baldwin's critique, "It's such an honor to win over such a
distinguished field."
McCarthy sensed that the victory was a portent. "It

goes to show that Stanford is on the way up. This was just
a hint of what we have in mind."
That's not to say that the Cardinal has not known suc
cess before — Stanford did enter last year's NCAA tourn
ament ranked fifth nationally. The women's high expecta
tions just illustrate that their sights are set higher this year
than ever before.
Balwin said it best. "We did this against the national
elite." He and his players beleive that the triumph could
send a signal to the collegiate golfing community, a signal
to beware of Stanford golf.
It was hardly a one-woman show, but McCarthy did her
best to steal all the thunder. The sophomore from Fresno
ran away and hid from the rest of the field to capture the
individual crown with a victory margin of 10 strokes over
her nearest challenger, Dana Lofland of San Jose State. In
the process, she defended the title she won here a year
ago. Moreover, her torrid eight-under-par 211 shattered
the tournament record she established last year.
Afterward, McCarthy recounted her final round.
"After the double-bogey on the third hole, I had to go to
work. Today, I was able to overcome my bad shots." The
championship was especially sweet for her because just
last week she lost a lead over the final 18 holes in the
Western Intercollegiate and finished a disappointing
third.
Baldwin, again, offered overflowing praise. "Her per
formance was unbelieVable. Eight under par on a true
championship course speaks for itself."
Without consistent play from the other members of the
team, though, McCarthy's stand-out play might have been
squandered. Kathy Kostas, the individual champ two
week's ago at the Lopez Invitational, fired a three-day
total of 231, 12 over par.
On the men's side, the Cardinal travels to Thousand
Oaks today for the two-day, 54-hole Southwestern Invita
tional at the North Ranch Country Club. That tourna
ment, hosted by the University of Southern California,
will mark the end of Stanford's fall season. The fall season
was highlighted by the Cardinal's victory last month in the
Stanford Fall Intercollegiate Tournament.
Cardinal Coach Tim Schaaf expects to encounter much
of the same field in Thousand Oaks as he faced here at the
Stanford event and that means a tough test. In any case,
the team will have a long time to ponder its performance
because its next outing is not until after the winter hiatus.

Afterward, McCarthy recounted her final round.
"After the double-bogey on the third hole, I had to go to
work. Today, I was able to overcome my bad shots." The
championship was especially sweet for her because just
last week she lost a lead over the final 18 holes in the
Western Intercollegiate and finished a disappointing
third.
Baldwin, again, offered overflowing praise. "Her per
formance was unbelieVable. Eight under par on a true
championship course speaks for itself."
Without consistent play from the other members of the
team, though, McCarthy's stand-out play might have been
squandered. Kathy Kostas, the individual champ two
week's ago at the Lopez Invitational, fired a three-day
total of 231, 12 over par.
On the men's side, the Cardinal travels to Thousand
Oaks today for the two-day, 54-hole Southwestern Invita
tional at the North Ranch Country Club. That tourna
ment, hosted by the University of Southern California,
will mark the end of Stanford's fall season. The fall season
was highlighted by the Cardinal's victory last month in the
Stanford Fall Intercollegiate Tournament.
Cardinal Coach Tim Schaaf expects to encounter much
of the same field in Thousand Oaks as he faced here at the
Stanford event and that means a tough test. In any case,
the team will have a long time to ponder its performance
because its next outing is not until after the winter hiatus.

Sophomore Kathleen McCarthy broke her own Stanford course record, won the individual championship
and led the Cardinal to victory in the Stanford Women's Intercollegiate over the weekend.
Spurred by Kathleen McCarthy's show-stealing ex
ploits, the Stanford women's golf team swept to the team
championship in the Stanford Women's Intercollegiate
Tournament held here yesterday at the par-73, 5,903-
yard Stanford Golf Course.
The women rebounded from two earlier fourth-place
finishes — at the Nancy Lopez Invitational in Tulsa,
Okla., and the Western Intercollegiate in Sacramento —
to post their first tournament victory of the young season
in the three-day, 54-hole event.
The Cardinal, which led from wire-to-wire, stretched its
seven-stroke, first-day lead to a ten-stroke margin of vic
tory over runner-up San Jose State University. Arizona
State University wound up in third-place overall, 28
strokes behind Stanford.
The University of Tulsa, last year's winner and a team
that was expected to challenge for the championship,
ended in fifth, a distant 29 shots off the pace.
Stanford Coach Tim Baldwin was understandably ec
static after the performance. "It was a terrific win for us,"
he said. In describing a lineup that includes two freshmen,
two sophomores and a junior, Baldwin said his "young,
inexperienced team . . . played like veterans."
Before this weekend's victory, Baldwin had expressed
concern that his lineup was ill-defined and unstable. But
the team's performance convinced him that "we could
play extremely well with any of our 10 girls." That, he
said, was a tribute to the Cardinal's depth.
Stanford's convincing victory was important beyond its
immediate meaning. Earlier, Baldwin said the"the
strongest field of any intercollegiate event of the year"
would be on hand at the Stanford tournament and that
event was developing into "the year's number one tourna
ment aside from the NCAA (National Collegiate Athletic
Association) finale held at the end of the year."
Twenty-one teams from all over the country competed
at the invitational. Perennial powerhouses San Jose, ASU,
the United States International University and pre-season
favorite Tulsa presented the Cardinal with a formidable
challenge.
The team's "veteran," junior Kathy Kostas echoed
Baldwin's critique, "It's such an honor to win over such a
distinguished field."
McCarthy sensed that the victory was a portent. "It

goes to show that Stanford is on the way up. This was just
a hint of what we have in mind."
That's not to say that the Cardinal has not known suc
cess before — Stanford did enter last year's NCAA tourn
ament ranked fifth nationally. The women's high expecta
tions just illustrate that their sights are set higher this year
than ever before.
Balwin said it best. "We did this against the national
elite." He and his players beleive that the triumph could
send a signal to the collegiate golfing community, a signal
to beware of Stanford golf.
It was hardly a one-woman show, but McCarthy did her
best to steal all the thunder. The sophomore from Fresno
ran away and hid from the rest of the field to capture the
individual crown with a victory margin of 10 strokes over
her nearest challenger, Dana Lofland of San Jose State. In
the process, she defended the title she won here a year
ago. Moreover, her torrid eight-under-par 211 shattered
the tournament record she established last year.
Afterward, McCarthy recounted her final round.
"After the double-bogey on the third hole, I had to go to
work. Today, I was able to overcome my bad shots." The
