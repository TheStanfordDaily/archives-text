# Ride describes space voyages

### MARK BEYREIS Staff writer 
Astronaut Sally Ride, a 1973
graduate of Stanford who last year
became the first American woman in
space, discussed her space shuttle ex
periences in a speech at Dinkelspiel
Auditorium Friday afternoon.
"You get this realizaton that
there's absolutely nothing you can
do," Ride said of her feelings at
launch time.
Although she had prepared in a
launch simulator that "simulates it
pretty well," Ride said there is an
emotional and psychological differ
ence when there are seven million
tons of thrust beneath you.
You feel "completely out of con
trol of your own fate," she said.
Eight minutes after liftoff, the
shuttle reached orbit. Once in orbit,
the crew spent eight days conducting
tests. A satellite designed to measure
radiation on the earth was put into
orbit.
The mission also included tests on
air pollution and the feasibility of a
proposed orbital refueling system.
The refueling system is designed to
lengthen the lives of satellites that
have run out of fuel. In testing the
system, two members of the crew
went on a space walk in order to con
nect two fuel hoses.
Ride said that during their free
time in the morning and before going
'he crew members would "go

look out the windows."
"Weightlessness is great," Ride
said. At first your body is confused
but after a day or so you figure it out,
and physiologically you really don t
feel any different, she said.
Ride said it was much more diffi
cult adapting to gravity when she
returned to earth. "The reason that
they don't open the hatch early and
let the crew out is because the crew
literally could not walk down the
stairs," Ride said.
Ride described the food on board
as "civilized." She said the biggest
problem with food was dealing with
the crumbs left floating around after
the crew members ate a loaf of bread.
Ride is currently scheduled to do
about two months of public relations
work. She then plans to "get back in
line for another shuttle flight."
Ride said scientists fly once a year
since they usually require about eight
or nine months of preparation for
each mission.
Ride double majored at Stanford,
receiving bachelor's degrees in both
English and physics in 1973. Ride
received her master's in 1975 and her
doctorate in 1978. Both graduate
degrees were in physics and both
were received from Stanford.
Ride's speech was sponsored by the
Stanford Alumni Association and the
Bay Area Professional Women's
Club.

dents, faculty and staff who crowded into Dinkelspiel to hear about
her experiences in space.
