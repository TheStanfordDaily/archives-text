# Res Ed meets with co-ops

### AMY BIRD Staff writer 
Co-op members and representatives from Residential
Education met Friday afternoon to discuss student
housing needs with regard to the cooperative residences.
Last month, Res Ed reported that it was considering
converting one of the Universities six co-op houses to a
different form of housing.
Diana Conklin, associate dean of Res Ed and director
of the Row, said there has been concern for several years
about the co-ops not filling in the first and second rounds
of the Draw. Res Ed is reviewing the cooperative housing
program to determine what changes, if any, might be
made to the program to accommodate overall student
housing needs.
Conklin said Res Ed recognizes the value of co-ops and
understands that many people support the student-run
houses.
The Friday meeting — the first between the co-op
council and Res Ed — was mainly informational and or
ganizational. The council and Res Ed agreed that they
needed to gather more information before planning a
course of action. They decided to circulate a questionnaire
to determine the general image of co-ops on campus. Co
op memebers also invited evaluations of their individual
houses by Res Ed.
Conklin requested from each house a written statement
detailing its concerns about student housing and the
cooperative program. . A ,
Conklin said she and Rodger Whitney, assoc.ate dean
of Res Ed and director of the Housing Center, hope to

propose a course of action before January, when the
1985-86 Draw Book goes to press.
The proposal will pass through the Res Ed policy staff
and the Committee on Student Services-Residences
before it is given to Dean of Res Ed Norm Robinson.
"It's mainly a problem of numbers," Conklin said. Sta
tistics for the past five years show that some of the co-ops
have not filled their allotted spaces during the first and
second rounds of the Draw. This has been the case even
when 44 of the approximately 250 spaces have been des
ignated for graduate students.
If there is sufficient student interest to support the cur
rent cooperative housing program, these draw statistics do
not seem to give evidence of it, Conklin said.
Mark Segal, a graduate student in statistics who has
lived at Synergy, said the number of vacancies in the co
ops after round one and two of the Draw cannot ac
curately gauge the popularity of the co-ops among stu
dents.
Segal cited the opening of Governor's Corner last year
as a possible cause of additional vacancies in the co-ops
and other residences. He cautioned against examining the
co-ops in isolation.
Whitney said that owing to the limited number of
spaces on campus, there is always a demand for housing
after the Draw. He charged all residences with a "certain
responsibility" to attract people from the unassigned pool
and said the co-ops did not seem to do this.
Whitney added that in co-ops and in all theme houses,
