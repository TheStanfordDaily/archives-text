Nicaragua holds orderly elections
MANAGUA, Nicaragua — The ruling Sandinistas confidently
awaited victory yesterday as large numbers of Nicaraguans voted in their
first election in 10 years despite a boycott by the government's main po
litical opposition.
Even before polls closed, supporters of the leftist Sandinistas set off
fiiecrackers to celebrate their expected victory. The fireworks could be
heard throughout Managua.
Lines formed at polling places throughout the country before the polls
opened at 7 a.m. Many waiting to vote wore T-shirts, hats and other
items of clothing emblazoned with the red-and-black insignia of the San
dinista National Liberation Front.
Mariano Fiallos, the president of the Supreme Electoral Council, said
preliminary returns indicated a turnout higher than the 80 percent
forecast by the government.
Eleven of Nicaragua's almost 4,000 polling places % all in the north
ern part of the country 7 /s were disrupted by violence, and one
policeman was killed, he said.
"lip to now we only have to be sorry for the death of one policeman,"
he said without elaborating.
The Sandinista government had announced that early returns would
be announced last night. But later it said no results would be reported
until today. It did not give a reason for the delay.
Most of the 3,856 polling places, one for about every 400 eligible
voters, closed at 6 p.m., as scheduled. But some polls, in more remote
areas, were kept open beyond the scheduled close to accommodate
everyone who wanted to vote, officials said.
Reagan campaigns in Fritz country
ROCHESTER, Minn. — President Reagan, attempting to nail down a
50-state victory in tomorrow's election, yesterday paid a surprise last
minute visit to Democratic presidential candidate Walter Mondale's
home state, where Reagan held his first news conference since July 24.
Although he clearly wanted to talk about his prospective landslide re
election victory, Reagan bowed to reporters' desire to discuss Latin
America, taxes and one of his own gaffes.
Reagan acknowledged for the first time that he had made a mistake on
Aug. 1 1 when he jokingly said during a sound test, "My fellow
Americans, 1 am pleased to tell you I just signed legislation which out
laws Russia forever. We begin bombing in five minutes." But he said the
press also was to blame for reporting the offhand remark.
Reogan also stopped short of ruling out a tax increase but said he
would attempt to seek new revenues by broadening the tax base rather
'ban boosting lates.
He also said he would continue to seek U.S. aid for the CIA-backed
guerrillas opposing the Sandinista government in Nicaragua as long as
the Sandinistas assist leftist guerrillas opposing the government in El
Salvador.
Reagan's strategists added Mondale's home state to the campaign
itinerary yesterday morning after a late-night meeting where they ex
amined surveys showing Reagan trailing by only 2 percentage points in
Minnesota, and ahead in eveiy other state.
"We just came from Milwaukee, and being that close, 1 just couldn't
flv by Minnesota, particularly when 1 know our opponents are spending
so much time in California," Reagan said in a statement opening the 25-
minute news conference. "Everyone knows that we've never written off
iny state nor taken any state for granted."
Peagan stopped here en route to rallies in St. Louis and suburban
Chicago that climaxed three days of grueling campaigning in the Mid
west.
He then was scheduled to fly home to California, where he is to con
dude his campaign today with three stops, including a rally at the state
Oipifol where he governed For eight years.
He also plans a paid nationally televised broadcast on all three net
works tonight.
Mondale pledges to appoint Latino
MCALLEN, Texas — Democratic presidential candidate Walter
Mondale, making a 1 lth-hour appeal yesterday for a big minority voter
turnout, claimed the legacy of Martin Luther King and pledged to ap
point a Latino to the cabinet if he is elected tomorrow.
Mondale, who spoke to a Latino rally here in the Rio Grande Valley,
preached from the pulpit of a black church in Memphis, Tenn. and filled
a high school stadium in Corpus Christi, Texas. He pleaded with his
black and Latino supporters not to be discouraged by reports that Presi
dent Reagan has the election locked up.
' Let's stand up and make certain that everybody votes," he told wor
shipers at the Monumental Baptist Church. "Don't let them stay back;
don't let them despair; don't let them give up. We need everybody!"
Although minority voters are believed to have registered in record
numbers this year, Mondale's strategists fear many of these new voters
who support the Democratic nominee will not show up at the polls on
Election Day.
In Texas, Mondale was introduced to the crowd by his son, William,
22, who spoke Spanish. Singer Jose Feliciano also performed for the two
Texas rallies, singing a controversial jazz version of "The Star Spangled
Banner" as well as "Paso La Vida Pensando."
"For too many years Hispanic-Americans have been over
represented when the medals of honor have been handed out," Mondale
said. "For too many years, you've given more of your share of lives to
the defense of vour country and you've had no share in influencing the
tuture of our nation. I'm going to change that."
"In 200 years, there has never been any Hispanic on the Cabinet of
the United States. I'm going to change that in my government."
Sikhs march in California
YUBA CITY — Thousands of Sikhs, some carrying banners and un
sheathed swords, marched peacefully yesterday in a mile-long proces
sion. chanting for the creation of a separate Sikh state.
The fifth annual religious parade, occurring only days after the assas
sination of Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by two Sikh security
guards, wended through this Northern California agricultural town,
which has a large Sikh community, without incident.
Bearded men in turbans and women in colorful, flowing gowns walked
the parade route, many of them singing, clapping and shouting "God is
peace. . . . God is forever."
The Sutter County sheriffs office estimated the crowd at 5,000 to
7,000.
Police were worried that the assassination might spark violence at the
parade and security was tight. The parade route was flanked by more
than 100 law enforcement officers, including a Highway Patrol helicop
ter overhead and police dogs in front.
Sheriffs Capt. Jerry Harrison said several weapons were seized "as a
precautionary measure," but he declined to say what weapons were
taken or under what circumstances they were seized. No arrests were
made "and no crimes have been committed," he said.
Soviets foresee Reagan victory
MOSCOW — Soviet newspapers yesterday foresaw re-election for
President Reagan and said the influence of big corporations makes
Americans vote in "elections without choice."
Several Soviet citizens interviewed at random yesterday on the streets
of Moscow reflected the Communist Party line. They said Reagan will
probably be re-elected but they would prefer the Democratic nominee,
former Vice President Walter Mondale, because they see Reagan's
foreign policy as a threat to peace. Under the headline "Elections
Without Choice," the newspaper Sovietskaya Rossiya reviewed what it
said were the budget policies of both candidates and concluded that mili
tary spending would probably not drop significantly under Mondale.
"Is the difference great between the political opponents?" the news
paper asked rhetorically.
Komsomolskaya Pravda, newspaper of the Soviet Young Communist
League, said "America Incorporated" chooses the president because it
"votes with dollars."
Today's weather
Today will be increasingly cloudy with possible rain tonight. The highs
will in the high 60s to low 70s.

Aug. 1 1 when he jokingly said during a sound test, "My fellow
Americans, 1 am pleased to tell you I just signed legislation which out
laws Russia forever. We begin bombing in five minutes." But he said the
press also was to blame for reporting the offhand remark.
Reogan also stopped short of ruling out a tax increase but said he
would attempt to seek new revenues by broadening the tax base rather
'ban boosting lates.
He also said he would continue to seek U.S. aid for the CIA-backed
guerrillas opposing the Sandinista government in Nicaragua as long as
the Sandinistas assist leftist guerrillas opposing the government in El
Salvador.
Reagan's strategists added Mondale's home state to the campaign
itinerary yesterday morning after a late-night meeting where they ex
amined surveys showing Reagan trailing by only 2 percentage points in
Minnesota, and ahead in eveiy other state.
"We just came from Milwaukee, and being that close, 1 just couldn't
flv by Minnesota, particularly when 1 know our opponents are spending
so much time in California," Reagan said in a statement opening the 25-
minute news conference. "Everyone knows that we've never written off
iny state nor taken any state for granted."
Peagan stopped here en route to rallies in St. Louis and suburban
Chicago that climaxed three days of grueling campaigning in the Mid
west.
He then was scheduled to fly home to California, where he is to con
dude his campaign today with three stops, including a rally at the state
Oipifol where he governed For eight years.
He also plans a paid nationally televised broadcast on all three net

Mondale pledges to appoint Latino
MCALLEN, Texas — Democratic presidential candidate Walter
Mondale, making a 1 lth-hour appeal yesterday for a big minority voter
turnout, claimed the legacy of Martin Luther King and pledged to ap
point a Latino to the cabinet if he is elected tomorrow.
Mondale, who spoke to a Latino rally here in the Rio Grande Valley,
preached from the pulpit of a black church in Memphis, Tenn. and filled
a high school stadium in Corpus Christi, Texas. He pleaded with his
black and Latino supporters not to be discouraged by reports that Presi
dent Reagan has the election locked up.
' Let's stand up and make certain that everybody votes," he told wor
shipers at the Monumental Baptist Church. "Don't let them stay back;
don't let them despair; don't let them give up. We need everybody!"
Although minority voters are believed to have registered in record
numbers this year, Mondale's strategists fear many of these new voters
who support the Democratic nominee will not show up at the polls on
Election Day.
In Texas, Mondale was introduced to the crowd by his son, William,
22, who spoke Spanish. Singer Jose Feliciano also performed for the two
Texas rallies, singing a controversial jazz version of "The Star Spangled
Banner" as well as "Paso La Vida Pensando."
"For too many years Hispanic-Americans have been over
represented when the medals of honor have been handed out," Mondale
said. "For too many years, you've given more of your share of lives to
the defense of vour country and you've had no share in influencing the
tuture of our nation. I'm going to change that."
"In 200 years, there has never been any Hispanic on the Cabinet of
the United States. I'm going to change that in my government."
Sikhs march in California
YUBA CITY — Thousands of Sikhs, some carrying banners and un
sheathed swords, marched peacefully yesterday in a mile-long proces
sion. chanting for the creation of a separate Sikh state.
The fifth annual religious parade, occurring only days after the assas
sination of Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by two Sikh security
guards, wended through this Northern California agricultural town,
which has a large Sikh community, without incident.
Bearded men in turbans and women in colorful, flowing gowns walked
the parade route, many of them singing, clapping and shouting "God is
peace. . . . God is forever."
The Sutter County sheriffs office estimated the crowd at 5,000 to
7,000.
Police were worried that the assassination might spark violence at the
parade and security was tight. The parade route was flanked by more
than 100 law enforcement officers, including a Highway Patrol helicop
ter overhead and police dogs in front.
Sheriffs Capt. Jerry Harrison said several weapons were seized "as a
precautionary measure," but he declined to say what weapons were
taken or under what circumstances they were seized. No arrests were
made "and no crimes have been committed," he said.
Soviets foresee Reagan victory
MOSCOW — Soviet newspapers yesterday foresaw re-election for
President Reagan and said the influence of big corporations makes
Americans vote in "elections without choice."
Several Soviet citizens interviewed at random yesterday on the streets
of Moscow reflected the Communist Party line. They said Reagan will
probably be re-elected but they would prefer the Democratic nominee,
former Vice President Walter Mondale, because they see Reagan's
foreign policy as a threat to peace. Under the headline "Elections
Without Choice," the newspaper Sovietskaya Rossiya reviewed what it
said were the budget policies of both candidates and concluded that mili
tary spending would probably not drop significantly under Mondale.
"Is the difference great between the political opponents?" the news
paper asked rhetorically.
Komsomolskaya Pravda, newspaper of the Soviet Young Communist
League, said "America Incorporated" chooses the president because it
"votes with dollars."
