# Big voter turnout expected
## 
### 
After a 24-year decline in voter
participation, all indications are that a
higher percentage of people will cast
ballots tomorrow than did so in 1980,
and women and blacks probably will
vote more than ever before.
The predictions could be thwarted
by the widespread perception of a
landslide for President Reagan, which
may keep voters from the polls. But
increased registration figures and
public opinion polls imply that nearly
100 million Americans will vote for
president, perhaps 56 percent or 57
percent of the voting age population,
up from 52.6 percent four years ago.
In any event, the kinds of people
who vote are not expected to be much
different from the kinds who cast bal
lots in the last presidential race.
"The typical voter in '84 is going to
be pretty much similar to the typical
voter in 1980," concludes Martin
O'Connell of the U.S. Census
Bureau, who analyzed the data from
the bureau's voting and registration,
surveys.
"White people vote more than
black people," he said. "Females vote
at about the same rate as males.
People who are in their 40s and 50s
vote much more than teenagers.
People in the Midwest tend to vote

more than people in other parts of the
country. Homebuyers vote more than
people who rent. People who've lived
longer in an area tend to vote more
than people who are transients to an
area. And people who are in higher
educational and income brackets vote
the most."
Such voting patterns, combined
with a rich interplay of demographic
factors, will help determine whether
Ronald Reagan or Walter Mondale is
elected president.
"Income is as good a yardstick of
who's voting for whom as any other
single factor," Andrew Kohut, presi
dent of the Gallup Organization, the
public-opinion polling company, said.
"This is a race that separates rich and
poor people, with the middle class
falling in between and tipping to
Reagan." Income also is a very
reliable predictor of turnout. In 1980,
39 percent of people earning less than
$5,000 a year voted, while 74 percent
of people earning more than $25,000
voted.
If income is a good indicator of
voter turnout and preference, the
largest unknown may be the effect
that Geraldine Ferraro's presence on
the Democratic ticket will have on
women, whose participation in elec

tions has been steadily increasing
since World War 11.
In 1980, and again in 1982, wo
men's voting rates for the first time
equaled those of men. Because there
are more women in the total popula
tion, there are slightly more women
voters than men voters.
A "gender gap" has persisted
throughout the Reagan administra
tion, polls show. In public opinion
polls, men have consistently ap
proved of Reagan's handling of the
presidency or of his policies about 10
percentage points more than women
have. But the gap has wavered and
shrunk since the Democratic conven
tion.
Most polls tend to show women
about evenly divided between
Reagan and Mondale. "It could be
that women are 50-50, and men will
elect Reagan," said I.A. Lewis, direc
tor of the Los Angeles Times Poll.
But Eleanor Smeal, head of the
National Organization for Women,
said, "Women still have an
'undecided' that's twice the range of
men. I think that is the big question
mark of this race: How will the wo
men finally vote?"
How they will vote is one question,
and how many will vote is another.

"If there's one hidden factor in this
election, it's estimating Ferraro's ef
fect on the turnout of women," said
Michael Traugott of the Institute for
Social Research at the University of
Michigan.
"We could be underestimating the
intensity of some women's attitudes
and feelings about her candidacy," he
said.
Smeal, a staunch Mondale sup
porter, noted that Ferraro has drawn
crowds in the tens of thousands.
"Women are genuinely excited about
her on the ticket," Smeal said. "She is
viewed as a woman who's for women.
They like what she's saying."
But Raymond Wolfinger, a politi
cal scientist at the University of Cali
fornia, Berkeley, and co-author of
"Who Votes?," a study of voter turn
out, said that he did not think women
would vote overwhelmingly for
Mondale-Ferraro.
"When you have a symbolic
[figure] running, do you get more of
the group voting?" Wolfinger asked.
"Yes," he answered.
"Do they all vote for the symbolic
figure? No," he said.
