# Campaigns end with TV blitz
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The presidential video cam
paign that America sees nightly is finishing with a
burst of television pitches that frame the choice as a
struggle between Feel Good and Feel, Guilt.
President Reagan's campaign is ending as it
began, with a recycling of his opening "feel-good"
commercials and rally themes that remind people
of what the polls say they already believe — that
"America is back."
Democratic challenger Walter Mondale's cam
paign is ending far differently than it began — with
strong ads and appeals aimed at evoking guilt in the
many Democrats who now say they will vote for
Reagan.
But the greatest problem Mondale faces before
tomorrow's election is that his most awesome op
ponent has not been Reagan, but the evening news.
Night after night, viewers have been bombarded
with words and numbers bearing the same message,
that Mondale's cause is hopeless and his candidacy
is doomed.
Last Tuesday, after NBC's Tom Brokaw an
nounced the NBC poll giving Reagan an
"overpowering" 24-point lead, correspondent Lisa
Myers opened her Mondale coverage in Duluth,
Minn., by saying:
"Having finally escaped the shadow** of Hubert
Humphrey and Jimmy Carter, having siffertced cries
of wimp, Mondale came home to ask those who
know him best to save him from further indignity
— from what could be the worst defeat in the his
tory of presidential politics. . . . With polls so bleak

he no longer discusses them, with his situation
deteriorating by the hour, Mondale asked for one
final favor (a victory in his home state)."
And that's the way it was on Thursday, when
ABC News' Brit Hume began his piece on
Mondale's huge Manhattan Garment District rally
by saying, "If the polls are right, Walter Mondale's
about to get blitzed. He might as well have gone
over Niagara Falls in a barrel, but he flew down
from Buffalo to New York City."
CBS anchors and correspondents seemed to be
making special efforts to report what the candi
dates said with a minimum of prognostication and
characterization.
But even their reports of Reagan's hopes for a
50-state sweep amounted to the sort of legitimate
news story that adds to a political groundswell.
On Friday, the other two networks also adopted
reporting stances that put greater emphasis on what
was said that day than on what may happen Elec
tion Day.
Mondale's anti-landslide strategy consists of
trying to implant guilt in many Democrats who are
telling reporters and pollsters that they are better
off now than they were four years ago, that
America is back and that they are voting for
Reagan.
Mondale's five-minute television finale opens
with the narrator saying, "This is a fight about whe
ther America is really back — or can we do bet
ter?"
After a campaign of uneven television commer
cial performances and mixed messages, Mondale

advisers have made a stronger finish, with this five
minute ad and several similar new 30-second spots.
Mondale's five-minute finale features children
looking hopeful, elderly women looking sorrowful
and farmers looking scornful. The sorrow and the
scorn are directed at Reagan programs. The nar
rator's words are directed at straying Democrats.
"Here is the future," the narrator says."And
you — alone in the voting booth with your con
science — will leave them a legacy. Make it one of
economic opportunity for all, of a Supreme Court
free to judge for liberty, of an end to the arms race,
at last. ... Some say you can't win the presidency
on the values of decency, fairness and economic
opportunity — but if one of us can't win on those
values, then none of us can. For those values are
America. Tuesday your vote does matter — for all
of us. Do what's right."
New Mondale ads pitch arms control by showing
children, eyes uplifted in hope and wonder when,
suddenly, missiles blast out of silos and into the sky
as all of this is set to the music of the folk-rock
song, "Teach Your Children."
In another, elderly women, their voices all but
breaking, talk about the hardships and fiscal
realities of being old in the Reagan years.
Reagan has aired his own ad in which a narrator
takes viewers on a tour of a supermarket, noting
how much higher bread, milk and bacon would
have been "if Carter-Mondale's inflation contin
ued."

over Niagara Falls in a barrel, but he flew down
from Buffalo to New York City."
CBS anchors and correspondents seemed to be
making special efforts to report what the candi
dates said with a minimum of prognostication and
characterization.
But even their reports of Reagan's hopes for a
50-state sweep amounted to the sort of legitimate
news story that adds to a political groundswell.
On Friday, the other two networks also adopted
reporting stances that put greater emphasis on what
was said that day than on what may happen Elec
tion Day.
Mondale's anti-landslide strategy consists of
trying to implant guilt in many Democrats who are
telling reporters and pollsters that they are better
off now than they were four years ago, that
America is back and that they are voting for
Reagan.
Mondale's five-minute television finale opens
with the narrator saying, "This is a fight about whe
ther America is really back — or can we do bet
ter?"
After a campaign of uneven television commer
cial performances and mixed messages, Mondale

advisers have made a stronger finish, with this five
minute ad and several similar new 30-second spots.
Mondale's five-minute finale features children
looking hopeful, elderly women looking sorrowful
and farmers looking scornful. The sorrow and the
scorn are directed at Reagan programs. The nar
rator's words are directed at straying Democrats.
"Here is the future," the narrator says."And
you — alone in the voting booth with your con
science — will leave them a legacy. Make it one of
economic opportunity for all, of a Supreme Court
free to judge for liberty, of an end to the arms race,
at last. ... Some say you can't win the presidency
on the values of decency, fairness and economic
opportunity — but if one of us can't win on those
values, then none of us can. For those values are
America. Tuesday your vote does matter — for all
of us. Do what's right."
New Mondale ads pitch arms control by showing
children, eyes uplifted in hope and wonder when,
suddenly, missiles blast out of silos and into the sky
as all of this is set to the music of the folk-rock
song, "Teach Your Children."
In another, elderly women, their voices all but
breaking, talk about the hardships and fiscal
realities of being old in the Reagan years.
Reagan has aired his own ad in which a narrator
takes viewers on a tour of a supermarket, noting
how much higher bread, milk and bacon would
have been "if Carter-Mondale's inflation contin
ued."
