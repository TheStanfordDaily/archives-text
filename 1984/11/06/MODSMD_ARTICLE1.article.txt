### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER Senior staff writer 
Wonderful, spectacular, fascinating.
Those words were heard frequently
outside the Stanford Museum of Art yes
terday as approximately 400 people came
to see the installation of Auguste Rodin's
"The Gates of Hell."
The sculpture — cast in greenish-black
bronze — measures 21 feet high, 12 feet
wide, four feet deep and weighs eight tons.
It is placed against a beige wall made of
large cement bricks.
"The Gates of Hell" consists of approxi
mately 170 figures, according to Albert El
sen, art professor and curator of the Uni
versity's Rodin collection.
"It is one of the greatest works in the his
tory of art," Elsen said.
The art professor noted that Stanford is
the only university in the United States
with both an art museum and a sculpture
garden.
"It will be one of the most beautiful

sculpture gardens in the world," Elsen said.
The Rodin garden is scheduled to be com
pleted by May, 1985. It will include "The
Burghers of Calais," "Walking Man" and
"The Spirit of Eternal Repose."
Discussing the new addition to the art
museum, Elsen said, "It's Rodin's personal
vision of hell." He added, "It's of great
educational and artistic value."
Elsen explained that the statue portrays
Rodin's "condition of mind . . . being
driven by passion."
Law School Prof. John Merryman, chair
man of the Outdoor Arts Panel, said, "It's
a terrific piece. . . . We're very fortunate to
have it."
Merryman noted that "The Gates of
Hell" visited the New York Metropolitan
Museum and the National Gallery in
Washington, D.C. before its trip across the
country.
"It will be the center piece of the
sculpture garden ... an extraordinary con
tribution to the University," he said.

Merryman continued, "It's difficult to
overstate the impact on the people at Stan
ford; it's a way of enriching the environ
ment."
The University already owns several
Rodin pieces that are situated in the
museum's rotunda.
Bob Nerrie, overall project director of
the Rodin of Gallery, said, "I think it (the
Rodin) is a major addition to the campus.
.. . It's the first stage of completing the gar
den."
The second phase will include the addi
tion of lighting, trees, gravel and a reflect
ing pool in front of "The Gates of Hell."
The ultimate phase will depend on fund
raising by the Office of Development. The
sculpture and the other Rodin pieces were
donated to the University by B.G. Canter,
financier and donor of Rodin's work to
many U.S. museums. The new garden will
be called the B.G. Cantor Sculpture Gar
den.
