Today's the day.
For months the front pages of newspapers
across the country have been inundated with
reports from the campaign trail. And the featured
summer colors were not pastels, as might have
been expected, but rather good old red, white and
blue, as balloons and banners descended upon
Democrats in San Francisco and Republicans in
Dallas.
But soon it will all be over. All the rhetoric, the
hooplah and the fuss. And it may be that after
months and months of hearing, seeing and talking
about politics you're just tired of the whole thing.
Or it may be that you are already wondering what
it is you'll talk about at parties now that politics
will cease to occupy the center ring.
But either way, whether you've enjoyed this
election year or not, don't forget the meaning be
hind it all.
We are going to elect a president.
And that means voting.
Nationally, teen-agers and younger voters in
general don't vote as much as middle-age,
higher-income individuals. But if any group
should be able to buck the national trend, it
should be Stanford students. Students here are

educated, informed, inquisitive and exposed to
politics at many levels. We've been given every
chance to form our opinions. We watched the
televised debates, we heard Mondale speak here
and we've heard Carnoy and Zschau debate.
Now its time to put that knowledge to use. Yes,
voting is your civic responsiblity. It is also in your
best interest. National politics do affect you, and
the local races and issues have a more direct im
pact.
Californians have the distinct disadvantage of
voting last, due to the time difference on the East
Coast. That means newscasters will be predicting
the winner of the presidential race before the
polls have even closed here. And that means
many discouraged potential voters will fail to go
to the polls at all, thinking the race has already
been decided. Such an attitude only hurts the
local candidates and issues at stake. Besides, no
race is ever over until all the votes are in.
California has a lot of sway in the electoral col
lege and both candidates have already predicted
victory here. Despite anyone's predictions, the
way California goes is up to us. As is the fate of
the presidency itself.
Exercise your right. Vote. Today.
