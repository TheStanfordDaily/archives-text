## Soliciting nuclear renaissance manhood 
### 
Every National Review, Atlantic Monthly,
New Republic, etc., seems to include an essay
on arms control. With scientists, religious
leaders, professionals and plain old citizens
moving into the arena formerly dominated by
political theorists and politicians, nuclear
strategy has become a convoluted and quickly
changing science. In short, it's hard to keep
up.
The last "renaissance man," who could
write poems, wrestle, keep up on relevant po
litical issues, be a master of philosophy and
have a commanding knowledge of science dis
appeared with the death of Leonardo da
Vinci. The more modest title of "nuclear re
naissance man" describes a dwindling number
of theoreticians, political activists and inter
ested citizens. The plethora of nuke theorists,
congressional committees, the media and the
administration have in their prolific profun
dity made it a full-time undertaking for a man
to seek nuclear renaissance manhood. The
aspiring NRM is faced with a confusing lexi
con of acronyms and Haigisms. As a quick
test, see how many of these entries in the nu
clear dictionary you can identify: ICBM,
SLBM, INF, PDC, launch-on-warning,
throw-weight, MIRV, Midgetman, ALCM,
START, SALT, build-down, GLCM, Black
jack, ABM, PAL, CEP.
And how many of us can assess the

plausibility of nuclear scenarios, such as that
envisioned in the new cold war flick "Red
Dawn"?
More important, how many of us can assess
and criticize statements made by politicians?
An environment of heated debate over com
plex issues fosters a temptation to over
simplify in an attempt to persuade. The Soviet
government, the many "peace groups" and
the administration are all guilty of succumb
ing to this temptation. Oversimplification
leads most directly to what I shall call the "no
missiles, no war" mentality that has found fa
vor with congressional liberals. Unfortun
ately, many invididuals have been taken in,
and a vocal subset of them in the heat of
newly found conviction (and in the absence of
malice) are spreading and perpetuating a false
gospel.
Naturally, the plausible-sounding "no
missiles, no war" mentality has policy impli
cations. Namely, unilateral restraint. They
say, "Look at the size of our defense budget.
We are as guilty as the Soviets of escalating
the arms race. If we would only exercise some
unilateral restraint while pursuing negotia
tions in earnest, the Soviets would do the
same. We're both senselessly busting our
economies to produce weapons of mass
destruction." Specifically, this means oppos
ing the B-l bomber, the Trident submarine

and the MX missile.
The flaws of unilateral restraint become ev
ident upon examination of the shift in the mil
itary balance that has occurred over the last
two decades. In the late 19605, some mem
bers of Congress became alarmed at the ac
celerating pace of Soviet arms buildup and the
erosion of the previously unquestioned nu
clear superiority America enjoyed since
World War 11. They were placated by a reas
suring secretary of defense, Robert Mac-
Namara, who urged a policy of unilateral
restraint. In 1965, he made a prediction he
would probably like to forget: "The Soviets
have decided that they have lost the quan
titative race. .. . There is no indication that
the Soviets are seeking to develop a strategic
nuclear force as large as ours."
He was wrong. The Soviets continued
building missiles at a rate of 200 to 300 per
year even after they achieved parity in 1970.
Even though America had no new ICBM pro
gram in the works, the Soviets deployed a new
series of destabilizing, first-strike ICBMs in
cluding 308 SS-18s (with 10 warheads each)
and 330 SS-19s (with six warheads each).
They developed and deployed an advanced,
supersonic bomber called Backfire even
though the B-l project was bogged down in
congressional turmoil. Even the new Trident
submarine, which was being developed at this

time, was not to be deployed until the early
'80s. In essence, unilateral restraint failed
miserably.
Not only did unilateral restraint fail as a
policy, it also succeeded in torpedoing arms
control efforts. Imagine facing Leonid
Brezhnev across the negotiating table and
trying to convince him to agree to a compre
hensive reduction in nuclear weapons with the
following force configuration: 1,054 ICBMs
compared to 1,400 Soviet ICBMs; 656
SLBMs compared to 923 Soviet SLBMs. Our
only advantage in terms of launchers lay in
the number of strategic bombers: 348
compared to 156 for the Soviets. And what
about programs in progress? During the mid
'7os, the Soviets were developing and deploy
ing a new, longer-range, MIRVed SLBM
(included in above figures); they were deploy
ing the Backfire bomber and looking ahead to
the Blackjack bomber. In America, the fate of
the B-l and MX programs were at best uncer
tain, and hence could not be used as
"bargaining chips."
And what sort of agreement was wrought
from this atmosphere? The answer: SALT 11.
The various "limits" on numbers of launchers
were so high that no dismantling was re
quired. Neither did it demand abandonment
of any projects in progress. Like two dueling

men agreeing to limit their arsenals to 10 ma
chine guns each, SALT II is merely an agree
ment for agreement's sake. An agreement
with little substance is arguably better than no
agreement at all.
In 1979 Congress abjured the SALT II
treaty. As an act of good faith, however,
Presidents Carter and Reagan have abided by
the terms of the agreement and have
restrained their impulses to enlarge our forces
to limits defined by the treaty. But once again,
the Soviets have not reciprocated. Intelli
gence evidence indicates that substantial So
viet violations exist.
The message is loud and clear: Unilateral
restraint is unlikely to evoke Soviet
reciprocity. Let's not repeat the mistakes
we've made in the past. Our only hope for
arms control is to pursue negotiation from a
position of strength, and it will take time to
regain such a position. I don't want Cold War
and I don't want appeasement — we need a
moderate path. But past experience
demonstrates that we must show a willingness
to continue the arms race. We must not let
our desire for arms control be transformed
into an insistence on immediate results.

to limits defined by the treaty. But once again,
the Soviets have not reciprocated. Intelli

The message is loud and clear: Unilateral
restraint is unlikely to evoke Soviet
reciprocity. Let's not repeat the mistakes
we've made in the past. Our only hope for
arms control is to pursue negotiation from a
position of strength, and it will take time to
regain such a position. I don't want Cold War
and I don't want appeasement — we need a
moderate path. But past experience
demonstrates that we must show a willingness
to continue the arms race. We must not let
our desire for arms control be transformed
into an insistence on immediate results.

Every National Review, Atlantic Monthly,
New Republic, etc., seems to include an essay
on arms control. With scientists, religious
leaders, professionals and plain old citizens
moving into the arena formerly dominated by
political theorists and politicians, nuclear
strategy has become a convoluted and quickly
changing science. In short, it's hard to keep
up.
The last "renaissance man," who could
write poems, wrestle, keep up on relevant po
litical issues, be a master of philosophy and
have a commanding knowledge of science dis
appeared with the death of Leonardo da
Vinci. The more modest title of "nuclear re
naissance man" describes a dwindling number
of theoreticians, political activists and inter
ested citizens. The plethora of nuke theorists,
congressional committees, the media and the
administration have in their prolific profun
dity made it a full-time undertaking for a man
to seek nuclear renaissance manhood. The
aspiring NRM is faced with a confusing lexi
con of acronyms and Haigisms. As a quick
test, see how many of these entries in the nu
clear dictionary you can identify: ICBM,
SLBM, INF, PDC, launch-on-warning,
throw-weight, MIRV, Midgetman, ALCM,
START, SALT, build-down, GLCM, Black
jack, ABM, PAL, CEP.
And how many of us can assess the

plausibility of nuclear scenarios, such as that
envisioned in the new cold war flick "Red
Dawn"?
More important, how many of us can assess
and criticize statements made by politicians?
An environment of heated debate over com
plex issues fosters a temptation to over
simplify in an attempt to persuade. The Soviet
government, the many "peace groups" and
the administration are all guilty of succumb
ing to this temptation. Oversimplification
leads most directly to what I shall call the "no
missiles, no war" mentality that has found fa
vor with congressional liberals. Unfortun
ately, many invididuals have been taken in,
and a vocal subset of them in the heat of
newly found conviction (and in the absence of
malice) are spreading and perpetuating a false
gospel.
Naturally, the plausible-sounding "no
missiles, no war" mentality has policy impli
cations. Namely, unilateral restraint. They
say, "Look at the size of our defense budget.
We are as guilty as the Soviets of escalating
the arms race. If we would only exercise some
unilateral restraint while pursuing negotia
tions in earnest, the Soviets would do the
same. We're both senselessly busting our
economies to produce weapons of mass
destruction." Specifically, this means oppos
ing the B-l bomber, the Trident submarine

and the MX missile.
The flaws of unilateral restraint become ev
ident upon examination of the shift in the mil
itary balance that has occurred over the last
two decades. In the late 19605, some mem
bers of Congress became alarmed at the ac
celerating pace of Soviet arms buildup and the
erosion of the previously unquestioned nu
clear superiority America enjoyed since
World War 11. They were placated by a reas
suring secretary of defense, Robert Mac-
Namara, who urged a policy of unilateral
restraint. In 1965, he made a prediction he
would probably like to forget: "The Soviets
have decided that they have lost the quan
titative race. .. . There is no indication that
the Soviets are seeking to develop a strategic
nuclear force as large as ours."
He was wrong. The Soviets continued
building missiles at a rate of 200 to 300 per
year even after they achieved parity in 1970.
Even though America had no new ICBM pro
gram in the works, the Soviets deployed a new
series of destabilizing, first-strike ICBMs in
cluding 308 SS-18s (with 10 warheads each)
and 330 SS-19s (with six warheads each).
They developed and deployed an advanced,
supersonic bomber called Backfire even
though the B-l project was bogged down in
congressional turmoil. Even the new Trident
submarine, which was being developed at this

time, was not to be deployed until the early
'80s. In essence, unilateral restraint failed
miserably.
Not only did unilateral restraint fail as a
policy, it also succeeded in torpedoing arms
control efforts. Imagine facing Leonid
Brezhnev across the negotiating table and
trying to convince him to agree to a compre
hensive reduction in nuclear weapons with the
following force configuration: 1,054 ICBMs
compared to 1,400 Soviet ICBMs; 656
SLBMs compared to 923 Soviet SLBMs. Our
only advantage in terms of launchers lay in
the number of strategic bombers: 348
compared to 156 for the Soviets. And what
about programs in progress? During the mid
'7os, the Soviets were developing and deploy
ing a new, longer-range, MIRVed SLBM
(included in above figures); they were deploy
ing the Backfire bomber and looking ahead to
the Blackjack bomber. In America, the fate of
the B-l and MX programs were at best uncer
tain, and hence could not be used as
"bargaining chips."
And what sort of agreement was wrought
from this atmosphere? The answer: SALT 11.
The various "limits" on numbers of launchers
were so high that no dismantling was re
quired. Neither did it demand abandonment
of any projects in progress. Like two dueling

men agreeing to limit their arsenals to 10 ma
chine guns each, SALT II is merely an agree
ment for agreement's sake. An agreement
with little substance is arguably better than no
agreement at all.
In 1979 Congress abjured the SALT II
treaty. As an act of good faith, however,
Presidents Carter and Reagan have abided by
the terms of the agreement and have
restrained their impulses to enlarge our forces
to limits defined by the treaty. But once again,
the Soviets have not reciprocated. Intelli
gence evidence indicates that substantial So
viet violations exist.
