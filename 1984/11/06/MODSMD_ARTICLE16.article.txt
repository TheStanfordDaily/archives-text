Personal liberty
The Libertarian Party believes that
everyone has absolute freedom to do
what he wishes as long as he does not
infringe on other people's personal
freedoms. Therefore, Libertarians
make no attempt to control other
people's ideas on issues such as
sexual preference, drug use or the
use of one's own money.
However, Libertarians also believe
that everyone has the right to be
properly informed. The recent article
"Libertarian candidate pummels
tax" (The Daily, Nov. 1) gives an
incomplete and often misleading

view of the Libertarian Party plat
form. It fails to explain the Liberta
rian definition of national defense,
which is to defend the United States
and to end its policing of other na
tions. It also fails to state that the
Libertarian Party is the only party
that specifically calls for both a re
duction of nuclear arms and an end
to conscription in its platform. The
article never offers any definition of
what David Bergland, the Liberta
rian candidate for president, means
by "personal liberty," which is the
cornerstone of Libertarian philoso
phy.
The Daily appears to have written

this article without having a firm
grasp of Libertarian beliefs. Given
the mental set of American politics
over the past 50 years or so, their'
mistakes are entirely understandable.

The choice is clear
There is a clear choice between
Martin Carnoy and Ed Zschau in the
local congressional race. Both are in
favor of high-tech industry and other
local concerns, but they differ signifi

cantly on larger issues.
In reply to a letter of mine about
legislation which would cease to
make availability of U.S. economic
aid dependent upon acceptance of
military aid, Zschau would not di
rectly reply to my desire to know
how he intended to vote. However,
he did say that he saw "no logical
connection" between poverty and
political unrest. Central Americans
are using the guns that we buy them
in order to fight each other over the
' division of a pitifully inadequate
supply of resources. Zschau evi
dently thinks we should not help
them grow more food unless they

will accept still more guns.
I met Carnoy at registration and
talked to him. I was impressed by the
sanity and straightforwardness of his
answers after Zschau's evasive let
ters. Carnoy does think poverty
encourages unrest and does oppose
tying food aid to military aid — but
beyond that, he opposed mere
giveaway programs. He thinks that
giving basic agricultural and tech
nological aid would allow our allies
to become strong and free rather
than dependent upon us. A free and
prosperous nation is less liable to
revolution and will not need so much
military aid to keep itself from being

engulfed in civil war. American
education, Carnoy thinks, is one of
our greatest resources and one that
we could develop elsewhere. Zschau,
on the other hand, has supported
administration policies that
destroyed the Department of Educa
tion and cut off loans to middle-class
students. Zschau makes education
hard to get at home, and guns easy
to get abroad; Carnoy encourages
education both places, substituting
understanding for violence. The
choice is clear.
