## Danger in our response to terrorism

News of the CIA inst ;tion manual on assas
sination and sabotage only exposed a long-standing
U.S. government practice of using almost any
means to accomplish its foreign policy objectives.
Secretary of State George Shultz's recent call for
military retaliation against terrorists, even when it
means killing innocent people, was anything but a

VIEWPOINT

deviation from past policy. We need only recall
what an American officer in Vietnam said in 1968
after his men had leveled a city in an attack that left
more than 1,000 civilians dead: "It became neces
sary to destroy the town in order to save it."
What was noteworthy about Shultz's Oct. 25
speech, however, was that his remarks were made
in connection with Lebanon, where no one can be
certain of either the identity or the headquarters of
the groups responsible for anti-U.S. attacks. In
other words, Shultz is advocating military strikes
against targets chosen by guesswork in the hope of
discouraging further attacks. Such a policy might
make some Americans feel better, but it would fur
ther increase hostility toward the United States and
add to the level of violence.
Shultz praised Israel for using the tactics he
recommends. But how successful has Israel been?
Since 1948 Israeli forces have carried out dis
proportionate, often indiscriminate, retaliation for
acts of terrorism by Palestinians who had been
driven from their homes when Israel became a
state. Israeli military officers have freely admitted
striking civilian populations with the aim of turning
them against terrorists. But instead of ending the
bloodshed, this policy has helped keep Israel at war
during much of its existence, brought death to tens
of thousands of people and reduced to a shambles
Israel's defense-burdened economy.
Terrorist attacks against Israel's northern border

did end completely during an 11-month period in
1981-82, when the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion observed a cease-fire arranged by the United
States. Israel violated that cease-fire and invaded
Lebanon in June 1982, claiming that its purpose
was to destroy PLO terrorists. The PLO was driven
from Lebanon but the Israelis are still there. Now
they face daily attacks from Lebanese Moslems,
newly created enemies who resent the continued
presence of foreign occupying forces in their
country.
The nearly 300 Americans killed in Beirut were
not accidental victims. The United States is Israel's

closest ally. It supported and helped arm Israel's in
vasion and afterwards tried, unsuccessfully, to prop
up a Phalangist government that a majority of
Lebanese bitterly opposed. As part of this effort, in
December 1983 the battleship USS New Jersey
battered Lebanese mountain villages with 1,000-

pound shells. Six weeks ago the United States
vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution calling
for the easing of Israel's increasingly harsh occupa
tion policies in southern Lebanon. The bombing of
our embassy in East Beirut followed shortly after
wards.
Israel has suffered from terrorist attacks because
it occupies land that millions of Palestinians also lay
claim to. The violence seems bound to continue un
til some compromise settlement is achieved.
Americans in Lebanon have been attacked because
we have supported Israel's invasion and occupation
of southern Lebanon and also, perhaps, because we
are seen as the enemies of liberation and indepen
dence elsewhere in the world. Our policies have
aroused bitter grievances on the part of increas
ingly desperate people. Launching retaliatory
strikes will only add to these grievances and in the
process create new enemies.
In his speech, Shultz criticized those who "call
for a change in our policies and our principles" in
response to terrorism. Yet if these policies can only
be maintained through the exercise of more mili
tary force, we are heading down a dangerous road.
Shultz and the president he serves seem blind to the
connections between American actions abroad and
the acts of terrorism they provoke. Shultz and
Reagan seem unaware that the United States can
not attempt to impose its will around the world
without paying a price, that no matter how well
barricaded our embassies are, someone will find a
way to strike back. A re-examination of our
policies, an effort to understand the roots of oppo
sition and a greater sensitivity to the complexities
of the modern world would do more to end anti-
U.S. violence than all the retaliatory attacks that
Shultz envisions. His advocacy of such attacks,
which even the Pentagon opposes, reflects either a
dangerous ignorance or a willful refusal to face cur
rent realities.

means killing innocent people, was anything but a

VIEWPOINT

deviation from past policy. We need only recall
what an American officer in Vietnam said in 1968
after his men had leveled a city in an attack that left
more than 1,000 civilians dead: "It became neces
sary to destroy the town in order to save it."
What was noteworthy about Shultz's Oct. 25
speech, however, was that his remarks were made
in connection with Lebanon, where no one can be
certain of either the identity or the headquarters of
the groups responsible for anti-U.S. attacks. In
other words, Shultz is advocating military strikes
against targets chosen by guesswork in the hope of
discouraging further attacks. Such a policy might
make some Americans feel better, but it would fur
ther increase hostility toward the United States and
add to the level of violence.
Shultz praised Israel for using the tactics he
recommends. But how successful has Israel been?
Since 1948 Israeli forces have carried out dis
proportionate, often indiscriminate, retaliation for
acts of terrorism by Palestinians who had been
driven from their homes when Israel became a
state. Israeli military officers have freely admitted
striking civilian populations with the aim of turning
them against terrorists. But instead of ending the
bloodshed, this policy has helped keep Israel at war
during much of its existence, brought death to tens
of thousands of people and reduced to a shambles
Israel's defense-burdened economy.
Terrorist attacks against Israel's northern border

did end completely during an 11-month period in
1981-82, when the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion observed a cease-fire arranged by the United
States. Israel violated that cease-fire and invaded
Lebanon in June 1982, claiming that its purpose
was to destroy PLO terrorists. The PLO was driven
from Lebanon but the Israelis are still there. Now
they face daily attacks from Lebanese Moslems,
newly created enemies who resent the continued
presence of foreign occupying forces in their
country.
The nearly 300 Americans killed in Beirut were
not accidental victims. The United States is Israel's

closest ally. It supported and helped arm Israel's in
vasion and afterwards tried, unsuccessfully, to prop
up a Phalangist government that a majority of
Lebanese bitterly opposed. As part of this effort, in
December 1983 the battleship USS New Jersey
battered Lebanese mountain villages with 1,000-

pound shells. Six weeks ago the United States
vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution calling
for the easing of Israel's increasingly harsh occupa
tion policies in southern Lebanon. The bombing of
our embassy in East Beirut followed shortly after
wards.
Israel has suffered from terrorist attacks because
it occupies land that millions of Palestinians also lay
claim to. The violence seems bound to continue un
til some compromise settlement is achieved.
Americans in Lebanon have been attacked because
we have supported Israel's invasion and occupation
of southern Lebanon and also, perhaps, because we
are seen as the enemies of liberation and indepen
dence elsewhere in the world. Our policies have
aroused bitter grievances on the part of increas
ingly desperate people. Launching retaliatory
strikes will only add to these grievances and in the
process create new enemies.
In his speech, Shultz criticized those who "call
for a change in our policies and our principles" in
response to terrorism. Yet if these policies can only
be maintained through the exercise of more mili
tary force, we are heading down a dangerous road.
Shultz and the president he serves seem blind to the
connections between American actions abroad and
the acts of terrorism they provoke. Shultz and
Reagan seem unaware that the United States can
not attempt to impose its will around the world
without paying a price, that no matter how well
barricaded our embassies are, someone will find a
way to strike back. A re-examination of our
policies, an effort to understand the roots of oppo
sition and a greater sensitivity to the complexities
of the modern world would do more to end anti-
U.S. violence than all the retaliatory attacks that
Shultz envisions. His advocacy of such attacks,
which even the Pentagon opposes, reflects either a
dangerous ignorance or a willful refusal to face cur
rent realities.
