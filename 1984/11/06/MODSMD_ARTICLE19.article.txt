## 'Beyond Therapy' risks too much 
### MARC FAJER 
City Lights, a fairly new addition to
Bay Area theater, is a San Jose group
which has listed among its stated
goals, "to provide thought provoking,
innovative, risk-taking theater ..."
Their latest production, "Beyond
Therapy" by Christopher Durang, is
a funny but difficult piece well within
the realm of "provocative, innovative
and risk-taking." Unfortunately, not
all the actors in this production are up
to its demands, and the play itself is
too long. As a result, while "Beyond
Therapy" contains some absolutely
hysterical moments, the end result is
an unsatisfying evening of theater.
The play is about a man and a wo
man who meet through a personal ad.
Each is somewhat neurotic and has an
even more neurotic therapist. The
man, Bruce, also has a male lover,
Bob, at home but wants to marry the
woman, Prudence, and put Bob in a
room over the garage. Bruce and
Prudence have been well trained in
pop psychology by their therapists
and pepper their conversation with
psychobabble and attempts to grow
emotionally. Her therapist is a lech
erous man who has slept with her
already and would like to do so again.
His therapist is a slightly crazy wo
man who has trouble remembering
what word she is trying to say and
talks to her patients with a Snoopy
doll. The concept is funny and works
well for a while. Durang is as scath
ingly funny in attacking the preten
sions of psychology here as he is in
"Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All
For You" when he attacks American
Catholic education. The problem, as
in "Sister Mary," is that he has no
idea how to finish what he starts. In
this case, the play drags through a
fairly predictable second act without

adding much to what was present in
the first. City Lights would have done
well to cut the play before perfor
mance.
The production itself was uneven.
John Hodgkinson was wonderful as
Bruce. He is real, warm and appeal
ing on stage and carries off some very
difficult lines. He makes sense of his
character's confusion and makes
funny his attempts to let loose emo
tionally. Helen Reed Lehman
(founder of City Lights) is hysterical
as his therapist. When she blurts out
the wrong word (e.g., dirigible for
secretary), she goes through a com
plicated ritual of free association to
find the right one again, acting out
some of the words she is associating.
She also uses her Snoopy doll very
well, barking out "arf, arf, arf" when
her patients say something she agrees
with.
Barbara Cervantes-Gautschi does
not do as well as Prudence. She never
seems to quite get a handle on the
character and much of what she says
doesn't ring true. Part of the problem
may be that the play is supposedly set
in New York, and the actress does not
act like someone from New York.
There is a certain fast-paced, self
deprecatory style of humor that is
characteristic of New Yorkers that
seems to me to be written into the
character and Cervantes-Gautschi
does not even approach this. As a
result, the audience sympathy skews
heavily toward the character Bruce
and the balance of the play is thrown
off. William Kester as her therapist is
stereotypically sleazy, which works
well enough; the character is prob
ably the least well-written of the four
leads anyway.

Matt Leahy plays Bob (with help
from costumer Judy Miller) as
stereotypically gay as possible. Whe
ther this was his own choice, or that
of director Maria Ballentine, it
doesn't work particularly well. Be
cause the character of Bob is so shal
low, it undermines the credibility of
Bruce: Why is he attracted to some
one with so little personality? The
fault may be in the play itself, but the

production certainly doesn't help.
Marie Ballentine's directing is un
even. While doing very well with
staging and the handling of some of
the business, she does not keep the
pace up, and the show drags terribly
at the end of both acts. Her scene
changes deserve special mention. Roe
Trapasso is very funny playing both
the sexy secretary of the male thera
pist and the frumpy secretary of the

female therapist. She appears only in
the scene changes and moves to the
music while helping change the set.
The physicalization of the two women
is a joy to watch. Unfortunately, the
funny freshness of the brief scene
changes does not carry through the
whole show.
"Beyond Therapy" is in fact a chal
lenging, innovative piece. Unfortun

ately, City Lights needs to improve
their own work before being able to
seriously bring this sort of theater
successfully to the Bay Area. Still,
despite its slowness and flaws this is a
funny play and that does come
through in this production. "Beyond
Therapy" will be performed
Thursday through Sunday at 70
North Almaden in San Jose until
Nov. 17.

Catholic education. The problem, as
in "Sister Mary," is that he has no
idea how to finish what he starts. In
this case, the play drags through a
fairly predictable second act without

adding much to what was present in
the first. City Lights would have done
well to cut the play before perfor
mance.
The production itself was uneven.
John Hodgkinson was wonderful as
Bruce. He is real, warm and appeal
ing on stage and carries off some very
difficult lines. He makes sense of his
character's confusion and makes
funny his attempts to let loose emo
tionally. Helen Reed Lehman
(founder of City Lights) is hysterical
as his therapist. When she blurts out
the wrong word (e.g., dirigible for
secretary), she goes through a com
plicated ritual of free association to
find the right one again, acting out
some of the words she is associating.
She also uses her Snoopy doll very
well, barking out "arf, arf, arf" when
her patients say something she agrees
with.
Barbara Cervantes-Gautschi does
not do as well as Prudence. She never
seems to quite get a handle on the
character and much of what she says
doesn't ring true. Part of the problem
may be that the play is supposedly set
in New York, and the actress does not
act like someone from New York.
There is a certain fast-paced, self
deprecatory style of humor that is
characteristic of New Yorkers that
seems to me to be written into the
character and Cervantes-Gautschi
does not even approach this. As a
result, the audience sympathy skews
heavily toward the character Bruce
and the balance of the play is thrown
off. William Kester as her therapist is
stereotypically sleazy, which works
well enough; the character is prob
ably the least well-written of the four
leads anyway.

Matt Leahy plays Bob (with help
from costumer Judy Miller) as
stereotypically gay as possible. Whe
ther this was his own choice, or that
of director Maria Ballentine, it
doesn't work particularly well. Be
cause the character of Bob is so shal
low, it undermines the credibility of
Bruce: Why is he attracted to some
one with so little personality? The
fault may be in the play itself, but the

production certainly doesn't help.
Marie Ballentine's directing is un
even. While doing very well with
staging and the handling of some of
the business, she does not keep the
pace up, and the show drags terribly
at the end of both acts. Her scene
changes deserve special mention. Roe
Trapasso is very funny playing both
the sexy secretary of the male thera
pist and the frumpy secretary of the

female therapist. She appears only in
the scene changes and moves to the
music while helping change the set.
The physicalization of the two women
is a joy to watch. Unfortunately, the
funny freshness of the brief scene
changes does not carry through the
whole show.
"Beyond Therapy" is in fact a chal
lenging, innovative piece. Unfortun

ately, City Lights needs to improve
their own work before being able to
seriously bring this sort of theater
successfully to the Bay Area. Still,
despite its slowness and flaws this is a
funny play and that does come
through in this production. "Beyond
Therapy" will be performed
Thursday through Sunday at 70
North Almaden in San Jose until
Nov. 17.


Barbara Cervantes : Gautschi and John Hodgkinson tackle the problems of modern relationships in City Lights' "Beyond Therapy."
City Lights, a fairly new addition to
Bay Area theater, is a San Jose group
which has listed among its stated
goals, "to provide thought provoking,
innovative, risk-taking theater ..."
Their latest production, "Beyond
Therapy" by Christopher Durang, is
a funny but difficult piece well within
the realm of "provocative, innovative
and risk-taking." Unfortunately, not
all the actors in this production are up
to its demands, and the play itself is
too long. As a result, while "Beyond
Therapy" contains some absolutely
hysterical moments, the end result is
an unsatisfying evening of theater.
The play is about a man and a wo
man who meet through a personal ad.
Each is somewhat neurotic and has an
even more neurotic therapist. The
man, Bruce, also has a male lover,
Bob, at home but wants to marry the
woman, Prudence, and put Bob in a
room over the garage. Bruce and
Prudence have been well trained in
pop psychology by their therapists
and pepper their conversation with
psychobabble and attempts to grow
emotionally. Her therapist is a lech
erous man who has slept with her
already and would like to do so again.
His therapist is a slightly crazy wo
man who has trouble remembering
what word she is trying to say and
talks to her patients with a Snoopy
doll. The concept is funny and works
well for a while. Durang is as scath
ingly funny in attacking the preten
sions of psychology here as he is in
"Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All
For You" when he attacks American
Catholic education. The problem, as
in "Sister Mary," is that he has no
idea how to finish what he starts. In
this case, the play drags through a
fairly predictable second act without

adding much to what was present in
