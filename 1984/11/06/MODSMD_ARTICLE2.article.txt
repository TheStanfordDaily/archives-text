# Contract snarls Big Game buses

### BAIE NETZER Senior staff writer 
Plans for transportation to Big Game activi
ties hit a snag this weekend when the Axe Com
mittee was forced to notify those groups plan
ning to rent school buses that they might have to
find their own transportation or pay for a more
expensive luxury bus.
Due to last-minute contractual problems with
ARA Services, a school bus rental company, the
number of available school buses for Big Game
weekend went from 112 to 50, according to Axe
Committee treasurer Ann Remley.
Remley said 62 buses for Nov. 16 and 50
buses for Nov. 17 were ordered during the third
week of October. On Oct. 29, ARA services
notified the Axe Committee that they were
unable to provide that many buses.
"We sent them a letter threatening to sue un
less they honored our contract," Remley said.
"But we accepted their offer of 25 buses for
each night because we decided it was more im

portant to get people to the rally and the game
than to have more funds tied up in court fees."
After delivering letters to resident assistants
this weekend, the Axe Committee offered two
options to those signed up to rent school buses.
A lottery determined which groups would be
able to rent the $200 school buses. Those who
did not win the lottery could drop their order
and find their own transportation or agree to
rent a luxury bus for an additional $130.
Groups were notified of the lottery results
last night. There are 20 groups who will pay for
luxury buses for transportation to the Big Game
rally in San Francisco on Nov. 16 while 13
groups must now provide their own transporta
tion. On Nov. 17, 12 groups have chosen to rent
luxury buses while 12 groups decided to find
their own means of transportation to the game.
Kevin Solliday, Axe Committee chairman,
said there are enough luxury buses for all
