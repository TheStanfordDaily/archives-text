# Contract snarls Big Game buses
## 
### BAIE NETZER Senior staff writer 
Plans for transportation to Big Game activi
ties hit a snag this weekend when the Axe Com
mittee was forced to notify those groups plan
ning to rent school buses that they might have to
find their own transportation or pay for a more
expensive luxury bus.
Due to last-minute contractual problems with
ARA Services, a school bus rental company, the
number of available school buses for Big Game
weekend went from 112 to 50, according to Axe
Committee treasurer Ann Remley.
Remley said 62 buses for Nov. 16 and 50
buses for Nov. 17 were ordered during the third
week of October. On Oct. 29, ARA services
notified the Axe Committee that they were
unable to provide that many buses.
"We sent them a letter threatening to sue un
less they honored our contract," Remley said.
"But we accepted their offer of 25 buses for
each night because we decided it was more im

portant to get people to the rally and the game
than to have more funds tied up in court fees."
After delivering letters to resident assistants
this weekend, the Axe Committee offered two
options to those signed up to rent school buses.
A lottery determined which groups would be
able to rent the $200 school buses. Those who
did not win the lottery could drop their order
and find their own transportation or agree to
rent a luxury bus for an additional $130.
Groups were notified of the lottery results
last night. There are 20 groups who will pay for
luxury buses for transportation to the Big Game
rally in San Francisco on Nov. 16 while 13
groups must now provide their own transporta
tion. On Nov. 17, 12 groups have chosen to rent
luxury buses while 12 groups decided to find
their own means of transportation to the game.
Kevin Solliday, Axe Committee chairman,
said there are enough luxury buses for all
groups wanting to rent them.
"We had originally reserved a
slightly higher number of luxury
buses because we assumed that's
what people wanted," Solliday said.
"We're ready to cover all those who
want that option."
Greyhound Bus Lines and
Eastshore Lines Charter are two of
the companies providing luxury buses
for Big Game transportation.
Remley said ARA Services assured
Axe Committee members that they
would be able to provide enough
school buses during summer negotia
tions.
"We told them in the middle of the
summer that we would probably need
35 or 40 buses, and they said 'that's
fine, you can get as many as you
want,' " she said.
The Axe Committee informed
ARA Services of the exact number of
buses needed in October after all or
ders for buses were in. According to
Solliday, ARA Services did not give
any indication of a problem so the
Axe Committee sent in a deposit for
one-half the total rental fee.
Remley said ARA Services told
Axe Committee members the follow
ing week that the company's dis
patchers took reservations and that
no one in authority had seen the exact
order.
"They also said that the price they
quoted us for Saturday was $60 under
the cost and that there was a limit on
how much bus drivers can work in
one day," Remley said. "So because
of school routes on Friday, they
couldn't provide enough drivers on
Friday night."
After consulting with corporate
lawyer Hal Michelson, the Axe Com
mittee then sent a letter to ARA
Services threatening to sue if a verbal
contract was not honored. Following
negotiations, ARA offered 25 buses
for each night.

Axe Committee members stressed
that the decision not to go to court
was due to concern over wasted court
fees.
"We figured we got a decent deal,
though not what we wanted," Remley
said. "But we still got the cheapest
price on school buses."
"The main point wasn't to sue,"
Solliday said. "The main point was to
get people to the rally and the game
and to make transportation as con
venient as possible."
Big Game activities will also be
marked this year by the absence of a
"Meganooner" party the day before
the Big Game. Solliday said the scope
of the Axe Committee's financial and
manpower commitments did not al
low enough time or funds for a
Meganooner.
According to Remley, the Inter-
Fraternity Council decided not to or
ganize this year's Meganooner, and
Miller High Life did not express in
terest in sponsoring the event as they
did last year.
Solliday said Axe Committee
members offered other groups the
option of organizing the event.
"The simple fact was that there was
not enough time or funds to get the
sponsorship necessary," Solliday said.
The Thursday night rally following
a Gaities performance and rally by
the Band will be held at Frost Am
phitheatre. Remley said the history of
the Axe will be stressed with a story
telling by band announcer Hal Mic
helson. The football team will also be
present, and there is a possibility of
Jack Elway speaking.
Remley also said the Axe Commit
tee now has 100 monitors for the
Friday night rally in San Francisco.
Volunteers from the Stanford crew
team, Sigma Chi and Kappa Sigma
fraternities will monitor the event.
