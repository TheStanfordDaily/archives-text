# 'Double': Breaking De Palma's code
## 
### Steve Vineberg 
Brian De Palma's "Body Double"
begins, as his "Blow Out" did, with
an audience teaser. Behind the jokey
titles — thick blood drips down each
letter, leaving the tip deathly white —
the camera descends past a statue to a
tomb enclosing a vampire in glitter
rock garb, and as he comes into close
up, he turns and does a horror take
for us. The moonlit graveyard, the
mock De Chirico setting and the scare
are all fake, of course: We're watch
ing the filming of a schlock Gothic,
featuring a young actor named Jake
Scully (Craig Wasson) as the post
" Rocky Horror Picture Show" ghoul
and directed by a tough, no-nonsense
pro named Rubin (Dennis Franz,
who played the detective in "Dressed
to Kill" and the porno dealer in
"Blow Out"). The real horror begins
an instant later, when Jake, who suf-.
fers from claustrophobia, freezes in
the middle of the scene and has to be
hauled out of the coffin. His nerves
shot, Jake goes home early, only to
find his girlfriend (whose apartment
he shares) in bed with another man.
Jake moves in temporarily with a
bartender friend, but he feels his life
is on hold: He doesn't have a place of
his own, he no longer has a lover, and
his claustrophobia seems to have
placed a stranglehold on his work. In
acting class, he does a paralyzing
emotion memory exercise, reliving a
childhood game of hide and seek
when, hidden in a dark place, he got
too scared to move, and the acting
teacher's bullying tactics can't snap
him out of his fear. Another actor sit
ting in casually on the class, Sam
(Gregg Henry), is so outraged at the
instructor's insensitivity to the depth
of Jake's terror that he interrupts the
class and pulls Jake out of it, buying
him a drink to calm him down. Sam, it
turns out, has been called out of town
for a show and needs someone to take
over his house-sitting assignment, so
before he flies to Seattle he sets Jake
up in a breathtaking bachelor's pad
complete with rotating bed, satellite
dish and high-powered telescope.
And he lets Jake in on a voyeur's se
cret: a gorgeous brunette neighbor
who performs a mostly nude mastur
batory dance every night at the same
hour with her bedroom blinds wide
open. Feeling guilty and turned on at
the same time, Jake keeps watching,
but he sees more than he bargained
for — swinging the telescope around,
he discovers a second voyeur, an In
dian who, he begins to believe, means
to do his pretty neighbor some harm.
Brian De Palma's affection for
Alfred Hitchcock is well known. In
1976 he tried an hommage to
"Vertigo," "Obsession"; and
"Dressed to Kill," his most sheerly
entertaining murder mystery, is a series
of variations on "Psycho," with a
silent erotic chase scene in a museum
that derives from James Stewart's
pursuit of Kim Novak in the early
parts of "Vertigo." (The opening of
"Carrie" has connections to
"Psycho" as well, and "North by
Northwest" pops up in "The Fury.")
But De Palma has always used
Hitchcock as a starting-off point,
spinning audacious twists on classic
sequences and creating his own clas
sics, just as his best film, "Blow Out,"
is constructed on top of "Blow-Up"
and"The Conversation." So, recog
nizing the twin plots of "Rear Win
dow" and "Vertigo" in "Body
Double," we wait patiently for De
Palma to move beyond them to some
thing of his own, something riskier
and more complex and (based on our
expectations after "Blow Out") more
personal.
Meanwhile, we enjoy the seductive
elegance of his craftsmanship, be
cause after the debacle of last year's
"Scarface" (which, however, made
money for him), he's clearly in com
plete control again. One scene pat
terned closely on both "Vertigo" and
"Dressed to Kill" is a deluxe enter
tainment. Jake spots his neighbor,
Gloria (Deborah Shelton), in her car
and sees the Indian trailing her, so he

follows them both to a shopping mall.
Everything in the mall seems to be
encased in glass, including the
elevator, and the way De Palma
choreographs the sequence, we can
predict every step an instant before it
happens, so that it has a hal
lucinatory, deja vu quality. The
photographer, Stephen Burum, al
lows the sunlight to bleach out the
color just a trace, giving the whole
scene a dusted glow, and at one point
Jake and Gloria are riding together in
the elevator and he's about to warn
her about the Indian when the doors
oart and the sun pours in as a group
of shoppers intrudes on their privacy
— the sun, which we experience as a
visceral shock, is as much of an intru
sion as the shoppers are. A moment
later, the doors open again and Jake
sees the Indian standing outside the
elevator, his menacing gaze bearing
down on Jake but apparently un
noticed by anyone else. It's a glitter
ing optical illusion of a sequence, and
it could only have been perpetrated
by a master director.
But there's something unsettling
about De Palma's playfulness in
"Body Double," because for a long
time you can't figure out who's the
target of his joke or when he's going
to arrive at the punch line. He doesn't
draw on Hitchcock here; he reprises

him, tossing in bits from "Psycho"
and "Dial 'M' for Murder," too, and
paralleling "Rear Window" and
"Vertigo" for such long stretches that
his single-mindedness is bewildering.
The only significant difference be
tween Hitchcock's version and De
Palma's is that De Palma's characters
get into much deeper and messier
trouble — the inevitable murder is
much more grisly (and nerve
wracking) than anything we see in
"Vertigo" or "Rear Window," and
the plot takes Jake into the under
ground world of pornography, where
he encounters an actress named Holly
Body, the star of a number of X-rated
films. (Even the casting of Melanie
Griffith, who gives a charmingingly
unaffected performance as Holly, is
loaded: Her mother is Tippi Hedren,
the Hitchcock discovery who played
leading roles in "The Birds" and
"Marnie.") And that's not all: De
Palma hacks pieces from his own
movies, too (chiefly " Dressed to Kill"
and "Blow Out," but also "Carrie,"
"Obsession," "The Fury," "Phantom
of the Paradise" and even
"Scarface") and throws them at us
like severed limbs, cut off from the
dramatic logic and thematic unity of
these pictures so that they no longer
make sense except as parody.
De Palma is far too sophisticated a
director to have mimicked Hitchcock
by accident, particularly at this point
in his career, and the care with which
he has assembled "Body Double" in
all other respects (he even gets fairly
good work out of Craig Wasson,
whose acting is normally beyond the
pale) contradicts the immediate
transparency and increasing im
plausibility of the plot. (You don't
have to have seen "Vertigo" to un
derstand how to interpret the nar
rative undercurrents.) No, De Palma
evidently wants us to see what he's up
to, stylistically and in plot terms, and
he wants us to identify his sources and
register how little he's moved beyond
them. Why?

There's a message for us in "Body
Double," but it's coded, and to break
the code we have to look closely at
Brian De Palma's career. For seven
years (1974 to 1981) De Palma
turned out one extraordinary picture
after another (with the single excep
tion of "Obsession"), but very few
critics or devoted filmgoers took him
seriously. His rock musical send-up of
"The Phantom of the Opera" and
"Faust," "The Phantom of the
Paradise," was extravagantly witty,
but it was roundly ignored, while
"The Rocky Horror Picture Show,"
which looks anemic beside it, became
a cult favorite. "Carrie" was a box of
fice smash, but the press only grew
fond of it in retrospect, so that they
could use it as a club to beat his next
film, "The Fury," failing to notice
that he had done the same trick bril
liantly in both movies — transformed
cartoon-Gothic trash into the real
stuff of nightmares.
By the time he made "Dressed to
Kill" in 1980, he had become the pet
whipping boy of certain myopic
feminist critics who decided that any
male director who repeatedly showed
attractive women meeting violent
ends must be misogynistic (a tag no
one had ever dared to stick on Alfred
Hitchcock) and certain idolatrous
auteur critics who slapped him down

for imitating Hitchcock (as though no
artist before De Palma had ever
reflected the work of an earlier art
ist). Again, "Dressed to Kill" was a
box office champion — which only
fueled the fire of his detractors, who
could now claim he was pandering to
his audiences by serving up all the sex
and violence they craved.
Then came "Blow Out," which
should have been universally
recognized as De Palma's
breakthrough. In this thriller about
how a movie sound man (beautifully
played by John Travolta) witnesses a
murder and uncovers a political con
spiracy, the hero was as close to the
director himself as the Harvey Keitel
character in "Mean Streets" was to
Martin Scorsese, and his growing hor
ror at the way everyone he encoun
tered turned a deaf ear to the implica
tions of the incident rang out with ur
gency. In "Blow Out," De Palma fi
nally abandoned Fantasyland,
employing his astonishing gifts for
sounding the depths of a nightmare to
address an important issue; the movie
was a contemporary American
tragedy that deserved to be discussed
alongside "The Conversation"
(which it superseded) and the
"Godfather" pictures and
"Nashville." But mostly one heard
complaints that it wasn't as suspense
ful as "Dressed to Kill" (which is a
little like saying that "The Godfat
her" wasn't as exciting as "Public
Enemy"), that it copied "The Con
versation" and "Blow-Up," that once
again that vile woman hater Brian De
Palma was murdering off his female
characters.
De Palma took another critical
flogging for "Scarface," which really
was an awful picture — but not for
the reasons one kept hearing. It
wasn't another blood-and-guts ex
travaganza from a garish purveyor of
violence; the problem was that it was
sluggish and redundant and over
stated. (Those who shied away from

the violence never answered the
question De Palma, along with other
major filmmakers like Arthur Penn,
Sam Peckinpah, Francis Coppola and
Martin Scorsese, have been asking for
almost two decades: How does a
filmmaker cope with the realities of
modern American society without in
troducing graphic violence.)
In "Body Double" De Palma turns
on his critics — and his audiences.
Okay, he seems to be saying, if you
think I'm just a Hitchcock imitator,
then that's what I'll be. If you think
all I can offer is mindless, sexy vio
lence, I'll smear the screen with it.

"Body Double" is a very disturbing
movie, but not because it's cheaply
manipulative (nothing in it is cheap)
or revealing of the director's deep
seated psychological problem (De
Palma is too shrewd to be easily psy
choanalyzed) or vacuous. Its very
emptiness is a hoax, since it spells out
a bulletin to the audience.
The ads for a horror cheapie in the
early 1970s read, "Keep repeating to
yourself, 'It's only a movie, it's only a
movie, it's only a movie ...' " but the
horrific endings of "Carrie" and " The
Fury" played hell with audiences who
wanted to distance themselves from
what they saw on the screen, and the
last scene in "Blow Out" was as
frightening a vision of life-as-extended
nightmare as any American director
has given us. In "Body Double" De

Palma reassures us, mockingly, that
those ads were right — he tells us
over and over again that we're watch
ing a movie. Early in the film (right
after the soundstage opening) he cuts
to a desert landscape, then rolls it out
of the way and into a storage barn —
it's just a backdrop. And the last shot
is of a vampire in Rubin's movie
squeezing fake blood over the breasts
of a stand-in actress (a "body
double") in close-up. After "Blow
Out," in which he put himself on the
line, "Body Double" is a retreat, but
no one in movie history has ever
retreated as cannily or as merrily as
Brian De Palma. Loud as his laughter
is, though, it can't drown out the
sound of his bitterness as he denies
he's ever had anything to offer us
besides cheap, derivative thrills.
Brian De Palma's "Body Double"

choreographs the sequence, we can
predict every step an instant before it
happens, so that it has a hal
lucinatory, deja vu quality. The
photographer, Stephen Burum, al
lows the sunlight to bleach out the
color just a trace, giving the whole
scene a dusted glow, and at one point
Jake and Gloria are riding together in
the elevator and he's about to warn
her about the Indian when the doors
oart and the sun pours in as a group
of shoppers intrudes on their privacy
— the sun, which we experience as a
visceral shock, is as much of an intru
sion as the shoppers are. A moment
later, the doors open again and Jake
sees the Indian standing outside the
elevator, his menacing gaze bearing
down on Jake but apparently un
noticed by anyone else. It's a glitter
ing optical illusion of a sequence, and
it could only have been perpetrated
by a master director.
But there's something unsettling
about De Palma's playfulness in
"Body Double," because for a long
time you can't figure out who's the
target of his joke or when he's going
to arrive at the punch line. He doesn't
draw on Hitchcock here; he reprises

him, tossing in bits from "Psycho"
and "Dial 'M' for Murder," too, and
paralleling "Rear Window" and
"Vertigo" for such long stretches that
his single-mindedness is bewildering.
The only significant difference be
tween Hitchcock's version and De
Palma's is that De Palma's characters
get into much deeper and messier
trouble — the inevitable murder is
much more grisly (and nerve
wracking) than anything we see in
"Vertigo" or "Rear Window," and
the plot takes Jake into the under
ground world of pornography, where
he encounters an actress named Holly
Body, the star of a number of X-rated
films. (Even the casting of Melanie
Griffith, who gives a charmingingly
unaffected performance as Holly, is
loaded: Her mother is Tippi Hedren,
the Hitchcock discovery who played
leading roles in "The Birds" and
"Marnie.") And that's not all: De
Palma hacks pieces from his own
movies, too (chiefly " Dressed to Kill"
and "Blow Out," but also "Carrie,"
"Obsession," "The Fury," "Phantom
of the Paradise" and even
"Scarface") and throws them at us
like severed limbs, cut off from the
dramatic logic and thematic unity of
these pictures so that they no longer
make sense except as parody.
De Palma is far too sophisticated a
director to have mimicked Hitchcock
by accident, particularly at this point
in his career, and the care with which
he has assembled "Body Double" in
all other respects (he even gets fairly
good work out of Craig Wasson,
whose acting is normally beyond the
pale) contradicts the immediate
transparency and increasing im
plausibility of the plot. (You don't
have to have seen "Vertigo" to un
derstand how to interpret the nar
rative undercurrents.) No, De Palma
evidently wants us to see what he's up
to, stylistically and in plot terms, and
he wants us to identify his sources and
register how little he's moved beyond
them. Why?

There's a message for us in "Body
Double," but it's coded, and to break
the code we have to look closely at
Brian De Palma's career. For seven
years (1974 to 1981) De Palma
turned out one extraordinary picture
after another (with the single excep
tion of "Obsession"), but very few
critics or devoted filmgoers took him
seriously. His rock musical send-up of
"The Phantom of the Opera" and
"Faust," "The Phantom of the
Paradise," was extravagantly witty,
but it was roundly ignored, while
"The Rocky Horror Picture Show,"
which looks anemic beside it, became
a cult favorite. "Carrie" was a box of
fice smash, but the press only grew
fond of it in retrospect, so that they
could use it as a club to beat his next
film, "The Fury," failing to notice
that he had done the same trick bril
liantly in both movies — transformed
cartoon-Gothic trash into the real
stuff of nightmares.
By the time he made "Dressed to
Kill" in 1980, he had become the pet
whipping boy of certain myopic
feminist critics who decided that any
male director who repeatedly showed
attractive women meeting violent
ends must be misogynistic (a tag no
one had ever dared to stick on Alfred
Hitchcock) and certain idolatrous
auteur critics who slapped him down

for imitating Hitchcock (as though no
artist before De Palma had ever
reflected the work of an earlier art
ist). Again, "Dressed to Kill" was a
box office champion — which only
fueled the fire of his detractors, who
could now claim he was pandering to
his audiences by serving up all the sex
and violence they craved.
Then came "Blow Out," which
should have been universally
recognized as De Palma's
breakthrough. In this thriller about
how a movie sound man (beautifully
played by John Travolta) witnesses a
murder and uncovers a political con
spiracy, the hero was as close to the
director himself as the Harvey Keitel
character in "Mean Streets" was to
Martin Scorsese, and his growing hor
ror at the way everyone he encoun
tered turned a deaf ear to the implica
tions of the incident rang out with ur
gency. In "Blow Out," De Palma fi
nally abandoned Fantasyland,
employing his astonishing gifts for
sounding the depths of a nightmare to
address an important issue; the movie
was a contemporary American
tragedy that deserved to be discussed
alongside "The Conversation"
(which it superseded) and the
"Godfather" pictures and
"Nashville." But mostly one heard
complaints that it wasn't as suspense
ful as "Dressed to Kill" (which is a
little like saying that "The Godfat
her" wasn't as exciting as "Public
Enemy"), that it copied "The Con
versation" and "Blow-Up," that once
again that vile woman hater Brian De
Palma was murdering off his female
characters.
De Palma took another critical
flogging for "Scarface," which really
was an awful picture — but not for
the reasons one kept hearing. It
wasn't another blood-and-guts ex
travaganza from a garish purveyor of
violence; the problem was that it was
sluggish and redundant and over
stated. (Those who shied away from

the violence never answered the
question De Palma, along with other
major filmmakers like Arthur Penn,
Sam Peckinpah, Francis Coppola and
Martin Scorsese, have been asking for
almost two decades: How does a
filmmaker cope with the realities of
modern American society without in
troducing graphic violence.)
In "Body Double" De Palma turns
on his critics — and his audiences.
Okay, he seems to be saying, if you
think I'm just a Hitchcock imitator,
then that's what I'll be. If you think
all I can offer is mindless, sexy vio
lence, I'll smear the screen with it.

"Body Double" is a very disturbing
movie, but not because it's cheaply
manipulative (nothing in it is cheap)
or revealing of the director's deep
seated psychological problem (De
Palma is too shrewd to be easily psy
choanalyzed) or vacuous. Its very
emptiness is a hoax, since it spells out
a bulletin to the audience.
The ads for a horror cheapie in the
early 1970s read, "Keep repeating to
yourself, 'It's only a movie, it's only a
movie, it's only a movie ...' " but the
horrific endings of "Carrie" and " The
Fury" played hell with audiences who
wanted to distance themselves from
what they saw on the screen, and the
last scene in "Blow Out" was as
frightening a vision of life-as-extended
nightmare as any American director
has given us. In "Body Double" De

Palma reassures us, mockingly, that
those ads were right — he tells us
over and over again that we're watch
ing a movie. Early in the film (right
after the soundstage opening) he cuts
to a desert landscape, then rolls it out
of the way and into a storage barn —
it's just a backdrop. And the last shot
is of a vampire in Rubin's movie
squeezing fake blood over the breasts
of a stand-in actress (a "body
double") in close-up. After "Blow
Out," in which he put himself on the
line, "Body Double" is a retreat, but
no one in movie history has ever
retreated as cannily or as merrily as
Brian De Palma. Loud as his laughter
is, though, it can't drown out the
sound of his bitterness as he denies
he's ever had anything to offer us
besides cheap, derivative thrills.
Brian De Palma's "Body Double"
begins, as his "Blow Out" did, with
an audience teaser. Behind the jokey
titles — thick blood drips down each
letter, leaving the tip deathly white —
the camera descends past a statue to a
tomb enclosing a vampire in glitter
rock garb, and as he comes into close
up, he turns and does a horror take
for us. The moonlit graveyard, the
mock De Chirico setting and the scare
are all fake, of course: We're watch
ing the filming of a schlock Gothic,
featuring a young actor named Jake
Scully (Craig Wasson) as the post
" Rocky Horror Picture Show" ghoul
and directed by a tough, no-nonsense
pro named Rubin (Dennis Franz,
who played the detective in "Dressed
to Kill" and the porno dealer in
"Blow Out"). The real horror begins
an instant later, when Jake, who suf-.
fers from claustrophobia, freezes in
the middle of the scene and has to be
hauled out of the coffin. His nerves
shot, Jake goes home early, only to
find his girlfriend (whose apartment
he shares) in bed with another man.
Jake moves in temporarily with a
bartender friend, but he feels his life
is on hold: He doesn't have a place of
his own, he no longer has a lover, and
his claustrophobia seems to have
placed a stranglehold on his work. In
acting class, he does a paralyzing
emotion memory exercise, reliving a
childhood game of hide and seek
when, hidden in a dark place, he got
too scared to move, and the acting
teacher's bullying tactics can't snap
him out of his fear. Another actor sit
ting in casually on the class, Sam
(Gregg Henry), is so outraged at the
instructor's insensitivity to the depth
of Jake's terror that he interrupts the
class and pulls Jake out of it, buying
him a drink to calm him down. Sam, it
turns out, has been called out of town
for a show and needs someone to take
over his house-sitting assignment, so
before he flies to Seattle he sets Jake
up in a breathtaking bachelor's pad
complete with rotating bed, satellite
dish and high-powered telescope.
And he lets Jake in on a voyeur's se
cret: a gorgeous brunette neighbor
who performs a mostly nude mastur
batory dance every night at the same
hour with her bedroom blinds wide
open. Feeling guilty and turned on at
the same time, Jake keeps watching,
but he sees more than he bargained
for — swinging the telescope around,
he discovers a second voyeur, an In
dian who, he begins to believe, means
to do his pretty neighbor some harm.
Brian De Palma's affection for
Alfred Hitchcock is well known. In
1976 he tried an hommage to
"Vertigo," "Obsession"; and
"Dressed to Kill," his most sheerly
entertaining murder mystery, is a series
of variations on "Psycho," with a
silent erotic chase scene in a museum
that derives from James Stewart's
pursuit of Kim Novak in the early
parts of "Vertigo." (The opening of
"Carrie" has connections to
"Psycho" as well, and "North by
Northwest" pops up in "The Fury.")
But De Palma has always used
Hitchcock as a starting-off point,
spinning audacious twists on classic
sequences and creating his own clas
sics, just as his best film, "Blow Out,"
is constructed on top of "Blow-Up"
and"The Conversation." So, recog
nizing the twin plots of "Rear Win
dow" and "Vertigo" in "Body
Double," we wait patiently for De
Palma to move beyond them to some
thing of his own, something riskier
and more complex and (based on our
expectations after "Blow Out") more
personal.
Meanwhile, we enjoy the seductive
elegance of his craftsmanship, be
cause after the debacle of last year's
"Scarface" (which, however, made
money for him), he's clearly in com
plete control again. One scene pat
terned closely on both "Vertigo" and
"Dressed to Kill" is a deluxe enter
tainment. Jake spots his neighbor,
Gloria (Deborah Shelton), in her car
and sees the Indian trailing her, so he

follows them both to a shopping mall.
Everything in the mall seems to be
encased in glass, including the
elevator, and the way De Palma
choreographs the sequence, we can
predict every step an instant before it
happens, so that it has a hal
lucinatory, deja vu quality. The
photographer, Stephen Burum, al
lows the sunlight to bleach out the
color just a trace, giving the whole
scene a dusted glow, and at one point
Jake and Gloria are riding together in
the elevator and he's about to warn
her about the Indian when the doors

of shoppers intrudes on their privacy
— the sun, which we experience as a
visceral shock, is as much of an intru

elevator, his menacing gaze bearing

feminist critics who decided that any
male director who repeatedly showed
attractive women meeting violent
ends must be misogynistic (a tag no
one had ever dared to stick on Alfred
Hitchcock) and certain idolatrous
auteur critics who slapped him down

for imitating Hitchcock (as though no
artist before De Palma had ever
reflected the work of an earlier art
ist). Again, "Dressed to Kill" was a
box office champion — which only
fueled the fire of his detractors, who
could now claim he was pandering to
his audiences by serving up all the sex
and violence they craved.
Then came "Blow Out," which
should have been universally
recognized as De Palma's
breakthrough. In this thriller about
how a movie sound man (beautifully
played by John Travolta) witnesses a
murder and uncovers a political con
spiracy, the hero was as close to the
director himself as the Harvey Keitel
character in "Mean Streets" was to
Martin Scorsese, and his growing hor
ror at the way everyone he encoun
tered turned a deaf ear to the implica
tions of the incident rang out with ur
gency. In "Blow Out," De Palma fi
nally abandoned Fantasyland,
employing his astonishing gifts for
sounding the depths of a nightmare to
address an important issue; the movie
was a contemporary American
tragedy that deserved to be discussed
alongside "The Conversation"
(which it superseded) and the
"Godfather" pictures and
"Nashville." But mostly one heard
complaints that it wasn't as suspense
ful as "Dressed to Kill" (which is a
little like saying that "The Godfat
her" wasn't as exciting as "Public
Enemy"), that it copied "The Con
versation" and "Blow-Up," that once
again that vile woman hater Brian De
Palma was murdering off his female
characters.
De Palma took another critical
flogging for "Scarface," which really
was an awful picture — but not for
the reasons one kept hearing. It
wasn't another blood-and-guts ex
travaganza from a garish purveyor of

question De Palma, along with other
major filmmakers like Arthur Penn,
Sam Peckinpah, Francis Coppola and
Martin Scorsese, have been asking for
almost two decades: How does a
filmmaker cope with the realities of
modern American society without in
troducing graphic violence.)
In "Body Double" De Palma turns
on his critics — and his audiences.
Okay, he seems to be saying, if you
think I'm just a Hitchcock imitator,
then that's what I'll be. If you think
all I can offer is mindless, sexy vio
lence, I'll smear the screen with it.

"Body Double" is a very disturbing
movie, but not because it's cheaply
manipulative (nothing in it is cheap)
or revealing of the director's deep
seated psychological problem (De
Palma is too shrewd to be easily psy
choanalyzed) or vacuous. Its very
emptiness is a hoax, since it spells out
a bulletin to the audience.
The ads for a horror cheapie in the
early 1970s read, "Keep repeating to
yourself, 'It's only a movie, it's only a
movie, it's only a movie ...' " but the
horrific endings of "Carrie" and " The
Fury" played hell with audiences who
wanted to distance themselves from
what they saw on the screen, and the
last scene in "Blow Out" was as
frightening a vision of life-as-extended
nightmare as any American director
has given us. In "Body Double" De

Palma reassures us, mockingly, that
those ads were right — he tells us
over and over again that we're watch
ing a movie. Early in the film (right
after the soundstage opening) he cuts
to a desert landscape, then rolls it out
of the way and into a storage barn —
it's just a backdrop. And the last shot
is of a vampire in Rubin's movie
squeezing fake blood over the breasts
of a stand-in actress (a "body
double") in close-up. After "Blow
Out," in which he put himself on the
line, "Body Double" is a retreat, but
no one in movie history has ever
retreated as cannily or as merrily as
Brian De Palma. Loud as his laughter
is, though, it can't drown out the
sound of his bitterness as he denies
he's ever had anything to offer us
besides cheap, derivative thrills.
Brian De Palma's "Body Double"
begins, as his "Blow Out" did, with
an audience teaser. Behind the jokey
titles — thick blood drips down each
letter, leaving the tip deathly white —
the camera descends past a statue to a
tomb enclosing a vampire in glitter
rock garb, and as he comes into close
up, he turns and does a horror take
for us. The moonlit graveyard, the
mock De Chirico setting and the scare
are all fake, of course: We're watch
ing the filming of a schlock Gothic,
featuring a young actor named Jake
Scully (Craig Wasson) as the post
" Rocky Horror Picture Show" ghoul
and directed by a tough, no-nonsense
pro named Rubin (Dennis Franz,
who played the detective in "Dressed
to Kill" and the porno dealer in
"Blow Out"). The real horror begins
an instant later, when Jake, who suf-.
fers from claustrophobia, freezes in
the middle of the scene and has to be
hauled out of the coffin. His nerves
shot, Jake goes home early, only to
find his girlfriend (whose apartment
he shares) in bed with another man.
Jake moves in temporarily with a
bartender friend, but he feels his life
is on hold: He doesn't have a place of
his own, he no longer has a lover, and
his claustrophobia seems to have
placed a stranglehold on his work. In
acting class, he does a paralyzing
emotion memory exercise, reliving a
childhood game of hide and seek
when, hidden in a dark place, he got
too scared to move, and the acting
teacher's bullying tactics can't snap
him out of his fear. Another actor sit
ting in casually on the class, Sam
(Gregg Henry), is so outraged at the
instructor's insensitivity to the depth
of Jake's terror that he interrupts the
class and pulls Jake out of it, buying
him a drink to calm him down. Sam, it
turns out, has been called out of town
for a show and needs someone to take
over his house-sitting assignment, so
before he flies to Seattle he sets Jake
up in a breathtaking bachelor's pad
complete with rotating bed, satellite
dish and high-powered telescope.
And he lets Jake in on a voyeur's se
cret: a gorgeous brunette neighbor
who performs a mostly nude mastur
batory dance every night at the same
hour with her bedroom blinds wide
open. Feeling guilty and turned on at
the same time, Jake keeps watching,
but he sees more than he bargained
for — swinging the telescope around,
he discovers a second voyeur, an In
dian who, he begins to believe, means
to do his pretty neighbor some harm.
Brian De Palma's affection for
Alfred Hitchcock is well known. In
1976 he tried an hommage to
"Vertigo," "Obsession"; and
"Dressed to Kill," his most sheerly
entertaining murder mystery, is a series
of variations on "Psycho," with a
silent erotic chase scene in a museum
that derives from James Stewart's
pursuit of Kim Novak in the early
parts of "Vertigo." (The opening of
"Carrie" has connections to
"Psycho" as well, and "North by
Northwest" pops up in "The Fury.")
But De Palma has always used
Hitchcock as a starting-off point,
spinning audacious twists on classic
sequences and creating his own clas
sics, just as his best film, "Blow Out,"
is constructed on top of "Blow-Up"
and"The Conversation." So, recog
nizing the twin plots of "Rear Win
dow" and "Vertigo" in "Body
Double," we wait patiently for De
Palma to move beyond them to some
thing of his own, something riskier
and more complex and (based on our
expectations after "Blow Out") more
personal.
Meanwhile, we enjoy the seductive
elegance of his craftsmanship, be
cause after the debacle of last year's
"Scarface" (which, however, made
money for him), he's clearly in com
plete control again. One scene pat
terned closely on both "Vertigo" and
"Dressed to Kill" is a deluxe enter
tainment. Jake spots his neighbor,
Gloria (Deborah Shelton), in her car
and sees the Indian trailing her, so he

follows them both to a shopping mall.
Everything in the mall seems to be
encased in glass, including the
elevator, and the way De Palma
choreographs the sequence, we can
predict every step an instant before it
happens, so that it has a hal
lucinatory, deja vu quality. The
photographer, Stephen Burum, al
lows the sunlight to bleach out the
color just a trace, giving the whole
scene a dusted glow, and at one point
Jake and Gloria are riding together in
the elevator and he's about to warn
her about the Indian when the doors
oart and the sun pours in as a group
of shoppers intrudes on their privacy
— the sun, which we experience as a
visceral shock, is as much of an intru
sion as the shoppers are. A moment
later, the doors open again and Jake
sees the Indian standing outside the
elevator, his menacing gaze bearing
down on Jake but apparently un
noticed by anyone else. It's a glitter
ing optical illusion of a sequence, and
it could only have been perpetrated
by a master director.
But there's something unsettling
about De Palma's playfulness in
"Body Double," because for a long
time you can't figure out who's the
target of his joke or when he's going
to arrive at the punch line. He doesn't
draw on Hitchcock here; he reprises

him, tossing in bits from "Psycho"
and "Dial 'M' for Murder," too, and
paralleling "Rear Window" and
"Vertigo" for such long stretches that
his single-mindedness is bewildering.
The only significant difference be
tween Hitchcock's version and De
Palma's is that De Palma's characters
get into much deeper and messier
trouble — the inevitable murder is
much more grisly (and nerve
wracking) than anything we see in
"Vertigo" or "Rear Window," and
the plot takes Jake into the under
ground world of pornography, where
he encounters an actress named Holly
Body, the star of a number of X-rated
films. (Even the casting of Melanie
Griffith, who gives a charmingingly
unaffected performance as Holly, is
loaded: Her mother is Tippi Hedren,
the Hitchcock discovery who played
leading roles in "The Birds" and
"Marnie.") And that's not all: De
Palma hacks pieces from his own
movies, too (chiefly " Dressed to Kill"
and "Blow Out," but also "Carrie,"
"Obsession," "The Fury," "Phantom
of the Paradise" and even
"Scarface") and throws them at us
like severed limbs, cut off from the
dramatic logic and thematic unity of
these pictures so that they no longer
make sense except as parody.
De Palma is far too sophisticated a
director to have mimicked Hitchcock
by accident, particularly at this point
in his career, and the care with which
he has assembled "Body Double" in
all other respects (he even gets fairly
good work out of Craig Wasson,
whose acting is normally beyond the
pale) contradicts the immediate
transparency and increasing im
plausibility of the plot. (You don't
have to have seen "Vertigo" to un
derstand how to interpret the nar
rative undercurrents.) No, De Palma
evidently wants us to see what he's up
to, stylistically and in plot terms, and
he wants us to identify his sources and
register how little he's moved beyond
them. Why?

There's a message for us in "Body
Double," but it's coded, and to break
the code we have to look closely at
Brian De Palma's career. For seven
years (1974 to 1981) De Palma
turned out one extraordinary picture
after another (with the single excep
tion of "Obsession"), but very few
critics or devoted filmgoers took him
seriously. His rock musical send-up of
"The Phantom of the Opera" and
"Faust," "The Phantom of the
Paradise," was extravagantly witty,
but it was roundly ignored, while
"The Rocky Horror Picture Show,"
which looks anemic beside it, became
a cult favorite. "Carrie" was a box of
fice smash, but the press only grew
fond of it in retrospect, so that they
could use it as a club to beat his next
film, "The Fury," failing to notice
that he had done the same trick bril
liantly in both movies — transformed
cartoon-Gothic trash into the real
stuff of nightmares.
By the time he made "Dressed to
Kill" in 1980, he had become the pet
whipping boy of certain myopic
feminist critics who decided that any
male director who repeatedly showed
attractive women meeting violent
ends must be misogynistic (a tag no
one had ever dared to stick on Alfred
Hitchcock) and certain idolatrous

of the way and into a storage barn —
it's just a backdrop. And the last shot
is of a vampire in Rubin's movie
squeezing fake blood over the breasts
of a stand-in actress (a "body
double") in close-up. After "Blow
Out," in which he put himself on the
line, "Body Double" is a retreat, but
no one in movie history has ever
retreated as cannily or as merrily as
Brian De Palma. Loud as his laughter
is, though, it can't drown out the
sound of his bitterness as he denies
he's ever had anything to offer us
besides cheap, derivative thrills.
Brian De Palma's "Body Double"
begins, as his "Blow Out" did, with
an audience teaser. Behind the jokey
titles — thick blood drips down each
letter, leaving the tip deathly white —
the camera descends past a statue to a
tomb enclosing a vampire in glitter
rock garb, and as he comes into close
up, he turns and does a horror take
for us. The moonlit graveyard, the
mock De Chirico setting and the scare
are all fake, of course: We're watch
ing the filming of a schlock Gothic,
featuring a young actor named Jake
Scully (Craig Wasson) as the post
" Rocky Horror Picture Show" ghoul
and directed by a tough, no-nonsense
pro named Rubin (Dennis Franz,
who played the detective in "Dressed
to Kill" and the porno dealer in
"Blow Out"). The real horror begins
an instant later, when Jake, who suf-.
fers from claustrophobia, freezes in
the middle of the scene and has to be
hauled out of the coffin. His nerves
shot, Jake goes home early, only to
find his girlfriend (whose apartment
he shares) in bed with another man.
Jake moves in temporarily with a
bartender friend, but he feels his life
is on hold: He doesn't have a place of
his own, he no longer has a lover, and
his claustrophobia seems to have
placed a stranglehold on his work. In
acting class, he does a paralyzing
emotion memory exercise, reliving a
childhood game of hide and seek
when, hidden in a dark place, he got
too scared to move, and the acting
teacher's bullying tactics can't snap
him out of his fear. Another actor sit
ting in casually on the class, Sam
(Gregg Henry), is so outraged at the
instructor's insensitivity to the depth
of Jake's terror that he interrupts the
class and pulls Jake out of it, buying
him a drink to calm him down. Sam, it
turns out, has been called out of town
for a show and needs someone to take
over his house-sitting assignment, so
before he flies to Seattle he sets Jake
up in a breathtaking bachelor's pad
complete with rotating bed, satellite
dish and high-powered telescope.
And he lets Jake in on a voyeur's se
cret: a gorgeous brunette neighbor
who performs a mostly nude mastur
batory dance every night at the same
hour with her bedroom blinds wide
open. Feeling guilty and turned on at
the same time, Jake keeps watching,
but he sees more than he bargained
for — swinging the telescope around,
he discovers a second voyeur, an In
dian who, he begins to believe, means
to do his pretty neighbor some harm.
Brian De Palma's affection for
Alfred Hitchcock is well known. In
1976 he tried an hommage to
"Vertigo," "Obsession"; and
"Dressed to Kill," his most sheerly
entertaining murder mystery, is a series
of variations on "Psycho," with a
silent erotic chase scene in a museum
that derives from James Stewart's
pursuit of Kim Novak in the early
parts of "Vertigo." (The opening of
"Carrie" has connections to
"Psycho" as well, and "North by
Northwest" pops up in "The Fury.")
But De Palma has always used
Hitchcock as a starting-off point,
spinning audacious twists on classic
sequences and creating his own clas
sics, just as his best film, "Blow Out,"
is constructed on top of "Blow-Up"
and"The Conversation." So, recog
nizing the twin plots of "Rear Win
dow" and "Vertigo" in "Body
Double," we wait patiently for De
Palma to move beyond them to some
thing of his own, something riskier
and more complex and (based on our
expectations after "Blow Out") more
personal.
Meanwhile, we enjoy the seductive
elegance of his craftsmanship, be
cause after the debacle of last year's
"Scarface" (which, however, made
money for him), he's clearly in com
plete control again. One scene pat
terned closely on both "Vertigo" and
"Dressed to Kill" is a deluxe enter
tainment. Jake spots his neighbor,
Gloria (Deborah Shelton), in her car
and sees the Indian trailing her, so he

follows them both to a shopping mall.
Everything in the mall seems to be
encased in glass, including the
elevator, and the way De Palma
choreographs the sequence, we can
predict every step an instant before it
happens, so that it has a hal
lucinatory, deja vu quality. The
photographer, Stephen Burum, al
lows the sunlight to bleach out the
color just a trace, giving the whole
scene a dusted glow, and at one point
Jake and Gloria are riding together in
the elevator and he's about to warn
her about the Indian when the doors
oart and the sun pours in as a group
of shoppers intrudes on their privacy
— the sun, which we experience as a
visceral shock, is as much of an intru
sion as the shoppers are. A moment
later, the doors open again and Jake
sees the Indian standing outside the
elevator, his menacing gaze bearing
down on Jake but apparently un
noticed by anyone else. It's a glitter
ing optical illusion of a sequence, and
it could only have been perpetrated
by a master director.
But there's something unsettling
about De Palma's playfulness in
"Body Double," because for a long
time you can't figure out who's the
target of his joke or when he's going
to arrive at the punch line. He doesn't
draw on Hitchcock here; he reprises

him, tossing in bits from "Psycho"
and "Dial 'M' for Murder," too, and
paralleling "Rear Window" and
"Vertigo" for such long stretches that
his single-mindedness is bewildering.
The only significant difference be
tween Hitchcock's version and De
Palma's is that De Palma's characters
get into much deeper and messier
trouble — the inevitable murder is
much more grisly (and nerve
wracking) than anything we see in
"Vertigo" or "Rear Window," and
the plot takes Jake into the under
ground world of pornography, where
he encounters an actress named Holly
Body, the star of a number of X-rated
films. (Even the casting of Melanie
Griffith, who gives a charmingingly
unaffected performance as Holly, is
loaded: Her mother is Tippi Hedren,
the Hitchcock discovery who played
leading roles in "The Birds" and
"Marnie.") And that's not all: De
Palma hacks pieces from his own
movies, too (chiefly " Dressed to Kill"
and "Blow Out," but also "Carrie,"
"Obsession," "The Fury," "Phantom
of the Paradise" and even
"Scarface") and throws them at us
like severed limbs, cut off from the
dramatic logic and thematic unity of
these pictures so that they no longer
make sense except as parody.
De Palma is far too sophisticated a
director to have mimicked Hitchcock
by accident, particularly at this point
in his career, and the care with which
he has assembled "Body Double" in
all other respects (he even gets fairly
good work out of Craig Wasson,
whose acting is normally beyond the
pale) contradicts the immediate
transparency and increasing im
plausibility of the plot. (You don't
have to have seen "Vertigo" to un
derstand how to interpret the nar
rative undercurrents.) No, De Palma
evidently wants us to see what he's up
to, stylistically and in plot terms, and
he wants us to identify his sources and
register how little he's moved beyond
them. Why?

There's a message for us in "Body
Double," but it's coded, and to break
the code we have to look closely at
Brian De Palma's career. For seven
years (1974 to 1981) De Palma
turned out one extraordinary picture
after another (with the single excep
tion of "Obsession"), but very few
critics or devoted filmgoers took him
seriously. His rock musical send-up of
"The Phantom of the Opera" and
"Faust," "The Phantom of the
Paradise," was extravagantly witty,
but it was roundly ignored, while
"The Rocky Horror Picture Show,"
which looks anemic beside it, became
a cult favorite. "Carrie" was a box of
fice smash, but the press only grew
fond of it in retrospect, so that they
could use it as a club to beat his next
film, "The Fury," failing to notice
that he had done the same trick bril
liantly in both movies — transformed
cartoon-Gothic trash into the real
stuff of nightmares.
By the time he made "Dressed to
Kill" in 1980, he had become the pet
whipping boy of certain myopic
feminist critics who decided that any
male director who repeatedly showed
attractive women meeting violent
ends must be misogynistic (a tag no
one had ever dared to stick on Alfred
Hitchcock) and certain idolatrous
auteur critics who slapped him down

for imitating Hitchcock (as though no
artist before De Palma had ever
reflected the work of an earlier art
ist). Again, "Dressed to Kill" was a
box office champion — which only
fueled the fire of his detractors, who
could now claim he was pandering to
his audiences by serving up all the sex
and violence they craved.
Then came "Blow Out," which
should have been universally
recognized as De Palma's
breakthrough. In this thriller about
how a movie sound man (beautifully
played by John Travolta) witnesses a
murder and uncovers a political con
spiracy, the hero was as close to the
director himself as the Harvey Keitel
character in "Mean Streets" was to
Martin Scorsese, and his growing hor
ror at the way everyone he encoun
tered turned a deaf ear to the implica
tions of the incident rang out with ur
gency. In "Blow Out," De Palma fi
nally abandoned Fantasyland,
employing his astonishing gifts for
sounding the depths of a nightmare to
address an important issue; the movie
was a contemporary American
tragedy that deserved to be discussed
alongside "The Conversation"
(which it superseded) and the
"Godfather" pictures and
"Nashville." But mostly one heard
complaints that it wasn't as suspense
ful as "Dressed to Kill" (which is a
little like saying that "The Godfat
her" wasn't as exciting as "Public
Enemy"), that it copied "The Con
versation" and "Blow-Up," that once
again that vile woman hater Brian De
Palma was murdering off his female
characters.
De Palma took another critical
flogging for "Scarface," which really
was an awful picture — but not for
the reasons one kept hearing. It
wasn't another blood-and-guts ex
travaganza from a garish purveyor of
violence; the problem was that it was
sluggish and redundant and over
stated. (Those who shied away from

the violence never answered the
question De Palma, along with other
major filmmakers like Arthur Penn,
Sam Peckinpah, Francis Coppola and
Martin Scorsese, have been asking for
almost two decades: How does a
filmmaker cope with the realities of
modern American society without in
troducing graphic violence.)
In "Body Double" De Palma turns
on his critics — and his audiences.
Okay, he seems to be saying, if you
think I'm just a Hitchcock imitator,
then that's what I'll be. If you think
all I can offer is mindless, sexy vio
lence, I'll smear the screen with it.

"Body Double" is a very disturbing
movie, but not because it's cheaply
manipulative (nothing in it is cheap)
or revealing of the director's deep
seated psychological problem (De
Palma is too shrewd to be easily psy
choanalyzed) or vacuous. Its very
emptiness is a hoax, since it spells out
a bulletin to the audience.
The ads for a horror cheapie in the
early 1970s read, "Keep repeating to
yourself, 'It's only a movie, it's only a
movie, it's only a movie ...' " but the
horrific endings of "Carrie" and " The
Fury" played hell with audiences who
wanted to distance themselves from
what they saw on the screen, and the
last scene in "Blow Out" was as
frightening a vision of life-as-extended
nightmare as any American director
has given us. In "Body Double" De

Palma reassures us, mockingly, that
those ads were right — he tells us
over and over again that we're watch
ing a movie. Early in the film (right
after the soundstage opening) he cuts
to a desert landscape, then rolls it out
of the way and into a storage barn —
it's just a backdrop. And the last shot
is of a vampire in Rubin's movie
squeezing fake blood over the breasts
of a stand-in actress (a "body
double") in close-up. After "Blow
Out," in which he put himself on the
line, "Body Double" is a retreat, but
no one in movie history has ever
retreated as cannily or as merrily as
Brian De Palma. Loud as his laughter
is, though, it can't drown out the
sound of his bitterness as he denies
he's ever had anything to offer us
besides cheap, derivative thrills.
