# De Palma shows arrogance, disrespect
## 
### AMY FRIEDMAN 
Columbia Pictures arranged a press junket on Brian
De Palma's new film, "Body Double," for representa
tives of college newspapers from the Bay Area, the Los
Angeles area and Arizona. For the five Bay Area
reporters, the junket began with a pre-paid flight to
Burbank where a driver and van from the Burbank
Studios met us.
At the studio 15 minutes later, we were shown into a
room adjacent to the main dining room of the commis
sary. Here we signed in, filled out a questionnaire and
helped ourselves to coffee. The five of us from the Bay
Area — Amy from San Jose State, John from the Uni
versity of California at Berkeley, Vernae from San
Francisco State, Tom from the University of San Fran
cisco, and myself — were the first ones there. We sat at
the tables set for lunch and talked about what we ex
pected the junket to be like and tried out names of
people we might know in common. When the 30 or so
other students had arrived, we helped ourselves to a
buffet lunch.
Between mouthfuls I learned that these people were
aspiring journalists with only a secondary interest in
film. This made me an exception. I am an aspiring
filmmaker. As a consequence I had more of an idea of
the actual process involved in filmmaking. I had
already been to Columbia and had had an insider's
tour, I had read "Indecent Exposure" which detailed
the David Begelman and Columbia Pictures scandal, I
had worked for a Hollywood producer, I had already

learned that profit is the bottom line in Hollywood
movie-making, I had seen the miracles of make-up, lo
cation cheating, creative editing and the like, but I had
never written for a college paper. And I wanted to do a
good job.
So I had my pen and pad out to jot down everything
remotely relevant to the article on the junket. After
dessert (marble cake), we made our way to a 100-seat
screening room. We settled in and the lights went off
for the movie. Afterwards, we were informed that De
Palma would be a little late for the question-and-an
swer session. Talking among ourselves outside the
screening room, the response to "Body Double" was
negative. The women were disappointed in the story
line, disturbed by the violence and offended by the
portrayal of women.
Back inside, De Palma had arrived and begun to an
swer questions. In response to the Motion Picture As
sociation of America ratings and in particular the trou
ble De Palma had trying to get an R-rating for his 1984
remake of "Scarface" (it was originally given an X
rating), De Palma likened himself to a "James Joyce of
the cinema." The questions quickly turned to the issue
of sexism in "Body Double." He answered by saying
that he wasn't making "any political statements" in the
film. He was merely interested in telling a good
suspense story and exploring the "cinematic forms"
like chases, which are unique to film. When asked why
the women were again the victims of men as in his

other films, and why they are again sexually motivated,
he replied that he is just giving a realistic depiction of
Hollywood life in "Body Double."
On his view of women, he said in the flippant tone he
set from the first, "I like women. I like to photograph
women. ... I like working with actresses." There was a
marked absence of respect on his part for anything
beyond the physical attributes of women and, more
specifically, beautiful and sensuous women. The ques
tions got more and more pointed as De Palma headed
off most of the questions with quips.
Although he was very pleased with the story which
he co-wrote with Robert Aurech, he seemed to take no
responsibility for any of the social or "political" impli
cations this particular audience (both male and female)
had garnered. Instead, he relied on his conviction that
as a "visual artist" the most important aspect of "Body
Double" was an appreciation of his experimentation
within his "cinematic grammar." This brought up
questions on the often noted similarity of his work with
Alfred Hitchcock's films. (In "Body Double" the
similarities included a violent shower scene, a
protagonist with debilitating claustrophobia and a
peeping-Tom theme.) De Palma was familiar enough
with Hitchcock's work to know when and when not his
own films were Hitchcock ripoffs. He failed to clarify if
this film was. Like Hitchcock, he felt that the suspense
genre lent itself particularly well to the film medium.
His enjoyment stemmed from "constructing visual se

quences," and he went on to suggest that it might be
good for filmmakers to go back to silent movie-making
where the story really had to be told visually.
I asked at that point if he thought he could make a
silent suspense film and achieve the same effect, be
cause it seemed to me that he relied quite a bit on
music and sound to set up the audience for a shock or a
laugh. He never really answered but agreed that sound
was important. Still he reiterated too many times that
he was a visual artist and offered this as an excuse for
any criticism of the appropriateness of his depiction of
women and violence.
Before leaving the screening room, De Palma
touched on his view of pornography — its purpose is
for people to "get their rocks off." He never expected
to get an academy award from the ultra-conservative
Academy, but that didn't particularly bother him be
cause Hitchcock and Kubrick never got one either. He
pointed out that "making movies is never fun," and
that, of course, he hopes people will go see "Body
Double."
I disliked "Body Double" and Brian De Palma, who
was arrogant and irresponsible. I quickly got rid of the
"Body Double poster each of us had been given,
throwing it in a garbage bin right there at Columbia
Pictures. Ihe poster showed a man peeping through a
window blind at a woman in a strapless dress clutching
her breast, chest and neck exposed, and head thrown
back.

beyond the physical attributes of women and, more
specifically, beautiful and sensuous women. The ques
tions got more and more pointed as De Palma headed
off most of the questions with quips.
Although he was very pleased with the story which
he co-wrote with Robert Aurech, he seemed to take no
responsibility for any of the social or "political" impli
cations this particular audience (both male and female)
had garnered. Instead, he relied on his conviction that
as a "visual artist" the most important aspect of "Body
Double" was an appreciation of his experimentation
within his "cinematic grammar." This brought up
questions on the often noted similarity of his work with
Alfred Hitchcock's films. (In "Body Double" the
similarities included a violent shower scene, a
protagonist with debilitating claustrophobia and a
peeping-Tom theme.) De Palma was familiar enough
with Hitchcock's work to know when and when not his
own films were Hitchcock ripoffs. He failed to clarify if
this film was. Like Hitchcock, he felt that the suspense
genre lent itself particularly well to the film medium.
His enjoyment stemmed from "constructing visual se

quences," and he went on to suggest that it might be
good for filmmakers to go back to silent movie-making
where the story really had to be told visually.
I asked at that point if he thought he could make a
silent suspense film and achieve the same effect, be
cause it seemed to me that he relied quite a bit on
music and sound to set up the audience for a shock or a
laugh. He never really answered but agreed that sound
was important. Still he reiterated too many times that
he was a visual artist and offered this as an excuse for
any criticism of the appropriateness of his depiction of
women and violence.
Before leaving the screening room, De Palma
touched on his view of pornography — its purpose is
for people to "get their rocks off." He never expected
to get an academy award from the ultra-conservative
Academy, but that didn't particularly bother him be
cause Hitchcock and Kubrick never got one either. He
pointed out that "making movies is never fun," and
that, of course, he hopes people will go see "Body
Double."
I disliked "Body Double" and Brian De Palma, who
was arrogant and irresponsible. I quickly got rid of the
"Body Double poster each of us had been given,
throwing it in a garbage bin right there at Columbia
Pictures. Ihe poster showed a man peeping through a
window blind at a woman in a strapless dress clutching
her breast, chest and neck exposed, and head thrown
back.
Columbia Pictures arranged a press junket on Brian
De Palma's new film, "Body Double," for representa
tives of college newspapers from the Bay Area, the Los
Angeles area and Arizona. For the five Bay Area
reporters, the junket began with a pre-paid flight to
Burbank where a driver and van from the Burbank
Studios met us.
At the studio 15 minutes later, we were shown into a
room adjacent to the main dining room of the commis
sary. Here we signed in, filled out a questionnaire and
helped ourselves to coffee. The five of us from the Bay
Area — Amy from San Jose State, John from the Uni
versity of California at Berkeley, Vernae from San
Francisco State, Tom from the University of San Fran
cisco, and myself — were the first ones there. We sat at
the tables set for lunch and talked about what we ex
pected the junket to be like and tried out names of
people we might know in common. When the 30 or so
other students had arrived, we helped ourselves to a
buffet lunch.
Between mouthfuls I learned that these people were
aspiring journalists with only a secondary interest in
film. This made me an exception. I am an aspiring
filmmaker. As a consequence I had more of an idea of
the actual process involved in filmmaking. I had
already been to Columbia and had had an insider's
tour, I had read "Indecent Exposure" which detailed
the David Begelman and Columbia Pictures scandal, I
had worked for a Hollywood producer, I had already

learned that profit is the bottom line in Hollywood
movie-making, I had seen the miracles of make-up, lo
cation cheating, creative editing and the like, but I had
never written for a college paper. And I wanted to do a
good job.
So I had my pen and pad out to jot down everything
remotely relevant to the article on the junket. After
dessert (marble cake), we made our way to a 100-seat
screening room. We settled in and the lights went off
for the movie. Afterwards, we were informed that De
Palma would be a little late for the question-and-an
swer session. Talking among ourselves outside the
screening room, the response to "Body Double" was
negative. The women were disappointed in the story
line, disturbed by the violence and offended by the
portrayal of women.
Back inside, De Palma had arrived and begun to an
swer questions. In response to the Motion Picture As
sociation of America ratings and in particular the trou
ble De Palma had trying to get an R-rating for his 1984
remake of "Scarface" (it was originally given an X
rating), De Palma likened himself to a "James Joyce of
the cinema." The questions quickly turned to the issue
of sexism in "Body Double." He answered by saying
that he wasn't making "any political statements" in the
film. He was merely interested in telling a good
suspense story and exploring the "cinematic forms"
like chases, which are unique to film. When asked why
the women were again the victims of men as in his

other films, and why they are again sexually motivated,
he replied that he is just giving a realistic depiction of
Hollywood life in "Body Double."
On his view of women, he said in the flippant tone he
set from the first, "I like women. I like to photograph
women. ... I like working with actresses." There was a
marked absence of respect on his part for anything
beyond the physical attributes of women and, more
specifically, beautiful and sensuous women. The ques
tions got more and more pointed as De Palma headed
