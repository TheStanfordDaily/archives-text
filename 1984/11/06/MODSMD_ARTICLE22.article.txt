# 'Tartuffe' stunning, unified drama

### BRADLEY RUBIDGE 
Geoffrey Proehl s production of Moliere's "Tartuffe" is
the finest play I have seen on campus in the last three
years. Finally, the lavish, professional sets and costumes
that are customary in the Drama Department's produc
tions at the Little Theater have been matched by a
thoroughly professional performance by a talented, well
disciplined cast.
Proehl s interpretation of this classic comedy contains
some interesting innovations and concludes with a bril
liant touch that 1 cannot give away. But he shows himself
to be a director of actors above all else. He has judged the

capacities of his troupe exactly and has adapted them all
to a unified view of how the play is to be performed, which
makes the humor of the drama consistently effective.
The reliability with which "Tartuffe" makes the audi
ence laugh is in part due to the choice of Richad Wilbur's
rhymed translation as the acting text. Do not think that
the couplets inhibit communication between audience and
players. If the actors had been directed to deemphasize
the verse in order to stress meaning and render emotions,
that might have been the case. Instead, Proehl has estab
lished an unusually high level of formality and artificiality
in this performance, and it works much better than many
plays where everything is sacrificed to "realism."
Comedy, more than most drama, is calculated to have
predictable effects upon its audience. Pronouncing
rhymed verse with care for its scansion is only one way in
which actors in a comedy can confess the artificiality of
their imitation. And by making this admission, they can
draw the audience in as co-conspirators and thereby con
trol our responses not only more reliably but with more
willingness from us.
Taking this approach has made it possible for Proehl to
introduce some extremely broad effects which could seem
like gross buffoonery in a production that strove for
"naturalness." Here they are not out of place. Some physi
cal comedy that is not in the text is brought off with
remarkable tact and finesse, especially during Dorine's at
tempt to reconcile the lovers Valere and Mariane and in
the temptation of the hypocrite Tartuffe by Elmire.
The story is probably familiar. Tartuffe, a parasite, puts
on airs of devoutness in order to gain the favor and
patronage of the gullible Orgon. The members of Orgon's
family see through Tartuffe's hypocrisy but cannot dis
suade Orgon from his admiration. He makes plans to

break the engagement of his daughter Mariane to Valere
and marry her to Tartuffe. When Tartuffe propositions
Orgon's wife, Elmire, and is decried by her son Damis,
Orgon refuses to believe them. He disinherits his son and
makes over his own estate to Tartuffe. The resolution of
these difficulties is intricate, but lively.
Robert Dinner, as Orgon, gives a remarkable perfor
mance which preserves the calculated formality I
remarked on above while creating a lifelike and many
sided character of persuasive reality. Awetu Simesso is the
only other actor who depicts a really complete charac
ter. His Tartuffe is splendidly wicked and can turn from
his hypocritical pretenses to expressions of lust and anger
that are wholly convincing. But Tartuffe is not called upon
to produce responses in the audience (such as laughter)
that would permit us to feel that an actor was consciously
evoking them. Though Simesso displays great talent as a
naturalistic actor, the script does not give him the oppor
tunity to blend naturalism with artifice the way Dinner
does.
Terra Vandergaw, who plays the maid Dorine, is at the
head of the actors who sacrifice developing a character to
the comic exigencies of the script. Her part is so funny,
and she so deft in it, that I feel no loss that there is no per
sonality behind Dorine's actions. Andrew Barr, as Valere,
and Alison Mockett, as Mariane, have similarly adapted
their expressions of motivation and feeling to produce as
many laughs as possible. The combination of these three
in a long scene in act two is the play's humorous high
point.
Proehl has handled the rest of the cast well. Weik Kruit
wagen gives a vigorous rendering of Orgon's mother, and
Polly Firestone, as Orgon's wife Elmire, is learning to do
more with her splendid profile. Peter Morgan, as Orgon's

son Damis, is the one actor who seems to have resisted di
rection. I cannot imagine Proehl would have encouraged
his constant fist-clenching and bouncing up and down.
The cast works well together, and one feels that this is a
true ensemble production with a unified approach and
definite purpose. The handsome set and stunning (though
perhaps a bit too ingenious) costumes provide the finish
ing touches to an extraordinary production. "Tartuffe"
runs at the Little Theater through Nov. 10, and
should not be missed by anyone interested in serious
theater or hearty laughter.
