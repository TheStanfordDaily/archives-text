# London Philharmonic plays Davies
## Maestro Tennstedt captures Beethoven's symphonic moods 
### RICHARD NAGAREDA 
Last Sunday evening in Davies
Symphony Hall, Klaus Tennstedt
amply demonstrated why he has
become the darling of the interna
tional music scene over the past de
cade. In his concert with his own
London Philharmonic, Maestro Ten
nstedt displayed his fabled ability to
inject new life into hackneyed ele
ments of the orchestral repertoire.
Upon viewing the advertisements
for last Sunday's concert, a casual
classical buff would likely have asked:
Who is Klaus Tennstedt? Unlike
Leonard Bernstein, James Levine
and Zubin Mehta, the 58-year-old
conductor has had little exposure in
the American mass media; indeed, he
has yet to appear in PBS' "Great Per
formances" television series. Con
certgoers in Boston and New York as
well as record collectors worldwide
nonetheless have come to know the
maestro through his exceptional live
performances and recordings of the
Mahler symphonies.
Having spent a substantial portion
of his career in East Germany, Ten
nstedt remained largely insulated
from the process of homogenization
that has permeated the musical
academies of the West. For this rea
son, he seems less influenced by the
slashing, literal style of Arturo Tos
canini (the paragon for so many of
today's conductors) than by the more
subjective, romantic approach of the
German school — a style typified by
the late conductor of the Berlin Phil
harmonic, Wilhelm Furtwangler.
Tennstedt left East Germany in 1971
and burst upon the Western musical
scene in a series of concerts with the
Boston Symphony in 1974. Far from
attempting to imitate a single legen
dary conductor of the past, Tennstedt
has cultivated his own identifiable

style — one with an emphasis on
tonal beauty over pure textual ac
curacy and one which demands that
individual members of the orchestra
perform with a chamber-like at
tentiveness to the playing of their
peers.
Tennstedt displayed all of these
qualities in his reading of Beetho
ven's Symphony No. 3. Thanks in
part to "Hooked on Classics" (a
dubious advancement in the history
of Western culture), the major works
of Beethoven have assumed an übiq
uitous place in the popular mind.
Given this state of affairs, we all too
often lose sight of what an awe
inspiring achievement the "Eroica"
Symphony truly is. Even today, the
idea of composing a work to surpass
the utter perfection of Mozart's
"Jupiter" Symphony seems an almost
impossible task. With the two blister
ing chords that open the "Eroica,"
Beethoven shattered the classical
symphonic tradition of the 18th cen
tury and simultaneously anticipated
the Romantic movement which was
to follow him. In terms of harmonic
development, emotional content and
sheer length, the "Eroica"
represented a critical turning point in
the history of music.
In the opening movement, Ten
nstedt eschewed the modern ten
dency to conduct the vast
developmental section of the sym
phony at a breakneck pace. Although
the Maestro did not communicate the
sense of architectonic grandeur so tel
lingly exposed by Furtwangler, his
reading was typified by unusually del
icate and pointed string playing by
the London ensemble.
The mighty Funeral March of the
second movement represented the
high point of the evening as Ten
nstedt coaxed exquisite form from the

violins and lower strings. High praise
should go to oboist Gareth Hulse for
his brooding account of the principal
melody and to Nicholas Busch, who
appropriately phrased the climactic
horn solo in a single, arching breath.
Unlike so many contemporary per
formances, this one conveyed a
genuine sense of tragedy and emo
tional exhaustion. Unlike so many
conductors, Tennstedt did not pres

ent the latter part of the movement as
a mere afterthought. Instead, he
infused the music with a floating,
mystical quality which alerted lis
teners to the spiritual connection be
tween Beethoven and Anton
Bruckner.
Tennstedt succeeded in capturing
the varying moods of the symphony's
four sections. Nowhere was this more
apparent than in the third movement

where he underlined the playful,
chirp-like melodies of the score. Even
from the first tier, it was obvious that
the maestro thoroughly enjoyed the
musical merriment.
In the concluding fourth move
ment, Tennstedt effectively brought
out the fugue and variation measures
critical to the organization of the
symphony. Here, I was struck by a
clarity of orchestration usually associ

ated with Mozart, yet I also noted the
clipped phrases of the violins reminis
cent of Mahler's Symphony No. 4;
Tennstedt thus placed the "Eroica"
in the context of its musical past and
futuie. If it is possible to "hear" his
tory in the form of a single work, I
had the pleasure of doing so because
of Tennstedt.
The maestro appropriately
prefaced his performance of the Bee
thoven work with two short or
chestral showpieces. In Weber's
"Oberon" Overture, the orchestra
captured the romantic mood of the
work to which the composer alludes,
Shakespeare's "A Midsummer
Night's Dream." Richard Strauss'
tone poem "Don Juan" left a good
deal to be desired, however. Apart
from another beautiful oboe solo,
Tennstedt failed to negotiate the
work's problematic transitions and, at
several points, simply allowed the or
chestra to be too loud. Strauss' treac
herous composition also underscored
a deficiency in the London Philhar
monic brass section.
One can only speculate on how
Tennstedt might have brought off
these works — particularly the
"Eroica" — with the assistance of
one of the world's superhuman or
chestras. Those who wish to sample
this conductor's exceptional skills
would be well-served by his recent
digital recording of Schubert's Ninth
Symphony with the phenomenal Ber
lin Philharmonic. Indeed, with the
72-year-old Herbert von Karajan in
increasingly poor health, one can
easily speculate on the prospects for a
German conductor with the rare in
sights and abilities of Klaus Ten
nstedt. Let us hope that he will make
music for many years to come.

canini (the paragon for so many of
today's conductors) than by the more
subjective, romantic approach of the
German school — a style typified by
the late conductor of the Berlin Phil
harmonic, Wilhelm Furtwangler.
Tennstedt left East Germany in 1971
and burst upon the Western musical
scene in a series of concerts with the
Boston Symphony in 1974. Far from
attempting to imitate a single legen
dary conductor of the past, Tennstedt
has cultivated his own identifiable

style — one with an emphasis on
tonal beauty over pure textual ac
curacy and one which demands that
individual members of the orchestra
perform with a chamber-like at
tentiveness to the playing of their
peers.
Tennstedt displayed all of these
qualities in his reading of Beetho
ven's Symphony No. 3. Thanks in
part to "Hooked on Classics" (a
dubious advancement in the history
of Western culture), the major works
of Beethoven have assumed an übiq
uitous place in the popular mind.
Given this state of affairs, we all too
often lose sight of what an awe
inspiring achievement the "Eroica"
Symphony truly is. Even today, the
idea of composing a work to surpass
the utter perfection of Mozart's
"Jupiter" Symphony seems an almost
impossible task. With the two blister
ing chords that open the "Eroica,"
Beethoven shattered the classical
symphonic tradition of the 18th cen
tury and simultaneously anticipated
the Romantic movement which was
to follow him. In terms of harmonic
development, emotional content and
sheer length, the "Eroica"
represented a critical turning point in
the history of music.
In the opening movement, Ten
nstedt eschewed the modern ten
dency to conduct the vast
developmental section of the sym
phony at a breakneck pace. Although
the Maestro did not communicate the
sense of architectonic grandeur so tel
lingly exposed by Furtwangler, his
reading was typified by unusually del
icate and pointed string playing by
the London ensemble.
The mighty Funeral March of the
second movement represented the
high point of the evening as Ten
nstedt coaxed exquisite form from the

violins and lower strings. High praise
should go to oboist Gareth Hulse for
his brooding account of the principal
melody and to Nicholas Busch, who
appropriately phrased the climactic
horn solo in a single, arching breath.
Unlike so many contemporary per
formances, this one conveyed a
genuine sense of tragedy and emo
tional exhaustion. Unlike so many
conductors, Tennstedt did not pres

ent the latter part of the movement as
a mere afterthought. Instead, he
infused the music with a floating,
mystical quality which alerted lis
teners to the spiritual connection be
tween Beethoven and Anton
Bruckner.
Tennstedt succeeded in capturing
the varying moods of the symphony's
four sections. Nowhere was this more
apparent than in the third movement

where he underlined the playful,
chirp-like melodies of the score. Even
from the first tier, it was obvious that
the maestro thoroughly enjoyed the
musical merriment.
In the concluding fourth move
ment, Tennstedt effectively brought
out the fugue and variation measures
critical to the organization of the
symphony. Here, I was struck by a
clarity of orchestration usually associ

ated with Mozart, yet I also noted the
clipped phrases of the violins reminis
cent of Mahler's Symphony No. 4;
Tennstedt thus placed the "Eroica"
in the context of its musical past and
futuie. If it is possible to "hear" his
tory in the form of a single work, I
had the pleasure of doing so because
of Tennstedt.
The maestro appropriately
prefaced his performance of the Bee
thoven work with two short or
chestral showpieces. In Weber's
"Oberon" Overture, the orchestra
captured the romantic mood of the
work to which the composer alludes,
Shakespeare's "A Midsummer
Night's Dream." Richard Strauss'
tone poem "Don Juan" left a good
deal to be desired, however. Apart
from another beautiful oboe solo,
Tennstedt failed to negotiate the
work's problematic transitions and, at
several points, simply allowed the or
chestra to be too loud. Strauss' treac
herous composition also underscored
a deficiency in the London Philhar
monic brass section.
One can only speculate on how
Tennstedt might have brought off
these works — particularly the
"Eroica" — with the assistance of
one of the world's superhuman or
chestras. Those who wish to sample
this conductor's exceptional skills
would be well-served by his recent
digital recording of Schubert's Ninth
Symphony with the phenomenal Ber
lin Philharmonic. Indeed, with the
72-year-old Herbert von Karajan in
increasingly poor health, one can
easily speculate on the prospects for a
German conductor with the rare in
sights and abilities of Klaus Ten
nstedt. Let us hope that he will make
music for many years to come.

Last Sunday evening in Davies
Symphony Hall, Klaus Tennstedt
amply demonstrated why he has
become the darling of the interna
tional music scene over the past de
cade. In his concert with his own
London Philharmonic, Maestro Ten
nstedt displayed his fabled ability to
inject new life into hackneyed ele
ments of the orchestral repertoire.
Upon viewing the advertisements
for last Sunday's concert, a casual
classical buff would likely have asked:
Who is Klaus Tennstedt? Unlike
Leonard Bernstein, James Levine
and Zubin Mehta, the 58-year-old
conductor has had little exposure in
the American mass media; indeed, he
has yet to appear in PBS' "Great Per
formances" television series. Con
certgoers in Boston and New York as
well as record collectors worldwide
nonetheless have come to know the
maestro through his exceptional live
performances and recordings of the
Mahler symphonies.
Having spent a substantial portion
of his career in East Germany, Ten
nstedt remained largely insulated
from the process of homogenization
that has permeated the musical
academies of the West. For this rea
son, he seems less influenced by the
slashing, literal style of Arturo Tos
canini (the paragon for so many of
