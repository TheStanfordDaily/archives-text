# 'Firstborn' most shameless sop
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG Daily staff 
"Firstborn" (written by Ron Koslow, directed by Mi
chael Apted) is the most shameless sop to the teenage au
dience since "Risky Business." In it, Jake, a high-school
kid (Christopher Collet, whose perfect Young Republican
looks admit no possibility of a rough edge or two) has the
wisdom to see what his divorcee mother, Wendy (Teri
Ciarr, who doesn't look like a Wendy) cannot: that the guy
she's living with, Sam (Peter Weller), is a no-good dope
dealing loser, and that his vices have infected her and
wrecked their home. ("Mom, you're a cokehead, aren't
you?" Jake asks her in the movie's silliest scene. She
denies it, of course, but she wanders around the living
room sniffing and looking distracted.)
The only reason to see this lurid picture — aside from a
too-brief appearance by the talented actress Sarah Jessica

Parker, as Jake's girlfriend — is Peter Weller, who makes
it clear that Sam's real power over Wendy is sexual. Wel
ler has a profoundly disturbing closet-psychotic presence
(he toned it down for "The Adventures of Buckaroo Ban
zai"); he looks so bone-deep degenerate that you easily
believe him capable of any excess — but you also under
stand why Wendy won't throw him out of her bed. When
Jake insults him by herding his friends out of the house
when he discovers Sam's home, Weller's chillingly clear
eyes register pain and then anger the way a wild animal's
might. And later, when Sam has trapped the whole family
(including a younger brother, played by Corey Haim) by
his sheer physical strength, Weller has a quiet scene with
Christopher Collet that makes you sick with fear. Sam is
essentially an extension of his role as Diane Keaton's
lover in "Shoot the Moon," but Weller turns it into a dis
play of fiercely intense underplaying in the best Robert
Mitchum tradition.
