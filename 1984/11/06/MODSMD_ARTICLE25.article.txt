# Ram's Head 'Shrew' too ambitious
## 
### KARY ANTHOLIS 
Ram's Head, Stanford's largest
theatrical society, produces a
Shakespearean play each fall. I imag
ine that seems a prestigious ac
complishment for the members of the
company. In fact, it is an overam
bitious tradition, and the effort would
be better spent on less challenging
pieces which could be handled by the
level of talent at Stanford.
This year's Shakespearean produc
tion is "The Taming of the Shrew," a
story of two sisters from Padua, Kat
herine and Bianca. Katherine is the
surly, angry shrew and Bianca is the
cute, well-behaved ingenue. Their fa
ther, Baptista, wants to marry them
off and finds many suitors for Bianca
but none willing to take on the task of
wooing Katherine. Petruccio of
Verona, however, comes forth and
accepts the challenge of taming the
headstrong Katherine.
Under David Kudler's direction,
the Ram's Head interpretation is at
times imaginative but ultimately shal
low and silly. Darrel Wilson's set is a
bare stage with a few black cubes and
a picture of Padua projected on a
screen over the actors' heads. The ac
tors are dressed in street clothing of
today's world (i.e., Levi jeans). The
overall effect is that of a bunch of stu
dents performing some skits to amuse
their friends.
Most of the acting continues in this
vein. Consequently, two of Bianca's
suitors, Hortensio (Noam Maitless)
and Gremio (Mace Perlman) become
caricatures of the parts which they
play. Maitless plays Hortensio as a
preppy who pesters Bianca with gifts
and flattery; Perlman's Gremio is a
frail old whiner who tries to woo
Bianca through Baptista. Unfortun
ately, neither depiction gets beyond a
superficial level.
The heart of "Taming of the
Shrew" is the relationship between

Petruchio and Katherine. Petruchio
(Mike Weis) tries to domesticate Kath
erine (Lisa Grabemann) through
physical and emotional domination.
Director Kudler interprets this rela
tionship by setting an angry, sadistic
woman against a macho leather
jacketed thug. The interpretation is
interesting in that it illuminates the
physical nature of their relationship.
The problem, however, is that
there are not too many thugs who can
speak in Shakespearean verse. Both
Grabemann and Weis try to internalize
these roles in an attempt at "method
acting" which is simply not Shake
speare.
Essential to any successful produc
tion of Shakespeare is the actors' sen
sitivity to the language. Only one
member of this cast shows such care.
Michael Alves, who plays Bianca s
successful suitor, Lucentio, allows his
lines to shape his performance, rather
than trying to cram the lines into his
conception of the role. As a result, his
Lucentio is romantic and charming,
and his performance is solid.
Not essential to any successful pro
duction of Shakespeare is the casting
of two male roles with women. Holly
Urban plays Tranio, Lucentio's ser
vant, and Karen Fricker is Baptista.
Of course, males played female role
in Shakespeare's time, and sex rever
sals in today's times may be effective
— but only if they serve a clear inter
pretational purpose. In this case it
simply confuses the audience, the plot
and the characters. We get little sense
of Baptista's fatherly egotism or
Tranio's loyal service.
Since "The Taming of the Shrew"
ended Sunday, this critic's warning is
aimed not at the audience, but at
Ram's Head. A line from a famous
play runs thus: "I have no spur/To
prick the sides of my intent, but
only/Vaulting ambition which o'er
leaps itself . . (Guess who?)
