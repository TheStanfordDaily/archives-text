# Weak script undermines' Tintypes'
## 
### KARY ANTHOLIS 
Lately, we have heard much talk
about America as a land of the
plutocrat and the populist. The
plutocrat promotes the veneer of how
good things are, while the populist
yearns to expose injustice faced by
the common man. It is a theme which
runs through American history and
which infuses much of our popular
culture. Today, Hall and Oates sing
escapism, while Grand Master Flash
raps of the inner-city jungle. At the
turn of the century, Anna Held sang
the escapist tunes, while Bert Wil
liams wrote about "Nothin' Comin'
In."

The modern ear
can only take so
much of 'Aye,
Lye, Lyer Lye.'

Theatre Works' "Tintypes" ex
plores this theme in the music of the
early 1900s.
The problem with any anthology of
American popular music is that much
of it is trendy and can only be appre
ciated within the contemporary con
text. And this is a problem which
"Tintypes" does not overcome. Ex
cept for a few blues tunes and several
George Cohan anthems, the produc
tion is uninspiring.
There are five principal characters
in "Tintypes." Teddy Roosevelt
(Erik Alenz) is the macho heroic
president, and Anna Held (Jennifer
Adams) is the seductive vaudeville
showgirl. Between songs there are
skits which illustrate that these char

acters represent the privileged slice of
American life. Alenz and Adams
have pleasant voices, and their per
formances capture the romantic
naivete of the age. But they are
working with weak material.
The Cohan songs — "You're a
Grand Old Flag" and"The Yankee
Doodle Boy" — are rousing. Unfor
tunately, most of the music reflecting
the life of the plutocrats is tiresome.
Ballads such as "Meet Me in St.
Louis" and"The Maiden with
Dreamy Eyes" occur too frequently
to keep the audience interested.
Three of the characters represent
the working classes. Emma Goldman
(Kathy Burch) is the fiery socialist. In
one scene she attacks Teddy
Roosevelt in a manner reminiscent of
a certain vice-presidential candidate.
Charlie (Dennis Hart) is the strug
gling immigrant who faces hard times
with naive courage. Burch and Hart
are charming in their respective roles,
but again a modern ear can only take
so much of "Aye, Lye, Lyer Lye" and
"Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless
Child."
The highlight of the evening is pro
vided by Renee Lubin, who plays the
black songstress, Susannah. Lubin
has a tremendous voice, and her soul
ful rendition of the blues ("Nobody")
gives the musical a much-needed
emotional dimension.
The direction of Robert Kelly and
Barbara Valente is insensitive to the
dry nature of the script. They seem to
have drilled the actors in blocking
and choreography while neglecting
the task of making the show enjoy
able. The result is a group of techni
cally solid performances with little
life and emotion.
"Tintypes" plays at the Lucie Stern
Theater in Palo Alto through Satur
day.
