## Dave Dutcher Super lights for the Super Bowl 
### 
For many, Saturday was a dark
day on the football field. The
Stanford football team had a good
chance to beat USC for more than
three quarters and lost the chance
in the fourth period because of
turnovers and a missed field goal.
But during the Cardinal's 20-11
loss, it was also dark — literally.
Once afternoon became evening
Saturday, the four portable light
fixtures at Stanford Stadium didn't
light the field well. I watched the
game from two locations, and the
middle of the field was clearly
visible. However, from the 15-
yard lines on both sides of the
field, it was quite dark.
According to Jim Steeg, director
of special events for the National
Football League, plans call for
three more sets of lights for Super
Bowl XIX on Jan. 20. "It was
different (Saturday) than it'll be
for the Super Bowl," Steeg said.
I hope so. Even from the
sidelines, it wasn't outrageously
dark, but it was too dark for a
major college football game to be
played.
In fact, one Stanford player I
spoke to this weekend said it
seemed dark during the late part
of the game Saturday. But be
assured that the NFL, Stanford
and anyone else involved will
make sure there is plenty of light
for ABC's television audience
during the Super Bowl.

That's because advertising reve
nue incites action, and what dis
turbs me about this is it makes Sat
urday's game seem like a minor
league affair, despite the fact that
one team is not out of considera
tion for a bowl bid and the other
might win the conference champi
onship next week.
The University of Arizona, the
Cardinal's opponent Saturday in
Tucson, has the Pacific 10 Confer
ence's second-best defense. The
Wildcats are first in the Pac-10 in
rushing defense, and that'll be a
consideration to Stanford, espe
cially since the Cardinal attempted
to run against USC, which ranks
second in rushing defense among
Pac-10 teams. By the way, Stan
ford had 65 yards rushing against
USC.
I'm still wondering about the
decision to start John Paye at
quarterback Saturday. If you want
more passing offense than before,
you want Paye calling signals.
However, if you want to "come
out and move on the ground," as
Elway said was the plan against
USC, it would've been preferable
to start Fred Buckley, who has
thrown 14 interceptions in six
games. Paye threw four incom
plete passes before injuring a
finger, and Stanford attempted no
passes in the first quarter.
