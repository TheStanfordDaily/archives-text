## Card to play unpredictable 49ers 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
After a six-day break, the No. 1-
ranked Stanford women's volleyball
team will resume WCAA play with a
match at Cal State Long Beach
tonight.
In order to defeat the 49ers, 2-7 in
the Western Collegiate Athletic As
sociation, Stanford must "dictate the
action throughout the match," Car
dinal Asst. Coach Don Shaw said.
"They will play really, really well at
times," Shaw said. "We just can't let
them get hot for a long period."
Long Beach's hot streaks have
caught Stanford unaware on several
occasions. In the teams' first meeting
on Oct. 12, Stanford lost the third
game before winning the match in
four games. The Cardinal was also
quickly beaten, 15-3, in the first game
of a match against Long Beach last
season.
Another problem for the Cardinal,
12-2 overall and 9-1 in the WCAA,

will be playing on Long Beach's home
court, acccording to Shaw. "They're
gym is very closed in," he said. "Cal
State (Long Beach) also plays well at
home. They are more comfortable
with the surroundings, and it gives
them an advantage."
What the 49ers have lacked in the
past, Shaw said, is confidence. "They
have a couple of good players, but
they just haven't been able to get the
wins . .
Heading the 49ers' list of good
players is setter LeValley Pattison, a
5-foot-6 junior from Manhattan
Beach. Her court sense in knowing
the optimum set in a given situation is
excellent, according to Shaw.
Long Beach might have gained
some confidence last weekend when
it won the University of Nevada
Sunkist Invitational Tournament in
Las Vegas. The tournament "shows
they are definitely capable of playing
well," Shaw said. "We just want to go
down there and win."
