### MARK BEYREIS Staff writer 
Speakers in yesterday's "Reaganbusting"
rally criticized the Reagan administration and
called on an audience of about 200 to donate its
time to help in today's general election.
Democratic congressional candidate Martin
Carnoy, the keynote speaker, focused on
dangers to the environment and world peace.
He said the companies involved in expansion in
the Silicon Valley "don't feel they have to do
anything to protect the people."
"We should expand, but we should expand in
a way that will make sure that people can live in
America,"he added.
"I am against using nuclear weapons for bar
gaining chips. This is not 'Monopoly' we're
playing. There's something more at stake,"
Carnoy said.
"Believe it or not there are people outside of
Stanford. And when I see families with little
children, there is one issue: Are those kids going
to have a world to grow up in?"
Arlen Gregorio, a Democratic candidate for
the state senate, said the major election issues
deal with the future of the country.
He compared President Reagan to California
Governor George Deukmejian. "If you think
Ronald Reagan is an enemy of the environment
you haven't met George Deukmejian yet,"
Gregorio said.
Gregorio also said there were only 14 Repub
lican seats in the state senate, the minimum
number that that Deukmejian needs to protect
the govenor's veto. Because his is the only

closely-contested senate race, the defeat of Re
publican incumbent Becky Morgan means
Gregorio would hold the "key vote in over
riding the veto," he said.
Deukmejian "is wrong on the environment.
He is wrong on education. He has cut vital funds

to fight toxic substances in the workplaces and
in our neighborhoods," Gregorio said.
"My opponent supports the governor," he
added.
Gregorio said because his race is so close
"maybe one vote per precinct is going to make
the difference in determining whether we can


Arlen Gregorio
deal from strength with Gov. Deuk-

mejian for the next two years."
Steve Phillips, who was a delegate
from the Rev. Jesse Jackson's Rain

bow Coalition and is currently a
leader of Students Against
Reaganism, said, "Give peace a
chance and give Reagan the ranch."
