# Week of Oct. 29-Nov. 4
## Police Blotter 
### 
An unknown party denuded another University structure of its identi
fication recently; a Stanford Bookstore employee reported missing this
week the brass letters spelling "Stanford" from the store s front wa .
Police estimate the four-inch letters to be worth $500, qualifying the
thief for a charge of grand theft. No one has yet returned the letters
spelling "Stanford Stadium" that were stolen over a week a g°-
more than two feet high, those letters could cost approximately $3,500
to replace.
The bookstore continued to have luck, however, in securing its prop
erty inside the building. Police cited Joseph Sanchez for shoplifting in
the bookstore on Nov. 1 at 4:50 p.m. The late afternoon remains the
preferred time for petty theft there, according to the past month s statis
tics.
Thieves nevertheless whisked wallets away with ease over the week. A
University employee discovered her wallet missing from an Encina Hall
work area during the morning of Oct. 29, while someone took the wallet
from the purse of a student in Green Library later that afternoon. An
other student left some traveler's checks in an Old Union restroom
around 8:30 a.m. on Oct. 30 but returned too late to recover them.
Police recorded a total of five counts of petty and one count of grand
theft last week
The cycle of bike thefts intensified recently. Of the 12 cases reported
to the Stanford Police, two each occurred near Toyon and Florence
Moore residences. Thieves also struck near Bldg. 380, El Toro Eating
Club, Forsythe, Green Library, Meyer Library and Jordan Quad. The
most popular time for bicycle-napping proved to be in the afternoon,
with the morning hours second choice. Only one student listed overnight
as the probable time of the theft.
Police booked four people into jail for driving under the influence of
alcohol, with the majority of the incidents happening during a
weeknight. Dave Hamel was stopped for a California Vehicle Code
violation on Oct. 29 at 7:30 p.m. near Lomita and Mayfield Streets and
was taken to North County Jail, when police allegedly discovered he was
intoxicated. Thomas Diamond also went to North County Jail for DUI;
police apprehended him at 11:20 p.m. on Oct. 31 near El Camino Real
and California Ave. Much earlier that day — around 12:30 a.m. —
police officers had sent Brion and Patricia Applegate to Elmwood Jail,
he for allegedly driving while intoxicated and she for allegedly being in a
similar state and unable to care for herself. The officers stopped them
near El Camino Real and Quarry Road.
No residence or auto burglaries were reported last week. In all, police
made two felony and 15 misdemeanor arrests and served four warrants.
