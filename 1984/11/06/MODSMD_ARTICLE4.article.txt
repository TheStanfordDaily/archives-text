# Reagan trumpets past, pride, power

SACRAMENTO — In a final campaign
swing before today's election, President Reagan
returned to California's capital yesterday on
what aides called a "nostalgia trip."
"I may just bathe all of you in warm nostal
gia," Reagan told an estimated 15,000 people
who filled the two blocks in front of the capitol.
"Tm happy to be with old friends as we reach
the closing hours of the campaign."
But the president didn't reminisce long
before he went on the attack, urging his sup
porters to vote for Republican candidates and
accusing the Democratic leadership of living in
the past.
Republican campaign aides, fearing the cur
rent talk of a Reagan landslide could make any
thing less than a 50-state sweep seem a defeat,
said yesterday they expected the president
would prevail in 45 states today.
But Reagan warned his supporters yesterday
not to become complacent, reminding them of
Harry Truman's election-night upset of Thomas
Dewey.
"One word of caution," Reagan said. "Don t
pay attention to the polls. I looked up at Mt.
Rushmore, and I didn't see President Dewey s
face up there."
Reagan, flanked on the west steps of the
capitol by leading state Republicans, his wife
Nancy and singer Frank Sinatra, told the crowd
that "America is back, a giant on the scene.
And that is not debatable."
But, he said, a minority of Americans in
cluding a large group of vocal Mondale-Ferraro
supporters at the rally — wants the country to
return to the days of "torpor, timidity and taxes
... and some of those small voices came out
here in the sunlight today."

Reagan, calling his programs a "second
American revolution," credited his administra
tion with restoring American pride, cutting in
flation from 12 to 4 percent, turning around a
20-year decline in Scholastic Aptitude Test
scores, and not surrendering "one square inch
to communist aggression."
Mondale, on the other hand, has promised
everything to everyone with little chance of
delivering, Reagan said.
"If his proposals were a television program, it
would be 'Let's Make a Deal.' If his program
were a Broadway play, it would be 'Promises,
Promises.' And if it were a book, you'd have to
read it from back to front to have a happy end
ing," Reagan said.
These promises would cost $1,809 per Amer
ican household, Reagan said, creating the
equivalent of a second mortgage for most
homeowners. "That's more than $150 a month
... a Mondale mortgage.
"The American people don't want his taxes,"
Reagan said, "and they're not going to get
them."
Reagan pointed to his own tax cuts as proof
that he has been unfairly criticized by his Dem
ocratic challengers.
"Contrary to what some have been saying in
this campaign," Reagan said bitterly, his tax
cuts have been applied "across the board, with
no special favors to anyone."
At the end of the 20-minute speech, Reagan
directed his comments toward a core of
Mondale-Ferraro supporters who chanted
"Mondale, Mondale" through much of the
rally.
I m going to.say something to a certain little
group out there that I think will drive them up
