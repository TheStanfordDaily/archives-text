# Reagan trumpets past, pride, power

SACRAMENTO — In a final campaign
swing before today's election, President Reagan
returned to California's capital yesterday on
what aides called a "nostalgia trip."
"I may just bathe all of you in warm nostal
gia," Reagan told an estimated 15,000 people
who filled the two blocks in front of the capitol.
"Tm happy to be with old friends as we reach
the closing hours of the campaign."
But the president didn't reminisce long
before he went on the attack, urging his sup
porters to vote for Republican candidates and
accusing the Democratic leadership of living in
the past.
Republican campaign aides, fearing the cur
rent talk of a Reagan landslide could make any
thing less than a 50-state sweep seem a defeat,
said yesterday they expected the president
would prevail in 45 states today.
But Reagan warned his supporters yesterday
not to become complacent, reminding them of
Harry Truman's election-night upset of Thomas
Dewey.
"One word of caution," Reagan said. "Don t
pay attention to the polls. I looked up at Mt.
Rushmore, and I didn't see President Dewey s
face up there."
Reagan, flanked on the west steps of the
capitol by leading state Republicans, his wife
Nancy and singer Frank Sinatra, told the crowd
that "America is back, a giant on the scene.
And that is not debatable."
But, he said, a minority of Americans in
cluding a large group of vocal Mondale-Ferraro
supporters at the rally — wants the country to
return to the days of "torpor, timidity and taxes
... and some of those small voices came out
here in the sunlight today."

Reagan, calling his programs a "second
American revolution," credited his administra
tion with restoring American pride, cutting in
flation from 12 to 4 percent, turning around a
20-year decline in Scholastic Aptitude Test
scores, and not surrendering "one square inch
to communist aggression."
Mondale, on the other hand, has promised
everything to everyone with little chance of
delivering, Reagan said.
"If his proposals were a television program, it
would be 'Let's Make a Deal.' If his program
were a Broadway play, it would be 'Promises,
Promises.' And if it were a book, you'd have to
read it from back to front to have a happy end
ing," Reagan said.
These promises would cost $1,809 per Amer
ican household, Reagan said, creating the
equivalent of a second mortgage for most
homeowners. "That's more than $150 a month
... a Mondale mortgage.
"The American people don't want his taxes,"
Reagan said, "and they're not going to get
them."
Reagan pointed to his own tax cuts as proof
that he has been unfairly criticized by his Dem
ocratic challengers.
"Contrary to what some have been saying in
this campaign," Reagan said bitterly, his tax
cuts have been applied "across the board, with
no special favors to anyone."
At the end of the 20-minute speech, Reagan
directed his comments toward a core of
Mondale-Ferraro supporters who chanted
"Mondale, Mondale" through much of the
rally.

group out there that I think will drive them up

Winding up his re-election campaign in Sacramento yesterday, Presi
dent Reagan addresses a crowd of approximately 15,000 from the
steps of the state capitol.
the wall," Reagan said. "You ain't
seen nothing yet."
Reagan promised that four more
years of his administration would
mean a continuation of the first four,
and that he would lead a nation that
will "go for the gold and shoot for the
stars."
"If we could bring inflation from
12 to 4 percent, then we can bring it
down from four to zero-point-zero,
and we're going to do that," Reagan
pledged.
Returning to the state's capital for
the first time as president, Reagan
said California embodies the Ameri
can dream.
. "We came here for every opportu
nity that dream provides," he said,
and today's election "will keep that
dream alive."
Reagan told the young people in

the crowd that "their generation is
what this election is all about. And I
can tell you, your generation really
sparkles. Your idealism and love of
country is unsurpassed."
Although Reagan appeared on the
morning of a school day, many young
people were present at the rally, in
cluding fraternity members and
cheerleaders from California State
University at Sacramento who in
flated balloons before the rally and
led "Four More Years" cheers during
it; dozens of pre-school children who
waved American flags from a balcony
overhead; and a handful of young
musicians bussed to the rally by the
Reagan campaign after their high
school bands were prohibited from
playing by a last-minute court order.
The court decision came after
Mondale-Ferraro supporters
protested that Sacramento school of
ficials prevented high-school bands
from playing for President Carter in
1978 because they considered it then
an unacceptably partisan activity.
