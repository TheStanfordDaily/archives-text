# Grant to aid hearing work
## 
### JEANNE COOPER Senior staff writer 
Two Stanford professors received a research grant of al
most $1.8 million yesterday from the National Institutes
of Health (NIH) for their work on hearing.
F. Blair Simmons, professor of surgery/otolaryngology,
is the principal investigator in the award-winning cochlear
implant research conducted with Robert White, chairman
of the Department of Electrical Engineering.
"It was a nice surprise in the mail," Simmons said.
Noting that he and White are tenured professors, he said
the grant particularly benefits their research associates.
"Now they don't have to wait 18 months every three years
to see if their support will continue."
The cochlear implant attempts to substitute wire for the
30,000 hair cells lining the inner ear. Each hair cell
responds to a different range of sound and converts sound
transmitted from the middle ear to electrical pulses. White
directs work on the multichannel model while Simmons
concentrates on surgical implantation to test its effec
tiveness.
Simmons and White now hold the only federally ap
proved grant for research on humans in that area. "It (the
award) was really a vote of confidence," Simmons said.
"There's been a lot of political flak about research in this
area, because a lot has not been of high quality."
According to Simmons, the "outrageous claims" of
some researchers in hearing disorders "make everyone
pull in their horns, including the NIH." Simmons said,
"They (the NIH) have enough confidence in us to say,
I OK, don't come back for seven years.' "
According to Simmons, he and White submitted regular
research grant applications for competitive review for 13
years before winning the the Javits Neuroscience Inves
tigator award which guarantees seven years of support.
Designated by Congress, the Javits awards honor Jacob
Javits, a former New York senator now suffering from
Lou Gehrig's disease. Javits has a record of supporting
biomedical research, Simmons said.
