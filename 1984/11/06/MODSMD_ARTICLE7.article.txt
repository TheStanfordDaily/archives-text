Sandinistas claim election victory
MANAGUA, Nicaragua— Daniel Ortega, leader of the leftist Sandi
nista government and the party's presidential candidate, claimed victory
yesterday in the presidential election here and said the party is leading
by "an ample majority and an ample margin."
In Washington, the State Department denounced Nicaragua's election
results as a "farce" because the Sandinistas had no credible opposition.
Spokesman John Hughes said the Nicaraguan people were not
allowed to participate in "any real sense of the word. The Sandinista
electoral farce, without any meaningful political opposition, leaves the
situation essentially unchanged."
At midmorning, the Supreme Electoral Council said that with votes
from 16 percent of the polling sites counted, Ortega was leading with
68.1 percent of the vote. The remainder was split among candidates of
five small opposition parties.
The Electoral Council said percentages in voting for the national as
sembly were running at about the same percentage in favor of the Sandi
nistas as those for president.
Ortega told a news conference in Managua: "We take for a fact the
victory of the FSLN in these elections." He used the initials of the ruling
Sandinista National Liberation Front.
The main opposition coalition boycotted the election, complaining of
harassment and restrictions on campaigning and press coverage. In addi
tion to the Sandinistas, five minor parties took part in the election.
Bush woos Texas Republicans
DENTON, Texas — Vice President George Bush brought the
generously financed Republican coattails campaign to his adopted home
state yesterday as he stumped for three GOP candidates seeking to oust
incumbent House Democrats.
"For the people of Denton and the people of Texas, tomorrow is one
of the most important days in our country's history," Bush told more
than 2,000 cheering students at North Texas State University'. "I want to
be sure that the people of my home state go with Reagan, Bush, Gramm
and Armey."
Bush campaigned here for Richard Armey, who is posing a strong
challenge to popular freshman Rep. Tommy Vandegriff (D-Texas), as
part of the vice president's whirlwind tour of 21 congressional districts in
eight days. The effort has been aimed at converting President Reagan's
anticipated landslide into substantial Republican gains in the Democrat
controlled House.
Ron Kaufman, Bush's liaison from the Reagan-Bush campaign, said
the GOP is spending about $50,000 on television ads and direct-mail ap
peals aimed at wrapping the Reagan mantle around each of the 21 con
gressional candidates. Reagan is running about 30 points ahead of
Mondale in Texas, according to Kaufman. In 1980, he carried the dis
tricts with between 58 percent and 69 percent of the vote.
Bush also is campaigning in Texas for the Senate bid of Rep. Phil
Gramm (R-Texas) a favorite to succeed retiring Sen. John Tower (R-
Texas) and for Republicans Jack Hammond and Beau Boulter, who are
challenging Democratic Reps. Ronald Coleman and Jack Hightower in
El Paso and Amarillo, respectively.
Here he was greeted by raucous cheers from students, who waved
signs with such slogans as "Kick Ass George" and "Baseball, Hot Dogs,
Apple Pie and Reagan-Bush." He was preceded on the podium by
former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Roger Staubach and Miss Texas
1983, Dana Rogers, who sang "God Bless the USA."
In the El Paso district, which is 55 percent Hispanic, Bush quoted the
adage, "Mi casa es su casa" (my house is your house), and told his lis
teners that Democratic presidential contender Walter Mondale's philos
ophy is "Su dinero es mi dinero" (your money is my money).
GOP predicting congressional gains
WASHINGTON — Majority Democrats were off to an easy start in
the battle for the House today, with 54 seats in their victory column
before a single vote was counted. But Republicans, with just 13 uncon
tested candidates, were hoping President Reagan would help them to a
disproportionate harvest of tight races as the night unfolds.
Most GOP leaders say a Reagan landslide could roughly reverse the
Democratic pickup of 26 House seats in 1982 and restore the "working
majority" on policy questions that Republicans had with Southern
Democrats the previous two years.
Republicans would have to come up with net gain of 51 seats to claim
control of the 435-member chamber for the first time since 1955, and
virtually no party officials are predicting such an outcome.
A number of races could provide early evidence of a strong coattail
factor — or the lack of it. In Connecticut, for example, incumbent
Democrats Bruce Morrison and William Ratchford faced Republican
challengers for whom both Reagan and Vice President George Bush
made personal appearances.
In Delaware, Democratic Rep. Thomas Carper was in a close'contest
against Republican Elise duPont, wife of the outgoing governor. One
poll, released a week ago, had them tied.
In New York, key races included a big-money contest between Rep.
William Green, the Republican, and Democrat Andrew Stein, Manhat
tan borough president.
All 435 seats in the House are contested every two years, and
Democrats entered the election with 266 seats, Republicans 167. There
are two vacancies.
Democrats — including Speaker Thomas "Tip" Neill of Massachu
setts and Majority Leader Jim Wright of Texas — were unopposed by
the GOP in 54 contests. Republicans had no Democratic challenger in
13 districts.
Other leaders, of both parties, appeared safe although Republicans
have worked hard to unseat Rep. James Jones of Oklahoma, chairman
of the House Budget Committee. He has raised about $1 million to hold
off GOP challenger Frank Keating, a former Tulsa prosecutor.
Rep. Clarence Long of Maryland, an 11-term veteran who has
repeatedly thwarted Reagan over Central America policy, faced his
third challenge from Republican Helen Delich Bentley, for whom Bush
campaigned over the weekend.
Reagan, Mondale in TV ad flurry
LOS ANGELES — President Reagan and Walter Mondale made
final election-eve bids to sway voters last night, with the Democratic
challenger making what a spokesman said was his largest television ad
vertising purchase of the campaign.
The Mondale forces bought ad time on all the major networks, plus
CNN, ESPN, WTBS and the Christian Broadcasting Network, to air a
four-minute-20-second commercial.
President Reagan was airing a 22-minute television address that was
taped in the Oval Office last week. The ad was being run on the three
major networks at a cost of $750,000, aides said.
Mondale's ad opens with the Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young song,
"Teach Your Children," and scenic shots of agriculture fields, the
Golden Gate Bridge and the Statue of Liberty.
The ad, shown to reporters as Mondale campaigned in Southern Cali
fornia, was being aired a total of 11 times on the night before the elec
tion in the biggest single buy of the campaign, said deputy press secre
tary Scott Widmeyer in Washington.
He refused to say how much the air time cost.
The commercial touches several themes Mondale has stressed in his
campaign, contrasting children talking about what they want to be when
they grow up with footage of nuclear missiles blasting out of silos. Those
same scenes have been used in a shorter ad aired by the Mondale cam
paign in the final week.
Wall Street posts strong gain
NEW YORK — The stock market, inspired by falling interest rates,
posted a strong gain yesterday in moderate pre-election trading.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 11.70 points last week,
rose another 12.59 to 1,229.24.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange tailed off to 84.73 million
shares from 96.81 million Friday.
Today's weather
Intermittent showers today, with clearing tonight. Temperatures will

Bush woos Texas Republicans
DENTON, Texas — Vice President George Bush brought the
generously financed Republican coattails campaign to his adopted home
state yesterday as he stumped for three GOP candidates seeking to oust
incumbent House Democrats.
"For the people of Denton and the people of Texas, tomorrow is one
of the most important days in our country's history," Bush told more
than 2,000 cheering students at North Texas State University'. "I want to
be sure that the people of my home state go with Reagan, Bush, Gramm
and Armey."
Bush campaigned here for Richard Armey, who is posing a strong
challenge to popular freshman Rep. Tommy Vandegriff (D-Texas), as
part of the vice president's whirlwind tour of 21 congressional districts in
eight days. The effort has been aimed at converting President Reagan's
anticipated landslide into substantial Republican gains in the Democrat
controlled House.
Ron Kaufman, Bush's liaison from the Reagan-Bush campaign, said
the GOP is spending about $50,000 on television ads and direct-mail ap
peals aimed at wrapping the Reagan mantle around each of the 21 con
gressional candidates. Reagan is running about 30 points ahead of
Mondale in Texas, according to Kaufman. In 1980, he carried the dis
tricts with between 58 percent and 69 percent of the vote.
Bush also is campaigning in Texas for the Senate bid of Rep. Phil
Gramm (R-Texas) a favorite to succeed retiring Sen. John Tower (R-
Texas) and for Republicans Jack Hammond and Beau Boulter, who are
challenging Democratic Reps. Ronald Coleman and Jack Hightower in
El Paso and Amarillo, respectively.
Here he was greeted by raucous cheers from students, who waved
signs with such slogans as "Kick Ass George" and "Baseball, Hot Dogs,
Apple Pie and Reagan-Bush." He was preceded on the podium by
former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Roger Staubach and Miss Texas
1983, Dana Rogers, who sang "God Bless the USA."
In the El Paso district, which is 55 percent Hispanic, Bush quoted the
adage, "Mi casa es su casa" (my house is your house), and told his lis
teners that Democratic presidential contender Walter Mondale's philos
ophy is "Su dinero es mi dinero" (your money is my money).
GOP predicting congressional gains
WASHINGTON — Majority Democrats were off to an easy start in
the battle for the House today, with 54 seats in their victory column
before a single vote was counted. But Republicans, with just 13 uncon
tested candidates, were hoping President Reagan would help them to a
disproportionate harvest of tight races as the night unfolds.
Most GOP leaders say a Reagan landslide could roughly reverse the
Democratic pickup of 26 House seats in 1982 and restore the "working
majority" on policy questions that Republicans had with Southern
Democrats the previous two years.
Republicans would have to come up with net gain of 51 seats to claim
control of the 435-member chamber for the first time since 1955, and
virtually no party officials are predicting such an outcome.
A number of races could provide early evidence of a strong coattail
factor — or the lack of it. In Connecticut, for example, incumbent
Democrats Bruce Morrison and William Ratchford faced Republican
challengers for whom both Reagan and Vice President George Bush
made personal appearances.
In Delaware, Democratic Rep. Thomas Carper was in a close'contest
against Republican Elise duPont, wife of the outgoing governor. One
poll, released a week ago, had them tied.
In New York, key races included a big-money contest between Rep.
William Green, the Republican, and Democrat Andrew Stein, Manhat
tan borough president.
All 435 seats in the House are contested every two years, and
Democrats entered the election with 266 seats, Republicans 167. There
are two vacancies.
Democrats — including Speaker Thomas "Tip" Neill of Massachu
setts and Majority Leader Jim Wright of Texas — were unopposed by
the GOP in 54 contests. Republicans had no Democratic challenger in
13 districts.
Other leaders, of both parties, appeared safe although Republicans
have worked hard to unseat Rep. James Jones of Oklahoma, chairman
of the House Budget Committee. He has raised about $1 million to hold
off GOP challenger Frank Keating, a former Tulsa prosecutor.
Rep. Clarence Long of Maryland, an 11-term veteran who has
repeatedly thwarted Reagan over Central America policy, faced his
third challenge from Republican Helen Delich Bentley, for whom Bush
campaigned over the weekend.
Reagan, Mondale in TV ad flurry
LOS ANGELES — President Reagan and Walter Mondale made
final election-eve bids to sway voters last night, with the Democratic
challenger making what a spokesman said was his largest television ad
vertising purchase of the campaign.
The Mondale forces bought ad time on all the major networks, plus
CNN, ESPN, WTBS and the Christian Broadcasting Network, to air a
four-minute-20-second commercial.
President Reagan was airing a 22-minute television address that was
taped in the Oval Office last week. The ad was being run on the three
major networks at a cost of $750,000, aides said.
Mondale's ad opens with the Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young song,
"Teach Your Children," and scenic shots of agriculture fields, the
Golden Gate Bridge and the Statue of Liberty.
The ad, shown to reporters as Mondale campaigned in Southern Cali
fornia, was being aired a total of 11 times on the night before the elec
tion in the biggest single buy of the campaign, said deputy press secre
tary Scott Widmeyer in Washington.
He refused to say how much the air time cost.
The commercial touches several themes Mondale has stressed in his
campaign, contrasting children talking about what they want to be when
they grow up with footage of nuclear missiles blasting out of silos. Those
same scenes have been used in a shorter ad aired by the Mondale cam
paign in the final week.

Sandinistas claim election victory
MANAGUA, Nicaragua— Daniel Ortega, leader of the leftist Sandi
nista government and the party's presidential candidate, claimed victory
yesterday in the presidential election here and said the party is leading
by "an ample majority and an ample margin."
In Washington, the State Department denounced Nicaragua's election
results as a "farce" because the Sandinistas had no credible opposition.
Spokesman John Hughes said the Nicaraguan people were not
allowed to participate in "any real sense of the word. The Sandinista
electoral farce, without any meaningful political opposition, leaves the
situation essentially unchanged."
At midmorning, the Supreme Electoral Council said that with votes
from 16 percent of the polling sites counted, Ortega was leading with
68.1 percent of the vote. The remainder was split among candidates of
five small opposition parties.
The Electoral Council said percentages in voting for the national as
sembly were running at about the same percentage in favor of the Sandi
nistas as those for president.
Ortega told a news conference in Managua: "We take for a fact the
victory of the FSLN in these elections." He used the initials of the ruling
Sandinista National Liberation Front.
The main opposition coalition boycotted the election, complaining of
harassment and restrictions on campaigning and press coverage. In addi
