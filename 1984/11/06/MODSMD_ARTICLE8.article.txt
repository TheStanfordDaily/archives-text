# Mondale makes last appeal
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES — Democratic presidential
candidate Walter Mondale made a final appeal yes
terday from the valley of his political foe, calling on
California and the nation to deny the Republicans a
"historic mandate" and to bring about instead "the
biggest upset in history."
With some public-opinion polls suggesting he has
narrowed the gap with President Reagan, but with
some Democrats still fearing a landslide defeat,
Mondale used his last event on the West Coast to
press the "high stakes" argument in the campaign.
"My fellow Americans: There is no escaping it.
Tomorrow, someone is going to make history. Let
it be us. Let it be us," he told a highly enthusiastic
crowd of more than 20,000 in the palm-tree-lined
Pershing Square area downtown.
"The choice is clear," Mondale said, his voice
somewhat hoarse from the long campaign. "If you
let them make history tomorrow, they'll turn your
future into a future you never wanted. Don't let
them do it. Don't let them do it."

Southern California seemed an odd place for the
Minnesota Democrat to hold the last rally to be
seen by most American voters before the polls
opened today. It is far from the agricultural and in
dustrial base of the Northeast and Midwest where
Mondale must be a near-unanimous winner to even
be in striking distance of Reagan.
But, ironically, California, with its fat prize of 47
electoral votes, has been one of his best states in
the pre-election polls and a source of optimism yes
terday.
Meanwhile, Mondale's running mate, Geraldine
Ferraro, ended her four-month quest for
the vice presidency last night in New York with a
nostalgic visit to her alma mater, where she des
cribed her candidacy as a symbol "that Americans
should be able to reach as far as our dreams will
take us."
Clearly worn down by a grueling, 12,000-mile
final campaign week — Ferraro delivered an emo
tionally strong speech for the finale, at Marymount
