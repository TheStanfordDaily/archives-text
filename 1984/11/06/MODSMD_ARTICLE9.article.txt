# Violence subsiding in India

NEW DELHI, India — The ashes
of Indira Gandhi were sent out to the
distant corners of India yesterday as
her son and successor struggled to
keep new violence from flaring across
this bloodied, embittered land.
The worst of the deadly anti-Sikh
reprisals for Prime Minister Gandhi's
assassination subsided over the
weekend, but at least three people
were reported killed yesterday in
New Delhi — two Sikhs burned to
death, and one person shot dead by
snipers said to be Sikhs.
Other deaths were reported in
Sikh-populated Punjab state.
Rajiv Gandhi, the new prime mini
ster, asked the Indian Supreme
Court's Chief Justice, Y.V.
Chandrachud, to head a commission

to investigate his mother's slaying last
Wednesday by two men identified as
Sikh members of her security guard,
the news agency United News of In
dia (UNI) said.
Unsubstantiated newspaper
reports persisted of a high-level mili
tary conspiracy behind the assassina
tion. Justice Chandrachud was ex
pected to give his reply soon to
Gandhi's request, UNI said.
One of the assassins was killed by
other Gandhi guards, but the second,
identified as Satwant Singh, survived
with gunshot wounds and was listed
in serious condition yesterday at a
New Delhi hospital. Reports con
flicted on whether Satwant Singh was
well enough to be interrogated.
In an attempt to help locate a third

man believed to have played a role in
the assassination and now thought to
be in Canada, Indian authorities have
contacted Interpol, the International
Police Organization.
R.C. Kohli, deputy police commis
sioner in charge of the investigation,
said yesterday that authorities have
been in touch with the Paris-based
police organization, but he would not
elaborate on the investigation.
However, sources close to the man
agement of the Sikh temple here said
the two assassins took an oath to kill
Gandhi from a Sikh spiritual leader,
known only as Giani.
In the chill gray dawn yesterday,
about 36 hours after Gandhi's body
was cremated on a sandalwood pyre
beside the Yamuna River, her son

returned to help collect her ashes.
On Saturday, in a final ceremony,
the ashes will be scattered over the
snow-capped Himalayas beloved by
the former prime minister.
The rioting that exploded after her
assassination took more than 1,000
lives, mostly Sikhs, in one of the
worst sieges of communal violence
since the Hindu-Moslem carnage at
the time of partition of the subcon
tinent in 1947.
Over 500 were reported slain in
New Delhi alone, many of them Sikhs
slaughtered Thursday and Friday in a
poor district of east New Delhi.
