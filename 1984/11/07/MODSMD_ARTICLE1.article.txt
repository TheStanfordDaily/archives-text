# Reagan wins in landslide
## Voters look ahead to four more years 
### JOHN LIS Daily staff 
President Reagan's landslide vic
tory yesterday surprised few here,
though reactions to it varied along
party lines.
Sophomore Steve Dauber, head of
the College Republicans at Stanford,
called the decision "a victory for
Reagan and a reaffirmation of his
policies." He said the size of the vic
tory shows that voters today prefer
Republican policies to Democratic
policies.
Dauber said that "the massive
smack in the face" that voters gave
the Democrats means that
Republicans could control both
houses by 1988.
Democrats believe the election was
more a victory of Reagan's personal
ity than a preference for Republican
policies.
"I think far more than issues and
policies, this is an election that turned
on personality," Political Science
Prof. John Manley said. "What we
have here is a personality mandate
for a candidate with a personality, as
opposed to his opponent who, shall
we say, lacked something."
History Prof. Barton Bernstein said
the victory was "a personal mandate
for Reagan that may transcend party
lines."
Keith Archuleta, resident fellow in
Mirrielees who was active in the
Mondale campaign, said, "If you look
at the local issues and races, they're
voting against Reagan. They (the
Republicans) have convinced the
voters with rhetoric instead of is
sues."
Dauher replied, "I attribute more
intelligence to the American public

than that. They've liked what Reagan
has done, and they want him to do it
for four more years."
Political Science Prof. Paul Snider
man attributed the victory to the fact
"the country is more or less at peace
and more or less prosperous. In that
respect, they feel that Reagan has
done a good job."
Republicans were happy and opti
mistic about the prospect of another
four years under Reagan.
"Obviously we're all overjoyed,"
junior Jim Rutter said. "It's good to
see America's looking forward. I
think the more decisive the victory,
the more successful Reagan's second
term is gonna be."
Junior Ray Flores said of the vic
tory, "I expected it. I think it's going
to help the plans he initiated four
years ago."
Democrats weren't so optimistic.
"I think four more years means war
in Central America, more difficulty
for the poor and minorities, and I'm
very worried about South Africa,"
said Steve Phillips, a Mondale-
Ferraro campaign worker and mem
ber of the Black Student Union.
Graduate student Tim Wilson said,
"I'm really very worried. Reagan's
policies with the support of Congress
could be destructive for the working
class and, especially, students, with
cuts in student aid. Any hope of
rebuilding our educational system is
out the window."
Manley said, "From the point of
view of students and others who need
assistance, four more years aren't
going to be very good. In other areas
— Central America and the Soviet

Union — four more years of Reagan
is very dangerous."
Dauber replied, "I think the
Democrats are getting carried away
with themselves. The American
people knew that their policies
wouldn't work, and I don't think any
credence should be given to their
charges — Reagan's in office, so the
world's going to collapse. I think it's
coming from bias instead of rational
thought. It's like me saying if
Mondale had won, we'd have a 100
percent tax and give West Germany
to the Soviets.
"Sure, Reagan won't propose
massive new federal programs. 1 see
Reagan working with the private sec
tor to continue the economic
recovery [to] help the poor and the
middle class. He'll keep the safety
net, but there won't be any massive
new programs like the Democrats
[would have begun]."
Although Reagan rolled to victory
on the basis of an economic recovery
— one that has vastly benefited the
upper class as well as helping the
middle class on a smaller scale — the
Democrats think the recovery on
which voters based their decisions
will not last.
"The middle class thinks they're
better off, but in reality they're not

that much better off," Archuleta said.
"Reagan is very successful at making
people feel good. The economic
buoyancy has very little to do with
Reagan in the first place."
Wilson said, "I think Reagan got
lucky. He was in office when the eco
nomy was in a recovery from a deep
recession. But I think his policies are
not conducive to the recovery. I think
there will be a recession in 1985 and
the Democrats can gain control of the
Senate in 1986."
Manley said, "The current genera
tion of students [is] coming out of a
time in American history when the
economy has been downbeat, and
Reagan's policies have had a short
term effect. What he's done is pulled
off a short-term Keynesian stimula
tion. Basically we're in the middle of
a cycle. It was nicely timed to
coincide with a re-election bid."
Dauber countered, "I see the
recovery continuing. Wall Street sees
the recovery continuing. There was a
large gain in heavy trading, and it
should be bigger tomorrow. If
Mondale had won, everyone was
saying it would decline."
Democrats also see problems in
Central America in the near future,
citing television network news reports
that a shipment of Soviet-made MiG
fighter planes were on their way to

Nicaragua. Although the Nicaraguans
deny the report, the Democrats
believe this could be an excuse for
Reagan to order an invasion of
Nicaragua.
"I'm a little afraid of what will hap
pen in the next few months," Ar
chuleta said, "especially in Nicaragua
and Cuba. I think if Reagan thinks he
has a mandate, he'll do it.
"Cuban intelligence has been pick
ing up plans for the United States to
invade Cuba, similar to what Maurice
Bishop told everyone before
Grenada. There's also a lot of
evidence Reagan is planning an inva
sion of Nicaragua. I'm really afraid
Reagan will take the victory as a
mandate," Archuleta added.
"I don't think we're going to
invade Nicaragua, and I don't know if
the reports are true," Dauber said. "I
don't think it would be popular
domestically, and I don't see it hap
pening. The United States is working
diplomatically and through other
channels for a solution to the
Nicaragua situation.
"I don't look at Cuban intelligence
reports as valid information," he
added.
Dauber concluded happily, "Now
that the election is over, there's a far
greater chance of getting something
out of the Soviets."

Reagan working with the private sec
tor to continue the economic
recovery [to] help the poor and the
middle class. He'll keep the safety
net, but there won't be any massive
new programs like the Democrats
[would have begun]."
Although Reagan rolled to victory
on the basis of an economic recovery
— one that has vastly benefited the
upper class as well as helping the
middle class on a smaller scale — the
Democrats think the recovery on
which voters based their decisions
will not last.
"The middle class thinks they're
better off, but in reality they're not

that much better off," Archuleta said.
"Reagan is very successful at making
people feel good. The economic
buoyancy has very little to do with
Reagan in the first place."
Wilson said, "I think Reagan got
lucky. He was in office when the eco
nomy was in a recovery from a deep
recession. But I think his policies are
not conducive to the recovery. I think
there will be a recession in 1985 and
the Democrats can gain control of the
Senate in 1986."
Manley said, "The current genera
tion of students [is] coming out of a
time in American history when the
economy has been downbeat, and
Reagan's policies have had a short
term effect. What he's done is pulled
off a short-term Keynesian stimula
tion. Basically we're in the middle of
a cycle. It was nicely timed to
coincide with a re-election bid."
Dauber countered, "I see the
recovery continuing. Wall Street sees
the recovery continuing. There was a
large gain in heavy trading, and it
should be bigger tomorrow. If
Mondale had won, everyone was
saying it would decline."
Democrats also see problems in
Central America in the near future,
citing television network news reports
that a shipment of Soviet-made MiG
fighter planes were on their way to

Nicaragua. Although the Nicaraguans
deny the report, the Democrats
believe this could be an excuse for
Reagan to order an invasion of
Nicaragua.
"I'm a little afraid of what will hap
pen in the next few months," Ar
chuleta said, "especially in Nicaragua
and Cuba. I think if Reagan thinks he
has a mandate, he'll do it.
"Cuban intelligence has been pick
ing up plans for the United States to
invade Cuba, similar to what Maurice
Bishop told everyone before
Grenada. There's also a lot of
evidence Reagan is planning an inva
sion of Nicaragua. I'm really afraid
Reagan will take the victory as a
mandate," Archuleta added.
"I don't think we're going to
invade Nicaragua, and I don't know if
the reports are true," Dauber said. "I
don't think it would be popular
domestically, and I don't see it hap
pening. The United States is working
diplomatically and through other
channels for a solution to the
Nicaragua situation.
"I don't look at Cuban intelligence
reports as valid information," he
added.
Dauber concluded happily, "Now
that the election is over, there's a far
greater chance of getting something
out of the Soviets."

Heavy campaigning in California, including a Stanford rally last month, wasn't enough to give Walter
Monaale a victory in yesterday's voting.
President Reagan's landslide vic
tory yesterday surprised few here,
though reactions to it varied along
party lines.
Sophomore Steve Dauber, head of
the College Republicans at Stanford,
called the decision "a victory for
Reagan and a reaffirmation of his
policies." He said the size of the vic
tory shows that voters today prefer
Republican policies to Democratic
policies.
Dauber said that "the massive
smack in the face" that voters gave
the Democrats means that
Republicans could control both
houses by 1988.
Democrats believe the election was
more a victory of Reagan's personal
ity than a preference for Republican
policies.
"I think far more than issues and
policies, this is an election that turned
on personality," Political Science
Prof. John Manley said. "What we
have here is a personality mandate
for a candidate with a personality, as
opposed to his opponent who, shall
we say, lacked something."
History Prof. Barton Bernstein said
the victory was "a personal mandate
for Reagan that may transcend party
lines."
Keith Archuleta, resident fellow in
Mirrielees who was active in the
Mondale campaign, said, "If you look
at the local issues and races, they're
voting against Reagan. They (the
Republicans) have convinced the
voters with rhetoric instead of is
sues."
Dauher replied, "I attribute more
intelligence to the American public

than that. They've liked what Reagan
has done, and they want him to do it
for four more years."
Political Science Prof. Paul Snider
man attributed the victory to the fact
"the country is more or less at peace
and more or less prosperous. In that
respect, they feel that Reagan has
done a good job."
Republicans were happy and opti
mistic about the prospect of another
four years under Reagan.
"Obviously we're all overjoyed,"
junior Jim Rutter said. "It's good to
see America's looking forward. I
think the more decisive the victory,
the more successful Reagan's second
term is gonna be."
Junior Ray Flores said of the vic
tory, "I expected it. I think it's going
to help the plans he initiated four
years ago."
Democrats weren't so optimistic.
"I think four more years means war
in Central America, more difficulty
for the poor and minorities, and I'm
very worried about South Africa,"
said Steve Phillips, a Mondale-
Ferraro campaign worker and mem
ber of the Black Student Union.
Graduate student Tim Wilson said,
"I'm really very worried. Reagan's
policies with the support of Congress
could be destructive for the working
class and, especially, students, with
cuts in student aid. Any hope of
rebuilding our educational system is
out the window."
Manley said, "From the point of
view of students and others who need
assistance, four more years aren't
going to be very good. In other areas
— Central America and the Soviet

Union — four more years of Reagan
is very dangerous."
Dauber replied, "I think the
Democrats are getting carried away
with themselves. The American
people knew that their policies
wouldn't work, and I don't think any
credence should be given to their
charges — Reagan's in office, so the
world's going to collapse. I think it's
coming from bias instead of rational
thought. It's like me saying if
Mondale had won, we'd have a 100
percent tax and give West Germany
to the Soviets.
