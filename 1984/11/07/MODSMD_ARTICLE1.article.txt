# Reagan wins in landslide
## Voters look ahead to four more years 
### JOHN LIS Daily staff 
President Reagan's landslide vic
tory yesterday surprised few here,
though reactions to it varied along
party lines.
Sophomore Steve Dauber, head of
the College Republicans at Stanford,
called the decision "a victory for
Reagan and a reaffirmation of his
policies." He said the size of the vic
tory shows that voters today prefer
Republican policies to Democratic
policies.
Dauber said that "the massive
smack in the face" that voters gave
the Democrats means that
Republicans could control both
houses by 1988.
Democrats believe the election was
more a victory of Reagan's personal
ity than a preference for Republican
policies.
"I think far more than issues and
policies, this is an election that turned
on personality," Political Science
Prof. John Manley said. "What we
have here is a personality mandate
for a candidate with a personality, as
opposed to his opponent who, shall
we say, lacked something."
History Prof. Barton Bernstein said
the victory was "a personal mandate
for Reagan that may transcend party
lines."
Keith Archuleta, resident fellow in
Mirrielees who was active in the
Mondale campaign, said, "If you look
at the local issues and races, they're
voting against Reagan. They (the
Republicans) have convinced the
voters with rhetoric instead of is
sues."
Dauher replied, "I attribute more
intelligence to the American public

than that. They've liked what Reagan
has done, and they want him to do it
for four more years."
Political Science Prof. Paul Snider
man attributed the victory to the fact
"the country is more or less at peace
and more or less prosperous. In that
respect, they feel that Reagan has
done a good job."
Republicans were happy and opti
mistic about the prospect of another
four years under Reagan.
"Obviously we're all overjoyed,"
junior Jim Rutter said. "It's good to
see America's looking forward. I
think the more decisive the victory,
the more successful Reagan's second
term is gonna be."
Junior Ray Flores said of the vic
tory, "I expected it. I think it's going
to help the plans he initiated four
years ago."
Democrats weren't so optimistic.
"I think four more years means war
in Central America, more difficulty
for the poor and minorities, and I'm
very worried about South Africa,"
said Steve Phillips, a Mondale-
Ferraro campaign worker and mem
ber of the Black Student Union.
Graduate student Tim Wilson said,
"I'm really very worried. Reagan's
policies with the support of Congress
could be destructive for the working
class and, especially, students, with
cuts in student aid. Any hope of
rebuilding our educational system is
out the window."
Manley said, "From the point of
view of students and others who need
assistance, four more years aren't
going to be very good. In other areas
