# GOP picks up two governorships

### 
WASHINGTON â€” Republicans
wrested governorships from
Democrats in four states yesterday
and retained four other statehouses,
even though the party's gains were
limited to two seats with the ouster of
GOP incumbents in North Dakota
and Washington.
The Republican Party could in
crease its ranks among the governors
from 15 to 17 seats, with Democratic
representation falling from 35 to 33
statehouses.
Republicans made the most of an
opportunity presented by the retire
ments of Democratic governors in
North Carolina, Rhode Island, Utah
and West Virginia, winning each of
those contests.
Although the Republicans fended
off challenges by Democrats trying to
grab seats in Delaware, Indiana, Mis
souri and New Hampshire, the guber
natorial races in 13 states seemed to
have turned on local issues rather
than being unduly influenced by Pres

ident Reagan's landslide victory over
Walter Mondale.
The last time the Republican Party
held a majority of statehouses was in
1969, when the GOP had 32 of the
governorships.
Democratic Gov. Bill Clinton, the
first person to serve three terms in
Arkansas since Orval Faubus, won a
landslide victory over Republican
Woody Freeman, a political new
comer.
In Montana, incumbent Democrat
Ted Schwinden defeated Republican
State Sen. Pat Goodover.
But in North Dakota, incumbent
Republican Allen Olson lost to Dem
ocratic state Rep. George Sinner by a
57-43 percent margin with 71 percent
of the vote compiled.
In Washington, Democrat Booth
Gardner, heir to a timber fortune,
ousted incumbent Republican John
Spellman by a 54-46 percent margin
with 41 percent of the vote in.
In Vermont, Madeleine Kunin, a

Democrat making a quest to become
the nation's second female governor
in office, fell slightly behind Republi
can Attorney General John Easton,
who was trying to hold the seat for
the GOP, in a see-saw race.
In Utah, state House Speaker Nor
man Bangerter won over former Rep.
Wayne Owens, a Democrat, to
become that state's first Republican
governor in two decades. Bangerter
will succeed Democratic Gov. Scott
Matheson, who decided against
seeking re-election.
Former West Virginia Gov. Arch
Moore, a Republican who served two
terms from 1969-77, defeated Demo
cratic House Speaker Clyde See as
the GOP sought the seat being
vacated by Democratic Gov. Jay
Rockefeller IV.
In North Carolina, six-term Re
publican Rep. Jim Martin defeated
Democratic Attorney General Rufus
Edmisten, a protege of former Sen.

general treasurer Anthony Solomon

records gospel music, defeated Dem
ocratic Lt. Gov. Kenneth Rothman.
