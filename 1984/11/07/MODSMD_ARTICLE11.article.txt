## 'Save 13' tax bill fails, lottery prevails 
### 
LOS ANGELES — California
voters overwhelmingly approved the
first-ever state lottery yesterday, but
Gov. George Deukmejian's sweeping
reapportionment plan and Howard
Jarvis' $1.7 billion tax refund trailed
in a bitter seesaw battle.
The lottery, Proposition 37, was
comfortably ahead, 61 percent to 39
percent, with votes from 17 percent
of California's 24,000 precincts
reporting.
Jarvis "Save 13" initiative trailed
for the second time during the even
ing, with 46 percent favoring the con
troversial initiative and 54 percent
opposed.
Jarvis vowed late yesterday that if
his measure lost, "Tomorrow I'm
going to bring it back again." After
an uneven start, it clung to a narrow
lead, then trailed again as more
results were tallied.
And Deukmejian's reapportion
ment initiative, Proposition 39, one
of two Republican-backed measures
that would change the landscape of
California politics, trailed for the first
time during the evening.
The Republican-supported mea
sure led narrowly earlier, sparked by
largely GOP absentee ballots.
The other GOP measure, Proposi
tion 40, which would limit campaign
spending, was defeated, 38 percent in
favor to 62 percent opposed.

Proposition 41, a plan to cut
hundreds of millions of dollars from
California's welfare programs, was
also defeated, 44 percent to 56 per
cent.
Proposition 38, former Sen. S. I.
Hayakaw's advisory measure urging
voter pamphlets and ballots to be
printed only in English, was over
whelmingly approved by a 3-1 mar
gin.
And in a replay of the primary
election, in which a billion-dollar
slate of bond measures was approved
by voters, all six bond propositions,
totaling $1.65 billion, received voter

approval yesterday.
Those measures. Propositions 25
through 30, include $650 million for
veterans home loans, $325 million for
water and sewers, $450 million for
school construction and remodeling,
$100 million for toxic cleanup, $75
million for drinking water and $50
million for new senior citizen centers.
Proposition 32, which will allow
the state Supreme Court to review
only a portion of a lower court deci
sion in certain cases, was approved 57
percent to 43 percent. The measure,
in an unusual display of bipartisan
support, was backed by Deukmejian

and state Supreme Court Chief
Justice Rose Bird, who often has
been at odds with Deukmejian.
Two measures to allow tax assess
ment exemptions for fire sprinkler in
stallations and improvements to cer
tified historical structures were both
trailing by about the same margins,
with 43 percent in favor and 57 per
cent opposed.
Proposition 33, which will allow
the elderly, the disabled and the blind
to delay making tax payments be
cause of economic hardship, was
overwhelmingly approved, 82 per
cent to 18 percent.

The high-stakes array of ballot
propositions included one measure in
which total spending is expected to
reach a state record: Backers and op
ponents of Proposition 39, have
raised more than $9.8 million. That
measure, along with the GOP
supported Proposition 40, signify a
Republican attempt to end
Democrats' sway in the Legislature.
Lyn Montgomery, a spokeswoman
for the state Fair Political Practices
Commission, said fundraising on the
measure will probably exceed $9.9
million, the current record reached
for a June 1982 gun-control initia
tive.
Backers and opponents of the 16
propositions have poured some $29
million into their campaigns to woo
voters.
The propositions have dominated
the money-drenched ballot, sparking
fractious, bitter fights between com
peting special interests and the major
political parties.
Proposition 37 will set up an offi
cial state-run lottery by next spring,
providing some $680 million a year to
public schools, according to its back
ers.
Financed by the manufacturers of
lottery equipment but opposed by
horse racing interests, the lottery will
offer a $2 billion-a-year "handle,"
with half that amount returned to

bettors as prizes, a third for schools
and the rest for administrative costs.
Tickets will sell for $1 each.
Proposition 39, the reapportion
ment initiative spearheaded by the
Republican governor and the state
GOP, would create a commission of
retired state appeaJs court justices to
redraw the boundaries of legislative
and congressional districts for the
1986 elections.
Currently, this task is handled by
the Democrat-controlled Legislature,
but Republicans contend that
majority Democrats unfairly ap
proved boundaries that crippled
Republicans.
The second major GOP measure,
Proposition 40 by Assemblyman
Ross Johnson (R-La Habra) would
place strict limits on contributions to
political campaigns, bar corporate
and labor union donations and limit
contributions from other sources to
$ 1,000 per candidate.
It would also prevent transfers of
political campaign funds between
candidates — a provision aimed di
rectly at Assembly Speaker Willie
Brown — and offers limited public
campaign financing.
Hayakawa's Proposition 38 forces
the governor to urge the president,
Congress and other federal officials
to require ballots and other voting
materials to be issued only in English.
