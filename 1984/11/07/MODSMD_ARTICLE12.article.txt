# Morgan prevails in senate contest
## 
### GREGORY WEINGARTEN Staff writer 
Republican Becky Morgan, a Santa
Clara County supervisor, defeated
Democrat Arlen Gregorio, a San
Mateo County supervisor, in the race
for the state senate seat in the 11th
district, which consists of Santa Clara
and San Mateo Counties.
Morgan attributed her success to
the heavy Republican turnout that

was aided by an aggresive last-minute
effort to get people to vote.
Morgan said she wanted to spend
the next four years being a "good
senator." By working with the
schools, she hopes to improve the
education system.
Her campaign manager, Kimberley
Williams, also cited the huge Republi
can turnout as the deciding factor.
"A bunch of Stanford students
showed up to vote. I saw more young
people vote Republican than 1 ve
ever seen. I went to college during the
protest years when you didn t see any
students voting Republican. Its really
incredible to me," Williams said.
Morgan criticized her opponent's
recent campaign tactics.
"I was terribly surprised to see the
deterioration in his (Arlen
Gregorio's) campaign. His mail last
week was misleading. It included
misinformation and mistruths about
me that were not in the quality he in

eluded himself to be," Morgan said.
Tom Carroll, Gregorio" s campaign
manager, said Morgan will make a
good senator "but not as good as Ar
len Gregorio would have been."
Both camps felt the Reagan victory
had some effect on the race but
weren't sure exactly what that effect
was.
In other key state races, Demo
cratic Assemblymen Dan Hauser of
Eureka and Richard Robinson of
Garden Grove fell behind GOP op
ponents while the race between Sen.
John Doolittle and challenger Ray
Johnson remained close.
Hauser trailed Republican Danny
Walsh with 28 percent of the vote
counted. Walsh had 20,332 votes, or
52 percent, and Hauser had 18,489,
or 48 percent.
In Orange County, Robinson had
7,300, or 50 percent, to 7,404, or 50
percent, for Republican Richard
Longshore.
With 42 percent of the vote
counted, Johnson of Roseville had
51,976 votes, or 42 percent, and
Doolittle of Citrus Heights had
53,314 votes, or 43 percent.
Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-
Santa Monica) was behind his Re
publican opponent, but the counting
was slowed by an unrelated municipal
write-in campaign.
With less than 1 percent of the
votes counted, Hayden had 3,238
votes, or 38 percent, to 4,894 votes,
or 58 percent, for Republican David
Shell of Santa Monica. However, a
Santa Monica City Council write-in
campaign by Democrats was slowing
counting, since all ballots with write
in votes won't be counted until later
in the week.
In an open Los Angeles County
Assembly seat, former Republican
congressman Wayne Grisham of Nor
walk was ahead of Democrat Dianne
Xitco of Cerritos. He had 22,212
votes, or 58 percent, and she had
16,240 votes, or 42 percent, with 39
percent counted.
