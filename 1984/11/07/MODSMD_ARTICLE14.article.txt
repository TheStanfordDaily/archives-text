## The
						Stanford Daily Four more years

It's a landslide, and you pat yourself on the
back and say, "Today is as good a day as any to
drop all my obligations and responsibilities and
take a nice, long drive."
You wander into your three-car garage, and
sure enough your brand-new Mercedes — the
one you bought with those hefty tax cuts — is
waiting there: waiting for you. You jump right in,
rev your engine a few more times than you have
to and speed down the California coast.
You look to the west, and you pause to watch
the offshore oil platforms standing tall to the
horizon, proudly sucking up your future energy.
And you look east toward the mountains, where
an entire forest is being leveled to help make
American paper towels shoot for the stars.
It's enough to bring tears to your eyes, and you
can't stand it anymore, so you pull over and just
sit there dreaming about Lady Liberty.
Then you wipe your tears and finally ask, "Am
I really better off than I was four years ago?"
You have to smile — after all, you're all alone,
and this is your favorite question. It's certainly a

lot better than asking, "Are we better off than we
were four years ago?"
It's all in the way you look at things. If you're a
a pessimist, you pout about what the deficit might
mean to our children way down the road. But op
timists know that to be powerful, you've got to
spend what you've got when you've got it. You
can't spend time worrying about kitchen repairs.
Otto von Bismarck, a consummate optimist in
his own right, was right on target: "Let us leave a
few problems for our children to solve; otherwise
they might be so bored."
Suddenly you squeal away from the curb. You
know exactly where you're going, and you're not
stopping for anybody.
And you have every reason not to stop, be
cause you're on a mission to rescue yourself from
the clutches of selflessness and introspection.
Keep the pedal to the metal — maybe for the
whole four years — lest you remember the words
of whoever that president of yours was who said,
"Ask not what your country can do for you, ask
what you can do for your country."
