## Modest proposal 
### 
The recent altercation which broke
out between members of the Sigma
Chi and Beta Theta Pi fraternities led
me to think for a moment about what
should or could be done in response
to this senseless violence. The posi
tion 1 am about to advocate is inten
tionally too extreme to be considered
as a realistic course of action; I pres
ent it merely to provoke debate and
thought on what are fundamentally
important issues.

VIEWPOINT

Lately, we've been hearing a lot of
talk about fraternities and ethnic
theme houses. Many students find the
selective housing policy of the frater
nities, not to mention their spacious
and lush facilities, somewhat elitist.
At the same time, ethnic theme
houses have a very difficult time at
tracting sufficient numbers of truly
interested students, and thus more of
ten than not become dumping
grounds for those upon whom the
Draw did not smile. The ethnic theme
houses are perhaps too large for the
number of students they attract, and
are, needless to say, hampered by
their arguably poor facilities.
Consider then this possibility:
Have the Sigma Chis, who tradition
ally attract more potential pledges
than they can accommodate, and the
residents of Ujamaa, who are
genuinely interested in black culture,
switch houses. A similar swap could
be arranged between the committed
residents of Casa Zapata and the
Betas.
The proposal would serve a range
of purposes. First, it would be imple
mented as a punitive measure against
fraternities which have violated the
peace of the campus. Should we allow
drunken brawlers to beat each other
up at their leisure? No. The Univer
sity should take a firm stand against
such nonsense. But such a punitive
measure would, in the long run, bene
fit the fraternities themselves. The
Sigma Chis would finally find the
"Lebensraum" that they need, and

the Betas would be moved to a more
central location on campus, making
them much more socially accessible.
The ethnic theme houses would also
reap double benefits. On the one
hand, they would no longer have to
worry about filling their empty spaces
with "Draw fodder," who have ab
solutely no interest in ethnicity, cul
tural diversity or race relations. And
furthermore, the ethnic theme houses
might just become a bit more popular
if they could offer luxurious accom
modations and something other than
food service. In fact, the University,
by moving one or perhaps more fra
ternities to Stern Hall, might solve its
dilemma of attracting students to.that
complex, since the presence of the
frats probably would improve vastly
Stern's social reputation.

. . . we've been
hearing a lot of
talk about frater
nities and ethnic
theme houses.

More than anything else, this pro
posal is just one of those ideas that I
kick around when I hear about some
thing like the Sigma Chi-Beta brawl.
Switching frat houses and ethnic
theme houses may seem extreme at
first, but we must recognize that this
campus faces some serious housing
problems. If this suggestion seems
somehow unfair or excessively harsh
to you, then I challenge you to put
forth an alternative. Perhaps in this
way, the Committee on Undergradu
ate Studies and the other administra
tive organizations that shape Univer
sity housing policy will become more
sensitive to a broader dialogue on the
question of how to improve living
conditions at Stanford for everyone.
