## In defense of overkill 
### 
No one can take a joke anymore.
I know we're all enlightened college kids now,
but does getting an education automatically mean
getting depressingly serious? Hey — what's black
and white and bisexual and religious and has a
ridiculous accent and is red all over? A mad group
of Bisexual Lithuanian Mulattoes for God.
Never mind. I didn't think you'd laugh. The
Bisexual Lithuanian Mulattoes for God can't take a
joke either. Probably because most jokes are about
them.
But it's not just jokes. It's impossible to open
your mouth to voice an opinion nowadays without
tripping over one of a million lines drawn by one of
a million easily offended pressure groups, all of
which have their own rules for what is and isn't per
missible. Basically, everyone gets offended by
everything. It's almost funny.
But it's not. In fact, it's pretty insulting. I'm
smart enough, I think, to recognize the context of a
given statement. But pressure groups won't con
cede me my discretion; they want to regulate what I
can and can't laugh at and what I can and can't
hear.
Feminists are afraid I'll take jokes about their
body parts seriously and perpetuate male oppres
sion of women. Religious groups think that learn
ing about Darwin will undermine my belief in God.
It seems like everyone thinks I'm an idiot.

This mentality leads well-intentioned people to
support censorship, simply because certain books
contain words that threaten to erode their readers'
morals. Mark Twain's "Huckleberry Finn" is a
constant target because it uses — gasp — the word
"nigger." Don't bother talking about intention or
realism or irony, it has got the word nigger in it and
that's bad. Why, if kids read that word they'll grow
up and start slavery all over again.
You'd think that these would-be censors could
give me credit, indeed, would be nonexistent, here
at Stanford. I mean, along with everything else
we're taught here, we should learn a little perspec
tive. But perspective is exactly what we unlearn,
and, in our dedication to precision and rationality,
we become even more fearful of upsetting our
friends, the minorities.
Academically, this can get pretty stupid. Even
professors feel obliged to tip-toe around all these
invisible lines, doing their best to offend no one and
keep everybody happy. My Western Culture
teacher last year prefaced his lecture on Karl Marx
by apologizing to the class. Don't get the wrong
idea, he said. It's my job to present this material to
you. It doesn't necessarily reflect my own beliefs.
What was he afraid of? That we'd write home to
Mommy and Daddy and tell them our teacher was
a disgusting communist and they should stop
writing those $15,000 checks? Is there something

offensive about teaching Marx now that being a
communist is passe?
Why the hell does everyone think offending
people is bad? We should embrace overkill. If you
get people mad, they're guaranteed to think, if only
to argue with you. But what chance does anyone
stand of objectively analyzing Marx when the pro
fessor presenting his theory begins by disavowing
anything he says? The class could have learned a
hundred times more if, instead of delicately avoid
ing any murmurs of dissent from the audience, he
had gone overboard and done his best to piss off
the 200 or so capitalists sitting in front of him. It
wouldn't have been difficult. All he had to do was
endorse Marx from the start.
That would have forced us to do a little critical
thinking, especially if we were previously sort of
pleased with our way of life and felt some need to
defend ourselves. As it was, we didn't have to
worry about big bad Karl because we already had
the teacher's tacit dismissal of communism.
That's not learning, it's reassurance. Down with
reassurance. Up with overkill; let's hear it for over
simplification and sweeping generalizations!
It's the only way to learn.

That would have forced us to do a little critical
thinking, especially if we were previously sort of
pleased with our way of life and felt some need to
defend ourselves. As it was, we didn't have to

That's not learning, it's reassurance. Down with
reassurance. Up with overkill; let's hear it for over
simplification and sweeping generalizations!
It's the only way to learn.
