Nicaragua omission
I would like to comment on some
thing that was, for the most part, left
out of Jim Naureckas' column (The
Daily, Oct. 26) â€” factual informa
tion. An example is his assertion that
"the government (of Nicaragua)
does not execute people or condone
extrajudicial murders." The truth is
that after the Sandinistas came to
power in 1979, they indulged in the
same massacring of their political
opponents that is so common in
revolutionary aftermaths. The Sandi
nistas have not changed their
homicidal ways. Now, they simply do
not allow incriminating information
to leave the country. One may argue
that this is not so, but, if they have
nothing to hide, why is there such a
strict press censorship in Nicaragua?

I also found curious Naureckas'
accusation that the U.S. press has
ignored the "wide scope of the
Nicaraguan elections." Interestingly,
this claim to electoral plurality is the
basis for his argument. But then, as a
senior at Stanford University, I am
sure that Naureckas has superior
information than the professional
journalists whose sole duty it is to
cover Nicaraguan politics. In fact,
many elements of both the conserva
tive and liberal press have judged the
Nicaraguan elections a sham.
Naureckas also claims that
democracy in the region can only be
achieved by revolutionary victory. I
would very much like, therefore, to
refer him to Argentina, El Salvador
and Costa Rica to name a few Latin
American countries that have at
tained democracy without revolu
tion.

Naureckas' column is also notable
for what it excluded. That is, only
with U.S. pressure have even the
semblance of free elections in
Nicaragua come about. When the
Sandinistas captured power five
years ago they promised many
things, among them free elections
and no censorship. As can be seen,
censorship still very much exists and,
until recently, no elections of any
kind were planned either. It is the
influence of the contras which has
led to any elections at all.
No amount of liberal idealization
can gloss over the fact that the San
dinistas are a ruthless, repressive
regime. The Nov. 4 elections were
nothing more than a convenient
front behind which the Sandinistas
can hide their totalitarian govern
ment and legitimize their
stranglehold on the people of

Nicaragua. We must not allow our
selves to be deluded by the elections.
In their present form, the elections
change nothing# If the Sandinistas
really wished to show their sincerity,
press freedom would have been a
true symbol of a Nicaraguan commit
ment to democracy. The elections
point to the effects of U.S. policy
towards Nicaragua. The freedom
fighters are forcing the Sandinistas to
modify their totalitarianism. With
continued pressure, perhaps one day
we will see democracy established in
Nicaragua.
