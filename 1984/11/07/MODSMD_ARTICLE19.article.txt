## Taiwan just isn't the Philippines 
### 
As a Chinese from Taiwan, I am compelled by
my conscience to respond to Margaret Lee's article
on "The Philippines in turmoil" (The Daily, Oct.
25). To drag Taiwan into the Philippine human
rights issue is improper as well as ulterior.
First, there is the "martial law" issue. Yes, there
is a so-called "martial law" in Taiwan. Yes, the
"martial law" has placed some restrictions on the
political scene. But it doesn't prevent an individual
from pursuing his or her political career with a dif
ferent point of view, as so many have done.

VIEWPOINT

Yes, there is censorship of the media. But the
guidelines have relaxed so much throughout the
years that the absolute majority can express them
selves freely without feeling the presence of any
restriction. Moreover, Taiwan is theoretically a
state at war. To the communist Chinese fighter
planes, Taiwan is only seven minutes away. Com
munist China has never abandoned the idea of
"uniting Taiwan" using military means, as they
reiterated last month, regardless of Taiwan's being
an independent entity. Some measures have to be
set aside as precautions to handle this military
threat, hence, this "martial law."
This "martial law" hasn't even enforced a curfew
for as long as I can remember, and believe me, I'm
not as young as I would like to be. I don't deny that
there is a lot of room for improvement along the
lines of democracy and human rights in Taiwan.
But trying to equate a 1947 incidence in Taiwan to
Benigno Aquino's murder in 1983 in the
Philippines is really stretching it.
Then, Lee talked about this "belief' she had. To
state that she believed "there lies a deep, often un
voiced ache for Taiwan self-determination, human

rights . . ." is both subjective and irresponsible. For
if there was any such feeling, it certainly didn't
show in the landslide victory for the ruling
Nationalist Party in an open general election last
year. After all, what dictates the will of the people
better than a general election?
One must realize, especially for someone who
was brought up in the United States, that
democracy does not occur overnight. Democracy is
not only a slogan or a concept. A true democracy
has to be nourished and allowed to grow and ma
ture. A stable society is usually essential for this
growth. No one wants to see another Iran.
It took the United States 200 years of practice, a
bloody civil war and decades of a civil-rights move
ment to get to where it is today. Why can't the
American people be more patient with the other
nations that try to cultivate their own forms of
democracy? Too often, Americans examine other
nations solely from America's point of view. And

too often Americans criticize other nations using
different standards. It's just incomprehensible to
me when one talks about human rights in Asia but
fails to mention the thousands of political prisoners
and the tens of thousands of underground human
rights activists in communist China, or the refugee
abundant regime of Vietnam. When Lee asked the
"crucial question of U.S. involvement in Asia" and
implied the "U.S.-Marcos dictatorship," shouldn't
she also question the "normalization process" be
tween the leader of the free world and one of the
most secretive governments in the world just to be
fair? Or are the "strategic considerations" for the
United States too important for us to discuss the
human-rights issue in mainland China now?
I am just as disgusted about Aquino's murder as
anybody else is. But please keep sympathy to the
Filipinos, and leave Taiwan out of this.
