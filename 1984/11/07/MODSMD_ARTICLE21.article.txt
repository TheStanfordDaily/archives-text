## Middle class leads landslide, poll shows 
### 
WASHINGTON — President
Reagan's re-election victory yester
day was a broadly based triumph
delivered by the middle classes,
whose members concluded it is the
Republican Party that can best main
tain prosperity and deal with the na
tion's other problems.
This instant portrait of the result
was drawn from interviews with more
than 18,000 voters conducted yester
day for ABC News.
The interviews confirmed the the
ory that pocketbook issues were
paramount and that such widely
publicized matters as religion in
politics, the Equal Rights Amend
ment, the nuclear freeze and environ
mental concerns played no major role
in the outcome. There was also
evidence in yesterday's exit polls that
Geraldine Ferraro's selection as the
Democratic vice-presidential candi
date may have cost her party votes.
NBC, for example, reported that 16
percent of the voters said her pres
ence on the ticket encouraged them
to vote Democratic, but 26 percent
said her nomination made them less
likely to support her party. One of
the most significant aspects of the
evening was its intimation of a his
toric shift within the electorate
toward the Republican Party, which
for now is perceived as the political
institution best suited to govern. This
feeling, the exit polls revealed, has in
fected nearly one in five Democrats,
nearly two-thirds of the independent
voters, more than 60 percent of the
newest voters — aged 18 to 24 — and
an equal percentage of the "Yuppies"
of the Baby Boom generation. It
found tangible expression in a major
increase in the total vote for Republi
can congressional candidates as well
as in Reagan's monumental victory.
In the wide mosaic of this election,
Democrat Walter Mondale appealed
strongly to only one segment of

American society — the underclass
and those concerned with its plight.
He got 70 percent of the vote of
people with incomes of less than
$5,000 a year and a little over 50 per
cent of the vote of those with incomes
between $5,000 and $10,000. In all
other income groups, the exit polls
showed Reagan triumphant with
margins as great as 70 percent to 30
percent among the most affluent
voters.
There was also a clear racial split of
the electorate. White voters went for
Reagan by a ratio of nearly 2 to 1;
roughly nine out of 10 black voters
chose Mondale.
There were some notable excep
tions to these broad tendencies. For
example, seven out of 10 Jewish
voters — a generally high-income re
ligious denomination — favored
Mondale over Reagan. On the other
hand, Reagan ran most strongly in
some of the poorest states in the
union, including the Deep South.
Specific policy issues in the 1984
campaign were overshadowed by the
personalities of the candidates, ac
cording to The Washington Post's
polling director, Barry Sussman.
Reagan voters saw him as a strong
leader who would keep the country
prosperous and maintain its military
strength. Mondale voters saw their
candidate as an advocate of fairness
and social justice, admired his perfor
mance in the debates and approved of
his positions on the federal deficit and
the nuclear freeze.
There are many measures of the
breadth of Reagan's appeal. He won
by wide margins among every age
group and in every region of the
country. Union households gave him
47 percent of their votes, despite the
strong endorsement of Mondale by
the AFL-CIO. The best-educated
Americans, represented by voters
with postgraduate degrees, favored

Reagan narrowly — 52 to 48. Among
college graduates with bachelor
degrees, Reagan's majority was more
than 2 to 1.
The exit polls yesterday revealed
another shift of significance to both
Reagan and the Republican Party.
Virtually every identifiable ethnic
group in America gave its votes to
Reagan — Poles, Slavs, Italians, Ger
mans, WASPS, Scandinavians and
Irish. The exceptions were Orientals,
who preferred Mondale by 54 to 46,
and black voters, who gave Reagan
only 10 to 12 percent support. In ad
dition, Hispanic voters nationally ap
peared to have given Mondale a
modest majority. But in Texas, exit
polls show Mondale getting 72 per
cent of the Hispanic vote.
Among the major religious group
ings, Reagan carried the Protestant
vote by 2 to 1 and the Catholic vote
by roughly 3 to 2.
Remaining from all this are
profound questions about the long
term drift of American politics. Spe
cifically, has the United States just
engaged in a "realigning" election
that may ensure Republican control
of the White House for years to come
and perhaps for the remainder of this
century? There are those who believe
that it does, including Gordon Black,
the polling director for the newspaper
USA Today, and Horace Busby, an
independent business and political
consultant whose prescient forecast
of Reagan's electoral landslide in
1980 has given him cachet as a for
midable analyst and seer.
Black, just before the election,
declared that Reagan would achieve
"one of the great, historic landslides
of all time" in "the most important
and fundamental election since
1936. . . . This is a realigning election
in which Reagan appears to be cap
turing the young in a manner similar
to what (Franklin) Roosevelt accom

plished in 1936."
Busby is another exponent of that
view. "At this election," he wrote on
Nov. 1, " the demographics of age will
be supremely important. Will the 104
million young adults, 18 to 44, take
over the electorate, displacing the 70
million adults over age 45? Will they
vote . . . predominantly Republican?
If so, that is ominous for the
Democrats because once Americans
begin voting, they continue for the
same party. . . . The 1984 election
could be the Republican equivalent
of 1936 (which created for the next
16 years a Democratic presidential
majority). It will ratify 1980's conser
vative turn. If the margins are wide,
the effect may be to entrench the
GOP through the next three elec
tions. The stake is not 'Four More
Years.' It may be, for both parties,
the rest of the century."
Richard Wirthlin, the principal
poll-taker for the White House,
cautiously echoed those words Mon
day: "One of the things this election
can show is a change of partisanship
in the United States. If you want to
call it realignment, fine."
One definition of a "realigning
election" is the creation of a new
majority party that dominates not
only presidential elections but con
gressional, state and local elections as
well, a result the Democrats achieved
in the 1930s after decades of Repub
lican predominance.
Mathematically, no such sweep can
occur this year, although voter identi
fication with the Republican Party is
at its highest level in a half-century.
Some pre-election studies found an
equal number of voters identifying
with the two major parties, a substan
tial shift from the past when
Democrats outnumbered
Republicans by 15 percentage points
or more. Pollster Black attaches great

significance to the strong Republican
showing.
Busby is less sure. His theory is that
the American public rejects the con
cept of a single party dominant at all
levels. It consciously wants a division
of power between Republicans and
Democrats to fulfill the "checks and
balances" philosophy of the Constitu
tion.
"On poll after poll," he wrote,
"Americans say it is desirable to have
Mr. Reagan in the White House,
precisely for the purpose of serving as
a check on the Democrats. Con
versely, a recent Louis Harris poll
found 60 percent favor Democrats to
control the House as a check against
Mr. Reagan. The conceit of Washing
ton is that the people are eager for
government to act; in fact, since the
17905, Americans have feared ac
tivist government, [they] want to
keep it bridled."
At the beginning of this long elec
tion process, the Mondale wing of the
Democratic Party staked its hopes on

the mathematical potential of a
revived Democratic "coalition
whose principal components would
be American labor unions, women,
blacks, Hispanics and lower-income
groups. That calculus was flawed.
Reagan drew significant support from
all these groups with the exception of
black voters.
There were two major miscalcula
tions in the Democratic strategy of
coalition. The first involved the
"gender gap," the idea that women
voters — especially with a woman on
the ticket as vice presidential candi
date — would produce a decisive
majority for Mondale.
Not only did Reagan win a
majority of the women voters but he
benefited hugely from a male
"gender gap," getting almost twice as
many votes from men as Mondale.
The exit polls produced strong
evidence that "feminist issues"
carried far less weight than many
Democrats had assumed.
