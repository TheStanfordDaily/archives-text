# Voting wasn't easy for Ron and Nancy

SOLVANG — President Reagan cast his ballot in this little town near
his ranch yesterday, but it took some doing.
He had to get here from Los Angeles, where he was spending Election
Day and election night in the Century Plaza Hotel. And that involved a
15-minute limousine ride from the hotel to the Santa Monica airport, a
55-minute military helicopter ride to the Santa Ynez Airport about 100
miles north, a 10-minute limousine ride to the polling place in Solvang
— and then the same trip in reverse back to Los Angeles.
Once here, the president and Nancy Reagan turned in absentee bal
lots they had acquired earlier.
