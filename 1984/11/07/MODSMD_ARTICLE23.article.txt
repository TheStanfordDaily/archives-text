## Committee proposes Reagan Library sites 
### BAIE NETZER Senior staff writer 
The Reagan Library Planning
Committee presented its top three
choices for the Reagan Library site to
University President Donald Ken
nedy yesterday.
The proposed sites now go for con
sideration to the University Commit
tee on Land and Building Develop
ment.
According to Robert Freelen, Uni-

versity vice president for public af
fairs and head of the library planning
committee, the aim is to present the
White House with three site
proposals by December. Freelen said
the sites will proceed to the White
House only after consideration by the
Administrative Council on Nov. 14

and by the board of trustees on Dec.
11.
The committee's top choice for the
library site is the one closest to the
center of campus. The site is located
west of Junipero Serra Blvd., in the
foothills near the Center for Ad
vanced Study in the Behavioral
Sciences.
The committee's second choice is a
site located on flat land which borders
a tree nursery west of Interstate 280

and Alpine Road.
The final choice of the committee is
a piece of land now used for a horse
corral and riding area which lies in
the foothills between Page Mill and
Arastradero roads.
Committee members originally had
20 potential sites under consideration

before narrowing the choice to
three, Freelen said.
"We did have sites that were right
at the center of campus," he said.
"But we felt we should leave room
for future academic buildings."
Freelen said the decision to choose
a site near the center of campus was
due to visits by committee members
to the Lyndon Johnson Library at the
University of Texas in Austin and the
Gerald Ford Library at the University
of Michigan in Ann Arbor.
"The faculty at the Johnson and
Ford libraries told us that the prox
imity of the library to campus was an
important consideration if we wanted
the programs and services of the li
brary to integrate with the campus,"
he said.
In a report detailing the pros and
cons of each of the three sites, the
committee based its selection of the
Junipero Serra site on good access to
campus, minimal environmental im
pact, the screening by trees of
visibility from roads and minimal
traffic problems created for the
central campus area.
But the committee also reported
that road construction from Campus
Drive West would have a
"considerable environmental impact"
and that the land was perhaps better
suited to "other, later academic
uses."
Presidential Counselor Edwin
Meese, who serves in Washington as
the White House representative for
the library, expressed a strong prefer
ence for the Junipero Serra site
during a visit in the summer of 1983.
Freelen said he is not sure whether
Meese has seen the other two pro
posed sites and expects White House
authorities to visit campus to consider
all sites once the recommendations
have been forwarded to Washington.
According to the committee report,
the Alpine Road site is "not an effec
tive site for program integration with
the University" and provides "poor
accessibility for Stanford University
users."
The construction of roads could
also impose high costs, the report
said.
But committee members also felt
the site presented little conflict with
other land-use plans and would have



The Alpine site is west of Freeway 280 (from which this photo was taken) and Alpine Road (which intersects
280 just beyond right side of this picture). This relatively flat area now is partially used as a tree nursery. The
library complex would be in the foreground.


The Junipero Serra site, closest of the three to the central campus, is located behind the ridge, in an area to
the left of this picture. The ridge screens the site from passing traffic on Junipero Serra. Visual landmarks in
clude Lagunita (center), main campus (toward right) and Hoover Tower (right).


The Deer Creek site is in the swale to the left of the knoll on Deer Creek road (foreground). Page Mill Road
is at right. Freeway 280 parallels Deer Creek behind the hills. Site is now used for horses.
