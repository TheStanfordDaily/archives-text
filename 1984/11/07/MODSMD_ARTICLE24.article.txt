Fishy business
"... The sausage looks like pale ham
burger, tastes like pork sausage, but is made
of fish. . . "

No, this is not a description of Stern's new
Friday night alternative to enchilada
casserole. It's actually the latest invention of a
former Louisianameatcutter, Jack Anderson.
According to tie Michigan Daily, students
at the University of Michigan might soon be
treated to Anderson's newly invented
"sausage" in ther dormitory meals.

Anderson is optimistic about his new crea
tion, and cited its many possibilities. "Fried,
stuffed in bell peppers, simmered in chili,
added to spaghetti or pizza, it is difficult to tell
the difference between fish sausage and regu
lar pork sausage." However, just how the uni
versity students would react to his new
"invention," if and when it is implemented
into their meals, remains to be seen.
Meanwhile, students in Stanford Univer
sity's Stern Hall continue to complain about
their culinary plight, and are convinced that
the "grass is greener" no matter where else
they look. Apparently they haven't yet con
sidered the possibility of fish sausage.
Pillaging the pride
Lions and tigers and bears! Oh, my!
Engaging in a fraternity prank, members of
the Theta Chi fraternity at San Jose State
University attempted to steal a 300-pound
statue of a lion from the Sigma Alpha Epsilon
fraternity.
Their motivations for the attempted theft
were less than clear. Glen Gunter, president
of Theta Chi at SJSU, explained that he con
sidered the prank "harmless fun," but after he
and his accomplices were caught, he admitted
that he felt they had "done something wrong"
and were willing to accept the punishment
quietly.
The punishment was far more lenient than
either of the houses expected, as it involved
only a letter of apology from Theta Chi to
SAE, as well as to the president of the Inter-
Fraternity Council at San Jose State.
It was not discovered what the Theta Chi
fraternity members had planned to do with
the lion's statue if the theft were successful,
but it is a lot of fun to speculate.

Who needs a prof?
"If you can't forge it, don't drop it ... "
Unfortunately, no one offered this sage ad
vice to a few students at Pepperdine Univer
sity, who were recently accused of forging
professors' signatures on add-drop cards.

At least two students at Pepperdine were
suspended due to this forgery. However, Rich
Dawson, associate dean of student affairs,
said he believes the problem is widespread,
and that many more students were guilty,
though not caught. Either they forged a lot
better than the two students, or they simply
got lucky. But whatever the case, a typical
motivation seemed to be frustration with the
slow registration process at Pepperdine due in
part to a greater enrollment.

"The two students I talked to were just
lazy," Dawson said. "They just wanted to
speed it (registration) up."
Somewhat similar problems with forgery
were reported at Kent State University in
Kent, Ohio. Because of severe over
enrollment in popular classes, many students
have taken to forging official university docu
ments just to ensure a place in the class of
their choice.
Fortunately, forgery is not much of a prob
lem at Stanford. This may be because of the
high moral fiber of the student body. It may
also be because a professor's signature is not
required to drop a class until the last few days
of the quarter.
You decide.
Geeks for the Gipper
"Outlaw Russia!"
"Say it loud: We're rich and we're proud!"
"White male power!"
Taking a slightly different approach, and
several calculated risks, members of the
"Macho Nerds for Reagan" and the "Girl
Geeks for the Gipper" at the University of
Pennsylvania made their political preference
known.
"The idea is to bring out reality through sa
tire," explained Macho Nerd Ethan
Klingsberg of Pennsylvania. "We didn't want
to be rude, we didn't want to be silly ... we
wanted to show that their (the Republicans)
main weapon is comedy."
Klingsberg was referring to a post-debate
rally for Vice President George Bush that the
Macho Nerds and Girl Geeks, as well as anti-
Reagan students at other nearby schools, in
filtrated in early October. Disguised as what

they perceived as typical, upper-middle class
Republicans, they cleverly passed the secur
ity, and once inside, their cheers were loud
and satirical.
"Reagan is a very humorous president,"
Klingsberg said, "and he'd like everyone to

laugh along with him while the nation is crum
bling." To that end, the Nerds and Geeks
flaunted signs reading, "Hunger in America
— I've Never Been Fatter," "Less Govern
ment, More Surveillance," and "Pro-Lifers
for the Death Penalty."

Kent, Ohio. Because of severe over
enrollment in popular classes, many students
have taken to forging official university docu
ments just to ensure a place in the class of
their choice.
Fortunately, forgery is not much of a prob
lem at Stanford. This may be because of the
high moral fiber of the student body. It may
also be because a professor's signature is not
required to drop a class until the last few days
of the quarter.
You decide.
Geeks for the Gipper
"Outlaw Russia!"
"Say it loud: We're rich and we're proud!"
"White male power!"
Taking a slightly different approach, and
several calculated risks, members of the
"Macho Nerds for Reagan" and the "Girl
Geeks for the Gipper" at the University of
Pennsylvania made their political preference
known.
"The idea is to bring out reality through sa
tire," explained Macho Nerd Ethan
Klingsberg of Pennsylvania. "We didn't want
to be rude, we didn't want to be silly ... we
wanted to show that their (the Republicans)
main weapon is comedy."
Klingsberg was referring to a post-debate
rally for Vice President George Bush that the
Macho Nerds and Girl Geeks, as well as anti-
Reagan students at other nearby schools, in
filtrated in early October. Disguised as what

they perceived as typical, upper-middle class
Republicans, they cleverly passed the secur
ity, and once inside, their cheers were loud
and satirical.
"Reagan is a very humorous president,"
Klingsberg said, "and he'd like everyone to

laugh along with him while the nation is crum
bling." To that end, the Nerds and Geeks
flaunted signs reading, "Hunger in America
— I've Never Been Fatter," "Less Govern
ment, More Surveillance," and "Pro-Lifers
for the Death Penalty."




Fishy business
"... The sausage looks like pale ham
burger, tastes like pork sausage, but is made
of fish. . . "

No, this is not a description of Stern's new
Friday night alternative to enchilada
casserole. It's actually the latest invention of a
former Louisianameatcutter, Jack Anderson.
According to tie Michigan Daily, students
at the University of Michigan might soon be
treated to Anderson's newly invented
"sausage" in ther dormitory meals.

Anderson is optimistic about his new crea
tion, and cited its many possibilities. "Fried,
stuffed in bell peppers, simmered in chili,
added to spaghetti or pizza, it is difficult to tell
the difference between fish sausage and regu
lar pork sausage." However, just how the uni
versity students would react to his new
"invention," if and when it is implemented
into their meals, remains to be seen.
Meanwhile, students in Stanford Univer
sity's Stern Hall continue to complain about
their culinary plight, and are convinced that
the "grass is greener" no matter where else
they look. Apparently they haven't yet con
sidered the possibility of fish sausage.
Pillaging the pride
Lions and tigers and bears! Oh, my!
Engaging in a fraternity prank, members of
the Theta Chi fraternity at San Jose State
University attempted to steal a 300-pound
statue of a lion from the Sigma Alpha Epsilon
fraternity.
Their motivations for the attempted theft
were less than clear. Glen Gunter, president
of Theta Chi at SJSU, explained that he con
sidered the prank "harmless fun," but after he
and his accomplices were caught, he admitted
that he felt they had "done something wrong"
and were willing to accept the punishment
quietly.
The punishment was far more lenient than
either of the houses expected, as it involved
only a letter of apology from Theta Chi to
SAE, as well as to the president of the Inter-
Fraternity Council at San Jose State.
It was not discovered what the Theta Chi
fraternity members had planned to do with
the lion's statue if the theft were successful,
but it is a lot of fun to speculate.

Who needs a prof?
"If you can't forge it, don't drop it ... "
Unfortunately, no one offered this sage ad
vice to a few students at Pepperdine Univer
sity, who were recently accused of forging
professors' signatures on add-drop cards.

At least two students at Pepperdine were
suspended due to this forgery. However, Rich
Dawson, associate dean of student affairs,
said he believes the problem is widespread,
and that many more students were guilty,
though not caught. Either they forged a lot
better than the two students, or they simply
got lucky. But whatever the case, a typical
motivation seemed to be frustration with the
slow registration process at Pepperdine due in
part to a greater enrollment.

"The two students I talked to were just
lazy," Dawson said. "They just wanted to
speed it (registration) up."
