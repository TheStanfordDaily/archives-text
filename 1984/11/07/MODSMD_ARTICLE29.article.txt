## Prof. Islas moves into publishing traffic 
### CATHY BLEDSOE 
Arturo Islas has a unique under
standing of the University. For 28
years he has been an active citizen of
the Stanford community, first as an
undergraduate and graduate student,
later as one of the first Chicano fac
ulty members on campus, now as resi
dent fellow in Adams House. This
fall, Islas has been recognized for yet
another contribution as writer and
artist. The publication of his first
novel, "The Rain God," marks not
only a great personal achievement
but also an important victory in a
continuing struggle with the country's
publishing establishment to achieve
recognition for the contributions of
"minority" writers.
Islas was born and grew up in El
Paso, Texas. His father was a
policeman and among the first of
Mexican heritage to be hired by the
El Paso Police Department, even
though the city's population at that
time was about 40 percent Mexican-
American. His mother worked as a
secretary. In 1956, after completing
his studies at El Paso High School,
Islas received a scholarship to study
at Stanford, thereby becoming the
first in his extended family to go
straight to college.
Islas was an undergraduate and
graduate student at Stanford from
1956-1964. He continued to earn fel
lowships and awards to support his
studies, including among others, an
Alfred P. Sloan scholarship, an
NDEA fellowship and election to Phi
Beta Kappa. In 1964, he left Stan
ford, unhappy with its provinciality
and homogeneity (in his graduating
class of 1960, there was one Hispanic
surname — his — and one black wo
man; in his graduate class there was
one black woman).
For the next five years, Islas lived
and worked in the "real" world, at
one time holding down as many as
five part-time jobs. In 1969 he wrote
his dissertation, earned his doctorate
at last, and accepted an appointment

at San Jose State University with the
English Department and E.O.P. pro
gram.
Fate, however, intervened. Three
months before he was to begin his
job, Islas underwent radical surgery,
survived, but was too weak to work.
In the next year, he had more opera
tions, the third another life
threatening cliffhanger. During his
recovery lan Watt and Wallace Steg
ner made it possible for Islas to earn
some money by teaching Freshman
English classes which, that year, in
cluded the first significant group of
Chicano students admitted to Stan
ford, Islas said. In 1970, he received a
tenure-track, assistant professorship
from the English Department here.
He taught courses in American
literature and a creative writing
course for bilingual students, as well
as served on innumerable University
committees whose purpose was to
continue and enhance the education
of "minorities" in higher education.
In 1976 he was awarded tenure, in
part by writing the first version of
"The Rain God," at that time entitled
"Dia de los Muertos/Day of the
Dead." His colleagues in the depart
ment expressed great optimism that
the book would be published immedi
ately.
Unfortunately, it was not. Islas has
waited eight years to see it in print
and in the meantime has written two
other companion novels. As Islas des
cribed, "My experiences with the
New York publishing establishment,
which decides what the rest of the
country reads, have been heartbreak
ing. I know I'm not alone, but my ex
perience is unique in that my
background is unique and has been
all but ignored by that establishment.
"Is there anyone in New York in
terested in good writing from a point
of view that has not been given the
exposure it deserves? Does the writer
from a 'minority' point of view always
have to be bitter and screaming that
the establishment (i.e., New York

and the East coast) ought to be torn
down in order for justice to be
served?
"Or, at the other extreme, does a
writer from my point of view have to
kowtow to the reactionaries within
the establishment who find affirma
tive action programs and bilingual
education anathema and against the
'American' way?"
Islas observed that in the last two
years, New York has published and
promoted two works with "Hispanic"
concerns that are Mexican-American.
One was written by what he called a
"scholarship boy" who speaks against
bilingual and affirmative action pro
grams and who has a very hard time
bringing his heritage together with his
Anglo-American education. The
other work, it turns out, is by a rich
ex-Communist-American who was
blacklisted in the 1930s and who,
when he sits at his typewriter,
becomes a young, East Los Angeles
Chicano gang member named Danny
Santiago.
"It is enough to make the angels
weep," Islas said.
At this point in higher education,
Islas sees affirmative action programs
as absolutely necessary and fair.
"For all the problems AA may
cause some people," he said, "the
fact remains that without it, students
from my background — as well as
women, by the way — would not have
been admitted to places like Stanford
in significant numbers. And I know
that those students are qualified to be
here because I have taught them
along with the non-AA students."
He continued with a smile,
"Anyway, everyone here, whose par
ents cannot afford to send [him or
her] to Stanford, is on some sort of af
firmative action program. We could
say that non-minority students have
had the best affirmative action pro
grams all their lives. So what's the
fuss?
"As for losing one's heritage, I
happen to believe that you can be

Chicano and write a dissertation on
Milton, for instance. I believe that's
possible. The 'scholarship boy' I men
tioned earlier doesn't and I pity his
condition."
What writers like Islas and Maxine
Hong Kingston are doing in their
work is asking for recognition of the
contributions of minority groups to
American life and culture, whether
they be Asian-American, African-
American, native American or
Mexican-American. "The way to do
this," Islas said, "is to publish works
written by people from within these
groups. Whether positive or negative
in view, it doesn't matter. The point is
to have as many views from within
those groups as possible."
Islas said that, "So far New York
has only published two views: one

which denies the validity of the back
ground, and the other which roman
ticizes about East L.A. gang
members. And Mexican-Americans
are not blacks or Puerto Ricans or
Cubans. Our experience and history,
though similar in some general ways,
has its own rich particularity. In the
southwestern parts of this country we
were here before the Anglo-
Americans and European immigrants
came on the scene. We are migrants,
proud of our heritage and proud of
our contributions to North American
life. So why does the publishing es
tablishment continue to ignore us?"
All this is not to say that Islas sees
himself as a political novelist or as an
exclusively "ethnic" writer. Rather,
he strongly affirms the importance of
combining one's ethnic heritage in an

artful way to create fiction without
turning fiction into ideology and
without ever forgetting the humanity
of one's characters. When asked
about the "ethnicity" of writers, Islas
responded, "I consider all writers to
be ethnic writers. Take Tolstoy's
'War and Peace,' for instance.
Tolstoy wrote about a particular time
and place and a particular psychol
ogy. He knew Russian history, he
knew the Russian character, and he
wrote the greatest novel ever written.
Is he an ethnic writer? Yes! Of course
later, because he did his job so
beautifully, we — anybody, from any
culture — will respond to the
humanity, to his vision. And then we
call that universal.

After an eight year battle which English Prof. Arturo Islas described as heartbreaking, his first novel, "The
Rain God," was published.
