# Reagan wins in 49, GOP gains ground
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Ronald
Reagan swept to a 49-state, runaway
re-election over Walter Mondale last
night, but Republicans struggled to
translate his conservative landslide
into significant gains in Congress. The
president won every state but
Mondale's Minnesota.
The victorious president told
cheering supporters in Los Angeles,
"Our work isn't finished, there is
much more to be done." He said his
second-term goals were "strong eco
nomic growth without inflation and to
keep America strong," adding he
hoped to reduce nuclear weapons and
"ultimately ban them from the earth
entirely."
"You ain't seen nothing yet," the
president said in an echo of a cam
paign refrain.
Mondale conceded defeat,
telephoned his congratulations to
Reagan and told cheering supporters
in St. Paul, Minn., "He has won. We
are all Americans; he is our president
and we honor him tonight."
Democratic running mate
Geraldine Ferraro phoned Vice Pres
ident George Bush, who praised his
Democratic opponent — drawing
some jeers from his Houston support
ers. "She campaigned hard. She was a
strong opponent," Bush said.
Republicans held the Senate.
Democrats renewed control of the
House, but by a reduced margin.
Sen. Jesse Helms won a bitterly
contested fight in North Carolina, but
fellow Republican Sen. Roger Jepsen
lost to Rep. Tom Harkin in lowa. In
Illinois, Foreign Relations Commit
tee Chairman Charles Percy lost to
Democratic Rep. Paul Simon.
Democratic Sen. Walter Huddles
ton was defeated in Kentucky by
Mitch McConnell, and another Dem
ocratic incumbent, Carl Levin, trailed
Republican challenger Jack Lousma
in a long, late count in Michigan.
The president's victory was
predicted by all the polls, but impres
sive even so. He and Bush came close
to the 50-state sweep they sought as
Mondale won the District of Colum
bia, garnering three electoral votes,
and claimed victory for Minnesota's
10.
Reagan won the other 49 states
with 525 electoral votes. In The As
sociated Press count, the electoral
votes of South Dakota pushed his
total past the 270 majority mark.

Television networks forecast the
landslide between 5 and 9 p.m., PST.
Ferraro hailed Mondale in remarks
from New York City, saying he won
another battle — "That battle for
equal opportunity ... he opened a
door that will never be closed again"
by naming the first woman to a na
tional ticket.
"There is absolutely nothing not to
be proud of," she said as the returns
were counted. "No one should shed
any tears." With votes counted in 77
percent of the precincts, Reagan was
polling 59 percent to 41 for Mondale.
Democratic House Speaker
Thomas "Tip" O'Neill of Massachu
setts said Reagan's victory was the
result of "the tremendous popularity
of the president of the United
States. . . . We've never seen his
equal." But he said there were no
coattails and there was no mandate
for his programs "whatsoever."
The president and Nancy Reagan
voted in tiny Solvang, near their
mountain ranch.
Mondale was joined at his North
Oaks, Minn, voting place by his wife,
Joan, and son, Theodore. Politics
were not mentioned. Mondale merely
called to reporters, "Good morning,
did you have a good night's sleep?"
The running mates voted early,
Bush in Houston telling reporters, "I
did the right thing," and Ferraro
forecasting, "We're going to prove
the pollsters wrong."
The final pre-election polls pointed
to late gains by Mondale, but in the
end, no one but he and Ferraro were
predicting a Democratic victory.
The candidates used election-eve
broadcasts to make their case one
more time.
In a taped, 22-minute television
speech on three networks, Reagan
said America had made an "amazing
comeback" during his administration.
Mondale warned in a series of rallies
that no matter what they said, the
Republicans would view victory as a
"mandate" to raise taxes on working
people and send combat troops to
Central America.
The Democratic nominee's five
minute advertisement said he
preferred to lose an election cam
paigning on decency than to win one
based on self-interest.

Sen. Jesse Helms won a bitterly
contested fight in North Carolina, but
fellow Republican Sen. Roger Jepsen
lost to Rep. Tom Harkin in lowa. In
Illinois, Foreign Relations Commit
tee Chairman Charles Percy lost to
Democratic Rep. Paul Simon.
Democratic Sen. Walter Huddles
ton was defeated in Kentucky by
Mitch McConnell, and another Dem
ocratic incumbent, Carl Levin, trailed
Republican challenger Jack Lousma
in a long, late count in Michigan.
The president's victory was
predicted by all the polls, but impres
sive even so. He and Bush came close
to the 50-state sweep they sought as
Mondale won the District of Colum
bia, garnering three electoral votes,
and claimed victory for Minnesota's
10.
Reagan won the other 49 states
with 525 electoral votes. In The As
sociated Press count, the electoral
votes of South Dakota pushed his
total past the 270 majority mark.

Television networks forecast the
landslide between 5 and 9 p.m., PST.
Ferraro hailed Mondale in remarks
from New York City, saying he won
another battle — "That battle for
equal opportunity ... he opened a
door that will never be closed again"
by naming the first woman to a na
tional ticket.
"There is absolutely nothing not to
be proud of," she said as the returns
were counted. "No one should shed
any tears." With votes counted in 77
percent of the precincts, Reagan was
polling 59 percent to 41 for Mondale.
Democratic House Speaker
Thomas "Tip" O'Neill of Massachu
setts said Reagan's victory was the
result of "the tremendous popularity
of the president of the United
States. . . . We've never seen his
equal." But he said there were no
coattails and there was no mandate
for his programs "whatsoever."
The president and Nancy Reagan
voted in tiny Solvang, near their
mountain ranch.
Mondale was joined at his North
Oaks, Minn, voting place by his wife,
Joan, and son, Theodore. Politics
were not mentioned. Mondale merely
called to reporters, "Good morning,
did you have a good night's sleep?"
The running mates voted early,
Bush in Houston telling reporters, "I
did the right thing," and Ferraro
forecasting, "We're going to prove
the pollsters wrong."
The final pre-election polls pointed
to late gains by Mondale, but in the
end, no one but he and Ferraro were
predicting a Democratic victory.
The candidates used election-eve
broadcasts to make their case one
more time.
In a taped, 22-minute television
speech on three networks, Reagan
said America had made an "amazing
comeback" during his administration.
Mondale warned in a series of rallies
that no matter what they said, the
Republicans would view victory as a
"mandate" to raise taxes on working
people and send combat troops to
Central America.
The Democratic nominee's five
minute advertisement said he
preferred to lose an election cam
paigning on decency than to win one
based on self-interest.
