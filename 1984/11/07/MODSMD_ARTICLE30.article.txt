## Volleyball team defeats Long Beach 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford women's volleyball
team came back from a 2-1 game def
icit to beat Cal State Long Beach last
night in a "long and tough" match,
15-5, 12-15, 11-15, 15-4, 15-3.
With three conference matches
left, the Cardinal is 10-1 in the West
ern Collegiate Athletic Association
and ranked No. 1 in the nation for the
second straight week by the Tac
hikara Coaches Poll. Long Beach is
2-8 in the WCAA.
According to Cardinal Asst. Coach
Don Shaw, Long Beach "played an
excellent match and caused problems
for us." The 49ers"shut down" Stan
ford's leading middle blocker, Kim
Oden, Shaw said. Oden had only
eight kills in the match. "Kim has had
such an outstanding season so far, it is
not surprising that she had an off
game," Shaw said.
Stanford also lost setter Wendi
Rush in the final two games because
of an ankle sprain. She first got the
injury in the match against UCLA
Oct. 31. "We decided to take her out
when she was noticeably limping,"
Shaw said. In her absence, the Car
dinal was forced to use a 5-1 offense,
with only Deidra Dvorak running
Stanford's attack. The Cardinal
usually has two setters on the floor.
Freshman hitter Teresa Smith
came in for Rush, and outside hitter
Barbra Fontana was moved to the
right hitting position. "Barbra had a
great game. She did a great job
switching positions," Shaw said.
Stanford never has been behind 2-
1 in a match this season. The Car
dinal's conference loss to USC was in
three games. "Every time we go
down (to play Long Beach), we have
to battle, and this time was no differ
ent," Shaw said.
Bobbie Broer led Stanford in kills

with 12, and Fontana had 10 along
with 13 digs.
Stanford plays its third straight
away game tonight against San Diego
State University, which is second in
the WCAA.
The Cardinal has "never had an
easy match" against the Aztecs, ac
cording to Shaw, and did not beat San
Diego State until last season. Stan
ford won Â»he teams' first meeting this
season, on Oct. 19, in three games.
In that match, Stanford hit .505 as
a team and was able to control the
Aztecs' flat, floating serves. San
Diego State also had 14 service er
rors, but such mental errors are
usually the result of an opponent's
good play, according to Stanford
Head Coach Fred Sturm.
Shaw says San Diego State, like
Long Beach, plays better at home.
"They serve tougher . . . [and] have
the same kind of advantage (as Long
Beach) in that they are more confi
dent at home."
The Aztecs have recently been
playing well, according to Shaw, al
though they lost in the quarterfinals
of the National Invitational Volley
ball Tournament last weekend at
UCLA.
San Diego State usually looks to
hitter Angela Rock for consistent
play. Her quick arm swing and jump
ing ability make her a threat when
hitting from any position, Shaw said.
With three conference matches left,
Stanford's coaches refuse to predict a
1984 WCAA first-place finish, which
would be the Cardinal's first.
"Everybody thinks we have the con
ference wrapped up," Shaw said.
"We have four games (including the
match against Long Beach) to go and
we're two losses up (on UCLA, USC,
and San Diego State). That does not
look mathematically wrapped up at
all."
