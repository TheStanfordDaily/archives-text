# Heavy losses expected in the trenches
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
Even if Stanford wins its final two
football games this season, the Car
dinal will still suffer heavy losses
after its Big Game finale.
At the end of this season, Stan
ford loses virtually its entire starting
offensive and defensive lines. In
fact, for seven of the eight starting
linemen, the Big Game on Nov. 17
will be their last in a Cardinal uni
form.
That's not good news if you're
Coach Jack Elway.
It's in the offensive and defensive
lines — or the trenches as TV com
mentators call them — that football
games are usually won and lost. And
it's in the lines where experience
isn't a luxury, but a necessity. A new
face with a big body won't do.
"It's going to take some time" to
replace the graduated linemen,
Elway said. "But I knew that ini
tially when I took the job. I knew
when they were graduating. But
that's why I knew we could have a
good football team this season."
Elway won't lose an offensive
tackle here and a defensive end
there. It's much worse than that.
On offense, center Brent Martin
will be gone at the end of the season.
So will left tackle Jeff Deaton. So
will left guard Matt Moran. And so
will right guard Scott Carpenter.
Carpenter's replacement, Kevin
Lamar, is the most experienced
second-stringer, but he's a senior,
too.
That leaves right tackle John
Barns, who is also a senior but has
one more year of eligiblity remain
ing, as the only returning starting of
fensive lineman.
"Whenever you lose five out of
your six top linemen, you're going to

be in trouble," Barns said. "We're
just going to have to work hard and
get to know each other in the off
season. But I think we'll be all
right."

The problems Offensive Line
Coach Tony Yelovich will have next
season, however, are nothing
compared to those Defensive Line
Coach Tony Samuel will face.

Not only will all three starters on
the Cardinal's defensive line
graduate, but the top two reserves
run out of eligibility as well. Starting
left tackle Garin Veris, noseguard

Terry Jackson and right tackle Pat
Mitchel are seniors. So are reserves
Mike Wyman and Dave Marohnic.
Although three of four starting
linebackers return next season,
inside linebacker Matt Soderlund
said it will be hard to replace the size
and experience of this year's defen
sive line.
"We're losing most of our
lineman," Soderlund began. Then
he paused and said, "In fact, we lose
all of them with any game experi
ence except (freshman) Eric Volta. I
think it will put more pressure on
the linebackers because linebackers
are only as good as their defensive
line."
Replacing experience on both
lines will be a near impossible task
for Elway, especially considering
that of the backups at the eight line
positions, only two are juniors this
year.
Elway and his staff obviously will
place the most emphasis on the lines
when recruiting. "But it won't be
done with one freshman class," El
way said, "and it won't be done in
two. It might not even be done in
three."
In an effort to get some instant
experience, Elway said he wouldn't
rule out the possibility of recruiting
junior college players, a practice
Stanford has shied away from in the
past.
But you won't find experience or
offensive linemen in the Sears cata
log, and Elway is the first to admit
he needs help in the trenches in
1985.
Asked if he could ever remember
coaching a team that lost so many
starting linemen in one season, El
way shook his head, took a long puff
on his cigarette and said, "No, I
can't say I can."
