LOS ANGELES (AP) — Al
Davis, the managing general partner
of the Los Angeles Raiders, said yes
terday that it's time for Commis
sioner Pete Rozelle to change his di
rection for the good of the National
Football League.
Davis made his comments by tele
phone a day after the Supreme Court
told the NFL that it cannot block
future franchise shifts by its teams
and had exceeded antitrust limits by
attempting to stop the 1981 move of
the Raiders from Oakland to Los An
geles.
"Rozelle needs to go to work and
get out of the courtroom, get out of
Congress, get off the tennis courts,
get out of the race tracks, get out of
the social circles, get out of his ven
dettas and be the commissioner
again for the league," Davis said.
"I'm sure the National Football
League has greatness in the future,
even though the last five years have
been a downer. And I think the great
ness of the Raiders is also in the
future, even though we're not playing
very well right now."
The Raiders won Super Bowl
XVIII last Jan. 22, defeating the
Washington Redskins 38-9. But
Sunday they were beaten, 17-6, by
the Chicago Bears for their second
straight loss, the first time they've lost
two in a row since 1981.
Despite their current losing streak,
the Raiders have a 7-3 record.
Davis said if Rozelle hadn't been
consumed with stopping the Raiders
from moving, the NFL might not
have had to endure the two-month
strike by its players two years ago.
