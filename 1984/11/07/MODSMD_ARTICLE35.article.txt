# Stanford soccer team to play Cal Poly SLO
## 
### DARREN THORNEYCROFT Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford men's soccer team will try to regroup after
its 3-1 loss to the University of California at Berkeley
Saturday.
The Cardinal will face Cal Poly San Luis Obispo at
home today in a non-league match that starts at 3 p.m.
Cal Poly, a member of the California Collegiate Ath
letic Association, comes into the game with a 7-8-4
record. It lost to Cal, 2-1, Sept. 18, and Cal is the only op
ponent Stanford and Cal Poly have in common.
The Mustang's top scorers are Jeff Myers and Mark
Gaubatz, who each have scored five goals. Cardinal
goalkeeper Willy Burkhardt said Cal Poly is not compara
ble to Cal, Fresno State, or UCLA. "I don't know very
much about them," Burkhardt said. "I know they're not a
really strong team, though."
Stanford, 9-7-3 overall and 3-3 in the Pacific Soccer
Conference, has one other game remaining besides the
one against the Mustangs, a PSC match against the Uni
versity of Santa Clara.
Burkhardt said the Cardinal is trying to finish the
season on a winning note. "We would like to win both of
them to salvage our record, at least. Two wins would give

us 11 for the season, which would be respectable."
Santa Clara might pose problems for the Cardinal,
however. Although the Broncos' record is 6-9-2 overall,
they beat the University of San Francisco, 3-1, Sunday to
win the West Coast Athletic Conference championship.
"Santa Clara is more important now that they've beaten
USF," Burkhardt said. "They always seem to get fired up
for us. It's really important that we pull together and win
that one."
Stanford did not play one of its better games against
Cal, Burkhardt said. The amount of success the team has
had, he said, has been contigent on how well "we've
worked together as a team — such as against UCLA.
"It's the team effort that matters, but we can't always
find that certain magic. We had it against UCLA, but
didn't against Cal."
Burkhardt has been a bit disappointed with his play this
season. Although he holds Stanford career records for
shutouts, saves and minutes played, nagging injuries to
his back and legs have kept him from performing at his
peak, he said. But over his four years, he said he has been
"very pleased. Looking back, it's been quite a good four
years. I wanted this season to be the capstone of it all, but
it just didn't work out that way."
