### ROB GRAHAM Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford men's golf team let
one get away yesterday in the South
western Invitational.
The Cardinal finished in second
place, six strokes behind UCLA, after
the first 27 holes Monday. But Stan
ford's second 27 holes yesterday
didn't compare to its performance on
the tournament's first day at the par
-71, 6,807-yard North Ranch Country
Club in Thousand Oaks.
Five teams, among them regional
rivals Arizona State University and
the University of Southern Califor
nia, raced past the Cardinal during
yesterday's final 27 holes, leaving the
Cardinal men in sixth place. Reflect
ing the collapse, Stanford's effort in
the final 18 holes was third worst
among the 14 teams.
UCLA and host USC finished one
two in the tournament, and the top

four individuals represented those
Southern California schools. USC's
Sam Randolf led the way with a one
under-par 212, two shots better than
UCLA's Roger Gunn.
Senior Tim Robinson was the
medalist for Stanford, and his four
over-par 217 placed him in sixth in
individual competition. Robinson,
though, was not better than his
teammates yesterday. His scores, like
those of four of the five Stanford
players, progressively worsened.
Robinson went from a 71 on the first
18 to a 72 on the second and a 74 in
the last round.
The Southwestern Invitational sig
nals the end of Stanford's fall season,
which was one of ups and downs —
two fourth-place finishes, this sixth
place showing and a victory here Oct.
20-21 in the Stanford Fall Intercol
legiate.
