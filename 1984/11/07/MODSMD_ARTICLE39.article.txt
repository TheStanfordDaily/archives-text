# Stanford-Niven's dispute continues
## 
### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
The contract dispute between Stan
ford and Niven's International Mar
ket continued yesterday as courtroom
testimony from both parties focused
on the proposed location for two con
cessionaires that might sublease from
Niven's.
Store owner John Niven wants to
lease front-window space to a Mrs.
Fields cookie shop and a Cone-a-
Copia ice cream vendor. The Univer
sity maintains that if the subleasing is
legal — a separate point of conten
tion — the concessions must be lo
cated in the back of the store.
Niven rents 23,000 square feet on
the north side of the Stanford Shop
ping Center, a facility owned and
operated by the University.
A Santa Clara County Superior
Court judge heard testimony from six
witnesses yesterday in a two-and
one-half hour hearing. Judge Eugene
Premo requested that lawyers from
both parties submit written briefs by
Nov. 19.
University lawyers filed suit against
Niven's in July, claiming the subleas

ing was a breach of the store's 29
year-old contract.
Yesterday's hearing addressed thr
narrower issue of whether the Uni
versity, as Niven's landlord, has a
right to review the store's construc
tion plans. A ruling in favor of
Niven's would mean that plans and
construction of the concession areas
may continue while the lawsuit is
pending.
Five people testi fi ed on Niven's be
half, including N ; . n and representa
tives from bo.n Mrs. Fields and
Cone-a-Copia. Rosemary McAn
drews, manager of campus
properties, testified for the Univer
sity. %
After the hearing, Niven character
ized the University's insistence on de
termining the location of the vendors
as "ridiculous" and "preposterous."
"They say it's not OK in the front
of the store — it has to be in the back.
There's nothing in the contract that
tells us where we can put anything,"
Niven said.
University staff counsel Michael
Hundall said Judge Premo will issue
his verdict later this month.
