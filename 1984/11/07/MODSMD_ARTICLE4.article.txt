# Zschau coasts to victory in battle against Carnoy
## 
### SANDRA BODOVITZ Daily staff 
While Democratic challenger Martin Carnoy refused to
concede the race for the 12th district congressional seat,
incumbent Republican congressman Ed Zschau was
already singing his victory song.
Zschau's 64 percent, almost twice Carnoy's 34 percent,
guaranteed the first-term congressman a return trip to
Washington.
"I'd like to salute my opponents in this campaign, Mar
tin Carnoy, Democrat, and Bill White, Libertarian,"
Zschau said in his victory speech before 200 supporters
gathered at Rickey's Hyatt Hotel in Palo Alto.
The moderate Republican placed emphasis on the need
to "widen the portals of the party." He has previously
voiced his concern over the conservative shift his party has
taken.
In a race where the two contenders seemed more
similar than different. Brad Barham, a graduate student in
economics and a coordinator of the Carnoy campaign at
Stanford, said Zschau "has SRoken more moderate-liberal
than he really is."
"His voting was consistent with Reagan, but (at the
debates) he sounded like he was on the Mondale ticket."
But Drew Dougherty, Zschau's campaign manager,
countered, saying Zschau's "voting record is clear and
he's straightforward about what he believes. You look at
the ultimate numbers. ... Ed is clearly in line with the
views of his constituents in the 12th district. I think we can
make that conclusion final after this election.

The environment was also an area of contention.
Zschau has spoken moderately about environmental
protection but "his voting tells the difference," Barham
said. "It's the vote that makes the congressman."
However, Zschau's acceptance emphasized his commit
ment to the environment. The traditional Republican
Party conserves, Zschau said. "I think we have ... to con
serve the resources of this country."
The high-tech Silicon Valley is a prime candidate to be
placed on the National Priority List (NPL) of most dan
gerous toxic waste sites in the country. And according to
Zschau, the Environmental Protection Agency is spend
ing $1.25 million to study the problem of toxic wastes in
the Santa Clara Valley. "I'm pushing to get many sites on
the NPL," Zschau said.
Regarding the arms race, Zschau said the United States
needs to maintain a strong defensive posture but must also
work to solve international problems through diplomacy.
Carnoy has fought for a nuclear freeze throughout the
campaign. Last night, Barham said that Zschau "wanted
to kill the freeze motions, but once it was determined that
they would pass, he voted for them and claimed he was for
the freeze."
Barham, conceding a loss well before his candidate, said
he would consider it a victory for Carnoy if the education
professor came within 10 to 12 percentage points of
Zschau. Carnoy plans to run "no matter what" in 1986,
Barham said.

Ed Zschau celebrates with supporters as early election returns showed an easy victory for the Republican
congressman.
Students here were praised for
their efforts in both campaigns.
"Stanford students played a vefy sig
nificant part in Ed's victory, both in
participating in his precinct walks and
helping with the debates on the
campus," Dougherty said.
According to Barham, a large num
ber of Stanford students worked to

coordinate precincts and 20 to 30 stu
dents worked off-campus to help with
signs and voter registration.
Zschau said he did not think the
results of the national election were a
mandate for Reagan's policies. "I
don't think the Senate and the House
are changing all that much," he said.
"I had anticipated that [Reagan]
would get about 60 percent of the
popular vote," Zschau said.
The congressman predicted that
Reagan would tackle the deficit in his

next term. "It's going to take enor
mous spending restraint and a little
tax increase," he said. "You have to
do it in a way that won't curtail
growth," he added.
But according to Carnoy, that
growth has already been curtailed.
"The recovery has already slowed
down," he said. "In the next four
years it'll be even slower, maybe
moving into a recession."
Adding to his "highly negative" re
action to Reagan's smashing victory.

Carnoy said, "I'm glad to sge that the
Democrats picked up three seats in
the Senate. That's a good sign. The
other good thing is that the Republi
can gain of seats in the House is much
lower than predicted. It's an interest
ing phenomenon where he won by a
landslide, and voters split their votes
— very little coattail effect."

signs and voter registration.
Zschau said he did not think the
results of the national election were a
mandate for Reagan's policies. "I
don't think the Senate and the House
are changing all that much," he said.
"I had anticipated that [Reagan]
would get about 60 percent of the
popular vote," Zschau said.
The congressman predicted that
Reagan would tackle the deficit in his

next term. "It's going to take enor
mous spending restraint and a little
tax increase," he said. "You have to
do it in a way that won't curtail
growth," he added.
But according to Carnoy, that
growth has already been curtailed.
"The recovery has already slowed
down," he said. "In the next four
years it'll be even slower, maybe
moving into a recession."
Adding to his "highly negative" re
action to Reagan's smashing victory.

Carnoy said, "I'm glad to sge that the
Democrats picked up three seats in
the Senate. That's a good sign. The
other good thing is that the Republi
can gain of seats in the House is much
lower than predicted. It's an interest
ing phenomenon where he won by a
landslide, and voters split their votes
— very little coattail effect."

While Democratic challenger Martin Carnoy refused to
concede the race for the 12th district congressional seat,
incumbent Republican congressman Ed Zschau was
already singing his victory song.
Zschau's 64 percent, almost twice Carnoy's 34 percent,
guaranteed the first-term congressman a return trip to
Washington.
"I'd like to salute my opponents in this campaign, Mar
tin Carnoy, Democrat, and Bill White, Libertarian,"
Zschau said in his victory speech before 200 supporters
gathered at Rickey's Hyatt Hotel in Palo Alto.
The moderate Republican placed emphasis on the need
to "widen the portals of the party." He has previously
voiced his concern over the conservative shift his party has
taken.
In a race where the two contenders seemed more
similar than different. Brad Barham, a graduate student in
economics and a coordinator of the Carnoy campaign at
Stanford, said Zschau "has SRoken more moderate-liberal
than he really is."
"His voting was consistent with Reagan, but (at the
debates) he sounded like he was on the Mondale ticket."
But Drew Dougherty, Zschau's campaign manager,
countered, saying Zschau's "voting record is clear and
he's straightforward about what he believes. You look at
the ultimate numbers. ... Ed is clearly in line with the
views of his constituents in the 12th district. I think we can
make that conclusion final after this election.

The environment was also an area of contention.
Zschau has spoken moderately about environmental
protection but "his voting tells the difference," Barham
said. "It's the vote that makes the congressman."
However, Zschau's acceptance emphasized his commit
ment to the environment. The traditional Republican
Party conserves, Zschau said. "I think we have ... to con
serve the resources of this country."
The high-tech Silicon Valley is a prime candidate to be
placed on the National Priority List (NPL) of most dan
gerous toxic waste sites in the country. And according to
Zschau, the Environmental Protection Agency is spend
ing $1.25 million to study the problem of toxic wastes in
the Santa Clara Valley. "I'm pushing to get many sites on
the NPL," Zschau said.
Regarding the arms race, Zschau said the United States
needs to maintain a strong defensive posture but must also
work to solve international problems through diplomacy.
Carnoy has fought for a nuclear freeze throughout the
campaign. Last night, Barham said that Zschau "wanted
to kill the freeze motions, but once it was determined that
they would pass, he voted for them and claimed he was for
the freeze."
Barham, conceding a loss well before his candidate, said
he would consider it a victory for Carnoy if the education
professor came within 10 to 12 percentage points of
Zschau. Carnoy plans to run "no matter what" in 1986,
Barham said.

Ed Zschau celebrates with supporters as early election returns showed an easy victory for the Republican
congressman.
Students here were praised for
their efforts in both campaigns.
"Stanford students played a vefy sig
nificant part in Ed's victory, both in
participating in his precinct walks and
helping with the debates on the
campus," Dougherty said.
According to Barham, a large num
ber of Stanford students worked to

coordinate precincts and 20 to 30 stu
dents worked off-campus to help with
signs and voter registration.
