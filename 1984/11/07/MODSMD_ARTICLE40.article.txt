A bill to freeze the Stanford Pro
gressive Alliance's funding was put
off until the senate's next meeting
and a bill establishing a research
mechanism for three special projects
was postponed indefinitely at last
night's ASSU Senate meeting.
Senator Jay Alter introduced a bill
which would have frozen all ASSU
accounts of the Stanford Progressive
Alliance and prevented SPA from
getting funds until the 1986-87
school year.
The senate will consider the bill at
its next meeting, after the formal
report of a University investigation is
released.
The investigation, ordered by Dean

of Student Affairs James Lyons,
should return its findings this week,
according to Alter.
Alter also proposed a bill to pay
senate interns $75 to study the
feasibility of establishing an ASSU
poster shop, tool renting service and
furniture sales service.
The bill was postponed indefinitely
after Council of Presidents member
David Porter promised that the COP
would implement the bill minus the
provision to pay the interns.
Senators opposed the section pro
viding pay to the interns since the
ASSU already has a paid project
evaluation manager and because the
"interns want to do something and
. . . don't need a financial incentive,"
COP member Alice Wells said.
