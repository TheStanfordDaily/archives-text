lour faculty named fellows
i our faculty members have been
named new University fellows for
1984-85.
They are Assoc. Radiology Prof.
Sarah Donaldson, English Prof. John
Felstiner, Assoc. History Prof. Ken
nell Jackson and Chemistry Prof.
Richard Zare.
They join Law Prof. Robert Rabin
and Sociology Prof. Nancy Tuma,
who earlier were named fellows.
University fellows receive three
months' salary support to pursue an
optional project of their own choos
ing. The projects are intended to
broaden their perspective of the Uni
versity, potentially benefit Stanford,
or further their own personal re
search interest.
The program has helped nurture
the development of academic states
manship among the more than 44 fac
ulty who have participated since its
founding in 1969.
Corn named visiting scholar
Wanda Corn, associate professor of
art history here, has been appointed a
Phi Beta Kappa visiting scholar for
1984-85. She is a visiting curator and
consultant to various museums, and
her most recent exhibition is "Grant
Wood: The Regionalist Vision."
As a participant in' the visiting
scholar program. Corn will travel to
eight institutions: the universities of
Rochester, Idaho, New Mexico,
Wyoming and Santa Clara; Luther
College; lowa State University; and
the College of the Holy Cross.
During her two-day stay at each in
stitution, she will meet with students
and faculty members in a variety of
formal and informal sessions, includ
ing classroom discussions, seminars
and public lectures.
Researchers here called productive
Faculty members at the University
of Chicago, Harvard and Stanford are
the nation's most productive educa
tional researchers, a new study sug
gests.
Based on the "Social Science Cita
tion Index," the study was conducted
by Richard Kroc of the University of
Colorado's Health Sciences Center.
He found that education professors
at Chicago averaged 46 citations in
1981, compared to 38 at Harvard and

-29 at Stanford.
The most-cited Stanford Education
School professor retired in 1980,
Kroc added. Had his work been in
cluded, Stanford would have ranked
second.
Shooter receives grant
The American Paralysis Associa
tion Auxiliary granted $10,000 to
Eric Shooter yesterday in recognition
of his work toward finding a cure for
paralysis.
Shooter, who is professor and
chairman of neurobiology in Stan
ford's School of Medicine, has spent
two decades studying why peripheral
nerves regrow while central nervous
system (brain and spinal cord) nerves
do not. In the mid-19605, Shooter
purified and characterized Nerve
Growth Factor (NGF), a hormone
that stimulates nerve cell growth. He
is now applying recombinant DNA
technology to study NGF production.
Regrowth of nerves in the brain and
spinal cord could lead to a paralysis
cure.
"The advances being made in the
investigaion of central nervous sys
tem trauma should encourage
paralyzed individuals, as should these
efforts to fund continued research,"
Shooter said when notified of the
award.
New education center recommended
Stanford should create a single ex
tradepartmental education center for
courses and research opportunities, a
new committee report recommends.
Headed by Economics Prof. Ken
neth Arrow, the committee also sug
gested creating a single internship
agency for students and strengthening
undergraduate research opportuni
ties.
Its recommendations would result
in a major reorganization of five pro
grams in the School of Humanities
and Sciences: the Student Center for
Innovation in Research and Educa
tion (SCIRE), Stanford Workshop on
Political and Social Issues (SWOPSI),
Undergraduate Research Opportuni
ties (URO), Action Research Liaison
Office (ARLO) and Undergraduate
Special Programs (UGS).
The report recommends a restruc
turing to "clearly distinguish aca
demic from non-academic pro
grams." Renaming the programs also

would reduce the "confusion" result
ing from"the present complex organ
izational pattern."
Salmon receives medal
Vincent Salmon, consulting profes
sor in the Stanford Department of
Aeronautics and Astronautics, has
received a silver medal in engineering
acoustics from the Acoustical Society
of America.
Salmon received the medal "for
contributions in the design of horns
and the control of noise and vibra
tion."
Salmon became interested in
acoustics through a love of music,
which has been his principal hobby
throughout life. He is currently teach
ing a new course here on noise pollu
tion.

i our faculty members have been
named new University fellows for
1984-85.
They are Assoc. Radiology Prof.
Sarah Donaldson, English Prof. John
Felstiner, Assoc. History Prof. Ken
nell Jackson and Chemistry Prof.
Richard Zare.
They join Law Prof. Robert Rabin
and Sociology Prof. Nancy Tuma,
who earlier were named fellows.
University fellows receive three
months' salary support to pursue an
optional project of their own choos
ing. The projects are intended to
broaden their perspective of the Uni
versity, potentially benefit Stanford,
or further their own personal re
search interest.
The program has helped nurture
the development of academic states
manship among the more than 44 fac
ulty who have participated since its
founding in 1969.
Corn named visiting scholar
Wanda Corn, associate professor of
art history here, has been appointed a
Phi Beta Kappa visiting scholar for
1984-85. She is a visiting curator and
consultant to various museums, and
her most recent exhibition is "Grant
Wood: The Regionalist Vision."
As a participant in' the visiting
scholar program. Corn will travel to
eight institutions: the universities of
Rochester, Idaho, New Mexico,
Wyoming and Santa Clara; Luther
College; lowa State University; and
the College of the Holy Cross.
During her two-day stay at each in
stitution, she will meet with students
and faculty members in a variety of
formal and informal sessions, includ
ing classroom discussions, seminars
and public lectures.
Researchers here called productive
Faculty members at the University
of Chicago, Harvard and Stanford are
the nation's most productive educa
tional researchers, a new study sug
gests.
Based on the "Social Science Cita
tion Index," the study was conducted
by Richard Kroc of the University of
Colorado's Health Sciences Center.
He found that education professors
at Chicago averaged 46 citations in
1981, compared to 38 at Harvard and

-29 at Stanford.
The most-cited Stanford Education
School professor retired in 1980,
Kroc added. Had his work been in
cluded, Stanford would have ranked
second.
Shooter receives grant
The American Paralysis Associa
tion Auxiliary granted $10,000 to
Eric Shooter yesterday in recognition
of his work toward finding a cure for
paralysis.
Shooter, who is professor and
chairman of neurobiology in Stan
ford's School of Medicine, has spent
two decades studying why peripheral
nerves regrow while central nervous
system (brain and spinal cord) nerves
do not. In the mid-19605, Shooter
purified and characterized Nerve
Growth Factor (NGF), a hormone
that stimulates nerve cell growth. He
is now applying recombinant DNA
technology to study NGF production.
Regrowth of nerves in the brain and
spinal cord could lead to a paralysis
cure.
"The advances being made in the
investigaion of central nervous sys
tem trauma should encourage
paralyzed individuals, as should these
efforts to fund continued research,"
Shooter said when notified of the
award.
New education center recommended
Stanford should create a single ex
tradepartmental education center for
courses and research opportunities, a
new committee report recommends.
Headed by Economics Prof. Ken
neth Arrow, the committee also sug
gested creating a single internship
agency for students and strengthening
undergraduate research opportuni
ties.
Its recommendations would result
in a major reorganization of five pro
grams in the School of Humanities
and Sciences: the Student Center for
Innovation in Research and Educa
tion (SCIRE), Stanford Workshop on
Political and Social Issues (SWOPSI),
Undergraduate Research Opportuni
ties (URO), Action Research Liaison
Office (ARLO) and Undergraduate
Special Programs (UGS).
The report recommends a restruc
turing to "clearly distinguish aca
demic from non-academic pro
grams." Renaming the programs also

would reduce the "confusion" result
ing from"the present complex organ
izational pattern."
Salmon receives medal
Vincent Salmon, consulting profes
sor in the Stanford Department of
Aeronautics and Astronautics, has
received a silver medal in engineering
acoustics from the Acoustical Society
of America.
Salmon received the medal "for
contributions in the design of horns
and the control of noise and vibra
tion."
Salmon became interested in
acoustics through a love of music,
which has been his principal hobby
throughout life. He is currently teach
ing a new course here on noise pollu
tion.
Vincenti wins technology award
Walter Vincenti, professor
emeritus of aeronautical and
astronautical engineering here, has
received the 1984 Abott Payson Us
her Prize of the Society for the His
tory of Technology.
The Usher Prize is awarded an
nually to the author of the best schol
arly work published during the
preceding three years under the aus
pices of the society, which is based at
the University of California at Santa
Barbara's Deparment of History.
Vincenti received the award for his
article "Control-Volume Analysis: A
Difference in Thinking Between En
gineering and Physics," which ap

peared in the April 1983 issue of
Technology and Culture magazine.
New assoc. dean of engineering
Dwain Fullerton, vice president for
institute relations at the California
Institute of Technology in Pasadena,
will become associate dean for exter

Fullerton has made an impressive
record at Cal Tech. We are pleased
that we shall be gaining the benefit of
his many talents, and we welcome
him back."
Fullerton served as associate vice
president for medical development
here before leaving for Cal Tech in
1980. Previously, he directed the
University's Corporate Relations
Program for 10 years.
Paulson honored
Boyd Paulson, professor and asso
ciate chairman of the Stanford De
partment of Civil Engineering, has
won the 1984 construction manage
ment award of the American Society
