Rajiv Gandhi meets with Sikhs
NEW DELHI, India — Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi said yesterday
that the assassination of Indira Gandhi, his mother and predecessor,
should not be blamed on India's community of 14 million Sikhs, already
battered by bloody communal rioting since the killing.
Striving to calm religious animosities that flared following the murder,
Rajiv Gandhi told a group of Sikh leaders that he believed the two Sikhs
identified as his mother's assassins were acting on their own.
"He told us it was not an act .. .by the Sikhs, but rather of two indi
viduals," said Delhi University Vice Chancellor Gurbaksh Singh. Both
of the alleged assassins were members of Indira Gandhi's personal se
curity force. Rajiv Gandhi's meeting with the Sikh leaders was part of
a government effort to accelerate aid to the Sikh community after
hundreds of Sikhs were killed by Hindu mobs who blamed members of
the small but influential religion for the assassination.
Doctors were fighting yesterday to save the life of one of the assassins,
Satwant Singh, as he lay heavily guarded in a hospital here with several
bullet wounds, hosptital authorities said.
Singh, a Delhi police constable in his late 20s, was rushed to the hospi
tal soon after he and another Sikh bodyguard, who was killed, had
gunned down Gandhi at her residence last Wednesday morning.
Meanwhile, the government said the first few Sikhs who fled their
homes during the riots had begun trickling back yesterday. But M.M.K.
Wa!i, the national government's home secretary, acknowledged that
more than 30,000 men. women and children remained in 12 makeshift
refugee camps and at least seven temples.
16 now dead in S. African strike
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — The death toll in a 48-hour gen
eral stri l ' black workers seeking government action on their political
and e . ,mic grievances rose to at least 16 yesterday as hundreds of
thousands of people stayed away from their jobs here for a second day.
Clashes continued between police and groups of angry black youths in
several of the black townships east and north of Johannesburg but police
spokesmen said that the overall situation was quieter than it had been
Monday when violent confrontations were widespread throughout
Transvaal province.
The scale of the strike also appeared somewhat diminished in its
second day as some blacks, particularly residents of Johannesburg's
black satellite city of Soweto, returned to work. Business groups, never
theless, estimated that 50 percent to 55 percent of black workers
throughout Transvaal remained off their jobs. In some factories, the
strike was total.
So far, there has been no official government comment on the strike,
the largest such action by South African blacks in more than a decade,
but the state controlled South African Broadcasting Corp. described the
protests in a political commentary last night as "flagrant criminality."
Although South Africa's blacks might have grievances, the commen
tary said, reflecting government views, the problems cannot be resolved
by violence. The general strike, it continued, was "a purposeful, large
scale commission of common crimes that have little or no bearing on any
political issue."
New weapons pour into Nicaragua
MANAGUA, Nicaragua — A Bulgarian ship in the last 10 days has
unloaded military helicopters, anti-aircraft weapons and radar, accord
ing to high-ranking diplomatic sources here.
The delivery indicates that Nicaragua's armed forces plan to escalate
their fight against anti-government guerrillas, the sources said. The
United States, which has financed the guerrillas in the past via the CIA,
has objected to Nicaragua's arms buildup and to its reliance on the So
viet Bloc for weapons.
The helicopters would help Nicaraguan troops to travel rapidly in the
mountainous areas where the rebels are active. The anti-aircraft ma
terial, which was said to be more sophisticated than anything that
Nicaragua had received previously, could help to shoot down
supply planes that fly in from Honduras to drop ammunition and other
equipment by parachute to guerrillas inside Nicaragua.
"More sophisticated arms are being brought in now. One would
derive from this that they intend to step up the war against the contras,"
a knowledgeable foreign observer said. The guerrillas often are called
contras as shorthand for "counterrevolutionaries."
The new weapons were unloaded at the Caribbean port of El Bluff,
said the sources, noting that a security cordon was established there Oct.
26. The diplomats here did not specify whether the helicopters were
primarily designed for carrying troops or were specifically outfitted as
gunships.
There was no immediate comment here on American television
reports last night quoting intelligence or Pentagon sources as saying that
MiG warplanes were on a Soviet ship bound for Nicaragua.
Two senior diplomats here have said in the past four days that there
was no evidence that MiGs or other warplanes were en route.
Discovery set for today's liftoff
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — As its five astronauts received last
minute flight updates, crews prepared space shuttle Discovery for a lift
off this morning on a mission to chase and capture two satellites that are
whirling rround Earth in worthless orbits.
DLcove.'v was set to roar away from the Kennedy Space Center at
8:22 a.m. I T and predictions were for scattered clouds, "no chance of
fog," and ge. le winds.
During their eight days aloft, the astronauts will deliver two commer
cial satellites to space, then make daring space walks to snag the two er
rant satellites and iock them into the shuttle cargo bay for return to
Earth.
It will be the first time that satellites have been brought back for
repair. The technique for tracking them down was developed last April
when another crew swapped parts on the Solar Max satellite and
released it back into orbit. Commanding the mission is veteran shuttle
pilot Rick Hauck. Other crew members are pilot David Walker and mis
sion specialists Anna Fisher, Joe Allen and Dale Gardner.
Officers charged in priest killing
WARSAW, Poland — Three secret police officers were formally
charged yesterday with murdering Father Jerzy Popieluszko, who prob
ably died as a result of strangulation, the official Polish news agency re
ported.
Interior Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak said testimony from the three Se
curity Service officers indicated that Popieluszko "did not show any
signs of life" when they threw him into a Vistula River reservoir on the
night of Oct. 19.
Kiszczak's statement, delivered to a commission of the Sejm, Poland's
parliament, left open the possibility that the pro-Solidarity priest was
still alive but unconscious when the kidnappers disposed of him.
Col. Zbigniew Pudysz, director of the Interior Ministry's investigation
office, also told the Sejm's Commission on Internal Affairs and Justice
that the three officers had confessed to kidnapping and killing the 37-
year-old priest, Polish television reported yesterday evening.
Popieluszko was kidnapped on the night of Oct. 19 near the northern
city of Torun. Police divers recovered his body Oct. 30. The slaying of
the popular cleric set off a storm of public anger that has shaken the
leadership of Premier Wojciech Jaruzelski and prompted unusual can
dor for an East European government in its treatment of the case.
Stocks surge on Election Day
NEW YORK — Stocks surged ahead yesterday in surprisingly active
trading, and the Dow Jones industrial average climbed to its highest
level since January as the nation elected its next president.
The market wrote history of its own by being open on the day of a
presidential election for the first time since organized securities trading
began in the United States nearly 200 years ago.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials spurted 14.91 to 1,244.15,
its highest point since Jan. 23, when it closed at 1,244.45.

several of the black townships east and north of Johannesburg but police
spokesmen said that the overall situation was quieter than it had been
Monday when violent confrontations were widespread throughout
Transvaal province.
The scale of the strike also appeared somewhat diminished in its
second day as some blacks, particularly residents of Johannesburg's
black satellite city of Soweto, returned to work. Business groups, never
theless, estimated that 50 percent to 55 percent of black workers
throughout Transvaal remained off their jobs. In some factories, the
strike was total.
So far, there has been no official government comment on the strike,
the largest such action by South African blacks in more than a decade,
but the state controlled South African Broadcasting Corp. described the
protests in a political commentary last night as "flagrant criminality."
Although South Africa's blacks might have grievances, the commen
tary said, reflecting government views, the problems cannot be resolved
by violence. The general strike, it continued, was "a purposeful, large
scale commission of common crimes that have little or no bearing on any
political issue."
New weapons pour into Nicaragua
MANAGUA, Nicaragua — A Bulgarian ship in the last 10 days has
unloaded military helicopters, anti-aircraft weapons and radar, accord
ing to high-ranking diplomatic sources here.
The delivery indicates that Nicaragua's armed forces plan to escalate
their fight against anti-government guerrillas, the sources said. The
United States, which has financed the guerrillas in the past via the CIA,
has objected to Nicaragua's arms buildup and to its reliance on the So
viet Bloc for weapons.
The helicopters would help Nicaraguan troops to travel rapidly in the
mountainous areas where the rebels are active. The anti-aircraft ma
terial, which was said to be more sophisticated than anything that
Nicaragua had received previously, could help to shoot down
supply planes that fly in from Honduras to drop ammunition and other
equipment by parachute to guerrillas inside Nicaragua.
"More sophisticated arms are being brought in now. One would
derive from this that they intend to step up the war against the contras,"
a knowledgeable foreign observer said. The guerrillas often are called
contras as shorthand for "counterrevolutionaries."
The new weapons were unloaded at the Caribbean port of El Bluff,
said the sources, noting that a security cordon was established there Oct.
26. The diplomats here did not specify whether the helicopters were
primarily designed for carrying troops or were specifically outfitted as
gunships.
There was no immediate comment here on American television
reports last night quoting intelligence or Pentagon sources as saying that
MiG warplanes were on a Soviet ship bound for Nicaragua.
Two senior diplomats here have said in the past four days that there
was no evidence that MiGs or other warplanes were en route.
Discovery set for today's liftoff
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — As its five astronauts received last
minute flight updates, crews prepared space shuttle Discovery for a lift
off this morning on a mission to chase and capture two satellites that are
whirling rround Earth in worthless orbits.
DLcove.'v was set to roar away from the Kennedy Space Center at
8:22 a.m. I T and predictions were for scattered clouds, "no chance of
fog," and ge. le winds.
During their eight days aloft, the astronauts will deliver two commer
cial satellites to space, then make daring space walks to snag the two er
rant satellites and iock them into the shuttle cargo bay for return to
Earth.
It will be the first time that satellites have been brought back for
repair. The technique for tracking them down was developed last April
when another crew swapped parts on the Solar Max satellite and
released it back into orbit. Commanding the mission is veteran shuttle
pilot Rick Hauck. Other crew members are pilot David Walker and mis
sion specialists Anna Fisher, Joe Allen and Dale Gardner.
Officers charged in priest killing
WARSAW, Poland — Three secret police officers were formally
charged yesterday with murdering Father Jerzy Popieluszko, who prob
ably died as a result of strangulation, the official Polish news agency re
ported.
Interior Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak said testimony from the three Se
curity Service officers indicated that Popieluszko "did not show any
signs of life" when they threw him into a Vistula River reservoir on the
night of Oct. 19.
Kiszczak's statement, delivered to a commission of the Sejm, Poland's
parliament, left open the possibility that the pro-Solidarity priest was
still alive but unconscious when the kidnappers disposed of him.
Col. Zbigniew Pudysz, director of the Interior Ministry's investigation
office, also told the Sejm's Commission on Internal Affairs and Justice
that the three officers had confessed to kidnapping and killing the 37-
year-old priest, Polish television reported yesterday evening.
Popieluszko was kidnapped on the night of Oct. 19 near the northern
city of Torun. Police divers recovered his body Oct. 30. The slaying of
the popular cleric set off a storm of public anger that has shaken the
leadership of Premier Wojciech Jaruzelski and prompted unusual can
dor for an East European government in its treatment of the case.
Stocks surge on Election Day
NEW YORK — Stocks surged ahead yesterday in surprisingly active

began in the United States nearly 200 years ago.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials spurted 14.91 to 1,244.15,
its highest point since Jan. 23, when it closed at 1,244.45.

Rajiv Gandhi meets with Sikhs
NEW DELHI, India — Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi said yesterday
that the assassination of Indira Gandhi, his mother and predecessor,
should not be blamed on India's community of 14 million Sikhs, already
battered by bloody communal rioting since the killing.
Striving to calm religious animosities that flared following the murder,
Rajiv Gandhi told a group of Sikh leaders that he believed the two Sikhs
identified as his mother's assassins were acting on their own.
"He told us it was not an act .. .by the Sikhs, but rather of two indi
viduals," said Delhi University Vice Chancellor Gurbaksh Singh. Both
of the alleged assassins were members of Indira Gandhi's personal se
curity force. Rajiv Gandhi's meeting with the Sikh leaders was part of
a government effort to accelerate aid to the Sikh community after
hundreds of Sikhs were killed by Hindu mobs who blamed members of
the small but influential religion for the assassination.
Doctors were fighting yesterday to save the life of one of the assassins,
Satwant Singh, as he lay heavily guarded in a hospital here with several
bullet wounds, hosptital authorities said.
Singh, a Delhi police constable in his late 20s, was rushed to the hospi
tal soon after he and another Sikh bodyguard, who was killed, had
gunned down Gandhi at her residence last Wednesday morning.
Meanwhile, the government said the first few Sikhs who fled their
homes during the riots had begun trickling back yesterday. But M.M.K.
Wa!i, the national government's home secretary, acknowledged that
more than 30,000 men. women and children remained in 12 makeshift
refugee camps and at least seven temples.
