RALEIGH, N.C. — Republican Sen. Jesse
Helms defeated Democratic Gov. James Hunt Jr.
in the long, bitter and costly Senate rate that Hunt
had called a referendum on the new right.
Helms claimed victory at 11:15 p.m. EST yester
day after his slim early lead grew to 55 to 45 per
cent over Hunt and Republicans swept the state on
President Reagan's coattails.
Long lines clogged North Carolina polling
places, and most metropolitan areas extended
voting one hour past the normal 7:30 p.m.
deadline.
The first precincts to report went to Helms by the
smallest of margins. As the votes came in, however,
the traditionally Democratic state went heavily Re
publican, voting not only for Helms and Reagan
but also electing James Martin as North Carolina's
first Republican governor in this century.
As hundreds of supporters chanted, "Jesse,
Jesse, Jesse," Helms told his jubilant supporters
that "the cruel hoax of liberal politics has run its
course for the last time."

Waving a copy of a year-old Washington Post
story reporting he was in political trouble. Helms
declared, "We have sent a signal through the world
that North Carolina is a conservative. God-fearing
state ... a state where people believe in school
prayer and they want to restore it.
"This is a state where people believe in the
sanctity of human life," Helms told the throng, "a
state that believes that bloated federal government
is a threat to freedom."
With his wife, children, grandchildren and his
black press secretary Claude Allen at his side.
Helms, 63, made an emotional plea to blacks who
had voted overwhelmingly against him. "I say to
the black citizens, whether or not you voted for me,
you have my handshake of sincere friendship."
Helms, the leader of New Right forces in the
Senate, and Hunt, who cast the race as a referen
dum on "right-wing extremism," have battled neck
and neck for months in the longest and most expen
sive Senate race in American history.
Exit polls of 2,500 North Carolina voters showed

Helms won a majority among whites, males aqd the
older and more affluent voters of the state. Hunt
carried the women's vote by 57 to 43 percent; he
captured a slim majority of voters age 49 and under
and won almost two-thirds of the poor votes.
Voters who called themselves born-again Chris
tians split 60 to 40 for Helms while those who said
they are conservatives went 3 to 1 for him.
Facing the toughest challenge of his career in his
bid for a third Senate term, Helms held a narrow
lead in public-opinion polls during the campaign s
closing days and consolidated his victory on the
overwhelming Republican triumph in the Tar Heel
State.
The victory reaffirmed Helms' role as the leader
of New Right conservatives — the nation's
foremost champion of anti-abortion legislation and
school prayer. For Hunt, 47, the defeat was a
serious setback for his effort to become one of the
Democratic Party's promising new leaders and a
spokesman for the New South.
