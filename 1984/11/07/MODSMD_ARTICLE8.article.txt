# Democrats gain in Senate
## Coattails not long enough 
### 
WASHINGTON — Despite in
cumbent Charles Percy's loss to
Democrat Paul Simon in a hotly con
tested Illinois race, the Republicans
were assured of continued — though
diminished — control of the Senate
after yesterday's voting in 33 states.
In other races, the GOP kept an
important seat with a hard-won vic
tory by Sen. Jesse Helms in North
Carolina, but this was offset by the
defeat of Sen. Roger Jepsen by Dem
ocratic Rep. Tom Harkin in lowa.
Republicans also gained a seat in
Kentucky, where Democratic Sen.
Walter Huddleston was upset by Re
publican Mitch McConnell.
Percy's loss meant the Democrats
would pick up two seats overall and
shrink the GOP's current 55-to-45
vote margin.
In Massachusetts, Democratic Lt.
Gov. John Kerry defeated conserva
tive Republican busisnessman
Raymond Shamie for the seat of
retiring Sen. Paul Tsongas (D-Mass.).
In Tennessee, Rep. Albert Gore Jr.
(D-Tenn.) beat Republican Victor
Ashe as expected to fill the seat of
Senate Majority Leader Howard
Baker Jr., who also is stepping down.
In West Virginia, Gov. John "Jay"
Rockefeller IV defeated Republican
John Raese, a Morgantown busines
sman and political unknown. But
Raese made a strong late surge "out
of nowhere" that appeared for a time
to threaten Rockefeller, who had
once seemed an easy successor to
retiring Democratic Sen. Jennings
Randolph.
Only in Texas did the Republicans
win an open seat. Although the
Democrats had once hoped to score
another breakthrough in Texas, Rep.
Phil Gramm, a Democrat-turned-
Republican, snatched an easy early
victory from state Sen. Lloyd Doggett
for the seat of retiring Republicn Sen.
John Tower.
In still another race that had bfeen
in question, in Montana, the
Democrats held off a Republican
challenge as Sen. Max Baucus
defeated Chuck Cozzens.
In Kentucky, Jefferson County

(Louisville area) Judge McConnell
beat Huddleston by several
percentage points.
Huddleston had been favored for a
third term, although Republicans
viewed McConnell as a strong dark
horse possibility and regarded him as
a bellwether for testing the strength
of President Reagan's'coattails in
Senate races. Reagan carried Ken
tucky with ease.
Relatively easy victories were won,
as expected, by Sens. John Warner,
(R-Va.); Sam Nunn (D-Ga.); Howell
Heflin (D-Ala.); David Boren Jr. (D-
Okla.); Bill Bradley (D-N.J.); Joseph
Biden Jr. (D-Del.); David Pryor (D-
Ark.); Claiborne Pell (D-R.1.);
Nancy Kassebaum (R-Kan.); Larry

Pressler (R-S.D.); Strom Thurmond
(R-S.C.); Thad Cochran (R-Miss.);
William Cohen (R-Maine); Rudy
Boschwitz (R-Minn.); Gordon
Humphrey (R-N.H.); Alan Simpson
(R-Wyo.); and Pete Domenici (R-
N.M.).
Elected to a third term even before
the polls opened was Sen. Bennett
Johnston (D-La.), who defeated two
politically unknown opponents six
weeks ago in the state's unusual non
partisan primary, in which any candi
date who gets 50 percent of the vote
is elected without having to run in
November.
Of the group of Southerners who
appeared headed for the easiest early
victories, only Mississippi's Cochran,

a freshman lawmaker who was the
first Republican to win a statewide
office since Reconstruction, had been
considered to be in potentially serious
trouble. He was opposed by former
Democratic governor William Win
ter, whom the Democrats had
counted on early in the campaign for
a possible upset.
New Hampshire's Humphrey, who
was elected six years ago as a staunch
conservative but veered toward the
political center as his re-election bat
tle approached, was an early target
for the Democrats. But their hopes
quickly faded despite a vigorous cam
paign by Rep. Norman D'Amours
(D-N.H.).

(R-Wyo.); and Pete Domenici (R-
N.M.).
Elected to a third term even before
the polls opened was Sen. Bennett
Johnston (D-La.), who defeated two
politically unknown opponents six
weeks ago in the state's unusual non
partisan primary, in which any candi
date who gets 50 percent of the vote
is elected without having to run in
November.
Of the group of Southerners who
appeared headed for the easiest early
victories, only Mississippi's Cochran,

a freshman lawmaker who was the
first Republican to win a statewide
office since Reconstruction, had been
considered to be in potentially serious
trouble. He was opposed by former
Democratic governor William Win
ter, whom the Democrats had
counted on early in the campaign for
a possible upset.
New Hampshire's Humphrey, who
was elected six years ago as a staunch
conservative but veered toward the
political center as his re-election bat
tle approached, was an early target
for the Democrats. But their hopes
quickly faded despite a vigorous cam
paign by Rep. Norman D'Amours
(D-N.H.).
