# Republicans narrow House gap

WASHINGTON — Democrats retained control
of the House of Representatives last night despite
modest Republican gains and President Reagan's
landslide re-election.
While Republicans appeared certain to increase
their ranks, Reagan did not demonstrate that he
had coattails long enough to match his 1980
showing when he was elected to his first term and
the GOP picked up 33 seats.
In addition, some Republicans conceded they
would fall short of their goal of regaining the 26
seats and ideological control of the chamber the
GOP lost in the 1982 elections.
Democrats had won 219 seats, for control, and
were leading in 31 more districts while Republicans
had the edge in 182. By 2 a.m. EST, the Republi
can potential gain appeared to be less than 20 seats.
In the old House, Democrats held a 266-167
lead, with two vacancies.

It was clear that Democrats would be operating
the House with a trimmed majority and legislative
battles over Reagan's agenda in a second term
would be close, particularly on issues such as the
MX nuclear missile and U.S. military aid for
Central America.
House Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill Jr., (D-
Mass.) dismissed the tidal wave that swept Reagan
to a second term saying it was not a mandate for
Reagan's conservative aganda but rather proved
"he is the greatest television artist we have ever
had. He is a very popular man."
"But the voters sent Democrats to Congress —
as a mandate to them, as a safety net for the Ameri
can public," O'Neill said.
The Massachusetts Democrat added that if it
becomes clear that increased taxes will be neces
sary to trim bulging federal budget deficits, Reagan

will have to take the lead.
O'Neill said any tax program in the new
Congress "will have to come from the White
House. We'll help him (Reagan) keep that prom
ise" not to raise taxes — a commitment that some
financial analysts say will be impossible to keep in
the face of the government's flood of red ink.
Republicans agreed that it would be difficult for
them to reassemble a conservative majority in the
House.
"We're not going to have effective control of the
place with those kind of numbers," said Michael
Johnson, a spokesman for House Republican
Leader Robert Michel of Illinois.
All Democratic and Republican leaders easily
won re-election.
