# Student relays overlap routes
## 
### FRANK LESTER Staff writer 
Two student groups that indepen
dently decided to hold charity relay
races to Berkeley to celebrate the Big
Game have come into conflict in their
efforts to solicit donations.
The trouble started on Sunday,
when Sigma Phi Epsilon member Jim
McVey found out that Donner House
was planning a relay race to benefit
the Ronald McDonald House. Sig
Ep, an off-campus, non-residential
fraternity, had been planning a relay
race of its own since the beginning of
the year. The Sig Ep race was also
targeted to provide funds for the
Ronald McDonald House, which pro
vides help for families of children un
dergoing specialized care at
Children's Hospital here.
Sig Ep and Donner relay planners
met at the beginning of the week to
agree on a scheme to split up the
dorms to which runners would go to
solicit money for their treks.
But last night Donner planners told
McVey that this scheme would be an
ineffective way of getting sponsors,

and McVey conceded to their plan to
solicit funds in a free-for-all fashion.
"If you're soliciting contributions
from a community, it's not good to hit
them too frequently. But the more
the merrier, I guess," he said.
He said he was frustrated over the
attitude of the Donner planners that
his fraternity is just in it for the
publicity. He said the first time he set
foot in the house to speak with the
planners, someone said something to
him "to the effect of, 'Getting money
for a keg?' "
"I suppose the advertising benefits
us, but even if we didn't get any ad
vertising, we'd still be doing it,"
McVey said.
McVey said Donner has a lot of en
thusiasm going for it in its efforts, but

he questioned the efficiency of its or
ganization. He said the Donner plan
ners told him on Sunday they would
have a table out in White Plaza all
week to help solicit donations, and
that they would share the table on al
ternating days with Sig Ep.
"I've been through there on my
bike all week, and I haven't seen any
table," McVey said.
McVey also expressed doubts
about whether the runners would
have enough time to cover the route
to Berkeley. Donner Freshman Drew
Erickson, however, expressed no
such doubts. "That'll be no problem.
We've got a schedule all figured out,"
he said.
McVey also expressed some con
cern over the difference in the sym
bolism of the objects the two groups
will use as relay batons in the run to
Berkeley. The Sig Eps will use a foot
ball — promoting harmony in an "all-
American" way between the rival
campuses, McVey said. Donner will
use an inflatable hot dog — or
"weenie," as Stanford students often
label a Berkeley student — and
people might misunderstand or
misinterpret the intent of that baton,
McVey said.
Erickson said, "Are they trying to
cut us down or something? That's just
the way this thing works." He de
scribed the "weenie" as a symbol of
the rivalry between the two schools,
comparing the carrying of the sausage
to the carrying of the Olympic torch.
McVey said he wondered whether
prohibitions against profanity on
television news would plague the
Donner group's efforts to get
publicity for the Ronald McDonald
House. "Can they say 'weiner' on
network TV?" he asked.
Sig Ep plans to start its race
at 6:30 a.m. on Nov. 16 at Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy's
home, McVey said.
Kennedy will run about nine-tenths
of a mile to begin the relay and will
pass on the football to the first frater
nity runner, McVey said. The race is
set to proceed up Palm Drive and
University Avenue through Palo Alto
and, via the Dumbarton Bridge, to
Oakland. Two miles later, Berkeley
Sig Ep runners will take up the race
and convey the ball to the Berkeley
Sig Ep House. The Berkeley runners
plan to relay the ball to the stadium
the morning of the game.
But while Sig Ep is planning a two
day journey, using 14 Stanford run
ners and 29 Berkeley runners, Don
ner plans to hold its entire race on the
morning of the game.

ners told him on Sunday they would
have a table out in White Plaza all
week to help solicit donations, and
that they would share the table on al
ternating days with Sig Ep.
"I've been through there on my
bike all week, and I haven't seen any
table," McVey said.
McVey also expressed doubts
about whether the runners would
have enough time to cover the route
to Berkeley. Donner Freshman Drew
Erickson, however, expressed no
such doubts. "That'll be no problem.
We've got a schedule all figured out,"
he said.
McVey also expressed some con
cern over the difference in the sym
bolism of the objects the two groups
will use as relay batons in the run to
Berkeley. The Sig Eps will use a foot
ball — promoting harmony in an "all-
American" way between the rival
campuses, McVey said. Donner will
use an inflatable hot dog — or
"weenie," as Stanford students often
label a Berkeley student — and
people might misunderstand or
misinterpret the intent of that baton,
McVey said.
Erickson said, "Are they trying to
cut us down or something? That's just
the way this thing works." He de
scribed the "weenie" as a symbol of
the rivalry between the two schools,
comparing the carrying of the sausage
to the carrying of the Olympic torch.
McVey said he wondered whether
prohibitions against profanity on
television news would plague the
Donner group's efforts to get
publicity for the Ronald McDonald
House. "Can they say 'weiner' on
network TV?" he asked.
Sig Ep plans to start its race
at 6:30 a.m. on Nov. 16 at Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy's
home, McVey said.
Kennedy will run about nine-tenths
of a mile to begin the relay and will
pass on the football to the first frater
nity runner, McVey said. The race is
set to proceed up Palm Drive and
University Avenue through Palo Alto
and, via the Dumbarton Bridge, to
Oakland. Two miles later, Berkeley
Sig Ep runners will take up the race
and convey the ball to the Berkeley
Sig Ep House. The Berkeley runners
plan to relay the ball to the stadium
the morning of the game.
But while Sig Ep is planning a two
day journey, using 14 Stanford run
ners and 29 Berkeley runners, Don
ner plans to hold its entire race on the
morning of the game.
