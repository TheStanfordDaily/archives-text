# U.S. still unsure about MiGs

WASHINGTON — As U.S. officials studied in
telligence data suggesting the Soviet Union might
be shipping MiG-21 jet fighters to Nicaragua, Pres
ident Reagan yesterday warned that he would
regard arrival of the planes as a serious matter and
"a threat" to Central America.
But in a post-election news conference in Los
Angeles, Reagan said the United States "cannot
definitely identify that they have MiGs on" a Soviet
freighter that left a Black Sea port a month ago and
reportedly arrived yesterday in Nicaragua.
Reagan also refused to say what the United
States would do if the ship does deliver the super
sonic fighter planes. Other administration officials,
who spoke only on condition they not be identified,
said the United States is considering possible air
strikes to destroy any such planes.
In Managua, Nicaraguan Foreign Minister
Miguel D'Escoto said a Soviet ship docked yester
day at Corinto, a port on Nicaragua's Pacific coast,
and unloaded cargo that did not include MiGs.
D'Escoto did not describe the cargo carried by
the Soviet ship but said the vessel had been
"harassed by a ship, fast launches and North Amer

ican planes that violated Nicaraguan waters."
Earlier, the Sandinista government flatly denied
that any ships were transporting combat planes to
Nicaraguan ports and accused the Reagan adminis
tration of laying the groundwork for direct U.S.
military intervention in Nicaragua. The Sandinistas
have been fighting for three years against ClA
backed rebels who have at times used U.S.-
supplied light planes to attack targets inside
Nicaragua.
"This is an attempt to prepare the atmosphere
for direct military attacks against our territory with
the participation of North American troops," the
Nicaraguan statement said.
Reagan said he would consider the Sandinistas'
obtaining MiGs a serious matter. "We have in
formed them that for them to bring something that
is absolutely unnecessary to them — these high
performance crafts in here — indicates that they
are contemplating being a threat to their neighbors
here in the Americas," he said.
In another development, State Department
spokesman John Hughes said U.S. officials have
reiterated to Soviet authorities both in Washington

and Moscow "the gravity of the statements we have
made" opposing Nicaragua's previously stated
plans to obtain MiGs.
A U.S. intelligence official cautioned that
satellite evidence about the purported MiG ship
ment is inconclusive.
"The ship could be carrying MiGs and it could be
carrying oranges," the official said. "The U.S. gov
ernment better know what it's going to do before it
jumps off the precipice."
American officials contend that the MiG-21s, if
combined with Nicaragua's new radar and anti
aircraft guns and a 50,000-man army, would clearly
give the leftist government the most powerful mili
tary in Central America. U.S.-supplied armies in
Honduras and El Salvador, equipped with
relatively slow-speed A-37 jets and UH-1H
helicopters, are now considered superior to
Nicaragua in air power but not in ground forces.
The MiG-21 is an advanced tactical jet fighter
designed for air-to-air combat. It has a normal
range of about 700 miles.
