## The 						Stanford Daily Keeping the fire alive 
### 
Tonight, especially, I think of the poor, the un
employed, the elderly, the handicapped, the help
less and the sad, and they need us more than ever.
Let us fight for jobs and fairness. Let us fight for
these kids and make certain they've had the best
education any generation has had. Let us fight for
our environment and protect our air, our water
and our land. And while we must keep America
strong, let's use that strength to keep the peace.
That has been my fight, that has been our fight
in this campaign, and we must fight for those goals
with all our hearts. We didn't win, but we made
history, and that fight has just begun.
We too, like Walter Mondale, are thinking
about the downtrodden of society. The only
groups that gave Mondale the majority of their
votes were the poor and minorities â€” 90 percent
of the black vote went to Mondale. For them, the
sting of Reaganomics has been particularly acute.
They can look forward only to four more years of
pain and misery.
We are also thinking of poor people around the
world. We fear for the future of the people in El
Salvador, Nicaragua, the Philippines and South
Africa. Now that these repressive governments
know that they have a friend in the White House

for four more years, they will continue to oppress
the people and brutally silence their cries for
freedom.
The task ahead is too urgent and too important
for us to waste time in mourning and despair. We
must look for the silver lining, smile through our
tears and move on. And believe it or not, there is
a silver lining.
In the final analysis, 1984 will not be remem
bered as the year of the Reagan landslide. It will
be remembered as the year when a disciple of
Martin Luther King, Jr. and the daughter of an
Italian immigrant broke down the doors of dis
crimination in national politics.
We at Stanford may hold our heads high. Wal
ter Mondale won here by 71 to 28 percent. While
60 percent of the nation's young people were
voting their pocketbooks, Stanford students
voted their consciences.
But we cannot be satisfied with merely casting
a ballot for Mondale. We must continue to work
for a peaceful world and a just society. The
people who suffer in America and around the
world do indeed "need us more than ever." Stay
aware and stay active. As Walter Mondale said
Tuesday night, "Fight on, fight on. The fight has
just begun."
