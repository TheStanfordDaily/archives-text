## Co-ops: a positive alternative 
### 
I admit it: 1 lived in a co-op, and I liked it. I will
admit living in a co-op even if some people on
campus, in their ignorance, might call me a sprout
brain or granola-head, because I know the advan
tages and joys of living in a Stanford co-op: great
savings over every other housing alternative on
campus or off, skills that will help me all my life,
satisfaction that results from knowing that my
friends and I have worked together to make some
thing meaningful and, most important, a lot of fun.
First, cooperative living saves the house residents
bucks — big bucks. Board at every co-op is less
than $300 for the entire 11-week autumn quarter.
To put that number in perspective, for the amount
of money a co-oper pays for one quarter, a dorm
resident couldn't buy food for one month. For your
$300, you get home-made dinners at least five
nights a week and a fully stocked kitchen that's
open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The bill of
fare varies from co-op to co-op: Theta Chi spe
cializes in greaseburgers and Captain Crunch while
Columbae traditionally serves vegetarian dinners
and organically grown food. If you happen not to
like the food served on one particular night, you
can always take some of the nearly $500 you are
saving that particular quarter and go to Jack in the
Box or Chez Panisse. And when you come back,
you can share in the warm, freshly baked bread that
most of the co-ops bake at least five nights a week.
Co-ops can offer their members such tremen
dous savings because they approach the problem of
living at Stanford completely differently than other
kinds of residences do. Rather than dividing people
into those who work for the house and those who
live in the house, a co-operative starts from the as
sumption that everyone who lives in the house
should also work to keep the house running effi

ciently. In this way, resources (and money) are con
served. Yet, as said above, this system also requires
people to work in the house, and work, as we all
know, takes time. Residents of co-ops, on the
average, spend about three hours a week in the
kitchen either preparing food, cleaning the kitchen
or baking bread. They also spend about 30 minutes
per week cleaning up the house, doing jobs like
vacuuming a hallway or cleaning a lounge. Quick
arithmetic shows that the residents of co-ops are
paid about $12.50 per hour for their time working
in the co-op.
Co-ops also start from the assumption that each
member should have an equal voice in determining
the policies of the house, and that the policies of
the house should be acceptable to everyone in the
house. In practice, this assumption usually means
that co-ops work by consensus, that is, everyone
has to agree on a house decision before the house
acts. Accordingly, the people in the house have a
lot of power in making the house into what they
want it to be, but again, it requires that they invest
more time in the house by attending house
meetings. At co-op house meetings, the members
decide what kind of food they are going to buy,
how they are going to divide up the work and wheth
er or not the bathrooms will be co-ed, for exam
ple.
Co-opers learn skills that will serve them the rest
of their lives. At a basic level, co-opers develop
their cooking and cleaning skills. These skills are
quite important. Sooner or later, we are all going to
have to cook for ourselves and clean our own
bathrooms. Why not get paid tp learn these skills?
More important, co-opers learn how to work to
gether. Every night on cook crew, for example,
three or four people face the monumental task of

preparing food for 50 people. These people have to
decide how they are going to divide the work. They
have to plan their time so the food comes out on
time. They often have to cope with emergencies,
like not enough tomato paste for the spaghetti
sauce. Co-opers learn management and leadership
skills by ordering food and planning menus for 50
people. Because co-ops operate by consensus and
because consensus requires that everyone agree,
co-opers also develop their listening skills.
Co-ops feel like home. By working together, and
in particular, by cleaning bathrooms together, co
opers soon become close friends. Moreover, by
working together, they create a strong, healthy
community. They feel the satisfaction and pride
that result from knowing that they have invested
their time and effort to improve the house and the
community. Because co-ops generally form strong
communities, the people are more supportive of
each other, and they throw great parties, too.
Finally, co-ops require a greater investment of
time than most other kinds of residences at Stan
ford. Co-op life provides great return on that in
vestment, however. Co-opers save about $1,400
each year over their counterparts in the dorms, in
addition to learning skills that will help them the
rest of their lives. More important, co-opers build a
strong, supportive community that helps make life
at Stanford more fun. If you're interested in co
operative life at Stanford, bring a meal exchange
card and come have dinner at one of the six co-ops:
Columbae, Hammarskjold, Phi Psi, Synergy, Terra
and Theta_Chi.

rest of their lives. More important, co-opers build a
strong, supportive community that helps make life
at Stanford more fun. If you're interested in co
operative life at Stanford, bring a meal exchange
card and come have dinner at one of the six co-ops:
Columbae, Hammarskjold, Phi Psi, Synergy, Terra
and Theta_Chi.

I admit it: 1 lived in a co-op, and I liked it. I will
admit living in a co-op even if some people on
campus, in their ignorance, might call me a sprout
brain or granola-head, because I know the advan
tages and joys of living in a Stanford co-op: great
savings over every other housing alternative on
campus or off, skills that will help me all my life,
satisfaction that results from knowing that my
friends and I have worked together to make some
thing meaningful and, most important, a lot of fun.
First, cooperative living saves the house residents
bucks — big bucks. Board at every co-op is less
than $300 for the entire 11-week autumn quarter.
To put that number in perspective, for the amount
of money a co-oper pays for one quarter, a dorm
resident couldn't buy food for one month. For your
$300, you get home-made dinners at least five
nights a week and a fully stocked kitchen that's
open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The bill of
fare varies from co-op to co-op: Theta Chi spe
cializes in greaseburgers and Captain Crunch while
Columbae traditionally serves vegetarian dinners
and organically grown food. If you happen not to
like the food served on one particular night, you
can always take some of the nearly $500 you are
saving that particular quarter and go to Jack in the
Box or Chez Panisse. And when you come back,
you can share in the warm, freshly baked bread that
most of the co-ops bake at least five nights a week.
Co-ops can offer their members such tremen
dous savings because they approach the problem of
living at Stanford completely differently than other
kinds of residences do. Rather than dividing people
into those who work for the house and those who
live in the house, a co-operative starts from the as
sumption that everyone who lives in the house
should also work to keep the house running effi

ciently. In this way, resources (and money) are con
served. Yet, as said above, this system also requires
people to work in the house, and work, as we all
know, takes time. Residents of co-ops, on the
average, spend about three hours a week in the
kitchen either preparing food, cleaning the kitchen
or baking bread. They also spend about 30 minutes
per week cleaning up the house, doing jobs like
vacuuming a hallway or cleaning a lounge. Quick
arithmetic shows that the residents of co-ops are
paid about $12.50 per hour for their time working
in the co-op.
Co-ops also start from the assumption that each
member should have an equal voice in determining
the policies of the house, and that the policies of
the house should be acceptable to everyone in the
house. In practice, this assumption usually means
that co-ops work by consensus, that is, everyone
has to agree on a house decision before the house
acts. Accordingly, the people in the house have a
lot of power in making the house into what they
want it to be, but again, it requires that they invest
more time in the house by attending house
meetings. At co-op house meetings, the members
decide what kind of food they are going to buy,
how they are going to divide up the work and wheth
er or not the bathrooms will be co-ed, for exam
ple.
Co-opers learn skills that will serve them the rest
of their lives. At a basic level, co-opers develop
their cooking and cleaning skills. These skills are
quite important. Sooner or later, we are all going to
have to cook for ourselves and clean our own
bathrooms. Why not get paid tp learn these skills?
More important, co-opers learn how to work to
gether. Every night on cook crew, for example,
three or four people face the monumental task of

preparing food for 50 people. These people have to
decide how they are going to divide the work. They
have to plan their time so the food comes out on
time. They often have to cope with emergencies,
like not enough tomato paste for the spaghetti
sauce. Co-opers learn management and leadership
skills by ordering food and planning menus for 50
people. Because co-ops operate by consensus and
because consensus requires that everyone agree,
co-opers also develop their listening skills.
Co-ops feel like home. By working together, and
in particular, by cleaning bathrooms together, co
opers soon become close friends. Moreover, by
working together, they create a strong, healthy
community. They feel the satisfaction and pride
that result from knowing that they have invested
their time and effort to improve the house and the
community. Because co-ops generally form strong
communities, the people are more supportive of
each other, and they throw great parties, too.
Finally, co-ops require a greater investment of
time than most other kinds of residences at Stan
ford. Co-op life provides great return on that in
vestment, however. Co-opers save about $1,400
each year over their counterparts in the dorms, in
addition to learning skills that will help them the
rest of their lives. More important, co-opers build a
strong, supportive community that helps make life
at Stanford more fun. If you're interested in co
