Return to reality
In response to Loren Borud's
question (The Daily, Nov. 6): "How
many of us can assess the plausibility
of nuclear scenarios, such as that
envisioned in the new Cold War flick
'Red Dawn'?" I would like to com
ment that a handful of high school
students organizing themselves into a
fully equipped and trained com
mando team in two weeks, blowing
up armored caravans and surviving a
winter in the Rockies without dis
turbing their hairdos is not my idea
of plausibility.
Second, Borud's command of the
"facts," i.e. acronyms and arsenal
sizes, should not lull anyone into
believing that "negotiatioi from a
position of strength" is a p thway to
peace. It's like trying to grasp a
slippery bar of soap in the bathtub:
The harder one squeezes, the faster
and faster it slips away. Continual
arms build-up will reinforce the
prevailing atmosphere of tension and

increase the chances of global dis
aster. A few hundred SLBMs is
enough for me for the time being!

Tactics helped union
Why are so many surprised by the
overwhelming vote for Local 680? It
is difficult to lose when both sides
push for the same result. By taking
every possible legal advantage the
University managed to make the
union an underdog. Maximum pro
ductivity with a union comes from
cooperation, not confrontation.
Confrontation forces the union to
quantify its issuesinto money, the
only medium legally available. An
experienced administrator can tell
you that money is the scapegoat, not
the issue. Workers want a company
that listens, one that hears criticisms
and suggestions and acts upon them;
that is, cooperation.

I know. I was once the industrial
engineer in charge of Time Study
(the worst bogeyman of the unions)
for a company of 3,500 people.
When the union called a strike —
ostensibly for money but actually for
recognition — it was the only strike
I've heard of where Time Study was
not an issue! Typically, the manage
ment never understood why not.
In 20 years at Stanford, I have
watched the confrontational tactics
of Hoover Tower bring the union
into being, push it into strikes and
attempt to stamp it out. All totally
unnecessary.

The man on the crate
I had the following thoughts
during a recent farewell visit to
campus. The beauty of the institution
is that one can get an education in
addition to, and occasionally in spite
of, the schooling.

The terrific resources available at
Stanford are only minutely
represented by Nobel laureates and
widely published faculty. The oppor
tunity to rub minds and elbows with
folks ranging from fundamental
Christians to brilliant atheists,
European royalty to Mexican
grounds-keepers, aspiring
entrepreneurs to perspiring activists,
et cetera ad glorium — all in a
benign and beautiful environment —
is too precious to waste.
An effort to really expose yourself
to the thoughts and prejudices of
people markedly different from you
cannot but be valuable, by either
directing you in a more "correct"
way or by confirming your long-held
but now-challenged ideas.
Try not to squander your youth or
your privilege. And please return all
milk crates to dairies. Goodbye.
