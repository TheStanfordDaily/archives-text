## Equal opportunity in the military 
### 
I am writing to comment on Prof. Londa
Schiebinger's statements that appeared in "Panel
Eyes Military Funding" (The Daily, Oct. 31).
Schiebinger is quoted as saying, "Where military
funding is high, the amount of women are low."
The article also implies that Schiebinger believes a
correlation exists between the low number of
tenured female professors in the Department of

VIEWPOINT

Engineering and the high level of military funding
received by the department. She also argues that
military funding "reinforce(s) domination of men
over women." As a student at Stanford and as a
captain in the United States Air Force, I find
Schiebinger's statement offensive â€” both as a wo
men and as a professional. My objections and
reasons for my objections follow.
First, I would like to address Schiebinger's state
ment, "Where military funding is high, the amount
of women are low." Although I would not classify
myself as an amorphous part of an "amount of wo
men," I am one of a number of active-duty Air
Force women obtaining master's degrees here at
Stanford. Four of the five Air Force women on

campus are in the School of Engineering. It appears
to me that the government is spending a consider
able sum on women who are in technical fields.
Next, I would like to question Schiebinger's cor
relation between low numbers of tenured female
engineering professors and high levels of military
funding. 1 have no argument with her assertion that
the Department of Engineering employs few wo
men professors. However, I believe this is due not
to the level of military spending but to the number
of experienced women in engineering fields. The
tremendous surge of women entering engineering
is a fairly recent phenomenon. If you consider the
number of years required to complete a Ph.D. in
engineering and obtain the necessary experience to
become a tenured professor, then I am not at all
surprised to find few tenured professors in the De
partment of Engineering. Most women have not
had time to obtain the necessary credentials. I
surmise that the Department of Defense chooses to
give research funds to Stanford's Engineering De
partment because the department has a proven
reputation as a research institution, not because the
department has a dearth of women on its faculty.
Schiebinger's assertion amounts to nothing more
than post hoc ergo propter hoc logical fallacy.

Finally, I would like to comment on
Schiebinger's statement that military funding
"reinforce(s) those values ascribed to men" and
"reinforce(s) domination of men over women."
The first statement clearly indicates that
Schiebinger belives society's values can be neatly
divided into those "ascribed to (by) men" and
those ascribed to by women. Implying that values
can be divided by sex is itself sexist. After four
years as a female member of the military, I believe
the military has neither forced me to adopt "male
values," nor caused men to dominate me. In any
case, I fail to see how military funding could spur
either of these occurrences.
I realize that Schiebinger is entitled to her
opinion. However, I ask her to examine her facts
more carefully before generalizing about the mili
tary. I believe no correlation exists between the
number of tenured women engineering professors
at Stanford and the amount of military funding. As
a woman and as an officer, I am very proud to serve
my country in an organization where equal oppor
tunity is a way of life.
