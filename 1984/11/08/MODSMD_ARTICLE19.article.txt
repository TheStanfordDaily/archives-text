## The
						Giants belong in Stanford Stadium 
### 
The Giants have been for sale for
more than a month now and have had
no takers so far. The Stanford Ath
letic Department is having financial
problems, and the football team is fil
ling up Stanford Stadium only half
way.
Solving these Bay Area problems is
apparently too obvious for San. Fran-

VIEWPOINT

cisco sports authorities. So I'll offer
my own solution. Move the Giants to
Stanford Stadium and let them play
day games.
Yes, this may be another crazy sug
gestion to add to the list. But it sure
sounds interesting. And realistic.
A baseball field would fit into Stan
ford Stadium with some minor ad
justments. Home plate at the open
end of the stadium. First and third
base lines would fit up to the 50-yard
line.
Replace the much-maligned
benches with portable seats for the
other 50 yards and add portable seats
to the far end of the stadium.
Baseball capacity would be 50,000,
and football capacity would be unaf
fected.
New locker rooms are already in
place for the Super Bowl, and field
level dugouts can be put in.
Baseball season is from June until
September. Stanford Stadium is cur
rently vacant during this time. The
Stanford football team comes for
preseason tryouts in late August. But
90 percent of its practices, both
preseason and in season, are not in
the stadium.
Stanford can schedule its first home

game for late September — when all
the students are back at school. Why
have home games before school
starts?
Who would go watch the Silicon
Valley Giants? Well, for one, this
area does not have its own profes
sional sports team. A professional
baseball team in suburbia is not unus
ual. There are more suburban
located stadiums in pro baseball than
there are city ones.
And the drive from Candlestick to
Stanford is only 15 more minutes for
city people. The weather is 15
degrees warmer. Add all the potential
fans from the Silicon Valley area, and
you have a more than sufficient base
of fans.
Day games in broad daylight would
ease security. And what's better for
suburban kids or college student*
than an afternoon at a baseball game
during the idle times of summer?
The Giants are perfect for Stan
ford. But is Stanford for the Giants?
The University would not spend a
dime on the Giants. The new owner
of the Giants would.
In fact, Stanford could only gain
from the situation. Lease the stadium
to the Giants and get a part interest in
the team for giving them a home.
Stanford's share of ownership would
only matter during profitable times.
Moving the Giants to Stanford
Stadium would present no financial
risk to the University — only finan
cial gain. And it's a chance to help
the Athletic Department by filling up
the stadium for more than four Satur
day afternoons in the fall.
