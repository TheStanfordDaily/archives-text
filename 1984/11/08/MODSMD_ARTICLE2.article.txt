# A 						bone of contention
## Professor's poll probes Cold War conflict 
### BILL BARENBOIM 
In August 1983, the Soviets shot
down a Korean jetliner, and Presi
dent Reagan called the Soviet Union
the "focus of evil in the modern
world."
At Stanford, psychology doctoral
candidate Scott Pious decided to find
out how much people actually know
about U.S.-Soviet confrontations
over the past 35 years. He contacted
his faculty advisor, Psychology Prof.
Philip Zimbardo. Together they
prepared a "Conquest Test" in which
10 major military actions involving
the United States and the Soviet
Union are depicted without identify
ing labels.
The first four test questions
describe well-known Cold War con
flicts, selected by History Prof. Bar
ton Bernstein. The other six questions
test a more general knowledge of the
arms race.
The test was distributed in the July
issue of Psychology Today magazine
and triggered 3,500 responses. The
results of the 10 questions appeared
in the magazine this month, revealing
that readers averaged only 4.9 correct
answers. In other words, the
likelihood of knowing which super
power initiated a conflict was about

the same as that of accurately predict
ing the flip of a coin.
The result of the "Conquest Test"
supports the 25-year-old psychologi
cal phenomenon which Pious called
the "mirror image." Politics and ac
tions which the United States con
siders "defensive" might actually be

perceived as aggressive by Soviet
leaders â€” or Psychology Today
readers.
For instance, the survey asks
readers to identify the superpower
that withdrew from further talks on a
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty after

25 years of negotiations. Only 29 per
cent of Psychology Today respon
dents knew the superpower was the
United States; the Reagan adminis
tration broke off the talks in July,
1982.
The survey also asks readers to
identify the superpower that has con
ducted more than 40 percent more
nuclear tests than its counterpart.
Fifty-two percent of the respondents
knew that the Soviet Union has con
ducted more nuclear tests than the
United States.
Pious said he was surprised that
"the confidence factor of the answer
had absolutely nothing to do with the
results." In other words, the reader's
confidence had virtually nothing to
do with the accuracy of the answers.
The 56 people who were able to an
swer nine or more questions right
were no more confident than other
respondents who were less successful.
The average age of the respondents
was 39, with an almost equal number
of men and women, according to the
survey. More than 90 percent of
those who responded were registered
to vote; 44 percent as Democrats, 27
percent as Republicans and 29 per


Philip Zimbardo
cent as independent or members
of other parties.
1 he survey also revealed that

about 75 percent of the readers
polled had completed college or
graduate school. These respon
dents were not true representa
tives of most U.S. citizens, but
were more politically involved and
somewhat better educated, ac

cording to Zimbardo.
In general, men did somewhat
better and were more confident
than women. More women
thought that the United States and
the Soviet Union were equally ag
gressive.
