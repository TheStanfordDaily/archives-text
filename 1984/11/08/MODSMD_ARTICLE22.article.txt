## Students aid students through Heritage Fund 
### TINA-MARIE BASKIN 
Many know that Stanford's policy is to admit students
on the basis of academic achievement and leadership po
tential without any regard to their ability to pay, but few
know of the extreme commitment of those who work be
hind the scenes of student financial aid.
The efforts of Heritage Fund's student volunteers are
exemplary as well as necessary. Since 1955, the Heritage
Fund has served as a vital organization to the University.
As the costs for education at Stanford continue to rise,
new and increased sources of financial aid are essential
and Heritage Fund helps keep Stanford accessible to
students who otherwise could not attend. \
The monies that Heritage Fund raise are awarded by
the University to freshmen and sophomores who have
great leadership potential as well as a real need for finan
cial help.
"The Heritage Fund began as a senior project and it has
now spread to members of all classes who are interested in
helping others," said Director Rick Hoskins, a senior.
"The staff is basically composed of seven students who
form the board of directors — the rest is a volunteer net
work open to all students."
The Heritage Fund, as a student-directed and student
staffed organization, is uncommon. In fact, "There are
only two other projects, the senior telethon and the senior
pledge, that are student run as this is," said Hoskins.
The Fund provides the opportunity for students to par
ticipate in University fund raising and to interact with
members of the business and professional community.

Senior Jim Chesnutt, who got involved with the fund
two years ago, is now a member of the board. "If your're
interested in business and even if you aren't, the experi
ence tjiat you can gain from meeting with other profes
sionals as a student can certainly be carried over into any
job area after graduation."
This year the Fund is determined to raise $60,000. The
Robert Stewart and Helen Pfeiffer Odell Fund will now
match, dollar for dollar, gifts from new donors and those
that have not given in the past five years.
"What we are doing this year is trying to expand the
number of people to solicit in order to get a higher rate of
return," Hoskins said.
"What happens is that interviews are set up with, say, the
president of some large corporation. We meet with him
and then he introduces us to other companies by a letter
explaining our procedure. It's a kind of foot-in-the-door
thing."
Junior Lynette Wong, another board member, stresses
the importance of getting involved. "There are lots of
areas that a person can help out. Right now there are
about 90 students working through the volunteer pro
gram. What we do is set up a little business. A director will
ask 10 to 12 people to be his team. He or she takes them
through a training program which teaches them about the
business world," she said.
Wong said that she has a more personal allegiance to
the organization. "I know when I was accepted to Stan
ford I was slightly worried as to finances; it's really nice to
know that there are programs such as this."
