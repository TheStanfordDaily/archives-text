Twins: Twice the Trouble, Twice
the Fun.
This phrase, in addition to being a
book title, also sums up the presence
of twins here on campus.
The trouble comes for those at
tempting to distinguish between
twins who look very much
alike. The fun comes for twins and
their friends once the initial recogni
tion has been made, or even when it
hasn't.
A twin myself, I am partial toward
multiple births; however, since my
twin is a brother, nobody has
confused the two of us lately
(although in my younger tomboy days
. . .). This story originated with
thoughts of Larry in the rainforest up
at the University of Washington.
Meeting juniors Sue and Carolyn
Dinapoli provided further incentive
for this journalistic adventure. To
gether these effervescent dynamos
made up the "transportation twins"
during frosh orientation. One prob
lem: For clueless friends such as
myself, the two were virtually
impossible to tell apart. In fact, we
were reduced to checking their ear
lobes: Sue wore pearl earrings, and
Carolyn wore the hoop variety.
Fortunately, I no longer have to

rely upon this method, but the experi
ence made me wonder about what it
is like to be mistaken often for some
one else.
To abate my curiosity, I began my
quest for first-hand information from
sets of twins themselves. One of the
first things I learned was that name
confusion can be fun for identical
twins.
"The whole past-time of being a
twin is fooling others," sophomore
Pam Tansey said. "April Fool's Day
is our (her's and twin Pat's) special
holiday, though we try to confuse
people all the time. One of us is not
going to go punk rock to help others
tell us apart."
The Dinapolis also have fun with
their similarities. "When someone
doesn't get off our case about being
twins, we'll both try to confuse them
just to put them back into perspective
(yes, we are related, yes our parents
can tell us apart, and yes 1 do know
that I am Sue)," said Sue.
Looking alike can have other
benefits than playing tricks, senior
Tirra Austin said. "As a twin I get to
meet twice as njany people because
they think that they know me when
they really know my sister. When
they make the mistake we get to
know their face, and eventually we

learn their name and get to know
them."
Disadvantages come with
similarities as well. "Our

freshman year a whole lot of people
thought we were being rude when we
didn't know them," Pam said. "Some
people gave up calling us anything

until they realized that we each had a
twin."
Sometimes it's just easier to smile
and wave than to explain when they

are mistaken for each other, ac
cording to all the twins with whom I
spoke. "If people do confuse us (her
and sister Annie), we don't say any

luniors Carolyn and Sue Dinopoli (or is it Sue and Carolyn?) pondered their twinship, and they decided that they like the lifestyle.
