Twins: Twice the Trouble, Twice
the Fun.
This phrase, in addition to being a
book title, also sums up the presence
of twins here on campus.
The trouble comes for those at
tempting to distinguish between
twins who look very much
alike. The fun comes for twins and
their friends once the initial recogni
tion has been made, or even when it
hasn't.
A twin myself, I am partial toward
multiple births; however, since my
twin is a brother, nobody has
confused the two of us lately
(although in my younger tomboy days
. . .). This story originated with
thoughts of Larry in the rainforest up
at the University of Washington.
Meeting juniors Sue and Carolyn
Dinapoli provided further incentive
for this journalistic adventure. To
gether these effervescent dynamos
made up the "transportation twins"
during frosh orientation. One prob
lem: For clueless friends such as
myself, the two were virtually
impossible to tell apart. In fact, we
were reduced to checking their ear
lobes: Sue wore pearl earrings, and
Carolyn wore the hoop variety.
Fortunately, I no longer have to

rely upon this method, but the experi
ence made me wonder about what it
is like to be mistaken often for some
one else.
To abate my curiosity, I began my
quest for first-hand information from
sets of twins themselves. One of the
first things I learned was that name
confusion can be fun for identical
twins.
"The whole past-time of being a
twin is fooling others," sophomore
Pam Tansey said. "April Fool's Day
is our (her's and twin Pat's) special
holiday, though we try to confuse
people all the time. One of us is not
going to go punk rock to help others
tell us apart."
The Dinapolis also have fun with
their similarities. "When someone
doesn't get off our case about being
twins, we'll both try to confuse them
just to put them back into perspective
(yes, we are related, yes our parents
can tell us apart, and yes 1 do know
that I am Sue)," said Sue.
Looking alike can have other
benefits than playing tricks, senior
Tirra Austin said. "As a twin I get to
meet twice as njany people because
they think that they know me when
they really know my sister. When
they make the mistake we get to
know their face, and eventually we

learn their name and get to know
them."
Disadvantages come with
similarities as well. "Our

freshman year a whole lot of people
thought we were being rude when we
didn't know them," Pam said. "Some
people gave up calling us anything

until they realized that we each had a
twin."
Sometimes it's just easier to smile
and wave than to explain when they

are mistaken for each other, ac
cording to all the twins with whom I
spoke. "If people do confuse us (her
and sister Annie), we don't say any

thing unless they ask," senior Amy
'Smith said. Wendy Tansey agreed,
"Sometimes it's just not practical to
stop and explain the situation, it all
depends upon the circumstances."
What about the desicion to attend
the same university as a twin? It
surprised me somewhat that in each

of the twin sets, they decided inde
pendently.
"I knew Carolyn had wanted to go
to Stanford since day one of the ap
plication process . I was debating
about another school but I finally
wised up and realized that Stanford
was it," Sue said. "Carolyn was so un

derstanding. She never put pressure
on me to follow her; she wanted me
to choose what was best for me and
not what was best for us. However,
deep down inside I think we're both
pretty happy. I would most definitely
make the same decision again."
Carolyn agreed with her sister.
"We each made our decisions on our
own. Deep down inside I think we
both hoped we'd end up at the same
school, but neither one of us was will
ing to admit that to the other."
Pam and Pat followed the same
pattern as the Dinapolis. "Originally
we were going to different schools no
matter what, but we made distinctly
independent decisions to go to the
same school," Pam said. "I wanted to
go here the whole time, and Pat
narrowed her list down to two schools
before choosing Stanford.
"It's helpful to have Pat nearby;
with the exception of one night, we
have never been apart [outside the
same general area] in our lives. If we
hadn't come to the same school, we
would have had tremendous phone
bills."
Once they arrived on campus,
though, the paths of the twin sets with
whom I spoke have varied tremen
dously. Each has a different perspec
tive on the effect that being a twin has
had upon her here.
Amy and Annie are known to
many around campus for their
country singing duet, a musical com
bination that postponed their
matriculation into Stanford for two
years as they toured and sang to
gether. After college, they plan more
of the same. "We want to continue
our career together, probably sing on
cruise ships for a while around differ
ent parts of the world," Amy said.
It is not unusual to see the Smiths

dressed similiarly on the same day,
something that they recognize but do
not regard as unusual. "It's not a big
deal to appear different; we know we
are, so we don't have to prove it to
anybody," said Amy, who rooms with
Annie in a triple this year.
"I think it's a shame when twins
feel that they must strive to be differ
ent. In a sense that is limiting them
because both can have abilities with
out others deciding that one twin is
better than the other. The constant
comparisons of twins are unfortunate.
Why can't each be his own individual
just as regular brothers or sisters are?"
Tirra and Wendy each enjoy the
other's company on campus but par
ticipate in many activities which take
them apart. They are both resident as
sistants, but in Roble and Wilbur,
respectively. "Having a twin on
campus is a lot like anyone else who
has a relative on campus, but there are
exceptions," said Wendy.
One of these exceptions is due to
their play on the lacrosse team, ex
plained Tirra. "Our physical
similarities add an additional confus
ing element for opposing players;
they have to be more careful about
the player that they are marking. In
that way, it is a helpful similarity."
Pam and Pat are in "constant com
munication" but are establishing
their own identities. "Eighteen years
of living together is enough. It's time
to get to know others," said Pam.
"We still share with each other;
everything I do, she knows and vice
versa, but we don't room together or
anything like that."
Sue and Carolyn both believe that
any disadvantages of having an
identical twin on the same campus are
outweighed by the advantages.
"Working around the disadvantages
make us stronger independent

beings," said Sue.
She continued, "We can watch
each other do our own things and can
always be there for support and en
couragement. She is a blast to be with
and we can jam around together at
any time. It's also neat to know that
there's someone on campus who

knows you so well and feels for you.'
Carolyn echoes her sister's senti
ments, adding, "It's also convenient
to have someone to share sweaters
with at short notice. Having a twin is
the most wonderful gift that anyone
could ever have. I wouldn't give up
being a twin for anything."

Twins: Twice the Trouble, Twice
the Fun.
This phrase, in addition to being a
book title, also sums up the presence
of twins here on campus.
The trouble comes for those at
tempting to distinguish between
twins who look very much
alike. The fun comes for twins and
their friends once the initial recogni
tion has been made, or even when it
hasn't.
A twin myself, I am partial toward
multiple births; however, since my
twin is a brother, nobody has
confused the two of us lately
(although in my younger tomboy days
. . .). This story originated with
thoughts of Larry in the rainforest up
at the University of Washington.
Meeting juniors Sue and Carolyn
Dinapoli provided further incentive
for this journalistic adventure. To
gether these effervescent dynamos
made up the "transportation twins"
during frosh orientation. One prob
lem: For clueless friends such as
myself, the two were virtually
impossible to tell apart. In fact, we
were reduced to checking their ear
lobes: Sue wore pearl earrings, and
Carolyn wore the hoop variety.
Fortunately, I no longer have to

rely upon this method, but the experi
ence made me wonder about what it
is like to be mistaken often for some
one else.
To abate my curiosity, I began my
quest for first-hand information from
sets of twins themselves. One of the
first things I learned was that name
confusion can be fun for identical
twins.
"The whole past-time of being a
twin is fooling others," sophomore
Pam Tansey said. "April Fool's Day
is our (her's and twin Pat's) special
holiday, though we try to confuse
people all the time. One of us is not
going to go punk rock to help others
tell us apart."
The Dinapolis also have fun with
their similarities. "When someone
doesn't get off our case about being
twins, we'll both try to confuse them
just to put them back into perspective
(yes, we are related, yes our parents
can tell us apart, and yes 1 do know
that I am Sue)," said Sue.
Looking alike can have other
benefits than playing tricks, senior
Tirra Austin said. "As a twin I get to
meet twice as njany people because
they think that they know me when
they really know my sister. When
they make the mistake we get to
know their face, and eventually we

learn their name and get to know
them."
Disadvantages come with
similarities as well. "Our

freshman year a whole lot of people
thought we were being rude when we
didn't know them," Pam said. "Some
people gave up calling us anything

until they realized that we each had a
twin."
Sometimes it's just easier to smile
and wave than to explain when they

are mistaken for each other, ac
cording to all the twins with whom I
spoke. "If people do confuse us (her

thing unless they ask," senior Amy
'Smith said. Wendy Tansey agreed,
"Sometimes it's just not practical to
stop and explain the situation, it all
depends upon the circumstances."
What about the desicion to attend
the same university as a twin? It
surprised me somewhat that in each

of the twin sets, they decided inde
pendently.
"I knew Carolyn had wanted to go
to Stanford since day one of the ap
plication process . I was debating
about another school but I finally
wised up and realized that Stanford
was it," Sue said. "Carolyn was so un

derstanding. She never put pressure
on me to follow her; she wanted me
to choose what was best for me and
not what was best for us. However,
deep down inside I think we're both
pretty happy. I would most definitely
make the same decision again."
Carolyn agreed with her sister.
"We each made our decisions on our
own. Deep down inside I think we
both hoped we'd end up at the same
school, but neither one of us was will
ing to admit that to the other."
Pam and Pat followed the same
pattern as the Dinapolis. "Originally
we were going to different schools no
matter what, but we made distinctly
independent decisions to go to the
same school," Pam said. "I wanted to
go here the whole time, and Pat
narrowed her list down to two schools
before choosing Stanford.
"It's helpful to have Pat nearby;
with the exception of one night, we
have never been apart [outside the
same general area] in our lives. If we
hadn't come to the same school, we
would have had tremendous phone
bills."
Once they arrived on campus,
though, the paths of the twin sets with
whom I spoke have varied tremen
dously. Each has a different perspec
tive on the effect that being a twin has
had upon her here.
Amy and Annie are known to
many around campus for their
country singing duet, a musical com
bination that postponed their
matriculation into Stanford for two
years as they toured and sang to
gether. After college, they plan more
of the same. "We want to continue
our career together, probably sing on
cruise ships for a while around differ
ent parts of the world," Amy said.
It is not unusual to see the Smiths

dressed similiarly on the same day,
something that they recognize but do
not regard as unusual. "It's not a big
deal to appear different; we know we
are, so we don't have to prove it to
anybody," said Amy, who rooms with
Annie in a triple this year.
"I think it's a shame when twins
feel that they must strive to be differ
ent. In a sense that is limiting them
because both can have abilities with
out others deciding that one twin is
better than the other. The constant
comparisons of twins are unfortunate.
Why can't each be his own individual
just as regular brothers or sisters are?"
Tirra and Wendy each enjoy the
other's company on campus but par
ticipate in many activities which take
them apart. They are both resident as
sistants, but in Roble and Wilbur,
respectively. "Having a twin on
campus is a lot like anyone else who
has a relative on campus, but there are
exceptions," said Wendy.
One of these exceptions is due to
their play on the lacrosse team, ex
plained Tirra. "Our physical
similarities add an additional confus
ing element for opposing players;
they have to be more careful about
the player that they are marking. In
that way, it is a helpful similarity."
Pam and Pat are in "constant com
munication" but are establishing
their own identities. "Eighteen years
of living together is enough. It's time
to get to know others," said Pam.
"We still share with each other;
everything I do, she knows and vice
versa, but we don't room together or
anything like that."
Sue and Carolyn both believe that
any disadvantages of having an
identical twin on the same campus are
outweighed by the advantages.
"Working around the disadvantages
make us stronger independent

beings," said Sue.
She continued, "We can watch
each other do our own things and can
always be there for support and en
couragement. She is a blast to be with
and we can jam around together at
any time. It's also neat to know that

ing element for opposing players;
they have to be more careful about
the player that they are marking. In
that way, it is a helpful similarity."
Pam and Pat are in "constant com
munication" but are establishing
their own identities. "Eighteen years
of living together is enough. It's time
to get to know others," said Pam.
"We still share with each other;
everything I do, she knows and vice
versa, but we don't room together or
anything like that."
Sue and Carolyn both believe that
any disadvantages of having an
identical twin on the same campus are
outweighed by the advantages.
"Working around the disadvantages
make us stronger independent

beings," said Sue.
She continued, "We can watch
each other do our own things and can
always be there for support and en
couragement. She is a blast to be with
and we can jam around together at
any time. It's also neat to know that
there's someone on campus who

knows you so well and feels for you.'
Carolyn echoes her sister's senti
ments, adding, "It's also convenient
to have someone to share sweaters
with at short notice. Having a twin is
the most wonderful gift that anyone
could ever have. I wouldn't give up
being a twin for anything."
