## Jason Cole Rules made to be changed 
### 
As the end of the college foot
ball season nears, a great many
questions are starting to arise.
Such as, who's going to be No.
1? Who's going to win the Pacific
10 Conference, the Big Eight, the
Big Ten or the Southwest? Who's
going to get bowl bids to which
bowls?
Then, after all the bowls are
over and everybody sobers up
from the holidays, another series
of questions will begin. Which big
high-school star is going to go to
which big powerhouse school?
Where is Johnny Thunderfeet
going to shine his glimmering tal
ent?
But the question that no one
will ask is, "Can Johnny read?"
At least, no one used to ask that
question. But now the National
Collegiate Athletic Association
seems to be on the verge of chang
ing that circumstance.
Assuming that there are no
changes made at the NCAA
meetings in the meantime, which
is making a big assumption, on
Aug. 1, 1986, a new rule will go
into effect which will try to assure
that some minimum standards are
met by incoming student-athletes.
Those standards are a 2.0
grade-point average in a core cur
riculum comprised of English,
mathematics, social sciences and
natural or physical sciences, as
well as an aggregate score of 700
on the Scholastic Achievement
Test or 15 on the American Col
lege Test.
If the student-athlete doesn't
meet these standards, a school can
still give him or her a scholarship,
but he or she can't play as a fresh
man. He or she can play during the
following year as long he or she
has fulfilled the academic require
ments of the school and the
NCAA.
Looking at these requirements
from the high tower of academia,
they seem moderate to say the
least. Such assurances would mean
that student-athletes would be
able to handle the rigors of col
lege.
But these seemingly moderate
standards may actually be rather
difficult for some student-athletes
to achieve. That is a frightening
thought.
It is not so frightening that
schools are admitting students
who can't achieve these standards,
but that these same schools are ad
mitting them and demanding that
they practice and play football
during their freshman years.
I'm not trying to say that a 700
SAT and a 2.0 GPA are the magi

cal numbers between someone
who is capable of college-level
work and someone who is not, but
the line has to be drawn some
where.
Certainly that is a very low line,
too. If a student can't achieve a
700 SAT, then there is something
truly wrong with his or her abili
ties, and those abilities should be
improved with rigorous help.
So in 1975, the NCAA adopted
this rule and then amended it to
the present version in 1982. The
strange thing about this is the
rule is not going to go into effect
until 1986, by which time the rule
could be completely changed.
Why do I think this change will
occur? As Prof. Jack Friedenthal,
who is the Stanford representative
to the NCAA, explained, "Every
time we get a rule with some teeth
in it, a group of schools will get to
gether and reduce its power."
The first effort to do this has
been started by a company called
Advanced Technology, which sub
mitted a report entitled a "Study
of Freshman Eligibility Stand
ards" in August of this year.
The major point was that such
standards are prejudicial since
they affect black students much
more than white students. Thus,
the major conclusion of the study
was that such standards should not
be adopted.
The second effort may come
from other schools. "I think that
schools are afraid that if a student
can't play during his freshman
year that he'll go to junior college
or turn pro. That those great
players won't want to go to college
and they'll lose out on a great
player," Friedenthal said.
Schools may not want to give
scholarships to players who won't
be able to play right away. It
doesn't make sense to spend
money on someone who can't
make money for the school.
Right?
Wrong. In fact, both efforts are
wrong.
Even if the rule does have prej
udicial results, the intent of the
rule is to improve the education
for all. No matter what the
student-athlete's color, if he or she
can't score a 700 SAT, he or she
needs a great deal of help.
Also, if an athlete is good
enough and really wants to go to
school, then somebody is going to
spend the money. And if the ath
letes don't really want to go to
school, then the schools should
stop pretending that they are
giving these kids a great opportu
nity.
