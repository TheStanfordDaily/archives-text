# Men's soccer
## At last, Card offense produces 
### DARREN THORNEYCROFT Staff sportswriter 
After allowing Cal Poly San Luis
Obispo back into the game late in the
first half, the Stanford men's soccer
team used two second-half goals to
regain control and beat the Mustangs
4-2 in a nonconference match yester
day.
In front of nearly empty stands at
Maloney. Field due to cold tempera
tures and rain, the Cardinal, 10-7-3
this season, scored four goals for the
first time this season, led by senior
forward Giancarlo Ferruzzi and
junior forward Todd Rafalovich, who
had a goal and an assist in the game.
The play was not particularly
sloppy, despite field conditions that
were. The constant drizzle did not
seem to affect either team's play.
The Mustangs, 7-9-4, controlled
the first three minutes of play, taking
a number of shots at Cardinal
goalkeeper Willy Burkhardt, but
Stanford seemed to put the game out
of reach early after goals by Ferruzzi
(assisted by Todd Rafalovich and
senior fullback Charlie Crane) at the
four-minute mark and junior Rob
West three minutes later.
Stanford continued to control
much of the play at both ends of the
field until about 10 minutes were left
in the half, when Cal-Poly came alive
to score two quick goals before inter
mission.
Sophomore midfielder Patrick
Sheehy said the rain may have been a
factor in the Mustangs' comeback. "It

was a combination of things," Sheehy
said. "Slippery conditions ... and
they got lucky." Junior fullback Phil
lip Horvath said, "We got up 2-0 and
just kind of let up. It was a mental
lapse — we just didn't want to put it
away."

After the first-half scare, however,
Stanford seemed to regain its concen
tration and again controlled most of
the play. Tom Rafalovich, a junior
fullback, scored on a header from a
Ferruzzi cross at the 63rd minute on a
well-executed set play. The Car

dinars final goal came after a skillful
buildup which strung together about
seven one-touch passes and cul
minated with junior fullback Marshall
Monroe's perfect pass to Todd
Rafalovich, who blasted the ball by
Mustang goalkeeper Don Aquiar.
"We did it for the Gipper," joked
senior fullback Tom McGannon, who
has helped anchor the Cardinal
defense this year, referring to Presi
dent Reagan's re-election Tuesday.
Ferruzzi now has seven goals and
10 assists this season for 24 points,
leading the team in scoring. West and
Tom Rafalovich have six goals each,
and Todd Rafalovich has five.
Monroe's and Crane's assists were
their first points of this season.
Both team's goalkeepers were kept
busy during the match. Stanford took
17 shots on goal, while Cal Poly at
tempted 14. Aquiar finished with
seven saves, most of them on dives to
parry dangerous shots by the Card
inal. Burkhardt, playing the first
half, had three saves, and sophomore
Tom Austin had four saves, including
three diving saves of Mustang shots.
Austin has been replacing
Burkhardt in the second half during
the last four games. Coming in cold
doesn't bother Austin, however. "It's
really not that hard coming into the
game in the second half," he said. "It
depends on the first couple of saves."
Austin has allowed one goal in five
halves of action this season and has
made 11 saves. Austin will battle
sophomore Alan Branson for the
starting spot next season.
