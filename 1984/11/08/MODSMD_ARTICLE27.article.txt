# Warm-up meet for swimmers
## 
### INGRID SEYER Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford women's swimming
and diving team will open its regular
season competition today as it hosts
San Jose State, the University of the
Pacific and Fresno State at 2 p.m. in
DeGuerre Pool.
The Cardinal swimming team,
which finished second in last year's
National Collegiate Athletic Associa
tion Championships, should once
again be a top contender, according
to Stanford Coach George Haines.
"We have a very well-rounded
team and we are looking forward to a
very successful season," Haines said.
"Today's meet is really low-key; we
try to schedule these three teams
every year at this time to give them a
chance to travel here and swim at
Stanford and to give us a chance to
warm up for the rest of the season."
In last year's meet, Stanford
defeated San Jose State 117-19, the
University of Pacific 124-12 and

Fresno State 124-12. Despite their
somewhat low scores, the three visit
ing teams possess strong individual
competitors in several events, Haines
said.
Sophomore Susan Rapp, a 1984
Olympic silver medalist in the 200-
meter breaststroke, is expected to be
one of the Cardinal's top swimmers
this year, although she is presently
plagued by an injured knee and may
undergo surgery in the near future.
Injuries are nothing new to the team
this year, as Haines will testify.
"We have already lost our top
backstroker, junior Libby Kinkead,
for the entire season due to a
shoulder injury, " Haines said. "If we
lose Susan, too, we will have lost our
two top point-winners."
Although the divers have not been
beset by any such injury problems,
they have been lacking in other areas
during their pre-season practices.
