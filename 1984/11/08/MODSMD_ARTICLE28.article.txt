## Aztecs down No. 1- ranked Card 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford women's volleyball
team, the nation's top-ranked team,
lost its second WCAA match of the
season last night when it was upset at
San Diego State University, 15-5, 9-
15, 15-9, 15-11.
The Aztecs, now 8-3 in the West
ern Collegiate Athletic Association
and 28-13 overall, came in "prepared
to play and forced a lot of mistakes"
out of the Cardinal, according to
Stanford Asst. Coach Don Shaw.
Stanford has been No. 1 in the Tach
ikara Coaches Poll for the last two
weeks. The Cardinal is still in first
place in the WCAA with a 10-2
record and is 13-3 overall.
"It just wasn't our night. We were
about due," Shaw said. Against San
Diego State, Stanford had a .180
team hitting percentage, as compared
to a season average .279. The Aztecs
hit .257 as a team.
According to Shaw, Stanford did
not block effectively. The Cardinal
may also have had difficulty with its
transitions since setter Wendi Rush
was out of the line-up in the second
and third games.
"People were out of position, and

there were a lot of missed assign
ments," Shaw said. Rush suffered an
ankle injury against UCLA last week
and was also taken out midway
through Stanford's match against Cal
State Long Beach Tuesday night.
In her absence, the Cardinal had to
switch to a formation with which the
team is not as familiar. Barbra Fon
tana was moved to the right hitting
postion, and freshman Teresa Smith
came in to hit.
Due to the switch, Stanford had
difficulty running its plays smoothly,
according to Fontana. "We struggled
throughout the match with our
plays," she said. "We were able to
make the transitions against Long
Beach, but it just didn't work
tonight."
Fontana also credited the loss to
the Aztec's home-court advantage.
"San Diego State played really well,
but we're not used to playing on the
road yet. The home crowd helped
them a lot." San Diego State had a
crowd of a 1,000 for its last home
game.
Leading the Cardinal offensively
was middle blocker Bobbie Broer
with 14 kills and a .458 hitting
average.
