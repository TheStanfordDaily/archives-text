# Teacher knocks demise
## 
### ERIC HEALY 
"America has experienced a demise of excellence . . .
especially in education," Marva Collins told an audience
of about 150 in Kresge Auditorium last night.
Collins, the Teacher of the Year who turned down an
offer to be President Reagan's secretary of education, as
sessed the cause of this "demise" as a "general careless
ness and nonchalance in America which has permeated
the classroom." She cited "lack of caring in teachers" as
the most pressing problem in education facing this
country. As an initial solution, Collins proposed that
American educators "stop resting on their past laurels" by
eliminating "remote-controlled" methods of teaching.
She encouraged all teachers to become "confidantes" to
their students by making them "feel like human beings
again." ,
She continued on the importance of individual caring in
school systems, saying that unless love and personaliza
tion is brought back into American education, it will not
have an effective bearing on today's youth.
As an example of how children should be educated,
Collins referred to the West Side Preparatory School in
New York, which she owns and supports. She said all of
her teachers consider their students, as she does, to be
"tall candles simply needing a wick."
She then appealed to the audience "not to let the
candles of excellence flicker away in America" by "losing
themselves in something greater than themselves . . .
recarving and resculpturing education."
Collins said she has realized great satisfaction in
"accepting the challenge of improving education. I
wouldn't do anything else for all the money in the world,"
she said.
