# No pub in sight on Farm

### MARY YUH Staff writer 
The age-old question of why Stanford doesn't have a
pub on campus may make great cocktail-party conversa
tion, but it certainly isn't being discussed by the University
powers that be.
Nanci Howe, assistant director of Tresidder Union, says
there might be a need for a campus pub, but Tresidder has
neither the funds nor the inclination to start one. Besides,
she says,"I see no difference between the Coffee House
and a pub in terms of service, except that the Coffee
House has a better selection of food than the average pub.
"Perhaps the perception of the people is different, but
over the years, with it being student-run, it has evolved
into a pub.
"It's one thing to say, 'Let's have a pub.' It's another to
support research into finding out what kind of demand
there is for one," Howe says.
And if you're looking for a good, stiff drink on campus,
the only place on campus is the Faculty Club. And Don
Carlson, director of University relations, says he can't
think of anyone who has seriously considered building a
bar here.
Howe points out that it's important to distinguish be
tween bars and pubs. A pub is licensed to serve only beer
and wine; a bar requires a hard-liquor license, which
enables it to serve bourbon, gin, vodka, and other liquors.
Few campuses have bars, and the ones that do are in states
where the drinking age is 18 or 19.
According to Howe, there isn't a single bar on any
campus in California, and because of legislation that
would punish states which do not raise their drinking ages

to 21, college administrators are reluctant even to plan the
opening of pubs, much less bars.
Some students say there's no need for a bar because
beer and wine are vastly more popular among the students
than hard liquors.
Peter Spivack, a former member of the Council of
Presidents, says a student bar at Stanford "would not be
looked upon with too much favor by the administration.
They wouldn't want to see students turn into alcoholics.
They probably wouldn't think it in the best of academic
tradition."
But a pub may be another matter. Several years ago
students expressed interest in a campus pub, and Encina
Station was opened during weekday evenings. Howe says
it closed because "the customer base just wasn't there.
Students just weren't partying on a Monday or Tuesday
night." Encina still serves beer and wine on the weekends.
But according to several students and former students,
Encina Station did not succeed because the location and
atmosphere were unfavorable. "It doesn't look very
pubby," Spivack says."It looks like a big hall and it's
tucked away. It simply wasn't popular."
Senior Marcie Maloney agrees. "It's not really warm
and inviting, the way you imagine a pub would be." In ad
dition she feels a campus pub is unnecessary. "The
Goose is just off-campus and it's rs»l!v popular. On any
night you can find 35 Stanford stuat.» f*-' there."
Some graduate students say they'd welcome a pub. As
one business student puts it,"The Coffee House is won
derful, but a pub would be great, too. Just having another
place to gather together would be good. People get tired
of going to the same place all the time."
