# University plans for Centennial
## 
### BRYAN WALSER 
Ninety-nine years ago this Sunday, the original Stan
ford trustees gathered in San Francisco to read the found
ing grant of the University.
To mark this occasion and others leading up to the
placing of the cornerstone in 1891, the ASSU Council of
Presidents has formed a student-run Centennial Commis
sion in charge of planning festivities and overseeing long
range research plans.
The commission consists of two subcommittees â€” one
for planning and the other for historical research, accord
ing to junior Bob Honeycutt, chair of the commission.
The planning subcommittee will be working with such
diverse groups as the Axe Committee, the University Ar
chives and the library system to initiate and coordinate ac
tivities celebrating the centennial. The research subcom
mittee will be involved in directing historical research by
undergraduates and will also work in setting up a course in
Stanford history, proposed for Autumn Quarter 1985.
The commission hopes to make the community more
aware of events that have shaped the nature of higher
education and the character of Stanford in particular, ac
cording to Honeycutt.
University President Donald Kennedy last year formed
a presidential centennial commission to plan the six-year
celebration. Honeycutt said the ASSU commission will
focus more specifically on student activities.
"Awareness of and interest in Stanford history is on the
rise," Honeycutt said. "What better way to understand
the education we receive here at Stanford than through
the study of the perennial debate on the purposes of
higher education and through an understanding of Stan
ford intellectual, social and political history."
In addition to Honeycutt, Hubert Cheng, Megan
Levitan, Susan Goodhue, and Carol Ajemian sit on the
planning subcommittee. COP member Alice Wells is ser
ving as ex-officio member.
