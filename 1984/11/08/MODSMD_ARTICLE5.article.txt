# Fewer blacks enter Med School
## 
### CAMERON KALLER Staff writer 
Black student enrollment at Stan
ford Medical School fell sharply this
year; with only 10 students offered
places in the school, eight chose to go
elsewhere and two deferred their en
rollment for a year.
"For whatever reasons, there were
only about half the rate of admissions
to minority students as in previous
years, and then only half of the usual
rate accepted our offers," according
to Raymond Clayton, director of ad
missions at the medical school.
"Between those two factors, obvi
ously we should come out with only
25 percent - ."
Roger Peeks, assistant dean for
student affairs and co-chair of the
minority advisory panel, which
reviews applicants and makes recom
mendations to the admissions com
mittee, said one way for Stanford to

attract more minorities is to address a
"misperception" about the school's
clinical programs, which some say do
not have the clinical emphasis that
they should.
To better deal with the situation,
the school will try to emphasize how
broadly based the clinical program
here really is, Clayton said.
Stanford has within its reach an ar
ray of health-care delivery services, in
cluding the Veteran's Administration
Hospital, the Palo Alto Clinic and the
Stanford Hospital's highly technical
surgery care facilities, he said.
"We've been close to a 20-percent
average of minority students for a
long time," Peeks said. "Our record
shows us enrolling more minorities
than any other (medical) school ex
cept for all-black schools, and we've
always been proud of that."
Clayton said he doesn't "really
know how" the number of black stu

dents entering the medical school
decreased this year. "There was no
attempt to upgrade or be more strin
gent in our standards of admission.
We obviously want to get as many
well-prepared black students as we
can."
With Chicano students, the picture
was a little better. "There was a
slightly smaller number, but it was
reasonable," Clayton said.
Of the 11 minority students enroll
ing this year, six are Chicano, three
are Native American and two are
black, both deferrals from last year.
Eighteen minority students entered
the medical school last year.
"There was more of a spread to the
(University of California) schools,
and to Harvard," Peeks said.
There is also a concern over the
cost of tuition. "Financial aid here is

very liberal; nevertheless, when faced
with the choice of Stanford or (the
University of California at San Fran
cisco), for a Californian, it's a fraction
of the cost to go to San Francisco,"
Clayton said.
Peeks disagreed, saying the fact
that students choose cheaper medical
schools does not explain the sudden
drop in enrollment. The price differ
ence existed last year, too, "But we
were successful in maintaining our
affirmative-action record," he said.
"People tend to look at the school
as just represented by the Stanford
Medical Center and sometimes don't
appreciate the range of other facilities
available in San Jose and other
nearby places," Clayton said.
"We clearly need to get more ac
ceptances this next year," Peeks said.
"However, we've had a bad year,
which might scare some people off."
