Voter turnout increases slightly
WASHINGTON — For the first time in 20 years, voter turnout in
creased in a presidential election. The increase, however, was well under
1 percent, far less than than might have been suggested by this year's
massive voter-registration drives.
Although all the votes have not been counted, experts estimated that
between 92 million and 92.5 million votes were cast, or between 52.8
and 53.1 percent of the voting-age population. In 1980, 52.6 percent
voted, the low point in a steady decline since 1960.
1 he turnout figures show that Democrats failed by a wide margin to
achieve their goal of 100 million voters in 1984.
Although turnout, when calculated as a percentage of the total popu
lation over 18, increased, it declined when calculated in terms of the
number of people who are registered to vote.
A preliminary study by the Committee for the Study of the American
Electorate found that turnout among registered voters fell sharply, from
75.2 percent in 1980 to 72.4 percent on Tuesday. In 1960, 83.4 percent
of those registered actually voted.
I he decline in turnout among registered voters suggests that the $20
million or more that was spent on voter registration for this year's elec
tion succeeded in registering large numbers of people, but that many of
them failed to go to the polls on Election Day.
ABC exit polls showed that new voters supported President Reagan
over Democratic candidate Walter Mondale by a margin of 61 to 39,
compared to a 57 to 43 margin in favor of the president among those
who had voted in prior elections.
The exit poll of more than 11,000 voters showed that blacks and
Hispanics increased their percentage of the electorate only slightly,
despite major efforts to increase registration among the two groups.
From 1980 to 1984, the percentage of voters who were black grew from
8 to 9 percent, while the number who were Hispanic grew from 2 to 3
percent.
Newsweek: Secret tax plan exists
WASHINGTON — The Reagan administration has a secret plan to
raise taxes known as the November Project, but President Reagan hasn't
seen it yet, Newsweek magazine reported yesterday.
In a special post-election edition of the magazine, Newsweek reported
that the November Project is a tax simplification plan co-authored by
Budget Director David Stockman and assistant to the president Richard
Darman.
Newsweek said that the plan "would be packaged as 'revenue-neutral'
but almost surely would simplify taxes upward."
The plan, Newsweek said in a news release describing the magazine
article, "is to be submitted to Reagan within two weeks of his re
election."
The November Project, the article said, was in existence shortly after
the Democratic National Convention in San Francisco, where Reagan
challenger Walter Mondale said that Reagan had a secret plan to raise
taxes.
"There was a secret plan, as it happened, although Reagan had not
then accepted it or even seen it,"the article said. "It was called the No
vember Project, and it reposed in a set of ring binders in Darman's of
fice, awaiting the president's inspection within a fortnight of his re
election."
Bomb ruled out in tanker blast
SAN FRANCISCO — Investigators are discounting the theory that a
bomb caused the explosions last Wednesday that shattered an oil tanker
10 miles from the Golden Gate Bridge, Coast Guard officials said Tues
day.
A Coast Guard spokesman confirmed reports that a preliminary in
vestigation indicated that the explosions started in a small cavity beneath
the deck of the Puerto Rican. The area was within sight of ship's officers,
' making it unlikely that someone could have planted a bomb.
Meanwhile, an oil slick from the tanker reached the Farallon Islands, a
wildlife sanctuary off the coast, and there were reports of oil-covered
birds.
The explosions, which left one person missing and presumed dead and
nine people injured, is being investigated by the Coast Guard and the
FBI.
The tanker broke into three parts over the weekend. The stern sank
during a storm, a middle section was towed to Oakland and the bow
remains at sea. Investigators inspected the bow Monday.
Winds force launch postponement
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — Ferocious crosswinds, packing enough
power to dangerously damage the space shuttle in its climb to orbit,
forced a one-day postponement yesterday to the start of Discovery's
satellite rescue mission.
Officials rescheduled the liftoff for 7:15 a.m. EST today but that, too,
depended on the capricious winds. The weather had improved suffi
ciently by evening that NASA ordered launch crews to refill the ship's
half-million-gallon tank, which had been emptied after the scrub.
Meanwhile, in Washington yesterday, NASA announced that Sen.
Edwin "Jake" Garn (R-Utah) has accepted its invitation to take a ride
on the space shuttle, possibly pre-empting White House intentions to
have a teacher make the first citizen flight.
Garn, 52, has more hours as a pilot than all but one of the current
astronauts and has sought openly the first congressional space junket.
As chairman of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee that over
sees NASA's budget, his suport is critical to the agency's hopes to put an
$8 billion space station in earth orbit in 1992.
In August, during the just-concluded election campaign, President
Reagan ordered NASA to carry an elementary or secondary school
teacher into orbit aboard the shuttle as the nation's first citizen space
passenger.
Tutu has message for U.S. blacks
WASHINGTON — South African Bishop Desmond Tutu, winner of
the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize, called on American blacks yesterday to
"get your act together" and pressure the Reagan administration to sup
port South African blacks in their fight to end that government's apar
theid policy.
Tutu, receiving an honorary degree from Howard University, urged
blacks to emulate Jews and Poles in influencing U.S. policy toward their
homelands.
"Get your act together so that you can be as effective and as powerful
a lobby as, for instance, the Jewish community, so that no U.S. adminis
tration can be in collaboration with the perpetrators of the system of
apartheid," he advised.
At a ceremony in which he was awarded an honorary doctorate of
humane letters, Tutu was hailed by Howard University President James
Cheek as the "dramatic symbol" of resistance by the African majority to
apartheid, a policy by the white minority government of strict racial
segregation and discrimination.
In his remarks, Tutu compared apartheid to other totalitarian systems
such as communism and Nazism. Like Nazism, he said, it has established
a "biological attribute, skin color," as a determining factor affecting
where and how people live — and even where they are buried.
Nevertheless, he warned, the struggle will continue despite the South
African government's attempts at suppression. The conflict can end, he
said, only if the government agrees to share power with blacks.
Reagan win doesn't help stocks
NEW YORK — Stock prices dropped in active trading yesterday, dash
ing any hopes investors had of a Wall Street celebration after President
Reagan's victory in the election.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had climbed 27.50
points Monday and Tuesday to a nine-month high, dropped back 10.93
to 1,233.22.
Yesterday's showing seemed to confirm the view expressed by many
analysts that a Reagan victory at the polls had been fully anticipated by
the market before the results were in.
Today's weather
Partly cloudly today with morning showers. The high will be in the up
per 50s to mid 60s.
