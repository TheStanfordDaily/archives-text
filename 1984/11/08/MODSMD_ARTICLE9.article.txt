# Reagan sees signal in win
## 
### 
President Reagan said yesterday
that his unrivaled electoral landslide
proves voters want second-term pro
grams like those of his first four years
and vowed to "take our case to the
people" if the new Congress blocks
his conservative course of spending
cuts and tax reform.
Reagan looked ahead to a new
term as vanquished rival Walter
Mondale offered congratulations a
half a continent away. But Mondale
made no attempt to mask his differ
ences with the president, and said
Reagan needs to change course, or "I
think the American people are going
to be very angry."
Even some GOP leaders said
smaller-than-expected gains in the
House would mean problems for the
president. House Republican leader
Robert Michel of Illinois suggested
Reagan could have done more to
campaign for congressional candi
dates.
Reagan read the returns differ
ently, telling reporters at a morning

news conference that by the verdict,
the voters "made it plain they ap
proved what we're doing and ap
proved of the fact that things are bet
ter and the economy is expanding and
that's what we're going to continue to
do."
He repeated his belief that the
federal budget is "larded with fat,"
and said he would press for overhaul
and simplification of the tax laws that
"would not result in any individual
having his taxes raised."
But at his own day-after news con
ference in his home state of Min
nesota, Mondale predicted, "One of
the biggest meals of crow this admin
istration will eat — and there will be
several — is this one concerning reve
nues."
As for his own future, Mondale
said he has no plans to run for presi
dent "or any other elective office
again" and intends to resume practic
ing law.
Despite Reagan's overwhelming
personal triumph — final popular

vote totals showed him with
S3 314,171 or 59 percent, to
Mondale's 36,862,510, or 41 percent
— even the GOP wondered where
the coattails went.
Final returns showed the
Democrats picking up two seats in the
Senate, shaving the GOP majority
there to 53-47. With just a handtul of
races undecided in the 435-member
House, the trend indicated
Republicans would emerge with a
gain of fewer than 20 seats.
The GOP gains were well below
the 30 or 35 they were hoping for and
had calculated they would need to
reassemble the coalition with conser
vative Democrats that passed
Reagan's tax and spending cuts in
1981.
House Speaker Thomas "lip
O'Neill, Jr., who will lead the
Democrats in the new Congress, said
he saw no mandate for Reagan's con
servative agenda.
Senate Democatic Leader Robert
Byrd of West Virginia predicted the

president would have problems i n t h e
Senate but that there would be a brief
"honeymoon period" when Cong ress
convenes next year.
In the end, Reagan won 49 states
and an unprecedented 525 of
electoral votes, while Mondale
captured the District of Columbia
and his home state of Minnesota.
Three incumbent senators were
voted out of office. Democrat Walter
Huddleston was defeated by Mitch
McConnell in Kentucky. Republican
Charles Percy of Illinois, chairman of
the Senate Foreign Relations Com
mittee, lost to Rep. Paul Simon, while
Roger Jepsen of lowa was defeated
by Rep. Tom Harkin.
GOP Sen. Jesse Helms won a new
term in North Carolina after the most
costly campaign in Senate history,
defeating Gov. James Hunt.
Democrats Albert Gore Jr. in T en .
nessee, John Kerry in Massachusetts
and John Rockefeller in West Vir
ginia won open Senate seats.
