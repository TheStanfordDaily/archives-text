## Jazz artist looks toward world culture 
### TED HUTMAN 
Even now, as it becomes increasingly diffi
cult to reconcile politics and the arts, there is a
Stanford employee who describes his involve
ment in the two endeavors as interdependent.
Jon Jang, who works for the University's
Inter-Departmental Mail, is a jazz pianist
whose strong political concerns manifest
themselves in a unique style of music.
Jang graduated from Oberlin College in
1978. He was tired of the cultural snobs' em
phasis on traditional, occidental music and he
began to phase out his piano playing. "I don't
go where there's art for art's sake. I think that
music has to be a part of your life," he said.
Working at Stanford, Jang involved himself
with United Stanford Workers (USW) as a
union activist. In this capacity, he came into
contact with other ethnic minorities. He saw
the struggles of various national movements
toward cultural and political freedom. He
realized a purpose for his music and recorded
his first album.
Released in June, 1982, "Jang" is a "kind
of a documentation of some of the work that
I d done at Oberlin, he said. His second al
bum, "Are You Chinese or Charlie Chan?"
was released this March. Exposing anti-
Asian racism and violence, it is dedicated to
the Asian National Movement.
Jang parallels this movement with the
African National Movement of the 19605, using
it as a historical backdrop and adapting its
musical style, jazz. Like the African move
ment, the Chicano movement and the Puerto
Rican movement, the Asian movement is a
struggle for unity. This idea is brought out in
Jang's new group, Multinational Unit-E, a
play on the word unite, sounding like unity.
"Also, 'E' means energy or endurance like

Vitamin E. Energy . . . describes the sound of
our music, also endurance ... is about how
we're going to be around here for a long time
and it's about a protracted struggle" to
change society and survive in it.
Multinational Unit-E takes an active stand
in the fight against racial and cultural oppres
sion in several ways. Jazz music in itself is a
statement of resistance "because it is systema
tically being taken away" by lack of support,
Jang said. Combining African and American
styles of music, jazz is a symbol of ethnic ac
culturation in this country. But Jang com
plained that as an art form, it is not accessible
to most people. It is a major goal of the unity
movement to have the message of this kind of
art reach a bigger audience.
Multinational Unit-E works toward this
goal by associating its name with various poli
tical causes. Most recently, the group ap
peared at a benefit rally called "Jazz Against
Reagan!" at the New College of San Francisco.
The rally censured Reagan for "playing the
role of the white slave master who took away
the drum from the African people for fear
that it would incite rebellion."
The other major goal of the group is ethno
centrism, which it aims to achieve by combat
ing the narrow-minded acceptance of the
belief that modern thought was inspired only
by wealthy, white. Western European males.
To this end, they perform Sunday in the
Tresidder Union Lounge at 8 p.m. in a theme
concert entitled "Toward a World Culture."
Jang said he is hopeful for the success of his
cause and that he believes that society has the
necessary energy to overcome the evils that it
faces and that through music, he can tap that
energy. "The function of music," he said, "is
to raise people's consciousness and ... to
transform cynicism into optimism."
