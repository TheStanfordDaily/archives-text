## The 						Stanford Daily A 						good trade 
### 
A great idea whose time has come.
That's probably the best way to describe efforts
by Stanford, Vanderbilt, Harvard and Brown, as
well as the Ford and Carnegie Foundations, to
create legislation that would forgive all or part of
students' federal loans if they work in public
service fields.
The legislation would be modeled after existing
programs that exchange financial obligations for
government service — such as programs for doc
tors, teachers and former servicemen — and
would reward students for service to "particular
populations," including "the elderly, handi
capped and poor," according to Susan Stroud, a
Brown administrator working on the project.
The proposal finally would make public service
a good financial choice for graduating seniors.
Many college students who may be inclined to

do public-sefvice work also have college loan
debts to consider when seeking employment.
Those faced with the burden of paying off hefty
loans within months of graduation are likely to
look for jobs that pay more than the average
social-service position.
Currently, the only way to exchange work for
study with the government is through the mili
tary. In addition to having academies, all three
service branches offer four-year Reserve Of
ficer Training Corps scholarships.
Students who want to donate their time to so
cial service, instead of military service, currently
have none of these opportunities. Ihe proposed
public-service legislation would give them one.
Students need to pay off their loans and we all
need good public servants. It's a good trade.
And a great idea.
