## Ronald Reagan: We ain't seen nothing yet 
### 
Why did Ronald Reagan win?
Ronald Reagan won because he ran a cam
paign based on voodoo economics, happytalk
and some bear that he said was supposed to
be in the woods.
Ronald Reagan won because after the eco
nomy became terrible, when it got bad again
it looked pretty good.
Ronald Reagan won because white people
don't like the fact that black people are voting
for Democrats.
Ronald Reagan won because the people
who did his commercials were the same
people who did the Pepsi commercials.
Ronald Reagan won because his policies
are so scary that people didn't want to believe
they were for real.
Could Mondale have won with a Southern
good ol' boy instead of Ferraro? Could Fer
raro have won with Hart instead of Mondale?
I doubt it. The election was not a comparison
of charisma (which Hart would have lost
anyway); more than anything else, it was a
contest of ideologies, which have their own
definite material and psychological bases.
Anyone running a traditional Democratic
campaign would have suffered the same
defeat; and anyone with the proper acting and
public-relations experience could be Reagan.
The names could be changed without protect

ing the innocent.
The only thing that could have saved the
Democrats, and the thing they need if they
plan on being a credible political force into
the next century, is a credible ideology of
their own.
I'm not talking about high-tech neo
liberalism in which blacks and labor unions
become "special interests." Those "new
ideas" are mainly a blueprint for becoming a
minority party, since there aren't, really, that
many yuppies in America.
What the Democratic Party needs is a pro
gram that shows that the poor and the
working class have not only compatible inter
ests, but the same interests. That is the only
thing that will save the Democratic coalition.
And I can't see this taking any form other
than a movement explicitly opposed to cor
porate power.
"Class-struggle campaigns are atavistic,"
the Wall Street Journal said on Election Day.
Often reactionaries have a much clearer
picture of what's going on than liberals, but in
this case I think it's wishful thinking. To bor
row a line from the Grim Communicator:
"You ain't seen nothing yet."
The fight for preservation of welfare has to
become instead a militant drive for full em
ployment, which is going to require state in

tervention. The Democratic Party is going to
have to identify with, not just tolerate, libera
tion movements like the Sandinistas and the
African National Congress. The political
structure itself will have to change to elimi
nate corporate funding as the most important
determinant of who gets political power.

We thought they were
chanting 'four more
beers'

Will the Democrats do these things? Not
unless they're forced to.
"Four more years." At the Mondale-
Ferraro-Carnoy "victory" party I attended we
thought they were chanting "four more
beers." But after the alcohol wears off you
realize that you are facing another term of the

lunatic fringe in charge of state policy.
Predictions would be dangerous if anyone
ever bothered to look up what you said would
happen. But I feel safe in making a few
guesses:
A recession is coming between now and
1986, and probably sooner rather than later.
It will be worse than 1982. Maybe not as bad
as 1929.
Reagan will be up to some extreme nasti
ness in Central America. The right wants the
Sandinistas out and the Salvadoran guerrillas
crushed. And as Reagan stated when he was
governor of California, he has no aversions to
a bloodbath.
The American people will be very disap
pointed in 1986 when they find out that
Reaganomics amounts to nothing more than
kicking the TV set to fix the vertical hold, and
that we're the ones who are going to have to
do the standing tall, fighting peasants in the
Third World.
And so, in the next congressional elections,
you can expect the Republicans to lose con
trol of the Senate and to lose enough seats in
the House to put them back to where they
were before 1980. But these gains, however
welcome they may be in checking the right
wing crusade, will not bring any lasting
changes to our society or create a permanent

power base for progressive movements.
The German sociologist Jurgen Habermas
writes about something he calls "formal
democracy." This is the situation when the
role of the citizen has been reduced to casting
a ballot every four years. This is called formal
democracy because it's democracy in name
only.
Real democracy means participation in the
decisions that affect our lives. Real
democracy means educating ourselves about
the problems our society faces and thinking
critically about how to deal with them. Real
democracy is working, individually and in
groups, to influence the choices our represen
tatives make, and, if necessary, to fight to stop
them if we think what they're doing is wrong.
Democracy is a lot more difficult than
voting for Reagan, a daddy who takes the
hard choices away from you and tells you that
everything will be all right. It's also harder
than voting for Mondale, moaning at the
returns on TV and then curling up in bed with
the covers over your head.
Harder, but more satisfying. Because when
the bad times come, wearing an "I voted for
Mondale" button won't be enough.

tatives make, and, if necessary, to fight to stop
them if we think what they're doing is wrong.
Democracy is a lot more difficult than
voting for Reagan, a daddy who takes the
hard choices away from you and tells you that
everything will be all right. It's also harder
than voting for Mondale, moaning at the
returns on TV and then curling up in bed with
the covers over your head.
Harder, but more satisfying. Because when
the bad times come, wearing an "I voted for
Mondale" button won't be enough.

Why did Ronald Reagan win?
Ronald Reagan won because he ran a cam
paign based on voodoo economics, happytalk
and some bear that he said was supposed to
be in the woods.
Ronald Reagan won because after the eco
nomy became terrible, when it got bad again
it looked pretty good.
Ronald Reagan won because white people
don't like the fact that black people are voting
for Democrats.
Ronald Reagan won because the people
who did his commercials were the same
people who did the Pepsi commercials.
Ronald Reagan won because his policies
are so scary that people didn't want to believe
they were for real.
Could Mondale have won with a Southern
good ol' boy instead of Ferraro? Could Fer
raro have won with Hart instead of Mondale?
I doubt it. The election was not a comparison
of charisma (which Hart would have lost
anyway); more than anything else, it was a
contest of ideologies, which have their own
definite material and psychological bases.
Anyone running a traditional Democratic
campaign would have suffered the same
defeat; and anyone with the proper acting and
public-relations experience could be Reagan.
The names could be changed without protect

ing the innocent.
The only thing that could have saved the
Democrats, and the thing they need if they
plan on being a credible political force into
the next century, is a credible ideology of
their own.
I'm not talking about high-tech neo
liberalism in which blacks and labor unions
become "special interests." Those "new
ideas" are mainly a blueprint for becoming a
minority party, since there aren't, really, that
many yuppies in America.
What the Democratic Party needs is a pro
gram that shows that the poor and the
working class have not only compatible inter
ests, but the same interests. That is the only
thing that will save the Democratic coalition.
And I can't see this taking any form other
than a movement explicitly opposed to cor
porate power.
"Class-struggle campaigns are atavistic,"
the Wall Street Journal said on Election Day.
Often reactionaries have a much clearer
picture of what's going on than liberals, but in
this case I think it's wishful thinking. To bor
row a line from the Grim Communicator:
"You ain't seen nothing yet."
The fight for preservation of welfare has to
become instead a militant drive for full em
ployment, which is going to require state in

tervention. The Democratic Party is going to
have to identify with, not just tolerate, libera
tion movements like the Sandinistas and the
African National Congress. The political
structure itself will have to change to elimi
nate corporate funding as the most important
determinant of who gets political power.

We thought they were
chanting 'four more
beers'

Will the Democrats do these things? Not
unless they're forced to.
"Four more years." At the Mondale-
Ferraro-Carnoy "victory" party I attended we
thought they were chanting "four more
beers." But after the alcohol wears off you
realize that you are facing another term of the

lunatic fringe in charge of state policy.
Predictions would be dangerous if anyone
ever bothered to look up what you said would
happen. But I feel safe in making a few
guesses:
A recession is coming between now and
1986, and probably sooner rather than later.
It will be worse than 1982. Maybe not as bad
as 1929.
Reagan will be up to some extreme nasti
ness in Central America. The right wants the
Sandinistas out and the Salvadoran guerrillas
crushed. And as Reagan stated when he was
governor of California, he has no aversions to
a bloodbath.
The American people will be very disap
pointed in 1986 when they find out that
Reaganomics amounts to nothing more than
kicking the TV set to fix the vertical hold, and
that we're the ones who are going to have to
do the standing tall, fighting peasants in the
Third World.
And so, in the next congressional elections,
you can expect the Republicans to lose con
trol of the Senate and to lose enough seats in
the House to put them back to where they
were before 1980. But these gains, however
welcome they may be in checking the right
wing crusade, will not bring any lasting
changes to our society or create a permanent

power base for progressive movements.
The German sociologist Jurgen Habermas
writes about something he calls "formal
democracy." This is the situation when the
role of the citizen has been reduced to casting
a ballot every four years. This is called formal
democracy because it's democracy in name
only.
Real democracy means participation in the
decisions that affect our lives. Real
democracy means educating ourselves about
the problems our society faces and thinking
critically about how to deal with them. Real
democracy is working, individually and in
groups, to influence the choices our represen
tatives make, and, if necessary, to fight to stop
them if we think what they're doing is wrong.
