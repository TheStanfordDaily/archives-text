Response to terror
I would like to respond to two
points raised in Rachelle Marshall's
viewpoint, "Danger in our response
to terrorism" (The Daily, Nov. 6).
First, she writes: "The United
States . . . supported and helped arm
Israel's invasion and afterwards
tried, unsuccessfully, to prop up a
Phalangist government that a
majority of Lebanese bitterly
opposed." Bashir Gemayel, who was
the president of the Lebanese forces
(Phalangist militia), was elected
president of Lebanon by the
majority of the Lebanese parliament,
and almost all Lebanese supported
his election with great hope for the
war to end and the country to
recover. It is, on the contrary, when
he was assassinated that a majority
of Lebanese were very bitter.
Second. 'Ie writes: "Americans in
Lebanon he e been attacked . . .
perhaps because we are seen as the

enemies of liberation and indepen
dence elsewhere in the world."
Americans in Lebanon were at
tacked by extremists supported by
non-Lebanese who were not willing
to see Lebanon back on its feet. And
it is when the Americans left
Lebanon that a majority of Lebanese
feared for the liberation and the
independence of their country, bit
terly.

Daily immature
To suggest as you did in Wednes
day's editorial (The Daily, Oct. 7)
that anyone voting for President
Reagan did so out of selfishness
unfairly insults the American people.
Sixty percent of America's electorate
do not drive Mercedes. They did not
vote for Reagan to exploit America's
resources or to keep their own tax
rates low at her expense. Instead,

they voted for Reagan because,
whether or not they understood or
agreed with all of his policies, they
believe in him as a person and as a
president. It matters little how they
arrived at their decision; the reality
is that America has made her choice
and we are all obligated to stand by
it. Urging readers to vote on Tues
day and condemning their choice on
Wednesday is illogical and immature.
Your implication that ignorance and
self-interest re-elected Reagan is a
cynical attack on the same people
whose judgment the press is
supposed to honor.
Mondale's graceful concession was
a noble affirmation of his faith in the
democratic process and should set an
example for Democrats and
Republicans alike. The Daily's con
descending attitude discredits both
parties, their ideals, their campaigns
and the American people.

Ram's Head rage
This is the second attempt
at a letter to express my displeasure
with the review of "Taming of the
Shrew" (The Daily, Oct.s). This
effort is being transcribed in a state
of outrage which differs from my
first letter, written in a vengeance. 1
hold the editorial staff responsible
for its lack of discretion in allowing
such a review to appear in print. I
also place blame with the reviewer
for his irresponsibility in assuming
the role of theater critic.
The reviewer (I use the term only
for lack of a better justifying noun)
commences by stating his disrespect
for the dramatic talent at this univer
sity. I will not attempt to understand
where he feels he acquired the
knowledge to make such a state
ment. I do thank the editors for
leaving this paragraph at the outset
of the article; it allows the reader to
continue through the remainder of

the article forewarned of the author's
total and complete ignorance.
The reviewer continues to write in
a way which demonstrates, without
doubt, that he has not allowed him
self the luxury of reading the play
before seeing and attempting to
write on it. His knowledge of the
play is based on David Kudler's
version in which Kudler has taken
reasonable liberties to express his
interpretation of how the play per
tains to our present society. This is
not uncommon in American theater
as an art form.
The comments in the review con
tinue to display the reviewer's dis
pleasure at the costume, set and
lighting design ... all three of which
he has knowledge. His chauvinistic
lines on Kudler's choice of females in
traditional male roles proves only
that he missed the point of the entire
production as well as the boat on
which our changing world is sailing.
My advice to the reviewer An-

tholis is to read a play before he goes
to see it, read a great deal of Shake
speare before he attempts to review
it and read books on acting before he
uses words which he does not under
stand.
I hope that in the future the mem
bers of The Daily staff will read such
articles before allowing them to be
printed. And that in the future re
sponsible people, who have some
knowledge of the subject to be re
ported, are sent to cover appropriate
events.
Finally, in reference to the
reviewer's concluding quotation, I
hope that his wish for us to guess the
speaker was not due to his lack of
knowledge in the area. The line is
Macbeth's, from the play by the
same title. In context it refers to
people who overstep their rightful
bounds in the knowledge that they
will soon come to a painful end.
