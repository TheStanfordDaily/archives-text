## Democrats at important crossroads 
### 
The Democratic Party has reached a crossroads
in its existence. After Tuesday's overwhelming
landslide defeat, the party leaders must ask them
selves if the Democrats can ever hope to challenge
the Republican Party in a presidential race in the
foreseeable future. If the Democrats want to
become competitive again, they must seriously re
think their party's goals and ideals.
Consider this: Since the 1964 Johnson landslide,
22 states worth 206 electoral votes have voted Re-

publican in every election. No state has voted
Democratic every time (although the District of
Columbia has given its three votes to Democrats
every time). The Republicans have built an un
touchable base in the states west of the Mississippi
and have turned what used to be the solid Demo
cratic South into a Republican stronghold. Add to
that a couple of traditionally Republican industrial
states such as Indiana and New Jersey and it seems
that the Republicans have created an electoral lock
on the presidency. Barring a severe recession or a
shooting war (or a Watergate, which is what elected
Jimmy Carter), the Democrats don't have a fight
ing chance. What has happened to shatter the old
New Deal coalition that gave this country seven
Democratic victories in nine elections?
The Democrats' biggest loss is their inability to
get Southern and Western states to vote for them
anymore. The Democratic Party's push for civil
rights and other liberal issues alienated the strongly
conservative South whose white population teels
better served by the Republicans. The rugged in
dividualist ethos of the West (myth though it may
be) and its traditional mistrust of the federal gov
ernment has kept Democrats from being able to
sell their policies out here. Although the

Democrats have consistently garnered 80 to 90
percent of the black vote since 1964, they have
only managed to get 36 percent of the white vote
nationwide.
The second major liability is the perception of
the Democratic Party as a party of interest groups.
Political parties come in two general shades: those
that represent a group of people united by a set of
ideas and ideals, and those that are an amalgama
tion of various groups all seeking to promote their
own interests under the umbrella of a single party.
Right now the Republicans are perceived as the
former and the Democrats as the latter.
The Democrats were the party of ideals 20 years
ago when the New Frontier ushered in an era of
hope and Johnson promised the country that his
programs would lead to the "Great Society." The
country became disillusioned when these programs
failed to eliminate poverty and ignorance as their
costs mounted. It seemed to prove the
Republicans' point that government has little real
power to reshape society. Resentment built as af
firmative action, the Equal Rights Amendment,
food stamps and other Democratic projects came
under fire. Ever since the Democrats got their pro
grams in place they still have yet to develop any
clear idea of where to go next.
Mondale ran on a platform with no distinguish
ing features. A modest rise in defense spending,
restoration of some social-spending cuts and more
attention to traditional liberal concerns such as the
environment and education was about the size of it.
But he failed to present a vision, an ideal of
America as he seeks to make it. The problem with
the liberals in this country is that they don't know
what they want.
Another major loss for the Democrats was of
their own making. One of the traditional Demo
cratic blocs in this country was the first- and

second-generation immigrants who needed govern
ment support to "make it." But Democratic pro
grams have been successful enough to move many
of these voters into the middle class by providing
financial aid so their kids can go to college, insuring
their health through Medicare, providing jobs and
job training and a whole host of other programs.
Immigrant parents who used to vote for FDR now
have children who vote for President Reagan.
The clincher to the Democratic woes was the
economic unrest of the 19705. Liberal activism re
quires an atmosphere in which people are relatively
free of economic worries and can channel their
energies into broader social goals. The prosperity
of the '50s and the '60s created the conditions ne
cessary for the bold experimentation of the Great
Society. After the hard times of the '70s, the great
moderate majority that determines who wins elec
tions began to drift to the right in pursuit of per
sonal economic security. Americans settled down
to providing for themselves, and this process should
continue for at least this decade. Only after the na
tion takes a breather and regathers its strength will
it contemplate a return to the activism of the
Democrats.
The Democratic Party must undergo a serious
period of self-examination over the next four years.
It must decide whether it will retain its traditional
liberalism or change course with the politics of a
Gary Hart. It must develop an ideology that can
appeal to more than 36 percent of whites while re
taining its black support. It must re-establish the
support of blue-collar voters and become competi
tive in the West. This is a tall order, but if the
Democrats cannot do this they will go down to
defeat in one landslide after another lor the rest of
this century.
