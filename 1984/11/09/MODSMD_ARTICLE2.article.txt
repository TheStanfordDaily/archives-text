# University to capitalize on centennial goodwill
## 
### JEANNE COOPER Senior staff writer 
University officials hope to raise
$360 to $367 million dollars during a
four-year centennial celebration cam
paign to begin in 1986 or 1987. Sup
plementing an estimated $550 million
in normal giffs, the funds should ad
dress critical needs in specific areas
such as younger faculty, financial aid
endowment, undergraduate educa
tion, residences for all undergradu
ates and new buildings for the
sciences.
According to Vice President for
Development Henry Riggs, the cam
paign is a "bold and ambitious plan in
the tradition of Stanford fund
raising." Provost James Rosse pre
sented its tentative prospectus detail
ing fund allocation to the Faculty
Senate yesterday afternoon, stressing
that the progress report, written in
August, was a "historical artifact"
and "internal communication not
written in marketable terms." Rosse
will decide final fund priorities with
Riggs and University President
Donald Kennedy after consulting
with University deans.
In the preliminary draft, $170 mil
lion alone — the largest share of the
funds — may go to capital facilities
for scientific disciplines. Rosse said
the "deteriorating condition" of
Stanford's research facilities in the
pure and applied sciences not only
hinders research but also makes it dif
ficult to attract younger faculty in
those areas. Calling for "replacement
of the buildings in the science area
west of the Quadrangle," the plan
ners project that an additional $30
million from annual funds will be ne
cessary to realize their goal.
The campaign administrators see
new faculty recruitment, particularly
of junior members, as the next high
est priority for the University. The
prospectus estimates 75 professor
ships will cost $150 million to create,
of which $110 million could come

from the centennial fund drive.
The preliminary plans earmark at
least 20 incremental junior faculty ap
pointments to offset the rising age of
the faculty, most serious in the
humanities departments. According
to the prospectus, "... the
percentage of younger faculty — on
whom we count heavily to keep the
University an exciting, dynamic place
— is shrinking."
Noting that the average age of the
faculty has increased four years over
the past decade, Rosse said, "What's
more disturbing is the fact that the
faculty average will age another four
to five years in the next 10 years."
The University attributes the shrink
ing number of young faculty members
to stabilized faculty growth and the
"uncapping" of mandatory retire
ment.
The remaining appointments
would go to senior faculty,
"particulary in emerging disciplines,
and in new fields that cross traditional
departmental boundaries," according
to the prospectus. Upon questioning,
however, Rosse said an actual total of
about 40 professorships would be
created. Funds collected for the rest
of the positions would circulate
among the deans, possibly paying for
salary raises and assistant professor
ships.
Development planners hope to
meet a number of critical needs in un
dergraduate education with $35 mil
lion in centennial gifts.
"Undergraduate education at Stan
ford is healthy." Rosse said, "but
there are a whole variety of areas
where it can be and should be im
proved."
These tentatively include beefing
up advising, tutoring and computing
workshops; offering individual in
struction in writing, smaller seminars
and greater participation in research
and honors projects; and sponsoring
diore residcntially based events and
special programs for the sophomore

and senior years. According to the
prospectus, regular funds would need
to contribute an additional $15 mil
lion to realize those goals.
Undergraduates may also benefit
in another area from the special fund
drive. By providing the funds for an
800-unit student residence complex,
campaign planners envision meeting
"the full demand for undergraduate

housing on-campus, a problem at
Stanford since the end of World War
II." Rosse said the housing expansion
would enable Stanford to "move
away from the (Draw) system which
has had a high cost on meaningful
residential education."
The new residential neighborhood,
about the size of Governor's Corner,
would also contain space for single
graduate students. ASSU Senate
Chair Eric Berg criticized the pro
posal. however, for not giving
graduate-housing needs as high a
priority as that of undergraduates.
Although Rosse did not respond to
Berg's comment, he later remarked
that student residences in general are
the most difficult projects for which
to raise money.


James Rosse
All students would gain from an es
timated $20 million increase in finan
cial aid endowment. Early figures
draw $12 million from centennial
donations for more undergraduate
need and merit scholarships and
larger graduate stipends. According
to the prospectus, campaign planners
would also like to pour $15 million
into support for post-doctoral posi
tions, research assistants, technicians,
equipment and minor renovations,
half of which would come from regu
lar development funds.
Rosse said he and the other plan
ners have not had a "broad enough
consultation yet among the schools
and the committees" to establish

firmly any financial priorities. He
noted that some pressing needs
omitted in the report, such as a build
ing for the Graduate School of Busi
ness, are being addressed in fund
campaigns already under way and are
"part of the larger context of our
campaign."
Ultimately, fund raising will focus
on what donors want to support as
well as what the University needs,
Rosse said. And according to Riggs,
"We won't go public (with the final
prospectus) until we gather suffici
ent nuclear funds to ensure its suc
cess."
Riggs said the development office
will have to do "macro-testing and
micro-guessing" before it officially
presents a prospectus. "We will go
through name by name the most
generous donors to see if their inter
ests match the gift opportunities."
