## Card to test fourth-best rushing defense 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
The University of Southern California Trojans came to
Stanford Stadium Saturday, saw the portable lights and
conquered the Cardinal football team. Then they left.
And Stanford breathed a sigh of relief.
But the sigh lasted about as long as it takes to say the
University of Arizona Wildcats. Stanford plays them to
morrow at 5 p.m. in Tucson, and if the Cardinal thought
things could only get better after USC, it might be in for a
big surprise.
While the Wildcats — the only team Stanford beat last
season — are 5-4 overall and 3-2 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence, their defensive numbers are imposing. Arizona's
defense, which has given up an average of 80 rushing
yards per g ime. is ranked first in the Pac-10 and fourth in
the nation against the run.
Last week, Stanford rushed for 65 yards against a USC
defense rated second in the Pac-10 and seventh in the na
tion. And if Stanford ran for 65 yards against a USC
defense that allows 92 yards per game, simple mathema
tics say the Cardinal should rush for 57 yards against the
Wildcats tomorrow.
"Defense has been our real strength," Arizona Coach
Larry Smith said. "We've done real well against the run."
That's probably because Arizona's defensive line is big.

Left tackle David Wood weighs in at 256 pounds and right
tackle John Barthalt is 244. Nosegaurd Joe Drake,
nicknamed "Joe Joe," tips the scales at 299 and probably
didn't have to put on a costume to scare young children at
Halloween.
If Stanford — which needs to win its final two games to
have its first winning season since 1980 — experiences the
same limited success running against the Wildcats it had
against the Trojans, it will have to revert to an air attack.
And probably without quarterback John Pave.
Paye sustained the second finger injury to his right hand
Saturday, this one an extensor-tendon strain to his middle
finger, and is listed as doubtful for tomorrow's game. In
fact, Paye's finger is so bad that it's doubtful he will travel
tomorrow.
"The way I evaluate it today," Coach Jack Llway said
Monday, "is that it will be very, very unlikely that he will
play against Arizona. It's pretty difficult to throw a foot
ball with a splint on your finger."
Once again, Fred Buckley will start in place of Pave.
Stanford is 2-0 in road games when Buckley luin started,
but Buckley hasn't been under pressure to throw like he
probably will be tomorrow.
Even if Stanford still tries to run the ball, there will be
passes thrown tomorrow. Arizona and quarterback Alfred
Jenkins will take care of that.

"Arizona is going to throw the football," Elway said.
"They throw from multiple sets and when their quarter
back's on. they're hard to stop." In a 45-10 Arizona vic
tory over Utah State last week, the two teams combined
to throw 101 passes. Jenkins threw 38 of them.
"Alfred Jenkins is a big, strong athlete," Smith said of
Jenkins, a 6-foot-4, 225-pound sophomore. "He has a
very strong arm, but he's like most young quarterbacks
and he's inconsistent."
Jenkins has two of the Pac-10's best to throw to. Split
end Jon Horton is first in the conference in receiving
yardage (747) and third in receptions (38), and flanker
Jay Dobyns is fifth in receiving (35).
Smith's biggest area of concern is his offensive line.
Paye and his fluke finger injuries are nothing compared to
Arizona's line, which already has lost two centers.
"We've had a ton of injuries up there." Smith said.
••We've been shuffling people in and out trying to find the
best combination. We've started eight different lineups
there, and that's really taken its toll."
Another area of concern for Smith has not been with his
team, but with the players in black-and-white-striped jer
seys. Smith first criticized officials after a 17-14 loss to
USC when an apparent Wildcat touchdown was dis
allowed because the receiver on the play was ruled out of
bounds. However, television replays showed a seemingly

convincing argument to the contrary, and Smith was up
set.
"I think we've all had problems. I just spoke out about
it,"he said Monday. "I think we all realize there are three
parts to a college football game — the players, the coaches
and the officials. And any of the three can influence the
outcome of a game.
"Coaches can outcoach coaches, players can outplay
players, and I think officials call good games and they call
bad games."
Arizona players have reason to be frustrated, but not at
officials. Arizona is the only Pac-10 team on probation
and is serving the second year of a two-year punishment.
Last season, the Wildcats began as if the word proba
tion didn't exist and won their first four games, 50-6, 38-
0, 45-6 and 37-10. But the roof began to fall in the next
week with a 33-33 tie with the University of California at
Berkeley, and Arizona finished with a 7-3-1 record.
Stanford, on the other hand, was 1-10 last season. Since
then. Arizona has fallen a bit and Stanford has improved a
bit.
"I think the two teams are very evenly matched," Smith
said. "We really expect to have the best game of the
season Saturday night."
