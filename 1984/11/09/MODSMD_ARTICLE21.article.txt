### INGRID SEYER Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford women's swimming and diving team
dominated its first meet of the season yesterday at
DeGuerre Pool, outscoring San Jose State University,
Fresno State University and the University of the Pacific
by more than 70 points.
Stanford scored 120 points and was followed by San
Jose State (43), Fresno State (41) and UOP (27).
Although the Cardinal swimmers dominated the meet,
Stanford Coach George Haines was not happy with his
team's overall performance.
"No one took this meet very seriously, and all of the
swimmers were too laid back for a regular-season meet
like this one," Haines said. "Some of our girls had good
times, but if today was any preview for the remainder of
the season, we still have a long way to go. We lost far too
many events that we really should have won."
Unlike Haines. Stanford Diving Coach Rick Schavone

was pleased with his divers' performance.
"The girls were tremendous, and I couldn't be happier
with their diving today," Shavone said. "Jean Meyer and
Simone LeVant were definitely diving superhly, especially
when you consider that this is our first meet of the
season."
Meyer, who won the three-meter competition, was also
happy with her diving.
"It feels super to start off the season like this," Meyer
said. "I have been diving for 16 years, and this will be my
last year of competition. It is exciting to start off my last
year in such a great way."
In the swimming competition, Cardinal junior Kathy
Smith swept the four events she entered, taking first place
in the 100- and 200-meter breaststrokes, the 200 medley
relay and the 200 freestyle relay. Senior co-captain
Marybeth Linzmeier won the 1.000 and 500 freestyles
and was on the winning 200 freestyle relay team. She also
placed second in the 100 freestyle.
