# Top 2 polo teams to Splash
## 
### INGRID SEYER Staff sportswriter 
The nation's top two water polo teams will face
off today in the "Big Splash" when No. I-ranked
Stanford hosts Pacific 10 Conference rival Univer
sity of California, Berkeley at 3 p.m. in DeGuerre
Pool.
A victory for Stanford, which is 4-0 in the Pac
-10, would clinch the conference championship and
would guarantee the top seed for the National Col
legiate Athletic Association championships Nov.
24-25 at Long Beach.
The Bears, the defending Pac-10 and NCAA
champions, are currently second in the Pac-10 with
a 3-1 record.
The rankings and the records suggest that Stan
ford (20-3 overall) and Berkeley (18-3-1) are
evenly matched teams, something Stanford Coach

Dante Dettamanti agrees with.
"Both of these teams are almost perfectly
matched, and there is very, very little separating
the two teams as far as the overall caliber of play,"
Dettamanti said. "The game today is going to come
down to which team gets the most breaks and
which one takes the best advantage of its 6-5
(player) situations."
Because Dettamanti said the number of 6-5 situ
ations will ultimately decide the game, the Cardinal
will be focusing on scoring when it has a one-man
advantage.
"Both teams can score the same number of regu
lar goals, so whoever scores the most 6-5 goals is
going to win today," Dettamanti said. "Cal is a very
strong and solid team with a lot of experience. It's
going to take a lot to beat them."
Because of the importance of the game. Cardinal

players have been working hard at conditioning
themselves mentally and physically.
"We are all a little nervous, but I think once both
teams get into the pool, we will forget about all the
pressures and just start playing water polo," senior
goalie Steve Moyer said. "[I hope] we will have a
big crowd, because this is going to be a really tough
game for us and the support of the crowd can help
beyond measure."
Cal's top players include sophomore Matt
Biondi, a gold medalist on the 1984 U.S. Olympic
4xloo freestyle relay team, and senior Alan Gres
ham, also a top collegiate swimmer.
Sophomore David Imbernino, who scored four
goals for the Cardinal last Saturday in its 8-7 vic
tory over USC, leads in team scoring with 49 goals.
