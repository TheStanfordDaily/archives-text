## 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
Stanford's No. 1-ranked women's
volleyball team, which was upset on
Wednesday night, will play several
other top-ranked teams this weekend
in the Wendy's Classic Tournament
at Stockton.
The Cardinal will play No. 3-
ranked UCLA tomorrow at 5:30 p.m.
at the University of the Pacific. The
Bruins are 24-5 overall and in second

place in the Western Collegiate Ath
letic Association with a 9-3 record.
Stanford, which lost a conference
match to San Diego State University
in four games Wednesday, is still in
first place in the WCAA with a 10-2
record and is 13-3 overall.
The match at 7:30 p.m. will set the
University of Hawaii against the
UOP Tigers. Hawaii has never lost a
match at the Wendy's Classic and has
won three straight Wendy's titles.

The Rainbow Warriors are 30-6
overall, and the Tigers are 24-6.
After its loss to San Diego State,
Stanford would like to do well in the
tournament in hopes of retaining its
No. 1 ranking. According to senior
Susan Compton, the loss has helped
the Cardinal put the rest of the season
in perspective.
"The loss was kind of good for us.
After you win a lot of games you for

get what it's like to lose," Compton
said. "It was like a kick in the pants to
get you going again. It would be
really nice to do well (at the tourna
ment) and get back on the right
track."
Last season, the top four teams in
the Wendy's Classic — Hawaii,
UCLA, UOP and Stanford — were
the same four that reached the
NCAA Final Four. Hawaii went on to
win both championships.
