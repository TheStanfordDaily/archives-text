The men's and women's fencing
teams will open their seasons tomor
row when they host the University of
San Francisco and San Francisco
State, respectively.
For the men, this opening match
might be a walkover. Last season,
Stanford defeated USF, 21-6, twice.
Stanford Flead Coach Buzz Hurst
expects his team to be the favorite to
repeat as the National Collegiate
Athletic Association Western
Regional champion. "Clearly this is
the strongest three-weapon (epee,
foil, sabre) team that I've ever
coached," Hurst said.

The Cardinal, which finished last
season 12-2, returns its three starters
in the sabre event team. Andy
Goorno, Steve Levitan and Craig
Miott won the silver medal at that
event at the regionals.
The women probably will also
come away with a victory tomor
row, according to Hurst. "I would be
unhappily surprised if the women
don't win . . . but it's not going to be a
pushover either."
The Cardinal lost four players to
graduation, and its top returner,
junior Jennifer Yu, will not be com
peting against San Francisco State.
The matches will begin tomorrow
at 1 p.m. in Roble Gym.
