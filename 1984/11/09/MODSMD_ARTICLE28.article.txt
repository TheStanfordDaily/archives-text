## It's not just for football games anymore 
### MARGARET SCHNEIDER CATHY JANUS 
Next week hundreds, even
thousands, of Stanford students will
descend on the city of Berkeley to
witness a mighty victory. But the Big
Game isn't all there is in the East Bay
city: While there, you may want to
take advantage of some of the other
things Berkeley has to offer.
Yes, there is a city around the
campus of that school on the other
side of the Bay, and it's a very food
oriented community. Since the arrival
of Alice Waters, the owner of world
famous Chez Pannisse, Berkeley has
blossomed with quality eateries of
every shape and ethnic origin. Some
claim that it's all those '60s radicals
who realized at some point that they
had to make a living; years of prepar
ing organic food finally came in
handy. Whether or not this is actually
the source of the local cuisine revolu
tion, fresh ingredients and an inno
vative attitude are common to every
respected restaurant in the area.
Of course, there is more than just
food in Berzerkeley. Stanford students

should note the number of book
stores and curio shops that sur
round the restaurants in this article.
Window-shoppers will find Telegraph
Avenue perfect for their chosen
pastime: Rasputin Records is one of
the Bay Area's best — and cheapest
— music stores, Aardvark Thrift of
fers downright clever interpretations
of the finest in second-hand clothing,
and no no one should miss Yarmo's, a
bizarre store selling everything from
rubber chickens to lamps shaped like
giant croissants.
Even if you only stay in Berkeley
long enough to see how badly we beat
the Weenies, you are going to have to
eat some time, and you might want to
use this basic guide to save you from
wandering into the wrong place. The
establishments given the most atten
tion are those known to the local resi
dents.
If you want to risk going to one of
the student hangouts, try Kip's or
Larry Blakes, both within a few

blocks of Sproul Plaza. For a student
bar check into Flenry's or Spatz.
Morning Eve-Openers
Going out to breakfast has become
an art in the land of the Golden Bear.
Places like Bette's Ocean View Diner
and The Buttercup Bakery serve
complete breakfasts with various
omelettes and high-quality pastries.
And, if you have the time to sit down,
you might try Ramona's. This restau
rant has no connections to the
Ramona's in Palo Alto; however, you
should have no problems remember
ing the name. The brunch menu in
cludes egg specialties, including Eggs
Benedict ($6.50). Less expensive are
omelettes, which start at $3.75 and
are served with homefries, and your
choice of bread or pastry. If you want
authentic Chicago-style pizza and it's
after 11:30 a.m., you're in luck.
Ramona's has an original recipe
which is its claim to fame.
In your hurry to get to the game.

you'll probably prefer getting food to
go and eating in a park or other pleas
ant place. TTiere are so many excel
lent bakeries in the city that the diffi
culty is in singling out the best. One
method is to choose places by their
particular specialty. For example,
Nabalom undoubtedly sells the best
cheese danish in the East Bay. Lo
cated just off College Avenue,
around the corner from Sweet
Dreams, this cooperative bakery has
fruit-flavored cheese danish of all
possible flavors — all delectable.
In a less unusual but no less deli
cious vein, Fat Apples makes bran
muffins that have developed a cult
following. They also have other muf
fins and tasty danish and, most im
portant, they serve good coffee. Fat
Apples has Peets 101 blend coffee,
which connotes excellence to even the
most demanding coffee-lovers. You'll
find Fat Apples, which used to be
called Fat Albert's, on Martin Luther
King Jr. Way, which used to be called
Grove Street. In fact, you will notice

signs on every corner saying "Old
Grove Street," which were put up to
correct for all the confusion following
last year's name-change. Locals
created their own name for this main
street: Milky Way.
As you exit the freeway, you might
want to stop just below the BART
overpass at Toot Sweets and the
Bagel Bakery. They are side by side,
and both offer fresh baked goods that
look as great as they taste.
Delicatessens
Rather than buy your munchies
and drinks in Palo Alto, wait until
you get to Berkeley and stop at a
delicatessen; you'll want food to keep
your energy up during the game.
There are two liqour stores near
campus that have good delis, so you
can kill two birds with one stone if
you get your supplies at one of these.
Jackson's Liquor on the corner of
Claremont and Tunnel has much
more than just sandwiches. Even

easier to find is College Avenue Li ( |
uor and Delicatessen; if you can't fim
College, you're really in trouble. Thi
deli is on the corner of College ark
Alcatraz, and usually has a gooi
supply of cold beer to accompany it*
sandwiches. For the gourmand with
more discriminating taste, try Poulei
on Shattuck or the Berkeley Baker\
and Cafe on Solano. Poulet is
prototype of a European charcuteric.
while the Berkeley Bakery and Cafe
deserves attention for the homemade
breads that form the base for their
sandwiches.
Post Game Victory Celebration
Getting out of town after the game
may be a real challenge to your
driving skills, so we'd like to suggest
that you stick around and celebrate
the big victory at one of the many fun
places to munch in the area. In an at
tempt to cover all bases, we have tips
for you on Italian, Mexican, Chinese.
Japanese and even Irish-Mexican

tood. In the spirit of student life, we'll
start with inexpensive but good
places, and move on to the more
pricey and exotic restaurants/
No guide to student eating would
be complete without a mention of
pizza, so the first thing to know is that
La Val's has good pizza and beer on
tap. There are two La Val's within
walking distance of the stadium, so
they'll make convenient havens until
the traffic calms down. The one on
Euclid has a terrace with picnic tables
where you can be just about as rowdy
as you like.
Way down toward the freeway —
below the railroad tracks — you can
find Juan's Place, which has the best
Mexican food for its price in
Berkeley. Not only is it cheap and
plentiful, but it's also authentic! If
you like chile rellenos, head to Car
leton and Ninth, and join the regular
crowd that frequents this out-of-the
way spot. Juan's is popular for its
festive atmosphere and good pitchers
of saneria. so its a perfect candidate

for an after-the-game fiesta. Don't be
dissuaded if you have to wait for a
table; you can go to the bar and get
some fresh tortilla chips and drinks to
help the time pass.
If you like Mexican food and places
with atmosphere, Carlos Murphy's is
conveniently located right off the
freeway at the Emeryville exit on the
return trip to Stanford. Carlos
Murphy's has a beautiful view of the
Bay and San Francisco and takes its
name from its theme: It's an Irish-
Mexican Cafe. The decor and menu
reflect this zany idea. The walls and
ceiling are covered with all kinds of
bizarre paraphernalia, while the
menu reads like a board game. Ap
petizers and drinks alone make this a
destination worth having in mind
during the game, as about one-third
of the restaurant is devoted to an ex
tremely active bar. However, the
friendly and informal servers are very
strict about identification, so don't
plan to drink here unless you have a
valid ID. The food is tasty and fun —

take, for example, the "build-your
own burrito," for those who like
eating to be an active process. Again,
this would be a great place for some
post-game festivities.
With the recent popularity of Asian
cuisine, Berkeley has seen the arrival
of many Chinese, Japanese and
Taiwanese restaurants. King Tsin is
possibly the oldest and most success
ful of the Chinese places. Don't be
fooled by the snazzy new facade; that
just went up about two years ago. The
same man has stood at the register for
years, and yes, he really does use the
abacus on the counter to check his
addition. King Tsin is on Solano Ave
nue, among many other Eastern
restaurants, so if you can't get a table
right away, you can try one of the
others in walking distance.
Since Solano Avenue also has Ital
ian, Mexican, Indian and German
food (not to mention a restaurant that
specializes in pies — Walker's Pie
Shop), you can bet that you'll find
something your style if you just stroll

down the street. In fact, the same is
true for virtually every main street in
the city. If you like to discover a place
for yourself, this is the city in which to
do it. There is a high probability that
you will be very satisfied with your
own chance find.
Sweet Treats
Enough dinner information, now
for the good stuff: where to go for
dessert. After-dinner places fall into
two major catagories: European-style
cafes and frozen-dessert parlors.
Frozen desserts include frozen yo
gurt, ice cream, gelato and now tof
futti, a tofu-based frozen custard. Ex
cepting Juan's Place, every eatery
mentioned in this article is within a
short walk of at least one frozen
dessert parlor and one cafe.
Ice-cream parlors still outnumber
fro-yo places in Berkeley, but maybe
not for long. The key factor in the
contest is that no two ice creams are
alike. For true ice-cream connois

seurs, Vivoli's has no rivals. There are
a number of Vivoli's in Berkeley,
each featuring unique flavors of
gelato. Their cappuccino includes a
word of warning —-or temptation —
because it is made with alcohol. Don't
be put off by the prices. Not only is
the ice cream the finest, but the hot
fudge and whipped cream is also
homemade. We suggest the mini
sundaes, which are absolutely
heavenly. Because gelato is high in
butterfat, a little goes a long way.
You can find Vivoli's on Vine Street
between Walnut and Shattuck, in
Trumpet Vine Court on Shattuck or
in many restaurants, including the
Berkeley Bakery and Cafe.
The most well-known yogurt shop
is Yogurt Park, just below Telegraph.
They have an incredible selection of
flavors and many toppings as well.
In Search of a Caffeine Fix
Where Berkeley really outdoes it
self is cafes. Coffee drinking has

achieved psuedo-religious status in
the home city of Peets Coffee. Cafe
Roma used to be the place to go be
cause of its convenient location on
College and Durant. Recently
though, other cafes have challenged
Cafe Roma's position. Old Blue is
one notable cafe. Soon to be a bed
and-breakfast inn, Old Blue is a
pleasant place to sit and have coffee
and dessert. There are outdoor tables
above street-level so you can watch
the antics of Telegraph people. You'll
likely see a number of police here
watching the activities as well. These
regulars make the Old Blue a very
safe place, especially late at night. If
nothing else, you should check out
the graffiti on the chalkboards in the
restrooms.
As with everything else, cafes
abound in Berkeley, and you'll find
one in all the main areas.
