# Papa's Ristorante Venezia is a real Italian masterpiece
## 
### 
Ristorante Venezia
1902 University Avenue
Berkeley, 644-3093
Ristorante Venezia has a well
deserved reputation for serving fine
Italian cuisine. You need only walk in
the door to know that this is no ordi
nary Italian restaurant. Papa
Venezia's concern that his ristorante
be known for its quality service, fine
ingredients, careful preparation of
meals and ambiance is evident in the
attention he pays selecting his
employees, the items on his menu and
the decor.
The beautiful artistic interior first
caught my attention as I entered the
restaurant. Desiring only the best,
Papa chose Mama Venezia to re
create the charms of waterfront life in
Venice. Using as her model an au
thentic photograph which hangs in
the WC, she painted the walls and
added street lamps and a clothesline
with garments hanging on it to add a
real-life touch. The impression is that
of being in the Piazza San Marco,
looking across the canal to the distant
buildings on one wall, and then to the
local bread-and-produce markets on
the other wall. The two walls are
joined by a clothesline which effec
tively gives one a feeling of im
mediacy.
To further enhace the attempt to
reproduce a little bit of Italy in East
Bay, Papa Venezia made a trip to
Italy with his employees where they
discovered first-hand the culture and
beauty of the country, as well as the
secrets of Italian cooking. Quite
surprisingly, the owner, whose real
name is John, is not Italian.
We were seated immediately upon
arrival. The room is a long rectangle,
and at the opposite end of the en

trance is the kitchen. The area where
the cook stands, busily preparing the
many fresh meat, chicken and
seafood items which are grilled to or
der, is visible to the customers. Thus
we could watch as the chef added
various spices to the foods he was
cooking before we returned to the
challenging task of selecting a meal
from the many tempting choices.
When you make your first visit to
Ristorante Venezia, as I recommend
you do. narrowing your choices down
may prove slightly difficult.
The hard work Papa and Mama put
into the Ristorante has paid off. The
tables in the restaurant were soon oc
cupied, proving that reservations are
necessary if you want to dine at Ris
torante Venezia on a weekend even
ing. We had called for reservations at
5:30 p.m. and were told they could
accommodate us at 6:15 or 9 p.m.
only.
As waiters and waitresses walk by
with various appetizers and entrees,
the aroma makes one impatient for
his or her own food. To keep custom
ers happy until the first course
arrives, warm French bread and but
ter are served.
We began with the antipasti misti.
Prepared for two ($8.00), this ap
petizer is served on a plate with an as
sortment of delicacies: stuffed mus
sels, roasted peppers, marinated egg
plant, two large strips of fresh moz
zarella and sliced tomato. You can
either eat these items in various com
binations or savor each individually. I
am especially fond of peppers and
was delighted with their preparation;
it was faultless. The mozzarella was
rich and creamy, and had a lightly
grilled taste which was very pleasing.
Other appetizers that evening in
cluded a salad of white beans, caviar

and marinated vegetables ($3.50),
autumn soup consisting of butternut
squash, apples, leeks, cream and ap
ple cider, topped with croutons and
swiss cheese ($3.00), and other mixed
greens. 1 also noticed that several
people chose to order the Ravioli di
Anitra Affumicato ($10.00) as an ap
petizer and then split it among their
groups. Homemade ravioli filled with
smoked duck, veal and ricotta — it
looked and smelled very good.
Entrees include a variety of fresh
fish specials on the blackboard, fet
tuccine, spaghetti and lasagne, and
other meat, pork and chicken dishes.
Not all the meats are grilled. Two
saute entrees were Risotto Ai Frutti
Di Mare ($11.00) and Vitello Fores
tiere ($11.00). The first was fresh
fish, clams, mussells and squid on a
bed of Arborio rice cooked with
tomatoes, anchovies and garlic. The
second was veal with assorted mush
rooms in a madeira cream sauce
served with pasta and vegetables.
Finally, there is house coffee,
espresso and other fine coffees and
desserts to choose from. Most
desserts cost $2.75 and include
homemade gelati ice cream, chilled
zabaione, fruit tart with custard and
fresh fruit, chocolate torte and more.
Papa's ventures extend beyond the
doors of this restaurant. He occupies
the corners of University and Martin
Luther King Jr. Way. In addition to
Ristorante Venezia, he owns and
operates Cafe Venezia and Ay
Caramba. Cafe Venezia is a smaller
scaled, more casual version of the
Ristorante. Ay Caramba is a fast
food joint serving Mexican food.
Once again you can expect the best.
They use shredded sirloin instead of
ground beef in all the meat items.

local bread-and-produce markets on
the other wall. The two walls are
joined by a clothesline which effec
tively gives one a feeling of im
mediacy.
To further enhace the attempt to
reproduce a little bit of Italy in East
Bay, Papa Venezia made a trip to
Italy with his employees where they
discovered first-hand the culture and
beauty of the country, as well as the
secrets of Italian cooking. Quite
surprisingly, the owner, whose real
name is John, is not Italian.
We were seated immediately upon
arrival. The room is a long rectangle,
and at the opposite end of the en

trance is the kitchen. The area where
the cook stands, busily preparing the
many fresh meat, chicken and
seafood items which are grilled to or
der, is visible to the customers. Thus
we could watch as the chef added
various spices to the foods he was
cooking before we returned to the
challenging task of selecting a meal
from the many tempting choices.
When you make your first visit to
Ristorante Venezia, as I recommend
you do. narrowing your choices down
may prove slightly difficult.
The hard work Papa and Mama put
into the Ristorante has paid off. The
tables in the restaurant were soon oc
cupied, proving that reservations are
necessary if you want to dine at Ris
torante Venezia on a weekend even
ing. We had called for reservations at
5:30 p.m. and were told they could
accommodate us at 6:15 or 9 p.m.
only.
As waiters and waitresses walk by
with various appetizers and entrees,
the aroma makes one impatient for
his or her own food. To keep custom
ers happy until the first course
arrives, warm French bread and but
ter are served.
We began with the antipasti misti.
Prepared for two ($8.00), this ap
petizer is served on a plate with an as
sortment of delicacies: stuffed mus
sels, roasted peppers, marinated egg
plant, two large strips of fresh moz
zarella and sliced tomato. You can
either eat these items in various com
binations or savor each individually. I
am especially fond of peppers and
was delighted with their preparation;
it was faultless. The mozzarella was
rich and creamy, and had a lightly
grilled taste which was very pleasing.
Other appetizers that evening in
cluded a salad of white beans, caviar

and marinated vegetables ($3.50),
autumn soup consisting of butternut
squash, apples, leeks, cream and ap
ple cider, topped with croutons and
swiss cheese ($3.00), and other mixed
greens. 1 also noticed that several
people chose to order the Ravioli di
Anitra Affumicato ($10.00) as an ap
petizer and then split it among their
groups. Homemade ravioli filled with
smoked duck, veal and ricotta — it
looked and smelled very good.
Entrees include a variety of fresh
fish specials on the blackboard, fet
tuccine, spaghetti and lasagne, and
other meat, pork and chicken dishes.
Not all the meats are grilled. Two
saute entrees were Risotto Ai Frutti
Di Mare ($11.00) and Vitello Fores
tiere ($11.00). The first was fresh
fish, clams, mussells and squid on a
bed of Arborio rice cooked with
tomatoes, anchovies and garlic. The
second was veal with assorted mush
rooms in a madeira cream sauce
served with pasta and vegetables.
Finally, there is house coffee,
espresso and other fine coffees and
desserts to choose from. Most
desserts cost $2.75 and include
homemade gelati ice cream, chilled
zabaione, fruit tart with custard and
fresh fruit, chocolate torte and more.
Papa's ventures extend beyond the
doors of this restaurant. He occupies
the corners of University and Martin
Luther King Jr. Way. In addition to
Ristorante Venezia, he owns and
operates Cafe Venezia and Ay
Caramba. Cafe Venezia is a smaller
scaled, more casual version of the
Ristorante. Ay Caramba is a fast
food joint serving Mexican food.
Once again you can expect the best.
They use shredded sirloin instead of
ground beef in all the meat items.

Ristorante Venezia
1902 University Avenue
Berkeley, 644-3093
Ristorante Venezia has a well
deserved reputation for serving fine
Italian cuisine. You need only walk in
the door to know that this is no ordi
nary Italian restaurant. Papa
Venezia's concern that his ristorante
be known for its quality service, fine
ingredients, careful preparation of
meals and ambiance is evident in the
attention he pays selecting his
employees, the items on his menu and
the decor.
The beautiful artistic interior first
caught my attention as I entered the
restaurant. Desiring only the best,
Papa chose Mama Venezia to re
create the charms of waterfront life in
Venice. Using as her model an au
thentic photograph which hangs in
the WC, she painted the walls and
added street lamps and a clothesline
with garments hanging on it to add a
real-life touch. The impression is that
of being in the Piazza San Marco,
looking across the canal to the distant
buildings on one wall, and then to the
local bread-and-produce markets on
the other wall. The two walls are
joined by a clothesline which effec
tively gives one a feeling of im
mediacy.
