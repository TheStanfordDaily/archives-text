# Students describe attack at campus party
## Women file assault charges 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Daily staff 
Two female freshmen were assaulted at a frater
nity party at approximately 11:15 last night and
have filed charges with Stanford Police, according
to four freshmen — the two filing charges and two
witnesses.
Charlotte Lowson, a resident of Eucalypto
House in Lagunita Court, said she was grabbed by
a large, blond male who tried to "rip off [her]
clothes in front of a large group of people" at a
Beta Theta Pi party. She has filed assault-and
battery charges against the man.
The man is believed not to be a member of the
Beta fraternity.
Cathy Zerboni, also of Eucalypto, said she was
attacked by the same male minutes later. She has
also filed charges of assault and battery.
Mike Hein, also of Eucalypto, and Jill Higgins, of
Lagunita's Adelfa House, corroborated the stories

of the two women. All four freshmen said they did
not know the assailant.
The male has not been positively identified, al
though the four said they believed he was a Stan
ford football player whose picture they picked out
of a 1984 football guide later last night.
Police said early this morning that they were
close to making a definite identification.
The four freshmen described the event in the fol
lowing way.
A male grabbed Lowson and tried to force her to
dance with him.
Lowson said she told him, "Look, 1 have to go to
the bathroom," tore herself away, ran upstairs and
remained there for about 10 minutes.
Lowson said the man was waiting upstairs for her
and chased her downstairs once he saw her. Low
son and Hein both said they saw the assailant grab
Lowson at the bottom of the stairs.
Lowson said the assailant "grabbed me . . . tore

my jacket off completely and was ripping my
clothes off me. My whole stomach was exposed; he
had my shirt half off."
According to the four freshmen, Zerboni, Hig
gins and Hein all attempted to stop the assailant
forcibly while 10 to 20 people looked on but made
no attempt to help.
"Everyone was circling around watching," Hig
gins said.
"Nobody was doing anything, and it was obvious
that she was in trouble," Hein said.
The four freshmen each said friends of the as
sailant laughed and even cheered him on.
"I was really just trying to give him pain to get
him off her," Zerboni said.
Higgins and Zerboni said they dug nails into the
assailant's skin and "had his thumb bent back to his
wrist," but that he continued to attack Lowson.
"If it had just been us two, we
would have been helpless," Higgins
said.
Hein said he was able to release
Lowson from the assailant's grip and
that Lowson left the house quickly
after she was freed.
Lowson said she was disturbed
greatly by the attack.
"1 live in New York. I've been held
up at gunpoint. And this shook me up
more," she said.
Although Lowson did not re-enter
the Beta House after leaving, the
other three did. Zerboni said she was
attacked in the house by the same
man soon after she went inside again.
Zerboni said that upon entering the
Beta House a second time, she was
told by another male, who said he was
a friend of the assailant, that she

should calm down. But the assailant
then attacked her, grabbing her and
attempting to rip her clothes off, she
said. Hein forcibly pried the as
sailant's hands from Zerboni, and she
ran outside, Hein said.
"It's like being played with in the
middle of an audience, 10 people
laughing," Zerboni said.
Zerboni said the man was very
large. "What can you do with a guy
who's 100 pounds bigger than you?"
she asked. "Do you need a
bodyguard to go to a party?"
After Zerboni was released from
the assailant's grip, she left, along
with Higgins and Hein. The three
females returned home. Hein later
re-entered the party and said he wit
nessed a fight between two males,
one of whom he said was the as
sailant.
Others at the party said they had
seen the fight but did not remember
the incidents involving the freshmen.

According to the four freshmen, Zerboni, Hig
gins and Hein all attempted to stop the assailant
forcibly while 10 to 20 people looked on but made
no attempt to help.
"Everyone was circling around watching," Hig
gins said.
"Nobody was doing anything, and it was obvious
that she was in trouble," Hein said.
The four freshmen each said friends of the as
sailant laughed and even cheered him on.
"I was really just trying to give him pain to get
him off her," Zerboni said.
Higgins and Zerboni said they dug nails into the
assailant's skin and "had his thumb bent back to his
wrist," but that he continued to attack Lowson.
"If it had just been us two, we
would have been helpless," Higgins
said.
Hein said he was able to release
Lowson from the assailant's grip and
that Lowson left the house quickly
after she was freed.
Lowson said she was disturbed
greatly by the attack.
"1 live in New York. I've been held
up at gunpoint. And this shook me up
more," she said.
Although Lowson did not re-enter
the Beta House after leaving, the
other three did. Zerboni said she was
attacked in the house by the same
man soon after she went inside again.
Zerboni said that upon entering the
Beta House a second time, she was
told by another male, who said he was
a friend of the assailant, that she

should calm down. But the assailant
then attacked her, grabbing her and
attempting to rip her clothes off, she
said. Hein forcibly pried the as
sailant's hands from Zerboni, and she
ran outside, Hein said.
"It's like being played with in the
middle of an audience, 10 people
laughing," Zerboni said.
Zerboni said the man was very
large. "What can you do with a guy
who's 100 pounds bigger than you?"
she asked. "Do you need a
bodyguard to go to a party?"
After Zerboni was released from
the assailant's grip, she left, along
with Higgins and Hein. The three
females returned home. Hein later
re-entered the party and said he wit
nessed a fight between two males,
one of whom he said was the as
sailant.
Others at the party said they had
seen the fight but did not remember
the incidents involving the freshmen.
