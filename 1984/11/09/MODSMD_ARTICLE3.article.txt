# Students describe attack at campus party
## Women file assault charges 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Daily staff 
Two female freshmen were assaulted at a frater
nity party at approximately 11:15 last night and
have filed charges with Stanford Police, according
to four freshmen â€” the two filing charges and two
witnesses.
Charlotte Lowson, a resident of Eucalypto
House in Lagunita Court, said she was grabbed by
a large, blond male who tried to "rip off [her]
clothes in front of a large group of people" at a
Beta Theta Pi party. She has filed assault-and
battery charges against the man.
The man is believed not to be a member of the
Beta fraternity.
Cathy Zerboni, also of Eucalypto, said she was
attacked by the same male minutes later. She has
also filed charges of assault and battery.
Mike Hein, also of Eucalypto, and Jill Higgins, of
Lagunita's Adelfa House, corroborated the stories

of the two women. All four freshmen said they did
not know the assailant.
The male has not been positively identified, al
though the four said they believed he was a Stan
ford football player whose picture they picked out
of a 1984 football guide later last night.
Police said early this morning that they were
close to making a definite identification.
The four freshmen described the event in the fol
lowing way.
A male grabbed Lowson and tried to force her to
dance with him.
Lowson said she told him, "Look, 1 have to go to
the bathroom," tore herself away, ran upstairs and
remained there for about 10 minutes.
Lowson said the man was waiting upstairs for her
and chased her downstairs once he saw her. Low
son and Hein both said they saw the assailant grab
Lowson at the bottom of the stairs.
Lowson said the assailant "grabbed me . . . tore

my jacket off completely and was ripping my
clothes off me. My whole stomach was exposed; he
had my shirt half off."
According to the four freshmen, Zerboni, Hig
gins and Hein all attempted to stop the assailant
forcibly while 10 to 20 people looked on but made
no attempt to help.
"Everyone was circling around watching," Hig
gins said.
"Nobody was doing anything, and it was obvious
that she was in trouble," Hein said.
The four freshmen each said friends of the as
sailant laughed and even cheered him on.
"I was really just trying to give him pain to get
him off her," Zerboni said.
Higgins and Zerboni said they dug nails into the
assailant's skin and "had his thumb bent back to his
wrist," but that he continued to attack Lowson.
