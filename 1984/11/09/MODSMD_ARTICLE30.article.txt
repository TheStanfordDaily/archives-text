Entering the Cedar St. Cafe for
lunch one Saturday, we opted to sit
inside at one of the tables by the win
dow. The Cafe opens at 11:30 a.m.
and, although it was slightly chilly
outside, indoors the sun streamed in
through the skylights, creating a
warm, cheery feeling.
Outside seating is also available,
but inside you can listen to the music
and view the colorful edible garden
— or salad buffet, as it is properly
named.
It is difficult to say whether Cedar
St. Cafe's specialty is the oyster bar,
as I was told, or the salad buffet. My
favorite was definitely the salad buf
fet; however, I didn't sample the
oysters so perhaps I'm a poor judge. I
did share an order of steamed clams
(12 for $5.50) with my friend. They
were tasty, but nothing special. The
clams were served in a butter and
herb broth, which neither over
powered nor enhanced the flavor of
the clams to any great degree. I also
ordered the combination clam chow
der soup and a medium salad ($3.95).
The soup was delicious and refills
were free.
"Buffet" aptly describes the ar
rangement of salads from which you
can choose when you make a trip to
fill your salad plate. (If you want to
visit the buffet more than once, an
all-you-can-eat salad is $4.95)
I was impressed by the variety of*
salads and the skillful way they were
displayed. An assortment of items was
neatly arranged among salt rocks with
a crab, shells and other articles fur
ther decorating the buffet. You might
decide to skip the green salad and in
stead fill your plate with the other of

ferings. To begin, there is a pasta
salad and tabouli. Tabouli is rice with
spices, finely chopped tomato and
scallions. Next were my favorites:
chicken salad and crab salad.
The chicken salad was fantastic;
however, upon eating it I realized
there was no chicken in it! The
mixture included walnuts, juicy

raisins, apples and celery; the
chicken's absence was not missed. I
would recommend they label the
various salads so customers know
what they are selecting.
The crab salad was very tasty and
the tender crab wasn't lost among the
other ingredients. In addition, there
were potato and macaroni salads,
coleslaw, fruit and various dressings,
including cucumber and plain yogurt.
Lunch entrees include roast beef,
top sirloin, fresh-fish sandwiches and
a daily special. For dinner, which in
cludes soup, the salad buffet and a
beverage, you may choose Miami
Roast ($8.95), Top Sirloin steak
($9.95) or fresh fish.
The menu does not emphasize

desserts, but simply says to ask the
server for the daily selection. She
didn't seem particularly sure of what
the desserts were and brought the
white cake with custard filling out to
show us. Besides this white, surgary
cake with a thin layer of custard,
there was chocolate cake and an Ital
ian dessert which our waitress said

was prepared by a friend of the
owner. The cakes both looked like
they might have been prepared by
food service, and we decided to split
one of the Italian creations, which
was a flaky pastry crescent surround
ing a mixture of chopped nuts and
ricotta cheese. This was scrumptuous.
Cedar St. Cafe combines very
pleasant surroundings, both indoors
and out, with a limited but well
selected menu which is bound to
please even the most demanding
diners. Dress as you please: This is a
casual cafe catering to a diverse clien
tele.
