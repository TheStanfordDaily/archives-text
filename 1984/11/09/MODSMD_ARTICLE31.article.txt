## Duck's Breath: odd enough but not always too hilarious 
### CATHY JANUS 
The Bijou Theatre presented an
other comedy show last Friday and
Saturday evening. Duck's Breath
Mystery Theatre made a special two
night apearance to a sell-out crowd at
its first Bay Area performance this
fall. New skits were featured, includ
ing "Oedipussy," Greek tragi
comedy in which James Bond finds
himself entrapped by an archvillain,
who, in the line of the real Oedipus,
turns out to be his own mother.
The Ducks have an almost cultlike
following in the Bay Area, where
they migrated after their college years
in lowa. Their humor, often
compared to Monty Python's, builds
on memories of growing up in Middle
America and experiences of everyday
life.
While the audience seemed to find
Duck's Breath's antics amazingly
funny, I was disappointed by its
overall performance. However unus
ual its wit. Duck's Breath's jokes
and satire were weak and the pace of
the show was slow.
Other Stanford students in atten
dance also commented that, though the
performance had its humorous mo
ments, they were largely unimpressed
by the group. Compared to other
comedy acts which have appeared at
the Bijou, Duck's Breath Mystery
Theatre left something to be desired.
Each member of the comedy quin
tet displayed his own bizarre style of
humor, accentuated by comic expres
sions and outlandish costumes. The
show was divided into two parts.
Before intermission, the members of
Duck's Breath performed individu
ally or in pairs. Mr. Science, one of
the classic showpieces of the group,
answered four questions that were
supposedly scribbled on paper by
people in the audience. Neither the
questions, nor the answers, were es
pecially funny or clever. If the ques
tions were indeed taken from the au
dience, we can excuse their lack of
originality and only suggest that Mr.
Science invent his own questions so
that he'll have more time to come up
with witty answers.
After intermission, the group came
on stage together. It was at this point
that the pace quickened and the jokes
and skits became funnier.
Some of the highlights included a
"slide show" where the Ducks
assumed various questions resem

bling famous paintings. Two of the
more humorous human paintings
were the "Birth of Venus" and
"Nude Descending the Staircase".
The positions assumed were not easy
to guess beforehand, so in this case to
see was to laugh.
At one point lan Sholes came on as
the mile-a-minute sneerer and said
how he hated everything from kids to
the excuses for the invasion of
Grenada. He talked fast, which was
too bad. This was one of the funniest
parts and should have lasted longer.
When performers attempt to en
courage audience participation that
extends beyond laughter, they risk
falling on their faces. Often,
audiences don't respond. But when
Bill Allard started conducting the
"Old McDonald Had A Farm," and

more specifically, "The Second
Movement," as he called the pig
verse, the audience followed his lead
and joined in enthusiastically.
1 was wary when he started because
he divided the audience in half and 1
thought we were just going to sing in
rounds. Instead he led us in a single
verse; no ducks, cows or chickens â€”
just pigs. He directed the audience
through tempo changes, crescendos
and diminuendos and at one point he
had us stop and go over a single
phrase, saying "A little bigger on the
pig. Take it from Old McDonald
had. . . By the end I think we
rivaled the Mormon Tabernacle
Choir.
Duck's Breath Mystery Theatre
