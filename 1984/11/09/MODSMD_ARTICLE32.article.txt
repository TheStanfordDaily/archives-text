### JOHN WALLIN TELFORD WORK 
Bin Country — Steeltown ★ ★
>/ 2
Big Country's music is
supposed to be fresh, serious,
poetic, innovative, danceable,
and pastoral. (These were ac
tual adjectives contributed by a
fan.) However, our listen to
"Steeltown" was rather forget
table and our reactions were
more lukewarm than positive.
The band's sound is hardly
unique (cousins U2 and The
Alarm contribute liberally),
and while each track's poetic

and musical images are not
without their good points, each
is like every other. It is hard to
discern one song from another,
and the lyrics are difficult to
understand without the inner
sleeve as a guide. None of these
songs has the sense of together
ness and energy that distin
guished "Wonderland" from
all the rest of Big Country's
material — in fact, none of
"Steeltown" is likely to achieve
hit status. While the sound isn't
irritating like that of so many
other unistyle bands, it ulti

mately fails to capture the lis
tener's interest or enthusiasm
and winds up uneventful, unar
resting background music.

I' rankie Goes to Hollywood —
Welcome to the
Pleasuredome * ★ '/2
The difficulty in reviewing
this album lies in separating its
true musical worth from all the
hype and pretentiousness sur
rounding and obscuring it.
Judging from the abundancy of
self-hype, the band sells itself
as God's gift to "The Quake."
And it and everyone else
seem to be buying it. However,
once stripped away from its
image, FGTH's music is spotty
and underdeveloped. The over
repetition of each song's well

intentioned but simple melody
limits its effectiveness and
prevents songs from conveying
entire concepts clearly. The

end result of all this is only a
collection of disjointed, under
written songs that turn off the
listener. The scope of FGTH's
music is basically limited to war
and sex (interspersed with
pseudo-artistic dialogue be
tween songs) and these are
paraded before the audience
more for shock value than for
serious treatment. All in all,
this 65-minute double album is
a bunch of near-creative con
cepts thrown together, hyped
beyond belief and only barely
worthy of the marginal success
it will receive. Critics say: No
more.

Windham Hill — Sampler
1984 ★ ★ ★
The Windham Hill label,
founded by former Stanfordite
William Ackerman, caters ex

clusively to mood musicians,
offering relaxing yet
moderately challenging in
strumental pieces to young ur
ban professionals with expensive
stereos. This sampler provides
an inexpensive, diverse intro
duction into the genre, present
ing eight tracks from eight dif
ferent artists. Some of the
pieces are truly background,
pleasant but not really engag
ing, while others are worth lis
tening to on their own.
Windham Hill's music is best
listened to during study or so
phisticated conversation, and
though its sound is definitely

not aggressive enough for a
mainstream crowd, the easy
textures of the music help wash
away tension, refresh creativity
and divert one's attentions
away from the stresses of daily
life. While none of Windham
Hill's music can match the
technical proficiency or artistic
excellence of real progressive
jazz, the sampler is as cheap,
diverse, and easy-to-swallow
an introduction as is likely to be
found anywhere.
