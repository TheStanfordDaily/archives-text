# General Public: 'All the Rage'
## 
### RON MAST 
Lovers of the English Beat rejoiced
recently with the release of the first
General Public album, "All the
Rage." General Public is the name of
the new group formed by Dave
Wakeling and Ranking Roger, lead
singers of the now dismantled English
Beat.
Those who have listened to the al
bum know that it was well worth the
wait. Wakeling and Roger have lost
none of the happy, upbeat sound that
characterized the Beat. In fact, this
album contains more "fun" music
than "Special Beat Service," the final
English Beat album.
"All the Rage" begins with "So
Hot You're Cool." This song is a
mixture of a strong beat and sexy
lyrics such as "Legs against my
chest/stomach tight and wet." Al
though the song has not had much
airplay, it's my pick for the next Gen

eral Public song to reach the charts.
"Tenderness" and "Never You
Done That" were the first two songs
to have reached the radio audience;
they are the two strongest songs on
the album. Both are romantic songs
with an edge of bitterness.
In "Tenderness" Wakeling asks,
"Why should the morning always find
you unimpressed?" In "Never You
Done That," he sings of "a kind of
love that could last forever"; yet,
later we find him on his "knees saying
please/please don't never you go too
far away from me, girl."
Perhaps the most political song on
the album is "Burning Bright." This
song has been described by Wakeling
himself as referring "to the situation
in Europe, the European theater or a
nuclear holocaust. Whichever you
choose."
The song most endeared by the

group itself is "Where's the Line?"
Through this song General Public
searches for that elusive "line be
tween lust and love."
In "As a Matter of Fact," the group
tells of a repressive society — "just
mind your ass when the buck gets
passed ... as a matter of fact the
cards are stacked."
This song as well as most on the al
bum contain the now trademark lyrics
of Ranking Roger. Lyrics such as
"tek dat an dat an dat," or "brr bop
skippm" are scattered throughout the
songs, but nowhere do we find a con
centration of ska lyrics to rival those
of "Spar wid Me" or "Pato and
Roger a go Talk" from the Beat's
final album.
The album ends with the song
"General Public," a type of anthem
for the band. The song urges you as a
listener to "come and join the federa

tion, we could have communication."
Through this song the band urges
change in at least their devoted lis
teners — "seek out individuality . . .
face it now 'cause it's reality." The
lyrics of this song make it the most
poignant on the album.
If you enjoyed the English Beat
when they were together, and espe
cially if you loved "Special Beat Ser
vice," I highly recommend this
album. It seems that in forming Gen
eral Public, Wakeling and Roger
were able to cast off any inconsis
tencies in their music. The group took
two years to create this album, and
the result is a highly polished effect.
The songs are all enjoyable to listen
to, but as with all good albums, the
lyrics must be read to receive the al
bum's full impact.
Those who were fortunate enough
to get tickets were able to see Gen

eral Public live as the band played the
Kabuki last Thursday and Friday
nights.
Opening the Friday show were The
Uptones, a nine-piece group from our
beloved sister city of Berkeley. The
Uptones have a very tight, brassy
sound and were a great complement
for General Public.
General Public's show was one of
the better concerts I have enjoyed.
General seating at the Kabuki led to
no room to move, no breath and a
great view of the band.
Through the course of the night,
General Public played every song on
the new album. From the English
Beat days came the "Can't Get Used
to Losing You" from "Just Can't
Stop It," "Hit It"from "What Is
Beat?" and "Save It for Later" and
"End of the Party" from "Special
Beat Service."

After all this, the band was not
ready to quit, nor was the crowd will
ing to let them. Taking requests from
the audience, the group played
several songs in duplicate.
Because General Public has only
one album, the band wisely has kept
this tour to small club dates. For this
reason, the Kabuki shows were the
perfect time to see General Public as
close as possible. It may not be possi
ble to jump up on stage and sing with
your arm around Dave Wakeling or
Ranking Roger again; a thrill that
many of us at the concert actually ex
perienced.
It's hard to explain the amount of
energy and crowd enthusiasm present
at the Kabuki last Friday night, but
one thing is sure: General Public is
going nowhere but up, and you
should see them while you can.
General Public truly is "All the
Rage."

the album. Both are romantic songs
with an edge of bitterness.
In "Tenderness" Wakeling asks,
"Why should the morning always find
you unimpressed?" In "Never You
Done That," he sings of "a kind of
love that could last forever"; yet,
later we find him on his "knees saying
please/please don't never you go too
far away from me, girl."
Perhaps the most political song on
the album is "Burning Bright." This
song has been described by Wakeling
himself as referring "to the situation
in Europe, the European theater or a
nuclear holocaust. Whichever you
choose."
The song most endeared by the

group itself is "Where's the Line?"
Through this song General Public
searches for that elusive "line be
tween lust and love."
In "As a Matter of Fact," the group
tells of a repressive society — "just
mind your ass when the buck gets
passed ... as a matter of fact the
cards are stacked."
This song as well as most on the al
bum contain the now trademark lyrics
of Ranking Roger. Lyrics such as
"tek dat an dat an dat," or "brr bop
skippm" are scattered throughout the
songs, but nowhere do we find a con
centration of ska lyrics to rival those
of "Spar wid Me" or "Pato and
Roger a go Talk" from the Beat's
final album.
The album ends with the song
"General Public," a type of anthem
for the band. The song urges you as a
listener to "come and join the federa

tion, we could have communication."
Through this song the band urges
change in at least their devoted lis
teners — "seek out individuality . . .
face it now 'cause it's reality." The
lyrics of this song make it the most
poignant on the album.
If you enjoyed the English Beat
when they were together, and espe
cially if you loved "Special Beat Ser
vice," I highly recommend this
album. It seems that in forming Gen
eral Public, Wakeling and Roger
were able to cast off any inconsis
tencies in their music. The group took
two years to create this album, and
the result is a highly polished effect.
The songs are all enjoyable to listen
to, but as with all good albums, the
lyrics must be read to receive the al
bum's full impact.
Those who were fortunate enough
to get tickets were able to see Gen

eral Public live as the band played the
Kabuki last Thursday and Friday
nights.
Opening the Friday show were The
Uptones, a nine-piece group from our
beloved sister city of Berkeley. The
Uptones have a very tight, brassy
sound and were a great complement
for General Public.
General Public's show was one of
the better concerts I have enjoyed.
General seating at the Kabuki led to
no room to move, no breath and a
great view of the band.
Through the course of the night,
General Public played every song on
the new album. From the English
Beat days came the "Can't Get Used
to Losing You" from "Just Can't
Stop It," "Hit It"from "What Is
Beat?" and "Save It for Later" and
"End of the Party" from "Special
Beat Service."

After all this, the band was not
ready to quit, nor was the crowd will
ing to let them. Taking requests from
the audience, the group played
several songs in duplicate.
Because General Public has only
one album, the band wisely has kept
this tour to small club dates. For this
reason, the Kabuki shows were the
perfect time to see General Public as
close as possible. It may not be possi
ble to jump up on stage and sing with
your arm around Dave Wakeling or
Ranking Roger again; a thrill that
many of us at the concert actually ex
perienced.
It's hard to explain the amount of
energy and crowd enthusiasm present
at the Kabuki last Friday night, but
one thing is sure: General Public is
going nowhere but up, and you
should see them while you can.
General Public truly is "All the
Rage."

Lovers of the English Beat rejoiced
recently with the release of the first
General Public album, "All the
Rage." General Public is the name of
the new group formed by Dave
Wakeling and Ranking Roger, lead
singers of the now dismantled English
Beat.
Those who have listened to the al
bum know that it was well worth the
wait. Wakeling and Roger have lost
none of the happy, upbeat sound that
characterized the Beat. In fact, this
album contains more "fun" music
than "Special Beat Service," the final
English Beat album.
"All the Rage" begins with "So
Hot You're Cool." This song is a
mixture of a strong beat and sexy
lyrics such as "Legs against my
chest/stomach tight and wet." Al
though the song has not had much
airplay, it's my pick for the next Gen

eral Public song to reach the charts.
"Tenderness" and "Never You
Done That" were the first two songs
to have reached the radio audience;
they are the two strongest songs on
the album. Both are romantic songs
with an edge of bitterness.
In "Tenderness" Wakeling asks,
"Why should the morning always find
you unimpressed?" In "Never You
Done That," he sings of "a kind of
