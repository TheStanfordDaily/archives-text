# 'Shrew' – acting between the lines
## 
### ELAINE WANG 
There's a stirring production of
Shakespeare's "The Taming of the
Shrew" at the Stanford Theatre, pre
sented by the Oregon Shakespeare
Festival (Ashland).
Having seen Ashland before in
their Oregon setting — and marveled
at their performance — 1 looked
forward to seeing them closer to
home. Most of the summer Shake
speare productions are held in an out
door Elizabethan stage, and I
worried about "The Taming of the
Shrew" in an enclosed theater. The
concern, however, was entirely un
warranted. This is a grand production
in an elegant theater; to see it is to
have a better idea of good theater.
The production is traditional, and
the Bard's script is closely followed,
except for the exclusion of the induc
tion scenes with Christopher Sly, a
peddlar who is persuaded that he is a
lord, and in fact watches "The
Taming of the Shrew" as a play in his
house. According to director Pat Pat
ton, interjecting the Sly scenes with
those of Kate and Petruchio would
distract the audience and take up act
ing space onstage (by having Sly al
ways there).
Budget concerns were a high
priority, too, since the touring group
already numbers 27 members. But
mainly, Patton said he wanted to
focus on the relationship and action
of Kate and Petruchio.
And it's a marvelous evocation of
the fiery tempers of both of them; the
danger inherent in "The Taming" is
its treatment of women and the wo
man's role, and Shakespeare's words
themselves may be misconstrued as
Petruchio being the ultimate
"winner" and Katherina being com
pletely subdued.
In the Ashland production now
playing at Stanford Theatre, the rela
tionship between Katherina and
Petruchio begins as an out-and-out

fight, often physical and angry. In the
end it is a game of mutual admiration
of the other's strength, such as when
Petruchio insists on the sun being the
moon and threatens to turn back
when Katherina argues that it is,
indeed, the sun. She humors him, and
continues to do so even when he bids
her to address an elderly man as a
young girl, then chides her for making
a mistake. Katherina (Joan Stuart-
Morris) apologizes then, and explains
that the sun blinded her; Stuart-
Morris glances back at Petruchio (Joe
Vincent), pointing at the "moon"
before she finishes saying "sun." Vin-

every gesture.

cent gestures, "OK, OK, it's the sun,"
and she receives his reply — his con
cession — with a curtsey and a smile.
These moments are tender, fun;
they allow us to believe that the mar
riage will be a happy one where both
wife and husband respect each other's
force of personality. The transition
from immature shrew to poised,
strong woman happens subtly; per
haps the first real evidence of Kath
erina's growing love for Petruchio is
the sun and moon scene, which ends
with Stuart-Morris throwing her arms
around Vincent when the rest of the
party has gone ahead, then abruptly
withdrawing. Vincent courteously of
fers her his hand, and the two stroll
off the stage; Vincent turns, then, to
us and gives the A-OK sign.
Ashland shows Shakespeare at his
best; the company pays tremendous

attention to the detail of every
gesture, whether subtle or apparent,
and often incorporates what the
audiences of today more easily recog
nize. Comic touches such as a bit of
slapstick are added throughout the
production — such as when Kath
erina insists on having her new cap,
and Petruchio takes it off her head.
She grabs it and puts it on; he takes it
off; she puts it on; he puts it on; and
she snatches it off and hands it to him,
then realizes what has happened. This
is done swiftly and naturally by
Stuart-Morris and Vincent; they are a
harmonious team.
The teams of master-servant are
also wonderfully natural, with much
interplay and comic touches. Shake
speare gives the servants and other
smaller parts definite personalities
and a place in the plot; Ashland acts
between the lines to bring out, for ex
ample, the relationship of Grumio
with the rest of Petruchio's servants
at home. And the acting is impec
cably credible.
As on the outdoor Elizabethan
stage, the set is simple and plain. Two
figurines playing tug-of-war atop the
stage flats, however, constantly
remind us of the childishness — of
both Katherina's and Petruchio's
tantrums — and ultimately the game
of the relationship.
The Elizabethan costumes are
lavish and, with skillful lighting, make
"The Taming of the Shrew" a stun
ning performance; this is especially
striking when we see the characters
up close, when they scurry off the
stage, through the audience and out
the side exits. Ashland often plays to
the audience — their antics are irre
sistible, their quiet and emotional
moments are moving.
If Oregon isn't a much-traveled
spot for you, or even if it is, this is a
fine time to see Ashland's "The
Taming of the Shrew," playing at the
Stanford Theatre through Sunday.
