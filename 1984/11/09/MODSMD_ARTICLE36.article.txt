# 'Man for All Seasons' —fear for our season?
## 
### NANCY HENRY 
Set in 16th-century England during the reign of Henry
VIII, Robert Bolt s "A Man for All Seasons" dramatizes
the battle between the Catholic Church and the king
that began over Henry's desire to divorce his wife Cath
erine and ended in the establishment of the Anglican
Church. Sir Thomas More, lord chancellor of the state and
personal friend to Henry, revered the laws of state, but
not more than those of God; he refused to condone the
divorce, and resigned his position. More, however, was
destined to face this issue again, and when Henry declared
himself head of the church two years later, More could not
recognize him. Adherence to a principle and refusal to
compromise cost him his life.
Whenever institutions clash, it is inevitably people who
suffer. But in order to maintain individual and therein col
lective integrity, a person must know where he or she
stands. This is ultimately a play about More the individ
ual, and it is appropriate that in this production by The
Company, Richard Myhre as Thomas More gives a true
tour de force, standing as far above most of the other ac
tors as the character did above his peers. . . .
Myhre's More is not perfectly balanced — attempts at
humor are particularly awkward throughout — but Myhre
above all manages to capture the transformation that oc
curs in his character over the course of the play. In the
opening scene, More is in control of his life. The actor
naturally conveys the calm maturity and the paternal
image of humility and stability that earned More the
respect of all who knew him; but that respect, ironically,
degenerates as the man fights to uphold the very prin
ciples that make him who he is. As he is attacked from all
sides, More's most intense struggle is with himself. It tears
him apart and the passionate, confused, but determined
More at the play's end seems more like a frightened
animal taking refuge in the dogma that had for so long
supported him. This is Myhre's success and it is the pro
duction's greatest strength.
One effective theatrical device is the contrast of More's

character with those around him. The philosophical dis
tance is most obvious when they are physically closest.
The egocentric King Henry, played by David Higinbot
ham, and the cold, calculating Thomas Cromwell, played
by Jim Saliba, are just two of the morally reprehensible
characters that oppose More. While all are competent,
only Nancy Sue Beagle as Alice More joins Myhre in a
truly sensitive and believable performance. As the woman
who challenges and cannot understand her husband, she
nonetheless accepts him and provides the love and sup
port when he most needs it.
The most outstanding feature of the play is undoubtedly
the set, although The Company contributes only a few
simple props. "A Man For All Seasons" is staged in
Memorial Church, and, provided the voices are not
swallowed by the cavernous expanse of the stone walls, a
more effective atmosphere could not be found. The stage
surrounds the audience and maintains a pious ambiance
and a splendor of color and light that work in the play's fa
vor at all times.
The play is traditional and effective, but there is more
than an aesthetic reason to see it. To the extent that
theater causes us to reflect and question ourselves, it is of
great value. Many timeless issues are raised here: church
and state, public duty and private conscience. Their timely
application is significant. Given the temper of our times
and the prevalent political winds that show no sign of let
ting up, certain words in this play may ring disturbingly in
our ears.
"I believe when statesman forsake their own private
conscience for the sake of their public duties they lead
their country by short route to chaos," More says.
"You would like that wouldn't you? To govern the
country by prayers?" Cardinal Wolsey responds.
"Yes, I should," More replies.
Words meant to generate admiration could generate
true fear in us.
"A Man for All Seasons" plays through tomorrow in
Memorial Church.
