Harvest (1937)
Cubbcrley Theatre (4000 Middlefield
Rd„ Palo Alto)
The French comic actor Fernandel has
a horse's face with a flattened jaw (you'd
think someone had taken a steam iron to
it), cauliflower ears and outsize floppy
lips hanging over a massive set of gleam
ing teeth. In Marcel Pagnol's beautiful
film (based on a novel by Jean Giono),
he plays Gedemus the knife grinder, an
endearing coward in a deserted moun
tain village; he takes in a young actress
who's been thrown out of a traveling
troupe and then raped by some local
miners. As the actress, Arsule, Orane
Demazis, best known as Fanny in Pag
nol's "Marius"-"Fanny"-"Cesar" tril
ogy, has an old-style Comedie Francaise

vibrato, hut she looks like a French
Fanny Brice, and she gives a very affect
ing performance. This movie belongs to
a fine Western European tradition: It's
an agrarian film, a paean to the land.
Pagnol is so honest, so simple in his
means, that the sentimentality never
grows cloying.
Plays Wednesday evening at 8.
Some Like It Hot (1959)
Kresge Auditorium
The setting is first Chicago and then
Miami in 1929; Jack Lemmon and Tony
Curtis play two musicians who have the
bad luck to witness the St. Valentine's
Day Massacre and then must run for
their lives. In order to escape their pur

suers, they don drag and join an all-girls'
band, where they — and we — have the
good luck to encounter Marilyn Monroe.
Monroe, who gets to sing "Running
Wild," "1 Wanna Be Loved by You"
and "I'm Through with Love," is at her
sweetly ingenuous, amateurishly appeal
ing best in this dizzy farce, one of the few
memorable comedies of the 19505, and
her two leading men give extremely
skillful performances (especially Curtis,
whose imitation of Cary Grant in the
passive-aggressive seduction scene is a
high point). Billy Wilder produced, di
rected and co-wrote the picture (with his
frequent partner, I.A.L. Diamond), and
he assembled a witty supporting cast.
George Raft, Pat O'Brien, George E,
Stone and Mike Mazurki show up to

spoof roles they played earlier in their
careers, and the woefully underrated
'30s comic Joe E. Brown gives his most
endearing performance as millionaire
Osgood Fielding, who falls madly in love
with Jack Lemmon and delivers the most
famous curtain line in movie history.
Plays tonight at 9.
Si Ik wood (1983)
Memorial Auditorium
As Karen Silkwood, the young woman
employed by Kerr-Magee's nuclear
plant in Oklahoma who became more
and more convinced that her bosses
were guilty of criminal negligence, Meryl
Streep gives a fairly compelling,
rhythmed performance, studied and
beautifully modulated, with flashes of
humor. But though Streep's gorgeous,
ravaged face tells us that she's deep in
thought, we never know what she's
thinking. Both Cher (as Karen's best
friend, Dolly) and Kurt Russell (as her
live-in boy friend. Drew) are more elo
quent than she is, and they don't have to
work as hard for their effects; they're
both naturals. Mike Nichols' movie,
written by Nora Ephron and Alice Ar
len, lopes along — it could use trimming
and zippier pacing and editing, as well as
a consistent narrative line. The film's
point of view is more deeply depressive
and defeatist than that of most
"problem" pictures; its theme song is
"Amazing grace/How sweet the
sound/That saved a wretch like me" —
with the accent on "wretch".
Plays Sunday evening at 7 and 9:30.
Othello (1965)
Bijou, Palo Alto
326-6196
Laurence Olivier altered his walk and
lowered his voice an octave to play
Shakespeare's Moor of Venice for En
gland's National Theatre in the early
19605; this transformation could serve

as a metaphor for the magic of great act
ing. Stuart Burge's screen version is just
a filmed play, but it preserves what may
be the most sublime performance by the
greatest actor of our time. On every
level — physical, vocal, imaginative and
emotional — Olivier matches extraordi
nary daring with a level of accomplish
ment that seems almost supernatural.
No one else would think of attempting
an epileptic fit the way he does, or the
romantic flourish with which he dabs
lago's cheeks with a rose after returning
from Desdemona's chamber, and no one
else could possibly bring off these
scenes. Olivier is the Michelangelo of ac
tors, expanding the realm of what art —
and man — can ascend to. The once-in
a-lifetime cast includes Frank Finlay (a
chilling lago). Maggie Smith (a spirited
Desdemona), Derek Jacobi (Roderigo)
and Joyce Redman (Emilia).
Plays Monday.
Being There (1979)
Bijou, Palo Alto
This movie, adapted by Jerzy Kosinski
from his own novel and directed by Hal
Ashby, is like one of those British
comedies from the 1950s that expanded
on one particularly clever joke. Peter
Sellers gives a wonderful performance as
Chance, a mentally deficient middle
aged man who has never learned to read
or write and is taken as a genius by
practically everybody. At times the
picture seems too reserved — almost
somber — and the handsome production
(shot by Caleb Deschanel) is a little
overblown and drawn out; but the cast
underplays skillfully, and the film is very
entertaining.
Plays Wednesday with "Moscow on
the Hudson."
Stage D00r(1937)
Festival, Palo Alto
329-1848
"I don't know where you will find so

much delight and unspoiled entertain
ment as in the RKO picture Stage
Door,' " Otis Ferguson wrote when this
comedy-drama about life in a boarding
house for aspiring actresses was first
released. Morrie Ryskind and Anthony
Veiller adapted a George Kaufman-
Edna Ferber melodrama that was fairly
moldy on Broadway in and
Gregory I.a Cava directed it; the film
retains all of the melodrama but plays up
the humor. It's lively stuff, and it
features some of the most distinctive
actresses of the era — principally Kat
harine Hepburn and Ginger Rogers, but
also Constance Collier, Eve Arden. Gail
Patrick. Andrea Leeds and Lucille Ball.
Plays through Wednesday with
"Bringing Up Baby."
The Man Who Would Be King
(1975)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
323-6411
John Huston and Gladys Hill adapted
Rudyard Kipling's superb short story,
omitting many of its ambiguities and
neutralizing its controversial political
content, but it's a handsome, highly en
tertaining movie nonetheless, and it con
tains what is likely Huston's best
sustained direction since the early 1950s
(though his work in between was often
fascinating). In a triumph of casting, Mi
chael Caine plays the con-man adven
turer who sets out to become rich in a
mountain area of India, and Sean Con
nery plays his less-swift pal, whose role
in the scheme is to become king of the
local tribe. At first Connery, with his
dark, bewhiskered balloon face, seems
too big, physically and vocally, for his
role, but as the film proceeds he finds
uses for his frame and his deep, resonant
voice: He takes on the look and sound of
a king.
Plays Sunday with "Lawrence of
Arabia."

ing performance. This movie belongs to
a fine Western European tradition: It's
an agrarian film, a paean to the land.
Pagnol is so honest, so simple in his
means, that the sentimentality never
grows cloying.
Plays Wednesday evening at 8.
Some Like It Hot (1959)
Kresge Auditorium
The setting is first Chicago and then
Miami in 1929; Jack Lemmon and Tony
Curtis play two musicians who have the
bad luck to witness the St. Valentine's
Day Massacre and then must run for
their lives. In order to escape their pur

suers, they don drag and join an all-girls'
band, where they — and we — have the
good luck to encounter Marilyn Monroe.
Monroe, who gets to sing "Running
Wild," "1 Wanna Be Loved by You"
and "I'm Through with Love," is at her
sweetly ingenuous, amateurishly appeal
ing best in this dizzy farce, one of the few
memorable comedies of the 19505, and
her two leading men give extremely
skillful performances (especially Curtis,
whose imitation of Cary Grant in the
passive-aggressive seduction scene is a
high point). Billy Wilder produced, di
rected and co-wrote the picture (with his
frequent partner, I.A.L. Diamond), and
he assembled a witty supporting cast.
George Raft, Pat O'Brien, George E,
Stone and Mike Mazurki show up to

spoof roles they played earlier in their
careers, and the woefully underrated
'30s comic Joe E. Brown gives his most
endearing performance as millionaire
Osgood Fielding, who falls madly in love
with Jack Lemmon and delivers the most
famous curtain line in movie history.
Plays tonight at 9.
Si Ik wood (1983)
Memorial Auditorium
As Karen Silkwood, the young woman
employed by Kerr-Magee's nuclear
plant in Oklahoma who became more
and more convinced that her bosses
were guilty of criminal negligence, Meryl
Streep gives a fairly compelling,
rhythmed performance, studied and
beautifully modulated, with flashes of
humor. But though Streep's gorgeous,
ravaged face tells us that she's deep in
thought, we never know what she's
thinking. Both Cher (as Karen's best
friend, Dolly) and Kurt Russell (as her
live-in boy friend. Drew) are more elo
quent than she is, and they don't have to
work as hard for their effects; they're
both naturals. Mike Nichols' movie,
written by Nora Ephron and Alice Ar
len, lopes along — it could use trimming
and zippier pacing and editing, as well as
a consistent narrative line. The film's
point of view is more deeply depressive
and defeatist than that of most
"problem" pictures; its theme song is
"Amazing grace/How sweet the
sound/That saved a wretch like me" —
with the accent on "wretch".
Plays Sunday evening at 7 and 9:30.
Othello (1965)
Bijou, Palo Alto
326-6196
Laurence Olivier altered his walk and
lowered his voice an octave to play
Shakespeare's Moor of Venice for En
gland's National Theatre in the early
19605; this transformation could serve

as a metaphor for the magic of great act
ing. Stuart Burge's screen version is just
a filmed play, but it preserves what may
be the most sublime performance by the
greatest actor of our time. On every
level — physical, vocal, imaginative and
emotional — Olivier matches extraordi
nary daring with a level of accomplish
ment that seems almost supernatural.
No one else would think of attempting
an epileptic fit the way he does, or the
romantic flourish with which he dabs
lago's cheeks with a rose after returning
from Desdemona's chamber, and no one
else could possibly bring off these
scenes. Olivier is the Michelangelo of ac
tors, expanding the realm of what art —
and man — can ascend to. The once-in
a-lifetime cast includes Frank Finlay (a
chilling lago). Maggie Smith (a spirited
Desdemona), Derek Jacobi (Roderigo)
and Joyce Redman (Emilia).
Plays Monday.
Being There (1979)
Bijou, Palo Alto
This movie, adapted by Jerzy Kosinski
from his own novel and directed by Hal
Ashby, is like one of those British
comedies from the 1950s that expanded
on one particularly clever joke. Peter
Sellers gives a wonderful performance as
Chance, a mentally deficient middle
aged man who has never learned to read
or write and is taken as a genius by
practically everybody. At times the
picture seems too reserved — almost
somber — and the handsome production
(shot by Caleb Deschanel) is a little
overblown and drawn out; but the cast
underplays skillfully, and the film is very
entertaining.
Plays Wednesday with "Moscow on
the Hudson."

"I don't know where you will find so

much delight and unspoiled entertain
ment as in the RKO picture Stage
Door,' " Otis Ferguson wrote when this
comedy-drama about life in a boarding
house for aspiring actresses was first
released. Morrie Ryskind and Anthony
Veiller adapted a George Kaufman-
Edna Ferber melodrama that was fairly
moldy on Broadway in and
Gregory I.a Cava directed it; the film
retains all of the melodrama but plays up
the humor. It's lively stuff, and it
features some of the most distinctive
actresses of the era — principally Kat
harine Hepburn and Ginger Rogers, but
also Constance Collier, Eve Arden. Gail
Patrick. Andrea Leeds and Lucille Ball.
Plays through Wednesday with
"Bringing Up Baby."
The Man Who Would Be King
(1975)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
323-6411
John Huston and Gladys Hill adapted
Rudyard Kipling's superb short story,
omitting many of its ambiguities and
neutralizing its controversial political
content, but it's a handsome, highly en
tertaining movie nonetheless, and it con
tains what is likely Huston's best
sustained direction since the early 1950s
(though his work in between was often
fascinating). In a triumph of casting, Mi
chael Caine plays the con-man adven
turer who sets out to become rich in a
mountain area of India, and Sean Con
nery plays his less-swift pal, whose role
in the scheme is to become king of the
local tribe. At first Connery, with his
dark, bewhiskered balloon face, seems
too big, physically and vocally, for his
role, but as the film proceeds he finds
uses for his frame and his deep, resonant
voice: He takes on the look and sound of
a king.
Plays Sunday with "Lawrence of
Arabia."

Harvest (1937)
Cubbcrley Theatre (4000 Middlefield
Rd„ Palo Alto)
The French comic actor Fernandel has
a horse's face with a flattened jaw (you'd
think someone had taken a steam iron to
it), cauliflower ears and outsize floppy
lips hanging over a massive set of gleam
ing teeth. In Marcel Pagnol's beautiful
film (based on a novel by Jean Giono),
he plays Gedemus the knife grinder, an
endearing coward in a deserted moun
tain village; he takes in a young actress
who's been thrown out of a traveling
troupe and then raped by some local
miners. As the actress, Arsule, Orane
Demazis, best known as Fanny in Pag
nol's "Marius"-"Fanny"-"Cesar" tril
ogy, has an old-style Comedie Francaise

vibrato, hut she looks like a French
Fanny Brice, and she gives a very affect
