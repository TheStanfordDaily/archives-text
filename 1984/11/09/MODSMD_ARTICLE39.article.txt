# Solidarity maintains interest

### TODD RAMMING 
Solidarity. Since the founding of this labor union in Au
gust 1980, Americans have looked to Lech Walesa and
the Polish workers as a center of resistance against the So
viet Union.
Although Solidarity no longer makes headlines here
everyday, interest about Poland remains among citizens of
this country. Yesterday, a crowd of about 75 gathered at
noon in the Bechtel International Center to hear Ellen
Comisso address "The Politics of Economic Reform in
Hungary and Poland."
Comisso, formerly an associate professor of political
science at the University of California at San Diego, now
serves as a fellow at the Stanford Center for Advanced
Study in the Behavioral Sciences.
In January 1981, six months after the founding of
Solidarity, Comisso journeyed to Budapest, Hungary, for
a year of research. In her speech yesterday, she said one
question had occurred to her again and again during her
stay: "Why did Solidarity arise in Poland and not in Hun
gary?"
One must not suppose, she said, that the economic sit
uation in Hungary is any better than that in Poland. Hun
gary suffers from a greater labor shortage, a larger per
capita national debt and a worse standard of living than
does Poland. With all these factors favoring a protest by
the workers in Hungary, why then did a trade union not
arise, she asked.
Comisso traced the answer back to the political up
heavals of 1956. In that year, in both Hungary and
Poland, the workers rose up in protest In Poland, the So
viet leaders found that they could use protest as a weapon
against each other, she said.

By controlling the various factions of workers, one gov
ernment official could build a power base to seize more
political strength, she said. To settle the protests, the So
viet Union did effect a change in the top leadership of
Poland, but no further action was taken.
In Hungary, on the other hand, the Soviets had no
choice but to invade to restore order. The aftershocks of
this full-Hedged military invasion have remained deeply
ingrained in the people of Hungary, she said.
In the late 1960s and early '70s, disillusionment of the
working class again came to the fore. In response, the gov
ernment of Hungary issued the New Economic Mecha
nism (NEM) in 1968. Poland, similarly, created new giant
enterprises which were granted a great deal of autonomy.
In both Poland and Hungary, these semi-private com
panies began to gain too much power, she said. Remem
bering the invasion of 1956, the Hungarian government
quickly reversed many of the liberties granted by NEM so
as to remove any powerful opposition to the government,
she said.
In Poland, however, where the true danger of a worker
uprising had never really made itself felt, Edward Gierek,
the leader of the Polish government, decided to bargain.
The leaders on all levels of Polish government made
many, often contradictory, promises to the protesting
groups, she said. As a result, the Communist Party in
Poland fragmented.
By 1980, "the party just couldn't control itself," she
said. With a weakened government and confident
workers, Solidarity arose.
In her concluding remarks, Comisso noted that Poland,
Hungary, and the other Russian satellite governments
have now realized that "conditions of unity (of the party)
subvert economic reform."
