# Planners look to the future

### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
University planners, looking to the
year 2000 and beyond, are updating a
22-year-old county land-use docu
ment in an effort to "bring it into con
formity" with Stanford's 1980 Land
Use Plan.
Planners are seeking to modify the
designated use of 1 2 separate parcels
of Stanford land that fall under the
authority of Santa Clara County. The
changes would amend the 1962
county land-use permit by allowing
the University to develop more
campus land at a greater degree of
density.
Campus Planner Jim Oswald said
the modifications are necessary to
protect unforeseen expansion needs.
"We plan for the long term because
we really don't know what's going to
happen," Oswald said. "It's difficult
to predict."
Oswald stressed that the purpose of
these changes is to bring the county

land use permit into conformity with
the Stanford's 1980 land plan so that
"we have plans that jive with each
other." He said any short-term devel
opment would be minimal.
"Are we doing this to get ready for
a whole bunch of development? No,
that's not what we're doing," Oswald
said.
Phil Williams, director of planning,
said the new plan is designed to rear
range potential development, not to
spur expansion.
"This has nothing to do with our
rate of growth," Williams said. "It
only has to do with where we put
things. It's location more than any
thing else.
"It's a matter of bringing every
thing up to date so it matches," Wil
liams said.
Williams said development "within
the next five to 10 years" would be
limited to office and surge space
along the Sand Hill corridor, faculty
housing in the Ryan Laboratory area

near Stanford Avenue and Junipero
Serra Boulevard, the Environmental
Safety Facility just north of the Stan
ford Golf Course and academic ex
pansion in the medical and sciences
area.
The modified county permit pro
vides for medium- to high-density in
struction and research in areas along
Sand Hill Road, Quarry Road, Palm
Drive and at the intersection of
Campus Drive and Serra Street
(across from the campus Shell sta
tion).
In addition, the permit makes pos
sible future faculty housing in the
Searsville Berm, just west of Roble
Field, and in Gerona Triangle, across
Junipero Serra from the entrance to
the "Dish."
Williams said development of these
areas might occur "at some point,"
but no plans have been prepared.
"We don't want to consume our
land at any more rapid a rate than we
have to, because it's a finite

resource," Williams said.
Last night, Oswald, Williams and
consultant Ira Fink presented these
permit modifications to about 70
people in Kresge Auditorium.
Williams discussed the necessity of
updating the county document and
explained the county's role in this
project. Fink showed slides of each of
the 12 sites and described the changes
as proposed by the modification
plans.
The audience, composed mainly of
local community residents and county
officials, seemed most concerned
about the effect that these changes
might have on their neighborhoods.
Fink's firm was hired by the Uni
versity to prepare an Environmental
Impact Report (EIR) on the project.
The county requested an EIR last
April, when Stanford first proposed
the modifications.
Oswald said last nicht's meeting
was designed to elicit feedback from
the community on the proposed
changes.
"We decided it would be a good
idea to hear from the neighbors," Os
wald said. "We just want to let people
know what we're doing."
Fink said he would consider all
comments — both those expressed
last night and those received by the
planning office in writing — in pre
paring the EIR.
Oswald said a draft of the EIR
should be completed by February, at
which time planners will schedule an
other public meeting for its presenta
tion. The final document probably
will be filed with the county by June,
he said.
