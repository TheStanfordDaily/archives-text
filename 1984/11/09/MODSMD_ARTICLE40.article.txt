Blazing butterballs, Batman, it's
here!
We'll skip the string of hoary
platitudes and get to the point: Mark
Wilson has finally finished The
Daily's Vol. 186 T-shirt design. It's
all a little hard to describe, so we
won't. We will, however, say this:
Any staffer who wants one of these
100-percent cotton, short-fileeve
doozies had better make his inten
tions known soon. The idea is to have
the shirts in time for our glorious vic
tory over the staff of The Daily
Californian in the Ink Bowl next Sat
urday. So sign up in the editorial of
fice now, which means sometime
before Monday morning. Time is run
ning out.
Time is always running out for edit
board, of course. Time begins today
at 1 p.m.
