# An ASSU veteran who gives his all
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
When Jim McGrath receives his
graduate degree in computer sci
ence this June, he will leave be
hind seven years of service with
the ASSU.
Included in those seven years
are four terms as a graduate
senator and memberships on
countless committees. McGrath is
also largely responsible for
numerous structural changes in
the daily operation of student gov
ernment here.
McGrath. 25, entered Stanford
from New York City in 1977,
planning to study mathematical
and political sciences. It was then,
as a freshman, that the senator-to
be first began serving on ASSU
committees.
Since that time, McGrath's
name has become synonymous
with student government here,
and he is now almost a permanent
fixture in the ASSU offices. He
has often been the innovating
force of this organization, and on
occasion he has been the center of
scorn as well.

Today, in the midst of his fourth
term in the senate, McGrath is
every bit as active in the ASSU as
ever, serving on the Administra
tion and Rules Committee and as
a member of the Coffee House
Board of Directors.
Looking back on his ASSU ten
ure, McGrath says he considers
himself "a good senator," some
one who investigates students'
complaints, votes intelligently and
represents his constituency.
McGrath says the "high degree
of influence with colleagues" he
commands is not due to
"longevity" in the senate, but
rather to the time and effort he in
vests in the ASSU. as well as his
ability to "return the faith and
trust" of his constituency.
McGrath terms himself "a
cooperative individual' who gets
along "very well" with most of his
cohorts. "I respect people who are
willing to put in the time, energy
and effort necessary" to be a
senator, he says, noting that such
individuals have his "automatic
respect and help."
