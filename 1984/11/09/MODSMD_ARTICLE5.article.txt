# An ASSU veteran who gives his all
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
When Jim McGrath receives his
graduate degree in computer sci
ence this June, he will leave be
hind seven years of service with
the ASSU.
Included in those seven years
are four terms as a graduate
senator and memberships on
countless committees. McGrath is
also largely responsible for
numerous structural changes in
the daily operation of student gov
ernment here.
McGrath. 25, entered Stanford
from New York City in 1977,
planning to study mathematical
and political sciences. It was then,
as a freshman, that the senator-to
be first began serving on ASSU
committees.
Since that time, McGrath's
name has become synonymous
with student government here,
and he is now almost a permanent
fixture in the ASSU offices. He
has often been the innovating
force of this organization, and on
occasion he has been the center of
scorn as well.

Today, in the midst of his fourth
term in the senate, McGrath is
every bit as active in the ASSU as
ever, serving on the Administra
tion and Rules Committee and as
a member of the Coffee House
Board of Directors.
Looking back on his ASSU ten
ure, McGrath says he considers
himself "a good senator," some
one who investigates students'
complaints, votes intelligently and
represents his constituency.
McGrath says the "high degree
of influence with colleagues" he
commands is not due to
"longevity" in the senate, but
rather to the time and effort he in
vests in the ASSU. as well as his
ability to "return the faith and
trust" of his constituency.
McGrath terms himself "a
cooperative individual' who gets
along "very well" with most of his
cohorts. "I respect people who are
willing to put in the time, energy
and effort necessary" to be a
senator, he says, noting that such
individuals have his "automatic
respect and help."


Jim McGrath
Despite long hours of work at the
ASSU, McGrath has sometimes
drawn the wrath of fellow senators.
According to McGrath, it was the
consensus of other senators that last
month's initiative to limit the number
of terms a senator can serve "was di
rected at certain individuals."
Many believe the individual in
question was McGrath.
But that proposal, which needed
the approval of 14 senators, was
voted down 7-11. "It rejuvenated my
faith in my colleagues," McGrath
says, adding that the proposal was
"inappropriate" because it is "bad to
make policy to fit particular individ
uals."
That effort by a minority of the
senate cannot cloud what McGrath
considers to be some of his greatest
accomplishments as a senator.
He cites the fee-assessment
reforms made during his first and
second senatorial terms as one such
achievement. He says it was
impossible at that time to get fee as
sessments to pass, despite majority
approval by students, because too few
people voted to meet the 20-percent
voter-participation requirement.

Today, McGrath says there is
"more accountability" in the process,
as groups are required to submit
detailed budgets outlining planned
expenditures and intents. "The stu
dent body has a better idea of where
the money is being spent," he says.
He adds that nearly 50 percent of
all students currently participate in
ASSU elections.
McGrath also proudly points to his
accomplishments in the area of
graduate student activities. Serving as
chair of the Graduate Education and
Research Committee for two years,
he notes the efforts made by himself
and fellow Graduate Senator Eric
Berg in the area of graduate student
housing.
McGrath says he and Berg sought
more affordable graduate student
housing on campus and "saved
several hundreds of thousands of dol
lars for the graduate community"
with certain recommendations imple
mented by the University.
While acknowledging the anger
many graduate students in Escondido
Village still hold toward the Univer
sity over rent increases, McGrath says
the situation would he a lot worse had
he and Berg not taken action.
McGrath says he and Berg often
joked that if they could have 10 per
cent of the graduate housing savings

they were responsible for, they could
"live like kings."
Another accomplishment McGrath
notes is the work done to "strengthen
the senate as an institution within the
ASSU." He says that for a long time,
the senate had been perceived as "a
laughing stock" which had "never
been able to get its act together." He
adds that the senate "didn't have
much credibility with the administra
tion."
That image, McGrath says, has
changed "quite radically." He says
current complaints about the senate
are that it is too powerful: Tho body
"most responsive to the people now
has the most power," he says.
In the past, McGrath says members
of the Council of Presidents tried to
work around the senate, but this is no
longer the case. He says relations be
tween the COP, senate and the finan
cial manager have improved signifi
cantly and Work between the three
branches of the ASSU is accom
plished more harmoniously.
After graduation, McGrath says he
plans "to be like every other Stanford
studentâ€” make money and get rich."
He says he wants to work for a high
technology firm in the Silicon Valley,
noting that it's "too cold in Boston
and too hot in Texas."

and too hot in Texas."
When Jim McGrath receives his
graduate degree in computer sci
ence this June, he will leave be
hind seven years of service with
the ASSU.
Included in those seven years
are four terms as a graduate
senator and memberships on
countless committees. McGrath is
also largely responsible for
numerous structural changes in
the daily operation of student gov
ernment here.
McGrath. 25, entered Stanford
from New York City in 1977,
planning to study mathematical
and political sciences. It was then,
as a freshman, that the senator-to
be first began serving on ASSU
committees.
Since that time, McGrath's
name has become synonymous
with student government here,
and he is now almost a permanent
fixture in the ASSU offices. He
has often been the innovating
force of this organization, and on
occasion he has been the center of
scorn as well.

Today, in the midst of his fourth
term in the senate, McGrath is
every bit as active in the ASSU as
ever, serving on the Administra
tion and Rules Committee and as
a member of the Coffee House
Board of Directors.
Looking back on his ASSU ten
ure, McGrath says he considers
himself "a good senator," some
one who investigates students'
complaints, votes intelligently and
represents his constituency.
McGrath says the "high degree
of influence with colleagues" he
commands is not due to
"longevity" in the senate, but
rather to the time and effort he in
vests in the ASSU. as well as his
ability to "return the faith and
trust" of his constituency.
McGrath terms himself "a
cooperative individual' who gets
along "very well" with most of his
cohorts. "I respect people who are
willing to put in the time, energy
and effort necessary" to be a
senator, he says, noting that such
individuals have his "automatic
respect and help."


Jim McGrath
Despite long hours of work at the
ASSU, McGrath has sometimes
drawn the wrath of fellow senators.
According to McGrath, it was the
consensus of other senators that last
month's initiative to limit the number
of terms a senator can serve "was di
rected at certain individuals."
Many believe the individual in
question was McGrath.
But that proposal, which needed
the approval of 14 senators, was
voted down 7-11. "It rejuvenated my
faith in my colleagues," McGrath
says, adding that the proposal was
"inappropriate" because it is "bad to
make policy to fit particular individ
uals."
That effort by a minority of the
senate cannot cloud what McGrath
considers to be some of his greatest
accomplishments as a senator.
He cites the fee-assessment
reforms made during his first and
second senatorial terms as one such
achievement. He says it was
impossible at that time to get fee as
sessments to pass, despite majority
approval by students, because too few
people voted to meet the 20-percent
voter-participation requirement.

Today, McGrath says there is
"more accountability" in the process,
as groups are required to submit
detailed budgets outlining planned
expenditures and intents. "The stu
dent body has a better idea of where
the money is being spent," he says.
He adds that nearly 50 percent of
all students currently participate in
ASSU elections.
McGrath also proudly points to his
accomplishments in the area of
graduate student activities. Serving as
chair of the Graduate Education and
Research Committee for two years,
he notes the efforts made by himself
and fellow Graduate Senator Eric
Berg in the area of graduate student
housing.
McGrath says he and Berg sought
more affordable graduate student
housing on campus and "saved
several hundreds of thousands of dol
lars for the graduate community"
with certain recommendations imple
mented by the University.
While acknowledging the anger
many graduate students in Escondido
Village still hold toward the Univer
sity over rent increases, McGrath says
the situation would he a lot worse had
he and Berg not taken action.
McGrath says he and Berg often
joked that if they could have 10 per
cent of the graduate housing savings

they were responsible for, they could
"live like kings."
Another accomplishment McGrath
notes is the work done to "strengthen
the senate as an institution within the
ASSU." He says that for a long time,
the senate had been perceived as "a
laughing stock" which had "never
been able to get its act together." He
adds that the senate "didn't have
much credibility with the administra
tion."
That image, McGrath says, has
changed "quite radically." He says
current complaints about the senate
are that it is too powerful: Tho body
"most responsive to the people now
has the most power," he says.
In the past, McGrath says members
of the Council of Presidents tried to
work around the senate, but this is no
longer the case. He says relations be
tween the COP, senate and the finan
cial manager have improved signifi
cantly and Work between the three
branches of the ASSU is accom
plished more harmoniously.
After graduation, McGrath says he
plans "to be like every other Stanford
studentâ€” make money and get rich."
He says he wants to work for a high
technology firm in the Silicon Valley,
noting that it's "too cold in Boston
and too hot in Texas."
