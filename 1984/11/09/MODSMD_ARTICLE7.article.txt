Weinberger protestors arrested
SAN FRANCISCO — Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said last
night that no American forces are tin alert for action in Central America
because of reports that Soviet MiG-2 1 jet fighters were transported to a
Nicaraguan port.
"There are no forces alerted or anything of that kind," Weinberger
told reporters following a $125-a-plate dinner in which he was honored
as Man of the Year by the San Francisco Bay area USO.
Asked if there were any circumstances in which the Reagan adminis
tration would "openly go to war in Central America," Weinberger
responded, "We don't anticipate or see any. We don't answer hypotheti
cal questions, but I don't see any circumstances."
During the dinner, more than a dozen people were arrested as about
900 protesters, many shouting slogans against U.S. intervention in
Nicaragua, demonstrated in front of the St. Francis Hotel on Union
Square.
Riot-clad police on horseback, motorcycles and on foot confronted
protesters, and police used nightsticks to punch out the lights of at least
one television camera that officers said blinded them.
Banging empty paint cans, pounding drums and chanting, the
demonstrators crowded into Union Square across from the hotel and
later began a march across the city.
Education Secretary Bell resigns
WASHINGTON — Secretary of Education Terrel Bell, who took of
fice four years ago with a mandate to dismantle his agency but who
wound up battling to strengthen it, yesterday became the first cabinet
member to bow out of a second Reagan-administration term.
Bell, who turns 63 on Sunday, said he would resign at year's end to
return to his teaching job at the University of Utah. The only cabinet
secretary who is not a millionaire, Bell said the need to tend to his Salt
Lake City sod farm and to build university retirement benefits figured
heavily in his decision to leave.
Reagan may propose flat tax-rate
SANTA BARBARA — In January President Reagan will un
veil an ambitious "tax simplification" plan — probably a modified "flat
tax" eliminating many popular deductions — and immediately try to
negotiate a bipartisan compromise with Congress, administration offi
cials said yesterday.
One White House official, who spoke on condition he not be identi
fied. outlined these basic criteria for the plan, to be developed next
month:
• It must be easily understood by the average citizen, so the president
can more easily sell his proposal to the nation.
• It must be "perceived to be fair" to the taxpayers.
• It must reduce income-tax rates so that the overall effect to the trea
sury, even if deductions are eliminated, will be "revenue neutral."
• It must attract immediate, substantial congressional support.
When one reporter expressed skepticism about whether the conserva
tive president, who is vacationing at his ranch here, really wants to elimi
nate "all tax shelters," a senior administration official replied emphati
cally: "Well, get ready."
Pinochet acts to cripple opposition
SANTIAGO, Chile — Chile's military regime used a newly decreed
state of siege yesterday to cripple the political opposition through ar
rests, press censorship and other restrictions.
President Augusto Pinochet's latest crackdown follows a week of anti
government protests in which 15 people died, including six policemen.
Two opposition groups issued statements in defiance of new censor
ship rules banning any political comment except from the government.
Chile's largest opposition party, the Christian Democrats, said the
crackdown had "left the political parties defenseless."
The Democratic Alliance, a coalition of six moderate opposition par
ties, said, "The government repression will increase the spiral of vio
lence that has started in our country." That statement also vowed a con
tinued fight against Pinochet's military rule.
Shuttle records successful launch
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — Space shuttle Discovery soared into
orbit yesterday and set off in hot pursuit of two wayward satellites,
beginning a 1.6-million-mile chase to snare the fast-moving targets and
bring them home for salvage.
"You sent us off in a fine vehicle," said commander Rick Hauck at the
end of the first day in space. "Got a good start."
After a 23-hour delay because of fierce winds aloft, the shuttle and its
four-man, one-woman crew, lifted off from the Kennedy Space Center
only 70 milliseconds late.
"That was a tremendous ascent, we really enjoyed it," astronaut Dale
Gardner told Mission Control. Gardner turned 36 yesterday, and Hauck
had promised "the biggest birthday candle of his life."
The others in Hauck's crew are pilot David Walker and mission
specialists Anna Fisher and Joe Allen.
Fisher, a physician, is the fourth American woman and first mother
named to a space flight. She and her husband, Bill, also an astronaut
physician, have a 14-month-old daughter, Kristin.
Trade deficit reaches new heights
WASHINGTON — The Commerce Department yesterday reported a
worsening international trade position for the country, with the mer
chandise trade deficit climbing to new highs for the third quarter of 1984
and the surplus in the overseas sales of U.S. services expected to drop
sharply this year.
As a result. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said the U.S. cur
rent account deficit — the broadest measure of oveseas trade in goods,
services and some government transfers — will soar to more than $100
billion this year. That will be more than twice as high as last year's deficit
of $41.6 billion.
The three-month, $33.3 billion merchandise trade deficit, moreover,
is almost as high as the entire 12-month $36.4 billion trade deficit at the
start of the Reagan administration.
Reagan rejected one-term idea
SANTA BARBARA — Two days after President Reagan scored one
of the most lopsided presidential victories in the nation's history, his
aides revealed that they had wanted him to pledge in 1978 to seek only
one term.
The idea, proposed as Reagan prepared to challenge incumbent Presi
dent Jimmy Carter, was intended to defuse the issue of Reagan's age.
Reagan, now 73, was 69 at the time of the 1980 election.
"The advantage was it would have knocked down age as an issue and
validated his sincerity of trying to change government without being
impeded by political considerations," said James Lake, a Reagan cam
paign spokesman in 1976, 1980 and this year.
Longtime Reagan aides Michael Deaver and L.yn Nofziger suggested
the one-term-only pledge to Reagan during a 1978 airplane trip, but
Reagan was unenthusiastic about the idea, Deaver recalled yesterday.
"He said. 'Gee, fellas, I don't think that's a good idea. People expect
you to usually run for re-election. And I'd be a lame duck from the very
beginning,"' Deaver said.
Wall Street continues retreat
NEW YORK — The stock market showed some scattered losses yes
terday, still retreating from its Election-Day peak.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 4.53 to 1,228.69
after falling 10.93 points in Wednesday's session.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange slowed to 88.58 million
shares from 1 10.80 million Wednesday.

Shuttle records successful launch
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — Space shuttle Discovery soared into
orbit yesterday and set off in hot pursuit of two wayward satellites,
beginning a 1.6-million-mile chase to snare the fast-moving targets and
bring them home for salvage.
"You sent us off in a fine vehicle," said commander Rick Hauck at the
end of the first day in space. "Got a good start."
After a 23-hour delay because of fierce winds aloft, the shuttle and its
four-man, one-woman crew, lifted off from the Kennedy Space Center
only 70 milliseconds late.
"That was a tremendous ascent, we really enjoyed it," astronaut Dale
Gardner told Mission Control. Gardner turned 36 yesterday, and Hauck
had promised "the biggest birthday candle of his life."
The others in Hauck's crew are pilot David Walker and mission
specialists Anna Fisher and Joe Allen.
Fisher, a physician, is the fourth American woman and first mother
named to a space flight. She and her husband, Bill, also an astronaut
physician, have a 14-month-old daughter, Kristin.
Trade deficit reaches new heights
WASHINGTON — The Commerce Department yesterday reported a
worsening international trade position for the country, with the mer
chandise trade deficit climbing to new highs for the third quarter of 1984
and the surplus in the overseas sales of U.S. services expected to drop
sharply this year.
As a result. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said the U.S. cur
rent account deficit — the broadest measure of oveseas trade in goods,
services and some government transfers — will soar to more than $100
billion this year. That will be more than twice as high as last year's deficit
of $41.6 billion.
The three-month, $33.3 billion merchandise trade deficit, moreover,
is almost as high as the entire 12-month $36.4 billion trade deficit at the
start of the Reagan administration.
Reagan rejected one-term idea
SANTA BARBARA — Two days after President Reagan scored one
of the most lopsided presidential victories in the nation's history, his
aides revealed that they had wanted him to pledge in 1978 to seek only
one term.
The idea, proposed as Reagan prepared to challenge incumbent Presi
dent Jimmy Carter, was intended to defuse the issue of Reagan's age.
Reagan, now 73, was 69 at the time of the 1980 election.
"The advantage was it would have knocked down age as an issue and
validated his sincerity of trying to change government without being
impeded by political considerations," said James Lake, a Reagan cam
paign spokesman in 1976, 1980 and this year.
Longtime Reagan aides Michael Deaver and L.yn Nofziger suggested
the one-term-only pledge to Reagan during a 1978 airplane trip, but
Reagan was unenthusiastic about the idea, Deaver recalled yesterday.
"He said. 'Gee, fellas, I don't think that's a good idea. People expect
you to usually run for re-election. And I'd be a lame duck from the very
beginning,"' Deaver said.

Weinberger protestors arrested
SAN FRANCISCO — Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said last
night that no American forces are tin alert for action in Central America
because of reports that Soviet MiG-2 1 jet fighters were transported to a
Nicaraguan port.
"There are no forces alerted or anything of that kind," Weinberger
told reporters following a $125-a-plate dinner in which he was honored
as Man of the Year by the San Francisco Bay area USO.
Asked if there were any circumstances in which the Reagan adminis
tration would "openly go to war in Central America," Weinberger
responded, "We don't anticipate or see any. We don't answer hypotheti
cal questions, but I don't see any circumstances."
During the dinner, more than a dozen people were arrested as about
900 protesters, many shouting slogans against U.S. intervention in
Nicaragua, demonstrated in front of the St. Francis Hotel on Union
Square.
Riot-clad police on horseback, motorcycles and on foot confronted
protesters, and police used nightsticks to punch out the lights of at least
one television camera that officers said blinded them.
Banging empty paint cans, pounding drums and chanting, the
demonstrators crowded into Union Square across from the hotel and
later began a march across the city.
Education Secretary Bell resigns
WASHINGTON — Secretary of Education Terrel Bell, who took of
fice four years ago with a mandate to dismantle his agency but who
wound up battling to strengthen it, yesterday became the first cabinet
member to bow out of a second Reagan-administration term.
Bell, who turns 63 on Sunday, said he would resign at year's end to
return to his teaching job at the University of Utah. The only cabinet
secretary who is not a millionaire, Bell said the need to tend to his Salt
Lake City sod farm and to build university retirement benefits figured
heavily in his decision to leave.
Reagan may propose flat tax-rate
SANTA BARBARA — In January President Reagan will un
veil an ambitious "tax simplification" plan — probably a modified "flat
tax" eliminating many popular deductions — and immediately try to
negotiate a bipartisan compromise with Congress, administration offi
cials said yesterday.
One White House official, who spoke on condition he not be identi
fied. outlined these basic criteria for the plan, to be developed next
month:
• It must be easily understood by the average citizen, so the president
can more easily sell his proposal to the nation.
• It must be "perceived to be fair" to the taxpayers.
• It must reduce income-tax rates so that the overall effect to the trea
sury, even if deductions are eliminated, will be "revenue neutral."
• It must attract immediate, substantial congressional support.
When one reporter expressed skepticism about whether the conserva
tive president, who is vacationing at his ranch here, really wants to elimi
nate "all tax shelters," a senior administration official replied emphati
cally: "Well, get ready."
Pinochet acts to cripple opposition
SANTIAGO, Chile — Chile's military regime used a newly decreed
state of siege yesterday to cripple the political opposition through ar
rests, press censorship and other restrictions.
President Augusto Pinochet's latest crackdown follows a week of anti
government protests in which 15 people died, including six policemen.
Two opposition groups issued statements in defiance of new censor
ship rules banning any political comment except from the government.
Chile's largest opposition party, the Christian Democrats, said the
crackdown had "left the political parties defenseless."
The Democratic Alliance, a coalition of six moderate opposition par
ties, said, "The government repression will increase the spiral of vio
lence that has started in our country." That statement also vowed a con
