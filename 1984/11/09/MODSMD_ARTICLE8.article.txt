# U.S.: Ship may contain inferior planes
## Nicaraguan invasion fears grow 
### 
MANAGUA, Nicaragua — The Sandinista gov
ernment says it is arming civilians, including 20,000
student volunteers who normally help harvest cof
fee, to defend itself from a predicted U.S. invasion.
Claiming that an "escalation of aggression" indi
cated an invasion was imminent, Foreign Minister
Miguel d'Escoto announced last night that the left
ist government was mobilizing its reserve defense
forces.
He also told reporters and foreign diplomats that
Nicaragua was requesting an urgent meeting of the
U.N. Security Council to denounce the alleged acts
of aggression, saying they "pose a situation that is
extremely grave."
He charged that a U.S. spy plane caused sonic
booms yesterday over Managua and listed several
other complaints. These included "harassment" of
a Soviet freighter by U.S. Navy frigates inside
Nicaraguan waters, deployment of U.S. warships in
the Caribbean and Pacific, and "very suspicious
movements" in at least three U.S. Army bases in
the United States.

Pentagon spokesmen refused to comment on the
overflights, hut denied that U.S. Navy vessels had
entered Nicaraguan waters. They also denied a
Sandinista claim that a U.S. military plane was
chased away by gunfire Wednesday near the Pacific
port of Corinto, where the Soviet frieghter docked.
In Washington, Reagan administration officials
raised the possibility the Soviet vessel may not con
tain MiG fighters, as had been suggested, but less
sophisticated Czech-built L-39-ZA trainer plane.
Unlike the MiG-21s, the L.-3y-/.A is subsonic
and its air-to-ground capability would make it use
ful against U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebels fighting
the Sandinistas.
The Reagan administration has said it would
regard any delivery of MiGs with "utmost concern"
and has not ruled out the possibility of a pre
emptive strike to neutralize them. Nicaragua has
denied receiving advanced warplanes.
Pentagon officials said military exercises by U.S.
forces were under way at Fort Stewart, Ga., but
were not related to Nicaragua. D'Escoto men

tinned Fort Stewart as one of the military installa
tions where "suspicious movements were taking
place.
At a rally late yesterday in Managua. Agriculture
Minister Jaime Wheelock announced that "general
plans for the defense ot the country will begin as of
today and a ritle will he issued to every youth, to
every person so that person can defend the
homeland."
Wheelock, a colonel in the Sandinista army, told
some of the 20,000 students who are recruited an
nually to help with the coffee harvest that they will
instead be sent to barracks to form part of the na
tional militia.
Wheelock said the coffee crop — Nicaragua's top
export _ will be picked by "old people, women
and farmers." "We preler the loss of the coltee
than the loss of the country, he said.
