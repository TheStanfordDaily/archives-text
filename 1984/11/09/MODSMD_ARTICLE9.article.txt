### 
SANTA BARBARA — The So
viet Union has expressed interest in a
U.S. proposal for talks between Sec
retary of State George Shultz and So
viet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko on arms-control issues,
perhaps leading to resumption of
negotiations to limit nuclear weap
ons, a senior administration official
said yesterday.
The Soviets responded to the pro
posal as recently as last week by ask
ing questions through diplomatic
channels about how such talks would
work, the official said.
The Reagan administration will be
attempting "in the days and weeks
ahead to try to get agreement to open
"umbrella' talks" dealing with arms
control issues "across the board," he
said.

President Reagan first suggested
such talks vaguely in a speech to the
U.N. General Assembly in Septem
ber and later discussed them during a
White House meeting with Gromyko.
They could begin in a few months if
the Soviets agree, according to the of
ficial, who spoke on condition that he
not be identified.
The official suggested that the
Soviets might be more willing to
begin such talks now that Reagan has
been re-elected. Asked about
prospects that the Soviets will agree,
the official said, "I'm right between
hopeful and encouraged."
Under the current thinking, the of
ficial said, the talks would be con
ducted by Shultz and Gromyko, each
of whom could be accompanied by "a
high-level, experienced, technically

qualified expert."
administration believes the
"umbrella" talks would produce
agreements to "split off specific
areas of superpower disagreement on
arms control and resume negotiations
on them, the official said.
Separate negotiations on limiting
intermediate-range nuclear missiles
and intercontinental ballistic missiles
have been stalled since the Soviets
walked out last year, protesting
deployment of U.S. Pershing 2 and
cruise missiles in Western Europe.
The Shultz-Gromyko talks would
cover those areas and also chemical
weapons, space systems, confidence
building measures and conventional
forces in Europe, he said.
The official said Reagan and others
in the administration have concluded

that the Soviets "had laid down
rather rigid requirements" for return
ing to the two sets of talks and that a
new forum allowing "conceptual ex
change" would be a ♦'useful vehicle"
to get negotiations started again.
The official said the United States
earlier this year developed new
negotiating positions on limiting nu
clear weapons and would use the
"umbrella" talks to show the Soviets
that U.S. positions are flexible.
"We have developed new positions
in virtually every area ot arms con
trol. In short, we are flexible. But the
president does not intend to make
unilaterally different proposals"
before negotiations begin, he said.
