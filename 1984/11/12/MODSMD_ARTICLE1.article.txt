# Assault case arrest made
## Student: 'I'm sick about it' 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Daily staff 
A Stanford sophomore was arrested Friday
evening and released on $500 bail after four female
students charged that he attacked them at a campus
party Thursday night.
David Keane, 20, turned himself in to campus
police Friday when he "woke up and got the idea
that something had gone wrong." Later that after
noon, police obtained a warrant for Keane's arrest.
The warrant included one charge of misdemeanor
sexual battery and three charges of misdemeanor
simple battery.
"I'm just sick about it," Keane said this
weekend. "1 haven't been able to sleep. I'm just
very sorry about the entire thing."
Keane said he does not remember anything he
did Thursday night. "I can't say anything for
myself. I was stupid enough to get so drunk that I
don't remember even being at the party," he said.
"I realize it was irresponsible of me. I've learned a
big lesson."
Alleged victims and witnesses have given differ
ent accounts of the incidents Thursday night.
Freshmen Charlotte Lowson and Cathy Zerboni
— two of the students who have filed charges —
told The Daily last week that Lowson was attacked
at a Beta Theta Pi party by a large, blond man at
approximately 11:15 Thursday night while 10 to 20
people watched, and even laughed, but refused to
come to Lowson's aid. Lowson said the assailant
tried to "rip off [her] clothes in front of a large
group of people."
Zerboni said she was attacked by the same male
minutes later at the party.
Two other freshmen — Jill Higgins and Mike
Hein — corroborated Lowson and Zerboni's ac
counts.
"Everyone was circling around watching," Hig
gins said.
"Nobody was doing anything, and it was obvious
that she was in trouble,"' Hein said.
The four freshmen said they struggled to free
Lowson from the assailant while his friends cheered
him on.
"It's like being played with in the middle of an
audience, 10 people laughing," Zerboni said.
Campus police did not release the names of the
other two women who filed charges against Keane.
Several people said they saw Keane at the Beta
House party Thursday night. Keane is neither a
member of the Beta fraternity nor a resident of the
house. A pledge of the currently unhoused Zeta Psi
fraternity, Keane lives at Robinson House in Ster
ling Quad and is a reserve tight end on Stanford's
football team.
Beta members said they were shocked over the
incidents. "Only two Betas knew until this morning
what was going on," said junior Patrick McCrystle
Friday night.
McCrystle said he and junior Roberto Zamora
were the only Beta members who witnessed the in
cident. He said he saw Keane grab Lowson at the
foot of the stairs on the main floor of the Beta
House. "He was right at my feet," McCrystle said.
"It was hard to make out what happened at first.
My first thought was that he slipped or passed out."
McCrystle said he realized after seeing Lowson
struggle that "she did not want to be where she
was." He said he then grabbed Keane and told him
to "let go."
"Myself and another guy were the only ones who
realized what was going on," McCrystle said. "And
when we realized the two of us could not take care
of it, I yelled to (senior) Terry Jackson, 'Come over
and stop this guy.' "
McCrystle said Jackson, who is the starting
noseguard on Stanford's football team, released
