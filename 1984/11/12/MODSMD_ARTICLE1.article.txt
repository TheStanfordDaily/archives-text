# Assault case arrest made
## Student: 'I'm sick about it' 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Daily staff 
A Stanford sophomore was arrested Friday
evening and released on $500 bail after four female
students charged that he attacked them at a campus
party Thursday night.
David Keane, 20, turned himself in to campus
police Friday when he "woke up and got the idea
that something had gone wrong." Later that after
noon, police obtained a warrant for Keane's arrest.
The warrant included one charge of misdemeanor
sexual battery and three charges of misdemeanor
simple battery.
"I'm just sick about it," Keane said this
weekend. "1 haven't been able to sleep. I'm just
very sorry about the entire thing."
Keane said he does not remember anything he
did Thursday night. "I can't say anything for
myself. I was stupid enough to get so drunk that I
don't remember even being at the party," he said.
"I realize it was irresponsible of me. I've learned a
big lesson."
Alleged victims and witnesses have given differ
ent accounts of the incidents Thursday night.
Freshmen Charlotte Lowson and Cathy Zerboni
— two of the students who have filed charges —
told The Daily last week that Lowson was attacked
at a Beta Theta Pi party by a large, blond man at
approximately 11:15 Thursday night while 10 to 20
people watched, and even laughed, but refused to
come to Lowson's aid. Lowson said the assailant
tried to "rip off [her] clothes in front of a large
group of people."
Zerboni said she was attacked by the same male
minutes later at the party.
Two other freshmen — Jill Higgins and Mike
Hein — corroborated Lowson and Zerboni's ac
counts.
"Everyone was circling around watching," Hig
gins said.
"Nobody was doing anything, and it was obvious
that she was in trouble,"' Hein said.
The four freshmen said they struggled to free
Lowson from the assailant while his friends cheered
him on.
"It's like being played with in the middle of an
audience, 10 people laughing," Zerboni said.
Campus police did not release the names of the
other two women who filed charges against Keane.
Several people said they saw Keane at the Beta
House party Thursday night. Keane is neither a
member of the Beta fraternity nor a resident of the
house. A pledge of the currently unhoused Zeta Psi
fraternity, Keane lives at Robinson House in Ster
ling Quad and is a reserve tight end on Stanford's
football team.
Beta members said they were shocked over the
incidents. "Only two Betas knew until this morning
what was going on," said junior Patrick McCrystle
Friday night.
McCrystle said he and junior Roberto Zamora
were the only Beta members who witnessed the in
cident. He said he saw Keane grab Lowson at the
foot of the stairs on the main floor of the Beta
House. "He was right at my feet," McCrystle said.
"It was hard to make out what happened at first.
My first thought was that he slipped or passed out."
McCrystle said he realized after seeing Lowson
struggle that "she did not want to be where she
was." He said he then grabbed Keane and told him
to "let go."
"Myself and another guy were the only ones who
realized what was going on," McCrystle said. "And
when we realized the two of us could not take care
of it, I yelled to (senior) Terry Jackson, 'Come over
and stop this guy.' "
McCrystle said Jackson, who is the starting
noseguard on Stanford's football team, released
Lowson from Keane's grip.
Jackson could not be reached for
comment this weekend.
Asked about the allegation that
people were standing around cheer
ing, McCrystle said he "can com
pletely discredit it."
Zamora corroborated McCrystle's
account of the struggle, but said when
asked about the reported cheering, "1
wasn't noticing what was going on
around me."
"After a while we started trying to
throw his hands off [Lowson]."
Zamora said. "Terry helped take his
hands off."
McCrystle also said he did his
"level best" to see that Keane left the
party. He said that he later saw
Keane outside the Beta House, grab
bing a woman again. "His friends
were trying to stop him as best as they
could," McCrystle said. "Some of his
friends helped get him away."
Beta House Resident Assistant
Mike Melendez, a second-year law
student here, said Friday night. "The

house understands the gravity of the
incident."
The Beta House residents decided
hy a unanimous vote at a house
meeting earlier Friday night to cancel
this week's Thursday party and to
meet after Thanksgiving to discuss
the future of their weekly bar nights.
A key issue appears to be whether
there were onlookers who did not
help Lowson but instead laughed and
cheered.
McCrystle said he saw no observers
egging Keane on. Lowson and Zer
boni said again yesterday that a group
of people were watching and laughing
and not offering any help.
Lowson and Zerboni said yester
day that they — and also Higgins and
Hein — "are all really sure about"
their accounts of Keane's friends
cheering him on.
Zerboni said Keane's friends hurt
him by not stopping him. "If his
friends had stepped in, he wouldn't
be in the position he's in now, with
four girls filing charges against him."
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Her
rington said Friday afternoon that
police had not yet interviewed the
witnesses in depth, but that the

"onlooker" accusation appeared
credible.
"I would say at this point, my im
pression was that there were others
that saw this and didn't do anything,
but I can't verify that yet," Her
rington said Friday.
Keane was asked whether any of
his friends were at the Beta House on
Thursday night and were willing to
give their accounts of the incidents.
"1 have many friends who want to
speak on my behalf, but I'd rather
they didn't, because I'm afraid they'd
make light of the situation," Keane
said. "I take it very seriously."
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said that based on Lowson's
account of the Thursday night party
"three things went wrong." He listed
the three possible violations of Uni
versity code as one individual
sexually assaulting another, individ
uals watching an attack without help
ing in any way, and a host organiza
tion failing to ensure that "things like
this don't happen."
Lyons said the University would
proceed with its own investigation,
autonomous from that of the police.
He raised the question of whether the

two separate investigations constitute
"double jeopardy" for Keane, and
answered himself with a strong "no."
Lyons said the University will eval
uate the actions in accordance with a
different "standard" from that of the
law. "The University's judicial appa-

ratus reflects values which do not
simply reflect the values of the larger
society," he said.
He said that students, without act
ing illegally, may have violated the
University's code Thursday night
simply by "sitting back and watch

ing."
"This raises the question of
whether watching a student being as
saulted and failing to intervene is a
violation of the (University's) funda
mental standard," Lyons said.
The fundamental standard is the
University's formal code of accep
table behavior.
Lyons called Keane's alleged ac
tions "unacceptable."
"It's not behavior that can be
tolerated," he said.
Keane offered his perceptions of
the incidents in an interview yester
day.
"I want to stress that 1 take it
seriously. 1 want to face up to it. But 1
think it's been sensationalized quite a
bit. . . . It's been blown out of propor
tion.
"I don't want people thinking I
sexually assault girls. I'm not that
kind of person. My girlfriend and my
friends know what type of person I
am," he said, noting the support they
have given him over the past three
days.
Lowson and Zerboni said yester
day that they, too, have received
much support from friends.

"Girls have come up to me and
said, 'This has happened to me
before. I'm glad you went to the
police.' They've been very suppor
tive," Lowson said.
A housemate gave the roommates
a bouquet of flowers after the inci
dent.
But the two women said they had
also received two prank calls Friday
night and now make sure their door is
locked each night before they go to
sleep. "Wc unplugged the phone
Friday night and last night, Zerboni
said.
Lowson and Zerboni said they are
not concerned with seeing Keane
punished severely but rather with
raising awareness on campus.
"That's what I hoped to do by
reporting the whole thing, Lowson
said. "1 want people to believe that
this can happen.
"I just want a positive outcome,'
she continued. "We're not vindictive,
we're not anti-fraternity. I don't want
to just hurt this guy and nothing to
have changed. I'm not downplaying
the event [by saying] 1 don't want to
ruin this guy's life, but we have no
desire just to be vindictive."

hands off."
McCrystle also said he did his
"level best" to see that Keane left the
party. He said that he later saw
Keane outside the Beta House, grab
bing a woman again. "His friends
were trying to stop him as best as they
could," McCrystle said. "Some of his
friends helped get him away."
Beta House Resident Assistant
Mike Melendez, a second-year law
student here, said Friday night. "The

house understands the gravity of the
incident."
The Beta House residents decided
hy a unanimous vote at a house
meeting earlier Friday night to cancel
this week's Thursday party and to
meet after Thanksgiving to discuss
the future of their weekly bar nights.
A key issue appears to be whether
there were onlookers who did not
help Lowson but instead laughed and
cheered.
McCrystle said he saw no observers
egging Keane on. Lowson and Zer
boni said again yesterday that a group
of people were watching and laughing
and not offering any help.
Lowson and Zerboni said yester
day that they — and also Higgins and
Hein — "are all really sure about"
their accounts of Keane's friends
cheering him on.
Zerboni said Keane's friends hurt
him by not stopping him. "If his
friends had stepped in, he wouldn't
be in the position he's in now, with
four girls filing charges against him."
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Her
rington said Friday afternoon that
police had not yet interviewed the
witnesses in depth, but that the

"onlooker" accusation appeared
credible.
"I would say at this point, my im
pression was that there were others
that saw this and didn't do anything,
but I can't verify that yet," Her
rington said Friday.
Keane was asked whether any of
his friends were at the Beta House on
Thursday night and were willing to
give their accounts of the incidents.
"1 have many friends who want to
speak on my behalf, but I'd rather
they didn't, because I'm afraid they'd
make light of the situation," Keane
said. "I take it very seriously."
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said that based on Lowson's
account of the Thursday night party
"three things went wrong." He listed
the three possible violations of Uni
versity code as one individual
sexually assaulting another, individ
uals watching an attack without help
ing in any way, and a host organiza
tion failing to ensure that "things like
this don't happen."
Lyons said the University would
proceed with its own investigation,
autonomous from that of the police.
He raised the question of whether the

two separate investigations constitute
"double jeopardy" for Keane, and
answered himself with a strong "no."
Lyons said the University will eval
uate the actions in accordance with a
different "standard" from that of the
law. "The University's judicial appa-

ratus reflects values which do not
simply reflect the values of the larger
society," he said.
He said that students, without act
ing illegally, may have violated the
University's code Thursday night
simply by "sitting back and watch

ing."
"This raises the question of
whether watching a student being as
saulted and failing to intervene is a
violation of the (University's) funda
mental standard," Lyons said.
The fundamental standard is the
University's formal code of accep
table behavior.
Lyons called Keane's alleged ac
tions "unacceptable."
"It's not behavior that can be
tolerated," he said.
Keane offered his perceptions of
the incidents in an interview yester
day.
"I want to stress that 1 take it
seriously. 1 want to face up to it. But 1
think it's been sensationalized quite a
bit. . . . It's been blown out of propor
tion.
"I don't want people thinking I
sexually assault girls. I'm not that
kind of person. My girlfriend and my
friends know what type of person I
am," he said, noting the support they
have given him over the past three
days.
Lowson and Zerboni said yester
day that they, too, have received
much support from friends.

"Girls have come up to me and
said, 'This has happened to me
before. I'm glad you went to the
police.' They've been very suppor
tive," Lowson said.
A housemate gave the roommates
a bouquet of flowers after the inci
dent.
But the two women said they had
also received two prank calls Friday
night and now make sure their door is
locked each night before they go to
sleep. "Wc unplugged the phone
Friday night and last night, Zerboni
said.
Lowson and Zerboni said they are
not concerned with seeing Keane
punished severely but rather with
raising awareness on campus.
"That's what I hoped to do by
reporting the whole thing, Lowson
said. "1 want people to believe that
this can happen.
"I just want a positive outcome,'
she continued. "We're not vindictive,
we're not anti-fraternity. I don't want
to just hurt this guy and nothing to
have changed. I'm not downplaying
the event [by saying] 1 don't want to
ruin this guy's life, but we have no
desire just to be vindictive."


David Keane
A Stanford sophomore was arrested Friday
evening and released on $500 bail after four female
students charged that he attacked them at a campus
party Thursday night.
David Keane, 20, turned himself in to campus
police Friday when he "woke up and got the idea
that something had gone wrong." Later that after
noon, police obtained a warrant for Keane's arrest.
The warrant included one charge of misdemeanor
sexual battery and three charges of misdemeanor
simple battery.
"I'm just sick about it," Keane said this
weekend. "1 haven't been able to sleep. I'm just
very sorry about the entire thing."
Keane said he does not remember anything he
did Thursday night. "I can't say anything for
myself. I was stupid enough to get so drunk that I
don't remember even being at the party," he said.
"I realize it was irresponsible of me. I've learned a
big lesson."
Alleged victims and witnesses have given differ
ent accounts of the incidents Thursday night.
Freshmen Charlotte Lowson and Cathy Zerboni
— two of the students who have filed charges —
told The Daily last week that Lowson was attacked
at a Beta Theta Pi party by a large, blond man at
approximately 11:15 Thursday night while 10 to 20
people watched, and even laughed, but refused to
come to Lowson's aid. Lowson said the assailant
tried to "rip off [her] clothes in front of a large
group of people."
Zerboni said she was attacked by the same male
minutes later at the party.
Two other freshmen — Jill Higgins and Mike
Hein — corroborated Lowson and Zerboni's ac
counts.
"Everyone was circling around watching," Hig
gins said.
"Nobody was doing anything, and it was obvious
that she was in trouble,"' Hein said.
The four freshmen said they struggled to free
Lowson from the assailant while his friends cheered
him on.
"It's like being played with in the middle of an
audience, 10 people laughing," Zerboni said.
Campus police did not release the names of the
other two women who filed charges against Keane.
Several people said they saw Keane at the Beta
House party Thursday night. Keane is neither a
member of the Beta fraternity nor a resident of the
house. A pledge of the currently unhoused Zeta Psi
fraternity, Keane lives at Robinson House in Ster
ling Quad and is a reserve tight end on Stanford's
football team.
Beta members said they were shocked over the
incidents. "Only two Betas knew until this morning
what was going on," said junior Patrick McCrystle
Friday night.
McCrystle said he and junior Roberto Zamora
were the only Beta members who witnessed the in
cident. He said he saw Keane grab Lowson at the
foot of the stairs on the main floor of the Beta
House. "He was right at my feet," McCrystle said.
"It was hard to make out what happened at first.
My first thought was that he slipped or passed out."
McCrystle said he realized after seeing Lowson
struggle that "she did not want to be where she
was." He said he then grabbed Keane and told him
to "let go."
"Myself and another guy were the only ones who
realized what was going on," McCrystle said. "And
when we realized the two of us could not take care
of it, I yelled to (senior) Terry Jackson, 'Come over
and stop this guy.' "
McCrystle said Jackson, who is the starting
noseguard on Stanford's football team, released
Lowson from Keane's grip.
Jackson could not be reached for
comment this weekend.
Asked about the allegation that
people were standing around cheer
ing, McCrystle said he "can com
pletely discredit it."
Zamora corroborated McCrystle's
account of the struggle, but said when
asked about the reported cheering, "1
wasn't noticing what was going on
around me."
"After a while we started trying to
throw his hands off [Lowson]."
Zamora said. "Terry helped take his
hands off."
McCrystle also said he did his
"level best" to see that Keane left the
party. He said that he later saw
Keane outside the Beta House, grab
bing a woman again. "His friends
were trying to stop him as best as they
could," McCrystle said. "Some of his

am," he said, noting the support they
have given him over the past three
days.
Lowson and Zerboni said yester
day that they, too, have received
much support from friends.

"Girls have come up to me and
said, 'This has happened to me
before. I'm glad you went to the
police.' They've been very suppor
tive," Lowson said.
A housemate gave the roommates
a bouquet of flowers after the inci
dent.
But the two women said they had
also received two prank calls Friday
night and now make sure their door is
locked each night before they go to
sleep. "Wc unplugged the phone
Friday night and last night, Zerboni
said.
Lowson and Zerboni said they are
not concerned with seeing Keane
punished severely but rather with
raising awareness on campus.
"That's what I hoped to do by
reporting the whole thing, Lowson
said. "1 want people to believe that
this can happen.
"I just want a positive outcome,'
she continued. "We're not vindictive,
we're not anti-fraternity. I don't want
to just hurt this guy and nothing to
have changed. I'm not downplaying
the event [by saying] 1 don't want to
ruin this guy's life, but we have no
desire just to be vindictive."


David Keane
A Stanford sophomore was arrested Friday
evening and released on $500 bail after four female
students charged that he attacked them at a campus
party Thursday night.
David Keane, 20, turned himself in to campus
police Friday when he "woke up and got the idea
that something had gone wrong." Later that after
noon, police obtained a warrant for Keane's arrest.
The warrant included one charge of misdemeanor
sexual battery and three charges of misdemeanor
simple battery.
"I'm just sick about it," Keane said this
weekend. "1 haven't been able to sleep. I'm just
very sorry about the entire thing."
Keane said he does not remember anything he
did Thursday night. "I can't say anything for
myself. I was stupid enough to get so drunk that I
don't remember even being at the party," he said.
"I realize it was irresponsible of me. I've learned a
big lesson."
Alleged victims and witnesses have given differ
ent accounts of the incidents Thursday night.
Freshmen Charlotte Lowson and Cathy Zerboni
— two of the students who have filed charges —
told The Daily last week that Lowson was attacked
at a Beta Theta Pi party by a large, blond man at
approximately 11:15 Thursday night while 10 to 20
people watched, and even laughed, but refused to
come to Lowson's aid. Lowson said the assailant
tried to "rip off [her] clothes in front of a large
group of people."
Zerboni said she was attacked by the same male
minutes later at the party.
Two other freshmen — Jill Higgins and Mike
Hein — corroborated Lowson and Zerboni's ac
counts.
"Everyone was circling around watching," Hig
gins said.
"Nobody was doing anything, and it was obvious
that she was in trouble,"' Hein said.
The four freshmen said they struggled to free
Lowson from the assailant while his friends cheered
him on.
"It's like being played with in the middle of an
audience, 10 people laughing," Zerboni said.
Campus police did not release the names of the
other two women who filed charges against Keane.
Several people said they saw Keane at the Beta
House party Thursday night. Keane is neither a
member of the Beta fraternity nor a resident of the
house. A pledge of the currently unhoused Zeta Psi
fraternity, Keane lives at Robinson House in Ster
ling Quad and is a reserve tight end on Stanford's
football team.
Beta members said they were shocked over the
incidents. "Only two Betas knew until this morning
what was going on," said junior Patrick McCrystle
Friday night.
McCrystle said he and junior Roberto Zamora
were the only Beta members who witnessed the in
cident. He said he saw Keane grab Lowson at the
foot of the stairs on the main floor of the Beta
House. "He was right at my feet," McCrystle said.
"It was hard to make out what happened at first.
My first thought was that he slipped or passed out."
McCrystle said he realized after seeing Lowson
struggle that "she did not want to be where she
was." He said he then grabbed Keane and told him
to "let go."
"Myself and another guy were the only ones who
realized what was going on," McCrystle said. "And
when we realized the two of us could not take care
of it, I yelled to (senior) Terry Jackson, 'Come over
and stop this guy.' "
McCrystle said Jackson, who is the starting
noseguard on Stanford's football team, released
Lowson from Keane's grip.
Jackson could not be reached for
comment this weekend.
Asked about the allegation that
people were standing around cheer
ing, McCrystle said he "can com
pletely discredit it."
Zamora corroborated McCrystle's
account of the struggle, but said when
asked about the reported cheering, "1
wasn't noticing what was going on
around me."
"After a while we started trying to
throw his hands off [Lowson]."
Zamora said. "Terry helped take his
hands off."
McCrystle also said he did his
"level best" to see that Keane left the
party. He said that he later saw
Keane outside the Beta House, grab
bing a woman again. "His friends
were trying to stop him as best as they
could," McCrystle said. "Some of his
friends helped get him away."
Beta House Resident Assistant
Mike Melendez, a second-year law
student here, said Friday night. "The

house understands the gravity of the
incident."
The Beta House residents decided
hy a unanimous vote at a house
meeting earlier Friday night to cancel
this week's Thursday party and to
meet after Thanksgiving to discuss
the future of their weekly bar nights.
A key issue appears to be whether
there were onlookers who did not
help Lowson but instead laughed and
cheered.
McCrystle said he saw no observers
egging Keane on. Lowson and Zer
boni said again yesterday that a group
of people were watching and laughing
and not offering any help.
Lowson and Zerboni said yester
day that they — and also Higgins and
Hein — "are all really sure about"
their accounts of Keane's friends
cheering him on.
Zerboni said Keane's friends hurt
him by not stopping him. "If his
friends had stepped in, he wouldn't
be in the position he's in now, with
four girls filing charges against him."
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Her
rington said Friday afternoon that
police had not yet interviewed the
witnesses in depth, but that the

"onlooker" accusation appeared
credible.
"I would say at this point, my im
pression was that there were others
that saw this and didn't do anything,
but I can't verify that yet," Her
rington said Friday.
Keane was asked whether any of
his friends were at the Beta House on
Thursday night and were willing to
give their accounts of the incidents.
"1 have many friends who want to
speak on my behalf, but I'd rather
they didn't, because I'm afraid they'd
make light of the situation," Keane
said. "I take it very seriously."
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said that based on Lowson's
account of the Thursday night party
"three things went wrong." He listed
the three possible violations of Uni
versity code as one individual
sexually assaulting another, individ
uals watching an attack without help
ing in any way, and a host organiza
tion failing to ensure that "things like
this don't happen."
Lyons said the University would
proceed with its own investigation,
autonomous from that of the police.
He raised the question of whether the

two separate investigations constitute
"double jeopardy" for Keane, and
answered himself with a strong "no."
Lyons said the University will eval
uate the actions in accordance with a
different "standard" from that of the
law. "The University's judicial appa-

ratus reflects values which do not
simply reflect the values of the larger
society," he said.
He said that students, without act
ing illegally, may have violated the
University's code Thursday night
simply by "sitting back and watch

ing."
"This raises the question of
whether watching a student being as
saulted and failing to intervene is a
violation of the (University's) funda
mental standard," Lyons said.
The fundamental standard is the
University's formal code of accep
table behavior.
Lyons called Keane's alleged ac
tions "unacceptable."
"It's not behavior that can be
tolerated," he said.
Keane offered his perceptions of
the incidents in an interview yester
day.
"I want to stress that 1 take it
seriously. 1 want to face up to it. But 1
think it's been sensationalized quite a
bit. . . . It's been blown out of propor
tion.
"I don't want people thinking I
sexually assault girls. I'm not that
kind of person. My girlfriend and my
friends know what type of person I
am," he said, noting the support they
have given him over the past three
days.
Lowson and Zerboni said yester
day that they, too, have received
much support from friends.

"Girls have come up to me and
said, 'This has happened to me
before. I'm glad you went to the
police.' They've been very suppor
tive," Lowson said.
A housemate gave the roommates
a bouquet of flowers after the inci
dent.
But the two women said they had
also received two prank calls Friday
night and now make sure their door is
locked each night before they go to
sleep. "Wc unplugged the phone
Friday night and last night, Zerboni
said.
Lowson and Zerboni said they are
not concerned with seeing Keane
punished severely but rather with
raising awareness on campus.
"That's what I hoped to do by
reporting the whole thing, Lowson
said. "1 want people to believe that
this can happen.
"I just want a positive outcome,'
she continued. "We're not vindictive,
we're not anti-fraternity. I don't want
to just hurt this guy and nothing to
have changed. I'm not downplaying
the event [by saying] 1 don't want to

desire just to be vindictive."
