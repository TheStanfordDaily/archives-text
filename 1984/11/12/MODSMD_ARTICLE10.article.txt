MiG shipment doubted
WASHINGTON — An intelligence analyst said Friday
that U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded, based on a
systematic review of aerial spy photographs, that the So
viet freighter Bakuriani probably did not carry advanced
warplanes to Nicaragua.
"The odds have gone way down that it was MlGsthe
analyst said.
Nevertheless, U.S. officials, both in Washington and
with President Reagan in Santa Barbara, said the Sandi
nista regime in Nicaragua is engaged in a massive military
buildup.
A senior administration official in Santa Barbara said
the Soviets apparently are supplying heavy weaponry to
Nicaragua to give the Sandinista regime a lethal bargain
ing chip for upcoming peace negotiations with its Central
American neighbors.
As the furor over the freighter's cargo continued with
Nicaragua charging that the United States is about to
launch an invasion, the four nations of the Contadora
group announced that they had prepared a revised draft of
their Central American peace proposal. The contents of
the new document were not revealed.
The U.S. government was treating the MiG question as
an issue between Washington and Moscow rather than as
a dispute between the United States and Nicaragua. State
Department spokesman John Hughes confirmed that the
Soviet Union has assured the United States through
diplomatic channels that it has not shipped MiGs to
Nicaragua.
In Moscow on Firday, the official Tass news agency
accused the U.S. of laying the groundwork for an invasion
of Nicaragua by falsely creating the the MiG controversy.

CIA calls for punishment
SANTA BARBARA, Calif. — With minimum fanfare,
President Reagan on Saturday signaled his approval of a
C IA inspector general's report recommending discipline
for those involved in preparation of a psychological
warfare manual advising U.S.-backed rebels how to
"neutralize" Nicaraguan officials.
It appeared that the punishments would stop short of
firings. The report pinned sole blame for the manual on
"lower-level" CIA employees who had been guilty of
"poor judgment and lapses in oversight."
Horseback riding at his ranch, Reagan avoided saying
anything publicly about the report. Instead, a three
paragraph statement was issued in the name of his prin
cipal spokesman, Larry Speakes.
Speakes was not available to answer questions, either,
and his deputy, Peter Roussel, said simply that "the presi
dent has received, approved and concurred" in the
report's findings.
Roussel said Reagan's last word on the matter probably
was his post-election press conference statement in Los
Angeles on Wednesday that the controversy amounted to
"much ado about nothing."
Veterans statue unveiled
WASHINGTON — A bronze statue of three American
Gls who served in Vietnam was unveiled Friday at the site
of the Vietnam Memorial, completing the final chapter of
the emotional controversy over how the nation should
honor its Vietnam veterans.
The figures, which appear to be gazing at the polished

black granite walls upon which are engraved the names of
the 58,022 Americans who died in the Vietnam War,
evoked tears and memories from several thousand veter
ans and relatives who gathered on the mall.
As the veterans and family members looked on, a large
red, white and blue drape was removed from the statue to
show the 7-foot-tall figures, sculpted in Vietnam-era bat
tle dress and depicting a white, a black and a Latino.
"It's been a long time coming," said Paul Penkala, 37,
of Chicago, who was an infantryman in Vietnam in 1967.
The ceremony marked the close of a battle over the
memorial's design, a fight that ended with the compro
mise addition of the statue.

Yesterday, as he commemorated the Vietnam
Memorial, President Reagan thanked the veterans for
their "courage" and "patience," and said the memorial
marks the beginning of a healing process that he hopes
will be completed by the time his tenure as commander
in-chief of the armed forces expires.
Rebel raid in El Salvador
SUCHITOTO, EI Salvador — Leftist guerrillas at
tacked this city 30 miles northeast of San Salvador Friday
and battled in the streets for more than 10 hours with
counterattacking government troops before withdrawing
into the countryside, which they have long controlled.
The battle between approximately three battalions of
leftist rebels and government forces was the largest since
June, when the guerrillas attacked the Cerron Grande
hydroelectric dam east of here, killing more than 100 gov
ernment troops.
Despite claims broadcast throughout the day by the
rebel's Radio Farabundo Marti that the city had been
overrun and the government's counterattacking airborne
troops soundly defeated, the guerrillas never succeeded in
taking the city center and the police barracks that domi
nate it.
Even so, there was evidence that at least two govern
ment helicopters had been hit and damaged by the guer
rilla fire when they ferried in the elite 800-man Airborne
Battalion from the capital's Ilopango air base early Friday
morning.

Veterans statue unveiled
WASHINGTON — A bronze statue of three American
Gls who served in Vietnam was unveiled Friday at the site
of the Vietnam Memorial, completing the final chapter of
the emotional controversy over how the nation should
honor its Vietnam veterans.
The figures, which appear to be gazing at the polished

black granite walls upon which are engraved the names of
the 58,022 Americans who died in the Vietnam War,
evoked tears and memories from several thousand veter
ans and relatives who gathered on the mall.
As the veterans and family members looked on, a large
red, white and blue drape was removed from the statue to
show the 7-foot-tall figures, sculpted in Vietnam-era bat
tle dress and depicting a white, a black and a Latino.
"It's been a long time coming," said Paul Penkala, 37,
of Chicago, who was an infantryman in Vietnam in 1967.
The ceremony marked the close of a battle over the
memorial's design, a fight that ended with the compro
mise addition of the statue.

Yesterday, as he commemorated the Vietnam
Memorial, President Reagan thanked the veterans for
their "courage" and "patience," and said the memorial
marks the beginning of a healing process that he hopes
will be completed by the time his tenure as commander
in-chief of the armed forces expires.
Rebel raid in El Salvador
SUCHITOTO, EI Salvador — Leftist guerrillas at
tacked this city 30 miles northeast of San Salvador Friday
and battled in the streets for more than 10 hours with
counterattacking government troops before withdrawing
into the countryside, which they have long controlled.
The battle between approximately three battalions of
leftist rebels and government forces was the largest since
June, when the guerrillas attacked the Cerron Grande
hydroelectric dam east of here, killing more than 100 gov
ernment troops.
Despite claims broadcast throughout the day by the
rebel's Radio Farabundo Marti that the city had been
overrun and the government's counterattacking airborne
troops soundly defeated, the guerrillas never succeeded in
taking the city center and the police barracks that domi
nate it.
Even so, there was evidence that at least two govern
ment helicopters had been hit and damaged by the guer
rilla fire when they ferried in the elite 800-man Airborne
Battalion from the capital's Ilopango air base early Friday
morning.

MiG shipment doubted
WASHINGTON — An intelligence analyst said Friday
that U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded, based on a
systematic review of aerial spy photographs, that the So
viet freighter Bakuriani probably did not carry advanced
warplanes to Nicaragua.
"The odds have gone way down that it was MlGsthe
analyst said.
Nevertheless, U.S. officials, both in Washington and
with President Reagan in Santa Barbara, said the Sandi
nista regime in Nicaragua is engaged in a massive military
buildup.
A senior administration official in Santa Barbara said
the Soviets apparently are supplying heavy weaponry to
Nicaragua to give the Sandinista regime a lethal bargain
ing chip for upcoming peace negotiations with its Central
American neighbors.
As the furor over the freighter's cargo continued with
Nicaragua charging that the United States is about to
launch an invasion, the four nations of the Contadora
group announced that they had prepared a revised draft of
their Central American peace proposal. The contents of
the new document were not revealed.
The U.S. government was treating the MiG question as
an issue between Washington and Moscow rather than as
a dispute between the United States and Nicaragua. State
Department spokesman John Hughes confirmed that the
Soviet Union has assured the United States through
diplomatic channels that it has not shipped MiGs to
Nicaragua.
In Moscow on Firday, the official Tass news agency
accused the U.S. of laying the groundwork for an invasion
of Nicaragua by falsely creating the the MiG controversy.

CIA calls for punishment
SANTA BARBARA, Calif. — With minimum fanfare,
President Reagan on Saturday signaled his approval of a
C IA inspector general's report recommending discipline
for those involved in preparation of a psychological
warfare manual advising U.S.-backed rebels how to
"neutralize" Nicaraguan officials.
It appeared that the punishments would stop short of
firings. The report pinned sole blame for the manual on
"lower-level" CIA employees who had been guilty of
"poor judgment and lapses in oversight."
Horseback riding at his ranch, Reagan avoided saying
anything publicly about the report. Instead, a three
paragraph statement was issued in the name of his prin
cipal spokesman, Larry Speakes.
Speakes was not available to answer questions, either,
and his deputy, Peter Roussel, said simply that "the presi
dent has received, approved and concurred" in the
report's findings.
Roussel said Reagan's last word on the matter probably
was his post-election press conference statement in Los
Angeles on Wednesday that the controversy amounted to
"much ado about nothing."
