So the Soviet freighter didn't contain MiGs
after all. Well, that won't stop the Reagan admin
istration from attempting to channel last week's
frenzy of speculation and concern into support
for escalated intervention in Nicaragua. The es
calation has already begun.
Overflights by U.S. SR-71 reconnaissance
planes violate international law and have
produced sonic booms which terrorize the popu
lation and galvanize support for the Sandinista
regime. And administration officials were quoted
over the weekend as saying they would take ad
vantage of the atmosphere created by the press
reports of last week to push for more aid to the
contras fighting the Sandinista junta.
The Soviets haven't exactly been models of
restraint either. The ship-that-didn't-contain-
MiGs was loaded with such humanitarian cargo
as attack helicopters and surface-to-air missiles.
And the arrival of warplanes is only a matter of
time. The Soviets haven't directed the construc
tion of four MiG-compatible runways in
Nicaragua only to use them for peace rallies. And
75 Nicaraguans haven't received Bulgarian train
ing as MiG pilots in order to pick coffee.
Apologists of the Nicaraguan regime excuse this

buildup as a reaction to U.S. belligerence. But
huge Soviet arms shipments to the Sandinistas
were well under way in 1980, when the United
States was providing generous loans to the new
government.
Ihe militarization of Central America by the
superpowers must stop. While posturing as cham
pions of liberation, the United States and the So
viet Union are pouring hundreds of millions of
dollars into armaments which are slaughtering
the region's people and laying waste to its eco
nomy.
Just as frightening, the current escalation could
easily spark a major superpower confrontation.
Has the administration contemplated how the
Soviets would react if a U.S. air strike against
Nicaraguan MiGs killed Soviet support person
nel? Have the Soviets considered the effect on
U.S. public opinion if a U.S. reconaissance plane
is shot down by Nicaraguans using Soviet
supplied missiles? In both cases, the answer may
be yes. But catastrophic contingencies, like the
lives of the Central American people, don't seem
to loom large in the strategic calculus of the su
perpowers.
