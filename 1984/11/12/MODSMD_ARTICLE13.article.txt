## Lottery success shows moral failure 
### 
The success of Proposition 37 — the California
state lottery— is one of many horrors in the recent
election. Though its ultimate effects may be less
concrete or devastating than many of the other off
spring of this election, it calls for our notice in that
it is one instance of the general failure of moral im
agination in recent American public and private

life. Though it will likely be a severely regressive
form of taxation and a Trojan Horse for education,
the proposition has flaws of a deeper, may I say
even spiritual, nature.
First of all, lotteries derail the quality of public
conversation. Last winter in Illinois, all people
could talk about, 1 am told, was the lottery as it ap
proached the $40 million point. The California
state lottery, administered by state organs, will
become a basis of common conversation and hence
a unifying theme of public life. Like the weather,
lotteries offer something to talk about: Both are
unpredictable (hence constant source of novelty)
and, presumably, widely participated in. Unlike the
weather, however, lotteries do not cluster around
natural conditions or life-rhythms, but around an
invisible but omnipresent state apparatus driven by
the sentiment of greed.
One measure of a civilization is the preoccupa
tions it displays in its everyday talk, fantasies and
dreams. Are we willing to admit that the fondest
imagination of our hearts is unbounded wealth?
The dream of wealth out of mid-air, disconnected
from labor or invention, is one of the enduring fan
tasies of human history; as fairy tales and various
canons of mythology attest, abruptly won riches
can canker all they touch, disrupting routines and
mundane sources of satisfaction. What is the des
tiny of a winner of several million dollars? The lot
tery may help produce a society hungry for things
that vanish, without dreams that are possible, nor
healthy objects for which to dream.
Second, and more alarming than the possible ef

fects, is the structure of the apparatus. Its manifest
purpose is to raise funds for public education. Why
is there a shortcoming? Largely because of
Proposition 13, which in 1978 passed because of
the voters' disdain for taxes. Now, instead of taxes,
comes a comparatively cumbersome and inefficient
mechanism that will yield about 34 cents for public
education on each lottery dollar. The circuitousness
of the structure can be seen as a failure to educate
desires: It admits that greed, more or less universal
throughout the species, is a more steady and
reliable means of paying for education than other
more parsimonious methods. By taking, in effect,

tions and practices that

the status quo of our
desires.

one of the basest of human emotions as a given,
rather than seeking more enlightened means for
raising funds (for a cause that should, in principle,
be able to evoke the more noble sides of the elec
torate) the proposition has created an awkward and
wasteful structure.
Our society faces the proliferation of institutions
and practices that result from reverence for the
status quo of our desires. We constantly anesthetize
the disease rather than undergo the radical treat
ment we need, because that treatment would require
an abandonment of habit and a change of taste.
Thus disease and cure, both equally bad. both de

pendent on the other, grow unchecked. And the
cure is really nothing but the disease in another
guise, a guise supplied by unwillingness to change,
as individuals and as a nation.
Hence the trouble with the measure is not so
much the measure itself as the more general pat
tern of the failure of spirit and sense it points to
throughout our society. Rather than re-educate
tastes, we spend $60 billion a year on red meat, as
well as $60 billion (directly and indirectly) on heart
disease: Thus, business as usual continues on both
sides. Rather than disarm. President Reagan said in
the second debate that he has a dream of building
defenses to make nuclear war impossible: Thus, we
both build missiles and build defenses against them.
We apparently solve the problem without changing
anything about the way we think about war or the
way our economy works.
Each of these examples — the lottery, the love of
meat, the buildup of arms — has two faces: One is
the set of problems that results from their underly
ing impulses (e.g. greed, machismo, security), and
the other is the set of solutions to these problems.
In each case, the underlying impulse, whether
based in individual desire or macrocosmic ex
igencies, is taken as a given for which to create so
lutions, rather than something to be revised,
purified or dissolved.
I take this general pattern to be characteristic of
political life in the age of Reaganism: a failure to
explore painful solutions that might rearrange what
we think or hope for. The chief principle of
Reaganism seems to be the sanctity of extant
desires. Though it cannot help but seep into other
parts of our lives as well, and often seems to result
in unmanageably vast problems like the arms race,
this principle can be resisted in the most concrete
way possible, a way that we personally have control
over: the willingness to submit ourselves to painful
reforms for the sake of simplicity and sense, in the
little dramas through which we daily pass.
