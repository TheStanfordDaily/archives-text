Big Game relay
I was very disappointed to read
The Daily's article billing the two
student-run Big Game relays as a
"conflict" between two organizations
(The Daily, Nov. 8). As one of the
organizers of the Donner Weenie
Run, 1 feel we were misquoted and
misrepresented by the article, and
that publicity such as this can only
hurt the cause represented by both
groups. We feel it was a oor gesture
on the papers part to tal wo such
charitable events and try pit them
against each other and maKe a scan
dal out of the matter.
As for the article, several off-the
record and out-of-context comments
were printed, and the focus of the
article was on the "conflict" rather
than on the events themselves. Sigma
Phi Epsilon and Donner had a
working agreement to cooperate and
try to promote our respective events
as hard as possible to help the cause.
In addition, Donner did not accuse
Sig Ep of "raising money for a keg"
6r "doing it for the publicity" as The
Daily reported. The events were
planned independently of each other
and neither group knew of the
other's intent until it was too late to
change plans. I think it is important
to remember that both events are
taking place for charity not simply as
publicity stunts or to get our name in
the paper. In addition, we hope that
perhaps such a run will become an
annual Big Game tradition. We are
working together with the Sig Eps,
and we will not be stepping on each
other's toes by sharing common
ground for pledge-collecting
purposes.
As for the symbolism represented
by the respective batons, the
"weenie" merely represents the
long-standing rivalry between the
two schools. It is not intended to be
inciteful or profane and should not
be interpreted as such. In addition,
we at Donner do not feel that the

name "Weenie Run" will hurt our
cause; if anything, it may help grab
the attention of the Stanford student
population.
I realize that perhaps the article
would not have been newsworthy
without some kind of controversy,
but sensationalized articles can only
hurt the cause, no matter how im
portant or deserving the cause may
be. The simple fact is that such a
controversy does not exist. In other
words, no press is better than bad
press in such an event. 1 hope that
The Daily will see fit to print this
letter immediately to allow the
reader to decide what the real story
is.

Relay clarification
I want to clarify some of the points
expressed in the article "Student
relays overlap routes" (The Daily,
Nov. 8). First of all, I must say that
the article contained a mistake and
material which was supposed to be
off the record. The quote about a
Donner resident's assuming that I
was asking for money for a keg was a
gross misunderstanding. What I was
referring to was that the loss of the
agreement with Donner about which
dorms the two groups would contact
wouldn't seriously hurt the Sigma
Phi Epsilons, I said that we had
planned to raise most of our money
from the business community be
cause it is difficult for a fraternity to
get money from dorms. I stated that
if you show up at a house meeting
and say, "Hi, I'm from a fraternity,
and I'd like some of your money,"
then the residents may assum that we
just want money for a keg and be
reluctant to donate. The comment
had nothing to do with Donner
House. I must say that many dorms
did give generously, and the Sig Eps
are very grateful.
Several other quotes were in
tended to be off the record. After my
interview with the Daily reporter, I
gave him a lift to and from Donner

House. I assumed that the interview
was over. On the way back to The
Daily, I felt frustrated with Donner's
canceling our deal, and I expressed
some personal views about the ex
tent of Donner's organization. These
statements were never meant to be
printed. I also made a joke about
saying "weiner" on TV, but it ended
up sounding serious.
Let me emphasize that both
groups are working for the same very
worthy charity. We don't feel that
Donner and the Sig Eps are trying to
compete. We are working together
for a common goal. I'd like to en
courage the Stanford community to
make a donation to either the Don
ner or Sig Ep relays.

The flow of reality
To my young friends who are
saddened by the election results:
1 was as idealistic as you as a stu
dent. In World War II terrible
realities made me, like Camus,
"modest" in my aims. I gave up my
inner world to some extent and allied
myself significantly and durably with
even very simple guys to keep our
Western ship afloat.
The folks "out there" who voted
for President Reagan represent, on
the whole, a similar need to survive
at a less-than-lovely level. They
aren't just Darwinian forces pushing
against all challengers, scrambling
for jobs and a place in the sun at the
expense of others. They are that,
realistically, combined with —
balanced with — impulses of
decency, fairness and the like. Their
dosage is closer to the river of life as
it usually and viably is than our
campus views.
That flow of reality, under the
amiable exterior, is what politics is
about.
It is a plain fact that men still
prefer to vote for men, normally, for
quite clear anthropological and

psychological reasons, and white for
whites, etc. My tastes— which are
apt to be like yours (I am, in some
ways, a still-adolescing idealistic
"outsider") — are only half the
point. You and I are not too young
to see the other half, that is if we
want to understand how it all hap
pened. And will happen again. But
the ship goes on and so will our
music.

Warp speed ahead
Last week, an impressive group of
scientists, including Carl Sagan and
Wolfgang Panofsky, gathered at
Stanford to speak of the imprac
ticality of a "Star Wars" defense.
One is led to assume that we should
not question their wisdom on this
subject, and should have gone out
and voted for Walter Mondale, who
would not fund research for such a
ridiculous proposal.
Sagan states that the system
"simply cannot work." Maybe with
the facts we have today, the system is
indeed an unrealistic, expensive
proposition. But how can he say that
after five years of research, the situa
tion will not change as new facts are
discovered? Five years from now,
Star Wars defense may become a
very real possibility.
I don't think that we can ever
discount this possibility, especially
since the Soviets, judging from past
history, will not stop their research
on the system just because we do.
Should we stop research on the Star
Wars defense, trusting these scien
tists, and assume that the Soviets will
never come up with a feasible plan? I
agree with President Reagan on this
issue, that this is a risk we can't
afford to take. Our research on Star
Wars must continue if only because
there is always the possibility, no
matter how remote now, of a Soviet
breakthrough in this area in the
future.
