## Festering Stanford 
### 
Construction work has appeared
on the face of our fair campus this fall
like a particularly malignant skin can
cer. Festering heaps of mud and as
phalt blotch the Stanford landscape,
surrounded by sickly orange con
struction markers and snarls of yellow
warning tape. Actually, the symptoms
began to show even last year: A sore
spot by the post office swelled up into
Braun Music Center, while the fever
of renovation spread from Hoover
Tower to the Ouad. It is only now,
however, that the student population
is feeling the harsh effects of
"construction sickness."
To begin with, traversing the
campus has become a deadly prob
lem. In a fit of seemingly poor plan
ning, the University administration
has started construction simultane
ously at all the points where student
travel is heaviest. Masses of traffic
form daily by the clock tower, as
bikers must wait to cross the few nar
row strips of pavement not swallowed
up in some project. Students trying to
get into White Plaza are forced at
times to detour behind the bookstore
or through Old Union. And forget
the Quad — there's more room to
move in front of the stage at a Bruce
Springsteen concert than in its roped
off walkways. Construction has made
University paths a mess. What a dis
grace to the memory of our founder;
Leland Stanford knew where and
where not to lay his railroad tracks.
Just as a cold can lead to
pneumonia, these traffic problems
have caused a dramatic increase in
the number of bicycle accidents. I've
seen too many riders, confronted with
an unexpected construction barrier or
pile of gravel, swerve suddenly onto
grass patches or into trees. Often
these desperate last-second detours
have ended in nasty collisions, splat
tering pieces of bikes and bikers all
over. My friends and I are starting to
look like casualties back from war;
we've used up a truckload of
bandages and antiseptic. My bike
isn't in such great shape, either.

When I don't pop an air tube grinding
over piles of rock, I jitter all the nuts
and bolts loose crashing through the
network of pits and ditches the con
struction workers have left behind. If
we don't counter the illness soon,
there won't be any bikers left to
worry about it.
Now, I refuse to conclude that our
difficulties are due to incompetence
or shortsightedness on the part of the
University administration. There
must be a rationale for their policy.
Perhaps they are trying to perpetuate
the economic recovery, contractina
enough construction work at one time
to stimulate the industry single
handedly. No wonder these projects
seem to go on forever! The delay in
completing the Quad renovation
must be intended to rectify last year's
mistakes, like finishing Terman Engi
neering Center on schedule. The ad
ministration must have a long-term
benefit in mind — maybe a monu
ment to those who have suffered in
convenience and injury so that
Stanford might have red bricks in the
Quad and LOTS terminals in Tresid
der Union?
My main worry is that the construc
tion sickness will spread until it is out
of control, an epidemic. I hear the
machines rumbling outside during my
classes and I wonder: What will hap
pen next? Will we see bulldozers raze
Wilbur field, or a wrecking ball crush
in the walls of the Band Shak or even
mounds of dirt dug up across the
Oval? Will they demolish the Old
Chemistry Building to put up the
Reagan library? In the end, the ad
ministration's enthusiasm for new
construction may drive them to
rebuild the whole school.
We can't let the cancer grow any
further; the construction sickness
must be cured. If we let them pave
our paradise, we'll all get sick living in
the parking lot.
