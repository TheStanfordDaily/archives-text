## SUSA: airing out issues Stanford Undergraduate Students' Organization 
### R. TAEZA PIERCE Staff writer 
An ASSU senator has set into motion an independent
student organization designed to evaluate issues of
campus concern and submit recommendations to the Uni
versity.
According to Senator Mark Soble, founder and presi
dent of the Stanford Undergraduate Students' Associa
tion (SUSA), the group was created "to provide a forum
for students to let [the University] know how they feel."
SUSA currently consists of Soble and 25 elected house
representatives.
Formed this spring, the group is planning three discus
sion sessions for the year, Soble said. He said he plans to
invite several speakers and to supplement the speeches
with a packet including diverse opinions on the issues to
be covered at the forums.
The fall forum, scheduled for later this month, will ad
dress the issue of fraternity and sorority housing, Soble
said. The winter session will focus on "theme houses and
their role within the University." A spring forum is
tentatively scheduled to discuss food service.
Having submitted a funding proposal to the ASSU Pro
gram Board and filed a constitution with Student Organi
zational Services, SUSA is currently planning its first
forum. Soble said the group has invited Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons to speak at the fall fraternal-housing
forum.
Soble said he sent flyers to all the residences on campus,
both in the spring and this fall, asking each house to elect
a representative to the committee. He said he did not
succeed in his goal "to avoid needing ASSU funding." He
had asked houses to give $5 to $10 to cover publicity
costs.
But Soble said the group's only relationship to the
ASSU "is that we'd be asking them for money."
"The end result," Soble said, "is to allow students to
submit input to the University ... to let [the University]
know what they're concerned about."
ASSU Senator Jay Alter said SUSA "is a good idea, but
I'm not sure it's necessary." According to Alter, "there
are not a lot of responsibilities that he (Soble) could take
over from the ASSU."
Council of Presidents member Alice Wells said she had
no knowledge of SUSA's existence. Wells said she would
have no objection to the organization if it served as a sup

plement to the ASSU. She said, however, that it it plans
to settle issues itself, it won't be successful.
Alter said he foresees no conflict between the ASSU
and SUSA, explaining, "1 don't think people are going to
take his organization seriously."
The ASSU has "a lot of legitimacy which it (SUSA)
might lack," Alter said. He noted that ASSU officers are
all elected, and that the organization has existed for a
while."

SUSA "is not going to have that in the beginning," Al
ter said.
Soble said he does not view SUSA as a rival of the
ASSU. "There is an opportunity to accomplish things
within this framework that aren't accomplished within the
ASSU," he said.
Because the ASSU has a larger agenda than will SUSA,
Soble's group will be better able to go into depth on a few
issues, he said.
Soble said that "if there's one forum that several
hundred people attend," he would feel SUSA was a suc
cess.
