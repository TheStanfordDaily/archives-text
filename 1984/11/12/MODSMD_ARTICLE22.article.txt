## STEP enrollment increases 40 percent 
### JENNIFER JENKINS 
The respect accorded to the teach
ing profession seems to be on the rise,
as is the enrollment in Stanford's
Teacher Education Program (STEP).
Sixty-five students are currently in
volved in the program, a 40-percent
increase over last year.
STEP is open to graduates and
begins one week after Stanford's
commencement in June. Jim Mar
shall, director of the program since
June, said that STEP has unique
features that make it better than
other programs.
One unique feature of the STEP
program is that it allows a student to
obtain a master's degree as well as a
California teaching credential upon
completion. Most programs offer
only the teaching credential, which
enables students to teach in Califor
nia public schools. Placement for
STEP students upon culmination of
the program is good, especially for
math and science teachers, according
to Marshall.

Students also have the advantage
of having a Stanford supervisor from
the School of Education who has
teaching experience in their particu
lar area of interest. "There is more
care here than in most programs,"
said Marshall. "Stanford is interna
tionally recognized as one of the
finest schools of education and the
quality of the faculty is excellent."
One of the major aims of the pro
gram is the attempt to "marry theory
and practice," Marshall said. The
program is very intense, with both
classes in educational theory and spe
cific interests, and first-hand experi
ence in the classroom.
Students work with faculty over the
summer coordinating the federally
funded Upward Bound program.
"This program focuses on giving dis
advantaged kids the opportunity to
go to college, who might not get there
on their own," Marshall said.
STEP students assist the faculty
and eventually take full responsibility
for the group. Students also take the

ory courses in the psychology and
philosophy of education.
In September the real teaching job
takes over. Students have the option
of completely taking over a class, as
with a student internship, or teaching
with a qualified instructor present.
The student internship offers one
fifth of a regular teacher's salary, and
usually 70 percent of the students
take this option. According to Mar
shall, it involves a lot more responsi
bility with curriculum planning and
class management.
STEP students teach in 17 schools
in the Bay Area. They teach classes in
the morning and devote their after
noons to classes here at Stanford.
These include classes in educational
theory and methods, as well as classes
in the student's area of interest.
"The program will really prove
whether you were meant to be a
teacher or not," said STEP student
Sonia Ibarra, a Spanish teacher at
Wilbur Middle School and Gunn
High School. "It really gives you the

experience.
"STEP makes you an effective
teacher from the beginning," said
Stacie Newman, an English teacher at
Wilbur Middle School. "The combi-

nation of theory and curriculum
classes is important."
"Theory always comes into play
whether you realize it or not," said
Monica Garin, a social studies and
math teacher at Aragon High School
in San Mateo.

Teachers' salaries have been low,
and "in America, professions that are
not well-paid are held in low es
teem," said Marshall. "Because
teachers spend time with children, the
impression is that they are not doing
important work or are (not) very in
telligent.
"There is a margin of hope now.
With the recent interest in education,
people are becoming aware, and
there is a new interest in teaching in
very talented, committed students,"
Marshall said.
Forty percent of students involved
in STEP are graduates of Stanford,
with other schools such as Harvard,
Yale and the Massachussets Institute
of Technology represented as well.
"Our applicant pool is getting
stronger," Marshall said.
"There is an upswing in respect,
and teachers are underpaid," said
Garin. "I'm interested in changing
old trends," said Newman, "but it's
not going to change overnight."

Marshall was full of praise for the
STEP students. "The group is a very
rare one with a commitment to the
field and a desire to work with stu
dents that haven't had the same ad
vantages that they have had."
As for the students themselves,
teaching has always seemed to be a
desire. "I've wanted to teach ever
since first grade," said Ibarra.
"Teaching is the best part of what I
am," Newman said. "Interacting with
the kids is the best; they are so
refreshing."
All three teachers seemed to enjoy
teaching high-school students the
best. "You can help them with their
problems and be their friend," Garin
said. "First and second graders are
difficult because you can't reason
with them."
Students interviewed were also full
of praise for the Stanford program.
"It's a top school for education,"
Ibarra said. "I don't think there's a
better one in the country. There's
nothing that equals it."
