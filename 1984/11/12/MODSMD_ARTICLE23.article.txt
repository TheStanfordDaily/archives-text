## Mistake-prone Cardinal loses to 'Cats 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
TUCSON, Ariz. — With 5:18 left
in the third quarter of Saturday
night's Stanford-Arizona football
game. Cardinal linebacker Tom
Briehl intercepted a pass and
returned it 53 yards for a touchdown.
And with 6:00 to go in the fourth
quarter. Cardinal quarterback Fred
Buckley capped a 16-play, 80-yard
drive with a three-yard touchdown
run.
Other than that, everything went
wrong for Stanford. Absolutely
everything.
Stanford lost the game, 28-14, and
its chance for its first winning season
since 1980. The Cardinal dropped to
4-6 overall and 2-5 in the Pacific 10
Conference with only this Saturday's
Big Game remaining.
But losing to the University of
Arizona, 6-4 overall and 4-2 in the
Pac-10, was good news compared to

what else Stanford lost before a red
clad homecoming crowd of 44,836 at
Arizona Stadium.
Stanford lost its leading tackier,
junior linebacker Dave Wyman, with
a leg injury that team physician Don
Bunce called "career threatening."
Wyman left in the third quarter on
the back of a golf cart with an air
splint on his right leg. Yesterday's op
eration to repair the ligaments in his
dislocated knee lasted upwards of
three hours.
Leading rusher Brad Muster also
left the game, but he exited on his
feet in the fourth quarter with an
injured back. Leading passer John
Paye, although he suited up, never
left the game because he never got
into it. His still-strained middle finger
was taped and he threw 10-yard
passes on the sideline.
And if that wasn't enough. The
Daily learned yesterday that Buckley
played the game hurt, wearing a

"flak" jacket to protect a had hack.
Buckley's injury was kept a secret last
week so Arizona's hard-hitting
defense wouldn't open season on
him.
For Stanford, the game itself was
like the injury list — long and
depressing.
For the second time this season,
Stanford found itself behind 21-0 in
the first half. But unlike the Oregon
State game, when the Cardinal
rebounded for a 28-21 victory, there
was no comeback.
"We got started with unexpected
bad things for us," an unusually unlo
quacious Stanford Coach Jack Elway
said.
All three "unexpected bad things"
involved freshman punter Doug
Robison. And all you can do for
Robison, who was off limits to
reporters after the game, is feel sorry
for him.
Robison ate the ball on his first
three punt attempts, giving the
Wildcats the ball on the Stanford 13,
15 and 32 — and basically giving them
10 easy points.
"On the first one, he tried to make
a (sidestep) move to avoid it (the
rush) and it didn't work," Elway said.
"From then on, he was very, very
conscious and under pressure."
Arizona took over on the Cardinal
13 just 2:20 into the game. Five plays
later, 5-foot-6, 164-pound tailback
David Adams hurdled into the end
zone.
"The other two (punt miscues)
were just over-compensations for
what happened initially," Elway said.
"And obviously they put them in
good field position." "Over
compensations" was Elway's polite
way of saying Robison fumbled two
perfectly good snaps.
"The key thing was the kicking
game," Arizona Coach Larry Smith
said. "We made up our mind before
the game that we were going to go
after him (Robison) and that was one
of the big differences in the game."
Still, Stanford escaped from
Robison's punting debacle only be
hind 10-0. But a 50-yard field goal by
placekicker Max Zendejas and an 82-
yard touchdown drive plus a success
ful two-point conversion gave the
Wildcats a 21-0 halftime lead.
Stanford outscored the Wildcats
14-7 in the second half, but that was
about all it did. Seven of those points
came off Briehl's interception, which
was about as fluky as Paye injuring
two fingers in one season.
Briehl was initially knocked down
on the play but got up and —

surprise — quarterback Alfred
Jenkin's pass was in his arms. "I saw
him go to ground it and he was
looking right at me," Briehl said. "1
don't know why he threw it. It was
about a four-yard pass. It hit me in
the stomach and was almost
impossible to drop." Briehl, who was
the Arizona high school 440-yard
state champion in 1980 and 1981,
wasn't about to be caught.
Briehl's touchdown cut the Wildcat
lead to 21-7 with more than 20
minutes left in the game. Two
minutes later, after a Jenkins quick
kick traveled 10 yards, Stanford had
the ball on Arizona's 36. But on the
Cardinal's first play, Buckley's pass,
intended for Emile Harry, was inter
cepted by safety Lynnden Brown.
Arizona, however, wasn't finished
giving Stanford chances to score, and
Stanford wasn't finished screwing
them up.
Four plays later, Jenkins threw his
fourth interception, this one to Toi
Cook, who returned it to the Arizona
12. Stanford moved two yards in the
wrong direction and had to settle for
a 31-yard Mark Harmon field goal at
tempt, which he missed.
Arizona put things away on its next
drive, an 80-yarder keyed by a 63-
yard bomb from Jenkins to Jay
Dobyns down the right sideline. The
Cardinal responded with an 80-yard
touchdown drive of its own, and Har
mon's point-after made him Stan
ford's all-time career scorer, now one
point ahead of Darrin Nelson.
Losing by two touchdowns was bad
enough for Stanford, but it could
have been worse. That is, if Jenkins
had thrown more accurately to his
receivers, who were wide open all
night.
Stanford's secondary was about as
effective as a screen door on a sub
marine. As one Arizona journalist
began his story, "It has been none if
by land, six if by air against Stanford's
defense this season."
When Jenkins, the Pac- 10's leading
passer, was on target (he was on half
of his 30 passes), he averaged 19.3
yards per completion.
"They're really very strong up
front defensively," Smith said. "We
really wanted to run but couldn't. So
we had to throw the football."
Card notes
Stanford receiver Jeff James was
also injured, spraining his ankle in the
first half and sitting out the second.
James was on crutches yesterday, but
is expected, along with Muster and
Buckley, to be ready for Saturday's
Big Game.

"flak" jacket to protect a had hack.
Buckley's injury was kept a secret last
week so Arizona's hard-hitting
defense wouldn't open season on
him.
For Stanford, the game itself was
like the injury list — long and
depressing.
For the second time this season,
Stanford found itself behind 21-0 in
the first half. But unlike the Oregon
State game, when the Cardinal
rebounded for a 28-21 victory, there
was no comeback.
"We got started with unexpected
bad things for us," an unusually unlo
quacious Stanford Coach Jack Elway
said.
All three "unexpected bad things"
involved freshman punter Doug
Robison. And all you can do for
Robison, who was off limits to
reporters after the game, is feel sorry
for him.
Robison ate the ball on his first
three punt attempts, giving the
Wildcats the ball on the Stanford 13,
15 and 32 — and basically giving them
10 easy points.
"On the first one, he tried to make
a (sidestep) move to avoid it (the
rush) and it didn't work," Elway said.
"From then on, he was very, very
conscious and under pressure."
Arizona took over on the Cardinal
13 just 2:20 into the game. Five plays
later, 5-foot-6, 164-pound tailback
David Adams hurdled into the end
zone.
"The other two (punt miscues)
were just over-compensations for
what happened initially," Elway said.
"And obviously they put them in
good field position." "Over
compensations" was Elway's polite
way of saying Robison fumbled two
perfectly good snaps.
"The key thing was the kicking
game," Arizona Coach Larry Smith
said. "We made up our mind before
the game that we were going to go
after him (Robison) and that was one
of the big differences in the game."
Still, Stanford escaped from
Robison's punting debacle only be
hind 10-0. But a 50-yard field goal by
placekicker Max Zendejas and an 82-
yard touchdown drive plus a success
ful two-point conversion gave the
Wildcats a 21-0 halftime lead.
Stanford outscored the Wildcats
14-7 in the second half, but that was
about all it did. Seven of those points
came off Briehl's interception, which
was about as fluky as Paye injuring
two fingers in one season.
Briehl was initially knocked down
on the play but got up and —

surprise — quarterback Alfred
Jenkin's pass was in his arms. "I saw
him go to ground it and he was
looking right at me," Briehl said. "1
don't know why he threw it. It was
about a four-yard pass. It hit me in
the stomach and was almost
impossible to drop." Briehl, who was
the Arizona high school 440-yard
state champion in 1980 and 1981,
wasn't about to be caught.
Briehl's touchdown cut the Wildcat
lead to 21-7 with more than 20
minutes left in the game. Two
minutes later, after a Jenkins quick
kick traveled 10 yards, Stanford had
the ball on Arizona's 36. But on the
Cardinal's first play, Buckley's pass,
intended for Emile Harry, was inter
cepted by safety Lynnden Brown.
Arizona, however, wasn't finished
giving Stanford chances to score, and
Stanford wasn't finished screwing
them up.
Four plays later, Jenkins threw his
fourth interception, this one to Toi
Cook, who returned it to the Arizona
12. Stanford moved two yards in the
wrong direction and had to settle for
a 31-yard Mark Harmon field goal at
tempt, which he missed.
Arizona put things away on its next
drive, an 80-yarder keyed by a 63-
yard bomb from Jenkins to Jay
Dobyns down the right sideline. The
Cardinal responded with an 80-yard
touchdown drive of its own, and Har
mon's point-after made him Stan
ford's all-time career scorer, now one
point ahead of Darrin Nelson.
Losing by two touchdowns was bad
enough for Stanford, but it could
have been worse. That is, if Jenkins
had thrown more accurately to his
receivers, who were wide open all
night.
Stanford's secondary was about as
effective as a screen door on a sub
marine. As one Arizona journalist
began his story, "It has been none if
by land, six if by air against Stanford's
defense this season."
When Jenkins, the Pac- 10's leading
passer, was on target (he was on half
of his 30 passes), he averaged 19.3
yards per completion.
"They're really very strong up
front defensively," Smith said. "We
really wanted to run but couldn't. So
we had to throw the football."
Card notes
Stanford receiver Jeff James was
also injured, spraining his ankle in the
first half and sitting out the second.
James was on crutches yesterday, but
is expected, along with Muster and
Buckley, to be ready for Saturday's
Big Game.

Stanford punter Doug Robison had more than his share of misfortune
on Saturday as he was tackled for losses on all three of his punting op
portunities.

Both Brad Muster (25) and Jeff James (3) ended up on a long list of
injured Stanford players at the end of Saturday's game.
TUCSON, Ariz. — With 5:18 left
in the third quarter of Saturday
night's Stanford-Arizona football
game. Cardinal linebacker Tom
Briehl intercepted a pass and
returned it 53 yards for a touchdown.
And with 6:00 to go in the fourth
quarter. Cardinal quarterback Fred
Buckley capped a 16-play, 80-yard
drive with a three-yard touchdown
run.
Other than that, everything went
wrong for Stanford. Absolutely
everything.
Stanford lost the game, 28-14, and
its chance for its first winning season
since 1980. The Cardinal dropped to
4-6 overall and 2-5 in the Pacific 10
Conference with only this Saturday's
Big Game remaining.
But losing to the University of
Arizona, 6-4 overall and 4-2 in the
Pac-10, was good news compared to

what else Stanford lost before a red
clad homecoming crowd of 44,836 at
Arizona Stadium.
Stanford lost its leading tackier,
junior linebacker Dave Wyman, with
a leg injury that team physician Don
Bunce called "career threatening."
Wyman left in the third quarter on
the back of a golf cart with an air
splint on his right leg. Yesterday's op
eration to repair the ligaments in his
dislocated knee lasted upwards of
three hours.
Leading rusher Brad Muster also
left the game, but he exited on his
feet in the fourth quarter with an
injured back. Leading passer John
Paye, although he suited up, never
left the game because he never got
into it. His still-strained middle finger
was taped and he threw 10-yard
passes on the sideline.
And if that wasn't enough. The
