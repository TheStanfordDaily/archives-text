# Wyman has surgery
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
TUCSON, Ariz. â€” The first in
dication that linebacker Dave
Wyman had more than the wind
knocked out of him in last Satur
day's game here came when a
Stanford trainer motioned across
the field for the Stanford team
doctors.
About 10 minutes later, the
44,836 on hand got a second clue
that Wyman was in trouble. The 6-
foot-3, 231-pound junior was
lifted onto the back of a golf cart
and taken off the field.
And for those who were still in
the dark about the severity of
Wyman's injury, his 6-6 brother,
Mike, let everyone know. Mike
Wyman, who knelt at his brother's
side while the doctors were at
tending him. walked back across
the field to the Stanford sideline.
Halfway across, Wyman took off
his helmet. And slammed it into
the turf.
Yes, Wyman's injury was of the
serious nature. And yes, team
physician Don Bunce did not lie
when he called the injury poten
tially "career threatening."
Wyman, Stanford's leading
tackier with 128, dislocated his
right knee and Bunce and Dr.
Fred Behling operated on it for
three hours yesterday to repair
damaged ligaments. Wyman's leg

will be in a cast indefinitely, until
the doctors decide it is ready for
rehabilitation.
"This is an unusual football in
jury," Bunce said. "This normally
happens more often in car or
motorcycle accidents."
Wyman injured his leg with
3:34 left in the third quarter. He
was pursuing quarterback Alfred
Jenkins when Wildcat tailback
Vance Johnson plowed low into
his leg from the side and back.
Though a case can be built from
TV replays that Johnson per
formed an illegal "crack-back"
block, Stanford Coach Jack Elway
said it was simply a "low,
downfield block."
"It was a legal block," Elway
said last night after reviewing
game films. "He (Johnson) hit him
(Wyman) just above the knee."
Elway was visibly shocked after
the game and was left virtually
speechless concerning Wyman's
injury. Yesterday, though, he said,
"It's something I never adjust to in
football. But Dave's a great player,
and he'll be back."
Bunce hopes so, too, but is
making no promises. "David is
motivated to get well and
rehabilitate himself quickly,"
Bunce said. "But there are a lot of
variables concerning this injury
that nobody can predict."
