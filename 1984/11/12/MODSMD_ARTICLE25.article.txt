## Cardinal holds off Bears 
### INGRID SEYER Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford water polo team
clinched the Pacific 10 Conference
title by defeating defending champion
University of California at Berkeley,
11-10, at DeGuerre Pool Friday.
The Pac-10 crown is Stanford's
eighth since 1975, but this title is by
far the best, according to Cardinal
Coach Dante Dettamanti.
"We came back from a 0-6 record
in the Pac-10 last year to the champi
onship this year, and we did it with a
lot of young players," Dettamanti
said. "We have never won the Pac-10
title with so many underclass men
starting for us, but we did it this year,
and it is the most satisfying title
ever."
Although the match was predicted
to be close, the Cardinal held a four
goal lead for almost two quarters and
almost lost its lead when the Bears
scored four unanswered goals in the
final five minutes of the game.
According to Stanford sophomore
Chris Thompson, the "fourth quarter
syndrome" is something the Cardinal
needs to delete from its game.
"We have this awful habit of letting

teams catch up to us at the end of the
game," Thompson said. "We work so
hard to build up a lead and then we
almost lose it. We really have to learn
to stop doing that."
Stanford jumped out to a two-goal
lead in the first quarter and widened
its advantage to four goals in the
second quarter. According to Detta
manti, the Cardinal was able to take
this lead because it took advantage of
its 6-5 situations.
"The 6-5s really did determine the
outcome of this game," Dettamanti
said. "We were able to score our
goals when we had one-man advan
tages, and they just weren't able to
capitalize on their advantages when
they had them — our defense was too
strong. We played a new 6-5 defense
on them, and they were never able to
adjust to it."
Offensively, Stanford was led by
balanced scoring. Craig Klass, Jaime
Velez, David Imbernino and Grant
Stanley scored two goals apiece, and
Erich Fisher and Chris Thompson
had one each.
Stanley, a sophomore, scored the
longest goal of the season for Stan
ford when he lobbed a shot from the
center of the pool past Cal goalie

Shaun Cleary with one second
remaining in the first half. Detta
manti said that shot was one of the
most amazing he's seen this year.
"In order to make that shot from
that distance you have to have an ab
solutely perfect arch on the ball — it
was amazing, but it sure was beauti
ful," Dettamanti said. "Grant played
his best game of the season. He was
absolutely super."
Not surprisingly, Stanley was also
pleased with his play.
"I have been in a slump all season
and I am just starting to come out of
it now," Stanley said. "I told myself
going into this game that 1 was going
to enjoy it and have a good time. 1
played well, enjoyed the game and
had a fabulous time."
Dettamanti said, "Even though a
lot of the players were nervous at the
start, they came out playing great and
executed our game plan perfectly.
"We still have two more games to
play, but neither of them are going to
matter much. We won the big one,
the one that really counts."
Stanford will host the University of
the Pacific Friday at 3 p.m. and will
play at Cal Saturday morning at
10:30.
