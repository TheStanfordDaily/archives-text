# Durden wreaks havoc on Stanford punting

Allan Durden calls his father every
Sunday morning. And every time
he calls, Earnel Durden, the San
Diego Chargers' running-back
coach, asks Allan how he played
Saturday.
Saturday night, after Arizona's
28-14 victory over Stanford, Dur
den was asked what he'd tell his fa
ther the following morning. "I
guess I'll tell him I played pretty
well," he said.
That might be understating the
issue a bit, but it will do.
Durden forced Stanford's first
two punts not to be punted and
then, in the second half, intercepted
a Fred Buckley pass deep in
Arizona territory. The Wildcat
junior also played a key role in
shutting down Cardinal receiver
Emile Harry. Harry, who caught 10
passes for 179 yards last year in
Stanford's 31-22 upset of the
Wildcats, caught one Saturday
night.
Durden's playing "pretty well"
hasn't been confined to one game,
however. He's been doing it all
season.
Durden's interception Saturday
was his sixth this season, and he
retained his Pacific 10 Conference
lead in that department. Washing
ton's Vestee Jackson momentarily
tied Durden with his fifth earlier in
the day, but Durden took back sole
possession of first place with 58
seconds left in the first half.
"It was a duck," Durden said of
Buckley's pass intended for Harry.
"I was in the right place at the right
time. He just threw it up there."
Durden, got his name on the
stadium loudspeaker for the first
time Saturday night just minutes
into the game. Facing a fourth and
one from the Stanford 17-yard line,
Cardinal punter Doug Robison
dropped back in punt formation.
"I just went in free. Nobody
blocked me," Durden said. "Their
blocking scheme was set up for the
inside people and they expected
that before I got in there the punt
would be off.
"Unfortunately for them, it
wasn't."
Durden literally flew in un
touched from the right side.
Robison sidestepped the airborne

Durden, a move he used success
fully against the University of
Washington. This time, as Stanford
Coach Jack Elway said, "it didn't
work," and Craig Vesling wrapped
up Robison at the Stanford 13,
where Arizona took over first and
10. Five plays later, the Wildcats
had a 7-0 lead.
Durden was a punt-buster for a
second time only minutes later.
"After the first punt, he (Robison)
was terrified," he said. "I got in
clean again." Robison didn't even
have a chance to sidestep Durden.
He fumbled the snap, picked it up
and met Durden head on.
When Durden wasn't intercept
ing a pass or forcing a botched
punt, he was covering Stanford
receivers, especially Harry, like
epoxy.
Although Harry was quoted as
saying the coverage by the Wildcat
secondary was "not particularly
tough," Harry could hardly talk
after catching only one pass and
having two others intended for him
intercepted.

"Emile's a good receiver, and our
goal was to shut him out," Durden
said. Was there a revenge factor to
get back for Harry's performance
last year? "Deep down inside, I
guess you could say there was," he
said. "But really, we didn't do any
thing special that we don't do to
other top recievers like (Oregon
State University's) Reggie
Bynum."
Durden's game wasn't his first
good one against Stanford. Last
year, he blocked a punt, had eight
tackles and was chosen the Wildcat
defensive player of the game.
"I just love to play against Stan
ford," the San Diego native said.
"Why? I don't know. Maybe it's
because they're a California team."
At 5-foot-11, 167 pounds, Dur
den claims he's the smallest player
on the Wildcat defense. But he's
also one of the toughest. Durden
played on Saturday with a broken
wrist he sustained against Washing
ton two weeks ago.
"A fat guy landed on me," he
joked.

Although Arizona's Allan Durden (19) didn't affect Stanford's
field-goal kicking, his pressure on punter Doug Robison prevented
two punts. He also had an interception to maintain his Pac-10 lead
in that department.
