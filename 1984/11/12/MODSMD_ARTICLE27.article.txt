# Cross-country playoffs
## Women sweep their way into NCAAs 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
TUCSON, Ariz. â€” Stanford wo
men's cross country Coach Brooks
Johnson didn't have his his No. 3 run
ner Cory Shubert, who was out be
cause of muscle spasms, at Saturday's
NCAA District 8 championships.
He didn't need her either.
The Cardinal women swept the
first three places en route to the Dis
trict 8 title and a berth in the National
Collegiate Athletic Association cross
country championships Nov. 19 at
Pennsylvania State University.
The men's team finished seventh,
out of the money for team qualifying.

Marc Oleson, however, was sixth and
will run in the nationals individually.
Senior Regina Jacobs breezed to
her fourth first-place finish in five
races this season, traversing the hilly,
5,000-meter course at the El Con
quistador Golf Course in 17:05.31.
Junior Alison Wiley, who has placed
behind Jacobs in every race this
season, was second in 17:22.31.
Senior Ceci Hopp was third in
17:34.42.
Ellen Lyons' seventh place
(17:47.72) and Christine Curtin's
13th place (18:12.84) finishes gave
the No. 2-ranked Cardinal 26 points.
Third-ranked University of Oregon,

which had five runners in the top 12,
was second with 40 points.
No other team was in double fig
ures, but six squads were bunched be
tween 100 and 200 points. Those
teams included the University of Cal
ifornia at Berkeley in third with 114
and UCLA in fourth with 138.
The top two teams in the District 8
women's race automatically qualify
for the NCAA championship meet.
Cal, as the third-place team, also has
a chance to go because its results will
be compared to those of the third
place team from District 7 for an at
large berth.
Johnson wouldn't predict a na
tional championship for the Cardinal
women. He said Oregon, which
nudged out Stanford for the NCAA
title last year, "will still be the team
we have to beat in the nationals.
"Oregon hasn't fired their last shell
yet," Johnson said. "There are still
eight days left before the nationals,
and I've seen that guy (Oregon Coach
Tom Heinonen) work miracles in
eight days."
Johnson didn't need Shubert Satur
day, but he indicated he wouldn't
mind her company at Penn State next
week. Asked if the cross country
team needs Shubert, who finished
seventh in the District 8 race as a
freshman last year, he said, "Does the
football team need John Paye?"
Jacobs led the race from start to
finish and, although she called the El
Conquistador layout "definitely a
hard course," she had little trouble
winning her fourth race in five tries
this season.
"I wasn't really thinking about
someone passing me," Jacobs said.
"My only goal was to run relaxed. I
was just trying to run my own race."
Wiley and Hopp, meanwhile, were
behind Jacobs, but not always right
behind her. At the one-mile mark,
Wiley was third and Hopp fifth, and
at two miles, Wiley was second and
Hopp sixth. It was there, on the
course's biggest hill that Hopp made
her move and passed, among others,
a pair of Oregon runners.

"This was probably the toughest
course we've run because of all the
hills and the altitude (about 3,000
feet)," Johnson said. "It's a very busy
course."
In the men's race, there are no at
large berths, meaning only the top
two teams go to Penn State. And
Stanford, which finished seventh with
192 points, wasn't close to first-place
University of Arizona (40 points) or
second-place Washington State (61).
Fresno State University was third
with % points, Oregon fourth with
126, Arizona State fifth with 172 and
University of California at Irvine
sixth with 186.
"I think we did what we realisti
cally thought we could do," said
Johnson, who is also the men's coach.
"We got one guy qualified and almost
got a second. We just have trouble
competing as a fist."
Oleson was the "one guy" who
qualified. His 31:48.5 time in the
10,000-meter course was good
enough for sixth place, and he will be
one of three District 8 representatives
at Penn State next week.
"It was as competitively tough a
race as he's run because he's not
feeling 100 percent," Johnson said of
Oleson, who had a bad head cold.
The guy who "almost" qualified
was junior Ryan Stoll, who was 16th
in 32:34.8. Stoll would've had to
finish ahead of San Jose State Uni
versity's Daniel Gonzales, who was
eighth (31:51.3), to be the district's
third and final individual qualifier.
Arizona's Tom Ansberry, as ex
pected, won the race, in 31:10.2,
nearly 30 seconds ahead of Washing
ton State's Omar Ortega, who was
second. Nine of the top 14 finishers
were from either Arizona or Wash
ington State.
After Oleson and Stoll, Stanford's
highest finisher was senior Brian Pet
tingill in 54th (33:51.8). Junior
Charles Alexander was 60th
(34:01.7) and senior Jeff Atkinson
was 66th (34:12.2) to close out the
Cardinal's top five, on which team
scoring is based.
