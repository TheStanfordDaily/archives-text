## Card finishes third in classic 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
An injury-plagued Stanford women's volleyball
team placed third this weekend in the Wendy's
Classic Tournament at Stockton, after having been
upset by No. 2-ranked UCLA in the first round.
All four of the teams that participated in the
tournament, hosted by the University of the
Pacific, are currently ranked in the nation's top six.
This week, Stanford is No. 1, UCLA is No. 2, the
University of the Pacific is No. 4 and the University
of Hawaii is No. 6.
UOP won its third Wendy's title by defeating
UCLA in five games. The Tigers also won the Na
tional Invitational Volleyball Tournament and will
probably be the nation's top-ranked team in the
next poll.
UCLA, 25-5 overall, beat Stanford, now 14-4
overall, in the first round on Saturday, 15-10, 15-
13, 8-15, 8-15, 16-14. According to Asst. Coach
Don Shaw, the Cardinal had difficulty replacing
setter Wendi Rush and hitter Teresa Smith, who
are both out with sprained ankles.

Smith was injured during practice on Friday and
may be out for a few weeks. Rush is expected to
resume play later this week.
Stanford adjusted its starting lineup against
UCLA by moving middle blocker Bobbie Broer to
Rush's outside hitting position and putting fresh
man Nancy Reno in Brier's position. Deidra
Dvorak, who was named to the All-Tournament
team, ran the 5-1 offense by setting all the way
around.
"It took us a while to get going," Shaw said. "It
was the first time we've had to play with this lineup,
and we didn't have it all together."
In the fifth game, Stanford had "a couple of
chances to win," according to Shaw. UCLA took a
3-0 lead when Dvorak was forced to leave the
match with a leg cramp. Setter Karen Haserot came
in to replace Dvorak and run the Stanford attack.
The Cardinal fought back in the game from a 7-0
deficit to a 14-11 lead. But UCLA scored five un
answered points to win the match.
"Liz Masakayon (UCLA's leading hitter) got hot
toward the end of the game," Shaw said. "She had

about three key kills and digs in the last couple of
points to put the game away. The crowd was going
crazy."
Flaying for third place, Stanford defeated
Hawaii, 17-15, 15-10, 17-15. Hawaii was the
three-time defending champion of the classic. Ac
cording to Shaw. Hawaii would have liked to win
the match to up its ranking.
"It was a good weekend considering everything
that has happened to us recently," Shaw said.
"Under the circumstances, I was really proud of the
way we played. . . . We could have thrown in the
towel against UCLA, hut we fought."
Regardless of how Stanford played, because of
the losses to San Diego State University and
UCLA this past week, the team will almost
definitely drop from the nation's top spot.
Stanford has two remaining Western Collegiate
Athletic Association matches, both away, against
Arizona State University and the University of
Arizona on Friday and Saturday, respectively. The
Cardinal will have to win both matches to retain
first place in the conference.
