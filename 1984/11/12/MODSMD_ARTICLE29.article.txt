# Looking to repeat last performance
## Women's golf team to play USIU 
### ROB GRAHAM Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford women's golf team
will travel to the San Diego area
today for the three-day, 54-hole
United States International Intercol
legiate in Rancho Bernardo.
The Cardinal, after its 10-stroke
victory in the Stanford Women's In
tercollegiate here last week, is hoping
to continue its winning ways.
But while Stanford Coach Tim
Baldwin was pleased with his team's
performance last week, he's wary of
the competition in Rancho Bernardo

because many of the squads that con
tended for the championship in the
Stanford tournament will participate
there.
The host school, the United States
International University, will be
playing on its home course, but
Baldwin expects San Jose State Uni
versity to challenge for top honors.
San Jose State finished second in the
Stanford tournament.
Still, the Cardinal, whose top five
includes two freshmen and two soph
omores, should benefit from its
match experience. Baldwin said the

all-around effort in the Stanford
tournament helped settle some
of his players. After the Cardinal's
victory, Baldwin is looking for
measurable progress in the coming
weeks.
Stanford will be led by sophomore
Kathleen McCarthy, who broke her
1983 tournament record last week
with an eight-under-par 211 en route
to the individual title. Junior Kathy
Kostas joins McCarthy to form a solid
one-two punch. The remaining three
slots on the five-woman roster,
though, are up for grabs. But because
of depth, the Cardinal probably won't

suffer from its lineup's lack of defini
tion. "We could play extremely well
with any of our 10 girls," Baldwin
said.
Stanford's early-season success has
been somewhat of a surprise, even for
Baldwin. After fourth-place perfor
mances in the Nancy Lopez Invita
tional in Tulsa, Okla. and in the
Western Intercollegiate Invitational
near Sacramento, Baldwin said, "I
feel that after the first of the year,
when our lineup is solidified, that we
will be competitive" with the
country's top teams.
