# CIR reacts to apartheid vote
## 
### HEATHER WRIGHT Staff writer 
In the wake of an ASSU referen
dum calling on Stanford to divest of
its stock in companies operating in
South Africa, a University committee
has voted unanimously that Motorola
causes major social injury by support
ing the apartheid system.
In a special meeting in response to
the student referendum, the Commit
tee on Investment Responsibility
(CIR), a 12-member committee of
faculty, students, staff and alumni,
decided on Friday to draft a letter to
Motorola asking for more informa
tion on the company's activities in
South Africa and to "give them a
chance to defend themselves and
make their case," according to CIR
member and referendum co-sponsor
Mark Landesmann.
Political Science Prof. Richard
Brody, the CIR chairman, said the
committee is now in the process of
drafting that letter. He noted the let
ter is "not in the spirit of pressuring
Motorola," but rather indicates ques
tions the committee needs answered
in preparing a recommendation for
the Stanford Board of Trustees.
The committee hopes to send its
letter to Motorola via express mail to
morrow, Landesmann said. CIR will
give Motorola until Nov. 26 to
respond to the committee's questions,
at which time the committee will
meet again to form a final decision re
garding policy recommendations to
the board of trustees.
"If Motorola doesn't respond
before then, it will be unambigous
that they don't have a case," Landes
mann said. If the company does
respond, Landesmann said CIR will
"strongly scrutinize how Motorola
defends itself."
Brody said the committee is "in the
phase of amassing evidence" and has
for now set aside pursuing divestment
policy changes in favor of "operating
within guidelines set by the board of
trustees," while still trying to get
answers from Motorola.
Landesmann said the board of trus
tees has never gone against a major

CIR recommendation, but that there
is a "theoretically non-binding rela
tionship between the advisory com
mittee and the board," and the board
could reject ClR's final recommenda
tion.
On Oct. 30 and 31, students voted
2045 to 485 in favor of divesting
Stanford's 94,000 shares of Motorola
stock because of the company's
operations in South Africa. Specifi-

cally, the referendum calls on the
University to adopt a policy of divest
ing stock in companies which show
"insufficient compliance with the Sul
livan principles and (sell) equipment
directly strengthening the apartheid
system in South Africa."
The wide support for the stock
divestment referendum in student
elections and ClR's consideration of
Motorola's South African activities
are a strongly felt "moral pressure"
on the University, Landesmann said.
The Sullivan Act was developed by
Leon Sullivan, a Philadelphia mini
ster and black employment activist
who was also a member of the Gen
eral Motors board of directors, entails
six fundamental principles.
During the last three years,
Motorola only met the basic require
ments of the Sullivan employment
principles in South Africa.
