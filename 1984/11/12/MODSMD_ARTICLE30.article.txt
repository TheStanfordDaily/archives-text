# Women hoopsters face South Koreans
## 
### JOHN LIS Daily staff 
Following a tour of New
Zealand this summer, the Stanford
women's basketball team is no
stranger to international competi
tion. The experience will come in
handy tonight when the Cardinal
faces its first action of the year in
an exhibition game against the
Kolon team of South Korea.
Stanford compiled a 6-3 record
in two weeks in New Zealand at
the end of July. The Cardinal
faced local teams as well as the
New Zealand National Team. More
important, the Cardinal faced in
ternational rules during the tour of
New Zealand, and it will face them
again tonight against South Korea.
The South Korean team is on an
eight-game, 16-day tour of the
United States, playing top-ranked
teams like Louisiana Tech, the
University of Texas and USC as
well as Stanford.
Three of the Kolon players were
members of the Korean National
Team that won a silver medal at
the Olympic Games this summer,
and two others are members of the
National "B" Team. Kolon has
been one of the top South Korean
teams for the past decade, and last
year the team won the Korean
league championship.
Three starters from last year's
Stanford team that went 5-23 will

open for the Cardinal: junior
guard Virginia Sourlis, the leading
scorer last season with a 12.6 point
per game average, Mary Bradach
and Kim Mercer.
Bradach, a forward, is the lone
senior on the Stanford team. She
averaged 11.9 points and seven
rebounds per game last year and
came into her own in the latter
part of last season.
Mercer, a sophomore, will open
at power forward. In her freshman
season, she split time with sopho
more Karen Goodewaagen, who
started at center.
Junior Judy Griffith is a surprise
starter at the off-guard spot. Last
year she played only 102 minutes
but-earned the starting spot be
cause of her good shooting touch.
The Cardinal will be treating the
contest like an exhibition, rotating
all 10 healthy players in the
lineup. Sophomore guards Erica
Mueser and Sue Sebolt are the
other returning lettermen. They
will be joined by freshmen for
ward Kami Anderson, guard
Charli Turner and center Barbara
Hunt.
Following tonight's contest,
which begins at 7:30 p.m. in
Maples P 'vilion, Stanford will
open the regular season Saturday
at the University of California at
Berkeley in a Big Game night
matchup.
