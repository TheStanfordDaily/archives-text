# Breakdown halts crew
## 
### 
The Stanford men's crew team did
not participate yesterday, as
originally scheduled, in a four-team
regatta at Newport Beach.
According to sophomore crew
member Andy Rebele, a team bus

broke down. Later, two of three
rented cars also failed. The crew got
only as far as Kettleman City.
The regatta would have been the
Cardinal's first of this season.
