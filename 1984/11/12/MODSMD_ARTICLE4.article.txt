# Memo clears STAR of 'deceit' charge

### TROY EID Daily staff 
Three student-run political groups have
been cited for violations of a Stanford
policy restricting partisan political activity
on campus, according to a University
memorandum obtained by The Daily last
night.
But in the memorandum, which was sent
Friday to various University and student
leaders, Michael Ramsey-Perez, coordina
tor of-Student Organization Services, said,
"I do not believe . . . that the violations
were intentional, or done in a systematic *
way. Indeed, after speaking with the
groups' representatives I am concerned
about the informality that characterizes
the decision-making processes of the
groups."

The memorandum, prepared in the
wake of a Tuesday meeting between
Ramsey-Perez and representatives of four
student-run political groups, was triggered
by an Oct. 31 letter to various student and
administration officials by leaders of the
Stanford College Republicans that called
for a University investigation into
"partisan activity" on campus.
Ramsey-Perez said in the memorandum
that the Students Against Reaganism Poli
tical Action Committee (STAR-PAC) vio
lated a policy that restricts access to Univer
sity facilities to officially-recognized
campus organizations.
Specifically, the memorandum notes
that STAR-PAC, a group not officially
recognized by the University, used the law
school lounge for a "donation party" in

which STAR-PAC members "voted to
decide where to contribute" funds ear
marked for political campaigns.
Questions concerning the donation
party center on Students Against
Reaganism (STAR), an officially
recognized group comprised mostly of law
school students that initially received Uni
versity funding "for educational
purposes."
STAR officials had reserved the law
school lounge for the party and had ad
vertised the event in TT>e Daily "as being
sponsored by STAR," according to the
memorandum.
In addition, the memorandum says the
Students Against Reaganism Coalition
(STAR-Coalition), an officially recognized
campus group, and the Stanford Progres

sive Alliance (SPA) "violated the Univer
sity's policy banning the use of University
telephones and office space in support of
partisan political activities." STAR-
Coalition "may or may not be" officially
affiliated with SPA, according to SPA
spokesman Mark Mazur, who said, "It's
hard to tell which groups are and are not
member groups" before this year's mem
bership is determined.
The Ramsey-Perez memorandum also
cites a violation of University phones in
connection with Stanford Students for
Mondale-Ferraro, which had listed the
SPA telephone number as a campus con
tact in a flyer "independently compiled by
two students" belonging to the Mondale-
