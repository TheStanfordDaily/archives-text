# NFL planner: a super effort for a super show
## 
### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
Jim Steeg has been to more Cardinal
football games this year than most Stan
ford students.
He saw the team beat Illinois on Sept.
15. He watched back-to-back home games
against the teams from Washington on
Oct. 13 and 20. He returned for the USC
game on Nov. 3.
He even saw the Stanford-Oklahoma
contest in September, 1983.

SUPERBOWL

Steeg, however, faces more than a cross
campus trek when he wants to see the
Cardinal play. He faces a six-hour cross
country plane ride.
But that's all part of his job as director
of special events for the National Football

League and top NFL planner for Super
Bowl XIX. Steeg's duties include prepar
ing Stanford for what he calls the "biggest
event" in the country, if not the world.
"You can't possibly imagine anything
like the Super Bowl," he said during a
half-time interview at the USC game in
Stanford Stadium.
As strains of "All Right Now" wafted up
to the press box — Steeg, tapping his leg to
the music, says he has grown to love the
LSJUMB — the former Miami Dolphins'
business official tried to convey the magni
tude of a Super Bowl game.
"I don't want to tout what it is, but it's
just such a different event than a normal
football game," he said. "It's so differ
ent. .. . It's kind of infectious.
"Let's put it this way," he said. "Nine
out of the top 10 live television broadcasts
have been Super Bowls."
The 1985 Super Bowl, pitting the cham
pionship team in the National Football
Conference against its counterpart in the
Americn Football Conference, will be

played Jan. 20 in Stanford Stadium.
Steeg, who began preparing for this
event more than a year ago, has recently
made Stanford a sort of second home.
Over the past three months, he has spent
at least one week in four here meeting with
Athletic Department officials.
According to Steeg, a resident of New
York City, there is no such thing as over
planning for a spectacle that will attract
2,700 journalists, 85,000 spectators and
120 million television viewers.
"One thing you've got to realize about
the Super Bowl is the unexpected always
happens," Steeg said. "There are those
things you don't anticipate, but all of a
sudden you've got to be prepared."
For example, Steeg recently held an
eight-hour meeting with Alan Cummings,
associate director of athletics, along with
other Athletic Department officials, to dis
cuss "a list that was like four miles long."
Among these issues, ranging from the
obvious to the unique to the trivial, were
whether umbrellas should be allowed in

the stadium and whether the sunset might
cause a glare on one of the two
Diamondvision replay scoreboards.
Other questions include how police will
handle the thousands of hangers-on who
show up without tickets, how to accommo
date more than 1,000 buses and how to
keep ABC-televison crews happy.
Steeg said one of his biggest fears is that
a huge traffic jam will develop because
fans will exit Highway 101 at University
Avenue simply because that sounds like
the logical street to take.
"That's the worst way to go," he said.
"You want to take Embarcadero. But they
see University, and they think of Stan
ford."
Nevertheless, Steeg is confident with the
preparations so far and hopes to avoid any
eleventh-hour catastrophes.
"I think we're in pretty good shape as
far as planning. We anticipate everything
coming off pretty good," he said.

The National Football League's Jim Steeg attends
yet another Stanford home game in preparation
for Super Bowl XIX.
"Our goal is that, by about the 6th
(of January), we know what's going
on and then it's kind of crisis manage
ment. We solve whatever problems
come up, and there are going to be
problems."
Steeg, who works closely with
Stanford Athletic Department offi
cials Gary Bruner, Greg Asbury and
Cummings, denied that the USC
game was a "dry run" for the Super
Bowl, as some local media had re
ported.
Even though the 3 p.m. starting
time and the temporary stadium
lights made the USC conditions
similar to the Super Bowl's, Steeg
said it is not really possible to
produce a facsimile.
"It (the USC game) is simply a
chance to see the stadium with
70,000 people in it,"he said.
One reason the Super Bowl is so
different is the class of spectators it
attracts, according to Steeg.
"The big thing is the type of clien
tele you get," Steeg said. "Tampa
(the host city of Super Bowl XVIII)
did a study last year and it showed
that something like 32 percent of the
people attending the Super Bowl
made more than $100,000 a year."
Furthermore, Steeg said the
average fan spends $1 to $1.50 on
concessions at a Stanford football
game, while the average Super Bowl
statistic runs $16 per person.
"It's also 85,000 people who have

never been to Stanford. . . . We've got
to do a lot more things like signs, in
structions, maps," Steeg said.
"You take a guy sitting on the 50-
yard line, he's going to stumble out
and he's got to have a sign, and a light
shining on that sign," he said.
Steeg said both the USC game and
the Olympic Soccer games at Stan
ford Stadium, which he also attended,
provided an opportunity to assess the
quality of lighting that will be neces
sary for the Super Bowl. Steeg said
there will be seven towers of lights
focused on the Super Bowl game, in
stead of the four that lit the USC
game, as well as additional lighting in
the parking lots.
Steeg said a Super Bowl at Stan
ford, a private university with no NFL
affiliation, "won't be any different"
than other Super Bowls.
Stanford was chosen as the logical
site when the NFL awarded the game
to the Bay Area in June, 1981. Steeg
said the college setting will help create
an even more festive atmosphere and
provide an extra resource for game
planners.
"Instead of having one body to
draw from"the —the host team —
"you're drawing from the university
plus the 49ers," Steeg said.
Cummings said student volunteers
will be used as concessionaires and
parking lot attendants.
According to Steeg, one of the best
things about having the Super Bowl
here is that Stanford offers the oppor
tunity of "taking football back to the
schools."
"The NFL has always kind of

cherished its relationship with the
colleges," Steeg said. With Stanford,
"you're talking about a place that's
got one of the richest NFL traditions,
dating back to Ernie Nevers and up to
John Elway."
Steeg also points to the economic
benefits of the event, not only to
Stanford but to all the neighboring
communities, especially those to the
north.
"All the hotels up and down El
Camino are full," Steeg said. "The
Super Bowl is going to have 75,000
people using 35 to 40,000 hotel
rooms. It will probably mean about
$100 million."
Steeg calls the Super Bowl "a big
ger convention than any other con
vention in the country."
When Super Bowl weekend
arrives, Steeg, who watched the USC
game from a perch atop the roof of
the stadium press box, knows it will
be exciting.
"When you really get caught up in
everything that's happening, when
you see the television crews rolling in
and you've got 2,700 media people
running around . . . the atmosphere is
great," Steeg gushed.
Amid this revelry, Steeg and a
corps of NFL representatives will be
making last-minute decisions and
ironing out the unexpected. They've
taken hotel rooms in San Francisco
and at the Stanford Park Hotel in
Menlo Park for the week before the
game, and there will be an NFL
trailer behind the stadium.
"We'll be around," Steeg said.

"you're talking about a place that's

John Elway."
Steeg also points to the economic
benefits of the event, not only to
Stanford but to all the neighboring
communities, especially those to the
north.
"All the hotels up and down El
Camino are full," Steeg said. "The
Super Bowl is going to have 75,000
people using 35 to 40,000 hotel
rooms. It will probably mean about
$100 million."
Steeg calls the Super Bowl "a big
ger convention than any other con
vention in the country."
When Super Bowl weekend
arrives, Steeg, who watched the USC
game from a perch atop the roof of
the stadium press box, knows it will
be exciting.
"When you really get caught up in
everything that's happening, when
you see the television crews rolling in
and you've got 2,700 media people
running around . . . the atmosphere is
great," Steeg gushed.
Amid this revelry, Steeg and a
corps of NFL representatives will be
making last-minute decisions and
ironing out the unexpected. They've
taken hotel rooms in San Francisco
and at the Stanford Park Hotel in
Menlo Park for the week before the

"We'll be around," Steeg said.
Jim Steeg has been to more Cardinal
football games this year than most Stan
ford students.
He saw the team beat Illinois on Sept.
15. He watched back-to-back home games
against the teams from Washington on
Oct. 13 and 20. He returned for the USC
game on Nov. 3.
He even saw the Stanford-Oklahoma
contest in September, 1983.

SUPERBOWL

Steeg, however, faces more than a cross
campus trek when he wants to see the
Cardinal play. He faces a six-hour cross
country plane ride.
But that's all part of his job as director
of special events for the National Football

League and top NFL planner for Super
Bowl XIX. Steeg's duties include prepar
ing Stanford for what he calls the "biggest
event" in the country, if not the world.
"You can't possibly imagine anything

half-time interview at the USC game in

"I don't want to tout what it is, but it's

football game," he said. "It's so differ

"Let's put it this way," he said. "Nine
out of the top 10 live television broadcasts
have been Super Bowls."
The 1985 Super Bowl, pitting the cham
pionship team in the National Football
Conference against its counterpart in the
Americn Football Conference, will be

played Jan. 20 in Stanford Stadium.
Steeg, who began preparing for this
event more than a year ago, has recently
made Stanford a sort of second home.
Over the past three months, he has spent
at least one week in four here meeting with
Athletic Department officials.
According to Steeg, a resident of New
York City, there is no such thing as over
planning for a spectacle that will attract
2,700 journalists, 85,000 spectators and
120 million television viewers.
"One thing you've got to realize about
the Super Bowl is the unexpected always
happens," Steeg said. "There are those
things you don't anticipate, but all of a
sudden you've got to be prepared."
For example, Steeg recently held an
eight-hour meeting with Alan Cummings,
associate director of athletics, along with
other Athletic Department officials, to dis
cuss "a list that was like four miles long."
Among these issues, ranging from the
obvious to the unique to the trivial, were
whether umbrellas should be allowed in

the stadium and whether the sunset might
cause a glare on one of the two
Diamondvision replay scoreboards.
Other questions include how police will
handle the thousands of hangers-on who
show up without tickets, how to accommo
date more than 1,000 buses and how to
keep ABC-televison crews happy.
Steeg said one of his biggest fears is that
a huge traffic jam will develop because
fans will exit Highway 101 at University
Avenue simply because that sounds like
the logical street to take.
"That's the worst way to go," he said.
"You want to take Embarcadero. But they
see University, and they think of Stan

Nevertheless, Steeg is confident with the
preparations so far and hopes to avoid any

"I think we're in pretty good shape as

coming off pretty good," he said.

The National Football League's Jim Steeg attends

for Super Bowl XIX.
"Our goal is that, by about the 6th

come up, and there are going to be
problems."
Steeg, who works closely with
Stanford Athletic Department offi
cials Gary Bruner, Greg Asbury and
Cummings, denied that the USC
game was a "dry run" for the Super
Bowl, as some local media had re
ported.
Even though the 3 p.m. starting
time and the temporary stadium
lights made the USC conditions
similar to the Super Bowl's, Steeg
said it is not really possible to
produce a facsimile.
"It (the USC game) is simply a
chance to see the stadium with
70,000 people in it,"he said.
One reason the Super Bowl is so
different is the class of spectators it
attracts, according to Steeg.
"The big thing is the type of clien
tele you get," Steeg said. "Tampa
(the host city of Super Bowl XVIII)
did a study last year and it showed
that something like 32 percent of the
people attending the Super Bowl
made more than $100,000 a year."
Furthermore, Steeg said the
average fan spends $1 to $1.50 on
concessions at a Stanford football
game, while the average Super Bowl
statistic runs $16 per person.
"It's also 85,000 people who have

never been to Stanford. . . . We've got
to do a lot more things like signs, in
structions, maps," Steeg said.
"You take a guy sitting on the 50-
yard line, he's going to stumble out
and he's got to have a sign, and a light
shining on that sign," he said.
Steeg said both the USC game and
the Olympic Soccer games at Stan
ford Stadium, which he also attended,
provided an opportunity to assess the
quality of lighting that will be neces
sary for the Super Bowl. Steeg said
there will be seven towers of lights
focused on the Super Bowl game, in
stead of the four that lit the USC
game, as well as additional lighting in
the parking lots.
Steeg said a Super Bowl at Stan
ford, a private university with no NFL
affiliation, "won't be any different"
than other Super Bowls.
Stanford was chosen as the logical
site when the NFL awarded the game
to the Bay Area in June, 1981. Steeg
said the college setting will help create
an even more festive atmosphere and
provide an extra resource for game
planners.

Bowl, as some local media had re
ported.
Even though the 3 p.m. starting
time and the temporary stadium
lights made the USC conditions
similar to the Super Bowl's, Steeg
said it is not really possible to
produce a facsimile.
"It (the USC game) is simply a
chance to see the stadium with
70,000 people in it,"he said.
One reason the Super Bowl is so
different is the class of spectators it
attracts, according to Steeg.
"The big thing is the type of clien
tele you get," Steeg said. "Tampa
(the host city of Super Bowl XVIII)
did a study last year and it showed
that something like 32 percent of the
people attending the Super Bowl
made more than $100,000 a year."
Furthermore, Steeg said the
average fan spends $1 to $1.50 on
concessions at a Stanford football
game, while the average Super Bowl
statistic runs $16 per person.
"It's also 85,000 people who have

never been to Stanford. . . . We've got
to do a lot more things like signs, in
structions, maps," Steeg said.
"You take a guy sitting on the 50-
yard line, he's going to stumble out
and he's got to have a sign, and a light
shining on that sign," he said.
Steeg said both the USC game and
the Olympic Soccer games at Stan
ford Stadium, which he also attended,
provided an opportunity to assess the
quality of lighting that will be neces
sary for the Super Bowl. Steeg said
there will be seven towers of lights
focused on the Super Bowl game, in
stead of the four that lit the USC
game, as well as additional lighting in
the parking lots.
Steeg said a Super Bowl at Stan
ford, a private university with no NFL
affiliation, "won't be any different"
than other Super Bowls.
Stanford was chosen as the logical
site when the NFL awarded the game
to the Bay Area in June, 1981. Steeg
said the college setting will help create
an even more festive atmosphere and
provide an extra resource for game
planners.
"Instead of having one body to
draw from"the —the host team —
"you're drawing from the university
plus the 49ers," Steeg said.
Cummings said student volunteers
will be used as concessionaires and
parking lot attendants.
According to Steeg, one of the best
things about having the Super Bowl
here is that Stanford offers the oppor
tunity of "taking football back to the
schools."
"The NFL has always kind of

cherished its relationship with the
colleges," Steeg said. With Stanford,
"you're talking about a place that's
got one of the richest NFL traditions,
dating back to Ernie Nevers and up to
John Elway."
Steeg also points to the economic
benefits of the event, not only to
Stanford but to all the neighboring
communities, especially those to the
north.
"All the hotels up and down El
Camino are full," Steeg said. "The
Super Bowl is going to have 75,000
people using 35 to 40,000 hotel
rooms. It will probably mean about
$100 million."
Steeg calls the Super Bowl "a big
ger convention than any other con
vention in the country."
When Super Bowl weekend
arrives, Steeg, who watched the USC
game from a perch atop the roof of
the stadium press box, knows it will
be exciting.
"When you really get caught up in
everything that's happening, when
you see the television crews rolling in
and you've got 2,700 media people
running around . . . the atmosphere is
great," Steeg gushed.
Amid this revelry, Steeg and a
corps of NFL representatives will be
making last-minute decisions and
ironing out the unexpected. They've
taken hotel rooms in San Francisco
and at the Stanford Park Hotel in
Menlo Park for the week before the
game, and there will be an NFL
trailer behind the stadium.
"We'll be around," Steeg said.
