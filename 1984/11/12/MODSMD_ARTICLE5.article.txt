# NFL planner: a super effort for a super show
## 
### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
Jim Steeg has been to more Cardinal
football games this year than most Stan
ford students.
He saw the team beat Illinois on Sept.
15. He watched back-to-back home games
against the teams from Washington on
Oct. 13 and 20. He returned for the USC
game on Nov. 3.
He even saw the Stanford-Oklahoma
contest in September, 1983.

SUPERBOWL

Steeg, however, faces more than a cross
campus trek when he wants to see the
Cardinal play. He faces a six-hour cross
country plane ride.
But that's all part of his job as director
of special events for the National Football

League and top NFL planner for Super
Bowl XIX. Steeg's duties include prepar
ing Stanford for what he calls the "biggest
event" in the country, if not the world.
"You can't possibly imagine anything
like the Super Bowl," he said during a
half-time interview at the USC game in
Stanford Stadium.
As strains of "All Right Now" wafted up
to the press box — Steeg, tapping his leg to
the music, says he has grown to love the
LSJUMB — the former Miami Dolphins'
business official tried to convey the magni
tude of a Super Bowl game.
"I don't want to tout what it is, but it's
just such a different event than a normal
football game," he said. "It's so differ
ent. .. . It's kind of infectious.
"Let's put it this way," he said. "Nine
out of the top 10 live television broadcasts
have been Super Bowls."
The 1985 Super Bowl, pitting the cham
pionship team in the National Football
Conference against its counterpart in the
Americn Football Conference, will be

played Jan. 20 in Stanford Stadium.
Steeg, who began preparing for this
event more than a year ago, has recently
made Stanford a sort of second home.
Over the past three months, he has spent
at least one week in four here meeting with
Athletic Department officials.
According to Steeg, a resident of New
York City, there is no such thing as over
planning for a spectacle that will attract
2,700 journalists, 85,000 spectators and
120 million television viewers.
"One thing you've got to realize about
the Super Bowl is the unexpected always
happens," Steeg said. "There are those
things you don't anticipate, but all of a
sudden you've got to be prepared."
For example, Steeg recently held an
eight-hour meeting with Alan Cummings,
associate director of athletics, along with
other Athletic Department officials, to dis
cuss "a list that was like four miles long."
Among these issues, ranging from the
obvious to the unique to the trivial, were
whether umbrellas should be allowed in

the stadium and whether the sunset might
cause a glare on one of the two
Diamondvision replay scoreboards.
Other questions include how police will
handle the thousands of hangers-on who
show up without tickets, how to accommo
date more than 1,000 buses and how to
keep ABC-televison crews happy.
Steeg said one of his biggest fears is that
a huge traffic jam will develop because
fans will exit Highway 101 at University
Avenue simply because that sounds like
the logical street to take.
"That's the worst way to go," he said.
"You want to take Embarcadero. But they
see University, and they think of Stan
ford."
Nevertheless, Steeg is confident with the
preparations so far and hopes to avoid any
eleventh-hour catastrophes.
"I think we're in pretty good shape as
far as planning. We anticipate everything
coming off pretty good," he said.
