Japanese planes chase Soviet craft
TOKYO — Forty Japanese jetfighters chased a Soviet bomber which
violated Japan's airspace this morning despite repeated warnings, a
Defense Agency spokesman said.
The spokesman said nine Soviet bombers were flying south past the
Tsushima Straits, between South Korea and Japan, in international
airspace.
Four of the bombers turned back to the north. Despite repeated radio
warnings from Japanese ground stations and from Japanese air defense
jetfighters, one of the four, a Tu-16 Badger, violated Japanese airspace
above the island of Okinoshima for two minutes, the spokesman said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
The Japanese jetfighters included F-4 Phantoms and F-15 Eagles.
The Soviet bomber left Japanese airspace and continued on its nor
therly course, the spokesman said.
The last time a Soviet military plane violated Japanese airspace was on
Nov. 15, 1983, officials said.
In the past five years, Soviet military aircraft have flown close to, but
not violated, Japanese airspace an average 315 times a year, according
to a Defense Agency report.
Discovery to retrieve satellites
SPACE CENTER, Houston — Discovery flew ever closer to the
wayward Palapa B2 satellite yesterday as the astronaut crew repaired
two sets of spacewalk lights and prepared for history's first attempt to
take a satellite back to Earth for repairs.
Mission commander Rick Hauck and pilot David Walker, who have
been stalking Palapa around the globe since Discovery was launched
Thursday, fired a series of rocket bursts to move the shuttle's orbit closer
to the satellite.
A final series of rocket bursts early today should bring Discovery to
within 35 feet of Palapa.
The shuttle will fly in formation while spacewalking astronauts Dale
Gardner and Joe Allen capture the 1,500-pound satellite. Allen, free
flying with a rocket backpack, will attach a handle to Palapa using a
pole-like device called a "stinger."
Astronaut Anna Fisher, operating controls inside the cabin, will use
the shuttle's 50-foot robot arm to grasp the handle and place the satellite
in Discovery's cargo bay.
The six-hour space walk is set to begin at about 8:20 a.m. EST today.
A second salvage attempt, on Palapa's sister satellite Westar 6, is
scheduled for Wednesday, with Gardner flying the rocket backpack.
Palapa and Westar, communications satellites worth about $35 mil
lion each, were left in useless orbits in February when their rockets
misfired after they were carried into orbit by a shuttle and released in
space.
Diablo Canyon is activated
SAN LUIS OBISPO — The $5.3 billion Diablo Canyon nuclear
power plant began producing electricity yesterday for the first time in its
stormy 16-year history, as the Unit 1 reactor reached 15-percent
capacity, officials said.
"For the first time we have an operating nuclear power plant putting
out electricity on the system," Pacific Gas & Electric spokesman Ron
Weinberg said yesterday.
The power is being generated as part of a testing program begun after
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued a full-power operating
license Nov. 2, Weinberg said.
The plant, on the coast midway between Los Angeles and San Fran
cisco, reached 15-percent capacity at 3 a.m. yesterday and was generat
ing about 80,000 kilowatts, and is serving 75,000 people, Weinberg said.
"The electricity is serving PG&E customers right now," Weinberg
said. The power is feeding into the utility company's system and is not
serving a specific area, he said.
Weinberg emphasized that the plant is not yet in commercial opera
tion. and that customers won't pay for the power generated by Diablo
until the Public Utilities Commission approves a rate increase.
Vandal hits Holocaust memorial
SAN FRANCISCO — A memorial to Holocaust victims was dis
covered vandalized yesterday, with the words "Is This Necessary?"
scrawled on a wall next to the exhibit, police said.
The faces of 10 statues in the controversial memorial also were
painted black and yellow by vandals.
Sgt. Philip Tolind of the San Francisco Police Department said that
the vandalism occurred between 4 p.m. Saturday and 8 a.m. yesterday
He said the vandalized statues and wall were washed and will be
repainted.
"This reaffirms our fears that the world has not yet learned," said Bill
Lowenberg, chairman of the Committee of Remembrance, a group of
concentration camp survivors.
The $500,000 memorial, titled "The Survivor," has been criticized by
some for its graphic depiction of victims of Nazi prisons. The exhibit
consists of 10 bodies loosely heaped on top of each other and a solitary
figure standing in front of a nearby barbed wire fence.
(George Segal, the artist whose "Gay Liberation" statue was attacked
by a hammer-wielding vandal on campus last year, created the
Holocaust memorial.)
Riot police block Solidarity march
WARSAW. Poland — Riot police backed by water cannon yesterday
night blocked about 4,000 Solidarity supporters from marching through
the center of Warsaw in an unofficial observance of Poland's pre-World
War II independence day.
A stream of worshipers emerged quietly in the cold night air from a
Mass at St. John's Cathedral in Warsaw's Old Town, led by members of
two outlawed opposition groups bearing wreaths for Poland's Tomb of
the Unknown Soldier, about a mile away.
As helmeted riot police spread across a main street, blocking the line
of marchers, the crowd chanted "No freedom without solidarity!" and
"Murderers!" The latter was a reference to the killing last month of Fath
er Jerzy Popieluszko, a popular pro-Solidarity priest. Three secret
police officers have been accused of his murder.
The crowd threw coins at the police, chanting, "Don't beat your broth
ers for money." It dispersed after about half an hour, without the use of
force.
The authorities allowed five members of the outlawed Confederation
for an Independent Poland, known by its Polish initials KPN, to lay a
wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, but only after they showed
police their identity documents.
Martin Luther King Sr. dies
ATLANTA — The Rev. Martin Luther King Sr., the father of slain
civil-rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., died yesterday at Crawford
Long Hospital. He was 84.
Bernice Thompson, a secretary at Ebenezei Baptist Church, said King
was taken from his home to the hospital yesterday.
The elder King retired in 1975 as pastor of the Atlanta church where
his late son, Martin, also had served as co-pastor.
King, the son of a Georgia sharecropper, had a life marred by tragedy.
In addition to the assassination of his eldest son. King's wife. Alberta,
also was slain by a gunman and his only other son, A.D., also a preacher,
drowned in a backyard swimming pool in 1969.
King's non-violent preachings during the 1950s and '60s earned him a
place at the forefront of the civil-rights movement. In recent years, he
traveled extensively, campaigning for human rights.
Today's weather
