# Bishops make plea for poor
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Roman Catholic bishops
this week begin debate on a pastoral letter saying
that the United States has a moral obligation to
ensure that no one is hungry, homeless or un
employed.
Wealth is so unevenly distributed in the United
States that it does not meet the "minimum standard
of distributive justice," and there must be a greater
transfer of wealth to the poor, the letter said.
A draft of the proposed pastoral letter was
released yesterday by the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops, a day before the beginning of a
week-long meeting here. The publication of the
draft begins what is expected to be a year-long
debate among Catholics before an anticipated final
vote on the pastoral letter by the bishops next No
vember.
Written by a committee of five bishops headed
by Archbishop Rembert Weakland of Milwaukee,
the 136-page draft letter is written as a bill of rights
for the poor and jobless, couched in moral rather
than political language.
Unlike civil rights, "economic rights" — ade
quate nutrition, housing and employment — do not
hold a "privileged position" in the United States,
the drafters said.
The bishops called on the nation to frame "a new
national consensus that all persons have rights in
the economic sphere and that society has a moral
obligation ... to ensure that no one among us is
hungry, homeless, unemployed or otherwise denied
what is necessary to live with dignity."
To meet these basic needs, there must be a larger
transfer of wealth from the richest in America to
those less well off, the bishops said, citing biblical
warnings of the moral peril of great wealth.
"The distribution of income and wealth in the
United States is so inequitable that it violates the

minimum standard of distributive justice. In 1982
the richest 20 percent of Americans received more
income that the bottom 70 percent combined . .
the bishops said.
While recognizing the right of individuals to
amass wealth and property, the bishops warned
against the temptations of "indifference and
greed," saying these "sins . .. continue to block ef
forts to secure the minimum economic rights of all
persons."
"Certainly in Catholic society, there is a ten
dency to try to measure one's worth by the ac
cumulation of luxury goods. Those temptations are
out there," Weakland said. "Wealth can be a dan
ger."
By the same token, the United States has respon
sibilities to the poor nations of the world that it is
not now meeting, the bishops said.
The draft letter, three years in preparation, was
deliberately withheld by the bishops until after last
Tuesay's presidential election, because, they said,
they did not want their effort to be seen as politi
cally motivated.
In a news conference yesterday, Weakland was
asked whether he was troubled by President
Reagan's campaign theme suggesting that
Americans cast their ballots on the basis of whether
they are better off now than four years ago.
"To me, the real question ... as a religious
leader and preacher of the gospel ... is what you're
doing with your money now that you're better
off. . . . Because we are better off, we realize our
obligation to those who are less fortunate," Weak
land said.
The Catholic Church "is no longer an immigrant
church," said Bishop Peter Rosazza, auxiliary bish
op of Hartford, Conn., and one of the five authors

of the draft letter. The church's teaching has not
kept up with the fact that so many Catholics have
moved from "working class" status into positions
of power and leadership in society. It is to these
Catholics, in particular, that the letter appears to
speak.
The letter calls for a major commitment to
reduce unemployment to a range of 3 or 4 percent
— or roughly half recent levels — through govern
ment employment programs targeted on long-term
unemployed and private job-training programs.
It asks for tax reform to "reduce the burden on
the poor" and a range of efforts to improve educa
tional, child care and job opportunities for the poor
and minorities. Its proposals, however, are limited
to broad goals rather than specific strategies.
It recommends major reforms of the nation s
welfare system, calling it "woefully inadequate."
There should be national eligibility standards for
welfare and a national minimum-benefit levels for
public assistance, and welfare policies should be
changed to strengthen, not weaken the family, the
letter says.
Weakland recalled that he spent many years on
welfare as a child in Patton, Pa., after the death of
his father in 1932, when he was five. The focus of
welfare and employment programs must be to help
people become independent and self-supporting
once again, he said.
He recalled the day as a high-school student
when he brought home his first paycheck to his moth
er. At that moment, he said, "I grew up. That
gave me a whole new way of seeing life. I became a
participant, a contributor, and I felt my own dig
nity. ..."

The Catholic Church "is no longer an immigrant
church," said Bishop Peter Rosazza, auxiliary bish
op of Hartford, Conn., and one of the five authors

of the draft letter. The church's teaching has not
kept up with the fact that so many Catholics have
moved from "working class" status into positions
of power and leadership in society. It is to these
Catholics, in particular, that the letter appears to
speak.
The letter calls for a major commitment to
reduce unemployment to a range of 3 or 4 percent
— or roughly half recent levels — through govern
ment employment programs targeted on long-term
unemployed and private job-training programs.
It asks for tax reform to "reduce the burden on
the poor" and a range of efforts to improve educa
tional, child care and job opportunities for the poor
and minorities. Its proposals, however, are limited
to broad goals rather than specific strategies.
It recommends major reforms of the nation s
welfare system, calling it "woefully inadequate."
There should be national eligibility standards for
welfare and a national minimum-benefit levels for
public assistance, and welfare policies should be
changed to strengthen, not weaken the family, the
letter says.
Weakland recalled that he spent many years on
welfare as a child in Patton, Pa., after the death of
his father in 1932, when he was five. The focus of
welfare and employment programs must be to help
people become independent and self-supporting
once again, he said.
He recalled the day as a high-school student
when he brought home his first paycheck to his moth
er. At that moment, he said, "I grew up. That
gave me a whole new way of seeing life. I became a
participant, a contributor, and I felt my own dig
nity. ..."

WASHINGTON — Roman Catholic bishops
this week begin debate on a pastoral letter saying
that the United States has a moral obligation to
ensure that no one is hungry, homeless or un
employed.
Wealth is so unevenly distributed in the United
States that it does not meet the "minimum standard
of distributive justice," and there must be a greater
transfer of wealth to the poor, the letter said.
A draft of the proposed pastoral letter was
released yesterday by the National Conference of
Catholic Bishops, a day before the beginning of a
week-long meeting here. The publication of the
draft begins what is expected to be a year-long
debate among Catholics before an anticipated final
vote on the pastoral letter by the bishops next No
vember.
Written by a committee of five bishops headed
by Archbishop Rembert Weakland of Milwaukee,
the 136-page draft letter is written as a bill of rights
for the poor and jobless, couched in moral rather
than political language.
Unlike civil rights, "economic rights" — ade
quate nutrition, housing and employment — do not
hold a "privileged position" in the United States,
the drafters said.
The bishops called on the nation to frame "a new
national consensus that all persons have rights in
the economic sphere and that society has a moral
obligation ... to ensure that no one among us is
hungry, homeless, unemployed or otherwise denied
what is necessary to live with dignity."
To meet these basic needs, there must be a larger
transfer of wealth from the richest in America to
those less well off, the bishops said, citing biblical
warnings of the moral peril of great wealth.
"The distribution of income and wealth in the
United States is so inequitable that it violates the

minimum standard of distributive justice. In 1982
the richest 20 percent of Americans received more
income that the bottom 70 percent combined . .
the bishops said.
While recognizing the right of individuals to
amass wealth and property, the bishops warned
against the temptations of "indifference and
greed," saying these "sins . .. continue to block ef
forts to secure the minimum economic rights of all
persons."
"Certainly in Catholic society, there is a ten
dency to try to measure one's worth by the ac
cumulation of luxury goods. Those temptations are
out there," Weakland said. "Wealth can be a dan
ger."
By the same token, the United States has respon
sibilities to the poor nations of the world that it is
not now meeting, the bishops said.
The draft letter, three years in preparation, was
deliberately withheld by the bishops until after last
Tuesay's presidential election, because, they said,
they did not want their effort to be seen as politi
cally motivated.
In a news conference yesterday, Weakland was
asked whether he was troubled by President
Reagan's campaign theme suggesting that
Americans cast their ballots on the basis of whether
they are better off now than four years ago.
"To me, the real question ... as a religious
leader and preacher of the gospel ... is what you're
doing with your money now that you're better
off. . . . Because we are better off, we realize our
obligation to those who are less fortunate," Weak
land said.
The Catholic Church "is no longer an immigrant
church," said Bishop Peter Rosazza, auxiliary bish
op of Hartford, Conn., and one of the five authors

of the draft letter. The church's teaching has not
kept up with the fact that so many Catholics have
