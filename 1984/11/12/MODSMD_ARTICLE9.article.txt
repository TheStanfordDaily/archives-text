# Aides: Reagan cabinet changes possible
## 
### 
SANTA BARBARA â€” President
Reagan ended his vacation yesterday
and returned to the White House to
take command of planning for his
second term amid indications that
many top government jobs could
change hands.
There were increasing hints of ex
tensive personnel changes in the next
few months despite Reagan's public
statements of endorsement of his
Cabinet and other top aides.
White House spokesman Larry
Speakes said Reagan would tell his
Cabinet at a meeting tomorrow "that
he desires that all of them stay" be
cause he does not want to break up a
winning team.
However, some presidential aides
believe Labor Secretary Raymond

Donovan should step down rather
than remain on leave indefinitely
while he battles criminal charges of
corruption involving the New Jersey
construction company where he pre
viously served as an executive.
These presidential advisers were
known to be pressing their view to
streamline the White House staff and
the federal bureaucracy and ease out
those whose performances have been
substandard.
Reagan and his wife, Nancy, left
their mountaintop ranch to return to
the White House yesterday. Reagan
has been away since Nov. 1 when he
began his final campaign journey.
At the White House, the trio of ad
visers that has ruled for the past four

years will almost certainly be dis
mantled. It consists of Chief of Staff
James Baker 111, Deputy Chief of
Staff Michael Deaver and presiden
tial counselor Edwin Meese.
Despite financial problems that
came to light after Meese was
nominated to replace Attorney Gen
eral William French Smith, aides
remain convinced Meese will be con
firmed by the Republican-controlled
Senate.
So far, Smith and Education Secre
tary Terrell Bell are the only Cabinet
members to say they won't return.
Many believe Deaver, who has
been responsible for molding
Reagan's image, will leave shortly
after the inauguration. Deaver has
complained for years about the high

cost of Washington life, though many
believe he would stay if given the
chief of staff job. But that job is not
open now.
Baker is said to want a front-line
Cabinet job, but none is expected to
open up immediately. Therefore, as
Baker said last week, he expects to
remain at the White House for the
foreseeable future.
Richard Darman, the third most
influential adviser behind Baker
and Deaver, is known to covet a more
visible position. It is widely known
Darman would like to succeed David
Stockman, who heads the Office of
Management and Budget but may
step down by the time the 1986 fiscal
budget is prepared.
