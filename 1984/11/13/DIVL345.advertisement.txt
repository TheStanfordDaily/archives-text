to celebrate the new facilities of
The Center for Teaching and Learning.
CTI supports the teaching improvement efforts of Stanford faculty and TAs through workshops,
videotaping/consultation reading materials, and a variety of other resources.
We also offer learning services for students: academic peer tutoring for undergraduates, study skills
classes, and speed reading.
