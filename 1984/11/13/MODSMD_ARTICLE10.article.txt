# Storm threatens more damage
## Tanker spill pollutes coast 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO â€” Hundreds
of birds died as oil slicks oozed
through a major seaside rookery, and
a powerful Alaskan storm threatened
to cause more harm yesterday as it
roared toward a severed tanker bow
containing nearly 2.8 million gallons
of oil.
About 4,000 birds have probably
been affected by the thousands of gal
lons of oily goo from the sunken stern
of the tanker, the SS Puerto Rican,
said Stephanie Kaza, spokeswoman
for the Point Reyes Bird Obser
vatory.

The spill occurred when the petro
chemical tanker was ripped by three
explosions 15 miles off the Golden
Gate on Oct. 31. Three days later, the
abandoned 632-foot vessel broke
apart.
The stern, containing more than 1
million gallons of oils, later sank in
2,400 feet of water; and about
105,000 gallons of oil leaked into
the Pacific.
The National Weather Service
issued gale warnings for a large
stretch of the north coast yesterday,

predicting swells to 12 feet and gale
force winds. The Coast Guard said
seas were expected to reach 15 feet.
Huge patches of oil have moved
steadily northward in recent days,
polluting the coast near the Farallon
Islands and at Bodega Bay. There
was an unconfirmed report that oil
had washed ashore at Fort Ross.
Coast Guard spokesman Dale
Puckett said a 6-mile layer of oil was
found about five miles west of
Gualala, nearly 90 miles north of San
Francisco. There were a dozen 25-
foot-wide bands of yellow foam

crossing the oil layer.
The ship s bow, meanwhile, was re
ported stable in a holding pattern un
der tow about 75 miles southwest of
the Golden Gate, where its watertight
bulkheads last week weathered three
Arctic storms deemed smaller than
yesterday's.
The bow contains an estimated 2.4
million gallons of lube oil and
alkanes, a fuel additive, and is under
control of the German salvage ship
Titan.
