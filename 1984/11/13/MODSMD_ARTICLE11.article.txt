## Wanderings Hashing: more than just serving food 
### MARILYN WANN 
"Give me your tired, your poor,
your huddled potential hashers,
yearning to breathe tree in the warm
ing tray steam," says Wilbur Food
Service.
"Hashing, because of its close asso
ciation with dorm food, is to be
avoided or at most taken in small por
tions," says popular myth.
"We need a few good men and wo
men (Stanford students will do
fine)," says food service again.
"Hashers, well . . . hashers hash,"
says- popular myth with a conclusive
shudder.
"Our starting hourly rate for the
simplest job is $4.87. That toll free
number is 497-4247 and our
operators will be standing by to help
you," says Wilbur to end the refrain.
Well, it was no debate. They didn't

even have to patronize me or mention
the World Series. I called. I hashed. 1
conquered. Take that, you malicious
myths; I had fun hashing.
Of course, I also have yet to be
paid for my two hours of loyal service
manning the front lines on dreaded
taco day.
I arrived at 11:30 am, shiny-faced
and eager for my first hashing experi
ence. I even wore sensible shoes.
Lunch at Wilbur is feeding time for
675 hungry, meal-card-carrying
tummies and it takes 26 students, 25
employees and three supervisors to
keep the lines moving at that snail's
pace people complain about so often.
Head supervisor Kay Malik
showed me downstairs to a wardrobe
room where I took my pick of many
stylish red aprons and tan plaid caps.
As a frequent user of food service.

the only other in-depth training I
needed before serving minestrone on
the line was a quick hand washing.
As a trainee hasher I did get a tour
of the Wilbur kitchen, which bakes
the bread and pastries for most of the
other dorms and prepares some of the
other dishes.
Winding past Hansel and Gretel
sized ovens and a dish washer remi
niscent of the early vacuum tube
computers, I remember Assistant Su
pervisor Jan Roberts pointing out
what she called La Machine. The
cook could fill it with vegetables from
a 40 gallon bowl. I pictured it in oper
ation, making chewing noises like a
rabid washing machine trying to spin
cycle a medieval knight's suit of ar
mor. Not a pretty sight.
Roberts ended the tour by explain

ing her job. She helps train the hash
ers to care about the people they
serve. She tastes each batch of food
herself for saltiness and oversees
many other details of service.
"We keep the paper cups upside
down like this so that when the hash
ers refill the holders they won't have
to touch the rims," she said,
straightening the stacked cups waiting
on the edge of the counter.
"You'll serve soup today. I tell my
workers to take a figure eight stir like
this and dip aiming for the center of
the cup," she demonstrated, leaving
me to fend for myself as the first of
the line started through.
Heeding her warning not to keep
too many cups of minestrone
prepared at once in order to keep
them as warm as possible, I tried to
predict which people would be the

soup-type before they got to my sta
tion.
I began to identify more general
categories of food service patrons.
There are the always lively com
plainers who ask questions like, "Is
this a taco or a stray paper airplane
from last Sunday's flicks?" or agonize
over their decisions, finally saying,
"I'll have the beige entree and the or
ange side dish." They're careful to get
their recommended daily allowance
of the basic color groups, at least.
The complainer's curiosity and in
decision is only exceeded by his appe
tite. Hashers can look forward to
catching his routine at least two times
for each entree.
Then there are the timid skeptics
who look like they suspect the latest
variety of macaroni casserole is a
cover for massive toxic waste dum
ping projects in the Bay Area.
The skeptics are easy to recognize.
They carry their trays as if a spring
loaded mechanism underneath is
about to catapult their food up at
them and they have to be ready to
dodge the carrot missiles and tapioca
pudding bombs.
A third type reads all the latest
health and nutrition articles and com
plains that all the vitamins have been
steamed out of the broccoli.
They generally refuse all items that
don't list bran or bean sprouts as in
gredients or don't have the word
'puff as part of the name.
Most of the people in line are picky
eaters only out of self-defense and I
tried out various soup-selling strate
gies on them.
"Mm, mm, good," I would say con
vincingly. "Just think, Mikey likes
it!"
I worked on my timing, too. Just as
they decided to pass me by I would
chime out, "Good stuff, Maynard."
I also served the tacos, the meat or
bean and cheese burritos and the chili
macaroni casserole when the line
bunched up.
Taco Day, the technical jargon for
the meal I worked, is disliked by has
hers because people come back for
seconds more and there are extra top
pings on the salad bar to keep
refilled.
This is the hot runner's job along
with supplying the line with new serv
ing trays when they run out. There
are also cold runners. Together, they
are called hot and cold runners by
management, which sounded a little

too much like faucets for me.
I followed freshman Claudia Hess
on her running duties to sample all
the jobs in the Wilbur kitchen.
"I hate Taco Days," she said as she
picked shredded lettuce and cheese
from between the salsa bottles. "It's
the most work."
She also serves during the eight to
10 hours a week she works for food
service. "You're supposed to try to
sell the food," she said, as I realized
my experience had not been unusual.
When I asked what hashers joke
about to fight boredom, she said.
"The food, what else?"
In the dish room, I found the mood
was also jovial, in spite of the gener
ally disliked chore of scraping food
off the used dishes and silverware
before they are put through the dish
washer.
Sophomore Brian Ives explained
the complicated skills required for
dish room hashing.
He said that the Wilbur kitchen
uses carts to carry used trays out of
the dining rooms. In the dish room,
the hashers empty a tray at a time by
clearing and stacking similar utensils
and passing the stacks along.
"You try to think of more efficient
ways to get the stuff off," Ives said,
flipping a fork into the silverware tray
while slopping the ice out of a cup
and pigeonholing it in a cubicled tray
that carries glass safely.
His practiced combinations almost
distracted me from spotting a poor,
abandoned meal card on my own
tray. Ives took it from me as if he had
found gold and rushed off to turn it in
to the office. While he was on his
break, I managed to clear two more
trays without splattering myself
noticeably, almost catching up with
the veteran dish room hasher.
I was worried about speed because
every few minutes one of the full
time employees would walk through
chanting in a sing-song voice, "Hurry
up! I don't want to stay here all day."
I couldn't understand why Ives
kept chuckling at this until he ex
plained that it was a running joke to
rush each other into getting clumsy
enough to break something.
"You get a sort of satisfied feeling
when you break dishes â€” everyone
cheers," Ives said, flipping more Taco
Day remains into a trash can.
I almost felt like hashing again an
other day to experience this unique
feeling of celebrity . . . almost . . .


Sophomores Kristen Chalberg and Lisa Mills are two students here who
deal with Stanford Food Service from the other side. They are hashers

who know the tricks of the trade and can even have a good time as
they serve students their daily meals.
