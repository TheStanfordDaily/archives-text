## The 						Stanford Daily Remember the hungry 
### 
Next Tuesday is the annual fast for world
hunger at Stanford Food Service. Those of us
who are fasting will wake up still feeling the pizza
from the night before in our stomachs. We will
take a shower and go straight to classes. During
the day we may feel the empty pit in our
stomachs and some of us may cheat and get a
donut at Tresidder. By the time we go to sleep at
night the gurgling within us may keep us up, hut
we should feel good about what we have done to
help our fellow man.
Others in the world will go to bed hungry that
night, but they will not feel so good. They may
die because of it.
This year has been particularly devastating for
a number of East African and Asian countries.
Ethiopia is the nation that most people have been
hearing about. Many refuse to acknowledge such
a terrible happening in our day and age, but this
is a situation that must be dealt with. The prob
lem stems from the fact that Americans only have
contact with a wealthy, civilized society. Poverty
most certainly exists in America but is hidden
away so that we don't have to deal with it. Also,
for the most part, it doesn't even approach the
levels at which it is found in other areas of the
world.
Our idea of hunger has reached the point
where we think of a family without a Thanksgiv
ing turkey as being absolutely impoverished.
If it is possible, attempt to compare this scene
to one 360 miles north of the Ethiopian capital of
Addis Ababa. There the Red Cioss has set up a
camp for the victims of this year's famine. Cur
rently the camp is holding 35,000 people.
Visitors to the camp describe the inhabitants as
skeletons, reminiscent of World War II concen

tration camp inmates.
Each day the residents of the Red Cross camp
hope only for their ration of flour. They are too
weak to walk and flies settle on faces of people
too weak to brush them off.
Two weeks ago 90 to 100 people were dying in
the camp each day. Now that relief supplies have
started to come in from all over the world, espe
cially Europe, the numbers are down to 35 to 40
each day. But even more aid is needed. Workers
at the camp are afraid that interest and aid will
wane. They estimate that the country must con
tinue to receive the large shipments of food aid
until September 1985 if its people are to survive.
We cannot let the politics that have surrounded
the aid ruin the possibility of saving a number of
lives. It doesn't matter who is distributing the
food â€” the Ethiopians or the Red Cross. What
does matter is that the aid gets to the people that
are desperately in need of it.
Stanford students, like everyone, have a lim
ited amount they can afford to spend on charity.
It is important to think about how your important
donations will be used and whether your money
will be going to a cause that is truly the most im
perative one.
We must step up our efforts to aid Ethiopia
and the other countries that are falling to the
famine of 1984. We must rise above the
ridiculous nationalism that has given birth to the
idea that we should take care of our own first al
though they aren't the most needy.
We are citizens of the United States. But on a
more basic level, without the artificial divisions of
the state system, we live on the planet earth and
have a responsibility to help our fellow citizens.
