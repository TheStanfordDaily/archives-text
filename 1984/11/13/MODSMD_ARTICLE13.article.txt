Assault incident
t "
In reference to the Thursday night
-alleged assault incident, I felt a defi
nite need to voice some reaction. In
looking back at my "Stanford
; career," I have to admit my days of
frequenting" were limited to
my freshman year. I found many of
them, like most large hordes of
people who don't know each other,
to be more of a "meat market" than
a social gathering. This, however, is
not an outrage against frat parties. I
definitely had my share of fun, and I
have to declare that they were an
integral part of my first year at Stan
ford. I look back at these parties in
the same way I look back at my
all-freshman dorm. It was great! It
was fun! ... but never again.
! As I read about the alleged as
sault, I was not only shocked but was
also upset by some of my peers'
reactions. Although I admit I haven't
been to an open-house "frat bash" in
several years, I was angry and
surprised to hear one woman com
ment, "those frat guys are real
animals." I was furious when I heard
another comment, a male who I did
and still hope to respect, declare,
"Wow, those Beta guys sure know
how to throw a party." (Snicker,
snicker.)
My reactions to these comments
were of angry confusion. First of all,
the slur against "frat men" reeked of
stereotyping. It's not the fraternity
that is to be blamed. The blame lies
pn all those who stood around and
ignored the seriousness of the situa
tion — be they male or female.
As for the other remark, I still feel
furious. My very unwelcome
response of "that's just not funny"

made me feel like the stereotypical
humorless feminist. OK . . . I am a
feminist! OK ... I did react with
vehement indignation. But 1 can and
do laugh (quite a bit, I assure you)
when something is funny. However,
this was no joking matter.
The insensitivity of both of these
peer reactions clearly show ignor
ance. All frat men are not "animals"
all feminists are not humorless men
haters. These are merely stereotypes
which persist out of outright narrow
mindedness.
I am not condemning fraternities,
indignant women or insensitive
men. . . BUT I am outraged by
blatant ignorance. No matter what
happened that night, I feel there has
to be concern and awareness on
everyone's part. We are not talking
about an incident on the streets of
upper Manhattan. We're talking
about something which may have
happened on our campus. It is not a
joke. And, I seriously mean, it is not
to be taken lightly.

Being a freshman this year, I am
still not used to all of the acronyms
thrown about so casually by the
Stanford community. The article
entitled "Campus group accuses
STAR of violations" (The Daily,
Nov. 5) caught my attention.
STAR's operations seem question
able at best. Only a severely gullible
student body would believe that the
groups STAR, STAR-PAC and
STAR Coalition are completely
separate entities. The additives

"PAC" and "Coalition" are similar
to clever tax-dodging companies of a
large conglomerate, designed for no
other purpose than justifying ques
tionable activity. Steve
Silverman, STAR's leader, would be
grossly mistaken to feel his glib
explanations (which approach sheer
rudeness in the paragraph beginning,
"Steve Dauber and his cohorts
remind me of self-appointed
Keystone Cops") would be believed
by the Stanford student body.
Finishing the article, I felt unin
formed about organizations to
which the ASSU gives funds. As an
upperclassman answered my ques
tions, my jaw fell open in amaze
ment. How many freshmen know, 1
wonder, that part of their PTR pay
ment goes to the Gay and Lesbian
Alliance at Stanford and to the Stan
ford Progressive Alliance. It is rather
irritating to know my tuition is sup
porting organizations, such as
GLAS, that I, and I am sure many
other students, feel are immoral and
threatening to the well-being of
society itself.
I then asked if the College
Republicans got any money from the
ASSU. "NO!" came the answer,
"They are a partisan organization." I
was outraged. Who could say that
SPA, STAR and perhaps even
GLAS are non-partisan organiza
tions? I would be interested in statis
tics showing Republican vs.
Democratic registration in these
groups. In conclusion, it appears we
must have new rules governing stu
dent groups and must reassess our
values when voting for the groups to
which funds are allocated.

STAR's operations seem question
able at best. Only a severely gullible
student body would believe that the
groups STAR, STAR-PAC and
STAR Coalition are completely
separate entities. The additives

"PAC" and "Coalition" are similar
to clever tax-dodging companies of a
large conglomerate, designed for no
other purpose than justifying ques
tionable activity. Steve
Silverman, STAR's leader, would be
grossly mistaken to feel his glib
explanations (which approach sheer
rudeness in the paragraph beginning,
"Steve Dauber and his cohorts
remind me of self-appointed
Keystone Cops") would be believed
by the Stanford student body.
Finishing the article, I felt unin
formed about organizations to
which the ASSU gives funds. As an
upperclassman answered my ques
tions, my jaw fell open in amaze
ment. How many freshmen know, 1
wonder, that part of their PTR pay
ment goes to the Gay and Lesbian
Alliance at Stanford and to the Stan
ford Progressive Alliance. It is rather
irritating to know my tuition is sup
porting organizations, such as
GLAS, that I, and I am sure many
other students, feel are immoral and
threatening to the well-being of
society itself.
I then asked if the College
Republicans got any money from the
ASSU. "NO!" came the answer,
"They are a partisan organization." I
was outraged. Who could say that
SPA, STAR and perhaps even
GLAS are non-partisan organiza
tions? I would be interested in statis
tics showing Republican vs.
Democratic registration in these
groups. In conclusion, it appears we
must have new rules governing stu
dent groups and must reassess our
values when voting for the groups to
which funds are allocated.

Assault incident
t "
In reference to the Thursday night
-alleged assault incident, I felt a defi
nite need to voice some reaction. In
looking back at my "Stanford
; career," I have to admit my days of
frequenting" were limited to
my freshman year. I found many of
them, like most large hordes of
people who don't know each other,
to be more of a "meat market" than
a social gathering. This, however, is
not an outrage against frat parties. I
definitely had my share of fun, and I
have to declare that they were an
integral part of my first year at Stan
ford. I look back at these parties in
the same way I look back at my
all-freshman dorm. It was great! It
was fun! ... but never again.
! As I read about the alleged as
sault, I was not only shocked but was
also upset by some of my peers'
reactions. Although I admit I haven't
been to an open-house "frat bash" in
several years, I was angry and
surprised to hear one woman com
ment, "those frat guys are real
animals." I was furious when I heard
another comment, a male who I did
and still hope to respect, declare,
"Wow, those Beta guys sure know
how to throw a party." (Snicker,
snicker.)
My reactions to these comments
were of angry confusion. First of all,
the slur against "frat men" reeked of
stereotyping. It's not the fraternity
that is to be blamed. The blame lies
pn all those who stood around and
ignored the seriousness of the situa
tion — be they male or female.
As for the other remark, I still feel
furious. My very unwelcome
response of "that's just not funny"

made me feel like the stereotypical
humorless feminist. OK . . . I am a
feminist! OK ... I did react with
vehement indignation. But 1 can and
do laugh (quite a bit, I assure you)
when something is funny. However,
this was no joking matter.
The insensitivity of both of these
peer reactions clearly show ignor
ance. All frat men are not "animals"
all feminists are not humorless men
haters. These are merely stereotypes
which persist out of outright narrow
mindedness.
I am not condemning fraternities,
indignant women or insensitive
men. . . BUT I am outraged by
blatant ignorance. No matter what
happened that night, I feel there has
to be concern and awareness on
everyone's part. We are not talking
about an incident on the streets of
upper Manhattan. We're talking
about something which may have
happened on our campus. It is not a
joke. And, I seriously mean, it is not
to be taken lightly.

Funding questions
Being a freshman this year, I am
still not used to all of the acronyms
thrown about so casually by the
Stanford community. The article
entitled "Campus group accuses
STAR of violations" (The Daily,
Nov. 5) caught my attention.
STAR's operations seem question
able at best. Only a severely gullible
student body would believe that the
groups STAR, STAR-PAC and
