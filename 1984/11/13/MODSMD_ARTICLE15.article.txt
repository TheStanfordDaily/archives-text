## Man, mind and abortion 
### 
One of the biggest controversies facing us today is that
of abortion. What really needs to be discussed is the defi
nition of human, for this is the heart of the debate.
Let us examine the various arguments on this point.
Some pro-abortionists argue that fetuses are unable to
survive outside of the womb and so are not independent
living beings yet. This is not acceptable because premies
(premature babies) require extensive life support equip
ment and yet they are unarguably babies. The fact that the
life support equipment in the case of fetuses is a mother

VIEWPOINT

makes no difference. Siamese twins are quite intimately
connected yet they are still two people. They also say that
this is a private issue. So are infanticide and intra-family
murders.
Anti-abortion arguments also run into difficulties.
Some say that a fetus is a person from conception on. For
those whose religious beliefs dictate this stand, I would
like to point out that only half of all conceptions result in
births, the rest abort spontaneously. I seriously doubt that
God has condemned half of all souls without them even
being born. Perhaps they're recycled or something.
Others say that although a clump of a few cells cannot
really be called a person; it is a potential person. When a
fetus is aborted, a person will never see light and so it is a
murder. This stand requires unacceptable corollaries,
namely that every sperm and egg be immediately mated to
make sure every potential person becomes one or be
guilty or murder through absence of action. Two gametes
are just as much a potential person separated as they are
joined. Women from puberty on should be in a constant
state of pregnancy so as to make sure that every potential
person becomes one.
My argument will probably not immediately persuade
people who believe this. Why? Because both this and
abortion require active effort, not letting things go the
natural course of events. The problem is that the
"natural" course of events is not always the best and

doing nothing does not absolve one of responsibility to
decide; no decision is still a decision. If one believes in let
ting things go their "natural" route, that one should for
example only worry about "naturally" mated gametes,
one should also close all the hospitals and let the sick go
the "natural" route. So, how does one decide when a fetus
is a person?
Here is my proposal. The essential difference between
man and animals is his mind (or his soul if you will). The
physical manifestation of a mind is the brain. Thus, we
have a person if we have a brain. Let's take two unfortun
ate test subjects, Sam, a human, and Spot, an aardvark.
Now let us (using some mad scientist) switch their brains.
Who is now Sam and who is now Spot? The aardvark will
have quite a strong opinion on this subject. The human
will sit there and drool or something. Even though Sam's
body still looks the same it is no longer Sam; the aardvark
is.
I he first moral of this story is that looking like a human
does not make one a person. Ergo, the appearance of a
fetus means nothing. The second moral is that the deter
mining factor here is the brain. The cerebrum, the think
ing part, only starts working at birth, all else before is
reflex. Until the cerebrum starts working and developing
a mind, there is no difference between that baby and the
millions of clones that could be grown from hiin. That
gives either six months (when the synapses start forming)
or birth (when brain cells stop replicating and start
working), I m not sure which. Here's another point. When
a person s brainwave activity stops, she/he is considered
dead. The body can be supported indefinitely using
modern equipment, but once a brain goes it never comes
back. This is called clincial death. Therefore, is it not
reasonable to say that the definition of life begins as it
ends, based on brain activity? One could consider brain
activity as an indication of the presence of the soul, a holy
spirit, if one is religious and as an indication of what is
worth protecting in a human being, as what is infinitely
valuable and irreplaceable, if not.
