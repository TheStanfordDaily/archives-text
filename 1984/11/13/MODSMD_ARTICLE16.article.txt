## The
						myth of infallibility 
### 
We are numb to criticism. We do not want to
believe that our religion is wrong, even when
evidence condemns it. Blind faith in government,
however, will kill us. We, as a nation, are not neces
sarily good all of the time. Our ideals promote such
a desire, but ideals are not facts. They are standards
we approach. Our government is prone to error; we
are prone to error, but ii is our duty as the govern
ment to ensure that our representatives pursue our
ideals.
Deceit is not a virtue. When a government that
stands for peace allows manuals illustrating torture
and assassination to circulate, we must question the
motives and morals behind such inhumanity. When
a government abrogates freedom of the press and
invades a foreign country to build a military air
port. we must ask what it is we are not supposed to
see or hear.
And we must wonder what dark secrets still lay
shrouded in the Pentagonal catacombs.
As documents are slowly unearthed, we see that
the United States is not as pristine and holy as we
were led to believe. Our records are spotted with
blood. Questions marks and cadavers punctuate
our coded slabs.
The Korean Air Lines tragedy is just one of
many ghosts which haunts the U.S. government,
just one of many corpses that still needs to be
fleshed out. The murderous incident seemed
relatively simple: The Soviet Union cold-bloodedly
shot down a civilian airliner, killing its 269 pas
sengers because the plane inadvertantly strayed
into Soviet airspace. As year-long autopsies reveal
new evidence, however, the case is not as simple.
What once was an obvious murder commited by
the Soviet Union, is now a complex list of motives
and unanswered questions implicating to our dis
may the United States.
Why did neither the United States nor Japan

warn KAL Flight 007 of its incorrect flight pattern?
According to David Pearson, an authority on the
Defense Department's World Wide Military Com
mand and Control System, in his Aug. 18 article
published in The Nation, "the U.S. government
knew or should have known almost from the mo
ment the Korean Air Liner departed Anchorage,
Alaska, that the plane was off course and headed
toward sensitive Soviet military installations" over
the Kamchatka Peninsula and Sakhalin Island. "It
is unlikely," he continues, "that there was a simul
taneous failure of independent intelligence systems
operated by the Navy, Army, Air Force, National
Security Agency, CIA and the Japanese self
defense agency â€” all of which had the ability to
track Flight 007 at various stages of its journey
across the Pacific." Furthermore, he argues, it is
extremely improbable that "two pilots with nearly
20,000 flying hours between them not only made
an error in setting the automatic pilot but sat in the
cockpit for five hours, facing the autopilot selector
switch directly in front of them at eye level, yet
failed to see that it was set improperly. Nor did they
use radar and other systems available to check their
course and position."
So why did Flight 007 stray into Soviet airspace?
Tom Wicker, columnist for The New York Times,
writes that "a flight over Kamchatka Peninsula and
Sakhalin Island activated Soviet radar and air
defenses, yielding 'a bonanza' of intelligence infor
mation to watching and listening U.S. electronic
defenses." The Kamchatka Peninsula, according to
the Associated Press, "is a target test site for Soviet
land-based nuclear missiles." A.P. contends that
"U.S. satellites had spotted Soviet preparations to
test-fire a new missile the night the plane was shot
down. That night, the U.S. had its monitoring
equipment at lull power to learn what it could
about the new missiles."

According to Wicker, Pearson also presents sub
stantial evidence that Soviet radar detection and
communications systems were being jammed that
night. He also reconstructs electronic evidence to
show that the airliner changed course slightly after
passing near a U.S. RC-135 reconnaissance plane;
otherwise it would have crossed Sakhalin far north
of the point where a Soviet fighter finally shot it
down.
We also know that the U.S. Navy operated an in
telligence ship, the Observation Island, that night
in the Pacific Ocean, that the Pentagon revealed
that the RC-135 spy plane had passed only 75
miles from the KAL plane and that according to
Secretary of State George Shultz, the pursuit of
Flight 007 by the Soviet fighters was monitored by
U.S. and Japanese eavesdroppers.
So why were we able to monitor the pursuit of
the Korean airliner and not its prior course? Why
did former President Richard Nixon change his
reservations on Flight 007 to one with a later
departure time? Why were all of the intelligence
systems available to the United States unable to
track and warn the KAL? Why were Soviet radar
detection and communications systems being
jammed that evening? Unfortunately, we cannot
conclude anything from the given evidence. We can
infer possibilities, but we should not judge in ignor
ance. Conjecture is weak. These questions should,
however, throw doubts on our belief in an infallible
government. We cannot accept pretty phrases and
spoon-fed dogma as the truth just because papa
says so. Different angles yield different
perspectives and different biases. Terror is not vio
lence or fear; it is ignorance. Terror is not double
think, but nothink.
