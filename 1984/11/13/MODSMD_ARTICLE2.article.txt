# Med trial opens
## Culminates decade of controversy 
### BAIE NETZER Senior staff writer 
An associate professor in the School of
Medicine and the University will go to trial
today in a lawsuit that culminates a decade of
accusations.
Medical School Associate Prof. Eugene Dong
filed suit in 1979, claiming University officials
denied him promotion because of a 1973 inci
dent in which he accused another associate pro
fessor of falsifying publicly-funded research.
The case is scheduled to reach the Santa
Clara County Superior Court in San Jose today.
According to a report Sunday by the San Jose
Mercury News, Dong is suing the University for
$1 million in damages and is demanding
$100,000 from individual defendants.
University Chief Counsel John Schwartz,
former Medical School Dean Clayton Rich, and
James Mark, former chairman of the Depart
ment of Surgery, are among the defendants in
the case.
According to the Mercury News report. Dong
told reporters he would like to use the trial to
examine how universities should handle accusa
tions of fraudulent research.
Dong's attorney subpoenaed The Daily for a
series of articles appearing from 1977 to 1979
that covered Dong's accusations that then-
Associate Medical School Prof. Zoltan Lucas
had falsified research funded by the National
Institute of Health (NIH).
In 1979, former University President Richard
Lyman suspended Lucas for 12 weeks and
issued a public reprimand, but Dong says a
1978 letter from Lucas to Rich that claims
Dong's "avid hunger for publicity can be inter

preted as violating good scientific practices"
libeled him and hurt his reputation, the Mercury
News reported.
Attorney David Heilbron, who is represent
ing Rich, Mark and Schwartz, said he is hesis
tant to discuss the trial and expressed concern
that the report appearing in Sunday's Mercury
News might upset the jury selection process.
Heilbron reportedly told the Mercury News
that the University will argue Dong hasn't been
promoted "because he really hasn't done much
teaching or research or clinical work in car
diovascular surgery" for seven years.
Heilbron said he expects each side to have
significant opening statements but did not ex
pect these statements to be read today.
"I don't know about them, but we plan to in
troduce a pre-trial motion on what kinds of
evidence should be admitted and that will take
up most of the day,"he said.
Heilbron estimated jury selection to begin on
Wednesday "at the earliest."
In 1973, Dong accused Lucas of falsifying re
search on kidney transplants in rats. Lucas was
working under NIH grants to the University.
While a 1974 faculty committee took no ac
tion on Dong's accusations, a 1975 follow-up
investigation recommended another hearing
and said "some of the work may in fact have
been fraudulent."
Nothing was done, however, until 1977, when
another University committee considered the
accusations, and the FBI and the NIH also
began investigations. Lucas then admitted that
papers submitted for publication and for grants
