## 'Old Times' insightful, engrossing 
### MARC FAJER 
The American Conservatory
Theatre opened its 19th season last
Tuesday night with a fascinating and
beautifully staged production of
Harold Pinter's "Old Times" at the
Geary Theatre in San Francisco.
William Ball, general director of the
company (directing his first ACT pro
duction in four seasons), has
recreated the complicated world of
the play with a precise and almost
balletic staging that is insightful and
engrossing to watch.
It is probably necessary to admit at
the outset that I haven't ever seen
Pinter staged before, and certainly
part of the intrigue of the production
for me was to see the effect real
performers and real pauses had on

Silence is used as
a magnifying glass
to explore the
depth of feelings
experienced by
the actors.

my understanding of what was going
on. Yet I have a strong sense that this
staging was somehow "right"; though
there were a few moments when the
production dragged, in general, I sat
totally involved in the complexity of
the unfolding plot, the painful games
that the characters played, and the
use of silence as a magnifying glass to
explore the depth of the feelings the
actors were experiencing.
"Old Times" is about the reactions
of a married couple to a visit from the
wife's old roommate. The roommate,
Anna (played by Deborah May), and

the husband, Deeley (George Deloy),
both flirt with each other and engage
in a sort of rivalry for control of the
wife, Katie (Barbara Dirickson). As
the play progresses, the characters
reminisce about the past, though, as
Anna points out, some of the things
people remember never happened at
all. The heart of the play is the effect
of the games and storytelling on the
characters. Because of the careful
staging and fine stylized acting, these
effects are complex and intriguing.
Dirickson is marvelous as the shy
and pained Katie. She can convey so
much just staring into space that I
found my eyes drawn to her even
when the others were talking. For
most of the play she appears very vul
nerable, yet the hints of inner
strength that shine through intermit
tently give depth to both the charac
ter and the play. Deborah May is
properly seductive and mysterious as
Anna. She has a wonderful feline sen
suality that easily explains why both
Katie and her husband are hyp
notized by her.
The two women spend much of this
production shadowing and mirroring
each other's movements. This, I
suppose, is to allow us to feel the
closeness between them and to un
derstand the sense of conspiracy that
the unfortunate husband feels by the
end of the play. This technique works
rather well, especially as the two wo
men are so beautiful to watch as they
move gracefully through the show.
This shadow effect is heightened by
Katherine Kraft's costuming; in the
first act the two women wear the
same dress, though Katie's is a much
darker version of the flaming red
that Anna wears.
George Deloy, as Deeley, is less
consistent than the two women.
There is a consistent choice made to
have him deliver lines in strange
ways, often shouting or stuffing sen
tences with long pauses. This choice

works much of the time, but occa
sionally one of these highly stylized
sentences rings very false, or worse,
confused. He is at his best when being
soft and seductive with one of the wo
men, and he is quite good at convey
ing the hurt confusion as he begins to

understand the unfolding past.
The very stylized staging had its
faults. There were certainly moments
that seemed overdone and several
stretches that dragged. Yet overall,"
Ball's decisions as to how to present
"Old Times" work very well. The

rather opaque plot was made con
siderably more understandable than
might have been the case. The pro
duction left an overall impression of
presenting the subtext behind some
other, more superficial set of con
versations that must have been taking

place somewhere else on top of
Pinter's often terse dialogue.
All in all, "Old Times" was a fasci
nating production well worth seeing.

and pained Katie. She can convey so
much just staring into space that I
found my eyes drawn to her even
when the others were talking. For
most of the play she appears very vul
nerable, yet the hints of inner
strength that shine through intermit
tently give depth to both the charac
ter and the play. Deborah May is
properly seductive and mysterious as
Anna. She has a wonderful feline sen
suality that easily explains why both
Katie and her husband are hyp
notized by her.
The two women spend much of this
production shadowing and mirroring
each other's movements. This, I
suppose, is to allow us to feel the
closeness between them and to un
derstand the sense of conspiracy that
the unfortunate husband feels by the
end of the play. This technique works
rather well, especially as the two wo
men are so beautiful to watch as they
move gracefully through the show.
This shadow effect is heightened by
Katherine Kraft's costuming; in the
first act the two women wear the
same dress, though Katie's is a much
darker version of the flaming red
that Anna wears.
George Deloy, as Deeley, is less
consistent than the two women.
There is a consistent choice made to
have him deliver lines in strange
ways, often shouting or stuffing sen
tences with long pauses. This choice

works much of the time, but occa
sionally one of these highly stylized
sentences rings very false, or worse,
confused. He is at his best when being
soft and seductive with one of the wo
men, and he is quite good at convey
ing the hurt confusion as he begins to

understand the unfolding past.
The very stylized staging had its
faults. There were certainly moments
that seemed overdone and several
stretches that dragged. Yet overall,"
Ball's decisions as to how to present
"Old Times" work very well. The

rather opaque plot was made con
siderably more understandable than
might have been the case. The pro
duction left an overall impression of
presenting the subtext behind some
other, more superficial set of con
versations that must have been taking

place somewhere else on top of
Pinter's often terse dialogue.
All in all, "Old Times" was a fasci
nating production well worth seeing.
It plays in repertory at the Geary
Theatre in San Francisco through
Nov. 30.


Barbara Dirickson and Deborah May are seen as old friends whose reunion is fraught with unexpected tensions in "Old Times."
