# Audio-visual 'Riptides' fascinating
## 
### KARY ANTHOLIS 
While the large for-profit theaters in the Bay Area nec
essarily present shows with mass appeal, there are
numerous smaller theaters that are committed to sus
taining dramatic experiment and creativity. The Magic in
San Francisco is one such theater, and its current produc
tion of Soon 3's "Outcall/Riptides" exemplifies the
benefits of such a commitment.
Soon 3 is a small production company guided by Alan
Finneran. Finneran has spent the past 15 years ex
perimenting with the interaction between machines and
theater. In the early 1970s he unveiled his Cinema
Sculpture, which studied man as he deals with the audio
and visual arts. His Cinema Sculpture evolved into the
Performance Landscape, in which audio-visual art forms
become characters in human drama. The result is a
theater of design where each medium is manipulated to
make a distinct impression on the viewer.
Finneran's latest production is "Outcall/Riptides." The
professed aim of the piece is to use the Performance
Landscape to "probe our perceptions of reality." In
"Outcall/Riptides," the actors appear to move from the
stage into film scenes. Taped voices are mixed with live
ones. Sincere dramatic exchanges are intentionally trans
formed into cliches. All of these effects come together to
form a fascinating piece of audio-visual design.
The plot of "Outcall/Riptides" revolves around the re
lationship among a man, a woman and the audio-visual
technology that surrounds them. Marina (Karin Epper
lein), a singer, finds five cans of film buried at sea. Her
finding is filmed by Faro (Stephen Rappaport), a
lighthouse attendant who becomes infatuated with
Marina.
In the first scene we view his film of Marina's discovery,
and we hear both characters' memories of Faro approach
ing Marina. The lighthouse attendant, we learn, has
invited the woman to view the discovered films in the
lighthouse. As the film ends both characters appear center
stage. Marina is dressed in a fishnet top and a bikini bot

torn; Faro is wearing a tank top and slacks. They engage in
a sexually-suggestive dance, as we wonder whether this is
reality or fantasy. The dance sets the libidinous tone
which underlies the games that Marina and Faro proceed
to play with each other.
When they begin viewing the discovered films, we see
black and white footage of Flildegard von Kino (Bean
Finneran), a singer from the '30s. Kino becomes a catalyst
in the psycho-sexual struggle between Marina and Faro.
First she telephones Marina and later invites her to enter
the film.
When Marina entertains thoughts of giving up the
game, Kino offers her the stylish sexuality which has been
captured in the discovered films. Marina accepts and uses
Kino's style as a weapon.
Such calculated interaction between reality and audio
visual fantasy makes Finneran's production captivating.
Van Hardy's cinematography captures the stylish glamour
which Kino offers Marina. Bob Davis enhances the tense,
fantastic feeling of the piece with an exciting musical
score, and the interaction of audio and video is skillfully
directed by Ray Myslewski's crew.
Acting in such a piece requires a consistent clarity of in
tent. Without it the character is overshadowed by the
technical effects. The production is spotty here. At times
it is unclear whether Rappaport and Epperlein are toying
with dramatic cliches or simply overplaying a dramatic
moment.
When Marina declares her determination to "win the
game," Epperlein only slightly overplays the scene. The
declaration is too exaggerated to be dramatic, yet not
enough so to seem an intentional caricature of the mo
ment. The audience is left with Bean Finneran's haunting
voice and an unclear idea of how Marina has reacted.
Ultimately such instances are insignificant and do not
detract from the overall merit of Alan Finneran's piece.
Finneran is a creative, intelligent writer and director, and
"Outcall/Riptides" is a manifestation of his considerable
conceptual talent.


Karin Epperlein and Stephen Rappaport play a scene from Soon 3's "Outcall/Riptides," where past and
present, film and theater, fantasy and reality fuse to tell the story. At Magic Theatre through Dec. 16.
