'Comfort and Joy'
Bill Forsyth's new comedy
"Comfort and Joy," set in Glasgow at
Christmas time, has a classic opening
sequence. A beautiful woman
(Eleanor David) strolls through a de
partment store, slipping a variety of
items into her bag, while a man (Bill
Paterson) scrutinizes her and follows
her at a discreet distance. We assume
that he's the store detective and wait
for him to apprehend her, but once
outside the store they hop into the
same car and she shows him her take,
which includes a pile of T-shirts she
lifted for him; these characters —
Maddy and Alan — are, we realize,
lovers. When it turns out that the T
shirts are all the wrong size, she tosses
them nonchalantly out onto the road,
and he castigates her for her imprac
ticality in stealing ill-fitting T-shirts
when what they really need are
onions.
At home, they assemble the
Christmas tree decorations, inter
rupting their holiday preparations to
make love. (When they kiss, the
Christmas lights, which he has
wrapped himself up in, blink on and
off.) Afterwards, Maddy swirls her
hair in a bun, making her look sexily
lopsided, and starts to pack up, ex
plaining to Alan in a matter-of-fact
voice that she's leaving him. "I
wanted to tell you ages ago," she
says, "but the moment didn't arise"
— as if she had neglected to mention
a new restaurant she wanted to try.
When, shocked, he begs her to talk
things over, she censures him: " Don't
let's drag it out, Alan. Don't be
cruel." And she walks out on the
befuddled man, leaving his apartment
quite bare because, after all, she'd
furnished it with the loot from her
shoplifting adventures.
Bill Forsyth has really invented a
new sub-genre of comedy in "Local
Hero" and "Comfort and Joy"
("Gregory's Girl," which preceded
"Local Hero," can be seen as a kind
of dry run for what was to follow) —
an ironic comedy of manners so un
derstated it's practically submerged,
with the double take as its standard.
He may be the most distinctive comic
writer/director since Preston Sturges,
and "Comfort and Joy" is his
"Christmas in July" — a minor com
edy but a perfectly charming one.
(The opening is actually reminiscent
of the way the 1937 "Easy Living,"
which had a Sturges script, began.)
Forsyth is as serene as Sturges was
manic, but they share a vision of the
world as an immense madhouse. In
Forsyth's movies, the difference be
tween the heroes (like Alan, and the
Peter Riegert and Burt Lancaster fig
ures in "Local Hero") and the char
acters who brand them as lunatics
(Lancaster's psychiatrist in "Local
Hero," Alan's boss Hilary) is that
those whose credentials or position
permits them to decide on the sanity
of others are more unpleasantly and
anti-socially crazy than anyone else.
This isn't a novel idea, really, but I
doubt that anyone has ever illustrated
it so delightfully — at least, on the
screen.
After Maddy, who is a sort of fairy
sprite with an undefeatable internal
logic, leaves Alan (and the picture,
unfortunately), Forsyth settles down
to the real story of "Comfort and
Joy." Alan is a disc jockey at a local

radio station (his professional
moniker is "Dicky Bird"), but
Maddy's departure has left him
feeling so depressed, and so dis
satisfied with his life, that he hankers
to move into a more serious lane in
radio announcing: He wants to be a
reporter. And, happening upon the
trashing of an ice cream wagon by a
pair of thugs, he thinks he's found his
story, though he can't get Hilary
(Rikki Fulton, who has an un
balanced smile — one side of his
mouth climbs farther up his face than
the other) to believe he's not just
cracking under the strain of the
break-up with Maddy. But he follows
up on the incident on his own, and
finds himself the middleman in a war
between rival ice cream vendors,
Bunny (Alex Norton) and Mr.
McCool (Roberto Bernardi), which
Forsyth stages as a straight-faced
spoof on gangland melodramas. (Mr.
McCool is Italian, and his son Bruno,
played by George Rossi, translates
his passionate speeches into English,
which he speaks with a Scottish ac
cent and almost no emotional inflec
tion at all.)
"Comfort and Joy" isn't really in
the same class as "Local Hero"; it's
not as magnificent to look at, or as
magical, except in a few bits, and
there are a few letdowns in it — the
odd sentimental moment, the fact
that Mark Knopfler, who wrote the
lovely music for "Local Hero," has
relied on recycled snatches of his
songs for Dire Straits' "Love Over
Gold" album to fill in the soundtrack
of this picture. (That won't be a prob
lem for viewers unfamiliar with Dire
Straits, because the music he has ap
propriated — especially the riff that
introduces "Telegraph Road," the
first song on "Love Over Gold" — is
superb.) But if "Comfort and Joy"
doesn't represent Forsyth absolutely
at the top of his form, still it's a small
treasure, ideally cast and full of out
rageous aural jokes delivered with
Forsyth's customary bone-dryness.
Furthermore, in its muted, unam
bitious way, it does for commercial
radio approximately what Coinden
and Green did for other entertain
ment media in the 1950s (Hollywood
in "Singin' in the Rain," Broadway in
"The Band Wagon," television in
"It's Always Fair Weather") — make
it look very silly and funny, like
small-time lunacy, so that you think,
what a bizarre occupation for a
grown-up. Bill Forsyth has a wonder
ful way of exposing the craziness in
the world without devaluing it.
'Choose Me'
When Alan Rudolph made his first
movie, "Welcome to L.A.," in 1977,
Robert Altman produced it; an
Altman protege — he had written the
screenplay for Altman's "Buffalo Bill
and the Indians" the year before —
he tended toward the kind of offbeat,
layered group study his mentor had
brought off in movies like "The Long
Goodbye" and "Nashville." But
Rudolph didn't have the tempera
ment to carry off an Altman imita
tion. In "Welcome to L.A.a thick,
druggy lethargy substituted for
lyricism, and where Altman had
made abrupt shifts in tone and emo
tional nuance seem like miraculous
accidents, Rudolph reined everything
in — it felt as if the actors could
hardly breathe. I stopped going to see
Rudolph's movies for a while after
"Welcome to L.A." and his joyless

attempt at a comic odyssey,
"Roadie." (His subsequent pictures,
"Remember My Name" and
"Endangered Species," opened and
closed so fast that it was easier to skip
them than to seek them out.) And so
I found his new "Choose Me," star
ring Keith Carradine, Genevieve
Bujold, Lesley Ann Warren, Rae
Dawn Chong and Patrick Bauchau, a
lovely surprise. In this wholly uncon
ventional comedy about sex, romance
and the mystery of identity, Rudolph
has found his style; probably no other
writer/director could have concocted
it.
The picture starts with a carefully
underlit set piece of hookers cruising
a side street outside a bar called Eve's
Lounge, with Lesley Ann Warren
(who plays Eve) making a
choreographed entrance among
them, handbag and cigarette poised
to point up her sexual knowingness,
while Teddy Pendergrass's sultry
slow-dance title song plays on the
soundtrack. And you think you're in
trouble. This exterior is obviously a
mock-up, and Rudolph's camera
caresses it the way Francis Ford Cop
pola caressed his studio sets in "One
from the Heart" and Jean-Jacques
Beineix underscored his in "The
Moon in the Gutter" — two movies I
wouldn't care to sit through again. In
fact, "Choose Me" is full of the kind
of self-conscious stylishness that
smothered those two pictures, and it's
full of the angst of worldly, sex
drenched beautiful people like
"Welcome to L.A." was, and it has its
share of enigmatic inward dialogue,
too. ("I'm entering a knowing phase
now," one character tells her thera
pist, "and I know how easily desire
can turn to deed.") The difference
lies in Rudolph's tone, which in
"Choose Me" is playful and sly. Time
and time again as we watch this film,
we hear dismaying patches of dreary
self-confessional that flatten out the
action, and then Rudolph introduces
a single element — an unexpectedly
down-to-earth reply from another

character, or a witty cut (Mia
Goldman did the fine editing) — that
sends a ripple of laughter backwards
through the scene we've just wit
nessed.
In "Welcome to L.A.," Rudolph's
control pressed the life out of the
encounters between characters we
were obviously meant to find endear
ingly neurotic, and I walked away
thinking it was the director who was
neurotic (and narcissistic). In
"Choose Me," Rudolph has learned
to use his austere control for comic
purposes, to suck the audience in and
then release and relax us. The night I
saw the film, the audience had a
howling good time being taken; they
laughed appreciatively every time
Rudolph pulled the camera back and
tipped his hand.
"Choose Me" operates like a
Feydeau farce played at reduced
speed by a spacey cast. All the char
acters are moored at Eve's Lounge:
Eve; Ann (Bujold), her new
housemate; Zack (Bauchau), her
married lover; Rita (Chong), who sits,
at the bar and recites the (dreadful)
poetry she's written; and Mickey
(Carradine), who comes around in
search of an old friend, the original
owner of the bar (now dead), and
stays. Sex hangs in the air at Eve's,
where every glance between two
characters suggests a romantic con
nection made or possible, recognized
or rejected, and Rudolph lets us un
derstand right at the beginning that
the characters have links to each
other even they don't know about.
Eve habitually calls up a radio per
sonality named Dr. Nancy Love, who
gives "love line" advice to her lis
teners; Dr. Love is in reality Ann's al
ter ego. Rita frequents the bar be
cause Eve has been sleeping with her
husband, Zack, and she wants to
catch them together. Zack falls in
love with Ann when he speaks to her
on the phone (at Eve's apartment),
and she gives him the same kind of
sympathetic attention Dr. Love offers
to her callers on the air. Mickey

becomes involved with each of the
three women. Having lost a sizable
amount of cash to Mickey in a poker
game, Zack has expressed his distaste
for the young stranger — and now he
seems to trip over him every time he
opens a door.
With the assistance of his able crew
of actors, Rudolph keeps the roun
delay spinning. At times the film
resembles the Jonathan Demme-Paul
Brickman comedy "Citizens Band,"
in which all the inhabitants of a small
community ghost crazy lives behind
the CB handles they assume, and at
times the structure reminds you of
"Shampoo" (probably the best sex
farce ever made by Americans), but it
has a sensibility and rhythm all its
own. The depiction of Mickey, who
describes himself variously as a twice
divorced pilot, a mechanic, a Yale
Review poet and a secret agent, un
raveling seemingly contradictory
tales with a casualness that provides
us with constant entertainment, may
derive from an enchanting one-act
by John Guare called "The
Liveliest Afternoon of the Year."
one point Mickey looks Eve
straight in the eye and says, "I'm a
pathological liar. I make everything
up — except this.") Keith Carradine,
with his wide, predatory eyes and his
hair slicked back in a vaguely New
Wave look, reads his lines in a
clipped, slightly rancid style, and he
gets a laugh on almost every one. I
think — though I'm not sure — that
the key to his timing lies in the length
of the delay before he speaks. In any
case, it's his freshest performance
since he played the sexually insatiable
rock star in "Nashville" close to a de
cade ago. (Rudolph works in a nod to
"Nashville" in a post-coital exchange
between Carradine and Bujold. She
stands at the mirror putting on her
jewelry while he lounges in bed — the
exact positions Carradine and Lily
Tomlin took in Altman's movie
before she walked out of his life
forever.)
As Ann/Nancy, Genevieve Bujold

begins with a sexy, deep-voiced calm,
and even when her manic edge cuts
through her veneer of perfect self
control, she never falls apart; she just
accelerates her energy level. It's a
deliriously funny piece of acting, and
Bujold's wholecloth neuroticism as
Ann perfectly balances Lesley Ann
Warren's trembly neuroticism as Eve.
Warren has never been a favorite of
mine — I could barely stand to watch
her in "Victor/Victoria" — but she
works well in Rudolph's scheme, and
it's a relief to see her shot so flatter
ingly. (I thought she had excellent
grounds for suing Blake Edwards for
the way he made her look in
"Victor/Victoria.") Rae Dawn Chong
brings her goofy elegance and
warmth and sharp-eyed-little-girl
canniness to the role of Rita, and as
Zack, the brutal womanizer, Patrick
Bauchau rings a few changes on the
Gallic charmers of an earlier era.
Actually, the whole movie looks
back to other eras, but with a parodic
verve that is specifically Alan
Rudolph's contribution. In a way,
"Choose Me," with its singles bar
encounters, is like a 1980s distanced
view of the preoccupations of the
1970s — a post-"Goodbar" joke.
The posters on the wall in Rita's
apartment are of Hollywood
melodramas of the '30s, '40s and '50s
(and if you read them in sequence,
they comment on the narrative), and
the last scene of the movie is a bril
liant extension on the famous final se
quence of "The Graduate," a signal
film of the '60s generation. Rudolph
knows exactly what he's doing, and he
does it with amazing economy. That's
why he can call up (late in the film)
the recurring image from "Moon in
the Gutter" of the poster promising a
better life to soda drinkers, and not
make us cringe; he doesn't get carried
away as Beineix did, as Coppola has
in his last three fiascoes. Rather than
going for self-seriousness, "Choose
Me" reminds us that artifice and style
can (and should) be devices for enter
taining an audience.
