## Kees: a place on the margin of literature 
### ROBERT BASIL 
The Ceremony and other stories"
By Weldon Kees
Graywolf Press, $6.00
Weldon Kees has made a reputation for himself, post
humously, as a figure on the margin. Admired mainly for
his poetry, Kees also made films, painted (sharing an ex
hibition with De Kooning), played jazz piano, was a
reviewer for Time magazine and, in his early years, wrote
several short stories. In most of these fields Kees gained
what one would call 112 ivorable notice, but he never gained
fame.
His poems, on first glance, have the tough wry texture
of W.H. Auden's, and his voice also resembles that of 7 .S.
Eliot's isolated, alienated personae. So in the 1 9505, when
Auden- and Eliot- imitators were being plowed off the
stage by the Beat and Black Mountain Show, Kees

received zip in the way of attention. But Kees was more
than just another clone of a tradition it became popular to
disdain; his verse has a wicked and jazzy, compressed and
frenetic voice that is as new and original today as it was
when he first wrote it.
In fact, Kees escaped from New York and its academic
establishment. He came to San Francisco and befriended
the Lord of its "Poetry Renaissance," Kenneth Rexroth.
Here, he wrote his greatest poems and lived, Rexroth has
said, "in a permanent and hopeless apocalypse." Here
too, Kees performed the act for which, luridly, he is per
haps most famous; he parked his car by the Golden Gate
Bridge, and nobody ever found a trace of him. He was 41.
Until recently, Kees' legacy has consisted of a skinny
edition of his collected poems. Now, however, Dan Goia
(an ex-editor of Sequoia, the Stanford literary journal)
has brought together 14 of Kees' best stories into a
needed book. Goia does a good editing job, but he can
only confirm Kees' place on the margin of our literary
heritage, because Kees wrote all of his stories while he
was in his 20s, and none of them are great.

It's odd to finally get to read these stories. They seem
imitative — but imitative of writers who were working
either at the same time Kees was or who made their
reputations long after his death. For example, his early
stories, written in the '30s, sound as though they were writ
ten by someone studying Nathaniel West. Kees shares
West's cruelly perfect transcription of the dialogue of the
inept characters he portrays. But next to West's, Kees'
stories look like building blocks for a novel he hasn't
learned how to cement together yet.
Similarly, Douglas Woolf, whose satiric masterpiece is
"Fade Out," surely must have read some of Kees' stories
as they came out in magazines. He rewrites many of Kees'
routines, but he rewrites them better. These days,
Raymond Carver is the most famous inhabitant of the
stylistic and sociological terrain Kees lived in — but in
scenes where we know Kees was aiming for an effect of
spareness, we also know that Carver can pare them more
brilliantly.
Kees worked within a simple, nonsentimental world
view: The only enlightenment one can hope for is to wit
ness how hopeless all endeavor is. Kees wasn't searching
for ecstasy. He would have settled for some small waning
of his existential embarrassment.
In his title story, he depicts a guy who runs a civil engi
neering outfit. The workers, digging the foundation of a
new building, slam into the ossified remains of Indians
buried on their sacred ground. The boss doesn't give a
hoot and demands that the digging continue. "And break
them up good," he says.
In "Mrs. Lutz," an owner of a diner in a small Midwest
ern town is annoyed that one of her waitresses has forgot
ten to give "Table No. 11" an ashtray. When "Table No.
11" leaves a quarter tip, the owner sneaks it into her
pocket when the waitress isn't looking, exacting her
proper retribution.
This collection's best story is called "Farewell to Frog
nail." It is also the final story Kees wrote, about a man
whose life is so pressingly malignant that he decides to
join the Army on the slim chance that he, as an intellec
tual, may be given a soft non-combat job. "Frognall" has
a kind of bumpy and high-energy language that is lacking
in most of the other stories. Its voice is closer to the one
found in Kees' poems. Still, despite its relative success, I
suspect that Kees abandoned it as a fragment, and with it
his efforts in the short-story form. For the final ten years
of his life, he stuck to short lyrics.
That's too bad, because he was just getting going. He
finished his short stories and himself too damn soon.
