### LISA LYNCH 
"Superior Women"
By Alice Adams
Knopf, $16.95
The year is 1942. The place,
Radcliffe College. Enter Meg, Peg,
Lavinia, Cathy and Janet, five deter
mined, intelligent and reasonably in
teresting Radcliffe freshwomen.
"Superior Women," the fifth novel
by noted suburban storyteller Alice
Adams, is a journey over 40 years

and 400 pages through the
lives of these five women. Their con
frontations with death, divorce, de- |
pression and a subdued, diluted ver
sion of the political climate of the
19405, '50s, '60s and '70s are paraded
before us. In the end we are left with
four much older women, the ghosts of
dozens of secondary characters, and a
sense that there is something missing
in Adams' work — or at least in the
lives of the women she has called su
perior.

I like Adams' short stories. In col
lections such as "Beautiful Girl" and
"To See You Again," Adams takes
an omniscient, God-like look at con
temporary culture. She has a unique
way of telling everyone's story at
once — the reader hears the unsaid
words of the alcoholic father and his
lesbian daughter — both the unfaith
ful wife and the guileless husband are
laid open under Adams' eye.
This technique is effective in
shorter works, where we are com
fortable with Adams as a "tour
guide" through the universe she
wishes to share with us. But in a full
length novel, Adams' distance from
her characters begins to wear thin.
"Superior Women" is mostly the
story of Megan Greene, a dumpy and
brilliant girl from the prosaic depths
of Palo Alto, who chooses to
go to Radcliffe for sexual rather
than scholastic reasons; her first lover,
whom she meets in the aisles of the
Stanford Bookstore, is a Harvard
man. At Radcliffe, Megan makes four
more or less intimate friends —
Lavinia, a Southern belle; bitter
Janet; shy, shy Cathy; and lumpy,
maternal Peg.
After she leaves school, a thinner
and successful publishing-house exec
utive, Megan keeps in close contact
with her friends. But although they
appear frequently to vie for our at
tention, we are constantly reminded
that this is Megan's story. Not that it
is told from her point of view;
"Superior Women" is omniscient
narration pushed to the limit. Adams
guides us through all five lives with a
gentle but viselike grip on our imag
ination. We are told not only what
the characters do and think, but what
it means, on the larger cosmic plane
of things, when they do or think the
things they do.
Megan emerges as the center of the
novel because she is the most reflec

tive of any of the characters — she is
given the opportunity to muse about
all of the major episodes in her
friends' lives — and each friend in
turn undergoes a "crisis" that seems
to be a necessary rite of passage on
the road to superior womanhood.
This series of crises — or crosses —
that befall Megan and her friends is
disturbing. Each of the characters is
doomed to an aberration, internal or
external, of the very thing for which
she stands. The beautiful Lavinia has
a hideous child, the pious Cathy has
an affair with a priest. But these ex
periences bring us no closer to them
as characters and indeed bring them
no closer to an understanding of
themselves. They are merely bad
things happening to "good" people.
It is unclear, then, why these wo

men must undergo such trials. It
would be simple to blame a
malevolent God were not Adams the
omnipotent God of all of her charac
ters. The five friends are so con
trolled, their situations so calculated,
that we begin looking for a design.
The design of this book is perhaps
indicated by Adams' title. "Superior
Woman" is a disturbing, albiet com
pelling, title for a book about five
very human and often lonely, inse
cure, unstable and uninspired wo
men. The obvious question arises. To
whom are they supposed to be super
ior? What makes them superior, aside
from a fair amount of intelligence?
Indeed, the strongest element of su
periority in the novel stems from
Adams herself; as a distant narrator
she is making herself superior to her

characters by holding herself above
them and looking down from a consi
derable distance. She becomes a dif
ferent sort of superior woman — one
that the reader is aware of more as a
presence than as a confidante.
In the middle of the novel, Janet's
sometime-husband Adam Marr tells
Megan: "You superior women have a
real problem for yourselves, don't
you? . . . Just any old guy won't do —
you wouldn't like him, and even if
you did, your strength would scare
him. What you need is a hero."
Is Adams saying that it is danger
ous to be a "superior woman"? If one
is a woman and intelligent, strong, or
just perceptive, is one destined to suf
fer the fates of Megan, Peg, Cathy,
Janet and Lavinia?
The novel raises a host of questions
about the role of the strong woman in
today's society — questions,
however, that though stated are not
addressed. This would not be a prob
lem if the women in this novel didn't
seem as though they ought to be sym
bolic. But they do, and one gets the
impression that they are symbols with
nothing to symbolize.
"Superior Women" is certainly
readable, at least at first, when we are
immersed in cheerful descriptions of
Megan's early sexual exploits and
Lavinia's lace underthings. But after
400 pages, the reader and Adams
are still quite distant from the
friends, and we begin to wonder why,
after all, we are supposed to care
about them. Perhaps Adams will flesh
out one or two of the five characters
in stories or a later novel. But for
now, it's well enough to leave them in
the '40s— nervous, excited, sitting on
the stone steps of Radcliffe College
— and read Adams' superior work,
her stories.

"Superior Women"
By Alice Adams
Knopf, $16.95
The year is 1942. The place,
Radcliffe College. Enter Meg, Peg,
Lavinia, Cathy and Janet, five deter
mined, intelligent and reasonably in
teresting Radcliffe freshwomen.
"Superior Women," the fifth novel
by noted suburban storyteller Alice
Adams, is a journey over 40 years

and 400 pages through the
lives of these five women. Their con
frontations with death, divorce, de- |
pression and a subdued, diluted ver
sion of the political climate of the
19405, '50s, '60s and '70s are paraded
before us. In the end we are left with
four much older women, the ghosts of
dozens of secondary characters, and a
sense that there is something missing
in Adams' work — or at least in the
lives of the women she has called su
perior.

I like Adams' short stories. In col
lections such as "Beautiful Girl" and
"To See You Again," Adams takes
an omniscient, God-like look at con
temporary culture. She has a unique
way of telling everyone's story at
once — the reader hears the unsaid
words of the alcoholic father and his
lesbian daughter — both the unfaith
ful wife and the guileless husband are
laid open under Adams' eye.
This technique is effective in
shorter works, where we are com
fortable with Adams as a "tour
guide" through the universe she
wishes to share with us. But in a full
length novel, Adams' distance from
her characters begins to wear thin.
"Superior Women" is mostly the
story of Megan Greene, a dumpy and
brilliant girl from the prosaic depths
of Palo Alto, who chooses to
go to Radcliffe for sexual rather
than scholastic reasons; her first lover,
whom she meets in the aisles of the
Stanford Bookstore, is a Harvard
man. At Radcliffe, Megan makes four
more or less intimate friends —
Lavinia, a Southern belle; bitter
Janet; shy, shy Cathy; and lumpy,
maternal Peg.
After she leaves school, a thinner
and successful publishing-house exec
utive, Megan keeps in close contact
with her friends. But although they
appear frequently to vie for our at
tention, we are constantly reminded
that this is Megan's story. Not that it
is told from her point of view;
"Superior Women" is omniscient
narration pushed to the limit. Adams
guides us through all five lives with a
gentle but viselike grip on our imag
ination. We are told not only what
the characters do and think, but what
it means, on the larger cosmic plane
of things, when they do or think the
things they do.
Megan emerges as the center of the
novel because she is the most reflec

tive of any of the characters — she is
given the opportunity to muse about
all of the major episodes in her
friends' lives — and each friend in
turn undergoes a "crisis" that seems
to be a necessary rite of passage on
the road to superior womanhood.
This series of crises — or crosses —
that befall Megan and her friends is
disturbing. Each of the characters is
doomed to an aberration, internal or
external, of the very thing for which
she stands. The beautiful Lavinia has
a hideous child, the pious Cathy has
an affair with a priest. But these ex
periences bring us no closer to them
as characters and indeed bring them
no closer to an understanding of
themselves. They are merely bad
things happening to "good" people.
It is unclear, then, why these wo

men must undergo such trials. It
would be simple to blame a
malevolent God were not Adams the
omnipotent God of all of her charac
ters. The five friends are so con
trolled, their situations so calculated,
that we begin looking for a design.
The design of this book is perhaps
indicated by Adams' title. "Superior
Woman" is a disturbing, albiet com
pelling, title for a book about five
very human and often lonely, inse
cure, unstable and uninspired wo
men. The obvious question arises. To
whom are they supposed to be super
ior? What makes them superior, aside
from a fair amount of intelligence?
Indeed, the strongest element of su
periority in the novel stems from
Adams herself; as a distant narrator
she is making herself superior to her

characters by holding herself above
them and looking down from a consi
derable distance. She becomes a dif
ferent sort of superior woman — one
that the reader is aware of more as a
presence than as a confidante.
In the middle of the novel, Janet's
sometime-husband Adam Marr tells
Megan: "You superior women have a
real problem for yourselves, don't
you? . . . Just any old guy won't do —
you wouldn't like him, and even if
you did, your strength would scare
him. What you need is a hero."
Is Adams saying that it is danger
ous to be a "superior woman"? If one
is a woman and intelligent, strong, or
just perceptive, is one destined to suf
fer the fates of Megan, Peg, Cathy,
Janet and Lavinia?
The novel raises a host of questions
about the role of the strong woman in
today's society — questions,
however, that though stated are not
addressed. This would not be a prob
lem if the women in this novel didn't
seem as though they ought to be sym
bolic. But they do, and one gets the
impression that they are symbols with
nothing to symbolize.
"Superior Women" is certainly
readable, at least at first, when we are
immersed in cheerful descriptions of
Megan's early sexual exploits and
Lavinia's lace underthings. But after
400 pages, the reader and Adams
are still quite distant from the
friends, and we begin to wonder why,
after all, we are supposed to care
about them. Perhaps Adams will flesh
out one or two of the five characters
in stories or a later novel. But for
now, it's well enough to leave them in
the '40s— nervous, excited, sitting on
the stone steps of Radcliffe College
— and read Adams' superior work,
her stories.
