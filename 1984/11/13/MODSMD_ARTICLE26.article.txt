## Wrong kind of recognition 
### 
It's unfortunate, actually, that
junior linebacker Dave Wyman is
receiving the attention he
deserves. That's because Wyman
is being noticed not for his consis
tent play, as he deserves, but be
cause of ligament damage to his
right knee that might end his foot
ball career.
Stanford will not have Wyman,
a second-team All-Pacific 10 Con
ference selection last season, for
Big Game Saturday, and perhaps
not for next season either. For at
least Saturday, junior Mark
Andrew will have big shoes to fill.
Wyman, who led the Cardinal in
tackles in seven of 10 games this
season, has made 128 tackles —
32 more than linebacker Matt
Soderlund, who has the second
most tackles. Wyman's speed also
enabled him to cover receivers on
short patterns and help on end
runs.
Before Stanford's game against
the University of Arizona,
Linebacker Coach Larry Kerr
said, "There is no better inside
linebacker in the Pac-10 than
Dave Wyman." Even though Cal
has struggled on offense — the
Bears gained 163 yards in a 33-7
loss to Washington State Univer
sity Saturday — the Cardinal will
undoubtedly lose at least
experience without Wyman.
Earlier this season, especially
after Stanford lost to Washington
State and the University of Wash
ington, many began looking for
ward to Big Game, saying Stan
ford would beat the University of
California at Berkeley. A few
weeks ago, it was hard to argue
with them. But the Cardinal, vir
tually injury-free early this season,
has had its casuality list grow, and
the last time Stanford played in
Strawberry Canyon. . . .
The Cardinal's offense and
defense have lost their most im
portant players — Wyman and
quarterback John Paye. But Paye
and Wyman aren't the only ones
bitten by the injury bug. Running
back Brad Muster, who few had
heard of when this season began,
sprained his back, and receiver
Jeff James sprained an ankle
against Arizona Saturday."We've
got bumps and bruises," Cardinal
Coach Jack Elway said yesterday.
Muster leads Stanford in rush
ing with 642 yards, and if he is not
at full strength Saturday, it could

cripple the Cardinal's rushing
game. Without Muster, that part
of Stanford's offense, made neces
sary by Paye's finger injuries,
might not he able to take full ad
vantage of a Cal defense that was
exploited for 272 yards rushing by
Washington State.
As of yesterday, Paye's status
for Saturday was still question
able. Dr. Don Bunce wants Paye
to play with a splint on his injured
finger — if Paye plays. Paye
warmed up before Stanford's
game against Arizona, and with
another week off before the final
game of this season, I think it's
more likely than not Paye will
play.
But with or without Paye, the
Cardinal needs to shore up its play
on special teams. Placekicker
Mark Harmon had missed two of
14 field goal attempts this season
before missing two more against
Arizona. Also, Arizona put a big
rush on punter Doug Robison Sat
urday, and Robison's three failed
attempts were, not unexpectedly,
beneficial to Arizona. There's no
doubt Cal knows what the
Wildcats saw before playing Stan
ford, and the Cardinal's blocking
for punts will have to be improved.

I watched the Washington
State-Cal game on television, and
one announcer said Cougar
Rueben Mayes was a Heisman
Trophy candidate. That'll tell you
a lot about college football's
senior class. What'll tell you more
is that a 5-foot-10 quarterback
who has little chance of starting,
much less succeeding, in the Na
tional Football League will prob
ably win the Heisman.
Boston College's television ap
pearances are the reason Doug
Flutie will probably win the Heis
man, and 1 don't believe he is the
best college football player in the
country. Of course, many criticize
the choice of the Heisman winner
each season, but there is a new
wrinkle this year.
Florida State University Coach
Bobby Bowden said the fact that
the Seminoles are rarely on televi
sion this season is the main reason
tailback Greg Allen is not consid
ered more for the Heisman. In his
acceptance speech, Flutie should
thank CBS. Such is the power of
the idiot box.

junior linebacker Dave Wyman is
receiving the attention he
deserves. That's because Wyman
is being noticed not for his consis
tent play, as he deserves, but be
cause of ligament damage to his
right knee that might end his foot
ball career.
Stanford will not have Wyman,
a second-team All-Pacific 10 Con
ference selection last season, for
Big Game Saturday, and perhaps
not for next season either. For at
least Saturday, junior Mark
Andrew will have big shoes to fill.
Wyman, who led the Cardinal in
tackles in seven of 10 games this
season, has made 128 tackles —
32 more than linebacker Matt
Soderlund, who has the second
most tackles. Wyman's speed also
enabled him to cover receivers on
short patterns and help on end
runs.
Before Stanford's game against
the University of Arizona,
Linebacker Coach Larry Kerr
said, "There is no better inside
linebacker in the Pac-10 than
Dave Wyman." Even though Cal
has struggled on offense — the
Bears gained 163 yards in a 33-7
loss to Washington State Univer
sity Saturday — the Cardinal will
undoubtedly lose at least
experience without Wyman.
Earlier this season, especially
after Stanford lost to Washington
State and the University of Wash
ington, many began looking for
ward to Big Game, saying Stan
ford would beat the University of
California at Berkeley. A few
weeks ago, it was hard to argue
with them. But the Cardinal, vir
tually injury-free early this season,
has had its casuality list grow, and
the last time Stanford played in
Strawberry Canyon. . . .
The Cardinal's offense and
defense have lost their most im
portant players — Wyman and
quarterback John Paye. But Paye
and Wyman aren't the only ones
bitten by the injury bug. Running
back Brad Muster, who few had
heard of when this season began,
sprained his back, and receiver
Jeff James sprained an ankle
against Arizona Saturday."We've
got bumps and bruises," Cardinal
Coach Jack Elway said yesterday.
Muster leads Stanford in rush
ing with 642 yards, and if he is not
at full strength Saturday, it could

cripple the Cardinal's rushing
game. Without Muster, that part
of Stanford's offense, made neces
sary by Paye's finger injuries,
might not he able to take full ad
vantage of a Cal defense that was
exploited for 272 yards rushing by
Washington State.
As of yesterday, Paye's status
for Saturday was still question
able. Dr. Don Bunce wants Paye
to play with a splint on his injured
finger — if Paye plays. Paye
warmed up before Stanford's
game against Arizona, and with
another week off before the final
game of this season, I think it's
more likely than not Paye will
play.
But with or without Paye, the
Cardinal needs to shore up its play
on special teams. Placekicker
Mark Harmon had missed two of
14 field goal attempts this season
before missing two more against
Arizona. Also, Arizona put a big
rush on punter Doug Robison Sat
urday, and Robison's three failed
attempts were, not unexpectedly,
beneficial to Arizona. There's no
doubt Cal knows what the
Wildcats saw before playing Stan
ford, and the Cardinal's blocking
for punts will have to be improved.

I watched the Washington
State-Cal game on television, and
one announcer said Cougar
Rueben Mayes was a Heisman
Trophy candidate. That'll tell you
a lot about college football's
senior class. What'll tell you more
is that a 5-foot-10 quarterback
who has little chance of starting,
much less succeeding, in the Na
tional Football League will prob
ably win the Heisman.
Boston College's television ap
pearances are the reason Doug
Flutie will probably win the Heis
man, and 1 don't believe he is the
best college football player in the
country. Of course, many criticize
the choice of the Heisman winner
each season, but there is a new
wrinkle this year.
Florida State University Coach
Bobby Bowden said the fact that
the Seminoles are rarely on televi
sion this season is the main reason
tailback Greg Allen is not consid
ered more for the Heisman. In his
acceptance speech, Flutie should
thank CBS. Such is the power of
the idiot box.
