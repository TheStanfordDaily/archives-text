## Women's basketball Cardinal downs South Koreans 
### JOHN LIS Daily staff 
The Stanford women's basketball
team showed last night what differ
ence a year's experience can make.
The Cardinal came back from a 13-
point second half deficit to defeat the
Kolon team of South Korea, 75-68,
in an international exhibition game at
Maples Pavilion.
"That wasn't the same team that
was out there a year ago," Stanford
Head Coach Dotty McCrea said,
assessing her team's performance.
Last year's 5-23 team had a habit
of taking 13-point deficits and turn
ing them into 25-point losses. This
year's edition fell behind, 49-36, four
minutes into the second half but came
back with a 15-2 spurt to tie the game
with 9:30 to go.
"[We] didn't quit," Stanford Asst.
Coach Mike Kehoe said. "[We] were
determined to get the rebounds which
allowed us to work our offense with
poise and come back. They (Kolon)
were missing their outside shots, and
we only gave them one shot."
Kolon did not have a player over
six feet tall. The Cardinal took advan
tage of the situation, outrebounding
the Korean team, 52-26, and allow
ing Kolon only nine offensive
rebounds. Freshman forward Kami
Anderson led Stanford with eight
rebounds, while junior guard Judy
Griffith had seven and senior forward
Mary Bradach had six.
"Everyone contributed, and it was
a team effort all the way," McCrea
said. Nine Stanford players scored,
led by Bradach with 21 points. Soph

omore forward Sue Sebolt had 11 and
Anderson added 10 in her first col
legiate outing.
The Cardinal is a young team again
this year — eight of the 11 players are
freshmen or sophomores. Four of
those sophomores have a year's ex
perience under their belt, and the
Cardinal didn't fold down the stretch
as it had all too often last season.
With the game tied, 64-64, Sebolt
scored on two inside shots to give
Stanford a four-point lead with 1:48
left. A free throw by freshman guard
Charli Turner, layups by Bradach and
Anderson and a pair of free throws by
junior guard Virginia Sourlis with six
seconds left iced the game.
Stanford opens the regular season
Saturday night in Berkeley against
California in a Big Game night
matchup.
Card notes
Junior center Sarah Evans will red
shirt this season. Evans is out of ac
tion with a serious back injury. Soph
omore Karen Goedewaagen will take
over the center spot, and sophomore
Kim Mercer will move from forward
to center to give her a breather.
Stanford wore its new home uni
forms for the first time last night. The
uniforms are gray with cardinal and
white trim, white numerals and a
white stripe across the chest with
"Stanford" in cardinal script.
Jun Sook, a member of the silver
medalist South Korean National
Team, led Kolon with 24 points. Kim
Hyung-Sook was the only other
Korean in double figures, with 10.
