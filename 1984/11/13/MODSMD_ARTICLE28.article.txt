WALNUT CREEK (AP) — Neil Hope and

the University of Southern California's victory that
led to a Rose Bowl berth, were named Players of
the Week in Pacific 10 Conference football yester
day.
USC was a 16-7 winner Saturday over the Uni

up one pass.
"Neil played his best football game since he's
been at USC," Coach Ted Tollner said. "He did

anything wrong."

booting an extra point and making field goals from
51, 47 and 46 yards. He tied the school single

season record for field goals by making his 1984
