A recommendation for the develop
ment of a campus in Washington, D.C.,
should be presented to the School of
Humanities and Sciences at the end of
this month, according to Catherine Mil
ton, special assistant to University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy.
The Washington campus program
would give students interested in the
federal government the opportunity to
supplement an internship with academic
work.
Milton began working on the project
last year when Kennedy suggested a
Washington campus as part of his promo
tion of public service.

Students would get experience working
for a public service organization while re
ceiving University credit.
Milton emphasized that the project is
still "at a very early exploratory stage."
"We are looking at a variety of op
tions," she said.
Milton and two student interns from
Stanford-In-Government, Leslie Hecht
and Anne Pings, have gathered informa
tion about a number of Washington pro
grams administered by other universities.
Among these, the Cornell University's
program has some of the qualities Milton
wants to see in a Stanford program. Stu
dents consistently get "very good" in
ternships and the accompanying aca
demic work is "solid," Milton said.

Juniors and seniors from Cornell who
participate in the program spend a semes
ter in Washington. The internships re
quire a 40-hour per week commitment.
In addition, students attend seminar
classes and write papers concerning their
internships that are "thesis quality," ac
cording to Milton.
"The advantage Cornell has over Stan
ford is obviously that they can have their
faculty commute," Milton said.
She also said she is considering ways to
use University faculty as much as possi
ble. "If we can work out a way to use
Stanford faculty the program will have
the best chance to succeed."
