A recommendation for the develop
ment of a campus in Washington, D.C.,
should be presented to the School of
Humanities and Sciences at the end of
this month, according to Catherine Mil
ton, special assistant to University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy.
The Washington campus program
would give students interested in the
federal government the opportunity to
supplement an internship with academic
work.
Milton began working on the project
last year when Kennedy suggested a
Washington campus as part of his promo
tion of public service.

Students would get experience working
for a public service organization while re
ceiving University credit.
Milton emphasized that the project is
still "at a very early exploratory stage."
"We are looking at a variety of op
tions," she said.
Milton and two student interns from
Stanford-In-Government, Leslie Hecht
and Anne Pings, have gathered informa
tion about a number of Washington pro
grams administered by other universities.
Among these, the Cornell University's
program has some of the qualities Milton
wants to see in a Stanford program. Stu
dents consistently get "very good" in
ternships and the accompanying aca
demic work is "solid," Milton said.

Juniors and seniors from Cornell who
participate in the program spend a semes
ter in Washington. The internships re
quire a 40-hour per week commitment.
In addition, students attend seminar
classes and write papers concerning their
internships that are "thesis quality," ac
cording to Milton.
"The advantage Cornell has over Stan
ford is obviously that they can have their
faculty commute," Milton said.
She also said she is considering ways to
use University faculty as much as possi
ble. "If we can work out a way to use
Stanford faculty the program will have
the best chance to succeed."

Milton has not yet formulated spe
cific recommendations for the Wash
ington program. "We're still juggling
around ideas at this point," she said.
She added that she would like to
see the program start small. "If we
begin it much like a pilot project,
we'll see just what changes we need
to make."
Milton stressed the need for aca
demic integrity in the program. The
internships available to students will
need to be of consistently high quality
if they must support academic work.
"There is a wide range of intern
ships available. A lot of internships
turn into doing someone's office
work. We would need to make sure
that the internships dealt with sub
stantive issues and that there were
people who really wanted to be nur
turing mentors."
Milton likened the campus in
Washington to a Stanford overseas
campus, although she said a full cur
riculum would probably not be of
fered.
"We consider the internship the
central part of the program. We fig
ure that if students want to take
classes about the federal government,
or about anything else, they can do
that here. The unique thing would be
the intensive learning by doing exper
ience of the internship which would
only be possible in Washington."
Milton said that considerations
such as housing for students and pos
sible Stanford headquarters in the
capital will be dealt with at a later
stage in the planning.
Once the recommendation goes to
Associate Deans Carolyn Lougee and
David Kennedy, "We'll see what

happens," Milton said.
Milton said that although she has
considered the budget of the pro
gram, the planning is not far enough
along that she has looked at specific
sources of funds.
Currently Stanford-In-
Government is the only campus or
ganization that helps students secure
internships in Washington.
