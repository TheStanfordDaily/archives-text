# Week of Nov. 5-12
## Police Blotter 
### 
The "Alpha" and "Phi" of a new sign on the Alpha Delta Phi house
disappeared between 7 and 10:30 p.m. on Nov. 10. Fraternity Vice Pres
ident Steve Slater, who made the letters out of one-inch red steel tubing,
estimates their replacement cost at $150. Reporting the crime on Mon
day, Slater said the off-campus Alpha Phi fraternity appears to be a
likely suspect. Police investigation had not begun at press time. Informa
tion was also not available on the letters spelling "Stanford Stadium"
stolen several weeks ago.
Stanford police made a flurry of alcohol-related and warrant arrests as
last weekend drew near. After ignoring several warnings in previous
weeks, John Waters was taken into custody on Nov. 9at 12:10 a.m. for
illegal lodging and an outstanding warrant. He had been sleeping in his
vehicle in the 300 block of Campus Drive. During his strip search at
North County Jail, Waters spat in the face of an assisting Stanford dep
uty and so received an additional charge of battery of an officer.
Battery of an officer is a felony offense in California. Unless the offi
cer sustains a "traumatic injury." however, the charge is usually reduced
to a misdemeanor in court, according to Sgt. Philip Love. Love said he
expects Waters to receive a misdemeanor charge.
Later that morning the police stopped Thomas Furtin for a vehicle
code violation near Lomita Court and Lagunita Drive and charged him
with driving under the influence. That evening officers pursued Adam
Trueblood in the 500 block of Mayfield Avenue before booking him for
possible DUI and resisting arrest. Police apprehended Kevin Biddle on
Nov. 10 near Santa Ynez Street and Alvarado Row for drunken driving
around 9:40 p.m. All three men were booked into North County Jail.
No incidents of bicycle theft were reported to the Stanford police last
week. Nevertheless, thieves and burglars continued to operate on
campus, stealing purses and items of women's clothing in particular. On
Nov. 5 an unknown party removed some articles of clothing from a
female student's room in Wilbur Hall between 7:20 and 7:30 a.m.; an
other student spied a man only 20 minutes later taking women's clothing
off the floor in a restroom area of the building. Another student lost
some clothes when a Hispanic male entered her Toyon Hall room
through a window on Nov. 9 around 9:50 a.m.
Thieves took purses in Fairchild Auditorium and Memorial Church
recently. Two area men added to the list of petty thefts when they were
both cited for shoplifting in the Stanford Bookstore on the afternoon of
Nov. 6. The bookstore employs plainclothes people to catch shoplifters.
