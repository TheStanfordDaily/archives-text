# 'Skeptic' lampoons psychic powers
## 
### FRANK LESTER Staff writer 
The chairman of the Bay Area Skeptics
last night managed to trick an audience of
45 in Soto Lounge into believing he was a
psychic with supernatural powers of clair
voyance and psychokinesis.
Robert Steiner, a professional magician,
certified public accountant and psychic in
vestigator, billed himself as "Henry Dixon,
Psychic" and fooled the entire audience
into believing he had the mental powers to
make people tell the truth and to read
people's minds.
Several people were heard to ask before
the session began, "Is this guy Jeane
Dixon's brother or something?" Steiner
strolled in with a briefcase of magic tricks.
"I don't have supernatural powers.

What I can do, anyone in this room can
do," he said, commanding the audience to
tune into its "vibes." "You all will feel a
desire to scratch some part of you. Just
give in to it."
Half the audience reported having felt
an urge to scratch themselves afterward.
Warming to his subject, Steiner plucked
a victim out of the audience and said, "A
lot of times, private psychic readings are
really emotionally-charged. However, I
don't think it's right in a group like this to
get into anything personal. So if I were to
ask this person anything personal, it
wouldn't be fair, in front of the group. I
work with coins and such other things so
people don't get personally involved.
"I have a deck of cards here. Steve here
is going to take a card, and I'm going to

show him how to psychically tune in on
that card. Got it?" Steiner said.
The victim was told to select a card and
put it back in the deck. Steiner halved and
quartered and eighthed the deck, each
time telling the victim to choose which of
two piles he wanted to eliminate from psy
chic consideration. "Keep one, discard
one. Which one do you want to discard? 1 '
he asked Steve each time.
"Steve, there are two cards left. Point to
one," Steiner finally said. Steve picked the
jack of clubs â€” the same card he had first
chosen.
The audience oohed and aahed. They
applauded vigorously every time a card
was "revealed" through clairvoyance to be
the one the victim had chosen. The cheers
intensified when Steiner appeared to read

a spectator's mind and"know" the exact
wording of a line in a newspaper clipping
the spectator had chosen at random.
But finally the truth came out.
"Are you ready for this?" Steiner asked,
closing his bag of tricks. "My name is Bob
Steiner. I'm a professional magician, and
every single thing you saw tonight was
done by trickery."
Only one spectator clapped at this.
Steiner said he had done this presenta
tion to demonstrate how gullible people
are to the deceptive practices of psychics.
"Most people that claim psychic abilities
are sincere but misguided," he said. "A
small percentage are frauds. The way you
can find out who the frauds are is to ask
