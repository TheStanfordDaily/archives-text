The University Board of Trustees is scheduled to
choose a site for the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library
at its Dec. /1 meeting, but Portola Valley residents plan
to make their case against one of the proposed sites before
any final decision is made.
The three-to-five-acre site, located across Alpine Road
from the Ladera Shopping Center, is officially considered
part of Palo Alto and Santa Clara County but is very close
to the Portola Valley border.
Betsy Crowder, secretary of the Committee for Green
Foothills and a former member of the Portola Valley
Planning Commission, said she discovered on Nov. 6 that
Stanford had been doing some "large graveling and car

Crowder and other Portola Valley residents are upset
because "nobody had received any notice of this/'
Asked if the University is in the wrong, Crowder
replied, "Oh, yes."
Crowder said that the land along Deer Creek was
leased out to a plant nursery that plans to expand along
the creek. The University is "trying to play that (the plans
for the nursery) down." If the Reagan library was built at
that location, plans for the expansion of the nursery would
be shelved, she said.
"We think it (the Alpine Road site) is environmentally
poor, " she continued, explaining that cement may pollute
the creek during construction of the library.
"We of course will protest this site," Crowder said. She
noted that Alpine Road is the only exit for Portola Valley
from Interstate 280, and that a great increase in traffic
would make traffic lights a necessity.
The other sites under consideration are a spot near the
Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences,
west of Junipero Serra Boulevard near the lake and the
