# Bowman revamp nears end

### CAMERON KALLER Staff writer 
A 7,000-square-foot addition to the
Bowman Alumni House should be finished
within 10 days, according to Bill Stone, as
sociate director of the Stanford Alumni
Association.
The construction was originally sched
uled to be completed last Friday.
"We've added a new wing since our staff
has grown so much, and there's no longer
the space to accommodate everyone. The
office space was designed for 38 people,
and we've currently got about 55 working
for us," Stone said.
Carol Bounds, assistant to the director,
said, "Everyone is very, very crowded
here. We've got all our things in boxes and
are sitting ready to move any minute. We
were supposed to have moved Friday, but

it's been put off on a day-to-day hold."
Both Stone and Bounds said the delay in
moving into the new wing is due in part to
the wet weather. "Everything is basically
finished on the inside, but the rains may
have held things up a little bit with the
completion of the outside plans," Bounds
said.
The addition is being financed by a loan
from the California Education Facilities
Authority, a bond issuing authority in the
state.
"It's like a mortgage for us," Stone said.
"We will pay off the bond through
internally-generated revenues."
The construction behind Tresidder
Union on Santa Teresa Street is a result of
both the installation of Stanford's new tele
phone and telecommunications lines and
the Bowman addition, Stone said.

"The trailer and construction office, as
well as the double parked cars and so forth,
will disappear soon," he said. He jokingly
compared the pull-out of construction
equipment in the area to a "demilitarized
zone."
Stone is hoping the "expanded office
space will be turned into more activity."
He explained, "This way, we'll be having
the space to fill a few jobs that had been
left on the back-burner. The volume of our
activities won't change overnight, but over
time we'll probably see some increases."
Bowman House, a non-profit organiza
tion with 55,000 members, is responsible
for all alumni relations, from planning class
and club reunions to running the Stanford
Sierra Camp near Lake Tahoe to planning
and overseeing a series of publications.

Workers this week hurry to finish construction of a new wing at the Bowman Alumni
House. The 7,000-square-foot addition is needed to ease overcrowded office conditions
there.
