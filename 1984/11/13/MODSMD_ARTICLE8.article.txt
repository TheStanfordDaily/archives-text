Shuttle crew salvages satellite
HOUSTON — Two astronauts completed history's first space salvage
mission yesterday by arm-wrestling a massive satellite into place in the
cargo hay of the space shuttle Discovery after a failed brace thwarted use
of the ship's robot arm.
Joe Allen, 47, at 130 pounds the smallest man in the astronaut corps,
held the 1,200-pound satellite steady for about an hour and a half as fel
low astronaut Dale Gardner worked to anchor it in the cargo bay for the
return flight home.
Allen was heard to gasp repeatedly against the inertia of the nine
foot-tall Palapa B2 satellite. Then Gardner called out "All right! We got
it. We got it!" as he slammed home three locking pins.
Despite the astronauts' care, mission commander Frederick Hauck
said that some of the glassy, power-generating solar cells blanketing
Palapa were damaged. The Discovery team hopes to avoid similar prob
lems when it attempts to retrieve the identical Westar 6 satellite tomor
row.
"Joe and I knew we could do it that way, although 1 knew some of you
were doubtful," Gardner told mission control at the Johnson Space Cen
ter here near the end of the six-hour assignment. He later amended that
in a crew conference with Houston.
"I don't know how it looked to you on the ground, but all that man
handling was not a piece of cake. We did it and we would do it again if
we had to, but we don't think it's the way to go."
Baby Fae has rejection episode
LOMA LINDA — Baby Fae's efforts to reject her transplanted
baboon heart continued yesterday and were stronger than initially
thought, hospital officials said in a revised statement.
The rejection episode "has been more moderate than mild," and the
month-old infant, whose identity is being kept secret at her parents' re
quest, has been put back on oxygen after breathing on her own for 30
hours, Loma Linda University Medical Center spokeswoman Patti
Gentry said.
However, she said Baby Fae's condition remains serious but stable, as
it has been since the week after the operation.
"She's coming out of the rejection," Gentry said, adding that the 5-
pound girl continues to respond well to immunosuppressant drugs,
medication that stems the body's efforts to reject foreign tissue such as
the baboon heart implanted in Baby Fae's chest in an unprecedented op
eration on Oct. 26.
The rejection episode, initially described as mild, was discussed Sun
day by pediatric cardiologist Dr. Robin Doroshow on the CBS show
"Face the Nation."
Talks resume in restaurant strike
SAN FRANCISCO — Negotiations in a bitter, 73-day restaurant
strike resumed yesterday for the first time since Oct. 21 after the union
signaled "some flexibility" in its position.
"On our side, we feel it's a very positive step," said Barbara Lewis,
spokeswoman for Local 2 of the Hotel and Restaurants Employees and
Bartenders Union. "There's flexibility in our position, and we were
prepared to go in there and do some serious negotiating."
Lewis declined to provide details of the union's current position. Offi
cials of the Golden Gate Restaurant Association declined comment.
One item not negotiable, according to Lewis, concerns union mem
bers whom management may have replaced with "permanent" help
during the strike. She said Alfreds, Bruno's and Bardelli's had each
replaced some union members with "permanent" workers.
"Our position" Lewis, "is we're not going to sign a contract un
less everybody goes back to work."
The renewed talks began under the direction of veteran labor
mediator Sam Ka'gel, who also presided when the last talks broke down.
Lewis said Kagel refused to meet as a go-between until both parties
agreed to call the meeting "mutually."
"We went back into negotiations at 9 a.m. with the GGRA under
mutual agreement," she said. "Various phone calls had been exchanged,
and Sam Kagel would not agree to meet until both sides agreed to meet
mutually."
Lewis said "as long as there's movement" the two sides would con
tinue bargaining, regardless of the hour.
Gandhi pledges to retain policies
NEW DELHI, India — Invoking his mother's name 10 times, new In
dian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi set the stage yesterday for national
elections by pledging to continue all her national programs and policies,
including "the wide-ranging and time-tested relationship with the Soviet
Union."
In his first major address since assuming office after the assassination
of his mother, Indira Gandhi, on Oct. 31, Rajiv Gandhi also appealed in
his mother's name for an end to the sectarian violence that has rocked
this country of 700 million people in recent weeks.
"No religion preaches hatred and intolerance," he said. "Vested inter
ests, both external and internal, are inciting and exploiting communal
passions and violence to divide India."
Reflecting fears that members of the Sikh religion in Punjab state will
retaliate against Hindus there for violence against Sikhs in New Delhi
and other cities following the assassination, the new leader added,
"Answering communalism with communalism will only help these sub
versive and secessionist forces."
In the foreign policy section of his speech, Gandhi first praised his
country's relationship with the Soviet Union, which he said is "based
upon mutual cooperation, friendship and vital support when most
needed."
Regarding the United States, he said, "With the United States of
America, we have a multi-faceted relationship. We attach importance to
our economic, technological and cultural cooperation with them."
Bishops defend political remarks
WASHINGTON — Catholic bishops meeting here to discuss their
highly critical report on the American economy yesterday defended
their expanding reach into national political affairs, including such issues
as abortion, nuclear weapons, human rights and now economics.
"On any of these four issues, silence on our part would approximate
dereliction of pastoral duty and civic irresponsibility," said Archbishop
James Malone, of Youngstown, Ohio, and president of the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops.
Malone said the bishops have adopted a more powerful "corporate
voice" to influence public opinion, not election politics. Since a 1975
study on human rights, the church has made a concerted effort to join
public policy discussions and "to rise above a purely individualistic view
of issues and address their social significance," he said.
The pastoral letter on the economy, however, continued to stir par
tisan wrangling, and the bishops' growing political activism worried ex
perts on church-state relations.
In New York, Gov. Mario Cuomo said the comments of conservatives
who attacked the bishops and their critique of the U.S. economy "were
ugly and partisan." He added: "They have run amok with their conser
vatism."
Writer Michael Novak, who helped draft a separate economic report
by a lay group from business and government, said that the bishops
failed to recognize the success of the U.S. economy.
Quiet trading on Wall Street
NEW YORK — Stock prices drifted around last week's closing levels
yesterday, unable to establish any trend in the quietest trading in more
than a month.
A few individual issues responded to corporate news developments.
But activity was limited by the closing of many banks and other busi
nesses for Veterans Day.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down about 6 points at its
midsession lows, finished with a .22 gain at 1,219.19. Most other market
indicators remained on the minus side.

strike resumed yesterday for the first time since Oct. 21 after the union
signaled "some flexibility" in its position.
"On our side, we feel it's a very positive step," said Barbara Lewis,
spokeswoman for Local 2 of the Hotel and Restaurants Employees and
Bartenders Union. "There's flexibility in our position, and we were
prepared to go in there and do some serious negotiating."
Lewis declined to provide details of the union's current position. Offi
cials of the Golden Gate Restaurant Association declined comment.
One item not negotiable, according to Lewis, concerns union mem
bers whom management may have replaced with "permanent" help
during the strike. She said Alfreds, Bruno's and Bardelli's had each
replaced some union members with "permanent" workers.
"Our position" Lewis, "is we're not going to sign a contract un
less everybody goes back to work."
The renewed talks began under the direction of veteran labor
mediator Sam Ka'gel, who also presided when the last talks broke down.
Lewis said Kagel refused to meet as a go-between until both parties
agreed to call the meeting "mutually."
"We went back into negotiations at 9 a.m. with the GGRA under
mutual agreement," she said. "Various phone calls had been exchanged,
and Sam Kagel would not agree to meet until both sides agreed to meet
mutually."
Lewis said "as long as there's movement" the two sides would con
tinue bargaining, regardless of the hour.
Gandhi pledges to retain policies
NEW DELHI, India — Invoking his mother's name 10 times, new In
dian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi set the stage yesterday for national
elections by pledging to continue all her national programs and policies,
including "the wide-ranging and time-tested relationship with the Soviet
Union."
In his first major address since assuming office after the assassination
of his mother, Indira Gandhi, on Oct. 31, Rajiv Gandhi also appealed in
his mother's name for an end to the sectarian violence that has rocked
this country of 700 million people in recent weeks.
"No religion preaches hatred and intolerance," he said. "Vested inter
ests, both external and internal, are inciting and exploiting communal
passions and violence to divide India."
Reflecting fears that members of the Sikh religion in Punjab state will
retaliate against Hindus there for violence against Sikhs in New Delhi
and other cities following the assassination, the new leader added,
"Answering communalism with communalism will only help these sub
versive and secessionist forces."
In the foreign policy section of his speech, Gandhi first praised his
country's relationship with the Soviet Union, which he said is "based
upon mutual cooperation, friendship and vital support when most
needed."
Regarding the United States, he said, "With the United States of
America, we have a multi-faceted relationship. We attach importance to
our economic, technological and cultural cooperation with them."
Bishops defend political remarks
WASHINGTON — Catholic bishops meeting here to discuss their
highly critical report on the American economy yesterday defended
their expanding reach into national political affairs, including such issues
as abortion, nuclear weapons, human rights and now economics.
"On any of these four issues, silence on our part would approximate
dereliction of pastoral duty and civic irresponsibility," said Archbishop
James Malone, of Youngstown, Ohio, and president of the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops.
Malone said the bishops have adopted a more powerful "corporate
voice" to influence public opinion, not election politics. Since a 1975
study on human rights, the church has made a concerted effort to join
public policy discussions and "to rise above a purely individualistic view
of issues and address their social significance," he said.
The pastoral letter on the economy, however, continued to stir par
tisan wrangling, and the bishops' growing political activism worried ex
perts on church-state relations.
In New York, Gov. Mario Cuomo said the comments of conservatives
who attacked the bishops and their critique of the U.S. economy "were
ugly and partisan." He added: "They have run amok with their conser
vatism."
Writer Michael Novak, who helped draft a separate economic report
by a lay group from business and government, said that the bishops
failed to recognize the success of the U.S. economy.
Quiet trading on Wall Street
NEW YORK — Stock prices drifted around last week's closing levels
yesterday, unable to establish any trend in the quietest trading in more
than a month.
A few individual issues responded to corporate news developments.
But activity was limited by the closing of many banks and other busi
nesses for Veterans Day.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down about 6 points at its
midsession lows, finished with a .22 gain at 1,219.19. Most other market
indicators remained on the minus side.

Shuttle crew salvages satellite
HOUSTON — Two astronauts completed history's first space salvage
mission yesterday by arm-wrestling a massive satellite into place in the
cargo hay of the space shuttle Discovery after a failed brace thwarted use
of the ship's robot arm.
Joe Allen, 47, at 130 pounds the smallest man in the astronaut corps,
held the 1,200-pound satellite steady for about an hour and a half as fel
low astronaut Dale Gardner worked to anchor it in the cargo bay for the
return flight home.
Allen was heard to gasp repeatedly against the inertia of the nine
foot-tall Palapa B2 satellite. Then Gardner called out "All right! We got
it. We got it!" as he slammed home three locking pins.
Despite the astronauts' care, mission commander Frederick Hauck
said that some of the glassy, power-generating solar cells blanketing
Palapa were damaged. The Discovery team hopes to avoid similar prob
lems when it attempts to retrieve the identical Westar 6 satellite tomor
row.
"Joe and I knew we could do it that way, although 1 knew some of you
were doubtful," Gardner told mission control at the Johnson Space Cen
ter here near the end of the six-hour assignment. He later amended that
in a crew conference with Houston.
"I don't know how it looked to you on the ground, but all that man
handling was not a piece of cake. We did it and we would do it again if
we had to, but we don't think it's the way to go."
Baby Fae has rejection episode
LOMA LINDA — Baby Fae's efforts to reject her transplanted
baboon heart continued yesterday and were stronger than initially
thought, hospital officials said in a revised statement.
The rejection episode "has been more moderate than mild," and the
month-old infant, whose identity is being kept secret at her parents' re
quest, has been put back on oxygen after breathing on her own for 30
hours, Loma Linda University Medical Center spokeswoman Patti
Gentry said.
However, she said Baby Fae's condition remains serious but stable, as
it has been since the week after the operation.
"She's coming out of the rejection," Gentry said, adding that the 5-
pound girl continues to respond well to immunosuppressant drugs,
medication that stems the body's efforts to reject foreign tissue such as
the baboon heart implanted in Baby Fae's chest in an unprecedented op
eration on Oct. 26.
The rejection episode, initially described as mild, was discussed Sun
day by pediatric cardiologist Dr. Robin Doroshow on the CBS show
"Face the Nation."
