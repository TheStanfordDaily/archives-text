## Alert declared in Nicaragua 
### 
MANAGUA, Nicaragua — Tanks and other
armored vehicles rolled into this city's streets yes
terday morning as the Defense Ministry announced
a nationwide alert because of what officials des
cribed as the threat of a U.S. attack.
Soldiers dug trenches for shelter against air raids
and took up positions at scattered points along
major roads. Militias received orders to stockpile
food and to form teams to fight fires, provide first
aid, and care for children and old people in case of
attack.
In Brasilia, Secretary of State George Shultz said
Nicaraguan fears were "self-induced and based on
nothing. - ' But he added, during a news conference
at the General Assembly of the Organization of
American States, that the United States intends to
"work in every way that we can to cast"
Nicaragua's "aggression and subversive influence
out of our hemisphere."
The alert, announced in "emergency com
munique No. 1" published in yesterday morning's
newspapers, was the government's most dramatic
response to events since President Reagan's re
election that have been cited here as evidence of
U.S. intention to take direct military action against
Nicaragua. These included escalation of U.S. com
plaints about delivery of Soviet Bloc arms and five
flights in four days by U.S. supersonic spy jets that
caused sonic booms.
The alert thus reflected concern that Reagan, un
encumbered by the political need to appear as
peacemaker before the U.S. elections, would
ratchet up pressure on the left-wing Sandinista gov

ernment, diplomats and other political observers
said.
But the mobilization also served the Nicaraguan
government's own domestic purposes following
elections here eight days ago, these sources said. A
crisis atmosphere helps to keep occupied the pro
government militants who previously were busy
with the election campaign, and it provides a good
excuse for a possible crackdown on the domestic
opposition, they said.
Already some political liberties that were
granted during the three-month Nicaraguan cam
paign were being withdrawn. The sole opposition
newspaper. La Prensa, reported that the Interior
Ministry had tightened censorship considerably
beginning last Wednesday.
"I do think that many Sandinista leaders believe
in an eventual U.S. military assault on this country.
It is an article of faith with them," a foreign politi
cal observer said in discussing the mobilization. But
he added that the alert "obviously does somethng
for (Sandinista) cadres: It keeps their enthusiasm
and sense of preparedness up . . . [and] it gives the
government a marvelous excuse to move against
the opposition and toward the militarization of the
society."
Some opposition leaders complained that signs
of growing U.S. pressure on Nicaragua, by encour
aging hard-liners in the government here, was
jeopardizing their own efforts to force the Sandi
nistas to assure political and economic liberties.
These leaders, who have received U.S. backing,
said the crisis atmosphere was giving the govern

ment a boost a. a lime when an opposition boycott
of the elections here had embarrassed tht Sandinis
tas abroad. ,
The U.S. campaign in recent days hasn t done
us any good," Dr. Luis Rivas Leiva. president of
the Democratic Coordinator Alliance, said. The
coordinator, an alliance of four political parties,
two unions and the nation s largest business organi
zation, are considered to be the principal opposi
tion group. _ . . n
"The Sandinista Front has shown that it handles
itself much better in a military offensive than it
does in defending itsell against the civic opposition.
We had them on the defensive," Rivas Leiva said.
The alert marked the first time that tanks and
armored personnel carriers have been stationed on
Managua's streets. By midday, most were hidden
on the sides of roads under piles of green branches
placed on top as camoutlage.
Militia members and other activists were reluc
tant to discuss their activities, but they were seen
giving rifle instruction to some citizens and loading
boxes of cartridges onto military trucks.
Stories quoting opposition leaders or other gov
ernment critics, which frequently had appeared
during the election campaign here, increasingly
were being barred. Another of the censor s targets
were wire dispatches from Washington quoting
U.S. government officials as expressing concern
over Soviet arms shipments here or denying that
the United States was contemplating an invasion.

society."
Some opposition leaders complained that signs
of growing U.S. pressure on Nicaragua, by encour
aging hard-liners in the government here, was
jeopardizing their own efforts to force the Sandi
nistas to assure political and economic liberties.
These leaders, who have received U.S. backing,
said the crisis atmosphere was giving the govern

ment a boost a. a lime when an opposition boycott
of the elections here had embarrassed tht Sandinis
tas abroad. ,
The U.S. campaign in recent days hasn t done
us any good," Dr. Luis Rivas Leiva. president of
the Democratic Coordinator Alliance, said. The
coordinator, an alliance of four political parties,
two unions and the nation s largest business organi
zation, are considered to be the principal opposi
tion group. _ . . n
"The Sandinista Front has shown that it handles
itself much better in a military offensive than it
does in defending itsell against the civic opposition.
We had them on the defensive," Rivas Leiva said.
The alert marked the first time that tanks and
armored personnel carriers have been stationed on
Managua's streets. By midday, most were hidden
on the sides of roads under piles of green branches
placed on top as camoutlage.
Militia members and other activists were reluc
tant to discuss their activities, but they were seen
giving rifle instruction to some citizens and loading
boxes of cartridges onto military trucks.
Stories quoting opposition leaders or other gov
ernment critics, which frequently had appeared
during the election campaign here, increasingly
were being barred. Another of the censor s targets
were wire dispatches from Washington quoting
U.S. government officials as expressing concern
over Soviet arms shipments here or denying that
the United States was contemplating an invasion.
