## Berkeley's new image Has the liberal hotbed simmered down? 
### JEANNE COOPER Senior staff writer 
Have the doves of Berkeley gone
right wing? Recent newspaper arti
cles claim the once-liberal "hotbed"
of the University of California now
contains students more interested in
feathering their nests than furthering
unrest. Rumor has it that pre
professionalism, Republican-style, is
rearing its preppy head in the land of
People's Park.

It's true, surveys of incoming Cal
freshmen reveal more students want
to major in engineering and business,
the antitheses of the classic liberal
arts degrees pursued by their 1960s
counterparts. But does the gradual
replacement of basketweaving by ac
counting in students' curricula reflect
a similar political shift?
A recent poll by the Cal Sociology
Department says "no." According to
Ray Colbig of Cal's Public Informa

tion Office, the poll showed "a strong
majority of students still consider
themselves liberal." The poll found
that the majority of the students in
tended to vote for Democratic candi
dates Walter Mondale and Geraldine
Ferraro — not unlike another school
across the Bay and down the Penin
sula.
"I think there are probably some
what more students who are inter
ested in Republican politics, and the
percentage who call themselves
moderate or conservative is greater,
but there hasn't been an overwhelm
ing change," Colbig said.
In fact, if there's been any dramatic
move in political orientation, it's been
in the city of Berkeley — to the left.
On Nov. 6, Berkeley residents added
four more "progressive Democrats"
to the four already on its nine
member city council. Cal education
student Nancy Skinner is one of the
newly elected memebers.
Known as the Berkeley Citizens
Action Coalition, the group should
not be called liberal, Colbig cau
tioned. " 'Liberals' in Berkeley are
considered conservatives," he said.
" 'Progressives' are what used to be
called 'radicals.' These people have
an agenda which will be fairly contro
versial."
Yet the city streets are too quiet for
some. Where are the protests, the
marches, the demonstrations of yes
teryear? Over in Sproul "Sit-In"
Plaza, smoothies and felafel are sel
ling like whole-grain hotcakes, but no
one enthralls the masses like Free
Speech Movement leader Mario
Savio did in 1964.
No one, that is, except a graying
Mario Savio, who addressed a crowd
of approximately 4,000 in Sproul
Plaza on Oct. 2. He and others
were celebrating the 20th anniversary
of a series of sit-ins and demonstra
tions that eventually won students the
right to political activism on campus.
In his 1984 speech, Savio considered
the allegations of conservatism at his
alma mater:
"People say Berkeley has gone
conservative because students aren't
fighting for things like free speech
anymore. But they don't have to;
those battles have already been
fought. It would be redundant for stu
dents of the '80s to fight the battles of
the '605."
Debbie Knaff, a graduate student
in anthropology, grew up in Berkeley
during the '60s and '70s. A writer for
The Daily Californian, she notes
some institutions of the '60s have dis
appeared. The Berkeley Barb — "the

really radical left-wing paper" —
went out of business a year and a half
ago; Bluebeard's, her favorite hip
record/T-shirt/button store, is going
out of business too. "Telegraph Ave
nue may still have a lot of street ven

free speech anymore. But they don't
have to. . . . It would be redundant for
students of the '80s to fight the battles
of the '60s.'

dors, but the artisans are cheaper,"
she said. "You used to be able to find
so many beautiful things."
On the other hand, some of the
'60s has become institutionalized.
"We don't always need to work
outside the system, because part of
the '60s fight was to establish stu
dents' own structures; they can work

within the system now," Knaff said.
The university has accommodated
student interests by including them
on more committees, while students
have formed Sacramento and city hall
lobbies to express their concerns.

And The Daily Californian is an inde
pendent corporation.
The town/gown relationship has
cooled off, Knaff said, not only be
cause the city is electing more pro
gressive officials, but also because
"students aren't rioting, holding
marches and starting fires."
The Cal activists of the '80s may

make their voices heard less violently,
but they still raise them, Knaff em
phasized. The Graduate Assembly
and the Associated Students' Union
Cooperative have declared the
campus an "official sanctuary" for
Central American refugees.
Students at Boalt Hall (the law
school at Berkeley) are picketing
regents' meetings after the university
officials refused to let the school ban
CIA job interviews. The law school
did not want to sponsor organizations
which discriminate on the basis of
sexual orientation.
If you can't hear a single eloquent
voice like Savio's in Sproul Plaza that
often any more, you can hear many
less well-expressed exhortations any
school day around lunchtime, and a
free hand may garner you a rainbow
of brightly-colored "information."
"Those of us who are natives see it
pretty much as it always was, maybe
because we want to or because it
really is," Knaff commented. "It's

Although recent magazine articles have portrayed the University of
California at Berkeley as newly conservative, Berkeley officials said the
city itself is moving to the left politically.

This calm view of the University of California at Berkeley campus contrasts with some of its more turbulent
scenes in the 1960s and '70s.
