						taxing experience

We've known for two years that the Reagan
administration has been waging a secret war in
Nicaragua. Soon the not-so-secret tax plan will
be unveiled. Long before the election, adminis
tration officials were busy forging a tax plan that,
according to a White House official, probably will
be a modified flat tax including the elimination of
many deductions.
It is one thing to consider that President
Reagan repeatedly denied during his re-election
campaign that he had a secret plan to raise taxes,
saying that he had no access to a tax proposal
being drafted that would not, conveniently, be
made public until one month after the election. It
is a completely different matter to discuss the in
herent unfairness of a flat tax.
On the surface, a "tax simplification" plan
seems like a fine idea: Tax rates would be
lowered while loopholes that many find unfair or
too complex would be disallowed. However, the
plan could simply be a well-disguised device to
raise taxes, like Reagan's "deficit reduction" bill
which raised taxes by $50 billion dollars over
three years.
The flat tax will destroy even the slight degree
of progressiveness (after deductions) in the cur

rent tax system.
Tax deductions are primarily used by the
people able to use them, the rich and the upper
middle class. The deductions are reprehensible,
and something must be done about them. But it is
ridiculous to assume that a flat tax system with
fewer allowable deductions will solve this prob
lem. Even if the flat tax begins with no loopholes,
many will return or be found. The probability of
the outlawed deductions being re-introduced to
the tax system increases with time. Any deduc
tion added will be more regressive than the same
deduction under a progressive tax.
Reagan has already promised not to eliminate
the interest deduction on home mortgages.
Which other deductions will remain?
A senior administration official noted that the
current tax system is "too damn complicated."
We agree. The effort to simplify the tax system is
well taken. It is the likely Reagan administration
proposal we question.
The answer is to make the current progressive
tax just that, a progressive tax without the
availability of tax shelters and deductions that
benefit only the wealthy.
