## A 						new beginning 
### 
On a calm July evening in San
Francisco, two candidates stood
smiling on a podium as the song
"Here Comes the Turn of the Tide"
blared over the loudspeakers of the
Moscone Convention Center. Given
the electoral results of a week ago,
one might question the appropriate
ness of such lyrics as a Democratic
rallying call rather than as an unin
tended prophecy. For Democratic
candidates Walter Mondale and
Geraldine Ferraro, the tide turned
out to be more of an undertow.
Shrewd observers could justifiably
view President Reagan's 1980 victory
as a mere consequence of the nation's
antipathy toward former President
Jimmy Carter (just as they could ac
count for former President Franklin
Roosevelt's 1932 landslide by the
negative perception of then incum
bent Herbert Hoover). Today, the
same people — particularly those
within the Democratic Party — would
be gravely mistaken to attribute the
1984 election solely to personal
popularity and carefully calculated
media techniques. Indeed, many
Democratic candidates dismissed the
Reagan re-election as an affirmation
of personality (as opposed to sub
stance) but simultaneously made cer
tain to include the requisite number
of references to traditional familial
values in their own speeches. For that
matter, makers of miniature Ameri
can flags did not exactly lose business
at the San Francisco convention.
While one need not interpret last
week's results as a broad "mandate,"
the sheer scale of the president's vic
tory should lead us to question the in
ability of significant segments of the
American body politic to view
Reagan as something more than an
archaic anomaly. Can we continue to
label as "extreme" a candidate who
won the support of all age groups,
both sexes, households with incomes
over $ 10,000 and a full 26 percent of
self-described "liberals"? Contrary to
Steve Sharpe's suggested correlation
between intellectual development
and support for Mondale (The Daily,

Nov. 2), the president also carried 63
percent of college graduates.
Why has a figure with such appar
ent national support aroused such bit
ter resentment? To recall one telling
incident: Why, upon being informed
that the president of the United
States had been shot, did one Stan
ford professor of political science flip
pantly remark, "Good!"?
Aside from individual ideology, the
vast majority of the current academic
elite — and virtually all of our parents
— grew up in a political environment

Reagan calls the
'sons and
daughters' of
F.D.R. to account
for their own past.

dominated by Franklin Roosevelt and
his successors. From 1932 to 1980,
the great line of liberal intellectuals
(among them John Kenneth
Galbraith and Justice William Bren
nan) sat as the caretakers of
America's institutions. Together,
they permanently altered the pre
existing conceptions of government's
role in society and of the nation's role
in the world. Most important, they
defined the set of concerns that could
legitimately be placed on the public
agenda. It is not at all surprising,
therefore, that someone who so
deeply questions the efficacy and
moral presuppositions of liberal
policy should encouter such blunt
criticism. Reagan does not merely of
fer different solutions, he sets forth a
fundamentally different set of ques
tions.
The New Deal historians — most
prominently William Leuchtenburg
— neglect to note that the heirs of the

19th-century laissez-faire tradition
viewed Franklin Roosevelt as a
Teflon-coated political trickster who
accomplished his despicable ends
solely through personal charisma and
carefully orchestrated radio ad
dresses. In the current political con
text, such a critique sounds curiously
familiar. While enjoying unprece
dented popularity in 1936, F.D.R.
asked for four more years to com
plete the New Deal; under similar
conditions, Reagan made such a
claim for his "new beginning" in
1984. In his address to the 1936
Democratic convention, Roosevelt
stated that the American people have
a "rendezvous with destiny"; last
Tuesday evening, Reagan may have
had his.
Contrary to the beliefs of many, an
invidious conspiracy of people
dressed in brown penny loafers and
monogrammed sweaters did not bring
Reagan to power. He has encoun
tered vehement opposition for the
simple reason that he calls the "sons
and daughters" of F.D.R. to account
for their own political past. Like
Theodore Lowi in his sweeping 1969
critique of the Great Society aptly
titled "The End of Liberalism,"
Reagan has forced the heirs of the
historic liberal tradition to face the
contradictions and unanticipated con
sequences of their own noblest
aspirations.
If the recent opinion polls of young
people are at all predictive, we may
be the "sons and daughters" of
Reagan. If the tide has indeed turned,
his exposition of the legitimate public
agenda could shape American politics
until the end of the century. We
would be naive students of history,
however, to believe that some charis
matic leader will not hold an un
welcomed mirror to our faces at some
future juncture. We can only hope
that, unlike so many of our elders, we
will respond with thought and reflec
tion rather than denial.

On a calm July evening in San
Francisco, two candidates stood
smiling on a podium as the song
"Here Comes the Turn of the Tide"
blared over the loudspeakers of the
Moscone Convention Center. Given
the electoral results of a week ago,
one might question the appropriate
ness of such lyrics as a Democratic
rallying call rather than as an unin
tended prophecy. For Democratic
candidates Walter Mondale and
Geraldine Ferraro, the tide turned
out to be more of an undertow.
Shrewd observers could justifiably
view President Reagan's 1980 victory
as a mere consequence of the nation's
antipathy toward former President
Jimmy Carter (just as they could ac
count for former President Franklin
Roosevelt's 1932 landslide by the
negative perception of then incum
bent Herbert Hoover). Today, the
same people — particularly those
within the Democratic Party — would
be gravely mistaken to attribute the
1984 election solely to personal
popularity and carefully calculated
media techniques. Indeed, many
Democratic candidates dismissed the
Reagan re-election as an affirmation
of personality (as opposed to sub
stance) but simultaneously made cer
tain to include the requisite number
of references to traditional familial
values in their own speeches. For that
matter, makers of miniature Ameri
can flags did not exactly lose business
at the San Francisco convention.
While one need not interpret last
week's results as a broad "mandate,"
the sheer scale of the president's vic
tory should lead us to question the in
ability of significant segments of the
American body politic to view
Reagan as something more than an
archaic anomaly. Can we continue to
label as "extreme" a candidate who
won the support of all age groups,
both sexes, households with incomes
over $ 10,000 and a full 26 percent of
self-described "liberals"? Contrary to
Steve Sharpe's suggested correlation
between intellectual development
and support for Mondale (The Daily,

Nov. 2), the president also carried 63
percent of college graduates.
Why has a figure with such appar
ent national support aroused such bit
ter resentment? To recall one telling
incident: Why, upon being informed
that the president of the United
States had been shot, did one Stan
ford professor of political science flip
pantly remark, "Good!"?
Aside from individual ideology, the
vast majority of the current academic
elite — and virtually all of our parents
— grew up in a political environment

Reagan calls the
'sons and
daughters' of
F.D.R. to account
for their own past.

dominated by Franklin Roosevelt and
his successors. From 1932 to 1980,
the great line of liberal intellectuals
(among them John Kenneth
Galbraith and Justice William Bren
nan) sat as the caretakers of
America's institutions. Together,
they permanently altered the pre
existing conceptions of government's
role in society and of the nation's role
in the world. Most important, they
defined the set of concerns that could
legitimately be placed on the public
agenda. It is not at all surprising,
therefore, that someone who so
deeply questions the efficacy and
moral presuppositions of liberal
policy should encouter such blunt
criticism. Reagan does not merely of
fer different solutions, he sets forth a
fundamentally different set of ques
tions.
The New Deal historians — most
prominently William Leuchtenburg
— neglect to note that the heirs of the

19th-century laissez-faire tradition
viewed Franklin Roosevelt as a
Teflon-coated political trickster who
accomplished his despicable ends
solely through personal charisma and
carefully orchestrated radio ad
dresses. In the current political con
text, such a critique sounds curiously
familiar. While enjoying unprece
dented popularity in 1936, F.D.R.
asked for four more years to com
plete the New Deal; under similar
conditions, Reagan made such a
claim for his "new beginning" in
1984. In his address to the 1936
Democratic convention, Roosevelt
stated that the American people have
a "rendezvous with destiny"; last
Tuesday evening, Reagan may have
had his.
Contrary to the beliefs of many, an
invidious conspiracy of people
dressed in brown penny loafers and
monogrammed sweaters did not bring
Reagan to power. He has encoun
tered vehement opposition for the
simple reason that he calls the "sons
and daughters" of F.D.R. to account
for their own political past. Like
Theodore Lowi in his sweeping 1969
critique of the Great Society aptly
titled "The End of Liberalism,"
Reagan has forced the heirs of the
historic liberal tradition to face the
contradictions and unanticipated con
sequences of their own noblest
aspirations.
If the recent opinion polls of young
people are at all predictive, we may
be the "sons and daughters" of
Reagan. If the tide has indeed turned,
his exposition of the legitimate public
agenda could shape American politics
until the end of the century. We
would be naive students of history,
however, to believe that some charis
matic leader will not hold an un
welcomed mirror to our faces at some
future juncture. We can only hope
that, unlike so many of our elders, we
will respond with thought and reflec
