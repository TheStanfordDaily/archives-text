## War games in Nicaragua 
### 
Over the last week, the United States has intensified
pressure on Nicaragua, put into motion military units and
made clear that the United States will either quarantine or
attack Nicaragua if it does not submit to U.S.
directives.The movements of the 101 stand 82nd Air
borne divisions, members of which have landed in Hon
duras as of Monday, Nov. 12, are said to be part of a
prescheduled military exercise, revealingly dubbed
"Operation Quickthrust." Moreover, in a purportedly
unrelated exercise, 25 U.S. Navy warships, excluding the
frigates and destroyers patrolling the Nicaraguan coasts,
are operating in the Caribbean. If such military move
ments were in fact exercises, as the Reagan administration
and Pentagon claim, it would be in international security

VIEWPOINT

interests to suspend those exercises to avoid involving the
Soviet Union in the already critically dangerous Central
American crisis, largely created by what prove now to be
false allegations that the Soviet Union had shipped MiGs
to Nicaragua.
Since the Reagan administration has determined MiGs
have not been shipped to Nicaragua, it claims that any in
creased shipments of defensive arms to Nicaragua will
destabilize the balance of military power in the region.
Thus, the administration proposed on Saturday, according
to The New York Times, the possibility of interdicting
arms shipments, increasing the size and frequency of mili
tary maneuvers in Central America, and resuming aid to
the Nicaraguan contras, the U.S.-financed and supported
rebels who are conducting a major military assault on
Nicaragua.
Seeming to forget that it has initiated and escalated an
undeclared U.S. war being fought by proxy forces, the
Reagan administration denies Nicaragua the right to
defend itself against hostile forces. Justifying all of its own
military buildup as a need for military parity with the So
viet Union, the Reagan administration nevertheless wants
the Nicaraguan government to watch complacently as its
northern borders are overrun by CIA-backed rebels and

as the U.S. builds up the military capabilities of neighbor
ing Honduras, El Salvador and Costa Rica. If the United
States really wants Nicaragua to disarm, why doesn't it
stop threatening the Nicaraguan people with false allega
tions, stop supporting the contras, stop interfering with
Nicaragua's economy and stop its efforts to thwart the
Contadora peace plan?
Who, indeed, is upsetting the military balance in
Central America, and particularly in Nicaragua, if not the
United States with its support, direct and indirect, of the
contras? Who is terrorizing the people of Nicaragua, with
overflights of supersonic aircraft, if not the United States?
Who is currently negotiating to increase the ground and
air capabilities of the Honduran military, if not the United
States? And who is trying to build a joint U.S. Navy/Air
Force base on the Caribbean coast of Honduras capable
of maintaining 1,000 U.S. soldiers, if not the United
States? These recent acts of U.S. aggression and proposals
to maintain a "Fortress Honduras" intimidate the
Nicaraguan people, put constraints upon the Nicaraguan
economy by forcing them to spend money on defense
rather than upon domestic welfare and growth projects,
jeopardize peace in Central America and intensify the
animosity between the United States and the Soviet
Union.
We must do whatever we can to prevent a U.S. military
incursion into Nicaragua, whether by U.S. or by proxy
forces. The Reagan administration must give Nicaragua's
fledgling democracy the same oppportunity it has ex
tended to El Salvador, Guatemala and other "client" na
tions to survive in a friendly rather than in a hostile
environment. You can help prevent the Reagan machine
from inflicting further damage on the sovereign people of
Nicaragua by writing letters to your elected representa
tives, supporting local Central America solidarity groups
and keeping well-informed. If it is true that the war in
Central America is more brutally efficient than the Viet
nam War, the war at home is likely to be more brutal too.
Let's stop them both by peaceful means right now before
they escalate out of control.
