Selective divestiture
Following the overwhelming vic
tory of the student referendum on
apartheid, it is essential to clarify,
once again, its major purpose and
meaning. Specifically, we would like
to respond to University Vice Presi
dent William Massy's recent view
point "Full divestiture not feasible"
(The Daily, Oct. 31).
Clearly, the referendum does not
request full divestiture. It requests
selective divestiture from those
companies that engage in the most
blatant instances of corporate abuse
in South Africa.
Massy acknowledges that the
University "interprets the ASSU
referendum as advocating selective
divestiture." Yet, it is regrettable he
combines arguments against full
divestment with the request of the
referendum, which confuses the
issues.
In contrast to full divestment,
selective divestiture from Motorola
Corp. and similar worst-offenders
cannot be expected to entail financial
losses. There exist equally attractive
financial alternatives to such invest
ments. (The diversification of Stan
ford's portfolio would not be
seriously hurt; stocks of other com
panies have similar expected rates of
return.)
Further, Motorola itself has
repeatedly stated that it will continue
its sales of equipment to South
African police and military. While
we may lose the right to express our

disapproval of Motorola's policies
within the company, shareholder
efforts have not proven useful in the
past toward changing company
policy and — according to Motorola
— these efforts will not be more
effective in the future.
Directly addressing the referen
dum, Massy writes that Stanford
"already has a responsible invest
ment policy" and rightfully states
that University guidelines for the
Commission on Investment Respon
sibility provide for the possibility of
selective divestiture. We welcome
this renewed commitment to a
selective divestment policy.
However, it is doubtful to what
extent such a theoretical commit
ment is valuable and expedient given
the fact that — and this point cannot
be overemphasized — Stanford has
never in its history divested from a
company operating in South Africa.
Specifically, it seems particularly
incomprehensible that the University
continues investing in the one com
pany that displays the most obvious
and the most blatant indifference to
the suffering of the vast majority of
the population there.
Thus, while we have a policy of
selective divestment in theory, we
obviously do not yet have such a
policy in practice. Assuming that the
University's commitment to selective
divestment is sincere, the obvious
and inevitable conclusion is that the
University has failed to act on behalf
of its good intentions and to establish
guidelines that are specific enough to
provide for a responsible investment

policy in practice.
If we want to live up to the ethical
principles and the good intentions of
this University, we have to take
action. Unless moral commitments
reflect upon our behavior, they are
worthless, ineffective and likely to
raise unnecessary and embarrassing
suspicions of sophism and hypocrisy.
We deserve better than that.

President Reagan, the great com
municator, deserves an Emmy award
for his great performance as a presi
dential leader. I predict that disillu
sionment will set in early as hopes
for a lasting improved economy
recede and taxes are increased.
A columnist recently reported
seeing, at press conferences, a "73-
year-old man teeter in the outer edge
of his intellect as he struggled with a
question" and in horror watched him
"wobble on the brink of intellectual
disintegration, a blank look in his
eyes and incoherent words on his
lips."
The public, on television, saw only
a smiling, confident, kindly, young
looking father figure who exuded
hope and optimism for the future.
He revived pride in ourselves and
America. Through his personal

leadership, we have regained our
unchallenged dominance in the
world; never again would we allow
our military superiority to dwindle.
We again have the power to com
mand allegiance from all nations in
the world — or else. Our triumphant
invasion and conquest of Grenada
demonstrated our will to use the
great military force in the world to
secure our way of life for others.
I recall the early 1930s in Berlin.
Millions of people, especially the
young, worshipfully rallied around
the cult of Hitler. For them, he was a
loving father figure who rose from
the ranks as their leader. He was
strong and powerful. He promised
them a glorious economic and politi
cal future. Under the slogan of
"Deutschland Über Alles" he made
them feel important and superior.
They were ready to lay down their
lives in a crusade against the source
of all evil — the Soviet Union and
communists which, of course, in
cluded all Jews.
Today, Reagan has popularized
"Amerika Over All." His rhetoric
against the Soviet Union as the evil
empire sounds no different from
what 1 heard in Germany more than
50 years ago. But it is infinitely more
frightening in this nuclear age.
I predict that Reagan's
honeymoon with the people will be
shortlived and his term will end in
ignominy. 1 predict history will judge
him to have been the most ignorant
president in recent times.
