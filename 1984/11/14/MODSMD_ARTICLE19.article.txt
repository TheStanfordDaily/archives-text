## Green mutation that is a dancing tree 
### GREGORY WEINGARTEN Staff writer 
At first glance, the coniferous ob
ject bopping up and down to the beat
of the Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity Marching Band appears to be
some green mutation. Upon closer in
spection, it looks like a cross between
Cousin It and the Jolly Green Giant.
What is this curious species? It's the
official band mascot — the Stanford
tree.
When the football team's name was
changed from the Indians to Card
inal, the band was faced with the
problem of finding a new mascot.

"You can't really present a color
out on the field very well," explained
this year's tree, Mardi Dier.
The tree was chosen after a series
of votes by Band members and today
adds to the Band's fun, unconventional
image as well as representing the red
wood tree used in the University's
emblem.
"It's just a pretty fun symbol and I
think everyone for the most part en
joys it," Dier said.
"Once in a while you get people
who have been partying a little, and
they say, 'Whoah, we don't like the

tree,' and on and on — but that's all
part of it. You can't please everyone
all the time. You just have fun with
the ones you can please," she said.
Often, people not associated with
the University aren't immediately
sure what the dancing tree is
supposed to be, but Dier said that
adds to the fun. "The stares you get
are just hilarious. Some kids just love
it. Others run away not knowing what
the thing is."
The tree's life span far exceeds
football season. The tree is expected
to join the Band at basketball games.

The tree also participates in on- and
off-campus rallies which usually num
ber two or three a week.
Dier admits that the role of the tree
is demanding, but she sees the experi
ence as a positive one. "It's a one
year shot, something I'll never do
again and something I'll laugh about
when I tell my kids in future years. So
why not give it all you have? At least,
that's the way I've been rationalizing
not doing all my studying," she said.
Tryouts for the new tree are held in
February and consist of questions
from the incumbent tree and inter
views with Band members. The tree's
term starts at the end of basketball
season and ends with the completion
of the following year's basketball
season. Dier said that the tryouts are
relaxed and informal. About 30
people applied for the position last
year.
According to Dier, the two
qualities essential for the job are en
ergy and humor.
"People don't take you as a person
but as a thing. They say things and
yell things at you, but you just have to
learn to laugh and just keep bopping
along," she said.
Dier added that being the tree
doesn't require any training except
"just being able to get through the
football games in one piece and still
study for midterms."
Being a tree isn't always glamorous
and carefree. Dier noted that it often
gets very hot inside the costume, es
pecially on warm days, and some days
"you just want to take it (the
costume) off while the football game
is going on."
Next season's tree will have a more
comfortable job thanks to Dier who
modified the costume to make it
cooler. Besides being hot, it can also
be a very tiring occupation.
"When we (the Band) were on the
Oklahoma trip last summer, we were
doing rallies two or three times a day,
and sometimes you really don't feel
like doing them.
"For the most part, though, I love
it. People don't know who you are,
and you can kind of do what you
want," she said.
According to Dier, the best part of
being the tree is "getting out there
and dancing with the Band." She
hopes to pick up an instrument this
year so she can stay with the Band
next season and see it from "a differ
ent side."

they say, 'Whoah, we don't like the

tree,' and on and on — but that's all
part of it. You can't please everyone
all the time. You just have fun with
the ones you can please," she said.
Often, people not associated with
the University aren't immediately
sure what the dancing tree is
supposed to be, but Dier said that
adds to the fun. "The stares you get
are just hilarious. Some kids just love
it. Others run away not knowing what
the thing is."
The tree's life span far exceeds
football season. The tree is expected
to join the Band at basketball games.

The tree also participates in on- and
off-campus rallies which usually num
ber two or three a week.
Dier admits that the role of the tree
is demanding, but she sees the experi
ence as a positive one. "It's a one
year shot, something I'll never do
again and something I'll laugh about
when I tell my kids in future years. So
why not give it all you have? At least,
that's the way I've been rationalizing
not doing all my studying," she said.
Tryouts for the new tree are held in
February and consist of questions
from the incumbent tree and inter
views with Band members. The tree's
term starts at the end of basketball
season and ends with the completion
of the following year's basketball
season. Dier said that the tryouts are
relaxed and informal. About 30
people applied for the position last
year.
According to Dier, the two
qualities essential for the job are en
ergy and humor.
"People don't take you as a person
but as a thing. They say things and
yell things at you, but you just have to
learn to laugh and just keep bopping
along," she said.
Dier added that being the tree
doesn't require any training except
"just being able to get through the
football games in one piece and still
study for midterms."
Being a tree isn't always glamorous
and carefree. Dier noted that it often
gets very hot inside the costume, es
pecially on warm days, and some days
"you just want to take it (the
costume) off while the football game
is going on."
Next season's tree will have a more
comfortable job thanks to Dier who
modified the costume to make it
cooler. Besides being hot, it can also
be a very tiring occupation.
"When we (the Band) were on the
Oklahoma trip last summer, we were
doing rallies two or three times a day,
and sometimes you really don't feel
like doing them.
"For the most part, though, I love
it. People don't know who you are,
and you can kind of do what you
want," she said.
According to Dier, the best part of
being the tree is "getting out there
and dancing with the Band." She
hopes to pick up an instrument this
year so she can stay with the Band
next season and see it from "a differ
ent side."

The tree, the Band's mascot, entered into marital bliss with drum major, Jim Kohn, earlier this year.

This year's Stanford tree, Mardi Dier, is seen here without her familiar
green get-up. Some have said the costume more closely resembles a
large pickle.
