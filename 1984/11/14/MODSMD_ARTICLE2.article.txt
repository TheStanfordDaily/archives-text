# Activist warns of nuclear danger
## 
### LYNN MARCUS Staff writer 
A leading activist for nuclear disarmament
pleaded with students at Branner Hall last night to
start "changing the priorities in your lives" and
working to save the world from the danger of nu
clear holocaust.
Drawing heated questions and comments from
the large audience, Helen Caldicott, a key figure in
Physicians for Social Responsibility (PSR),
showered students with a barrage of facts,
anecdotes and opinions regarding the arms race.
Caldicott, an Australian who quit her job as a
pediatrician several years ago to galvanize public
support for disarmament, emphasized the daily
danger of the destruction of all life on Earth due to
computer malfunctions or irrational actions on the
part of senile or insane leaders.
"We live in a world wound up like a ticking time
bomb, ready to explode any minute," she said.
The response to Caldicott's speech engendered.

as she said in an interview afterward, "more hostil
ity than usual." Several students pushed the
speaker for concrete suggestions for de-escalation
and alternative defense policies.
"If (President) Reagan had the courage," she
said, "he could get a freeze within six months."
Caldicott said the Soviet leadership is currently
"desperate to negotiate" but warned that the
United States must hurry because Soviet Premier
Constantin Chernenko is ill and"the next leaders
may not be [eager to negotiate]."
She suggested that U.S. and Soviet leaders
proceed by negotiating a 50 percent bilateral cut in
the nuclear arsenal and "stop arguing about who's
got the best ones or which ones [to cut] — just do
it."
Calling Silicon Valley "the valley of death," Cal
dicott warned students that "you're a number one
target" and proceeded to describe graphically the
effects a nuclear bomb would cause to people and
buildings were it to explode on the Stanford

campus.
She told of the suffering experienced by the vic
tims of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima, saying
that at a certain distance from the detonation,
people's "eyes melt and run down their cheeks,"
and she mentioned a woman and her baby who had
been "charcoalized."
Caldicott urged students to "extrapolate to your
own lives, personalize it and know it could happen
to you every day."
Making frequent use of metaphors of physical
and psychological illness throughout her talk, Cal
dicott spoke of a "national psychic numbing" of the
American public to the dangers of the arms race
and of insane and "pre-nuclear thinking" on the
part of U.S. and Soviet leaders.
She asserted that the media bears much of the re
sponsibility for public ignorance and complacency
because it fails to grant adequate coverage to the is-
sues involved in the arms race.
For example, she said, one com
puter malfunction put the United
States on "red alert," and brought the
world "13 minutes from nuclear
war," yet the story about the incident
was buried in the inside pages of The
New York Times.
Caldicott said a recent study of
malfunctions by American surveil
lance computers found that 151
serious errors had taken place over an
18-month period, and she added that
the Soviet computers are less sophis
ticated.
Caldicott also criticized Americans
for their hubris and ethnocentricity,
attitudes which she said are helping to
fuel the arms race. "You're holding
the whole of life on Earth as hostage
with this crazy argument about who's
the best," she said, pointing out that
92 percent of humanity lives outside

of the United States and the Soviet
Union.
She compared the superpowers to
"nine-year-old boys playing in a
sandbox arguing over whose
(sandcastle) is the best."
Reagan's policies also came under
attack. Caldicott said that the admin
istration has plans "to fight and win a
nuclear war over a protracted, six
month period."
In a meeting between the physician
and Reagan, which was arranged by
his daughter, Maureen, Caldicott said
the president displayed a complete
lack of comprehension about nuclear
weapons and weapon systems as well
as "clinical paranoia" about the So
viet Union.
One student defended the preven
tion of nuclear war by the concept of
mutual deterrence and asked Cal
dicott how the United States could
defend Western Europe without the
threat of a nuclear attack to deter the
Soviets from invading.
"You're using pre-nuclear think
ing," Caldicott said, insisting that nu

clear weapons have made war ob
solete.
She added, "The dictum says if you
don't like the guy in the other end of
your lifeboat, you don't drill a whole
in his end to fix him."
Another problem with deterrence,
she said, is that "you assume sanity
on the part of the leaders." Caldicott
said that U.S. and Soviet leaders are
old men and "old men do erratic
things."
Another student, who identified
himself as a member of the armed
forces, reacted with hostility to her
approach, telling Caldicott, "If you
can, with your physician's back
ground, come up with a way of chang
ing human nature, I'm all for it."

got the best ones or which ones [to cut] — just do
it."
Calling Silicon Valley "the valley of death," Cal
dicott warned students that "you're a number one
target" and proceeded to describe graphically the
effects a nuclear bomb would cause to people and
buildings were it to explode on the Stanford

campus.
She told of the suffering experienced by the vic
tims of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima, saying
that at a certain distance from the detonation,
people's "eyes melt and run down their cheeks,"
and she mentioned a woman and her baby who had
been "charcoalized."
Caldicott urged students to "extrapolate to your
own lives, personalize it and know it could happen
to you every day."
Making frequent use of metaphors of physical
and psychological illness throughout her talk, Cal
dicott spoke of a "national psychic numbing" of the
American public to the dangers of the arms race
and of insane and "pre-nuclear thinking" on the
part of U.S. and Soviet leaders.
She asserted that the media bears much of the re
sponsibility for public ignorance and complacency
because it fails to grant adequate coverage to the is-
sues involved in the arms race.
For example, she said, one com
puter malfunction put the United
States on "red alert," and brought the
world "13 minutes from nuclear
war," yet the story about the incident
was buried in the inside pages of The
New York Times.
Caldicott said a recent study of
malfunctions by American surveil
lance computers found that 151
serious errors had taken place over an
18-month period, and she added that
the Soviet computers are less sophis
ticated.
Caldicott also criticized Americans
for their hubris and ethnocentricity,
attitudes which she said are helping to
fuel the arms race. "You're holding
the whole of life on Earth as hostage
with this crazy argument about who's
the best," she said, pointing out that
92 percent of humanity lives outside

of the United States and the Soviet
Union.
She compared the superpowers to
"nine-year-old boys playing in a
sandbox arguing over whose
(sandcastle) is the best."
Reagan's policies also came under
attack. Caldicott said that the admin
istration has plans "to fight and win a
nuclear war over a protracted, six
month period."
In a meeting between the physician
and Reagan, which was arranged by
his daughter, Maureen, Caldicott said
the president displayed a complete
lack of comprehension about nuclear
weapons and weapon systems as well
as "clinical paranoia" about the So
viet Union.
One student defended the preven
tion of nuclear war by the concept of
mutual deterrence and asked Cal
dicott how the United States could
defend Western Europe without the
threat of a nuclear attack to deter the
Soviets from invading.
"You're using pre-nuclear think
ing," Caldicott said, insisting that nu

clear weapons have made war ob
solete.
She added, "The dictum says if you
don't like the guy in the other end of
your lifeboat, you don't drill a whole
in his end to fix him."
Another problem with deterrence,
she said, is that "you assume sanity
on the part of the leaders." Caldicott
said that U.S. and Soviet leaders are
old men and "old men do erratic
things."
Another student, who identified
himself as a member of the armed
forces, reacted with hostility to her
approach, telling Caldicott, "If you
can, with your physician's back
ground, come up with a way of chang
ing human nature, I'm all for it."
A leading activist for nuclear disarmament
pleaded with students at Branner Hall last night to
start "changing the priorities in your lives" and
working to save the world from the danger of nu
clear holocaust.
Drawing heated questions and comments from
the large audience, Helen Caldicott, a key figure in
Physicians for Social Responsibility (PSR),
showered students with a barrage of facts,
anecdotes and opinions regarding the arms race.
Caldicott, an Australian who quit her job as a
pediatrician several years ago to galvanize public
support for disarmament, emphasized the daily
danger of the destruction of all life on Earth due to
computer malfunctions or irrational actions on the
part of senile or insane leaders.
"We live in a world wound up like a ticking time
bomb, ready to explode any minute," she said.
The response to Caldicott's speech engendered.

as she said in an interview afterward, "more hostil
ity than usual." Several students pushed the
speaker for concrete suggestions for de-escalation
and alternative defense policies.
"If (President) Reagan had the courage," she
said, "he could get a freeze within six months."
Caldicott said the Soviet leadership is currently
"desperate to negotiate" but warned that the
United States must hurry because Soviet Premier
Constantin Chernenko is ill and"the next leaders
may not be [eager to negotiate]."
She suggested that U.S. and Soviet leaders
proceed by negotiating a 50 percent bilateral cut in
the nuclear arsenal and "stop arguing about who's
got the best ones or which ones [to cut] — just do
it."
