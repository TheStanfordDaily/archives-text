### LYNN MARCUS Staff writer 
A leading activist for nuclear disarmament
pleaded with students at Branner Hall last night to
start "changing the priorities in your lives" and
working to save the world from the danger of nu
clear holocaust.
Drawing heated questions and comments from
the large audience, Helen Caldicott, a key figure in
Physicians for Social Responsibility (PSR),
showered students with a barrage of facts,
anecdotes and opinions regarding the arms race.
Caldicott, an Australian who quit her job as a
pediatrician several years ago to galvanize public
support for disarmament, emphasized the daily
danger of the destruction of all life on Earth due to
computer malfunctions or irrational actions on the
part of senile or insane leaders.
"We live in a world wound up like a ticking time
bomb, ready to explode any minute," she said.
The response to Caldicott's speech engendered.

as she said in an interview afterward, "more hostil
ity than usual." Several students pushed the
speaker for concrete suggestions for de-escalation
and alternative defense policies.
"If (President) Reagan had the courage," she
said, "he could get a freeze within six months."
Caldicott said the Soviet leadership is currently
"desperate to negotiate" but warned that the
United States must hurry because Soviet Premier
Constantin Chernenko is ill and"the next leaders
may not be [eager to negotiate]."
She suggested that U.S. and Soviet leaders
proceed by negotiating a 50 percent bilateral cut in
the nuclear arsenal and "stop arguing about who's
got the best ones or which ones [to cut] â€” just do
it."
Calling Silicon Valley "the valley of death," Cal
dicott warned students that "you're a number one
target" and proceeded to describe graphically the
effects a nuclear bomb would cause to people and
buildings were it to explode on the Stanford

campus.
She told of the suffering experienced by the vic
tims of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima, saying
that at a certain distance from the detonation,
people's "eyes melt and run down their cheeks,"
and she mentioned a woman and her baby who had
been "charcoalized."
Caldicott urged students to "extrapolate to your
own lives, personalize it and know it could happen
to you every day."
Making frequent use of metaphors of physical
and psychological illness throughout her talk, Cal
dicott spoke of a "national psychic numbing" of the
American public to the dangers of the arms race
and of insane and "pre-nuclear thinking" on the
part of U.S. and Soviet leaders.
She asserted that the media bears much of the re
sponsibility for public ignorance and complacency
because it fails to grant adequate coverage to the is-
