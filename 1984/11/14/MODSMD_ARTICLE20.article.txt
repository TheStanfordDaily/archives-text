# Group tries to resurrect alma mater
## 
### 
Some students here conjeeture that there is such prestige associated
with Stanford that there is little need for traditional displays of school
spirit. In this atmosphere a group on campus, which is trying to resurrect
the traditional school song, is asking itself whether there is a place today
for a Stanford alma mater.
This year there is a campus-wide effort, led by senior Vipool Patel, to
spread the lyrics and tune to prepare for the traditional post-game singing
of the alma mater at Big Game. The Band plays "Hail, Stanford Hail" at
the end of every game, win or lose, and will do do so again on Saturday.
The ASSU is sponsoring the printing of lyrics to he distributed to dormi
tories by resident assistants.
Alma mater, meaning "Fostering Mother" in Latin, refers to one's
school or school theme song. According to Patel, many students who
know the proper time to jump during "All Right Now" probably wouldn't
even recognize "Hail, Stanford Hail."
Stanford's slumbering alma mater awakens at occasional reunions and
at the annual Alumni-Varsity football game, but the main question, ac
cording to Patel, is whether or not the alma mater can make its way back
into the minds and voices of today's Stanford community. He said that
many are hoping and expecting "Hail, Stanford Hail' to return in full
force.
Yesterday at 5:20 p.m., k/.SU hosted a live show featuring the Men
dicants singing the alma mater and various other selections. Student Arts
at Stanford (STARTS) is sponsoring a noon "Hail, Stanford Hail" concert
at Tresidder with both Counterpoint and The Fleet Street Singers per
forming.
"Hail, Stanford Hail" was written in 1893, only two years after Stan
ford opened. Therefore, the three stanzas and refrain make no mention of
long- standing tradition, reputation or past generations, but rather focus
on the beauty of the area. Rolling foothills, tender vistas through arches
and red roofs which rim the sky are mentioned in the song.
The words were written by A.W. Smith, the first dean of engineering at
Stanford. This year the Stanford Engineering Association, a student-run
organization which funds engineering and other projects, is paying for the
10,000 copies of lyrics to be distributed at Big Game.
Patel, who is majoring in industrial engineering and economics, said,
"This project is the combined effort of many groups, and the alma mater
will return only if the entire Stanford community sings and works to
gether." Although Patel said that he is unsure of all of his motivations for
this endeavor, he said that one factor is his Christian beliefs. "I do not ex
pect the alma mater to change anyone's life, but the Bible teaches that
people are to bring healing, joy and unity to the world." he said.
How will anyone know if the alma mater has successfully returned to
campus? Patel said it is unrealistic to judge its success by how loud people
sing at Big Game. "Maybe success can be determined if the alma mater
shows up during basketball season or lasts until the Stanford Centennial.
Whether or not it returns, perhaps the most important victory is that, at
least for this year, Stanford's school spirit is bolstered because an effort is
being made," Patel said.
