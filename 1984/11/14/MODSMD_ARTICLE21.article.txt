Silly Party takes charge
Student government at Northwestern Uni
versity is, or at least should be, the envy of
students everywhere.
In last spring's student government elec
tions at Northwestern, a new political force
emerged on campus with the election of the
Silly Party. The Silly Party grabbed the reins
of student government with a platform calling
for a 24-hour hardware store in the student
union and Twister games on the campus' Li
brary Plaza.
From reports in the Daily Northwestern,
the Silly Party seems to have a much more
desirable approach to student government
than Stanford's ASSU.
For example, compare the themes of the
ASSU Council of Presidents (COP) with
those of the Silly Party. The COP's theme of

People, Projects and Participation seems to
be a bit too ambitious compared to the Silly
Party's more modest themes of "projectiles"
and"beer."
The ASSU Senate distributes 30-item
agendas for meetings where senators will
debate the grammatical rectitude of constitu
tional amendments. The Silly Party does not
try to appear busy considering important is

sues — at the first student government
meeting this fall, there was absolutely no
legislation on the agenda.
And, while the ASSU Senate tries to
dredge up significant questions to ask Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy, the Silly
Party takes a much more casual approach.
When Northwestern's new university presi
dent was to meet with student government
president Andy Mozina in September,
Mozina told the Daily Northwestern, "We're
just going to talk about the kind of working
relationship we're going to have with the ad
ministration — maybe invite him to a party or
have him come over for a game of Twister or
something."
Kennedy for president
Donald Kennedy for president?
In an interesting interview with The Santa
Clara, campus newspaper of the University of
California at Santa Clara, former U.S. Con
gressman Pete McCloskey said that "Donald
Kennedy, the president of Stanford, would
make a superb president."
McCloskey, who received bachelor and law
degrees from Stanford and used to teach a
class at Stanford, also compared Stanford stu
dents with students at the University of Santa
Clara.
"The difference is the freshness and the
willingness to debate down here .... By the
time you get into Stanford, you are led to
believe that you are the smartest person in the
world, and maybe you don't need to go to
Stanford. You don't find that at Santa Clara.
The people at Santa Clara are generally pretty
happy to be at college. It's sort of a happier
search for knowledge than at Stanford," he
said.
Assassin game dies
A game of "Assassin" almost turned into
the real thing at Northwestern University in
Evanston, 111.
One student, stalking his target with a toy
gun outside a dormitory, was almost shot by
an officer from the Evanston Police Depart
ment after the department received a call
from an "anonymous citizen reporting the
sighting of a man with a gun," according to
The Daily Northwestern.
When the police arrived, a policeman im
mediately leaped from a squad car, drew his

gun on the student holding the toy gun and
shouted, "Drop the gun and put your hands
against the car," the student with the gun said.
Another player in the game was walking
toward the dorm at the time, and was told to
"Throw the gun down," by a policeman.
"One policeman kept saying over and o 1 er
that if the boy he was pointing his gun at had
moved, he would have had to shoot him,"
Northwestern freshman Shanta Doss told The
Daily Northwestern.
In the game, students are assigned victims
to stalk and "kill" before they themselves are
killed. The last person alive wins the game.
After the police identified the students,
they advised them to publicly end the game,
and the dorm sponsoring the game complied.
The phantom student
Tired of writing those law school applica
tions? Blow it off.
Stephen Travis attended classes at Harvard
Law School for over a month this fall before
administrators discovered that he was not en
rolled.

Travis was denied admission more than
three times before he simply began attending
classes.
Travis, described by a fellow student as "a
smart guy," entered classes by telling profes
sors he h4d enrolled late, off the waiting list.
His less than legal presence was only dis
covered when an instructor shifted students
from one class to another, and the school
found paper work on every student but
Travis.
Travis was always well dressed and "spoke
more often than anyone in class," said first
year law student Michael Anderson.
A school official expects Travis to re-apply
next year, but Travis has written a letter to
Harvard President Derek Bok contending
that his classroom performance should gain
him admission now.
Cash for 'thin letters'
Speaking of admissions, at the University of
California at Berkeley, you could earn $100
for writing a good rejection letter.
The Daily Californian reports that the
Berkeley Office of Admissions is sponsoring a
contest, with $100 for the winner, to see who
can best tell prospective students that they
have been denied admission.
By all appearances, entrants need not be
Berkeley students, so how about a submission
from Stanford?
Dear Belinda,
The University of Berkeley Office of Ad
missions and Records regrets to inform you
that you are not good enough to be a weenie.
Tempted as we were by your talent in both
football and music, we do not want you.
Your high school band director has in
formed us that your marching style is less than
militaristic and has told us of a disturbing af
finity for creativity and fun that would simply
not float here.
No, Belinda, if you must play Rolling
Stones songs, you will not play in our band.
In addition, we found your aptitude in foot
ball rather disturbing. The Teddy Bears, er,
Golden Bears need a few good men to im
prove on our 1984 Big Game humiliation at
the hands of the Cardinal. We are aware of
your strength and size, but we were worried
that you would destroy the few good men we

currently have and demoralize the rest.
As per your request, however, we will for
ward your application to Stanford. We wish
you luck in gaining admission there.
Thanks, but no thanks,
Robert Bailey, director of Admissions and
Records.
Football theme house
If you think your dorm is loud, you should
try living under a football stadium.
The University of Arizona's Navajo Hall,
built into the south end of Arizona Stadium,
has 45,000 weekend visitors that are un
doubtedly louder than a Stanford dorm will
ever be.
"Having thousands of screaming and often
drunk football fans only a couple feet over
head is a little much," writes one Navajo resi
dent in the Arizona Daily Wildcat.
"The stomping and shuffling of feet on my
roof seemed never-ending. Ever have a herd
of elephants walk on your head? For hours?"
he continued.
Finally, having had enough, the resident
left the house, but the noise continued. "It
took awhile before the ringing of cowbells and
the shouting of drunks faded from my ears."

tions? Blow it off.
Stephen Travis attended classes at Harvard
Law School for over a month this fall before
administrators discovered that he was not en
rolled.

Travis was denied admission more than
three times before he simply began attending
classes.
Travis, described by a fellow student as "a
smart guy," entered classes by telling profes
sors he h4d enrolled late, off the waiting list.
His less than legal presence was only dis
covered when an instructor shifted students
from one class to another, and the school
found paper work on every student but
Travis.
Travis was always well dressed and "spoke
more often than anyone in class," said first
year law student Michael Anderson.
A school official expects Travis to re-apply
next year, but Travis has written a letter to
Harvard President Derek Bok contending
that his classroom performance should gain
him admission now.
Cash for 'thin letters'
Speaking of admissions, at the University of
California at Berkeley, you could earn $100
for writing a good rejection letter.
The Daily Californian reports that the
Berkeley Office of Admissions is sponsoring a
contest, with $100 for the winner, to see who
can best tell prospective students that they
have been denied admission.
By all appearances, entrants need not be
Berkeley students, so how about a submission
from Stanford?
Dear Belinda,
The University of Berkeley Office of Ad
missions and Records regrets to inform you
that you are not good enough to be a weenie.
Tempted as we were by your talent in both
football and music, we do not want you.
Your high school band director has in
formed us that your marching style is less than
militaristic and has told us of a disturbing af
finity for creativity and fun that would simply
not float here.
No, Belinda, if you must play Rolling
Stones songs, you will not play in our band.
In addition, we found your aptitude in foot
ball rather disturbing. The Teddy Bears, er,
Golden Bears need a few good men to im
prove on our 1984 Big Game humiliation at
the hands of the Cardinal. We are aware of
your strength and size, but we were worried
that you would destroy the few good men we

currently have and demoralize the rest.
As per your request, however, we will for
ward your application to Stanford. We wish
you luck in gaining admission there.
Thanks, but no thanks,
Robert Bailey, director of Admissions and
Records.
Football theme house
If you think your dorm is loud, you should
try living under a football stadium.
The University of Arizona's Navajo Hall,
built into the south end of Arizona Stadium,
has 45,000 weekend visitors that are un
doubtedly louder than a Stanford dorm will
ever be.
"Having thousands of screaming and often
drunk football fans only a couple feet over
head is a little much," writes one Navajo resi
dent in the Arizona Daily Wildcat.
"The stomping and shuffling of feet on my
roof seemed never-ending. Ever have a herd
of elephants walk on your head? For hours?"
he continued.
Finally, having had enough, the resident
left the house, but the noise continued. "It
took awhile before the ringing of cowbells and
the shouting of drunks faded from my ears."




Silly Party takes charge
Student government at Northwestern Uni
versity is, or at least should be, the envy of
students everywhere.
In last spring's student government elec
tions at Northwestern, a new political force
emerged on campus with the election of the
Silly Party. The Silly Party grabbed the reins
of student government with a platform calling
for a 24-hour hardware store in the student
union and Twister games on the campus' Li
brary Plaza.
From reports in the Daily Northwestern,
the Silly Party seems to have a much more
desirable approach to student government
than Stanford's ASSU.
For example, compare the themes of the
ASSU Council of Presidents (COP) with
those of the Silly Party. The COP's theme of

People, Projects and Participation seems to
be a bit too ambitious compared to the Silly
Party's more modest themes of "projectiles"
and"beer."
The ASSU Senate distributes 30-item
agendas for meetings where senators will
debate the grammatical rectitude of constitu
tional amendments. The Silly Party does not
try to appear busy considering important is

sues — at the first student government
meeting this fall, there was absolutely no
legislation on the agenda.
And, while the ASSU Senate tries to
dredge up significant questions to ask Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy, the Silly
Party takes a much more casual approach.
When Northwestern's new university presi
dent was to meet with student government
president Andy Mozina in September,
Mozina told the Daily Northwestern, "We're
just going to talk about the kind of working
relationship we're going to have with the ad
ministration — maybe invite him to a party or
have him come over for a game of Twister or
something."
Kennedy for president
Donald Kennedy for president?
In an interesting interview with The Santa
Clara, campus newspaper of the University of
California at Santa Clara, former U.S. Con
gressman Pete McCloskey said that "Donald
Kennedy, the president of Stanford, would
make a superb president."
McCloskey, who received bachelor and law
degrees from Stanford and used to teach a
class at Stanford, also compared Stanford stu
dents with students at the University of Santa
Clara.
"The difference is the freshness and the
willingness to debate down here .... By the
time you get into Stanford, you are led to
believe that you are the smartest person in the
world, and maybe you don't need to go to
Stanford. You don't find that at Santa Clara.
The people at Santa Clara are generally pretty
happy to be at college. It's sort of a happier
search for knowledge than at Stanford," he
said.
Assassin game dies
A game of "Assassin" almost turned into
the real thing at Northwestern University in
Evanston, 111.
One student, stalking his target with a toy
gun outside a dormitory, was almost shot by
an officer from the Evanston Police Depart
ment after the department received a call
from an "anonymous citizen reporting the
sighting of a man with a gun," according to
The Daily Northwestern.
When the police arrived, a policeman im
mediately leaped from a squad car, drew his

gun on the student holding the toy gun and
shouted, "Drop the gun and put your hands
against the car," the student with the gun said.
Another player in the game was walking
toward the dorm at the time, and was told to
"Throw the gun down," by a policeman.
"One policeman kept saying over and o 1 er
that if the boy he was pointing his gun at had
moved, he would have had to shoot him,"
Northwestern freshman Shanta Doss told The
Daily Northwestern.
In the game, students are assigned victims
to stalk and "kill" before they themselves are
killed. The last person alive wins the game.
After the police identified the students,
they advised them to publicly end the game,
and the dorm sponsoring the game complied.
