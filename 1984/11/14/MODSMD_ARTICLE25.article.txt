## Tom Davis happy; opener upcoming 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
Stanford Basketball Coach Tom
Davis was all smiles yesterday. And
well he should have been.
Ticket sales in Maples Pavilion are
going well — so well that fewer than
140 reserved season tickets in the
7,500-seat pavilion remain available.
And national letter-of-intent day is
here.
Today is the first day basketball
recruits can sign letters of intent to at
tend a university pending their admis
sion. Davis, who is bound by National
Collegiate Athletic Association rules
to keep quiet about his signees until
he has the letters in hand, said he
hopes to make a formal announce
ment later this week or early next
week.
However, a recent story on recruit
ing in The Sporting News predicted
that Stanford would sign three
players — 6-foot-4 Todd Lichti from
Concord, 6-5 Bryan McSweeney
from Southern California, and 6-10,
250-pound Derek Bruton from Gil
roy.
Stanford, which has been practicing
since mid-October, is 10 days away
from its season opener against the
University of California at San Diego
Nov. 24 in Maples Pavilion, which
will probably be sold out to season
ticket holders.
Even with the more expensive
reserved seats nearly sold out, Davis
has decided not to sell more reserved
seats but instead make available more
non-reserved student season tickets.
He also extended the $12 price for
student season tickets until the end of
this month, at which time it will in
crease to $19.
"I want the students here," Davis
said, pointing to the courtside bleach
ers in Maples Pavilion. "They've
been such a big part of the develop
ment of this program."
Davis, however, admitted he has
been surprised with the brisk ticket
sales this year. "I thought with so

many new faces there would be a
dropoff in ticket sales," he said. "But
we're not so much selling Stanford
basketball as the league (the Pacific
10 Conference).
"And we try to keep the prices
down so it stays affordable, and we
don't milk the ticket buyer's every
dollar," Davis said . "It (the expected
sellout) shows that guys like Steve
Odell (Davis' director of marketing)
are really doing their job."
That job includes going to dor
mitory meetings to sell tickets begin
ning tonight. And among those
going into the dorms will be former
National Basketball Association
player Kermit Washington, now a
member of Davis' staff.
"We want to get the marginal
fans," Davis said. "We've already got
the hard-core fans, and now we want
to get the student that wants to go to
just a few games."
Davis also indicated that since tick
ets are selling well this year, there is a
good chance general admission tick
ets will not be available on game
days. Or, in other words, those not
holding a season ticket will have to
stay home.
Like ticket sales, Davis said
practice has been going well. But
unlike ticket sales, the Cardinal is a
little behind schedule. "We're prob
ably a little behind where I hoped we
would be," Davis said. "But I guess
with young guys you can't set any
schedules."
If the opener were today, Davis
said he would start freshman center
Eric Reveno, senior forward Kent
Seymour, junior forward Earl Kober
lein, junior guard Keith Ramee and
sophomore guard Novian Whitsitt,
with junior guard John Williams as
the sixth man.
One reason practice is "a little be
hind" might be the rash of preseason
injuries Cardinal players have suf
fered. However, most players have

just an assortment of bumps and
bruises, and only freshman guard
Scott Meinert remained out of action
at vf»«tf»rdav's practice. Meinert

severely sprained his ankle and will
be in a cast until the end of this week.
Koberlein practiced yesterday after
being out with back problems.
"It's probably because of the inten
sity at practices," Davis said of the in
juries. "The guys are working so hard
to get (starting) positions."
