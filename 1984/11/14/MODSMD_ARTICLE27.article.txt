# Crane, men's soccer team to finish
## Walk-on starter 'steady' player 
### FLAVIO FEFERMAN 
\ Charlie Crane might be the most amazing member of
the Stanford men's soccer team.
Crane not only has succeeded on the field, fighting the
odds of being a walk-on, but off the field as well. Crane, a
biology major, is a Phi Beta Kappa and was accepted last
year to Duke University's medical school. He decided to
take a year off, though, and returned to Stanford as a
fifth-year senior to make use of his final year of athletic
eligibility.
Crane was not recruited while in high school. In fact, he
played tennis until his junior year, when he switched to
soccer. At Stanford, he made the team as a walk-on in the
spring of his freshman year. For the soccer team, spring is
a practice season that gives the coach a chance to look at
new players and prepare the team for the fall season.
Crane does not think that it was a disadvantage to be a
walk-on.
"It was good because there weren't any real high expec
tations," he said. "Some of the recruits come in and
they're Ail-Americans or something and there's a lot of
pressure on them because everybody expects them to be
great. So in that way, it (being a walk-on) was good."
Crane said walk-on tryouts lasted only two days, which is a
short period of time for extensive player evaluation.
Crane didn't play much as a sophomore, but he became
the starting left fullback his junior year. In his first full
season as a starter, he was an All-Pacific Soccer Confer
ence Honorable Mention selection and was voted Stan
ford's Most Improved Player.
This season's defensive line, composed of Crane, stop
per Tom McGannon, sweeper Tom Rafalovich and right
fullback Phil Horvath, has been playing together for the
past two years. "I feel a lot more confident in the guys in
the back line than I do with anybody else," Crane said.
"But the guys I play with are mostly on the left side of the
field, not the back line."
When asked if the Cardinal's defense was the bright
spot of this year's low-scoring team, Crane chose to look
at the team as a whole. "Everybody in the team is solid.
Sometimes we play better defense, and so it would look as
if our defensive line is better than our offensive line. But
the team is a whole. I don't think either stands out.
The defensive line plays an important role in a soccer
team's attack by aiding the front line. In Stanford's game
against Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo Nov. 7, defensive
players scored four points— Crane and Marshall Monroe
had assists, and Tom Rafalovich scored a goal.

Fifth-year senior Charlie Crane, a Phi Beta Kappa who will attend medical school at Duke University next
September, is one of four defensive line players who have been together since last season.
"I think the biggest thing the Stan
ford defense does for the attack is hit
balls tii the forwards that they can
control and run on," Crane said.
"That helps a lot. Another thing that
we do is Phil (Horvath) or myself, we
play outside fullback and overlap
around the sides, come down the
Wing and cross the ball. lom
Rafalovich and Tom McGannon also
go up for set plays, the head balls.
Tom Rafalovich has scored a lot of
goals like that. So there's different
ways that we contribute to the of
fense."
Crane hesitated for a moment
when asked about his characteristics
as a player. "1 think that my best
characteristic is that 1 have good field
vision, and 1 can see who's open and
try to hit (pass to) him. I don't think
I'm a great defender. I like attacking
better than defending.
"I stay back all the time, but what I
enjoy doing more, and what I think
I'm better at. is helping start the of
fense from the back. Starting from
the back gives you a lot of room to at
tack." Crane's liking for attack was

evident in the Stanford alumni game
when he convinced Chris Carlsmith
to play fullback for a while, so he
could have some fun up front.
Although Crane was voted Most
Improved Player two years ago.
Cardinal Head Coach Sam Koch said
he has continued to improve and play
better this season as well. "Charlie
Crane has done a good job of stabiliz
ing the back four. He's played very
steady all season," Koch said.
Crane exhibited a bit of modesty
when he reflected on his play this
season, "I had some great games and
some bad games. ... If 1 have a good
game I don't really stand out, and if I
have a bad game it doesn't really
stand out. It's been a pretty average
season for me. I'm just a steady
player."
Crane said Stanford, 10-7-3,
played to the level of its opponents
this season, often not capitalizing on
its superior talent against weaker
teams and playing well against the
stronger ones.
"I think when we get psyched up
for a game we can play really well. I
think every game has been fun, first
of all. As far as how well we perform
. . . it seems like we make every game
close. Our record has been about the
same for the last four years.

Performance-wise, it's been a pretty
average season — its been a lot of
fun, though."
Crane, who said motivation is a key
factor to the Cardinal's performance,
is optimistic about next season. He
said the return of redshirts Angel
Vazquez and Cassio Conceicao, and
senior Giancarlo Ferruzzi, who still
has one year of eligibility left, will
provide motivation.
"It seems like we have to have
some special motivation to play well,
and I think those guys know it. And I
think next year they'll be good, and
they'll be excited about playing,"
Crane said. "I think the team will do
real well. I hope they have good
recruiting."
There are only two freshmen on
this year's team since the recruiting
was hampered by the coaching
change from Nelson Lodge to Koch.
Crane, though, is still optimistic, "I
think Sam (Koch) will do a good job
in recruiting."
After graduating this quarter.
Crane plans to relax and have a good
time until he enrolls at Duke next
September. "This winter I'm gonna
try to get a job in a ski resort, and
then I'm probably going to travel in
the spring."
