# Crane, men's soccer team to finish
## Walk-on starter 'steady' player 
### FLAVIO FEFERMAN 
\ Charlie Crane might be the most amazing member of
the Stanford men's soccer team.
Crane not only has succeeded on the field, fighting the
odds of being a walk-on, but off the field as well. Crane, a
biology major, is a Phi Beta Kappa and was accepted last
year to Duke University's medical school. He decided to
take a year off, though, and returned to Stanford as a
fifth-year senior to make use of his final year of athletic
eligibility.
Crane was not recruited while in high school. In fact, he
played tennis until his junior year, when he switched to
soccer. At Stanford, he made the team as a walk-on in the
spring of his freshman year. For the soccer team, spring is
a practice season that gives the coach a chance to look at
new players and prepare the team for the fall season.
Crane does not think that it was a disadvantage to be a
walk-on.
"It was good because there weren't any real high expec
tations," he said. "Some of the recruits come in and
they're Ail-Americans or something and there's a lot of
pressure on them because everybody expects them to be
great. So in that way, it (being a walk-on) was good."
Crane said walk-on tryouts lasted only two days, which is a
short period of time for extensive player evaluation.
Crane didn't play much as a sophomore, but he became
the starting left fullback his junior year. In his first full
season as a starter, he was an All-Pacific Soccer Confer
ence Honorable Mention selection and was voted Stan
ford's Most Improved Player.
This season's defensive line, composed of Crane, stop
per Tom McGannon, sweeper Tom Rafalovich and right
fullback Phil Horvath, has been playing together for the
past two years. "I feel a lot more confident in the guys in
the back line than I do with anybody else," Crane said.
"But the guys I play with are mostly on the left side of the
field, not the back line."
When asked if the Cardinal's defense was the bright
spot of this year's low-scoring team, Crane chose to look
at the team as a whole. "Everybody in the team is solid.
Sometimes we play better defense, and so it would look as
if our defensive line is better than our offensive line. But
the team is a whole. I don't think either stands out.
The defensive line plays an important role in a soccer
team's attack by aiding the front line. In Stanford's game
against Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo Nov. 7, defensive
players scored four points— Crane and Marshall Monroe
had assists, and Tom Rafalovich scored a goal.

September, is one of four defensive line players who have been together since last season.
