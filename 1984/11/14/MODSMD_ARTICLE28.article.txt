The Stanford men's soccer team will try to end its,
season on a winning note at home today against the Uni
versity of Santa Clara.
The match, which begins at 2:30 p.m., involves two
teams that have been rivals the past few years. Last'
season, the Broncos beat the Cardinal, 4-2, at Santa
Clara.
This year, the Broncos, who have nine freshmen on.
their roster, have struggled until recently. Although the.
Broncos usually have strong teams, they were 4-9-1 until,
about two weeks ago. However, Santa Clara has been on a,
tear lately, going 2-0-2 in their past four games, including;
a 3-1 victory over Pacific Soccer Conference champion'
University of San Francisco for the Western Collegiate
Athletic Conference title. The Broncos are 2-4 in the PSC
and 7-9-3 overall.
The Broncos defense is led by Eric Koch, who has been,
selected to play in this year's Senior Bowl. Koch has a,
1.55 goals-against average. Forward Richard Manning is,
Santa Clara's leading scorer with six goals and six
for 18 points. t!
But Santa Clara will not be at full strength today. Two
of its starting midfielders — second-leading scorer Mi
chael Varone and Jim Carey — are out with injuries. A
starting forward was redcarded in the Broncos last game v
a 2-1 overtime victory over Chico State, and is ineligible,
for the game against Stanford, which is 10-7-3.
The Cardinal, meanwhile, earned a 4-2 victory over Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo Nov. 7 in its best offensive showing
this season. After that game, junior fullback Phil Horvath
said, "Santa Clara is Big Game for us. It's the last game of
the season, and it's the last game for our seniors. Santa.
Clara is a good team, and it should be a good game."
Stanford Head Coach Sam Koch called the Cardinal's
effort against Cal Poly-SLO a "nice win' and said he was
pleased with the team effort. Koch praised the players;
coming off the bench, singling out fullback Marshall-
Monroe and midfielder Chris Carlsmith, both juniors',,
saying both have "played well of late."
Koch said he is expecting a tough game from the
Broncos. "It's a big rivalry," Koch said. "I talked with
Santa Clara's coach, and they're excited about the game
and are looking forward to playing us."
The Broncos like to run, Koch said, and the Cardinal
will have to be wary of long passes, especially to the cor
