# What happens to your $50 housing deposit?
## 
### KURT JOHNSON 
Residential Education asks all stu
dents to deposit $50 at the beginning
of their Stanford career, a sum that is
supposed to be returned to them
when they leave University housing.
Do they ever get it back? And what
does Residential Education do with
the money during the years they have
it?

The deposit first serves to hold
spaces for students in the housing sys
tem, and it goes on file with student
accounts, said Rodger Whitney,
director of the Stanford Housing
Center.
Interest earned oh the money goes
into a reserve fund to help offset
future housing cost increases for stu
dents.

Most students leave their housing
deposit on file while they remain at
Stanford. They can, however, request
their refund any time they leave Uni
versity housing and make another
housing deposit when they re-enter.
The deposit pays for physical da
mages to University housing and also
for damages incurred when a student
fails to give proper notification that

he intends to leave University
housing.
According to Whitney, students
who fail to notify Res Ed of their in
tention to leave hurt both the Univer
sity and fellow students trying to get
housing. Insufficient notice time
leaves an open space which does not
appear on the waiting list.
Students planning to leave Univer

sity housing at the end of this quarter
need to notify their local residence
office by Thursday, Nov. 15, or risk
losing their housing deposits.
Upon leaving University housing,
students normally file a deposit
refund request form, which is on the
back of the housing drop card. Stu
dents usually get their entire deposit
back, since most damages are billed
immediately after they occur.
To remind students to request their
refunds, Res Ed includes notices in all
house newsletters. According to
Whitney, students have "plenty of
notice" but sometimes "don't pay at
tention" since they're often in
undated with information toward the
end of a year.
If students fail to request their
deposit refunds. Res Ed seeks to
"track people down" by mailing let
ters to the addresses on the students'
current files. "Many times we don't
have a valid address," and "some stu
dents ignore the letter," Whitney
said. But a "vast majority" of people
do eventually receive their housing
deposit refunds, or "say to turn it
over to the University."
The housing deposit has been $50
for a long time, and according to Res
Ed, it is likely to remain $50 in the
near future. Res Ed recently consid
ered increasing the deposit but nixed
the plan, deciding the advantages of
increasing the deposit would not jus
tify the reorganization the increase
would require.
