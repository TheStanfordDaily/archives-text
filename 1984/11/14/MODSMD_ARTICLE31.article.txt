Bagshaw honored by Cancer Society
Malcolm Bagshaw, chairman of the
Department of Radiology at the
Stanford Medical School, was named
one of three recipients of the Ameri
can Cancer Society's 1984 Medal of
Honor at the society's annual dinner
in New York City Friday.
Bagshaw received the award, the
society's most prestigious honor, for
his clinical contributions to the use of
radiation in the treatment of cancer.
The other medal recipients are
Robert Weinberg, a cancer re
searcher at the Massachusetts In
stitute of Technology, and Forrest
Mars of Washington D.C., a national
volunteer leader in the fight against
cancer.
As this year's physician recipient,
Bagshaw was honored by the society
for his "pioneering studies and distin
guished leadership in radiation oncol
ogy and particularly for new ap
proaches in the management of
prostate cancer."
Bagshaw is an international au
thority on the use of the linear ac
celerator against a variety of cancers,
including prostate tumors, retinoblas
toma (an eye tumor) in infants,
ovarian cancer and mvcosis fun-

goides, a cancer of the skin.
Since 1960, Bagshaw has directed
the Division of Radiation Therapy at
the Stanford Medical School. He
became chairman of the Radiology
Department in 1972, and currently
holds the Catharine and Howard
Avery Professorship in the medical
school.
The American Cancer Society
Medal of Honor is presented each
year "to three outstanding individuals
in the field of cancer control: a
clinician, a research scientist and a lay
person."
New staff volunteer program
An unusual release-time program
that allows University staff mem
bers to do volunteer work in Palo
Alto schools during working hours
has been established here.
Three Stanford staff members cur
rently are volunteering up to three
hours a week as tutors in math,
reading and school newspaper pro
duction, and more are being sought.
Although industry has long spon
sored such programs, Stanford's new
staff release-time program is the first
in the nation to be sponsored by a
major nonprofit institution.

It's aim is twofold: to facilitate
public service by University staff and
to address the growing shortage of
school volunteers that has reached
crisis proportions.
Postgraduate fellowship program
Stanford soon will announce a new
program of postgraduate fellowships
for public service, University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy said Monday
night.
He spoke briefly to about 60
educators attending a national con
ference on civic education hosted by
the Hoover Institution.
Boudart to receive award
Michael Boudart, the William M.
Keck Sr. Professor of Chemical Engi
neering here, has been awarded the
E.V. Murphree Award in Industrial
and Engineering Chemistry from the
American Chemical Society (ACS).
Boudart will receive the award and
give a lecture at the April 1985 ACS
meeting in Miami Beach, Fla., where
a symposium also will be presented in
his honor.
