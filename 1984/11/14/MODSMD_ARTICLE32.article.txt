the team was chosen out of "about 200 who tried out."
Zierk was the big winner on the Stanford team. Fie
walked away with two color television sets, a moped, a
computer and printer, a stereo system, a trip to the
Bahamas and a trip to Puerta Vallarta. Fie also won
$3,500 dollars for the team, which will be divided among
the three players. "It was a blast, it was a lot of fun doing
it," Zierk said.
No one from Stanford came away empty-handed.
Having bought two letters, and guessed the phrase

"attendance record," Ford won a $1,000 gift certificate to
Tiffany's, a microwave oven, a computer, a stereo, a chair
and $300 worth of clothes.
Makamoto also won a round, ending up with a brass
bed, $500 worth of shoes and an electric typewriter. "It
was a lot of fun because all the Stanford people won
stuff," she said.
One player from Stanford is on every day this week. All
three players will appear in College Week 1V ads, accord
ing to Ford. On Friday the top three schools, Nebraska,
Stanford and Tulane, will play for cash. Stanford picked
Zierk to represent them, and he won them $3,500 —
$1,166 per player.
All three players said they were surprised and very
pleased to have been chosen tor the Stanford team.
"With so many people trying out, it was hard to be
confident," Zierk said. But, "1 watched the show at least
once or twice a day and . . . felt like I did pretty well on
the puzzles," he added.
In addition to Ford, Makamoto and Zierk, Conrad
Damon, also a Stanford student, will appear on "Wheel of
Fortune's" night game this week. According to Ford,
Damon "cleaned up," in his round.
Makamoto said she "was as surprised as anyone" when
she got picked. She said, "Before I saw the number of
people (trying out), I thought I had a pretty good chance."
