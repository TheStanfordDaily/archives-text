# Flyer urges violation of Mac policy
## 
### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Staff writer 
The sign on the first floor of Meyer
Undergraduate Library — identified
only by the name "Marc" and a
phone number — appears innocuous.
"I Want Your Macintosh," it reads.
The flyer offers Stanford students a
chance to earn money by selling Ap
ple Macintosh computers purchased
at a discount through the University's
Microdisc plan.
But the University plan specifically
restricts its buyers from re-selling
their systems within one year of pur
chase. Thus, this transaction is illegal
for students buying computers
through Stanford's Apple Consor
tium Program.
"If a student knowingly and will
fully signs a contract with the inten
tion of violating it, it is a questionable
violation of the Fundamental Stan
dard," said Michael Carter, director
of the Instruction and Research In
formation System (IRIS).
Not only are the repercussions for
the individual serious, but flagrant vi
olations will jeopardize the entire
Apple Consortium Program, Carter
said.
r "If Stanford University agrees to
' sell computers for the students' own
use and not for resale, the University
i probably has to think twice as to
whether it wants to be put in that sit
uation," Carter said.
"It might cause us to review if such
a program should exist," said Jan
Thomson, associate director of Infor
mation Technology Services (ITS).
"If students are not using the com
puters for the reasons the program
.vas set up, there is no reason for the
program."
Marc, who says he lives in Rich
mond, is not a Stanford student. He
has been self-employed for the past
three years in his own computer busi
ness. He said he recently returned to

school and wants to earn some extra
money.
Marc assures complete confiden
tiality, and if during the warranty per
iod the Macintosh should break
down, he will pay the student $25
to take it to the repair shop and
have it fixed, plus the actual repair
cost. In addition. Marc said that if the
student has already sold him a com
puter, he can earn a finders fee by re
ferring another seller.
"It is putting students in a position
of being tempted and taunted and not
putting the computers in the hands of
the people who want them," Carter
said of the flyer's offer.
"I haven't seen the contract yet,
but legally it may not be possible to
have that clause (forbidding reselling)
in the contract," Marc countered.
A student has already been caught
trying to resell his computer, Carter
said, adding that the Stanford Judicial
Council is currently investigating the
case.
"I discourage anyone who is think
ing of doing this," Thomson said. "The
University has the necessary re
sources to track down a resold com
puter."
ITS and IRIS have turned the mat
ter over to Adrian Arima, a Univer
sity legal counsel, for investigation.
The alleged violation has also been
brought to the attention of those in
charge of ordering the computers for
Stanford. Officials have not yet deter
mined whether Marc has broken any
laws by asking students to break their
agreement.
Neither the University nor Arima,
who is currently out of town, has been
in direct contact with Marc.
"We're extremely disappointed
that this is taking place," Thomson
said. "We hope that the Stanford
community supports the Microdisc
program and will help to continue it."
