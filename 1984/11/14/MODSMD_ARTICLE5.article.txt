AIDS. Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.
Everyone knows the term, hut few know the facts.
Bernadette DeArmond and David Burgess, both from
the Santa Clara Health Department AIDS Project, spoke
to a rather small crowd last night in the History Corner
about "AIDS: An Issue that Concerns Everyone."
Doctors tirst noticed the AIDS epidemic among the gay
populations of New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles
in 1980. Patients in their 20s and 30s, who had previously
been healthy, had symptoms similar to those of babies
born without necessary immunity systems.
Initially, the researchers suspected a toxin in these cities
as the root cause. DeArmond said. But when no toxin
could be found, and when it was discovered that "many of
the early cases had had sexual relations with each other,"
doctors began to perceive AIDS as a type of infection,

DeArmond said.
Doctors' first hypothesis about AIDS arose from the
similarity of symptoms between the AIDS patients and
cats infected by a virus that causes leukemia. Recent labo
ratory findings have identified three possible AIDS
viruses, DeArmond said.
The three strains, LAV (Lymphadenopathy Virus),
HTLV-3 (Human Lymphotropic Virus No. 3) and ARV
(AIDS-Related Virus), were discovered respectively in
Paris; Bethesda, Md.; and San Francisco. DeArmond said
they are all "the same strain or at least very similar."
An analysis of blood samples of gay men in San Fran
cisco from 1978 to 1983 revealed the presence of an
tibodies to the above strains of bacteria, DeArmond said.
But these antibodies are merely indicators, not
