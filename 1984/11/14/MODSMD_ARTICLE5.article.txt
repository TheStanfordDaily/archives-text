AIDS. Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.
Everyone knows the term, hut few know the facts.
Bernadette DeArmond and David Burgess, both from
the Santa Clara Health Department AIDS Project, spoke
to a rather small crowd last night in the History Corner
about "AIDS: An Issue that Concerns Everyone."
Doctors tirst noticed the AIDS epidemic among the gay
populations of New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles
in 1980. Patients in their 20s and 30s, who had previously
been healthy, had symptoms similar to those of babies
born without necessary immunity systems.
Initially, the researchers suspected a toxin in these cities
as the root cause. DeArmond said. But when no toxin
could be found, and when it was discovered that "many of
the early cases had had sexual relations with each other,"
doctors began to perceive AIDS as a type of infection,

DeArmond said.
Doctors' first hypothesis about AIDS arose from the
similarity of symptoms between the AIDS patients and
cats infected by a virus that causes leukemia. Recent labo
ratory findings have identified three possible AIDS
viruses, DeArmond said.
The three strains, LAV (Lymphadenopathy Virus),
HTLV-3 (Human Lymphotropic Virus No. 3) and ARV
(AIDS-Related Virus), were discovered respectively in
Paris; Bethesda, Md.; and San Francisco. DeArmond said
they are all "the same strain or at least very similar."
An analysis of blood samples of gay men in San Fran
cisco from 1978 to 1983 revealed the presence of an
tibodies to the above strains of bacteria, DeArmond said.
But these antibodies are merely indicators, not

preventers, of the AIDS disease.
Between 1978 and 1983, the num
ber of blood samples containing the
AIDS antibodies rose from 1 percent
to 65-70 percent, a statistic DeAr
mond called "very worrisome."
Patients whose blood contains the
AIDS virus may be divided into three
groups, DeArmond said. One group
are those who actually get AIDS, a
disease recognizable by fever, weight
loss, swollen lymph nodes and
gradual loss of immunity, which
results in serious, and eventually fa
tal, secondary infections, she said.

A second group, suffering from
what is termed AIDS-Related Com
plex, show the initial symptoms of
AIDS but never experience the loss
of immunity and secondary infec
tions. A third group, DeArmond said,
carries the AIDS antibodies but
shows no outward symptoms. "What
is really scary," she said, "is that we
don't know if people move from one
group to the next."
DeArmond said AIDS caught the
medical world unaware. It "seems to
have come out of nowhere," she said,
Zaire is a possible location of origin,
she said, but poor medical records
there prevent any systematic testing
of this hypothesis.
Disappointingly, DeArmond noted
that, in regard to treatment, "nothing

has been shown to be effective.
They've been looking for a vaccine to
leukemia for fifteen years," she said.
Researchers have been hindered by
a severe lack of necessary data.
DeArmond described research until
now as "bits and pieces being put to
gether."
Burgess also noted the difficulties
gay men face participating in AIDS
studies. Until now, there has been no
legislation passed to protect the con
fidentiality of gay men who are
diagnosed during a study as having
the AIDS virus in their blood. The
release of names. Burgess said, could
have "very serious repercussions" in
matters regarding employment, life
insurance and the like.
