Soviet planes fly near Japan again
TOKYO — Yesterday, a day after a Soviet bomber violated Japanese
airspace, seven Soviet bombers flew south in international airspace be
tween South Korea and Japan, prompting 32 Japanese jetfighters to
scramble, a Japanese Defense Agency spokesman said.
Spokesman Masafuji Sato said five Tu- 16s and two Tu-95s flew south
over the Tsushima Strait but did not violate Japanese airspace.
Two of the Soviet bombers continued southward, apparently to Viet
nam. while the other five turned back north and headed for their base,
Sato said.
On Monday, 40 Japanese jetfighters scrambled when a Tu-16, one of
nine Soviet bombers which flew south past the strait Monday, violated
Japanese airspace above the island of Okinoshima, southern Japan, for
two minutes despite repeated warnings.
In the past five years. Soviet military aircraft have flown close to, but
not violated, Japanese airspace an average 315 times a year, according
to the defense agency.
Reagan 'welcomes' pastoral letter
WASHINGTON — President Reagan "welcomes" the draft pastoral
letter of the U.S. Roman Catholic bishops stating that the United States
has a moral responsibility to see that no one is hungry, homeless or un
employed. and he shares "the bishops' concern for the poor," White
House spokesman Larry Speakes said yesterday.
Reagan's economic policies have helped the poor, Speakes said.
"Important gains have been made in the past four years to reduce infla
tion, generate economic growth and drop the rate of unemployment.
More than 6 million people have gotten jobs in the last 22 months, and
the unemployment rate has dropped from over 10 percent to 7.3 per
cent," he said.
Nevertheless, the poverty rate has increased under the Reagan admin
istration from about 13 percent to 15.2 percent in 1983, bringing the
number of Americans living below the poverty line to 35.3 million.
The bishops' proposed letter, which called for government job
creation programs and liberalized welfare to try to reduce the inequality
in the distribution of wealth in the nation, goes far beyond Democratic
nominee Walter Mondale's campaign proposals and appears to contra
dict the major themes of Reagan's presidency.
Trudeau criticizes summit talks
WASHINGTON — The top leaders of the Western alliance have al
most never addressed the central questions of war and peace in their
private summit talks but dwell instead on much less vital subjects, Pierre
Elliott Trudeau, who participated in many such sessions in his 15 years
as prime minister of Canada, said yesterday.
Trudeau. who attended four of the six summit meetings of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization since its founding in 1949, said the closed
door talks centered on such items as making NATO weapons uniform
for all countries and planning to increase military expenditures 3 percent
annually.
In an interview and an acceptance address for the award of the
$50,000 Albert Einstein Peace Prize at a luncheon here, Trudeau ex
pressed frustration with the unwillingness and inability of world leaders,
in both East and West, to focus broadly and seriously on the nuclear
arms race that imperils mankind.
"NATO heads of state and of government meet only to go through
the tedious motions of reading speeches drafted by others with the prin
cipal objective of not rocking the boat," Trudeau said. He added that
"any attempt to start a discussion or to question the meaning of the com
munique — also drafted by others before the meetings began — was met
with stony embarrassment or strong objection."
Trudeau said discussions of the nuclear threat had been "somewhat
more tolerated" at the annual "economic summits" of advanced indus
trial nations, despite the seemingly more limited subject matter.
Trudeau attended eight of these meetings from 1976 to 1984.
President warns of budget cuts
WASHINGTON — Amid signs that the federal budget deficit will be
considerably worse this year than the $172 billion the White House had
projected as recently as this summer, President Reagan yesterday told
his Cabinet that deep budget cuts would be needed to control govern
ment spending.
"I know there's a tendency to go along with the tide," Reagan said at
his first Cabinet meeting since his re-election, referring to the spending
increases already built into future budgets. "We came here to dam the
river. Let's start throwing in the rocks."
But some key congressional leaders said they thought the administra
tion was moving too slowly to attack the deficit. In an interview yester
day, Robert Dole (R-Kan.), chairman of the Senate finance committee,
reiterated his call for a bipartisan summit next month on the budget and
said, for the first time, he could agree to a one-year spending "freeze"
that would eliminate cost-of-living increases in Social Security and other
middle-income benefit programs; put a cap on Medicare payments; hold
defense spending to 4 percent to 5 percent, and close some tax
loopholes.
"We have to move faster, get things rolling before next year," Dole
said. "The president's got to throw out the first pitch, but I don't want to
wait until February to get the game under way. By that time, many of us
will already be worrying about running in 1986."
Dole is one of 22 Republican senators who will be up for re-election in
1986, and many of them are worried that the Republicans could lose
control of the Senate after that election if the economy plunges into a
recession because of failure to control the deficit.
Sharon takes on Time in lawsuit
NEW YORK — Former Israeli Defense Minister Ariel Sharon took
on Time magazine in federal court here yesterday in a $50 million law
suit for what he contends was a "blood libel" by the nation's largest
newsmagazine.
The suit, which has already produced more than 10,000 pages of
documents and depositions, explores Sharon's role in the Christian Pha
langists' 1982 massacre of civilian men, women and children in
Lebanon's Sabra and Shatila refugee camps. Sharon was forced to resign
after an Israeli commission found he bore an "indirect responsibility"
for the carnage as head of the Israeli Defense Forces, which commanded
the Phalangists.
The lawsuit, pitting a cabinet minister of a major U.S. ally against one
of the most influential news organizations in the country, is unprece
dented.
Time lawyers contend that the suit is an "attempt to a foreign
politician to justify his conduct of a war" in the interest of his own politi
cal future. Sharon, now minister of industry and commerce, is a powerful
force in Israeli politics and some observers believe he is courting Ameri
can Jews in hopes of becoming prime minister.
The jury trial is taking place in the same federal courthouse where
retired Gen. William Westmoreland is battling CBS in a libel suit that is
re-examining the Vietnam War. It pits two powerful New York firms
and their leading "superlawyers" — Thomas Barr of Cravath, Swaine
and Moore, who defended IBM in a landmark antitrust case, and Milton
Gould of Shea and Gould, who has taken on Sharon's defense free of
charge. Cravath also is defending CBS against Westmoreland.
Stocks decline again
NEW YORK — The stock market retreated broadly yesterday as the
Dow Jones Industrial Average extended its post-election decline by
registering its biggest daily drop in more than seven weeks.
Blue-chip issues led the decline, but losers were evident in almost
every industry group. Mining and metals stocks were exceptions, posting
modest gains.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had gained 0.22 in the
previous session, tumbled 12.59 points to 1,206.60.

private summit talks but dwell instead on much less vital subjects, Pierre
Elliott Trudeau, who participated in many such sessions in his 15 years
as prime minister of Canada, said yesterday.
Trudeau. who attended four of the six summit meetings of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization since its founding in 1949, said the closed
door talks centered on such items as making NATO weapons uniform
for all countries and planning to increase military expenditures 3 percent
annually.
In an interview and an acceptance address for the award of the
$50,000 Albert Einstein Peace Prize at a luncheon here, Trudeau ex
pressed frustration with the unwillingness and inability of world leaders,
in both East and West, to focus broadly and seriously on the nuclear
arms race that imperils mankind.
"NATO heads of state and of government meet only to go through
the tedious motions of reading speeches drafted by others with the prin
cipal objective of not rocking the boat," Trudeau said. He added that
"any attempt to start a discussion or to question the meaning of the com
munique — also drafted by others before the meetings began — was met
with stony embarrassment or strong objection."
Trudeau said discussions of the nuclear threat had been "somewhat
more tolerated" at the annual "economic summits" of advanced indus
trial nations, despite the seemingly more limited subject matter.
Trudeau attended eight of these meetings from 1976 to 1984.
President warns of budget cuts
WASHINGTON — Amid signs that the federal budget deficit will be
considerably worse this year than the $172 billion the White House had
projected as recently as this summer, President Reagan yesterday told
his Cabinet that deep budget cuts would be needed to control govern
ment spending.
"I know there's a tendency to go along with the tide," Reagan said at
his first Cabinet meeting since his re-election, referring to the spending
increases already built into future budgets. "We came here to dam the
river. Let's start throwing in the rocks."
But some key congressional leaders said they thought the administra
tion was moving too slowly to attack the deficit. In an interview yester
day, Robert Dole (R-Kan.), chairman of the Senate finance committee,
reiterated his call for a bipartisan summit next month on the budget and
said, for the first time, he could agree to a one-year spending "freeze"
that would eliminate cost-of-living increases in Social Security and other
middle-income benefit programs; put a cap on Medicare payments; hold
defense spending to 4 percent to 5 percent, and close some tax
loopholes.
"We have to move faster, get things rolling before next year," Dole
said. "The president's got to throw out the first pitch, but I don't want to
wait until February to get the game under way. By that time, many of us
will already be worrying about running in 1986."
Dole is one of 22 Republican senators who will be up for re-election in
1986, and many of them are worried that the Republicans could lose
control of the Senate after that election if the economy plunges into a
recession because of failure to control the deficit.
Sharon takes on Time in lawsuit
NEW YORK — Former Israeli Defense Minister Ariel Sharon took
on Time magazine in federal court here yesterday in a $50 million law
suit for what he contends was a "blood libel" by the nation's largest
newsmagazine.
The suit, which has already produced more than 10,000 pages of
documents and depositions, explores Sharon's role in the Christian Pha
langists' 1982 massacre of civilian men, women and children in
Lebanon's Sabra and Shatila refugee camps. Sharon was forced to resign
after an Israeli commission found he bore an "indirect responsibility"
for the carnage as head of the Israeli Defense Forces, which commanded
the Phalangists.
The lawsuit, pitting a cabinet minister of a major U.S. ally against one
of the most influential news organizations in the country, is unprece
dented.
Time lawyers contend that the suit is an "attempt to a foreign
politician to justify his conduct of a war" in the interest of his own politi
cal future. Sharon, now minister of industry and commerce, is a powerful
force in Israeli politics and some observers believe he is courting Ameri
can Jews in hopes of becoming prime minister.
The jury trial is taking place in the same federal courthouse where
retired Gen. William Westmoreland is battling CBS in a libel suit that is
re-examining the Vietnam War. It pits two powerful New York firms
and their leading "superlawyers" — Thomas Barr of Cravath, Swaine
and Moore, who defended IBM in a landmark antitrust case, and Milton
Gould of Shea and Gould, who has taken on Sharon's defense free of
charge. Cravath also is defending CBS against Westmoreland.
Stocks decline again
NEW YORK — The stock market retreated broadly yesterday as the
Dow Jones Industrial Average extended its post-election decline by
registering its biggest daily drop in more than seven weeks.
Blue-chip issues led the decline, but losers were evident in almost
every industry group. Mining and metals stocks were exceptions, posting
modest gains.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had gained 0.22 in the
previous session, tumbled 12.59 points to 1,206.60.

Soviet planes fly near Japan again
TOKYO — Yesterday, a day after a Soviet bomber violated Japanese
airspace, seven Soviet bombers flew south in international airspace be
tween South Korea and Japan, prompting 32 Japanese jetfighters to
scramble, a Japanese Defense Agency spokesman said.
Spokesman Masafuji Sato said five Tu- 16s and two Tu-95s flew south
over the Tsushima Strait but did not violate Japanese airspace.
Two of the Soviet bombers continued southward, apparently to Viet
nam. while the other five turned back north and headed for their base,
Sato said.
On Monday, 40 Japanese jetfighters scrambled when a Tu-16, one of
nine Soviet bombers which flew south past the strait Monday, violated
Japanese airspace above the island of Okinoshima, southern Japan, for
two minutes despite repeated warnings.
In the past five years. Soviet military aircraft have flown close to, but
not violated, Japanese airspace an average 315 times a year, according
to the defense agency.
Reagan 'welcomes' pastoral letter
WASHINGTON — President Reagan "welcomes" the draft pastoral
letter of the U.S. Roman Catholic bishops stating that the United States
has a moral responsibility to see that no one is hungry, homeless or un
employed. and he shares "the bishops' concern for the poor," White
House spokesman Larry Speakes said yesterday.
Reagan's economic policies have helped the poor, Speakes said.
"Important gains have been made in the past four years to reduce infla
tion, generate economic growth and drop the rate of unemployment.
More than 6 million people have gotten jobs in the last 22 months, and
the unemployment rate has dropped from over 10 percent to 7.3 per
cent," he said.
Nevertheless, the poverty rate has increased under the Reagan admin
istration from about 13 percent to 15.2 percent in 1983, bringing the
number of Americans living below the poverty line to 35.3 million.
The bishops' proposed letter, which called for government job
creation programs and liberalized welfare to try to reduce the inequality
in the distribution of wealth in the nation, goes far beyond Democratic
nominee Walter Mondale's campaign proposals and appears to contra
dict the major themes of Reagan's presidency.
