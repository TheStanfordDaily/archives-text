# U.S.-Nicaragua tensions grow

### 
WASHINGTON — The Reagan
administration stepped up its war of
words against Nicaragua yesterday
amid disclosures that the U.S. mili
tary is conducting seven separate ex
ercises in neighboring Honduras,
three of which began the day after the
U.S. presidential election.
Michael Burch. the chief Pentagon
spokesman, said in response to a
question, that the administration
believes Nicaragua has "designs" on
Honduras and El Salvador, two U.S.
allies in the region. He said the
Defense Department would "respond
with whatever assistance was neces
sary" if Nicaragua attacks its neigh
bors, but Burch also said, "there is no
hard evidence that they plan to
invade El Salvador and Honduras."
Burch said the United States has no
plans to invade Nicaragua or to inter
fere with shipments of arms traveling
to that Central American country. He

criticized Nicaraguan leaders for
"needlessly stirring up their own pop
ulation" with alerts and predictions of
imminent U.S. military action.
Burch's comments, reinforced by
similar statements from White House
and State Department officials, ap
peared to reflect an administration
campaign to maintain pressure on the
leftist government of Nicaragua while
denying any military plans to attack
that country. A White House official
likened the situation following recent
Soviet arms shipments to Nicaragua
to the 1962 Cuban missile crisis,
when Washington said it would not
tolerate the shipment of nuclear
missiles to Cuba.
Burch said current U.S. military
exercises in neighboring Honduras
and El Salvador are intended to
"remind" the Nicaraguans "that per
haps they should not have any designs
on their neighbors."

A Pentagon spokesman said there
are now about 1,000 U.S. military
personnel in Honduras, which is the
same number the Pentagon provided
before the exercises began.
But in Managua yesterday, the top
Sandinista military commander
charged that the Reagan administia
tion is attempting to condition the
American public to support an even
tual invasion of Nicaragua.
In explaining the national alert that
brought tanks into the streets ol
Managua Monday, Defense Minister
Humberto Ortega said that, even
though no invasion is expected imme
diately, "Nicaragua cannot afford the
luxury of not taking these measures.
At any minute, our people and army
might be surprised by a direct military
attack."
Ortega is one of the nine Sandinista
commanders who rule Nicaragua. He

is the brother of Daniel Ortega, who
was chosen as the country's president
in landslide elections last week. The
Sandinistas also won 61 of 90 seats in
a new constitutional assembly.
"The Reagan administration h;is
mounted a campaign of war
mongering and lies to condition
American public opinion in favor of
intervention plans," the defense min
ister said at a news conference here
yesterday.
He repeated the Nicaraguan go\-
eminent s assertion that it has the
right to acquire any weapons it wants,
including arms that would deter U.S.
spy flights over Nicaraguan territory.

planes reportedly have flown mis
