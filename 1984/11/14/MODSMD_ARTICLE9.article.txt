# Air controllers' appeal rejected
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court yester
day refused to hear appeals from 34 former air traf
fic controllers challenging the legality of their firing
after a massive strike in 1981.
The justices, without dissent, issued a brief order
that left intact a lower-court ruling that the Reagan
administration acted lawfully in ordering the con
trollers' dismissal when they refused a presidential
plea to return to work.
Previously, the Court had rejected appeals from
dozens of others from among the nearly 13,000
controllers who left the job when the Professional
Air Traffic Controller Organization called a
walkout in August, 1981, after talks on a new con
tract broke down.
Shortly after the walkout. President Reagan
went on national television, citing a law that forbids
strikes by federal employees and gave the strikers
48 hours to return to work or be dismissed. In all,
about 11,400 strikers refused to come back and
were fired.
The cases before the Court yesterday
(Schapansky vs. Department of Transportation,
84-258; Anderson vs. Department of Transporta
tion, 84-259) were brought by a group of 19 former
controllers from the Federal Aviation Administra
tion Center in Olanthe, Kan., and 15 others from
FAA centers in Fort Worth, Texas; Leesburg, Va.
and Ronkonkoma, N.Y.
The controllers had contended that the presiden
tial mandate had been confusing as to whether they

had been ordered to return within 48 hours or at
the first shift after the 48-hour deadline. Further,
they said, under federal regulations they should
have been given at least seven days' notice before
their dismissals.
But both the federal Merit Systems Protection
Board and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit rejected the controllers' claims.
The appeals court, noting that more than 1,000
controllers had elected to return to work, said that
the president had allowed a reasonable grace per
iod for return to the job.
In another decision, the Court upheld a contro
versial section of the 1982 Voting Rights Act that
outlaws redistricting plans and election laws if they
produce discriminatory results, regardless of
whether they were discriminatory in intent.
The ruling came in challenges to a Mississippi
redistricting plan, drawn up earlier this year by a
federal court, that gave black voters in the 2nd
Congressional District a majority.
State officials and the Mississippi Republican
Party argued that the plan went too far, while a
group of black voters said the plan, which created a
53 percent black majority in the district, did not go
far enough.
Despite the redistricting plan, incumbent Rep.
Webb Franklin, a white Republican from Green
wood, defeated black Democratic challenger
Robert Clark by 4,300 votes in last Tuesday's elec
tion.

In a case that involves a zoning dispute in
Cleburne, Texas, the justices agreed to decide for
the first time what standards judges should use to
review the constitutionality of laws that dis
criminate against mentally retarded people.
The Court said lawsthat discriminate against the
mentally retarded should be viewed much like
those that involve sex discrimination, where the
government is required to prove not only that the
law is rational but that there is a "substantial" or
"compelling" reason to justify the disparate treat
ment.
The high court also:
• Declined to overturn a federal judge's order re
quirinn the National Ritle Association to turn over
a list of its contributors to a Minnesota state ethics
agency. The case is National Rifle Association of
America v. Minnesota Ethical Practice Board.
• Said it would decide whether prison inmates have
a constitutional right to judicial review of rulings by
prison disciplinary boards. The case is Superintend
ent. Massachusetts Correctional Institution v. Hill.
• Declined to review a lower-court ruling that
blocked the Interior Department's Bureau of Land
Management from spraying weed killers in forests
in Oregon. An appeals court had ruled that the
BLM did not go far enough in reviewing the possi
ble "worst case" effects that herbicides could have
on people.
