————— The Palo Alto LSAT Program ————
GMAT Preparation
The Program's 36-hour course to prepare students for the Jan. 26 GMAT
begins on December 1 We will meet Bto 10 times, using a schedule de
signed to allow a holiday break, to cover all verbal and quant aspects of
the GMAT. If you read about our LSAT course in the Daily, you know that
you can expect a personalized, intensive preparation for the GMAT. All
curricular development and teaching is done by a former Stanford faculty
member with continuous GMATteaching experience since 1978. Our ap
proach is old-fashioned: no tapes, no fancy offices, just lots of instructor
contact, constant monitoring of progress, and intensive reviewing.
The median score achieved by students of the Program who took the
GMAT in the 1983-84 cycle was 680 — 98th percentile. So make your own
choice: a big name or a small class (maximum enrollment is 15) with an
outstanding success record.
The fee for our course is $300. Call soon to be sure there will be a place
for you.
