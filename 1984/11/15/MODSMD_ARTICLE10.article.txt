## It's a bird, it's an Indian; it's Cardinal 
### TRASK LEONARD 
As the football team heads onto the field Saturday
in the annual Big Game, boisterous students and
alumni will be cheering on a team nicknamed the Card
inal. Some will express vocal dissatisfaction over the
school's official mascot, while others will remain indif
ferent, or even passively approving.
Yet the color that unites them all has its roots deep in
the history of the University; deeper than most realize.
" The Cardinal was the first official nickname for Stan
ford University," said Kevin Solliday, chairman of the
Stanford Axe Committee, a student organization created
to support Big Game activities.
"Because of this, it has the potential to become even
further entrenched in the Stanford psyche; all that needs
to be understood is the history of it all for people to sense
the magnitude of the tradition," he said.
The Cardinal was not the original choice by the Univer
sity for the school's color, however. Originally, in the
spring of 1892, when Stanford and Berkeley first got to
gether to play football, gold was suggested as a possible
color.
\et, this idea did not get very far, as Stanford support
ers cheered the players on with cardinal-colored handker
chiefs at the game. The next day, the journalists caught on
to this and began calling the team the Stanford Cardinal,
according to Solliday.
"This one was greeted by an enthusiastic response, so
the nickname became the official [name], and stayed that
way until the 19205," said Solliday.
During this 25-year period, various school songs using
the word Cardinal were adopted. They appeared in
"Stanford Songs," originally published by the Stanford
Bookstore in 1919. Some of the names of the songs in
clude "The Cardinal Fighting Song," "The Cardinal is
Waving," and"The Victorious Cardinal."
Not until the '20s did the concept of the Indian first ap
pear. According to Solliday, the emergence of the Indian
as Stanford's first tangible mascot was due at least in part
to the press.
"By the late-'2os the reporters began to call them the
'red-shirts,' " said Solliday. "This evolved into'redskins,'
which became Indians."
One story says that as Stanford Stadium was being con
structed, a tribal burial ground was uncovered. All of this,
added to the fact that Native Americans once inhabited
the Palo Alto area in great numbers, was enough to give
Stanford reason to adopt the Indian as its official mascot
in 1930.
Beginning in 1947, Timm Williams, a local tribal chief,
appeared at games as the now almost legendary "Prince
Lightfoot" in his tribal garb. Similar to USC's Tommy
Trojan, Williams would inspire the crowd from atop his
horse.

This all changed in 1972, however, as University Presi
dent Richard Lyman ordered the end of the Indian era.
From then on, the team would go as the Cardinals, or at
least until a viable solution was worked out.
Prompting the switch was the Stanford American In
dian Organization, according to Wade Blackmon, a mem
ber of the council of SAIO.
"The group felt at the time, and we still do today, that

equating Native Americans to an animalistic and savage
mascot is overly offensive and degrading." said Black
mon. "The Indian that was seen as Stanford's mascot did
not represent Native Americans fairly."
Once a protest was filed with Lyman, he recommended
to the ASSU that the nickname be abolished. They, in
turn, voted 18 to 4 to remove the Indian. This decision did
not go unnoticed, however.

"After Lyman's decision, there were many protests
against the removal of the Indian," explained Soliic^ay.
"Also, it was clear that not all Native Americans were Of
fended by the use of the word.
"However, the University's decision was based on the
fact that since some groups of people were offended it
was not appropriate to continue to identify ourselvei as
the Indians,'' he said.
Several alumni have expressed their displeasure with
the decision since 1972. For some of them the use of the
term Indian should not be offensive to Native Americans,
but rather a compliment.
"I would think that American-born Indians would-be
proud to be associated with such a respected institution,"
argued Gabby Fuller, '39, who is a loyal fan of Stanford
football.
Others feel that the Indian, as a tangible and active
mascot, gives Stanford fans a well-defined symbol from
which to rally.
"Since the departure of the Indian, Stanford football
has lost a central rallying point," said Ronald Iverson, >60.
"Compared [with] a color, the Indian is so much rnjore
powerful and would seem to inspire a great deal more en
thusiasm."
A similar sentiment is common among today's students.
"I think the Indian would be a great mascot to hiive
again," said sophomore Karen Anderson. "Even though
some Native Americans are offended, I don't think that it
is the intention of the use of the mascot to do so."
After the approval of the Cardinals in 1972 as a tempo
rary solution, student referendums were taken to deter
mine a popular choice for mascot. Several of the results
were the Trees, which is still the choice of the Band, the
Gryphens, two of which guard Encina Gym, and the
Thunderchickens, a name derived from an infamous de
fensive line during the Rose Bowl years.
Robber Barons was actually the most popular chpice
among students in a 1977 vote, but this term, which refers
to Leland Stanford's railroad days, was not acceptable to
the board of trustees at the time.
Finally, in 1981, Cardinal was the choice of students in
a vote, and was adopted by the University as its official
mascot.
"Colors do serve, however, as the sole symbol at some
universities of distinction. Moreover, well-chosen colors
often come to dominate animal mascots when both are
present," said University President Donald Kennedy as
he commented on the implementation of the Carding in
November 1981.
"I hope this affirmation, in which various segments of
the Stanford community have been concerned, puts to rest
for once and for all the so-called 'mascot' issue. We have
something better; it is unique, historically correct, and
vivid. We should support it with enthusiasm," Kennedy
said.

Who's that man on the brown horse? It's Timm Williams, a local Indian chief who served as a mascot for the
Stanford Indians from 1947 until the team's name changed in 1972. Although there has been dispute over
the name Cardinal, many feel that it is distinguished — and Stanford is a horse of a different color.

Robber Barons was actually the most popular chpice
among students in a 1977 vote, but this term, which refers
to Leland Stanford's railroad days, was not acceptable to
the board of trustees at the time.
Finally, in 1981, Cardinal was the choice of students in
a vote, and was adopted by the University as its official
mascot.
"Colors do serve, however, as the sole symbol at some
universities of distinction. Moreover, well-chosen colors
often come to dominate animal mascots when both are
present," said University President Donald Kennedy as
he commented on the implementation of the Carding in
November 1981.
"I hope this affirmation, in which various segments of
the Stanford community have been concerned, puts to rest
for once and for all the so-called 'mascot' issue. We have
something better; it is unique, historically correct, and
vivid. We should support it with enthusiasm," Kennedy
said.

Who's that man on the brown horse? It's Timm Williams, a local Indian chief who served as a mascot for the
Stanford Indians from 1947 until the team's name changed in 1972. Although there has been dispute over
the name Cardinal, many feel that it is distinguished — and Stanford is a horse of a different color.
As the football team heads onto the field Saturday
in the annual Big Game, boisterous students and
alumni will be cheering on a team nicknamed the Card
inal. Some will express vocal dissatisfaction over the
school's official mascot, while others will remain indif
ferent, or even passively approving.
Yet the color that unites them all has its roots deep in
the history of the University; deeper than most realize.
" The Cardinal was the first official nickname for Stan
ford University," said Kevin Solliday, chairman of the
Stanford Axe Committee, a student organization created
to support Big Game activities.
"Because of this, it has the potential to become even
further entrenched in the Stanford psyche; all that needs
to be understood is the history of it all for people to sense
the magnitude of the tradition," he said.
The Cardinal was not the original choice by the Univer
sity for the school's color, however. Originally, in the
spring of 1892, when Stanford and Berkeley first got to
gether to play football, gold was suggested as a possible
color.
\et, this idea did not get very far, as Stanford support
ers cheered the players on with cardinal-colored handker
chiefs at the game. The next day, the journalists caught on
to this and began calling the team the Stanford Cardinal,
according to Solliday.
"This one was greeted by an enthusiastic response, so
the nickname became the official [name], and stayed that
way until the 19205," said Solliday.
During this 25-year period, various school songs using
the word Cardinal were adopted. They appeared in
"Stanford Songs," originally published by the Stanford
Bookstore in 1919. Some of the names of the songs in
clude "The Cardinal Fighting Song," "The Cardinal is
Waving," and"The Victorious Cardinal."
Not until the '20s did the concept of the Indian first ap
pear. According to Solliday, the emergence of the Indian
as Stanford's first tangible mascot was due at least in part
to the press.
"By the late-'2os the reporters began to call them the
'red-shirts,' " said Solliday. "This evolved into'redskins,'
which became Indians."
One story says that as Stanford Stadium was being con
structed, a tribal burial ground was uncovered. All of this,
added to the fact that Native Americans once inhabited
the Palo Alto area in great numbers, was enough to give
Stanford reason to adopt the Indian as its official mascot
in 1930.
Beginning in 1947, Timm Williams, a local tribal chief,
appeared at games as the now almost legendary "Prince
Lightfoot" in his tribal garb. Similar to USC's Tommy
Trojan, Williams would inspire the crowd from atop his
horse.

This all changed in 1972, however, as University Presi
dent Richard Lyman ordered the end of the Indian era.
From then on, the team would go as the Cardinals, or at
least until a viable solution was worked out.
Prompting the switch was the Stanford American In
dian Organization, according to Wade Blackmon, a mem
ber of the council of SAIO.
"The group felt at the time, and we still do today, that

equating Native Americans to an animalistic and savage
mascot is overly offensive and degrading." said Black
mon. "The Indian that was seen as Stanford's mascot did
not represent Native Americans fairly."
Once a protest was filed with Lyman, he recommended
to the ASSU that the nickname be abolished. They, in
turn, voted 18 to 4 to remove the Indian. This decision did
not go unnoticed, however.

"After Lyman's decision, there were many protests
against the removal of the Indian," explained Soliic^ay.
"Also, it was clear that not all Native Americans were Of
fended by the use of the word.
"However, the University's decision was based on the
fact that since some groups of people were offended it
was not appropriate to continue to identify ourselvei as
the Indians,'' he said.
Several alumni have expressed their displeasure with
the decision since 1972. For some of them the use of the
term Indian should not be offensive to Native Americans,
but rather a compliment.
"I would think that American-born Indians would-be
proud to be associated with such a respected institution,"
argued Gabby Fuller, '39, who is a loyal fan of Stanford
football.
Others feel that the Indian, as a tangible and active
mascot, gives Stanford fans a well-defined symbol from
which to rally.
"Since the departure of the Indian, Stanford football
has lost a central rallying point," said Ronald Iverson, >60.
"Compared [with] a color, the Indian is so much rnjore
powerful and would seem to inspire a great deal more en
thusiasm."
A similar sentiment is common among today's students.
"I think the Indian would be a great mascot to hiive
again," said sophomore Karen Anderson. "Even though
some Native Americans are offended, I don't think that it
is the intention of the use of the mascot to do so."
After the approval of the Cardinals in 1972 as a tempo
rary solution, student referendums were taken to deter
mine a popular choice for mascot. Several of the results
were the Trees, which is still the choice of the Band, the
Gryphens, two of which guard Encina Gym, and the
Thunderchickens, a name derived from an infamous de
fensive line during the Rose Bowl years.
