## The 						Stanford Daily No more head bashing 
### 
There's something happening here /What it is
ain't exactly clear /There's a man with a gun over
there helling me I've got to beware.
One of the big news stories in San Francisco —
the sort of story that could only be a big story in
San Francisco — has been the conflict over the
city's official song. The pages of The Chronicle
have been full of arguments between fans of "I
Left My Heart in San Francisco" and "San Fran
cisco" from the Clark Gable movie of the same
name.
But recent events in San Francisco bring other
songs to mind. Songs like Buffalo Springfield's
"For What It's Worth."
There's battle lines being drawn /Nobody's right
if everybody's wrong /Young people speaking
their minds /getting so much resistance from be
hind.
The San Francisco Police Department is
making the city that hosted the summer of love in
1967 look a lot more like Chicago in 1968.
Watch the television news the next time there's a
peaceful protest in San Francisco. What you see
will shock you.
It has become a hobby, it appears, for the San
Francisco police to bash a few heads now and
again. Billy-club a protestor from behind.

Trample a sign-carrier with a horse. Smash out
the lights of a TV news crew.
And if what you see on TV is shocking, what
you may see in person will scare the hell out of
you.
What a field day for The Heat la thousand
people in the street /Singing songs and carrying
signs /mostly saying "hurray" for our side."
This violent overreaction happened at the
Democratic National Convention this summer. It
happened at Daniel Ortega's speech last month.
It happened again at Caspar Weinberger's speech
last week.
Certainly there are times when police action is
warranted in protest situations. But wanton
head-bashing is seldom the way to go about
quieting angry protestors.
Stanford students will invade San Francisco to
morrow night for the annual Big Game rally. The
San Francisco Police Department, as usual, will
be out in force. Unless you want a billy club in the
back as part of your Big Game weekend, watch
your step.
Paranoia strikes deep Unto your life it will
creep /Starts when you're always afraid /Step out
of line, the man come and take you away.
