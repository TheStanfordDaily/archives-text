## Fear and hope before the storm breaks 
### 
We've heard this before
The steel-eyed skeptic coldly gazed at the
morose youth with skepticism.
"So this Nicaraguan thing scares you? Big
deal. It's not like this is the first time that ten
sions have flared up down there. No one's in
terested in how frightened you are; we've
heard it all before. What's so new about it that
you're scared?"
The young coward, in the corner, hesitated.
"I don't know," said the young man with
flagging confidence.
"What makes you so sure Reagan wants to
invade? I think he wants peace, just as much
as you do."
"He sure has a funny way of showing it,
then. Even though his own intelligence ex
perts say its almost 100 percent likely there
are no MiGs in those crates, he still has the
jets flying over Nicaragua every day, making
sonic booms, rattling windows and scaring
children."
"But there could easily be MiGs in the
crates, which would pose a serious threat to
our national security."
Confusion in high places, or
The counter-citrus offensive reaction
"In the first place, it's never been clear just
what cargo the Soviet ship carried. Our own
intelligence officials have said the crates could
just as well be carrying oranges. Based on
such meager evidence, the level that military
activity in the United States has reached
during the last few days seems out of propor
tion, to say the least. Unless," mused the
naive, young, peaceloving KGB dupe.

"unless, of course, the Soviets have given
oranges a new offensive capability."
Under pressure
"That's bullshit, and you know it,"the
stern face rebuked, heated in bovine madness.
"It's very simple. All we want to do is to pres
sure the Sandinistas, to keep them from trying
anything that would undermine our national
security. And MiGs would definitely un
dermine our national security, if they're
there."
"But even Reagan admits that they prob
ably aren't there at all. The sonic boom strat
egy, the navy frigate we have prowling around
Corinto, the mobilization of two airborne at
tack divisions and the clearing of hospital
beds at Fort Bragg, I think, show the United
States is overdoing its warning to the Sandi
nistas. We're complaining about something
that doesn't exist.
"1 just wish I knew for certain what Reagan
was after. Maybe I'd feel better."
Where's the Chief?
"You know as well as I do," said the skep
tic, "that Reagan, like the rest of us, wants to
be safe. He uses a continuing strategy to
achieve this. A lot of all this activity is just the
latest in a series of maneuvers in keeping with
that strategy. Now we've used the maneuvers
to step up the warning, to meet the increased
threat posed by the Mi. . ."
"By the MiGs that don't exist?"
A pregnant pause
The skeptic paused.
"Look," he said, "let me put it another
way. Even The Daily editors said the Soviets

are sending massive arms shipments to
Nicaragua, and have been since 1980.
Whether or not there were any MiGs is irrele
vant. There were helicopters and guns on
hoard. I think we are justified in seeing these
as a threat to us, not just as a defense against
us. No one knows how situations like this will
turn out."
There was a moment of silence.
"Isn't that why wars usually start?"
ventured the student softly, pained, looking
out into the soft rain, into the night beyond
the window.
But I just had to look
"I mean, at least I believe Reagan wants to
solve the problem, and 1 hope he does. I don't
believe in just turning it off, hoping that it will
just 'be resolved' in some way . .
"War bothers me, too. I think 1 have as
good an idea as anybody about why it starts. 1
mean, I've read books. In this case I think we
have a responsibility to defend ourselves,
before it gets tool big too handle. We
shouldn't just sit here and wait for it to hap
pen, for them to . .
The skeptic broke off, puzzled.
"I don't want war, but I don't see anything /
can do about it until after it starts, when I'd
have to join up. That's why I'm for pressuring
the Sandinistas, so I won't have to fight in a
bigger war."
Hope you guessed my name
"... and I don't know if war is the end, or
just the means toward something else. If war
was inevitable, then that 'something else'
could become such an intricate part of history.

of our own everyday lives, that there'd be no
way we could ever extricate it."
Caught in the cycle, both fretted.
"I just can't figure out what's going on.
How can war be stopped if we keep seeing it
as unstoppable, or keep using it in small doses
of 'preventive reaction,' like we're doing
now?"
Let's go crazy!
Yet another silence loomed before them.
"I think that question has a great chance of
being an exercise in futility," submitted the
skeptic, again skeptical.
"Well, maybe so, but you have to ask it.
Otherwise, what's your alternative? As for
me, if I don't try and puzzle this out, then I
find myself just sitting back, waiting almost
eagerly for something to happen. It's as
though I wanted it to happen, just so I could
accept whatever was in the air, and not have
to worry about it or stop it. That's why war is
crazy. It demands that everyone go insane and
fight, to keep from going crazy with uncer
tainty first."
Trite — but true?
"Well, anyway," observed the skeptic. "It's
late, and I'm tired. Do you have any ideas for
a lasting peace? If not, I'm going to bed."
"Maybe I can't say anything about war in
general. But for this war, I think we still have
a chance. No," he interrupted the widening
maw of his friend, which he thought was an
objection but was in reality a yawn, "no, this
is a war, or will be one soon. There's always
time left, and where there's time, there's
hope. The United States and the Sandinistas

have blown all hope for political solutions;
they can't see past each other's threats and
posturings.
"The real hope lies in people. The
Nicaraguan people, just like the Cuban and
Soviet people, are fond of us Americans. If we
could somehow create ties with them, maybe
through the Catholic church, then there
would be a better chance that we wouldn't
feel like killing each other. Maybe. I know the
Cubans like baseball; we could send a team
over for games of exhibition and good spirit.
(The Cincinnati Reds, appropriately enough,
almost did so, before the State Department
denied them permission). There are plenty of
opportunities to create some kind of bonds.
They might not keep the world free of con
flict, but they could definitely break this cycle
of anger and tension, which only leads us to
wish for swift, terrible, worst-case solutions
like war."
"I'm sick of being the pawn of this cycle,"
the young man summed up, thrilled by his
words. "I think most other people are, too."

"Nice, very nice," quipped the cynically
hopeful skeptic, "though a trifle trite. I'd like
to believe it was possible; after all, peace is a
wonderful concept. I just hope," he contin
ued, "that someone was listening to you."
"Were you?"' asked the idealist, grinning.
