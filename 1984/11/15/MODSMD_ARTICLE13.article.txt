What's going on?
On the night of Nov. 8, 1984 two
freshman women were allegedly
attacked at a party at the Beta Theta
Pi house, while 10 to 20 people
stood on the sidelines laughing, some
of them even cheering on the as
sailant. A couple of friends of the
women intervened and, the next day,
the alleged assailant turned himself
into the police. He is now up on

more than four separate charges of
assaulting women.
However, a question burns in the
minds of many an outraged Stanford
student: How could this be allowed
to happen?
This is an issue that has plagued an
alarming number of college
campuses nationwide. The Octo
ber/November issue of Campus
Voice reported numerous incidents
of fraternity-involved assaults on

women. During an anti-rape protest
march at the University of Florida,
protesters were heckled and jeered
by a passing truck of "fraternity
men," one of these "men" even
going so far as to shout, "Stop com
plaining about rape. You're
supposed to give it away."
What is going on here?
Bear in mind that 1 am not lam
basting the entire Greek system.
However, in cases such as this, one

must ask, "What kind of mentality
are we dealing with?"
Who do these people think they
are? What right have they to inflict
themselves on anyone — in this case
women — with absolutely no
thought of consequence? Why
should college women across the
country, and particularly on the
Stanford campus, have to live in
fear? What's more, how is it that, in
the reported Beta Theta Pi incident,

no one, save the friends of the wo
men who were allegedly attacked,
and a couple of others, took any kind
of action? The rest simply stood on
the sides and watched this horren
dous act and cheered as if it were
some kind of bizarre spectator sport.
Not even the considerable amount of
alcohol that probably flowed at this
party can be thought as an excuse for
this kind of absolutely reprehensible
behavior.

These people, fraternity "men"
and outsiders alike, should take a
really good, serious look at them
selves. Stanford students, as a whole,
must be more conscientious. This
kind of behavior simply cannot be
tolerated or allowed to continue. If it
happened to strangers yesterday, it
could happen to your friends tomor
row. Think about it.
