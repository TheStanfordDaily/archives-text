## Why is divestiture not feasible? 
### 
Vice President William Massy contributed a
piece to this page's ongoing discussion of invest
ment in companies doing business in South Africa
(The Daily, Oct. 31). While appreciating his
reasonable tone and positive intent, that tone
should not be allowed to paper over the gaps in his
"selective divestment" apologia.
Massy asserts that Stanford already has a respon
sible policy. He outlines two steps, proxy voting

VIEWPOINT

and carefully considered divestiture, plus a body,
the Committee on Investment Responsibility
(CIR), to do research and recommend actions to
the board of trustees. Looks fine at first glance,
but its faults have fairly leaped to the forefront
lately.
If I understand the facts correctly, Stanford has
voted in proxy for Motorola Corp. to reform its
South African policies, but despite significant
proxy pressure. Motorola has actually behaved
worse, ignoring its shareholders. Hardly surprising,
for, nationwide, shareholder pressure has yet to
produce a significant body of reform as regards cor
porate policy in South Africa. Proxy votes have
eased consciences, but changed little.
How did Stanford respond? By quintupling its
holdings in Motorola. If a "responsibility" policy
can allow such a gross anomaly, some things are
fundamentally wrong with it, no matter who put it
together.
One major problem is readily apparent. There is
no preventive check against acquiring stock in
potentially irresponsible companies. Current policy
starts from the disadvantage of trying to overturn
the status quo, rather than keeping a problematic
stock out of the portfolio in the first place.
This could be a useful new role for the CIR. Are

there any trustees on it? If not, appoint some, per
haps Massy, to give its recommendations more
weight to the board, then ask it to assess potential
acquisitions and report its findings to the appropri
ate body before purchases are authorized.
The University's record on Motorola has made a
mockery of its current policy's intentions. You
can't argue "responsibility" from a baldly
regressive track record. If he means to press his
case against total divestment. Massy should start by
committing himself to making a selective policy ac
tually work. He could really start by redefining the
goal as a responsible investment.
Yet Massy's arguments against total divestment
ultimately ring hollow. He deems total divestment
irresponsible because it short-circuits due process
to individual responsible employers in South
Africa. Massy commendably wants good behavior,
but if he will agree with me that support of apar
theid constitutes "bad" behavior, then I propose to
him, regardless of individual intentions, U.S.
multinationals must systematically have an over
whelmingly negative impact.
Foreign multinational corporations generate
roughly 30 percent of South Africa's GNP. Yet
these companies, responsible and otherwise, em
ploy only about 3 percent of South Africa's
workforce. Even if all foreign companies were re
sponsible employees — and South African apar
theid law limits just how responsibly they can act,
even if they uneconomically want to — their ma
terial support to the apartheid regime would still
vastly outweigh their positive impact on the system.
So these more responsible firms, like proxies,
ease our consciences, but they (more fundamen
tally) further entrench the existing system while
doing so.
Massy argues that divestiture is a step soon for

gotten, and that withdrawal from the arena of
shareholder action means a loss of voice. Time and
experience have proven these apparently
reasonable approaches wrong.
But when Cornell's Investment Proxy Advisory
Committee, similar to CIR, threatened to recom
mend divestment from Mobil a few years ago, its
members were hastily brought down to corporate
headquarters and discouraged at great length by a
series of vice presidents. No company likes the bad
publicity of major institutional divestment over
South Africa. Yet, ironically, no step short of it has
much impact.
The "no impact after divestiture" argument is
also simply wrong with regard to how South Africa
sees such moves. When the city of Pittsburgh
refused to accept a South African Honorary Con
sul, did anyone in the United States think it had
much impact? Did our national media even cover
it? I was in South Africa at the time, and it received
front-page headlines and lead-story radio
coverage. People asked me about it for the next
month.
Total divestment is hardly the irresponsible act
Massy describes. Perhaps, rather, our unwillingness
to abandon incrementalism and squarely face the
larger picture is. Apartheid is horrific, crushing,
dehumanizing and murderous. It is also a deeply
entrenched system, and must be treated as such.
Total divestment is responsible and effective. It
makes an unmistakably clear, meaningful state
ment. It has been done in other places, and it could
be done here. Considering the referendum result
on Motorola, next year's election question might be
whether it should be done here. Meanwhile,
selective divestment and responsible investment
could at least be pursued seriously and consistently.
