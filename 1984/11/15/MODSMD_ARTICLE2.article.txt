# Safe construction?
## Professor's concern sparks action 
### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
In response to a professor's charge that
campus construction projects are in violation of
state and federal safety regulations, the Univer
sity has abandoned its "hands-off" policy by in
troducing measures to encourage contractors to
adopt responsible safety standards.
Raymond Levitt, professor of civil engineer
ing, has waged a six-month campaign to alert
the University to construction projects that he
says pose a serious danger to Stanford students,
staff, faculty and visitors. According to Levitt,
the current glut of campus construction is just
an accident waiting to happen.
"I think we're dicing with fate, waiting for a
serious injury," Levitt said.
According to July statistics, there are 32
campus construction projects underway at a
cost of $71 million.
Levitt, who has spent 15 years researching
construction safety, brought the safety issue to
the attention of the Department of Facilities
Project Management in May. On Aug. 25,
Levitt met with Stanford officials to discuss how
the University can improve construction safety.
Since that meeting, the Facilities Project
manager at facilities project management, the
role by formulating a safety plan and imparting
certain guidelines to its contractors.
Levitt reports that current campus construc
tion violations include:
• Unshored trenches more than five feet deep
around Bowman Alumni House;
• Workers without hard hats;
• Workers handling heavy equipment while
wearing unprotective tennis shoes;
• Trucks and other vehicles that travel in

reverse without an alarm sound;
• Heavy equipment and trucks working without
traffic flagmen on Mayfield Avenue near the
Braun Music Center;
• Unsafe scaffolding on the side of Terman En
gineering Center;
• Large holes and trenches without sufficient
barricades behind Terman and on Panama
Street.
According to Levitt, these violations
endanger both workers and "third party"
people who are just walking or biking across
campus. He reported seeing at least one bike
accident caused by construction hazards. The
open trenches have also claimed numerous flat
tires, bent wheel rims and twisted ankles.
Levitt said he was "very encouraged" by the
University's response at the August meeting but
feels Stanford could still show more concern.
He has asked that a task force be established to
study the problem and said he is still waiting for
"a statement of affirmative action in this area
from someone high up."
According to Curtis Williams, engineering
manager at facilities project management, the
department has responded to remarks from
Levitt and others by instituting a policy that in
cludes selecting future contractors and review
ing existing contracts on the basis of safety. In
addition, Williams said the department is creat
ing a print or video orientation package to alert
construction workers to the unique safety prob
lems at Stanford — mainly bicyclists and
pedestrians.
"Safety is a much higher [criterion] in the se
lection of contractors" than it has been in previ-

University planners say Stanford has abandoned its "hands-off
liability policy to encourage construction contractors to abide by more
stringent safety standards. According to July statistics, there are 32
campus construction projects underway at a cost of $71 million.
