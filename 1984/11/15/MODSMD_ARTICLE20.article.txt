## Jason Cole In the proper spirit 
### 
I was going to have another in
stallment of the game, "Guess
what today's column is about?"
However, I figured I'd have to
give out too many prizes. The an
swer is all too obvious.
Yes Virginia, there is a Santa
Claus, and today's column is about
Big Game.
But if you expect me to tell you
who's going to win the annual bat
tle between Stanford and
Berkeley, you're going to be
sorely disappointed.
The fact of the matter is that I
just don't know. I'm also tired ot
making predictions. Of the four
Big Games that I've been to, 1
thought that the Cardinal was
going to win three of them easily.
I was right once.
In last year's game, I figured
Stanford would be really fired up
because it was Coach Paul Wig
gin's final game. You know, all
that "Win one for the Wig"
sentimentality and everything.
Thus, I expected it to be at least a
close game.
I was wrong.
That's because some really
strange things tend to happen
during Big Games. In 1970, a
Rose Bowl-bound Stanford team
was 6-0 in the then Pacific 8 Con
ference and 8-2 overall. It was
facing a Cal team that was 3-3 in
the conference and 5-5 overall.
That Stanford team also
featured Heisman Trophy winner
Jim Plunkett. Cal wen 22-14.
But that's only a minor oc
curence. Other things like one
bounce touchdown receptions,
five-lateral plays, missed calls and
trOmbone-playing free safeties are
all part of Big Game lore.
Another strange thing that's be
coming prevalent in Big Game is
some very unsportsmanlike con
duct. No. I don't mean the conduct
of the football players; I mean the
conduct of the fans.
Last year, two rather disturbing
forms of school spirit reared their
ugly heads. One was a button
saving, "We Got In." The other
was a shirt with the words "Fuck
Cal."
This year, along with the usual
"Beat Cal" or "Beat the Weenies"
buttons and shirts, there is a shirt
. that features a big red "S" with
slashes through it to make it look
"HlTe a dollar sign.
..Jslow, I don't have anything
gainst school spirit and I certainly
Jkijii't have anything., against
ifiaking fun of the opponent. But,

being a student of a university as
supposedly fine as this one, I ex
pect school spirit to have a bit of
intelligence and decorum.
Saying things like "We Got In,"
besides belaboring the obvious, is
like an eight-year-old child
showing off his new bike to an
other kid whose parents can't af
ford to buy him a bike.
I don't mean to liken Cal stu
dents to the poor kid down the
street. I'm sure they're perfectly
happy to go Cal, even if they did
or didn't get into Stanford. I would
also hope that Stanford students
can be more mature than eight
year-old children.
Making crude suggestions is
even more deplorable. I should
hardly be the one to decry the use
of obscenities, but 1 would never
use such language as a rallying cry.
For those of you who do use
profanity in such a wanton man
ner, I have only one suggestion.
Transfer.
Regarding the dollar signs, I
have to say I really don't under
stand the intent of this shirt. It Jan
mean any number of things rang
ing from the notion that all Stan
ford students are rich, all Stanford
students are going to be rich or all
Stanford students pay too much
tuition.
The first scenario is,far from the
truth. If it were true, then why are
the majority of students on some
form of financial aid?
The second scenario seems to be
the likely rallying cry, but is still
somewhat untrue. Although I
know plenty of Stanford students
who want fo become wealthy, not
all students share that aim. I'm
also sure that this outlook on life is
shared by our Cal counterparts, so
how does this shirt differentiate
Stanford from its archrival?
The final scenario is the truth,
pure and simple. Paying tens of
thousands of dollars for an educa
tion is crazy, even if it's worth it.
But even if it is true, why should
you be so proud of it?
Also, and this goes for all Cal
fans who may read this, don't
spray paint things like "Go Card"
or "Go Bears" all over the place.
Nothing is more inane.
So for the next couple of days,
show some school spirit. Go to
Gaieties, go to the rally in the City,
go to the game, hate Cal, cheer for
Stanford and have a good time.
But do so with intelligence and
taste. Show your true colors.
