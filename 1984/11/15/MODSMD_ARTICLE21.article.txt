### DARREN THORNEY CROFT Staff sports writer 
A Giancarlo Ferruzzi goal with 30
seconds remaining gave the Stanford
men's soccer team a 2-1 victory over
the University of Santa Clara yester
day in the season finale for both
teams.
Stanford and Santa Clara have
been rivals in the past, with hard
fought and often rough matches. 1 his
game was no different.
After a scoreless first half, Ferruzzi
capitalized on a Bronco defensive
lapse by intercepting a back pass from
a Santa Clara defender, beating
Bronco goalkeeper Eric Koch one
on-one, and shooting into an empty
net.
The Cardinal, which controlled
most of the play in the first half and
the first part of the second half,
seemed to struggle late in the game,
resisting numerous attacks on goal by
the Broncos, who kept the ball in
Stanford's half most of the last 20
minutes.
With about 10 minutes to go, it
paid off as Bronco midfielder Andy
McDiarmind chest-trapped a cross,
brought it under control and chipped
a high shot past Cardinal goalkeeper
Willy Burkhardt.
Both teams pressed hard for the
winning goal, but it took until the last
minute of the game until Ferruzzi,
with assists from juniors Rob West
and Tom Rafalovich, beat Koch from
close range again.
Stanford finished the season 4-3 in
the Pacific Soccer Conference and
11-7-3 overall, while Santa Clara
finished at 2-5 in the PSC and 7-10-3
for the season.
The game was the last in the
careers of seniors Burkhardt, fullback
Charlie Crane, fullback Tom McGan
non and midfielder Fred Ueland.
Ferruzzi, also a senior, redshirted his
freshman year and has a season of
eligibility left if he decides to use it.

Burkhardt finishes this season with
five shutouts, 89 saves and a 1.58
goals-against average, and set a
school record for career shutouts (24)
and saves for a season (135). Ueland
scored a goal and an assist for three
points, Crane had two assists, and
McGannon, who started every game
along with Crane in the backfield,
provided crucial support from his
stopper back position.
McGannon called it a "satisfying
win," and said, " It's a big culmination
to a season and a career. A lot of
people had a lot of fun." Burkhardt,
who made 9 saves and stopped three
Santa Clara breakaways, was also
happy with the victory. "We played
with a lot of enthusiasm," he said.
"The game meant a lot to us and a
hell of a lot to me."
West, who finished third in scoring
with 14 points on six goals and two
assists, said he felt the Cardinal
"controlled the tempo for most of the
game. We went out with a relaxed at
titude. and still won."
Ferruzzi finished the season as the
Cardinal's leading scorer with nine
goals and 10 assists for 28 points,
while Tom Rafalovich, coming up
from sweeper back, which is the last
fullback in front of the goalkeeper,
was second with six goals and four as
sists for 16 points. Tom's twin brother
Todd was fourth with four goals, and
seven other Cardinal players had at
least one goal each.
Sam Koch, who ended his first
season as Stanford's head coach after
the firing of Nelson Lodge last spring,
called the victory a "great win." Re
garding the season, Koch said, "1
thought we finished well. Throughout
the season we showed we could com
pete with anyone, but we had trouble
against some of the weaker teams."
Ueland said he felt the season
"went surprisingly well considering
we had a tougher schedule than in the
past."
