# Women golfers take fifth place

### ROB GRAHAM Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford women's golf team
might have experienced a slight let
down yesterday as it finished a distant
fifth in the three-day, 54-hole United
States International Intercollegiate
held in Rancho Bernardo.
The story for the Cardinal was its
inability to sustain the momentum
left over from its triumph two weeks
ago in the Stanford Women's Inter
collegiate. The women struggled and
finished 18 strokes back of the victor,
the University of Southern Califor
nia.
USC, with a total of 927, fought off
the strong challenge of runner-up
Brigham Young University, which
finished- with 928. San Jose State
University ended in third with 934
while UCLA wound up fourth with
939. A field of 15 teams competed at

the par-73, 6,100-yard Rancho Ber
nardo Country Club.
Stanford's best individual perfor
mance was lodged by sophomore
Kathleen McCarthy whose nine
over-par 228 placed her in seventh
overall. Even though she finished in
seventh, McCarthy was only four
stokes back of the individual cham
pion, Sherri Stienhauer of the Uni
versity of Texas. Theresa Schrek of
the University of New Mexico was
just one shot off Stienhauer's pace.
Rounding out the rest of the Card
inal's scoring were Kathy Kostas
(236), Kay Cornelius (240), Trish
McGonigle (243) and Stephanie
Kondick (244).
The women will have a while to
contemplate their mediocre effort in
Rancho Bernardo becanse their next
tournament, the Desert Classic in
Isultry Palm Springs, isn't until the
winter break, on Jan. 2-4.
