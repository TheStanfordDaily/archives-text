# Promotion from club level works for soccer
## Women even the score in varsity 
### SUZY SHIMEK 
An overall record of 7-7 might not usually indicate an
extraordinary season for a Stanford team. But for the wo
men's soccer team — joining the varsity ranks for the first
time this year — the significance of this season went
beyond the simple tallying of losses and victories.
After many years as a club sport, the soccer team was
granted varsity status this year in response to "a growing
interest in women's soccer and a growing popularity in the
area," according to Stanford Athletic Director Andy
Geiger.
Stanford has enjoyed a dominance in women's soccer in
Northern California since it instituted the sport in
the mid-19705. Head Coach Helen Keohane recalls com
ing to play Stanford for the first time in 1974 as a player
on the University of California at Berkeley team "and
getting wiped off the field."
"Many of the women coming out had never played soc
cer before, never even been athletic before. Stanford was
one of the few teams that had players who had played
youth soccer," Keohane said of those beginning days of
women's soccer.
The days of easy Stanford wins appear to be over,
however, as other teams have grown more competitive.
Most of Stanford's traditional competition, teams such as
Cal, the University of California at Davis and the Univer
sity of Santa Clara, have also turned varsity during the past
two years.
Keohane attributed the heightened quality of play to
the growing popularity of youth soccer and to the initia
tion five years ago of a California state select soccer pro
gram for under-19-year-old girls.
"Looking at the schedule you used to be able to list off
six teams that we were going to beat. Now you can't do
that," senior goalkeeper Helen Norton said.
And indeed Stanford did at first have some trouble
chalking up the wins. The team got off to a discouraging
start, losing four out of its first five games. Yet the overall
record of the team at mid-season did not seem to ac
curately reflect the quality of play, as every one of the four
losses was by a one-goal margin.
One of these narrow defeats was a 1-0 loss to Cal, a
team currently headed for the National Collegiate Ath
letic Association semi-finals as the winner of the Western
Region.
"If you lose 6-0," Keohane commented, "you know
you really had no chance. If you lose by one goal, it's
sometimes tougher to swallow."
The repeated losses definitely lowered team morale.
"The attitude was that we could have lost by more
(goals)," sophomore defender Ann Youmans said.
Amy Geisse, a sophomore midfielder, echoed similar
sentiments. "We were looking at our overall record and
not at the scores."
But midway through the season came the turning point.
Stanford won two out of three games in the Central
Florida State Tournament for a third-place overall finish.
The day after the tournament Stanford proceeded to beat

second-place finisher Texas A & M, 1-0.
"Those four games really turned it around," Keohane
said.

Keohane said the purpose of the trip to Florida was to
gain exposure for West Coast soccer in the eyes of the
Eastern soccer powers, something that Stanford seems to

have effectively done.
Although ths University of Central Florida, another
team headed for the NCAA semi-finals, beat Stanford, 5-
0, Stanford obviously made something of an impression.
"The score I don't think is an indication of the match,"
Keohane said. "The Florida coach sent a letter to Andy
Geiger complimenting Stanford on play and team organi
zation."
Stanford also had two players, striker Sue Moore and
sweeper Carol Berryman, named to the all-tournament
team.
"We realized we could win and decided to do it,"
Youmans said.
With the tournament wins, Stanford proceeded to
reverse its record from the first half of the season and win
five of its last seven games. Part of the change might have
resulted from increased confidence in playing together, as
Stanford is a relatively young team, having lost six players
last year.
"The majority of the players are freshmen and soph
omores. They're still testing each other out," Keohane
said.
Even if the team was not as successful as hoped in terms
of overall standings, the season was nonetheless signifi
cant for the players on the first varsity women's soccer
team in Stanford history. The changes for the team as it
turned varsity seemed subtle but important. As a club
team, funding for the team came primarily from student
fee assessments, individual team-member pockets and
fund raising.
"We're still fund raising just as hard," Norton said. The
team has cleaned up the football stadium after games and
sold posters to raise money. But Norton cited such new
benefits as having athletic trainers on the sidelines during
games as forward progress. As a Varsity II level sport, the
team is eligible to compete in NCAA playoffs and
receives funding for equipment, local travel and a part
time coach from the Athletic Department.
Having a new coach hired specifically for the women's
soccer team — in the past the team has been coached by
the men's assistant coach and volunteers — may have
been one of the biggest advances and moral boosts for the
team.
Keohane has impressive qualifications both as a player
and coach in a sport where women are just starting to in
filtrate the coaching ranks. Keohane played for Cal as an
undergraduate, has continued to play in Bay Area leagues
and for the past two years has played on the Western
Regional soccer team.
Keohane earned her level "B" coaching license from
one of the United States Soccer Federation coaching
schools in 1977. Keohane said that there was only one
other woman taking her "B" level exam the year she at
tended the school. "We were supposedly the first two wo
men in the nation to go through," Keohane said.
Keohane has coached youth soccer, the girls under-19
state select team and the Berkeley High School varsity
girls' team.

The Stanford women's soccer team started off the season a little off balance as it lost several close games.
But after the Central Florida Tournament, the team got its offense going and evened out its season, finishing
7-7 overall.

start, losing four out of its first five games. Yet the overall
record of the team at mid-season did not seem to ac
curately reflect the quality of play, as every one of the four
losses was by a one-goal margin.
One of these narrow defeats was a 1-0 loss to Cal, a
team currently headed for the National Collegiate Ath
letic Association semi-finals as the winner of the Western
Region.
"If you lose 6-0," Keohane commented, "you know
you really had no chance. If you lose by one goal, it's
sometimes tougher to swallow."
The repeated losses definitely lowered team morale.
"The attitude was that we could have lost by more
(goals)," sophomore defender Ann Youmans said.
Amy Geisse, a sophomore midfielder, echoed similar
sentiments. "We were looking at our overall record and
not at the scores."
But midway through the season came the turning point.
Stanford won two out of three games in the Central
Florida State Tournament for a third-place overall finish.
The day after the tournament Stanford proceeded to beat

second-place finisher Texas A & M, 1-0.
"Those four games really turned it around," Keohane
said.

Keohane said the purpose of the trip to Florida was to
gain exposure for West Coast soccer in the eyes of the
Eastern soccer powers, something that Stanford seems to

have effectively done.
Although ths University of Central Florida, another
team headed for the NCAA semi-finals, beat Stanford, 5-
0, Stanford obviously made something of an impression.
"The score I don't think is an indication of the match,"
Keohane said. "The Florida coach sent a letter to Andy
Geiger complimenting Stanford on play and team organi
zation."
Stanford also had two players, striker Sue Moore and
sweeper Carol Berryman, named to the all-tournament
team.
"We realized we could win and decided to do it,"
Youmans said.
With the tournament wins, Stanford proceeded to
reverse its record from the first half of the season and win
five of its last seven games. Part of the change might have
resulted from increased confidence in playing together, as
Stanford is a relatively young team, having lost six players
last year.
"The majority of the players are freshmen and soph
omores. They're still testing each other out," Keohane
said.
Even if the team was not as successful as hoped in terms
of overall standings, the season was nonetheless signifi
cant for the players on the first varsity women's soccer
team in Stanford history. The changes for the team as it
turned varsity seemed subtle but important. As a club
team, funding for the team came primarily from student
fee assessments, individual team-member pockets and
fund raising.
"We're still fund raising just as hard," Norton said. The
team has cleaned up the football stadium after games and
sold posters to raise money. But Norton cited such new
benefits as having athletic trainers on the sidelines during
games as forward progress. As a Varsity II level sport, the
team is eligible to compete in NCAA playoffs and
receives funding for equipment, local travel and a part
time coach from the Athletic Department.
Having a new coach hired specifically for the women's
soccer team — in the past the team has been coached by
the men's assistant coach and volunteers — may have
been one of the biggest advances and moral boosts for the
team.
Keohane has impressive qualifications both as a player
and coach in a sport where women are just starting to in
filtrate the coaching ranks. Keohane played for Cal as an
undergraduate, has continued to play in Bay Area leagues
and for the past two years has played on the Western
Regional soccer team.
Keohane earned her level "B" coaching license from
one of the United States Soccer Federation coaching
schools in 1977. Keohane said that there was only one
other woman taking her "B" level exam the year she at
tended the school. "We were supposedly the first two wo
men in the nation to go through," Keohane said.
Keohane has coached youth soccer, the girls under-19
state select team and the Berkeley High School varsity
girls' team.

The Stanford women's soccer team started off the season a little off balance as it lost several close games.
But after the Central Florida Tournament, the team got its offense going and evened out its season, finishing
7-7 overall.
An overall record of 7-7 might not usually indicate an
extraordinary season for a Stanford team. But for the wo
men's soccer team — joining the varsity ranks for the first
time this year — the significance of this season went
beyond the simple tallying of losses and victories.
After many years as a club sport, the soccer team was
granted varsity status this year in response to "a growing
interest in women's soccer and a growing popularity in the
area," according to Stanford Athletic Director Andy
Geiger.
Stanford has enjoyed a dominance in women's soccer in
Northern California since it instituted the sport in
the mid-19705. Head Coach Helen Keohane recalls com
ing to play Stanford for the first time in 1974 as a player
on the University of California at Berkeley team "and
getting wiped off the field."
"Many of the women coming out had never played soc
cer before, never even been athletic before. Stanford was
one of the few teams that had players who had played
youth soccer," Keohane said of those beginning days of
women's soccer.
The days of easy Stanford wins appear to be over,
however, as other teams have grown more competitive.
Most of Stanford's traditional competition, teams such as
Cal, the University of California at Davis and the Univer
sity of Santa Clara, have also turned varsity during the past
two years.
Keohane attributed the heightened quality of play to
the growing popularity of youth soccer and to the initia
tion five years ago of a California state select soccer pro
gram for under-19-year-old girls.
"Looking at the schedule you used to be able to list off
six teams that we were going to beat. Now you can't do
that," senior goalkeeper Helen Norton said.
And indeed Stanford did at first have some trouble
chalking up the wins. The team got off to a discouraging
start, losing four out of its first five games. Yet the overall
record of the team at mid-season did not seem to ac
