## The 						Farm's charms make alums keep coming back for more 
### MARC PEYSER 
They come every year, some out of
curiosity, some to renew old
friendships. Wearing the obligatory
cardinal and marching off to perhaps
their first football game in decades,
most come from within California, al
though there are always some who
venture from the East, and even one
or two from Europe.
They've been out five, 10, or as
many as 50 years, yet they keep com
ing back, somewhat like the swallows
to Capistrano, but more on the order
of students returning after summer
vacation — with a mixture of eager
ness, excitment and apprehension.
Call it school pride, or even self pride,
Alumni Weekend — this year the
first weekend in November— will al
ways find curious graduates returning
to the Farm.
"I'm a nerd, not a joiner," said
Patric Sherman, '49, who returned to
campus from Kansas City for this
year's Alumni Weekend. It was Sher
man's first time back to Stanford
since he graduated. "This is a sen
timental journey."
"Stanford is a unique part of my
life, much more than a school," said
Ron Allen, '54. "It's a part of your
past that continues to grow on you.
It's good to be back."
Every year, approximately 1,500
Stanford alumni return to campus for
the Stanford Alumni Weekend.
Scheduled to coincide with the home
football game against USC or UCLA,
the reunions are perhaps the most
traditional and well-known way in
which the University maintains con
tact with its graduates.
"Part of the fun is coming back to

campus and going to the football
games," according to Karen Porter,
associate director of ciubs, reunions
and student services for the Alumni
Association. But she adds that
reminiscing with friends is only part
of the day's overall scheme, and only
one of the reasons for bringing an
alumus back every five years.
Before the Saturday tailgaters
begin, the alumni are busy getting
reacquainted with the campus and its
facilities. Starting with a tour of Bow
man Alumni House and running
through meetings, receptions with
University President Donald Ken
nedy and representatives from the
development office as well as intellec
tual discussions on topics ranging
from the nature of poems to the na
ture of the budget deficit, the day is
nothing short of a crash course on
Stanford life today.
"A great school has to change,"
said Sherman. "It has to move, to
grow or else it's dead. It's good to see
— the life."
'there's a sort of nostalgia to sit
ting in a class," said Nancy Longley
Aptus, '49, "especially knowing there
are no exams."
While it is perhaps the largest on
campus activity for alumni, the
reunion weekend is by no means the
only tie between graduates and the
University. The Alumni Association
is just as content to take a little bit of
Stanford to individual'cities as it is to
have alumni come back to the Farm.
Ever since the first graduating class
in the 1890s, alumni have met in in
formal groups in their home towns,
according to Carolyn Manning,
Alumni Association director of clubs.

reunions and student services. And
more than 100 clubs throughout the
world have grown out of those small,
spontaneous beginnings.
Most students become acquainted
with the clubs at area parties thrown
for them before their freshman year
— but the groups fill many other
needs. The clubs may organize social
and political forums or holiday par
ties. Perhaps the most important
function of these groups is to help
alumni to keep in touch with the Uni

versity.
"They're like an umbilical cord to
the University," said Sally Haughn
Boehn, '74, who, although active in
her club in San Diego, made her first
return visit to campus for her 10th
renuion on Nov. 3.
Most clubs host monthly speakers
— often Stanford professors — and
some, especially the "juniors," who
have been out for fewer than 10 years,
organize social get-togethers like
theater nights or cooking classes.

A few even do spectacular things.
The Seattle-area club, for instance,
initiated what they called SASSY —
Scholarship Auction for Stanford
Students and You. By soliciting ordi
nary items — donated dinners — and
the unusual — an orig
inal, signed Wallace Stegner
poem — they were able to raise more
than $10,000 for the University
scholarship fund.
In Washington, D.C., and New
York, the clubs have arranged for Big

Game to be broadcast over local
radio stations. All of these activities,
though, are conducted by volunteers
and are designed to serve alumni at
home.
"There's a personal contact, a one
on-one in the hometown," Manning
said. For those who can't get back to
campus, being active in the clubs "is a
nice way to give something back" to
the University, she said.
On occasion, however, the Alumni
Association does take its show on the
road in order to reach an even bigger
audience in an even grander way.
One of the largest-scale examples of
this is last year's Stanford in New
York Conference, titled "Life in the
21st Century."
While its underlying intent, like so
many Alumni Association programs,
was educational, the conference was
also an effort to coalesce individual
alumni on the other side of the
country.
"We wanted to do something big
— grab the attention of people in the
East [and let them know] that Stan
ford was there," Manning said. "We
roused expectation" of the Univer
sity's role in the area, she added.
The three-day conference, which
was lead by 27 faculty members who
were flown out to lead the program,
was aimed at the more than 7,000
alumni in the New York City area.
Billed as "not only the most am
bitious but also the most successful
Stanford undertaking afield in the in
stitution's history," the conference
has led to plans for a similar venture
in Paris in the fall of 1986 as well as
the opening of a permanent branch of
the development office in New York.

But whether they are raising
money f« r students at a club auction
or catching up on class gossip at the
reunion, the one thing that all alumni
can be assured of getting is at least a
small dose of education.
"A lot of the point in coming back
is (for alumni) to see each other,"
said Alumni Association Director
William Stone. "If all we did were
cocktail parties and football games, it
would miss the point of trying to show
off what an exciting place this is. We
take an interest in athletics and nos
talgia, but 1 like to make sure people
get a dose of something challenging."
For many, the intellectual chal
lenge is provided by Stanford's exten
sive continuing education programs.
Running the gamut from seminars on
"A Practical Guide to the Income
Tax" to the perennially popular
Great Authors Lecture Series, the
association runs 25 programs each
year, both on campus and in such ex
otic places as the Stanford Sierra
Camp, Fallen Leaf Lake, and even
one — the Summer Symposia on Re
naissance Florence — on the Stanford
campus in Italy.
Although some programs, like the
intensive, two-week executive educa
tion program, are strongly vocation
related, the purpose of continuing
education is not merely to supple
ment on-the-job training, according
to Marion Player, director of the con
tinuing education program.
"It's a chance to not so much con
tinue education but to get back in
touch with the intellectual self," she
said. "People want something more
than what they get from their 40- to
50-hour work week."

Toward that end, Player and her
co-workers are about to launch a new
project that, like the clubs, will serve
alumni who are unable to take advan
tage of the on-campus programs.
Called the "Audible Stanford," the
program consists of a series of cas
settes, each with one of more than 80
taped lectures of Stanford professors
in all fields: politics, environmental
issues, engineering, art and literature.
"This institution is a tremendous
educational resource," Player said.

"Our first goal is to get as many
people involved in continuing educa
tion as possible."
Yet, while the success of pilot pro
grams like the Audible Stanford lies,
to a large degree, in planning and
marketing, the very structure of the
Alumni Association and its philoso
phy do much to secure constant
alumni involvement in the University.
"We hit people where they live,
cater to different needs," said Stone.
The clubs, for instance, are de

signed to attract the younger
graduate who is unable to come back
to school while the reunions contact
people every five years.
Perhaps the most successful
method ot informing alumni of Uni
versity is through mailings, especially
the Stanford Magazine and the Stan
ford Observer.
"For those alums who don't live in
tHe immediate area, we could be the
only link" to the University, accord
ing to Debby Fife, editor and
manager of the magazine. And,
while "99 percent of the articles are
Stanford related," Fife feels that the
magazine's most vital section — "the
backbone" — is the class notes.
"Our goal is to get as many names
in the pages in the book," she said.
"The more names, the more people
get involved. If we published nothing
else we would publish them."
"I love mv magazine and my Ob
server," Sherman said. "I think the
Observer is the best thing I've ever
seen."
Between the quarterly magazine,
the Observer, which is published
seven times annually, and the other
Alumni Association mailings, Stone
has estimated that more than four
million pieces of mail are sent each
year to approximately 130,000
alumni. That's an average of more
than 30 pieces of mail per person.
In addition to deluging graduates
with mailings throughout the year,
the association tries to give students
a preview of alumni life throughout
their student years. The alumni con
tact service, for instance, make«
available names of Stanford business

people in cities all across the country
who are willing to help students find
internships and jobs.
In addition, the association coor
dinates numerous opportunities for
social interaction, including senior
brunches, junior study breaks and a
freshman "home-away-from-home"
program, all of which give students an
opportunity to spend time with
alumni.
"We try to acquaint people with
the opportunities and responsibilities
of being alums before they leave,"
Stone said.
Yet for many, participating in most
of the alumni activities still poses a
difficulty.
"I feel I owe a great many things to
the University," said Jim Gordon,
'54. "Because I can't give my time, I
give generously of my money. But if
the University called on me, I would
be there to help."
In fact, even though it is not di
rectly related to Alumni Association
activities, the success of fund raising
has rivaled that of much of the pro
gramming.
Last year, for instance, alumni con
tributions to the annual fund, which
disperses its money to all parts of the
University, totaled $11.8 million, up
from $10 million the previous year.
And not included in that figure is a
$20 million gift/pledge from David
Packard for a new children's hospital.
"Very large gifts are not an
everyday thing," said David Fulton,
director of development communica
tions. "They have always been a big
event for us."
Another source of donations are
the Buck and Cardinal clubs. Each

solicits money to be used for Stanford
athletic scholarships. The Buck Club,
which gives money to aid male ath
letes in all varsity sports, last year
raised $2.1 million.
Its counterpart, the Cardinal Club,
raised an additional $700,000 for
female athletes through mail, phone
and personal solicitations. Of that,
$235,000 was raised from a single
auction. Each group is the most suc
cessful of its kind in the country, ac
cording to the clubs' directors.
"We have an incredible group of
alums," said Donna Garton, associate
director of development for athletics,
physical education and recreation.
"They are a creative, strong,
stimulating group that loves to be
helping students."
Along with groups like the Mot
hers' Club, which holds its annual
Chrysanthemum-Champagne party
and raised $1 1,500 of scholarship
money as well as providing numerous
other services for both Stanford par
ents and students, the development
side of alumni involvement seems to
be keeping up with the programming.
"There's a real loyalty to this
campus that's hard to pin-point," said
Joan Rutter, president of the Mot
hers' Club." People just get hooked."
But to the alumni who come back
every five years for their reunion and
are continuously involved in all facets
of the University — hooked — some
how doesn't seem to be strong enough.
It's more a case of never having let go.
"My Stanford years are some of the
greatest in my entire life," Gordon
said. "It's the very foundation of what
I've built my life on. I am very proud
of this University."


They come every year, some out of
curiosity, some to renew old

radio stations. All of these activities,
though, are conducted by volunteers
and are designed to serve alumni at
home.
"There's a personal contact, a one
on-one in the hometown," Manning
said. For those who can't get back to
campus, being active in the clubs "is a
nice way to give something back" to
the University, she said.
On occasion, however, the Alumni
Association does take its show on the
road in order to reach an even bigger
audience in an even grander way.
One of the largest-scale examples of
this is last year's Stanford in New
York Conference, titled "Life in the
21st Century."
While its underlying intent, like so
many Alumni Association programs,
was educational, the conference was
also an effort to coalesce individual
alumni on the other side of the
country.
"We wanted to do something big
— grab the attention of people in the
East [and let them know] that Stan
ford was there," Manning said. "We
roused expectation" of the Univer
sity's role in the area, she added.
The three-day conference, which
was lead by 27 faculty members who
were flown out to lead the program,
was aimed at the more than 7,000
alumni in the New York City area.
Billed as "not only the most am
bitious but also the most successful
Stanford undertaking afield in the in
stitution's history," the conference
has led to plans for a similar venture
in Paris in the fall of 1986 as well as
the opening of a permanent branch of
the development office in New York.

But whether they are raising
money f« r students at a club auction
or catching up on class gossip at the
reunion, the one thing that all alumni
can be assured of getting is at least a
small dose of education.
"A lot of the point in coming back
is (for alumni) to see each other,"
said Alumni Association Director
William Stone. "If all we did were
cocktail parties and football games, it
would miss the point of trying to show
off what an exciting place this is. We
take an interest in athletics and nos
talgia, but 1 like to make sure people
get a dose of something challenging."
For many, the intellectual chal
lenge is provided by Stanford's exten
sive continuing education programs.
Running the gamut from seminars on
"A Practical Guide to the Income
Tax" to the perennially popular
Great Authors Lecture Series, the
association runs 25 programs each
year, both on campus and in such ex
otic places as the Stanford Sierra
Camp, Fallen Leaf Lake, and even
one — the Summer Symposia on Re
naissance Florence — on the Stanford
campus in Italy.
Although some programs, like the
intensive, two-week executive educa
tion program, are strongly vocation
related, the purpose of continuing
education is not merely to supple
ment on-the-job training, according
to Marion Player, director of the con
tinuing education program.
"It's a chance to not so much con
tinue education but to get back in
touch with the intellectual self," she
said. "People want something more
than what they get from their 40- to
50-hour work week."

Toward that end, Player and her
co-workers are about to launch a new
project that, like the clubs, will serve
alumni who are unable to take advan
tage of the on-campus programs.
Called the "Audible Stanford," the
program consists of a series of cas
settes, each with one of more than 80
taped lectures of Stanford professors
in all fields: politics, environmental
issues, engineering, art and literature.
"This institution is a tremendous
educational resource," Player said.

"Our first goal is to get as many
people involved in continuing educa
tion as possible."
Yet, while the success of pilot pro
grams like the Audible Stanford lies,
to a large degree, in planning and
marketing, the very structure of the
Alumni Association and its philoso
phy do much to secure constant
alumni involvement in the University.
"We hit people where they live,
cater to different needs," said Stone.
The clubs, for instance, are de

signed to attract the younger
graduate who is unable to come back
to school while the reunions contact
people every five years.
Perhaps the most successful
method ot informing alumni of Uni
versity is through mailings, especially
the Stanford Magazine and the Stan
ford Observer.
"For those alums who don't live in
tHe immediate area, we could be the
only link" to the University, accord
ing to Debby Fife, editor and
manager of the magazine. And,
while "99 percent of the articles are
Stanford related," Fife feels that the
magazine's most vital section — "the
backbone" — is the class notes.
"Our goal is to get as many names
in the pages in the book," she said.
"The more names, the more people
get involved. If we published nothing
else we would publish them."
"I love mv magazine and my Ob
server," Sherman said. "I think the
Observer is the best thing I've ever
seen."
Between the quarterly magazine,
the Observer, which is published
seven times annually, and the other
Alumni Association mailings, Stone
has estimated that more than four
million pieces of mail are sent each
year to approximately 130,000
alumni. That's an average of more
than 30 pieces of mail per person.
In addition to deluging graduates
with mailings throughout the year,
the association tries to give students
a preview of alumni life throughout
their student years. The alumni con
tact service, for instance, make«
available names of Stanford business

people in cities all across the country
who are willing to help students find
internships and jobs.
In addition, the association coor
dinates numerous opportunities for
social interaction, including senior
brunches, junior study breaks and a
freshman "home-away-from-home"
program, all of which give students an
opportunity to spend time with
alumni.
"We try to acquaint people with
the opportunities and responsibilities
of being alums before they leave,"
Stone said.
Yet for many, participating in most
of the alumni activities still poses a
difficulty.
"I feel I owe a great many things to
the University," said Jim Gordon,
'54. "Because I can't give my time, I
give generously of my money. But if
the University called on me, I would
be there to help."
In fact, even though it is not di
rectly related to Alumni Association
activities, the success of fund raising
has rivaled that of much of the pro
gramming.
Last year, for instance, alumni con
tributions to the annual fund, which
disperses its money to all parts of the
University, totaled $11.8 million, up
from $10 million the previous year.
And not included in that figure is a
$20 million gift/pledge from David
Packard for a new children's hospital.
"Very large gifts are not an
everyday thing," said David Fulton,
director of development communica
tions. "They have always been a big
event for us."
Another source of donations are
the Buck and Cardinal clubs. Each

solicits money to be used for Stanford
athletic scholarships. The Buck Club,
which gives money to aid male ath
letes in all varsity sports, last year
raised $2.1 million.
Its counterpart, the Cardinal Club,
raised an additional $700,000 for
female athletes through mail, phone
and personal solicitations. Of that,
$235,000 was raised from a single
auction. Each group is the most suc
cessful of its kind in the country, ac
cording to the clubs' directors.
"We have an incredible group of
alums," said Donna Garton, associate
director of development for athletics,
physical education and recreation.
"They are a creative, strong,
stimulating group that loves to be
helping students."
Along with groups like the Mot
hers' Club, which holds its annual
Chrysanthemum-Champagne party
and raised $1 1,500 of scholarship
money as well as providing numerous
other services for both Stanford par
ents and students, the development
side of alumni involvement seems to
be keeping up with the programming.
"There's a real loyalty to this
campus that's hard to pin-point," said
Joan Rutter, president of the Mot
hers' Club." People just get hooked."
But to the alumni who come back
every five years for their reunion and
are continuously involved in all facets
of the University — hooked — some
how doesn't seem to be strong enough.
It's more a case of never having let go.
"My Stanford years are some of the
greatest in my entire life," Gordon
said. "It's the very foundation of what
I've built my life on. I am very proud
of this University."


They come every year, some out of
curiosity, some to renew old
friendships. Wearing the obligatory
cardinal and marching off to perhaps
their first football game in decades,
most come from within California, al
though there are always some who
venture from the East, and even one
or two from Europe.
They've been out five, 10, or as
many as 50 years, yet they keep com
ing back, somewhat like the swallows
to Capistrano, but more on the order
of students returning after summer
vacation — with a mixture of eager
ness, excitment and apprehension.
Call it school pride, or even self pride,
Alumni Weekend — this year the
first weekend in November— will al
ways find curious graduates returning
to the Farm.
"I'm a nerd, not a joiner," said
Patric Sherman, '49, who returned to
campus from Kansas City for this
year's Alumni Weekend. It was Sher
man's first time back to Stanford
since he graduated. "This is a sen
timental journey."
"Stanford is a unique part of my
life, much more than a school," said
Ron Allen, '54. "It's a part of your
past that continues to grow on you.
It's good to be back."
Every year, approximately 1,500
Stanford alumni return to campus for
the Stanford Alumni Weekend.
Scheduled to coincide with the home
football game against USC or UCLA,
the reunions are perhaps the most
traditional and well-known way in
which the University maintains con
tact with its graduates.
"Part of the fun is coming back to

campus and going to the football
games," according to Karen Porter,
associate director of ciubs, reunions
and student services for the Alumni
Association. But she adds that
reminiscing with friends is only part
of the day's overall scheme, and only
one of the reasons for bringing an
alumus back every five years.
Before the Saturday tailgaters
begin, the alumni are busy getting
reacquainted with the campus and its
facilities. Starting with a tour of Bow
man Alumni House and running
through meetings, receptions with
University President Donald Ken
nedy and representatives from the
development office as well as intellec
tual discussions on topics ranging
from the nature of poems to the na
ture of the budget deficit, the day is
nothing short of a crash course on
Stanford life today.
"A great school has to change,"
said Sherman. "It has to move, to
grow or else it's dead. It's good to see
— the life."
'there's a sort of nostalgia to sit
ting in a class," said Nancy Longley
Aptus, '49, "especially knowing there
are no exams."
While it is perhaps the largest on
campus activity for alumni, the
reunion weekend is by no means the
only tie between graduates and the
University. The Alumni Association
is just as content to take a little bit of
Stanford to individual'cities as it is to
have alumni come back to the Farm.
Ever since the first graduating class
in the 1890s, alumni have met in in
formal groups in their home towns,
according to Carolyn Manning,
Alumni Association director of clubs.

reunions and student services. And
more than 100 clubs throughout the
world have grown out of those small,
spontaneous beginnings.
Most students become acquainted
with the clubs at area parties thrown
for them before their freshman year
— but the groups fill many other
needs. The clubs may organize social
and political forums or holiday par
ties. Perhaps the most important
function of these groups is to help
alumni to keep in touch with the Uni

versity.
"They're like an umbilical cord to
the University," said Sally Haughn
Boehn, '74, who, although active in
her club in San Diego, made her first
return visit to campus for her 10th
renuion on Nov. 3.
Most clubs host monthly speakers
— often Stanford professors — and
some, especially the "juniors," who
have been out for fewer than 10 years,
organize social get-togethers like
theater nights or cooking classes.

A few even do spectacular things.
The Seattle-area club, for instance,
initiated what they called SASSY —
Scholarship Auction for Stanford
Students and You. By soliciting ordi
nary items — donated dinners — and
the unusual — an orig
inal, signed Wallace Stegner
poem — they were able to raise more
than $10,000 for the University
scholarship fund.
In Washington, D.C., and New
York, the clubs have arranged for Big

Game to be broadcast over local
radio stations. All of these activities,
though, are conducted by volunteers
and are designed to serve alumni at
home.
"There's a personal contact, a one
on-one in the hometown," Manning
said. For those who can't get back to

while "99 percent of the articles are
Stanford related," Fife feels that the
magazine's most vital section — "the
backbone" — is the class notes.
"Our goal is to get as many names
in the pages in the book," she said.
"The more names, the more people
get involved. If we published nothing
else we would publish them."
"I love mv magazine and my Ob
server," Sherman said. "I think the
Observer is the best thing I've ever
seen."
Between the quarterly magazine,
the Observer, which is published
seven times annually, and the other
Alumni Association mailings, Stone
has estimated that more than four
million pieces of mail are sent each
year to approximately 130,000
alumni. That's an average of more
than 30 pieces of mail per person.
In addition to deluging graduates
with mailings throughout the year,
the association tries to give students
a preview of alumni life throughout
their student years. The alumni con
tact service, for instance, make«
available names of Stanford business

people in cities all across the country
who are willing to help students find
internships and jobs.
In addition, the association coor
dinates numerous opportunities for
social interaction, including senior
brunches, junior study breaks and a
freshman "home-away-from-home"
program, all of which give students an
opportunity to spend time with
alumni.
"We try to acquaint people with
the opportunities and responsibilities
of being alums before they leave,"
Stone said.
Yet for many, participating in most
of the alumni activities still poses a
difficulty.
"I feel I owe a great many things to
the University," said Jim Gordon,
'54. "Because I can't give my time, I
give generously of my money. But if
the University called on me, I would
be there to help."
In fact, even though it is not di
rectly related to Alumni Association
activities, the success of fund raising
has rivaled that of much of the pro
gramming.
Last year, for instance, alumni con
tributions to the annual fund, which
disperses its money to all parts of the
University, totaled $11.8 million, up
from $10 million the previous year.
And not included in that figure is a
$20 million gift/pledge from David
Packard for a new children's hospital.
"Very large gifts are not an
everyday thing," said David Fulton,
director of development communica
tions. "They have always been a big
event for us."
Another source of donations are
the Buck and Cardinal clubs. Each

solicits money to be used for Stanford
athletic scholarships. The Buck Club,
which gives money to aid male ath
letes in all varsity sports, last year
raised $2.1 million.
Its counterpart, the Cardinal Club,
raised an additional $700,000 for
female athletes through mail, phone
and personal solicitations. Of that,
$235,000 was raised from a single
auction. Each group is the most suc
cessful of its kind in the country, ac
cording to the clubs' directors.
"We have an incredible group of
alums," said Donna Garton, associate
director of development for athletics,
physical education and recreation.
"They are a creative, strong,
stimulating group that loves to be
helping students."
Along with groups like the Mot
hers' Club, which holds its annual
Chrysanthemum-Champagne party
and raised $1 1,500 of scholarship
money as well as providing numerous
other services for both Stanford par
ents and students, the development
side of alumni involvement seems to
be keeping up with the programming.
"There's a real loyalty to this
campus that's hard to pin-point," said
Joan Rutter, president of the Mot
hers' Club." People just get hooked."
But to the alumni who come back
every five years for their reunion and
are continuously involved in all facets
of the University — hooked — some
how doesn't seem to be strong enough.
It's more a case of never having let go.
"My Stanford years are some of the
greatest in my entire life," Gordon
said. "It's the very foundation of what
I've built my life on. I am very proud
of this University."


They come every year, some out of
curiosity, some to renew old
friendships. Wearing the obligatory
cardinal and marching off to perhaps
their first football game in decades,
most come from within California, al
though there are always some who
venture from the East, and even one
or two from Europe.
They've been out five, 10, or as
many as 50 years, yet they keep com
ing back, somewhat like the swallows
to Capistrano, but more on the order
of students returning after summer
vacation — with a mixture of eager
ness, excitment and apprehension.
Call it school pride, or even self pride,
Alumni Weekend — this year the
first weekend in November— will al
ways find curious graduates returning
to the Farm.
"I'm a nerd, not a joiner," said
Patric Sherman, '49, who returned to
campus from Kansas City for this
year's Alumni Weekend. It was Sher
man's first time back to Stanford
since he graduated. "This is a sen
timental journey."
"Stanford is a unique part of my
life, much more than a school," said
Ron Allen, '54. "It's a part of your
past that continues to grow on you.
It's good to be back."
Every year, approximately 1,500
Stanford alumni return to campus for
the Stanford Alumni Weekend.
Scheduled to coincide with the home
football game against USC or UCLA,
the reunions are perhaps the most
traditional and well-known way in
which the University maintains con
tact with its graduates.
"Part of the fun is coming back to

campus and going to the football
games," according to Karen Porter,
associate director of ciubs, reunions
and student services for the Alumni
Association. But she adds that
reminiscing with friends is only part
of the day's overall scheme, and only
one of the reasons for bringing an
alumus back every five years.
Before the Saturday tailgaters
begin, the alumni are busy getting
reacquainted with the campus and its
facilities. Starting with a tour of Bow
man Alumni House and running
through meetings, receptions with
University President Donald Ken
nedy and representatives from the
development office as well as intellec
tual discussions on topics ranging
from the nature of poems to the na
ture of the budget deficit, the day is
nothing short of a crash course on
Stanford life today.
"A great school has to change,"
said Sherman. "It has to move, to
grow or else it's dead. It's good to see
— the life."
'there's a sort of nostalgia to sit
ting in a class," said Nancy Longley
Aptus, '49, "especially knowing there
are no exams."
While it is perhaps the largest on
campus activity for alumni, the
reunion weekend is by no means the
only tie between graduates and the
University. The Alumni Association
is just as content to take a little bit of
Stanford to individual'cities as it is to
have alumni come back to the Farm.
Ever since the first graduating class
in the 1890s, alumni have met in in
formal groups in their home towns,
according to Carolyn Manning,
Alumni Association director of clubs.

reunions and student services. And
more than 100 clubs throughout the
world have grown out of those small,
spontaneous beginnings.
Most students become acquainted
with the clubs at area parties thrown
for them before their freshman year
— but the groups fill many other
needs. The clubs may organize social
and political forums or holiday par
ties. Perhaps the most important
function of these groups is to help
alumni to keep in touch with the Uni

versity.
"They're like an umbilical cord to
the University," said Sally Haughn
Boehn, '74, who, although active in
her club in San Diego, made her first
return visit to campus for her 10th
renuion on Nov. 3.
Most clubs host monthly speakers
— often Stanford professors — and
some, especially the "juniors," who
have been out for fewer than 10 years,
organize social get-togethers like
theater nights or cooking classes.

A few even do spectacular things.
The Seattle-area club, for instance,
initiated what they called SASSY —
Scholarship Auction for Stanford
Students and You. By soliciting ordi
nary items — donated dinners — and
the unusual — an orig
inal, signed Wallace Stegner
poem — they were able to raise more
than $10,000 for the University
scholarship fund.
In Washington, D.C., and New
York, the clubs have arranged for Big

Game to be broadcast over local
radio stations. All of these activities,
though, are conducted by volunteers
and are designed to serve alumni at
home.
"There's a personal contact, a one
on-one in the hometown," Manning
said. For those who can't get back to
campus, being active in the clubs "is a
nice way to give something back" to
the University, she said.
On occasion, however, the Alumni
Association does take its show on the
road in order to reach an even bigger
audience in an even grander way.
One of the largest-scale examples of
this is last year's Stanford in New
York Conference, titled "Life in the
21st Century."
While its underlying intent, like so
many Alumni Association programs,
was educational, the conference was
also an effort to coalesce individual
alumni on the other side of the
country.
"We wanted to do something big
— grab the attention of people in the
East [and let them know] that Stan
ford was there," Manning said. "We
roused expectation" of the Univer
sity's role in the area, she added.
The three-day conference, which
was lead by 27 faculty members who
were flown out to lead the program,
was aimed at the more than 7,000
alumni in the New York City area.
Billed as "not only the most am
bitious but also the most successful
Stanford undertaking afield in the in
stitution's history," the conference
has led to plans for a similar venture
in Paris in the fall of 1986 as well as
the opening of a permanent branch of
the development office in New York.

But whether they are raising
money f« r students at a club auction
or catching up on class gossip at the
reunion, the one thing that all alumni
can be assured of getting is at least a
small dose of education.
"A lot of the point in coming back
is (for alumni) to see each other,"
said Alumni Association Director
William Stone. "If all we did were
cocktail parties and football games, it
would miss the point of trying to show
off what an exciting place this is. We
take an interest in athletics and nos
talgia, but 1 like to make sure people
get a dose of something challenging."
For many, the intellectual chal
lenge is provided by Stanford's exten
sive continuing education programs.
Running the gamut from seminars on
"A Practical Guide to the Income
Tax" to the perennially popular
Great Authors Lecture Series, the
association runs 25 programs each
year, both on campus and in such ex
otic places as the Stanford Sierra
Camp, Fallen Leaf Lake, and even
one — the Summer Symposia on Re
naissance Florence — on the Stanford
campus in Italy.
Although some programs, like the
intensive, two-week executive educa
tion program, are strongly vocation
related, the purpose of continuing
education is not merely to supple
ment on-the-job training, according
to Marion Player, director of the con
tinuing education program.
"It's a chance to not so much con
tinue education but to get back in
touch with the intellectual self," she
said. "People want something more
than what they get from their 40- to
50-hour work week."

Toward that end, Player and her
co-workers are about to launch a new
project that, like the clubs, will serve
alumni who are unable to take advan
tage of the on-campus programs.
Called the "Audible Stanford," the
program consists of a series of cas
settes, each with one of more than 80
taped lectures of Stanford professors
in all fields: politics, environmental
issues, engineering, art and literature.
"This institution is a tremendous
educational resource," Player said.

"Our first goal is to get as many
people involved in continuing educa
tion as possible."
Yet, while the success of pilot pro
grams like the Audible Stanford lies,
to a large degree, in planning and
marketing, the very structure of the
Alumni Association and its philoso
phy do much to secure constant
alumni involvement in the University.
"We hit people where they live,
cater to different needs," said Stone.
The clubs, for instance, are de

signed to attract the younger
graduate who is unable to come back
to school while the reunions contact
people every five years.
Perhaps the most successful
method ot informing alumni of Uni
versity is through mailings, especially
the Stanford Magazine and the Stan
ford Observer.
"For those alums who don't live in
tHe immediate area, we could be the
only link" to the University, accord
ing to Debby Fife, editor and
manager of the magazine. And,
while "99 percent of the articles are
Stanford related," Fife feels that the
magazine's most vital section — "the
backbone" — is the class notes.
"Our goal is to get as many names
in the pages in the book," she said.
"The more names, the more people
get involved. If we published nothing
else we would publish them."
"I love mv magazine and my Ob
server," Sherman said. "I think the
Observer is the best thing I've ever
seen."
Between the quarterly magazine,
the Observer, which is published
seven times annually, and the other
Alumni Association mailings, Stone
has estimated that more than four
million pieces of mail are sent each
year to approximately 130,000
alumni. That's an average of more
than 30 pieces of mail per person.
In addition to deluging graduates
with mailings throughout the year,
the association tries to give students
a preview of alumni life throughout
their student years. The alumni con

many as 50 years, yet they keep com
ing back, somewhat like the swallows
to Capistrano, but more on the order
of students returning after summer
vacation — with a mixture of eager
ness, excitment and apprehension.
Call it school pride, or even self pride,
Alumni Weekend — this year the
first weekend in November— will al
ways find curious graduates returning
to the Farm.
"I'm a nerd, not a joiner," said
Patric Sherman, '49, who returned to
campus from Kansas City for this
year's Alumni Weekend. It was Sher
man's first time back to Stanford
since he graduated. "This is a sen
timental journey."
"Stanford is a unique part of my
life, much more than a school," said
Ron Allen, '54. "It's a part of your
past that continues to grow on you.
It's good to be back."
Every year, approximately 1,500
Stanford alumni return to campus for
the Stanford Alumni Weekend.
Scheduled to coincide with the home
football game against USC or UCLA,
the reunions are perhaps the most
traditional and well-known way in
which the University maintains con
tact with its graduates.
"Part of the fun is coming back to

campus and going to the football
games," according to Karen Porter,
associate director of ciubs, reunions
and student services for the Alumni
Association. But she adds that
reminiscing with friends is only part
of the day's overall scheme, and only
one of the reasons for bringing an
alumus back every five years.
Before the Saturday tailgaters
begin, the alumni are busy getting
reacquainted with the campus and its
facilities. Starting with a tour of Bow
man Alumni House and running
through meetings, receptions with
University President Donald Ken
nedy and representatives from the
development office as well as intellec
tual discussions on topics ranging
from the nature of poems to the na
ture of the budget deficit, the day is
nothing short of a crash course on
Stanford life today.
"A great school has to change,"
said Sherman. "It has to move, to
grow or else it's dead. It's good to see
— the life."
'there's a sort of nostalgia to sit
ting in a class," said Nancy Longley
Aptus, '49, "especially knowing there
are no exams."
While it is perhaps the largest on
campus activity for alumni, the
reunion weekend is by no means the
only tie between graduates and the
University. The Alumni Association
is just as content to take a little bit of
Stanford to individual'cities as it is to
have alumni come back to the Farm.
Ever since the first graduating class
in the 1890s, alumni have met in in
formal groups in their home towns,
according to Carolyn Manning,
Alumni Association director of clubs.

reunions and student services. And
more than 100 clubs throughout the
world have grown out of those small,
spontaneous beginnings.
Most students become acquainted
with the clubs at area parties thrown
for them before their freshman year
— but the groups fill many other
needs. The clubs may organize social
and political forums or holiday par
ties. Perhaps the most important
function of these groups is to help
alumni to keep in touch with the Uni

versity.
"They're like an umbilical cord to
the University," said Sally Haughn
Boehn, '74, who, although active in
her club in San Diego, made her first
return visit to campus for her 10th
renuion on Nov. 3.
Most clubs host monthly speakers
— often Stanford professors — and
some, especially the "juniors," who
have been out for fewer than 10 years,
organize social get-togethers like
theater nights or cooking classes.

A few even do spectacular things.
The Seattle-area club, for instance,
initiated what they called SASSY —
Scholarship Auction for Stanford
Students and You. By soliciting ordi
nary items — donated dinners — and
the unusual — an orig
inal, signed Wallace Stegner
poem — they were able to raise more
than $10,000 for the University
scholarship fund.
In Washington, D.C., and New
York, the clubs have arranged for Big

Game to be broadcast over local
radio stations. All of these activities,
though, are conducted by volunteers
and are designed to serve alumni at
home.
"There's a personal contact, a one
on-one in the hometown," Manning
said. For those who can't get back to
campus, being active in the clubs "is a
nice way to give something back" to
the University, she said.
On occasion, however, the Alumni
Association does take its show on the
road in order to reach an even bigger
audience in an even grander way.
One of the largest-scale examples of
this is last year's Stanford in New
York Conference, titled "Life in the
21st Century."
While its underlying intent, like so
many Alumni Association programs,
was educational, the conference was
also an effort to coalesce individual
alumni on the other side of the
country.
"We wanted to do something big
— grab the attention of people in the
East [and let them know] that Stan
ford was there," Manning said. "We
roused expectation" of the Univer
sity's role in the area, she added.
The three-day conference, which
was lead by 27 faculty members who
were flown out to lead the program,
was aimed at the more than 7,000
alumni in the New York City area.
Billed as "not only the most am
bitious but also the most successful
Stanford undertaking afield in the in
stitution's history," the conference
has led to plans for a similar venture
in Paris in the fall of 1986 as well as
the opening of a permanent branch of
the development office in New York.

But whether they are raising
money f« r students at a club auction
or catching up on class gossip at the
reunion, the one thing that all alumni
can be assured of getting is at least a
small dose of education.
"A lot of the point in coming back
is (for alumni) to see each other,"
said Alumni Association Director
William Stone. "If all we did were
cocktail parties and football games, it
would miss the point of trying to show
off what an exciting place this is. We
take an interest in athletics and nos
talgia, but 1 like to make sure people
get a dose of something challenging."
For many, the intellectual chal
lenge is provided by Stanford's exten
sive continuing education programs.
Running the gamut from seminars on
"A Practical Guide to the Income
Tax" to the perennially popular
Great Authors Lecture Series, the
association runs 25 programs each
year, both on campus and in such ex
otic places as the Stanford Sierra
Camp, Fallen Leaf Lake, and even
one — the Summer Symposia on Re
naissance Florence — on the Stanford
campus in Italy.
Although some programs, like the
intensive, two-week executive educa
tion program, are strongly vocation
related, the purpose of continuing
education is not merely to supple
ment on-the-job training, according
to Marion Player, director of the con
tinuing education program.
"It's a chance to not so much con
tinue education but to get back in
touch with the intellectual self," she
said. "People want something more
than what they get from their 40- to
50-hour work week."

Toward that end, Player and her
co-workers are about to launch a new
project that, like the clubs, will serve
alumni who are unable to take advan
tage of the on-campus programs.
Called the "Audible Stanford," the
program consists of a series of cas
settes, each with one of more than 80
taped lectures of Stanford professors
in all fields: politics, environmental
issues, engineering, art and literature.
"This institution is a tremendous
educational resource," Player said.

"Our first goal is to get as many
people involved in continuing educa
tion as possible."
Yet, while the success of pilot pro
grams like the Audible Stanford lies,
to a large degree, in planning and
marketing, the very structure of the
Alumni Association and its philoso
phy do much to secure constant
alumni involvement in the University.
"We hit people where they live,
cater to different needs," said Stone.
The clubs, for instance, are de

signed to attract the younger
graduate who is unable to come back
to school while the reunions contact
people every five years.
Perhaps the most successful
method ot informing alumni of Uni
versity is through mailings, especially
the Stanford Magazine and the Stan
ford Observer.
"For those alums who don't live in
tHe immediate area, we could be the
only link" to the University, accord
ing to Debby Fife, editor and
manager of the magazine. And,
while "99 percent of the articles are
Stanford related," Fife feels that the
magazine's most vital section — "the
backbone" — is the class notes.
"Our goal is to get as many names
in the pages in the book," she said.
"The more names, the more people
get involved. If we published nothing
else we would publish them."
"I love mv magazine and my Ob
server," Sherman said. "I think the
Observer is the best thing I've ever
seen."
Between the quarterly magazine,
the Observer, which is published
seven times annually, and the other
Alumni Association mailings, Stone
has estimated that more than four
million pieces of mail are sent each
year to approximately 130,000
alumni. That's an average of more
than 30 pieces of mail per person.
In addition to deluging graduates
with mailings throughout the year,
the association tries to give students
a preview of alumni life throughout
their student years. The alumni con
tact service, for instance, make«
available names of Stanford business

people in cities all across the country
who are willing to help students find
internships and jobs.
In addition, the association coor
dinates numerous opportunities for
social interaction, including senior
brunches, junior study breaks and a
freshman "home-away-from-home"
program, all of which give students an
opportunity to spend time with
alumni.
"We try to acquaint people with
the opportunities and responsibilities
of being alums before they leave,"
Stone said.
Yet for many, participating in most
of the alumni activities still poses a
difficulty.
"I feel I owe a great many things to
the University," said Jim Gordon,
'54. "Because I can't give my time, I
give generously of my money. But if
the University called on me, I would
be there to help."
In fact, even though it is not di
rectly related to Alumni Association
activities, the success of fund raising
has rivaled that of much of the pro
gramming.
Last year, for instance, alumni con
tributions to the annual fund, which
disperses its money to all parts of the
University, totaled $11.8 million, up
from $10 million the previous year.
And not included in that figure is a
$20 million gift/pledge from David
Packard for a new children's hospital.
"Very large gifts are not an
everyday thing," said David Fulton,
director of development communica
tions. "They have always been a big
event for us."
Another source of donations are
the Buck and Cardinal clubs. Each

solicits money to be used for Stanford
athletic scholarships. The Buck Club,
which gives money to aid male ath
letes in all varsity sports, last year
raised $2.1 million.
Its counterpart, the Cardinal Club,
raised an additional $700,000 for
female athletes through mail, phone
and personal solicitations. Of that,
$235,000 was raised from a single
auction. Each group is the most suc
cessful of its kind in the country, ac
cording to the clubs' directors.
"We have an incredible group of
alums," said Donna Garton, associate
director of development for athletics,
physical education and recreation.
"They are a creative, strong,
stimulating group that loves to be
helping students."
Along with groups like the Mot
hers' Club, which holds its annual
Chrysanthemum-Champagne party
and raised $1 1,500 of scholarship
money as well as providing numerous
other services for both Stanford par
ents and students, the development
side of alumni involvement seems to
be keeping up with the programming.
"There's a real loyalty to this
campus that's hard to pin-point," said
Joan Rutter, president of the Mot
hers' Club." People just get hooked."
But to the alumni who come back
every five years for their reunion and
are continuously involved in all facets
of the University — hooked — some
how doesn't seem to be strong enough.
It's more a case of never having let go.
"My Stanford years are some of the
greatest in my entire life," Gordon
said. "It's the very foundation of what
I've built my life on. I am very proud
of this University."
