## Amnesty Int'l presents banned films Polish film 'lost' in transit between Paris and S.F. 
### AMY FRIEDMAN 
The films are controversial either
in subject matter or artistic style. ac
cording to national film hoard stand
ards. They have been banned in the
countries where they were made.
They represent works of leading
filmmakers from the Soviet Union,
Poland, Czechoslovakia, Spain.
Brazil, Chile and even the United
States. They tell different stories in
different styles; they are direct, they
are subtle, moving and important .
yet they are rarely seen.
Amnesty International has brought
together eight such films in the Fes
tival of Forbidden Film, playing at the
Fox Theatre in Redwood City tomor
row through Sunday.
Amnesty International is a
"worldwide human-rights organiza
tion that seeks to safeguard basic
human rights" mostly through legal
aid, letter writing and other non
violent measures. Richard Strickland,
the director of the festival, explains
that the festival will feature films that
"highlight links between censorship
and abuse of human rights." The
focus will be on more recent works
than the "Banned Films" exhibited at
the 1983 Filmex in Los Angeles.
However. Strickland had a hard
time securing the films he wanted to
show. The movies existed but were
off limits except to the government
controlled film boards. Although a

country may keep tight guard on the
cinema, a potentially subversive
script may slip through the various
levels of bureaucracy.
Eastern Bloc filmmakers have in
corporated in their craft the
"tradition of getting things past the
censors," Strickland discovered. It is
not until the rough or even final cut of
the movie that the authorities realize
what the films are really about. In
stead of shelving the works at that
point, in a charade of fairness, the
government proclaims that the
movies are uncommercial after a very
limited release and "cans" the films.
Once out of circulation, it is virtually
impossible to get to the films. There
are pirated cassettes, but these are of
ten of poor quality.
This pattern had been common in
Poland until martial law closed up the
loopholes. The recent uprising in
Poland presented a case to Strickland
with which to compare the cinematic
status of other countries. Polish
cinema was flowering, "coming of
age" in the 19705. Some people felt
that the relative freedom of the
cinema may have been the vanguard
of Solidarity.
The Poles are apparently avid
movie-goers. The Solidarity labor
movement created a 16-month per
iod of "moral opportunity." Polish
filmmakers had been "chomping at
the bit" until then and took full ad

vantage of the freedom, Strickland
said.
Andrzej Wajda, Agnieszka Hol
land. Krzysztof Zanussi and
Krzysztof Kieslowski — regarded as
Poland's top filmmakers — all
produced widely acclaimed pictures
that received much attention in the
European festival circuit . . . until the
curtain came down on Dec. 13, 1981,
when martial law was instituted.
As a continuing show of solidarity,
the Poles, who normally flock to the
movie houses, stay at home each Dec.
13.
A few weeks before the martial law
was imposed, "Fever" by Agnies/ka
Holland won top honors in the 1981
Gdansk Film Festival. That same
year, the movie was likely to have
been the recipient of the Golden Bear
Award in Berlin.
Film Polski. however, the only lilni
exporter in Poland, yanked the film
out of circulation on government or
ders. Holland managed to smuggle
out one 16mm print of her film and
was to have its North American
premiere showing opening night of
the Festival of Forbidden Film.
But the film was lost in transit from
Paris to San Francisco at the begin
ning of this week. The Polish director
in exile indicated through her inter
preters that foul play, complete with


Chilean film "Jackal of Narhueltoro", directed by Miguel Litten in 1969, plays Sunday at 4:30 p.m.
"James Bondian" twists, may have
been involved.
In the meantime, Amnesty Inter
national has been frantically arrang
ing to have another print made from
the negative in France, where Hol
land now resides, and Strickland is
confident the film will be here in time
for the 8 p.m. screening tomorrow.
Adapted from Andrzej Strug's
novel, "The Story of a Bomb,'''
"Fever" tells the story of a group of

anarchists set in Poland in the year
1905. Holland is particularly con
cerned about the fate of Polish his
tory. "History is like an . .. invest
ment . . . like a treasury of all your
symbols," she said.
Holland's theory is that
"totalitarian ideology is afraid of his
tory" and is therefore "erasing" the
truth about whole eras, and replacing
it with falsehoods.
The system compelled the director
to make "political" films although
that had not been her original intent.
When she was young she "rebelled"
against the fact that as an artist she
had also to deal with politics: "I

thought they (art and politics) were
separate," she remembered. But as
she grew up she realized that politics
were everywhere. "Wherever 1
turned, I saw politics . . . you couldn't
wear socks in the way you wanted . . .
you couldn't listen to jazz." The gov
ernment regulated all levels of life. In
the end, Holland understood that be
cause she wanted to make films about
people, her people, she would have to
combine art and politics, because the
two were indeed very connected.
Holland explained that depending
on the tone of the government, the
cinema "shrinks and stretches" in
spasms. She was lucky to have been

working in a period of stretched
leniency. She enjoyed the relative
freedom and period of innovation
that marked the New Wave in Polish
cinema in the 19705. The prolific per
iod paralleled the renaissance of
Czechoslovakian cinema in the '60s.
But Holland asserted that the
Polish filmmakers were more politi
cally aware because they witnessed
the 1968 crackdown in Czecho
slovakia. She felt that the filmmakers
of the time wanted to make movies
that would "tell about (the) society"
as it was. Andrzej Wajda proved to
be a real leader, a "locomotive" in
Polish cinema.

Currently both Wajda and Holland
are working in Europe. The two have
collaborated on a number of films —
"The Man of Marble," "Danton,"
"A Love in Germany." Holland
recently finished "Bittere Ernte" in
Germany.
Holland describes the film industry
here as "the best in the world"
technically, and as a craft. But she
found the content wanting and
"monotonous".
She felt that the French cinema was
interior to the American cinema be
cause it was becoming commercial
too fast, at the expense of quality
ideas and without even the technical
superiority evident in American
tilms. She admired the work of John
Cassavetes and the early works of
Milos Forman. Now, however, Amer
ican film is characterized by a "lot of
brutality and blood," she said.
"Fever" is the highlight of the fes
tival, though the other films are as
strong in putting forth issues and
viewpoints from other countries
where films are regulated and, on oc
casion, suppressed.
Irony sets the tone of "Black
Brood" ("Camada Negra") as it
depicts the brutality of a group of
right-wing fanatics. "Rage can be
holy," Blanca (Maria Luisa Ponte)
lectures to the motley rightist group
she presides over in the film. This
movie, directed by Manuel
Gutierrez-Aragon and co-written by
Jose Luis Borau, was released and
banned just 18 months after Franco's
death in Spain, where the film was
made. It screens Saturday at 7 p.m.
Jose Luis Borau will also be there in
person.
The movie starts off quickly as the
right-wing group ransacks a
bookshop-gallery and spray-paints
anti-communist slogans in red
throughout the shop. In striking con
trast, the next scene fills the theater
with angelic choir music as the same
men rehearse as a choral group. The
film tells the story of 15-year-old
Tatin (Jose Luis Alonso): of his naive
desire to belong to the group, of his
prejudiced understanding of
nationalism and loyalty and of his in
nocence and doom.
He blindly sets out to fulfill the
three terms of the group doctrine that
Blanca, his mother, extolls: secrecy,
revenge and sacrifice. Tatin meets

Rosa (Angela Molina) after he is in
terrupted while raping the bookshop
gallery manager in the restaurant
bathroom where Rosa waitresses.
This is his first effort of revenge. Rosa
laughs inexplicably, captivating
Tatin's curiosity as he flees. He fol
lows her to her home in the poorer
outskirts of Madrid. She scoops up
her little son, Rafita, who has been
playing with the kids in the street.
Tatin hangs back as he watches Rosa
disappear into her apartment.
A marvelous sequence follows.
Tatin plays street soccer with the
other kids his age. Hesitantly he
knocks at Rosa's door. He wants his
knife back, the one she picked up in
the bathroom. Until he has it in his
fist he tags after her like a puppy;
once the weapon is in his hand he
turns on her with macho confidence.
Complications arise for Tatin be
cause of the struggle for power be
tween his eldest half-brother and mo
ther. Tatin's allegiance is swayed
toward the brother when he lets Tatin
into his confidence. Blanca is also
very strict with her youngest son. Per
haps her harshness stems from a
resentment of Tatin, who is the son of
her second husband, whom she
despises and treats like a fool. He is,
in fact, a dirty old man and is the one
element of the story that seems un
necessary and forced.
The direction of the film is tight; it
moves quickly. There is a lot going on
at different levels of the film,
Guitierrez-Aragon commands excel
lent performances from all the actors,
who seem to react rather than to act
in the context of the events that carry
them through a series of senseless
atrocities. The writers capture a
glimpse of the panic of one brother,
defiance of another, and pushy deter
mination of the mother in a scene, so
simple and so perfect. The two sons
flank their mother on her bed as they
look out the window. With their
backs to the camera they discuss the
practicality of performing at the fu
neral of a waiter the group had killed
in a restaurant shootout. The mother
succeeds in calming the younger son,
and the other son succeeds in affirm
ing his position by holding his ground
against his mother's wishes. The hor
rible denouement of the film is

heightened by the final shot of the
group singing from the heart, with
Tatin a full-fledged member of the
black brood.
A more difficult film, "The Color
of Pomegranates" again attests to the
quality of the works in the Festival.
Director Sergei Paradjanov defies the
standards of Soviet film in subject
and style. The film captures images of
the life of the 18th-century Armenian
poet known as Sayat Nova (King of
Song). The film is a gothic painting
come to life. The figures are stiff and
flat. The episodes unfold against the
backdrop of the church. The director
winds the story through the eyes of
the poet first as a curious young boy
and later as scholar cleric.
The tempo is measured with care in
a timeless fairy-tale reality. Excerpts
from the poet's works highlight the
oppression we are meant to feel as
death is the only liberation in a world
of stifled freedom. "Ever more grief,
my grief increases. .."
The power of the film is not
realized until after the film is over,
after you have gone home and the
images keep haunting and reminding
you — the colors, the magnified
sound of water dripping, the ethereal
costumes, recurring shapes, the veils
of lace, the peacocks, the mysterious
rituals.
The Soviet government did not ap
prove of the film or the director, and
arrested him for a number of
trumped-up charges. Outraged,
friends and filmmakers abroad ap

pealed for clemency. Many feel the
appeal sped up Paradjanov's release
from a work camp. But he was again
arrested in a clear case of entrap
ment. Again, friends rallied to his
support, writing letters and sending
delegations.
Finally, in 1982, he was released.
Once more, after 16 years, the direc

tor is working on another film," I lie
Fortress of Surami."
The story of Paradjanov illustrates
the effectiveness of writing letters.
Bill Hicks of the Stanford chapter of
Amnesty International points out
that the Festival of Forbidden Film
celebrates the filmmakers who in
some cases suffered persecution in

order to tell the tale of others who
have suffered. The quality of the se
lections should appeal to serious film
bulls, the content to human-rights ac
tivists. and the opportunity to be a
part of the festival to all. The Fox
I hcutre lias been renovated, and the
lush movie palace is a worthy
showplace for this special event.


Soviet film "Andrei Rublev" plays Sunday at 1 p.m., directed by Andrei Tarkovsky in 1966.
