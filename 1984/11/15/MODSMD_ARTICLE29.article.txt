## Amnesty Int'l presents banned films Polish film 'lost' in transit between Paris and S.F. 
### AMY FRIEDMAN 
The films are controversial either
in subject matter or artistic style. ac
cording to national film hoard stand
ards. They have been banned in the
countries where they were made.
They represent works of leading
filmmakers from the Soviet Union,
Poland, Czechoslovakia, Spain.
Brazil, Chile and even the United
States. They tell different stories in
different styles; they are direct, they
are subtle, moving and important .
yet they are rarely seen.
Amnesty International has brought
together eight such films in the Fes
tival of Forbidden Film, playing at the
Fox Theatre in Redwood City tomor
row through Sunday.
Amnesty International is a
"worldwide human-rights organiza
tion that seeks to safeguard basic
human rights" mostly through legal
aid, letter writing and other non
violent measures. Richard Strickland,
the director of the festival, explains
that the festival will feature films that
"highlight links between censorship
and abuse of human rights." The
focus will be on more recent works
than the "Banned Films" exhibited at
the 1983 Filmex in Los Angeles.
However. Strickland had a hard
time securing the films he wanted to
show. The movies existed but were
off limits except to the government
controlled film boards. Although a

country may keep tight guard on the
cinema, a potentially subversive
script may slip through the various
levels of bureaucracy.
Eastern Bloc filmmakers have in
corporated in their craft the
"tradition of getting things past the
censors," Strickland discovered. It is
not until the rough or even final cut of
the movie that the authorities realize
what the films are really about. In
stead of shelving the works at that
point, in a charade of fairness, the
government proclaims that the
movies are uncommercial after a very
limited release and "cans" the films.
Once out of circulation, it is virtually
impossible to get to the films. There
are pirated cassettes, but these are of
ten of poor quality.
This pattern had been common in
Poland until martial law closed up the
loopholes. The recent uprising in
Poland presented a case to Strickland
with which to compare the cinematic
status of other countries. Polish
cinema was flowering, "coming of
age" in the 19705. Some people felt
that the relative freedom of the
cinema may have been the vanguard
of Solidarity.
The Poles are apparently avid
movie-goers. The Solidarity labor
movement created a 16-month per
iod of "moral opportunity." Polish
filmmakers had been "chomping at
the bit" until then and took full ad

vantage of the freedom, Strickland
said.
Andrzej Wajda, Agnieszka Hol
land. Krzysztof Zanussi and
Krzysztof Kieslowski — regarded as
Poland's top filmmakers — all
produced widely acclaimed pictures
that received much attention in the
European festival circuit . . . until the
curtain came down on Dec. 13, 1981,
when martial law was instituted.
As a continuing show of solidarity,
the Poles, who normally flock to the
movie houses, stay at home each Dec.
13.
A few weeks before the martial law
was imposed, "Fever" by Agnies/ka
Holland won top honors in the 1981
Gdansk Film Festival. That same
year, the movie was likely to have
been the recipient of the Golden Bear
Award in Berlin.
Film Polski. however, the only lilni
exporter in Poland, yanked the film
out of circulation on government or
ders. Holland managed to smuggle
out one 16mm print of her film and
was to have its North American
premiere showing opening night of
the Festival of Forbidden Film.
But the film was lost in transit from
Paris to San Francisco at the begin
ning of this week. The Polish director
in exile indicated through her inter
preters that foul play, complete with


Chilean film "Jackal of Narhueltoro", directed by Miguel Litten in 1969, plays Sunday at 4:30 p.m.
