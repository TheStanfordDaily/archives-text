# Council approves Reagan library sites
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
Plans for the location of the Ronald
Reagan Presidential Library cleared an
other hurdle yesterday when the Univer
sity's Administrative Council approved
three sites recommended by the library
planning committee.
Phil Williams, University planning
director, called the move "a significant
step" in the continuing search tor the li
brary's location. The plan will now go
before the board of trustees in December,
with that body making final considerations
to be forwarded to the White House.
According to Williams, the most
likely" site to be selected by the White
House is an area close to the Center tor

Advanced Study in the Behavioral
Sciences, west of Junipero Serra Boulevard
near Lake Lagunita.
He said that location is "closer to the
rest of campus" and the relationship with
the rest of the LJniversity "would be
stronger."
Other locations approved by the council
include a three- to five-acre site bordering
Alpine Road across trom the Ladera
Shopping Center. At least one resident of
neighboring Portola Valley has voiced
displeasure with the site, calling it
"environmentally poor."
The third site, now a horse corral and
riding area, is on Deer Creek Road, east of
Interstate 280 between Arastradero and

Page Mill Roads.
The three locations were approved ear
lier in the month by the University Com
mittee on Building and Land Develop
ment, headed by Robert Freelen, vice
president for public affairs.
A report from the planning committee
said buildings for the library will total be
tween 50,000 to 100,000 square feet, re
quiring five to seven acres in addition to
possible open space-density requirements.
Biology Prof. Craig Heller questioned
the Juniperro Serra site at a Faculty Senate
meeting last Thursday. Heller said in an in
terview last night that if the expected
majority of visitation to the library is from
off campus. "It would make sense to place
it close to 280."

Heller also said he "just didn't approve
of the symbolism" of locating the library in
a place that overlooks the campus.
Heller said he was assured the library
would be located in a ravine and access
would be from Campus Drive West. The
planning committee report noted that the
Juniperro Serra site would be obscured
from campus by foothills and trees.
The planning committee was created in
March by University President Donald
Kennedy. Kennedy, in a memo to poten
tial committee members, said they were
"charged with responsiblity for recom
mending to me a detailed plan for the
siting and physical configuration of the
Ronald Reagan library."
