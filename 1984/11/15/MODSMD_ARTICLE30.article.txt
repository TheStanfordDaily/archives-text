# Jarreau sings of love and means each word
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER 
It takes a special kind of person to
go in front of a packed house for two
and a half hours and sing love songs
and mean it. Anyone can grab the
microphone and sing lyrics like,
"Darling, after all, I will be the one to
hold you in my arms." But few can do
so and really mean it, night after
night, show after show, album after
album.
AI Jarreau is one of the few.

Jarreau brought his act to the San
Jose Center for the Performing Arts
last week, went out in front of a
packed house for two and a half hours
and sang his love songs. And meant
every word he sang.
Tickets weren't cheap to what Bill
Graham Presents called "An Evening
with Al Jarreau," but they didn't
need to be to fill the two-tiered con
cert hall. Jarreau concerts are good —
always. BGP asked $20 for an or

chestra seat and got it. BGP also got
enough demand to warrant schedul
ing a second San Jose appearance the
nekxt night.
Jarreau concerts are always good
because Jarreau's voice is so good. If
there's a better, more versatile pop
male vocalist in the world, he hasn't
cut an album yet. And besides his
voice, Jarreau's band is good. It's
made up of bits and pieces of
jazz/fusion bands and hence its mem
bers are more talented than your
run-of-the-mill pop musicians.
Still, just when everything sounds
so good, there is one problem. Jar
reau often makes things sound too
good. It's one thing to have the
majority of your songs be of the opti
mistic, love-will-prevail-always vari
ety. It's quite another to have all of
them that way.
Every Jarreau song is a happy song.
If he brings a problem into a song, he
solves it. With love. Always love.
Which is all good and well, except
that the world isn't as pretty a place
as Jarreau makes it out to be.
But after an initial reaction of
"This is so sweet that I get a cavity
just listening to it," you begin to
weigh the alternatives. Jarreau could
sing all depressing songs, like former
Doobie brother Michael McDonald.
He could sing about the pain of bro
ken hearts and families. He could
leave the listener depressed or, if the
song was powerful enough, in tears.
Or he could sing about happy
things. Sure, what Jarreau sings about
isn't always the way it is, but it's
something to shoot for. Better happy
than sad.
And that's why people who see him
live leave the concert hall with smiles
on their faces. It's like they just
received a shot of smiles that lasts
them until they see Jarreau again or
listen to one of his albums.
Speaking of albums, Jarreau
released his most recent one, called
"High Crime," just weeks ago. Un
fortunately, it isn't quite up to par
with his three other albums of the
1980s, one of which — "Breakin'
Away" — won a Grammy Award a
few years back.
But saying it isn't quite up to par
