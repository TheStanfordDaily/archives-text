DEVO — Shout ☆ ☆ V2
It's really tough to review a
DEVO album, because the
band is such a living self
parody that it almost critiques
itself. Nothing here has really
changed since "Oh, No, It's
DEVO"; the same obnoxious
song structures, meaningless
monotone vocals and in
scrutable strangeness reign su
preme. The band is still earning
paychecks by wearing tacky,
post-nuclear clothing styles and
playing synthesizers with the
same inspiration that it takes to
brush one's teeth. The ingenu-

Revenge of the Killer B's
☆ ☆
This is the second volume of
the "Killer B's" series, a
method devised by Warner
Brothers to convert otherwise
unsellable B-sides of famous
bands' singles into new
revenue-generators. The first
volume, "Attack of the Killer
B's" contained original,
worthwhile tracks that other
wise would have been hard to
track down and expensive to
purchase in their 45-rpm ver
sions. The greatest fault of
"Revenge," however, lies in its
too-blatant imitation of its

ity and originality the band dis
played in its early days — evi
dent in songs like
"Satisfaction" — is long gone.
Today's DEVO is as formula
ridden as any of synth pop's
more cliched constituents. The
only reasons to listen to its later
albums are for laughs and so
cial dancing. Unfortunately,
"Shout" delivers little in either
area — the tracks are virtually
undistinguishable from each
other, and the band's ob
noxiousness, while still over
whelming, becomes tiresome
rather than amusing. Overall,

band's music began as sterile,
basic melodies with relentless
drum tracks and stupid lyrics.
Between then and now,
though, the British band's lyrics
took a Soviet tone, and the
sound evolved to become a
uniquely cold and intimidating
accompaniment to the stark,
foreboding messages of Martin
Gore, the band's chief writer.
This album contains the usual
share of depressing commen
taries on life here in the Free
World, but Gore's revisionism
is less effective than ever
before, more alienated and less

twelve songs onto a piece of
vinyl like any K-Tel collection,
without any thought of the
finished product as a whole.
The charm and novelty of
"Attack" is missing — this
package was seemingly made
more for money acquisition
than the genuine satisfaction of
record buyers. The tracks that
are worth buying are few and
far between, and none really
stands out and begs to be lis
tened to. Only the most
devoted music-collectors will
find enough material here to
make "Revenge" worth the
cash.

coherent, and above all, more
complaint than remedy. And
the music has regressed from
catchy (though by no means
cheery) melodies to multi
layered tonal rhythmatic synth
bangings that become irritating
after extended listening. Some
songs are still playable, such as
the hit "People Are People,"
but for the most part Depeche's
concept is less accessible, less
challenging and ultimately less
rewarding than on previous ef
forts.

Depeche Mode — Some Great
Reward ☆ ☆ V2
Depeche Mode's all-synth
approach to its new wave has
had its ups and downs. The


DEVO's antics and automusic
have largely lost their appeal,
rendering this album unevent
ful and pretty forgettable.
