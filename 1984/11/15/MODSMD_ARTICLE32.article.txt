# Looks to four more years in House
## Zschau says 'no' to senate bid 
### FRANK LESTER Staff writer 
In the wake of a successful re-election bid, Congress
man Ed Zschau (R-Los Altos) will seek a third term in the
House in 1986 but will not run for the Senate, aides said
yesterday.
Joan Williams, Zschau's district administrative assis
tant, and campaign manager Drew Doherty cited
Zschau's determination to honor his current responsibili
ties in Congress and to his family as the potent factors in
determining his decision not to shoot for the Senate.
"He said [running for the Senate] would prevent him
from fulfilling the responsibility of his current office, and
also to his family," Williams said.
"He's got a daughter who's still in high school — a
freshman — and she's at home," Doherty said. He added
that Zschau decided it would be better to devote himself
to the responsibilities of his congressional office than to
"spend his time running up and down the state campaign

ing" for the Senate.
Doherty said Zschau s priorities tor his second term in
clude "reducing the federal deficit" and getting involved
in the tax reform debate, continuing to be a "leader" in
sponsoring "specific legislation" for area high-tech indus
tries and, in his capacity as a member of the House
Foreign Affairs Committee, continuing his role in arms
control to improve relations with the Soviet Union.
Doherty said Zschau s victory did not stem from a
coat tail effect of nationwide Republican victories on
Nov. 6. He said the outcome was a product of voters
having "recognized his responsiveness" to their needs.
The "techniques" that Doherty said attracted voters to
Zschau included the congressman's attendance at a range
of town meetings and the fact that he "communicated
with his constituents."
Williams said that Zschau does plan to run again for the
House in "His plan was, when he first came in, to
run for three terms. That's six years," she said.
