# Betas placed on probation

The University placed the Beta Theta Pi fra
ternity on probation yesterday, following a re
ported sexual assault at a Beta House party
last Thursday night.
"The probation is against a house that has
generally been very responsible," according to
Norm Robinson, associate dean of student af
fairs.
Alleged victims and witnesses at the Betas'
Thursday night party charged that onlookers
had watched and even cheered an assailant as
he ripped the clothes off a young woman, but
had not offered any help. Five women to date
have filed separate battery charges against the
same man, all saying he attacked them at the
party.
Robinson said he put the fraternity on proba
tion "so that there would be no risk of this hap
pening again."
"The University needs assurance that nothing
like that will happen again, at the Beta House
parties or any fraternity party," Robinson wrote
in a letter to Beta President Dennis Furlong.
The probation stipulates that the Beta frater
nity "is restricted from having any parties or so
cial gatherings, whether open to the whole
campus or open only to house members," ac
cording to Robinsons letter. Probation will
remain in effect at least until the Inter-
Fraternity Council has completed an investiga
tion of "the apparent lack of good policies and
control at open fraternity parties" and for
warded its recommendations for approval, Rob
inson said.

"We want [to know] what specific steps they
would take to ensure that this does not happen
again," Robinson said.
IFC Chairman Rick Hoskins said the council
plans to convene tonight and to release a set of
fraternity party guidelines immediately follow
ing the meeting.
Robinson said he believes that Beta
members have acted "very responsibly" since
the incident, adding that he has not yet met with
them. He praised a report compiled by Mike
Melendez, Beta resident assistant, on behalf of
the house, and told the fraternity that it may
submit additional information to him until the
end of the week "if it would warrant reviewing
the probation decision."
Robinson also said he would consider "an
amendment to the probation if the house
wanted to have a non-alcoholic party."
He said he feels the probation will effectively
prevent a recurrence of the Thursday incident.
"It gives them the time to develop mechanisms
ensuring that their parties are under control. . . .
Anybody who hosts a party has the responsibil
ity to make sure the party is under control and
must also have the mechanism to make sure it
can get back under control."
Melendez and Beta President Dennis Furlong
said they believe that a host organization should
be responsible for monitoring its parties but not
necessarily for ensuring that individuals behave
properly. "We are responsible as far as the sit
uation is concerned, but not as far as specific in
dividuals go," Furlong said.
