# Committee hammers out code change
## 
### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Staff writer 
The Student Conduct Legislative Council (SCLC) has for
mally proposed several changes to the "Interpretations
and Applications of the Honor Code" that will attempt to
clarify the issues of proctoring in exams and penalty
grading.
"We have not had much reaction so far except a few
[responses] from faculty members and some support from
the administration," according to Law Prof. Barbara Bab
cock, who is working with SCLC on the proposed legisla
tion. "It is up for grabs at this point."
The proposed legislation defines more precisely the ac
ceptable limits to a professor's or teaching assistant's pres
ence in the classroom during an examination. The current
text defines proctoring as "being present in the examina
tion room for the purpose of preventing dishonesty."
"Proctoring (under the proposed text) is being in the
classroom during an examination," said Wilfred Stone,
professor of English. The only exception is to "go in to ex-

plain things for a
brief period" or
to investigate
any alleged
cheating re
ported by other
students taking
the exam.
"It (the legis
lation) clarifies a
situation where
some teachers
have proctored
because they felt
there might be
cheating. The
professors are
then violating
the Honor Code,
and they are

bound by it as much as the students," Stone said.
The practice of plea bargaining with teachers for grades
encouraged the SCLC to clarify the issue of penalty
grading. Under the current tcrt, "An instructor who
suspects dishonesty may, with the student's consent, re
quest that the work be redone and resubmitted, giving a
grade on the resubmitted work."
The proposed text would prohibit the professor from
using the grading system as a means of dealing with a stu
dent's suspected violation of the Honor Code.
"This is all up for review; it is not final," Stone said.
"Whenever the issue is clearly a moral issue — cheating or
attempting to cheat or deceive — then it is out of his or
her (the professor's) hands and should go to the Judicial
Council. If it is an intellectual decision, the teacher can
handle it however he pleases within the realm of under


Barbara Babcock
standing. That distinction should be made clear.
"It is still a subject matter that is likely to be a debate
over words," he said, referring to an "intellectual"
opposed to a "moral" violation. Both last year's and this
year's committees are in general agreement on the princi
ple of the proposed amendment, he said.
The effect of the proposed changes on the penalty
grading area is not definite, according to Sally Cole, a
judicial affairs officer, "because that requires knowing to
what extent penalty grading is occurring now. If it is not
going on, it is not significant. If there is a lot of penalty
grading, it may lead to an increase of cases present in my
office."
Requiring students and faculty members not to engage
in this process is different from ensuring that these
practices do not happen. Cole said.
The proposed amendment also creates a new subsection
on "the importance of appearances." The proposed text
says,"It is important that students be individually honest
and that they appear to be honest. Students should
refrain from actions that would cause reasonable people
to doubt their honesty."
The addition is designed to prevent students from doing
anything provocative that other people might not under
stand, Babcock said.
