# Committee hammers out code change
## 
### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Staff writer 
The Student Conduct Legislative Council (SCLC) has for
mally proposed several changes to the "Interpretations
and Applications of the Honor Code" that will attempt to
clarify the issues of proctoring in exams and penalty
grading.
"We have not had much reaction so far except a few
[responses] from faculty members and some support from
the administration," according to Law Prof. Barbara Bab
cock, who is working with SCLC on the proposed legisla
tion. "It is up for grabs at this point."
The proposed legislation defines more precisely the ac
ceptable limits to a professor's or teaching assistant's pres
ence in the classroom during an examination. The current
text defines proctoring as "being present in the examina
tion room for the purpose of preventing dishonesty."
"Proctoring (under the proposed text) is being in the
classroom during an examination," said Wilfred Stone,
professor of English. The only exception is to "go in to ex-

plain things for a
brief period" or
to investigate
any alleged
cheating re
ported by other
students taking
the exam.
"It (the legis
lation) clarifies a
situation where
some teachers
have proctored
because they felt
there might be
cheating. The
professors are
then violating
the Honor Code,
and they are

bound by it as much as the students," Stone said.
The practice of plea bargaining with teachers for grades
encouraged the SCLC to clarify the issue of penalty
grading. Under the current tcrt, "An instructor who
suspects dishonesty may, with the student's consent, re
quest that the work be redone and resubmitted, giving a
grade on the resubmitted work."
The proposed text would prohibit the professor from
using the grading system as a means of dealing with a stu
dent's suspected violation of the Honor Code.
"This is all up for review; it is not final," Stone said.
"Whenever the issue is clearly a moral issue — cheating or
attempting to cheat or deceive — then it is out of his or
her (the professor's) hands and should go to the Judicial
Council. If it is an intellectual decision, the teacher can
handle it however he pleases within the realm of under
