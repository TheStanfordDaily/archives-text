Embassy fires on civilian plane
WASHINGTON — Security guards protecting the U.S. ambassador's
residence in Beirut fired at a light plane that they believed was about to
attack them but which turned out to be a Saudi Arabian civilian craft on
its way to Beirut International Airport, U.S. officials said yesterday.
The guards and Lebanese army troops protecting the nearby presiden
tial palace fired .50 caliber machine guns and anti-aircraft guns at the
plane as it flew low over the buildings, but the aircraft was not hit. One
official said he was told the plane actually made two passes over the
buildings in an eastern suburb of Beirut before landing at the airport in
southern Beirut.
The incident took place at about 5:30 p.m. Tuesday in darkness or
near-darkness. Officials said the private Saudi plane strayed from the ac
cepted flight path for approach into the Beirut airport.
Still, officials, who have only sketchy information about the incident,
said they are puzzled about why the Lebanese soldiers did not know that
the plane was a "friendly" aircraft cleared to land at the airport. They
said they also are not sure why no one was able to hit the plane, although
they said they do not know exactly how low or how fast it was flying.
Philippine leader assassinated
MANILA, Philippines — Opposition Mayor Cesar Climaco was as
sassinated early yesterday by a gunman in the southern city of Zam
boanga, the Philippines News Agency reported.
Climaco, 68, was inspecting the ruins of a burned building when the
killer shot Climaco in the back of the head with a .45 caliber pistol just
after the mayor sent his two bodyguardsjon an errand.
Witnesses said the gunman fled on foot.
Climaco, who once said he would not cut his hair until President Fer
dinand Marcos resigned, died at the Zamboanga Doctors Hospital.
Climaco was elected to Parliament in the May 14 elections but
preferred to keep his post as mayor.
Former Senator Salvador Laurel, president of the country's largest
opposition political party, of which Climaco was a member, condemned
the killing as an "emerging pattern to decimate the moderate and non
violent opposition by either the bullet or the Comelec (Commission on
Elections)."
Laurel was referring to opposition leaders Benigno Aquino Jr. and
Alex Orcullo, who also were assassinated, and opposition member of
Parliament Aquilino Pimentel, who was earlier ousted by the Comelec
on alleged election irregularities.
Israeli withdrawal talks resume
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Lebanon announced yesterday that it was end
ing a five-day boycott and resuming negotiations with Israel aimed at
bringing about a withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon.
The Lebanese announcement came after Israeli forces near the port of
Sidon, 25 miles south of Beirut, released three officials of Amal, a Shia
Moslem militia, who had been detained since last Thursday.
The Lebanese government announced Saturday that it would boycott
the troop withdrawal talks until Israel released four Amal officials ar
rested in a security crackdown following an attack on an Israeli patrol
last week. An Israeli soldier was killed in the attack.
Israeli forces continued to hold the fourth official, Mahmoud Fakih,
who is the Amal commander in Sidon. However, Lebanese officials said
it was understood that Fakih would be released following the resumption
of the talks today at the headquarters of the U.N. peacekeeping force in
the Lebanese border town of Naqoura.
A statement issued by Lebanese President Amin Gemayel's office
said the resumption of the troop withdrawal talks had been arranged
after "the fruitful efforts by the United Nations and the good offices of
|J.N. Secretary General (Javier) Perez de Cuellar."

Nicaragua compared to Vietnam
WASHINGTON — A top Pentagon official said yesterday the
Reagan administration wants to avoid a war with Nicaragua but warned
that "another Vietnam" could develop in the area unless Congress
restores support for the anti-government rebels there.
The official, Undersecretary of Defense Fred Ikle, indicated that the
administration plans to ask Congress for unrestricted CIA aid to rebels
fighting the leftist Sandinista regime. Moreover, he said the administra
tion hopes last week's confrontation over the possible delivery of Soviet
MiG jets to Nicaragua will prompt the Democratic-led House to end its
opposition to the covert program.
In an interview, Ikle also said he doubts the State Department's
negotiations with the Sandinistas can succeed because the leading ele
ments in the Managua regime are "Bolsheviks." But, he said, the admin
istration will continue trying to negotiate anyway.
"It is precisely to counter the risk of U.S. combat forces ever being re
quired in the region that we want to give security assistance (and) eco
nomic assistance to the democracies in Central America and that we
want to support those who are fighting for democracy in Nicaragua,"
Ikle said.
"And we think its a tragic mistake on the part of those who . . . oppose
assistance to the so-called contras (rebels) to think that they are avoiding
another Vietnam," he said. "If there's a road to another Vietnam, it
ivould more likely be the development of Nicaragua more and more
a militarized state . . . eventually moving toward an offensive ac
tion against its neighbors. . . . And if we have to become involved at that
stage, it will be more dangerous and more difficult and more costly."
Yugoslav arrested for war crimes
LOS ANGELES— Andrija Artukovic, an 85-year-old Croatian exile
described by federal officials as one of the highest-ranking Nazi war
criminals still living in this country, was arrested yesterday morning at
his home in Seal Beach, Calif., at the request of the Yugoslavian govern
ment.
U.S. Attorney Robert Bonner, in announcing the arrest at a news con
ference, said he will "move to expedite" the extradition of Artukovic to
Yugoslavia for trial on charges that he was largely responsible for the
murders of 770,000 Serbs, Croatians, Jews, Gypsies and Orthodox
Christians during World War 11.
Another Justice Department official said Artukovic was known as the
"Himmler" of the Nazis' puppet government in Yugoslavia. Heinrich
Himmler headed Germany's dreaded Gestapo and SS during World War
11. Artukovic served the puppet government as minister of justice.
The Justice Department has been trying for more than 30 years to
deport Artukovic.
Baby Fae has rough road ahead
LOMA LINDA, Calif. — "Baby Fae," the longest-surviving human
recipient of an animal heart, may have suffered permanent damage from
her body's first effort to reject the alien tissue and will likely have several
more such crises, doctors said yesterday.
But officials at the Loma Linda University Medical Center said the in
fant, one month old yesterday, was recovering well from a slack beat in
her transplanted baboon heart and a rise in her body's infection fighters
•that marked her first rejection episode.
"We are encouraged and hopeful that she will come out of this trium
phant," said Dr. David Hinshaw, a surgeon at this Seventh Day Adven
,tist institution and a spokesman for the baby's doctors.
The hospital's morning medical report said signs of dangerous
infection-fighting substances in Baby Fae's blood had declined in the last
24 hours. Although she was still not producing enough urine, a sign of
heart and kidney function, "she remains pink and warm, with
. ;out fever," the report said.
Stocks quiet in light trading
NEW YORK — The stock market closed mixed yesterday after a
quiet, meandering session.
Only a few big-name issues, responding to corporate developments,
posted more than fractional price changes.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down about 4 points at mid
day, wound up with a .33 gain at 1,206.93.

the killing as an "emerging pattern to decimate the moderate and non

Laurel was referring to opposition leaders Benigno Aquino Jr. and
Alex Orcullo, who also were assassinated, and opposition member of
Parliament Aquilino Pimentel, who was earlier ousted by the Comelec
on alleged election irregularities.
Israeli withdrawal talks resume
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Lebanon announced yesterday that it was end
ing a five-day boycott and resuming negotiations with Israel aimed at
bringing about a withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon.
The Lebanese announcement came after Israeli forces near the port of
Sidon, 25 miles south of Beirut, released three officials of Amal, a Shia
Moslem militia, who had been detained since last Thursday.
The Lebanese government announced Saturday that it would boycott
the troop withdrawal talks until Israel released four Amal officials ar
rested in a security crackdown following an attack on an Israeli patrol
last week. An Israeli soldier was killed in the attack.
Israeli forces continued to hold the fourth official, Mahmoud Fakih,
who is the Amal commander in Sidon. However, Lebanese officials said
it was understood that Fakih would be released following the resumption
of the talks today at the headquarters of the U.N. peacekeeping force in
the Lebanese border town of Naqoura.
A statement issued by Lebanese President Amin Gemayel's office
said the resumption of the troop withdrawal talks had been arranged
after "the fruitful efforts by the United Nations and the good offices of
|J.N. Secretary General (Javier) Perez de Cuellar."

Nicaragua compared to Vietnam
WASHINGTON — A top Pentagon official said yesterday the
Reagan administration wants to avoid a war with Nicaragua but warned
that "another Vietnam" could develop in the area unless Congress
restores support for the anti-government rebels there.
The official, Undersecretary of Defense Fred Ikle, indicated that the
administration plans to ask Congress for unrestricted CIA aid to rebels
fighting the leftist Sandinista regime. Moreover, he said the administra
tion hopes last week's confrontation over the possible delivery of Soviet
MiG jets to Nicaragua will prompt the Democratic-led House to end its
opposition to the covert program.
In an interview, Ikle also said he doubts the State Department's
negotiations with the Sandinistas can succeed because the leading ele
ments in the Managua regime are "Bolsheviks." But, he said, the admin
istration will continue trying to negotiate anyway.
"It is precisely to counter the risk of U.S. combat forces ever being re
quired in the region that we want to give security assistance (and) eco
nomic assistance to the democracies in Central America and that we
want to support those who are fighting for democracy in Nicaragua,"
Ikle said.
"And we think its a tragic mistake on the part of those who . . . oppose
assistance to the so-called contras (rebels) to think that they are avoiding
another Vietnam," he said. "If there's a road to another Vietnam, it
ivould more likely be the development of Nicaragua more and more
a militarized state . . . eventually moving toward an offensive ac
tion against its neighbors. . . . And if we have to become involved at that
stage, it will be more dangerous and more difficult and more costly."
Yugoslav arrested for war crimes
LOS ANGELES— Andrija Artukovic, an 85-year-old Croatian exile
described by federal officials as one of the highest-ranking Nazi war
criminals still living in this country, was arrested yesterday morning at
his home in Seal Beach, Calif., at the request of the Yugoslavian govern
ment.
U.S. Attorney Robert Bonner, in announcing the arrest at a news con
ference, said he will "move to expedite" the extradition of Artukovic to
Yugoslavia for trial on charges that he was largely responsible for the
murders of 770,000 Serbs, Croatians, Jews, Gypsies and Orthodox
Christians during World War 11.
Another Justice Department official said Artukovic was known as the
"Himmler" of the Nazis' puppet government in Yugoslavia. Heinrich
Himmler headed Germany's dreaded Gestapo and SS during World War
11. Artukovic served the puppet government as minister of justice.
The Justice Department has been trying for more than 30 years to
deport Artukovic.
Baby Fae has rough road ahead
LOMA LINDA, Calif. — "Baby Fae," the longest-surviving human
recipient of an animal heart, may have suffered permanent damage from
her body's first effort to reject the alien tissue and will likely have several
more such crises, doctors said yesterday.
But officials at the Loma Linda University Medical Center said the in
fant, one month old yesterday, was recovering well from a slack beat in
her transplanted baboon heart and a rise in her body's infection fighters
•that marked her first rejection episode.
"We are encouraged and hopeful that she will come out of this trium
phant," said Dr. David Hinshaw, a surgeon at this Seventh Day Adven
,tist institution and a spokesman for the baby's doctors.
The hospital's morning medical report said signs of dangerous
infection-fighting substances in Baby Fae's blood had declined in the last
24 hours. Although she was still not producing enough urine, a sign of
heart and kidney function, "she remains pink and warm, with
. ;out fever," the report said.

Embassy fires on civilian plane
WASHINGTON — Security guards protecting the U.S. ambassador's
residence in Beirut fired at a light plane that they believed was about to
attack them but which turned out to be a Saudi Arabian civilian craft on
its way to Beirut International Airport, U.S. officials said yesterday.
The guards and Lebanese army troops protecting the nearby presiden
tial palace fired .50 caliber machine guns and anti-aircraft guns at the
plane as it flew low over the buildings, but the aircraft was not hit. One
official said he was told the plane actually made two passes over the
buildings in an eastern suburb of Beirut before landing at the airport in
southern Beirut.
The incident took place at about 5:30 p.m. Tuesday in darkness or
near-darkness. Officials said the private Saudi plane strayed from the ac
cepted flight path for approach into the Beirut airport.
Still, officials, who have only sketchy information about the incident,
said they are puzzled about why the Lebanese soldiers did not know that
the plane was a "friendly" aircraft cleared to land at the airport. They
said they also are not sure why no one was able to hit the plane, although
they said they do not know exactly how low or how fast it was flying.
Philippine leader assassinated
MANILA, Philippines — Opposition Mayor Cesar Climaco was as
sassinated early yesterday by a gunman in the southern city of Zam
boanga, the Philippines News Agency reported.
Climaco, 68, was inspecting the ruins of a burned building when the
killer shot Climaco in the back of the head with a .45 caliber pistol just
after the mayor sent his two bodyguardsjon an errand.
Witnesses said the gunman fled on foot.
Climaco, who once said he would not cut his hair until President Fer
dinand Marcos resigned, died at the Zamboanga Doctors Hospital.
Climaco was elected to Parliament in the May 14 elections but
preferred to keep his post as mayor.
Former Senator Salvador Laurel, president of the country's largest
opposition political party, of which Climaco was a member, condemned
the killing as an "emerging pattern to decimate the moderate and non
