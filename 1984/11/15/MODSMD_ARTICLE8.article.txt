## Soviets hedge on arms talks 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” A senior So
viet Embassy official yesterday des
cribed the Reagan administration's
proposal for "umbrella talks" on
arms control as unprecedented in
U.S.-Soviet relations and said Mos
cow is awaiting further specifics
before making a definitive response.
Among other things, the diplomat
said, the Soviet side is attempting to
learn at what level of government and
in what city the proposed talks might
be held, where the United States
thinks they might lead and what is
sues would be considered first. The
last point is of central importance to
Moscow, which has given high
priority to talks aimed at averting
anti-satellite and space weaponry
while refusing to engage in negotia
tions on offensive nuclear missiles.
The Reagan administration, on the
other hand, is eager to engage the
Soviets on offensive strategic arms
but reluctant to negotiate about space
weapons in view of President
Reagan's strong commitment to a
space-based strategic defense initia

tive.
The Soviet official spoke to
reporters at a Soviet Embassy recep
tion and asked that his name not be
used. Soviet Ambassador Anatoliy
Dobrynin, host of the reception, said
in a brief speech that "there should
be and are openings and possibilities
for a fruitful dialogue and coopera
tion based on mutual interest and
respect."
A senior White House official last
week listed six areas for discussion
under "umbrella talks": intercon
tinental ballistic missiles, medium
range missiles in Europe, weapons in
space, chemical weapons, confidence
building measures and conventional
forces in Europe. He spoke of the
proposed discussions as being "across
the board" but did not say how they
would work.
"You introduced something new in
the history of Soviet-American rela
tions, the umbrella. What is it?"
asked the Soviet diplomat in a joshing
exchange with U.S. reporters. "A
mackintosh (raincoat) we can under

stand, (but) this must be studied,
said the official.
Dobrynin reportedly probed for
details of the U.S. proposal during a
meeting here with Secretary of State
George Shultz on Oct. 26. Soviet
Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko is
said to have raised similar questions
on Oct. 31 in a Moscow meeting with
U.S. Ambassador Arthur Hartman.
Shultz met yeterday with Reagan
and his national security affairs ad
viser, Robert McFarlane, to discuss a
foreign-policy agenda for Reagan s
second term. Officials said arms
control negotiations with the Soviet
Union are at the top of the agenda.
A State Department official said
the United States is likely to provide
additional details of the umbrella
proposal to the Soviet Union through
diplomatic channels after Thanksgiv
ing.
The White House made public a
Reagan message to Soviet leaders,
responding to congratulations on his
re-election. "Despite our different
political beliefs and perspectives on

international problems, I am confi
dent we can make progress on
strengthening peace and resolving
our differences through discussions
and negotiations," Reagan said.
Soviet sources said they knew of
nothing to substantiate reports that
Shultz and Gromyko might meet in
Moscow in January to inaugurate a
new phase of superpower discussions.
The two seemed to agree during
Gromyko's late September trip to
Washington that another meeting
might be a good idea, said a Soviet
diplomat, who added that there has
been no active discussion of such a
session in the present diplomatic
dialogue.
Officials on both sides said U.S.-
Soviet scheduling already calls for a
visit here next month by the Soviet
minister of agriculture, Valentin
Mesyets, to reciprocate for a 1983
Moscow trip by Secretary of
Agriculture John Block for the sign
ing of a five-year grain agreement.
