# Shuttle gets second satellite
## 
### 
HOUSTON — Two high-flying astronauts
plucked a second wayward satellite from orbit yes
terday, making one of the most difficult assign
ments in the history of the space shuttle program
look like a snap.
During the second spacewalk of the Discovery's
flight, astronauts fussed with their equipment,
rejoiced in their work and, like weekend mechan
ics, chased their tools around the work area.
But when it was all over they had two satellites
safely tucked into the Discovery's cargo bay —
Palapa B-2, rescued Monday, and Westar 6,
rescued yesterday. Both had been misfired into
useless orbits from the shuttle Challenger in
February.
"We have two satellites locked in the bay," Dis
covery Commander Frederick Hauck told mission
control.
"Give you guys a handshake and a slap on the
back for a super job," answered Jerry Ross, an
astronaut who was handling the radio at mission
control.
The Wester 6 salvage began early yesterday as
the Discovery passed over the eastern Pacific into
daylight. Dale Gardner, wearing a jet-powered
backpack and pushing what looked like a garden
cart with a long snout, flew about 35 feet to Westar
and skewered it with a long prong.
Meanwhile, Joseph Allen perched on the very tip
of the shuttle's robotic arm like an orbiting surfer,
hifciaet locked in footreastraints. •
Gardner used his maneuvering je.ts to stabilize
the spinning satellite and then pushed it a few feet
toward Allen. Allen grabbed the satellite, and then

he, the satellite and the arm were maneuvered over
the cargo bay by Anna Fisher from the Discovery's
flight deck.
The operation required Allen to hold the glitter
ing, 1,098-pound Wester satellite steady for about
an hour and a half as Gardner attached a berthing
adapter to its base. Although the shuttle's crew
made it look easy, the operation required very
precise maneuvers in order to haul the barrel-like
satellite aboard without damaging it or the shuttle,
or, more importantly, endangering the two crew
men who were outside the spacecraft.
The original plan for the retrieval called for using
the robotic arm to grab the satellite by a temporary
brace that the astronauts were to install on the top
of Westar. That proved impossible during the first
satellite rescue Monday, and the 5-foot, six-inch
Allen manhandled the satellite instead. It worked
so well the first time that the crew asked to do it the
same way again on the second rescue.
The unusual use of the robotic arm yesterday was
the only significant difference between the two
satellite rescues. Monday, Allen stood on the edge
of the shuttle, giving him a far more awkward angle
to handle the satellite. Standing on the arm yester
day made it possible for him to hold the satellite
straight down instead of over his head.
"It's much easier with the arm," he told mission
control.
Allen gave only a slight hint that his feat was at
times a little unsettling. Astronaut David Walker,
observing from the Discovery flight deck, advised
him at one point to stay clear of a support at the
end of the arm so that his lifeline would not become

entangled.
"It's sort of like a security blanket," he said of
the support as his small frame extended out from
the arm while the earth slipped past at 17,500 mph.
"It's something to hold on to."
When it was all over, mission control told the
Discovery that Hauck "did such a good job"
maneuvering the space craft that "we've got
enough propellant for one more (satellite rescue) if
you guys see any bogies (flying objects) there."
Yesterday's rescue was not without its tense mo
ments, however. A torque wrench that Gardner
needed to bolt the satellite to the spacecraft got
away after apparently slipping from the astronaut's
lifeline.
"You've just lost the wrench," Walker nearly
shouted at Gardner.
"Where did it go? Where did it go?" Gardner
shouted back, obviously alarmed. Not only was the
wrench essential to the task, a loose object that size
could pose a danger to the spacecraft during re
entry if not found and secured.
Walker watched the wrench as it glided across
the cargo bay and up against a bulkhead, and he
relayed the location to Gardner. Pulling on his
lifeline, Gardner shot across the cargo bay to
retrieve it.
Although an earlier shuttle crew retrieved a sci
entific satellite for repairs in orbit, never before
had men rescued satellites written off as lost by the
insurance industry because of rocket failure. No
other nation has that capability.
