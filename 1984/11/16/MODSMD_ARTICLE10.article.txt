# Balanced budget unlikely by '88
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Reagan
administration, faced with the
prospect of a budget deficit that could
hit a record $210 billion next year,
appears to be abandoning any at
tempt to balance the budget by the
end of the decade, officials said yes
terday.
"There is no way we can propose
cuts in spending alone that can get to
zero deficits," an administration offi
cial involved in budget planning said.
"And any tax increase is out of the
question."
President Reagan, in a two-and-a
half hour Cabinet meeting yesterday,
again ordered agency heads to
produce a new federal budget with
significant spending cuts and "no tax
increase," according to White House
spokesman Larry Speakes.
Speakes said no specific budget
deficit figure was agreed upon during
the meeting, but he indirectly ac
knowledged that budget planners had

limited their goal to merely shrinking
the widening deficits rather than
trying to eliminate them.
Budget Director David Stockman,
Speakes said, presented "a number of
options that would reduce the deficit
over a period to a certain percentage
of the gross national product," a tar
get he refused to specify.
Stockman's proposed cuts, he said,
were "very general and very hypot
hetical," and Reagan "showed no
preference for any of them."
Asked whether there was any sug
gestion that some form of tax hike
might be necessary, Speakes replied,
"1 don't think anyone would have
dared."
Even with Reagan's firm ruling
against tax increases, however, a
group of business and conservative
organizations are apparently worried
about just that possibility. A new
coalition led by J. Peter Grace was
announced yesterday to oppose any

tax reform that might be used to mask
an increase in taxes.
"The danger does exist that tax
reform will become a euphemism for
tax increases," said hotel and restau
rant executive J. W. Marriott Jr., a
member of the group. "This coalition
will not permit a disguised tax in
crease to slip by unnoticed during the
tax reform process."
Reagan has vowed to present a tax
simplification plan next year that
would eliminate many tax deductions
and exemptions but that would keep
the overall tax burden about the
same. Any such plan would raise
taxes for some individuals while cut
ting them for others.
Grace, who was head of Reagan's
Private Sector Survey on Cost Con
trol, told a news conference: "We're
not being taxed too little, we're
spending too much."
Among the members of the coali

tion are the National Association of
Manufacturers, the American Busi
ness Conference, the National Cham
ber of Commerce and the American
Conservative Union.
This week, as White House officials
begin their examination of budget op
tions for the next fiscal year, various
factions both inside and outside the
administration have relied on news
leaks, private memos and public
statements in an attempt to influence
the outcome of the budget document
that Reagan will submit to Congress
early next year.
An economist for the Chamber of
Commerce, for instance, complained
that Stockman's budget office was ex
aggerating the deficit projections for
next year to undercut Reagan's ear
lier assertions that rapid economic
growth alone would significantly
shrink future deficits.
