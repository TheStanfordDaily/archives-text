## Give them the Axe, then steal it back 
### DAN DeLUCE 
It began with a baseball game.
Billy Erb, Stanford yell-leader
from the class of '01, and four fellow
Stanford students bought a 10-
pound, 15-inch axe and took it to
a Stanford-Berkeley baseball game
on April 13, 1899.
It was the crucial game of a three
game series, in which Cal had won the
first game. Stanford star George Be
ckett, captain of the baseball team,
had died before the season began. So
the Cardinal rooters tried to give the

team an extra boost. The Axe was a
prop for the newly written Stanford
yell: "Give'em the Axe."
Stanford ended up losing a closely
fought game. It seemed the Axe had
failed, it was through. But of course,
it was not. Cal rooters, after their vic
tory, stole the Axe and fled. A wild
chase through the streets of San Fran
cisco ensued in which a Stanford
hurdler got the Axe back for a mo
ment until Cal's star quarterback
tackled him.
Stanfordites, along with police,

gathered at the San Francisco ferry
terminal. Though all passengers were
given, in Erb's words, "the once
over," a Cal man managed to
smuggle the Axe under his overcoat
while accompanied by a woman. An
other Berkeley student hid the handle
in his trouser leg and limped aboard.
Californians took the Axe to
Berkeley where it was stored in the
vaults of the Bank of America Trust.
The Axe remained there for the next
31 years.
There were several attempts at
retrieving the Axe by Stanford stu
dents, but all were ill-fated.
But on April 3, 1930, the Axe
returned miraculously to Stanford. A
group of Stanford students led by
Don Kropp, known as the "Immortal
21," schemed for three years to get
the Axe back.
Cal took the Axe out of the bank
vaults once a year for its Cal-Axe
rally. Stanford men, perched on the
rumble seat of a roadster, posed as
photographers in front of the bank
where the Axe was being brought
back for safe-keeping.
Berkeley baseball pitcher Norman
Horner was the guardian of the Axe.
As his car pulled up, the cameramen
waved back the Cal guards to get a
photo. They obliged. Amid blinding
flash bulbs and the smoke of two
homemade tear-gas bombs, big
Howard Avery of Stanford wrestled
the Axe from Horner. He gave it to a
nearby accomplice, who then gave it
to Leon Loofbourow, who put it un
der his sweater and walked calmly to
the get-away car, which then roared
away.
Avery, according to plan, allowed
himself to be captured, and other
members of the group sent Cal search
parties in the wrong direction. Fi
nally, the operator of the Dumbarton
bridge, a Stanford man, raised the
bridge and halted the Cal pursuit of
the Stanford conspirators.
The "Immortal 21" returned in
glory to Stanford as heroes, and each
was awarded the prestigous block let
ter "S."
In 1933, the two schools decided to
use the Axe as a Big Game trophy.
Refurbished and mounted, the Axe is
awarded to the winner of the game.
Since then there have been eight
heists of the Axe, and numerous
aborted attempts.
The last successful Stanford heist
was in 1973 when the "Infamous

Three," two Theta Delta Chi frater
nity members and a Stanford law stu
dent, obtained the Axe in the parking
lot of Ming's restaurant in Palo Alto.
The law student, brother of one of the
Theta Delts in the trio, impersonated
Cal coach Mike White over the tele
phone and told his secretary that a
newspaper photographer wanted to
photograph the Axe at a Northern
California Football Writers luncheon
at Ming's.
Cal's rally committee delivered the
Axe, following a car with the two
Stanford Theta Delts posing as Cal
athletes (wearing Cal letter jackets).
Upon arrival, the two expected to
find a group of more than 10 of their

fraternity brothers to meet them in
Ming's parking lot, but none were
there.
One of the Stanford theives asked
if he could protct the plaque from the
rain with a cover. After getting poses
sion of the Axe he ran away but was
tackled on the hood of a car. At that
moment, the fraternity brothers
arrived and the Axe was taken from
Cal's hands. All the while, Cal's real
coach sat eating lunch inside Ming's.
There have been other pranks in
the rivalry over the years, like when
Cal students set a time bomb and
blew up the woodpile for a Stanford
Big Game bonfire. And in 1982, after
Stanford was robbed of a victory due

to "The Play," in which Cal ran back
a kickoff through the Stanford Band,
The Daily printed a bogus four
page Daily Californian with the
headline "NCAA Awards Big Game
to Stanford."
This year, the new letters spelling
"Stanford Stadium" were stolen, and
many suspect that the culprits lie
across the Bay.
Big Game festivities have changed
over the years — from an all-male
cast in the 1905 production of
Gaieties, to parades with floats, 70-
foot high bonfires in the lakebed of
Lagunita and raucous pre-game
rallies in the City. Still, one element
of the rivalry has lived on: the Axe.

The Axe should once again be displayed in its case in Tresidder Union
after tomorrow's game. The Axe has been dearly missed since 1982,
when it was won by Berkeley after "The Play."

Berkeley baseball pitcher Norman
Horner was the guardian of the Axe.
As his car pulled up, the cameramen
waved back the Cal guards to get a
photo. They obliged. Amid blinding
flash bulbs and the smoke of two
homemade tear-gas bombs, big
Howard Avery of Stanford wrestled
the Axe from Horner. He gave it to a
nearby accomplice, who then gave it
to Leon Loofbourow, who put it un
der his sweater and walked calmly to
the get-away car, which then roared
away.

Theta Delts in the trio, impersonated
Cal coach Mike White over the tele

Cal's rally committee delivered the
Axe, following a car with the two

athletes (wearing Cal letter jackets).

when it was won by Berkeley after "The Play."

The last successful effort to steal the Axe was launched by a group of Theta Delts in 1973. After posing as
photographers, they heisted the Axe in the parking lot in front of Ming's restaurant.
It began with a baseball game.
Billy Erb, Stanford yell-leader
from the class of '01, and four fellow
Stanford students bought a 10-
pound, 15-inch axe and took it to
a Stanford-Berkeley baseball game
on April 13, 1899.
It was the crucial game of a three
game series, in which Cal had won the
first game. Stanford star George Be
ckett, captain of the baseball team,
had died before the season began. So
the Cardinal rooters tried to give the

team an extra boost. The Axe was a
prop for the newly written Stanford
yell: "Give'em the Axe."
Stanford ended up losing a closely
fought game. It seemed the Axe had
failed, it was through. But of course,
it was not. Cal rooters, after their vic
tory, stole the Axe and fled. A wild
chase through the streets of San Fran
cisco ensued in which a Stanford
hurdler got the Axe back for a mo
ment until Cal's star quarterback
tackled him.
Stanfordites, along with police,

gathered at the San Francisco ferry
terminal. Though all passengers were
given, in Erb's words, "the once
over," a Cal man managed to
smuggle the Axe under his overcoat
while accompanied by a woman. An
other Berkeley student hid the handle
in his trouser leg and limped aboard.
Californians took the Axe to
Berkeley where it was stored in the
vaults of the Bank of America Trust.
The Axe remained there for the next
31 years.
There were several attempts at
retrieving the Axe by Stanford stu
dents, but all were ill-fated.
But on April 3, 1930, the Axe
returned miraculously to Stanford. A
group of Stanford students led by
Don Kropp, known as the "Immortal
21," schemed for three years to get
the Axe back.
Cal took the Axe out of the bank
vaults once a year for its Cal-Axe
rally. Stanford men, perched on the
rumble seat of a roadster, posed as
photographers in front of the bank
where the Axe was being brought
back for safe-keeping.

Horner was the guardian of the Axe.
