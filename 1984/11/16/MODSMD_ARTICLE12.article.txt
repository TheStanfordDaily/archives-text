The King is dead. Martin Luther King, Sr., af
fectionately known as Daddy King, died Sunday
at the age of 84.
King is most famous for being the father of
Nobel Peace Prize winner Martin Luther King,
Jr. But Daddy King was a freedom fighter in his
own right.
As we look back over the landscape of King's
life, we are deeply saddened. After so much pain,
sacrifice and suffering by so many people,
America has changed so little.
We still fall short of the Kings' dream of justice
and equality. Racism continues to eat away at the
fabric of American society.
Sixteen years after King's tragic assassina
tion, black unemployment and poverty rates are
still twice that of whites. Half of all black children
live in poverty, and the black teenage unemploy
ment rate approaches 50 percent.
The picture is similarly bleak for women and
other minorities. Women make only 59 cents for
every dollar men make. The poverty rate for
Hispanics is 29 percent, the highest rate in 20
years.
The bigotry of the nation's electorate was
dramatized in the presidential election. Several
people were arrested for threatening the Rev.
Jesse Jackson's life. On Nov. 6, 90 percent of the
black vote went to Walter Mondale while 70 per
cent of the white vote went to President Reagan.

In Mississippi, 91 percent of the black vote
went for Mondale and 86 percent of the white
vote went to Reagan. Despite the blatant racial
polarization of the South, the Democratic Party is
schizophrenic when it comes to racism. While the
party cannot get white votes, it continues to dis
enfranchise its most loyal constituency group by
supporting dual primaries that discriminate
against black candidates.
The rest of the country is just as intolerant as
the South, though less forthright about it.
America cannot ratify the Equal Rights
Amendment. Vincent Chin, a Chinese
autoworker, was mistaken for a Japanese and
beaten to death by two white men as a protest
against Japanese auto imports. California voted
overwhelmingly to abolish bilingual ballots. The
Holocaust memorial was defaced in San Fran
cisco, as was the Gay Liberation statue at Stan
ford.
Amid the "rebirth of patriotism," we find it
understandable if women, blacks, Hispanics,
gays, lesbians, Asians, Arabs, Jews and Native
Americans have difficulty saluting the American
flag. The Kings devoted their entire
lives to the cherished American principles of
freedom, justice and equality. Yet, instead of
any real change in the character of American so
ciety, they were rewarded with abuse and an as
sassin's bullet. Something is seriously wrong with
this country.
