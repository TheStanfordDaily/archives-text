## Not by bread alone

I was glad to see an article on co
ops by Jeffery Knowlton (The Daily,
Nov. 8) which did not treat them as
anachronistic oddities where throw
backs to the 1960s eat drugs and howl
at the moon; however, there is a great
deal more to be said about co-ops
than that they save you
money and provide you with ample

opportunity to clean bathrooms.
While the benefits of co-op living
cannot be unequivocally confirmed
by those both inside and outside the
co-op system, at least the goals of the
cooperative deserve our most serious
and protracted attention. These goals
are none other than those most com
monly discussed in any political phil
osophy text or Western Culture
course, and it is perhaps for this rea
son that we seem to do such a poor
job learning how we might implement
them in our own lives. I am speaking
of the high-flung words of Western
philosophy: authority, responsibility,
community — in short, why should
we have anything to do with each
other in a society where it is
seemingly so easy to "get along" by
ourselves?
The Greek philosophers ap
parently spent much of their time
thinking and writing about political
systems and the role of the individual
in such systems. A couple of jnore
modern favorites, Hobbes and Rous
seau, had a great time constructing
ideal states. And if you want to spend
a fun afternoon in the library, try dig
ging into "The Prince," paying spe
cial attention to the more flamboyant
sections.
All of these examples point to one
major concern: Either we are more
comfortable ignoring the possibilities
present in a supposed participatory

democracy, or we never got past our
fascination with the political theorists
who we let do our thinking for us.
So what does all of this have to do
with the six co-ops on campus, two of
which are faced with possible extinc
tion? To paraphrase a former profes
sor, one of the undeniable and
pervasive fictions colleges and multi
versities teach each day is that life's
problems present themselves to indi
viduals, with repercussions that do
not extend beyond individuals. It is
not surprising to me that President
Reagan is to "preside" for four more
years— or that Res Ed is considering
"consolidating" the co-op system —
in a society where we seem firmly
convinced that the source and outer
frontier of all significant action is the
self.
Co-ops at least have some concep
tion of the possibilities for action in
common, for discussion and work un
der the rubric of popular concerns
and agreement. While the closest you
might get to a community of equals
might only be found in a political the
ory text, there are places on this
campus where living involves more
than an occasional conversation, tests
and papers, parties and jobs, inter
views and internships. How will we
work out the problems of an increas
ingly interdependent world if we
don't even have the courage or im
agination to survive a discussion with
our housemates?
Why should it so be so difficult to
find enough people to live in co-ops
when these same matters come up
again and again in an environment
where something might possibly be
learned and some valuable progress
be made? That is what the co-ops
have to offer you at Stanford.
Thoreau said it best: "Now. Or
never."
