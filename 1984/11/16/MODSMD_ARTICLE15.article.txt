## Dreams of unity in India 
### 
Communal harmony is our need No. 1. We must
and shall preserve it with all our might.
These words of P.V. Narasimha Roa, home
minister in Rajiv Gandhi's new cabinet, reflect In
dia's current contrary dedication to unity. Setting
the goal of communal harmony for a nation as
diverse as India is indeed laudable, but using
"might" or the military as a means of achieving this
goal will only push it further out of reach.
Mohandas Gandhi also dreamed of true communal
harmony in India, but he strived to achieve this
progressive change through peaceful, not military,
means. The recent events in India seem to indicate
that too many Indians regard this dream of
Gandhi's just as dead as the man himself.
The assassination of Indira Gandhi by two Sikhs
in her security staff let loose a tidal wave of vio-

lence and riots that resulted in 1,000 dead and
25,000 homeless. Twelve Sikhs were reportedly
hanged at a train station and hundreds of others
were beaten while traveling. Still others had their
beards burned off, their homes wrecked or their
shops looted. These violent eruptions are hardly
characteristic of a nation supposedly dedicated to
peaceful coexistence.
Under two unifying leaders, the diverse country
of India has indeed made gains toward peaceful
coexistence. India is approximately 80 percent
Hindu and 12 percent Moslem, with the rest con
sisting of Sikhs, Christians and others. All these
historically antagonistic groups effectively banded
together in the 1940s under the leadership of
Mohandas Gandhi in the struggle for independence
from Britain. Jawaharlal Nehru was the first prime
minister of the new nation. During his rule he sue

cessfully promoted unity by emphasizing demo
cratic, pluralistic values and by de-emphasizing re
ligious differences.
It is questionable how much of Nehru's ability to
unify was inherited by his daughter, Indira Gandhi.
Her declaration of a state of emergency in 1975 in
dicates that she was probably authoritarian at
heart. Rather than providing for a broader base of
potential leaders, she seeemed to value a dynasty
over a democracy because of the particular political
grooming of her sons, Sanjay and Rajiv. Further
more, her power politics last summer, the attempt
to oust N.T. Rama Rao, a leader of the opposition
party and regional governor in the state of Andhra
Pradesh, show her lack of political wit since the at
tempt not only failed but even intensified the
already strong regionalism there.
These criticisms are perhaps overshadowed by
the stabilizing effect Indira Gandhi's 15 years of
leadership has had. She successfully centralized
government control to accomplish impressive
growth in the areas of industrialization, education
and defense. More important, for a country ridden
with religious conficts, she stressed the idea of a
secular state, even up to the point of ignoring warn
ings that Sikhs should be weeded out of her security
forces after the Punjab attack.
Gandhi's ordered attack on the Golden Temple
in Amritsar, Punjab, was obviously not the solution
to the problem posed by the extremist Sikh
separatists. The battle left 600 Sikhs and Indian
soldiers dead. The surviving Sikh leaders were im
prisoned and Punjab was put under military con
trol. Yet a burning hatred still remains — the very
hatred that motivated Indira Gandhi's assassins —
the very hatred that was only intensified by the sub
sequent Hindu attacks on the Sikhs.
It remains to be seen whether the new and inex
perienced prime minister, Rajiv Gandhi, will create
a more diplomatic policy of handling Sikh
separatists or whether the state of Punjab will
fester into another Northern Ireland. He must ad
dress the economic and social issues fundamental
to the Sikh separatist movement. First, Sikhs claim
that the current distribution of river waters and
farm goods of the Punjab state are inequitable. In
addition, the Sikhs claim they have never been offi

cially recognized as a distinct religious entity, yet
discrimination officially exists.
The noted writer V.S. Naipaul offers an inter
esting theory as to why religious groups like the
Sikhs become militant and separatist. He claims
that it is human nature to seek identity, meaning
and self-awareness in groups. "Self-awareness
leads to self-assertion," he claims. "Mingled with
religion, it's a very explosive mixture . . . possible
suicidal." We have seen this mixture explode in
Iran.
This explosive mixture is also clearly present
among the Sikhs. They must remove terrorism
from their methods of asserting their demands if a
real resolution in India is ever to come about. The
five chief Sikh priests have themselves become
militant political figures: The one priest who did

by following the precedent set by India's President
Zail Singh, himself a Sikh. Last week, on the
birthday of the Sikh founder guru Nank Dev, Presi
dent Singh appealed for adherence to guru Dev's
original principles of peace, tolerance and non
violence.
It is in the light of these principles that Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi should pursue uniqtie meth
ods of improving intra-Indian relations. If Indians
can keep the dream of peaceful coexistence alive
within their diverse country, then perhaps there is
hope that the dream can spread to an international
level.

original principles of peace, tolerance and non
violence.
It is in the light of these principles that Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi should pursue uniqtie meth
ods of improving intra-Indian relations. If Indians
can keep the dream of peaceful coexistence alive
within their diverse country, then perhaps there is
hope that the dream can spread to an international
level.

Communal harmony is our need No. 1. We must
and shall preserve it with all our might.
These words of P.V. Narasimha Roa, home
minister in Rajiv Gandhi's new cabinet, reflect In
dia's current contrary dedication to unity. Setting
the goal of communal harmony for a nation as
diverse as India is indeed laudable, but using
"might" or the military as a means of achieving this
goal will only push it further out of reach.
Mohandas Gandhi also dreamed of true communal
harmony in India, but he strived to achieve this
progressive change through peaceful, not military,
means. The recent events in India seem to indicate
that too many Indians regard this dream of
Gandhi's just as dead as the man himself.
The assassination of Indira Gandhi by two Sikhs
in her security staff let loose a tidal wave of vio-

lence and riots that resulted in 1,000 dead and
25,000 homeless. Twelve Sikhs were reportedly
hanged at a train station and hundreds of others
were beaten while traveling. Still others had their
beards burned off, their homes wrecked or their
shops looted. These violent eruptions are hardly
characteristic of a nation supposedly dedicated to
peaceful coexistence.
Under two unifying leaders, the diverse country
of India has indeed made gains toward peaceful
coexistence. India is approximately 80 percent
Hindu and 12 percent Moslem, with the rest con
sisting of Sikhs, Christians and others. All these
historically antagonistic groups effectively banded
together in the 1940s under the leadership of
Mohandas Gandhi in the struggle for independence
from Britain. Jawaharlal Nehru was the first prime
minister of the new nation. During his rule he sue

cessfully promoted unity by emphasizing demo
cratic, pluralistic values and by de-emphasizing re
ligious differences.
It is questionable how much of Nehru's ability to
unify was inherited by his daughter, Indira Gandhi.
Her declaration of a state of emergency in 1975 in
dicates that she was probably authoritarian at
heart. Rather than providing for a broader base of
potential leaders, she seeemed to value a dynasty
over a democracy because of the particular political
grooming of her sons, Sanjay and Rajiv. Further
more, her power politics last summer, the attempt
to oust N.T. Rama Rao, a leader of the opposition
party and regional governor in the state of Andhra
Pradesh, show her lack of political wit since the at
tempt not only failed but even intensified the
already strong regionalism there.
These criticisms are perhaps overshadowed by
the stabilizing effect Indira Gandhi's 15 years of
leadership has had. She successfully centralized
government control to accomplish impressive
growth in the areas of industrialization, education
and defense. More important, for a country ridden
with religious conficts, she stressed the idea of a
secular state, even up to the point of ignoring warn
ings that Sikhs should be weeded out of her security
forces after the Punjab attack.
Gandhi's ordered attack on the Golden Temple
in Amritsar, Punjab, was obviously not the solution
to the problem posed by the extremist Sikh
separatists. The battle left 600 Sikhs and Indian
soldiers dead. The surviving Sikh leaders were im
prisoned and Punjab was put under military con
trol. Yet a burning hatred still remains — the very
hatred that motivated Indira Gandhi's assassins —
the very hatred that was only intensified by the sub
sequent Hindu attacks on the Sikhs.
It remains to be seen whether the new and inex
perienced prime minister, Rajiv Gandhi, will create
a more diplomatic policy of handling Sikh
separatists or whether the state of Punjab will
fester into another Northern Ireland. He must ad
dress the economic and social issues fundamental
to the Sikh separatist movement. First, Sikhs claim
that the current distribution of river waters and
farm goods of the Punjab state are inequitable. In
addition, the Sikhs claim they have never been offi

cially recognized as a distinct religious entity, yet
discrimination officially exists.
The noted writer V.S. Naipaul offers an inter
esting theory as to why religious groups like the
Sikhs become militant and separatist. He claims
that it is human nature to seek identity, meaning
and self-awareness in groups. "Self-awareness
leads to self-assertion," he claims. "Mingled with
religion, it's a very explosive mixture . . . possible
suicidal." We have seen this mixture explode in
Iran.
This explosive mixture is also clearly present
among the Sikhs. They must remove terrorism
from their methods of asserting their demands if a
real resolution in India is ever to come about. The
five chief Sikh priests have themselves become
militant political figures: The one priest who did
