Flagrant violations
Several prominent campus organi
zations have been found guilty of
serious violations of University
policy. The Stanford Progressive
Alliance (SPA), Stanford Students
for Mondale-Ferraro and the various
Students Against Reaganism
(STAR) groups have flagrantly
violated strict University rules that
prohibit the use of University
telephones and office space for par
tisan political activity and forbid
organizations not recognized by the
University from using University
facilities. The violations include the
below:
1) Prior to Nov. 6, STAR Coali
tion and Students for Mondale-
Ferraro had been using the student
funded telephones and University
office space of the Stanford Progres
sive Alliance as the major contact
points for Democratic campaign
operations;
2) STAR reserved the Law School
Lounge for use by the Students
Against Reaganism Political Action
Committee (STAR-PAC). STAR
PAC is prohibited from using Uni
versity facilities because of its un
recognized status and its purpose of
raising funds for political campaigns.
Under STAR's sponsorship, STAR
PAC held a "Donation Party" in the
Law School Lounge at which mem
bers voted to determine which cam
paigns would receive STAR-PACs
substantial funds.
The above are not simply accusa
tions — they are facts. Each one of
the charges has been unequivocally

verified by Asst. Dean of Student
Affairs Michael Ramsey-Perez in his
report dated Nov. 9.
In deciding an appropriate
penalty, the University and the
ASSU Senate must keep in mind the
severity of the violations perpetrated
by the groups listed above. SPA,
STAR. STAR-PAC, STAR Coali
tion and Stanford Students for
Mondale-Ferraro have compromised
the mandatory non-partisan position
of Stanford University. Their use of
University facilities for political
purposes violates Title 26 of the
United States Code, thereby threat
ening the tax-exempt status of Stan
ford. Their activities also run counter
to the University's Founding Grant.
We urge that strong action be
taken immediately to demonstrate
that the violations which occurred
were neither sponsored nor
condoned by Stanford University.

Our election a sham
The American press mindlessly
parrots President Reagan's formula
for distorting news about Nicaragua's
recent election: It is said that the
"principal opposition party" chose
not to participate. This refers to
non-candidate Arturo Cruz, who
lives in Washington, D.C., and is
supported by the hated anti-
Sandinista contras. After lengthy

vacillation, a coalition of capitalist
parties, whose supporters in
Nicaragua number 2,000 at most,
chose Cruz to be their "candidate."
Besides boycotting the election, his
"campaign" has consisted of oppos
ing voter registration, airing tapes of
his views on the CIA-backed Voice
of America and a short trip to
Nicaragua to proclaim his support
for the contras. But 1.5 million
voters registered, more than the
Sandinistas had hoped for. Over 80
percent of them voted and over 70
percent of those voting supported
the Sandinista's Ortega. There were
six real-world opposition parties that
had no trouble participating in the
election.
By contrast, only 53 percent of
Americans registered to vote did so
in our election. That means that less
than a majority re-elected Reagan,
despite the widely touted
"landslide." American politics would
be very different with seven parties
on the ballot.
Whose election was a sham?
A majority of Americans are already
opposed to invading Nicaragua. But
Reagan couldn't wait one day to
begin fishing for a pretext. Even if
Nicaragua does receive some old,
low-speed MiG jets, who is he to
deny them a defense? Nicaragua has
1 2 subsonic combat aircraft now,
fewer than its neighbors El Salvador
(59) and Honduras (30). This is not
to mention the "Colossus to the
North" that has opposed democracy
in the tiny country by invading it no
fewer than 14 times. It won't be so
easy next time.

The press needs to be more critical
of government policy. The media
play a crucial role in either clarifying
the situation, or spreading lies and
myths that make war possible. But
no matter how much Reagan denies
it, he hesitates to invade because a
majority in Nicaragua and in
America will vote in action against
the war for which he wants a
mandate. That's the election that
counts. Get ready to vote with your
feet, to join the anti-war demonstra
tions that those in office require to
remind them what Americans really
want.

In the proper place
I read the article about the pro
posed construction of the Reagan
library in the Nov. 7 Campus
Report. I was dismayed to see that
construction of the library may result
in the destruction of valuable grazing
area. Then a wonderful idea struck
me — an idea that is feasible,
economical and aesthetically pleas
ing. The Reagan administration can
save a great deal of money by not
constructing a new facility for the
library, but rather by taking advan
tage of the abandoned buildings of a
local business venture in financial
decline. I have in mind Chuck E.
Cheese's Pizza Time Theater.

In the proper place
I read the article about the pro
posed construction of the Reagan
library in the Nov. 7 Campus
Report. I was dismayed to see that
construction of the library may result
in the destruction of valuable grazing
area. Then a wonderful idea struck
me — an idea that is feasible,
economical and aesthetically pleas
ing. The Reagan administration can
save a great deal of money by not
constructing a new facility for the
library, but rather by taking advan
tage of the abandoned buildings of a
local business venture in financial
decline. I have in mind Chuck E.
Cheese's Pizza Time Theater.

Flagrant violations
Several prominent campus organi
zations have been found guilty of
serious violations of University
policy. The Stanford Progressive
Alliance (SPA), Stanford Students
for Mondale-Ferraro and the various
Students Against Reaganism
(STAR) groups have flagrantly
violated strict University rules that
prohibit the use of University
telephones and office space for par
tisan political activity and forbid
organizations not recognized by the
University from using University
facilities. The violations include the
below:
1) Prior to Nov. 6, STAR Coali
tion and Students for Mondale-
Ferraro had been using the student
funded telephones and University
office space of the Stanford Progres
sive Alliance as the major contact
points for Democratic campaign
operations;
2) STAR reserved the Law School
Lounge for use by the Students
Against Reaganism Political Action
Committee (STAR-PAC). STAR
PAC is prohibited from using Uni
versity facilities because of its un
recognized status and its purpose of
raising funds for political campaigns.
Under STAR's sponsorship, STAR
PAC held a "Donation Party" in the
Law School Lounge at which mem
bers voted to determine which cam
paigns would receive STAR-PACs
substantial funds.
The above are not simply accusa
tions — they are facts. Each one of
the charges has been unequivocally

verified by Asst. Dean of Student
Affairs Michael Ramsey-Perez in his
report dated Nov. 9.
In deciding an appropriate
penalty, the University and the
ASSU Senate must keep in mind the
severity of the violations perpetrated
by the groups listed above. SPA,
STAR. STAR-PAC, STAR Coali
tion and Stanford Students for
Mondale-Ferraro have compromised
the mandatory non-partisan position
of Stanford University. Their use of
University facilities for political
purposes violates Title 26 of the
United States Code, thereby threat
ening the tax-exempt status of Stan
ford. Their activities also run counter
to the University's Founding Grant.
We urge that strong action be
taken immediately to demonstrate
that the violations which occurred
were neither sponsored nor
condoned by Stanford University.

Our election a sham
The American press mindlessly
parrots President Reagan's formula
for distorting news about Nicaragua's
recent election: It is said that the
"principal opposition party" chose
not to participate. This refers to
non-candidate Arturo Cruz, who
lives in Washington, D.C., and is
supported by the hated anti-
Sandinista contras. After lengthy

vacillation, a coalition of capitalist
parties, whose supporters in
Nicaragua number 2,000 at most,
chose Cruz to be their "candidate."
Besides boycotting the election, his
"campaign" has consisted of oppos
ing voter registration, airing tapes of
his views on the CIA-backed Voice
of America and a short trip to
Nicaragua to proclaim his support
for the contras. But 1.5 million
voters registered, more than the
Sandinistas had hoped for. Over 80
percent of them voted and over 70
percent of those voting supported
the Sandinista's Ortega. There were
six real-world opposition parties that
had no trouble participating in the
election.
By contrast, only 53 percent of
Americans registered to vote did so
in our election. That means that less
than a majority re-elected Reagan,
despite the widely touted
"landslide." American politics would
be very different with seven parties
on the ballot.
Whose election was a sham?
A majority of Americans are already
opposed to invading Nicaragua. But
Reagan couldn't wait one day to
begin fishing for a pretext. Even if
Nicaragua does receive some old,
low-speed MiG jets, who is he to
deny them a defense? Nicaragua has
1 2 subsonic combat aircraft now,
fewer than its neighbors El Salvador
(59) and Honduras (30). This is not
to mention the "Colossus to the
North" that has opposed democracy
in the tiny country by invading it no
fewer than 14 times. It won't be so
easy next time.

The press needs to be more critical
of government policy. The media
play a crucial role in either clarifying
the situation, or spreading lies and
myths that make war possible. But
no matter how much Reagan denies
it, he hesitates to invade because a
majority in Nicaragua and in
America will vote in action against
the war for which he wants a
mandate. That's the election that
counts. Get ready to vote with your
feet, to join the anti-war demonstra
tions that those in office require to
remind them what Americans really
want.
