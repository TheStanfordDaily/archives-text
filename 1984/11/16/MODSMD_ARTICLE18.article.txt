## Rally could be victim of its own success 
### JENNIFER JENKINS 
Since the Big Game rally disaster in 1982, in which a
panic-stricken motorist accelerated into the Stanford
mob, student behavior has been the most talked about
aspect of the annual San Francisco rally.
Big Game rallies, which have been planned by the
Fiesta Committee in the past, and the Axe Committee
(which has taken over the old Fiesta Committee) this
year, have generally produced an outpouring of student
excitement and enthusiasm before the Berkeley footabll
game. However, behavior seems to have been getting out
of hand, and last year students were told to clean up their
act or run the risk of never having a City rally again.
The rally used to be a go-do-it type of thing," said Axe
Committee Director Kevin Solliday. "There was very little
control."
It was a type of free-for-all, and the students would
just go crazy," said former Band Director John Howard.
People would climb over cars, and anything in the way
could possibly get damaged," said Roble resident assistant
Firra Austin. San Francisco seemed to brace itself for the
rally."
After the injuries during the 1982 rally, it was clear that
something would have to be done. The City rally was

brought back on a trial basis for 1983. The route had to be
changed to a shorter one along the Embarcadero, instead
of the usually mountainous Nob Hill path. "The location
has shifted because it just doesn't do to have 5,000 people
in the dark marching down a residential street, which is
sometimes what happened," said Band announcer Hal
Mickelson. •
In addition to the change of venue, the Axe Committee
must obtain a parade permit and pay a deposit of $2,500
to Aquatic Park, where the Band plays after the march.
Police security has been emphasized, along with student
security volunteers.
Because of the changes, many students did not seem
satisfied with last year's rally. "It was over before it
started," said Solliday.
"The rally was boring last year," said LSJUMB Public
Relations Director Ed Gresser. "No one was thrilled
about the route, and we wanted to play longer."
This year the Axe Committee hopes to make the stu
dents happy, or at least happier than last year. The route
is five blocks longer than last year, with the Band playing
at Aquatic Park afterward as usual.
The emphasis on good conduct is still apparent. "There
will be little opportunity to get out of hand," said Gresser.
Student security volunteers from Sigma Chi, Kappa
Sigma, the Axe Committee and the crew team number
around 120 members, and will again be on hand with the
San Francisco police to keep things under control.
"People should listen to the student volunteers," said
Solliday, "because they are only doing it for your own
good."

Solliday feels that the rally will run smoothly this year.
"There were no arrests last year, but we are by no means
out of the woods. A little bit of moderation is a good idea,
and I strongly advise against people getting too intox
icated. The police will make arrests for vandalism and
open containers of alcohol."
The whole idea of the rally, though, is to have fun. "It's
great to look behind you and see the street filled with
people having a good time," said Austin. "People want to
get fired up before Saturday's game and yell themselves
hoarse," said Mickelson. "It's a lot of fun."

The rally in the City has its roots in the 19605. Around
that time, homecoming weekend had gone out of style,
and alumni had decided to visit Stanford on Big
Game weekend instead. According to Solliday, "In the
'60s, the bonfire rally was the big thing."
The imfamous bonfire is reputed to have been around
70 feet high and constructed of telephone poles. The re
sponsibility of building this inferno traditionally fell to the
freshmen class. "The telephone poles were usually ham
mered into the shape of an 'S' or a 'C,' " said Mickelson.
"Freshmen also had the responsibility of guarding the

bonfire against the Cal Weenies who would sometimes try
to sabotage it. Students would sleep next to it in the mud."
After this all-campus rally, held in the dry bed of Lake
Lagunita, the Band would skip up to the City to play for
the alumni parties, usually held in some of the nrcer hotels
on Nob Hill. According to Bursar Jon Erickson, who was
with the Band through 1974, "In 1966, a group of about
50 guys from Soto were invited by the Band to accompany
them to the City. These guys were really spirited, and also
provided a type of protection for the Band against the Cal
Band and drunken sailors." Wearing red battle helmets
with the word "Soto" emblazoned on one side and
"Stanford" on the other, these madcap loonies wedged
themselves into the Band buses for an evening of merri
ment.
After this, certain "Band groupies" started following
the Band to the City.
Around 1968, the Band started to play in the streets of
the North Beach area after the alumni parties. They were
aided by the services of a certain Carol Doda, who oblig
ingly stripped for the slack-jawed Band members. "The
word got back to the student body that the Band was up in
the City having a great time," said Erickson, "and more

'I strongly advise against
people getting too intox
icated.'

and more people decided to follow the Band and share in
the fun." Gradually more people ended up going to the
City for the rally after the bonfire. "The Band would
shout out invitations from the Boathouse where they
played," remarked Erickson.
"It was a spontaneous event, with the Band playing the
role of the Pied Piper," said Mickelson. Even though the
burlesque entertainment provided by the strippers ended
in the mid-70s, the City rally was popular.
In 1977, the last bonfire rally was held. Bonfires
were banned when neighborhood toughs decided to
use the bonfire for a little carousing of their own after the
Stanford student body had left. According to Howard,
"Hell's Angels used to come down to the bonfire and
party, and there were troubles with the police."
There was also the risk of personal injury to students
while building the bonfire. "If I [were] an administrator, I
would get worried about the kids up 70 feet in the air
building this thing," said Mickelson. "There were a lot of
broken arms and legs."
"Now the City rally was'institutionalized,' " said Erick
son. "It became the alternative Friday night event, and
groups started chartering buses."
"It was an attempt to fill the void left by the absence of
the bonfire rally," said Mickelson. However, the massive
student participation in the rally has led to problems.
"The rally has been a victim of its own success," said
Mickelson. "As more and more students got involved, it
began to attract the attention of the police who wished to
treat it as a parade. Now there are thousands of people
participating instead of a couple of hundred."

and I strongly advise against people getting too intox
icated. The police will make arrests for vandalism and
open containers of alcohol."
The whole idea of the rally, though, is to have fun. "It's
great to look behind you and see the street filled with
people having a good time," said Austin. "People want to
get fired up before Saturday's game and yell themselves
hoarse," said Mickelson. "It's a lot of fun."

The rally in the City has its roots in the 19605. Around
that time, homecoming weekend had gone out of style,
and alumni had decided to visit Stanford on Big
Game weekend instead. According to Solliday, "In the
'60s, the bonfire rally was the big thing."
The imfamous bonfire is reputed to have been around
70 feet high and constructed of telephone poles. The re
sponsibility of building this inferno traditionally fell to the
freshmen class. "The telephone poles were usually ham
mered into the shape of an 'S' or a 'C,' " said Mickelson.
"Freshmen also had the responsibility of guarding the

bonfire against the Cal Weenies who would sometimes try
to sabotage it. Students would sleep next to it in the mud."
After this all-campus rally, held in the dry bed of Lake
Lagunita, the Band would skip up to the City to play for
the alumni parties, usually held in some of the nrcer hotels
on Nob Hill. According to Bursar Jon Erickson, who was
with the Band through 1974, "In 1966, a group of about
50 guys from Soto were invited by the Band to accompany
them to the City. These guys were really spirited, and also
provided a type of protection for the Band against the Cal
Band and drunken sailors." Wearing red battle helmets
with the word "Soto" emblazoned on one side and
"Stanford" on the other, these madcap loonies wedged
themselves into the Band buses for an evening of merri
ment.
After this, certain "Band groupies" started following
the Band to the City.
Around 1968, the Band started to play in the streets of
the North Beach area after the alumni parties. They were
aided by the services of a certain Carol Doda, who oblig
ingly stripped for the slack-jawed Band members. "The
word got back to the student body that the Band was up in
the City having a great time," said Erickson, "and more

'I strongly advise against
people getting too intox
icated.'

and more people decided to follow the Band and share in
the fun." Gradually more people ended up going to the
City for the rally after the bonfire. "The Band would
shout out invitations from the Boathouse where they
played," remarked Erickson.
"It was a spontaneous event, with the Band playing the
role of the Pied Piper," said Mickelson. Even though the
burlesque entertainment provided by the strippers ended
in the mid-70s, the City rally was popular.
In 1977, the last bonfire rally was held. Bonfires
were banned when neighborhood toughs decided to
use the bonfire for a little carousing of their own after the
Stanford student body had left. According to Howard,
"Hell's Angels used to come down to the bonfire and
party, and there were troubles with the police."
There was also the risk of personal injury to students
while building the bonfire. "If I [were] an administrator, I
would get worried about the kids up 70 feet in the air
building this thing," said Mickelson. "There were a lot of
broken arms and legs."
"Now the City rally was'institutionalized,' " said Erick
son. "It became the alternative Friday night event, and
groups started chartering buses."
"It was an attempt to fill the void left by the absence of
the bonfire rally," said Mickelson. However, the massive
student participation in the rally has led to problems.
"The rally has been a victim of its own success," said
Mickelson. "As more and more students got involved, it
began to attract the attention of the police who wished to
treat it as a parade. Now there are thousands of people
participating instead of a couple of hundred."

Pandemonium used to rule at the annual Big Game rally, but organizers hope everything will run smoothly
this year. The rally is scheduled to start at 9:30 tonight at Pier 29.
Since the Big Game rally disaster in 1982, in which a
panic-stricken motorist accelerated into the Stanford
mob, student behavior has been the most talked about
aspect of the annual San Francisco rally.
Big Game rallies, which have been planned by the
Fiesta Committee in the past, and the Axe Committee
(which has taken over the old Fiesta Committee) this
year, have generally produced an outpouring of student
excitement and enthusiasm before the Berkeley footabll
game. However, behavior seems to have been getting out
of hand, and last year students were told to clean up their
act or run the risk of never having a City rally again.
The rally used to be a go-do-it type of thing," said Axe
Committee Director Kevin Solliday. "There was very little
control."
It was a type of free-for-all, and the students would
just go crazy," said former Band Director John Howard.
People would climb over cars, and anything in the way
could possibly get damaged," said Roble resident assistant
Firra Austin. San Francisco seemed to brace itself for the
rally."
After the injuries during the 1982 rally, it was clear that
something would have to be done. The City rally was

brought back on a trial basis for 1983. The route had to be
changed to a shorter one along the Embarcadero, instead
of the usually mountainous Nob Hill path. "The location
has shifted because it just doesn't do to have 5,000 people
in the dark marching down a residential street, which is
sometimes what happened," said Band announcer Hal
Mickelson. •
In addition to the change of venue, the Axe Committee
must obtain a parade permit and pay a deposit of $2,500
to Aquatic Park, where the Band plays after the march.
Police security has been emphasized, along with student
security volunteers.
Because of the changes, many students did not seem
satisfied with last year's rally. "It was over before it
started," said Solliday.
"The rally was boring last year," said LSJUMB Public
Relations Director Ed Gresser. "No one was thrilled
about the route, and we wanted to play longer."
This year the Axe Committee hopes to make the stu
dents happy, or at least happier than last year. The route
is five blocks longer than last year, with the Band playing
at Aquatic Park afterward as usual.
The emphasis on good conduct is still apparent. "There
will be little opportunity to get out of hand," said Gresser.
Student security volunteers from Sigma Chi, Kappa
Sigma, the Axe Committee and the crew team number
around 120 members, and will again be on hand with the
San Francisco police to keep things under control.
"People should listen to the student volunteers," said
Solliday, "because they are only doing it for your own
good."

Solliday feels that the rally will run smoothly this year.
