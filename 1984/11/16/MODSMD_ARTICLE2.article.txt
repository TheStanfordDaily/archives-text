# IFC formulates party guidelines
## 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Daily staff 
Stanford's Inter-Fraternity Council released a
set of guidelines yesterday stating that two
members of a host fraternity and two represen
tatives of the IFC must monitor all fraternity
parties and that high school students are
strongly discouraged from attending those par
ties.
In addition, the IFC included guidelines to
enforce the University's alcohol policy; to
remove from parties, by non-violent means, any
drunken guests or party-goers causing trouble;
to call on campus police, if necessary, for aid in
maintaining control of parties; and to place on
probation any fraternity that fails to adhere to
IFC policies.
"We just want to create a pleasant atmo
sphere for Stanford students to enjoy parties,"
said IFC Chairman Rick Hoskins after an IFC
meeting last night. "We felt it necessary to es
tablish a set of guidelines for all the fraterni
ties."
The guidelines were released following last
night's meeting, which was closed to reporters.
Hoskins said he plans to write a letter immedi
ately to Dean of Residential Education Norm
Robinson outlining the recommendations.
Hoskins said representatives of every frater
nity — housed and unhoused — were in atten
dance. Also present for the first part of the

meeting were Robinson; James Lyons, dean of
Student Affairs; Diana Conklin, associate dean
of Res Ed and director of the Row; James
Cadena, associate dean of Res Ed; and Marvin
Herrington, Stanford police chief.
Hoskins said each of the five discussed
"thoughts and concerns" about the fraternities,
which included high school students attending
parties here, host organizations losing control of
their parties, and fraternity functions focusing
too much on alcohol.
Hoskins called the IFC meeting "the best
we've ever had," saying "almost everybody
there was very interested and involved" in the
discussion. The council comprises the presidents
of the 19 University fraternities, one other rep
resentative of each fraternity, and six IFC offi
cers. Hoskins said about 40 people attended last
night's meeting.
"A lot of things need to happen soon," said
Larry Robertson, IFC director of community
services. "These are things that are already hap
pening in some houses. Now we want them to
happen in every house."
The guidelines discuss ways in which fraterni
ties may tl self-monitor" their parties. Hoskins
explained that many campus fraternities already
designate two house members to remain sober
and monitor parties. In addition to recommend-
ing that every fraternity provide its
own monitors, the guidelines say that
the IFC will name two overseers from
different fraternities to ensure that
the host fraternity's monitors are
doing their jobs and to "check the
fraternity's adherence to the set alco
hol policy."
Robertson noted that "it's the re
sponsibility of entire groups, not just
of monitors," to maintain control of
parties.
Hoskins and Robertson said the
council also discussed the responsi
bilities of guests attending fraternity
parties. "We require the basic cour
tesies you'd require of any guest,"
Hoskins said. "We don't expect
people to trash our house or pour
beer on our carpet or steal our things.
We open up our houses as a ser
vice. . .. [Guests] should act respon
sibly while attending."
Robertson said the council voted

unanimously to support the Univer
sity's current alcohol policy, adding,
"There was even enough of a concern
to form a separate committee to look
into it."
The IFCs guidelines say a host fra
ternity's monitors are responsible for
preventing drunken guests from
driving home.
The IFC also recommends that
"incidents that seem to be escalating
be calmly yet effectively surpressed,"
and notes that individuals who fail to
leave a party when asked to do so
may be charged with trespassing.
On contacting police, Hoskins said,
"They are a resource we will use if
necessary, possibly to make arrests.
Chief Herrington suggested that the
police are here to help.
"We will not let a party get out of
control," Hoskins said. "That's our
basic premise."
In addition to the committee
formed to study the focus of frater
nity parties on alcohol, a second com
mitee has been established to discuss
fraternity members' negative treat
ment of women as sex objects.
