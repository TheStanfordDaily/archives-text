# IFC formulates party guidelines
## 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Daily staff 
Stanford's Inter-Fraternity Council released a
set of guidelines yesterday stating that two
members of a host fraternity and two represen
tatives of the IFC must monitor all fraternity
parties and that high school students are
strongly discouraged from attending those par
ties.
In addition, the IFC included guidelines to
enforce the University's alcohol policy; to
remove from parties, by non-violent means, any
drunken guests or party-goers causing trouble;
to call on campus police, if necessary, for aid in
maintaining control of parties; and to place on
probation any fraternity that fails to adhere to
IFC policies.
"We just want to create a pleasant atmo
sphere for Stanford students to enjoy parties,"
said IFC Chairman Rick Hoskins after an IFC
meeting last night. "We felt it necessary to es
tablish a set of guidelines for all the fraterni
ties."
The guidelines were released following last
night's meeting, which was closed to reporters.
Hoskins said he plans to write a letter immedi
ately to Dean of Residential Education Norm
Robinson outlining the recommendations.
Hoskins said representatives of every frater
nity — housed and unhoused — were in atten
dance. Also present for the first part of the

meeting were Robinson; James Lyons, dean of
Student Affairs; Diana Conklin, associate dean
of Res Ed and director of the Row; James
Cadena, associate dean of Res Ed; and Marvin
Herrington, Stanford police chief.
Hoskins said each of the five discussed
"thoughts and concerns" about the fraternities,
which included high school students attending
parties here, host organizations losing control of
their parties, and fraternity functions focusing
too much on alcohol.
Hoskins called the IFC meeting "the best
we've ever had," saying "almost everybody
there was very interested and involved" in the
discussion. The council comprises the presidents
of the 19 University fraternities, one other rep
resentative of each fraternity, and six IFC offi
cers. Hoskins said about 40 people attended last
night's meeting.
"A lot of things need to happen soon," said
Larry Robertson, IFC director of community
services. "These are things that are already hap
pening in some houses. Now we want them to
happen in every house."
The guidelines discuss ways in which fraterni
ties may tl self-monitor" their parties. Hoskins
explained that many campus fraternities already
designate two house members to remain sober
and monitor parties. In addition to recommend-
