These rules are a beginning of a program, or a series of actions that the
fraternities are collectively taking to eliminate problems that have oc
curred in the past. The IFC is coordinating its efforts with programs
already existing in individual fraternities.
As the fraternities move into new phases, we are interested in:
1) Handling situations as they were presented to us, just as we are dealing
with the recent situations at fraternity parties.
2) Learning effective ways of self-monitoring: the end result being a fra
ternity system with a strong presence of responsibility. We expect the sys
tem to mature.
The Inter-Fraternity Council, on Thursday, Nov. 15, 1984, adopted by
consensus the following resolution:
1) Fraternity parties will enforce the University alcohol policy at all func
tions.
2) Each fraternity will notify one IFC officer when it has a party, four days
before the event. These officers are: Rick Hoskins, president; Bruce
Friedman, vice president; Rob West, treasurer; Ron Diaz, secretary;
Andy Beyer, director of public relations; and Larry Robertson, director of
community services.
3) The Inter-Fraternity Council will name two people who will act as
monitors for a given party who will:
a) check the fraternity's adherence to the set alcohol policy.
b) ensure that at least two members of a fraternity have been named
"designated monitors."
c) these monitors will be selected from different fraternities.
d) these monitors will report violations in the manner proposed.
4) At least two members from a fraternity hosting a party will be
"designated monitors" for the duration of the party. These persons will:
a) keep high school students out of parties by checking all party-goers
for student IDs, or using other methods. There will be an effort to actively
discourage high school students from ever attending another fraternity
party.
b) prevent guests from driving home while in an inebriated state.
c) remove people from the party who are drunk or causing unnecessary
disturbances.

Following is the text of the Inter-Fraternity Council's recommendations for frater
nity guidelines. IFC Chairman Rick Hoskins will formally present the council's
recommendations to Dean of Residential Education Norm Robinson.

d) not take physical action.
e) utilize police assistance in removing stubborn guests.
5) Violations will be dealt with in the following disciplinary manner:
a) first, a fraternity officer from the host fraternity will be notified that a
violation has been recorded, and informed to remedy it immediately.
b) if the violation is not alleviated, the monitor will inform an IFC offi
cer; and recommend to a host fraternity that the party be shut down im
mediately.
c) refusal by the host fraternity to adhere to the IFC policy will result in
probation from the IFC by the IFC Judicial Committee with further action
taken by this body.
ADDENDUM
The Inter-Fraternity Council also stresses a strong sense of urgency
with each of its individual organizations to encourage all house members
to maintain order and control in party situations. It is also encouraged that
incidents that seem to be escalating be calmly yet effectively surpressed.
The Inter-Fraternity Council and its member groups do not condone vi
olent or destructive actions or fighting in such instances or any such in
stances.
Individual fraternities are reminded that your actions, of whatever
form, encourage similar actions.
In closing, social events (i.e., parties, happy hours, etc.) sponsored by
fraternities are open to all campus students unless otherwise stated. Stu
dents who attend these events are considered guests of these houses. As
guests they are expected to act in a responsible and controlled manner.
Students are further expected to heed any request made by house officers
to leave the party and/or the house if their actions warrant such a recom
mendation.
Failure to follow such requests may lead to police involvement, and fur
ther, may result in the legally applicable charge of trespassing.
Failure by guests or houses to conduct themselves along the aforemen
tioned guidelines can result in unacceptable risks. Therefore, disciplinary
actions under the terms stated by the Inter-Franternity Council and Stan
ford University will follow any failure to comply.
In accordance with the Inter-Fraternity Council's goals as mentioned
previously, two committees have been formed to discuss and propose so
lutions for the concerns of: 1) the negative treatment of women as sex ob
jects by fraternity members and 2) the concern of the focus of fraternity
members being centered on alcohol consumption.

ADDENDUM
The Inter-Fraternity Council also stresses a strong sense of urgency
with each of its individual organizations to encourage all house members
to maintain order and control in party situations. It is also encouraged that
incidents that seem to be escalating be calmly yet effectively surpressed.
The Inter-Fraternity Council and its member groups do not condone vi
olent or destructive actions or fighting in such instances or any such in
stances.
Individual fraternities are reminded that your actions, of whatever
form, encourage similar actions.
In closing, social events (i.e., parties, happy hours, etc.) sponsored by
fraternities are open to all campus students unless otherwise stated. Stu
dents who attend these events are considered guests of these houses. As
guests they are expected to act in a responsible and controlled manner.
Students are further expected to heed any request made by house officers
to leave the party and/or the house if their actions warrant such a recom
mendation.
Failure to follow such requests may lead to police involvement, and fur
ther, may result in the legally applicable charge of trespassing.
Failure by guests or houses to conduct themselves along the aforemen
tioned guidelines can result in unacceptable risks. Therefore, disciplinary
actions under the terms stated by the Inter-Franternity Council and Stan
ford University will follow any failure to comply.
In accordance with the Inter-Fraternity Council's goals as mentioned
previously, two committees have been formed to discuss and propose so
lutions for the concerns of: 1) the negative treatment of women as sex ob
jects by fraternity members and 2) the concern of the focus of fraternity
members being centered on alcohol consumption.
