This restaurant is darling.
* Though the white archways with
hanging flower pots that adorn its en
trance don't seem quite English, they
are very distinctive. You should have
no trouble spotting the London
House as you drive down Ramona
Street.
Once you step inside, it's a differ
ent story. The London House is
warm, homey and rustic. I've never
been to London, but this restaurant
seems as friendly as 1 d imagine an
authentic English pub to be.
The London House is not only a
restaurant and pub. but also a gift,
antique and clothing shop. Celtic
sweaters and wools line the shelves
on the second level; the main floor is
for dining and for displays of gifts, in
cluding innumerable types of biscuits,
crackers, teas and jams.
We sat at a cosy table next to a
warm fireplace. Our waiter offered us

There was a delay in getting our
entrees: The waiter apologized,
saying the salmon boat was late com
ing in. He must have thought himself
quite comical, because we could hear
him telling the kitchen crew what he
had told us.
When we did get our food, it was
steaming hot â€” something I really
appreciate after three years of
lukewarm dorm food. Both dishes
were nicely presented, and served
with delicious, sweet carrots.
The salmon steak was acceptable,
hut it was overcooked and submerged
in a white sauce that was too thick
and too tasteless.
The roast beef, however, was very
good. We asked for it rare and it was
cooked exactly to specification. The
Yorkshire pudding, made savory by
the meat's drippings, was also good.
The roast potatoes were scrumptious.
About this time, our service
became somewhat schizophrenic.
Our Union Jack-clad waiter took
over another table, and for the rest of
our dinner we were alternately atten
ded by another waiter and waitress.

a drink from the full bar. We didn't
know exactly where to begin, because
the London House drink list has so
many offerings, including 24 (mostly
British) beers (priced from $1.75 to
$2.25). We chose an alcoholic cider
($2.95), which was only slightly sweet
and resembled beer to me.
The dinner menu has seven
entrees; the dinners include soup or
salad, a hot roll and vegetables. And,
yes, the choices are quite traditional.
Irish Guiness stew, steak and kid
ney pie, smoked beef tongue, chicken
curry and chicken parmesan are all
priced at $10.95. 1 opted for poached
salmon with parsley sauce ($12.95)
and my friend had roast beef with
Yorkshire pudding ($12.95).
Our waiter, sporting a Union Jack
on his apron, was courteous. He
brought our soup and salad promptly.
My potato soup was delicate, some
thing I've never found in a usually
heavy soup. It did need spicing up,
though, but with some salt and pep
per it was tasty.
The salad was arranged nicely; a
wide, ripe slice of tomato and some
cucumbers topped the greens. Unfor
tunately, the greens weren't very
green, and the oil and vinegar dress
ing was too oily.

After dinner, they brought the des
sert cart to our table. We found it
hard to choose from among the
scones, lemon-nut cake, orange
chocolate cake, lemon pound cake,
and chocolate-on-chocolate cake (all
$2.25).
We finally chose the lemon pound
cake and chocolate-on-chocolate
cake. They were both delicious. The
lemon pound cake was moist and
lemony, and the chocolate cake was
heavenly. We also had the London
House blend coffee, which was very
good.
The London House is lovely: You
get the feeling of having visited Lon
don without even leaving Palo Alto.
Its menu is true to English cuisine, fa
mous for being somewhat bland but
wholesome and hot.
Visit the London House for lunch,
afternoon tea, or dinner; for an unus
ual gift or a beautiful sweater; or for a
leisurely afternoon of playing darts
and sipping a Bass Pale Ale, a Wat
ney's Red Barrel, or a Theakston's
Best Bitter. Even better, bring a
friend and try all three! The London
House has a lot to offer: You can
easily have a jolly good time.
