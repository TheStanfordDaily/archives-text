Hobee's Haven

Hobee's Haven is a relatively new addition to Town &
Country Village, but its Mountain View location has long
been a favorite hang-out for many Stanford students. Best
known for its coffeecake that literally melts in your
mouth, Hobee's is one of the best places in the area to get
brunch.
Among the many entrees at Hobee's are nine different
types of omelettes (all $4.50), five different ways of fixing
scrambled eggs (ranging from $2.95 to $3.50) and various
other brunch dishes. Also included on the menu are many
non-brunch offerings, including hamburgers, sandwiches,
and even a soup and salad bar.
Those familiar only with the quaint decor of the Moun
tain View branch may be in for a surprise when they walk

into Hobee's in Town & Country. The decor here is more
modern, as if the management was making a conscious ef
fort to attract the Stanford clientele.
But be reassured. Despite the modern touches, Hobee's
is still Hobee's, with the same fragrance of cinnamon and
a similar, if not quite so pervasive, aura of quaintness
radiating throughout the restaurant.
We arrived at Hobee's about 1 p m. on a Saturday, and
were informed that there would be a 30-minute wait. The
large urn of coffee that Hobee's provides for its waiting
customers made the wait much more tolerable, however.
The urn is an example of the extra touches that make
eating at Hobee's so enjoyable.
Once inside, we were seated and served within 15
minutes. We found it difficult to order, given so many ex
cellent choices, but we agreed that it was imperative to
pick'a dish accompanied by coffeecake.
My friend ordered the Fantastic ($4.50), an omelette
containing mushrooms, tomatoes, green peppers, ham
and cheese. I chose another omelette, the Mountain View
Special ($4.50), that had sausage instead of ham. All
omelettes are served with either toast or coffeecake, and
we, of course, chose the coffeecake.
We also ordered Hobee's fresh-squeezed orange juice,
which was served with a "sidecar" of fresh honeydew
(another one of those extras). The orange juice was
indeed fresh and excellent.
Having been to Hobee's several times before, we
decided that the omelettes and the coffeecake, while
good, were not up to Hobee's usual standard. However,
this was probably because we went at the end of a busy
day. And while the food may not have been quite as good
as it usually is, the omelettes were still large and the cof
feecake still melted in our mouths.
Hobee's is a great place to go on any occasion. Its spe
cial touches and its excellent food make the restaurant
one of the best brunch places around.

When 1 heard the name "The
Cookbook," I thought of a homey
little place presided over by a
grandmotherly owner. It would be
small, a little bit dark, and the food
would be wholesome and natural
(sort of like Ivory soap).
In reality The Cookbook is a
modern, clean, well-lighted place.

asparagus had been misplaced, she
replied that she wasn't sure but that
asparagus might not be in season.
Despite the mix-up, my omelette
was delicious. It was enormous, rich,
filling and altogether a fine specimen
of omelette. I would recommend it
even to the non-omelette eater.
My companion at first ordered The
Imperial Delight ($3.85), a waffle
with strawberries and whipped
cream, but unfortunately strawberries
are not in season. He drowned his
sorrows in The Gourmet ($3.75), a
waffle with vanilla ice cream,

The service did not meet the expec
tations conjured up by my imagina

but not very friendly or welcoming.
No grandmotherly types here. The
restaurant was busy early Sunday af
ternoon when I stopped by for brunch,
and an aura of bustling activity hung
over the place, giving me a feeling of
impersonality rather than of homey
ness. I think it would have helped if
my waitress had smiled more.
It is ironic that the menu reflected
all my preconceptions. The cover has

stove and wood floors; fresh
vegetables lie on the butcher block

they say in the menu, "Omelettes are
OUR Specialty." Although I am not
always the most avid omelette eater, I
felt compelled to order one. I ordered
the Solo Crab omelette ($6.95) billed
as "a mouth-watering omelette array
of crab enhanced with a touch of
onion, asparagus and an oozing por
tion of International cheese blend."
Alas, I never tasted the Crab Solo.
The waitress brought me a crab
omelette but with spinach (I later
identified it as the Crab Trap
omelette). When I asked whether

Along with our brunch we ordered
a half carafe of fresh-squeezed or

fortunately, our half carafe wasn't
squeezed from the choicest oranges
and I was glad we hadn't taken on the
responsibility of downing an entire
carafe ($5.25).
The prices were slightly high but
generally reasonable considering the
expensive items used such as crab and
other seafood. Omelettes cost be
tween $5.25 and $7.95 for the
specialties and $3.75 plus 75 cents
per extra item for the do-it-yourself
omelettes. Other brunch entrees —
traditional egg combinations,
pancakes, French toast — were be

So what is the take-home message?
All in all we did not go away un

pleasant. The Cookbook is not the
ideal brunch spot but I would go back
again. I might even bring my friends.
The Cookbook also serves lunch

We also ordered Hobee's fresh-squeezed orange juice,
which was served with a "sidecar" of fresh honeydew
(another one of those extras). The orange juice was
indeed fresh and excellent.
Having been to Hobee's several times before, we
decided that the omelettes and the coffeecake, while
good, were not up to Hobee's usual standard. However,
this was probably because we went at the end of a busy
day. And while the food may not have been quite as good
as it usually is, the omelettes were still large and the cof
feecake still melted in our mouths.
Hobee's is a great place to go on any occasion. Its spe
cial touches and its excellent food make the restaurant
one of the best brunch places around.

grandmotherly owner. It would be
small, a little bit dark, and the food
would be wholesome and natural
(sort of like Ivory soap).

modern, clean, well-lighted place.

asparagus might not be in season.
Despite the mix-up, my omelette
was delicious. It was enormous, rich,

of omelette. I would recommend it
even to the non-omelette eater.
My companion at first ordered The

No grandmotherly types here. The
restaurant was busy early Sunday af

my waitress had smiled more.

as "a mouth-watering omelette array

Alas, I never tasted the Crab Solo.
The waitress brought me a crab
omelette but with spinach (I later
identified it as the Crab Trap

The prices were slightly high but
generally reasonable considering the
expensive items used such as crab and
other seafood. Omelettes cost be

omelettes. Other brunch entrees —
traditional egg combinations,
pancakes, French toast — were be

Hobee's Haven
67 Town & Country Village
El Camino Real and Embarcadero
Palo Alto
327-4111
Hobee's Haven is a relatively new addition to Town &
Country Village, but its Mountain View location has long
been a favorite hang-out for many Stanford students. Best
known for its coffeecake that literally melts in your
mouth, Hobee's is one of the best places in the area to get
brunch.
Among the many entrees at Hobee's are nine different
types of omelettes (all $4.50), five different ways of fixing
scrambled eggs (ranging from $2.95 to $3.50) and various
other brunch dishes. Also included on the menu are many
non-brunch offerings, including hamburgers, sandwiches,
and even a soup and salad bar.
Those familiar only with the quaint decor of the Moun
tain View branch may be in for a surprise when they walk

into Hobee's in Town & Country. The decor here is more
modern, as if the management was making a conscious ef
fort to attract the Stanford clientele.
But be reassured. Despite the modern touches, Hobee's
is still Hobee's, with the same fragrance of cinnamon and
a similar, if not quite so pervasive, aura of quaintness
radiating throughout the restaurant.
We arrived at Hobee's about 1 p m. on a Saturday, and
were informed that there would be a 30-minute wait. The
large urn of coffee that Hobee's provides for its waiting
customers made the wait much more tolerable, however.
The urn is an example of the extra touches that make
eating at Hobee's so enjoyable.
Once inside, we were seated and served within 15
minutes. We found it difficult to order, given so many ex
cellent choices, but we agreed that it was imperative to
pick'a dish accompanied by coffeecake.
My friend ordered the Fantastic ($4.50), an omelette
containing mushrooms, tomatoes, green peppers, ham
and cheese. I chose another omelette, the Mountain View
Special ($4.50), that had sausage instead of ham. All
omelettes are served with either toast or coffeecake, and
we, of course, chose the coffeecake.
We also ordered Hobee's fresh-squeezed orange juice,
which was served with a "sidecar" of fresh honeydew
(another one of those extras). The orange juice was
