## Volleyball team goes for WCAA title 
### 
By VIRGINIA PEARSON

Staff sports writer
Looking for its first conference
championship, the Stanford women's
volleyball team will end WCAA play
tonight and tomorrow night with
matches at Arizona State University
and at the University of Arizona.
With a 10-2 Western Collegiate
Athletic Association record, Stanford
is one loss ahead of UCLA, San
Diego State University — both 9-3 —
and the University of Southern Cali
fornia, 8-3. A sweep of the Arizona
schools would keep the Cardinal
alone in first place in the WCAA,
Stanford's national ranking fell
three notches this week tp No. 4 fol
lowing a loss to No. 3-ranked UCLA
in the Wendy's Classic Tournament
Nov. 10 and a conference loss to No.
8-ranked San Diego State Nov. 7.
"Everyone has tr go through a
slump at some time," Cardinal Asst.
Coach Don Shaw said. "If we had to
go through one, that was the time to
do it."
Stanford will go to Arizona hoping
it can "do well in the home stretch"
and begin the National Collegiate
Athletic Association playoffs seeded
high, according to Shaw. If Stanford
wins both matches, it would be
assured of one of the top four seeds
and get a bye in the first round of the
NCAA playoffs.
The Cardinal beat Arizona State in
three games Oct. 6. In that match,
Arizona State's defense consistently
dug up Stanford's spikes, but con
trolled Cardinal passing provided the
basis for an offensive show by Stan

ford hitters Kim Oden and Bobbie
Broer that eventually overpowered
the Sun Devils' defense.
Shaw expects a better-organized
Arizona State team in this second
meeting. "Arizona State has a lot of
young freshman players who weren't
as experienced (earlier this season).
Now they should be a lot better,
having played together. They'll also
be playing at home — that can make
a big difference."
According to Shaw, Arizona State
is "kept going" by setter Regina
Stahl, a freshman from Norwalk who
is a "very quick player" not only in
her setting but in her defense.
When the Sun Devils are "on" they
block well, Shaw said. Tammy
Webster, a 5-foot-11 sophomore, is
Arizona State's leading middle
blocker and will take on Oden and
Broer at the net.
Arizona, which is 13-9 overall and
5-6 in the WCAA, is ranked 17th in
the nation in the NCAA poll this
week.
The Cardinal also beat the
Wildcats in three games in the teams'
first meeting. In that match, however,
Arizona was unable to play middle
blocker Melissa McLinden, a second
team All-WCAA selection last year.
"Arizona goes to [McLinden] quite
a lot," Shaw said. "She rushes the
middle attack (hitting low, quick sets)
but can also hit a high ball in the
middle during a long rally."
Stanford Head Coach Fred Sturm
said McLinden's presence will be felt
during the match, but the Cardinal is
not going to concentrate on stopping

only her.
"We're not going out to hold
McLinden and Caren Kemner
(another Arizona middle blocker).
We've got to watch all six players at
all times."
Broer said,"Arizona is a pretty
scrappy team. They dig a lot of balls,
and we'll try to not get frustrated."
Sturm would like to see the Card

inal win both matches and the confer
ence championship. "We've had a
great season. This group deserves to
win the conference. . . • The bottom
line is that [the WCAA] is the na
tion's toughest [conference], and to
have only two losses is quite impres
sive to me. We're in the position to
decide our own destiny. The players
know it, too."
