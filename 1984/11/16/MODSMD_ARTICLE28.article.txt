# Quiet leader Broer 'glue of the team'
## 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
Bobbie Broer's sport was tennis,
not volleyball. She was the No. 2
singles player her sophomore year
at Palm Springs High School and a
No. 1 doubles player as a junior,
being voted the team's most
valuable player both years.
There was something about vol
leyball, though, that caught her at
tention during her senior year, and
that curiosity has gone a long way.
Such a long way, in fact, that
Broer is now a starting middle
blocker opposite Kim Oden for
the Stanford women's volleyball
team, the No. 4-ranked team in
the nation.
The transition from tennis to
volleyball was not a simple one.
Broer's rise to a starting position

for the Cardinal has been a prod
uct of many decisions, starting
with the one to stop playing tennis.
As a senior in high school,
Broer decided to "throw" herself
into volleyball since it was her
"last chance to play something dif
ferent."
"I was happy with my tennis
playing and I figured 1 could al
ways go back to it," she said.
"Volleyball just seemed to be a
new challenge."
Broer met the challenge well,
starting and being voted most
valuable player on a team that
made it to the third-round of the
Division 3A California Inter
s holastic Federation champion
ships. At the end of that season.
her coach contacted John Bekins,
then a Stanford assistant coach.
"At our sports banquet, my coach
came up to me and asked me if I
wanted to play volleyball along with
studying at Stanford. I thought it
sounded kind of fun," Broer said.
Stanford Head Coach Fred Sturm
said, "When Bobbie's coach talked to
me, he said, 'Look, I have this player
with unbelievable potential, and she
seems really interested in playing for
Stanford.' He followed that up with a
letter and a picture of her blocking."
Sturm called Broer after receiving
the photo. "He just asked me a few
routine questions," Broer said. "He
wanted to know if I was a middle
blocker, and I didn't know what a
middle blocker was."
"The pictures 1 got were quite im
pressive," Sturm said. "I could tell
she had a good jump. I had a hunch
she was a diamond in the rough."
Broer, who stands 6-feet tall, es
timates her vertical jump at 26
inches. It's a "mediocre" jump at the
collegiate level, she said, but for high
school it was a little unusual.
Broer soon learned what a middle
blocker was. "I came in as a walk
on. ... I had done some conditioning
over the summer, but at our very first
practice we just ran. I was ready to
die."
The conditioning wasn't too in
timidating, but an often-pulled leg
muscle forced her to redshirt her
freshman season. "It was a pretty
clear decision," she said. "I needed
more individual help."
Sturm said, "At first she was a bit
out of control at the net. The biggest
fear was 'Here comes Bobbie.'
Whenever there was a collision at the

net, Bobbie came out on her feet, but
the outside player was always flat on
her butt."
Broer improved her technique,
however, by working on a quicker
arm swing and footwork. By her
sophomore year, she was starting as a
middle blocker for Stanford and she
played a full season before deciding
not to play as a junior.
"It was a great disappointment for
us (when Broer decided not to play),"
Sturm said. "If she had played, we
could have won the NCAA (National
Collegiate Athletic Association)
championship. That was how impor
tant she was to the team that season.
She was irreplacable."
Broer said she thought she needed
to give more attention to academics.
"I found myself thinking about my
studies while I was on the court, and
thinking about volleyball when I was
studying. I just needed to step away
— and I didn't plan on coming back."
But she returned for her senior
season and eventually chose to play
as a fifth-year senior this season.
"The fact that she came back was
great," Asst. Coach Don Shaw said.
"It's easy to forget, but she came
back and worked hard, too, pairing
up with Kim (Oden) in the off
season."
Broer said, "Kim and I really
worked on becoming sophisticated
blockers. We tried to improve the
way we read the hitters, to [gain]
more savvy in anticipating where they
are going with the ball."
Although Broer said she feels she
never has been in competition with
Oden, an All-American, she said
both middle blockers improved
during the off-season by making each
other "play [her] best."
"When you play against someone
like Kim, you just get better through
experience. There really isn't any
competition involved."
Broer has been a unifying factor on

this season's team. "She's the
backbone of the team, but in a very,
very subtle way," Sturm said. "There
is no replacement for the leadership
of Kari Rush (co-captain with Julie
Baker on last season's team). Bobbie
leads through example but,
moreover, her genuineness ... is the
glue of the team — she is such a
caring person and very perceptive."
Shaw said, "She's a co-captain, but
her leadership is more off than on the
court. If the players have any prob
lems, they'll often go to her."
Senior hitter Susan Compton
agreed. "Her improvement over the
years has given us some encourage
ment and incentive," Compton said.
Senior miudle blocker Lisa Murphy
said Broer is a steadying factor.
"Bobbie is a real stable, strong
player. Her influence is more of a
quiet one. She isn't the type to jump
up and down — she leads by action
rather than talking."
Broer said she is not quite willing
to take the attention received by
Oden, Stanford's offensive leader.
"The attention sometimes puts a lot
of added pressure on you. I know
Kim plays with a lot of it, but I put
enough pressure on myself. 1 don't
need any more."
Broer also said she feels it would be
difficult for her to be a leader on the
court."It takes so much for one per
son to be a leader," she said. "I saw
that with Kari Rush."
For Broer, a sociology major, vol
leyball has been "a part of my life and
the Stanford experience that I could
never have missed." Sports for her
have been "a different type of chal
lenge ... to control the body and
mind and put it all together."
What distinguishes Broer from her
peers, Sturm said, "is that she is
clearly the most improved player
we've ever had in the program."
Broer said, "I've always been a
little behind. It has kept the challenge
at its premium."
