# Quiet leader Broer 'glue of the team'
## 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
Bobbie Broer's sport was tennis,
not volleyball. She was the No. 2
singles player her sophomore year
at Palm Springs High School and a
No. 1 doubles player as a junior,
being voted the team's most
valuable player both years.
There was something about vol
leyball, though, that caught her at
tention during her senior year, and
that curiosity has gone a long way.
Such a long way, in fact, that
Broer is now a starting middle
blocker opposite Kim Oden for
the Stanford women's volleyball
team, the No. 4-ranked team in
the nation.
The transition from tennis to
volleyball was not a simple one.
Broer's rise to a starting position

for the Cardinal has been a prod
uct of many decisions, starting
with the one to stop playing tennis.
As a senior in high school,
Broer decided to "throw" herself
into volleyball since it was her
"last chance to play something dif
ferent."
"I was happy with my tennis
playing and I figured 1 could al
ways go back to it," she said.
"Volleyball just seemed to be a
new challenge."
Broer met the challenge well,
starting and being voted most
valuable player on a team that
made it to the third-round of the
Division 3A California Inter
s holastic Federation champion
ships. At the end of that season.
