# Water polo team to play UOP, second-ranked Cal
##

Staff sportswriter
The Stanford water polo team will play the University
of the Pacific and the University of Calilornia at Berkeley
this weekend in its last two games of the regular season.
The Cardinal will play UOP today at 3 p.m. in
DeGuerre Pool and will travel to Berkeley tomorrow for a
10:30 a.m. match.
Stanford, ranked first in the nation by a National Col
legiate Athletic Association poll, defeated UOP earlier
this season. But according to Stanford Coach Dante Det
tamanti, the ninth-ranked Tigers are not a team to be un
derestimated.
"Pacific has some top-notch players, namely Mike
Haley and Carl Gunn. and the team has the ability to play
some very good water polo," Dettamanti said. They
don't have a lot of depth past their starting lineup, but
they have some fine outside shooting that we are going to
have to stop."
Today's match will be the last game in DeGuerre Pool
for the Cardinal's four seniors — Mark Daley, Steve
Moyer, Grant Hasson and Marc Gleichert. According to
Daley, that fact makes today's game especially important.
"Today's game means a lot to me. I have been playing
in this pool for the past eight years and they have been the
best eight years of my life," Daley said. "This year's team

is so super, I can't even express how thrilled I am be a part
of it. Right now, I feel so great about the team and our ac
complishments that I can't even start to think any sad
thoughts about ending my college career."
Moyer feels much the same way about his upcoming
"retirement" from college water polo.
"1 never really thought this last home game would
come, but it did, and 1 feel pretty strange about it," Moyer
said. "I am trying to concentrate on this weekend's games
and the NCAAs, but playing for the last time in our home
pool is a thought that is hard to put our of your mind."
According to Dettamanti, Stanford will have to be con
centrating on the game tomorrow if it wants to leave
Berkeley with a victory.
"Berkeley is the No. 2 team in the nation, and no
one gets a ranking like that without earning it," Detta
manti said. "We defeated the Bears last weekend by one
goal (11-10), and they are certainly going to be looking
for revenge. It is going to take a lot to beat them.
Dettamanti said Cal will be more aware of Stanford s
defense after last weekend's match, so the Cardinal will
adjust its defense some for tomorrow's game.
"We have to go over to Cal and prove that last
weekend's victory wasn't any fluke and that we do deserve
our No. 1 ranking," Dettamanti said. "We not only have
to do it, we will do it."
