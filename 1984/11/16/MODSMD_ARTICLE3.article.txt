# Former STARTS director gets Row job
## 
### BAIE NETZER Senior staff writer 
Keith Archuleta, former program coordin
ator at Tresidder Union, will replace Jim
Cadena late this month as the Office of Resi
dential Education's assistant director of the
Row, the dean of student affairs announced
Wednesday.
Cadena, who formerly held the full-time
position, will continue as director of Gover
nor's Corner, a job he has held since the
beginning of the year.
The Office of Student Affairs has hired Ar
chuleta to fill the now half-time position of as
sistant director of the Row and has created a
new full-time position for a fraternal affairs
adviser to work with fraternities, sororities
and the Inter-Fraternity Council.
Archuleta, who has served as Mirrielees'

resident fellow for the past three years, said
he went through an intensive application
process before finding out about his appoint
ment on Wednesday.
"I'm really excited about it,"he said. "I
think it'll be a real challenge just because I'll
be working with such a wide variety of
houses."
Because of the new search for a fraternal
affairs adviser, the assistant director of the
Row will no longer be in charge of all frater
nity affairs. Archuleta said his main task will
be to train house managers in fraternities,
Row houses and houses in Cowell Cluster to
manage their houses effectively.
"I'll take care of the administrative respon
sibility first, but I'd also like to begin some
educational programs," he said.
Norm Robinson, associate dean of resi-

dential education, said the fraternal affairs
adviser post was created "because the frater
nity situation at Stanford has changed over
the past few years."
Robinson noted that the existence of
sororities and of both residential and non
residential fraternities determined the need
for a fraternal affairs adviser.
"We just realize that a non-residential fra
ternity is likely to have different needs and
concerns than a housed fraternity," Robinson
said. "When vou take all the affairs relating to
fraternities and sororities and add them up, it
ends up being very time-consuming."
Robinson said he hopes to have the new
J fraternal affairs adviser sometime during win
ter quarter. The Office of Student Affairs has
published a three-page job description for all
those interested in the position.

The description lists various responsibilities
for the fraternal affairs adviser, including
advising the Inter-Fraternity and Inter-
Sorority Councils and acting as a liaison be
tween fraternal groups and University depart
ments.
The description also mentions reactions to
the 1984-85 report by the Task Force on Fra
ternities and Sororities, which recommends
that fraternities lose access to University
housing after three years. This will "involve
the adviser in meetings with the dean, mem
bers of his staff and the leaders of fraternal
organizations," the decription says.
According to Robinson, the fraternal af
fairs adviser will also be responsible for
policies and advice relating to University
recognition, University funding and the Rush
and pledging processes.

Cadena, the former assistant director of the
Row, said he will probably continue to work
with fraternities until a fraternal affairs ad
viser is hired.
Director of the Row Diana Conklin
"will still be working with the fraternities, so
I'll be assisting on those matters until the new
position is filled," he said.
The job description for the new fraternal
adviser also lists affiliation with a fraternity or
sorority as a qualification.
According to the description, a primary
goal for the new adviser will be "to develop
effective bridges of communication and un
derstanding among University officers and
fraternity and sorority members and alumni."
There are currently about 1,200 under
graduates belonging to one of 26 fraternities
and sororities.
