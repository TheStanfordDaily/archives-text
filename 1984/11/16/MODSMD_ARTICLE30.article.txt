## Cardinal begins regular season tomorrow 
### DAVE DUTCHER Daily staff 
The Stanford women's basketball
team will open its regular season to
morrow night in Berkeley against the
University of California at Berkeley
â€” even though the Cardinal already
has won a game.
Stanford's season began Monday
night at Maples Pavilion with a 75-68
exhibition victory over the Kolon
team of South Korea. Despite the
youth of the season and the fact that
the Cardinal played an exhibition
game, Coach Dotty McCrea was
pleased with what her team showed
her.
"It was a great game because we
came from behind," she said. "The
freshmen played well and we showed
great poise for this time of year."
McCrea was also happy with the

Card's balanced scoring, saying Stan
ford "needs that this year."
Against Cal, McCrea said she is
concerned about the Bears' large
front line, which she said includes a 6-
foot-6 and a 6-4 player. The Card
inal's forwards are 6-0 senior Mary
Bradach, who led Stanford with 21
points Monday night, and 6-2 sopho
more Karen Goedewaagen. The
Cardinal's starting center is 6-1 soph
omore Kim Mercer.
"Their front line is huge," McCrea
said. "Compared to them, we're
small."
However, McCrea said she hopes
to use her reserve players to an ad
vantage, especially at the forward po
sition.
"The players off the bench have to
play well," she said. "We have so
much more flexibility (than last

season). We've got forwards who can
handle the ball. We might want to put
in a big lineup or we might want to
use a quicker lineup."
Cal's guards, however, might be in
experienced. McCrea said the Bears
"lost their backcourt from last
season." Stanford's starting back
court consists of juniors Virginia
Sourlis and Judy Griffith.
McCrea said the Cardinal has two
"main things" to accomplish to defeat
Cal.
"We have to control the tempo,"
she said. "We want to slow them
down. We also have to outrebound
them."
Experience could be a key for
Stanford . "We're so much more
rounded (than last season)," McCrea
said. "Everyone's a year older."
