# Men swimmers, divers defeat Bears by 20 in 'practice meet' that counts
## 
### INGRID SEYER Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford men's swimming and diving team
defeated the University of California at Berkeley,
40-20, yesterday at DeGuerre Pool.
Although the meet was official, Stanford swim
coach Skip Kenney referred to the meet as a
"practice meet" that gave the teams a chance to
warm up for the rest of the season.
"We started this meet three years ago to start the
guys swimming faster earlier in the season and to
take advantage of the Stanford-Cal rivalry that

goes on at this time of the year," Kenney said.
"This meet really gets the team psyched for the rest
of the season."
The events in the meet were not the normal
events for an intercollegiate swim meet, but were
designed instead to stress endurance and sprint
swimming. Among the events scheduled were a
600-meter individual medley and a 1,250-yard
freestyle relay involving 10 swimmers from each
team.
Kenney said he was pleased with the Cardinal's
performance in yesterday's meet, especially since

the swimmers' times in the meet were better than
those in the same meet last year.
In the diving competion, Cal had no entrants and
Stanford won the 1- and 3-meter competitions.
However, Stanford Coach Rich Shavone was not
happy with his team's victory.
"I am not very happy with the way the men dove
today," Shavone said. "I thought they were diving
lazily and were not really putting an effort into all
of their dives. They were going through the me
chanics of each dive, but they were never really fol
lowing each dive to its finish."
