# Men, women looking for 2nd victory
## Fencing teams to face UC-Santa Cruz 
### JASON COLE Daily staff 
Stanford Fencing Coach Buzz Hurst is confident his
men's and women's teams will win today at the University
of California at Santa Cruz, hut he's not quite sure what to
expect.
The Cardinal men and women, who opened the season
with victories over the University of San Francisco and
San Francisco State, will he facing Santa Cruz teams
playing their season-opening matches.
"I never take them for granted," Hurst said. "They
caught us (the men's team) by surprise and got us off bal
ance. but we were able to get under control." The Stan
lord men defeated Santa Cruz last season. 15-12, and won

a rematch, 17-10, later last year.
The problem with facing Santa Cruz, according to
Hurst, is that its teams do not compete at the varsity level
but instead compete as club sports (Santa Cruz is not a
member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association).
As a result, its eligibility rules are more relaxed.
Because eligibility rules are different, "Once in a while
you'll run into a club team that has a graduate student
who's a former NCAA champion," Hurst said. Nonethe
less, Hurst expects a victory. "Unless somebody falls
asleep, we shouldn't have too much trouble," he said.
The Cardinal will be led by seniors Chris McConnell
and Craig Miott and junior Elliot Cheu, who were each 3-
0 against USF in the epee, sabre and foil, respectively.

Junior Andy Goorno and freshman Chris Gillen each
were 2-0 in the sabre and foil, respectively.
The Stanford men defeated USF, 19-8. But, according
to Hurst, that score might be closer than the match actu
ally was. "We were winning by enough that 1 could afford
to bring in some of the new people who don't usually play.
That created some mismatches (that USF was able to
win)," he said.
Last season, the women's team had little trouble
beating Santa Cruz in two matches played. The Cardinal
won, 15-1, in both matches. Hurst said he expects the
same result this time.
Stanford defeated San Francisco State, 9-7, but again
Hurst said the score was deceivingly close. "Since you can

only score a certain amount of points (16), once you get to
nine it's over. . . . We got to nine very quickly, and then
they won a few," he said.
The Cardinal women were led by sophomores Holly
Taylor and Meagan Levitan, who were 3-1 each. Stanford
also competed without its leading performer, junior Jenn
ifer Yu, who will return for the Cardinal's match against
Santa Cruz.
Yu was in Dallas for a tournament that helps determine
who earns berths on the national team. She placed 14th in
the tournament and will have to work her way into the top
five to make the team. "She's got a good chance, but she'll
have to work," Hurst said.
Today's matches will begin at 4 p.m.

Bobbie Broer (14) quit the Stanford volleyball team after two seasons, but came back. Head Coach Fred
Sturm said this year Broer has been"the backbone of the team, but in a very, very subtle way."
