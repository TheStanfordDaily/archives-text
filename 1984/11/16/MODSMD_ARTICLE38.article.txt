# Student to fly toward world title

### VALERIE CRITES 
Siaff writer
Phil and Steve Mahre, Bill Johnson, Cindy Nelson, Debbie
Armstrong. These skiers have received widespread acclaim for
their World Cup success.
Maria Quintana is unlikely to ever grace the cover of Sports Il
lustrated, but Quintana, a freshman from Steamboat Springs
Colo., could win a World Cup skiing title in the near future
The difference in recognition between the names above results
from the relative obscurity in this country of Quintana's World
Cup event — aerial freestyle skiing. A member of the U.S
freestyle team, Quintana was ninth in the World Cup standings
last year and is aiming for a finish in the top three this winter.
When the rest of us return to Stanford for winter quarter
Quintana already will be immersed in World Cup competitions in
Europe. She is hoping tor a repeat of her good start on last year's
circuit — after the first four competitions, she held the top posi
tion on the World Cup charts. Then trouble hit.
"I had two weeks off in France, when 1 hurt my knee practic
ing," Quintana said. "I tore three ligaments and was in a cast for
six weeks. After I got hurt, I missed the last five competitions, so
I got no more points for the standings over the last half of the
season." Quintana finished World Cup competition as the top
American in her event, but looks to the future with higher expec

tations.
"I think my knee is about as strong as the other one now,"
Quintana said. "Skiing is my favorite thing to do, and I want to
continue for at least a few more years. Aerial acrobatics will be a
demonstration sport in the 1988 Calgary Olympics, and I
definitely want to be in that."
Quintana hopes that following the Calgary Winter Olympics,
freestyle skiing will catch on in the United States as it has in
Europe. "About 2,000 people watch some of our competitions in
Europe, but not in the U. 5.," Quintana said. "In Italy, we get
down to the bottom of the hill, and all the little kids run up and
ask for your autograph. It's a weird feeling."
Quintana is known on the circuit for the difficulty of her tricks.
In competition, each jumper does two tricks. Last year, Quintana
chose from among a backflip, backflip with full twist, and double
backflip. She was the only female on the tour performing the
double, and hopes to add a full twist to the trick for next year.
Quintana started skiing at the age of five in Santa Fe, N. M.
She tried racing when she was eight, but didn't like it enough to
continue. She started freestyle competition in the 10th grade
after moving to Steamboat Springs.
Concentration is crucial for aerial acrobatics, Quintana said.
"When I concentrate really hard on what I am going to do, by
making a mental picture in my head, it blocks out the fear. I con

centrate so hard it seems like I'm not scared, even though I
really am.
"Jumping is a whole different kind of feeling, it's really neat.
When you're upside down looking down at the hill, it just seems
so weird," Quintana said.
It is a long process before a skier can attempt the first flip. The
trick must be perfected on the trampoline and then off a ski jump
into water. Only when consistency has been established in the
latter stage is the jumper qualified to perform the trick on snow
and in competition. Quintana had done "hundreds" of water
jumps before she tried her first flip onto snow, an experience she
called "really scary."
Quintana likes the lifestyle and the challenges posed by travel
ing on the World Cup circuit. Her itinerary this year will take her
to Yugoslavia, Sweden, Italy and most of the central European
countries during the winter months. Meanwhile, most Stanford
students will be turning in problem sets and writing papers.
"I think the travel is another whole education in itself," Quin
tana said. "We learn how to be self-sufficient, how to get around
and to get things done when we are alone. We must find ways to
communicate even when we don't know the language. The prob
lems I encounter don't inhibit me. It's another challenge to
meet."
