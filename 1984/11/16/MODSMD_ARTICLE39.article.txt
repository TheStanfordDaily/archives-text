# James coaches from afar-and wins

### 
SEATTLE — It is late afternoon, and the sun
is wearing a costume — a thick, dark cloud.
Welcome to another gray day in the gray North
west.
Inside Husky Stadium, on the chilly shores of
Portage Bay, the Washington Huskies are
finishing practice.
"Where's Coach James?" an observer asks.
"Up there . . . where he always is."
It's a good thing Don James is only 5-foot-10
and 160 pounds. Another inch or two horizon

tally or vertically and he wouldn't fit in The
Tower.
"I'll never forget when I was a freshman and
sophomore," Huskies split end Mark Pattison
said. "I was so intimidated by that tower. It's
like God looking down over your shoulder."
Don James isn't really like God. No, he's
more like . . . well, "like Lee lacocca," Pattison
said.
"He's more like the chairman of the board
than the coach," defensive coordinator Jim
Lambright said. "He coaches the coaches more
than the players. He's an assistant coaches' head

coach."
Incredible as it might seem, when it comes to
the spoken word, James figures he deals directly
with his team a total of about 10-15 minutes a
week. "Maybe a minute or two at halftime,
three or four minutes after the game, and a little
while on Thursday," James said.
There is a philosophy at work here. This is
corporate management with whistles and sweat
pants instead of briefcases and three-piece suits.
In James' system, derived from 12 years of
being an assistant coach — the assistant coaches

do the teaching, motivating and yelling.
"I think it has to be like that," James said.
"When I was an assistant coach, it was always
embarrassing when the head coach had to step
in and coach. My assistants have to get respect if
they're going to do the job. It's up to me to
oversee everything and make the decisions.
"A lot of our players are pretty even (in abil
ity). In the end, somebody has to make the deci
sion who'll play. That's why 1 use The Tower. I
can see why plays didn't go. I'm always taking
notes."
