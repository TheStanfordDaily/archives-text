# Lawsuit to 'nonsuit'
## Court puts an end to five-year case 
### 
A five-year lawsuit between a
Stanford physician and the University
came to an end Wednesday in the Su
perior Court of Santa Clara County.
Eugene Dong, associate professor
of cardiovascular surgery, had filed a
suit against the University trustees,
three University officials and Zoltan
Lucas, a former faculty member at
Stanford Medical School. Dong was
asking for more than $ 1 million in da
mages from Stanford, and $100,000
each from the University's general
counsel, the former dean of the medi
cal school and the former acting
chairman of the school's Department
of Surgery.
In pre-trial motions heard Wednes
day, Stanford asked that the con
fidential reports of faculty investiga
tions of Lucas, discussions between

the University and National Institutes
of Health personnel about investiga
tions relating to Lucas' grants, and as
sociated material be excluded from
evidence.
The Court of Appeal had held in
1981 that documents relating to
Lucas' research were protected from
discovery in this lawsuit by the Cali
fornia constitutional right to privacy.
The University argued that material
Dong was planning to introduce was
privileged and not directly relevant to
Dong's case.
Judge John Flaherty granted Stan
ford's requests to limit the scope of
the evidence. He also granted Lucas'
motion to exclude a letter Lucas had
written, on the basis that it was an ex
pression of opinion and not fact.
As a result of the rulings, Dong

advised the court that he would be
unable to prove any of his causes of
action, and asked that a "nonsuit" be
entered, terminating the case at the
trial court level.
Stanford's attorney argued that
Dong had no case against the Univer
sity whether the evidence was admis
sible or not, and agreed with the re
quest for a nonsuit, which was
granted by the judge.
Dong has the right to appeal the
court's ruling.
The suit involved Dong's claim that
he had been professionally damaged
because of his "whistle-blowing" in
the mid-1970s against Lucas, then an
associate professor in the school of
medicine here.
In March 1978, University Presi
dent Richard Lyman officially
reprimanded Lucas and suspended
him for 12 weeks without pay for pro
fessional misconduct in his research
work. At that time, Lucas admitted
that 18 citations of his scientific
papers were in error between 1966
and 1977.
Lucas took a leave of absence from
the University in 1981 and did not
come back. He resigned in April
1983.

Dong claimed that University offi
cials tried to cover up Lucas'
wrongdoings, rather than thoroughly
investigate the charges against Lucas.
Dong also alleged that his whistle
blowing is the reason why he has been
denied promotion to full professor
and why he has not been receiving
adequate pay raises. He alleged that
this was a breach of his contract with
the University.
In his suit, Dong also raised claims
of defamation by Lucas and by Stan
ford, claimed that he had been put in
a "false light" and said he had been
the victim of both negligent and in
tentional infliction of emotional
distress.
