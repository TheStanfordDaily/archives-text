# The 						Ink Bowl
## Be there... or don't.

What is all this? . .
At 10:30 a.m. tomorrow, The Stanford Daily will begin i
glorious victory over the nattering nabobs of newsprint at
The Daily Californian. The coveted Exacto Axe is up tor
grabs on the astroturf of Berkeley tomorrow. This is serious
stuff.
Who can play?
All Daily staffers, both of the editorial and business varie y,
are begged to help in the war effort.
How do I get there? ,
From Highway 17 north, take the University exit towardthe
University of California. At Shattuck turn right. Follow tnat
to Channing, and then turn left. Follow that to College (one
or two blocks past Telegraph). When you get to
you should see the astroturf and the throngs awaiting e
Daily's triumph.
What if I'm already in San Fransisco?
A Daily caravan will leave from the corner of Lombard and
Franklin (in front of the Rancho Lombard Motel) at 9-45
a.m. We hope to have enough cars to take everyone wo
shows. If you have a car with any empty seats, stop by and
help out.
What do I wear?
If you ordered a Daily T-shirt, you will be able to pick it up
at the office sometime today, we hope. Call ahead to make
sure. Bring a check for $4 for short sleeves, $4.50 for long
sleeves. Because the game will be played on an artificial
surface, you will want to wear clothing that will protect your
knees and elbows.
Anything else?
Not that we can think of at the moment. If you still have
questions, call The Daily. And if you get to that other game
before the rest of us, do save us some seats.


It's more than a game. It's a football game.
