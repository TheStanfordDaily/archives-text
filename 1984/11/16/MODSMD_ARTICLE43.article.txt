Top Hat (1935)
Festival, Palo Alto
329-1848
Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers dance
to one of the four or five best film scores
ever written. The Irving Berlin songs in
clude "No Strings (Fancy Free)," "Isn't
It a Lovely Day (to Be Caught in the
Rain)?," "Top Hat, White Tie and
Tails," "Cheek to Cheek" and"The Pic
colino" — there isn't a bad apple in the
bunch, or an unmemorable dance. Fred
plays an American entertainer in Lon
don who falls in love with Ginger and
follows her to Venice, where she wears
her celebrated satin-and-feathers ball
room gown for their "Cheek to Cheek"
pas de deux. In "Isn't It a Lovely Day?,"
they dance in a gazebo as rain falls all
around them, and in the inventive title
number Astaire leads a crew of men in
formal dress in a dance that turns on it
self at the end, when he uses his cane as a
tommy gun and mows the whole chorus
down. ("Pennies from Heaven" includes
an hommage to this moment.) Mark
Sandrich directed a script by Dwight
Taylor and Allan Scott — probably the
best script Astaire and Rogers were ever
given; the supporting cast features Ed
ward Everett Horton, Helen Broderick,
Eric Blore and Erik Rhodes (with a
walk-on by Lucille Ball).
Begins Thursday with "Swing Time."
Swing Time (1936)
Festival, Palo Alto
Perhaps the best of all the Astaire-
Rogers musicals, though the script (by
Howard Lindsay and Allan Scott) sags a
little. This time Fred is a famous dancer
who pretends to have two left feet so that
he can take lessons from Rogers, a dance
instructor at Eric Blore's school. The
magnificent songs (by Jerome Kern and
Dorothy Fields) are, in several cases,
more dramatically integrated than in
most of the series, and one triumphant
number follows another: "Pick Yourself
Up," "The Way You Look Tonight"
(which Fred sings to Ginger from an ad
joining room as she washes her hair),
"Waltz in Swing Time," "A Fine
Romance" (the duet in the snow),
"Bojangles of Harlem" (Astaire's trib
ute to Bill "Bojangles" Robinson), and
best of all the pas de deux on the twin
stairways, "Never Gonna Dance." ("The
Way You Look Tonight" took the Oscar
for Best Song.) George Stevens directed;
with Victor Moore in the Edward
Everett Horton part, Georges Metaxa in
the Erik Rhodes part, and Helen
Broderick in the Helen Broderick part.
Begins Thursday with "Top Hat."
It's a Wonderful Life (1946)
Kresge Auditorium
James Stewart plays a small-town joe
who has spent years putting other
people's interests before his own; when
his life begins to fall apart and he con
templates suicide, an angel (Henry
Travers) shows him what life would have
been like for those closest to him had he
never existed. This comedy-drama is the
most eloquent expression of the populist
philosophy Frank Capra infused his films
with. It's superbly crafted, and two or
three scenes are too powerful to shake
off — Capra could be an amazing direc
tor, and he knew exactly what he was
doing here. But his vision is so
fraudulent that your tears may freeze
into outrage when you consider the ef
fect of the movie. Much of the film's suc
cess as a piece of manipulation is due to
Stewart, whose earnestness has never
been affecting in quite this way before;
his intensity is frightening— in the scene
in which he cries out to his girl, Donna
Reed (who is very good), that he feels
trapped in the town, you can really see
the potential for nervous collapse and
suicide. The supporting cast includes the
unconvincing Lionel Barrymore,
Thomas Mitchell, Beulah Bondi, Frank
Faylen, Ward Bond, Gloria Grahame,
H.B.Warner and Frank Albertson.
Capra worked on the script with Frances
Goodrich and Albert Hackett, and
Joseph Walker and Joseph Biroc col
laborated on the (fine) cinematography.
Plays tonight at 9.
Footloose (1984)
Memorial Auditorium
A transplanted big city boy (the as
tonishingly charismatic Kevin Bacon)
struggles to reinstate dancing in a small
Midwestern town that has outlawed it.
Herbert Ross' musical, written by Dean
Pitchford, is an attempt to parallel the
low-budget rock n' roll movies of the
19505, relying on '50s revivalism in
music and clothing, but it takes itself
seriously, and that point of view wrecks a
tantalizing idea. The movie gets worse
(and more sentimental) as it goes on, but
there are talented people all along the
way to recommend it, especially Chris
topher Penn and Dianne Wiest, and
there's one ingenious number, Let s
Hear It for the Boy," in which Bacon
teaches Penn how to dance. With John
Lithgow as the anti-rock preacher and
Lori Singer as his self-destructive
daughter.
Plays Sunday, Nov. 25, at 7 and 9 p.m.
The Virgin Spring (1960)
Cubberley Auditorium
In 14th-century Sweden, a vain,
spoiled but beautiful young woman
(Birgitta Petersson) sets out to church
with her contemptuous, lusty maid
(Gunnel Lindblom); she is raped and
murdered before she can reach her des
tination. Austere and heavy-handed as
this scene is, its brutality has the in
tended emotional effect; whatever your
quarrel may be with this lngmar
Bergman film, which strains to be myt
hic, it's undeniably beautiful and affect
ing. If only he would lei up occasionally!
Max von Sydow, who gives a fine perfor
mance as the father who takes revenge
on his child's killers, speaks what must
have been the most peculiar line of
1960: "Heat the stones in the bath
house; I'll get the birch whisks." With

Birgitta Valberg as his self-punishing
wife, Axel Duberg, Tor Isedal, Allan
Edwall and Gudrun Brost; Sven Nykvist
photographed. The contrasting views of
Christianity in the opening scenes recall
Carl Dreyer's "Ordet," and the relation
ship between the daughter and the preg
nant maid is a variation on the scenes
between the virgin-wife and her servant
in Bergman's "Smiles of a Summer
Night."
Plays Tuesday, Nov. 27, at 8 p.m.
Richard III(1956)
Bijou, Palo Alto
326-6196
Sporting a nose so protruberant it's
practically a piece of expressionism, and
thrusting his neck out so that he looks
shockingly like a misshapen tree,
Laurence Olivier gives the wittiest
Shakespearean performance on film —
perhaps on record — as Richard 111, the
"princely heap," the most entertaining
vice figure in Renaissance drama.
Olivier's Richard is a series of inspired
flourishes. When he asks Lady Anne
(Claire Bloom) to bed over the coffin of
her husband, whom he murderered, and
she spits in his face, he hangs close to her
and continues to woo her, as if she'd be
stowed a kiss on his cheek. And when he
gets the crown of England with the aid of
his cohort, Buckingham (Ralph Richard
son), who kneels to kiss his hand, this
Richard hands him the withered one —
and makes him grovel for it. Olivier has
surrounded himself with a first-rate sup
porting cast, but despite the commen
dable performances of Richardson, John
Gielgud (as Clarence), Alec Clunes
(Hastings), Stanley Baker and others, he
dominates every scene he's in, and when
he's off screen the movie seems to lose
its energy. Olivier himself, as director,
may be responsible for the unevenness:
He keeps the other performers at bay,
often in long shot, so the film comes
across as a little too elegantly remote.
William Walton composed the score,
which is all crescendo. (It doesn't come
close to the spirited music he provided
for "Henry V.")
Plays Monday, Nov. 21, with "Henry
V."
Henry V(1944)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Laurence Olivier's directorial debut
film begins as a play-within-a-movie, a
production of "Henry V" as an audience
at the Globe Theatre might have seen it,
and gradually, magically, it passes from
filmed theatre into cinema. Though far
from Shakespeare's best history, "Henry
V" is certainly the most cinematic, and
perhaps none of his other plays has
received such imaginative treatment on
the screen. (It's also his most controver
sial: In the 1960s and early '70s, direc
tors like Terry Hands of the Royal
Shakespeare Company interpreted it as a
scathing attack on the corruption and
cynicism of men in power, while Olivier's
version, commissioned by the British
government as a piece of wartime
propaganda, is rousingly patriotic.)
Olivier, looking surpassingly handsome,
gives a supciMy heroic reading of the
role of the young king. The cast also in
cludes Robert Newton, Leslie Banks,
Renee Asherson, Esmond Knight, Leo
Genn, Felix Aylmer and Ernest
Thesiger. William Walton wrote the
justly famous music.
Plays Monday, Nov. 21, with"Richard
III."
The Garden of the Finzi-Continis
(1970)
Bijou, Palo Alto
The Finzi-Continis represent the
Jewish aristocracy in pre-war Ferrara;
this movie, adapted by Giorgio Bassani
and Vittorio De Sica from Bassani's
semi-autobiographical novel, shows us
the last gasps of that aristocracy, before
Mussolini snuffed it out. Muted yet vivid
— images whirl through your head years
after you think you've forgotten the film
— this picture marked a comeback for
De Sica, whose films after his neo-realist
masterpieces had been disappointments.
It was a triumph, but his last; he was
dead by 1974. Dominique Sanda (whose
beauty is other-worldly) and Helmut
Berger play the Finzi-Continis, and Lino
Capolicchio plays the Bassani part.
Plays Wednesday, Nov. 28, with "The
Bicycle Thief."
If. . .(1969)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
323-6411
Lindsay Anderson's film about the
revolt of students in a British boarding
school has close visual ties to Jean Vigo's
great 40-minute film "Zero for Con
duct," but he and the screenwriter,
David Sherwin, substitute a particularly
repellent brand of mean-spiritedness for
the joyous tone of the Vigo picture, and
they equate liberation with death. Mal
colm McDowell plays the leading rebel
(this was the role that made him a star),
and Miroslav Ondricek photographed.
Plays Thursday and next Friday (Nov.
23) with "Another Country."
Mary Poppins (1964)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Julie Andrews turns P L. Travers'
persnickety governess into something in
humanly proficient and alarmingly
chaste, with perfect round tones. This
Walt Disney production, written by Bill
Walsh and Don DaGradi and directed by
Robert Stephenson, has a fudged,
overripe look, a pair of painfully angelic
kids (Karen Dotrice and Matthew Gar*
ber), unforgivable songs by the Sherman
brothers, and a dreadful performance
from David Tomlinson as the workaholic
patriarch of the family. (Actually, his
acting is squashed by his make-up, which
gives him glassy eyes and a square head.)
But for all that, the picture has moments
of genuine magic, and a quartet of
performers who enliven even the wettest
scenes: Glynis Johns as the suffragette
mother, Elsa Lanchester as the disgusted
nanny whom Poppins replaces, Fd Wynn

as Uncle Albert (whose chronic laughter
propels him up into the air like a bal
loon), and Dick Van Dyke as Bert, chim
ney sweep and sidewalk artist. Van
Dyke's Cockney accent is not even mo
mentarily convincing, but he hoofs en
dearingly, and he brings the film some
real warmth. Jane Darwell makes a brief
but striking appearance as the Bird Wo
man — unfortunately, in the most in
spirational number, "Feed the Birds."
Plays tomorrow and Sunday.
Soldier of Orange (1979)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Rutger Hauer, with his panache and
his Paul Newman eyes, plays Eric, the
Dutch hero of Paul Verhoeven's rousing
World War II spy thriller. Eric and his
friends are arrogant, courageous, and
full of audacious, gentlemanly flourishes
(like riding motorcycles in their
tuxedos); they remind one of the slightly
preposterous — and greatly appealing —
flair of many of the characters Errol
Flynn used to play. On paper, the ma
terial probably looked fairly conven
tional, but Verhoeven lends it a gentle,
wry, lightly nostalgic tone; it's a smash
ingly well directed movie (and the period
reconstructions are lovely). The cast in
cludes Jeroen Krabbe, Belinda Meul
dijk, Susan Penhaligon and Edward Fox.
The movie's source was Erik Hazelhoff s
autobiography.
Plays Monday and Tuesday with "Le
Crabe-Tambour."
The Bicycle Thief (1948)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Vittorio De Sica's fable about a man
driven to stealing in the poverty-stricken
Rome of the post-World War II epoch
appears on every list of all-time great
movies. Like the two other neo-realist
masterpieces De Sica made with
screenwriter Cesare Zavattini,
"Shoeshine" and "Umberto D," this
movie touches one so intimately that it is
almost an invasion of privacy; it is shock
ing, shattering and finally exhilarating.
De Sica takes us to the deepest reaches
of despair and out the other side. With
Lamberto Maggiorani, Lianella Carelli
and Enzo Staiola.
Plays Wednesday, Nov. 28, with "The
Garden of the Finzi-Continis."
The Bounty (1984)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Starting from an unusual source —
Richard Hough's book "Captain Bligh
and Mr. Christian." rather than the
romantic adventure novels by Nordhoff
and Hall that spawned the two earlier
film versions, both called "Mutiny on the
Bounty" — director Roger Donaldson
and screenwriter Robert Bolt build two

fascinating psychological portraits. Bligh
(Anthony Hopkins) is a man driven by
thwarted pride and ambition to conduct
himself in an unreasonable, inhumane
fashion; Christian (Mel Gibson) is an im
mature younger man who rebels against
an older friend standing in loco parentis.
The crux of the conflict between these
two is that Christian is not the man Bligh
thought him, and the discrepancy be
tween Bligh's idealized image of him —
informed at least in part by a homoerotic
interest — and Christian's real nature,
causes Bligh so much mental anguish
that he begins to behave cruelly toward
his friend and toward the sailors who
respect and admire Christian. The first
half of the film is problematic, because
Bolt originally planned two screenplays
to chronicle the tale of the "Bounty's"
journey to Tahiti, the mutiny, and the
separate fates of Bligh and Christian,
and consequently the movie feels com
pressed and frustratingly episodic. But if
you have the patience to ride out the first
hour, your trust pays off. With fine per
formances by Hopkins, Gibson, Wi Kuki
Kaa, Tevaite Vernette and Philip Martin
Brown.
Plays tomorrow with "The Year of
Living Dangerously."
City Lights (1931)
Bijou, Palo Alto
The structure of this beloved Chaplin
picture, his penultimate silent, is basic
Victorian melodrama: the Tramp falls in
love with a blind girl (Virginia Cherrill)
who sells flowers on the street, gets
money to pay her rent so that she won't
be evicted, pays for an operation to
restore her sight, goes to jail for stealing
the money even though he obtained it
honestly, etc. This is a very erratic movie
— some of the more elaborately set up
gags don't soar, much of it is drenched in
sentimentality, yet some of the comedy is
inspired and the last five minutes, when
the girl learns the identity of her bene
factor, is almost as great as the best
scenes in D.W. Griffith. As a whole,
"City Lights" is an exemplary blend of
Chaplin's virtues and faults. (Reading
the piece "A Feeling of Sad Dignity" in
Robert Warshow's "The Immediate Ex
perience" enhances the experience of
watching the movie.)
Plays Sunday, Nov. 25, with "The Im
migrant," "The Adventurer," "The
Cure" and "East Street."
Diner(l9B2)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Writer-director Barry Levinson based
this wonderful period piece, set in 1959,
on his own past, and every detail in it
seems deeply felt. The heroes are a quin
tet of men in their early 20s who gather
to celebrate the wedding of one of them
and to send off the decade that saw their

adolescence. Levinson understands the
highly emotionally charged nature of
what we call "trivia": pop music is the
absolute against which these people
measure everything that transpires in
their lives. The acting (by Daniel Stern,
Steve Guttenberg, Mickey Rourke,
Kevin Bacon, Timothy Daly, Ellen
Barkin and others) has the kind of
verisimilitude we usually find in great
documentaries. "Diner" is perhaps the
most sensuous and complexly funny rites
of passage movie ever made in this
country.
Plays Tuesday, Nov. 27, with "The Big
Chill."
Diva (1982)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The high-tech chic of this picture, di
rected by Jean-Jacques Beinix and shot
by Philippe Rousselot, is dazzling; all the
surfaces glitter. It's a Versailles of a
movie. Beinix's chief virtue, aside from
his dexterity, is his determination not to
take himself seriously: the witty,
freewheeling way in which he has put the
picture together, making his camera
double back on itself with tantalizing
self-consciousness, seems to be based on
the careless assumption that this little
thriller about stolen tapes is inconse
quential. You can't complain that
"Diva" doesn't mean anything, because
Beinix's tyle and the weightless, hollow
shimmer of Hilton McConnico's interior
design declare it in every frame. With
Frederic Andrei, who recalls the Jean-
Pierre Leaud of the middle and late '60s;
Thuy An Luu, who has the unflappable
cool of a Godard gamine; and the black
singer Wilhelminia Wiggins Fernandez.
Beinix and Jean Van Hamme adapted a
novel by Delacorta, and Vladimir Cosma
supplied a terrific jazzy score.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday with "The
Fourth Man."
The Fourth Man (1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Paul Verhoeven, the Dutch director,
made this masterful little movie with no
ideas but an exciting, sexy, ostentatious
surface. Jeroen Krabbe does first-rate
work in the role of a homosexual, al
coholic author with a gift for manipulat
ing circumstances to his own advantage.
About to board a train to Flushing,
where he has been hired to address a
literary club, he tries without success to
pick up a muscular young man (Thom
Hoffman). In Flushing, he allows himself
to be seduced by a wealthy widow
(Renee Soutendijk) and begins to enter
tain the prospect of living off her
generosity for a while, especially when
he learns that the Adonis from the train
station is her lover. What makes the film
nonsensical is the supernatural conflict
underpinning the sex story, but the Cath
olic imagery has astonishing clarity. The
best of it practically lifts Verhoeven into
the Bertoiucci ranks, though unlike Ber
tolucci, Verhoeven's images operate
purely on the visceral level.
Plays tomorrow and Sunday with
"Diva."

Psycho (1960)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Alfred Hitchcock's most lauded
picture. It will scare the hell out of you if
you're seing it for the first time; the in
itiated return again and again to marvel
at the intricate design of the suspense se
quences and the interplay between
George Tomasin's editing and Bernard
Herrmann's jangling, expressive music
(scored solely for strings during the
shower scene). Watching this Grand
Guignol comedy, with its motel office
full of stuffed birds and its extravagant,
aberrant sexual psychology, is a perverse
pleasure: no movie until "Jaws" was so
wittily sadistic in its treatment of the au
dience. Anthony Perkins is marvelous as
the creepy motel owner, Norman Bates;
the supporting cast is headed by Janet
Leigh, Vera Miles, Martin Balsam, John
Gavin, John Mclntire and Simon Oak
land. "Psycho" turned out to be
Hitchcock's summit achievement; none
of his subsequent half-dozen movies can
even be discussed in the same breath.
Plays Thursday and next Friday (Nov.
23) with "North by Northwest."

The Seventh Seal (1956)
Festival, Palo Alto
With this medieval puzzle drama, In
gmar Bergman rose to heights that none
of his subsequent "dark" movies, except
for "Shame" a dozen years later, has
ever equalled. The knight's chess game
with Death is surely one of the key
images in world cinema, and the se
quence involving the burning of the
young witch suggests that Bergman may
have been inspired by Dreyer's "Day of
Wrath." With Max von Sydow as the
knight, Bengt Ekerot as Death, Maud
Hansson as the witch, Bibi Andersson,
Gunnar Bjornstrand and Nils Poppe.
Plays through Wednesday with "Wild
Strawberries."
A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy
(1982)
Bijou, Palo Alto
In a bucolic setting. Woody Allen and
his sexually reticent wife, Mary Steen
burgen, gather together a small party of
friends: a pompous professor (Jose Fer
rer), his fiancee (Mia Farrow), a randy
physician (Tony Roberts), and a delec
tably sexy nurse (Julie Hagerty). Woody
Allen's comedy evokes Shakespeare,
Chekhov, Renoir and (especially) In
gmar Bergman, but it's a difficult movie
to get a handle on — it's neither serious
nor parodistic, neither period nor con
temporary. Bizarrely ill-at-ease, it's a sex
farce for anhedonics.
Plays Monday with "A Midsummer
Night's Dream."
North by Northwest (1959)
Bijou, Palo Alto
One of Alfred Hitchcock's last first
rate thrillers — a gloriously entertaining,
wittily sustained variation on his old
theme of the innocent trapped in in
trigue. Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint,
Jessie Royce Landis, Martin Landau and
Mount Rushmore are among the
featured players. Ernest Lehman wrote
the script, which contains one of the
most famous lines in any suspense film:
"That's funny — that duster's dustin'
crops where there ain't no crops." The
title, by the way, is both a reference to
"Hamlet" ("I am mad north
northwest. . .") and a clue to the geogra
phy of the movie.
Plays Thursday and next Friday (Nov.
23) with "Psycho."
The Magic Flute (1975)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Sometimes Ingmar Bergman's movie
of Mozart's last opera evokes Dickens,
sometimes Shakespeare; sometimes it
parodies operetta conventions, like Peter
Brook's "Beggar's Opera." The Three
Spirits are Christmas choirboys who des
cend in a balloon and pelt Papageno
(Hakan Hagegard, dressed in green, with
a pageboy haircut, so that he looks like
one of Robin Hood's men) with snow
balls to avert him from suicide. When
Tamino (Josef Kostlinger) plays his
flute, he attracts an audience of charm
ingly stylized beasts — a wide-eyed bear,
a mournful lion, a walrus lying on his
back, a trio of possums hanging upside
down from the flies. Birgit Nordin plays
that imperious manipulator, the Queen
of the Night, and Ulrik Cold is a truly
humanistic Sarastro. Bergman gets
amazingly natural performances from his
cast, and the movie, set in the Drottnin
gholm Court Theatre in Stockholm, has
so much heart that — coming after his
dreary psychodrama "Scenes from a
Marriage" — it was practically a rebirth.
(It is also, by the way, one of the few
great movies for children.) Sven Nykvist
shot it in 16mm. for Swedish television,
and it was blown up to 35mm. for
theatrical release, but when you see the
quality of the photography you won't
believe it.
Plays Sunday, Nov. 25, with "Don
Giovanni."
This Is Spinal Tap (1984)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Rob Reiner's slight, often hilarious
parody of heavy metal rock, featuring
Christopher Guest, Michael McKean
and Harry Shearer (in a walrus mous
tache) as the main members of the group
whose descent from fame the mock doc
umentary chronicles. (They also col
laborated with Reiner on the
screenplay.) The musical numbers aren't
as witty as they might be, except for an
imitation British Invasion TV spot called
"Listen to the Flower People."
Plays today with "Ziggy Stardust and
the Spider from Mars."
The Year of Living Dangerously
(1983)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Set in Indonesia in 1965, in the last
gasps of President Sukarno's regime,
Peter Weir's film is richly, vividly enjoy
able: it has a sensuousness that was mis
sing from his last picture, "Gallipoli,"
and Linda Hunt's amazing portrayal of
Billy Kwan, a Chinese-American
photographer, gives it an emotional cen
ter. Without her, it wouldn't have one;
Weir has made a cinematic guess at what
a Conrad novel might be like without
philosophy, without conviction. It's as if
he had assimilated all the old movies
he'd ever seen with daring journalist
heroes and setting revolutions and
feverish romances in unlikely settings
and compressed them into one super
deluxe entertainment. What he has
added is his own seductive elusiveness —
his suggestion that there is more inside
his movie than meets the eye, when in
fact there is a great deal less. It's a hell of
a movie, though. Starring Mel Gibson
and Sigourney Weaver; written by Weir,
David Williamson and C.J. Koch; shot
by that wizard. Russell Boyd.
Plays tomorrow with "The Bounty."
