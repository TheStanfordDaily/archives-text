# Rabbis launch hunger strike
## 
### MARC PEYSER Staff writer 
In response to recent "abhorrent
practices" by Soviet officials against
Jews in Odessa and other cities, a
group of Bay Area rabbis has under
taken an indefinite, rotating hunger
strike.
Organized by the Bay Area Coun
cil for Soviet Jews, the fast is an effort
to publicize a recent surge of arrests
and harassment of Jewish educators
in the Soviet Union.
"This is an expression of
solidarity," said Palo Alto Rabbi
Sheldon Lewis. "I think this is the
most ambitious, biggest communal
effort" of its kind ever undertaken in
the Bay Area.
The fast, which began on Tuesday,
will be conducted on a rotating basis.
A rabbi from each of the Bay Area's
75 Jewish congregations and religious
schools will refrain from eating for
one day each, Sunday to Thursday.
No fasting will take place on the days
of the Jewish sabbath.
The rabbis are members of the
Board of Rabbis of Northern Califor
nia, a group that is also helping to or
ganize a similar fast in Chicago.
According to Michael Kesselman.
associate director of the Bay Area
Council for Soviet Jews, the fact that
the rabbis represent more than
120,000 Jews in the Bay Area is "a
sign."
"It represents so many people
overwhelmed with a sense of
outrage," he said.
Ranging from raids of private
homes to "drug libels," where the
government plants drugs and weap
ons in homes of Jews and then ar
rests them, the "atrocities" against
which the rabbis are protesting have
been getting progressively worse
since President Reagan took office,
according to area rabbis.
"Reagan takes a hard line against

the Soviets," said Rabbi Ari Cartun
of Stanford Hillel. "There is no
detente, no bargaining on human
rights, no leverage being used. [The
increased action] is but part of the
general tensing of American-Soviet
relations."
According to Kesselman, the treat
ment of Jews in the Soviet Union —
as shown by emigration figures and
official Soviet policy — has steadily
worsened during the last five
years.
"In 1979, the height of detente and
Jewish immigration, 51,000 left the
Soviet Union," Kesselman said. Last
year the number was down to 1,300,
and Kesselman said that he expects
fewer than 1,000 Jews to emigrate
this year.
"Linked to the falling numbers,"
he said, "is a growing anti-Semitism
in the Soviet press. The state has
made it known that it doesn't want
them to leave."
While much of the backlash of
abuse is directed at these
"refuseniks," Jews who have re
quested and been denied asylum, at
the center of the fast is the increased
persecution of Jewish educators and
the methods used against them.
One of the most criticized practices
has been the drug libels, named be
cause of their similarity to the blood
libels of the early Christian era, when
Jews were accused of using the blood
of Christian children to make matzah
— unleavened bread — for Passover.
According to Lewis, the planting of
drugs in religious objects has led to a
similar response in which "allegations
[are being made] that Jewish ritual
objects are being used to hide drugs.
It's unbelievable."
Lewis said that in addition to
drawing media attention here to the
situation, the fast is an attempt to
cause some changes in the Soviet
Union.
