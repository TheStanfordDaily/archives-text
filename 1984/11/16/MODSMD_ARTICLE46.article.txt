# Big Game pranks keep 'em guessing
## 
### FRANK LESTER Staff writer 
Every year around Big Game time,
students seem to lose their inhibitions
and concentrate all their intellectual
faculties on a single purpose: pulling
pranks.
Part of the fun of Big Game week is
seeing the extent to which students
will expend their ingenuity on practi
cal jokes designed to incur the wrath
of the Berkeley students. If this year
is any indication, ingenuity has run
amok.
Witness, for example, the audacity
displayed by three students who
awoke yesterday at 4:30 a.m.,
dumped 30 boxes of red dye into a
bag, and drove the 44-mile distance

to (he Berkeley campus to empty the
dye into the fountain outside of the
student union.
Since no one was awake that early
in the morning, it was easy to empty
the bag into the quiet fountain and
wait for it to be turned on, according
to a member of the trio who declined
to be identified.
The students left to eat breakfast.
The sight that greeted their eyes upon
returning to the campus at 6:1 5 a.m.
was nothing less than gratifying: The
fountain was aflood with color. "The
pool itself turned a real dark red, al
most blood-red," the student said, "It
was pretty gory."
Later that morning, 40 students
from Serra House suspended a 2,000-

square-foot tarp with the words
"Beat Cal" painted on it from the
South Tower of the Golden Gate
Bridge. They were preparing to take
photographs of the tarp and call the
press in to get publicity for the stunt
when the bridge police showed up,
not amused.
"They made a big spectacle out of
it and tied up the traffic on the bridge
with their cars," said sophomore Jack
Alden. "One of them came by and
asked, 'What's the commotion
about?' And another said, 'Oh,
there's some college kids hanging a
sign off the bridge.'
"We were thinking of trying to go
over to Berkeley and hang it off one
of their libraries, but we decided that

we'd probably get killed," Alden
said.
As it was, the pranksters returned
to Stanford with their tarp and
managed to distract an attendant
while they draped it over Meyer Li
brary. Alden said that all in all, the
prank had been fun even though it
hadn't been finished. "It really should
have worked right if we hadn't been
rushed," he said.
Some Delta Kappa Epsilon frater
nity pledges chose to make the statue
of Father Junipero Serra along Inter
state 280 the object of their prank.
They put a blindfold on the statue
with — what else? — "Beat Cal"
printed on it. From the Father's
pointing finger they hung a Stanford
yo-yo.
