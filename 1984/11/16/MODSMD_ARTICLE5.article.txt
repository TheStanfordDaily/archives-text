The entire campus and parts of Palo Alto, Menlo Park
and other local cities were hit by a power outage at 9:04
last night when lightning struck a substation in Menlo
Park.
Harry Arnott, a Pacific Gas & Electric spokesman, said
the 20-square-mile area affected by the blackout included
4,969 PG&E customers. "Customers" range in size from
a single household to an entire institution, such as the
University.
Most customers had their power turned back on very
quickly, Arnott said, but 500 customers in the Welch
Road area remained without electricity until 11.20
p.m.
PG&E was able to restore power quickly to most areas
by drawing in power from other substations, Arnott said.

The stormy weather last night didn't cause any other
problems for PG&E, Arnott said.
"This is the only report we had tonight that caused an
outage," he said.
Although there was a bad lightning storm last month,
Arnott said, lightning strikes are very rare in this area.
Students at Durand House, which lost power for about
an hour and 15 minutes, coped with the outage by lighting
candles and using flashlights, according to Resident Assis
tant Russell Poore. While some students attempted to
study by candlelight, others enjoyed the chance to just "sit
around in the dark," Poore said.
"It was a good excuse to sit around on a Thursday night
and do nothing," he said.
