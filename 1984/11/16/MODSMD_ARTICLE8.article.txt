Baby Fae dies after kidney failure
LOMA LINDA — Baby Fae, the month-old infant who received a
baboon's heart to replace her own congenitally deformed one, died last
night, almost three weeks after undergoing her historic operation, a
hospital spokesman said.
"Baby Fae died at 9 p.m.," said Ed Wines, vice president for public
relations and development for Loma Linda University, reading from a
statement issued by doctors at that institution's medical center.
During the afternoon. Baby Fae's kidney function deteriorated and
required peritoneal dialysis around 7 p.m., Wines said.
"Although her immunological studies had not changed significantly,
her heart became unstable and failed to respond to intensive measures
including closed cardiac massage," he said.
"Fler parents were with her as much as possible during this period and
are receiving support from chaplains and the physicians," he said.
Baby Fae lived longer than any other recipient of a transplanted
animal heart.
Earlier yesterday. Baby Fae had been in serious but stable condition,
hooked to a respirator and being fed intravenously. Doctors said she had
been making progress against a heart rejection episode which peaked
early this week.
Changes in Medicare considered
WASHINGTON — The Reagan administration is considering a plan
to broaden Medicare to cover so-called catastrophic illnesses while pos
sibly also requiring private employers to include catastrophic coverage in
group insurance policies for their employees, according to government
and health industry sources.
As now envisioned, the extra Medicare coverage would be financed by
an increase in premiums so it would not add to the government's costs.
At the same time, the sources said, the administration is considering
resubmitting to Congress several proposals rejected before that are
aimed at reducing health-care costs — now about one-tenth of the
budget — and helping to bring down the federal deficit. Among these
deficit-reducing ideas are:
• A plan under which Medicare recipients could opt out of the program
and buy private health insurance instead; they would be offered vouch
ers to defray the cost.
• A requirement that private health insurance companies reimburse the
government when their policyholders are cared for in government hospi
tals; the government pays for this now.
• A requirement that workers count as income and pay federal income
taxes on employer-paid health insurance premiums if they exceed a spe
cified amount.
• Extending in some form the current "freeze" on increases in payments
to physicians under Medicare.
• Reducing the federal income tax deduction for medical expenses.
• Raising the existing Medicare premium.
King eulogized by Carter, Bush
ATLANTA — From the back streets and from the halls of power,
from across the country, they came to Ebenezer Church yesterday to
eulogize a man they called "Daddy" — Martin Luther King Sr., the Bap
tist preacher who helped foster the civil rights revolution.
The old brick sanctuary, where King served as pastor for more than 40
years, rocked to the fiery tributes and stirring spirituals that were offered
in homage to King, who died Sunday after suffering a heart attack. He
was 84.
Mourners crowded the aisles of the church's main floor and balcony,
and spilled out onto "Sweet" Auburn Avenue, the worn-looking street
that was once the thriving center of Atlanta's black community.
The mourners heard former President Carter say that King was a
valued adviser and friend, "God's Southern gentleman."
"He meant a great deal to me as governor (of Georgia) and as presi
dent," Carter said. "So I come here today not with sorrow, but with a
touch of loneliness."
Vice President George Bush said that King was a "great American
hero," who held a "silent vigil against bigotry" in the days when civil
rights activism was neither safe nor fashionable.
Salvador rebels ponder next move
MEXICO CITY — The Salvadoran rebel movement has begun dis
cussions on the possibility of participating in elections organized by the
U.S.-backed government of President Jose Napoleon Duarte, according
to insurgent leaders.
The proposal, which would mark a major concession in rebel
demands, has been advanced by leaders of the movement's political
wing, the Democratic Revolutionary Front, but has not been accepted
by the more adamantly leftist military wing, the Farabundo Marti Na
tional Liberation Front, these leaders say.
Chances for acceptance by the entire rebel alliance depend chiefly on
the course of a dialogue with Duarte's government that opened a month
ago at a precedent-shattering meeting in the Salvadoran hill town of La
Palma, according to Ruben Zamora of the Democratic Revolutionary
Front.
Gen. Westmoreland takes the stand
NEW YORK — Erect in bearing but relaxed in manner, Gen. William
Westmoreland took the witness stand yesterday to retrieve the honor
that he said a CBS television documentary had stolen from him by libel.
Under direct examination by his attorney, Dan Burt, Westmoreland,
wearing a small Vietnam campaign rosette in the lapel of his gray busi
ness suit, outlined his 36 years of active duty in the Army, from his first
tour as the lieutenant of a horse-drawn gun battery before World War II
to his retirement in 1972 as a four-star general and the Army's chief of
staff.
Westmoreland, 70, did not change his open and direct manner on the
stand in U.S. District Court, as Burt narrowed the inquiry to the years
1964 to 1968, when Westmoreland was commander of American forces
in Vietnam and.finally, to 1967.
That was the year that a CBS Reports documentary "The Un
counted Enemy; A Vietnam Deception" charged that "a conspiracy at
the highest levels of American military intelligence" reported enemy
troop estimates that it said were deliberately undercounted by hundreds
of thousands of people.
Group says Diablo still unsafe
WASHING lON — A watchdog public-interest group yesterday
charged officials at the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant
with 491 new violations of quality-assurance regulations and accused
Nuclear Regulatory Commission officials and plant officials of collusion
in covering up the violations.
In a petition filed with the NRC, the Government Accountability
Project also said that it was providing corroborating evidence for 123
previous allegations of violations at the plant, which began producing
electricity Sunday, nearly 10 years after its originally scheduled start-up.
Big Game weekend weather
NEW YORK — The stock market drifted to a small loss yesterday,
continuing its post-election slump.
But some energy issues gained ground on renewed takeover specula
tion.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped .77 to 1,206.16,
bringing its loss since Nov. 6 to 37.99 points.
Stocks remain in slump
Showers this morning, clearing later today with highs in the mid 50s to
low 60s. Fair tonight with some local fog and clear tomorrow morning
with increasing cloudiness in the afternoon.

Baby Fae dies after kidney failure
LOMA LINDA — Baby Fae, the month-old infant who received a
baboon's heart to replace her own congenitally deformed one, died last
night, almost three weeks after undergoing her historic operation, a
hospital spokesman said.
"Baby Fae died at 9 p.m.," said Ed Wines, vice president for public
relations and development for Loma Linda University, reading from a
statement issued by doctors at that institution's medical center.
During the afternoon. Baby Fae's kidney function deteriorated and
required peritoneal dialysis around 7 p.m., Wines said.
"Although her immunological studies had not changed significantly,
her heart became unstable and failed to respond to intensive measures
including closed cardiac massage," he said.
"Fler parents were with her as much as possible during this period and
are receiving support from chaplains and the physicians," he said.
Baby Fae lived longer than any other recipient of a transplanted
animal heart.
Earlier yesterday. Baby Fae had been in serious but stable condition,
hooked to a respirator and being fed intravenously. Doctors said she had
been making progress against a heart rejection episode which peaked
early this week.
Changes in Medicare considered
WASHINGTON — The Reagan administration is considering a plan
to broaden Medicare to cover so-called catastrophic illnesses while pos
sibly also requiring private employers to include catastrophic coverage in
group insurance policies for their employees, according to government
and health industry sources.
As now envisioned, the extra Medicare coverage would be financed by
an increase in premiums so it would not add to the government's costs.
At the same time, the sources said, the administration is considering
resubmitting to Congress several proposals rejected before that are
aimed at reducing health-care costs — now about one-tenth of the
budget — and helping to bring down the federal deficit. Among these
deficit-reducing ideas are:
• A plan under which Medicare recipients could opt out of the program
and buy private health insurance instead; they would be offered vouch
ers to defray the cost.
• A requirement that private health insurance companies reimburse the
government when their policyholders are cared for in government hospi
tals; the government pays for this now.
• A requirement that workers count as income and pay federal income
taxes on employer-paid health insurance premiums if they exceed a spe
cified amount.
• Extending in some form the current "freeze" on increases in payments
to physicians under Medicare.
• Reducing the federal income tax deduction for medical expenses.
• Raising the existing Medicare premium.
King eulogized by Carter, Bush
ATLANTA — From the back streets and from the halls of power,
from across the country, they came to Ebenezer Church yesterday to
eulogize a man they called "Daddy" — Martin Luther King Sr., the Bap
tist preacher who helped foster the civil rights revolution.
The old brick sanctuary, where King served as pastor for more than 40
years, rocked to the fiery tributes and stirring spirituals that were offered
in homage to King, who died Sunday after suffering a heart attack. He
was 84.
Mourners crowded the aisles of the church's main floor and balcony,
and spilled out onto "Sweet" Auburn Avenue, the worn-looking street
that was once the thriving center of Atlanta's black community.
The mourners heard former President Carter say that King was a
valued adviser and friend, "God's Southern gentleman."
"He meant a great deal to me as governor (of Georgia) and as presi
dent," Carter said. "So I come here today not with sorrow, but with a
touch of loneliness."
Vice President George Bush said that King was a "great American
hero," who held a "silent vigil against bigotry" in the days when civil
rights activism was neither safe nor fashionable.
Salvador rebels ponder next move
MEXICO CITY — The Salvadoran rebel movement has begun dis
cussions on the possibility of participating in elections organized by the
U.S.-backed government of President Jose Napoleon Duarte, according
to insurgent leaders.
The proposal, which would mark a major concession in rebel
demands, has been advanced by leaders of the movement's political
wing, the Democratic Revolutionary Front, but has not been accepted
by the more adamantly leftist military wing, the Farabundo Marti Na
tional Liberation Front, these leaders say.
Chances for acceptance by the entire rebel alliance depend chiefly on
the course of a dialogue with Duarte's government that opened a month
ago at a precedent-shattering meeting in the Salvadoran hill town of La
Palma, according to Ruben Zamora of the Democratic Revolutionary
Front.
Gen. Westmoreland takes the stand
NEW YORK — Erect in bearing but relaxed in manner, Gen. William
Westmoreland took the witness stand yesterday to retrieve the honor
that he said a CBS television documentary had stolen from him by libel.
Under direct examination by his attorney, Dan Burt, Westmoreland,
wearing a small Vietnam campaign rosette in the lapel of his gray busi
ness suit, outlined his 36 years of active duty in the Army, from his first
tour as the lieutenant of a horse-drawn gun battery before World War II
to his retirement in 1972 as a four-star general and the Army's chief of
staff.
Westmoreland, 70, did not change his open and direct manner on the
stand in U.S. District Court, as Burt narrowed the inquiry to the years
1964 to 1968, when Westmoreland was commander of American forces
in Vietnam and.finally, to 1967.
That was the year that a CBS Reports documentary "The Un
counted Enemy; A Vietnam Deception" charged that "a conspiracy at
the highest levels of American military intelligence" reported enemy
troop estimates that it said were deliberately undercounted by hundreds
of thousands of people.
Group says Diablo still unsafe
WASHING lON — A watchdog public-interest group yesterday
charged officials at the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant
with 491 new violations of quality-assurance regulations and accused
Nuclear Regulatory Commission officials and plant officials of collusion
in covering up the violations.
In a petition filed with the NRC, the Government Accountability
Project also said that it was providing corroborating evidence for 123
previous allegations of violations at the plant, which began producing
electricity Sunday, nearly 10 years after its originally scheduled start-up.
