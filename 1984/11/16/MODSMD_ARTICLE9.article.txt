## Chilean police sweep town 
### 
SANTIAGO, Chile — Thousands of police and
troops surrounded the sprawling La Victoria shanty
town here yesterday, searched its homes, and
detained all ot its adult males during a seven-hour
operation meant to suppress militant opposition to
military rule.
The massive search and roundup began shortly
before 6 a.m., when helicopters swooped low over
the district ot 32,000 people while megaphones
blared orders for residents to remain in their
homes. I elephones and electricity were cut off and
army and air force troops formed a skirmish line
around the neighborhood while police conducted a
house-to-house search.
Secret police agents, dressed in civilian clothes
and green armbands emblazoned with the Chilean
flag, moved through the streets with lists of names
and addresses of political and labor activists who
were driven away in vans, according to witnesses.
"Remain calm, blared the loudspeakers. "This is
an operation under the state of siege. Anyone who
leaves their home will be taken as an agitator."
All males in the shantytown between the ages of
16 and 60, estimated to number more than 5,000,
later were ordered onto buses and taken to an old
soccer stadium several miles away. There they were

checked against police records and those with prior
arrests were separated for transport to jails and
barracks. Men who were later released said politi
cal suspects were taken into an underground tunnel
monitored by an agent wearing a ski mask.
Late yesterday, government spokesman Fran
cisco Cuadra announced that 227 people from La
Victoria remained under detention. He said 207
had criminal records and 30 had "subversive con
nections." He said police had confiscated a number
of guns and knives during searches as well as a ma
chine for fabricating grenades.
The roundup was the second carried out by mili
tary and security forces in shantytowns since Presi
dent Augusto Pinochet declared a nationwide state
of siege eight days ago. Authorities maintain the
operations are necessary to search for arms and
weed out people with criminal records or involve
ment in political terrorism.
"This is done to terrify and punish the popula
tion," said the Rev. Pierre Dubois, the neighbor
hood's longtime resident priest. A human rights of
ficial added, "They are trying to destroy the bases
of political mobilization."
The arrests in La Victoria followed the detention
of more than 350 people in the Raul Silva Henri

quez shantytown last Saturday and more than 150
other arrests around the country in separate opera
tions by secret police during the last week.
Authorities ordered 103 of those imprisoned
after the Silva Henriquez raid into internal exile at
a camp in northern Chile I uesday, saying they had
records as common criminals. 1 hirty-two leftist ac
tivists were sent to other locations Wednesday, and
others have been released.
Cuadra said yesterday that in addition to those
arrested in the La Victoria raid, 51 people
remained under detention at police stations, bar
racks and secret police installations. Human rights
lawyers said they believe the figure may be several
times higher.
The neighborhood chosen for yesterday's crack
down, La Victoria, has won renown over the past
18 months as the most militant focus of opposition
to Pinochet's government and a stronghold of left
ist political parties. Its sandy, partially paved streets
have been regularly sealed with barricades of
flaming tires and manned by men with slingshots
during antigovernment protests.
