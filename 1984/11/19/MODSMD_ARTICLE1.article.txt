# The 						Bear is out. the Axe is in

BERKELEY â€” By the time Stan
ford noseguard Terry Jackson had
finished taking the Axe on its victory
tour of Memorial Stadium and the
last over-enthusiastic Cardinal fan
had been clubbed into the Astroturf
by stadium security, it was tough to
remember what had happened in the
Berkeley twilight just two years ago.

Please see stories,
pages 8 and 9, and
photos, page 14.

With its systematic 27-10 destruc
tion of the University of California on
Saturday, the Cardinal busted a lot of
ghosts that were still left over from
that freakish 25-20 loss in the 1982
Big Game. The Play has been
avenged, and after two long years, the
Axe is back.
"It ranks right up there" with the
other big Stanford victories, said
senior tackle Matt Moran. "It's nice
to end my career with a win and go
out with a good taste in my mouth."
At first, the taste was not so sweet.
With just over seven minutes left in
the second quarter, the Golden Bears
led Stanford 10-0, the raucous Cal
fans were sending the Wave around
the stadium, and it looked like the
Cardinal might be headed for another
Big Choke.
But by the midway point of the
fourth quarter, the only wave was the
one exiting the Cal sections of the
stadium. The Cardinal rattled off 13
points in the last minutes of the first
half and 14 in the second half, and the
87th Big Game was history.
"It was a great win, but really, I

didn't see any way we could lose,"
said senior linebacker Tom Briehl.
"We just wanted to make sure that
the game couldn't be decided by any
fourth-quarter rally."
Cardinal running back Brad
Muster did the most to put the game
out of the reach of any last-second
miracles. Muster, who began the
season as the third-string fullback,
finished it with a near-record 204
yard performance in the first Big
Game of his career.
"With the line we have, anyone can
run for 200 yards," said the typically
reserved Muster after the game. The
line did indeed create openings in the
Cal defense, but the 6-foot-3, 198-
pound Muster had just as much suc
cess running over Bears on Saturday
as he did running around them.
"Stanford earned this victory," said
beleagured Cal Coach Joe Kapp. "I
won't say anything to take that away
from them. I hope they enjoy the
party."
There was no party at the stadium
after the game. When the clock had
ticked down to zero in the fourth
quarter, elated fans from the Stanford
student section began streaming over
the gates onto the field, looking for
some kind of mass celebration.
Instead, they found a wall of
policemen and yellow-jacketed se
curity guards with no qualms about
getting physical with anyone trespass
ing on the Astroturf of Memorial
Stadium. The situation grew ugly
when policemen began using their
billy clubs on uncooperative fans.
Other than that, the day was a
complete success for the Cardinal.
The Axe has returned; everything is
"All Right Now."
