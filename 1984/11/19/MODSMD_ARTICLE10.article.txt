## The
						Stanford Daily Save shuttle for science 
### 
From any perspective, NASA's space shuttle
program has been a tremendous success. But
some future shuttle flights will be flying in the
wrong direction. Misguided are the plans for a
special Department of Defense (DoD) mission
and for missions with a teacher and a U.S.
senator aboard.
The 14 shuttle missions to date have tackled
scientific and commercial tasks, but the next
flight, scheduled for Jan. 21, will break new
ground. On that mission, the shuttle Discovery
will take off with a secret DoD payload.
This new step into space by the department
was probably inevitable, given the amount of fund
ing it provided for the development of the
shuttle program. However, at a time when the
United States and the Soviet Union cannot even
control the arms race on earth, this threatens to
spread the arms competition into space.
The scheduling of r'iis mission and President
Reagan's public support for a "Star Wars"
missile-defense program demonstrate the extent
to which the United States is willing to militarize

space. It is unlikely that the Soviets will see a
need to unilaterally hold back on developing and
deploying their own space weapons, and so the
race is on.
In addition, the timing is inopportune.
Moderately good relations between the super
powers are in the infantile stages of development,
and the DoD mission, coupled with the furor sur
rounding Nicaragua, will not promote the matur
ing of those relations.
NASA's shuttle program is also expending vi
tal time and money on unnecessary trips for a
teacher and a U.S. senator.
Much progress has been made in terms of the
shuttle: Astronauts have now successfully
deployed, fueled and retrieved satellites; the op
eration of the robotic arm has become routine;
launchings are becoming more frequent and
timely. Future exploitation of the shuttle's enor
mous potential is only limited by its finite supply
of flight time.
Sending legislators and educators on missions
will only slow progress on substantial projects.
