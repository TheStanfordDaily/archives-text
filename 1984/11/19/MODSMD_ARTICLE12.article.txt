## Stanford liberals did well 
### 
There was not a lot of good news
election night for the liberals of Stan
ford University. Not only did Walter
Mondale lose in a rout, local
Democrats Martin Carnoy and Arlen
Gregorio also went down to defeat.
But there may be a silver lining in
even so dismal a black cloud.
Last spring, the liberal groups at
Stanford were small and isolated. In a

VIEWPOINT

head-to-head poll, Walter Mondale
appeared to be headed to a 40-
percent-to-60-percent loss to President
Reagan on the Stanford campus.
Many liberals felt alienated and alone
at the soon-to-be home of the
Reagan library.
But the liberals of Stanford refused
to concede defeat. Last spring, exist
ing groups began to work together
with several new organizations dedi
cated to reversing the Republican
tide. Among other things, the anti-
Reagan groups held more than a
dozen dorm meetings, raised funds,
brought speakers to campus, worked
at conferences, sold buttons, dis
tributed literature and made contacts
across the state. Over the summer,
Stanford students worked on a voter
registration drive that brought more
than 19,000 new voters into the poli
tical process. These voters were more
than two-to-one Democratic, well
above the statewide average for new
voters.
This quarter, the anti-Reagan
mobilization was even more impres
sive. Students walked more than 100
precincts for liberal Democratic can
didates. They also called thousands of
voters. On campus, students sold
hundreds of T-shirts, buttons and
posters opposing Reagan. There were
anti-Reagan movies, parties and
rallies. The liberal groups on campus
brought an impressive array of
speakers to denounce the current ad
ministration. including Ralph Nader,
Carl Sagan and Cesar Chavez. This
culminated in the awesome rally
which brought both Gary Hart and
Walter Mondale himself to Stanford.
This rally packed 2,000 screaming
Mondale partisans into Memorial
Auditorium and, despite a driving
rain, another 2,000 people showed

up, only to be turned away for lack of
seats.
In marked contradiction to the
enormous amounts of work done by
liberal students here was the almost
complete absence of conservative ac
tivism at Stanford. The campus
Republicans ran a table at registra
tion and they helped the ASSU bring
Phyllis Schiafly to campus. Aside
from that, their only advertised activ
ity was a party for the first presiden
tial debate. No T-shirts, no dorm
meetings, no precincts walked, no
movies, no rallies, no phone-banks,
one speaker. The anti-Reagan groups
operated essentially unopposed.
Did we have an effect? Undoubt
edly. A poll taken before the election
showed that Mondale had moved

friends at Stanford.'

from a 20-point deficit to a 10-point
lead among the student body here.
Indeed, if you take away the fresh
men, who were not around for the full
extent of the anti-Reagan activity
over the past few quarters, Stanford
was better than 60-to-40 for
Mondale. Further, the final election
results for the Stanford precincts,
which include graduate students not
surveyed in the previous polls, totaled
a staggering 71 percent for Mondale.
Clearly, six months of work against
the Reagan administration had a sig
nificant effect on the Stanford
campus. And there is good evidence
that this impact was felt beyond the
University. The Mondale rally at
Stanford got national press attention
as the most enthusiastic campus
reception Mondale received in his

entire campaign. Hundreds of people
across the nation are wearing the
anti-Reagan buttons and T-shirts sent
to them by "their friends at Stan
ford." The statewide network of col
lege anti-Reagan groups proudly
announces that it was founded at
Stanford. State Democratic officials
now point to Stanford to refute the
argument that there is a conservative
revival on college campuses.
Even in the local races, there are
silver linings to be found for the
liberal candidates. Ed Zschau out
spent Martin Carnoy by 4-to-l, but
Zschau still did worse in 1984 as an
incumbent than he had in 1982 as an
unknown private citizen. Arlen
Gregorio came within 4 percentage
points of winning a district which the

state legislature had designed expect
ing any Republican to win by at least
15 points. The unexpectedly good
showings of Carnoy and Gregorio can
be in part attributed to the large mar
gins rolled up here at Stanford, as
well as to the work done for them by
Stanford volunteers in the commu
nity.
In sum, the liberal activists at Stan
ford could not swing the votes of the
whole country. But we did have a
dramatic impact here and in the sur
rounding communities, and Stanford
is a better place to live because of it.
And there is still hope. If we. can
make a difference here, we can make
a difference anywhere.

at conferences, sold buttons, dis
tributed literature and made contacts
across the state. Over the summer,
Stanford students worked on a voter
registration drive that brought more
than 19,000 new voters into the poli
tical process. These voters were more
than two-to-one Democratic, well
above the statewide average for new
voters.
This quarter, the anti-Reagan
mobilization was even more impres
sive. Students walked more than 100
precincts for liberal Democratic can
didates. They also called thousands of
voters. On campus, students sold
hundreds of T-shirts, buttons and
posters opposing Reagan. There were
anti-Reagan movies, parties and
rallies. The liberal groups on campus
brought an impressive array of
speakers to denounce the current ad
ministration. including Ralph Nader,
Carl Sagan and Cesar Chavez. This
culminated in the awesome rally
which brought both Gary Hart and
Walter Mondale himself to Stanford.
This rally packed 2,000 screaming
Mondale partisans into Memorial
Auditorium and, despite a driving
rain, another 2,000 people showed

up, only to be turned away for lack of
seats.
In marked contradiction to the
enormous amounts of work done by
liberal students here was the almost
complete absence of conservative ac
tivism at Stanford. The campus
Republicans ran a table at registra
tion and they helped the ASSU bring
Phyllis Schiafly to campus. Aside
from that, their only advertised activ
ity was a party for the first presiden
tial debate. No T-shirts, no dorm
meetings, no precincts walked, no
movies, no rallies, no phone-banks,
one speaker. The anti-Reagan groups
operated essentially unopposed.
Did we have an effect? Undoubt
edly. A poll taken before the election
showed that Mondale had moved

from a 20-point deficit to a 10-point
lead among the student body here.
Indeed, if you take away the fresh
men, who were not around for the full
extent of the anti-Reagan activity
over the past few quarters, Stanford
was better than 60-to-40 for
Mondale. Further, the final election
results for the Stanford precincts,
which include graduate students not
surveyed in the previous polls, totaled
a staggering 71 percent for Mondale.
Clearly, six months of work against
the Reagan administration had a sig
nificant effect on the Stanford
campus. And there is good evidence
that this impact was felt beyond the
University. The Mondale rally at
Stanford got national press attention
as the most enthusiastic campus
reception Mondale received in his

entire campaign. Hundreds of people
across the nation are wearing the
anti-Reagan buttons and T-shirts sent
to them by "their friends at Stan
ford." The statewide network of col
lege anti-Reagan groups proudly
announces that it was founded at
Stanford. State Democratic officials
now point to Stanford to refute the
argument that there is a conservative
revival on college campuses.
Even in the local races, there are
silver linings to be found for the
liberal candidates. Ed Zschau out
spent Martin Carnoy by 4-to-l, but
Zschau still did worse in 1984 as an
incumbent than he had in 1982 as an
unknown private citizen. Arlen
Gregorio came within 4 percentage
points of winning a district which the

state legislature had designed expect
ing any Republican to win by at least
15 points. The unexpectedly good
showings of Carnoy and Gregorio can
be in part attributed to the large mar
gins rolled up here at Stanford, as
well as to the work done for them by
Stanford volunteers in the commu
nity.
In sum, the liberal activists at Stan
ford could not swing the votes of the
whole country. But we did have a
dramatic impact here and in the sur
rounding communities, and Stanford
is a better place to live because of it.
And there is still hope. If we. can
make a difference here, we can make
a difference anywhere.

There was not a lot of good news
election night for the liberals of Stan
ford University. Not only did Walter
Mondale lose in a rout, local
Democrats Martin Carnoy and Arlen
Gregorio also went down to defeat.
But there may be a silver lining in
even so dismal a black cloud.
Last spring, the liberal groups at
Stanford were small and isolated. In a

VIEWPOINT

head-to-head poll, Walter Mondale
appeared to be headed to a 40-
percent-to-60-percent loss to President
Reagan on the Stanford campus.
Many liberals felt alienated and alone
at the soon-to-be home of the
Reagan library.
But the liberals of Stanford refused
to concede defeat. Last spring, exist
ing groups began to work together
with several new organizations dedi
cated to reversing the Republican
tide. Among other things, the anti-
Reagan groups held more than a
dozen dorm meetings, raised funds,
brought speakers to campus, worked
at conferences, sold buttons, dis
tributed literature and made contacts
across the state. Over the summer,
Stanford students worked on a voter
