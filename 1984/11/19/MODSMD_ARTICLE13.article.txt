Make a difference
In the editorial "Remember the
hungry" (The Daily, Nov. 13),
you've got it right! People are starv
ing all over the world — not just in
Ethiopia. It's about time we face that
grim fact. People are starving at
home; people are starving abroad.
The world is filled with misery —
and we can do something.
It is usually at this point that we
Stanford students fold up the paper,
toss it aside and go to Green to study
... or to The Goose. It's under
standable that we do that. The prob
lem is very far away. We all know
that sending the leftovers from Stern
food service could do more harm
than good. We may not have the
desire or ability to send money. In
the end we just decide that there is
nothing we can do.
Wrong!
We may be far away from Et
hiopia, but hunger exists nearby.
East Palo Alto, a very poor and
often hungry community, is only on
the other side of Highway 101. The
Stanford Volunteer Network has a
large number of positions available
(without a big time commitment) in
which students can "make a differ
ence." So if you're thinking that
there's no way you can help, you're
kidding yourself.
You're more interested in the
global hunger situation? I'm not out
of suggestions yet. This spring Stan
ford will host a week-long confer
ence entitled "You Can Make A
Difference — 1985: World and
Local Hunger." This conference is

aimed at educating the Stanford
population on issues of hunger and
at presenting ways that individuals
might be able to devote an hour, a
day, a summer or a lifetime to fight
ing hunger. Get involved in the
conference — merely by helping to
put the conference on you are
making a difference. You may dis
cover ways to help that you never
dreamed of before.
The time has ended when you can
claim that there is simply nothing
you can do. Fast tomorrow. Listen to
the speakers who will be here as part
of the Fast Day program. Visit the
Volunteer Network. Call the office
for the hunger conference (497-
0992). You really can "make a dif
ference" — and it's about time you
start.

Non-partisan GLAS
In his letter on ASSU funding for
voluntary student organizations (The
Daily. Nov. 13), Gregory Kennedy
asks, "Who could say that SPA,
STAR and perhaps even GLAS are
non-partisan . . . ?" While I cannot
speak for the Stanford Progressive
Alliance or Students Against
Reaganism, I believe I can answer
Kennedy with regard to the Gay and
Lesbian Alliance at Stanford: Since
its founding in November 1970 as
the Gay Students Union, GLAS has
always been a strictly and explicitly
non-partisan organization.
No party affiliation is required of
members in the GLAS constitution,

nor is any expected in practice; by
policy the organization has declined
involvement of any sort in partisan
political campaigns — even though
such activity is permitted in certain
forms under University regulations
(see "Operating Policies Regarding
Voluntary Organizations" and
"Guidelines for Political Activities
on the Stanford Campus," both
available at Student Organization
Services in Tresidder Union).
I should perhaps point out that
GLAS does lobby for or against
legislation and other govermental
actions which directly and specifi
cally affect the lesbian, gay and
bisexual community. In the past
year, for instance, we have opposed
on civil-rights grounds the forced
closing of gay bathhouses in San
Francisco and have worked for pas
sage of two bills in the California
legislature: AB-1, which would have
prohibited discrimination on the
basis of sexual orientation in em
ployment, and AB-848, which added
the categories of sexual orientation,
age and handicap to the Ralph Civil
Rights Act.
Lest one imagine that GLAS'
efforts in behalf of these bills
represents organizing in favor of the
Democratic Party, let me add that
Republican state Sens. Milton Marks
and Ed Davis were among the
strongest supporters of the measures;
Republican Gov. George Deuk
mejian vetoed AB-1 but signed
AB-848. Republican, Democratic
and non-aligned gay and non-gay
groups have joined GLAS in
denouncing the bathhouse ban.

Clearly, it would require deliberate
distortion, indeed willful perversity,
to characterize taking a position on
public issues of these sorts as
"partisan" activity.
As for Kennedy's rather quaint
claim that GLAS is "immoral and
threatening to the well-being of
society itself," one can only ask if
people exercising their constitutional
rights of privacy, freedom of associa
tion and freedom of speech to pro
vide one another with social support
— and the campus as a whole with
cultural and educational activities —
may be regarded rightly as engaging
in immorality and disruption. GLAS
has been around for nearly 15 years
now and it doesn't seem to have
undermined society yet; it is,
however, abundantly guilty of having
disturbed the blissful ignorance and
preconceived notions of not a few
unthinking individuals on both the
right and the left of the political
spectrum.
In closing, I should like to encour
age Kennedy, who signs himself as
an undeclared freshman, to take
advantage of his remaining years at
Stanford to broaden his perspective
by learning a bit about the lives of
bisexuals, lesbians and gay men
(perhaps a visit to his residence by
the Stanford Gay and Lesbian
Speakers Bureau would be in order).
The University offers us few greater
opportunities than such possibilities
for developing a more embracing,
respectful and empathetic sense of
humanity.
