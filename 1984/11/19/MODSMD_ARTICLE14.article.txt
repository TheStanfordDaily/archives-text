## Reagan mandate? 
### 
Since the election, the fact that President Reagan won
in a "landslide" has been widely accepted. Unquestion
ably, Reagan won 500-odd electoral votes, while Walter
Mondale won 13, and that's not exactly a close race.
Nevertheless, there are some questions about the na
ture and meaning of the election that remain unanswered.
Reagan said his huge margin of victory signals a mandate
from the American people; Vice President George Bush
said the same thing. Speaker of the House Thomas "Tip"
O'Neill (D-Mass.), on the other hand, said "there is no
mandate out there." Columnist Joseph Kraft said
Reagan's win was a landslide but not a mandate. Is there a
mandate out there or isn't there?
Technically, a mandate is authority given to someone to
perform a certain task. By that definition, every president
has a mandate, as does every senator and congressman.
But here mandate is a stronger term implying an enor
mous pledge of support. The significance of such a pledge
is that it provides an additional leeway in implementing
the authorized tasks. Therefore, Reagan's perception of a
mandate will likely influence his policies. He has already
promised to "take his case to the people" should Congress
deny him his objectives.
I think the question "did Reagan receive a mandate?"
can be answered pretty simply with a pseudo
mathematical model. If we create a formula for
"mandate," we could test it to see if the 1984 election sta
tistics equal a mandate or not. Testing with a model can
also divorce the question from political views, since it's
clear that on the whole, Democrats claim there is no
mandate, while Reaganites claim that there is.
Mandate is a strong word, so the test formula should be
something on the order of mandate equals 60 percent of
the American constituency supports Reagan for presi
dent. If the election evidence satisfies the formula's
criteria, we can settle the question and affirm that "there
is a mandate out there."
Reagan won 525 electoral votes on Nov. 6. Translated
into popular vote that is approximately 60 percent of the
votes cast. Luckily for President Reagan, that majority
support was spread very evenly across the states, but the
distribution isn't really important here. There are approx
imately 100 million registered voters in the United States.
Fifty-two percent of that 100 million actually voted, so the
total number of voters in the 1984 presidential election
was roughly 52 million. Of those 52 million, 60 percent,
or about 31.2 million voted for the Reagan-Bush Repub
lican ticket.
In other words, 31.2 million Americans out of the ap
proximately 250 million total U.S. population voted for
Ronald Reagan. In percentage terms, that's roughly 31
percent of the registered voters, and 12.5 percent of the
total American constituency. Going back to the mandate
model, Reagan's votes don't come close to satisfying the
more-than-60-percent-of-the-constituency requirement
for achieving a "mandate" from the American people.
This model is obviously very simple, and the numbers
I've used are approximations, but the point is clear.

Reagan's enormous electoral college win does not
translate into an indisputable show of support from the
U.S. public. It in no way signifies a mandate.
Critics of this model might say it doesn't take into ac
count that the support demonstrated by those Americans
who did vote for Reagan is representative of the rest of
the population, in the same way that polls infer about the
attitudes of all Americans based only on a very limited
sample. While that may be true to a certain degree, it does
not hold absolutely because voting is in no way a random
sample or a random event. Voting, and the means by
which Americans vote, has built-in biases. The elderly,
disabled and poor are not as likely to vote as the average
college student or housewife who has both the means and
time to get to a polling place with a minimum of inconven
ience. Therefore, we cannot be certain that those who did
vote are necessarily representative of those who did not.
There are other ways to test whether or not a mandate
occurs in American politics, but here too Reagan fails the

mandate test. A mandate was denoted in 1980 in part by
the large number of seats that turned over to the
Republicans in the Congress. The Reagan coattails were
long enough to give the Republicans a majority in the
Senate and a large number of new seats in the House. Ad
ditionally, the mandate was strong enough to influence
conservative Democrats' votes in the House, and enabled
Reagan to pass his first budgets with relative ease.
But Reagan didn't have significant coattails this time
around. Modest Republican gains in the House were off
set by losses in the Senate. Any House gains were also
tempered by the 26 seats the Democrats won in the 1982
congressional election. Additionally, the number of
Democrats voting in favor of Reagan policies in the
House has decreased notably since 1981.
It is apparent that any congressional obstruction of ad
ministration proposals will not be seen as an obstruction
of the will of the American people, as the president has al
leged. The next four years are likely to be filled with
executive-legislative tensions across a number of issues.
But don't be fooled that Congress is the "bad guy." The
tensions will be the result of the mixed signals the election
produced, mixed signals which denounce the notion of
any mandate in American voting. Electoral College
landslide and Republican evaluation aside, there simply
"is no mandate out there."

mandate test. A mandate was denoted in 1980 in part by
the large number of seats that turned over to the
Republicans in the Congress. The Reagan coattails were
long enough to give the Republicans a majority in the
Senate and a large number of new seats in the House. Ad
ditionally, the mandate was strong enough to influence
conservative Democrats' votes in the House, and enabled
Reagan to pass his first budgets with relative ease.
But Reagan didn't have significant coattails this time
around. Modest Republican gains in the House were off
set by losses in the Senate. Any House gains were also
tempered by the 26 seats the Democrats won in the 1982
congressional election. Additionally, the number of
Democrats voting in favor of Reagan policies in the
House has decreased notably since 1981.
It is apparent that any congressional obstruction of ad
ministration proposals will not be seen as an obstruction
of the will of the American people, as the president has al
leged. The next four years are likely to be filled with
executive-legislative tensions across a number of issues.
But don't be fooled that Congress is the "bad guy." The
tensions will be the result of the mixed signals the election
produced, mixed signals which denounce the notion of
any mandate in American voting. Electoral College
landslide and Republican evaluation aside, there simply
"is no mandate out there."

Since the election, the fact that President Reagan won
in a "landslide" has been widely accepted. Unquestion
ably, Reagan won 500-odd electoral votes, while Walter
Mondale won 13, and that's not exactly a close race.
Nevertheless, there are some questions about the na
ture and meaning of the election that remain unanswered.
Reagan said his huge margin of victory signals a mandate
from the American people; Vice President George Bush
said the same thing. Speaker of the House Thomas "Tip"
O'Neill (D-Mass.), on the other hand, said "there is no
mandate out there." Columnist Joseph Kraft said
Reagan's win was a landslide but not a mandate. Is there a
mandate out there or isn't there?
Technically, a mandate is authority given to someone to
perform a certain task. By that definition, every president
has a mandate, as does every senator and congressman.
But here mandate is a stronger term implying an enor
mous pledge of support. The significance of such a pledge
is that it provides an additional leeway in implementing
the authorized tasks. Therefore, Reagan's perception of a
mandate will likely influence his policies. He has already
promised to "take his case to the people" should Congress
deny him his objectives.
I think the question "did Reagan receive a mandate?"
can be answered pretty simply with a pseudo
mathematical model. If we create a formula for
"mandate," we could test it to see if the 1984 election sta
tistics equal a mandate or not. Testing with a model can
also divorce the question from political views, since it's
clear that on the whole, Democrats claim there is no
mandate, while Reaganites claim that there is.
Mandate is a strong word, so the test formula should be
something on the order of mandate equals 60 percent of
the American constituency supports Reagan for presi
dent. If the election evidence satisfies the formula's
criteria, we can settle the question and affirm that "there
is a mandate out there."
Reagan won 525 electoral votes on Nov. 6. Translated
into popular vote that is approximately 60 percent of the
votes cast. Luckily for President Reagan, that majority
support was spread very evenly across the states, but the
distribution isn't really important here. There are approx
imately 100 million registered voters in the United States.
Fifty-two percent of that 100 million actually voted, so the
total number of voters in the 1984 presidential election
was roughly 52 million. Of those 52 million, 60 percent,
or about 31.2 million voted for the Reagan-Bush Repub
lican ticket.
In other words, 31.2 million Americans out of the ap
proximately 250 million total U.S. population voted for
Ronald Reagan. In percentage terms, that's roughly 31
percent of the registered voters, and 12.5 percent of the
total American constituency. Going back to the mandate
model, Reagan's votes don't come close to satisfying the
more-than-60-percent-of-the-constituency requirement
for achieving a "mandate" from the American people.
This model is obviously very simple, and the numbers
I've used are approximations, but the point is clear.

Reagan's enormous electoral college win does not
translate into an indisputable show of support from the
U.S. public. It in no way signifies a mandate.
Critics of this model might say it doesn't take into ac
count that the support demonstrated by those Americans
who did vote for Reagan is representative of the rest of
the population, in the same way that polls infer about the
attitudes of all Americans based only on a very limited
sample. While that may be true to a certain degree, it does
not hold absolutely because voting is in no way a random
sample or a random event. Voting, and the means by
which Americans vote, has built-in biases. The elderly,
disabled and poor are not as likely to vote as the average
college student or housewife who has both the means and
time to get to a polling place with a minimum of inconven
ience. Therefore, we cannot be certain that those who did
vote are necessarily representative of those who did not.
