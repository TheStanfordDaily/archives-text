# Recalls arrest
## Alarcon looks to the future 
### KENT MILLER 
The past two months have aged
Francisco Alarcon.
"I went to my barber in the Mission
District and had my hair cut and he
immediately noticed my gray hairs,"
he says.
In August, the 30-year-old doc
toral candidate in Hispanic literature
was hoping to finish his dissertation
on the contemporary Mexican short
story so that he could graduate in
June.
In September, the poet/scholar was
arrested by San Francisco police and
charged with giving marijuana to two
minors and molesting one of them.
The police also wanted to question
him about the murder of Ted Gomez,
15, of Alameda, whose stabbed body
was found in Golden Gate Park Sept.
22.
On Oct. 16, he was cleared of all
charges when a prosecution witness
failed to show up at a hearing. In the
same month, William Melvin White,
a 41-year-old ex-convict and drifter,
confessed to killing Gomez and also
to killing another teenage boy in San
Francisco last May.
Alarcon, who looks like a professor
in his bulky sweater jacket and wire
rimmed glasses, speaks softly about
his arrest. Because he could not post
$500,000 bail, he spent six days in
San Francisco County Jail. "I think
the experience of a person in jail is
horrifying," he says. "They would not
provide me with paper to write on.
Alarcon managed to write poems on
borrowed cardboard. One of them is
"Absurd":
"I want to assure my friends and
visitors that I'm not. . . / (a) character
in a Kafka story. . .."
Assistant District Attorney
William Fazio says the bail was not
too high. "He was a suspect in a mur
der case," Fazio says. Alarcon was
released when a judge lowered his
bail to $5,000.
Fazio says he might have Alarcon

arrested again on the child molesta
tion charges if the key prosecution
witness— a runaway 13-year-old boy
— turns up.
Alarcon says he has had experience
with prisons before his arrest. While
working on a book of poetry,
"Tattoos," last summer, Alarcon
took a job as a tour guide at Alcatraz.
He estimates that he gave more than
300 tours of the former federal prison
in the Bay. The first poem in
"Tattoos" — written before his arrest
— is "Dreams of a California Poet in
Prison." The book will be published
soon by the University of California
Press.
"I don't feel like a victim," Alarcon
says. "I'm not depressed." Alarcon
has been active as a job counselor for
youths and an editor in the Mission
District of San Francisco. "I'd like to
fulfill a vision I have to be a creative
writer as well as a critic as well as a
community activist."
Still, he is considering taking legal
action against the police department.
He says Hispanics are often treated
unfairly by the San Francisco police.
"If I were an unemployed Latino,
I'd probably be nailed for life," he
says. "El Tecolote (a bilingual news
paper that Alarcon helps edit) has
been very outspoken against police
brutality in the Mission District."
Officer Louis Doran, liaison for the
police department with the Mission
District, says Alarcon has a point. "I
know there have been incidents of
police brutality in the Mission Dis
trict," he says.
Doran adds that Capt. Vic Macia of
the Mission Station is working on the
problem. "I think he's really clamped
down on the station," Doran says.
Alarcon says reporters treated him
unfairly. "The media really enjoys
the glum, gloomy aspect of the
news," he says. He expressed his
feelings in another poem written in

Fernando Alegria, professor of
Spanish and Portuguese here and
Alarcon's dissertation adviser, has
known Alarcon for seven years.
"Francisco came here as a very
promising student," Alegria says.
"He has done brilliant work in the
department."
Alarcon spent 1982-83 in Mexico,
researching his dissertation on a
Fulbright Fellowship. Last year he
taught Introduction to Chicano Aes
thetics, an undergraduate course at
Stanford.
Alarcon says many people have
supported him. Stanford students and
professors visited him when he was in
jail, he says."I had a lot of people
praying for me all over the state." A
fund-raiser this month in San Fran
cisco helped raise some of the
$10,000 in legal fees and other ex
penses that he owes.
Alarcon's family has helped him,
too. "We're a traditional, big, strong
Chicano family," he says. One of
Alarcon's younger brothers, a student
at the University of Southern Califor
nia, came to San Francisco and
helped organize Alarcon's defense.

The past two months have aged
Francisco Alarcon.
"I went to my barber in the Mission
District and had my hair cut and he
immediately noticed my gray hairs,"
he says.
In August, the 30-year-old doc
toral candidate in Hispanic literature
was hoping to finish his dissertation
on the contemporary Mexican short
story so that he could graduate in
June.
In September, the poet/scholar was
arrested by San Francisco police and
charged with giving marijuana to two
minors and molesting one of them.
The police also wanted to question
him about the murder of Ted Gomez,
15, of Alameda, whose stabbed body
was found in Golden Gate Park Sept.
22.
On Oct. 16, he was cleared of all
charges when a prosecution witness
failed to show up at a hearing. In the
same month, William Melvin White,
a 41-year-old ex-convict and drifter,
confessed to killing Gomez and also
to killing another teenage boy in San
Francisco last May.
Alarcon, who looks like a professor
in his bulky sweater jacket and wire
rimmed glasses, speaks softly about
his arrest. Because he could not post
$500,000 bail, he spent six days in
San Francisco County Jail. "I think
the experience of a person in jail is
horrifying," he says. "They would not
provide me with paper to write on.
Alarcon managed to write poems on
borrowed cardboard. One of them is
"Absurd":
"I want to assure my friends and
visitors that I'm not. . . / (a) character
in a Kafka story. . .."
Assistant District Attorney
William Fazio says the bail was not
too high. "He was a suspect in a mur
der case," Fazio says. Alarcon was
released when a judge lowered his
bail to $5,000.
Fazio says he might have Alarcon

arrested again on the child molesta
tion charges if the key prosecution
witness— a runaway 13-year-old boy
— turns up.
Alarcon says he has had experience
with prisons before his arrest. While
working on a book of poetry,
"Tattoos," last summer, Alarcon
took a job as a tour guide at Alcatraz.
He estimates that he gave more than
300 tours of the former federal prison
in the Bay. The first poem in
"Tattoos" — written before his arrest
— is "Dreams of a California Poet in
Prison." The book will be published
soon by the University of California
Press.
"I don't feel like a victim," Alarcon
says. "I'm not depressed." Alarcon
has been active as a job counselor for
youths and an editor in the Mission
District of San Francisco. "I'd like to
fulfill a vision I have to be a creative
writer as well as a critic as well as a
community activist."
Still, he is considering taking legal
action against the police department.
He says Hispanics are often treated
unfairly by the San Francisco police.
"If I were an unemployed Latino,
I'd probably be nailed for life," he
says. "El Tecolote (a bilingual news
paper that Alarcon helps edit) has
been very outspoken against police
brutality in the Mission District."
Officer Louis Doran, liaison for the
police department with the Mission
District, says Alarcon has a point. "I
know there have been incidents of
police brutality in the Mission Dis
trict," he says.
Doran adds that Capt. Vic Macia of
the Mission Station is working on the
problem. "I think he's really clamped
down on the station," Doran says.
Alarcon says reporters treated him
unfairly. "The media really enjoys
the glum, gloomy aspect of the
news," he says. He expressed his
feelings in another poem written in

Fernando Alegria, professor of
Spanish and Portuguese here and
Alarcon's dissertation adviser, has
known Alarcon for seven years.
"Francisco came here as a very
promising student," Alegria says.
"He has done brilliant work in the
department."
Alarcon spent 1982-83 in Mexico,
researching his dissertation on a
Fulbright Fellowship. Last year he
taught Introduction to Chicano Aes
thetics, an undergraduate course at
Stanford.
Alarcon says many people have
supported him. Stanford students and
professors visited him when he was in
jail, he says."I had a lot of people
praying for me all over the state." A
fund-raiser this month in San Fran
cisco helped raise some of the
$10,000 in legal fees and other ex
penses that he owes.
Alarcon's family has helped him,
too. "We're a traditional, big, strong
Chicano family," he says. One of
Alarcon's younger brothers, a student
at the University of Southern Califor
nia, came to San Francisco and
helped organize Alarcon's defense.
