## Stanford benefits from genetic patents 
### NIKO SCHIFF 
This is the second part of a two-part
series on the recently awarded Cohen-
Boyer genetic products patent.
Awarded this August, the second
Cohen-Boyer patent covering the
products derived from gene recom
bination has solidified Stanford's hold
on the fledgling biotechnology indus
try.
Together with a companion patent
awarded in 1980, covering the basic
processes of gene recombination, the
patents give Stanford a proprietary
position over the basic methodology
and tools used throughout the
biotechnology industry until 1997.
The first patent gave Stanford the
right to license companies to use the
Cohen-Boyer technique, which is
fundamental to most genetic engi
neering research. "As of early Au
gust, 66 companies had licenses, but
we now expect that all other compan
ies doing commercial research will
also take licenses," said Technology
Licensing Associate Director Kath
arine Ku. The use of the Cohen-
Boyer technique in pure research is
not restricted.
The new product patent
strengthens the rights gained in the
first patent. Companies that have
held back from paying the $10,000
annual licensing fee pending the deci
sion on the product's patent will now
be obligated to pay the fee.
The University will now enforce
the claims of both Cohen-Boyer
patents. "We expect all other com
panies doing commercial research
will also take licenses," said Ku.
Companies already licensed for the
first patent will automatically be
licensed for the new patent.
"Stanford and the University of
California share the revenues accrued
through the licensing of these patents.
So far, they have received slightly less
than $3 million," said Niels Reimers,
director of Stanford's office of tech
nology licensing.
Stanley Cohen and Herbert Boyer,
the patent's co-inventors, are entitled
to a one-third share of the revenue.
Both have, however, waived their
rights to personal royalties. The
money from the royalties is used for
educational and research purposes,
Reimers said.
According to Ku, the cost of the
licensing fee itself is modest, but the
royalties accrued from the products
patent are likely to be quite large.

"To date, many scientific research
products derived using the patented
invention have become commercially
available, although only one phar
maceutical product is out for sale to
the public," Ku said.
This product is a bacterially
produced form of human insulin
called "Humulin." It was developed
by Genentech and marketed by Eli
Lilly and Co. of Indianapolis.
Industries are bringing other genet

ically engineered products into the
market, including a hepatitis-B
vaccine, human interferon, a human
growth hormone and a drug for treat
ing emphysema, Ku added.
As commercial products become
more widely available, Stanford's
revenues will increase considerably.
By the end of the decade, it is ex
pected that revenues from licenses
and royalties could rise to tens of mil
lions of dollars. "I hope it will be sub
stantial," said Roger Ditzel, director

of the Patent, Trademark and
Copyright Office for the University of
California.
The licensed products from which
Stanford receives royalties fall into
four categories: end products, bulk
products, basic genetic products and
process-improvement products.
End products are goods sold in a
finished form for utilization by the ul
timate consumer. Examples of this
type of product include micro

organisms sold in large quantity to en
hance oil recovery in oil fields or to
biodegrade organic waste or petro
leum by-products.
Products such as "Humulin" also
fall into the end-product category.
Stanford and the University of Cali
fornia share royalties from these
products at the rate of 1 percent for
the first $5 million of sales decreasing
to one-half percent on sales over $10
million.
Bulk products are genetically en

gineered products intended for fur
ther processing or transformation. An
example would be a micro-organism
having the ability to draw nitrogen, a
plant nutrient, out of the air, which is
sold to an agricultural seed company
for combination with seed.
Royalties on these bulk products
start at 3 percent for the first $5 mil
lion of sales and decrease to 1 percent
on sales of more than $10 million.
Basic genetic products are products
that do not qualify as bulk or end
products; they are products used di
rectly in the process of genetic engi
neering â€” for example, a particular
plasmid used in recombination. Stan
ford will receive a 10-percent royalty
on these products through the dura
tion of the patent.
The final category is process
improvement products. These are
products developed by a licensee in
its manufacturing processes that en
hance production efficiency.
An example of a product that can
be produced expediently is a micro
organism developed by a chemical
company and used in the
manufacture of the chemical com
pound ethylene glycol, previously
produced via a conventional chemical
process. For the duration of the pat
ent, Stanford will receive a 10-
percent royalty on the cost-saving
and economic benefit of the process
improvement.
At this point the Patent Office has
granted all the claims Stanford has re
quested, except the extension of the
patent to more complex unicellular
organisms called eucaryotes.
To allow the current patent to be
issued as rapidly as possible, Stanford
withdrew claims covering the use of
the spliced DNA molecules in
"eucaryotes" such as yeast, Ku said.
These claims, which will give Stan
ford an even broader coverage of the
industry, are being pursued in a third
patent application still pending.
The question raised over the third
patent is whether or not eucaryotes
were considered when the original
patent application was filed. Stan
ford's attorney, Bertram Rowland,
argues that the claim should be in
cluded. While the words "unicellular
eluded. While the words "unicell
ular micro-organisms," read
application in 1974, they were in
cluded in 1976 and were "inherent"
in the first application.

nology licensing.
Stanley Cohen and Herbert Boyer,
the patent's co-inventors, are entitled
to a one-third share of the revenue.
Both have, however, waived their
rights to personal royalties. The
money from the royalties is used for
educational and research purposes,
Reimers said.
According to Ku, the cost of the
licensing fee itself is modest, but the
royalties accrued from the products
patent are likely to be quite large.

"To date, many scientific research
products derived using the patented
invention have become commercially
available, although only one phar
maceutical product is out for sale to
the public," Ku said.
This product is a bacterially
produced form of human insulin
called "Humulin." It was developed
by Genentech and marketed by Eli
Lilly and Co. of Indianapolis.
Industries are bringing other genet

ically engineered products into the
market, including a hepatitis-B
vaccine, human interferon, a human
growth hormone and a drug for treat
ing emphysema, Ku added.
As commercial products become
more widely available, Stanford's
revenues will increase considerably.
By the end of the decade, it is ex
pected that revenues from licenses
and royalties could rise to tens of mil
lions of dollars. "I hope it will be sub
stantial," said Roger Ditzel, director

of the Patent, Trademark and
Copyright Office for the University of
California.
The licensed products from which
Stanford receives royalties fall into
four categories: end products, bulk
products, basic genetic products and
process-improvement products.
End products are goods sold in a
finished form for utilization by the ul
timate consumer. Examples of this
type of product include micro

organisms sold in large quantity to en
hance oil recovery in oil fields or to
biodegrade organic waste or petro
leum by-products.
Products such as "Humulin" also
fall into the end-product category.
Stanford and the University of Cali
fornia share royalties from these
products at the rate of 1 percent for
the first $5 million of sales decreasing
to one-half percent on sales over $10
million.
Bulk products are genetically en

gineered products intended for fur
ther processing or transformation. An
example would be a micro-organism
having the ability to draw nitrogen, a
plant nutrient, out of the air, which is
sold to an agricultural seed company
for combination with seed.
Royalties on these bulk products
start at 3 percent for the first $5 mil
lion of sales and decrease to 1 percent
on sales of more than $10 million.
Basic genetic products are products
that do not qualify as bulk or end
products; they are products used di
rectly in the process of genetic engi
neering â€” for example, a particular
plasmid used in recombination. Stan
ford will receive a 10-percent royalty
on these products through the dura
tion of the patent.
The final category is process
improvement products. These are
products developed by a licensee in
its manufacturing processes that en
hance production efficiency.
An example of a product that can
be produced expediently is a micro
organism developed by a chemical
company and used in the
manufacture of the chemical com
pound ethylene glycol, previously
produced via a conventional chemical
process. For the duration of the pat
ent, Stanford will receive a 10-
percent royalty on the cost-saving
and economic benefit of the process
improvement.
At this point the Patent Office has
granted all the claims Stanford has re
quested, except the extension of the
patent to more complex unicellular
organisms called eucaryotes.
To allow the current patent to be
issued as rapidly as possible, Stanford
withdrew claims covering the use of
the spliced DNA molecules in
"eucaryotes" such as yeast, Ku said.
These claims, which will give Stan
ford an even broader coverage of the
industry, are being pursued in a third
patent application still pending.
The question raised over the third
patent is whether or not eucaryotes
were considered when the original
patent application was filed. Stan
ford's attorney, Bertram Rowland,
argues that the claim should be in
cluded. While the words "unicellular
eluded. While the words "unicell
ular micro-organisms," read
application in 1974, they were in
cluded in 1976 and were "inherent"
in the first application.

This is the second part of a two-part
series on the recently awarded Cohen-
Boyer genetic products patent.
Awarded this August, the second
Cohen-Boyer patent covering the
products derived from gene recom
bination has solidified Stanford's hold
on the fledgling biotechnology indus
try.
Together with a companion patent
awarded in 1980, covering the basic
processes of gene recombination, the
patents give Stanford a proprietary
position over the basic methodology
and tools used throughout the
biotechnology industry until 1997.
The first patent gave Stanford the
right to license companies to use the
Cohen-Boyer technique, which is
fundamental to most genetic engi
neering research. "As of early Au
gust, 66 companies had licenses, but
we now expect that all other compan
ies doing commercial research will
also take licenses," said Technology
Licensing Associate Director Kath
arine Ku. The use of the Cohen-
Boyer technique in pure research is
not restricted.
The new product patent
strengthens the rights gained in the
first patent. Companies that have
held back from paying the $10,000
annual licensing fee pending the deci
sion on the product's patent will now
be obligated to pay the fee.
The University will now enforce
the claims of both Cohen-Boyer
patents. "We expect all other com
panies doing commercial research
will also take licenses," said Ku.
Companies already licensed for the
first patent will automatically be
licensed for the new patent.
"Stanford and the University of
California share the revenues accrued
through the licensing of these patents.
So far, they have received slightly less
than $3 million," said Niels Reimers,
director of Stanford's office of tech
nology licensing.
Stanley Cohen and Herbert Boyer,
the patent's co-inventors, are entitled
to a one-third share of the revenue.
