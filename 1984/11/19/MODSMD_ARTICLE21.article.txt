# Amigos program: more than just friends to underdeveloped places
## 
### MARK LAWRENCE 
Ahh, summer vacation.
For some students, just the sound of those words
conjures up images of warm days at the beach,
sleeping late and enjoyment of all the little luxuries
missed out on during the school year. For others, it
means a 40-hour work week in an office.
But, for nearly 10,000 adventurous volunteers
since 1965, summer vacation has meant living in
one-room jungle shacks, eating a steady diet of tor
tillas and beans and doing public health and sanita
tion projects in Latin America.
For 20 years, Amigos de las Americas, a private
organization based in Houston, Texas, has worked
in conjunction with Central and South American
ministries of health. The organization provides un
derdeveloped regions with aid ranging from eye
glass screening and vaccinations to latrine-building
instruction.
This summer alone, Amigos volunteers in seven
Latin American countries list among their ac
complishments 32,798 human immunizations,
5,849 vision patients screened, 93,321 dental
hygiene instructions and the construction of 650
latrines.
"This aid program does a great deal. It lets high
school and college kids do something rewarding —
these are kids who might otherwise be working in
McDonald's," said junior Carol Young, who was
an Amigos volunteer in Mexico and Honduras for
two summers during high shool.

seven months before the volunteers ever set foot in
their project sites.
Three-hour classes are held every week at the 30
Amigos chapters around the United States, and by

the time the projects begin, students have had 125
hours of instruction.
Senior Thorn Daniels, who participated in Hon
duras for two summers during high school, said that
volunteers need to be "hard working and industri
ous." He said that these qualities are necessary for
one to complete the training, and to be prepared
for the challenge of four or eight weeks in a Latin
American town with only one or two other
Americans.
According to junior Grace Howell, "You've got
to be tough and extremely resourceful as well." She
volunteered after her junior year in high school.
Despite the extensive training, when she finally
arrived in Mexico, Howell felt culture shock and
wondered, "What am 1 doing here?"
"There was absolutely nothing. In the health
center there wasn't even running water. All the
possessions 1 brought were more than whole
families had," she said. She added that it was
primitive to the point of "really surviving — every
thing's just not so easy. You couldn't just walk to
the sink and turn on the water."
Those who participate in the program learned
about survival — their own and that of people in
underdeveloped countries. For most, it is an eye
opening experience. One participant said, "When I
came back to Stanford, I couldn't really get into it.
The images of those people in South America just
stuck in my mind — all of my minor problems and
daily crises seem so trivial compared to theirs."
