## Muster, Cardinal dominate while Bears hibernate, 27-10 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
BERKELEY — There were no five-lateral kickoff
returns this time at Memorial Stadium. Only Brad Muster,
Brad Muster and Brad Muster.
And Brad Muster.
California knew it had to stop Stanford's sophomore
fullback Saturday. It didn't, and Stanford won the 87th
Big Game, 27-10, before a sellout crowd of 75,662. It was
as simple as that.
Muster, a redshirt sophomore playing in his first Big
Game, rushed 34 times for 204 yards. His 34 carries tied a
Stanford single-game record set by Ernie Nevers in the
1925 Rose Bowl. The 204 yards were seven shy of Darrin
Nelson's school record set in 1977.
"This was the biggest win of my career. There were a
thousand reasons to win it," said Stanford Coach Jack El
way, who lit his customary post-game cigarette but was
too elated to smoke it. "I'm a little emotional right now.
I'll have to find my sense of humor again."
One of the thousand reasons for Elway and company to
win Big Game 1984 was Big Game 1982, when the
famous-to-Cal and infamous-to-Stanford five-lateral
kickoff return on the game's final play beat the Cardinal,
25-20. Another was to get the Axe back after two years in
Berkeley. A third was to finish Elway's debut season on a
winning note.
About the only thing Stanford didn't get was a winning
season, and the Cardinal ended the year 5-6 overall and
3-5 in the Pacific 10 Conference, tied for seventh with the
University of Oregon. Fourth-year seniors left the Farm
having played on four losing teams.
Cal also finished the season with a losing record, but
that's where the similarities of records end. The Bears
finished last in the Pac-10 at 1-8 and 2-9 overall, their
worst record since they were 2-9 in 1981.
Third-year Cal Coach Joe Kapp, who lost his first Big
Game as a coach, made no excuses for his team or for

himself. "Stanford earned this victory,'' he said. "I won |
say anything to take that away from them. I hope they enj
joy the party."
But Stanford didn't turn out the lights and end Cal s.
party early in the game. In fact, it looked as if it would l>«
the other way around with 13:07 remaining in the fiisi
half. That was when Bear quarterback Gale Gilbert found
receiver Keith Cockett in the end zone to cap a 49-yarcJ
drive and give the Bears a 10-0 lead.
The Cal drive started after Muster fumbled, just one of
many early mistakes by a Stanford team overzealous to
get revenge for 1982.
"We're kind of used to that," Elway said in reference to
first-quarter mistakes. "When we self-destructed and they
only got 10 points, then I knew that we were going to have
a hell of a game."
It was on Stanford's next series that Elway played his
ace Card. Elway gave the hook to starting quarterback
Fred Buckley and inserted finger-injury-plagued sopho
more John Paye, whose status was kept secret all week.
Although Paye, playing with a splint on his strained
middle finger, couldn't provide much from a physical
standpoint — Elway said Paye could only throw about 20
yards — he could, and did, from an emotional one.
Stanford scored on five of its first seven possessions
with Paye at the controls and proceeded to run off 27 un
answered points. Paye completed six of 12 passes for 62
yards, but wasn't intercepted and threw one touchdown
pass — his first since the second game of the season.
"I'll tell you what I had in the back of my mind was
USC," Elway said, referring to the game when Paye
returned from one finger injury and started, only to go
down in the first half with another. "I just thought, well,
he'll stand alongside me and I'll make the move when my
stomach says it's right.
"I knew John was going to play and he did some good
things," Elway continued. "He ran the ballclub, he was
fluid and he made a minimum of mistakes."

Stanford cut Cal's lead to 10-6 on a pair of Mark Har
mon field goals, the 49th and 50th of his record-setting
career. The Cardinal went ahead for the first time — and
for good — when receiver Emile Harry made a spectacu
lar diving catch in the left corner of the end zone with five
seconds left in the first half.
Cal had a golden opportunity to at least tie the game on
its first possession of the second half, but came up empty.
I'he Bears had taken the ball 65 yards to the Cardinal 15-
yard line and were facing a fourth down and inches. Kapp
kept placekicker Tom Gansey on the sideline and instead
sent in his short-yardage offense.
"Up until that time, I thought we were successful in
short yardage situations," Kapp said. "I think we crossed
the line for the first down, but the ball was fumbled and it
was marked short of the first down. In a game like this, I
knew we'd have to score a lot of points to win. And we're
playing this thing to win."
Stanford took over at the 15 and marched, literally
marched, 85 yards in 11 plays, nine of which were runs.
Tailback Thomas Henley finished it off with a seven-yard
touchdown run over the right side and it was 20-10. Ten
minutes later, Stanford put the game away when Paye
faked a pitch to Muster and ran it in from a yard out, cap
ping a drive in which seven of the eight plays were of the
running variety.
"We broke all traditions by running the ball," Elway
said. "We told the running backs that they had to run
tough and we had to get physical on the offensive line,"
Elway said. "That was our starting point and we were
going to go from there depending on our success."
Elway never had to make any changes. Cal simply
couldn't stop Muster and sophomore tailback Thomas
Henley, who rushed for an inconspicuous 102 yards in
Muster's shadow.
Although Muster and Henley got the headlines, the
members of Stanford's veteran offensive li .e were the real
heroes. The Cardinal line, which loses four of five starters

to graduation, parted the Cal defense like a certain bibli
cal figure parted a certain body of water.
"We finally got a team that we outmanned and I think
that really showed," left guard Matt Moran said.
"Looking at the films, we knew we could run the ball
against them. Everything was pretty much working. When
one play starts working, it opens up the others because
they (the defenders) start overcompensating."
Statistics like 16 rushing first downs to three passing or
60 rushing attempts to 14 passing point to it, but it wasn't
so. No, that wasn't Ohio State in Stanford uniforms Satur
day.
Card notes
The game ball was given to junior linebacker Dave
Wyman, who dislocated his knee last Saturday against the
University of Arizona. According to Wyman's older broth
er, Mike, Defensive Coordinator Dick Mannini told the
defense, "I want to win this game for Dave and give him a
game ball."
Muster rushed for 823 yards this season, two shy of
what the Cardinal rushed for as a team last season. His
184 carries were 13 short of the single-season Stanford
record. This season, Muster played in nine games and
started seven.
Harry finished with 25 receptions this season, but still
ended his career among Stanford leaders in several
categories. He is third in career reception yardage
(2,270), third in career yards per catch (18.5), sixth in
career receptions (123) and sixth in career touchdown
receptions (15).
Harmon ended his career as Stanford's leading scorer
with 252 points and as the Cardinal's most prolific field
goal kicker with 50.
Paye, a sophomore, passed team physician and former
quarterback Don Bunce Saturday to move into 10th place
on the career passing yardage list with 2,805 yards.

team in 1971, operated on Paye's broken knuckle
