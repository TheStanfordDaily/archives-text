# Newspapers the story behind Cook's play
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
BERKELEY — Stanford corner
back Toi Cook reads the newspaper,
and last week he didn't particularly
like what he read.
He read a San Francisco Chronicle
article that said the Stanford defen
sive secondary has as many holes in it
as swiss cheese. He read a Stanford
Daily article that said the Cardinal
pass defense was "about as effective
as a screen door in a submarine."
But that was nothing compared with
what an East Bay paper wrote. It said
California would pick on Cook and
safety Joe Cain because, among other
things, they simply weren't good.
And as Defensive Coordinator Dick
Mannini told Cook and Cain, "Your
names aren't misspelled" in the arti
cle.
"I just felt like I had to prove that
they're wrong", Cook said after Stan
ford's 27-10 victory over Cal Satur
day. "It just gave me more incentive.
It was like an open challenge — that's
what annoyed me the most.
"I wasn't surprised (about the arti
cle) because I'm a sophomore," Cook
said. "I've played OK, but inconsis

tently. I thought it was the right idea
for them to pick on me, but just at the
wrong time. I've been getting a little
better each game."
Cook improved enough to inter
cept two Gale Gilbert passes and ef
fectively shut down Cal's leading
receiver, Ranee McDougald. Gilbert
completed an 18-yard pass to
McDougald in the first quarter, but
that was it — for the rest of the game.
And all told, Gilbert threw nine
passes intended for McDougald.
"I probably played my best game
ever," an excited Cook said after
ward. "I was on their outs and on
their hooks. I covered them the whole
way."
Gilbert admitted the offensive
game plan was to pick on Cook. "We
thought we could use Ranee's speed
and beat him," Gilbert said. "He's
been getting beat regularly this year,
but he played really well today. I
think he was the MVP of the
defense."
Gilbert's coach, Joe Kapp, told a
different story. "We weren't picking
on him in particular," he said. "It was
just that their defense was aligned
with him on that side."

Cook, however, said he and his
mates in the secondary didn't roll out
the red carpet for the Cal receivers.
"We just dropped back and covered
the receivers," he said. "We really
didn't do anything special."
Cook did do something special on
each of his two interceptions. "On the
first one, I had perfect position," he
said, describing how he jumped in
front of McDougald just as the ball
arrived. "All I had to do was hold on
to the ball."
Cook held on all right, and
returned the ball 14 yards to the Bear
20-yard line. Six plays later, Mark
Harmon kicked a 21-yard field goal
to cut Cal's lead to 10-6 with 4:39
remaining in the first half.
"On the second one, he did an out
and up, and I didn't break on the
out," Cook said. That gave Cook the
inside position on McDougald, so
when the ball arrived, all Cook had to
do was hold on again. Cook inter
cepted this one in the end zone,
giving Stanford the ball on its own 20
with 7:51 left in the game. More im
portant, though, it abruptly halted a
fourth-quarter Cal drive and all but
ended the Bears' chances for a come

back.
But the football field isn't the only
place the 5-foot-11, 175-pound Cook
has starred at Stanford. He plays
baseball, too, and led the Cardinal in
hitting last year with a .348 batting
average, starting 10 games as an out
fielder.
Cook plans to play baseball again
this spring, making Saturday's Big
Game his last chance this season to
prove himself as a football player
before he trades his helmet for a cap.
"He just got better and better as
the season went on," Cardinal Coach
Jack Elway said. "It looked to me like
they were trying to pick on him. And
it didn't work. Thank God for small
favors."
Elway can also be thankful that
Cook, who wore baseball batting
gloves to protect his hands from the
cold, even played Saturday.
"I hurt my neck against Arizona
and the doctor said, 'You can't play
and we want you to wear a neck
brace,' " Cook said. "I wasn't sure I
would be ready and I wasn't allowed
to have contact in practice this week.
"But after reading that article, I
knew I was ready."

way."
Gilbert admitted the offensive
game plan was to pick on Cook. "We
thought we could use Ranee's speed
and beat him," Gilbert said. "He's
been getting beat regularly this year,
but he played really well today. I
think he was the MVP of the
defense."
Gilbert's coach, Joe Kapp, told a
different story. "We weren't picking
on him in particular," he said. "It was
just that their defense was aligned
with him on that side."

Cook, however, said he and his
mates in the secondary didn't roll out
the red carpet for the Cal receivers.
"We just dropped back and covered
the receivers," he said. "We really
didn't do anything special."
Cook did do something special on
each of his two interceptions. "On the
first one, I had perfect position," he
said, describing how he jumped in
front of McDougald just as the ball
arrived. "All I had to do was hold on
to the ball."
Cook held on all right, and
returned the ball 14 yards to the Bear
20-yard line. Six plays later, Mark
Harmon kicked a 21-yard field goal
to cut Cal's lead to 10-6 with 4:39
remaining in the first half.
"On the second one, he did an out
and up, and I didn't break on the
out," Cook said. That gave Cook the
inside position on McDougald, so
when the ball arrived, all Cook had to
do was hold on again. Cook inter
cepted this one in the end zone,
giving Stanford the ball on its own 20
with 7:51 left in the game. More im
portant, though, it abruptly halted a
fourth-quarter Cal drive and all but
ended the Bears' chances for a come

back.
But the football field isn't the only
place the 5-foot-11, 175-pound Cook
has starred at Stanford. He plays
baseball, too, and led the Cardinal in
hitting last year with a .348 batting
average, starting 10 games as an out
fielder.
Cook plans to play baseball again
this spring, making Saturday's Big
Game his last chance this season to
prove himself as a football player
before he trades his helmet for a cap.
"He just got better and better as
the season went on," Cardinal Coach
Jack Elway said. "It looked to me like
they were trying to pick on him. And
it didn't work. Thank God for small
favors."
Elway can also be thankful that
Cook, who wore baseball batting
gloves to protect his hands from the
cold, even played Saturday.
"I hurt my neck against Arizona
and the doctor said, 'You can't play
and we want you to wear a neck
brace,' " Cook said. "I wasn't sure I
would be ready and I wasn't allowed
to have contact in practice this week.
"But after reading that article, I
knew I was ready."

Cardinal cornerback Toi Cook returns one of his two interceptions.
One interception set up Mark Harmon's second-quarter field goal, and
the other killed a Cal drive in the fourth quarter.
BERKELEY — Stanford corner
back Toi Cook reads the newspaper,
and last week he didn't particularly
like what he read.
He read a San Francisco Chronicle
article that said the Stanford defen
sive secondary has as many holes in it
as swiss cheese. He read a Stanford
Daily article that said the Cardinal
pass defense was "about as effective
as a screen door in a submarine."
But that was nothing compared with
what an East Bay paper wrote. It said
California would pick on Cook and
safety Joe Cain because, among other
things, they simply weren't good.
And as Defensive Coordinator Dick
Mannini told Cook and Cain, "Your
names aren't misspelled" in the arti
cle.
"I just felt like I had to prove that
they're wrong", Cook said after Stan
ford's 27-10 victory over Cal Satur
day. "It just gave me more incentive.
It was like an open challenge — that's
what annoyed me the most.
"I wasn't surprised (about the arti
cle) because I'm a sophomore," Cook
said. "I've played OK, but inconsis

tently. I thought it was the right idea
for them to pick on me, but just at the
wrong time. I've been getting a little
better each game."
Cook improved enough to inter
cept two Gale Gilbert passes and ef
fectively shut down Cal's leading
receiver, Ranee McDougald. Gilbert
completed an 18-yard pass to
McDougald in the first quarter, but
that was it — for the rest of the game.
And all told, Gilbert threw nine
passes intended for McDougald.
"I probably played my best game
ever," an excited Cook said after
ward. "I was on their outs and on
their hooks. I covered them the whole
way."
Gilbert admitted the offensive
game plan was to pick on Cook. "We
thought we could use Ranee's speed
and beat him," Gilbert said. "He's
been getting beat regularly this year,
but he played really well today. I
