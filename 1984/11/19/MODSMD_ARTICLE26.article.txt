## Stanford defeats UOP Tigers, loses to Cal 
### INGRID SEYER Staff sportswriter 
I The Stanford water polo team closed out its reg
ular season over the weekend with a victory and a
loss as it defeated the University of the Pacific, 7-6,
and fell to the University of California at Berkeley,
13-12, in Saturday's "Big Splash." Despite the loss,
Stanford will retain its No. 1 ranking in the NCAA
playoffs.
The Cardinal's victory over UOP Friday after
noon gave the team an 11-0 record in
DeGuerre Pool this season. Stanford is now 23-4
overall.
According to Stanford Coach Dante Dettamanti,
the Tigers had very strong fast breaks and drives
on offense, while the Cardinal lacked intensity and
failed take a lead until the final seconds of the
match.
"Our team just didn't have it all together for the
game," Dettamanti said. "We commited a lot of
mental errors that could have lost us the game if we
hadn't bounced back at the end."
UOP, which finished the season at 14-11, was
leading 6-5 with four minutes remaining in the
game, but junior Marvin Mouchawar scored for the
Cardinal with 3:48 left to tie the score.
With two seconds remaining, sophomore David
lmbernino scored the winning goal, a skip shot
from 12 feet out, to give the Cardinal the victory.

The goal was the only one of the game for lmber
nino, Stanford's leading scorer.
Stanford's game against Berkeley on Saturday
was equally close, with the lead changing hands
several times in the course of the game.
The Cardinal jumped out to a 2-0 lead early but
Cal came back to tie the score at the end of the first
quarter. Stanford fell behind in the second quarter,
the Cardinal's worst quarter of play, according to
Dettamanti.
"We got to into the physical part of the game and
committed too many unnecessary errors."
The Bears scored five goals in the second quarter
while the Cardinal scored three, giving Cal a
7-5 lead at the end of the first half. Stanford was
able to come from behind in the course of the next
two quarters and tie the score at 10, forcing the
game into overtime.
The score was tied at the end of the f'rst
overtime, 12-12, but Cal was able to score the only
goal of the second overtime, a shot from the hole,
to win the game.
Although the Cardinal lost the game, Dettamanti
was very pleased with the team's performance.
"1 was really pleased with the way our players
were able to come from behind and put the game
into double overtime," Dettamanti said. "There
were two excellent teams in the pool and it was as
close as a water polo game can be. In the end,

someone has to win, and in this game it just wasn't
us."
A very balanced scoring attack helped pull Stan
ford from behind, as seven players scored for the
Cardinal. David lmbernino scored four goals, fol
lowed by Marvin Mouchawar and Craig Klass with
two goals each and Grant Stanley, Greg Ocasek,
Erich Fisher and Jaime Velez with one apiece, lm
bernino and Velez finished the regular season as
Stanford's leading scorers with 56 and 49 goals
respectively.
Klass, a sophomore who scored 35 goals for the
season, was pleased with the play of the team, but
felt his own play was lacking in some areas.
"I played a good game offensively, but my defen
sive play was lacking," Klass said. "I think we
played really well as a team and I'm really looking
forward to the NCAA's next weekend."
According to Dettamanti, Mouchawar played
two of his best games of the season, scoring five
goals for the Cardinal over the weekend.
"Mouchawar is really coming on suddenly for
us," Dettamanti said. "He is playing very consis
tently, he's scoring some very good goals and he's
really holding down our 6-5 defense."
Stanford will travel to Long Beach for the Na
tional Collegiate Athletic Association Champion
ships next weekend, Nov. 24-25. The Cardinal is
the No. 1 seed entering into the tournament, with
Berkeley taking the No. 2 seed.

committed too many unnecessary errors."
The Bears scored five goals in the second quarter
while the Cardinal scored three, giving Cal a
7-5 lead at the end of the first half. Stanford was
able to come from behind in the course of the next
two quarters and tie the score at 10, forcing the
game into overtime.
The score was tied at the end of the f'rst
overtime, 12-12, but Cal was able to score the only
goal of the second overtime, a shot from the hole,
to win the game.
Although the Cardinal lost the game, Dettamanti
was very pleased with the team's performance.
"1 was really pleased with the way our players
were able to come from behind and put the game
into double overtime," Dettamanti said. "There
were two excellent teams in the pool and it was as
close as a water polo game can be. In the end,

someone has to win, and in this game it just wasn't
us."
A very balanced scoring attack helped pull Stan
ford from behind, as seven players scored for the
Cardinal. David lmbernino scored four goals, fol
lowed by Marvin Mouchawar and Craig Klass with
two goals each and Grant Stanley, Greg Ocasek,
Erich Fisher and Jaime Velez with one apiece, lm
bernino and Velez finished the regular season as
Stanford's leading scorers with 56 and 49 goals
respectively.
Klass, a sophomore who scored 35 goals for the
season, was pleased with the play of the team, but
felt his own play was lacking in some areas.
"I played a good game offensively, but my defen
sive play was lacking," Klass said. "I think we
played really well as a team and I'm really looking
forward to the NCAA's next weekend."
According to Dettamanti, Mouchawar played
two of his best games of the season, scoring five
goals for the Cardinal over the weekend.
"Mouchawar is really coming on suddenly for
us," Dettamanti said. "He is playing very consis
tently, he's scoring some very good goals and he's
really holding down our 6-5 defense."
Stanford will travel to Long Beach for the Na
tional Collegiate Athletic Association Champion
ships next weekend, Nov. 24-25. The Cardinal is
the No. 1 seed entering into the tournament, with
Berkeley taking the No. 2 seed.
