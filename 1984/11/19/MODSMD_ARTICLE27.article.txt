## 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
By winning six of seven games in
two matches against Arizona teams
this weekend, the Stanford women's
volleyball team earned its first
WCAA championship.
The victories over Arizona State
University, 13-15, 15-1, 15-4, 15-4,
and over the University of Arizona,
15-9, 15-12, 15-9, gave the Cardinal
the best Western Collegiate Athletic
Association record at 12-2. San
Diego State University placed second
at 11-3, followed by UCLA and USC
at 10-4.
Stanford has placed second in the
Northern Pacific Conference or the
WCAA the past five seasons and has
had the best winning percentage in
the WCAA for three years.
"Nobody has played as consistently
as we have," Cardinal Asst. Coach
Don Shaw said. "This year, we have
the experience in league play plus a
lot of depth on the team. Everyone

contributes so much during practices.
It really makes for the rise."
Stanford began the match against
Arizona State by playing
"tentatively," Shaw said, and fell be
hind, 7-0, in the first game. "We were
playing not to lose instead of to win,"
Shaw said.
Cardinal hitter Susan Compton,
who had ten kills in the match, said,
"We wanted to win it so badly, we
just couldn't play well at all. After we
were behind, we started to come
back. We relaxed and won the next
three games."
Middle blocker Kim Oden had 18
kills and six digs against Arizona
State. Bobbie Broer, who had a
"great weekend," according to Shaw,
had 14 kills and four service aces.
Leading Stanford defensively was 5-
foot-4 junior Terri Bryson, who had
10 digs.
Compton said Stanford better con
trolled its "eagerness" to win the con
ference against Arizona,

"dominating" play throughout the
match. The Cardinal fell behind, 12-
10, in the second game but scored
five unanswered points to put the
league title within one game.
Shaw said Stanford has had diffi
culty playing Arizona because the
Wildcats are "not an emotional team.
"Arizona does not play with a lot
of intensity, even though they have
players like (Melissa) McLinden and
Caren Kemner. . . . We often look
sloppy when we play them."
Shaw said Stanford set a decisive
tone in the match during the first
three points. "Kim (Oden) just
stuffed Caren Kemner on the first
three balls set to her. It was three
straight blocks right off the bat."
Broer had 14 kills, a .476 hitting
percentage, and six blocks in the
game. Oden, leading Stanford with an
average hitting percentage of .417,
had 11 kills and nine blocks.
Stanford has one home game left,
against Purdue University Nov. 24.
