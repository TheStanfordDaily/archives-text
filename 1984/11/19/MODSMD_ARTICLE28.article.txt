## Cardinal loses to Cal, 65-59 
### JOHN LIS Daily staff 
BERKELEY — On Saturday af
ternoon, the Stanford football team
defeated an underdog California
team, averting any possibility of an
other "Miracle at Memorial."
On Saturday evening, the Stanford
women's basketball team, 5-23 last
season, went to Berkeley's Harmon
Gym to play a University of Califor
nia at Berkeley team that was 24-8
last year and had a 16-game home
winning streak dating back to the
1982-83 season.
The Cardinal women almost
produced their own "Miracle at Har
mon."
Trailing 47-30 five minutes into the
second half, Stanford turned things
around and came within four points
in the final two minutes before losing,
65-59.
A pair of free throws by Cardinal
center Kim Mercer with 2:03 left
closed Cal's lead to 61-57, but Stan
ford failed to convert any opportuni
ties to come closer.
After a score by Cal's Amanda
Ray, Mercer was called for traveling
with 1:12 left. Cardinal guard Vir
ginia Sourlis stole the ball back with
:43 remaining but missed a shot, as
did Mercer, to end any hope of a
comeback.
Although the Cardinal's comeback
attempt fell short, Stanford Head
Coach Dotty McCrae was happy with
her team's effort against Cal, which
received seven votes in a preseason
top-20 poll. "I think it's a really good
sign," McCrae said. "We played
really well, but we had some dumb
mistakes, some poor judgment. We
had a chance to win, but we missed
some easy shots."
Stanford committed 20 turnovers
in the first half, but was fortunate Cal
didn't play much better. The Bears
had 13 turnovers.
Referees whistled Stanford for 15
fouls in the first half, and Cal capi
talized by making 15 of 20 free
throws to take a 39-28 halftime lead.
Stanford guard Judy Griffith's play
was a bright spot in the first half.
Griffith, a junior, made five of eight
shots from the field and a pair of free
throws in the first half, finishing the
game with a career-high 12 points.
Stanford started slow in the second
half, and Cal outscored the Cardinal,
8-2, to open a 17-point lead. After a
timeout, McCrae put guard Erica
Mueser and forward Kami Anderson
into the game, and the Cardinal
began to come back.
Mueser played one of her best

games as a collegian and seemed to
be the spark Stanford needed.
Mueser finished with eight points, six
assists and three steals in 23 minutes,
and her play at point guard allowed
Sourlis, who scored a game-high 14
points, to play wing.
Anderson, a freshman, was playing
her first regular-season collegiate
game. She finished with 10 points and
five rebounds before fouling out with
3:02 left in the game. Anderson spent
much of the night playing against a
taller Cal front line and turned the
ball over five times.
"She epitomizes our lack of experi
ence," Stanford Asst. Coach Mike
Kehoe said. "She made some nice
plays. With some more minutes, she'll
get more sense of what's going on on
the court."
Cardinal forward Mary Bradach
made one of eight from the field and
finished with four points. Bradach, a
6-foot forward, is the only Stanford

senior and is being counted on to
average in double figures as she did
last season. On Saturday, she led the
Cardinal with seven rebounds.
Although disappointed with her
performance, Bradach smiled when
asked about Stanford's performance.
"You could tell when we got going
that we were getting more scoring
inside," said Bradach, who spent
much of the game going against Char
lotte Lusschen, Cal's 6-8 center.
"When their big girl (Lusschen)
blocked our shots, it took away our
momentum," Bradach said.
The Cardinal's game Saturday in
some ways resembled last Monday's
exhibition against the Kolon team of
South Korea, when the Cardinal fell
behind by 13 points but rallied for a
seven-point victory.
The Cardinal will open its home
schedule Wednesday against the Uni
versity of Santa Clara at 7:30 p.m. in
Maples Pavilion.

BERKELEY — On Saturday af
ternoon, the Stanford football team
defeated an underdog California
team, averting any possibility of an
other "Miracle at Memorial."
On Saturday evening, the Stanford
women's basketball team, 5-23 last
season, went to Berkeley's Harmon
Gym to play a University of Califor
nia at Berkeley team that was 24-8
last year and had a 16-game home
winning streak dating back to the
1982-83 season.
The Cardinal women almost
produced their own "Miracle at Har
mon."
Trailing 47-30 five minutes into the
second half, Stanford turned things
around and came within four points
in the final two minutes before losing,
65-59.
A pair of free throws by Cardinal
center Kim Mercer with 2:03 left
closed Cal's lead to 61-57, but Stan
ford failed to convert any opportuni
ties to come closer.
After a score by Cal's Amanda
Ray, Mercer was called for traveling
with 1:12 left. Cardinal guard Vir
ginia Sourlis stole the ball back with
:43 remaining but missed a shot, as
did Mercer, to end any hope of a
comeback.
Although the Cardinal's comeback
attempt fell short, Stanford Head
Coach Dotty McCrae was happy with
her team's effort against Cal, which
received seven votes in a preseason
top-20 poll. "I think it's a really good
sign," McCrae said. "We played
really well, but we had some dumb
mistakes, some poor judgment. We
had a chance to win, but we missed
some easy shots."
Stanford committed 20 turnovers
in the first half, but was fortunate Cal
didn't play much better. The Bears
had 13 turnovers.
Referees whistled Stanford for 15
fouls in the first half, and Cal capi
talized by making 15 of 20 free
throws to take a 39-28 halftime lead.
Stanford guard Judy Griffith's play
was a bright spot in the first half.
Griffith, a junior, made five of eight
shots from the field and a pair of free
throws in the first half, finishing the
game with a career-high 12 points.
Stanford started slow in the second
half, and Cal outscored the Cardinal,
8-2, to open a 17-point lead. After a
timeout, McCrae put guard Erica
Mueser and forward Kami Anderson
into the game, and the Cardinal
began to come back.
Mueser played one of her best

games as a collegian and seemed to
be the spark Stanford needed.
Mueser finished with eight points, six
assists and three steals in 23 minutes,
and her play at point guard allowed
Sourlis, who scored a game-high 14
points, to play wing.
Anderson, a freshman, was playing
her first regular-season collegiate
game. She finished with 10 points and
five rebounds before fouling out with
3:02 left in the game. Anderson spent
much of the night playing against a
taller Cal front line and turned the
ball over five times.
"She epitomizes our lack of experi
ence," Stanford Asst. Coach Mike
Kehoe said. "She made some nice
plays. With some more minutes, she'll
get more sense of what's going on on
the court."
Cardinal forward Mary Bradach
made one of eight from the field and
finished with four points. Bradach, a
6-foot forward, is the only Stanford

senior and is being counted on to
average in double figures as she did
last season. On Saturday, she led the
Cardinal with seven rebounds.
Although disappointed with her
performance, Bradach smiled when
asked about Stanford's performance.
"You could tell when we got going
that we were getting more scoring
inside," said Bradach, who spent
much of the game going against Char
lotte Lusschen, Cal's 6-8 center.
"When their big girl (Lusschen)
blocked our shots, it took away our
momentum," Bradach said.
The Cardinal's game Saturday in
some ways resembled last Monday's
exhibition against the Kolon team of
South Korea, when the Cardinal fell
behind by 13 points but rallied for a
seven-point victory.
The Cardinal will open its home
schedule Wednesday against the Uni
versity of Santa Clara at 7:30 p.m. in
Maples Pavilion.
