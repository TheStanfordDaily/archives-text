### DAVE DUTCHER Daily staff 
It'll be the women plus one for Stanford at the Na
tional Collegiate Athletic Association cross country
championships today.
The top-ranked Cardinal women's team will be at
Penn State seeking its first NCAA championship. It
will be joined by Marc Olesen, the lone qualifier for
the men's team.
The Stanford women, whose biggest competition is
expected to come from the University of Wisconsin,
are seeking to make the third time a charm after finish
ing second in 1982 and 1983. They qualified this year
by winning the NCAA District-8 championships in
Tucson, Ariz., with Cardinal runners in the top three
positions for the fourth time this season.
Olesen finished sixth in the District-8 meet, but the
rest of the team combined with him for a seventh-place
finish and did not qualify for today's NCAA race.
Olesen ran the 10,000-meter course in 31 minutes,
48.5 seconds and was the second individual qualifier.
The second Stanford runner to finish was Ryan Stoll,
whose 32:34.8 was good for 16th place. The Cardinal's
Brian Pettingill (33:51.8), Charles Alexander

(34:01.7), Jeff Atkinson (34.12.2), David Anderson
(35:26.8) and Steve Schadler (36:39.0) also ran.
Other District-8 qualifiers were Arizona State Uni
versity's Mike Stahr and Dan Gonzalez of San Jose
State University. The University of Arizona and Wash
ington State University finished first and second,
respectively, to qualify for today's race.
In the District-8 women's meet, Cardinal senior
Regina Jacobs, who has won four of the five races she
has entered this season, finished a 5,000-meter course
in 17:05.31. Junior Alison Wiley was 17 seconds behind
Jacobs, and Hopp ran her best race of this season to
finish 12.11 seconds behind Wiley. Stanford's Ellen
Lyons was seventh in 17:47.72, Christine Curtin was
13th in 17:34.42 and Kathy Smith was 26th in
18:41.20.
In the District-8 meet, the Cardinal women amassed
26 points to defeat Oregon by 14. A team wants to
score as few points as possible: Its score is determined
by the sum of its runners' ranks. A five-member team's
lowest possible score is 15.
At the NCAA meet last year, the Stanford women
finished behind the University of Oregon by three
points. Jacobs and Wiley were ninth and 23rd,
respectively, and went on to earn All-America honors.
