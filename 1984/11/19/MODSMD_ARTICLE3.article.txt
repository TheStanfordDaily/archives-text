# Ture urges activism
## Former Stokely Carmichael calls for unity 
### JOYA WESLEY 
Organization is the key to the advancement
of Afro-American peoples, according to
Kwame Ture, formerly Stokely Carmichael of
the Black Panther Party.
Amid posters promoting his current affilia
tion, The All-African People's Revolutionary
Party (A-APRP), Ture told about 100 people in
Annenberg Auditorium last night that the
promotion of organization is the legacy of the
student activist.
Ture focused his speech on the current social
state of the Afro-American. He asserted that
the greatest obstacle to the advancement of
blacks, or "Africans" as he referred to all black
peoples, including those of Africa, the Carib
bean and the United States, is a lack of organi
zation.
"Our people must be organized," he said.
"This is the task of the student activist. This is
the only task of the student activist." This lack
of organization, which Ture sees as the respon
sibility of the black intelligentsia to combat, is
the major cause of the continuation of the per
petration of injustices upon black people all
over the world.
"The harshest difficulty anyone could un

dergo is a lack of liberty," Ture said. This state
ment served as a basis for what Ture views as
the major source of injustice in the world today.
In response to this, he said men in general and
students in particular have an obligation to
humanity to maintain the advances achieved by
those ahead of them and to make new advance
ments for posterity.
"The essence of life is nothing but responsi
bility to those after you," he said. He went on to
say that man's responsibility to make a contri
bution to humanity can only be accomplished by
free people. Therefore, a people who do not
have liberty — as no Africans do according to
his philosophy — must first work to obtain
freedom. This work will in fact become the con
tribution.
Once an effective black movement begins, it
will achieve its goals rapidly. Ture stressed this
point with the repeated use of the refrain, "We
spread like wildfire."
Ture offered as specific examples of injustice
what he called the oppressive social systems of
apartheid and Zionism. "Zionism," Ture said,
"affects Africans everywhere. It is an unjust and
immoral political philosophy which has no rela
tion whatever to Judiaism." He said Zionism
caused the unjust displacement and oppression
of millions of Palestinians, just as apartheid
caused the unjust displacement and oppression
of millions of native South Africans. He also im
plicated the political and economic systems of
the United States and Western Europe in the
perpetuation of such injustice. These systems,
he said, also promote a great deal of ignorance

in order to disguise their positions.
"Ours is a revolutionary party," he said.
"We're not out to assimilate the capitalist sys
tem. We're out to destroy it."
Ture did, however, offer a less radical ap
proach to those students who wish to fufill the
legacy of student activism in a less destructive
manner. He said he believes that for a student
to work in any black organization whose pur
pose is to promote justice and equality for black
people is better than for the student to use his or
her knowledge only for personal advancement,
wherein the knowlege will die, wasted, when the
student dies.
