# Stanford prevails in Daily battle
## 
### 
BERKELEY — The Stanford Daily retained the
highly coveted but non-existent Exacto Axe with a 12-
S victory in the Ink Bowl Saturday.
Photographer Todd Sitrin led the Stanford defense
with two interceptions, while Sportswriter Tom Senf
sparked the offense with two touchdowns.
The Daily Californian's only scoring came on a
fourth-and-long "Hail Mary" play and a safety when
Daily quarterback Peter Haven missed a low snap.
Stanford's defensive line, led by speedster Shirish
Date and muscle-bound headbashers Debbie
Rubenstein, Julie Ryan, Sandra Bodovitz, Mitch Judd
and Virginia Pearson, kept constant pressure on the
Cal quarterback, and Daily photographer John Phillips
sacked him on the game's final play.
But the Cal squad had trouble even when its quar
terback got his passes off. Haven redeemed himself
with a divine interception, and 6-foot-7 cornerback

Mike Hale and 6-11 safety Mark Zeigler slapped down
dozens of passes. » Daily Cal receiver wrestled away
the Cal touchdown pass from cornerback Clint High
fill, who had been beaten badly on the play.
Photographer Donna Clarke and News Editor
Charlie Gofen kept the Cal defense guessing: Clarke
with a short over-the-head catch at fourth down and
Gofen. a track star at his Chicago high school, with two
long runs. Wide receiver John Lis also mystified the
Cal defense with his pro-style knee pads but strictly
amateur play.
Gofen ran into trouble later when Sports Editor
Jason Cole stormed the field a la John Madden, threat
ening to bench Gofen for a dropped touchdown pass.
Managing Editor Tim Grieve led the team in inspira
tion. not in talent, with regimented calisthenics and
sing-along versions of "All Right Now."
