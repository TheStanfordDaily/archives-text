### JASON COLE Daily staff 
The Stanford wrestling team was
led by an outstanding effort by fresh
man Dave Lee and turned in what
Coach Chris Horpel called an
"excellent performance" at the Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo Collegiate
Wrestling Tournament this weekend.
The tournament was not a regular
season meet for any of the 16 teams
that competed, and the teams were all
allowed to bring more than one
wrestler in each weight class. Stan
ford entered 16 wrestlers in the 10
weight classes and seven placed in the

top six of their respective classes.
But while most Cardinal
performers were struggling to reach
the top six, Lee came from the
seventh-seed position to win the 167-
pound class. In addition, Lee was
voted the Outstanding Wrestler of
the tournament from among the win
ners of the 10 weight classes.
Lee, who was the first three-time
California state champion during his
high school career, competed against
several All-Americans in his weight
class on his way to the championship.
Horpel credited Lee's success to
some fortunate coaching. "He's been

lucky in that the Schultz brothers
(Dave and Mark), two Olympic
champions, are here at Stanford.
Since they're approximately the same
weight, he has been getting some
good sparring partners."
Among the rest of the Cardinal
wrestlers, junior Jeff Bradley was
fourth at 134 pounds, junior Scott
Wiggen fifth at 150 pounds, junior
Pete Rogers sixth at 158 pounds,
senior Tom Mullen fourth at 177
pounds, sophomore Kurt Kassulke
fifth at 190 pounds and freshman
heavyweight Frank Lyles sixth.
