## Stanford debates policy in Nicaragua 
### MICHAEL GOFF Daily staff 
The Pentagon says Nicaragua has more weap
ons than it needs to defend itself against foreign
aggression. Nicaraguan officials say they need
these weapons because they may be fighting
against the most powerful nation in the world.
This is only the latest exchange in the escalat
ing conflict between the Reagan administration
and the Nicaraguan Sandinista regime, and it's a
topic of ongoing debate here.
Members of the Stanford Central America
Action Network (SCAAN) have been in close
contact with a number of national organizations
that are monitoring the situation in Nicaragua,
and they are spreading the word that U.S.-
Nicaraguan relations are at a critical point.
Other members of the Stanford community see
it differently.
According to Political Science Prof. Hubert
Marshall, the Sandinistas have strengthened
their defense because acts of war by other
countries threaten their security. Honduras and
the United States have both been engaged in
acts of war, from the mining of Nicaragua's har
bors to extensive support for the contras. On
the other hand, Nicaragua has committed no act
of war, knowing that this would give the United
States enough reason to step up its anti-
Sandinista action, Marshall says.
Robert Wesson, a senior research fellow at
the Hoover Institution, is more optimistic about
the future of the Nicaraguan conflict. He sees
the recent exchanges between Washington and

Managua as simply a "playing up" by the
media, the Sandinistas and the Reagan adminis
tration. Wesson says he doesn't "see this as a
prelude to action" and doesn't "think anything
will happen"
The Reagan administration has accused the
Sandinistas of building up their forces — six fold
since they took power — with the intention of
activities that aren't exclusively defensive. The
administration is concerned about advanced
military helicopters the Sandinistas have
recently received and about the cargos of more
Soviet ships now heading toward Nicaragua.
The Sandinistas have accused the Reagan ad
ministration of trying to build up the conflict to
lay the groundwork for a more direct involve
ment in Nicaragua. They maintain that protec
tion from potentially hostile neighbors has
forced them to turn to the Soviet Union for
weapons. U.S. pressure on Western Europe has
cut off many of the alternate suppliers of weap
ons.
A direct U.S. invasion or air strike are the
least likely outcomes of the current rising ten
sions in Nicaragua, according to the Berkeley
based Nicaragua Information Center (NIC).
The center, which is part of a nationwide net
work that provides information to SCAAN,
says that a naval quarantine is more likely and
insists that the "situation continues to [be] criti
cal."
NIC also cautions that President Reagan is
trying to build up the conflict in the minds of
people in this country to set the stage for further

aid to the contras when Congress returns to ses
sion. The administration is basing its argument
on what it sees as an offensive arms buildup, but
the "United States might consider anti-aircraft
guns as offensive because they might shoot
down our daily spy plane runs over Nicaragua,"
NIC says.

Marshall gives the Reagan administration 50-
50 odds on being able to keep the pressure high
enough to create a consensus in the United
States that a stronger role in Nicaragua is neces
sary. "Given the recent scene of Vietnam, I

would be very surprised at any land invasion.
Reagan would like one but the public won't."
Because Congress can't approve more aid to
the contras until it reconvenes in January, it is
more likely that the Reagan administration will
use three other kinds of actions to maintain its
position in the region, according to Marshall.
The administration will step up assistance to the
contras through third parties such as Israel and
South Korea, supply weapons covertly through
the CIA, and try to manuever the Sandinistas
into committing an indiscretion like chasing
contras across the Honduran border, he says.
He says Reagan is "the most ideological pres
ident we've had this century," and his strong
feelings against any Marxist government in this
hemisphere appeal very strongly to a large por
tion of the people in this country.
Through a "media buildup orchestrated by
the administration," Reagan is trying to con
vince people that there is actually a chance
Nicaragua would attack the U.S. heartland,
Marshall says.
Wesson, however, says the Sandinistas are
just using the unfounded rumors that Reagan
would invade after the election to galvanize
Nicaragua by focusing it outward. "Under these
conditions it is more difficult for any kind of op
position to take hold." The Sandinistas have
every reason to worry about opposition amid
massive shortages and unrest. They need some
thing "to deflect from the dismal economic sit
uation," Wesson says.
