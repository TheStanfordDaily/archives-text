# Club makes splash in and out of water

### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
A party by Lake Laganita known
as a Sunfest. A "madras plaid" golf
tournament played with tennis balls
on a course that winds its way across
campus. A tennis tournament in
which frying pans and lunch trays
take the place of rackets.
If these activities tickle your fancy,
then the student-run organization Big
Way is probably looking for you.
"We see ourselves as the perfect
organization for everyone to get in
volved in. We raise money and we
have fun doing it," boasted sopho
more Jay Alter, one of the heads of
Big Way.
Organized three years ago "in the
midst of stagnating social interaction"
under the name of the Big Way Yacht
Club, the organization isn't viewed in
such a favorable light by all on
campus.
"Juniors and seniors cling to the
notion that Big Way is an elitist group
out to make money for [itself],"
Alter said, adding that when the club
was first formed it gave the appear
ance that its organizers were out to
make a fast buck.
"A lot of bad feelings are left
over," Alter said. "There's been a lot
of work on our part to change such
feelings," he said, noting that the
word "club" was dropped from the
group's title because it was seen as
"elitist" by some students.
Alter said such an image is no
longer justifiable, pointing out the
club is under new leadership and has
made a new commitment to commu
nity service projects.
According to Alter, who also is an

ASSU senator, the club raised more
than $3,000 for Stanford Affiliated
Children's Centers last year, largely
from the $5 membership fee it
charges.
"The current stage of the club's
evolution is a stage in which we have
two goals. First is to raise money for
the Stanford Affiliated Children's
Centers and second is to have fun,"
Alter said.
Big Way, which is part of the Stan
ford Volunteer Network, will begin
recruiting members to fill various club
positions after Thanksgiving break in
White Plaza. Memberships, which
totaled more than 1,000 last year, will
be sold during winter quarter, Alter
said, with the majority of the club's
events taking place in the spring.
"We're very excited about the in
terest sophomores and freshmen have
shown toward the club," he said.
Part of that interest was probably
spawned from the club's mascot,
Captain Big Way, who spent many a
day wearing Superman-like garb in
White Plaza, making his pitch for the
organization.
Alter said the role of the captain
will be somewhat diminished this
year. "We see him more like Ronald
McDonald, appearing only at certain
special events and particular times,"
he said.
