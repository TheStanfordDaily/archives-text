# University launches recruit plan
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
The University has launched a new recruiting program
aimed at attracting "really superb" high school math and
science students here, according to a Stanford professor.
According to Statistics Prof. Bradley Efron, chairman
of the Stanford Mathematical and Computational Science
Program, the University is "not getting our share" of the
country's best high school math prodigies. That problem,
however, could soon be a thing of the past if the recruiting
drive — which includes mailings about the University's
prowess in mathematical fields — is a success.
Efron said the program randomly selected half of the
students who achieved scores of 750 or higher on the
math portion of the Scholastic Aptitude Test to receive
letters touting the University's math and computer science
programs. Of those who received the letters, mailed out
just over two weeks ago, 60 students have already
responded by returning an enclosed postcard requesting
more information.
Efron said he would be pleased if the University could
attract 20 of these students.
The drive, financed by a $10,000 gift to the program
more than a year ago by Psychology Prof. A 1 Hastorf, also
entails follow-up brochures and applications to the Uni
versity to those responding to the initial mailing.
The program, formed in 1970, offers an inter
departmental major to undergraduates in mathematics,
computer sciences, operations research and statistics.
Efron said that approximately 150 students now are
mathematical and computational science majors, a figure
that has doubled in the past two years.
The major, Efron said, combines the abstract,
qualitative aspects of mathematics with the computa
tional, computer-science side of the field. Graduates often
enter the job market as statisticians, management consul
tants or employees of computer manufacturers.
In addition, many go on to attend graduate school in the
fields of law and business.
Efron said that it isn't "any surprise" that the Univer
sity doesn't have the number of talented mathematical un
dergraduates it would like as there "just aren't enough to
go around."
Efron said Stanford ranks 10th in the nation in the
number of such top-rated math students it attracts, behind
such schools as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
the California Institute of Technology and the University
of California at Berkeley. "MIT is the champion of getting
these people," Efron said.
Efron said that part of the University's problem in at
tracting such math talent may lie in its reputation of
looking for and accepting the well-rounded student. Efron
called this "a nice image," but added that it doesn't help
when high school seniors with a strong interest in mathe
matical and computational science apply for college.
"If you're not in a certain circuit, you may never have
heard much about Stanford," Efron said.
Jean Fetter, dean of admissions, has been "extremely
positive" in her support of the program's recruiting effort,
Efron said, adding ' She's been terrific."
