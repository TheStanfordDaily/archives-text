Tanker's bow towed to dry dock
SAN FRANCISCO — Escorted by a 23-boat armada, the bow of the
battered tanker Puerto Rican was towed into San Francisco Bay yester
day afternoon, headed toward dry dock where its remaining cargo of 2.7
million gallons of petrochemical could be unloaded.
The tanker exploded and broke apart off the Farallon Islands Nov. 3
resulting in an oil spill that killed or injured more than 1,000 birds.
The towing pace was slower than anticipated, but the 360-foot bow
section appeared to be holding its cargo adequately as it crossed into the
Bay shortly before 3 p.m.. Coast Guard spokesman Ken Freeze said.
"She's not even trailing a sheen (of oil)," Freeze said.
The Puerto Rican, whose stern section sank, was escorted by Coast
Guard craft ranging in size from a 180-foot buoy tender to a 20-foot in
flatable raft.
Spectators ashore watched the progress through binoculars but offi
cials declared the Golden Gate Bridge off-limits to pedestrians and
bicyclists about 11 a.m. "because of [the]safety factor— so someone
wouldn't throw a flare or something," said Sgt. Wanda Sharp of the
Golden Gate Bridge Highway and Transportation District Police.
The Puerto Rican, towed by a seagoing German tug, the Titan, was
held up for several hours near Mile Rock outside the Golden Gate
Bridge because of tidal conditions.
Coast Guard officials had hoped to bring the boat into the Bay during
ebb tide so any oil that spilled would be carried out to sea. But there
were fears that towing against the maximum tide flow of 2.6 knots would
put too much stress on the towing cable and there was a chance of it
breaking.
The towing operation began Saturday afternoon after officials of
Keystone Shipping Co., a Philadelphia firm that owns the vessel, pur
chased $500 million of insurance to cover costs if any of the remaining
cargo of lube oil, oil additives and other petrochemicals escaped into the
Bay during the towing operation, Freeze said.
MiG reports called 'exaggerated'
WASHINGTON — Rep. Michael Barnes (D-Md.) chairman of a
House subcommittee on Central America, charged yesterday that some
Reagan administration officials exaggerated the possible delivery of
MiG-21 fighter planes to Nicaragua recently to rally support for
renewed funding for Nicaraguan rebels.
None of the jet aircraft was unloaded from the Soviet ship that docked
Nov. 7 at Corinto, Nicaragua, but Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Miguel
d'Escoto Brockman said yesterday on the CBS program "Face the Na
tion" that "there is nothing we don't have the right to obtain."
A third guest on the same program, Rep. Henry Hyde (R.-I1I.) said
"four Soviet ships a week on average" now dock at Nicaraguan ports —
"and they aren't dropping off candy bars."
A Pentagon spokesman was unable to confirm Hyde's statistic, which
he used in saying that Managua is engaging in an unprecedented and un
necessary arms buildup. Last week. Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger said Soviet arms shipments to Managua have risen from 890
tons in 1981 to more than 15,000 tons so far this year.
Hyde, a staunch administration supporter on Central American
policy, complained that the MiG affair indicated a "lack of coordination
and confusion (within the administration) which 1 view as a very disturb
ing situation."
The State Department, Pentagon and White House each put out dif
ferent versions of the story, he said, which together with unattributed
leaks created public confusion about who is in charge of affairs in Wash
ington.
Barnes, who heads the subcommittee on Western Hemisphere Affairs
of the House Foreign Affairs committee, joined Hyde's criticism. He
also agreed with Secretary of State George Shultz that leaking the story
of MiGs en route to Managua was "a criminal act" that should be pun
ished.
Jet returns after engine fire
LAS VEGAS, Nev. — A Boeing 747 charter jet with 508 people
aboard returned safely to McCarran International Airport after one of
its four engines caught fire shortly after takeoff yesterday, airport offi
cials said.
The Detroit-bound Overseas National Airways jet landed soon after
its 3:26 p.m. takeoff, Department of Aviation spokeswoman Sheila
Sendlein said, adding that there were no injuries reported.
"There was a fire in a right engine, and it (the jet) safely returned. It's
down safely." Sendlein said. "It turned right around and came down."
The accident triggered a small brushfire "between the runways," but it
was quickly doused, said a Clark County Fire Department official who
would not give his name.
Satellite launch postponed again
VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE — The launch of a $56
million weather satellite that can track hurricanes and handle interna
tional search-and-rescue duties was postponed for the sixth time yester
day. However, officials planned to try again today to send the satellite
aloft.
The Soviet Union has three such satellites that are part of an interna
tional search-and-rescue network.
The flight of the NOAA-F satellite was scrubbed about 10 hours
before its scheduled 2:42 a.m. liftoff yesterday because of gusty winds
high in the atmosphere which could disrupt the rocket's trajectory, said
Vandenberg spokesman C.J. Fenrick.
The launch was tentatively rescheduled for 2:42 a.m. today at the Air
Force base, 130 miles northwest of Los Angeles.
"It's a little too gusty. We would not be able to put it into a proper or
bit," Fenrick said yesterday. "This is the nature of this time of year, and
it's just unfortunate that this happened.
"That has been our problem for the past five launches, the unaccept
able winds."
Fenrick said the Atlas-E rocket had not been loaded with its liquid
fuel.
The RCA Corp. satellite, which was originally set for launch Nov. 8,
will be put into a near-polar orbit about 540 miles above the earth.
The satellite program is a cooperative effort by Great Britain, Canada,
France, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Na
tional Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration.
It will transmit data for use in local weather analysis, hurricane track
ing and warnings, agriculture, commerical fishing and forestry, among
other things.
Archbishop's letter assails siege
SANTIAGO, Chile — The archbishop of Santiago assailed Chile's
state of siege and denounced government criticism of the church yester
day in a letter that priests read to hundreds of thousands of parishoners
despite official attempts to censor it in the news media.
Monsignor Juan Francisco Fresno warned that the state of siege
measures put the church at odds with President Augusto Pinochet and
some other political leaders who are Roman Catholic, but he stopped
short of directly threatening excommunication.
"As a pastor, I am witness to the confusion, fear and anguish that
these measures have produced," Fresno said in the letter. "I fear that the
state of siege signifies a reversal for understanding among Chileans and
for the peace of the country."
The archbishop made the letter public on Wednesday in response to
the most strident criticism of the church in the 11 years of Pinochet's
military regime.
The government instructed Chilean news media to ignore the letter,
the conservative archbishop's most biting commentary on the govern
ment in his 18 months as the leading church figure in this predominantly
Catholic country.
Only Radio Chilena, the church-owned station, broadcast Fresno's
reading yesterday, but printed copies circulated widely in Catholic
schools late last week.

d'Escoto Brockman said yesterday on the CBS program "Face the Na
tion" that "there is nothing we don't have the right to obtain."
A third guest on the same program, Rep. Henry Hyde (R.-I1I.) said
"four Soviet ships a week on average" now dock at Nicaraguan ports —
"and they aren't dropping off candy bars."
A Pentagon spokesman was unable to confirm Hyde's statistic, which
he used in saying that Managua is engaging in an unprecedented and un
necessary arms buildup. Last week. Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger said Soviet arms shipments to Managua have risen from 890
tons in 1981 to more than 15,000 tons so far this year.
Hyde, a staunch administration supporter on Central American
policy, complained that the MiG affair indicated a "lack of coordination
and confusion (within the administration) which 1 view as a very disturb
ing situation."
The State Department, Pentagon and White House each put out dif
ferent versions of the story, he said, which together with unattributed
leaks created public confusion about who is in charge of affairs in Wash
ington.
Barnes, who heads the subcommittee on Western Hemisphere Affairs
of the House Foreign Affairs committee, joined Hyde's criticism. He
also agreed with Secretary of State George Shultz that leaking the story
of MiGs en route to Managua was "a criminal act" that should be pun
ished.
Jet returns after engine fire
LAS VEGAS, Nev. — A Boeing 747 charter jet with 508 people
aboard returned safely to McCarran International Airport after one of
its four engines caught fire shortly after takeoff yesterday, airport offi
cials said.
The Detroit-bound Overseas National Airways jet landed soon after
its 3:26 p.m. takeoff, Department of Aviation spokeswoman Sheila
Sendlein said, adding that there were no injuries reported.
"There was a fire in a right engine, and it (the jet) safely returned. It's
down safely." Sendlein said. "It turned right around and came down."
The accident triggered a small brushfire "between the runways," but it
was quickly doused, said a Clark County Fire Department official who
would not give his name.
Satellite launch postponed again
VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE — The launch of a $56
million weather satellite that can track hurricanes and handle interna
tional search-and-rescue duties was postponed for the sixth time yester
day. However, officials planned to try again today to send the satellite
aloft.
The Soviet Union has three such satellites that are part of an interna
tional search-and-rescue network.
The flight of the NOAA-F satellite was scrubbed about 10 hours
before its scheduled 2:42 a.m. liftoff yesterday because of gusty winds
high in the atmosphere which could disrupt the rocket's trajectory, said
Vandenberg spokesman C.J. Fenrick.
The launch was tentatively rescheduled for 2:42 a.m. today at the Air
Force base, 130 miles northwest of Los Angeles.
"It's a little too gusty. We would not be able to put it into a proper or
bit," Fenrick said yesterday. "This is the nature of this time of year, and
it's just unfortunate that this happened.
"That has been our problem for the past five launches, the unaccept
able winds."
Fenrick said the Atlas-E rocket had not been loaded with its liquid
fuel.
The RCA Corp. satellite, which was originally set for launch Nov. 8,
will be put into a near-polar orbit about 540 miles above the earth.
The satellite program is a cooperative effort by Great Britain, Canada,
France, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Na
tional Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration.
It will transmit data for use in local weather analysis, hurricane track
ing and warnings, agriculture, commerical fishing and forestry, among
other things.
Archbishop's letter assails siege
SANTIAGO, Chile — The archbishop of Santiago assailed Chile's
state of siege and denounced government criticism of the church yester
day in a letter that priests read to hundreds of thousands of parishoners
despite official attempts to censor it in the news media.
Monsignor Juan Francisco Fresno warned that the state of siege
measures put the church at odds with President Augusto Pinochet and
some other political leaders who are Roman Catholic, but he stopped
short of directly threatening excommunication.
"As a pastor, I am witness to the confusion, fear and anguish that
these measures have produced," Fresno said in the letter. "I fear that the
state of siege signifies a reversal for understanding among Chileans and
for the peace of the country."
The archbishop made the letter public on Wednesday in response to
the most strident criticism of the church in the 11 years of Pinochet's
military regime.
The government instructed Chilean news media to ignore the letter,
the conservative archbishop's most biting commentary on the govern
ment in his 18 months as the leading church figure in this predominantly
Catholic country.
Only Radio Chilena, the church-owned station, broadcast Fresno's
reading yesterday, but printed copies circulated widely in Catholic
schools late last week.

Tanker's bow towed to dry dock
SAN FRANCISCO — Escorted by a 23-boat armada, the bow of the
battered tanker Puerto Rican was towed into San Francisco Bay yester
day afternoon, headed toward dry dock where its remaining cargo of 2.7
million gallons of petrochemical could be unloaded.
The tanker exploded and broke apart off the Farallon Islands Nov. 3
resulting in an oil spill that killed or injured more than 1,000 birds.
The towing pace was slower than anticipated, but the 360-foot bow
section appeared to be holding its cargo adequately as it crossed into the
Bay shortly before 3 p.m.. Coast Guard spokesman Ken Freeze said.
"She's not even trailing a sheen (of oil)," Freeze said.
The Puerto Rican, whose stern section sank, was escorted by Coast
Guard craft ranging in size from a 180-foot buoy tender to a 20-foot in
flatable raft.
Spectators ashore watched the progress through binoculars but offi
cials declared the Golden Gate Bridge off-limits to pedestrians and
bicyclists about 11 a.m. "because of [the]safety factor— so someone
wouldn't throw a flare or something," said Sgt. Wanda Sharp of the
Golden Gate Bridge Highway and Transportation District Police.
The Puerto Rican, towed by a seagoing German tug, the Titan, was
held up for several hours near Mile Rock outside the Golden Gate
Bridge because of tidal conditions.
Coast Guard officials had hoped to bring the boat into the Bay during
ebb tide so any oil that spilled would be carried out to sea. But there
were fears that towing against the maximum tide flow of 2.6 knots would
put too much stress on the towing cable and there was a chance of it
breaking.
The towing operation began Saturday afternoon after officials of
Keystone Shipping Co., a Philadelphia firm that owns the vessel, pur
chased $500 million of insurance to cover costs if any of the remaining
cargo of lube oil, oil additives and other petrochemicals escaped into the
Bay during the towing operation, Freeze said.
MiG reports called 'exaggerated'
WASHINGTON — Rep. Michael Barnes (D-Md.) chairman of a
House subcommittee on Central America, charged yesterday that some
Reagan administration officials exaggerated the possible delivery of
MiG-21 fighter planes to Nicaragua recently to rally support for
renewed funding for Nicaraguan rebels.
None of the jet aircraft was unloaded from the Soviet ship that docked
Nov. 7 at Corinto, Nicaragua, but Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Miguel
d'Escoto Brockman said yesterday on the CBS program "Face the Na
