# Report proposes welfare changes

### 
WASHINGTON — A Heritage
Foundation report, distributed ai a
Cabinet meeting last week, proposes
to exempt interest income from taxes
and to allow workers to gradually
withdraw from the Social Security
and Medicare systems and finance
their own through Individual
Retirement Accounts.
The report also recommends
charging patients more for Medicare
hospital stays, cutting by 3 percent
projected Medicaid grants to states
with "excessive" health-care costs,
substantially shrinking the functions
of the Department of Education, and
linking student aid to academic
prowess.
The report, called "Mandate for
Leadership II;" is to be published
Dec. 7 by Heritage, a leading conser
vative think-tank, headed by Edwin
Feulner Jr, which has a strong follow -
ing among administration officials.
Four years ago, Heritage published
a similar report outlining more than
2,000 proposals. That became the
first glimpse for many of the conser
vative themes and proposals that

characterized Reagan's rust term —
reducing the scope of government,
shrinking federal programs and
relying more on market forces to
solve economic problems.
Feulner, in a foreword to the new
report, said nearly two-thirds of the
proposals in the 1980 report "had
been or were being transformed into
policy" by the end of Reagan's first
year.
Advance copies of the current
report were given to White House
Counselor Edwin Meese. At a
Cabinet meeting Thursday, each
Cabinet member was given the por
tion of the report that related to that
member's department.
Portions of the report also were
leaked to the press over the weekend.
The new report contains more than
1,300 foreign and domestic recom
mendations, including:
• Consolidating most education aid
programs into block grants to the
states and eliminating the Depart
ment of Education's civil-rights en
forcement responsibilities.
• Giving government vouchers to the

recipients of Medicaid, Medicare,
education and housing aid, allowing
them to buy their own private
services or benefits. The amount of
the Medicaid vouchers would vary ac
cording to the income of the
recipient.
• Increasing highway and waterway
tolls, imposing heavy tees on corpor
ate jets that land at busy airports
during rush hours, ending further
federal work on the interstate high
way system, allowing the states to
impose a gasoline tax to pay for high
way construction.
• Opening more government offshore
oil areas to private development.
• Including in all Medicare coverage
a limit on how much individuals must
pay for catastrophic illnesses. Even
tually, as more people choose to put
their money into medical IRA's to
cover retirement medical needs, the
report said, the catastrophic protec
tion might remain as the only
Medicare option.
• Providing a block grant to states to
cover outlays for nursing home care
and home health care, now separately

financed through Medicare, Medicaid
and other programs.
• Further "deregulating financial in
stitutions to speed the flow of capital
into business,'" and excluding savings
interest from income tax to
"encourage capital formation.
Calling the creation of the Depart
ment of Education "a historic
blunder," the report said the depart
ment now should be shriveled into
the equivalent of "a three-room
schoolhouse."
One of the three sections should
distribute to the states a federal block
grant for elementary and secondary
education, and should "wholesale"
student aid money to colleges, allow
ing them to "retail" it to needy stu
dents. A second section would be a
"small but outstanding statistical
bureau," and the third, a "bully pul
pit" without regulatory authority, to
propound "sound ideas" to improve
schools.
