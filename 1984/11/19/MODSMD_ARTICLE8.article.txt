# Top French aide travels to Chad

PARIS — French Defense Minister Charles
Hernu and his armed forces chief of staff flew to
Chad for talks with President Hissene Habre yes
terday and France resumed reconnaissance flights
over its former African colony less than 48 hours
after acknowledging that Libyan troops are still in
the country in violation of a mutual withdrawal
agreement.
French Foreign Minister Claude Cheysson,
meanwhile, reiterated, before leaving for an official
visit to Washington, that France will match any
Libyan troop presence in Chad with its own forces.
Cheysson also attacked what he said was a U.S.
press campaign designed to pressure France into
hardening its attitude toward Libya, Agence
France-Presse reported. Cheysson said the U.S.
government may have been using the press in
directly to pressure Paris into "acting toward the
Libyans like [the Americans] act toward
Nicaragua."
The developments here came as Egyptian Presi
dent Hosni Mubarak, speaking a day after Egypt
disclosed a Libyan plot to assassinate an exile
leader in Cairo, denounced Libyan leader Col.
Moammar Khadafy as "an international terrorist"
and urged other countries to take steps to "stop
him."
The French moves followed political consulta
tions at the Elysee Palace between President Fran
cois Mitterrand and his military advisers on how to

respond to the apparent bad faith of Khadafy. Mit
terrand acknowledged Friday that about 1,000
Libyan troops were still in northern Chad despite
official French and Libyan announcements on Nov.
10 of the completion of "evacuation operations."
Mitterrand's public admission followed talks
Thursday with Khadafy on the Greek island of
Crete and a series of official French statements in
sisting that the Libyans had left. Mitterrand's hand
ling of the affair was described yesterday by the
authoritative French newspaper Le Monde as the
Socialist government's "biggest foreign-policy
gaffe" since it came to office in May 1981.
The independent leftist newspaper Liberation
commented in an editorial Saturday that "the city
fox" — Mitterrand — appeared to have been out
witted by the"desert fox" — Khadafy.
Revelations last week by the U.S. State Depart
ment and Chad that Libyan troops were still in
northern Chad transformed what would otherwise
have been a significant foreign-policy success for
Mitterrand into a major setback. French leaders
now tacitly acknowledge that they were aware all
along that the Libyan withdrawal was not total —
at the same time as official French spokesmen were
claiming that it was.
Some 5,000 French troops were sent to Chad in
August 1983 to prevent the overthrow of the pro-
Western government of Habre by Libyan-backed
rebels from the north of the country. A formal

agreement to withdraw both Libyan and French
troops was negotiated by Cheysson in September
this year.
Asked yesterday whether French troops would
now be sent back to Chad, Cheysson replied: "We
have to wait and see. Nothing can be ruled out."
He said the government stood by an earlier state
ment that "if they (the Libyans) stay, we stay, if
they come back, we come back."
The French delegation that flew to Chad yester
day, led by Hernu, included armed forces chief of
staff Gen. Jeannou Lacaze.
According to French intelligence reports,
referred to by Mitterrand in a statement Friday,
about 1,000 Libyan troops remain in northern
Chad — roughly 20 percent of the original Libyan
troop strength there.
The continuing Libyan presence in northern
Chad, according to French analysts, appears to be
largely defensive. Its principal purpose seems to be
to thwart any attempt by Habre's government to
retake rebel-held territory.
French officials have rejected criticism in the
United States of Mitterrand's decision to meet with
Khadafy by depicting it as hypocritical. Govern
ment spokesman Roland Dumas insisted last week
that many more Americans than Frenchmen were
in Libya, working on oil-related business.
