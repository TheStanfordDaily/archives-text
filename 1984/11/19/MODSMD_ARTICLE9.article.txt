Chernenko speaks out
MOSCOW — Soviet President Konstantin Chernenko,
in a speech published Friday, called for a strengthening of
his country's defense capability as a response to the
"growing aggressiveness of imperialism."
The speech, delivered at the weekly meeting of the
Communist Party s ruling Politburo, gave no figures on
defense spending, but the mere mention of a priority for
the military is an unusual public acknowledgement that
more money will likely be channeled into defense next
year.
For more than a dozen years, the official Soviet budget
has fixed defense spending at about 17 billion rubles
($13.9 billion), a figure that Western analysts agree
grossly understates the actual expenditure.
As Chernenko made public his commitment to higher
defense spending, he also reiterated in responses to ques
tions submitted by NBC television correspondent Marvin
Kalb that he stands committed to reaching accords with
the United States on major arms issues. Chernenko said,
however, that the time was not yet right to consider a
summit meeting with President Reagan.
In the NBC interview, Chernenko also said that if the
Reagan administration is sincere, the way to resolving key
arms-control issues is open. And he called for a return to
the era of Soviet-American detente.
Chernenko's published speech, setting the direction for
the 1985 Soviet budget, closely followed the tone set by
his predecessor, the late Yuri Andropov. It stressed better
management, greater efficiency and higher productivity as
the way to economic growth. Next year is the last year of
the current five-year plan, the 11th, and analysts here de
tected in the speech no shift in overall economic policy.
What was unusual was not the content, but the form in
which it was delivered. Typically, Chernenko, as general
secretary of the Soviet Communist Party, would be ex
pected to deliver such a speech at the party plenum, which
usually precedes a meeting of the Supreme Soviet.
Baby Fae creates debate
LOMA LINDA — His voice choked by sadness,
Dr. Leonard Bailey said Friday that the interspecies heart
transplant used to keep the infant known only as Baby
Fae alive for nearly three weeks had "opened new vistas"
in medicine, and he pledged to continue his work in the
field.
"We learned a tremendous amount," Bailey said at a
press conference at Loma Linda University Medical Cen
ter, "much of which was brand-new to us and much of

which can be applied to the next Baby Fae."
The surgeon left no doubt that the death of the infant
. Thursday night — 20 days after her congenitally mal
formed heart was replaced with a baboon organ at the
Seventh-day Adventist-run teaching hospital 60 miles
east of Los Angeles — would not stop him from using the
knowledge gained from her experience to attempt a
similar xenograft "by and by."
While he and his colleagues were deeply saddened by
the loss of "this baby that we loved so much," Bailey said
that Loma Linda transplant team members are
"remarkably encouraged by what we learned from her"
and hope to use that knowledge again.
While heart specialists marveled that the five-pound
baby had survived as long as three weeks before dying of
kidney failure, several said Friday that the transplant was
attempted prematurely, that the move to human ex
perimentation was made before there was adequate
animal research.
Some questioned whether there had been a sufficient
effort by the researchers to inform the baby's family that
other options might have been available.
The animal transplant into Baby Fae r made possible by
newly available but toxic drugs to suppress the immune
system, is another case in which new scientific and tech
nological developments stir difficult questions about how
far and how fast science should proceed in applying this
knowledge to humans. A similar debate was stirred nearly
two years ago when Barney Clark, an elderly dentist,
received an artificial heart.
There was much criticism of the Loma Linda University
team for essentially carrying out the procedure behind
closed doors, not discussing their research widely in ad
vance and limiting information after the Oct. 26
transplant.
"It is premature to comment upon the scientific results
until they have had a chance to surface, but this does not
seem to be a scientific or clinical breakthrough," said Dr.
Peter Frommer, deputy director of the National Heart,
Lung and Blood Institute.
"The jury's still out" on whether the animal-human
heart transplant is advanced medicine or science, said Dr.
Michael Hess, director of the Medical College of Vir
ginia's heart transplant program. "I'll tell you this,
though. We have no interest in doing it here."
On Saturday, as her grieving young mother and father
watched nearby on cable television with two friends, Baby
Fae was eulogized as a "historical participant in the un
folding drama of medical history."
The hour-long service in the Loma Linda University
campus church attracted more than 2,000 people, with
another 700 or so watching on closed-circuit television in
other nearby campus buildings.

Discovery ends mission
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — The space shuttle
Discovery landed here Friday with two satellites in
its cargo bay, ending a mission that one top official des
cribed as "one of the most important in the history of the
shuttle program."
"Fantastic, fantastic," said the official, Jesse Moore,
head of the shuttle program for the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration.
It was also one of the most trouble-free shuttle flights
ever, with two satellites launched successfully and two
recovered in history's first space salvage operation.
The shuttle touched down at 7 a.m., right on schedule,
just as the sun peeked through the morning clouds on the
Florida horizon.
"We had a wonderful time up there doing a spectacular
mission for NASA and the space program," Discovery
Commander Frederick Hauck, 43, said several hours later
as he stood in front of the shuttle with the four other
members of his crew.
The Discovery landed on its 127 th orbit after traveling
2.5 million miles in eight days.
During the flight, astronauts Joseph Allen, 47, and
Dale Gardner, 36, took turns jetting out to the stricken
satellites and guiding them back to the shuttle.
Allen, who at 5 feet, 6 inches is the smallest man in the

astronaut corps, arm wrestled both satellites into the Dis
covery's cargo bay. Anna Fisher, 35, ran the shuttle's
robotic arm during the second rescue, reaching out with
Allen standing on the tip to grasp the satellite and haul it
in.
The fifth member of the crew was David Walker, 40,
the Discovery's pilot.
The satellites will be shipped to the Hughes Space &
Communications Group in El Segundo, where they were
built and where they will be refurbished for relaunching.
Egypt foils assassination
CAIRO, Egypt — Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
said Saturday that a top Cairo-based Libyan opposition
figure reported by Libya to have been •"executed" by an
assassination squad Monday was "alive and well" and that
Egyptian security had tricked Libyan leader Moammar
Khadafy into believing he was dead.
Mubarak, speaking at a meeting in a Nile Delta village,
said the assassins sent to kill Abdul Hamid Bakoush, a
former Libyan prime minister, had all been arrested
beforehand and forced to send "fake pictures showing
him to be critically injured and lying in a pool of blood" to
the Libyan Embassy in Malta.
"It was surprising and strange that Libyan officials
scrambled to inform Khadafy of the news of Bakoush's as
sassination," Mubarak said, clearly pleased with the suc
cess of Egypt's cloak-and-dagger anti-terrorist operation
against Libya, a longtime adversary.
Later at a press conference, Egyptian Interior Minister
Ahmed Rushdi triumphantly presented the intended vic
tim, saying, "Abdul Hamid Bakoush is alive. He did not
die as Khadafy said."
Rushdi said four persons — two British and two Mal
tese — had been arrested in the assassination attempt.
Mubarak did not disclose all the details of how Egyp
tian security had foiled the plot. But he said enough to in
dicate Egypt feels it has scored a major coup and adroitly
turned the tables on Khadafy, who arrived under heavy
security Saturday in Malta on a state visit.
Mubarak also charged that "other terrorist plans" were
being laid to kill West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
and King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and to overthrow the
regime of Mohammed ul-Haq in Pakistan and install the
son of the late opposition leader Ali Bhutto.
Rushdi said his press conference had been postponed
for several hours to allow authorities in other countries
time to act on the information gained in the interrogation
of the would-be assassins about other Libyan "terrorists"
operating abroad.
