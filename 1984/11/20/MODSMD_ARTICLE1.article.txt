# Remembering JFK
## Student proposes memorial plaque 
### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER Senior staff writer 
David Lempert's request appeared innocent
enough: install a commemmorative plaque on
the former Stanford residence of President John
F. Kennedy.
But Lempcrt, a fourth-year graduate student
in business and law, says he has been getting a
lot of bureaucratic doubletalk from the Univer
sity ever since he proposed the plaque more
than a year ago.
Earlier this month University President
Donald Kennedy came out in strong opposition
to the installation of a small plaque in front of
the house at 624 Mayfield Ave., where the 35th
president lived when he studied at Stanford for
three months.
After graduating from Harvard University
and before enlisting in the U.S. Navy in 1940,
Kennedy came to the Farm to audit classes in
the Political Science Department and the
Graduate School of Business. He never
received a degree.
"Very few students know that Kennedy was
here," said Lempert. "The current occupants of
his residence didn't even know until I told
them."
Several months ago, Lempert sent a letter to
Kennedy asking that a plaque be placed in front
of the house so that students would be aware
that the former president attended the Univer
sity.
In a reply to Lempert, Kennedy noted that a
plaque had been placed in front of the home at
one time and that if it is missing, it probably
now "graces a student's room." Kennedy was
unavailable for comment yesterday.
"I thought the letter was condescending,"
Lempert wrote in a report of the issue. "But I
felt the plaque was worth pursuing. At that
point I was just out to restore the original
plaque. Everyone I spoke to within the adminis
tration believed that there had been one, but it

eventually appeared that there had not.
"Placing a plaque is not a major project, but I
thought it was worth pursuing for its symbolic
value."
In a statement for the press, Lempert noted
that many Democrats on campus "feel left out
now that the University Tias committed itself to
building Ronald Reagan's presidential library
... there is a growing view that Stanford is turn
ing into'Hoover-Reagan University.' "
Lempert said that he believes the University
should acknowledge the fact that it played a
part in educating a president — even though
Kennedy's time here was brief.
After being rebuffed by Donald Kennedy,
Lempert tried again. He sent a second letter to
the University president asking for a meeting to
discuss the project.
Kennedy responded, " 'It (the plaque) would
make Stanford a bit like all those towns in the
Middle Atlantic States that say George Wash
ington slept here,' " Lempert said in the state
ment.
Lempert referred to Kennedy as
"incredulous."
"1 find it hard to understand how the presi
dent's office shifted from its first position —
that of course there was a plaque but students
had 'ripped it off,' to arguing that it would make
them look foolish if they put up a plaque."
Lempert continued, "This, to me, is a back
handed slap at the memory of the late president,
as well as an example of the University's ar
rogance in dealing with its students and its
alumni as it tries to shape its public image."
"Why not accept it here?" Lempert asked in
the statement.
Donald Carlson, director of University rela
tions, said Lempert approached him 18 months
ago with the idea of installing the plaque. At the
time, Carlson "talked to several people about

Ave., where Kennedy resided while auditing graduate courses here.
it," but had forgotten about the pro
posal until recently when discussion
of the plaque "just started again."
"The view that I share with others
is that it was not a very significant
event in John Kennedy's life,"
Carlson said.
He added, "If we started placing
memorial placues where famous
people had stayed here, we'd have
plaques by the dozens."
Robert Honeycutt, president of the
Stanford Undergraduate Historical
Society, said, "What happened is that
Dave Lempert wanted to put a
plaque on the site. We're not
talking about a huge thing like the
Reagan Library."
Lempert said in the statement that
he asked Honeycutt for some mone
tary support, but Honeycutt replied,
"I haven't been involved in trying to
raise money."
"We would allow Lempert to put
money forward for his personal
cause," Honeycutt said. He said his

group does not want to make a politi
cal issue out of the plaque, but "we
would support any money that he
(Lempert) had gotten together."
After all, Stanford "did con
tribute to his education," Honeycutt
said.
