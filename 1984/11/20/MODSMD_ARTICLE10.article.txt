## The 						Stanford Daily Toast to the CIA 
### 
The MiG scare is over, and it's time to relax,
\ quaff a few beers and savor how good it is to let
} the eagle soar in Central America again.
But hell, you can find good anywhere you look.
i And maybe all the hoopla about Soviet fighter
. planes wasn't such a bad thing in the grand
& scheme of things.
After all, it sure neutralized the debate over
the "death manual" the Central Intelligence
Age ncy so generously shared with our
democracy-building bretheren in Nicaragua.
That manual, prepared by a CIA contract
worker, advised freedom fighters to "neutralize"
Nicaraguan officials.
If you're the type who goes to cocktail parties
and gets flustered trying to remember whether
it's more polite to say things like "weapon of
mass destruction" or "peacekeeping missile" in
mixed company, you ought to stay clear of any
small talk about U.S. policy in Nicaragua.
"Freedom fighters," as a handful of wasters
• and whiners have pointed out all too many times,
• is a euphemism for the U.S.-backed terrorists
• working to destroy the newly-elected Nicaraguan
government in all sorts of democratic ways, like
blowing up food-storage warehouses and beating
up peasants masquerading as Marxist-Leninist
1 Soviet surrogates. "Neutralize" is what you do to
Nicaraguan officials you don't like. In other
words, you kill them.
If you avoid mentioning the manual during the
next Friday at Five, you'll have something in
common with Reagan administration officials.
The president said last week that the manual,
which advised insurgents to "kidnap all

Nicaraguan Government officials" and hire
criminals to shoot fellow insurgents to create
martyrs for the guerrilla cause, amounts to
"much ado about nothing."
What's more, if you circulate in high society
there's the possibility you might be standing
around that happy hour not talking with the same
people who thought up the ideas in the manual.
You might even avoid a conversation with a few
of the military brass who lent a helping hand to
make sure that the book didn't wind up in one of
the new public libraries the Sandinistas are trying
to build between sorties.
Anything is possible in this land of opportu
nity, where military and intelligence officials can
stand tall whether their policies work or not. So
when kitchen repairs aren't finished as quickly as
we'd like in places like Lebanon, don't fret. You
can always squeeze out a few tears, maybe spank
a couple subordinates on the nose with a rolled
newspaper and lay low until everything is forgot
ten.
So if you see some of America's leadership at
that party, you might offer to buy each and every
one of them a drink. They've got plenty of reason
to celebrate now that the two intra-government
agencies assigned the terribly objective task of
evaluating themselves have decided the prepara
tion and propogation of the manual — in direct
violation of a 1981 presidential order —
amounted to "no violation of the law."
Let's drink to their health and to the health of a
policy that makes us proud. The manual is gone,
our conscience is clean, and there's ice cold beer
in the fridge.
