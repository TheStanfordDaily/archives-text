There are socially helpful ways as

mean a life of asceticism; McGrath

can live a very pleasant life and still
do something to help others.
McGrath's selfish statement, which

The assassination of Indira
Gandhi, prime minister of India, was
a tragic event. The assassins are
widely assumed to be two of her
bodyguards, both Sikhs, whose
motive presumably was avenging the
desecration of the Sikhs' holiest
shrine, the Golden Temple, by the
Indian army troops ordered there by
Indira Gandhi on June 6.
Along with the Akali Dal and the
Panj Piaray, we condemn the assas
sination of Indira Gandhi. She was a
strong leader who made many con
tributions to the development of
India and, more recently, provided
leadership to the Third-World
countries. Many in India felt that she
was too strong a leader — she
resorted to military might to achieve
solutions conducive to the consolida
tion of her own dynastic power,
disregarding basic democratic prin
ciples. Invading the Golden Temple
was, in the words of Ved Mehta,
staff writer of The New Yorker, hef
"colossal blunder, a fact she came to
recognize later." The massacre of
thousands of Sikh men, women and
children at the Golden Temple was
her tragic mistake and this action,
with the inevitability of a classical
Greek tragedy, led to her assassina
tion.
In reprisal for her assassination,
thousands of Sikhs have been slain

by rampaging gangs of goondas. This
indiscriminate carnage of innocent
Sikhs, who were not involved in any
way with her assassination, is ex
tremely deplorable. We fervently
hope that there will be no counter
reprisal by Sikhs on their Hindu
neighbors in the Punjab.
What must be done to forestall
further escalation of violence? As a
first step, the new government of
Rajiv Gandhi must apprehend and
prosecute the gangsters responsible
for the slaughter of Sikhs in Delhi
and elsewhere in India. What will
surely serve to place another slab in
the foundation of a separate Sikh
state is the home minister's reply
that after two days of killings in
Delhi "not a single arrest had been
made." Khushwant Singh, Pulitzer
Prize-winning historian of the Sikhs
and former editor of several major
national newspapers, is of the view
that unless violence is halted imme
diately and the legitimate demands
of the Sikhs met, India is headed for
another partition. Some are of the
view that the breaking point has
already been reached, and that we
are launched on the river of no
return.
On the occasion of the birth an
niversary of Guru Nanak Devji this
week, let us affirm once again our
commitment to his cherished prin
ciples of peace and tolerance.
We Sikhs are of the same matrix
as the Hindus and for centuries have
lived together in harmony.
We appeal to both Hindus and
Sikhs to maintain peace.

Along with the Akali Dal and the
Panj Piaray, we condemn the assas
sination of Indira Gandhi. She was a
strong leader who made many con
tributions to the development of
India and, more recently, provided
leadership to the Third-World
countries. Many in India felt that she
was too strong a leader — she
resorted to military might to achieve
solutions conducive to the consolida
tion of her own dynastic power,
disregarding basic democratic prin
ciples. Invading the Golden Temple
was, in the words of Ved Mehta,
staff writer of The New Yorker, hef
"colossal blunder, a fact she came to
recognize later." The massacre of
thousands of Sikh men, women and
children at the Golden Temple was
her tragic mistake and this action,
with the inevitability of a classical
Greek tragedy, led to her assassina
tion.
In reprisal for her assassination,
thousands of Sikhs have been slain

by rampaging gangs of goondas. This
indiscriminate carnage of innocent
Sikhs, who were not involved in any
way with her assassination, is ex
tremely deplorable. We fervently
hope that there will be no counter
reprisal by Sikhs on their Hindu
neighbors in the Punjab.
What must be done to forestall
further escalation of violence? As a
first step, the new government of
Rajiv Gandhi must apprehend and
prosecute the gangsters responsible
for the slaughter of Sikhs in Delhi
and elsewhere in India. What will
surely serve to place another slab in
the foundation of a separate Sikh
state is the home minister's reply
that after two days of killings in
Delhi "not a single arrest had been
made." Khushwant Singh, Pulitzer
Prize-winning historian of the Sikhs
and former editor of several major
national newspapers, is of the view
that unless violence is halted imme
diately and the legitimate demands
of the Sikhs met, India is headed for
another partition. Some are of the
view that the breaking point has
already been reached, and that we
are launched on the river of no
return.
On the occasion of the birth an
niversary of Guru Nanak Devji this
week, let us affirm once again our
commitment to his cherished prin

We Sikhs are of the same matrix
as the Hindus and for centuries have
lived together in harmony.
We appeal to both Hindus and
Sikhs to maintain peace.

Would be different
I hear that the recent alleged
*sssault incident at the Beta Theta Pi
house has received nationwide press
coverage. This is terribly unfair.
People are beaten every day and
they don't make The New York
"fimes. But then most people aren't
lucky enough to be beaten up at a
fraternity house. When an assault
happens at a dormitory or a suite,
and they do, we keep it quiet to
protect the victims and the accused.
But when an assault happens at a
! fraternity house, it's news. It's
i human interest. People are inter
! ested in having someone else to
! blame for the violence on our
! campuses and in our society. It's
[ comfortable to blame "fraternity
. boys."

* I would like to respond to a state
ment made by ASSU Senator Jim
jMcGrath (The Daily, Nov. 9). When
.-asked of his plans upon graduation,
replied that he plans "to be
dike every other Stanford student —
Emake money and get rich." First of
£all, these are not the goals of every
student. You
£can get an M.D. and move to a
r wealthy area of Los Angeles and
J-become very rich. Or you can take
fc that same degree and become a
* missionary doctor in Africa, or help
£poor people in the United States for
rate so that they too can
receive adequate medical attention.
There are socially helpful ways as
well as selfish ways to use any
degree. Helping others does not
mean a life of asceticism; McGrath

can live a very pleasant life and still
do something to help others.
McGrath's selfish statement, which
implies that he doesn't give a damn
about anyone but himself, sickens
me. I hope and believe that the
majority of Stanford students do not
share McGrath's views.

Peace and tolerance
The assassination of Indira
Gandhi, prime minister of India, was
a tragic event. The assassins are
widely assumed to be two of her
bodyguards, both Sikhs, whose
motive presumably was avenging the
desecration of the Sikhs' holiest
shrine, the Golden Temple, by the
Indian army troops ordered there by
Indira Gandhi on June 6.
Along with the Akali Dal and the
Panj Piaray, we condemn the assas
