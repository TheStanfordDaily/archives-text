## Reaganomics works 
### 
Even prior to the Nov. 6 election, liberals were en
deavoring to pre-empt a Reagan victory, to dismiss it as
the result of some enormous mass deception. Beth Banks
(The Daily, Oct. 11) attributes it to a fairy-tale delusion.
Jeffery Knowlton (The Daily, Oct. 25) insists that Presi
dent Reagan merely appeals to a longing for a return to
baseball-and-apple-pie nationalism. Upon closer inspec
tion, however, we find that such nebulous generalizations
are not needed to explain the GOP landslide. Just one
real, tangible issue suffices: economics.
Reagan's single, bold departure from the aging eco
nomic policies embraced by the previous four presidents
was, of course, the across-the-board tax cut. The time
scale of the economic recovery is disconcerting to the
Keynesians, who attempt to rationalize the Reagan boom
by attributing it to other factors. Recall that the economy
had been exhibiting a steady, degenerative atrophy during
the previous decade. This was evidenced by the declining
dollar, the increasing inflation and the unacceptable un
employment levels. The beast of economic recession
seemed to laugh in the face of Keynesian economic
medicine: wage-price controls, tax rebates, demand
stimulation through tax-and-spend. At last, the economic
recovery began on Jan. 1, 1982. The first round of
Reagan's tax cuts also became effective on this date. What
an uncanny coincidence!
Inflation has remained under control, and the economic
recovery pace has slowed to a more sustainable rate. And
though no proven economic theorem assures us that jobs
keep up with population, there are more jobs right now
than at any previous time in American history. Un
employment is down to about 7.4 percent, which isn't bad
if you remember that full employment is considered by
economists to be approximately 6-percent unemployment.
To reinforce the cause-effect relationship between tax
cuts and economic expansion, let's consider the only true
macroeconomic precedent to Reagan's 30-percent tax
cut: the Kennedy tax cuts. In response to a steadily wors
ening economy, Kennedy instigated an across-the-board
tax reduction; the richest of the rich would pay 71 percent
instead of 91 percent, and those in the lowest bracket
would pay 14 percent instead of 20 percent. What fol
lowed was the largest post-war expansion America had
ever seen. As rich people's money flowed out of tax shel
ters and back onto income tax forms, tax revenues from
the highest-income bracket actually increased, despite the
23-percent reduction in the top marginal rate. This par
tially offset the reduction in tax revenue obtained from
the lower- and middle-income classes.
The Reagan economic program was parallel to this: a
30-percent across-the-board tax cut, reducing the top
marginal rate from 70 percent to 50 percent on all forms
of income. This reduced the absolute tax rate for every

one, and it also served to flatten the progressivity of the
tax schedule. I could discuss now how the average man or
woman reacts to cuts in prohibitively high taxes and how
that translates into economic recovery; one of my less
conservative colleagues at The Daily could reply with a
treatise explaining how the average American worker,
faced with tax increases, would actually work harder to
maintain the same income. But subtle economic theorists
can twist, distort, connive and construct plausible argu
ments to explain almost any desired thesis. All theoretical
necromancy aside, however, supply-side economics can
be vindicated solely by the empirical data.
It has been vindicated in the minds of the American
people, 60 percent of whom voted for four more years of
the same. People have confidence that the budget deficit,

nomic recovery is discon
certing to the Keynesians,

the Reagan boom.

already down to $140 billion now from $240 billion in the
fourth quarter of 1982, will slowly erode as the economy
continues to expand. People have confidence that Reagan
will continue pushing for more tax reforms.
What sort of reform? Rumor has it that Reagan will
propose a simple flat tax of about 20 percent, eliminating
most tax loopholes and tax shelters. The plan might also
include abolishing or reducing the estate and gift tax, the
corporate profits tax and the windfall profits tax. In a
recent speech I attended in San Jose, economist Arthur
Laffer appropriately referred to the present taxation sys
tem collectively as the "Lawyers' and Accountants' Em
ployment Act."
I don't mind putting the brunt of the tax burden on the
rich, but we must realize that the present tax system does
virtually the opposite. By eliminating almost all deduc
tions (except for charitable contributions), and by simpli
fying and reducing marginal tax rates, we can 1) continue
moving in the direction we know is correct, 2) satisfy the
popular mandate, 3) minimize the artificial economic
tampering which has not produced positive results since
World War II and 4) practice what we preach about
capitalism and a free-market economy.

cut: the Kennedy tax cuts. In response to a steadily wors
ening economy, Kennedy instigated an across-the-board
tax reduction; the richest of the rich would pay 71 percent
instead of 91 percent, and those in the lowest bracket
would pay 14 percent instead of 20 percent. What fol
lowed was the largest post-war expansion America had
ever seen. As rich people's money flowed out of tax shel
ters and back onto income tax forms, tax revenues from
the highest-income bracket actually increased, despite the
23-percent reduction in the top marginal rate. This par
tially offset the reduction in tax revenue obtained from
the lower- and middle-income classes.
The Reagan economic program was parallel to this: a
30-percent across-the-board tax cut, reducing the top
marginal rate from 70 percent to 50 percent on all forms
of income. This reduced the absolute tax rate for every

one, and it also served to flatten the progressivity of the
tax schedule. I could discuss now how the average man or
woman reacts to cuts in prohibitively high taxes and how
that translates into economic recovery; one of my less
conservative colleagues at The Daily could reply with a
treatise explaining how the average American worker,
faced with tax increases, would actually work harder to
maintain the same income. But subtle economic theorists
can twist, distort, connive and construct plausible argu
ments to explain almost any desired thesis. All theoretical
necromancy aside, however, supply-side economics can
be vindicated solely by the empirical data.
It has been vindicated in the minds of the American
people, 60 percent of whom voted for four more years of
the same. People have confidence that the budget deficit,

already down to $140 billion now from $240 billion in the
fourth quarter of 1982, will slowly erode as the economy
continues to expand. People have confidence that Reagan
will continue pushing for more tax reforms.
What sort of reform? Rumor has it that Reagan will
propose a simple flat tax of about 20 percent, eliminating
most tax loopholes and tax shelters. The plan might also
include abolishing or reducing the estate and gift tax, the
corporate profits tax and the windfall profits tax. In a
recent speech I attended in San Jose, economist Arthur
Laffer appropriately referred to the present taxation sys
tem collectively as the "Lawyers' and Accountants' Em
ployment Act."
I don't mind putting the brunt of the tax burden on the
rich, but we must realize that the present tax system does
virtually the opposite. By eliminating almost all deduc
tions (except for charitable contributions), and by simpli
fying and reducing marginal tax rates, we can 1) continue
moving in the direction we know is correct, 2) satisfy the
popular mandate, 3) minimize the artificial economic
tampering which has not produced positive results since
World War II and 4) practice what we preach about
capitalism and a free-market economy.

Even prior to the Nov. 6 election, liberals were en
deavoring to pre-empt a Reagan victory, to dismiss it as
the result of some enormous mass deception. Beth Banks
(The Daily, Oct. 11) attributes it to a fairy-tale delusion.
Jeffery Knowlton (The Daily, Oct. 25) insists that Presi
dent Reagan merely appeals to a longing for a return to
baseball-and-apple-pie nationalism. Upon closer inspec
tion, however, we find that such nebulous generalizations
are not needed to explain the GOP landslide. Just one
real, tangible issue suffices: economics.
Reagan's single, bold departure from the aging eco
nomic policies embraced by the previous four presidents
was, of course, the across-the-board tax cut. The time
scale of the economic recovery is disconcerting to the
Keynesians, who attempt to rationalize the Reagan boom
by attributing it to other factors. Recall that the economy
had been exhibiting a steady, degenerative atrophy during
the previous decade. This was evidenced by the declining
dollar, the increasing inflation and the unacceptable un
employment levels. The beast of economic recession
seemed to laugh in the face of Keynesian economic
medicine: wage-price controls, tax rebates, demand
stimulation through tax-and-spend. At last, the economic
recovery began on Jan. 1, 1982. The first round of
Reagan's tax cuts also became effective on this date. What
an uncanny coincidence!
Inflation has remained under control, and the economic
recovery pace has slowed to a more sustainable rate. And
though no proven economic theorem assures us that jobs
keep up with population, there are more jobs right now
than at any previous time in American history. Un
employment is down to about 7.4 percent, which isn't bad
if you remember that full employment is considered by
economists to be approximately 6-percent unemployment.
To reinforce the cause-effect relationship between tax
cuts and economic expansion, let's consider the only true
macroeconomic precedent to Reagan's 30-percent tax
cut: the Kennedy tax cuts. In response to a steadily wors
ening economy, Kennedy instigated an across-the-board
