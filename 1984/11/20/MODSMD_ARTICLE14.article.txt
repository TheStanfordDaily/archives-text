## Appropriate sites for Reagan library 
### 
Some factors the Administrative Council and
board of trustees might consider when they evalu
ate the three sites proposed by the Reagan Library
Planning Committee:
• The least-favored Deer Creek Road site is indeed
problematic. The existence of a corral and riding
facility here indicates that the group of economi
cally disadvantaged people associated with horse
back riding might be displaced or

VIEWPOINT

disproportionately inconvenienced by this siting
decision. Furthermore, as the place-name implies,
the presence of deer would make preferable
dedicating this area to a James Watt Wildlife
Preserve and Firing Range.
• The Alpine Road/Interstate 280 site presents
little conflict with other land-use plans and little
environmental impact. Aside from these draw
backs, it is also next to a tree nursery, which points
to a severe danger due to air pollution. The "poor
accessibility" of this site, however, seems an accu
rate reflection of the Reagan spirit. And I'm not
certain that the difficulty of integrating library pro
grams and services with the University from such a
distance will create undue consternation on
campus, particularly as program cuts are to be ex
pected more often than not.
• The proximity of the Junipero Serra site to the
Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral
Sciences suggests some potential for innovative in
teraction here. The center could concentrate its in
vestigations into compulsive aggression, ego- and
ethno-centrism and closed-mindedness — and per
haps elevate its capabilities to that of a mental insti
tution. Obversely, frequenters of the library would
find an occasional side trip to the center useful for
perfecting new ideas about internal espionage or
conceiving of alternate uses for those defense

megsbucks, such as perhaps closing the window of
vulnerability with the Soviets in the strategic field
of creative psychiatry.
In my opinion, the best we can hope for faced
with this choice of sites is that the library, like the
man, would be involved in a landslide. I would like

to offer the council and the board an additional op
tion the committee may have neglected to consider,
which has several advantages over those previously
discussed. A hardened silo of reinforced concrete
buried deep under the Stanford campus — a kind
of upside-down Hoover Tower forcefully penetrat
ing the earth in a manner reminiscent of environ
mental and foreign policy — would be more
representative and rational than the five to seven
acres of currently open space called for in the exist
ing plans. (I hope we get at least one full-scale

movie theater out of that.)
A long, circuitous hall could lead to the actual li
brary, lined with informative and evocative
photographs of America today (that's what that
blurred background is, behind the smiling presi
dent). Elsewhere, blue smoke or mirrors could give
the illusion of endless, circular progression. Visitors
so bull-headed and persistent as to require more
than imagery could reach the library entrance but
would probably be too tired to protest the lack of
objective — or at least accurate — information
therein. Visiting hours could be made brief to
ensure minimum time for incisive research and
maximum resting time for the staff and security re
quired. Book borrowers would be given no speci
fied return date, but those with incomes under
$30,000 would be limited to two books per year,
which could be streamlined to one book (per 10
visitors) by 1988. At the exit, not only could
visitors have their bags searched and X-rayed, but
they would be required to sign an oath and be given
lie-detector tests to assess their use of the informa
tion they have gathered. Press members, of course,
would be denied access altogether, except for 15-
minute sessions with a reference-desk officer every
month. Additional presidential memorabilia (such
as jelly beans) could be offered them, as well as
suitable one-line policy summaries, fudged facts
and anecdotes as necessary upon their departure.
A Reagan library will undoubtedly be near the
top of the hit list of incoming Soviet warheads on
the day before the "Star Wars" system is to be sent
up. Although all us mere surface dwellers can only
look forward to instant sublimation, should we not
strive to insure that the words of our illuminated
leader, to be retrieved 100 years hence by some
valiant white-clad explorers, forever immortalize
the true spirit of the 1980s?

• The proximity of the Junipero Serra site to the
Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral
Sciences suggests some potential for innovative in
teraction here. The center could concentrate its in
vestigations into compulsive aggression, ego- and
ethno-centrism and closed-mindedness — and per
haps elevate its capabilities to that of a mental insti
tution. Obversely, frequenters of the library would
find an occasional side trip to the center useful for
perfecting new ideas about internal espionage or
conceiving of alternate uses for those defense

megsbucks, such as perhaps closing the window of
vulnerability with the Soviets in the strategic field
of creative psychiatry.
In my opinion, the best we can hope for faced
with this choice of sites is that the library, like the
man, would be involved in a landslide. I would like

to offer the council and the board an additional op
tion the committee may have neglected to consider,
which has several advantages over those previously
discussed. A hardened silo of reinforced concrete
buried deep under the Stanford campus — a kind
of upside-down Hoover Tower forcefully penetrat
ing the earth in a manner reminiscent of environ
mental and foreign policy — would be more
representative and rational than the five to seven
acres of currently open space called for in the exist
ing plans. (I hope we get at least one full-scale

movie theater out of that.)
A long, circuitous hall could lead to the actual li
brary, lined with informative and evocative
photographs of America today (that's what that
blurred background is, behind the smiling presi
dent). Elsewhere, blue smoke or mirrors could give
the illusion of endless, circular progression. Visitors
so bull-headed and persistent as to require more
than imagery could reach the library entrance but
would probably be too tired to protest the lack of
objective — or at least accurate — information
therein. Visiting hours could be made brief to
ensure minimum time for incisive research and
maximum resting time for the staff and security re
quired. Book borrowers would be given no speci
fied return date, but those with incomes under
$30,000 would be limited to two books per year,
which could be streamlined to one book (per 10
visitors) by 1988. At the exit, not only could
visitors have their bags searched and X-rayed, but
they would be required to sign an oath and be given
lie-detector tests to assess their use of the informa
tion they have gathered. Press members, of course,
would be denied access altogether, except for 15-
minute sessions with a reference-desk officer every
month. Additional presidential memorabilia (such
as jelly beans) could be offered them, as well as
suitable one-line policy summaries, fudged facts
and anecdotes as necessary upon their departure.
A Reagan library will undoubtedly be near the
top of the hit list of incoming Soviet warheads on
the day before the "Star Wars" system is to be sent
up. Although all us mere surface dwellers can only
look forward to instant sublimation, should we not
strive to insure that the words of our illuminated
leader, to be retrieved 100 years hence by some
valiant white-clad explorers, forever immortalize
the true spirit of the 1980s?
