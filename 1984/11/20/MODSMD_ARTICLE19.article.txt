## A
						Big Game that wasn't 
### 
Last week, before the 87th
meeting of Stanford and the Uni
versity of California at Berkeley
Saturday, many local news media
took a "What's the big deal?" ap
proach toward their coverage of
the 1984 Big Game.
For once, it looks like the know
it-alls knew it all beforehand — or
almost all of it. Little that hap
pened Saturday was a surprise.
First, Brad Muster. The Card
inal's offense had revolved around
Muster since quarterback John
Paye's first finger injury, suffered
against Arizona State University
Sept. 29, and Muster came
through Saturday with 34 carries
at six yards per carry. That's 204
yards on the ground, and the rest
of the Cardinal added another 118
yards, with 102 by Thomas Henley.
The Cardinal's somewhat
respectable 5-6 record is largely
due to the slashing, cutback run
ning of Muster. Talk about coming
from nowhere — Muster had
gained a grand total of six yards
after three games and 41 yards
after Stanford's loss to Arizona
State, when John Paye went down,
taking with him the Cardinal's
passing game.
Then, not coincidentally, came
Muster's emergence. Muster
gained 82 yards in a 23-21 victory
over a UCLA team that, like it did
the past couple seasons, started
slowly and got stronger as the
year progressed. Rest assured, the
8-3 Bruins will be in an important
bowl somewhere, especially after
their convincing victory over the
University of Southern California
Saturday.
Back to Muster. Against the
University of Washington, which
finished 10-1 and is rumored to
have an inside shot at one Orange
Bowl berth, Muster rushed for 146
yards. It should be noted that the
Huskies have one of the toughest
defenses in the country, and to
rush for more than 100 yards
against them is an accomplishment
for any back and his offensive line.
Against Washington State Uni
versity, Oregon State University,
USC and the University of

Arizona, Muster gained 352 yards,
and his effort Saturday brought
him to 823 yards for this season.
That's 782 yards in seven games
— not too shabby for someone
who was so highly regarded before
the season that Stanford's media
guide said he "could see some
playing time this fall."
Look to hear more about
Muster if the Cardinal can rebuild
its offensive line. More on the line
later.
Second in not-too-surprising
events that took place Saturday
was John Paye, who shocked few
by playing. The strange aspect
about Paye's entrance into Big
Game was that he came in with the
Cardinal behind, 10-0. You'd
think Paye would come in to put
some life into Stanford's passing
game and put some points on the
board, but Paye attempted 12
passes all day. One was a touch
down pass to Emile Harry that
gave the Cardinal a 13-10 lead
with five seconds remaining in the
first half. To that point, Paye had
thrown six passes, and Stanford
had run 17 times.
Third was that Stanford has
planned to shun the pass (take
your pick — an injured quarter
back, Paye, who couldn't throw
much more than 20 yards or one,
Buckley, who had thrown 17 in
terceptions in seven games) for a
running game.
Although everyone knew what
Stanford was going to do, Cal
couldn't stop it. That's an indica
tion of Cal's defense against the
run but more of a tribute to the
Cardinal's offensive line.
However, the worst thing about
having an experienced, competent
offensive front is that when
linemen reach that status, they're
usually playing their final season.
You get the point — four of the
five offensive linemen who started
Saturday made their final curtain
calls with the Axe after the game.
These and other not-so
unexpected aspects led to a result
that was not-so-unexpected. The
better team won.
