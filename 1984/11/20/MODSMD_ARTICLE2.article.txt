# Student ticket draw to start next week
## 
### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
One hundred Stanford students with a
little luck and a little more cash will be
among the 85,000 spectators at Super
Bowl XIX.
Athletic Department officials are pre
paring for 8,000 students to vie for the 50
pairs of tickets that will be awarded in a
random draw. The winners of the draw will
still be required to pay the face value of
$60 per ticket.
"I'm not sure how many students, even
if they win, can afford to go," said Gary
Bruner, manager of events and operations
for the Athletic Department.
Faculty and staff members will compete
in a separate draw for 100 tickets, accord
ing to Sue Robichek, coordinator of the

student draw and a member of Stanford's
Super Bowl task force.
Super Bowl XIX, pitting the National
Football Conference champion against its
counterpart in the American Football

SUPERBOWL

Conference, will be played Jan. 20 in Stan
ford Stadium.
The National Football League gave
Stanford 1,500 tickets to be distributed at
the discretion of University officials.
Besides the 200 being reserved for stu
dents, faculty and staff, the majority will

go to large donors to the University, espe
cially those who have given funds to the
Athletic Department. Top University offi
cials, including members of the board of
trustees, are also expected to use these
tickets.
Students interested in entering the draw
may sign up Nov. 27-30 between 10 a.m.
and 3 p.m. at Gate Two on the south side
of Stanford Stadium. Only students with
current Stanford identification cards are
eligible, and each winner may purchase
two tickets. The winners will be chosen at
random in a ceremony before the Dec. 1
championship game at the Apple Invita
tional Basketball Tournament in Maples
Pavilion.
Officials are still working out the logis
tics of the faculty/staff draw, which will

probably occur during the second week of
December.
"It's a little tougher to get all the fac
ulty/staff people to sign up," Bruner said.
The department will try to arrange fac
ulty/staff sign-ups outside of business
hours so "it doesn't impact the
workplace," he said.
Robichek said they decided to sell the
tickets in pairs instead of as singles in order
to "cut down on scalping."
"Most people would be more inclined to
scalp their tickets if they had to go alone,"
Robichek said.
She said it's too early to tell exactly
where the student seats will be located but
indicated that all 100 probably would be
together.
Both Robichek and Bruner said it's
also impossible to predict how many
students will enter the draw. Robi
chek expects "a good turnout," saying
the department will print 8,000 entry
slips to accommodate the potential
flood of hopefuls.
The sign-ups intentionally will be
held in an out-of-the-way location at
the stadium in order to discourage
casual applicants and to keep campus
offices free from feverish fans, Robi
chek said.
"We are anticpating a large crowd
and we don't want to jam up the Ath
letic Department or Encina," Robi
chek said.
Athletic Department officials say
they will wage a publicity campaign to
make students aware of the draw. In
addition to two advertisements in The
Daily, flyers will be posted today at
all University residences.
"We'd like everybody to have a
chance," said Robichek, a 1983 Stan

ford graduate who was hired by the
Athletic Department three weeks ago
to help with the mire of Super Bowl
related work.
"A lot of students won't figure out
they can sign up." Bruner said.
"We're trying to do as good a job as
we can to let them know.
But even those who sign up and
aren't picked may still find their way
into the stadium on game day. Bruner
said the Athletic Department expects
to utilize more than 150 volunteers.
"We have some positions we'll be
staffing with students and other mem
bers of the community." he said.
Bruner said most of these volun
teers will be "greeters people
who give directions and information
in the parking lots before and after
the event, and who will be admitted
to the stadium during the game.
In addition, there may be spots
open for student ushers, press-box
aides and security guards, Bruner
said. But even competition for these
non-paying jobs will be stiff.

to the stadium during the game.
In addition, there may be spots
open for student ushers, press-box
aides and security guards, Bruner
said. But even competition for these
non-paying jobs will be stiff.
One hundred Stanford students with a
little luck and a little more cash will be
among the 85,000 spectators at Super
Bowl XIX.
Athletic Department officials are pre
paring for 8,000 students to vie for the 50
pairs of tickets that will be awarded in a
random draw. The winners of the draw will
still be required to pay the face value of
$60 per ticket.
"I'm not sure how many students, even
if they win, can afford to go," said Gary
Bruner, manager of events and operations
for the Athletic Department.
Faculty and staff members will compete
in a separate draw for 100 tickets, accord
ing to Sue Robichek, coordinator of the

student draw and a member of Stanford's
Super Bowl task force.
Super Bowl XIX, pitting the National
Football Conference champion against its
counterpart in the American Football

SUPERBOWL

Conference, will be played Jan. 20 in Stan
ford Stadium.
The National Football League gave
Stanford 1,500 tickets to be distributed at
the discretion of University officials.
Besides the 200 being reserved for stu
dents, faculty and staff, the majority will

go to large donors to the University, espe
cially those who have given funds to the
Athletic Department. Top University offi
cials, including members of the board of
trustees, are also expected to use these
tickets.
Students interested in entering the draw
may sign up Nov. 27-30 between 10 a.m.
and 3 p.m. at Gate Two on the south side
of Stanford Stadium. Only students with
current Stanford identification cards are
eligible, and each winner may purchase
two tickets. The winners will be chosen at
random in a ceremony before the Dec. 1
championship game at the Apple Invita
tional Basketball Tournament in Maples
Pavilion.
Officials are still working out the logis
tics of the faculty/staff draw, which will

probably occur during the second week of
December.
"It's a little tougher to get all the fac
ulty/staff people to sign up," Bruner said.
The department will try to arrange fac
ulty/staff sign-ups outside of business
hours so "it doesn't impact the
workplace," he said.
Robichek said they decided to sell the
tickets in pairs instead of as singles in order
to "cut down on scalping."
"Most people would be more inclined to
scalp their tickets if they had to go alone,"
Robichek said.
She said it's too early to tell exactly
where the student seats will be located but
indicated that all 100 probably would be
together.
Both Robichek and Bruner said it's
also impossible to predict how many
students will enter the draw. Robi
chek expects "a good turnout," saying
the department will print 8,000 entry
slips to accommodate the potential
flood of hopefuls.
The sign-ups intentionally will be
held in an out-of-the-way location at
the stadium in order to discourage
casual applicants and to keep campus
offices free from feverish fans, Robi
chek said.
"We are anticpating a large crowd
and we don't want to jam up the Ath
letic Department or Encina," Robi
chek said.
Athletic Department officials say
they will wage a publicity campaign to
make students aware of the draw. In
addition to two advertisements in The
Daily, flyers will be posted today at
all University residences.
"We'd like everybody to have a
chance," said Robichek, a 1983 Stan

ford graduate who was hired by the
Athletic Department three weeks ago
to help with the mire of Super Bowl
related work.
"A lot of students won't figure out
they can sign up." Bruner said.
"We're trying to do as good a job as
we can to let them know.
But even those who sign up and
aren't picked may still find their way
into the stadium on game day. Bruner
said the Athletic Department expects
to utilize more than 150 volunteers.
"We have some positions we'll be
staffing with students and other mem
bers of the community." he said.
Bruner said most of these volun
teers will be "greeters people
who give directions and information
in the parking lots before and after
the event, and who will be admitted
to the stadium during the game.
In addition, there may be spots
open for student ushers, press-box
aides and security guards, Bruner
said. But even competition for these
non-paying jobs will be stiff.
