The Stanford women's cross
country team was hoping to hang a
running shoe next to the Axe, but
that hope didn't pan out. For the
third consecutive season the team ran
to a second-place finish in the Na
tional Collegiate Athletic Association
Championships at Penn State yester
day.
The Cardinal women went to the
meet ranked No. 1 in the nation but
were forced to compete without
sophomore Cory Schubert, the No. 3
runner. Schubert also missed compet
ing in the NCAA District-8 meet
Nov. 10, because of muscle spasms in
her back.
The University of Wisconsin, the
No. 2-ranked team, took the national
title with a total of 63 points while
Stanford finished with 89.
Though she led the Cardinal team
with a 16:33.7, fourth-place finish,
senior Regina Jacobs proved that the
Western Collegiate Athletic Associa
tion isn't quite the same as national
competition. Running in conference
races, Jacobs had won four straight
times and finished in second place
once early in the season.
Cathy Branta of Wisconsin finished
first in the 5,000-meter race with a
time of 16:15.6. Shelly Steely of the
University of Florida and Christine
McMikan of Oklahoma State Univer
sity took second and third.

Junior Alison Wiley was the only
other Stanford representative in the
top 10, finishing in seventh place with
a time of 16:40.4.
Jacobs and Wiley were consistent
one-two finishers during the cross
country season, leading the team to
victory in spite of costly injuries to
key runners. They were both named
All-Americansfor the second straight
season.
Besides being hampered by the loss
of Schubert, the team was left at even
less than full strength by the nagging
hip injury that senior Ceci Hopp has
run with all season. Hopp finished
55th in the national championships,
with a time of 17:26.0.
Senior Ellen Lyons finished 15th,
while freshmen Christa Curtin and
Kathy Smith finished 52nd and 101st,
respectively.
North Carolina State University
finished third in the national
championship race with a total of 99
points and the defending champion,
the University of Oregon, could only
manage fourth place with 119 points.
The lone representative for the
Cardinal men was sophomore Marc
Oleson. He finished 31st in the men's
10,000 meters with a time of 30:31.1.
Oleson was the top runner for the
men all season, leading all Stanford
runners in every race this season.
Oleson's finish was six shy of making
Ail-American. The top 25 runners
receive All-America honors.
