## 'Home': an old story retold warmly 
### NANCY HENRY 
The basic plot and theme of
"Home," a play by Samm-Art Wil
liams at the Lorraine Hansberry
Theatre in San Fransisco, are
straightforward and simple: Farm boy
goes to big city, falls victim to seedy
characters and cut-throat lifestyle,
realizes the virtues of home and
returns. It is the humor and warmth
with which this old story is retold and
the vivid freshness of the perfor
mances that make this production
come to life.
The play revolves around Anthony
Haney, as Cephus Miles, whose stage
presence is strong enough to make
the physical and thematic structures

tor, and both Robinson and Scott rise
to the task, serving as a kind of chorus
as well as bringing each of their
numerous characters to life. At dif
ferent times, they represent the
voices of temptation, conscience and
memory. Flitting freely around the
stage, they change costumes and in
teract with each other, the unifying
element of all their activities being
Cephus and his story.
The chorus is effective, and one of
the dramatic techniques most heavily
employed is the monologue. Cephus
is a great yarn spinner, and much of
the play relies on his ability to hold
our attention — to make us see from
his descriptions. Haney maintains an

This is a journey in the life of one
man; we meet people and hear stories
only as they relate to him. His experi
ences are broad and colorful enough
to make us laugh.

work. This is a journey in the life of
one man; we meet people and hear
stories only as they relate to him. On
occasion the self-indulgence of the
character seems excessive, but overall
his experiences are broad enough and
colorful enough to hold our interest
and make us laugh.
The main reason for this is the
shining talent of Margarette Robin
son and Esther Scott as the two
"women." Together they run the
gamut from Baptist preacher to wino,
from farm girl to army sergeant and
everything in between in the course
of portraying the events of Cephus'
life.
These are roles to challenge any ac

intensity that does just that, even
when the yarn, as any true Southern
tale will, begins to drag.
The emphasis in "Home" is
definitely on the stories that color and
fill the loosely woven story line. The
plot, however, cannot be ignored;
several elements of the plot are disap
pointing. Painfully sincere, Cephus
refuses to violate his religious train
ing. "Thou shalt not kill" means thou
shalt not kill, even in Vietnam. The
innocent farm boy is imprisoned and
accused of having communist sym
pathies; he cannot go home and
therefore leaves for the city.
When he does return years later, it
is only because "someone" obtained

and slipped to him the deed for his
property in South Carolina. Even
though the play never aspires to
realism, these incongruous con
trivances are a weakness.
The true strength of the play, on
which it soars beyond average
theater, is its humor — and an honest,
wholesome, universal humor it is. We
cannot help but see a bit of ourselves
in stories about Cephus' first love, his
baptisin' or his switchin' — for
shootin' craps on the sabbath. These
glimpses of a romanticized American
childhood thrive in the true Huck
Finn tradition. Other memories, of
jail and friends killed in the war, are
less pleasant; but in contrast, they
reinforce the joy of coming home.
Other sharp contrasts are also im
portant. Images of rural and urban
life are repeatedly juxtaposed: the
sweet smell of spring and the myth of
the perfume night; the innocence of
virginity and the shallowness of pros
titution; the lasting value of land and
the ephemeral value of money. Most
effective is the use of gospel and jazz
music.
Again, Robinson and Scott are in
top form when singing in soulful har
mony with a depth of emotion that
the breezy jazz will never achieve.
The tensions between these two
worlds allow us to anticipate and fi
nally revel in Cephus' final return.

Hansberry Theatre is currently
housed in a side room of the Trinity
Episcopal Church. An adequate but
limited theater, its resources have
been efficiently utilized by director
Stanley Williams and set designer
Alan Curreri. The play would not
have approached the intensity it did
had the atmosphere been less inti
mate. Everything, including the
minor costume changes, takes place
in view of the audience; the set is ap
propriately simple. This is a compact
and self-contained play, a wonderful
combination of creativity and
simplicity. "Home" runs through
Dec. 17, Thursday-Saturday.

Hansberry Theatre is currently
housed in a side room of the Trinity
Episcopal Church. An adequate but
limited theater, its resources have
been efficiently utilized by director
Stanley Williams and set designer
Alan Curreri. The play would not
have approached the intensity it did
had the atmosphere been less inti
mate. Everything, including the
minor costume changes, takes place
in view of the audience; the set is ap

and self-contained play, a wonderful
combination of creativity and
simplicity. "Home" runs through
Dec. 17, Thursday-Saturday.


The characters from "Home" tell one man's touching story.
The basic plot and theme of
"Home," a play by Samm-Art Wil
liams at the Lorraine Hansberry
Theatre in San Fransisco, are
straightforward and simple: Farm boy
goes to big city, falls victim to seedy
characters and cut-throat lifestyle,
realizes the virtues of home and
returns. It is the humor and warmth
with which this old story is retold and
the vivid freshness of the perfor
mances that make this production
come to life.
The play revolves around Anthony
Haney, as Cephus Miles, whose stage
presence is strong enough to make
the physical and thematic structures

tor, and both Robinson and Scott rise
to the task, serving as a kind of chorus
as well as bringing each of their
numerous characters to life. At dif
ferent times, they represent the
voices of temptation, conscience and
memory. Flitting freely around the
stage, they change costumes and in
teract with each other, the unifying
element of all their activities being
Cephus and his story.
The chorus is effective, and one of
the dramatic techniques most heavily
employed is the monologue. Cephus
is a great yarn spinner, and much of
the play relies on his ability to hold
our attention — to make us see from
his descriptions. Haney maintains an

to make us laugh.

work. This is a journey in the life of
one man; we meet people and hear
stories only as they relate to him. On
occasion the self-indulgence of the
character seems excessive, but overall
his experiences are broad enough and
colorful enough to hold our interest
and make us laugh.
The main reason for this is the
shining talent of Margarette Robin
son and Esther Scott as the two
"women." Together they run the
gamut from Baptist preacher to wino,
from farm girl to army sergeant and
everything in between in the course
of portraying the events of Cephus'
life.
These are roles to challenge any ac

intensity that does just that, even
when the yarn, as any true Southern
tale will, begins to drag.
The emphasis in "Home" is
definitely on the stories that color and
fill the loosely woven story line. The
plot, however, cannot be ignored;
several elements of the plot are disap
pointing. Painfully sincere, Cephus
refuses to violate his religious train
ing. "Thou shalt not kill" means thou
shalt not kill, even in Vietnam. The
innocent farm boy is imprisoned and
accused of having communist sym
pathies; he cannot go home and
therefore leaves for the city.
When he does return years later, it
is only because "someone" obtained

and slipped to him the deed for his
property in South Carolina. Even
though the play never aspires to
realism, these incongruous con
trivances are a weakness.
The true strength of the play, on
which it soars beyond average
theater, is its humor — and an honest,
wholesome, universal humor it is. We
cannot help but see a bit of ourselves
in stories about Cephus' first love, his
baptisin' or his switchin' — for
shootin' craps on the sabbath. These
glimpses of a romanticized American
childhood thrive in the true Huck
Finn tradition. Other memories, of
jail and friends killed in the war, are
less pleasant; but in contrast, they
reinforce the joy of coming home.
Other sharp contrasts are also im
portant. Images of rural and urban
life are repeatedly juxtaposed: the
sweet smell of spring and the myth of
the perfume night; the innocence of
virginity and the shallowness of pros
titution; the lasting value of land and
the ephemeral value of money. Most
effective is the use of gospel and jazz
music.
Again, Robinson and Scott are in
top form when singing in soulful har
mony with a depth of emotion that
the breezy jazz will never achieve.
The tensions between these two
worlds allow us to anticipate and fi
nally revel in Cephus' final return.
