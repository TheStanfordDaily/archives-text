# 'Camelot' lacks energy, grandeur
## 
### ELAINE WANG 
The San Jose Civic Light Opera's
50th-season opener, "Camelot,"
failed to present a grand or
coherent performance re-creating the
legend of King Arthur and his realm.
The opening scene, for one, does
not enhance the show: a Star Wars
type presentation of the story —
"Once-upon-a-time" stuff — with
single lines of text receding into the
glittery-night background. Such gim
micks risk being silly rather than in
novative.
The sets, also, were distracting.
The main set, composed of huge
rock-like structures with several
staircases — the indoor Stonehenge
look — dwarfed the actors and the
action onstage.
The best part of Saturday night's
performance was the orchestra, con
ducted by Henry Mollicone. The
music was technically fine and ex
tremely sensitive to the actors; not
once was any singer overwhelmed by
a swell of sound from the orchestra.
Much less can be said of the sound
system itself, which required
microphones to be attached to the
performers' clothing. A turn of the
head or a misplaced embrace created
a fading-out of sound or interfering
noises such as static. Thus amplified,
the voices at times sounded like they
came from an old, scratchy record.
Besides being annoying, it made the
music of "Camelot" downright un
musical.
The entire production suffered
from the not-quite-put-together
predicament. Actors seemed
awkward — uncomfortable with dan
gling arms, unsure of where to walk
on the stage, and in many instances,
not singing with full volume. The lat
ter may be the fault of the sound sys
tem, as the volume was constantly
fiddled with while performers were
singing or talking.
When Lancelot sang "If Ever I
Would Leave You" to Guenevere, he
hardly touched her, but spent most of
the tune circling around her and sit
ting across the room and looking at
her. The mood was just not there for
these supposedly tormented lovers.
In contrast, the scene where
Guenevere and Arthur discussed
"What Do the Simple Folk Do?" put
the queen and king on much more
lover-like terms.
It isn't that the San Jose Civic Light

Opera is prudish or even conserva
tive; the dancing in "The Lusty
Month of May" was blatantly sexual,
as was some choreography during
"Fie on Goodness" between the
knights. This inconsistency was dis
concerting; one wondered why pas
sion isn't full-fledged throughout the
production.
What was missing was a sense of
the ensemble, a rapport within the
performing group which gives it en
ergy. The main characters were not
portrayed poorly, but they were un
directed.
Noel Harrison (Arthur) did a lot of
singing into the air, not at the audi
ence or other people onstage. In the

last scene, when King Arthur enjoins
Tom of Warwick to proclaim the
glories of Camelot and the Round
Table, Harrison thrust his hands into
the air but maintained a distance
from the boy. The enthusiasm that
these players might have for their
roles simply didn't connect between
them, not emotionally nor physically;
King Arthur should have kept a hand
on the boy's shoulder while he told
him of the wonders of his realm.
The words of the musical came
through well, and enunciation in the

choruses was creditable. But many
lines came through as simply lines in
the play, without full evocation of the
character behind them. Lancelot, for
one, does not suit action to words in
his love for Guenevere.
Virginia Lee, playing Guenevere,
puts the correct catch in her voice
when necessary but doesn't show her
heartbreak at betraying Arthur by
loving Lancelot. She is, however,
wholly believable at the end when she
looks for forgiveness in Arthur's eyes.
(Lee has a relatively strong, high
voice. The problem is that in trying to
enunciate in the lower voice — where
she is weaker — her singing takes on
a raw edge.)

By far the most energetic and ver
satile performer in the Civic Light
Opera's "Camelot" was Jae Ross in
the role of evil Mordred, come to
topple Arthur from the heights of
civilization. Ross commanded the
stage; he had the presence to use the
space and his props. His appearance
is brief in the play, but Ross made the
drama come alive. A dash of his en
ergy is what the rest of this produc
tion needs.
The musical runs through Sunday
at the Center for the Performing
Arts, San Jose.

The San Jose Civic Light Opera's
50th-season opener, "Camelot,"
failed to present a grand or
coherent performance re-creating the
legend of King Arthur and his realm.
The opening scene, for one, does
not enhance the show: a Star Wars
type presentation of the story —
"Once-upon-a-time" stuff — with
single lines of text receding into the
glittery-night background. Such gim
micks risk being silly rather than in
novative.
The sets, also, were distracting.
The main set, composed of huge
rock-like structures with several
staircases — the indoor Stonehenge
look — dwarfed the actors and the
action onstage.
The best part of Saturday night's
performance was the orchestra, con
ducted by Henry Mollicone. The
music was technically fine and ex
tremely sensitive to the actors; not
once was any singer overwhelmed by
a swell of sound from the orchestra.
Much less can be said of the sound
system itself, which required
microphones to be attached to the
performers' clothing. A turn of the
head or a misplaced embrace created
a fading-out of sound or interfering
noises such as static. Thus amplified,
the voices at times sounded like they
came from an old, scratchy record.
Besides being annoying, it made the
music of "Camelot" downright un
musical.
The entire production suffered
from the not-quite-put-together
predicament. Actors seemed
awkward — uncomfortable with dan
gling arms, unsure of where to walk
on the stage, and in many instances,
not singing with full volume. The lat
ter may be the fault of the sound sys
tem, as the volume was constantly
fiddled with while performers were
singing or talking.
When Lancelot sang "If Ever I
Would Leave You" to Guenevere, he
hardly touched her, but spent most of
the tune circling around her and sit
ting across the room and looking at
her. The mood was just not there for
these supposedly tormented lovers.
In contrast, the scene where
Guenevere and Arthur discussed
"What Do the Simple Folk Do?" put
the queen and king on much more
lover-like terms.
It isn't that the San Jose Civic Light

Opera is prudish or even conserva
tive; the dancing in "The Lusty
Month of May" was blatantly sexual,
as was some choreography during
"Fie on Goodness" between the
knights. This inconsistency was dis
concerting; one wondered why pas
sion isn't full-fledged throughout the
production.
What was missing was a sense of
the ensemble, a rapport within the
performing group which gives it en
ergy. The main characters were not
portrayed poorly, but they were un
directed.
Noel Harrison (Arthur) did a lot of
singing into the air, not at the audi
ence or other people onstage. In the

last scene, when King Arthur enjoins
Tom of Warwick to proclaim the
glories of Camelot and the Round
Table, Harrison thrust his hands into
the air but maintained a distance
from the boy. The enthusiasm that
these players might have for their
roles simply didn't connect between
them, not emotionally nor physically;
King Arthur should have kept a hand
on the boy's shoulder while he told
him of the wonders of his realm.
The words of the musical came
through well, and enunciation in the

choruses was creditable. But many
lines came through as simply lines in
the play, without full evocation of the
character behind them. Lancelot, for
one, does not suit action to words in
his love for Guenevere.
Virginia Lee, playing Guenevere,
puts the correct catch in her voice
when necessary but doesn't show her
heartbreak at betraying Arthur by
loving Lancelot. She is, however,
wholly believable at the end when she
looks for forgiveness in Arthur's eyes.
(Lee has a relatively strong, high
voice. The problem is that in trying to
enunciate in the lower voice — where
she is weaker — her singing takes on
a raw edge.)
