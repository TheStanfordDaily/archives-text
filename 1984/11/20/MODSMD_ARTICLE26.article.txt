# 'No Small Affair' inconsequential, small movie
## 
### AMY FRIEDMAN 
The title of "No Small Affair," di
rected by Jerry Schatzberg, is mis
leading. The affair in the movie is
small, or at least short-lived, and the
movie itself is a small affair. It's one
of those films that will be forgotten in
a short time, say 15 or 20 minutes
after it screens. It is not bad, per se,
just small and inconsequential.
Charles Cummings (Jon Cryer) is a
16-year-old with an itching shutter
finger. He photographs everything he
can with the exception of people. He
doesn't like to shoot people, but he
will for money, which he is saving so
he can go to Milan where he would
like to be a professional photog
rapher. By accident, he captures the
face of Laura Victor (Demi Moore)
in one of his pictures; her beauty
captures him. He enlarges the picture
in pieces and hangs it in his
darkroom/bathroom. From there, in a
series of movie coincidences, he finds
this mystery woman/struggling rock
singer; they become friends and blah,
blah, blah.
The supporting cast includes an un
believable nag of a mother (Ann
Wedgeworth), her too-Californian
male friend (Jeffrey Tambor), her
elder playboy son (Peter Frechette)
and his fiancee (Elizabeth Daily).
The only one of this bunch who seems
the slightest bit real is Elizabeth
Daily, who has, unfortunately, a very
small role.
Jon Cryer, as Charles, does a good
job. He looks so much like Matthew
Broderick ("WarGames") that it's
not surprising that Cryer was
Broderick's stand-in at one time in
Neil Simon's "Brighton Beach
Memoirs." It is uncanny how similar
the two are in their mannerisms and
their humor. Because of this it is hard
to evaluate the originality of Cryer's
performance. Demi Moore also is
similar to another actress — herself in
her former role of Jackie Templeton

on "General Hospital." She can't
seem to escape from soap-opera
overacting and drags down any
buoyancy that Cryer establishes.
Director Schatzberg has improved
since "The Seduction of Joe Tynan"
and regressed since "Honeysuckle
Rose." He is unable to pick scripts
that move. The screenplay by Charles
Bolt and Terence Mulcahy relies too
heavily on the sometimes-funny,
sometimes-too-cute dialogue and

narration. The look of the film is
fresh and often breathtaking, thanks
to Oscar-winning director of photog
raphy ("Close Encounters of the
Third Kind") Vilmos Zsigmond.
With such credits as "The Deer
Hunter," "Deliverance" and the up
coming "The River," one has to
wonder why Zsigmond would choose
to work on this little film.
Maybe the sweetness of the story
was just never realized under

Schatzberg's direction. The charac
ters were meant to be liked and the
almost-predictable ending had a two
second parting shot that forces the
viewer to leave the theater with a
smile and maybe even a grin. The
music was good and the editing crisp.
In short, the potential was there. Still,
there is nothing so good or so bad in
the movie that it should attract much
attention and, implicitly, money. Save
yours on this one.

on rock singer Demi Moore. Lett: Demi Moore and Jon Cryer share a
romantic moment in "No Small Affair," a comedy set in San Francisco.
