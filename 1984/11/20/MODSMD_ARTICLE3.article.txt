# Fans criticize Big Game police

Cardinal football players were not the only
students who left the Astroturf after Big Game
with bumps and bruises.
Several Stanford students say they were
punched, shoved to the ground and hit with
nightsticks by security personnel after entering
the playing field at the end of Saturday's game
against the University of California at
Berkeley's Memorial Stadium.
Stanford police, who were part of a force that
included Berkeley police and a security group
made up of Berkeley and Stanford students, see
it differently.
"There was no misconduct on their part," ac
cording to Capt. Raoul Niemeyer of the Stan
ford Police Department. In fact, the officers
present handled the "rowdiest, rudest crowd of
Stanford students they had seen ... as passively
as possible," Niemeyer said.
"The fact that no arrests were made
demonstrates the control of the officers," he
said.
The post-game clash between fans and secur
ity personnel ensued when a number of stu
dents, trying to join the Band and the
ceremonial Axe, jumped the low wall dividing
stadium seating from the playing field.
Stanford Police Capt. Marvin Moore said fans
are not allowed onto athletic fields after events
because "there are all kinds of possibilities of
injuries." After last year's Harvard-Yale game,

for instance, a woman received a severe head
injury from a falling goalpost, he said.
Neither Moore, who was in charge of the
Stanford officers at the game, University Om
budsman John Goheen nor University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy's office reported hearing
any student complaints about the alledged
roughness of the police involved.
But other students and faculty members told
a different story.
In an open letter to Kennedy, five Branner
Hall resident assistants protested "vehemently"
the "unnecessary use of force by members of
Stanford security police" at the end of the
game. Several other students also contacted The
Daily to discuss the behavior of Stanford and
Berkeley security forces.
"It seemed to me that a lot of deputies were
using a lot of extraordinary violence to subdue
the students," said sophomore Jeff Philliber,
who viewed the scene from the stands. Several
students reported seeing a police officer with his
nightstick around the neck of a student, drag
ging the student off the field, but no serious in
juries were reported.
Junior Hubert Cheng, who says he was
knocked breathless with a nightstick and shoved
down the stairs of an exit tunnel, said, "I didn't
know we weren't supposed to be on the field."
Several students said they remembered
thousands of Cal fans rushing the field at the
