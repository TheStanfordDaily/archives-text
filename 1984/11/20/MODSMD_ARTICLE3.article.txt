# Fans criticize Big Game police
## 
### CLINT HIGHFILL Senior staff writer 
Cardinal football players were not the only
students who left the Astroturf after Big Game
with bumps and bruises.
Several Stanford students say they were
punched, shoved to the ground and hit with
nightsticks by security personnel after entering
the playing field at the end of Saturday's game
against the University of California at
Berkeley's Memorial Stadium.
Stanford police, who were part of a force that
included Berkeley police and a security group
made up of Berkeley and Stanford students, see
it differently.
"There was no misconduct on their part," ac
cording to Capt. Raoul Niemeyer of the Stan
ford Police Department. In fact, the officers
present handled the "rowdiest, rudest crowd of
Stanford students they had seen ... as passively
as possible," Niemeyer said.
"The fact that no arrests were made
demonstrates the control of the officers," he
said.
The post-game clash between fans and secur
ity personnel ensued when a number of stu
dents, trying to join the Band and the
ceremonial Axe, jumped the low wall dividing
stadium seating from the playing field.
Stanford Police Capt. Marvin Moore said fans
are not allowed onto athletic fields after events
because "there are all kinds of possibilities of
injuries." After last year's Harvard-Yale game,

for instance, a woman received a severe head
injury from a falling goalpost, he said.
Neither Moore, who was in charge of the
Stanford officers at the game, University Om
budsman John Goheen nor University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy's office reported hearing
any student complaints about the alledged
roughness of the police involved.
But other students and faculty members told
a different story.
In an open letter to Kennedy, five Branner
Hall resident assistants protested "vehemently"
the "unnecessary use of force by members of
Stanford security police" at the end of the
game. Several other students also contacted The
Daily to discuss the behavior of Stanford and
Berkeley security forces.
"It seemed to me that a lot of deputies were
using a lot of extraordinary violence to subdue
the students," said sophomore Jeff Philliber,
who viewed the scene from the stands. Several
students reported seeing a police officer with his
nightstick around the neck of a student, drag
ging the student off the field, but no serious in
juries were reported.
Junior Hubert Cheng, who says he was
knocked breathless with a nightstick and shoved
down the stairs of an exit tunnel, said, "I didn't
know we weren't supposed to be on the field."
Several students said they remembered
thousands of Cal fans rushing the field at the

end of the 1982 Big Game and
therefore believed they were allowed
to enter the field as well.
Keith Light, alumni advisor for the
Axe Committee and associate direc
tor of undergraduate admissions,
concurred that "It was not made clear
at the stadium that students were not
to come onto the field."
But Cal's athletic department busi
ness manager, Mike Moff, said the
students should have known better
than to enter the field.
"There was an announcement
made to that effect toward the end of
the game," he said. In addition, he
said there is not a school in the Pacific
10 Conference that does allow stu
dents on the field after games — and
that Cal fans succeeded in getting on
the field in 1982 only because of
"circumstances surrounding (the
game) that were totally unusual."
Senior Brian Jeffrey said he was
"throttled with a club," by a
policeman.

Jeffrey said he shoved a student se
curity guard after the guard shoved a
young woman. He said that at that
point a policeman came over and
shoved a nightstick into his adam's
apple.
"It hurt Jike hell." Jeffrey said.
Senior Scott Smith says he escaped
from the grasp of several ushers, but
when a group of four ushers and
policemen grabbed him he quit strug
gling.
As they hustled him off the field.
Smith said he lost his shoe. "I went
down to pick it up and the cop hit me
in the eye." he said.
Cheng described one student se
curity guard who was "slam dancing
into everyone."
"She would run, put her shoulder
into their rib cage and push up," he
said.
Smith said he saw one student who
had his arm twisted behind behind his
back by an officer who was forcing
him off the field, and another scuffle
in which an officer was hitting a stu
dent behind the knees with his
nightstick.

But Cal's athletic department busi

students should have known better
than to enter the field.
"There was an announcement
made to that effect toward the end of
the game," he said. In addition, he
said there is not a school in the Pacific

that Cal fans succeeded in getting on
the field in 1982 only because of

Senior Brian Jeffrey said he was
"throttled with a club," by a
policeman.

Jeffrey said he shoved a student se

point a policeman came over and
shoved a nightstick into his adam's
apple.
"It hurt Jike hell." Jeffrey said.

Cardinal football players were not the only
students who left the Astroturf after Big Game
with bumps and bruises.
Several Stanford students say they were
punched, shoved to the ground and hit with
nightsticks by security personnel after entering
the playing field at the end of Saturday's game
against the University of California at
Berkeley's Memorial Stadium.
Stanford police, who were part of a force that
included Berkeley police and a security group
made up of Berkeley and Stanford students, see
it differently.
"There was no misconduct on their part," ac
cording to Capt. Raoul Niemeyer of the Stan
ford Police Department. In fact, the officers
present handled the "rowdiest, rudest crowd of
Stanford students they had seen ... as passively
as possible," Niemeyer said.
"The fact that no arrests were made
demonstrates the control of the officers," he
said.
The post-game clash between fans and secur
ity personnel ensued when a number of stu
dents, trying to join the Band and the
ceremonial Axe, jumped the low wall dividing
stadium seating from the playing field.
Stanford Police Capt. Marvin Moore said fans
are not allowed onto athletic fields after events
because "there are all kinds of possibilities of
injuries." After last year's Harvard-Yale game,

for instance, a woman received a severe head
injury from a falling goalpost, he said.
Neither Moore, who was in charge of the
Stanford officers at the game, University Om
budsman John Goheen nor University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy's office reported hearing
any student complaints about the alledged
roughness of the police involved.
But other students and faculty members told
a different story.
In an open letter to Kennedy, five Branner
Hall resident assistants protested "vehemently"
the "unnecessary use of force by members of
Stanford security police" at the end of the
game. Several other students also contacted The
Daily to discuss the behavior of Stanford and
Berkeley security forces.
"It seemed to me that a lot of deputies were
using a lot of extraordinary violence to subdue
the students," said sophomore Jeff Philliber,
who viewed the scene from the stands. Several
students reported seeing a police officer with his
nightstick around the neck of a student, drag
ging the student off the field, but no serious in
juries were reported.
Junior Hubert Cheng, who says he was
knocked breathless with a nightstick and shoved
down the stairs of an exit tunnel, said, "I didn't
know we weren't supposed to be on the field."
Several students said they remembered
thousands of Cal fans rushing the field at the

therefore believed they were allowed
