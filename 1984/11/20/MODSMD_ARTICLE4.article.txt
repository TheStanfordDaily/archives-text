# Lyons praises IFC rules
## 
### BAIE NETZER Senior staff writer 
The party guidelines issued by the Inter-Fraternity
Council (IFC) last week are "a thoughtful response to
some very real problems," according to James Lyons,
dean of student affairs.
Lyons said he and Associate Dean of Residential Edu
cation Norm Robinson have yet to review the guidelines
thoroughly. But Lyons, saying his impression of the
guidelines is "quite positive," praised the IFC for its swift
action.
He also indicated that last week's probation.of Beta
Theta Pi fraternity might now be one step closer to being
lifted.
"The Beta probation was supposed to be until some
sort of guidelines were established and accepted," Lyons
said. "I think the IFC reacted very promptly to issue those
guidelines."
IFC President Rick Hoskins said he expects the Betas
to be taken off probation as soon as the IFC completes its
final review of the guidelines.
"It'll probably be after we issue our final letter to Norm
Robinson," Hoskins said. He said the IFC would probably
issue that letter at the beginning of next week.
Meanwhile, in a separate incident at the Delta Kappa

Epsilon House, a
Stanford police
officer was
reportedly
detained by par
tygoers as he at
tempted to
pursue two stu
dents who had
been riding on a
motorbike with
open alcohol
before ducking
into the Deke
house.
The officer
reportedly en
tered a Deke
party on Nov. 9,

where people spilled beer on him and allowed the two
suspects to escape in the crowd.
Hoskins, who is also a member of the Dekes, said the
IFC guidelines will probably serve to quell a move for ac
tion against the Dekes. Because a police report on an inci
dent at the house appeared after the guidelines were
issued, Hoskins said the University felt action had already
been taken.
"The University felt the IFC had handled the party sit
uation well enough, so it would not merit putting the
Dekes on probation," Hoskins said.
Lyons said the guidelines would have to be reviewed
and endorsed by the individual fraternities and the Uni
versity.

"However, the University's accep
tance will be premised on the accep
tance of the guidelines by the individ
ual houses," he said.
Lyons said he expects Diana Con
klin, director of the Row, also to be
involved in reviewing the party
guidelines.
The IFC also established commit
tees to "discuss and propose solutions
for" negative treatment of women by
fraternity members and fraternities'
focus on alcohol consumption at its
Thursday meeting.
The formation of the committees
came after Lyons addressed the IFC
in what he termed a "very forthright,
frank" speech.
