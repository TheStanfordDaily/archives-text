Soviets reprimand U.S. company
MOSCOW — A California company specializing in scientific equip
ment has been accused of being a front for U.S. intelligence services and
has become the first American company to lose its accreditation for
doing business in the Soviet Union.
The accusation against the firm. California International Trade of
Palo Alto, was carried by Izvestia, the official government news
paper. A spokesman for the company said the charge is "completely
false." The company's president and sole owner, Ralph Gregorian of
Palo Alto, also was accused in the article of selling used or ab
solete equipment and over-charging Soviet customers.
"The company position is that the charges are false individually and
collectively but beyond that I am not prepared to go," Michael Herzen, a
vice president of CIT from Redwood City, said in an interview.
The Soviet refusal to renew the company's accreditation, which
was granted only two years ago, came as a complete shock, Herzen said.
For the nine years before CIT received accreditation, it was able to
operate here legally, selling medical and laboratory equipment, hut
without the special privileges enjoyed by the 23 American companies
who are accredited by the government.
17 killed as copter crashes
CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. — A fire broke out aboard a helicopter as it
lifted a piece of artillery during a training mission yesterday, killing three
Marines, injuring at least 11 others and leaving three missing, officials
said.
Seventeen servicemen were aboard the $22 million CH-53E helicop
ter — the Marines' newest and largest — including five crewmen and 12
passengers. Rescuers were combing the area last night for the missing,
said Lt. S.B. Jack of Camp Lejeune, who provided the casualty figures.
The helicopter was lifting a 155 mm howitzer when the craft caught
fire, said Capt. Craig Fisher of Camp Lejeune's public affairs office, but
he said he didn't know if the copter had crashed or landed normally.
Jack termed the accident a "hard landing."
Anthony Rothfork, spokesman for the Marine Corps in Washington,
D.C., said the helicopter did crash, but Lance Cpl. Greg Fedorev of New
River Air Station just south of Camp Lejeune, where the craft was
based, said he couldn't confirm that.
"There was a fire on board ... but as far as I know it hasn't been con
firmed that there was a crash," said Fedorev.
Reagan halts airline investigation
WASHINGTON — President Reagan, citing "foreign-policy
reasons," has ordered the Department of Justice to end a major criminal
antitrust investigation into allegations of price-fixing on air routes be
tween the United States and Great Britain, the department announced
yesterday.
Reagan's unusual intervention, backed by top officials at the White
House and at the departments of Justice and State, appeared to reflect
administration concern that the investigation could possibly damage
close diplomatic ties with the British.
Indeed, one administration official, who requested anonymity, sum
marized the president's reasoning by saying: "The adverse foreign-rela
tions impact of pressing forward (with the investigation) and possibly
having indictments would outweigh any benefit to the U.S. consumer."
A spokesman for the department's antitrust division, Mark Sheehan,
insisted that there was no link between Reagan's decision, reached late
last week, and current discussions between U.S. and British officials to
allow proposed cut-rate trans-Atlantic air fares.
"There was no quid pro quo," Sheehan said, "nor was this investiga
tion ever discussed at the same time that negotiations on international
air fares were discussed." However, based on "purely legal grounds,"
the department would have pursued the inquiry, he said.
The investigation by a federal grand jury was understood to be
looking into allegations that British Airways and several other airlines
had conspired in 1982 to force out of business Laker Airways, which
pioneered cut-rate trans-Atlantic fares but subsequently collapsed.
French troops on alert in Chad
PARIS — France stepped up a new war of nerves with Libya's Col.
Moammar Khadafy yesterday by placing 250 paratroopers on a state of
readiness to move back into Chad unless Libyan forces are withdrawn
from the north of the country.
The French move appeared designed to increase the pressure on the
Libyan leader while allowing him more time to withdraw all his troops
from the former French colony. According to French estimates, Libya
still has around 1.000 soldiers in Chad after failing to respect an agree
ment to complete a full withdrawal of its troops by Nov. 10.
Speaking to reporters on the Mediterranean island of Malta yesterday,
Khadafy said he was "totally committed" to the troop withdrawal agree
ment negotiated with France in September. He said that, in the future,
Libya would only move into Chad if another country went in first.
Marcos reportedly has surgery
MANILA, Philippines — President Ferdinand Marcos underwent
major heart and kidney surgery five days ago, a former information min
ister said yesterday.
Francisco Tatad, quoting unnamed palace sources in his column in the
independent newspaper Business Day, said the operations were success
ful but it was not known if the president "was completely past his crisis."
"At the moment, we have no statement. I think it's all baloney," a
spokesman at the Information Ministry said.
Tatad said Marcos was admitted last Tuesday to the Kidney Center in
suburban Quezon City. Marcos had held a 90-minute meeting with visit
ing Sen. Christopher Dodd (D-Conn.) the same day, Tatad said.
Medical experts said Marcos "needed at least two operations, one in
volving the kidney and another the heart, and it is not known whether
doctors had to perform just one or two surgeries," wrote Tatad, who
resigned as a Cabinet minister in 1980.
The 67-year-old Marcos has not been seen on live television for
several days although press releases from the palace have continued.
The latest press statement had him ordering the acting armed forces
chief, Lt.-Gen. Fidel Ramos, to investigate an alleged massacre in the
southern Philippines.
Israel seeks additional U.S. aid
WASHINGTON — Two teams of Israeli officials began talks here
yesterday about additional U.S. aid for the Jewish state, with Israel ex
pected to ask that its present military assistance level of $1.4 billion be
increased next year by $700 million, or by about 50 percent.
That comes on top of indications given during Israeli Prime Minister
Shimon Peres' visit here last month that his government probably will
seek an additional $1.5 billion in economic aid over two years to battle
raging inflation. Such increased amounts would raise Israel's total U.S.
aid from $2.6 billion in the present fiscal year to $4 billion or more in fis
cal 1986.
Requests of that magnitude pose some potentially difficult choices for
the Reagan administration, which is contemplating asking for major
budget cuts in domestic spending to reduce the federal deficit.
The Israeli requests also come as the administration, which had
deferred several Mideast arms decisions until after the U.S. presidential
election, is facing a decision on whether to sell large amounts of tanks,
jet fighters, air transports and various kinds of ground-launched and air
launched missiles to Saudi Arabia and Jordan.
Stocks stay in post-election slump
NEW YORK — The stock market declined broadly yesterday con
tinuing the post-election slump that began almost two weeks ago.
Several individual issues sold off sharply on earnings disappointments
in a sluggish session on Wall Street.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 31.03 points last
week, slipped another 2.65 to 1,185.29.

Reagan halts airline investigation
WASHINGTON — President Reagan, citing "foreign-policy
reasons," has ordered the Department of Justice to end a major criminal
antitrust investigation into allegations of price-fixing on air routes be
tween the United States and Great Britain, the department announced
yesterday.
Reagan's unusual intervention, backed by top officials at the White
House and at the departments of Justice and State, appeared to reflect
administration concern that the investigation could possibly damage
close diplomatic ties with the British.
Indeed, one administration official, who requested anonymity, sum
marized the president's reasoning by saying: "The adverse foreign-rela
tions impact of pressing forward (with the investigation) and possibly
having indictments would outweigh any benefit to the U.S. consumer."
A spokesman for the department's antitrust division, Mark Sheehan,
insisted that there was no link between Reagan's decision, reached late
last week, and current discussions between U.S. and British officials to
allow proposed cut-rate trans-Atlantic air fares.
"There was no quid pro quo," Sheehan said, "nor was this investiga
tion ever discussed at the same time that negotiations on international
air fares were discussed." However, based on "purely legal grounds,"
the department would have pursued the inquiry, he said.
The investigation by a federal grand jury was understood to be
looking into allegations that British Airways and several other airlines
had conspired in 1982 to force out of business Laker Airways, which
pioneered cut-rate trans-Atlantic fares but subsequently collapsed.
French troops on alert in Chad
PARIS — France stepped up a new war of nerves with Libya's Col.
Moammar Khadafy yesterday by placing 250 paratroopers on a state of
readiness to move back into Chad unless Libyan forces are withdrawn
from the north of the country.
The French move appeared designed to increase the pressure on the
Libyan leader while allowing him more time to withdraw all his troops
from the former French colony. According to French estimates, Libya
still has around 1.000 soldiers in Chad after failing to respect an agree
ment to complete a full withdrawal of its troops by Nov. 10.
Speaking to reporters on the Mediterranean island of Malta yesterday,
Khadafy said he was "totally committed" to the troop withdrawal agree
ment negotiated with France in September. He said that, in the future,
Libya would only move into Chad if another country went in first.
Marcos reportedly has surgery
MANILA, Philippines — President Ferdinand Marcos underwent
major heart and kidney surgery five days ago, a former information min
ister said yesterday.
Francisco Tatad, quoting unnamed palace sources in his column in the
independent newspaper Business Day, said the operations were success
ful but it was not known if the president "was completely past his crisis."
"At the moment, we have no statement. I think it's all baloney," a
spokesman at the Information Ministry said.
Tatad said Marcos was admitted last Tuesday to the Kidney Center in
suburban Quezon City. Marcos had held a 90-minute meeting with visit
ing Sen. Christopher Dodd (D-Conn.) the same day, Tatad said.
Medical experts said Marcos "needed at least two operations, one in
volving the kidney and another the heart, and it is not known whether
doctors had to perform just one or two surgeries," wrote Tatad, who
resigned as a Cabinet minister in 1980.
The 67-year-old Marcos has not been seen on live television for
several days although press releases from the palace have continued.
The latest press statement had him ordering the acting armed forces
chief, Lt.-Gen. Fidel Ramos, to investigate an alleged massacre in the
southern Philippines.
Israel seeks additional U.S. aid
WASHINGTON — Two teams of Israeli officials began talks here
yesterday about additional U.S. aid for the Jewish state, with Israel ex
pected to ask that its present military assistance level of $1.4 billion be
increased next year by $700 million, or by about 50 percent.
That comes on top of indications given during Israeli Prime Minister
Shimon Peres' visit here last month that his government probably will
seek an additional $1.5 billion in economic aid over two years to battle
raging inflation. Such increased amounts would raise Israel's total U.S.
aid from $2.6 billion in the present fiscal year to $4 billion or more in fis
cal 1986.
Requests of that magnitude pose some potentially difficult choices for
the Reagan administration, which is contemplating asking for major
budget cuts in domestic spending to reduce the federal deficit.
The Israeli requests also come as the administration, which had
deferred several Mideast arms decisions until after the U.S. presidential
election, is facing a decision on whether to sell large amounts of tanks,
jet fighters, air transports and various kinds of ground-launched and air
launched missiles to Saudi Arabia and Jordan.
Stocks stay in post-election slump
NEW YORK — The stock market declined broadly yesterday con
tinuing the post-election slump that began almost two weeks ago.
Several individual issues sold off sharply on earnings disappointments
in a sluggish session on Wall Street.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 31.03 points last
week, slipped another 2.65 to 1,185.29.

Soviets reprimand U.S. company
MOSCOW — A California company specializing in scientific equip
ment has been accused of being a front for U.S. intelligence services and
has become the first American company to lose its accreditation for
doing business in the Soviet Union.
The accusation against the firm. California International Trade of
Palo Alto, was carried by Izvestia, the official government news
paper. A spokesman for the company said the charge is "completely
false." The company's president and sole owner, Ralph Gregorian of
Palo Alto, also was accused in the article of selling used or ab
solete equipment and over-charging Soviet customers.
"The company position is that the charges are false individually and
collectively but beyond that I am not prepared to go," Michael Herzen, a
vice president of CIT from Redwood City, said in an interview.
The Soviet refusal to renew the company's accreditation, which
was granted only two years ago, came as a complete shock, Herzen said.
For the nine years before CIT received accreditation, it was able to
operate here legally, selling medical and laboratory equipment, hut
without the special privileges enjoyed by the 23 American companies
who are accredited by the government.
17 killed as copter crashes
CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. — A fire broke out aboard a helicopter as it
lifted a piece of artillery during a training mission yesterday, killing three
Marines, injuring at least 11 others and leaving three missing, officials
said.
Seventeen servicemen were aboard the $22 million CH-53E helicop
ter — the Marines' newest and largest — including five crewmen and 12
passengers. Rescuers were combing the area last night for the missing,
said Lt. S.B. Jack of Camp Lejeune, who provided the casualty figures.
The helicopter was lifting a 155 mm howitzer when the craft caught
fire, said Capt. Craig Fisher of Camp Lejeune's public affairs office, but
he said he didn't know if the copter had crashed or landed normally.
Jack termed the accident a "hard landing."
Anthony Rothfork, spokesman for the Marine Corps in Washington,
D.C., said the helicopter did crash, but Lance Cpl. Greg Fedorev of New
River Air Station just south of Camp Lejeune, where the craft was
based, said he couldn't confirm that.
"There was a fire on board ... but as far as I know it hasn't been con
