## 261 dead in Mexico blasts 
### 
TLALNEPANTLA, Mexico — A
series of powerful explosions
destroyed a working-class neighboi
hood just north of Mexico City begin
ning at dawn yesterday and at least
261 people died in the blasts and the
raging fires that followed.
Hundreds of thousands of people
were evacuated from the surrounding
area because officials feared the pos
sibility of more explosions, and
already the disaster was being called
one of the worst in modern Mexican
history.
At least 80 homes were leveled in
the district of San Juan Ixhuatepec,
according to Jose Domingo Garrido,
director of operations for the Mexico
City Police Department. Other es
timates were that as many as 600
residences had been flattened.
Thousands of panic-stricken resi
dents, clad in nightclothes and under
wear, ran into the streets when the
ear-splitting blasts began around 6
a.m.
Lourdes Villa, whose husband
works for a dairy on the outskirts of

Mexico City, said she was thrown
against the wall of her kitchen when
the first explosion rocked her cinder
block home in San Juan Ixhuatepec.
"My God, I screamed. My children
screamed. There was fire and smoke
and noise, a lot of noise, coming at us
from all sides," she recalled as she
wandered around the edge of the
destroyed neighborhood hours later.
"I know some of my neighbors are
dead. I remember running past
houses that were turned into small
pieces of, well, into dust," she went
on. Her husband had already left for
work when the blasts began.
Villa said she counted nine sepa
rate explosions. Another woman,
Elenora Gomez, said she heard two
detonations "that sounded like thun
derclaps, but real big ones."
"There was so much screaming,
and so much smoke," Gomez said.
Extending her arm, she said, "I smell
like smoke all over. It was horrible, a
nightmare."
The number of dead, as reported
by Dr. Luis Sanchez Guerra, coroner
of Mexico state, rose steadily through

the day and is expected keep growing
when rescue workers are able to ex
amine the rubble more closely.
The number of injured was not
known but Red Cross and police offi
cials were estimating that at least 500
had been seriously hurt. They as well
as many of the less seriously injured
were taken to hospitals in the capital,
in the state of Mexico and the neigh
boring state of Hidalgo.
By nightfall, Mexico City firemen
were still pulling dead and wounded
from the rubble. A relatively small
fire continued out of control at the
center of the disaster zone and Pemex
authorities said they had decided to
let the flames burn themselves out
rather than risk the lives of
firefighters.
A huge cloud of dense black smoke
towered over the northern section of
the metropolitan area and flames
leaped hundreds of feet into the
morning sky as large storage tanks
containing explosive liquid fuels
ignited and detonated.
Four storage tanks with a total

capacity of more than 50,000 barrels
exploded at a facility owned b v
Pemex, the national petroleum
monopoly. Two other tanks were left
standing.
Many of the victims died in their
beds when huge pieces of the
destroyed tanks were sent flying
through the air and shattered their
homes. Others died in the raging fi re
ignited by the explosions.
The government placed all military
forces in the Valley of Mexico on
alert and ordered hundreds of sol
diers into the stricken area to help
with evacuation and to prevent
looting.
Ramon Mota Sanchez, Mexico City
police chief, said 66 acres were
"virtually razed."
Gov. Alfredo del Mazo of Mexico
state appeared stunned by the extent
of the damage after finishing a tour of
the area. "We are doing everything
we can to help these poor people," he
said, "and we are going to take steps
to avoid pillaging."
