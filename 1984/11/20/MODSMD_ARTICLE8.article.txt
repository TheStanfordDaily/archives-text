# Budget stumps Reagan advisers
## 
### 
SANTA BARBARA — President Reagan's
budget advisers are second-guessing the
president's campaign promises against tax increases
and Social Security cuts as they search for — but
cannot find — ways to cut federal spending by $50
billion in fiscal year 1986.
An administration official, who spoke only on
condition of anonymity, told The Associated Press
that the 12 high-level officials who comprise the
budget group are so badly splintered that they may
be unable to agree on where to recommend that
Reagan look for the spending cuts.
Instead, the official said the group may give
Reagan a long list of options, including cuts in
defense spending, and ask him to select enough
savings to total $50 billion.
That would be a highly unusual departure from
past White House practice. Reagan is known to
prefer that his advisers reach a consensus and pres
ent it for his approval or disapproval.
But the official said the task of finding $50 bil
lion in spending cuts appeared impossible, given
the fact that nearly two-thirds of the federal budget
is off limits.
After 12 hours of meetings last week, the group
agreed to recommend $50 billion in spending cuts
and to aim for a budget deficit of 4 percent of Gross
National Product for fiscal year 1986. declining to
2 percent in 1988.

That would translate into a deficit of roughly
$160 billion in 1986, compared with the projected
1986 deficit of $206 billion if no further action
were taken. The group's deficit target for 1988
would be just over $100 billion.
The group was formally charged with recom
mending to Reagan a deficit target figure to be
used as the basis for developing the fiscal year 1986
budget the administration will submit to Congress
in January.
Its findings are to be presented to Reagan when
he ends his extended Thanksgiving holiday here
and returns to Washington next week.
The official, expressing concern that the White
House had backed itself into a corner, said it would
be nearly impossible to achieve a $50 billion spend
ing reduction by simply cutting such federal pro
grams as Medicaid, Civil Service retirement, farm
price supports and student aid.
He said that after ruling out all the untouchable
areas in the budget — assuming that Reagan con
tinues with his inclination not to cut defense spend
ing, raise taxes or touch Social Security — there
remained only a total of $200 billion in spending
which could be cut.
In another budget matter, the White House yes
terday rejected a recommendation by the conserva
tive Heritage Foundation that individuals be
allowed to withdraw gradually from the Social Se

curity system in favor of private pension plans.
Meanwhile in Washington yesterday, several
developments dealing with the budget were
revealed:
• It was learned that the Reagan administration is
considering asking Congress to scale back the farm
price and income supports that are the safety net
for American agriculture but have become one of
the runaway items in the federal budget.
• A White House task force has ordered the Veter
ans Administration to determine how much the
government would save if it limited free care in VA
hospitals to veterans with service-connected ail
ments. Thousands of veterans who now get free
care would be forced to pay under such a plan; only
about a third of those now treated in VA hospitals
are there for service-related problems.
• State and local officials are challenging a Trea
sury Department study expected to show that such
jurisdictions will have surpluses of $65 billion a
year by 1989. The state and local officials, includ
ing Pennsylvania Gov. Richard Thornburgh, a Re
publican, are fearful the surplus estimate will be
used to justify further cuts in state and local aid.
