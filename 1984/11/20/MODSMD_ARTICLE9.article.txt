## Paranormalists grounded at conference 
### FRANK LESTER Staff writer 
It began with a strange bespectacled man
passing out pamphlets to the audience an
nouncing the return of Jesus Christ, and it
ended with an astrologer lambasting a scien
tist for not considering astrology a legitimate
scientific philosophy.
No, this wasn't a scene out of the script for
Armageddon. It was, instead, the scene of the
annual conference of the Committee for the
Scientific Investigation of Claims of the
Paranormal (CSICOP), held in Kresge
Auditorium last Saturday.
CSICOP is an organization that brings to
gether scientists, journalists and skeptics un
der the banner of what its chairman called
"exploring the claims of the paranormal" and
"labeling them nonsense" if they fail to stand
up to simple scientific tests.
The morning session at Kresge was devoted
to discussing and dissecting widespread
paranormal beliefs that have to do with outer
space in one form or another. At various
points, this meant that the group of four
panelists was either discussing theories about
ancient astronauts, unidentified flying objects
or astrology.
The session was at its most lively when the
battle lines between science and superstition
were drawn. Paranormalists were scattered
throughout the audience. The confrontations
they had with the scientists were frequently as
charged as the confrontations going on be
tween the panelists onstage.
One man in the audience was heard to ask
before the session began, "I wonder how
polarized the audience is between the
believers and the anti-believers?" His com
panion replied, "I think we'll find out, some
where in this."
And sure enough — they found out. Most
of the audience turned out to be sympathetic
to the cause of the panelists onstage, who
were battling on science's side. The one scien
tist who ventured to propose a paranormalist
bent in his philosophy was greeted with in
tense skepticism from the audience and his
fellow panelists alike.
That man was J. Allen Hynek, a professor
emeritus of astronomy from Northwestern
University. He began his address with a state
ment expressing his knowledge of the skep
ticism he felt in the hall. "You would prob
ably be surprised — or maybe you wouldn't
— by how many people suggested that I not

speak to this group."
Hynek went on to say, however, that he
feels a true affinity with science and against
paranormalism. He added, however, that this
did not alter his opinion about UFO research,
which he thinks is a completely valid scientific
methodology.
Hynek said to the capacity crowd, "I am
and always have been an enemy of pseudo
science, as I certainly have demonstrated
during the many years I've taught courses in
the nature and development of science."
He continued by saying that he believes
researching reports of UFOs is a valid way for

scientists to spend their time because it hasn't
been proven that UFOs violate known physi
cal laws.
He drew an analogy. "For instance, had
Washington at Valley Forge observed a
helicopter land and two men in unfamiliar
aviator suits get out and begin to converse
with each other, I daresay he would have re
garded the event either as magic or as
paranormal.
"Of course, we know today that helicopters

are not violating physical laws. The helicop
ters are simply part of the normal; in Wash
ington's time, they just didn't understand.
Certainly, in that sense, UFOs might be con
sidered paranormal."
Hynek went on to imply that he would only
consider backing away from his support of
UFO research if psychology could "counter
the thesis that something is physically going
on" in reports of UFOs visiting the earth. He
suggested that psychologists will have
achieved this when they discover a "mental
construct" or hallucinatory disorder that
would explain how geographically indepen-

dent witnesses see objects commonly classi
fied as UFOs.
Hynek was immediately put on the defen
sive by Philip Klass, the senior editor of Avia
tion Week and Space Technology, who
sported a photocopy from this month's edi
tion of Discovery magazine in his efforts to
disprove Hynek's theory.
An article in the magazine reports a
brouhaha over UFO sightings in New York
last year that attracted Hynek and several

other UFO researchers to the spot to see
whether the repeated sightings could be effec
tively documented.
Hynek is quoted in the article as saying of
the people who saw the V-shaped spaceships:
"Here we are in an urban area with highly ed
ucated people. IBM executives, pilots, naval
officers — you don't call this type of person a
liar. You'd be subject to a libel action if you
did."
Klass cited excerpts from the article to
prove that what Hynek thought were reliable
reports were nothing more than the products

of confused minds. According to the article,
amateur pilots in the area coordinated their
flight movements to make it appear as if
UFOs were menacing the populace. The
pilots even carried the joke so far as to hang
up a sign in their airport diner advertising
UFO Burgers (barbequed beef, melted
cheese and "a number of unidentified flying
ingredients").
Klass said, "Today, nearly 40 years after
the beginning of the UFO era, there is not a

single incontrovertible physical artifact to ex
plain the ET hypothesis. It is time for the
leaders of the UFO movement to take a new
tack." Hynek displayed no emotion while
Klass denounced his efforts and had no direct
response to any of Klass' claims.
The other panelists on the program took
the opportunity to rake theories about ancient
astronauts and astrology across the coals.
Roger Culver, a professor of physics at
Colorado University, decried theories that
ancient astronauts helped erect the Egyptian
pyramids. "The overtones of this are that
somewhere out there, you have a civilization
that has its act together. They have essentially
solved the problems we now face. They will
come down just in the nick of time and pull us
out of the jaws of catastrophe.
"That is an extraordinarily dangerous
view," Culver said. "If we continue to believe
that at the last minute, somebody's going to
pull our chestnuts out of the fire, we may be
very sadly and very terribly disappointed."
Andrew Fraknoi, the director of the
Astronomical Society of the Pacific and a
radio talk-show host on KGO-FM, took the
jocular approach in analyzing the astrology
question. "How many of you are from an al
ternate reality or a parallel dimension?" he
asked the audience, drawing laughter and
several raised hands.
Fraknoi cited the use of astrology as the
basis for selecting jurors in Cincinnati as an
example of the dangers of astrology as a
"science," saying, "The appeal of astrology is
understandable. In a complex, confusing
world, astrology posits a clear, simple connec
tion between our lives and the universe. As it
turns out, the real universe is not quite so
simple."
The question-and-answer period at the end
presented the opportunity for an astrologist to
stride to the microphone and denounce
Fraknoi's views. "Statistics are not holy," he
said. The astrologer called on the panelists
and on the audience to accept astrology as a
science.
Culver and Fraknoi were mildly outraged.
"Please, sir, do not call it a science. The
evidence simply is not there," Culver said.
Fraknoi sat back, crossed his legs and said, "I
would accept it if astrology were called an en
tertainment."
The astrologer went back to his seat in a
huff. The stars were not with him on that oc
casion, apparently.
