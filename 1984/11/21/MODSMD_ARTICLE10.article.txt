## Wanderings Come join the band ... for Big Game 
### MARILYN WANN 
Reader alert! I'm giving fair warning. It's time for yet
another Big Game story rehashing all those traditional
axioms, attacks and rude acts.
Some of you probably won't read any further. After all,
Cal students have once again earned the proud name of
Weenie and the turkey mortality rate is soaring like no
flightless bird ever could without a gutbusting holiday in
the wings.
So for the discerning reader who has stayed with me this
far into the third paragraph, I'm offering a cash reward.
(Ha! Got your hopes up, no?)
The prize isn't a trip for two to sunny South Dakota or
the Amana Radarange behind door number three but
something rare and precious, something akin to knowl
edge of the great mysteries of life — like the real
meanings behind those obscure Stanford acronyms, the
true color of Cyndi Lauper's hair and the number of
Cliffs Notes consumed by the average freshman each
quarter.
Listen my readers, and you shall hear the eyewitness ac
count of life in the Leland Stanford Junior University
Marching Band as told by a daring outsider who tempted
fate and returned after a week in the musical underworld
(i.e., the Band Shak) with a normally functioning liver.
All right, so it was me. Everything but the heroic parts
are still true, though. I joined the Band and am willing to
tell all. But before I recount the week's revelry, I need
to leave a note for my editors. You might want to look
away for this part; it could get embarrassing.
(Don't think I've had a mental melt-down just because
some of my spellings don't conform with ... a moment of
respectful silence . . . the AP Stylebook. When in the
Band, one does not leave messy letters like "s" dangling
at the ends of words when the superior life form, "z"
exists; and one uses a "c" only under duress. Examples
are: "I beat way big drumz!" and "We crashed at the
Shak.")
It's OK; you can look now.
My first experience with the Band was SMUT. (Yeah, it
shocked me, too.)
Actually, SMUT stands for Stanford Marching Unit
Thinkers, a name for the high-level planning meetings
that formulate each pre-game and half-time show.
I got to the Band Shak about 20 minutes before the
weekly hour of music rehearsal was scheduled to din out
like a flock of fog horns roosting in a sound-proofed bread
box.
My idea was to absorb some color, maybe get a few
details about the Band's environment.
My color receptors are still undergoing pastel treatment
to rejuvenate my overloaded fluorescent nodes.
The Shak's main room is a mural in musical mess. The
centerpiece is a psychedelic piano with silvery, reflecting
mylar siding and lavender-green stripes and dots. It rises
out of institutional-orange carpeting covered with old
sheet music, assymetrical mouth pieces and foot-wide,
tasteless ties.
Under the generous spattering of neon hair color spray,
a ream of suggestive freeway signs hang precariously plas
tered to almost any flat surface, proclaiming messages
like, "If you have sick pigs at home or brought sick or
dead pigs for diagnosis please do not enter this swine
barn."
Later, a musician told me that the main characteristic of
a Band member is his inability to pass a sign without won
dering how it would look in the Shak.
During my guided tour with Band public relations man

Ed Gresser, I began to distinguish between walls and floor
a little better.
The most interesting stop was Michelob Terrace, the
command center of the Band and storage space for a
canon, a sedan chair, a wheelchair and two pet rats.
When asked, "Why do you keep rats?" someone said,
"Doesn't everyone?" and another voice quipped,
"They're fun to feed beer to."
This inspired another serious musician to offer one little
furry critter a nibble of Drum Major Jim Kohn's mous
tache wax which he uses on his hair.
The nest, which is a loft/attic above all the other rooms,
is noted for the bottle target, which is visible from the
floor below and would be an ample source for glass recy
cling projects.
"Someone cleans out all the bottles every few years,"
said Gresser with a shrug and down the ladder I went.
Having completed my tourist duties I was promoted to
the post of mugwump, a Band term for the semi-cruci;il
Band members who play cymbal or cowbell.
Because I looked musical, or maybe just good at bang
ing things with a stick, Drum Section Leader Dennis
Ryan entrusted me with a two-toned cowbell.

I assumed that I could choose which note to use. Actu
ally, the odds of one of my two notes matching someone
else at any point in the music were pretty good, I figured.
After an hour of music rehearsal, Band Manager Scott
Gode announced staff members for next year, including
new Drum Major Andy Switky and introduced a new
verse to the classic Dirty Golden Bear song. The Band
"rehydrated" for the prescribed amount of time and
began to SMUT.
I was wondering why many Band members wore layers
of T-shirts until I witnessed SMUTs rituals.
People with an idea for a show are required to present it
on a blackboard in Michelob Terrace for the assembled
SMUT participants who, of course, can run up and tear off
the presenter's sacrificial shirt in worship of Big Face, a
crazed happy face painted on the Band room floor and the
subject of a running joke.
For some strange reason, I didn't seem to come up with
any funny plans that night.
SMUT was just the first in a week of activities that
proved the axiom, "Your life is Band. Band is your life."
Altogether, the group staggered through nine rallys, four
practices and Big Game itself, all without needing to call

the paramedics, All State or E.F. Hutton.
When the Band rallied at my dorm on Thursday night I
had regained partial hearing, and I think I was developing
callouses on my eardrums. My adjustment to the Band
way of life was irreversibly underway, and 1 was eager to
hop down on the Flo Mo roof and rock out.
I didn't have my cowbells with me so I became desig
nated Coors carrier for a drummer, tagging along when
my section decided to beat marching cadence down an
echoing Palmoa stairwell at full stadium volume.
After that, it seemed that one rally ran into another,
separated only by the raucous cheers on the Band buses.
I came to when we stepped onto the soft-as-Charmin
Astroturf, and I suddenly needed to remember my posi
tion in the pre-game show.
There were too many distractions to worry about that
triviality, though.
A panoramic view of dot-sized fans swarming up to a
baby-blue sky, the jingling of keys in a eulogy to the Cal
Band and my untied shoelace were all legitimate con
cerns.
But run on the field I did, swooping in crazy arcs with
my arms in World War 1 dogfight formation, and yes,
coming to a perfect one point landing on my portion of the
"F" in DEFENSE/DEFICIT.
My Jekyll-like transformation entered its final phase
during the game as I banged my cowbells on to new
volumes, screamed cheers I didn't even know and gloated
inwardly over all the mortals in the stands who would
never get within orange-throwing range of the 30-yard
line I trampled.
Speaking of oranges, there's some Weenie out there
who owes me one washing of my white overalls.
My first thought when I got hit was that the drummer
next to me was being sloppy with his stick, until I looked
down at my leg and saw the gory orange wound.
I freaked way big, to use Band jargon. For the next two
songs I was scanning the Cal crowd for funnelators or
whimpering courageous lines to myself. "No, I'll be all
right. You go on and take the Axe without me. It's just a
little citrus wound. So what if I can never mugwump
again?"
I made it through the game, although there were other
casualties. The drum section's "coffin," a drum case car
rying its supply of rehydrators, was commandeered by a
few thirsty stadium police.
The Band makes many such sacrifices. This year was
more draining than most according to Kohn because there
were nine shows to SMUT rather than the usual six or
seven.
Bass drummer Arne Lang-Ree felt the effects of this
extra load by wearing out two pairs of leather batting
practice gloves in a season pounding out the beat that is
politely called the metronome of the Band.
(It's a metronome that could wake up Palo Alto on a
clear day from the Shak.)
After the final playing of "All Right Now," the season
was over and the Band prepared for its culminating ca
thartic ritual ... the Grovel.
Band members Groveled — that is destroyed — all un
protected Band Shak debris including an old refrigerator,
a brick wall built specifically for the Grovel mayhem and a
window that looked too much like an innocent bystander.
Some Band members flee the Grovel annually; 1 liked
the two minutes of it that I watched before ducking a brick
and riding my dented bike home.
How could they leave the campus quiet and idyllic for a
year without this final act of irreverence?

An outsider to the Leland Stanford Junior University Marching Band definitely stands out among Band
members (notice I have the wrong hat on). But after a week of participating in Band activities, I learned
some of the Band's "secrets." I didn't learn everything, though, and sometimes I was a bit confused (notice
facial expression).
