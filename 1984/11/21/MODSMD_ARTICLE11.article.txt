## The 						Stanford Daily Ignored and forgotten 
### 
The American Indians taught the Pilgrims how
to plant and harvest corn, and the Pilgrims were
grateful to the Indians for their help, so they
invited them to a feast which was the first
Thanksgiving, or so the story goes.
We still celebrate Thanksgiving. The turkey,
the stuffing and the pumpkin pie haven't lost
their significance, but somehow the role of the
Indians tends to be forgotten. The people who
befriended our forefathers quickly became the
enemies of land developers and railroad barons.
Soon their land became more important to
Americans than their friendship.
And unfortunately, the trend has only contin
ued. Americans conquered this continent and the
people who inhabited it. Native Americans were
herded onto smaller and smaller parcels of land,
and when that land became valuable they were
moved again. Finally, the government began to
take responsibility for ts mistakes. It relegated
certain federal lands as trusts for Indian reserva
tions. But even today, the Indians are still wary.
And can we blame them?
According to Wade Blackmon, the program
assistant at Roble Hall, which is the Native
American priority house on campus, Indians
want to establish sovereignty on their reserva

tions, but the more they push for control the
more they fear they will lose what they already
have. "In the Southwest region, there are a lot of
minerals on Indian land and a lot of people who
want to get their hands on [them]," Blackmon
said.
The lack of understanding our nation has his
torically demonstrated toward Native Americans
is mirrored here at Stanford. There are currently
only 60 American Indians at Stanford. That num
ber includes both undergraduates and graduates.
And there is no American Indian studies pro
gram here.
Although Native Americans are included in
the University's affirmative-action policies,
Blackmon said that those recruited are the more
urbanized Indians rather than those more in
touch with their cultural heritage.
Perhaps the University needs to re-evaluate its
policy toward American Indians and put more
emphasis on the work students here are doing to
make the campus aware of their existence and
culture.
This Thanksgiving let us give thanks for the
America we know and love, but let us not forget
those who sacrificed perhaps even more than our
founding fathers â€” the American Indians.
