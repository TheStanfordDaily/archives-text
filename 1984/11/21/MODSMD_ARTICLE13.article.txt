## So there 
### 
I hear Nicaragua's very nice this time of year. Still, I'm not all that anxious to
find our for myself. But it's beginning to look as if I'm going to get the chance.
Lucky me, huh?
So what was in the crates that the Soviet Union shipped to Nicaragua? It
doesn't really matter, does it? I mean, we're still stepping up aggression. We
came this close (I'm holding my thumb and index finger very near'each other
now. but you can't see that) to launching a pre-emptive strike against a box of
oranges.
So we find some other reason to intensify our military efforts against
Nicaragua, and they get scared and order more mysterious crates from the So
viet Union, and we redouble our struggle against the Sandinistas once more.
Pretty intellectual, this war stuff.
I was complaining about all this to a friend. He wasn't very sympathetic.
"Bullshit," he said. "What do you know about Nicaragua?"
Not much, and I'm the first to admit it. But please don't tell me that I need a
bachelor's degree in international relations to worry about war. As far as I'm
concerned, I know all I need to:
I know that once upon a time Nicaragua was ruled by a man named Somoza.
I know that the United States liked that.
I know that many Nicaraguans didn't. So he was overthrown by the Sandi
nistas in 1979.
I know that the current Nicaraguan president. Daniel Ortega, likes the So
viet Union more than he likes the United States.
I know that this upsets the United States.
I know that the United States would rather kill the Sandinistas than make
friends with them.
I know that this scares me.
I know that last year the United States invaded Grenada. I know that a lot of
Americans got off on this. It was basically the biggest circle-jerk in American
history.
I know that this scares me. too.
I know that many people are tired of military masturbation and think we
could kick Nicaragua's ass. After all, we won the Olympics.
I know that the Soviet Union would not take kindly to our kicking
Nicaragua's ass.
I know that this scares me possibly more than any of the above.
I know that if we do invade Nicaragua, my friends and I will be doing the in
vading, not the politicians and generals who decide to attack.
I know that that's ass-backwards.
I know that I don't want to get shot, and I don't want to have to shoot people
to keep from getting shot.
1 know that most of the people who'll be doing the invading don't know any
thing more about Nicaragua and politics than I do. Poli-sci majors die just as
quickly as high-school dropouts.
I know that the whole situation sucks.
1 know that I don't need to know anything more.
So there.
