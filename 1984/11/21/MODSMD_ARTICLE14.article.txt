Big Game bashing
The following is an open letter
delivered to University President
Donald Kennedy:
Dear Mr. Kennedy:
We, the undersigned resident
assistant staff of Branner Hall, are
writing to vehemently protest the
unnecessary use of force by members
of the Stanford security police
against Stanford students who en
tered the playing field at the conclu
sion of Saturday's Big Game at
Berkeley.
From our position, midway up the
Stanford student section, we wit
nessed Stanford security forces using
nightsticks against students, wrestling
them to the ground and physically
assaulting them. While we recognize
that students were not supposed to
enter the field after the game, those
who did suffered in a manner incom
mensurate with their "crime." The
indiscriminate actions by the security
forces were reminiscent of Mayor
Daley's Chicago police during the
Democratic Convention of 1968 —
these actions practically invite legal
action against the University.
Before leaving the Berkeley
stadium we asked three of the Stan
ford guards responsible for the vio
lence for their names; they refused
to give us this information and told
us to leave. We noted their badge
numbers: 117, 123 and FC2.
We feel that this situation is of
sufficient gravity that you begin an
inquiry at once. It is in the Univer
sity's best interest that this type of
behavior, by those employed to
"protect" Stanford students, must
not be allowed to repeat itself. We
look forward to hearing from your
office in the near future regarding
this matter.

A strong stand
On Thursday the Israeli and
Lebanese military authorities met to

try to work out an agreement for the
withdrawal of Israeli forces from
southern Lebanon. There is hope on
all sides that a viable solution can be
worked out soon. However, this
optimism is dimmed by the very real
threats of the Islamic Jihad Organi
zation and other radical Shiite
groups in southern Lebanon. On the
eve of negotiations, they issued a
general warning that any party in
volved in the talks "would be put on
a black list."
Some would urge the United
States to stay clear of the talks in
order not to provoke these terrorists.
Unfortunately, the United States is
already on their "black list." In the
same statement, this organization,
which claims responsibility for both
bombings of the U.S. Embassy in
Beirut, issued the following threat to
the United States: "We warn on the
re-election of Ronald Reagan to the
U.S. Presidency, that we shall blow
up all American interests in Beirut
and any part of Lebanon. We ad
dress this warning to every American
individual residing in Lebanon."
The situation in Lebanon is more
complicated than ever today because
of the hostility of the local Shiite
population toward the Israeli forces
occupying southern Lebanon. Be
cause of close ties with Israel, the
United States has also become the
target of terrorist attacks. As long as
Israeli forces are in Lebanon, these
attacks are likely to continue.
The United States cannot bury its
head and hide from this problem.
The Reagan administration's policy
has been uncoordinated and capri
cious from the start. At first, it al
ternately tried to cater to the inter
ests of Israel and the moderate Arab
states. This resulted in a debacle for
the Reagan administration from
which it had to make a humiliating
retreat. This retreat served to en
courage international terrorists
everywhere.
In his election campaign against
former President Carter, Reagan
vowed to take on the forces of inter
national terrorism. He re-issued this
promise many times in his re
election campaign against Walter

Mondale. It is very likely that soon
the United States will he asked to
participate in the negotiating
process. It is in the interests of
everyone that the United States
accept this offer. Israel wants
desperately to send its soldiers home
so that it can turn its attention to its
domestic problems. Syria would like
to remove Israeli troops from the
Bekaa Valley, which is dangerously
close to Damascus. The Lebanese
would like to see all the foreign
forces off their soil so that they can
get on with their lives. Finally, it is in
American interests to stabilize the
region, restore its prestige in the
Middle East and take a strong stand
against international terrorism.
Here's your chance, President
Reagan, to follow through with your
campaign promise.

Police out of line
A police department is an au
thoritarian institution empowered by
law to employ force where necessary
to protect us from crime. On Satur
day, Nov. 17, the Stanford police
decided that the students who went
on the field to celebrate the Big
Game victory and dance with the
band were committing a crime. They
deemed it "necessary" to use force
to protect the people from those
criminals.
During halftime I asked a ser
geant of the Stanford police why
they were at the stadium. He said,
"It is a mutual agreement between
the two schools and to ease the
tensions on the Berkeley police."
When the game ended and the stu
dents went on the field, a Stanford
police officer said to his comrade,
"looks like we're going to have to
waste a few." From this point on I
observed and made mental notes'. Is
"wasting a few" easing the tensions?
This kind of violent attitude is ex
tremely out of bounds. Do the police
believe their aggression is justified
because they are within the bound
aries of written law?
Authority figures emanate an aura

of Tightness; their actions cannot
easily be challenged. What else can
the victim be but wrong? I have no
power to single out any individual
officer. The names and faces of each
officer, and the human-rights viola
tions they committed, are forever
etched in my and many other
people's minds. We will not forget.
Some people might say officers of
the law are no different from anyone
else and occasional acts of violence
are an all-too-human failing. This
attitude is wrong and must change.
What happened was a one-sided
abuse of power, committed by those
whose job it is to control such
abuses. It was one-sided in that
police are not only trained to fight
but are also armed. They have been
raised as males — generally aggressive
— and they have been trained to
combat human beings. They know
right where to poke that night stick
(kidneys). How many kidney shots
did I witness Saturday? How many
did I miss seeing?
Those who bear the awes time
responsibility for maintaining law
and order must face up to evidence
that shows what they did Saturday
was a crime. The local police must
exercise control and learn humility.
They must look at themselves as well
as the students. Do the officers go
home and look at their families and
wonder if they might have injured
the child of another family? Picture
this: "Honest, Dad, I was just dan
cing with the band when this man hit
me." Who is now in the right?
A new approach to University
laws and to law enforcement can
take us only part of the way. Violent
male attitudes must change. I would
argue that turning over to women 50
percent of the power to enforce the
law and maintain the order would be
a major step toward eliminating the
problem.
Big Game is a tradition, as is
celebrating its victory. Heavily
armed and violent police officers at
college football games is not tradi
tion and not necessary. It's just plain
wrong.

On Thursday the Israeli and
Lebanese military authorities met to

try to work out an agreement for the
withdrawal of Israeli forces from
southern Lebanon. There is hope on
all sides that a viable solution can be
worked out soon. However, this
optimism is dimmed by the very real
threats of the Islamic Jihad Organi
zation and other radical Shiite
groups in southern Lebanon. On the
eve of negotiations, they issued a
general warning that any party in
volved in the talks "would be put on
a black list."
Some would urge the United
States to stay clear of the talks in
order not to provoke these terrorists.
Unfortunately, the United States is
already on their "black list." In the
same statement, this organization,
which claims responsibility for both
bombings of the U.S. Embassy in
Beirut, issued the following threat to
the United States: "We warn on the
re-election of Ronald Reagan to the
U.S. Presidency, that we shall blow
up all American interests in Beirut
and any part of Lebanon. We ad
dress this warning to every American
individual residing in Lebanon."
The situation in Lebanon is more
complicated than ever today because
of the hostility of the local Shiite
population toward the Israeli forces
occupying southern Lebanon. Be
cause of close ties with Israel, the
United States has also become the
target of terrorist attacks. As long as
Israeli forces are in Lebanon, these
attacks are likely to continue.
The United States cannot bury its
head and hide from this problem.
The Reagan administration's policy
has been uncoordinated and capri
cious from the start. At first, it al
ternately tried to cater to the inter
ests of Israel and the moderate Arab
states. This resulted in a debacle for
the Reagan administration from
which it had to make a humiliating
retreat. This retreat served to en
courage international terrorists
everywhere.
In his election campaign against
former President Carter, Reagan
vowed to take on the forces of inter
national terrorism. He re-issued this
promise many times in his re
election campaign against Walter

Mondale. It is very likely that soon
the United States will he asked to
participate in the negotiating
process. It is in the interests of
everyone that the United States
accept this offer. Israel wants
desperately to send its soldiers home
so that it can turn its attention to its
domestic problems. Syria would like
to remove Israeli troops from the
Bekaa Valley, which is dangerously
close to Damascus. The Lebanese
would like to see all the foreign
forces off their soil so that they can
get on with their lives. Finally, it is in
American interests to stabilize the
region, restore its prestige in the
Middle East and take a strong stand
against international terrorism.
Here's your chance, President
Reagan, to follow through with your
campaign promise.

A police department is an au
thoritarian institution empowered by
law to employ force where necessary
to protect us from crime. On Satur
day, Nov. 17, the Stanford police
decided that the students who went
on the field to celebrate the Big
Game victory and dance with the
band were committing a crime. They
deemed it "necessary" to use force
to protect the people from those
criminals.
During halftime I asked a ser
geant of the Stanford police why
they were at the stadium. He said,
"It is a mutual agreement between
the two schools and to ease the
tensions on the Berkeley police."
When the game ended and the stu
dents went on the field, a Stanford
police officer said to his comrade,
"looks like we're going to have to
waste a few." From this point on I
observed and made mental notes'. Is
"wasting a few" easing the tensions?
This kind of violent attitude is ex
tremely out of bounds. Do the police
believe their aggression is justified
because they are within the bound
aries of written law?
Authority figures emanate an aura

of Tightness; their actions cannot
easily be challenged. What else can
the victim be but wrong? I have no
power to single out any individual
officer. The names and faces of each
officer, and the human-rights viola
tions they committed, are forever
etched in my and many other
people's minds. We will not forget.
Some people might say officers of
the law are no different from anyone
else and occasional acts of violence
are an all-too-human failing. This
attitude is wrong and must change.
What happened was a one-sided
abuse of power, committed by those
whose job it is to control such
abuses. It was one-sided in that
police are not only trained to fight
but are also armed. They have been
raised as males — generally aggressive
— and they have been trained to
combat human beings. They know
right where to poke that night stick
(kidneys). How many kidney shots
did I witness Saturday? How many
did I miss seeing?
Those who bear the awes time
responsibility for maintaining law
and order must face up to evidence
that shows what they did Saturday
was a crime. The local police must
exercise control and learn humility.
They must look at themselves as well
as the students. Do the officers go
home and look at their families and
wonder if they might have injured
the child of another family? Picture
this: "Honest, Dad, I was just dan
cing with the band when this man hit
me." Who is now in the right?
A new approach to University
laws and to law enforcement can
take us only part of the way. Violent
male attitudes must change. I would
argue that turning over to women 50
percent of the power to enforce the
law and maintain the order would be
a major step toward eliminating the
problem.
Big Game is a tradition, as is
celebrating its victory. Heavily
armed and violent police officers at
college football games is not tradi
tion and not necessary. It's just plain
wrong.

The following is an open letter
delivered to University President
Donald Kennedy:
Dear Mr. Kennedy:
We, the undersigned resident
assistant staff of Branner Hall, are
writing to vehemently protest the
unnecessary use of force by members
of the Stanford security police
against Stanford students who en
tered the playing field at the conclu
sion of Saturday's Big Game at
Berkeley.
From our position, midway up the
Stanford student section, we wit
nessed Stanford security forces using
nightsticks against students, wrestling
them to the ground and physically
assaulting them. While we recognize
that students were not supposed to
enter the field after the game, those
who did suffered in a manner incom
mensurate with their "crime." The
indiscriminate actions by the security
forces were reminiscent of Mayor
Daley's Chicago police during the
Democratic Convention of 1968 —
these actions practically invite legal
action against the University.
Before leaving the Berkeley
stadium we asked three of the Stan
ford guards responsible for the vio
lence for their names; they refused
to give us this information and told
us to leave. We noted their badge
numbers: 117, 123 and FC2.
We feel that this situation is of
sufficient gravity that you begin an
inquiry at once. It is in the Univer
sity's best interest that this type of
behavior, by those employed to
"protect" Stanford students, must
not be allowed to repeat itself. We
look forward to hearing from your
office in the near future regarding
this matter.
