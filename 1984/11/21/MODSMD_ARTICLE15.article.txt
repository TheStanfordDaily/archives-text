## U.S. fallible but not always wrong 
### 
Last December, the International Civil Aviation
Organization (ICAO) issued a report on the KAL
007 incident that concluded, in part, that the air
liner had not been on an intelligence-gathering
mission and that the crew was unaware that it had
strayed into Soviet territory. Human error was
found to be the most likely cause of the tragedy.
This report has done little to stop the prolifera
tion of conspiracy theories on both sides; theories

VIEWPOINT

which choose to ignore, manipulate or invent facts.
One perfect example is The Nation article by David
Pearson, referenced by Dixon Osburn in his
column "The myth of infallibility" (The Daily
Nov. 13).
Pearson states as a fact the totally false assump
tion that "the U.S. government knew or should
have known almost from the moment the Korean
airliner departed Anchorage. Alaska, that the
plane was off course and headed toward sensitive
Soviet military installations." Even though the
ICAO, the FAA. Japanese Civil Aviation Authori
ties and just about anyone else you ask will tell you
that extended over-water international flights are
not routinely flight-followed and. indeed, the capa
bility to perform such a task is virtually non-exis
tent. Pearson nonetheless establishes this fact and
then proves his case against it.
The simple reason that no one warned KAL 007
that it had strayed into Soviet airspace was that, at
the time, no one knew ... no one except the
Soviets, that is. Japanese controllers believed the
airliner to be on its preplanned flight route, given
the position reports provided by the aircraft itself.
This is why the initial search and rescue (SAR) ef
forts took place east of Hokkaido. It wasn't until
several hours later that intelligence reports of uni

dentified Soviet air activity over Kamchatka and
Sakhalin were tied to the missing airliner. It took
several days of careful analysis to reconstruct what
actually occurred. The Soviets were the only ones
who were aware of the intrusion while it was occur
ring.
Did the Soviets warn KAL 007 that it was off
course? Voice transcripts reveal that the Korean
pilot was totally unaware of his true location or of
the presence of Soviet interceptors. Nor was he
aware of the reason behind the "rapid decompres
sion" that caused the fatal crash. All sides now ac
knowledge that the "reason" was a Soviet air-to-air
missile, fired by an SU-7 interceptor. However, the
Soviets refused to admit this until voice transcripts
were released quoting the Soviet pilot as stating, "I
have executed the launch" and"the target is
destroyed.",.
The ICAO inquiry concluded that the Soviets
"did not make exhaustive efforts to identify the
aircraft through in-flight visual means" probably
because they "assumed" the Korean airliner was a
spy plane. The Soviets were more intent on
downing the intruder than on identifying what they
were destroying. I believe a good case can be made
that the Soviets should have been aware that KAL
007 was not a RC-135. But even giving them this
very large benefit of the doubt, their apparent lack
of genuine effort to identify or warn the flight
remains inexcusable.
I agree with Dixon Osburn that many questions
remain to be answered. Some of the answers were
no doubt contained in KAL 007's "black box."
Recovery of the wreckage could have resulted in
the examination of the plane's navigational com
puter. It could also have confirmed or refuted the
presence of "spy equipment." The United States
conducted many weeks of extensive underwater
search operations along hundreds of square miles

of ocean just outside the Soviet's 12-mile territorial
limits off Sakhalin Island. The Japanese conducted
search and rescue operations as well.
Both nations permitted international observers
and members of the world press on board. ICAO
representatives were on the scene to take immedi
ate possession of any recovered objects. The
Soviets were invited to send representatives as well.
They refused. They also refused repeated Japanese
and American requests to extend the search into
Soviet waters. Instead, they constantly harrassed
and interfered with the searchers' efforts.
In my view, the most important unanswered
question is "where is the KAL 007 wreckage?" I
can't prove it, but I would be willing to bet it is
somewhere inside Soviet territory at a location
known to the Soviet Union. Why did the Soviets
impede rather than assist in the effort to find the
wreckage? The only logical answer I can reach is
that they have a great deal to lose and nothing to
gain by its recovery. The black box, the on-board
navigational equipment and the absence of spy gear
would help put an end to the unfounded rumors
that are deflecting attention away from the real,
and only, guilty party in this affair, the Soviet
Union.
Osburn states that the KAL incident "throws
doubt on our belief in an infallible government."
Unfortunately, our history is all too full of exam
ples of American fallibility. But this does not mean
that everything our government does is wrong or
that everything it says is untrue. The KAL incident,
in my view, provides an example that the United
States, whatever its faults, is sometimes capable of
telling the truth and that the Soviet Union,
whatever its virtues, sometimes tells lies.

that extended over-water international flights are
not routinely flight-followed and. indeed, the capa
bility to perform such a task is virtually non-exis
tent. Pearson nonetheless establishes this fact and
then proves his case against it.
The simple reason that no one warned KAL 007
that it had strayed into Soviet airspace was that, at
the time, no one knew ... no one except the
Soviets, that is. Japanese controllers believed the
airliner to be on its preplanned flight route, given
the position reports provided by the aircraft itself.
This is why the initial search and rescue (SAR) ef
forts took place east of Hokkaido. It wasn't until
several hours later that intelligence reports of uni

dentified Soviet air activity over Kamchatka and
Sakhalin were tied to the missing airliner. It took
several days of careful analysis to reconstruct what
actually occurred. The Soviets were the only ones
who were aware of the intrusion while it was occur
ring.
Did the Soviets warn KAL 007 that it was off
course? Voice transcripts reveal that the Korean
pilot was totally unaware of his true location or of
the presence of Soviet interceptors. Nor was he
aware of the reason behind the "rapid decompres
sion" that caused the fatal crash. All sides now ac
knowledge that the "reason" was a Soviet air-to-air
missile, fired by an SU-7 interceptor. However, the
Soviets refused to admit this until voice transcripts
were released quoting the Soviet pilot as stating, "I
have executed the launch" and"the target is
destroyed.",.
The ICAO inquiry concluded that the Soviets
"did not make exhaustive efforts to identify the
aircraft through in-flight visual means" probably
because they "assumed" the Korean airliner was a
spy plane. The Soviets were more intent on
downing the intruder than on identifying what they
were destroying. I believe a good case can be made
that the Soviets should have been aware that KAL
007 was not a RC-135. But even giving them this
very large benefit of the doubt, their apparent lack
of genuine effort to identify or warn the flight
remains inexcusable.
I agree with Dixon Osburn that many questions
remain to be answered. Some of the answers were
no doubt contained in KAL 007's "black box."
Recovery of the wreckage could have resulted in
the examination of the plane's navigational com
puter. It could also have confirmed or refuted the
presence of "spy equipment." The United States
conducted many weeks of extensive underwater
search operations along hundreds of square miles

of ocean just outside the Soviet's 12-mile territorial
limits off Sakhalin Island. The Japanese conducted
search and rescue operations as well.
Both nations permitted international observers
and members of the world press on board. ICAO
representatives were on the scene to take immedi
ate possession of any recovered objects. The
Soviets were invited to send representatives as well.
They refused. They also refused repeated Japanese
and American requests to extend the search into
Soviet waters. Instead, they constantly harrassed
and interfered with the searchers' efforts.
In my view, the most important unanswered
question is "where is the KAL 007 wreckage?" I
can't prove it, but I would be willing to bet it is
somewhere inside Soviet territory at a location
known to the Soviet Union. Why did the Soviets
impede rather than assist in the effort to find the
wreckage? The only logical answer I can reach is
that they have a great deal to lose and nothing to
gain by its recovery. The black box, the on-board
navigational equipment and the absence of spy gear
would help put an end to the unfounded rumors
that are deflecting attention away from the real,
and only, guilty party in this affair, the Soviet
Union.
Osburn states that the KAL incident "throws
doubt on our belief in an infallible government."
Unfortunately, our history is all too full of exam
ples of American fallibility. But this does not mean
that everything our government does is wrong or
that everything it says is untrue. The KAL incident,
in my view, provides an example that the United
States, whatever its faults, is sometimes capable of
telling the truth and that the Soviet Union,
whatever its virtues, sometimes tells lies.

Last December, the International Civil Aviation
Organization (ICAO) issued a report on the KAL
007 incident that concluded, in part, that the air
liner had not been on an intelligence-gathering
mission and that the crew was unaware that it had
strayed into Soviet territory. Human error was
found to be the most likely cause of the tragedy.
This report has done little to stop the prolifera
tion of conspiracy theories on both sides; theories

which choose to ignore, manipulate or invent facts.
One perfect example is The Nation article by David
Pearson, referenced by Dixon Osburn in his
column "The myth of infallibility" (The Daily
Nov. 13).
Pearson states as a fact the totally false assump
tion that "the U.S. government knew or should
have known almost from the moment the Korean
airliner departed Anchorage. Alaska, that the
plane was off course and headed toward sensitive
Soviet military installations." Even though the
