# Profs push for writing classes

### BRYAN WALSER Staff writer 
A faculty task force is currently
working with faculty members to
develop courses designed to sharpen
the writing skills of Stanford students.
The Writing Across the Curriculum
task force has recommended that
every department offer one or more
"writing-intensive" courses. Students
would be required to take these
courses after their freshman year.
In the 1982-83 Senior Survey, 84
percent of those polled thought their
ability to write clear English prose
was good or excellent. Even so, some
faculty members say they see a clear
need for improvement.
A course is defined as "writing
intensive" if the instructor agrees to
make writing assignments emphasiz
ing clear and coherent prose an inte
gral part of the class, according to
Communication Prof. Marion
Lewenstein, a member of the writing
task force. A common way to ac
complish this goal is to assign several
draft versions of an assignment
before asking for a final, graded ver
sion.
The draft versions are corrected
either by a teaching assistant or by
peer review.
"The point is to force students to
write a paper more than two hours
before they hand it in," Lewenstein
said. "No professional writes any
thing just once.. .. We want to dem

onstrate to students that clear and
coherent writing is a result of clear
and coherent thinking."
The writing task force has
depended on voluntary faculty sup
port to assist its efforts in expanding
writing-intensive courses across the
curriculum.
"Other colleges (including Brown
and Yale) which have programs like
this have told us that we have had an
unusually large beginning,"
Lewenstein said.
The task force provides materials
for interested faculty members and
gives initial training to teaching assis
tants involved in grading students'
papers.
Student reaction to the program
has been mainly favorable, according
to Lewenstein, with the exception of
students in Asst. Physics Prof. Chris
tian Stoller's lab seminar on
electronics. These students felt that
the extra writing requirements were
burdensome and took an unfair
amount of time.
But students in other courses feel
the extra writing helps them to pres
ent their ideas more clearly. "I think
it is important to be able to express
scientific ideas clearly, and the Hum
Bio writing requirements have helped
me to organize my ideas in a clear and
concise fashion," said Sig Berven, a
sophomore in the Human Biology
core curriculum, a writing-intensive
course.
A total of 21 writing-intensive
courses are being offered through the
School of Humanities and Sciences
this year, ranging from physics to
music.
Courses offered include "Linguistic
Theory and Analysis," taught by
Asst. Linguistics Profs. William Poser

and Ivan Sag; "France of Louis
XIV," taught by Assoc. History Prof.
Carolyn Lougee, who is associate
dean of the School of Humanities and
Sciences; "Biology of Insects," taught
by Assoc. Biological Sciences Prof.
Ward Watt; "Medieval and Renais
sance Music," taught by Assoc. Music
Prof. William Mahrt; and "Mass
Communication and Society," taught
by Communication Prof. Everett
Rogers.
