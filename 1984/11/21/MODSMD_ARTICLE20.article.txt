Unique student body at Northwestern
When it comes to decorating their dorm rooms, students at Northwestern
University go all out . . . and take it all off.
Though beer posters and street signs may be all right for some, Northwest
ern junior Anne Baughman preferred to paint her room with her bare body.

"I saw a film about a French artist who did an entire exhibition using nude
models that he covered with paint and then placed on this large piece of canvas
on the floor," Baughman explained.
So, she decided to brave the autumn chill for art's sake and created a master
piece on the naked walls of her room. Later, she even volunteered to help a

friend, Tim O'Donnell, paint his room.
O'Donnell, a Northwestern senior, explained that the operation was fairly
simple. "We took all the furniture out of the room," he said. "Anne painted
herself with latex paint and then splattered herself against the walls. When that
dried, we took paint brushes and splattered around the body prints."
The community's reaction to the artwork was not detailed by The Daily
Northwestern. But it nothing else, the painting provided a whole new insight
into the Northwestern "student bod\
Big Brother may be watching you
It's 1984. It has been for more than ten months. And as the year draws to a
close, we look cautiously over our shoulders and wonder if we'll avoid Big
Brother for the few weeks that remain.
Big Brother hasn't struck â€” at least not yet. But students at the University
of Michigan might be inclined to think otherwise.
A recent article in 1 he Michigan Daily reported on a proposed student code
that would monitor and regulate students' behavior outside the classroom.
Though the "non-academic conduct" code is still in the planning stages, a
special meeting was held on the Michigan campus for students to ask code
oriented questions of University President Harold Shapiro, Prof. Martin Gold
and chairman of the Michigan Student Assembly Eric Schnaufer.
Specific code guidelines were not reported. With any luck, they will not be
discussed until after the new year.
Pick a patch of cabbage at Cal
What's the only item that sells faster than "Axe the Trees" T-shirts during
November on the campus of the University of California at Berkeley?

Cabbage Patch dolls, of course.
The Consumers' Distributing Store on Berkeley's University Avenue
recently celebrated its grand opening by selling Cabbage Patch dolls for the
low price of $24.83 each. The Daily Californian reported. Within only three
hours after opening, 300 Cabbage Patch dolls were sold to parents, children
and grandparents who waited in line for hours.
The great influx of people was due primarily to the low price of the dolls.
Cabbage Patch dolls are advertised for as much as $100, though they regularly

retail for around $40, The Daily Californian explained.
With a turnout like this, and a game like last Saturday's, it is possible that
Cabbage Patch-mania might just replace Big Game hysteria at Berkeley . . .
but lettuce not suppose too much. . . .
