## Water polo team plays Navy Saturday Cardinal looks to dethrone Cal at NCAAs 
### INGRID SEYER Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford water polo team will
enter the National Collegiate Athletic
Association championships at Long
Beach's Belmont Pool Plaza this
weekend as the top seed, looking for
its fifth national title.
The other seeds for the tournament,
following Stanford, are: No. 2, Uni
versity of California at Berkeley; No.
3, University of Southern California;
No. 4, Pepperdine University; No. 5,
UCLA; No. 6, Brown University;
No. 7, University of Loyola-Chicago;
No. 8, U.S. Naval Academy.
Stanford Coach Dante Dettamanti
said there's more than prestige ac
companying the No. 1 seed.
"We have an advantage being the
No. 1 seed in that we play the
weakest team in the tournament (the
No. 8 seed) first," Dettamanti said.
"If we win, we play the winner of the
N0.4- and No. 5-seed game later that
night. The team that wins may be a
bit tired after a game like that, and we
could also have a slight advantage for
that reason."
Although Stanford lost its last
regular-season game to Cal last
weekend in overtime, 13-12, Detta
manti said that loss will not affect the
Cardinal.
Stanford has won three NCAA
titles (1978, 1980, 1981) in the past
seven years under Dettamanti. In
1978 and 1980, the Cardinal entered
the NCAAs in the same situation —
the Pacific 10 Conference titlist, the
No. 1 seed and a loser to Cal the
week before the tournament. In both
cases, Stanford defeated Cal in the
championship final to win the NCAA
title.
Stanford will play Navy in the first
round Saturday at 9 a.m. Although

this game is expected to be a close
one, Dettamanti hopes the Cardinal
will be playing well enough that he
can rest some starters for the night
game.
If Stanford wins its first game, it
will play the winner of the
Pepperdine-UCLA match at 7 p.m.
Saturday. According to Dettamanti,
the second tournament game will be
the crucial one for the Cardinal.
"The second game is the single
most important game of the tourna
ment," Dettamanti said. "You don't

even think about the finals until you
win this game. It will be a really close
one, because there is very little dif
ference between the first and fifth
teams in an NCAA tournament."
Dettamanti said the Cardinal's
chances of winning the tournament
are very good, but he is not over
confident.
"All of the teams competing are
capable of winning the champion
ship," Dettamanti said. "We haven't
dominated anybody this season (five
of Stanford's six Pac-10 games were

one-goal victories), but we have as
good a chance as anybody to win it."
Dettamanti said the Cardinal is
playing better now than it has all
season, and he is pleased with its
championship prospects.
"We are playing really well be
cause of a lot of things," Dettamanti
said. "The players are realizing their
individual roles, our defense is
growing stronger with the return of
Greg Gamble (who was out for much
of the season with a broken foot), our
bench is playing well, (goalie Steve)

Moyer is playing super in the cage, we
are working out a more balanced
scoring attack and we are getting to
know the other teams."
Of the eight teams in the tourna
ment, the top five are from California
and four of those are from the
Pac-10.
Cal finished its regular season with
a 20-4-1 overall record and is the
defending NCAA champion. Accord
ing to Dettamanti, the Bears are the
most physical team in the tourna
ment, possess a lot of size, speed and

experience, and are well-rounded of
fensively and defensively.
Berkeley relies heavily on its fast
breaks and front-court offense, which
is led by two fast players — Olympic
swimming gold medalist Matt Biondi
and Alan Gresham.
USC, 22-6-1, was the NCAA
runner-up last season and, according
to Dettamanti, could be a top con
tender for the championship. The
Trojans returned their entire lineup
from last season and are experienced
in NCAA play. USC's top players in
clude driver Mike Spicer and
holeman Charlie Harris.
Pepperdine, 32-5-3, was ranked
No. 1 for several weeks earlier this
season. Although the Waves are ex
perienced, Dettamanti said they focus
excessively on holeman Grier and
they rely heavily on outside shooting.
"Pepperdine is rather limited and
cannot beat you in a lot of ways, but it
can beat you," Dettamanti said.
UCLA, 13-12-1, is a "muscle
team," according to Dettamanti. A
lot of the Bruins offensive strength
revolves around the play of holeman
Scott Thorton.
"UCLA is capable of beating the
best teams and losing to the worst,"
Dettamanti said. "The Bruins are
very inconsistent and unpredictable."
Brown is considered by many as
the strongest team outside of Califor
nia in the NCAA tournament.
Brown, 31-15-1, defeated Navy (23-
2) two times this season, 13-10 and
15-12 in overtime.
Loyola, 16-12-1, is the strongest
team in the Midwest and is led by
senior driver Dan O'Connell. Loyola
played in the NorCal Tournament at
Stanford earlier this season and lost
its four games.

one, Dettamanti hopes the Cardinal
will be playing well enough that he
can rest some starters for the night
game.
If Stanford wins its first game, it
will play the winner of the
Pepperdine-UCLA match at 7 p.m.
Saturday. According to Dettamanti,
the second tournament game will be
the crucial one for the Cardinal.
"The second game is the single
most important game of the tourna
ment," Dettamanti said. "You don't

even think about the finals until you
win this game. It will be a really close
one, because there is very little dif
ference between the first and fifth
teams in an NCAA tournament."
Dettamanti said the Cardinal's
chances of winning the tournament
are very good, but he is not over
confident.
"All of the teams competing are
capable of winning the champion
ship," Dettamanti said. "We haven't
dominated anybody this season (five
of Stanford's six Pac-10 games were

one-goal victories), but we have as
good a chance as anybody to win it."
Dettamanti said the Cardinal is
playing better now than it has all
season, and he is pleased with its
championship prospects.
"We are playing really well be
cause of a lot of things," Dettamanti
said. "The players are realizing their
individual roles, our defense is
growing stronger with the return of
Greg Gamble (who was out for much
of the season with a broken foot), our
bench is playing well, (goalie Steve)

Moyer is playing super in the cage, we
are working out a more balanced
scoring attack and we are getting to
know the other teams."
Of the eight teams in the tourna
ment, the top five are from California
and four of those are from the
Pac-10.
Cal finished its regular season with
a 20-4-1 overall record and is the
defending NCAA champion. Accord
ing to Dettamanti, the Bears are the
most physical team in the tourna
ment, possess a lot of size, speed and

experience, and are well-rounded of
fensively and defensively.
Berkeley relies heavily on its fast
breaks and front-court offense, which
is led by two fast players — Olympic
swimming gold medalist Matt Biondi
and Alan Gresham.
USC, 22-6-1, was the NCAA
runner-up last season and, according
to Dettamanti, could be a top con
tender for the championship. The
Trojans returned their entire lineup
from last season and are experienced
in NCAA play. USC's top players in
clude driver Mike Spicer and
holeman Charlie Harris.
Pepperdine, 32-5-3, was ranked
No. 1 for several weeks earlier this
season. Although the Waves are ex
perienced, Dettamanti said they focus
excessively on holeman Grier and
they rely heavily on outside shooting.
"Pepperdine is rather limited and
cannot beat you in a lot of ways, but it
can beat you," Dettamanti said.
UCLA, 13-12-1, is a "muscle
team," according to Dettamanti. A
lot of the Bruins offensive strength
revolves around the play of holeman
Scott Thorton.
"UCLA is capable of beating the
best teams and losing to the worst,"
Dettamanti said. "The Bruins are
very inconsistent and unpredictable."
Brown is considered by many as
the strongest team outside of Califor
nia in the NCAA tournament.
Brown, 31-15-1, defeated Navy (23-
2) two times this season, 13-10 and
15-12 in overtime.
Loyola, 16-12-1, is the strongest
team in the Midwest and is led by
senior driver Dan O'Connell. Loyola
played in the NorCal Tournament at
Stanford earlier this season and lost
its four games.

in it last season. The top-ranked Cardinal's first game is against eighth
seeded Navy Saturday morning.
The Stanford water polo team will
enter the National Collegiate Athletic
Association championships at Long
Beach's Belmont Pool Plaza this
weekend as the top seed, looking for
its fifth national title.
The other seeds for the tournament,
following Stanford, are: No. 2, Uni
versity of California at Berkeley; No.
3, University of Southern California;
No. 4, Pepperdine University; No. 5,
UCLA; No. 6, Brown University;
No. 7, University of Loyola-Chicago;
No. 8, U.S. Naval Academy.
Stanford Coach Dante Dettamanti
said there's more than prestige ac
companying the No. 1 seed.
"We have an advantage being the
No. 1 seed in that we play the
weakest team in the tournament (the
No. 8 seed) first," Dettamanti said.
"If we win, we play the winner of the
N0.4- and No. 5-seed game later that
night. The team that wins may be a
bit tired after a game like that, and we
could also have a slight advantage for
that reason."
Although Stanford lost its last
regular-season game to Cal last
weekend in overtime, 13-12, Detta
manti said that loss will not affect the
Cardinal.
Stanford has won three NCAA
titles (1978, 1980, 1981) in the past
seven years under Dettamanti. In
1978 and 1980, the Cardinal entered
the NCAAs in the same situation —
the Pacific 10 Conference titlist, the
No. 1 seed and a loser to Cal the
week before the tournament. In both
cases, Stanford defeated Cal in the
championship final to win the NCAA
title.
