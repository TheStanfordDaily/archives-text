# Men's basketball team limping into season opener
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
Stanford Basketball Coach Tom Davis would like to
name a starting lineup for the Cardinal's season opener
Saturday in Maples Pavilion against the University oi Cal
ifornia at San Diego. But first he's got to find five healthy
bodies.
Only two of the five starting spots are decided — Keith
Ramee will start at point guard and Andy Fischer at small
forward. Who will get the call at the other three positions
depends more on the medical report than who plays well
in practice.
Novian Whitsitt is penciled in at off guard, but he pulled
a muscle in the back of his knee last week, and John Wil

liams might start in his place. Forward Earl Koberlein is
also expected to start, but he just returned after sitting out
two weeks with a bad back. Freshman Eric Reveno will
start at center — if his ailing right knee is better.
Whoever starts will take the floor at 7:30 Saturday
night against a UCSD team that finished 11-17 last year,
including a 107-60 loss to Stanford. Still, Davis isn't
taking the Tritons lightly — he sent Asst. Coach Gary
Close to scout their game with Occidental University last
night. UCSD opened its season last Friday with a 68-59
victory over Azusa Pacific University.
"I would look for them to be a good test for us in our
opener," Davis said. The Tritons return five of their top
six scorers, including senior guard Brandon Nixon, who
averaged 14 points per game and was a National Athletic

Intercollegiate Association All-American last year.
Davis was all smiles after practice yesterday when he
announced he will have the services of sophomore John
Paye, the Cardinal football team's starting quarterback.
Paye, who played and started a few games for Davis last
season, ended the football season last Saturday with a 27-
10 victory over the University of California at Berkeley,
took Sunday off, and was at basketball practice Monday.
Davis said not only will Paye suit up Saturday, he'll see
action. "John Paye will play," Davis said. "He'll play the
point guard behind Ramee and he's also learning the No.
2 spot (off guard) so he'll be able to play alongside Ramee
when the situation calls for it."
Paye wasn't the only football player at basketball

practice this week. Wendell Brown, a wide receiver, is
also a guard and was six-for-six from the field in yester
day's scrimmage. Brown is from Edwardsville (Illinois)
High School, one known for producing college players.
"He (Brown) came in (to my office) last week one day
and told me he was interested in playing," Davis said. "I
said, 'If you're still interested Monday, come out to
practice.' "
After Saturday's opener, Stanford has the week off
before playing the University of the Pacific in the first
round of the four-team Apple Invitational Tournament
Nov. 30. The other two teams are LaSalle University and
Brigham Young University, both of which played in
postseason tournaments last year.
