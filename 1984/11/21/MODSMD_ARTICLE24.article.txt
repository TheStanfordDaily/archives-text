## Stanford to play Santa Clara 
### 
The Stanford women's basket
ball team will look for its first vic
tory of the regular season tonight
against the University of Santa
Clara at Maples Pavilion at 7:30.
The Cardinal won an exhibition
game against the Kolon team of
South Korea, 75-68, at Maples
Pavilion last Monday. However,
Stanford lost, 65-59, to the Univer
sity of California at Berkeley in its

regular-season opener in Berkeley.
The Cardinal has fallen behind in
both its games. Against South
Korea, Stanford trailed by 13
points four minutes into the second
half before tying the score with
9:30 remaining. The Cardinal was
behind Cal, 47-30, five minutes
into the second half but could only
get within four points.
Stanford's key could be its

bench. Against Cal, a preseason
top-20 team, the Cardinal began its
second-half comeback when Coach
Dotty McCrae inserted sophomore
guard Erica Mueser and freshman
forward Kami Anderson into the
lineup.
Stanford's slow starts might be
because of turnovers. The Cardinal
turned the ball over 20 times in the
first half against Cal.
