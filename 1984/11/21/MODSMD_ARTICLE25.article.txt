# Volleyball team to face Boilermakers of Big Ten
## 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford women's volleyball
team, which won its first WCAA
championship last weekend, will play
its final home game Saturday against
Purdue University of the Big Ten
Conference.
Stanford, 16-4 overall, placed first
in the Western Collegiate Athletic
Association after defeating Arizona
State University and the University of
Arizona Friday and Saturday,
respectively. Purdue finished second
in the Big Ten after losing to
Northwestern University in the
league championship finals.
Purdue has won three Big-Ten
championships in the past six seasons
and finished second last year.
Purdue is currently on a West
Coast tour, with matches scheduled
against San Jose State University, the
University of California at Berkeley
and the University of the Pacific.

According to Cardinal Asst. Coach
Don Shaw, many teams will play road
games after league play to prepare for
the National Collegiate Athletic As
sociation tournament or to raise their
records and better their chances for a
tournament bid.
Purdue will likely get a tournament
bid, according to Shaw, because the
Boilermakers are 23-9 and have been
ranked in the top 20 this season.
Shaw said Purdue's trip is a "good ex
perience for [Purdue] to play against
some of the top teams."
Leading the Boilermakers against
the West Coast teams will be outside
hitter Kim Corwin. Corwin, a junior
from West Point, Ind., leads Purdue
with 362 kills this season and is the
Boilermakers' "top player," Shaw
said. The Boilermakers have setter
Annette Bauer, a first-team All-Big
Ten player last year who is also hit
ting .320 this season.
Stanford will bid farewell to four

seniors playing their final home
match — Bobbie Broer, Susan Comp
ton. Deidra Dvorak and Brandace
Hope. Broer and Compton are the
Cardinal's co-captains this season,
Dvorak has been Stanford's\starting
setter the past three seasons, and
Hope has provided strength off the
bench this year.
The Boilermakers-Cardinal match
will begin at 5 p.m. in Maples
Pavilion and will be followed at 7:30
p.m. by a Stanford men's basketball
game against the University of Cali
fornia at San Diego.
A 32-team field for the NCAA vol
leyball playoffs will be announced
Monday. The top four seeded teams
will receive a first-round bye
(Stanford, as the WCAA champion,
will receive one) and advance to the
NCAA regionals, which begin Dec. 7.
The NCAA Final Four is scheduled
for Dec. 14 and 16 at UCLA's Pauley
Pavilion.
