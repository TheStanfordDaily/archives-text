## 'Carmen' celebrates spectacle of opera 
### STEVE VINEBERG Daily staff 
The prodigious Italian director
Francesco Rosi has made a film of
"Carmen" that approaches the
"Carmen" many of us dream of:
sumptuous, sensuous, beautifully
sung and rich in imagery. Shooting on
location in Seville and rural Spain, he
is able to provide the settings that a

Rosi is the master of the long shot,
and in this film — called 'Bizet's
Carmen' — he plays voyeur with it,
setting his camera as often as possible
above or across open spaces. Some of
these shots have a heady mag
nificence.

stage production, however im
aginative, can only hint at — bal
conies and terraces, an antique stone
building for the cigarette factory,
perilous mountain paths for the
smugglers to trek, and, best of all. a
glorious arena for Escamillo's bull
fight so that, for once, we don't have
to wait outside the gate and hear the
acclaim of an offstage crowd.
Rosi celebrates the spectacle of
opera and the immensity of the
Spanish countryside. He stages a
regal changing of the guard, he fills
the screen with long-legged cigarette
girls with roses in their hair, and his
Carmen (Julia Migenes-Johnson)
seems to have all of Andalusia for her
"Habenera."
Rosi is the master of the long shot
(perhaps no director since Renoir has

used it so expressively), and in this
film — called "Bizet's Carmen," to
reduce the confusion caused by so
many concurrent versions of the
Prosper Merimee novella and the
Georges Bizet opera — he plays
voyeur with it, setting his camera as
often as possible above or across
open spaces. Some of these shots
have a heady magnificence; Rosi and

his cinematographer, Pasquale De
Santis, see to it that we devour the
enormous, detailed vistas at a gulp.
And even when the screen doesn't
teem with singers and dancers (sol
diers and gypsies), a child playing near
a bonfire or a peasant ascending a
road slowly on muleback supplies a
perfect "discovered" element that
both situates the drama for us and
humanizes the landscape, as in a
painting by Breughel. At the end of
the film, when Carmen leaves the
bullfight to speak to Don Jose
(Placido Domingo) outside the arena,
Rosi's long shot answers a different
dramatic motive — to isolate these
two individuals and to emphasize the (
distance that has gathered between
them, distance that Carmen can only
traverse once, and for a single pur

pose: to meet her death.
Except for Ingmar Bergman, Rosi
must he the most intelligent director
who has ever filmed an opera (as well
as the most visually imaginative). He
has worked out a stylization that
meets the demands of both the score
and the libretto (by Henri Meilhac
and Ludovic Halevy), which contains
more spoken dialogue than many of
the other warhorses in the opera
repertory.
Technically, "Carmen" is an
operetta, but it is dark enough in tone
to resist being categorized as one, and
yet, because of its source, a spare,
ironic short novel notably lacking in
melodramatic grandeur, it is so earthy
and matter-of-fact (despite its built
in potential for spectacle) that one
can't think of it alongside the best
known works of Verdi and Puccini,
either. In form, "Carmen" is really a
musical drama, more like American
folk opera ("Porgy and Bess,"
"Street Scene") or even some Ameri
can musical shows with strong, dra
matic books ("Fiddler on the Roof')
than it is like grand opera.
Accordingly, Rosi and Tonino
Guerra have added more dialogue,
and Rosi has underscored the
naturalism of the spoken scenes; in
the first half hour, especially,
whenever a musical selection ends
and dialogue begins, the singers
recede into the background along
with the music. And the musical num
bers are just that: production pieces,
in which the camera is as carefully
choreographed as the dancers. (This
picture borrows the only vivid ele
ment from the "Carmen" Carlos
Saura directed last year: the choreog
rapher Antonio Gades and his stun
ning dance company, including — in a
bit — Cristina Hoyos.) The effect
recalls some of the best movie musi
cals — the Vincente Minnellis and the
