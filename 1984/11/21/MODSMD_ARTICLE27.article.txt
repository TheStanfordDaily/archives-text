## 'Carmen' celebrates spectacle of opera 
### STEVE VINEBERG Daily staff 
The prodigious Italian director
Francesco Rosi has made a film of
"Carmen" that approaches the
"Carmen" many of us dream of:
sumptuous, sensuous, beautifully
sung and rich in imagery. Shooting on
location in Seville and rural Spain, he
is able to provide the settings that a

Rosi is the master of the long shot,
and in this film — called 'Bizet's
Carmen' — he plays voyeur with it,
setting his camera as often as possible
above or across open spaces. Some of
these shots have a heady mag
nificence.

stage production, however im
aginative, can only hint at — bal
conies and terraces, an antique stone
building for the cigarette factory,
perilous mountain paths for the
smugglers to trek, and, best of all. a
glorious arena for Escamillo's bull
fight so that, for once, we don't have
to wait outside the gate and hear the
acclaim of an offstage crowd.
Rosi celebrates the spectacle of
opera and the immensity of the
Spanish countryside. He stages a
regal changing of the guard, he fills
the screen with long-legged cigarette
girls with roses in their hair, and his
Carmen (Julia Migenes-Johnson)
seems to have all of Andalusia for her
"Habenera."
Rosi is the master of the long shot
(perhaps no director since Renoir has

used it so expressively), and in this
film — called "Bizet's Carmen," to
reduce the confusion caused by so
many concurrent versions of the
Prosper Merimee novella and the
Georges Bizet opera — he plays
voyeur with it, setting his camera as
often as possible above or across
open spaces. Some of these shots
have a heady magnificence; Rosi and

his cinematographer, Pasquale De
Santis, see to it that we devour the
enormous, detailed vistas at a gulp.
And even when the screen doesn't
teem with singers and dancers (sol
diers and gypsies), a child playing near
a bonfire or a peasant ascending a
road slowly on muleback supplies a
perfect "discovered" element that
both situates the drama for us and
humanizes the landscape, as in a
painting by Breughel. At the end of
the film, when Carmen leaves the
bullfight to speak to Don Jose
(Placido Domingo) outside the arena,
Rosi's long shot answers a different
dramatic motive — to isolate these
two individuals and to emphasize the (
distance that has gathered between
them, distance that Carmen can only
traverse once, and for a single pur

pose: to meet her death.
Except for Ingmar Bergman, Rosi
must he the most intelligent director
who has ever filmed an opera (as well
as the most visually imaginative). He
has worked out a stylization that
meets the demands of both the score
and the libretto (by Henri Meilhac
and Ludovic Halevy), which contains
more spoken dialogue than many of
the other warhorses in the opera
repertory.
Technically, "Carmen" is an
operetta, but it is dark enough in tone
to resist being categorized as one, and
yet, because of its source, a spare,
ironic short novel notably lacking in
melodramatic grandeur, it is so earthy
and matter-of-fact (despite its built
in potential for spectacle) that one
can't think of it alongside the best
known works of Verdi and Puccini,
either. In form, "Carmen" is really a
musical drama, more like American
folk opera ("Porgy and Bess,"
"Street Scene") or even some Ameri
can musical shows with strong, dra
matic books ("Fiddler on the Roof')
than it is like grand opera.
Accordingly, Rosi and Tonino
Guerra have added more dialogue,
and Rosi has underscored the
naturalism of the spoken scenes; in
the first half hour, especially,
whenever a musical selection ends
and dialogue begins, the singers
recede into the background along
with the music. And the musical num
bers are just that: production pieces,
in which the camera is as carefully
choreographed as the dancers. (This
picture borrows the only vivid ele
ment from the "Carmen" Carlos
Saura directed last year: the choreog
rapher Antonio Gades and his stun
ning dance company, including — in a
bit — Cristina Hoyos.) The effect
recalls some of the best movie musi
cals — the Vincente Minnellis and the

Stanley Donens, as well as Carol
Reed's "Oliver!" — movies one
couldn't conceive of without music.
Two of the most ravishing se
quences in the picture demonstrate
how Bizet's score inspired Rosi's
already keen dramatic sense. When
Jose, as the officer in charge, enters
the cigarette factory to investigate
reports of a knife fight between two
of the employees, the camera tracks
the corporal's journey from room to
room, in each corner finding he has

girls' chorus)

made a wrong turn and must be
pointed again in the direction of the
victim and her assailant. It's a tour de
force: The music (the cigarette girls'
chorus) sweeps us through the build
ing, and it seems to command the
movement of the camera, too, until
finally Jose reaches Carmen — the
woman who flirted so outrageously
with him a few moments earlier
(during the "Habanera") — and
realizes it was she who wielded that
knife.
Later, Rosi uses the Act 111
overture to tie together a few nar
rative strands. As the music plays and

day breaks in the Andalusian hills,
Escamillo, the toreador, rounds up
the bulls for the day's fight, the smug
glers Carmen keeps company with
return to their hideout and Jose's
childhood sweetheart Micaela (Faith
Esham) travels toward her unfaithful
inamorato with the news of his
mother's illness.
If "Bizet's Carmen" were a joyous
exercise in style and nothing more,
Rosi's mastery would justify seeing it.
But the music alone did not draw
Rosi to this project: The man who
gave us "Eboli" and "Three Brot
hers" always thinks in terms of the re
lationship between theme and char
acter, and he always grounds his men
and women in social, political and
economic realities. At the beginning
of what would be Act II on stage, he
contrasts the exacting flamenco dan
cing presented as entertainment at
the mansion of a local lord with the
more robust and freewheeling en
semble dancing by gypsies gathered
at open fires beyond the lord's gates,
where the soldiers mingle naturally
with the gypsy women because they,
too, are peasants.
Really, all of the characters in this
opera come from the same stock
(including the palest of them,
Micaela, who, even in a muscular
production like this one, stops the ac
tion cold whenever she appears) —
that is, all but one: Escamillo
(Ruggero Raimondi). He arrives in a
horse-drawn carriage, sipping wine
with beautiful, porcelain-white wom
en wearing aristocratic mantillas,
and when he steps down to answer a
toast from the crowd, he's slumming
— a movie star signing autographs for
his fans, or (more appropriately) a
visiting prince choosing a new
mistress from among the talent thrust
unmistakably in his direction.
It's obvious why he selects Carmen.
Julia Migenes-Johnson (who is half
Greek and half Puerto Rican) plays
her like a sexy imp, alternately impas
sioned and insouciant, with stringy
black curls as impudent as Topsy's,
and with all her weight focused in her
groin (the way Irene Papas' was

when she played Electra and Helen of
Troy), so that any man she stares at
understands immediately what she
has in mind. (Rosi makes the point
over and over again in this film that
Carmen's idea of "la liberte," and
that of the smugglers who join her in
enticing Jose to join their band, is,
purely and simply, sexual freedom.)
And it's equally obvious why Car
men deserts Jose for Escamillo —
when this country wench, who
presumably learned how to steal and
deceive as survival techniques, sees
the toreador, the idol of the bull ring,
decked out in his ballroom finery, he
represents more splendor than she
has ever imagined. (The casting of
Ruggero Raimondi, a distinguished
looking baritone who is, however, a
far cry from the broad-chested,

youthful Escamillos we generally
think of, makes it clear that the bull
fighter's appeal is not really sexual.)
And from that point on Jose doesn't
have a chance. The irony is that (as
Rosi and Migenes-Johnson portray
her) once Carmen joins Escamillo's
world, and tells Jose that, no longer
loving him, she will either live free
with her new love or die free at Jose's
hands, she looks stiff and uncomfort
able for the first time: Her impressive
new clothes restrain her so that she
can't sashay across the screen the way
she does in all of her other scenes.
Rosi interprets Carmen's story as the
tragedy of a woman who, drawn to a
world she doesn't belong in, becomes
less than she was and dies lost.
Julia Migenes-Johnson gives the
only powerful performance in

"Bizet's Carmen" (and she's the only
singer on screen who can take a close
up in mid-aria without looking even
momentarily foolish), but all the
other principals seem right, and no
one disgraces himself.
Placido Domingo doesn't have
that rigid, embarrassed look he wore
all through Franco Zeffirelli's "La
Traviata," as if he'd just seen the
rushes from the day before and knew
how ridiculous the whole enterprise
was. In fact, since "La Traviata," with
its statuary and sculpted fountains
and cooing doves — the product of a
crippled 19th-century imagination if
there ever was one — furnished the
last example of opera on film,
"Bizet's Carmen" comes as a particu
larly refreshing surprise.
Strangely enough, the last

"Carmen" I saw that was half as
satifying as Rosi's was the production
Zeffirelli staged at the Metropolitan,
which PBS televised some five years
ago (with Domingo as Don Jose).
Zeffi relli may he a boob when he gets
behind a camera, but if his movies of
Shakespeare seem to wish they were
operas, his staging of opera has a
wonderful cinematic quality that
works much better (and on PBS,
someone else supervised the camera).
His well-acted, naturalistic
"Carmen" gave us a hint of what a
first-rate film director could do with
this marvelous opera, and "Bizet's
Carmen" fulfills the promise. Watch
ing this picture, you feel — as you do
in Bergman's "Magic Flute" — that
the screen, after all, is the natural
home of opera.
