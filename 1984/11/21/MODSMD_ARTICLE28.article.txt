# Stanford surveyed
## Ms. magazine studies sexual coercion 
### R. TAEZA PIERCE Staff writer 
Almost 200 Stanford upperclass
men have participated in a national
survey on sexual coercion in relation
ships that will be published in Ms.
magazine next fall.
The 182 questionnaires turned in
to Residential Education will soon be
on their way to Kent State University
in Ohio for analysis.
Stanford is one of 30 schools par
ticipating in the National College
Sexual Experiences Survey, accord
ing to Annette Bus, a representative
from the Ms. Foundation for Educa
tion and Communication.
Bus said Ms. magazine is co
sponsoring the project along with
Kent State Psychology Prof. Mary
Koss. Accoiding to Bus, Ms. maga
zine is not financially involved.
Ms. is co-sponsoring the study par
tially because "a great part of the
readers of Ms. magazine are college
students," who should have access to
information about "date rape and
sexual assault," Bus said. She said
Ms. will "have first-hand access to the
results," and will pass on the informa
tion to its readers sometime next fall.
A statement accompanying the
questionnaires said the study aims "to
document the frequency among col
lege students of miscommunication or
misunderstanding about sexual be
havior; to learn what the psychologi
cal impact of such an experience is;
land] to understand some of the fac
tors that lead to the occurrence of
these experiences."
According to Alice Supton, assis
tant dean of Res Ed, data at Stanford
were collected differently than at the
other 29 schools that participated.
She said that while other schools
administered the questionnaire in
classroom situations, Stanford opted

to channel it through Res Ed.
Res Ed distributed 300 question
naires to resident assistants in up
perclass houses and asked the RAs
"to explain the survey and ask people
to fill it out," Supton said.
Students filled out and returned the
questionnaires anonymously. "It
wasn't given and filled out in one
place," Supton said.
She said Res Ed guaranteed that
"anonymity would be protected . . .
and provided drop boxes in residence
offices," where students could return
the questionnaires.
The survey, geared to both men
and women, asked specific questions
about the occurrence of forced sexual
activity in relationships.
Supton said the entire survey takes
about 45 minutes to complete, adding
that students were informed they
could stop answering the sexually ex
plicit questions at any point if they
became "upset or offended at the
content" of the questionnaire.
According to Supton, the directors
of the project are aware of Stanford's
revised method of administering the
survey. Although she said she did not
feel there would be any major prob
lems, she admitted, "What you lose is
the random distribution obtained" by
administering it in a classroom situa
tion.
Of the 300 questionnaires given to
RAs, Supton said 182 had been
returned to Res Ed by Monday.
Supton attributed the response to
an "active awareness" about rape on
campus and to recent events that she
said "have made it imperative that we
do [remain aware]."
Supton said that because Res Ed
received more than 100 question
naires, she has asked Koss to provide
a separate analysis of the Stanford
data.
