# Tuition rises with costs
## 
### MARY YUH Staff writer 
The statistics tell the story:
• A 1985 Stanford graduate will have spent more than
$30,000 on tuition alone.
• Since the 1972-73 academic year, Stanford tuition has
increased from $2,850 to $9,705 per academic year.
It is undeniable that Stanford is a costly institution, and
according to Tim Warner, associate provost for Manage
ment Budget, it is inevitable that tuition will continue
to rise.
But University officials claim they are committed to
holding tuition increases at a level close to that of infla
tion.
Tuition represents about 46 percent of the income of
the operating budget, which supports the University's
core programs. As the cost of maintaining and upgrading
these programs rises, tuition must rise, Warner said.
The most important factor that the Committee on
Finance and Administration and the Committee on Aca
demic Affairs and Development consider in formulating a
recommendation for the general tuition rate is the mainte
nance of a high-quality academic program, Warner said.
An outstanding faculty is crucial to that quality, and,
therefore, competitive faculty salaries are a high priority,
according to a report sent to the board of trustees last
February as part of the tuition recommendation for 1984-
85.
A second area in which cost and quality are linked is the
upgrading of facilities and services for students and fac
ulty. An example of such upgrading is found in the student
computing equipment in the LOTS system. That equip

ment has added $225,000 to the budget in the past four
years, the report said.
Another consideration in determining the tuition rate is
how Stanford tuition compares to tuition at similar uni
versities. Because these universities have basically the
same kind of expenses, tuition should be comparable,
Warner said.
In 1983-84, tuition at Harvard was $9,700; at the Mas
sachusetts Institute of Technology, $9,600; at Princeton.
$9,450; at Yale, $9,O5(TTat Cornell, $8,900; and at tne
University of Chicago, $8,043. The tuition at Stanford for
the 1983-84 academic year was $9,027.
Keeping Stanford affordable for a broad range of highly
qualified students is an important consideration, Warner
said. The report for the trustees asserts that the University
is "particularly concerned that our tuition might affect the
actual or perceived affordability of Stanford among low
and middle-income families."
The University views the affordability of a college edu
cation in terms of the savings, current spending and bor
rowing of students' families. A useful measure of affor
dability is the Disposable Personal Income (DPI), which is
the aggregate income available after taxes, Warner said.
From 1971 to 1985, the average annual growth rate of
the DPI has been 9.9 percent, while that of tuition has
been 10.5 percent. The main reason behind tuition's
greater growth rate is that salaries, which are a major fac
tor in determining tuition, must grow at a rate higher than
inflation in order for them to be competitive, Warner said.
Warner stressed that this is true not only in education
