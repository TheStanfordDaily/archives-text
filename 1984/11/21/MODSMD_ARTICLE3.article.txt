# Tuition rises with costs
## 
### MARY YUH Staff writer 
The statistics tell the story:
• A 1985 Stanford graduate will have spent more than
$30,000 on tuition alone.
• Since the 1972-73 academic year, Stanford tuition has
increased from $2,850 to $9,705 per academic year.
It is undeniable that Stanford is a costly institution, and
according to Tim Warner, associate provost for Manage
ment Budget, it is inevitable that tuition will continue
to rise.
But University officials claim they are committed to
holding tuition increases at a level close to that of infla
tion.
Tuition represents about 46 percent of the income of
the operating budget, which supports the University's
core programs. As the cost of maintaining and upgrading
these programs rises, tuition must rise, Warner said.
The most important factor that the Committee on
Finance and Administration and the Committee on Aca
demic Affairs and Development consider in formulating a
recommendation for the general tuition rate is the mainte
nance of a high-quality academic program, Warner said.
An outstanding faculty is crucial to that quality, and,
therefore, competitive faculty salaries are a high priority,
according to a report sent to the board of trustees last
February as part of the tuition recommendation for 1984-
85.
A second area in which cost and quality are linked is the
upgrading of facilities and services for students and fac
ulty. An example of such upgrading is found in the student
computing equipment in the LOTS system. That equip

ment has added $225,000 to the budget in the past four
years, the report said.
Another consideration in determining the tuition rate is
how Stanford tuition compares to tuition at similar uni
versities. Because these universities have basically the
same kind of expenses, tuition should be comparable,
Warner said.
In 1983-84, tuition at Harvard was $9,700; at the Mas
sachusetts Institute of Technology, $9,600; at Princeton.
$9,450; at Yale, $9,O5(TTat Cornell, $8,900; and at tne
University of Chicago, $8,043. The tuition at Stanford for
the 1983-84 academic year was $9,027.
Keeping Stanford affordable for a broad range of highly
qualified students is an important consideration, Warner
said. The report for the trustees asserts that the University
is "particularly concerned that our tuition might affect the
actual or perceived affordability of Stanford among low
and middle-income families."
The University views the affordability of a college edu
cation in terms of the savings, current spending and bor
rowing of students' families. A useful measure of affor
dability is the Disposable Personal Income (DPI), which is
the aggregate income available after taxes, Warner said.
From 1971 to 1985, the average annual growth rate of
the DPI has been 9.9 percent, while that of tuition has
been 10.5 percent. The main reason behind tuition's
greater growth rate is that salaries, which are a major fac
tor in determining tuition, must grow at a rate higher than
inflation in order for them to be competitive, Warner said.
Warner stressed that this is true not only in education
but also in other fields, which means
that the salaries of those who pay tui
tion are assumed to grow at a compa
rable rate.
Whatever the reason, tuition has
been growing at a rate higher than
that of the DPI. "That's what we are
most concerned about — that tuition
does not grow faster than the ability
to pay," Warner said.
Efforts are being made, he said, to
narrow the gap between the growth
rate of the DPI and that of tuition.
Last year's 7.5 percent increase in
tuition — the lowest since the 1974
increase of 7.7 percent — is an exam
ple of such efforts.
The tuition increase for 1985-86 is
not yet known, but according to the
"Operating Budget Guidelines:
1984-85," compiled by the Office of
Management and Budget, it is esti

mated to be "inflation plus 1.5 per
cent." This growth rate is expected to
apply through the 1987-88 school
year.
In light of the University's concern
that a Stanford education be afford
able to highly qualified students, it is
not surprising that "financial aid is
one of the highest priorities, and
there is no sign that that is changing,"
Warner claimed. Financial aid is
immune from budget reductions and
actually increases every year, he said.
AvCording to Robert Huff, director
of financial aids, approximately 64
percent of Stanford undergraduates
receive some sort of financial aid:
loans, grants, jobs or combinations
of these elements. In 1983-84, the
University distributed $23,133,412 in
grants, and it is estimated that
$24,857,000 will be distributed
during this academic year.
Children from middle-income
families constitute the bulk of the un
dergraduate student body, according
to Huff, and these families are

"making a significant sacrifice" for a
Stanford education.
The increase in the amount of
grants awarded is "directly connected
to student costs," Huff said. "The
University is committed to meeting
the demonstrated need of all under
graduates."
A demonstration of that commit
ment is the policy of need-blind ad
missions. "The policy of need-blind
admissions is an important one for
Stanford. We intend to maintain it,
even as student budgets rise and
greater institutional resources are re
quired" to meet the demonstrated
financial needs of all undergraduates,
said a report sent to the trustees.

1984-85," compiled by the Office of
Management and Budget, it is esti

mated to be "inflation plus 1.5 per
cent." This growth rate is expected to
apply through the 1987-88 school
year.
In light of the University's concern
that a Stanford education be afford
able to highly qualified students, it is
not surprising that "financial aid is
one of the highest priorities, and
there is no sign that that is changing,"
Warner claimed. Financial aid is
immune from budget reductions and
actually increases every year, he said.
AvCording to Robert Huff, director
of financial aids, approximately 64
percent of Stanford undergraduates
receive some sort of financial aid:
loans, grants, jobs or combinations
of these elements. In 1983-84, the
University distributed $23,133,412 in
grants, and it is estimated that
$24,857,000 will be distributed
during this academic year.
Children from middle-income
families constitute the bulk of the un
dergraduate student body, according
to Huff, and these families are

"making a significant sacrifice" for a
Stanford education.
The increase in the amount of
grants awarded is "directly connected
to student costs," Huff said. "The
University is committed to meeting
the demonstrated need of all under
graduates."
A demonstration of that commit
ment is the policy of need-blind ad
missions. "The policy of need-blind
admissions is an important one for
Stanford. We intend to maintain it,
even as student budgets rise and
greater institutional resources are re
quired" to meet the demonstrated
financial needs of all undergraduates,
said a report sent to the trustees.
The statistics tell the story:
• A 1985 Stanford graduate will have spent more than
$30,000 on tuition alone.
• Since the 1972-73 academic year, Stanford tuition has
increased from $2,850 to $9,705 per academic year.
It is undeniable that Stanford is a costly institution, and
according to Tim Warner, associate provost for Manage
ment Budget, it is inevitable that tuition will continue
to rise.
But University officials claim they are committed to
holding tuition increases at a level close to that of infla
tion.
Tuition represents about 46 percent of the income of
the operating budget, which supports the University's
core programs. As the cost of maintaining and upgrading
these programs rises, tuition must rise, Warner said.
The most important factor that the Committee on
Finance and Administration and the Committee on Aca
demic Affairs and Development consider in formulating a
recommendation for the general tuition rate is the mainte
nance of a high-quality academic program, Warner said.
An outstanding faculty is crucial to that quality, and,
therefore, competitive faculty salaries are a high priority,
according to a report sent to the board of trustees last
February as part of the tuition recommendation for 1984-
85.
A second area in which cost and quality are linked is the
upgrading of facilities and services for students and fac
ulty. An example of such upgrading is found in the student
computing equipment in the LOTS system. That equip

ment has added $225,000 to the budget in the past four
years, the report said.
Another consideration in determining the tuition rate is
how Stanford tuition compares to tuition at similar uni
versities. Because these universities have basically the
same kind of expenses, tuition should be comparable,
Warner said.
In 1983-84, tuition at Harvard was $9,700; at the Mas
sachusetts Institute of Technology, $9,600; at Princeton.
$9,450; at Yale, $9,O5(TTat Cornell, $8,900; and at tne
University of Chicago, $8,043. The tuition at Stanford for
the 1983-84 academic year was $9,027.
Keeping Stanford affordable for a broad range of highly
qualified students is an important consideration, Warner
said. The report for the trustees asserts that the University
is "particularly concerned that our tuition might affect the
actual or perceived affordability of Stanford among low
and middle-income families."
The University views the affordability of a college edu
cation in terms of the savings, current spending and bor
rowing of students' families. A useful measure of affor
dability is the Disposable Personal Income (DPI), which is
the aggregate income available after taxes, Warner said.
From 1971 to 1985, the average annual growth rate of
the DPI has been 9.9 percent, while that of tuition has
been 10.5 percent. The main reason behind tuition's
greater growth rate is that salaries, which are a major fac
tor in determining tuition, must grow at a rate higher than
inflation in order for them to be competitive, Warner said.
Warner stressed that this is true not only in education
but also in other fields, which means
that the salaries of those who pay tui
tion are assumed to grow at a compa
rable rate.
Whatever the reason, tuition has
been growing at a rate higher than
that of the DPI. "That's what we are
most concerned about — that tuition
does not grow faster than the ability
to pay," Warner said.
Efforts are being made, he said, to
narrow the gap between the growth
rate of the DPI and that of tuition.
Last year's 7.5 percent increase in
tuition — the lowest since the 1974
increase of 7.7 percent — is an exam
ple of such efforts.
The tuition increase for 1985-86 is
not yet known, but according to the
"Operating Budget Guidelines:
1984-85," compiled by the Office of
Management and Budget, it is esti

mated to be "inflation plus 1.5 per
cent." This growth rate is expected to
apply through the 1987-88 school
year.
