# Hamilton looks back at a sour football season
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
It was early Friday morning at
San Fi'ancisco International Air
port and the Stanford football team
was preparing to board its Con
tinental Airlines charter flight to
Oklahoma City. Stanford would
open the 1984 season against the
University of Oklahoma the next
day.
Since it was a charter flight, the
team did not bother issuing board
ing passes. Instead, a stewardess at
the gate asked players for their
names and checked them off a com
puter list as they boarded the plane.
Dwain Hamilton, a senior cor
nerback, took his place in line and
eventually reached the stewardess.
Hamilton, all 5-foot-9 and 162
pounds of him, stepped up and with
his best poker face, said, "Dorsett.
Tony."
The stewardess went up and
down the list looking for the name

of the Dallas Cowboys' running
back before Hamilton corrected
her with his true name and one of
his toothy smiles.
Besides being one of the Card
inal's smallest players, Hamilton is
considered, as Stanford's press
euide states, "one of the more
popular players." His teammates

describe him as an easy-going, fun
loving person with a sense of humor
to match.
That's all good and well as far as
Hamilton's concerned, but there's
still one problem. A big problem.
He didn't play this season. And
while the seasons of 15 other
seniors ended Saturday with a 27-
10 Big Game victory, Hamilton's
might as well have ended before it
began.
Plainly and simply, Hamilton
thinks he got a raw deal.
"You get a fair number of repeti
tions in practice, but that does not
guarantee a fair evaluation," he
said on the eve of his final game as
a Cardinal. "And being frank and
honest, I don't think 1 was given a
fair evaluation."
But there's a hitch to all this.
Hamilton's beef isn't your typical
case of sour grapes.


Dwain Hamilton
"There are obviously going to be
people who are upset that they're not
playing," he says. "But some of those
people who are upset just do not have
it. I know — I have already proven
myself — that I have the ability to
plav. I did it last year.
"It's not like I've never played and
I'm bitching about it. I have already
proven myself and I wouldn't have
anything to stand on if I hadn't."
Not only did Hamilton play last
season, logging 147 minutes in all 11
games, he started twice. He finished
the season 1 Ith on the team in total
tackles with 45 and eighth in solo
tackles with 31. He also had an inter

ception. And this was on a Cardinal
defensive secondary that was statisti
cally the best in the Pacific 10 Con
ference. holding its opponents to
167.2 yards passing per game.
But it was also a secondary hit hard
by graduation. Three players, corner
back Kevin Baird and safeties
Vaughn Williams and Charles Hutch
ings, graduated last spring. A fourth.
Darrell Grissum, decided not to
return this season after seriously in
juring his back in the 1983 Big Game.
That left only two experienced
members of what many call one of the
best Cardinal secondaries ever. Eric
Price was one. Hamilton the other.
Price started 10 of the 11 games this

season. Hamilton played a total of
eight downs, and no passes were com
pleted against him.
"It just really shocked me to come
in this year thinking that I was going
to play and he an integral part of the
defense and not play, which I didn't
think was fair," he says.
Hamilton might not have minded
frequenting the sidelines so much had
this year's secondary been anywhere
near as successful as last year's. It
wasn't, though In one year, the
Cardinal went from first in the Pac-10
in pass defense to dead last. Granted,
Stanford's rushing defense improved
this year and forced teams to pass,
hut the Cardinal still gave up 227.2
yards per game through the air, 60
more than in 1983.
Hamilton's coach, Dick Mannini,
who doubles as defensive coordinator
and defensive backs coach, thinks he
gave his senior cornerback every
chance to help out.
"I don't feel he wasn't given the
opportunity," Mannini said. "He was.
He just didn't take advantage of it
when it was there. I'll put it this way
— the right to play has to be earned.
"No one owed him playing time or
a starting berth. The others surpassed
him. We thought we had two people
that worked a little harder and im
proved a little more than Dwain did."
But Hamilton's teammates beg to
differ, and one, running back Shaun
Avant, called Mannini "biased
against [Hamilton] because of his
size."
"He played last year and showed
he had the ability," Avant said. "This
year, they would list him as a second
team player and then move people in
front of him. He really didn't get a
chance to prove himself."
Defensive tackle Garin Veris said
he was "surprised" Hamilton did
more watching than playing this
season. "After seeing him last year
[in games], I thought he would be
playing more this year."
Mannini, in his first year at Stan
ford like the rest of Head Coach Jack
Elway's staff, said Hamilton had the
statistical — but not the physical —
credentials for the job. "He got every
opportunity to show that he could
play," Mannini said. "He doesn't
have any speed and he's not a very
physical player. I like the kid. There
were just a lot of things working
against him."
Not so, says Hamilton. He points
out that he ran a 9.7-second 100-yard
dash in high school and a 4.56 40-
yard dash his sophomore year here.
But last winter, Hamilton slowed to a

4.54 when, as he tells it.he slipped
while being timed. Later that year, he
clocked a 4.71 on a wet field. "On the
depth chart, however," Hamilton
said, "they put down the 4.84. which
is my slowest time. They didn't put
down my 4.71
And then there's Hamilton's size.
He's 5-9, well, with his shoes on. And
the press guide lists him at 162
pounds.
• | just think when he (Mannini)
came in. he had an idea of the type of
defensive back he wanted," Hamilton
says. " He likes big guys. That was just
not to mv advantage. It's unfortunate
for me.
"I'm not saying that he's wrong in
saying he wants big defensive backs,
but I just didn't think I should be held
back because of my size. From their
standpoint, they come in and here
they have a senior who is 165 pounds
and he ran a 4.84, slip or no slip. Ob
jectively looking at that, they say,
•Can this guy be of any service to us?
No, because he's too small and he's
too slow.' "
Because he was used early and in
frequently this season, Hamilton
could conceivably salvage a year of
eligibility and return next year as a
fifth-year senior. As he puts it, no
way. "I just don't want to go through
it again. I want to get on with some
other aspects of my life."
• • •
Hamilton came to Stanford a small
but highly recruited player from St.
Thomas Aquinas prep school in Ft.
Lauderdale, Fla. He arrived at
preseason camp in August of 1981,
when the Bay Area was conducting
aerial spraying to rid its trees of the
Mediterranean fruit fly. Immediately,
he was tagged with the nickname,
"Med Fly."
Hamilton didn't play much his
freshman year, except on special
teams. He was the guy who flew in
from the side on field goals and extra
points trying to block them.
Sophomore year, Hamilton was
moved to defensive back from wide
receiver, where he had spent most of
his time as a freshman. It was a posi
tion he had only played during the
second half of his senior year in high
school and one "I had to grow into."
The plan was to redshirt him and not
to rush the growing process.
Those plans suddenly changed in
the eighth game of the season against,
of all teams, undefeated and No.l
ranked University of Washington.
Starting right cornerback Price was
injured early in the game and his
backup, Rodney Gilmore, went down

early in the second half. Bang, Hamil
ton was making his collegiate debut at
cornerback.
"I had never played, and we are on
national TV against the No. 1 team in
the nation," he recalls. "Here I am
thrust into this situation, and 1 thought
I performed pretty well."
He did. Besides helping Stanford
pull off what is generally considered
the biggest Cardinal upset in the past
few decades, Hamilton even helped
force a fumble. "I held the tight end
up and then Garin (Veris) came and
finished him off and forced the
fumble."
Things got even brighter Hamil
ton's junior year, when Andy Chris
toff arrived on the scene as the new
defensive backs coach.
"The change was junior year, when

Christoff came and he took time with
me," Hamilton says."He told me
what I had to do to play. He was very
open and up front with me. Fie said.
'You have to be able to tackle and
cover. You can already cover very
well. All you have to do is be able to
tackle and you'll be able to play in
this league.'
"He told me what 1 had to do. I did
it and I played, and 1 played well.
Hamilton started two games
against San Jose State and the Uni
versity of Southern California — and
was the secondary's first-string
"nickel back" in obvious passing situ
ations. He had an interception against
Arizona State University and a nine
tackle game against the University of
Oregon and San Jose State.
"The minute the Cal game (the

Hamilton started twice at cornerback and had two nine-tackle games
during the 1983 season, but played eight downs this year.
season finale) was over, I was already
getting excited about next season he
cause I knew I'd he starting at oni of
the corners," he says. "But every
thing all of a sudden just changed."
Head Coach Paul Wiggin was
politely asked to resign hy Athletic
Director Andy Geiger near the end of
last season and hence the 1983 Big
Game was Wiggins last at Stanford.
It was also the last for Wiggin's staff,
and Christoff left to coach defense at
Notre Dame. Enter Jack Elway and a
new staff, one that included Mannini.
Exit Hamilton from the starting
lineup.
"That was like my freshman year,
essentially," Hamilton says of his
junior season. "And then this year
would be my second year and I
thought I could improve upon what I
did last year, and I thought I could
have done very well. As a matter of
fact, he (Christoff) told me I could
have been one of the best corners in
the conference, which I think is a
heck of a compliment playing in the
Pac-10."
When contacted at Notre Dame, a
reserved Christoff only would say,
"The only comment that I would like
to make is that Dwain and I had a
really good relationship. Whatever
has happened at Stanford has hap
pened."
For Hamilton, however, more has
happened to him than simply not
playing. He's gone through periods of
depression. His grades have slipped.
He even went on academic probation.
"It's depressing (not playing)," he
says."It affects your studies. You're
tired after practice and you go home
and have to study. It affects every
thing you do. It is very difficult to
separate your academic life from your
football life.
"I've been playing football since I
was seven, and if you've been playing
for two-thirds of your life, it's no
longer a game," he continues. "It's
like, as football goes, so goes life. It
shouldn't be that way, but then again
when you spend so much time doing

something like that, you become a
part of it and it becomes a part of you.
"It forced me to think about
academics a great deal more.
Honestly, when I came in here — I
think a lot of college players do — I
really wanted to go to the pros. I
came to play football and the
academics, I wouldn't call them a pe
ripheral, but a means to an end in a
sense."
Avant, one of his roommates for
the past two years, said Hamilton was
often depressed about not playing.
"He would spend most of his time in
his room," Avant said. "He just slept
all the time."
One thing Hamilton didn't do was
study, and now he needs to return for
a fifth year to finish his pre-medical
requirements. He plans to attend
either medical school — and follow in
the footsteps of his father, a surgeon
in Ft. Lauderdale — or music school.
Hamilton plays the drums and music,
he says, "is something that makes me
very happy. I love playing it."
Despite what happened on the
football field this year — or, in his
case, what didn't happen — Hamilton
doesn't regret his decision to attend
Stanford. "Outside of football, my
experience here has been a very good
one and a positive one," he says,
"because of the type of people that
are here. You just can't go to a better
place."
Hamilton also finds some good in
the bad times he went through during
the season. It's taken its toll on other
parts of his life, but as far as Hamil
ton's concerned, the end, if not here,
is near.
"It's like my father told me once,
'A character is forged in the crucible
of pain,' which is true because I look
at it and it's made me a stronger per
son," he says. "I'll probably look
back on this, and I'll be happy I went
through it.
"Football has become a part of my
life — it is a part of my life. And right
now I'm in transition from that being
a major part of my life to something I
do on Saturday and Sunday after

noons watching on TV. It's just a part
of growing up, part of the maturation
process you have to go through. It's
painful, but it will pay dividends in
the end."
Hamilton has learned a lot since
coming to Stanford as an innocent
freshman. And it was that year he ad
mittedly learned the hard way more
often than not.
There are stories of how Hamilton
talked a friend into lending him his
car, convincing him he knew how to
drive a manual transmission. It wasn't
until Hamilton lurched down the
street and stalled at the first stop sign
that his friend realized Hamilton was
learning how then.
There's also the time Hamilton
went to the Cameo Club, a place just
south of campus where playing low
ball poker for money is legal. Hamil
ton claimed he knew how to play, but
when he unknowingly won a hand,
the dealer had to explain to him that
the money in the middle of the table
was his.
And then there's the time Hamil
ton went to an off-campus party and
met a girl who was a parapsy
chologist. "She was weird, she was
wild," he recalls. "She started talking
about ghosts and spirits and every
thing, and I said, 'Well, maybe I bet
ter go ask somebody else to dance.
Thank you.' She was like Elvira, the
mistress of the night. I just wanted to
get the hell away from her and hope
she didn't get mad at me and put
some spell on me or something."
But, as Hamilton says, it wasn't un
til his senior year that he learned the
most about himself. Like his fresh
man year, he learned the hard way.
Only this time it was more painful.
"It's helped me discover other
parts of my personality and other
ways I can become a full person." he
says. "It's almost like you feel like
you're less of a person because you're
not playing football. And that's
wrong. Football is just one hat that
you put on."
But one hat that will stay in Hamil
ton's closet. Forever.
It was early Friday morning at
San Fi'ancisco International Air
port and the Stanford football team
was preparing to board its Con
tinental Airlines charter flight to
Oklahoma City. Stanford would
open the 1984 season against the
University of Oklahoma the next

back on this, and I'll be happy I went
through it.
"Football has become a part of my
life — it is a part of my life. And right
now I'm in transition from that being
a major part of my life to something I
do on Saturday and Sunday after

noons watching on TV. It's just a part
of growing up, part of the maturation
process you have to go through. It's
painful, but it will pay dividends in
the end."
Hamilton has learned a lot since
coming to Stanford as an innocent
freshman. And it was that year he ad
mittedly learned the hard way more
often than not.
There are stories of how Hamilton
talked a friend into lending him his
car, convincing him he knew how to
drive a manual transmission. It wasn't
until Hamilton lurched down the
street and stalled at the first stop sign
that his friend realized Hamilton was
learning how then.
There's also the time Hamilton
went to the Cameo Club, a place just
south of campus where playing low
ball poker for money is legal. Hamil
ton claimed he knew how to play, but
when he unknowingly won a hand,
the dealer had to explain to him that
the money in the middle of the table
was his.
And then there's the time Hamil
ton went to an off-campus party and
met a girl who was a parapsy
chologist. "She was weird, she was
wild," he recalls. "She started talking
about ghosts and spirits and every
thing, and I said, 'Well, maybe I bet
ter go ask somebody else to dance.
Thank you.' She was like Elvira, the
mistress of the night. I just wanted to
get the hell away from her and hope
she didn't get mad at me and put
some spell on me or something."
But, as Hamilton says, it wasn't un
til his senior year that he learned the
most about himself. Like his fresh
man year, he learned the hard way.
Only this time it was more painful.
"It's helped me discover other
parts of my personality and other
ways I can become a full person." he
says. "It's almost like you feel like
you're less of a person because you're
not playing football. And that's
wrong. Football is just one hat that
you put on."
But one hat that will stay in Hamil
ton's closet. Forever.
It was early Friday morning at
San Fi'ancisco International Air
port and the Stanford football team
was preparing to board its Con
tinental Airlines charter flight to
Oklahoma City. Stanford would
open the 1984 season against the
University of Oklahoma the next
day.
Since it was a charter flight, the
team did not bother issuing board
ing passes. Instead, a stewardess at
the gate asked players for their
names and checked them off a com
puter list as they boarded the plane.
Dwain Hamilton, a senior cor
nerback, took his place in line and
eventually reached the stewardess.
Hamilton, all 5-foot-9 and 162
pounds of him, stepped up and with
his best poker face, said, "Dorsett.
Tony."
The stewardess went up and
down the list looking for the name

of the Dallas Cowboys' running
back before Hamilton corrected
her with his true name and one of
his toothy smiles.
Besides being one of the Card
inal's smallest players, Hamilton is
considered, as Stanford's press
euide states, "one of the more
popular players." His teammates

describe him as an easy-going, fun
loving person with a sense of humor
to match.
That's all good and well as far as
Hamilton's concerned, but there's
still one problem. A big problem.
He didn't play this season. And
while the seasons of 15 other
seniors ended Saturday with a 27-
10 Big Game victory, Hamilton's
might as well have ended before it
began.
Plainly and simply, Hamilton
thinks he got a raw deal.
"You get a fair number of repeti
tions in practice, but that does not
guarantee a fair evaluation," he
said on the eve of his final game as
a Cardinal. "And being frank and
honest, I don't think 1 was given a
fair evaluation."
But there's a hitch to all this.
Hamilton's beef isn't your typical
case of sour grapes.


Dwain Hamilton
"There are obviously going to be
people who are upset that they're not
playing," he says. "But some of those
people who are upset just do not have
it. I know — I have already proven
myself — that I have the ability to
plav. I did it last year.
"It's not like I've never played and
I'm bitching about it. I have already
proven myself and I wouldn't have
anything to stand on if I hadn't."
Not only did Hamilton play last
season, logging 147 minutes in all 11
games, he started twice. He finished
the season 1 Ith on the team in total
tackles with 45 and eighth in solo
tackles with 31. He also had an inter

ception. And this was on a Cardinal
defensive secondary that was statisti
cally the best in the Pacific 10 Con
ference. holding its opponents to
167.2 yards passing per game.
But it was also a secondary hit hard
by graduation. Three players, corner
back Kevin Baird and safeties
Vaughn Williams and Charles Hutch
ings, graduated last spring. A fourth.
Darrell Grissum, decided not to
return this season after seriously in
juring his back in the 1983 Big Game.
That left only two experienced
members of what many call one of the
best Cardinal secondaries ever. Eric
Price was one. Hamilton the other.
Price started 10 of the 11 games this

season. Hamilton played a total of
eight downs, and no passes were com
pleted against him.
"It just really shocked me to come
in this year thinking that I was going
to play and he an integral part of the
defense and not play, which I didn't
think was fair," he says.
Hamilton might not have minded
frequenting the sidelines so much had
this year's secondary been anywhere
near as successful as last year's. It
wasn't, though In one year, the
Cardinal went from first in the Pac-10
in pass defense to dead last. Granted,
Stanford's rushing defense improved
this year and forced teams to pass,
hut the Cardinal still gave up 227.2
yards per game through the air, 60
more than in 1983.
Hamilton's coach, Dick Mannini,
who doubles as defensive coordinator
and defensive backs coach, thinks he
gave his senior cornerback every
chance to help out.
"I don't feel he wasn't given the
opportunity," Mannini said. "He was.
He just didn't take advantage of it
when it was there. I'll put it this way
— the right to play has to be earned.
"No one owed him playing time or
a starting berth. The others surpassed
him. We thought we had two people
that worked a little harder and im
proved a little more than Dwain did."
But Hamilton's teammates beg to
differ, and one, running back Shaun
Avant, called Mannini "biased
against [Hamilton] because of his
size."
"He played last year and showed
he had the ability," Avant said. "This
year, they would list him as a second
team player and then move people in
front of him. He really didn't get a
chance to prove himself."
Defensive tackle Garin Veris said
he was "surprised" Hamilton did
more watching than playing this
season. "After seeing him last year
[in games], I thought he would be
playing more this year."
Mannini, in his first year at Stan
ford like the rest of Head Coach Jack
Elway's staff, said Hamilton had the
statistical — but not the physical —
credentials for the job. "He got every
opportunity to show that he could
play," Mannini said. "He doesn't
have any speed and he's not a very
physical player. I like the kid. There
were just a lot of things working
against him."
Not so, says Hamilton. He points
out that he ran a 9.7-second 100-yard
dash in high school and a 4.56 40-
yard dash his sophomore year here.
But last winter, Hamilton slowed to a

4.54 when, as he tells it.he slipped
while being timed. Later that year, he
clocked a 4.71 on a wet field. "On the
depth chart, however," Hamilton
said, "they put down the 4.84. which
is my slowest time. They didn't put
down my 4.71
And then there's Hamilton's size.
He's 5-9, well, with his shoes on. And
the press guide lists him at 162
pounds.
• | just think when he (Mannini)
came in. he had an idea of the type of
defensive back he wanted," Hamilton
says. " He likes big guys. That was just
not to mv advantage. It's unfortunate
for me.
"I'm not saying that he's wrong in
saying he wants big defensive backs,
but I just didn't think I should be held
back because of my size. From their
standpoint, they come in and here
they have a senior who is 165 pounds
and he ran a 4.84, slip or no slip. Ob
jectively looking at that, they say,
•Can this guy be of any service to us?
No, because he's too small and he's
too slow.' "
Because he was used early and in
frequently this season, Hamilton
could conceivably salvage a year of
eligibility and return next year as a
fifth-year senior. As he puts it, no
way. "I just don't want to go through
it again. I want to get on with some
other aspects of my life."
• • •
Hamilton came to Stanford a small
but highly recruited player from St.
Thomas Aquinas prep school in Ft.
Lauderdale, Fla. He arrived at
preseason camp in August of 1981,
when the Bay Area was conducting
aerial spraying to rid its trees of the
Mediterranean fruit fly. Immediately,
he was tagged with the nickname,
"Med Fly."
Hamilton didn't play much his
freshman year, except on special
teams. He was the guy who flew in
from the side on field goals and extra
points trying to block them.
Sophomore year, Hamilton was
moved to defensive back from wide
receiver, where he had spent most of
his time as a freshman. It was a posi
tion he had only played during the
second half of his senior year in high
school and one "I had to grow into."
The plan was to redshirt him and not
to rush the growing process.
Those plans suddenly changed in
the eighth game of the season against,
of all teams, undefeated and No.l
ranked University of Washington.
Starting right cornerback Price was
injured early in the game and his
backup, Rodney Gilmore, went down

early in the second half. Bang, Hamil
ton was making his collegiate debut at
cornerback.
"I had never played, and we are on
national TV against the No. 1 team in
the nation," he recalls. "Here I am
thrust into this situation, and 1 thought
I performed pretty well."
He did. Besides helping Stanford
pull off what is generally considered
the biggest Cardinal upset in the past
few decades, Hamilton even helped
force a fumble. "I held the tight end
up and then Garin (Veris) came and
finished him off and forced the
fumble."
Things got even brighter Hamil
ton's junior year, when Andy Chris
toff arrived on the scene as the new
defensive backs coach.
"The change was junior year, when

Christoff came and he took time with
me," Hamilton says."He told me
what I had to do to play. He was very
open and up front with me. Fie said.
'You have to be able to tackle and
cover. You can already cover very
well. All you have to do is be able to
tackle and you'll be able to play in
this league.'
"He told me what 1 had to do. I did
it and I played, and 1 played well.
Hamilton started two games
against San Jose State and the Uni
versity of Southern California — and
was the secondary's first-string
"nickel back" in obvious passing situ
ations. He had an interception against
Arizona State University and a nine
tackle game against the University of
Oregon and San Jose State.
"The minute the Cal game (the

Hamilton started twice at cornerback and had two nine-tackle games
during the 1983 season, but played eight downs this year.
season finale) was over, I was already
getting excited about next season he
cause I knew I'd he starting at oni of
the corners," he says. "But every
thing all of a sudden just changed."
Head Coach Paul Wiggin was
politely asked to resign hy Athletic
Director Andy Geiger near the end of
last season and hence the 1983 Big
Game was Wiggins last at Stanford.
It was also the last for Wiggin's staff,
and Christoff left to coach defense at
Notre Dame. Enter Jack Elway and a
new staff, one that included Mannini.
Exit Hamilton from the starting
lineup.
"That was like my freshman year,
essentially," Hamilton says of his
junior season. "And then this year
would be my second year and I
thought I could improve upon what I
did last year, and I thought I could
have done very well. As a matter of
fact, he (Christoff) told me I could
have been one of the best corners in
the conference, which I think is a
heck of a compliment playing in the
Pac-10."
When contacted at Notre Dame, a
reserved Christoff only would say,
"The only comment that I would like
to make is that Dwain and I had a
really good relationship. Whatever
has happened at Stanford has hap
pened."
For Hamilton, however, more has
happened to him than simply not
playing. He's gone through periods of
depression. His grades have slipped.
He even went on academic probation.
"It's depressing (not playing)," he
says."It affects your studies. You're
tired after practice and you go home
and have to study. It affects every
thing you do. It is very difficult to
separate your academic life from your
football life.
"I've been playing football since I
was seven, and if you've been playing
for two-thirds of your life, it's no
longer a game," he continues. "It's
like, as football goes, so goes life. It
shouldn't be that way, but then again
when you spend so much time doing

something like that, you become a
part of it and it becomes a part of you.
"It forced me to think about
academics a great deal more.
Honestly, when I came in here — I
think a lot of college players do — I
really wanted to go to the pros. I
came to play football and the
academics, I wouldn't call them a pe
ripheral, but a means to an end in a
sense."
Avant, one of his roommates for
the past two years, said Hamilton was
often depressed about not playing.
"He would spend most of his time in
his room," Avant said. "He just slept
all the time."
One thing Hamilton didn't do was
study, and now he needs to return for
a fifth year to finish his pre-medical
requirements. He plans to attend
either medical school — and follow in
the footsteps of his father, a surgeon
in Ft. Lauderdale — or music school.
Hamilton plays the drums and music,
he says, "is something that makes me
very happy. I love playing it."
Despite what happened on the
football field this year — or, in his
case, what didn't happen — Hamilton
doesn't regret his decision to attend
Stanford. "Outside of football, my
experience here has been a very good
one and a positive one," he says,
"because of the type of people that
are here. You just can't go to a better
place."
Hamilton also finds some good in
the bad times he went through during
the season. It's taken its toll on other
parts of his life, but as far as Hamil
ton's concerned, the end, if not here,
is near.
"It's like my father told me once,
'A character is forged in the crucible
of pain,' which is true because I look
at it and it's made me a stronger per
son," he says. "I'll probably look
back on this, and I'll be happy I went
through it.
"Football has become a part of my
life — it is a part of my life. And right
now I'm in transition from that being
a major part of my life to something I
do on Saturday and Sunday after

noons watching on TV. It's just a part
of growing up, part of the maturation
process you have to go through. It's
painful, but it will pay dividends in
the end."
Hamilton has learned a lot since
coming to Stanford as an innocent
freshman. And it was that year he ad
mittedly learned the hard way more

There are stories of how Hamilton
talked a friend into lending him his
car, convincing him he knew how to
drive a manual transmission. It wasn't

that his friend realized Hamilton was

There's also the time Hamilton
went to the Cameo Club, a place just
south of campus where playing low
ball poker for money is legal. Hamil
ton claimed he knew how to play, but
when he unknowingly won a hand,
the dealer had to explain to him that
the money in the middle of the table
was his.
And then there's the time Hamil
ton went to an off-campus party and
met a girl who was a parapsy
chologist. "She was weird, she was
wild," he recalls. "She started talking
about ghosts and spirits and every

tired after practice and you go home
and have to study. It affects every
thing you do. It is very difficult to
separate your academic life from your
football life.
"I've been playing football since I
was seven, and if you've been playing
for two-thirds of your life, it's no
longer a game," he continues. "It's
like, as football goes, so goes life. It
shouldn't be that way, but then again
when you spend so much time doing

something like that, you become a
part of it and it becomes a part of you.
"It forced me to think about
academics a great deal more.
Honestly, when I came in here — I
think a lot of college players do — I
really wanted to go to the pros. I
came to play football and the
academics, I wouldn't call them a pe
ripheral, but a means to an end in a
sense."
Avant, one of his roommates for
the past two years, said Hamilton was
often depressed about not playing.
"He would spend most of his time in
his room," Avant said. "He just slept
all the time."
One thing Hamilton didn't do was
study, and now he needs to return for
a fifth year to finish his pre-medical
requirements. He plans to attend
either medical school — and follow in
the footsteps of his father, a surgeon
in Ft. Lauderdale — or music school.
Hamilton plays the drums and music,
he says, "is something that makes me
very happy. I love playing it."
Despite what happened on the
football field this year — or, in his
case, what didn't happen — Hamilton
doesn't regret his decision to attend
Stanford. "Outside of football, my
experience here has been a very good
one and a positive one," he says,
"because of the type of people that
are here. You just can't go to a better
place."
Hamilton also finds some good in
the bad times he went through during
the season. It's taken its toll on other
parts of his life, but as far as Hamil
ton's concerned, the end, if not here,
is near.
"It's like my father told me once,
'A character is forged in the crucible
of pain,' which is true because I look
at it and it's made me a stronger per
son," he says. "I'll probably look
back on this, and I'll be happy I went
through it.
"Football has become a part of my
life — it is a part of my life. And right
now I'm in transition from that being
a major part of my life to something I
do on Saturday and Sunday after

noons watching on TV. It's just a part
of growing up, part of the maturation
process you have to go through. It's
painful, but it will pay dividends in
the end."
Hamilton has learned a lot since
coming to Stanford as an innocent
freshman. And it was that year he ad
mittedly learned the hard way more
often than not.
There are stories of how Hamilton
talked a friend into lending him his
car, convincing him he knew how to
drive a manual transmission. It wasn't
until Hamilton lurched down the
street and stalled at the first stop sign
that his friend realized Hamilton was
learning how then.
There's also the time Hamilton
went to the Cameo Club, a place just
south of campus where playing low
ball poker for money is legal. Hamil
ton claimed he knew how to play, but
when he unknowingly won a hand,
the dealer had to explain to him that
the money in the middle of the table
was his.
And then there's the time Hamil
ton went to an off-campus party and
met a girl who was a parapsy
chologist. "She was weird, she was
wild," he recalls. "She started talking
about ghosts and spirits and every
thing, and I said, 'Well, maybe I bet
ter go ask somebody else to dance.
Thank you.' She was like Elvira, the
mistress of the night. I just wanted to
get the hell away from her and hope
she didn't get mad at me and put
some spell on me or something."
But, as Hamilton says, it wasn't un
til his senior year that he learned the
most about himself. Like his fresh
man year, he learned the hard way.
Only this time it was more painful.
"It's helped me discover other
parts of my personality and other
ways I can become a full person." he
says. "It's almost like you feel like
you're less of a person because you're
not playing football. And that's
wrong. Football is just one hat that
you put on."
But one hat that will stay in Hamil
ton's closet. Forever.
It was early Friday morning at
San Fi'ancisco International Air
port and the Stanford football team
was preparing to board its Con
tinental Airlines charter flight to
Oklahoma City. Stanford would
open the 1984 season against the
University of Oklahoma the next
day.
Since it was a charter flight, the
team did not bother issuing board
ing passes. Instead, a stewardess at
the gate asked players for their
names and checked them off a com
puter list as they boarded the plane.
Dwain Hamilton, a senior cor
nerback, took his place in line and
eventually reached the stewardess.
Hamilton, all 5-foot-9 and 162
pounds of him, stepped up and with
his best poker face, said, "Dorsett.
Tony."
The stewardess went up and
down the list looking for the name

of the Dallas Cowboys' running
back before Hamilton corrected
her with his true name and one of
his toothy smiles.
Besides being one of the Card
inal's smallest players, Hamilton is
considered, as Stanford's press
euide states, "one of the more
popular players." His teammates

describe him as an easy-going, fun
loving person with a sense of humor
to match.
That's all good and well as far as
Hamilton's concerned, but there's
still one problem. A big problem.
He didn't play this season. And
while the seasons of 15 other
seniors ended Saturday with a 27-
10 Big Game victory, Hamilton's
might as well have ended before it
began.
Plainly and simply, Hamilton
thinks he got a raw deal.
"You get a fair number of repeti
tions in practice, but that does not
guarantee a fair evaluation," he
said on the eve of his final game as
a Cardinal. "And being frank and
honest, I don't think 1 was given a
fair evaluation."
But there's a hitch to all this.
Hamilton's beef isn't your typical
case of sour grapes.


Dwain Hamilton
"There are obviously going to be
people who are upset that they're not
playing," he says. "But some of those
people who are upset just do not have
it. I know — I have already proven
myself — that I have the ability to
plav. I did it last year.
"It's not like I've never played and
I'm bitching about it. I have already
proven myself and I wouldn't have
anything to stand on if I hadn't."
Not only did Hamilton play last
season, logging 147 minutes in all 11
games, he started twice. He finished
the season 1 Ith on the team in total
tackles with 45 and eighth in solo
tackles with 31. He also had an inter

ception. And this was on a Cardinal
defensive secondary that was statisti
cally the best in the Pacific 10 Con
ference. holding its opponents to
167.2 yards passing per game.
But it was also a secondary hit hard
by graduation. Three players, corner
back Kevin Baird and safeties
Vaughn Williams and Charles Hutch
ings, graduated last spring. A fourth.
Darrell Grissum, decided not to
return this season after seriously in
juring his back in the 1983 Big Game.
That left only two experienced
members of what many call one of the
best Cardinal secondaries ever. Eric
Price was one. Hamilton the other.
Price started 10 of the 11 games this

season. Hamilton played a total of
eight downs, and no passes were com
pleted against him.
"It just really shocked me to come
in this year thinking that I was going
to play and he an integral part of the
defense and not play, which I didn't
think was fair," he says.
Hamilton might not have minded
frequenting the sidelines so much had
this year's secondary been anywhere
near as successful as last year's. It
wasn't, though In one year, the
Cardinal went from first in the Pac-10
in pass defense to dead last. Granted,
Stanford's rushing defense improved
this year and forced teams to pass,
hut the Cardinal still gave up 227.2
yards per game through the air, 60
more than in 1983.
Hamilton's coach, Dick Mannini,
who doubles as defensive coordinator
and defensive backs coach, thinks he
gave his senior cornerback every
chance to help out.
"I don't feel he wasn't given the
opportunity," Mannini said. "He was.
He just didn't take advantage of it
when it was there. I'll put it this way
— the right to play has to be earned.
"No one owed him playing time or
a starting berth. The others surpassed
him. We thought we had two people
that worked a little harder and im
proved a little more than Dwain did."
But Hamilton's teammates beg to
differ, and one, running back Shaun
Avant, called Mannini "biased
against [Hamilton] because of his
size."
"He played last year and showed
he had the ability," Avant said. "This
year, they would list him as a second
team player and then move people in
front of him. He really didn't get a
chance to prove himself."
Defensive tackle Garin Veris said
he was "surprised" Hamilton did
more watching than playing this
season. "After seeing him last year
[in games], I thought he would be
playing more this year."
Mannini, in his first year at Stan
ford like the rest of Head Coach Jack
Elway's staff, said Hamilton had the
statistical — but not the physical —
credentials for the job. "He got every
opportunity to show that he could
play," Mannini said. "He doesn't
have any speed and he's not a very
physical player. I like the kid. There
were just a lot of things working
against him."
Not so, says Hamilton. He points
out that he ran a 9.7-second 100-yard
dash in high school and a 4.56 40-
yard dash his sophomore year here.
But last winter, Hamilton slowed to a

4.54 when, as he tells it.he slipped
while being timed. Later that year, he
clocked a 4.71 on a wet field. "On the
depth chart, however," Hamilton
said, "they put down the 4.84. which
is my slowest time. They didn't put
down my 4.71
And then there's Hamilton's size.
He's 5-9, well, with his shoes on. And
the press guide lists him at 162
pounds.
• | just think when he (Mannini)
came in. he had an idea of the type of
defensive back he wanted," Hamilton
says. " He likes big guys. That was just
not to mv advantage. It's unfortunate
for me.
"I'm not saying that he's wrong in
saying he wants big defensive backs,
but I just didn't think I should be held
back because of my size. From their
standpoint, they come in and here
they have a senior who is 165 pounds
and he ran a 4.84, slip or no slip. Ob
jectively looking at that, they say,
•Can this guy be of any service to us?
No, because he's too small and he's
too slow.' "
Because he was used early and in
frequently this season, Hamilton
could conceivably salvage a year of
eligibility and return next year as a
fifth-year senior. As he puts it, no
way. "I just don't want to go through
it again. I want to get on with some
other aspects of my life."
• • •
Hamilton came to Stanford a small
but highly recruited player from St.
Thomas Aquinas prep school in Ft.
Lauderdale, Fla. He arrived at
preseason camp in August of 1981,
when the Bay Area was conducting
aerial spraying to rid its trees of the
Mediterranean fruit fly. Immediately,
he was tagged with the nickname,
"Med Fly."
Hamilton didn't play much his
freshman year, except on special
teams. He was the guy who flew in
from the side on field goals and extra
points trying to block them.
Sophomore year, Hamilton was
moved to defensive back from wide
receiver, where he had spent most of
his time as a freshman. It was a posi
tion he had only played during the
second half of his senior year in high
school and one "I had to grow into."
The plan was to redshirt him and not
to rush the growing process.
Those plans suddenly changed in
the eighth game of the season against,
of all teams, undefeated and No.l
ranked University of Washington.
Starting right cornerback Price was
injured early in the game and his
backup, Rodney Gilmore, went down

early in the second half. Bang, Hamil
ton was making his collegiate debut at
cornerback.
"I had never played, and we are on
national TV against the No. 1 team in
the nation," he recalls. "Here I am
thrust into this situation, and 1 thought
I performed pretty well."
He did. Besides helping Stanford
pull off what is generally considered
the biggest Cardinal upset in the past
few decades, Hamilton even helped
force a fumble. "I held the tight end
up and then Garin (Veris) came and
finished him off and forced the
fumble."
Things got even brighter Hamil
ton's junior year, when Andy Chris
toff arrived on the scene as the new
defensive backs coach.
"The change was junior year, when

Christoff came and he took time with
me," Hamilton says."He told me
what I had to do to play. He was very
open and up front with me. Fie said.
'You have to be able to tackle and
cover. You can already cover very
well. All you have to do is be able to
tackle and you'll be able to play in
this league.'
"He told me what 1 had to do. I did
it and I played, and 1 played well.
Hamilton started two games
against San Jose State and the Uni
versity of Southern California — and
was the secondary's first-string
"nickel back" in obvious passing situ
ations. He had an interception against
Arizona State University and a nine
tackle game against the University of
Oregon and San Jose State.
"The minute the Cal game (the

during the 1983 season, but played eight downs this year.
season finale) was over, I was already
getting excited about next season he
cause I knew I'd he starting at oni of
the corners," he says. "But every
thing all of a sudden just changed."
Head Coach Paul Wiggin was
politely asked to resign hy Athletic
Director Andy Geiger near the end of
last season and hence the 1983 Big
Game was Wiggins last at Stanford.
It was also the last for Wiggin's staff,
and Christoff left to coach defense at
Notre Dame. Enter Jack Elway and a
new staff, one that included Mannini.
Exit Hamilton from the starting
lineup.
"That was like my freshman year,
essentially," Hamilton says of his
junior season. "And then this year
would be my second year and I
thought I could improve upon what I
did last year, and I thought I could
have done very well. As a matter of
fact, he (Christoff) told me I could
have been one of the best corners in
the conference, which I think is a
heck of a compliment playing in the
Pac-10."
When contacted at Notre Dame, a
reserved Christoff only would say,
"The only comment that I would like
to make is that Dwain and I had a
really good relationship. Whatever
has happened at Stanford has hap
pened."
For Hamilton, however, more has
happened to him than simply not
playing. He's gone through periods of
depression. His grades have slipped.
He even went on academic probation.
"It's depressing (not playing)," he
says."It affects your studies. You're
tired after practice and you go home
and have to study. It affects every
thing you do. It is very difficult to
separate your academic life from your
football life.
"I've been playing football since I
was seven, and if you've been playing
for two-thirds of your life, it's no
longer a game," he continues. "It's
like, as football goes, so goes life. It
shouldn't be that way, but then again
when you spend so much time doing

something like that, you become a
part of it and it becomes a part of you.
"It forced me to think about
academics a great deal more.
Honestly, when I came in here — I
think a lot of college players do — I
really wanted to go to the pros. I
came to play football and the
academics, I wouldn't call them a pe
ripheral, but a means to an end in a
sense."
Avant, one of his roommates for
the past two years, said Hamilton was
often depressed about not playing.
"He would spend most of his time in
his room," Avant said. "He just slept
all the time."
One thing Hamilton didn't do was
study, and now he needs to return for
a fifth year to finish his pre-medical
requirements. He plans to attend
either medical school — and follow in
the footsteps of his father, a surgeon
in Ft. Lauderdale — or music school.
Hamilton plays the drums and music,
he says, "is something that makes me
very happy. I love playing it."

football field this year — or, in his
case, what didn't happen — Hamilton
doesn't regret his decision to attend

parts of his life, but as far as Hamil

season finale) was over, I was already
getting excited about next season he
cause I knew I'd he starting at oni of
the corners," he says. "But every
thing all of a sudden just changed."
Head Coach Paul Wiggin was
politely asked to resign hy Athletic
Director Andy Geiger near the end of
last season and hence the 1983 Big
Game was Wiggins last at Stanford.
It was also the last for Wiggin's staff,
and Christoff left to coach defense at
Notre Dame. Enter Jack Elway and a
new staff, one that included Mannini.
Exit Hamilton from the starting
lineup.
"That was like my freshman year,
essentially," Hamilton says of his
junior season. "And then this year
would be my second year and I
thought I could improve upon what I
did last year, and I thought I could
have done very well. As a matter of
fact, he (Christoff) told me I could
have been one of the best corners in
the conference, which I think is a
heck of a compliment playing in the
Pac-10."
When contacted at Notre Dame, a
reserved Christoff only would say,
"The only comment that I would like
to make is that Dwain and I had a
really good relationship. Whatever
has happened at Stanford has hap
pened."
For Hamilton, however, more has
happened to him than simply not
playing. He's gone through periods of
depression. His grades have slipped.
He even went on academic probation.
"It's depressing (not playing)," he
says."It affects your studies. You're
tired after practice and you go home
and have to study. It affects every
thing you do. It is very difficult to
separate your academic life from your
football life.
"I've been playing football since I
was seven, and if you've been playing
for two-thirds of your life, it's no
longer a game," he continues. "It's
like, as football goes, so goes life. It
shouldn't be that way, but then again
when you spend so much time doing

something like that, you become a
part of it and it becomes a part of you.
"It forced me to think about
academics a great deal more.
Honestly, when I came in here — I
think a lot of college players do — I
really wanted to go to the pros. I
came to play football and the
academics, I wouldn't call them a pe
ripheral, but a means to an end in a
sense."
Avant, one of his roommates for
the past two years, said Hamilton was
often depressed about not playing.
"He would spend most of his time in
his room," Avant said. "He just slept
all the time."
One thing Hamilton didn't do was
study, and now he needs to return for
a fifth year to finish his pre-medical
requirements. He plans to attend
either medical school — and follow in
the footsteps of his father, a surgeon
in Ft. Lauderdale — or music school.
Hamilton plays the drums and music,
he says, "is something that makes me
very happy. I love playing it."
Despite what happened on the
football field this year — or, in his
case, what didn't happen — Hamilton
doesn't regret his decision to attend
Stanford. "Outside of football, my
experience here has been a very good
one and a positive one," he says,
"because of the type of people that
are here. You just can't go to a better
place."
Hamilton also finds some good in
the bad times he went through during
the season. It's taken its toll on other
parts of his life, but as far as Hamil
ton's concerned, the end, if not here,
is near.
"It's like my father told me once,
'A character is forged in the crucible
of pain,' which is true because I look
at it and it's made me a stronger per
son," he says. "I'll probably look
back on this, and I'll be happy I went
through it.
"Football has become a part of my
life — it is a part of my life. And right
now I'm in transition from that being
a major part of my life to something I
do on Saturday and Sunday after

noons watching on TV. It's just a part
of growing up, part of the maturation
process you have to go through. It's
painful, but it will pay dividends in
the end."
Hamilton has learned a lot since
coming to Stanford as an innocent
freshman. And it was that year he ad
mittedly learned the hard way more
often than not.
There are stories of how Hamilton
talked a friend into lending him his
car, convincing him he knew how to
drive a manual transmission. It wasn't
until Hamilton lurched down the
street and stalled at the first stop sign
that his friend realized Hamilton was
learning how then.
There's also the time Hamilton
went to the Cameo Club, a place just
south of campus where playing low
ball poker for money is legal. Hamil
ton claimed he knew how to play, but
when he unknowingly won a hand,
the dealer had to explain to him that
the money in the middle of the table
was his.
And then there's the time Hamil
ton went to an off-campus party and
met a girl who was a parapsy
chologist. "She was weird, she was
wild," he recalls. "She started talking
about ghosts and spirits and every
thing, and I said, 'Well, maybe I bet
ter go ask somebody else to dance.
Thank you.' She was like Elvira, the
mistress of the night. I just wanted to
get the hell away from her and hope
she didn't get mad at me and put
some spell on me or something."
But, as Hamilton says, it wasn't un
til his senior year that he learned the
most about himself. Like his fresh
man year, he learned the hard way.
Only this time it was more painful.
"It's helped me discover other
parts of my personality and other
ways I can become a full person." he
says. "It's almost like you feel like
you're less of a person because you're
not playing football. And that's
wrong. Football is just one hat that
you put on."
But one hat that will stay in Hamil
ton's closet. Forever.
It was early Friday morning at
San Fi'ancisco International Air
port and the Stanford football team
was preparing to board its Con
tinental Airlines charter flight to
Oklahoma City. Stanford would
open the 1984 season against the
University of Oklahoma the next
day.
Since it was a charter flight, the
team did not bother issuing board
ing passes. Instead, a stewardess at
the gate asked players for their
names and checked them off a com
puter list as they boarded the plane.
Dwain Hamilton, a senior cor
nerback, took his place in line and
eventually reached the stewardess.
Hamilton, all 5-foot-9 and 162
pounds of him, stepped up and with
his best poker face, said, "Dorsett.
Tony."
The stewardess went up and
down the list looking for the name

of the Dallas Cowboys' running
back before Hamilton corrected
her with his true name and one of
his toothy smiles.
Besides being one of the Card
inal's smallest players, Hamilton is
considered, as Stanford's press
euide states, "one of the more
popular players." His teammates

describe him as an easy-going, fun
loving person with a sense of humor
to match.
That's all good and well as far as
Hamilton's concerned, but there's
still one problem. A big problem.
He didn't play this season. And
while the seasons of 15 other
seniors ended Saturday with a 27-
10 Big Game victory, Hamilton's
might as well have ended before it
began.
Plainly and simply, Hamilton
thinks he got a raw deal.
"You get a fair number of repeti
tions in practice, but that does not
guarantee a fair evaluation," he
said on the eve of his final game as
a Cardinal. "And being frank and
honest, I don't think 1 was given a
fair evaluation."
But there's a hitch to all this.
Hamilton's beef isn't your typical
case of sour grapes.


Dwain Hamilton
"There are obviously going to be
people who are upset that they're not
playing," he says. "But some of those
people who are upset just do not have
it. I know — I have already proven
myself — that I have the ability to
plav. I did it last year.
"It's not like I've never played and
I'm bitching about it. I have already
proven myself and I wouldn't have
anything to stand on if I hadn't."
Not only did Hamilton play last
season, logging 147 minutes in all 11
games, he started twice. He finished
the season 1 Ith on the team in total
tackles with 45 and eighth in solo
tackles with 31. He also had an inter

ception. And this was on a Cardinal
defensive secondary that was statisti
cally the best in the Pacific 10 Con
ference. holding its opponents to
167.2 yards passing per game.
But it was also a secondary hit hard
by graduation. Three players, corner
back Kevin Baird and safeties
Vaughn Williams and Charles Hutch
ings, graduated last spring. A fourth.
Darrell Grissum, decided not to
return this season after seriously in
juring his back in the 1983 Big Game.
That left only two experienced
members of what many call one of the
best Cardinal secondaries ever. Eric
Price was one. Hamilton the other.
Price started 10 of the 11 games this

season. Hamilton played a total of
eight downs, and no passes were com
pleted against him.
"It just really shocked me to come
in this year thinking that I was going
to play and he an integral part of the
defense and not play, which I didn't
think was fair," he says.
Hamilton might not have minded
frequenting the sidelines so much had
this year's secondary been anywhere
near as successful as last year's. It
wasn't, though In one year, the
Cardinal went from first in the Pac-10
in pass defense to dead last. Granted,
Stanford's rushing defense improved
this year and forced teams to pass,
hut the Cardinal still gave up 227.2
yards per game through the air, 60
more than in 1983.
Hamilton's coach, Dick Mannini,
who doubles as defensive coordinator
and defensive backs coach, thinks he
gave his senior cornerback every
chance to help out.
"I don't feel he wasn't given the
opportunity," Mannini said. "He was.
He just didn't take advantage of it
when it was there. I'll put it this way
— the right to play has to be earned.
"No one owed him playing time or
a starting berth. The others surpassed
him. We thought we had two people
that worked a little harder and im
proved a little more than Dwain did."
But Hamilton's teammates beg to
differ, and one, running back Shaun
Avant, called Mannini "biased
against [Hamilton] because of his
size."
"He played last year and showed
he had the ability," Avant said. "This
year, they would list him as a second
team player and then move people in
front of him. He really didn't get a
chance to prove himself."
Defensive tackle Garin Veris said
he was "surprised" Hamilton did
more watching than playing this
season. "After seeing him last year
[in games], I thought he would be
playing more this year."
Mannini, in his first year at Stan
ford like the rest of Head Coach Jack
Elway's staff, said Hamilton had the
statistical — but not the physical —
credentials for the job. "He got every
opportunity to show that he could
play," Mannini said. "He doesn't
have any speed and he's not a very
physical player. I like the kid. There
were just a lot of things working
against him."
Not so, says Hamilton. He points
out that he ran a 9.7-second 100-yard
dash in high school and a 4.56 40-
yard dash his sophomore year here.
But last winter, Hamilton slowed to a

4.54 when, as he tells it.he slipped
while being timed. Later that year, he
clocked a 4.71 on a wet field. "On the
depth chart, however," Hamilton
said, "they put down the 4.84. which
is my slowest time. They didn't put
down my 4.71
And then there's Hamilton's size.
He's 5-9, well, with his shoes on. And
the press guide lists him at 162
pounds.
• | just think when he (Mannini)
came in. he had an idea of the type of
defensive back he wanted," Hamilton
says. " He likes big guys. That was just
not to mv advantage. It's unfortunate
for me.
"I'm not saying that he's wrong in
saying he wants big defensive backs,
but I just didn't think I should be held
back because of my size. From their
standpoint, they come in and here
they have a senior who is 165 pounds
and he ran a 4.84, slip or no slip. Ob
jectively looking at that, they say,
•Can this guy be of any service to us?
No, because he's too small and he's
too slow.' "
Because he was used early and in
frequently this season, Hamilton
could conceivably salvage a year of
eligibility and return next year as a
fifth-year senior. As he puts it, no
way. "I just don't want to go through
it again. I want to get on with some
other aspects of my life."
• • •
Hamilton came to Stanford a small
but highly recruited player from St.
Thomas Aquinas prep school in Ft.
Lauderdale, Fla. He arrived at
preseason camp in August of 1981,
when the Bay Area was conducting
aerial spraying to rid its trees of the
Mediterranean fruit fly. Immediately,
he was tagged with the nickname,
"Med Fly."
Hamilton didn't play much his
freshman year, except on special
teams. He was the guy who flew in
from the side on field goals and extra
points trying to block them.
Sophomore year, Hamilton was
moved to defensive back from wide
receiver, where he had spent most of
his time as a freshman. It was a posi
tion he had only played during the
second half of his senior year in high
school and one "I had to grow into."
The plan was to redshirt him and not
to rush the growing process.
Those plans suddenly changed in
the eighth game of the season against,
of all teams, undefeated and No.l
ranked University of Washington.
Starting right cornerback Price was
injured early in the game and his
backup, Rodney Gilmore, went down

early in the second half. Bang, Hamil
ton was making his collegiate debut at
cornerback.
"I had never played, and we are on
national TV against the No. 1 team in
the nation," he recalls. "Here I am
thrust into this situation, and 1 thought
I performed pretty well."
He did. Besides helping Stanford
pull off what is generally considered
the biggest Cardinal upset in the past
few decades, Hamilton even helped
force a fumble. "I held the tight end
up and then Garin (Veris) came and
finished him off and forced the
fumble."
Things got even brighter Hamil
ton's junior year, when Andy Chris
toff arrived on the scene as the new
defensive backs coach.
"The change was junior year, when

Christoff came and he took time with
me," Hamilton says."He told me
what I had to do to play. He was very
open and up front with me. Fie said.
'You have to be able to tackle and
cover. You can already cover very
well. All you have to do is be able to
tackle and you'll be able to play in
this league.'
"He told me what 1 had to do. I did
it and I played, and 1 played well.
Hamilton started two games
against San Jose State and the Uni
versity of Southern California — and
was the secondary's first-string
"nickel back" in obvious passing situ
ations. He had an interception against
Arizona State University and a nine
tackle game against the University of
Oregon and San Jose State.

eligibility and return next year as a
fifth-year senior. As he puts it, no
way. "I just don't want to go through
it again. I want to get on with some
other aspects of my life."

Hamilton came to Stanford a small
but highly recruited player from St.
Thomas Aquinas prep school in Ft.
Lauderdale, Fla. He arrived at
preseason camp in August of 1981,
when the Bay Area was conducting
aerial spraying to rid its trees of the
Mediterranean fruit fly. Immediately,
he was tagged with the nickname,
"Med Fly."
Hamilton didn't play much his
freshman year, except on special
teams. He was the guy who flew in
from the side on field goals and extra
points trying to block them.
Sophomore year, Hamilton was
moved to defensive back from wide
receiver, where he had spent most of
his time as a freshman. It was a posi
tion he had only played during the
second half of his senior year in high
school and one "I had to grow into."
The plan was to redshirt him and not
to rush the growing process.
Those plans suddenly changed in
the eighth game of the season against,
of all teams, undefeated and No.l
ranked University of Washington.
Starting right cornerback Price was
injured early in the game and his
backup, Rodney Gilmore, went down

early in the second half. Bang, Hamil
ton was making his collegiate debut at
cornerback.
"I had never played, and we are on
national TV against the No. 1 team in
the nation," he recalls. "Here I am
thrust into this situation, and 1 thought
I performed pretty well."
He did. Besides helping Stanford
pull off what is generally considered
the biggest Cardinal upset in the past
few decades, Hamilton even helped
force a fumble. "I held the tight end
up and then Garin (Veris) came and
finished him off and forced the
fumble."
Things got even brighter Hamil
ton's junior year, when Andy Chris
toff arrived on the scene as the new
defensive backs coach.
"The change was junior year, when

Christoff came and he took time with
me," Hamilton says."He told me
what I had to do to play. He was very
open and up front with me. Fie said.
'You have to be able to tackle and
cover. You can already cover very
well. All you have to do is be able to
tackle and you'll be able to play in
this league.'
"He told me what 1 had to do. I did
it and I played, and 1 played well.
Hamilton started two games
against San Jose State and the Uni
versity of Southern California — and
was the secondary's first-string
"nickel back" in obvious passing situ
ations. He had an interception against
Arizona State University and a nine
tackle game against the University of
Oregon and San Jose State.
"The minute the Cal game (the

Hamilton started twice at cornerback and had two nine-tackle games
during the 1983 season, but played eight downs this year.
season finale) was over, I was already
getting excited about next season he
cause I knew I'd he starting at oni of
the corners," he says. "But every
thing all of a sudden just changed."
Head Coach Paul Wiggin was
politely asked to resign hy Athletic
Director Andy Geiger near the end of
last season and hence the 1983 Big
Game was Wiggins last at Stanford.
It was also the last for Wiggin's staff,
and Christoff left to coach defense at
Notre Dame. Enter Jack Elway and a
new staff, one that included Mannini.
Exit Hamilton from the starting
lineup.
"That was like my freshman year,
essentially," Hamilton says of his
junior season. "And then this year
would be my second year and I
thought I could improve upon what I
did last year, and I thought I could
have done very well. As a matter of
fact, he (Christoff) told me I could
have been one of the best corners in
the conference, which I think is a
heck of a compliment playing in the
Pac-10."
When contacted at Notre Dame, a
reserved Christoff only would say,
"The only comment that I would like
to make is that Dwain and I had a
really good relationship. Whatever
has happened at Stanford has hap
pened."
For Hamilton, however, more has
happened to him than simply not
playing. He's gone through periods of
depression. His grades have slipped.
He even went on academic probation.
"It's depressing (not playing)," he
says."It affects your studies. You're
tired after practice and you go home
and have to study. It affects every
thing you do. It is very difficult to
separate your academic life from your
football life.
"I've been playing football since I
was seven, and if you've been playing
for two-thirds of your life, it's no
longer a game," he continues. "It's
like, as football goes, so goes life. It
shouldn't be that way, but then again
when you spend so much time doing

something like that, you become a
part of it and it becomes a part of you.
"It forced me to think about
academics a great deal more.
Honestly, when I came in here — I
think a lot of college players do — I
really wanted to go to the pros. I
came to play football and the
academics, I wouldn't call them a pe
ripheral, but a means to an end in a
sense."
Avant, one of his roommates for
the past two years, said Hamilton was
often depressed about not playing.
"He would spend most of his time in
his room," Avant said. "He just slept
all the time."
One thing Hamilton didn't do was
study, and now he needs to return for
a fifth year to finish his pre-medical
requirements. He plans to attend
either medical school — and follow in
the footsteps of his father, a surgeon
in Ft. Lauderdale — or music school.
Hamilton plays the drums and music,
he says, "is something that makes me
very happy. I love playing it."
Despite what happened on the
football field this year — or, in his
case, what didn't happen — Hamilton
doesn't regret his decision to attend
Stanford. "Outside of football, my
experience here has been a very good
one and a positive one," he says,
"because of the type of people that
are here. You just can't go to a better
place."
Hamilton also finds some good in
the bad times he went through during
the season. It's taken its toll on other
parts of his life, but as far as Hamil
ton's concerned, the end, if not here,
is near.
"It's like my father told me once,
'A character is forged in the crucible
of pain,' which is true because I look
at it and it's made me a stronger per
son," he says. "I'll probably look
back on this, and I'll be happy I went
through it.
"Football has become a part of my
life — it is a part of my life. And right
now I'm in transition from that being
a major part of my life to something I
do on Saturday and Sunday after

noons watching on TV. It's just a part
of growing up, part of the maturation
process you have to go through. It's
painful, but it will pay dividends in
the end."
Hamilton has learned a lot since
coming to Stanford as an innocent
freshman. And it was that year he ad
mittedly learned the hard way more
often than not.
There are stories of how Hamilton
talked a friend into lending him his
car, convincing him he knew how to
drive a manual transmission. It wasn't
until Hamilton lurched down the
street and stalled at the first stop sign
that his friend realized Hamilton was
learning how then.
There's also the time Hamilton
went to the Cameo Club, a place just
south of campus where playing low
ball poker for money is legal. Hamil
ton claimed he knew how to play, but
when he unknowingly won a hand,
the dealer had to explain to him that
the money in the middle of the table
was his.
And then there's the time Hamil
ton went to an off-campus party and
met a girl who was a parapsy
chologist. "She was weird, she was
wild," he recalls. "She started talking
about ghosts and spirits and every
thing, and I said, 'Well, maybe I bet
ter go ask somebody else to dance.
Thank you.' She was like Elvira, the
mistress of the night. I just wanted to
get the hell away from her and hope
she didn't get mad at me and put
some spell on me or something."
But, as Hamilton says, it wasn't un
til his senior year that he learned the
most about himself. Like his fresh
man year, he learned the hard way.
Only this time it was more painful.
"It's helped me discover other
parts of my personality and other
ways I can become a full person." he
says. "It's almost like you feel like
you're less of a person because you're
not playing football. And that's
wrong. Football is just one hat that
you put on."
But one hat that will stay in Hamil
ton's closet. Forever.
