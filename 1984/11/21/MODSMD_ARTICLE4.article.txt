# Hamilton looks back at a sour football season
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
It was early Friday morning at
San Fi'ancisco International Air
port and the Stanford football team
was preparing to board its Con
tinental Airlines charter flight to
Oklahoma City. Stanford would
open the 1984 season against the
University of Oklahoma the next
day.
Since it was a charter flight, the
team did not bother issuing board
ing passes. Instead, a stewardess at
the gate asked players for their
names and checked them off a com
puter list as they boarded the plane.
Dwain Hamilton, a senior cor
nerback, took his place in line and
eventually reached the stewardess.
Hamilton, all 5-foot-9 and 162
pounds of him, stepped up and with
his best poker face, said, "Dorsett.
Tony."
The stewardess went up and
down the list looking for the name

of the Dallas Cowboys' running
back before Hamilton corrected
her with his true name and one of
his toothy smiles.
Besides being one of the Card
inal's smallest players, Hamilton is
considered, as Stanford's press
euide states, "one of the more
popular players." His teammates

describe him as an easy-going, fun
loving person with a sense of humor
to match.
That's all good and well as far as
Hamilton's concerned, but there's
still one problem. A big problem.
He didn't play this season. And
while the seasons of 15 other
seniors ended Saturday with a 27-
10 Big Game victory, Hamilton's
might as well have ended before it
began.
Plainly and simply, Hamilton
thinks he got a raw deal.
"You get a fair number of repeti
tions in practice, but that does not
guarantee a fair evaluation," he
said on the eve of his final game as
a Cardinal. "And being frank and
honest, I don't think 1 was given a
fair evaluation."
But there's a hitch to all this.
Hamilton's beef isn't your typical
case of sour grapes.
