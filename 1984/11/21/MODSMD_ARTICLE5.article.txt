# Spock recalls protests

"Grades are an abomination," said Dr. Spock. He
paused. One person clapped.
"I hope 1 get a little more approval for my sneering at
grades," he said. Last night's Kresge Auditorium audi
ence of 75 burst into applause.
Dr. Benjamin Spock, 81, is the author of "Baby and
Child Care." With 28,000,000 copies sold, it is one of the
most succesful books of all time.
He has also been a political activist. In 1968 he was ar
rested for aiding resistance to the draft, convicted and
sentenced to two years in jail. The conviction was later
reversed.
He came to Stanford last night to speak about his life
and his political convictions. He is a tall, fit man who looks
like a cheery Lee Marvin.
A winner of a gold medal with the eight-man rowing
team in the 1924 Olympics, he still rows 10 miles a day
when he gets the chance. Next month he plans to go
sailing in the Virgin Islands.
Spock recalled when a "droll editor" from the then-newly
launched Pocket Books came to see him about writing a
guide to child care. " 'This doesn't have to be a very good
book,' " Spock recalled the editor saying. " 'At 25 cents a
copy it will sell 10,000 in a year.'
"It surprised Pocket Books, and it surprised me by sel
ling three-quarters of a million every year right from the
very beginning," Spock said.
He wrote "Baby and Child Care" in the evenings from
1943 to 1946. The book has been translated into 26 lan
guages. He is currently revising it.
Spock said he got interested in medicine when he spent
his summers in college working as a counselor in a
crippled children's home. "I had a major in English and
minored in history," he said. "Pre-medical students might

be interested in hearing that I got into medical school with
a 'C average."
He advised students planning to be doctors to "branch
out as an undergraduate. That's your last chance to get
any view of the outside world."
In medical school at Columbia, Spock studied pediatrics
and psychology — an unheard of combination in the mid
20s, he said. He came out in the midst of the Depression.
"It took me three years to earn enough money to pay for
my office rent, which was $130 a month," he recalled.
Spock attacked medical schools, saying they taught
about "substances and structures" instead of people.
"The student for two whole years not only doesn't see a
patient, he doesn't even hear o/ a patient," Spock said.
Spock has taught at the medical schools at the Univer
sity of Pittsburgh and Western Reserve University (now
Case Western Reserve) in Cleveland.
Spock began his political activism in 1964. Fearing that
Barry Goldwater might get America into a war, he cam
paigned for Lyndon Johnson. Two days after the election,
the president called him. " Dr. Spock, I hope I prove
worthy of your trust,' " Spock recalled Johnson saying.
Within months, Johnson began bombing North Viet
nam. That experience turned Spock against mainstream
politics. He said he has not supported a Democrat or Re
publican presidential candidate since then. Spock began
protesting the war, leading to his arrest.
After his conviction, Spock became a popular speaker
on the college-campus circuit. "It was quite heady stuff.
As a teacher in medical school I had never gotten a stand
ing applause," he said with a smile.
His political activism made him a more decisive person,
Spock said. "I used to be a very cautious person — very
solemn," he said. "Don't be afraid to form an opinion as a
citizen. Don't be afraid of what the president or anyone
says."
