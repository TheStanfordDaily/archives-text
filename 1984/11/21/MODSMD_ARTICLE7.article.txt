Civil Service changes expected
WASHINGTON — President Reagan's forthcoming budget is ex
pected to propose a major restructuring of the Civil Service retirement
system that would limit cost-of-living increases in benefits, reduce
benefits for those who retire before age 65 and increase the employee's
pension contribution from 7 percent to 9 percent of pay.
The changes are designed to save the government about $1.9 billion in
the first year alone.
The Civil Service plan is part of a series of proposals under considera
tion to reduce federal spending and cut the anticipated $206 billion
federal deficit for fiscal year 1986. Others involve reductions in farm
subsidies, restrictions on veterans' health benefits, cuts in federal grants
to the states and localities, and curbs on Medicare and Medicaid.
In California yesterday, a senior White House official said President
Reagan also may revive the idea of abolishing the Education Depart
ment.
The Civil Service retirement changes would affect about 1.9 million
retirees and dependents, including at least 70,000 in the Washington
area, plus future retirees. In fiscal year 1983, the system paid $20.3 bil
lion in benefits.
GNP grows less than predicted
WASHINGTON — The nation's economy slowed more rapidly in the
third quarter than previously thought, the Commerce Department said
yesterday, and economists saw little chance of a rebound to levels the
Reagan administration said would help reduce the huge looming budget
deficits.
The Commerce Department, which initially estimated that the
inflation-adjusted gross national product rose at a 3.6 percent annual
rate in the third quarter and later lowered that to 2.7 percent, said yes
terday the actual increase was only at a 1.9 percent rate. The economy
hasn't been that sluggish since the GNP grew at a 0.5 percent rate in the
fourth quarter of 1982.
Some economists, including an informal adviser to the president, said
there is no evidence — particularly in light of yesterday's report — that
the economy can pick up enough speed to reach the 4 percent growth
rate next year that the Reagan administration has forecast.
In addition, economists said that a weakening economy narrows the
policy choices available to the administration and Congress for dealing
with the large budget deficits because tax increases and spending cuts
tend to slow the economy even more.
However, the administration remained upbeat and said it expected a
rebound from a temporary lull sometime next year.
192 Polish tourists defect
BONN, West Germany — In one of the largest mass defections in
recent memory, 192 Polish tourists failed to return to a cruise ship fol
lowing a 3-day stopover in the northern port city of Hamburg, officials
there reported yesterday.
The Polish-owned ship "Stefan Batory" left Hamburg late Monday
for Rotterdam minus nearly a third of the original 608 passengers it ini
tially took on at the Polish seaport of Gdansk, the officials said.
The head of Hamburg's Resident Registration Office, Manfred Sorg,
said in a telephone interview yesterday evening that 107 of the pas
sengers had so far declared that they sought asylum at various police sta
tions in the city.
"The others have probably gone to relatives or friends elsewhere in
the country and will show up in the next day or two," Sorg said.
He said that the majority of the asylum-seekers appeared to be in
their late twenties to early forties. Several complete families were among
the refugees.
Interior Ministry officials in Bonn noted that under West German law,
asylum was granted routinely to any citizen of an East bloc country re
questing it.
"They can all stay if they want to," a government spokesman said.
Manhunt nabs 3,309 fugitives
NEW YORK — The largest and most successful manhunt for criminal
fugitives in American history — featuring undercover sting operations
and cooperation by 50 federal, state and local law-enforcement agencies
in eight Northeastern states — was announced yesterday by the U.S.
Marshals Service.
The two-month effort, completed Monday, led to the arrests of 3,309
fugitives on 5,080 outstanding felony warrants based on crimes including
murder, rape, robbery and narcotics and weapons violations.
Marshals Service Director Stanley Morris said the operation was
aimed at hard-core offenders and that there is an average of almost four
previous felony convictions for each apprehended fugitive.
"This represents the largest and most successful fugitive manhunt in
law-enforcement history," Attorney General William French Smith said
at a news conference here. "Today, Americans are significantly safer."
The program, the seventh large-scale fugitive operation run by the
marshals service in the last two-and-a-half years, represents "a vital part
of our expanded cooperative efforts" to fight "this cancer on American
society," Smith said.
Morris said many of the fugitives were on the loose because of lax bail
procedures in the courts, and he acknowledged that a number of the
newly arrested criminals may be released on bail despite their records. In
a similar fugitive sweep in California seven months ago, Morris said,
about half of those apprehended were later freed on bail.
Woman allegedly held for 7 years
RED BLUFF — A Red Bluff mill worker has been accused of picking
up a female hitchhiker in 1977, imprisoning her for seven years in home
built boxes, then freeing her this year so she could go look for a job,
police reported yesterday.
Cameron Hooker, 31, who lived in a small mobile home at the south
ern edge of town, was held in Tehama County Jail in lieu of $500,000
bail on more than two dozen charges, including rape, kidnapping,
sodomy, rape with a foreign object and oral copulation.
Hooker, accompanied by his attorney Rolland Papendick, pleaded in
nocent to the charges yesterday. A hearing was scheduled for Dec. 5 in
Red Bluff Justice Court.
Hooker was arrested Sunday, after the woman, 27, had returned to
her family and gone to authorities, police said.
Marcos denies rumors of his death
MANILA, Philippines — Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos
described as "an exaggeration" persistent reports of his death, the presi
dential palace announced yesterday.
In a terse, two-paragraph statement released by the palace. Marcos
said: "They are at it again. To the rumors and reports, I am tempted to
reply with Mark Twain's famous reaction to his reported demise.
"The report of my death is an exaggeration. We should not dignify
these rumors in any way but let's just say to our people that I am in good
health and I'm fully discharging the duties and responsibilities they have
generously reposed in me."
The statement comes amid uncertainty as to Marcos' whereabouts and
follows by a day a newspaper report by former Information Minister
Francisco Tatad that Marcos underwent major surgery last week.
Stocks first gain since election
NEW YORK — The stock market posted its first clear-cut gain since
the Nov. 6 election yesterday in the face of new signs of a slowing eco
nomy.
Analysts said declines in bond-market interest rates helped encourage
a technical rally in stock prices.
But they also noted that trading volume remained relatively subdued,
and that buying interest was concentrated in a small number of blue-chip
issues.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 58.86 points over the
last nine trading days, rose 9.83 to 1,195.12.
Today's weather
