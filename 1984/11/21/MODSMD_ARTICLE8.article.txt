# USSR shows desire for arms talks
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Soviet
Union has sent a message to the
United States that could establish the
basis for an early meeting between
Secretary of State George Shultz and
Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko for the purpose of restart
ing arms-control discussions, U.S.
sources said yesterday.
The Soviet message, delivered to
the State Department last Saturday,
was described as a tangible sign of
Moscow's willingness to meet on the
arms question. One official said what
remains is to establish the time and
place for a Gromyko-Shultz meeting,
which probably would be either in
Moscow or a neutral capital in West
ern Europe.
It was unclear to what extent the
Soviets explicitly accepted the U.S.
formula for "umbrella talks" over six
arms issues: strategic arms,
intermediate-range arms, weapons in
space, conventional forces in Europe,
confidence-building measures and
chemical weapons. One U.S. source
suggested that the question is largely

one of semantics, since the Soviets
have made known their willingness to
talk about a broad range of arms
questions at a Shultz-Gromyko ses
sion.
A Shultz-Gromyko meeting is
likely to be only a preliminary step
toward resumption of detailed U.S.-
Soviet negotiations. The two sides
continue to have different priorities,
with the Soviets most keenly inter
ested in averting military activities in
space and the United States mainly
interested in reducing existing offen
sive nuclear arsenals.
Moreover, the substantive posi
tions of Moscow and Washington
remain far apart on nearly all the
arms areas being mentioned for ex
ploration. Some of the most conten
tious issues are under dispute be
tween agencies and factions here.
A White House official said Presi
dent Reagan discussed arms control
in conversations last week with
Shultz, Secretary of Defense Caspar
Weinberger, CIA Director William
Casey and national security affairs

adviser Robert McFarlane, among
others. The conversations are re
ported to have resulted in an
"understanding" that Reagan and
Shultz will have to devote more of
their own time to the subject, which
Reagan has described as his top
foreign policy priority for his second
term.
Another result of the discussion,
sources said, is a consensus at top
levels that a "special envoy" or
"special coordinator" for arms con
trol will be named to assist Shultz if
across-the-board discussions with the
Soviets can be arranged.
State Department spokesman John
Hughes, while refusing to comment
on Saturday's message or other com
munications in confidential channels,
said, "We remain deeply interested in
improving our relations with the So
viet Union and resuming an arms
control dialogue."
He noted that Shultz, in an appear
ance Friday night on the NBC Nightly
News, said, "We're ready to sit down
and engage in real negotiations with

the Soviet Union on arms control and
seek concrete results and work out
problems." Shultz was responding to
written statements from Soviet Presi
dent konstantin Chernenko to NBC
News correspondent Marvin Kalb.
kalb, on Monday night, was the
first to report the delivery of Satur
day's message from the Soviets.
A senior State Department official
discouraged speculation that an early
summit meeting between Reagan and
Chernenko might result from a
Shultz-Gromyko exchange. Cher
nenko, in answers to questions from
kalb. said he did not believe that the
time was right for such a meeting.
At the Agriculture Department,
meanwhile, U.S. and Soviet officials
met to discuss U.S. grain supplies and
current Soviet needs under the five
year bilateral grain agreement signed
in 1983. The meetings with a visiting
Soviet grain delegation are to con
tinue today.
