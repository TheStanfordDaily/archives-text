# Death toll rises in Mexico blast
## 
### 
TLALNEPANTLA, Mexico — A blasted fuel
storage facility and crumbled homes in the sur
rounding neighborhood yielded more bodies yes
terday as Mexico City began to recover from the
explosions and fires that killed and injured
thousands of people Monday.
President Miguel de la Madrid declared at a cer
emony marking the 74th anniversary of the
Mexican Revolution that the entire nation was in
mourning over the tragedy that had engulfed the
neighborhood of San Juan Ixhuatepec in this sub
urban municipality just north of the capital.
By mid-afternoon, 293 corpses had been
delivered to a huge makeshift morgue in nearby
Santa Maria Tulpetlac and Red Cross officials said
the death toll was almost certain to increase.
"We understand there were 47 workers at the
Pemex installation when the explosions occurred,
and we don't know how many of them were able to
escape," said Tomas Gruner, a shift commander at
the Red Cross emergency center in Mexico City.
Pemex is the national petroleum company; Mon
day's blasts occurred at one of its liquefied-gas
storage and distribution centers.
Gruner estimated that the Red Cross had
transported 3,000 injured people to hospitals
throughout the metropolitan area in two days of
rescue operations.
The site of the destroyed Pemex facility was a
scene of total devastation Monday. Weary
policemen and rescue workers compared it to
ground zero of an atomic blast.
"There is nothing left," said Cecilio Sanchez, a
police officer with the municipal force of Tlal
nepantla as he surveyed the area and watched res
cue workers searching for remains, digging through
the ashes with their fingers. "They will never iden
tify some of these people," Sanchez said.
What had once been an administrative building

was reduced to smouldering ruin and charred and
twisted sheets of reinforced aluminum. Beneath
one oval-shaped piece of metal, the workers un
covered what appeared to be part of a human skull.
It crumbled to bits in their hands.
Fernando Rojas, a municipal official at the
morgue in Santa Maria Tulpetlac, estimated that
only 3 percent of the recovered corpses could be
identified.
J. M. Murillo, chief of the Tlalnepantla police
force, said that a preliminary survey of the neigh
borhood of San Juan Ixhuatepec, where many of
the dead and injured lived, found 137 homes
destroyed or heavily damaged.
The heart of the blast zone is about 250 yards
from the nearest houses. The Pemex facility covers
a rectangular area of about 50 acres bordered on
three sides by hills that are thought to have
confined and increased the impact of the detona
tions on San Juan Ixhuatepec.
Besides huge storage tanks for the liquid natural
gas, propane gas and other highly flammable
fuels that were received by underground pipelines
from throughout Mexico, the facility housed a large
pumping station and a fleet of tanker trucks.
Of the pumping station, practically nothing
escaped destruction except a few blackened above
ground pipelines. Some of the smaller fuel storage
tanks were left standing but most exploded, send
ing large and small pieces of metal flying through
the air at tremendous speed.
Nearby, to the east, a fuel distribution plant
belonging to UniGas, a privately owned company,
remained standing and appeared to be intact except
for some smoke and fire damage.
The area around the Pemex facility, which
supplies fuel for domestic consumption to most of
the 18 million residents of the Valley of Mexico, is
criss-crossed by a web of underground pipelines

that carry the various liquefied fuels.
Because of those pipes and the continuing fear of
more explosions, police ordered the evacuation of
about 500,000 residents in the zone, Murillo said.
The scope of the evacuation and relief effort was
enormous, and Red Cross spokesmen maintained
that the operation was proceeding as smoothly as
could be expected.
"The people of Mexico City have responded
magnanimously," said Gruner of the Red Cross.
He added that supplies of all necessities were being
distributed in ample quantity.
Nonetheless, some refugee shelters seemed short
of help, and radio stations continued to broadcast
appeals for clothes, food, blankets, baby diapers
and potable water.
The effort to determine exactly how many vic
tims the disaster claimed was complicated by the
large numbers involved. Gruner said that Red
Cross workers would compile a census of San Juan
Ixhuatepec and match the results against the num
ber of known survivors in an effort to find out ex
actly how many were dead and missing.
In addition to the 293 bodies at the emergency
morgue, the Red Cross said that it had received
reports that 17 injured persons had died in hospi
tals.
San Juan Ixhuatepec was home to an estimated
40,000 members of working-class families who
lived on what were once farm cooperatives, or
ejidos, that yielded to urban development more
than a decade ago.
The Pemex facility was built first and the resi
dential neighborhood grew up around it.
"That is very dangerous and should never, never
have been permitted," said Roberto Perez, an offi
cial with the state of Mexico's land title division.

only 3 percent of the recovered corpses could be
identified.
J. M. Murillo, chief of the Tlalnepantla police
force, said that a preliminary survey of the neigh
borhood of San Juan Ixhuatepec, where many of
the dead and injured lived, found 137 homes
destroyed or heavily damaged.
The heart of the blast zone is about 250 yards
from the nearest houses. The Pemex facility covers
a rectangular area of about 50 acres bordered on
three sides by hills that are thought to have
confined and increased the impact of the detona
tions on San Juan Ixhuatepec.
Besides huge storage tanks for the liquid natural
gas, propane gas and other highly flammable
fuels that were received by underground pipelines
from throughout Mexico, the facility housed a large
pumping station and a fleet of tanker trucks.
Of the pumping station, practically nothing
escaped destruction except a few blackened above
ground pipelines. Some of the smaller fuel storage
tanks were left standing but most exploded, send
ing large and small pieces of metal flying through
the air at tremendous speed.
Nearby, to the east, a fuel distribution plant
belonging to UniGas, a privately owned company,
remained standing and appeared to be intact except
for some smoke and fire damage.
The area around the Pemex facility, which
supplies fuel for domestic consumption to most of
the 18 million residents of the Valley of Mexico, is
criss-crossed by a web of underground pipelines

that carry the various liquefied fuels.
Because of those pipes and the continuing fear of
more explosions, police ordered the evacuation of
about 500,000 residents in the zone, Murillo said.
The scope of the evacuation and relief effort was
enormous, and Red Cross spokesmen maintained
that the operation was proceeding as smoothly as
could be expected.
"The people of Mexico City have responded
magnanimously," said Gruner of the Red Cross.
He added that supplies of all necessities were being
distributed in ample quantity.
Nonetheless, some refugee shelters seemed short
of help, and radio stations continued to broadcast
appeals for clothes, food, blankets, baby diapers
and potable water.
The effort to determine exactly how many vic
tims the disaster claimed was complicated by the
large numbers involved. Gruner said that Red
Cross workers would compile a census of San Juan
Ixhuatepec and match the results against the num
ber of known survivors in an effort to find out ex
actly how many were dead and missing.
In addition to the 293 bodies at the emergency
morgue, the Red Cross said that it had received
reports that 17 injured persons had died in hospi
tals.
San Juan Ixhuatepec was home to an estimated
40,000 members of working-class families who
lived on what were once farm cooperatives, or
ejidos, that yielded to urban development more
than a decade ago.
The Pemex facility was built first and the resi
dential neighborhood grew up around it.
"That is very dangerous and should never, never
have been permitted," said Roberto Perez, an offi
cial with the state of Mexico's land title division.

TLALNEPANTLA, Mexico — A blasted fuel
storage facility and crumbled homes in the sur
rounding neighborhood yielded more bodies yes
terday as Mexico City began to recover from the
explosions and fires that killed and injured
thousands of people Monday.
President Miguel de la Madrid declared at a cer
emony marking the 74th anniversary of the
Mexican Revolution that the entire nation was in
mourning over the tragedy that had engulfed the
neighborhood of San Juan Ixhuatepec in this sub
urban municipality just north of the capital.
By mid-afternoon, 293 corpses had been
delivered to a huge makeshift morgue in nearby
Santa Maria Tulpetlac and Red Cross officials said
the death toll was almost certain to increase.
"We understand there were 47 workers at the
Pemex installation when the explosions occurred,
and we don't know how many of them were able to
escape," said Tomas Gruner, a shift commander at
the Red Cross emergency center in Mexico City.
Pemex is the national petroleum company; Mon
day's blasts occurred at one of its liquefied-gas
storage and distribution centers.
Gruner estimated that the Red Cross had
transported 3,000 injured people to hospitals
throughout the metropolitan area in two days of
rescue operations.
The site of the destroyed Pemex facility was a
scene of total devastation Monday. Weary
policemen and rescue workers compared it to
ground zero of an atomic blast.
"There is nothing left," said Cecilio Sanchez, a
police officer with the municipal force of Tlal
nepantla as he surveyed the area and watched res
cue workers searching for remains, digging through
the ashes with their fingers. "They will never iden
tify some of these people," Sanchez said.
What had once been an administrative building

was reduced to smouldering ruin and charred and
twisted sheets of reinforced aluminum. Beneath
one oval-shaped piece of metal, the workers un
covered what appeared to be part of a human skull.
It crumbled to bits in their hands.

morgue in Santa Maria Tulpetlac, estimated that
