# Prof warns of risks in health care
## 
### CAMERON KALLER Staff writer 
Stanford Medical School Prof. Eugene Robin says that
medicine can cause diseases and harm or endanger the
lives of millions of patients.
"Anything in medicine has both risks and benefits,"
Robin said. "Along with the increase in the progress of
science and technology, the potential for medicine to do
both harm and good has also increased."
In his new book, "Matters of Life and Death: Risks vs.
Benefits in Medical Care," published by the Stanford
Alumni Association, Robin examines the deficiencies in
the present medical system.
A recent book review said of Robin's new work:
"The book is likely to be controversial because it
smashes some familiar idols — doctors, hospitals and the
medical education system. It challenges what its author
calls medicine's inflated estimate of its achievements, and
makes a compelling case for the re-evaluation of many
long-established practices."
Robin explains two different ways medicine can do
harm to masses of patients because of systematic errors
incorporated into medical practice.
"latro-genic (pronounced Yatro-genic) episodes are
accidents that happen to patients while being cared for,"
Robin said in an interview. "Many 'diseases' are caused
by doctors, but many are accidents. Many of these will
happen anyway, but we can cut down on the number."
"latroepidemics are plagues caused by doctors or
medicine when a systematic error is introduced and the
error results in harm or death to masses of patients,"
Robin said. "latroepidemics comes about when a test is
not well-tested or a form of treatment is introduced that
has not had adequate trial."
Robin emphasized that he is not "anti-doctor." "I'm
proud of being a doctor. I would simply like to help find
ways for medicine to help patients more and to be more
responsive. I expect to be strongly criticized, and I think
that is healthy, especially if it is promoting discussion of
these matters."
Medical risks today could be reduced if doctors were to
receive better training, according to Robin. "Many risky,
irrelevant studies which are routinely performed on
patients happen not because doctors are acting irrespon
sibly, but because their training is deficient to begin with.
"If 25 to 30 percent of the medical curriculum was
devoted to teaching the limitations of medicine, making
students understand how little we really know, how to
better involve patients in the process of their own care and
how to recognize iatro-genic episodes and how they might
be prevented, we could then raise a generation of doctors
who would be more closely allied to their patients and
who understood better the risks as well as the benefits in
medicine," Robin said.
Robin stressed that most of these methods are not cur
rently taught.
He said Stanford has particular problems in that its
levels of clinical teaching and excellence have been ques
tioned.
"It would be great for us to turn out innovative means
for turning out more responsive doctors," Robin said,
"but we don't want to imitate others. We should find a
way of taking a leadership role in turning out a better
group of doctors."
Robin added that while we wait for these problems to
be addressed, it is important for patients themselves to
take a more active role in their medical treatment.
"Patients and doctors are partners in an enterprise in
which the patient has the most at stake. Passivity can be
bad for the outcome to the disease."
The evolution of medicine as a field
of service into one of business is an
other concern of the author.
"Doctors and hospitals are increas
ingly being converted into a business
for turning a profit," Robin said.
"This approach leads to a number of
abuses of the patients."
The introduction of costly— rather
than efficient — technology because
of higher profit returns and methods
of treatment that prolong patients'
stays in hospitals are causes for ag
gravation.
Entrepreneurial approaches tend
to increase the risk to patients, Robin
said. "When doctors are out to make
a profit, they do many more tests than
are necessary. Each test has risks, and
if too many tests are done, some will
turn out to be 'false-positives,' result
ing in patients being harmed."
There are those who feel that if the
amount of economic gains was cut in
the medical field, the care would
become better.
"Some things in medicine,
however, are understandably expen
sive, but they should still be available
to patients," Robin said. "I anticipate
that if the present trend toward eco
nomic gain continues, that the status
doctors currently enjoy will be greatly
lowered."
Criticisms that Robin said have

been leveled against his book are that
his analysis is simplistic, that it is not a
proper characterization of the medi
cal field, that he is "too neolithic,"
that the book is too idealistic and that
what he has to say "is true in theory,
but is impractical."
Robin said his book is not anti
science. "We simply need to change
the system by which we evaluate any
new technology or science to deter
mine whether it helps, hurts or has no

'Many diseases
are caused by doc
tors.'

effect at all by the use of careful clini
cal trials."
We need to demand better science
— more rigorous science, according
to Robin. "If something is said to be
scientific, or to be a new technology,
it is automatically assumed to benefit
patients. Every introduction must be
better tested to know the exact bal
ance of how helpful or applicable it
really is."
"There are no villains in this,"
Robin said. "Society and patients, to
some extent, as well as medicine, are
all at fault. It's more important to see
what can be done than to point fin
gers at anyone."

"This approach leads to a number of
abuses of the patients."
The introduction of costly— rather
than efficient — technology because
of higher profit returns and methods
of treatment that prolong patients'
stays in hospitals are causes for ag
gravation.
Entrepreneurial approaches tend
to increase the risk to patients, Robin
said. "When doctors are out to make
a profit, they do many more tests than
are necessary. Each test has risks, and
if too many tests are done, some will
turn out to be 'false-positives,' result
ing in patients being harmed."
There are those who feel that if the
amount of economic gains was cut in
the medical field, the care would
become better.
"Some things in medicine,
however, are understandably expen
sive, but they should still be available
to patients," Robin said. "I anticipate
that if the present trend toward eco
nomic gain continues, that the status
doctors currently enjoy will be greatly
lowered."
Criticisms that Robin said have

been leveled against his book are that
his analysis is simplistic, that it is not a
proper characterization of the medi
cal field, that he is "too neolithic,"
that the book is too idealistic and that
what he has to say "is true in theory,
but is impractical."
Robin said his book is not anti
science. "We simply need to change
the system by which we evaluate any
new technology or science to deter
mine whether it helps, hurts or has no

effect at all by the use of careful clini
cal trials."
We need to demand better science
— more rigorous science, according
to Robin. "If something is said to be
scientific, or to be a new technology,
it is automatically assumed to benefit
patients. Every introduction must be
better tested to know the exact bal
ance of how helpful or applicable it
really is."
"There are no villains in this,"
Robin said. "Society and patients, to
some extent, as well as medicine, are
all at fault. It's more important to see
what can be done than to point fin
gers at anyone."

Dr. Eugene Robin, author of "Matters of Life and Death: Risks vs. Benefits in Medical Care/' lectures at the Stanford Medical Center.
Stanford Medical School Prof. Eugene Robin says that
medicine can cause diseases and harm or endanger the
lives of millions of patients.
"Anything in medicine has both risks and benefits,"
Robin said. "Along with the increase in the progress of
science and technology, the potential for medicine to do
both harm and good has also increased."
In his new book, "Matters of Life and Death: Risks vs.
Benefits in Medical Care," published by the Stanford
Alumni Association, Robin examines the deficiencies in
the present medical system.
A recent book review said of Robin's new work:
"The book is likely to be controversial because it
smashes some familiar idols — doctors, hospitals and the
medical education system. It challenges what its author
calls medicine's inflated estimate of its achievements, and
makes a compelling case for the re-evaluation of many
long-established practices."
Robin explains two different ways medicine can do
harm to masses of patients because of systematic errors
incorporated into medical practice.
"latro-genic (pronounced Yatro-genic) episodes are
accidents that happen to patients while being cared for,"
Robin said in an interview. "Many 'diseases' are caused
by doctors, but many are accidents. Many of these will
happen anyway, but we can cut down on the number."
"latroepidemics are plagues caused by doctors or
medicine when a systematic error is introduced and the
error results in harm or death to masses of patients,"
Robin said. "latroepidemics comes about when a test is
not well-tested or a form of treatment is introduced that
has not had adequate trial."
Robin emphasized that he is not "anti-doctor." "I'm
proud of being a doctor. I would simply like to help find
ways for medicine to help patients more and to be more
responsive. I expect to be strongly criticized, and I think
that is healthy, especially if it is promoting discussion of
these matters."
Medical risks today could be reduced if doctors were to
receive better training, according to Robin. "Many risky,
irrelevant studies which are routinely performed on
patients happen not because doctors are acting irrespon
sibly, but because their training is deficient to begin with.
"If 25 to 30 percent of the medical curriculum was
devoted to teaching the limitations of medicine, making
students understand how little we really know, how to
better involve patients in the process of their own care and
how to recognize iatro-genic episodes and how they might
be prevented, we could then raise a generation of doctors
who would be more closely allied to their patients and
who understood better the risks as well as the benefits in
medicine," Robin said.
Robin stressed that most of these methods are not cur
rently taught.
He said Stanford has particular problems in that its
levels of clinical teaching and excellence have been ques
tioned.
"It would be great for us to turn out innovative means
for turning out more responsive doctors," Robin said,
"but we don't want to imitate others. We should find a
way of taking a leadership role in turning out a better
group of doctors."
Robin added that while we wait for these problems to
be addressed, it is important for patients themselves to
take a more active role in their medical treatment.
"Patients and doctors are partners in an enterprise in
which the patient has the most at stake. Passivity can be
bad for the outcome to the disease."
The evolution of medicine as a field
of service into one of business is an
other concern of the author.
"Doctors and hospitals are increas
ingly being converted into a business
for turning a profit," Robin said.
"This approach leads to a number of
abuses of the patients."
The introduction of costly— rather
