Battle in Korean DMZ
TOKYO A South Korean soldier was killed and a
U.S. soldier wounded Friday at the truce village of Pan
munjom in a shoot-out with North Koreans who ap
parently were trying to stop one or two Soviet citizens
from defecting.
Three North Koreans were reported killed in the inci
dent at the neutral site, located in the 155-mile long
Demilitarized Zone that divides the Korean Peninsula.
According to television reports, one Soviet citizen
safely reached South Korea during the incident. He was
reportedly flown by helicopter to Seoul, where he re
quested asylum in the United States.
Under the armistice agreement, both sides are allowed
to maintain armed guards at Panmunjom, where periodic
talks have taken place for the past three decades. South
Korean and U.S. military personnel jointly guard South
Korea's side.
Both sides bring tourists to Panmunjom, in the com
pany of guides whose narratives are heavily political.
North Korean soldiers frequently are seen posing for
pictures at the demarcation line with South Korean guards
a few feet behind them.
Television reports said the incident began when a So
viet citizen guiding a group of Soviet tourists around the
North Korean area stepped across the demarcation line
just before noon Friday.
According to the U.N. Command, 20 to 30 North
Korean guards then crossed into the south's territory and
opened fire in an attempt to stop the defection.
South Korean soldiers fired in self-defense, a command
spokesman said.
The South Korean casualties were not identified, pend
ing notification of relatives. In Washington, the Pentagon
identified the wounded American as Pvt. Michael Bur
goyne, 20, of Portland, Mich. The Pentagon said he was
hospitalized in satisfactory condition.
Neither U.S. nor South Korean officials would identify
the Soviet, saying only that he was a member of a North
Korean-sponsored tour of the joint-security area that sur
rounds the truce village.
However, Kyodo News Service in Japan identified him
as Basil Mapuzak, 22.
Planning begins for talks
WASHINGTON — Intensive administration efforts to
prepare for resumed arms-control negotiations with the
Soviet Union will focus on a broad outline for initial dis
cussion, rather than detailed proposals, and Secretary of
State George Shultz will report back to President Reagan
before any decisions are made, an administration official
said Saturday.

"I don't expect him (Reagan) to decide until he has to,"
said the official, speaking on the condition that he not be
named. "Shultz could go off to Geneva just with guid
ance."
This week, after returning from a nine-day stay at his
ranch near Santa Barbara, Reagan is expected to begin a
round of conferences with his senior national-security ad
visers. He will confer in person with at least two Allied
leaders before Shultz meets with Soviet Foreign Minister
Andrei Gromyko in Geneva on Jan. 7 and 8.
Among the topics on which Reagan and his advisers —
Shultz, Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and Na
tional Security Adviser Robert McFarlane — will concen
trate will be the path Shultz should follow in his initial
conversations with Gromyko.
"We've suggested . . . identifying areas where we can

move most promptly and spinning off from the new
negotiations some working groups to cover special areas,"
the official said.
These areas could include space weapons, medium
range weapons in Europe and intercontinental ballistic
missiles, he said. Other areas considered topics for the
overall discussions include chemical weapons, conven
tional forces in Europe and confidence-building
measures.
Quakes shake California
A strong earthquake shook the central valley of Cali
fornia Friday, but there were no reports of serious damage
or injuries, officials said.
The magnitude was estimated at 5.7 on the Richter
Scale of ground motion, said Lucy Jones, a geophysicist

for the U.S. Geological Survey. The temblor was the
strongest irt California since May 1983, when an
earthquake registering 6.7 injured 47 persons and caused
about $31 million in Coalinga.
The epicenter of Friday's quake was 15 miles northwest
of Bishop, near Paradise Camp, Jones said. Bishop is
about 200 miles east of San Jose.
The temblor, which occurred at 10:08 p.m., was felt
from Nevada County as far south as the Los Angeles area
and from the Pacific Coast as far east as Las Vegas.
Hundreds of aftershocks followed the quake, including
one Friday that measured 4.9 on the Richter scale and two
Saturday night that hit 4.2 on the Richter scale.
Another earthquake — unrelated to the Friday tremor
— rumbled under the Pacific Ocean 10 miles west of
Santa Catalina Island on Saturday, but no damage was re
ported, the California Institute of Technology said.
That earthquake, at 9:09 p.m., registered 4.1 on the
Richter scale and there were reports that it was felt in
Mission Viejo in Orange County, about 50 miles east of
the center of the quake, Caltech spokesman Dennis
Meredith said.
More Chilean police raids
SANTIAGO, Chile — Convoys of heavily armed police
and troops backed by helicopters raided at least seven
neighborhoods here Saturday, arrested dozens of persons
and threatened violent repression of any demonstration
against the government of Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
In the widest-ranging military operation since Pinochet
declared a state of siege Nov. 6, districts of low-income
housing around Santiago were invaded almost simultane
ously Saturday morning by armored cars, trucks and buses
carrying police and troops. Some raids reportedly contin
ued into the afternoon.
In some instances, the government forces patrolled
streets and checked cars and identity cards for up to
several hours without making arrests or searching homes.
In other districts homes were searched and hundreds of
people were detained temporarily by security forces, who
sometimes randomly seized people found on the streets.
The object of the raids appeared to be to intimidate res
idents with a show of force only three days before planned
nationwide anti-government demonstrations. "They said
they were going to be tough," said the Rev. Enrique
Gonzales, a priest in the north Santiago district of Colon
Oriente. "They said they would burn down the church."
Government authorities had offered no information by
late Saturday on the raids, and Chilean media had not
been allowed to report on them. Officials at the Chilean
Human-Rights Commission said that partial reports indi
cated that at least 50 persons had been jailed in addition
to those temporarily detained.

The object of the raids appeared to be to intimidate res
idents with a show of force only three days before planned
nationwide anti-government demonstrations. "They said
they were going to be tough," said the Rev. Enrique
Gonzales, a priest in the north Santiago district of Colon
Oriente. "They said they would burn down the church."
Government authorities had offered no information by
late Saturday on the raids, and Chilean media had not
been allowed to report on them. Officials at the Chilean
Human-Rights Commission said that partial reports indi
cated that at least 50 persons had been jailed in addition
to those temporarily detained.

Battle in Korean DMZ
TOKYO A South Korean soldier was killed and a
U.S. soldier wounded Friday at the truce village of Pan
munjom in a shoot-out with North Koreans who ap
parently were trying to stop one or two Soviet citizens
from defecting.
Three North Koreans were reported killed in the inci
dent at the neutral site, located in the 155-mile long
Demilitarized Zone that divides the Korean Peninsula.
According to television reports, one Soviet citizen
safely reached South Korea during the incident. He was
reportedly flown by helicopter to Seoul, where he re
quested asylum in the United States.
Under the armistice agreement, both sides are allowed
to maintain armed guards at Panmunjom, where periodic
talks have taken place for the past three decades. South
Korean and U.S. military personnel jointly guard South
Korea's side.
Both sides bring tourists to Panmunjom, in the com
pany of guides whose narratives are heavily political.
North Korean soldiers frequently are seen posing for
pictures at the demarcation line with South Korean guards
a few feet behind them.
Television reports said the incident began when a So
viet citizen guiding a group of Soviet tourists around the
North Korean area stepped across the demarcation line
just before noon Friday.
According to the U.N. Command, 20 to 30 North
Korean guards then crossed into the south's territory and
opened fire in an attempt to stop the defection.
South Korean soldiers fired in self-defense, a command
spokesman said.
The South Korean casualties were not identified, pend
ing notification of relatives. In Washington, the Pentagon
identified the wounded American as Pvt. Michael Bur
goyne, 20, of Portland, Mich. The Pentagon said he was
hospitalized in satisfactory condition.
Neither U.S. nor South Korean officials would identify
the Soviet, saying only that he was a member of a North
Korean-sponsored tour of the joint-security area that sur
rounds the truce village.
However, Kyodo News Service in Japan identified him
as Basil Mapuzak, 22.
Planning begins for talks
WASHINGTON — Intensive administration efforts to
prepare for resumed arms-control negotiations with the
Soviet Union will focus on a broad outline for initial dis
cussion, rather than detailed proposals, and Secretary of
State George Shultz will report back to President Reagan
before any decisions are made, an administration official
said Saturday.

"I don't expect him (Reagan) to decide until he has to,"
said the official, speaking on the condition that he not be
named. "Shultz could go off to Geneva just with guid
ance."
This week, after returning from a nine-day stay at his
ranch near Santa Barbara, Reagan is expected to begin a
round of conferences with his senior national-security ad
visers. He will confer in person with at least two Allied
leaders before Shultz meets with Soviet Foreign Minister
Andrei Gromyko in Geneva on Jan. 7 and 8.
Among the topics on which Reagan and his advisers —
Shultz, Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and Na
tional Security Adviser Robert McFarlane — will concen
trate will be the path Shultz should follow in his initial
conversations with Gromyko.
"We've suggested . . . identifying areas where we can

move most promptly and spinning off from the new
negotiations some working groups to cover special areas,"
the official said.
These areas could include space weapons, medium
range weapons in Europe and intercontinental ballistic
missiles, he said. Other areas considered topics for the
overall discussions include chemical weapons, conven
tional forces in Europe and confidence-building
measures.
Quakes shake California
A strong earthquake shook the central valley of Cali
fornia Friday, but there were no reports of serious damage
or injuries, officials said.
The magnitude was estimated at 5.7 on the Richter
Scale of ground motion, said Lucy Jones, a geophysicist

for the U.S. Geological Survey. The temblor was the
strongest irt California since May 1983, when an
earthquake registering 6.7 injured 47 persons and caused
about $31 million in Coalinga.
The epicenter of Friday's quake was 15 miles northwest
of Bishop, near Paradise Camp, Jones said. Bishop is
about 200 miles east of San Jose.
The temblor, which occurred at 10:08 p.m., was felt
from Nevada County as far south as the Los Angeles area
and from the Pacific Coast as far east as Las Vegas.
Hundreds of aftershocks followed the quake, including
one Friday that measured 4.9 on the Richter scale and two
Saturday night that hit 4.2 on the Richter scale.
Another earthquake — unrelated to the Friday tremor
— rumbled under the Pacific Ocean 10 miles west of
Santa Catalina Island on Saturday, but no damage was re
ported, the California Institute of Technology said.
That earthquake, at 9:09 p.m., registered 4.1 on the
Richter scale and there were reports that it was felt in
Mission Viejo in Orange County, about 50 miles east of
the center of the quake, Caltech spokesman Dennis
Meredith said.
More Chilean police raids
SANTIAGO, Chile — Convoys of heavily armed police
and troops backed by helicopters raided at least seven
neighborhoods here Saturday, arrested dozens of persons
and threatened violent repression of any demonstration
against the government of Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
In the widest-ranging military operation since Pinochet
declared a state of siege Nov. 6, districts of low-income
housing around Santiago were invaded almost simultane
ously Saturday morning by armored cars, trucks and buses
carrying police and troops. Some raids reportedly contin
ued into the afternoon.
In some instances, the government forces patrolled
streets and checked cars and identity cards for up to
several hours without making arrests or searching homes.
In other districts homes were searched and hundreds of
people were detained temporarily by security forces, who
sometimes randomly seized people found on the streets.
The object of the raids appeared to be to intimidate res
idents with a show of force only three days before planned
nationwide anti-government demonstrations. "They said
