Stanford students still talk of the unforgettable
events at Big Game 1984.
Students like senior Brian Jeffrey, who des
cribed the feeling of a night stick blow to the
Adam's apple. Students like junior Hubert
Cheng, who explained the helplessness of being
knocked breathless and shoved down a flight of
stairs.
Countless casualties continue to come forward,
offering colorful accounts of Stanford police offi
cers throwing body blocks, poking night sticks
into kidneys, pinning arms behind backs and ad
ministering choke holds. A group of resident as
sistants at Branner Hall drew comparisons with
the infamous 1968 Democratic National Conven
tion in Chicago.
The clash between students and police oc
curred when the football game ended and Stan
ford fans jumped the low barrier between the
stands and the field and rushed out to join the
frenetic players and Band members. Police had
been assigned the unenviable task of keeping fans
off the field, and they quickly resorted to violence
to restrain the throng of students.
A number of factors contributed to the student
debacle which may someday be remembered as
the Big Maim. Foremost among these is police
brutality. We condemn the actions of Stanford

police, contending that they did not have ade
quate cause to justify their aggression. Knowing
students would attempt to run onto the field after
the game, the police forces of both Berkeley and
Stanford should have planned beforehand a
viable method of restraining the crowd without
striking individuals. More officers would have
been in order.
Another reason the clash occurred is that Stan
ford students did not know they would not be
allowed on the field. Many recalled the student
stampede of Big Game 1982; students had not
been barred from Berkeley's field then. Few
heard the one announcement near the end of the
game; it was Berkeley's only warning against run
ning onto the field. Berkeley authorities should
have posted warnings or otherwise informed stu
dents that they were unwelcome to join in the
celebration.
We do not wish to challenge the notion that
police were acting properly in prohibiting students
from running onto the field. We do not wish to
vindicate Stanford students who struggled with
and struck police officers. We merely wish to
note that in the cases of many students at the
game, the brutal beating dished out by police was
doubtless undeserved and unnecessary had auth
orities taken adequate steps of precaution.
