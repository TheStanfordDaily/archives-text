## Open season on Philippine opposition leaders 
### 
You can read this story about a 68-year-old
man who had his face torn away and his brains
splattered on the sidewalk two weeks ago by a
.45 caliber bullet in the back of his head ... or
jou can turn the page, as your government
* likely will.
You might think that they're all savages out
there anyway, in places like Zamboanga City
on the Philippine island of Mindanao, where
half-naked children chase chickens in the mud
underneath their crumbling one-room

"'wooden homes, where rebels take sanctuary

sides and where traders arrive daily from Bor

swarms with people and animals and decay.
But it strikes closer to home than you might
think.

curent head of the armed forces, is a West

a turkey dinner in Manila for graduates of
American colleges and universities.
Which side are the savages on?
As an aside, it is ironic that this murder
comes at a time when the University calls on
its students to enter careers in public service.
One wonders what kind of public servants we
will be.
It was one year ago this week that I met
Cesar Climaco in Zamboanga's city hall. I had
spent the previous day with another mayor in
another town in Mindanao. Then, the other
mayor was under house arrest. Now he's in
prison.
Fortunately, I was in Mindanao at a good
time. I didn't get caught in the line of fire.
It would be hard to find a more affable man
or well-loved mayor than Cesar Climoco. He
had both an American and a Filipino sense of
humor. I joked with him about his picture
hanging in city hall, from back in the days
when he still had hair, and he fired back a
retort linking me with the CIA.
He had been mayor of Zamboanga back in
the 1950s and had spent several years after
that with relatives in the United States, but he
came back to the Philippines to serve another
generation of his countrymen. He said his
people needed him to speak out against the
Marcos tyranny. He was re-elected mayor and
earlier this year was elected to the National
Assembly.
He invited me to a ceremonial picnic for
local high school students and then out to a
city monument. There is a World War II
monument to the U.S. Army up in the hills
behind the city. We drove up there and he
mugged for a photographer under an Ameri
can military helmet 10 feet in diameter. It

wouldn't nave saved him.
Climaco said Marcos called it "Operation
Mad-Dog." The plan was to assassinate all of
the opposition leaders . . . those few
Philippine mayors, assemblymen and gover
nors who had had the courage to raise their
voices in a call for the Philippines to return to
democracy. Aquino was first. Others would
follow.
Marcos wouldn't have to kill them all —
just one by one . .. just enough to create fear.

Marcos wouldn't have
to kill them all — just
one by one . . . just
enough to create fear.

That's how they do it in the Philippines.
This is why the U.S. Embassy can say
smugly that, "Marcos isn't a bloodthirsty dic
tator. He understands his people. He was
elected. He's a brilliant man. He is the glue
that holds Philippine society together.
Americans just don't understand the situa
tion."
Few took Climaco's charges seriously, in
cluding the members of the U.S. foreign serv
ice. He was always raving about Marcos,
writing lengthy critical letters to Malacanang
Palace where Marcos has presided for 19

years. He was a comical-looking balding man
with shoulder-length white hair. He had
vowed not to cut it until Marcos left office.
Of the opposition leaders, Climaco was the
most vocal.
"I tell them not to criticize Marcos the way
I do," he told me. "They would be endanger
ing their lives. I have a special relationship
with the president. We have a personal
friendship dating back to our days together in
law school. He needs me as a critic. He can al
ways point to me and say there is democratic
opposition in the Philippines. I get what I
need for development projects so that Marcos
can say, 'See, I don't punish opposition
areas.' "
What I remember most vividly, though, is
that on the balcony of city hall, he kept a
scoreboard with the number of unsolved
deaths and disappearances in Zamboanga. A
message on the board asked President Marcos
and General Fidel Ramos why they had
refused to investigate the deaths. Cities don't
have their own police forces anymore. They
are all under Marcos' central control. Climaco
believed many of the deaths to have been
caused by the military.
Some mornings Climaco said he would find
his scoreboard covered with red paint, but he
would always replace it and fire off another
letter asking why Marcos' national police
could not even protect his city hall.
My blood runs cold when I think about that
scoreboard now.
Marcos has vowed to get to the bottom of
the killing. Guess what? He has appointed
General Fidel Ramos to handle the investiga
tion; the same man who never investigated
any of the killings in Zamboanga, despite

Climaco's weekly letters and persistant
message on the scoreboard.
Why would anyone hurt a man like
Climaco? Why now?
If it was the Marcos government, it prob
ably has to do with something called "quiet
diplomacy." That's the Reagan administra
tion's policy for de-emphasizing human
rights.
Vice President George Bush demonstrated
that policy two years ago when he went to the
Philippines to embrace Marcos as a great sup
porter democracy.
President Reagan reiterated the policy in
the second debate with Walter Mondale when
he said the United States was better off sup
porting Marcos than giving the island to the
communists. He seemed to forget about
legitimate opposition leaders like Climaco.
The statements were not unnoticed in the
Philippines. After all, the Marcos government
still issues stamps with pictures of Ferdinand
and Imelda Marcos with President and Nancy-
Reagan.
The timing of the assassination was excel
lent; just a week after the U.S. election; too
close for comfort.
When 59 percent of the American people
pulled the lever for quiet diplomacy earlier
this month, they didn't just pull an ordinary
lever. That lever may have been the trigger on
the gun that killed a man named Cesar
Climaco.
It's open hunting season on decent people
fighting for democracy . . . even if they are
gentle grandfathers like Climaco.
Who will be the next victim?

generation of his countrymen. He said his
people needed him to speak out against the
Marcos tyranny. He was re-elected mayor and
earlier this year was elected to the National
Assembly.
He invited me to a ceremonial picnic for
local high school students and then out to a
city monument. There is a World War II
monument to the U.S. Army up in the hills
behind the city. We drove up there and he
mugged for a photographer under an Ameri
can military helmet 10 feet in diameter. It

wouldn't nave saved him.
Climaco said Marcos called it "Operation
Mad-Dog." The plan was to assassinate all of
the opposition leaders . . . those few
Philippine mayors, assemblymen and gover
nors who had had the courage to raise their
voices in a call for the Philippines to return to
democracy. Aquino was first. Others would
follow.
Marcos wouldn't have to kill them all —
just one by one . .. just enough to create fear.

Marcos wouldn't have
to kill them all — just
one by one . . . just
enough to create fear.

That's how they do it in the Philippines.
This is why the U.S. Embassy can say
smugly that, "Marcos isn't a bloodthirsty dic
tator. He understands his people. He was
elected. He's a brilliant man. He is the glue
that holds Philippine society together.
Americans just don't understand the situa
tion."
Few took Climaco's charges seriously, in
cluding the members of the U.S. foreign serv
ice. He was always raving about Marcos,
writing lengthy critical letters to Malacanang
Palace where Marcos has presided for 19

years. He was a comical-looking balding man
with shoulder-length white hair. He had
vowed not to cut it until Marcos left office.
Of the opposition leaders, Climaco was the
most vocal.
"I tell them not to criticize Marcos the way
I do," he told me. "They would be endanger
ing their lives. I have a special relationship
with the president. We have a personal
friendship dating back to our days together in
law school. He needs me as a critic. He can al
ways point to me and say there is democratic
opposition in the Philippines. I get what I
need for development projects so that Marcos
can say, 'See, I don't punish opposition
areas.' "
What I remember most vividly, though, is
that on the balcony of city hall, he kept a
scoreboard with the number of unsolved
deaths and disappearances in Zamboanga. A
message on the board asked President Marcos
and General Fidel Ramos why they had
refused to investigate the deaths. Cities don't
have their own police forces anymore. They
are all under Marcos' central control. Climaco
believed many of the deaths to have been
caused by the military.
Some mornings Climaco said he would find
his scoreboard covered with red paint, but he
would always replace it and fire off another
letter asking why Marcos' national police
could not even protect his city hall.
My blood runs cold when I think about that
scoreboard now.
Marcos has vowed to get to the bottom of
the killing. Guess what? He has appointed
General Fidel Ramos to handle the investiga
tion; the same man who never investigated
any of the killings in Zamboanga, despite

Climaco's weekly letters and persistant
message on the scoreboard.
Why would anyone hurt a man like
Climaco? Why now?
If it was the Marcos government, it prob
ably has to do with something called "quiet
diplomacy." That's the Reagan administra
tion's policy for de-emphasizing human
rights.
Vice President George Bush demonstrated
that policy two years ago when he went to the
Philippines to embrace Marcos as a great sup
porter democracy.
President Reagan reiterated the policy in
the second debate with Walter Mondale when
he said the United States was better off sup
porting Marcos than giving the island to the
communists. He seemed to forget about
legitimate opposition leaders like Climaco.
The statements were not unnoticed in the
Philippines. After all, the Marcos government
still issues stamps with pictures of Ferdinand
and Imelda Marcos with President and Nancy-
Reagan.
The timing of the assassination was excel
lent; just a week after the U.S. election; too
close for comfort.
When 59 percent of the American people
pulled the lever for quiet diplomacy earlier
this month, they didn't just pull an ordinary
lever. That lever may have been the trigger on
the gun that killed a man named Cesar
Climaco.
It's open hunting season on decent people
fighting for democracy . . . even if they are
gentle grandfathers like Climaco.
Who will be the next victim?

It was one year ago this week that I met
Cesar Climaco in Zamboanga's city hall. I had
spent the previous day with another mayor in
another town in Mindanao. Then, the other
mayor was under house arrest. Now he's in
prison.
Fortunately, I was in Mindanao at a good
time. I didn't get caught in the line of fire.
It would be hard to find a more affable man
or well-loved mayor than Cesar Climoco. He
had both an American and a Filipino sense of
humor. I joked with him about his picture
hanging in city hall, from back in the days
when he still had hair, and he fired back a
retort linking me with the CIA.
He had been mayor of Zamboanga back in
the 1950s and had spent several years after
that with relatives in the United States, but he
