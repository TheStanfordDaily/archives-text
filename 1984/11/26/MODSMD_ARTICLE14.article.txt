## The 						gray sophomore slump 
### 
Sophomore slump. Freshmen don't know it
exists, or if they do it's just a vague gray cloud
floating on the horizon; juniors and seniors watch it
fade into the gray haze of days gone by, but soph
omores (a good number of us, anyway) must deal
with the sticky, gray slump that oozes into our lives
like cold cream-of-mushroom soup.
Gray is the perfect adjective to describe the
slump. What you feel is an almost empty blandness.
There's a lack of motivation to study and a lack of
energy, no great disappointments and no exalted
triumphs. The black-and-white extremes of fresh
man excitement and en rgency have merged into a
balanced sophomore n n. On a gray rainy day,
you're more inclined to ..tare blankly out the win
ridow than to force your way through the ever-
I waiting problem set. You know it'll get done even
tually, just not right this moment. Your professors
speak to you in droning, fuzzy tones, and after 20
E. minutes the notes blur on the page before you.
Pj Before long you slide down in your seat and start to
® tune out — yes, the slump has begun.
Where did the slump come from? That's not too
hard to figure out. As frosh we were dazzled by it
all, but now we're used to the Stanford system. You
worked so hard last year in your eagerness to do
well, and what did you get out of it? A "B" in
Western Culture. Or maybe you pulled weekly all
nighters for physics, chem and calculus, and blew
Western Culture entirely. Or else you got the grade
in Western Culture, while the rest of your classes
dropped into the dust along the way.

The bottom line is this: Looking back, soph
omores come up with a new strategy. Why put in
so much work when you'll come out basically the
same? Who needs the gray hairs? So, you slow it
down, take a more mellow approach. TTiese aren't
general low-level classes anymore; we're dealing
with upper-division work and more sophisticated
micks. After blowing that first crucial midterm, you
don't panic like you did last year. Instead, you gain
a better perspective — a Stanford education is
much more than just dull gray academics. Faced
with these great truths, there's no excuse not to
drop the poli-sci reading (just for a half-hour,
honest) and go hang out.
The slump thickens with the new responsibilities
that sophomore year brings. There's a whole host
of friends from last year that you have to visit,
stories to rehash and great moments to relive. You
need free time to reflect on the mass of experience
you've built up. No more rushing off to study right
after dinner; now, you settle back in your chair,
have a cup of coffee and talk. You've got the whole
rest of the night to do your homework, so why not
relax? Enthrall the frosh with tales from last year
— everything was so much better then. No matter
where you're living, it's a hell of a lot longer trip to
Meyer.
As if all that wasn't enough to put us in a rut,
sophomores must confront for real the hardest
problem of all: planning for the future. This is the
year you declare, son. Most of us had no problem
picking out a major (for show, if nothing else)

before we even got to Stanford. The situation has
changed. Faced with the human-biology core, are
you sure you want to be a pre-med? How can you
go to Vienna next fall if you want to do a double
major? You need to find a decent adviser to help
you plan the next three years. Present classes lose
their urgency as you look into the dense gray fog
ahead. There's no sense in overworking yourself
like you did freshman year — you've got to con
serve your energy in order to make it ail the way.
Review section on Saturday? No thanks, I'd rather
get some sleep.
The slump is not our fault. It's the system. Take
away the safety of inexperience and enthusiasm of
naivete; strip off the insulation from choice that ac
companies the first year of classes; throw in a hefty
helping of dire decisions to be made and new re
sponsibilities to handle; top it off with the heavy
knowledge that soon enough there won't be any
going back, even though you can't possibly know
what lies in the gray days ahead; do all that to us,
and then ask, who wouldn't slump under the
weight?
I'm sure that if we sat down and really got down
to it, we could come up with some way to clean up
the whole gray mess. But y'know, I could really go
for a fro yo right now. Let's worry about it a little
later.
