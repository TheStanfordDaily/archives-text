Police response just
1 here they go again. I've found
that most of The Daily's editorials
seem to be fairly well thought out,
thoroughly investigated and well
written. Once in a while, however.
The Daily's editorial board finds
itself writing an editorial about: 1) a
subject they know nothing about,
and 2) an event in which they fail to
investigate the story.
Last Thursday (Nov. 15) The
Daily published an editorial based on
film of part of a demonstration that
they saw on TV. If The Daily had
— bothered to learn about the training
and procedures of the San Francisco

Police Tactical Division, they would
know that "wanton head-bashing" is
not "a hobby" for the police, and
any officer partaking in such action is
severely punished. Each demonstra
tion that involves the tactical division
is carefully critiqued afterward to
reveal any misconduct by the offi
cers.
If The Daily had bothered to make
a few phone calls to hear both sides
of the story to which they refer, they
would have found out that: 1) The
protest was not entirely "peaceful"
— the group of protesters being
arrested when the TV camera lights
were broken were quite violent,
kicking and punching the officers

who were trying to peacefully arrest
them. The TV camera crews did not
show up until after this part of the
situation took place; 2) the camera
crews did not stay behind the police
line as they were instructed to do —
a procedure that is part of an agree
ment formed between the TV sta
tions and the police department in
1968; and 3) several veteran TV
reporters, including one news direc
tor, called and apologized to the
tactical division captain for the be
havior of the "rookie" camera crews,
I don't understand why The
Daily wants to frighten the
Stanford community by implying that
the kind of peaceful demonstrations

and rallies we see on the campus will
provoke a police officer to attack a
peaceful demonstrator. I don't know
of any person participating in the
San Francisco Big Game rally in a
peaceful and lawful manner who has
ever gotten "a billy club in the
back." I suggest that the editorial
staff contact the appropriate authori
ties to learn about police procedures,
tactics and philosophies regarding
crowd control before they claim to
know "when police action is war
ranted" or whether the evening news
is showing "wanton head-bashing"
or legal police arrests.
