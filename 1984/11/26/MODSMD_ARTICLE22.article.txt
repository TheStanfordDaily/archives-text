## HP has unique successes and slowdowns 
### GREG CROSSFIELD 
Hewlett-Packard is one of the most
uniquely successful companies in the world. It
is unique because there has been a great deal
satisfaction from both the shareholders and
employees. Under John Young, president and
1 executive officer, the satisfaction has
'""been continued, but a changing marketplace
3,t and formidable competition have put a
damper on some aspects of the company.
1 r Founded in 1939 by Stanford alums
Hewlett and David Packard, HP was
'"•primarily an electronic instrument manufac
turer. The need to have controllers for the in
-I;,,struments led HP to manufacture computers.
Now computers, ranging from hand-held
_qcalculators to mini machines, account for
t3 |more than 50 percent of revenues, insta
lments account for 35 percent and hospital
equipment accounts for the rest.
One of the the things that has played a big
jVole in HP's prosperity is a management style
r 'appropriatley dubbed "the HP way." "Our
corporate objective calls for more than crank
', ling the earnings up and keeping the sales on
track. The HP way is a high regard for the dig
""'nity of the individual," Young said.
"It is personally expressed in many ways.
For example, there are no time clocks here.
You are here to manage yourself. There is a
nc t J window from 6 to 8:30 a.m. during which you
? 3 can come to work. After you put in your eight
m hours, you can go home. You are here to
manage yourself. Figure out your own
schedule."
1 The HP way is present on the macro level
"' as well. "There are 56 operating divisions. All
" have the departments needed to develop
''"products and bring them to market. This
"°leaves room for entrepreneurial freedom of
.action. You can make a difference and be
W

recognized for it in a big way. Our people also
share in the profits of the company twice a
year."
How do you manage a company that em
phasizes the free-wheeling entrepreneurial
environment? "It is called management by

objective. We say to our people, 'Here is the
framework and the objective.' We then leave
room to allow them to think about how to
make a contribution. This allows us to inject
the creative process into the middle of what's
going on. The people closest to the customer

can come to a decision on what to do."
What they have done in Young's first six
years is increase revenues from $1.74 billion
to $4.7 billion, while earnings have increased
from $150 million to $432 million. The num
ber of employees has increased from 42,200
to 82,000.
After getting a degree in electrical engi
neering from Oregon State University, Young
spent two years in the Air Force. He then
came to the Stanford Graduate School of
Business. He worked at HP during the sum
mer after his first year at Stanford. His super
iors were sufficiently impressed to invite him
to return for a special program designed to
give a few bright kids a look at a number of
different departments.
Due to his superior performance on his ini
tial assignments, Young caught the eye of
upper-level managers. Continued hard work
resulted in his becoming a division general
manager in 1963. He then became a vice
president in chaige of several divisions in
1968 on the way to becoming president and
chief executive officer in November of 1977.
Young said students should be careful not
to limit themselves during college.
"Most of the people I see are engineers and
MBAs. I know that it is difficult enough to
just complete an engineering degree at Stan
ford, but one area they should concentrate on
is getting exposure to other disciplines. We
need people that are capable of thinking in
terms of what the market wants, not just tech
nicians," he said.
This strikes a sensitive nerve at HP because
this is one area where Young has recently had
to make some changes. "We have moved
from being a product-oriented organization to
a market-oriented one." This was achieved by
grouping divisions with similar product lines.

In the case of the computer-aided engineer
ing division, the mid-summer reorganization
resulted in a number of resumes flying. The
software for the computer-aided engineering
system was being developed in Silicon Valley
while the computers were being developed in
Colorado. The communication lines were too
long to permit effective production of the
complete system. Moving the software divi
sion to Colorado resulted in key developers'
going to competitors or shifting to other divi
sions in the Bay Area.
Another area of difficulty for HP has been
marketing. In the good old days, when HP
was primarily an instrument maker, HP only
needed to develop products to have engineers
all over the world line up to buy. Engineers
could justify paying a premium price because
they knew they were getting superior engi
neering.
Now that HP has made a big push into com
puters and office automation, it has been
forced to make a name for itself among con
sumers. The consumer could not justify
paying a premium for an HP personal com
puter in a market dominated by IBM and Ap
ple. Despite huge sums that were spent on
marketing, the HP personal computer has not
sold as well as expected.
For these headaches Young receives an an
nual income of $728,000.
HP's stock has been selling at close to its
52-week low of $31 dollars recently. This is
in response to the recent reorganization and
several negative articles on the company.
With a $600 million budget for research and
development and the kind of people that have
generated impressive figures in the past, this
stock looks like a bargain. "The opportunities
are as great as they have ever been," Young
said.

What they have done in Young's first six
years is increase revenues from $1.74 billion
to $4.7 billion, while earnings have increased
from $150 million to $432 million. The num
ber of employees has increased from 42,200
to 82,000.
After getting a degree in electrical engi
neering from Oregon State University, Young
spent two years in the Air Force. He then
came to the Stanford Graduate School of
Business. He worked at HP during the sum
mer after his first year at Stanford. His super
iors were sufficiently impressed to invite him
to return for a special program designed to
give a few bright kids a look at a number of
different departments.
Due to his superior performance on his ini
tial assignments, Young caught the eye of
upper-level managers. Continued hard work
resulted in his becoming a division general
manager in 1963. He then became a vice
president in chaige of several divisions in
1968 on the way to becoming president and
chief executive officer in November of 1977.
Young said students should be careful not
to limit themselves during college.
"Most of the people I see are engineers and
MBAs. I know that it is difficult enough to
just complete an engineering degree at Stan
ford, but one area they should concentrate on
is getting exposure to other disciplines. We
need people that are capable of thinking in
terms of what the market wants, not just tech
nicians," he said.
This strikes a sensitive nerve at HP because
this is one area where Young has recently had
to make some changes. "We have moved
from being a product-oriented organization to
a market-oriented one." This was achieved by
grouping divisions with similar product lines.

In the case of the computer-aided engineer
ing division, the mid-summer reorganization
resulted in a number of resumes flying. The
software for the computer-aided engineering
system was being developed in Silicon Valley
while the computers were being developed in
Colorado. The communication lines were too
long to permit effective production of the
complete system. Moving the software divi
sion to Colorado resulted in key developers'
going to competitors or shifting to other divi
sions in the Bay Area.
Another area of difficulty for HP has been
marketing. In the good old days, when HP
was primarily an instrument maker, HP only
needed to develop products to have engineers
all over the world line up to buy. Engineers
could justify paying a premium price because
they knew they were getting superior engi
neering.
Now that HP has made a big push into com
puters and office automation, it has been
forced to make a name for itself among con
sumers. The consumer could not justify
paying a premium for an HP personal com
puter in a market dominated by IBM and Ap
ple. Despite huge sums that were spent on
marketing, the HP personal computer has not
sold as well as expected.
For these headaches Young receives an an
nual income of $728,000.
HP's stock has been selling at close to its
52-week low of $31 dollars recently. This is
in response to the recent reorganization and
several negative articles on the company.
With a $600 million budget for research and
development and the kind of people that have
generated impressive figures in the past, this
stock looks like a bargain. "The opportunities
are as great as they have ever been," Young
said.

As president and chief executive officer of Hewlett-Packard Corp., John Young has his
hands full running the company "the HP way."
Hewlett-Packard is one of the most
uniquely successful companies in the world. It
is unique because there has been a great deal
satisfaction from both the shareholders and
employees. Under John Young, president and
1 executive officer, the satisfaction has
'""been continued, but a changing marketplace
3,t and formidable competition have put a
damper on some aspects of the company.
1 r Founded in 1939 by Stanford alums
Hewlett and David Packard, HP was
'"•primarily an electronic instrument manufac
turer. The need to have controllers for the in
-I;,,struments led HP to manufacture computers.
Now computers, ranging from hand-held
_qcalculators to mini machines, account for
t3 |more than 50 percent of revenues, insta
lments account for 35 percent and hospital
equipment accounts for the rest.
One of the the things that has played a big
jVole in HP's prosperity is a management style
r 'appropriatley dubbed "the HP way." "Our
corporate objective calls for more than crank
', ling the earnings up and keeping the sales on
track. The HP way is a high regard for the dig
""'nity of the individual," Young said.
"It is personally expressed in many ways.
For example, there are no time clocks here.
You are here to manage yourself. There is a
nc t J window from 6 to 8:30 a.m. during which you
? 3 can come to work. After you put in your eight
m hours, you can go home. You are here to
manage yourself. Figure out your own
schedule."
1 The HP way is present on the macro level
"' as well. "There are 56 operating divisions. All
" have the departments needed to develop
''"products and bring them to market. This
"°leaves room for entrepreneurial freedom of
.action. You can make a difference and be
W

recognized for it in a big way. Our people also
share in the profits of the company twice a
year."
How do you manage a company that em
phasizes the free-wheeling entrepreneurial
environment? "It is called management by

objective. We say to our people, 'Here is the
framework and the objective.' We then leave
room to allow them to think about how to
make a contribution. This allows us to inject
the creative process into the middle of what's
going on. The people closest to the customer

can come to a decision on what to do."
