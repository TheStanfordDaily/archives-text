## Cal takes second straight NCAA water polo title Hopes for championship take a dive 
### INGRID SEYER Staff sportswriter 
LONG BEACH — The Stanford
water polo team's hopes for an
NCAA title fell through in last night*s
championship game as the Cardinal
was defeated by the University of
California at Berkely at the Belmont
Pool Plaza.
The Cardinal earned its berth into
the finals with a 16-8 victory over the
Naval Academy and an 11-6 victory
over Pepperdine University. Stanford
ended the season 2S-S overall.
Cal defeated Loyola of Chicago,
11-3, and the University of Southern
California, 10-9, to advance to the
final.
The Carindal, the No. 1 seed
heading into the National Collegiate
Athletic Association Tournament, is
composed largely of freshmen and
sophomores, and, according to Stan
ford Coach Dante Dettamanti, the
young team's lack of play in previous
NCAA action hurt Stanford.
"I feel our inexperience hurt us the
most in the final game," Dettamanti
said. "We have a lot of young players
who were just not sure how to react in
a big game.
"For most of the first half, our
players seemed to be out in the
ozone. They were extremely tentative
on both offense and defense and just
could not get anything started."
Cal jumped out to a 3-0 lead and
held it until the last 12 seconds of the
first quarter, when senior Mark Daley
gave the Cardinal its first goal.
Entering the second quarter with a
two goal deficit, the Cardinal brought
the game within one with a 12-foot
shot by Marvin Mouchawar.
The Bears responded quickly with
two goals to open up their lead to
three before Stanford's David Imber
nino scored to start a three-goal
streak for the Cardinal. With 5:06
remaining in the thrid quarter, sopho
more Chris Thompson scored to tie
the game for the first time at five
each.

Cal rebounded less than a minute
later to reclaim the lead. According
to Cal Caoch Peter Cutino, the Bears'
ability to rebound after each Cardinal
goal was extremely important.
"Each time Stanford scored, we
were able to come back quickly and
regain the lead," Cutino said. "The
whole match was somewhat like a
chess game: there were so many cru
cial situations that had such an effect
on the overall outcome of the game."
Cutino said Alan Greshman, who
scored three goals for Cal, was the
real force behind the Bears.
"Greshamn was really the key to
our victory; he started out strong and
set the tone for the rest of the game,"

Cutino said. "Stanford really focused
their defense on Greshman in the
second half, but by then the rest of
our guys were able to come through
and keep the momentum going."
Greshman was equally pleased
with his play.
"Cutino told us to go out from the
start and play our own game," Gresh
man said. "I just went out and did
what I knew I could do."
Bill Schoening was another Cal
player who came through for the
Bears when they needed him, scoring
the winning goal with 32 seconds
remaining in the game.
With the game tied at eight, Stan
ford's Jaime Velez was ejected for 35

seconds, giving the Bears a six-on
five situation. With three seconds
remaining in the penalty period,
Schoening scored on a "Hail Mary"
shot to win the game.
"We held the Bears 'til the very
end and then lost it on a freak shot,"
Dettamanti said. "Schoening's shot
went through two palyers, bounced
off the goal bar and went in — there's
nothing you can do with a shot like
that."
Cardinal goalie Steve Moyer did
feel that there was something he
could have done.
"The game came down to one
goal," Moyer said. "It was a goal I

should have stopped."
Two Stanford players were named
to the NCAA Championship Tourna
ment Team, sophomores Imbernino
and Craig Klass. Imbernino scored
seven goals in the tournament and
Klass scored three goals but earned
the honor on fine all-around play.
The remaining players named to
the first team were Charlie Harris,
Mike Spicer and Eric Davison of
USC and Greshman and Shaun
Cleary of Cal. Stanford players
Moyer, Erich Fisher, Velez,
Thompson and Greg Gamble were
named to the Honorable Mention
squad.
USC won the consolation game,

13-10, over Peppcrdine to take third
place.
The Cardinal opened up the toyrn
ament with the victory over Navy.
According to Dettamanti, this match
followed the game plan perfectly.
"We were playing well enough to
play everybody and rest our starters
for the night game," Dettamanti said.
"We had a balanced scoring attack,
good counter attacks and some very
nice fast breaks."
The Cardinal jumped out to a 10-2
lead in the first half, led by Velez,
who scored all five of his goals in the
half.
According to Dettamanti, Velez's
high scoring was indicative of the
Midshipmen's basic deficiencies.
"Navy just wasn't used to the
quickness and speed of players like
Velez," Dettamanti said. "Jaime
(Velez) can be pretty tricky and if a
goalie isn't used to his style of play,
he's tough to stop."
.Velez was held to one goal in Stan
ford's second-round victory over Pep
perdine. Once again, the team's
balanced scoring came through for
the Cardinal.
"Our even scoring was key for us in
both the Navy and Pepperdine
games," Dettamanti said. "We had
10 players score in the first game and
seven score in the second. Everyone
was coming through for us."
Stanford led throughout the Pep
perdine match, slowly widening its
lead to six goals at 11-5. The Waves
scored with 1:48 for their final goal.
If Stanford played as well as it had
in the first two games it might have
won the final, according to Detta
manti. Despite the loss, Dettamanti
was pleased with his team's effort.
"We have one heck of a team, and
I couldn't have asked for anything
more this season," Dettamanti said.
"All the players had outstanding
seasons and it is just too bad that they
couldn't have topped them off with
an NCAA title."


Stanford went head-to-head in competition with Cal three times this
season, but the Bears prevailed twice. The last time was for the NCAA

Rod Searcey/Dai TyfiTe
championship as Cal won 9-8. The three meetings between the teams
were so close that the cumulative score had Cal up by only one goal.

According to Dettamanti, this match
followed the game plan perfectly.
"We were playing well enough to
play everybody and rest our starters
for the night game," Dettamanti said.
"We had a balanced scoring attack,
good counter attacks and some very
nice fast breaks."
The Cardinal jumped out to a 10-2
lead in the first half, led by Velez,
who scored all five of his goals in the
half.
According to Dettamanti, Velez's
high scoring was indicative of the
Midshipmen's basic deficiencies.
"Navy just wasn't used to the
quickness and speed of players like
Velez," Dettamanti said. "Jaime
(Velez) can be pretty tricky and if a
goalie isn't used to his style of play,
he's tough to stop."
.Velez was held to one goal in Stan
ford's second-round victory over Pep
perdine. Once again, the team's
balanced scoring came through for
the Cardinal.
"Our even scoring was key for us in
both the Navy and Pepperdine
games," Dettamanti said. "We had
10 players score in the first game and
seven score in the second. Everyone
was coming through for us."
Stanford led throughout the Pep
perdine match, slowly widening its
lead to six goals at 11-5. The Waves
scored with 1:48 for their final goal.
If Stanford played as well as it had
in the first two games it might have
won the final, according to Detta
manti. Despite the loss, Dettamanti
was pleased with his team's effort.
"We have one heck of a team, and
I couldn't have asked for anything
more this season," Dettamanti said.
"All the players had outstanding
seasons and it is just too bad that they
couldn't have topped them off with
an NCAA title."


Stanford went head-to-head in competition with Cal three times this
season, but the Bears prevailed twice. The last time was for the NCAA

Rod Searcey/Dai TyfiTe
championship as Cal won 9-8. The three meetings between the teams
were so close that the cumulative score had Cal up by only one goal.
LONG BEACH — The Stanford
water polo team's hopes for an
NCAA title fell through in last night*s
championship game as the Cardinal
was defeated by the University of
California at Berkely at the Belmont
Pool Plaza.
The Cardinal earned its berth into
the finals with a 16-8 victory over the
Naval Academy and an 11-6 victory
over Pepperdine University. Stanford
ended the season 2S-S overall.
Cal defeated Loyola of Chicago,
11-3, and the University of Southern
California, 10-9, to advance to the
final.
The Carindal, the No. 1 seed
heading into the National Collegiate
Athletic Association Tournament, is
composed largely of freshmen and
sophomores, and, according to Stan
ford Coach Dante Dettamanti, the
young team's lack of play in previous
NCAA action hurt Stanford.
"I feel our inexperience hurt us the
most in the final game," Dettamanti
said. "We have a lot of young players
who were just not sure how to react in
a big game.
"For most of the first half, our
players seemed to be out in the
ozone. They were extremely tentative
on both offense and defense and just
could not get anything started."
Cal jumped out to a 3-0 lead and
held it until the last 12 seconds of the
first quarter, when senior Mark Daley
gave the Cardinal its first goal.
Entering the second quarter with a
two goal deficit, the Cardinal brought
the game within one with a 12-foot
shot by Marvin Mouchawar.
The Bears responded quickly with
two goals to open up their lead to
three before Stanford's David Imber
nino scored to start a three-goal
streak for the Cardinal. With 5:06
remaining in the thrid quarter, sopho
more Chris Thompson scored to tie
the game for the first time at five
each.

Cal rebounded less than a minute
later to reclaim the lead. According
to Cal Caoch Peter Cutino, the Bears'
ability to rebound after each Cardinal
goal was extremely important.
"Each time Stanford scored, we
were able to come back quickly and
regain the lead," Cutino said. "The
whole match was somewhat like a
chess game: there were so many cru
cial situations that had such an effect
on the overall outcome of the game."
Cutino said Alan Greshman, who
scored three goals for Cal, was the
real force behind the Bears.
"Greshamn was really the key to
our victory; he started out strong and
set the tone for the rest of the game,"

Cutino said. "Stanford really focused
their defense on Greshman in the
second half, but by then the rest of
our guys were able to come through
and keep the momentum going."
Greshman was equally pleased
with his play.
"Cutino told us to go out from the
start and play our own game," Gresh
man said. "I just went out and did
what I knew I could do."
Bill Schoening was another Cal
player who came through for the
Bears when they needed him, scoring
the winning goal with 32 seconds
remaining in the game.
With the game tied at eight, Stan
ford's Jaime Velez was ejected for 35

seconds, giving the Bears a six-on
five situation. With three seconds
remaining in the penalty period,
Schoening scored on a "Hail Mary"
shot to win the game.
"We held the Bears 'til the very
end and then lost it on a freak shot,"
Dettamanti said. "Schoening's shot
went through two palyers, bounced
off the goal bar and went in — there's
nothing you can do with a shot like
that."
Cardinal goalie Steve Moyer did
feel that there was something he
could have done.
"The game came down to one
goal," Moyer said. "It was a goal I

should have stopped."
Two Stanford players were named
to the NCAA Championship Tourna
ment Team, sophomores Imbernino
and Craig Klass. Imbernino scored
seven goals in the tournament and
Klass scored three goals but earned
the honor on fine all-around play.
The remaining players named to
the first team were Charlie Harris,
Mike Spicer and Eric Davison of
USC and Greshman and Shaun
Cleary of Cal. Stanford players
Moyer, Erich Fisher, Velez,
Thompson and Greg Gamble were
named to the Honorable Mention
squad.
USC won the consolation game,

13-10, over Peppcrdine to take third
place.
