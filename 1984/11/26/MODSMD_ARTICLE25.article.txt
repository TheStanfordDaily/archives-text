# Business as usual as Card wins opener
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
It was a typical Tom Davis opening
game. Play an inferior opponent,
walk all over them and look good
doing it.
The Stanford basketball team, in its
third season under Coach Davis'
tutelage, did all of the above and
more Saturday night, slicing, dicing
and pureeing a University of Califor
nia at San Diego team into 39-point
submission, 87-48. A surprisingly
large crowd of 6,432, including Sec
retary of State George Shultz,
watched the massacre.
But there was one difference be
tween Opening Day 1984 and the
115-74 thrashing Stanford dealt
Hawaii-Pacific University in its
opener last year. The Cardinal was
without more than 70 percent of the

offense from last season's 19-12 team
Saturday. Center John Revelli and
guard Keith Jones — the No. 2 and
No. 4 all-time scorers in Stanford his
tory — both ran out of eligibility, for
ward Hans Wichary decided to forego
his final year of eligibility and top
returnee Steve Brown suffered a
season-ending stress fracture. As a
result, Stanford was forced to win its
fifth straight opener with, as Davis
put it, "a lot of new faces."
Instead of leaving the scoring to
one or two players like the team did
last season, Stanford spread it
around. A total of 11 Cardinal
players scored, including five in
double figures. Four veterans had
career-high performances and a fifth
tied his personal best.
Sophomore guard Novian Whitsitt
led the way with 16 points, going 7-

for-9 from the floor and 2-for-2 from
the free-throw line. Fischer added 13,
Earl Koberlein 12, Kent Seymour 11
and John Williams 10.
"This year we're going to be a little
different," said Fischer, who equalled
his career high of 13 in the first half
but was shut out in the second.
"We're not going to have one or two
people scoring. I think it's going to be
a balanced scoring team. We're not
just going to look for a John (Revelli)
or a Keith (Jones), and in some ways
that's better."
But Fischer, Davis and everyone
else agreed the key to success this
year is defense. "We've told our team
over and over that if we are going to
be a decent team this year, we're
going to have to play good defense."
said Davis, who logged his 250 th
career coaching victory Saturday.

"That man-to-man (defense) we
played tonight was better than we
played all last season."
The UCSD Tritons took leads of 2-
0 and 4-2 but never led again. Stan
ford put together a 19-4 run early in
the period and cruised to a 42-26
halftime advantage.
The Tritons ran into even bigger
trouble at the beginning of the second
half, going scoreless for the first six
minutes plus of the period. By the
time they finally managed to score,
with 13:41 remaining, it was too late.
Stanford had already run off 15 and
led by 31.
"We had two or three guys that had
never started and a few more that had
never played," a satisfied Davis said.
"But I thought they handled them
selves pretty well."
Among those who had never
played were Davis' two freshman big
men, 6-foot-8 Eric Reveno and 6-11
Greg Butler. Reveno played 15
minutes, scored five points and
grabbed three rebounds. Butler
played 10 minutes and had three
points and four boards.
"I think they have both proven that
they're going to be fine, fine basket
ball players," Davis said. "They're
going to get into some rough spots
when they play some of the experi
enced big men in our league. But that
was a very good start."
It was also a very nervous start, as
both Reveno and Butler didn't
hesitate to admit. Reveno made his
first free throw, but it slammed off
the backboard before going in. "I hit
all my free throws in warm-ups,"
Reveno said. "But in the game, there
was a (UCSD) guy standing in the
(free-throw) lane saying, 'It's going to
be short, it's going to be short.' So I
guess I overcompensated. Yeah, I
was nervous at first."
Butler said he was nervous too and
tried to be especially aggressive to get
rid of the butterflies. Butler made his
collegiate debut with 4:19 left in the
first half. Eight seconds later, he
grabbed his first rebound. And a
second after that, he protected the
ball a little too aggressively, shoving a

UCSD player, and had his first foul.
"But once I got going," Butler said,
"I felt comfortable out there."
The biggest surprise of the night
was 6-7 center Kent Seymour, the
only senior in the starting lineup.
Seymour, who played 96 minutes all
of last year, played 21 Saturday night
and collected 11 points, six rebounds
and four blocked shots. And, to the
delight of the crowd, three of his four
baskets were two-hand slam dunks.
"I thought he handled himself
really well," Davis said of Seymour.
"He played like a senior and that's
what we need from him this season."
Stanford dominated the Tritons in
every category, and about the only
thing it didn't win was the opening

tip. Stanford outshot UCSD 58.8 to
37.7 percent and outrebounded it 36
to 23. The Cardinal had six blocked
shots and 13 steals; the Tritons had
zero and four.
Still, Davis was not overly optimis
tic, especially with the four-team Ap
ple Invitational Tournament looming
on this weekend's horizon. Stanford
plays the University of the Pacific in
Friday night's opening round, and
then plays either Brigham Young
University or LaSalle University —
both post-season tournament teams
last season — Saturday night.
"We're not quite ready," Davis
said. "We're going to get a big test
this Friday against Pacific."

first half. Eight seconds later, he
grabbed his first rebound. And a
second after that, he protected the
ball a little too aggressively, shoving a

UCSD player, and had his first foul.
"But once I got going," Butler said,
"I felt comfortable out there."
The biggest surprise of the night
was 6-7 center Kent Seymour, the
only senior in the starting lineup.
Seymour, who played 96 minutes all
of last year, played 21 Saturday night
and collected 11 points, six rebounds
and four blocked shots. And, to the
delight of the crowd, three of his four
baskets were two-hand slam dunks.
"I thought he handled himself
really well," Davis said of Seymour.
"He played like a senior and that's
what we need from him this season."
Stanford dominated the Tritons in
every category, and about the only
thing it didn't win was the opening

tip. Stanford outshot UCSD 58.8 to
37.7 percent and outrebounded it 36
to 23. The Cardinal had six blocked
shots and 13 steals; the Tritons had
zero and four.
Still, Davis was not overly optimis
tic, especially with the four-team Ap
ple Invitational Tournament looming
on this weekend's horizon. Stanford
plays the University of the Pacific in
Friday night's opening round, and
then plays either Brigham Young
University or LaSalle University —
both post-season tournament teams
last season — Saturday night.
"We're not quite ready," Davis
said. "We're going to get a big test
this Friday against Pacific."

Stanford sophomore Novian Whitsitt sets a fine example here of what the Cardinal will have to do if it ex
pects to win many games: play defense. Along with his defense, Whitsitt added a career-high 16 points as
the team defeated University of California at San Diego in Maples Pavilion Saturday.

Stanford senior Kent Seymour added some unexpected muscle to the
Cardinal lineup with three slam dunks on Saturday.
It was a typical Tom Davis opening
game. Play an inferior opponent,
walk all over them and look good
doing it.
The Stanford basketball team, in its
third season under Coach Davis'
tutelage, did all of the above and
more Saturday night, slicing, dicing
and pureeing a University of Califor
nia at San Diego team into 39-point
submission, 87-48. A surprisingly
large crowd of 6,432, including Sec
retary of State George Shultz,
watched the massacre.
But there was one difference be
tween Opening Day 1984 and the
115-74 thrashing Stanford dealt
Hawaii-Pacific University in its
opener last year. The Cardinal was
without more than 70 percent of the

offense from last season's 19-12 team
Saturday. Center John Revelli and
guard Keith Jones — the No. 2 and
No. 4 all-time scorers in Stanford his
tory — both ran out of eligibility, for
ward Hans Wichary decided to forego
his final year of eligibility and top
returnee Steve Brown suffered a
season-ending stress fracture. As a
result, Stanford was forced to win its
fifth straight opener with, as Davis
put it, "a lot of new faces."
Instead of leaving the scoring to
one or two players like the team did
last season, Stanford spread it
around. A total of 11 Cardinal
players scored, including five in
double figures. Four veterans had
career-high performances and a fifth
tied his personal best.
Sophomore guard Novian Whitsitt
led the way with 16 points, going 7-

for-9 from the floor and 2-for-2 from
the free-throw line. Fischer added 13,
Earl Koberlein 12, Kent Seymour 11
and John Williams 10.
"This year we're going to be a little
different," said Fischer, who equalled
his career high of 13 in the first half
but was shut out in the second.
"We're not going to have one or two
people scoring. I think it's going to be
a balanced scoring team. We're not
just going to look for a John (Revelli)
or a Keith (Jones), and in some ways
that's better."
But Fischer, Davis and everyone
else agreed the key to success this
year is defense. "We've told our team
over and over that if we are going to
be a decent team this year, we're
going to have to play good defense."
said Davis, who logged his 250 th
career coaching victory Saturday.

"That man-to-man (defense) we
played tonight was better than we
played all last season."
The UCSD Tritons took leads of 2-
0 and 4-2 but never led again. Stan
ford put together a 19-4 run early in
the period and cruised to a 42-26
halftime advantage.
The Tritons ran into even bigger
trouble at the beginning of the second
half, going scoreless for the first six
minutes plus of the period. By the
time they finally managed to score,
with 13:41 remaining, it was too late.
Stanford had already run off 15 and
led by 31.
"We had two or three guys that had
never started and a few more that had
never played," a satisfied Davis said.
"But I thought they handled them
selves pretty well."
Among those who had never
played were Davis' two freshman big
men, 6-foot-8 Eric Reveno and 6-11
Greg Butler. Reveno played 15
minutes, scored five points and
grabbed three rebounds. Butler
played 10 minutes and had three
points and four boards.
"I think they have both proven that
they're going to be fine, fine basket
ball players," Davis said. "They're
going to get into some rough spots
when they play some of the experi
enced big men in our league. But that
was a very good start."
It was also a very nervous start, as
both Reveno and Butler didn't
hesitate to admit. Reveno made his
first free throw, but it slammed off
the backboard before going in. "I hit
all my free throws in warm-ups,"
Reveno said. "But in the game, there
was a (UCSD) guy standing in the
(free-throw) lane saying, 'It's going to
be short, it's going to be short.' So I
guess I overcompensated. Yeah, I
was nervous at first."
Butler said he was nervous too and
tried to be especially aggressive to get
rid of the butterflies. Butler made his
collegiate debut with 4:19 left in the
first half. Eight seconds later, he
grabbed his first rebound. And a
second after that, he protected the
ball a little too aggressively, shoving a

UCSD player, and had his first foul.
