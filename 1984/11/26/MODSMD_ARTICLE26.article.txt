# Volleyball team awaits NCAA Tournament
## Women close season with win 
### JASON COLE Daily staff 
The Stanford women's volleyball
team got an early scare but regrouped
to close out the regular season with a
victory over Purdue University Satur
day night at Maples Pavilion.
Stanford, which finished the season
17-4 overall and won the Western
Collegiate Athletic Association, lost
the first game of the match, 15-12,
but then took the next three games,
15-6,15-1 and 17-15, for the victory.
The Cardinal may have been a little
distracted by the National Collegiate
Athletic Association Tournament
which begins this week.
Stanford, which also finished the
season ranked first in the NCAA and
third in the Tachikara Coaches Poll,
will learn today it will probably be the
top seed in the tournament and will
probably have a first-round bye
before it begins play on Dec. 6 at San
Diego State University.
If Stanford hopes to justify its lofty
position it will have to play more con
sistently than it did Saturday, after
winning the WCAA title last
weekend by defeating the University
of Arizona and Arizona State Uni
versity.
"We didn't play very well," Asst.
Coach Don Shaw said. "After we
won the conference title, we (the
coaches) gave the girls a couple of
days off. Then, with the holidays and
all, we didn't practice again until Sat
urday morning. I knew we weren't

going to play very well."
Which is what Purdue hoped would
happen, according to Shaw. "I talked
to their coach afterward and she
thought they would catch us off guard
because we hadn't practiced for a
while, and we had just won some big
games," Shaw said.
Purdue, which finished second in
the Big Ten Conference and is now
25-11 overall, finished a Western
swing of games that also included the
University of the Pacific, the Univer
sity of California at Berkeley and San
Jose State.
The Boilermakers split the four
matches, beating San Jose State and
Cal. According to Shaw, they were
trying to enhance their chances of
getting a tournament bid by playing
some Western schools. Purdue will
find out today whether the trip had
any benefit.
Stanford was led statistically by
junior middle blocker Kim Oden,
who had 13 kills. But Oden played
very inconsistently, Shaw said. "She
didn't have a good all-around match.
But she's had a great season, so that's
all right."
But Stanford's real leadership may
have come from outside hitters Susan
Compton and Barbra Fontana, who
had 12 and 10 kills respectively.
"They not only played well on of
fense but played well on defense as
well.. .. The outside hitters carried us
pretty much," Shaw said.
