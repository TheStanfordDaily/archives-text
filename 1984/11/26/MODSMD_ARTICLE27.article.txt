## 
### DAVE DUTCHER Daily staff 
The Stanford women's basket
ball team got its first regular
season victory during Thanksgiv
ing vacation but also suffered an
other loss.
The Cardinal, now 1-2 overall,
lost to the University of Santa
Clara, 69-46, at Maples Pavilion
Wednesday. Stanford's first tri
umph since an exhibition victory
Nov. 12 over the Kolon team of
South Korea came Saturday at
Santa Barbara, 64-54, over the
University of California at Santa
Barbara.
Against Santa Clara, one Stan
ford player — junior guard Vir
ginia Sourlis — scored in double
figures with 12 points. Sourlis,
who suffered a knee injury in the
second half against Santa Barbara,
and senior forward Mary Bradach
were the only Cardinal players to
score more than six points.
The extent of Sourlis' injury was
not known last night. Stanford
Coach Dotty McCrea said Sourlis
will continue to rest her knee
before testing it to determine the
seriousness of the injury.
Santa Clara, which had fewer
free-throw attempts and scored
seven fewer points on free throws,
led at halftime, 35-20.
"I don't think the (New York)
Knicks could've beat Santa Clara
that night," McCrea said. "They

made everything they threw up,
and that compounded our poor
play. It was one of those games."
Freshman forward Kami An
derson was one of three Stanford
players, including sophomore for
ward Karen Goedewaagen and
junior guard Judy Griffith, to
score six points against Santa
Clara.
Against Santa Barbara,
however, Anderson scored a
game-high 20 points and was
joined in double figures by sopho
more guard Erica Mueser, who
had 10 points, and sophomore
forward-guard Sue Sebolt, who
had 11.
"After the Santa Clara game,
we came out and really played
well," McCrea said. Against Santa
Barbara, the Cardinal was the
team with a big lead at halftime. In
the second half, Stanford lost two
points of its 42-26 halftime lead.
After Sourlis' injury, Stanford
"sputtered a bit," according to
McCrea. "There are no bad wins,"
she added.
"Everyone played well. We had
balanced scoring," McCrea said.
"It was nice to win, and it was im
portant because it was a road
trip." ,
Stanford will host San Jose State
University tomorrow night at
7:30. The Cardinal will play Pep
perdine University in Maples
Pavilion Friday at 4:30 p.m.
