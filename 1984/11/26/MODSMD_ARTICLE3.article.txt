# Report urges end to SCIRE
## Committee to decide fate 
### MARC PEYSER Staff writer 
The next meeting of the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Studies (C
-US) may launch the beginning of the
end for five extra-departmental Uni
versity programs.
On Wednesday, C-US will meet for
a third time to discuss the future of
SCIRE (Student Center for Innova
tion in Research and Education) ,
SWOPSI (Stanford Workshop on Po
litical and Social Issues) , URO
(Undergraduate Research Opportu
nities) , ARLO (Action Research
Liaison Office) and UGS
(Undergraduate Special Program), as
recommended in a report by the
Review Committee on Ex
tradepartmental Education at Stan
ford, headed by Economics Prof.
Kenneth Arrow.
The new structure, as proposed by
Arrow's committee, will dissolve all
of the programs and combine their
functions into two groups: course of
ferings and research opportunities.
"We want to separate those parts
that are really part of the academic
curriculum from those that are of
some value but [should not receive]
credit," Arrow said.
Awarding credit for internships —
a power now vested in SCIRE — is
the target of this particular phase of
restructuring.
"Internships are valuable, but in
the same sense that other extracurric
ular programs are," Arrow explained.
He said that requirements for receiv
ing credit, such as reading lists and
journals, often "detract from the
value of the experience."
Another area which Arrow's com
mittee hopes to strengthen with the

new format is student-taught classes,
now primarily a function of SWOPSI.
Much of the problem with the cur
rent structure, according to the com
mittee report, is in the quality of the
classes and their perceived legitimacy
to students and faculty. In order to
improve this area, the committee has
recommended that the credit
granting, course-structuring side of
the program be overseen by a tenured
faculty member who will work with
the program for half his educational
time.
"The grading and intellectual level
(of the SWOPSI classes) tends to be
lower than other courses in the Uni
versity," Arrow said. "A faculty
member will increase the extent to
which courses are of the same mold."
Like the side dealing with classes
and credit, the research half of the
new extradepartmental program will
coordinate many of the functions of
the existing programs.
"There is unanimous enthusiasm
for the URO program among stu
dents and faculty alike," the commit
tee report states, and it appears that
this program will be the basis for the
new area research-oriented wing.
In addition to "strengthening the
input" of URO, Arrow said he hopes
that the new program is able to main
tain the "excellent contacts" that
ARLO has made over the years as
well as to use SCIRE's innovation
fund.
The confusion caused by the over
lapping functions of various depart
ments in both the research and the
education areas is one of the main
problems Arrow hopes the restruc
turing will solve. — —
