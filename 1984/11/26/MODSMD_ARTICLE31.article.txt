# Students plan hunger conference
## 
### 
A newly formed student organiza
tion, Stanford Students Making a Dif
ference (SSMAD), is currently plan
ning a week-long conference for the
beginning of spring quarter called
"You Can Make a Difference —
1985: World and Local Hunger." To
be patterned after last year's "You
Can Make a Difference Conference,"
it is designed to increase student and
community awareness concerning is
sues on the problems of hunger and
inform students on ways they can
contribute to its alleviation.
SSMAD represents a consortium
of student organizations and includes
individual student members from a
variety of campus/community groups.
The student organizations include the
Stanford Volunteer Network (SVN),
the Stanford Committee on Hunger,
Stanford-in-Government (SIG), the
Stanford International Development
Organization (SIDO) and the ASSU.
Other organizations which are
represented on the steering commit
tee include Public Service, Volun
teers in Asia (VIA), the Ecumenical
Hunger Program (EHP), the Food
Research Institute (FRI) and the
Career Planning and Placement Cen
ter (CPPC).
The conference idea originates
with co-coordinator Sarah von der

Lippe, a senior majoring in interna
tional relations. Since the beginning
of her sophomore year, she has been
interested in the problems associated
with hunger and has "wanted to do
something — now." She attributes
her ideas and goals to a "liberal
upbringing" and parents who
"instilled in me the concept of
working for justice. I see injustice in
the fact that hunger exists." She also
stresses another lesson from her
upbringing, saying, "Given the fact
that neither of my parents work in the
'hunger' field but were able to teach
me to recognize hunger's injustice, I
hope that this conference may serve a
similar purpose for those who at
tend." She expects that the confer
ence will "make people think," and
sees that as a "huge step" because "it
is difficult to expect responsible be
havior from people who are uned
ucated about these problems."
The other co-coordinator of the
spring event is Carolyn Del Gaudio, a
senior majoring in international rela
tions who is currently in Japan. Her
initial interest in the problem of
hunger comes from her experience in
Haiti as a teenager, and from that ex
perience she has cultivated the desire
to participate in the effort to elimi
nate the hunger pangs of others.

University President Donald Ken
nedy, a steering committee member,
has expressed enthusiasm for the
project, saying, "It is a splendid idea
and it has my full support."
When asked about the need for the
conference, Walter Falcon, director
of FRI and a steering committee
member, commented, "There is a
lack of information and misinforma
tion about the causes and conse
quences of hunger." He says he sees
it as a full-time issue which encom
passes poverty and development, es
pecially of mothers and infants. Fal
con observed that Stanford has been
slower than other campuses, such as
agricultural schools, in considering
this problem.
Keith Taylor, professor of
Gastroenterology at the Medical
School, is another steering committee
member. He says he is interested in
broadening the medical school's cur
riculum to include some Third-World
focus, especially on nutritional issues,
and hopes to help draw a medical
school audience.
The conference is planned for
April 8-13, 1985. At present, the five
days will follow the format below:
• Monday, April 8: What are the is
sues and the facts?

• Tuesday, April 9: What are the dif
ferent opinions about causes/
approaches?
• Wednesday, April 10: What are our
roles as individual citizens?
• Thursday, April 11: What are the
roles of different organizations?
• Friday, April 12: What do people in
hunger-oriented careers do?
• Saturday, April 13: EHP Shara
thon.
Major speakers under considera
tion for invitation include former
presidents, senators and field
workers. Slated activities include
small group workshops, films, panel
discussions and a dinner. The dinner
being considered would demonstrate
different income brackets' diets.
Tickets would be sold at a standard
rate with people randomly arriving to
a meal that is lavish, modest or
sparse.
Specific issues that may be ad
dressed include the domestic policies
which contribute to the problem, the
economics/politics of foreign-aid
policies, what becomes of individual
contributions to non-profit aid organ
izations, and specific-region studies
(e.g., drought in Africa, background
and implications).

A newly formed student organiza
tion, Stanford Students Making a Dif
ference (SSMAD), is currently plan
ning a week-long conference for the
beginning of spring quarter called
"You Can Make a Difference —
1985: World and Local Hunger." To
be patterned after last year's "You
Can Make a Difference Conference,"
it is designed to increase student and
community awareness concerning is
sues on the problems of hunger and
inform students on ways they can
contribute to its alleviation.
SSMAD represents a consortium
of student organizations and includes
individual student members from a
variety of campus/community groups.
The student organizations include the
Stanford Volunteer Network (SVN),
the Stanford Committee on Hunger,
Stanford-in-Government (SIG), the
Stanford International Development
Organization (SIDO) and the ASSU.
Other organizations which are
represented on the steering commit
tee include Public Service, Volun
teers in Asia (VIA), the Ecumenical
Hunger Program (EHP), the Food
Research Institute (FRI) and the
Career Planning and Placement Cen
ter (CPPC).
The conference idea originates
with co-coordinator Sarah von der

Lippe, a senior majoring in interna
tional relations. Since the beginning
of her sophomore year, she has been
interested in the problems associated
with hunger and has "wanted to do
something — now." She attributes
her ideas and goals to a "liberal
upbringing" and parents who
"instilled in me the concept of
working for justice. I see injustice in
the fact that hunger exists." She also
stresses another lesson from her
upbringing, saying, "Given the fact
that neither of my parents work in the
'hunger' field but were able to teach
me to recognize hunger's injustice, I
hope that this conference may serve a
similar purpose for those who at
tend." She expects that the confer
ence will "make people think," and
sees that as a "huge step" because "it
is difficult to expect responsible be
havior from people who are uned
ucated about these problems."
The other co-coordinator of the
spring event is Carolyn Del Gaudio, a
senior majoring in international rela
tions who is currently in Japan. Her
initial interest in the problem of
hunger comes from her experience in
Haiti as a teenager, and from that ex
perience she has cultivated the desire
to participate in the effort to elimi
nate the hunger pangs of others.

University President Donald Ken
nedy, a steering committee member,
has expressed enthusiasm for the
project, saying, "It is a splendid idea
and it has my full support."
When asked about the need for the
conference, Walter Falcon, director
of FRI and a steering committee
member, commented, "There is a
lack of information and misinforma
tion about the causes and conse
quences of hunger." He says he sees
it as a full-time issue which encom
passes poverty and development, es
pecially of mothers and infants. Fal
con observed that Stanford has been
slower than other campuses, such as
agricultural schools, in considering
this problem.
Keith Taylor, professor of
Gastroenterology at the Medical
School, is another steering committee
member. He says he is interested in
broadening the medical school's cur
riculum to include some Third-World
focus, especially on nutritional issues,
and hopes to help draw a medical
school audience.
The conference is planned for
April 8-13, 1985. At present, the five
days will follow the format below:
• Monday, April 8: What are the is
sues and the facts?

• Tuesday, April 9: What are the dif
ferent opinions about causes/
approaches?
• Wednesday, April 10: What are our
roles as individual citizens?
• Thursday, April 11: What are the
roles of different organizations?
• Friday, April 12: What do people in
hunger-oriented careers do?
• Saturday, April 13: EHP Shara
thon.
Major speakers under considera
tion for invitation include former
presidents, senators and field
workers. Slated activities include
small group workshops, films, panel
discussions and a dinner. The dinner
being considered would demonstrate
different income brackets' diets.
Tickets would be sold at a standard
rate with people randomly arriving to
a meal that is lavish, modest or
sparse.
Specific issues that may be ad
dressed include the domestic policies
which contribute to the problem, the
economics/politics of foreign-aid
policies, what becomes of individual
contributions to non-profit aid organ
izations, and specific-region studies
(e.g., drought in Africa, background
and implications).
