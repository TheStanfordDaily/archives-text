# Energy conservation center promotes goals

### JOHN CALLON 
The Housing Energy Conservation Cen
ter (HECC) is planning a series of monthly
programs designed to "get people aware of
the facts" of energy conservation, accord
ing to Education Program Coordinator
Cathy O'Connor.
The HECC is currently running a pilot
program limited to 12 student residences
for the month of November. This month's
"theme" involves an energy-trivia compe
tition between the houses.
Residences must respond to. a question
naire featuring 15 factual and common
sense questions on both general and
Stanford-specific energy topics. The win
ning dormitory will win an "ice-cream ex
travaganza" courtesy of the HECC.
Referring to the contest, Ari Levitt, en
ergy representative from Florence Moore's

Alondra dormitory, said he feels the
HECC is "definitely on the right track. It's
hard to have people take energy conserva
tion seriously."
Last year, the HECC sponsored a
campus-wide, three-month conservation
effort, challenging each residence to con
serve 5 percent or more of its energy use
relative to the previous year's consump
tion, and promising to match 50 to 90 per
cent of the money saved. Ten residences
met the minimum goal, and the HECC
paid out $1,400.
Campus-wide conservation efforts have
met with some long-term success. Between
the 1975-76 and 1982-83 school years, gas
consumption in the residences and food
services declined 3 percent, while
electricity use dropped 12 percent.

O'Connor said she sees a definite need
for the sort of informational services which
the HECC provides. In terms of overall
awareness, she feels "some people are
(aware), but some people aren't. We're
hoping to make people more aware, so
they will be able to choose. We're not
saying take cold showers in the dark."
Levitt finds that "most people here are
very aware of what energy is all about, but
reminding them is good. We can certainly
always cut down."
O'Connor emphasized that beyond the
"moral" incentives for conserving energy,
consumption habits have a direct
impact on students in a veiy vital area â€”
their pocketbooks. "If people conserve,
they're not just conserving for the greater
good. .. . Dorm rates are tied to energy
costs," she said.

Last year, gas and electricity expendi
tures for residences and food services were
approximately $1.7 million.
O'Connor said comparing energy use
patterns among residences is very difficult
because consumption is tied to how energy
efficient a house is and not just a function
of who has more 100-watt stereo systems.
"If you look at Governor's Corner, you
have a state-of-the-art housing situation.
It's easier to conserve."
The HECC is an arm of Housing and
Food Services and has a part-time staff of
eight students responsible for nearly 90
field staff and dormitory energy represent
atives.
Aside from special programs, it
routinely puts out energy tips and has a
$6,000 energy fund available to students
with energy-saving ideas.
