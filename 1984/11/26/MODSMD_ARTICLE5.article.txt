# Senate chair strives to stabilize ASSU 'routine'
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
Eric Berg's first experience with
the workings of the ASSU in 1981
wasn't a pleasant one. The then
treasurer of the Graduate Student
Association found Stanford's student

government "incapable of communi
cating" the information on financing
he needed to know for his own or
ganization.
Now, as chair of the 15th senate,
Berg has begun to rectify the
numerous problems he sees as plagu
ing the organization.

Berg, 30, is a graduate student
working toward a Ph.D. in econom
ics, which he should receive at the
end of next year. He began his studies
at Stanford in 1975 and left two years
later to study sociology at an eastern
college. Upon returning to the Farm
in 1980, Berg was concerned that
there "wasn't any institution that
looked out for graduate-student in
terests" in the University's decision
making process.
"One of the fundamental roles a
student government needs to play,"
Berg says, is that of a " mechanism to
express [students'] concerns."
Among the first problems Berg
dealt with was the ASSU's inability to
communicate "to people and groups
information about the way in which
things are going to happen" in gov
ernment affairs. He said organization
members lacked a firm grasp on the
knowledge about dates of elections
and deadlines that are vital to stu
dents. Students applying for ASSU
committees arid boards need to know
these dates before it is too late to take
necessary action, he said.
Berg said he has worked to
"stabilize the routine of the way we
do things around here." He noted
that for the past two years, the ASSU

has established a calendar of
deadlines for each school year during
the preceding summer.
Another problem Berg sees within
the ASSU is a "fairly weak executive
branch." In the past, members of the
Council of Presidents were " not very
much interested in being the adminis
trators of the ASSU," Berg said, add
ing that the members took interest in
their own special groups and activi
ties.
The result, Berg said, was that
some groups didn't receive the atten
tion or guidance they should have.
The current COP members, ac
cording to Berg, are "more willing to
take a role and actually manage the
ASSU." He called this "a positive
sign."
Berg also noted a problem afflict
ing the senate itself. He said that
when new senators enter the ASSU,
they have different expectations and
ideas of how the student government
should function. Some members see
the senate as service-oriented, while
others view it as a legislative body
whose chief responsibility should be
the establishment of operating
policies.

Action in the chambers of the ASSU from Senate Chair Eric Berg's perspective.
While Berg called this variety of at
titudes "healthy," he said it can
become destructive when students
work only on their own special proj
ects and exclude other interests.
Berg is also "very concerned" with
the current status of the fee assess
ment process, which he considers to
be a "potentially very unstable sys
tem."
He said the current system has
evolved from a series of compromises
over a period of time. As a result, the
system could be "ending up in a crisis
in a couple of years."
Berg specifically noted a trend

emerging in which only groups with a
broad base of support win fee assess
ments. He said five groups, the larg
est number ever, were turned down
last spring in student elections. Berg
pointed to the Women's Center as a
"good program" with a "modest re
quest" that was voted down.
He also called the refund system
"real unstable." Berg suspects that if
the quarterly ASSU fee continues to
rise, a larger percentage of students
will begin to take refunds. Approxi
mately 25 percent of the student body
currently collects refunds.
Berg said a refund system doesn't
make much sense for certain groups
which are "public goods"— those
that are used by all students and are
serving the entire community.

become destructive when students
work only on their own special proj
ects and exclude other interests.
Berg is also "very concerned" with
the current status of the fee assess
ment process, which he considers to
be a "potentially very unstable sys
tem."
He said the current system has
evolved from a series of compromises
over a period of time. As a result, the
system could be "ending up in a crisis
in a couple of years."
Berg specifically noted a trend

emerging in which only groups with a
broad base of support win fee assess
ments. He said five groups, the larg
est number ever, were turned down
last spring in student elections. Berg
pointed to the Women's Center as a
"good program" with a "modest re
quest" that was voted down.
He also called the refund system
"real unstable." Berg suspects that if
the quarterly ASSU fee continues to
rise, a larger percentage of students
will begin to take refunds. Approxi
mately 25 percent of the student body
currently collects refunds.
Berg said a refund system doesn't
make much sense for certain groups
which are "public goods"— those
that are used by all students and are
serving the entire community.
