Centrist wins Uruguay elections
MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay — Julio Sanguinetti, a centrist candidate
for president, claimed victory today in elections to replace an 11-year
old military regime and restore a long tradition of democracy.
As Sanguinetti, of the Colorado party, was giving his victory speech, a
chief challenger, Alberto Zumaran of the National Party, another
moderate group, made a surprise appearance to concede defeat in yes
terday's election.
In official returns from 2,560 of the country's 7,873 polling places,
Sanguinetti's party captured 237,753 votes, or 39.6 percent.
The National Party had 208,492 votes, or 34.7 percent. The Broad
Front, a coalition of leftist parties running Juan Crottogini as its presi
dential candidate, had 98,880 votes, or 16.5 percent. The rest of the vote
was split among smaller parties.
Sanguinetti told cheering supporters: "The country has now entered a
period of dignity."
Embracing Sanguinetti, Zumaran said, "I feel honored to comply with
the decision of the people."
Sanguinetti served as minister of culture and as minister of labor un
der the Colorado government that was toppled when the armed forces
took control in 1973. He played a key role in recent negotiations with
the military that resulted in the election plan.
Zumaran was a virtual unknown in politics until three years ago, when
he assumed the directorship of a National Party weekly magazine. He is
running as a stand-in candidate for party leader Wilson Ferreira Al
dunate, who was jailed June 16 upon returning from 11 years in self
exile.
The elections were the first national voting in Uruguay in 13 years.
After the polls closed at 7:30 p.m., cars jammed the main boulevard
of the capital, horns blaring and party banners streaming from windows
and bumpers as the people toasted the revival of their once-proud dem
ocratic tradition.
Pedestrians waved pennants and gathered to chant party slogans in the
warm spring night here in the southern hemisphere. One chant went:
"How it makes me laugh, that the dictatorship is about to end."
Talks with rebels set for Friday
SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador — Archbishop Arturo Rivera y
Damas announced yesterday that the next round of peace talks between
government and guerrilla representatives will take place Friday at a site
in El Salvador to be announced later.
The archbishop, in his regular Sunday homily at San Salvador's Na
tional Cathedral, said the date and place for the meeting had been
agreed upon by the government of President Jose Napoleon Duarte and
rebel leaders.
Rivera y Damas, who is the mediator in the dialogue between the gov
ernment and the rebels that began Oct. 15 in the small northern town of
La Palma, said the site for the talks was not being revealed yet for
"security reasons."
Both government and rebel representatives have indicated in recent
weeks their concern about security at the next meeting, now that ex
tremist opponents of the talks have had a month and a half to organize
opposition and, possibly, to plan means of sabotaging them.
Suggested sites for the next round of talks have ranged from the El
Salvador International Airport at Comalapa, south of the capital, to
hamlets in northern Morazan province, which has long been a bastion of
the guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front.
Rivera y Damas, however, confirmed earlier in the week that San Sal
vador had been ruled out as a site. The Marti Front, and leaders of its
political wing, the Democratic Revolutionary Front, had suggested San
Salvador as a site for the talks in a message to Duarte, but government
officials have made it clear that they consider San Salvador too difficult a
place to ensure security for the talks. The possibility of mass political
demonstrations in the streets was another reason to exclude the capital
as a site.
Poland called 'enslaved nation'
WARSAW, Poland — An estimated 25,000 worshipers at the parish
church of Father Jerzy Popieluszko, who was murdered last month, al
legedly by three security officers, heard Communist Poland described
yesterday as "an enslaved nation" ruled by an "imposed ideology."
Father Teofil Bogucki, pastor of St. Stanislaw Kostka Church, where
Popieluszko had delivered his "Masses for the Homeland" on the last
Sunday of each month for three years, praised the slain priest for his ar
dent defense of human rights.
Popieluszko's sermons, Bogucki said, were "a cry of protest from an
enslaved nation, who, through the mouth of a priest, demanded observ
ance and respect for human rights."
"After 40 years of an imposed ideology, alien to a Christian nation
and trampling on truth, the society ... longs for consolation," Bogucki
said from an outdoor altar arranged on a balcony overlooking the crowd.
"People are tired of hopelessness. They cling to every word that gives
them truth and hope. That is why they listened so intently to the words
Father Jerzy spoke.
"Nothing," Bogucki declared, "can stop Poland, which marches
toward the sun of love and truth, toward the sun of solidarity and
freedom.
"Father Popieluszko fell victim to a satanical hatred. Thus died a na
tional hero, the martyr of a sacred cause."
His words were vigorously applauded by a crowd that filled an adja
cent park and streets on two sides of the church in the northern part of
the city.
Somalia refuses hijack demands
ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia — Somalia yesterday rejected hijackers'
demands for the release of political prisoners and said it holds Ethiopia
responsible for the safety of more than 100 hostages aboard a Somali
jetliner here.
The armed hijackers holding the Somali Airlines Boeing 707 at Addis
Ababa's main airport told Ethopian negotiators they were "extremely
outraged" by Somalia's refusal to meet their demands. But they again
extended by 12 hours their deadline for blowing up the plane with every
one aboard.
The Ethiopian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the new
deadline — the fourth set by the sky pirates since they commandeered
the jetliner Saturday — was noon Monday (4 a.m. EST).
It said apparently five people were holding the plane — the three
hijackers who seized control of the craft plus two passengers who subse
quently joined them.
The hijackers freed 19 passengers and three crew members Saturday.
Officials said there are still 103 passengers and crew aboard the craft
along with the three hijackers and their two accomplices.
Initial accounts by the official Ethiopian News Agency said the hijack
ers wanted Somalia to free 13 prominent political prisoners and grant
reprieves to seven students scheduled to be hanged in Somalia yesterday
for anti-government activities.
Sikhs arrested in Fremont protest
FREMONT — Police arrested six members of a Sikh religious group
outside a temple yesterday after shots were fired in a clash between wor
shippers and a group of Sikhs who oppose a separate Indian state for
their people.
Fremont police received the disturbance call at about 2 p.m. yesterday
and were met at the temple by "a large and hostile crowd," according to
a report by officer Daniel Pasquale.
"The crowd was armed with sticks and metal bars. At least one person
in the crowd was armed with a high-powered rifle and at least two shots
were fired by this person," Pasquale's report continued. No one was re
ported injured in the incident.
After the shots were fired, Fremont police dispersed the crowd and
the six were arrested. The six were booked for attempted murder, as
sault with a deadly weapon and conspiracy.
Today's weather
Cloudy with light rain or showers likely. The high will be in the upper
