# Patient critical but stable
## Second artificial heart implanted 
### 
LOUISVILLE, Ky. — For the
second time in history, surgeons im
planted a permanent artificial heart
yesterday in the chest of a man, but
the patient was sent back to surgery
to find the source of excessive bleed
ing less than six hours after the first
operation, a hospital spokesman said.
William Schroeder, 52, from
Jasper, Ind., opened his eyes and
squeezed his doctors' hands after the
six-and-one-half-hour implant opera
tion ended at 2:30 p.m. EST.
But Schroeder, who was reported
in critical but stable condition, was
sent back to the operating room at
8:30 p.m. and by 8:55 p.m. had been
anaestheized and was undergoing
surgery again, said George Atkins,
director of public affairs for Humana
Inc.
"They have found the source of the
bleeding and corrected it," Atkins
said at 9:55 p.m., one hour after the
surgery.
Earlier in the day, doctors had said
that Schroeder was having some
excess bleeding, but at that point it
did not appear to be a serious prob
lem.
"You're doing very well. Every
thing went perfect," Dr. William
DeVries told Schroeder as he was
wheeled out of the operating room

after the implant. DeVries headed
the team of 19 doctors, nurses and
technicians who implanted the click
ing, air-driven Jarvik-7 heart.
"This is, fortunately, a happy occa
sion," Dr. Allan Lansing, chairman of
the Humana Heart Institute Interna
tional, said at a briefing at that time.
Lansing assisted DeVries in the oper
ation.
The most difficult part of the oper
ation, Lansing said, was cutting
through dense scar tissue to remove
the diseased heart. "It was tedious,
but Dr. DeVries went slowly and
meticulously," Lansing said.
The scar tissue, which adhered to
the walls surrounding the heart,
resulted from double coronary
bypass surgery Schroeder had un
dergone in March 1983.
"We still have some bleeding that
is more than standard" because of the
scar tissue that was snipped away,
Lansing said. "It is not something
that has been any threat, but he's still
receiving transfusions."
Schroeder's wife, Margaret, the
couple's six children and several of
his five grandchildren waited with
their family priest in a room six floors
above the operating room at Humana
Hospital Audubon here.
"There were a few tears in their
eves, particularly of the younger fam

ily members," when the surgeons told
them the good news, Lansing said.
Dr. Robert Jarvik, who invented
the heart, said the operation "gives
me even more hope that this will
eventually become a broadly applica
ble kind of procedure."
Barney Clark, a 61-year-old
Seattle dentist, received the first per
manent artificial heart Dec. 2, 1982.
Clark's condition had been
deteriorating so quickly that his natu
ral heart stopped minutes before the
doctors were ready to remove it.
DeVries, 40, the only surgeon ap
proved by the Food and Drug Ad
ministration to implant artificial
hearts, performed Clark's operation
at the University of Utah Medical
Center.
Clark lived for 112 days, never
leaving the hospital, and his mechani
cal heart beat 12,912,400 times
before he died of circulatory collapse
after several of his organs failed.
Schroeder's implant was originally
planned for later in the week but was
moved up to yesterday because his
doctors believed that he would not
survive much longer. The Jarvik-7
heart, powered by regular bursts of
compressed air, began to beat in
Schroeder's chest at 12:58 a.m. EST,
almost five hours after surgery began.

Schroeder has diabetes, a condition
that worries doctors because it makes
him more susceptible to infection.
But Lansing and Jarvik said
Schroeder entered surgery in much
better physical shape than did Clark.
Before removing Schroeder's
diseased heart, the surgeons tapped
into the major vessels leading to the
organ and inserted tubes connected
to a heart-lung machine. Two-and-a
half hours after the first incision,
Schroeder's heart was cut away and
the painstaking process of sewing the
$15,500 plastic and metal heart, one
chamber at a time, began.
When both chambers were in
place, their Velcro sides were stuck
together and the air hoses leading
from the drive machine were inserted
under Schroeder's skin. The machine,
a 323-pound console the size of a
small refrigerator, is connected to
Schroeder through two hoses in his
abdomen.
Schroeder may eventually be
hooked up to an 11-pound version of
the console that can be carried like a
handbag. It was unavailable when
Clark had his implant and is the "key
to high quality of life" for an implant
patient, Jarvik said.

scar tissue that was snipped away,
Lansing said. "It is not something
that has been any threat, but he's still
receiving transfusions."
Schroeder's wife, Margaret, the
couple's six children and several of
his five grandchildren waited with
their family priest in a room six floors
above the operating room at Humana
Hospital Audubon here.
"There were a few tears in their
eves, particularly of the younger fam

ily members," when the surgeons told
them the good news, Lansing said.
Dr. Robert Jarvik, who invented
the heart, said the operation "gives
me even more hope that this will
eventually become a broadly applica
ble kind of procedure."
Barney Clark, a 61-year-old
Seattle dentist, received the first per
manent artificial heart Dec. 2, 1982.
Clark's condition had been
deteriorating so quickly that his natu
ral heart stopped minutes before the
doctors were ready to remove it.
DeVries, 40, the only surgeon ap
proved by the Food and Drug Ad
ministration to implant artificial
hearts, performed Clark's operation
at the University of Utah Medical
Center.
Clark lived for 112 days, never
leaving the hospital, and his mechani
cal heart beat 12,912,400 times
before he died of circulatory collapse
after several of his organs failed.
Schroeder's implant was originally
planned for later in the week but was
moved up to yesterday because his
doctors believed that he would not
survive much longer. The Jarvik-7
heart, powered by regular bursts of
compressed air, began to beat in
Schroeder's chest at 12:58 a.m. EST,
almost five hours after surgery began.

Schroeder has diabetes, a condition
that worries doctors because it makes
him more susceptible to infection.
But Lansing and Jarvik said
Schroeder entered surgery in much
better physical shape than did Clark.
Before removing Schroeder's
diseased heart, the surgeons tapped
into the major vessels leading to the
organ and inserted tubes connected
to a heart-lung machine. Two-and-a
half hours after the first incision,
Schroeder's heart was cut away and
the painstaking process of sewing the
$15,500 plastic and metal heart, one
chamber at a time, began.
When both chambers were in
place, their Velcro sides were stuck
together and the air hoses leading
from the drive machine were inserted
under Schroeder's skin. The machine,
a 323-pound console the size of a
small refrigerator, is connected to
Schroeder through two hoses in his
abdomen.
Schroeder may eventually be
hooked up to an 11-pound version of
the console that can be carried like a
handbag. It was unavailable when
Clark had his implant and is the "key
to high quality of life" for an implant
patient, Jarvik said.

LOUISVILLE, Ky. — For the
second time in history, surgeons im
planted a permanent artificial heart
yesterday in the chest of a man, but
the patient was sent back to surgery
to find the source of excessive bleed
ing less than six hours after the first
operation, a hospital spokesman said.
William Schroeder, 52, from
Jasper, Ind., opened his eyes and
squeezed his doctors' hands after the
six-and-one-half-hour implant opera
tion ended at 2:30 p.m. EST.
But Schroeder, who was reported
in critical but stable condition, was
sent back to the operating room at
8:30 p.m. and by 8:55 p.m. had been
anaestheized and was undergoing
surgery again, said George Atkins,
director of public affairs for Humana
Inc.
"They have found the source of the
bleeding and corrected it," Atkins
said at 9:55 p.m., one hour after the
surgery.
Earlier in the day, doctors had said
that Schroeder was having some
excess bleeding, but at that point it
did not appear to be a serious prob
lem.
"You're doing very well. Every
thing went perfect," Dr. William
DeVries told Schroeder as he was
wheeled out of the operating room

after the implant. DeVries headed
the team of 19 doctors, nurses and
technicians who implanted the click
ing, air-driven Jarvik-7 heart.
"This is, fortunately, a happy occa
sion," Dr. Allan Lansing, chairman of
the Humana Heart Institute Interna
tional, said at a briefing at that time.
Lansing assisted DeVries in the oper
ation.
The most difficult part of the oper
ation, Lansing said, was cutting
through dense scar tissue to remove
the diseased heart. "It was tedious,
but Dr. DeVries went slowly and
meticulously," Lansing said.
The scar tissue, which adhered to
the walls surrounding the heart,
resulted from double coronary
bypass surgery Schroeder had un
dergone in March 1983.
"We still have some bleeding that
is more than standard" because of the
scar tissue that was snipped away,
Lansing said. "It is not something
that has been any threat, but he's still
receiving transfusions."
