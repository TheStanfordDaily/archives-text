# Adviser doubts speedy arms accord
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — President Reagan's national
security adviser, sharply critical of earlier U.S.-
Soviet negotiations, said yesterday that achieving
an arms-control agreement with Moscow could
take the full four years of Reagan's second term.
Robert McFarlane, Reagan's assistant for na
tional security affairs, also held out little chance
that the United States would take any unilateral
arms control steps, such as limitation of medium
range missiles in Western Europe or American de
velopment of space weapons, before talks get un
der way.
Secretary of State George Shultz and Soviet
Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko are scheduled
to hold preliminary discussions on a wide range of
arms-control topics — including medium- and
long-range weapons, chemical munitions and space
armaments — in Geneva on Jan. 7 and 8.
McFarlane, interviewed in Washington on the
CBS News program "Face the Nation," said that a
moratorium on deploying Pershing II and cruise

missiles in Europe "would probably pull the rug
out" from arms-control negotiations by removing
incentives for the Soviet Union to join the talks.
"We're looking for equality . . . but (a)
moratorium on one side is not the way," he said.
Questioned in Moscow for the same program,
Vladimir Borgachev, a military correspondent for
Tass, the Soviet government news agency, said con
tinued deployment of the U.S. missiles in Europe
"will be a sign of bad will.
"What will happen later I don't know,"he said.
When the United States a year ago began install
ing the weapons — the first of 572 scheduled for
deployment as part of the modernization of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization's nuclear force
— the Soviet Union walked out of negotiations
over the superpowers' medium-range and long
range nuclear arsenals.
The United States maintains that the Soviets
have a 10-to-l advantage of medium-range nuclear
missiles in Europe and have continued a steady

deployment of SS-20 missiles. The Soviets argue
that in citing such a ratio, the United States fails to
include independent British and French weapons in
the NATO count.
Borgachev said if the United States declared a
moratorium on its European deployments, the
Soviets would offer "a positive response."
McFarlane said the United States will be
"prepared to talk about what restraints would be
appropriate when the negotiations start."
Offering a note of caution about the outcome of
the talks, McFarlane said the United States is en
tering negotiations "with a sense of realism that is
born of the losses this country has suffered from
talking in the late 19705."
"We learned a lot in those days," he said. "We
learned that Soviets violate treaties. We learned
that they bargain very hard; that compromise is
really an alien concept to them. In short, talking
per se is not necessarily good."
