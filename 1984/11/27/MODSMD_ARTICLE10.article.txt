# U.S. planned an anti-terrorist strike
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The U.S. mili
tary made detailed preparations
recently to launch a retaliatory bomb
ing strike in Lebanon in the most ad
vanced example to date of a new get
tough policy toward terrorism, Pent
agon sources said yesterday.
The aircraft carrier USS Eisen
hower was ordered shortly before
Thanksgiving to hold its position in
the central Mediterranean so she
could launch a retaliatory strike if in
telligence warnings about new terror
ist attacks on the U.S. and British em
bassies in Beirut proved true, defense
officials said.
"It was a case of if they did X, we

would be ready to do Y," one official
explained without disclosing the
retaliatory target. Navy preparations
extended to flying extra A-6E
bombers to the carrier, defense offi
cials said, and briefing crews on what
to strike.
The terrorists' attacks did not take
place as feared and the retaliatory
bombing plan was shelved. But the
fact that the military was ordered to
go so far as to prepare a retaliatory
strike is the strongest indication to
date that the administration is
seriously considering going beyond
rhetoric and employing military
power to combat terrorism with

Israeli-like tactics.
"Terrorism is an unbridled form of
warfare," Secretary of State George
Shultz said in his Oct. 25 policy
speech making the administration
case for tougher anti-terrorist efforts.
"We need a strategy to cope with ter
rorism in all of its varied manifesta
tions. . . . We must reach a consensus
in this country that our responses
should go beyond passive defense to
consider means of active prevention,
pre-emption and retaliation."
The secretary, in a passage that
caught the eye of military leaders,
said experience has taught that "one

of the best deterrents to terrorism is
the certainty that swift and sure
measures will be taken against those
who engage in it."
Military leaders are taking the ad
ministration's rhetoric seriously and
stepping up their anti-terrorism
preparations all down the line. At the
same time, they are warning, at least
within their own circle, that pre
emptive and retaliatory attacks
against terrorists, no matter how
surgical, are likely to bring bloody
reprisals against Americans abroad
and at home.
