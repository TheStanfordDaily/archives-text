## Into the light VIA's Dwight Clark: hooked on Asia 
### KEN McCLAIN 
It was ironic that the table over which I chose to talk
with Dwight Clark, director of Volunteers in Asia, was
immediately outside the room in which Gallo Wines was
recruiting prospective executives. As three-piece suits
glided by, Clark discussed a world far removed from
transcripts, resumes and interviews — a world that has
nevertheless intimately shaped the destiny of hundreds of
Stanford students.
Twenty-one years ago, Clark, then dean of freshman
men in Wilbur Hall, planted the seed for VIA by taking
23 undergraduates, eager for a broadening experience, to
Hong Kong. There they taught English, led educational
programs in "rooftop schools" and built a road into a
tuberculosis sanitorium. "A real blind-leading-the-blind
situation," he said of their first journey into Asia.
Since that time, Clark has seen more than 800 volun
teers devote six months to two years of their life to VIA,
teaching English and appropriate technologies to people
in South Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Sri Lanka,
Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan, Macao, Indonesia and
the People's Republic of China.
A budget of $135,000, raised solely from donations and
entrepreneurial projects, supports the program and pays
the salaries of Clark and eight others who share office
space in the basement of the Clubhouse.
But even as the founder and director of an organization
nearly two decades old, Clark earns less than $13,000 a
year, the same amount made by all other VIA staffers
with three or more years of experience. Clark is a Quaker,
and he credits his simple lifestyle for providing the
"philosophical underpinning for what otherwise would
simply be 'low salary.' "
Clark, now 50, attended Stanford from 1952 to 1958,
obtaining bachelor's and master's degrees in political sci
ence. Between 1961 and 1964, he served as dean of fresh
man men and later assistant dean of men, during which
time he was working on a doctorate in counseling and
guidance. With the inception of VIA as a legal organiza
tion in 1965, he gave up both his job and his doctoral
work to devote full energy to getting students "hooked on
Asia."
The Daily: What was the original impetus for you to give
up your job as assistant dean of men, drop your doctoral
program and start something that had a very uncertain
future?
Clark: There's kind of a funny story there. When I was
working at the dean's office and talking to people about
vocation, I would oftentimes urge them to add to their list
of possibilities what they would most like to do, regardless
of seeming practicality. It was my feeling that in many
cases — not all — it really is possible to do the kind of
work you most want to. It's a question of identifying that
work and then very carefully checking that out.
I'd always been aware that that was sort of cheap advice
to give as long as I never had to practice it. But I was sud
denly faced with a time when I thought it was right to
move on from the dean's office. I was hooked by the ex
periential education even though there was no organiza
tion to hire me and no assured source of income. I really
did believe that philosophy, and I felt that this was worth
doing, so for the first time I took the jump that I'd been
urging on other people. And that was one of the best
choices I've made in a lifetime.
You've never looked back?
No, no I haven't.
What is the most enjoyable thing about VIA for you?
Working with people we get as volunteers and working
with people we get as staffers. We get an extraordinary
bunch of people every year, because it takes a more ma
ture, independent-minded person to choose to go alone to
a post in a non-Western nation, be there for six months to
two years and really carve out a life of his or her own.
And then the people that we have here in the office — I
think we just have a marvelous collection of human
beings. It's a great group. We've gone from a staff of one
and then two for a number of years, to a staff of nine.
But a very important quality that we want to be sure
never changes is that sense of warmth and acceptance and
interest that anyone hopefully gets as soon as they step
into that office. We're never going to reach market-rate
salaries with our salaries, and we don't particularly want
to. My feeling has always been that you get better people,

surprisingly, with lower-than-market rates.
And finally, just the chance to be in Asia that much.
Over time you build up a collection of friends and are
eager to keep in close touch with them, so in that way, I
think that I have one of the world's best jobs. I'm totally
convinced there.
You've also said that being dean of freshman men was
"one of the world's better jobs."
Yeah, there was a time when I thought, 'Geez, Clark,
you're 28, and you're in the best job you'll ever have in
your lifetime,' so that it was necessarily all downhill from
then on. But I've found an even better job.
Vocational choice has always been really interesting to
me, and I end up doing a lot of talking with students about
vocational choices, simply because it's been central to my
happiness, and because I think people's choices are wider

than they first think, particularly if people find that they
aren't dependent upon mainline salary and mainline
traditional vocation. Once you get beyond those boundary
lines, then your choices widen tremendously. And your
choices widen to include, for the first time, some of the
more interesting, challenging jobs that really need to be
done.
A job that you really, really enjoy is something I think we
all want to have. How did you find such an agreeable job,
and how could anybody else do the same?
Well, I think it is in part a matter of really asking your
self what you would really like doing most and not feeling
yourself totally limited to the mainline jobs that are
available.
Just hypothetically, what would happen in your life if
VIA suddenly disbanded and was no more?

I'd probably take a vacation first (laughs). Then I'd
seek a job that has something to do with Asia.
Have you thought about going into the State Department
or doing political work? I
Really not. I think one of the disadvantages of working;
with a small, personal, egalitarian, warm organization
VIA is that it makes it very difficult to go back to large*
bureaucratic, colder organizations later in one's life.
I always see people having at least two passions pertain
ing to their vocations. One is for money, and one is for
tention. My impression of you is that you've conquered
those. Is that true?
There's my Quaker background, which emphasizes
simple living, of looking more to people rather than t<J
things. But it hasn't been a sackcloth-and-ashes act. I've:
chosen what is the most fun, what's the most interesting

We get an extraordinary
bunch of people every year,
because it takes a more ma
ture, independent minded
person to choose to go alone
to a post in a non-Western
nation, be there for six
months to two years and
really carve out a life of his
or her own.

and challenging for me — that which gives me the best
chance to grow and change and meet and work with inter
esting people.
It probably helped to be making a lot of these choices
during the civil-rights and Vietnam War years, because,
that was at a time when a lot of your traditional ideas
about vocation and everything else were shaken up. It
made it easier for me to pick something I thought was so
cially important and to get some peer support for it.
How does being a Quaker tie into your work with VIA?
Quakers have long had strong themes of pacifism, inter
national understanding and brotherhood. So I suppose it's,
helped to give me support and make me feel that this,
kind of work is worth doing. Quakers have all been very
active in working in some international exchange pro
grams at various times.
In fact, I got interested in this at a Quaker work camp at
a reformatory in Oregon, while I was in college. That was
a real cross-cultural experience, meeting people and situa
tions I'd never encountered before.
What do you want to do before you retire from VIA, or
will you ever retire?
Well, I think there are plenty of people who should
have more of a chance to find roles in VIA. I'm trying to
learn Japanese, and I'd like to learn other languages of
Asia further on down the line. Indonesian is the only one I
know now, and even with that one, I'm put to shame by
any volunteer who's been out there for six months or a
year. I'd like to have more time just to keep up more
leisurely with friends and contacts that we've made in
Asia over the years. I say that both personally and in
terms of looking for new areas that VIA should be active
in.
I'm also looking forward to some combination of sab
batical or extended vacation. With Paul Strasburg in place
as our new executive director, there's suddenly the oppor
tunity for such a break. At the same time, given all the
plans and possibilities which Paul and others and I are
thinking of, life around here is too exciting to get totally
removed. I suspect that any break is going to be a semi
sabbatical or semi-vacation.
