## The 						Stanford Daily It's not so academic 
### 
The University of California and the California
State University systems are going back to the
basics.
The drop-out rate of students in the UC-CS
system is high for all students and outrageous for
minority students. Fifty percent of the black stu
dents do not graduate from the Cal State system.
Many more students lack the skills requisite for
success in college.
Consequently, the UC-CS system is going back
to the basics. Freshmen in 1988 will be required
to have 16 courses in order to be admitted to the
Cal State system. That's almost double what is re
quired now.
The intent is laudable but the method is
deplorable. Admittedly, the nation's public edu
cation system is in decay. But the solution is
simply not to require more courses. Many stu
dents probably do slide by and take easy courses.
Students slide by at Stanford. That is not the root
of the problem.
There are two fundamental problems with
America's public school system. First, public edu
cation is not a funding priority in this nation.
Teaching, one of the most valuable occupations
in the country, is a grossly underpaid profession.
As a result, the most talented college graduates
choose careers where they can make money
rather than develop young minds. While military
spending increases each year, our public schools
are forced to do without. The result is inferior
textbooks, elimination of extracurricular pro

grams and rundown buildings.
There is a bumper sticker that reads,
"Wouldn't it be something if the schools had all
the money they need and the Pentagon had to
hold bake sales?"
The second intrinsic problem of American
education is its ethnocentric focus. The United
States is a multi-cultural nation with a mono
cultural educational system. Many cities have
minority high-school drop-out rates exceeding 50
percent. The difficulties of minority students can
not be divorced from the reality that American
education is designed by white people for white
people. When Asian, Latino, and Afro-American
children look at their English and history books,
they see little for them. Why then should they
stay in school?
It has been estimated that by the year 2000,
America's public schools will consist of mostly
"minority" students. Perhaps there is a connec
tion between the decrease in funding for public
schools, the emphasis on tuition tax credits and
the increasing minority composition of the public
schools.
At the University of Michigan, Afro-American
students are tutored with the assumption that
black English is a legitimate language. Using this
approach, the lower the Scholastic Aptitude Test
scores, the better the student has done. Herein
lies the solution to America's educational
quandry. Recognize cultural differences and help
students learn from their own frame of reference.
