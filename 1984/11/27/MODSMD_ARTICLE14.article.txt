## Defend freedom 
### 
It is possible that our country might
once again find it necessary to com
mit its military forces to fight on
foreign soil in the defense of our
liberty or the liberty of others. One
may well hope this proves unneces
sary. One may also hope that a major
commitment of U.S. military power

VIEWPOINT

would be made only after careful de
liberation of the possible alternatives.
In a world of wolves that includes
totalitarian powers hostile to
America and to the other
democracies, a great power does not
maintain a large military force unless
it is prepared to use it. And that in
cludes the willingness to apply mili
tary power abroad when the circum
stances warrant. Not to accept and
prepare for this possibility is the
height of irresponsibility. To
categorically state that no American
troops would be committed to
Central America under any circum
stances, for example, is an invitation
to the kind of aggression that could
Very well make a major conflict more,
lather than less, likely and with a
greater loss of life when it does
become inevitable.
Ever since Vietnam, we have been
conditioning ourselves to appease the
totalitarian powers and their regional
surrogates. The sentiment in favor of
appeasement endures in Congress
thanks to the unrelenting pressure of
groups who are hostile to American
power and, in some cases, also hostile
to our way of life. Many of these
groups participated in the effort to
get America out of Southeast Asia
during the Vietnam conflict. Subse
quent to our withdrawal, many
remained silent on the matter of the
communist atrocities that followed
and the brutal repression that contin
ues. In Central America today, many

are quite willing to justify the
suppression of civil liberties by the
Sandinista regime on the grounds that
the Sandinistas must take such ac
tions because of provocations by our
country, an argument that the histori
cal record will not support.
It is imperative that we rededicate
ourselves to the defense of liberty. It
is imperative that this effort begin in
our universities, which during and
after the Vietnam era opened their
doors to freedom's enemies ... but
often closed their doors to freedom's
defenders.
It must not be allowed to happen
again. Already, in the Bay Area, indi
viduals and groups that were
prominent in the effort to weaken
American power during and after
Vietnam are again marshalling. In the
event American power must be used
again, they will be ready with their
placards, stalls and slogans. They will
come to campus to extort pleas for
withdrawal and a dishonorable peace
from the guilt-ridden and the despair
ing. And once again, the efforts of the
only democracy with the power to
oppose totalitarianism will be under
mined by those adept at extorting
domestic guilts and fear to deliver
victory to liberty's foes.
It is time now that the defenders of
freedom mobilize. It is imperative for
the morale of our military and for a
successful conclusion of conflict at the
minimum cost in lives. It should be
done now before the event. It may be
too late later.
It should begin at our universities.
Of all institutions, our great centers
of learning should be in the front rank
of the defense of democracy and
liberty. They have accommodated the
enemies of liberty all too well these
past two decades. They must now be
turned around to liberty's defense.
