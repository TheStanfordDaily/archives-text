## South Africa: trivial burdens? 
### 
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa â€” Despite
serious problems of residual discrimination in areas
like employment and housing, most of America's
varied racial and ethnic groups take for granted the
tremendous opportunities opened up during the
last two decades. Most Americans have been as
similated into the new era of tolerance resulting
largely from the civil rights and women's move-

VIEWPOINT

ments. My experience working and living in South
Africa as an extern in the Legal Resources Centre
(LRC), the only public-interest law firm in this
country, has been one of apparent marked and
shocking contrast to home. It has, however,
revealed deeper lessons to be learned from South
Africa.
It is true that I assume in America that I at least
have the chance to live (eat, work, study, marry,
read, write, speak) as I choose, and in South Africa
none of these assumptions hold for the majority of
the populace. The burdens facing blacks (in the ex
pansive sense of "non-whites" that has been urged
by the black consciousness movement) here are in
credible. One thinks primarily of the great burden
imposed by the utter lack of political rights, includ
ing the lack of the right to vote. Yet most burdens
are "trivial" in the sense that they involve such
mundane details of daily life as eating, working,
studying, marrying, reading, writing or speaking.
In another sense, of course, the fact of their per
vasiveness is precisely what makes such burdens
fundamental and intolerable. The persistent out
breaks of violence in black townships, nominally
over rent increases and educational issues, reflect
such deep feelings.
Much petty apartheid has been eliminated;
blacks and whites now share most, if not all, hotels,
elevators, restaurants and parks (in Johannesburg,
not Pretoria). Many blacks will tell you that they
have become inured to the petty apartheid that still
exists. The remaining segregated facilities and
entrenched forms of deferential address ("master"
or "baas") represent only the outward show of the
invidious structure of economic and political dis
crimination in this apartocracy. Today, being
refused admission to a fancy restaurant is
"irrelevant" both because such problems affect a
primarily a small number of "middle class" blacks

(that is, the limited group targeted by the ruling
nationalists for co-option in the new constitutional
dispensation) and because there are many less
trivial economic and political issues threatening the
very fabric of South African society.
Yet, when pressed, most blacks will agree that
the trivial burdens reflect a persistent and often
subconscious racism endemic in this chronically
diseased society. Not only the pernicious effects of
the explicitly discriminatory cornerstones of apar
theid legislation deserve condemnation. The Popu
lation Registration Act (which racially classifies
every South African), the Group Areas Act (which
creates "white" areas proscribed to blacks), the
Land Reservation Acts (which reserve about 87
percent of the country's territory for the 16-percent
white minority and allow 13 percent to black
Africans), the Black Administration Act (allowing
state-ordered forced removal of any black) and the
Immorality Act (outlawing miscegenation) are ex
amples of revolting anti-libertarian documents.
But, to me, the most tragic and depressing aspect of
such laws is an aspect not remote from home: the
way their insensitive and dehumanizing values find
oppressive play in the everyday creation of obsta
cles to dignity.
Consider, for example, the many black migrant
workers who come from neighboring states or the
homelands to earn wages equivalent to about $200
a month for hard labor. That is barely enough to
support one person, let alone the large families
most of these workers support. Or think of the spe
cific monotonous jobs which one may observe all
over Johannesburg: the inactive doormen, the se
curity guards with glazed eyes, the elevator
operators imprisoned in their own private versions
of hell.
Such jobs are present not only in South Africa.
And in troubled economic times like those cur
rently experienced by South Africa, perhaps it is
unfair to criticize the large proportion of menial
jobs held by subservient blacks. After all, poor
whites are also affected by the current recession.
Yet when one remembers that it is blacks who are
legally prevented from going to the best educa
tional institutions to develop desired skills and are
obstructed from selling those skills freely for the
price the market can pay, the point becomes sharp
er. When one recalls that similar problems plague
traditionally repressed minority groups, the point

pricks.
Another example of a "trivial" burden going to
the heart of day-to-day life is the continuation of
forced removal of blacks, by the government, to
areas within the homelands. The plight of commun
ities faced with the spectacle of bulldozers razing
their homes, churches and schoolhouses, of families
pressured to "voluntarily relocate" by the complete
disintegration of public services like provision of
water and roads, can scarcely fail to be profoundly
moving. In this area at least, international pressure
can make a difference.
Those blacks not forced to relocate are allowed
to remain in densely populated black townships on
the outskirts of urban areas, like Johannesburg's
Soweto. When I first viewed Soweto, on a visit to
the LRC's advice center there, my breath was
taken away, and I could not help spontaneously as
king, "How can there be so many identical houses
in the same place?" The overwhelming
monotonous effect of rows upon rows of clustered
municipal houses parallels the problem of
monotony in everyday black life.
The Legal Resources Centre has made an impact
in easing some of the burdens faced by South
African blacks. The famous Komani and Rikhoto
judgments in the influx control area positively af
fected thousands of lives. In Komani, the court fi
nally recognized the right of a black husband who
was working in a white area to have his wife and
family live with him. The Rikhoto court rejected
the artificial and literalistic reading of law which
prevented a migrant laborer who had worked con
tinuously in the city for a number of years, but left
the city each year to renew his contract, from ob
taining permanent residence rights in the city.
Yet life for many blacks remains a tragedy of
trivialities: standing in queues to catch a smelly and
dilapidated bus back to the corrugated iron or con
crete block called home; carrying a reference book
at all times as a literal badge of slavery and an
excuse for police harrassment; being spared the
chance to read Chekhov and learn about the
oppression a daily routine can cause. Though the
trivial burdens in America may be more subtle and
less explicit, we would all do well to remember that
sometimes the worst tyrants and tyrannies are the
most trivial ones.
