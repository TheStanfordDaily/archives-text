# Dixon Osburn
## Christmas for all, everyday 
### 
Carols and bills, firs and furs, presents and pres
ence: Ah, yes, Christmas returns. We gather with
our friends, gabbing and gobbling over turkey. We
exchange tokens of our affection and sleep with
sugar plums, reindeer and visions of peace dancing
in our heads. Rivalries are set aside, conflicts
quelled and eggnog quaffed. What could possibly
go wrong as chestnuts roast and jolly men ho, as
white lights blink on our pageantry and snow plays
with our feelings of warmth and generosity?
Is it not unfortunate, though, that our good will is
so institutionalized? When 34,000,000 people live
on pinto beans and Mighty Dog everyday in a
country that is one of the world's richest, when
women and blacks continue to struggle against bias
and bigotry, when bureaucratic hammers nail the
taxpayers for hundreds of dollars and when our
government supports these conditions, our
Christmas charity is rather ineffective. We should
not withdraw our participation, however. If our
voice cracks in the ice, we should not run inside and
hide but sing again. If our lone voice is lost in the
winds, we should band together with more carollers
until we are heard. And we should not sing just
once, but forever, because perfection is always a
beat ahead.
The difficulty in making our voices heard is
knowing what notes to strike. When welfare and
taxes discourage the poor from entering the
workforce, when the Supreme Court decides
against affirmative action in the Memphis
firefighters case and when our government contin
ues to create nuclear weapons against the wishes of
more than 70 percent of our population, our voices
are obviously being distorted by the White House's
hearing "aides."
It is no wonder, however, that our morals have
not progressed beyond the stages of cavemen, who
sat around grunting and scratching their crotches.

Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, More, Locke, Jeffer
son: None of the greatest thinkers of Western
civilization has devised an infallible system in which
we would all participate, all benefit and all love. It
is impossible to create and then force morals on the
public, but this does not mean that we cannot
change what is obviously wrong it only means that
we open ourselves to suggestion.
Many who suffer and despise the iniquities of life
believe they can only exact change with violence.

Smiles, sincerity and gestures are the beginning of
optimism and social change. And while it's true
that a smile cannot prevent a nuclear war today, it
provides the base for humanity tomorrow.

History proves that anarchy, insurrection and
blood do not solve problems but create new ones.
The assassinations of President Kennedy, Anwar
Sadat and Indira Gandhi have cured nothing.
Minority factions, instead, have destroyed what the
majority believed in.
The problems of our society are not concentrated
solely in the wills of our leaders but in we who al
low injustice to exist. And these problems are not
manifest only on political scales but on daily tracks
as well. We pass each other on the streets without
an acknowledging smile or greeting; we do not care
enough to hold a door open for a stranger to pass
through; and we either gawk as a woman is raped at

a party or we ignore the man doubled over and
groaning by the tree. Our rugged individualism, our
pioneer attitude, has thrust us away from the basic,
essential human needs. It is not so difficult to smile
and hug, and yet, the rewards of receiving some
acknowledgement or some encouragement are im
measurably wonderful. As we begin to feel better
about ourselves and life, we are willing to share
more and more of ourselves and our happiness.
Smiles, sincerity and gestures are the beginning

of optimism and social change. And while it's true
that a smile cannot prevent a nuclear war today, it
provides the base for humanity tomorrow. We must
build upon our small successes until we can achieve
greater goals. We should not ignore each other,
shun our moral obligations or direct our generous
energies to holiday cheer. As you sit around the
Christmas tree this year passing gifts to your loved
ones, please remember to sing or to exchange a
smile or some small token of your warmth as you
pass by strangers every day.

Smiles, sincerity and gestures are the beginning

of optimism and social change. And while it's true
that a smile cannot prevent a nuclear war today, it
provides the base for humanity tomorrow. We must
build upon our small successes until we can achieve
greater goals. We should not ignore each other,
shun our moral obligations or direct our generous
energies to holiday cheer. As you sit around the
Christmas tree this year passing gifts to your loved
ones, please remember to sing or to exchange a
smile or some small token of your warmth as you
pass by strangers every day.
