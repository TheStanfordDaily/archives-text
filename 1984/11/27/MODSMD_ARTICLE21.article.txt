[team's 87-48 victory at Maples

' cause of its light blue uniforms, the
dominated inside, often
Iscoring easily and outrebounding
'the Tritons by 13.
I * That's great, and it's fun to win.
;Sut what does Saturday, and the
•rest of the "exhibition" season,
;mean?
• First, Stanford should pound

iearly schedule, which includes
Ipowerhouses such as the Univer

;of Missouri at St. Louis, St. Mary's
Seattle University and
•Mercer University (Mercer of

rfjfcorn Invitational next month.
Second, it means the Cardinal is
farming up and pumping up its
..record with opponents of equal or
smaller size for the bigger front
lines it will face in Pacific 10 Con
ference play. More precisely,
■jjthen 6-foot-8 freshman center
-f£ric Reveno plays his first Pac-10
against the University of
Washington Jan. 3, he'll go against
the likes of 7-0 center Christian
Welp. Other teams won't be too
much smaller than Washington,
which is expected to win the Pac
-10 title.
It also means that 6-7 Kent
Seymour, who started at center
Saturday and had three slam
and others probably ought
lo enjoy it now while they can.
Remember last season — with
J>arly-season opponents of a
jjmilar caliber to those this
sfeason? Stanford was cruising at
il-1 going into the Pac-10 season.
£oof. Back to earth came the
Cardinal — six consecutive con
ference defeats.
£ The task that Seymour, Reveno,
Johnson and freshman
Greg Butler face is formidable.
For the Cardinal to be competi
tive, these players must hold their
own — scoring inside and
rebounding in a game where
height is might.
They have an advantage in that
most of the inside punch last
season came from one player —

since-graduated John Revelli. As
a result, the work of one or two
players now will be divided among
three or four. However, inexperi
ence will combine with the fact
that Stanford does not have an es
tablished outside scoring threat to
loosen the sagging zone defenses
the Cardinal will undoubtedly
encounter.
It could be Butler who'll make a
difference. He seemed to
overcome any nervousness early
and played aggressively Saturday.
Reveno did likewise, and Seymour
did what you have to do inside —
take the ball to the hoop ag
gressively.
Johnson, though, hasn't
developed as expected since his
arrival last year.
The next few games will con
stitute learning time for the Card
inal frontcourt. The guards,
though they lack size and experi
ence, are quick and have leader
ship from third-year starter Keith
Ramee. But one problem with
playing a soft schedule is that the
inexperienced players will appear
to gain experience. Then the Pac
-10 season will begin, and it'll be a
new ball game.

Brigham Young University
football Coach LaVell Edwards
said his top-ranked and unde
feated team "has as a legitimate
claim on it (the No. 1 ranking) as
anyone, more than anyone for that
matter."
But University of Oklahoma
Coach Barry Switzer, whose
Sooners are ranked No. 2, said,
"We have played three No. 1
teams (and) BYU has not played
any team that is in the top 20."
BYU will play the University of
Michigan in the Holiday Bowl,
and Oklahoma will play Washing
ton in the Orange Bowl. If Okla
homa wins by more than a touch
down, I believe it will be ranked
No. 1. If the Sooners lose, BYU
will retain its ranking.
BYU is not the best team in the
country — Oklahoma is closer to
that status than any other team.
But no matter what the polls say
now or in January, the time for a
playoff in college football has
come.

lines it will face in Pacific 10 Con
ference play. More precisely,
■jjthen 6-foot-8 freshman center
-f£ric Reveno plays his first Pac-10
against the University of
Washington Jan. 3, he'll go against
the likes of 7-0 center Christian
Welp. Other teams won't be too
much smaller than Washington,
which is expected to win the Pac
-10 title.
It also means that 6-7 Kent
Seymour, who started at center
Saturday and had three slam
and others probably ought
lo enjoy it now while they can.
Remember last season — with
J>arly-season opponents of a
jjmilar caliber to those this
sfeason? Stanford was cruising at
il-1 going into the Pac-10 season.
£oof. Back to earth came the
Cardinal — six consecutive con
ference defeats.
£ The task that Seymour, Reveno,
Johnson and freshman
Greg Butler face is formidable.
For the Cardinal to be competi
tive, these players must hold their
own — scoring inside and
rebounding in a game where
height is might.
They have an advantage in that
most of the inside punch last
season came from one player —

since-graduated John Revelli. As
a result, the work of one or two
players now will be divided among
three or four. However, inexperi
ence will combine with the fact
that Stanford does not have an es
tablished outside scoring threat to
loosen the sagging zone defenses
the Cardinal will undoubtedly
encounter.
It could be Butler who'll make a
difference. He seemed to
overcome any nervousness early
and played aggressively Saturday.
Reveno did likewise, and Seymour
did what you have to do inside —
take the ball to the hoop ag
gressively.
Johnson, though, hasn't
developed as expected since his
arrival last year.
The next few games will con
stitute learning time for the Card
inal frontcourt. The guards,
though they lack size and experi
ence, are quick and have leader
ship from third-year starter Keith
Ramee. But one problem with
playing a soft schedule is that the
inexperienced players will appear
to gain experience. Then the Pac
-10 season will begin, and it'll be a
new ball game.

Brigham Young University
football Coach LaVell Edwards
said his top-ranked and unde
feated team "has as a legitimate
claim on it (the No. 1 ranking) as
anyone, more than anyone for that
matter."
But University of Oklahoma
Coach Barry Switzer, whose
Sooners are ranked No. 2, said,
"We have played three No. 1
teams (and) BYU has not played
any team that is in the top 20."
BYU will play the University of
Michigan in the Holiday Bowl,
and Oklahoma will play Washing
ton in the Orange Bowl. If Okla
homa wins by more than a touch
down, I believe it will be ranked
No. 1. If the Sooners lose, BYU
will retain its ranking.
BYU is not the best team in the
country — Oklahoma is closer to
that status than any other team.
But no matter what the polls say
now or in January, the time for a
playoff in college football has
come.
