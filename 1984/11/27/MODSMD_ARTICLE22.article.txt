# Davis solidifies local recruiting power
## Cardinal gets three recruits 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
It's official. High school seniors
Derek Bruton, Todd Lichti and
Bryan McSweeney have signed letters
of intent to attend Stanford next fall
on basketball scholarships pending
their admission to the University.
Although the three players made
verbal commitments to Stanford early
last week. Coach Tom Davis couldn't
make an official announcement until
he had the letters in hand. He does
now and, to say the least, he's excited
about next year's crop of freshmen.
"A key in establishing long-term
success in any college basketball pro
gram is putting together several good
recruiting years," Davis said. "This
recruiting class is another very posi
tive step in that direction. All three of
these students were very highly
recruited and all had offers from
major institutions."
All three averaged at least 19
points per game as juniors last year
and were named to a number of pre
season high school All-America
teams this fall. Two of them, Lichti
and Bruton, are from the greater Bay
Area.
"We've added two of the very top
recruits locally," Davis said. "With
Earl Koberlein (a junior forward
from San Jose) and Eric Reveno (a
freshman center from Menlo Park)
already here, we're further establish
ing a local foothold upon which to
build."
The 6-foot-10, 240-pound Bruton
will help solve probably Davis' big
gest problem this season — depth at
the center position. As a junior,
Bruton averaged 19.8 points and 14.5
rebounds per game while shooting 60
percent from the floor and blocking
130 shots for Gilroy High School. He
was listed in Street and Smith maga
zine's Top 200 pre-season Ail-
Americans and is considered by many
to be the top center in Northern Cali
fornia.
"1 decided upon Stanford because
its combination of academics and ath
letics is the best," Bruton said. "And,
besides that, Coach Davis plays my
type of game. He runs, but if he can't
get anything, he'll pull it out and look
inside to the big guy. I like to play ag
gressively and go right to the basket."
Lichti, a 6-4 guard from Mt. Diablo
High School in Concord, may be the
best prospect of the three. He was

listed in Street and Smith's Top 50
and The Sporting News' Top 75 high
school prospects. Last season, he
averaged 23.5 points and 13
rebounds and was an All-East Bay
and All-NorCal selection.
McSweeney, though not from the
immediate area, is also from Califor
nia. The 6-7 forward from Dana
Point (south of Los Angeles)
averaged 19 points, 12 rebounds and
four blocked shots per game last year
for Dana Hills High School. He was
the Most Valuable Player of the
South Coast League and a Los An
geles Times All-Orange County pick.
McSweeney, whose father played

basketball at the University of North
Carolina, was also rated the top
swingman at the Superstars Camp last
summer.
"I'm pleased, because these kids
are ranked higher as a group than any
of our previous classes," Davis said.
Stanford has two more scholarships
for next season and since the fall sign
ing period has ended, Davis will not
be able to award them until this
spring.
Card notes
Davis and his coaching staff, in
cluding former National Basketball
Association player Kermit Washing
ton, will be in front of the Stanford

Bookstore tomorrow at noon for a
pre-Apple Invitational Tournament
rally.
The rally will also mark the begin
ning of the bookstore's arrangement
with the Athletic Department to sell
season basketball tickets, including
student and family-plan tickets.
After Saturday's season-opening
crowd of 6,432, about 1,000 less than
capacity, Maples Pavilion will in all
likelihood be packed for both nights
of the tournament. The opening
round games are Friday night at 7 and
9, and the consolation and final
games are Saturday night at the same
times.

recruiting years," Davis said. "This
recruiting class is another very posi
tive step in that direction. All three of
these students were very highly
recruited and all had offers from
major institutions."
All three averaged at least 19
points per game as juniors last year
and were named to a number of pre
season high school All-America
teams this fall. Two of them, Lichti
and Bruton, are from the greater Bay
Area.
"We've added two of the very top
recruits locally," Davis said. "With
Earl Koberlein (a junior forward
from San Jose) and Eric Reveno (a
freshman center from Menlo Park)
already here, we're further establish
ing a local foothold upon which to
build."
The 6-foot-10, 240-pound Bruton
will help solve probably Davis' big
gest problem this season — depth at
the center position. As a junior,
Bruton averaged 19.8 points and 14.5
rebounds per game while shooting 60
percent from the floor and blocking
130 shots for Gilroy High School. He
was listed in Street and Smith maga
zine's Top 200 pre-season Ail-
Americans and is considered by many
to be the top center in Northern Cali
fornia.
"1 decided upon Stanford because
its combination of academics and ath
letics is the best," Bruton said. "And,
besides that, Coach Davis plays my
type of game. He runs, but if he can't
get anything, he'll pull it out and look
inside to the big guy. I like to play ag
gressively and go right to the basket."
Lichti, a 6-4 guard from Mt. Diablo
High School in Concord, may be the
best prospect of the three. He was

listed in Street and Smith's Top 50
and The Sporting News' Top 75 high
school prospects. Last season, he
averaged 23.5 points and 13
rebounds and was an All-East Bay
and All-NorCal selection.
McSweeney, though not from the
immediate area, is also from Califor
nia. The 6-7 forward from Dana
Point (south of Los Angeles)
averaged 19 points, 12 rebounds and
four blocked shots per game last year
for Dana Hills High School. He was
the Most Valuable Player of the
South Coast League and a Los An
geles Times All-Orange County pick.
McSweeney, whose father played

basketball at the University of North
Carolina, was also rated the top
swingman at the Superstars Camp last
summer.
"I'm pleased, because these kids
are ranked higher as a group than any
of our previous classes," Davis said.
Stanford has two more scholarships
for next season and since the fall sign
ing period has ended, Davis will not
be able to award them until this
spring.
Card notes
Davis and his coaching staff, in
cluding former National Basketball
Association player Kermit Washing
ton, will be in front of the Stanford

Bookstore tomorrow at noon for a
pre-Apple Invitational Tournament
rally.
The rally will also mark the begin
ning of the bookstore's arrangement
with the Athletic Department to sell
season basketball tickets, including
student and family-plan tickets.
After Saturday's season-opening
crowd of 6,432, about 1,000 less than
capacity, Maples Pavilion will in all
likelihood be packed for both nights
of the tournament. The opening
round games are Friday night at 7 and
9, and the consolation and final
games are Saturday night at the same
times.

Stanford Coach Tom Davis announced that, pending their academic acceptance, he has added three mem
bers to the Class of 1989, including a much needed center. Davis and his coaching crew will be at the Stan
ford Bookstore today for a rally to promote this weekend's tournament.
