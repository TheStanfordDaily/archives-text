# Women hoopsters take on Spartans

### JOHN LIS Daily staff 
Guard Virginia Sourlis will miss
tonight's game with a knee injury as
Stanford hosts San Jose State Univer
sity, but Dotty McCrea, head coach
of the Cardinal women's basketball
team, isn't worrying about the loss of
her leading scorer.
"I didn't even think about it,"
McCrea said when asked what she
would do without Sourlis in the
lineup. "All I've thought of is prepar
ing for today's game and getting these
guys ready."
Sourlis hurt her knee Friday when
she came down wrong after a drive
against the University of California,
Santa Barbara. "The trainers think
it's hyperextended," Sourlis said.
"I'm going to see the doctor (today).
I hope I'll only miss one game."
"It's an opportunity for some other
people to do well," McCrea said. "If
we get three people in double figures
and everyone else does their job,
we'll be OK."
When asked who would need to
pick up the scoring load — Sourlis
was averaging 13 points in the two
games before the injury — McCrea
said, "I think Mary (Bradach) has got
to start scoring more points for us.
This isn't just for one night — she's
got to start getting untracked."
Bradach, the only senior on this
season's team, averaged more than
12 points per game last year but has
yet to score in double figures this
year. "She's right," Bradach said of
McCrea's analysis. "I've got to quit

playing tentatively and play ag
gressively, not think about what I
should be doing. I just have to go out
and play. I've gotten to thinking too
much."
With Sourlis out, Erica Mueser and
Judy Griffith will start at guard. The
two have started with Sourlis, and
neither is particularly worried about
the situation.
"We're both going to have to (pick
up the slack)," Mueser said. "It's not
just scoring but leadership as well,
We both have enough experience
where we can do it."
"We've had balanced scoring this
year, and that's the way we'll do it,"
Griffith said. "If the forwards pick up
the slack, fine. If the guards have to,
that's the way we'll do it. We need
three, maybe four, maybe five people
in double figures."
McCrea characterized San Jose
State as a quick and scrappy, but in
experienced, team. "They lost eight
players, so they're really young," she
said. "They're a step quicker than we
are, so we have to be a step smarter.
We're going to run a defense where
we start in a zone then go to a man
to-man to try to confuse them and
take advantage of their inexperi
ence."
Point guard Dana Foster and cen
ter Rhoda Chew, both seniors, are
the two top returners for the Spar
tans. Last year, Stanford defeated
San Jose State 73-72.
Stanford, 1-2 this season, will face
Pepperdine University at home
Friday. Tonight's game starts at 7:30
p.m. at Maples Pavilion.
