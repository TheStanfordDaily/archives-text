## 'Stop Making Sense' an ecstatic film 
### STEVE VINEBERG Daily staff 
Rock concert films and documen
taries containing concert footage
("rockumentaries") — even when
they lack a controlling vision or aren't
very well shot or edited — may be
more compelling and more entertain
ing to watch than many more intelli
gent and craftsmanlike movies.
Preserving a particularly active, vi
brant moment, they offer us the op
portunity to see, at close range,
performers we may have missed our
chance to see live.
A picture like "Woodstock" or
"Ladies and Gentlemen, The Rolling
Stones" or the posthumous collage
"Janis" gives us exciting, if second
hand, experiences; we still have im
mediate access to the performers,
years after the (often hastily as
sembled) film has become historical
documentation. That's why Jimi
Hendrix's jangling renegade rendi
tion of "The Star Spangled Banner"
and Janis Joplin's wailing blues "Ball
and Chain" and Mick Jagger's
seductive, terrifying "Midnight
Rambler" continue to rev audiences
up when these movies resurface at
revival houses and why a party atmo
sphere persists at weekend showings
of old rock movies.
Therefore, when sophisticated
musicians plan a series of concerts ac
tually in terms of the movie they in
tend to release afterwards, and a first
rate director takes charge, the results

can be thrilling — even more thrilling
than landing tickets to see the band
live. At Martin Scorsese's "The Last
Waltz," which was lovingly shot by
the most prestigious collection of
cameramen ever gathered, probably,
in one place, we saw a great concert
from a more enviable vantage point
than the luckiest patron at Winter
land could have had. The movie was
not merely a felicitous record of a his
toric concert, but a splendid piece of
filmmaking. Similarly, Jonathan
Demme, returning to top form after
his unhappy bout with "Swing Shift,"
has turned the Talking Heads' ap
pearance at the Pantages Theatre in
Hollywood last December into an ec
static film, "Stop Making Sense."
Of all current bands, Talking
Heads may have the most enthusias
tic following among intellectual rock
aficionados, because of David
Byrne's dry, sneaky word-game lyrics
and the unusual rhythms, which
mo.tly derive (on the later records)
from African music. While the
strands of harmony and counterpoint
multiply — especially on last year's
"Speaking in Tongues" album, which
contains the richest instrumentation
so far — the lyrics, beginning as tight
kernels, carefully pared-down por
tions of banal phrases evoking a
range of contemporary obsessions
(sex, urban living, the bomb), bounce
off each other like billiard balls and
veer off into unanticipated directions.
The lyrics have a playful, exploratory

quality, and the music is often shock
ingly beautiful, so the relationship be
tween these two elements shifts con
stantly.
Watching the Heads in performance,
you become conscious of a second
dialectic. The musicians are impeccably
polished, and Byrne, who wrote most
of the tunes, sings lead vocal on all
but one, and even designed the stage
lighting (with Beverly Emmons), has
clearly exercised complete authority
over the show; yet the band's joy in
playing — playing music and playing
games — seems to demand im
provisation and spontaneity. The
result is generous restraint, controlled
frenzy, red-hot cool.

I'm not sure that any rock performer
since the young Mick Jagger can have
demonstrated such an overwhelming
combination of precisely directed
energy, razor wit and versatility.

The band can maintain this weird
balance in part because each of the
members demonstrates a distinctive
personality on stage. Jerry Harrison,
who plays guitar and keyboards, has
dark curly hair and a reticent half
smile; he seems always slightly agog,
whereas Chris Frantz, the drummer,
sits back contentedly on his stool —
leaping into the air on a particularly
lively chorus and waving his sticks in
the air like a military bandman gone
mad. His wife, Tina Weymouth, the
bassist, has lacquered blond hair and
perfect little china-doll features; she's
a mischievous sphinx, smiling in se
cret delight and never letting on what
amuses her and keeps her eyes open

so unnaturally wide. (The mute
musician mystique continues for al
most the entire film: She doesn't sing
a note until, perhaps 20 minutes from
the end, she and Frantz lead a version
of "Genius of Love," from the LP on
which they perform as the Tom-Tom
Club.)
The rest of the band (except for
Byrne) is black — two women and
three men, all recent additions to the
Heads contingent. Bernie Worrell,
the keyboardist, is the most enigmatic
of the men; he has cat's eyes and a
cat's tautness, too, and he doesn't ex
press pleasure (until the very end) —
he just increases his intensity when
things heat up. Alex Weir, who plays
guitar, has a measured warmth and
crinkles up his face when he gets
excited, but Steve Scales (the percus
sionist) really busts loose — marching
back and forth, exhorting the audi
ence, grinning puckishly. (He must be
the world's tallest elf.) The two back
up vocalists, Ednah Holt and Lynn
Mabry, are also livewires. During
"Slippery People," they face Byrne
and, lifting their feet with exagger
ated care, they mimic his motions
(including his broad, slap-happy
guitar style) like imaginative children
playing mirror games.
But David Byrne is the star of the
Talking Heads, and of "Stop Making
Sense," and he gives a brilliant vir
tuoso performance. I'm not sure that
any rock performer since the young
Mick Jagger can have demonstrated
such an overwhelming combination
of precisely directed energy, razor wit
and versatility. With his mongoose
neck and scarecrow body, his hair
slicked back except for a furtive patch
that explodes over one eye, he looks

like a demented Walker Evans figure,
or like the "Psycho Killer" he sings
about in his opening number, but
everything he does is funny.
You hardly expect that gawky
frame to be lithe, but he does
amazing tricks with it — throws it
back into a surprised arc, as if he'd
been pummelled by a volley of BBs,
or executes a series of absolutely
symmetrical bowlegged moves or, in
a single step, transforms a pigeon
toed lunatic into the Hunchback of
Notre Dame. He imports props (a
floor lamp with a flexible stand
becomes an object of wonder), or
uses his microphone and mike stand
as substitutes, or his costumes
(glasses, a red baseball cap, a jacket
worn open and sagging like an ex
hausted scientist's lab coat, an outsize
suit with squared-off shoulders) — or
else he appropriates a slice of the air
and mimes what he can't produce.
Like Jagger and Bette Midler, he
never stops mocking himself; if he
did, his fierce physical commitment to
every number would be frightening
— he would be the "Psycho Killer."
As it is, he can be science-fiction hero
and villain, mutant, devil and evan
gelist, nerd and obsessive, and yet
remain the crown prince of nonsense,
a New Wave Edward Lear.
You can't tell where Byrne's au
thority left off in this film and Jona
than Demme's began; Demme seems
to have devised the movie from inside
Byrne's head. His photographer, Jor
dan Cronenweth (who shot "Blade
Runner"), adapting what was evi
dently an intricate stage lighting plot,
has done a beautiful job: The
autumn-bonfire reds and Halloween
shadows of the "Swamp" and "What

a Day That Was" numbers, the neon
whites and smoky blues of "Take Me
to the River" are among the most ex
quisitely lit "theatrical" interiors a
moviehouse audience has ever seen.
Demme's direction is not merely a
matter of taste and tact. He con
structs the movie the way Byrne con
structed the concert. It starts simply
and elegantly, one man alone on a
bare stage with a guitar and a tape
recorder (providing the full requisite
background for "Psycho Killer"),
erupts when all nine musicians are fi
nally in attendance (on "Burning
Down the House," a conflagration of
a song) and keeps erupting — until,
on "Girlfriend Is Better," the theatri
cal/cinematic metaphor begun with
the illusion of a band on stage turns
gleefully on the audience, and David
Byrne, having thrust his mike in front
of a techie creeping around on stage
with a lighting instrument and elicited
a sung response, now points the mike
at the camera — at us. This song,
which contains the lyric, "It's always
showtime / Here at the edge of the
stage," is the movie's theme; "When
we get older / We stop making
sense," Byrne sings — and as he
dances around in the "big suit" Gail
Blacker designed for him, we under
stand that by "stop making sense" he
and Demme mean to start making
theater. The two numbers that follow,
"Take Me to the River" (by Al
Green) and "Crosseyed and Pain
less," have a relaxed feeling to them;
the lights go up, Byrne slips out of his
Goliath-shouldered jacket, and even
Bernie Worrell breaks into a grin.
Byrne and Demme think of every
thing: They even work up a curtain
call set to music.
