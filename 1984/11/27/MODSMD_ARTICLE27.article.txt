# 'Missing in Action' entirely off target and badly acted
## 
### DAVE KONUCH 
It's a continual source of wonder to
me that with both Sylvester Stallone
(from "First Blood" two years ago)
and Chuck Norris on our side, we still
managed to lose the Vietnam War,
and that's what spoiled Chuck Norris
latest film for me. We did lose the
war, not because our guys weren't
nasty enough, but because the Viet
Cong were amazing jungle fighters,
and they were on their home court
besides. If the Viet Cong walked into
bullets as easily in real life as they do
in "Missing in Action," you'd still be
able to buy a Big Mac in what used to
be Saigon. This incredibility, coupled
with some of the worst acting I've
seen since the last time I watched
"General Hospital," destroyed the
early promise seen in former martial
arts champion Norris' latest bit of

cinematic nastiness.
In "Missing," Norris plays a former
army colonel listed as missing in ac
tion who has actually been held
by the Vietnamese for seven years on
trumped-up, war-crimes charges. He
escapes and returns to this United
States obsessed with the idea that the
Vietnamese still have U.S. MIAs in
their prisons. He agrees to return to
Vietnam with a U.S. Senator and a
pretty interpreter (Lenore Kasdorf)
to try to get more details about MIAs
from the Vietnamese. Once in
Saigon, Norris ditches the U.S.
delegation to do some checking on his
own, and here the fun really begins.
He breaks into the presidential
palace, kills the president (well, he
had to; it was in self-defense) and
returns to his hotel just in time to
jump into bed with the pretty inter

preter.
From there, he goes to Thailand to
stock up on goodies for his assault on
a prisoner-of-war camp: some M-16
machine guns, a Bell-Huey Cobra
helicopter gunship (rented, probably)
and a bullet-proof assault raft. The
film's best sequences are here, with
steamy shots of Thai brothels, and
perfectly sinister sunglass-wearing
Viet Cong assassins who stalk Norris
at every turn. So far, so good.
Obviously, the filmmakers ran out
of ideas at this point. There are ap
parently only so many ways to kill
commies, and in the second half of
the film, director Joseph Zito falls
back on all the more prosaic ones.
Norris steams into Vietnamese terri
tory with one old war buddy assisting-
Seven explosions, 10,000 rounds of
ammunition and 8,000 dead Viet

Cong later, Norris emerges victorious
with five shell-shocked Americans, ■
Apparently, 12 years with only the
Cambodians, the Chinese and the
Thais to pick on has weakened the
Vietnamese army. They are lousy
shots. Not only can they not hit Nor
ris and his friends with any bullets,
they cannot even get him dirty. Nor
ris' new beard and wooden acting
style make him look too much like
the Marlboro Man for us to take him
seriously. Joel Goodman's atrocious
editing makes it hard for us to con
nect Norris' firing his M-16 with the
shots of the Vietnamese getting hit.
The "French" helicopter pilot gets
my vote for worst performance of the
year in a bit part.
"Missing in Action" begins with
much potential for a good action film-
Unfortunately, it all goes unrealized.
