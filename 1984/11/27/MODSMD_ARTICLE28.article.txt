# The 						Little Foxes' explores avarice
## 
### KARY ANTHOLIS 
The spring of 1900 was a season of hope in America.
For 35 years, railroads and commerce had welded the na
tion into a unit. Entrepreneurs in the North and the South
could foresee great opportunity. But there was a cancer in
the social body. The greed of many capitalists led them to
create inhuman conditions for their workers, and poverty
became an acute societal disease. Lillian Hellman's "The
Little Foxes" explores bourgeois avarice in turn-of-the
century Southern society. The Renaissance Ensemble
Theatre Company finds the play relevant to our times and
presents it at the Victoria Theater in San Francisco.
"The Little Foxes" premiered in 1939. The Great De
pression was in its 10th year and it had become clear that
human greed was the source of the unprecedented eco
nomic catastrophe.
The play focuses on three siblings of a Southern bour
geoise family, the Hubbards. Benjamin and Oscar
Hubbard run a local business and plan to take advantage
of the economic growth that greeted Southern society at
the turn of the century by building a cotton mill in their
town. They hope to strike a deal with a Northern textile
magnate, William Marshall, and they look to their sister,
Regina Giddens, for financial help. Regina offers them
her husband's savings, but as the siblings discuss the deal,
it becomes clear that each of them is despicably greedy.
Finally Regina agrees to convince her husband Horace
to commit himself to the deal, and the Hubbards await
Horace's return from Baltimore where he is being treated
for heart trouble.
Meanwhile we see the effect of the siblings' greed on
the other members of the Hubbard clan. Birdie, Oscar's
wife, is a kind-hearted woman of Southern aristocratic
heritage. We find that Oscar physically and emotionally
brutalizes Birdie, and that Birdie tries to escape her pain
by playing waltzes and drinking wine. She is the incarna
tion of the ravaged civility of Southern feudalism.
Oscar's son Leo is the mirror image of his father. Oscar
hopes to marry Leo off to Regina's daughter Alexandria.
But Alexandria, a naive innocent, never takes seriously
the idea of this incestuous match.

"Little Foxes" is a long play, and Hellman presents a
theme that is recurrent in American literature — the
decay of the traditional South. Yet as cliched as this theme
may be, the play has the potential to strike us as fresh. The
language is rich, and the situations are intensely dramatic.
But the Renaissance Ensemble Company never quite
renders the play's vitality.
Two performances are particularly weak. Thomas
Emerson emphasizes Benjamin Hubbard's superficial
cordiality. But Emerson seems so intent on expressing the
greed of this Southern fat cat that he never delivers a clear
sense of what exactly drives this man. Similarly, Tony
Hartford plays Oscar as a petty man who manipulates
anything that he can control. However, Oscar also sup
presses a frustrated rage, which he vents by physically
abusing Birdie. Hartford does not succeed in projecting
this part of Oscar's character.
In contrast, the two leading women give strong perfor
mances. Rosemary Bock brilliantly conveys Birdie's pa
thetically destroyed innocence. Her nervous chatter and
nostalgic reveries give us a sense of Birdie's loss. Peggy
Linz plays Regina as a shrewd manipulator, and we can al
ways sense her venomous greed beneath her cool, superfi
cial friendliness.
In spite of these fine performances, the production does
not sustain a high level of intensity. Such intensity seems
essential to a successful depiction of the Hubbards' deadly
avarice. Something truly hateful must be projected so that
the audience remains emotionally involved. Part of the
problem is that the play seems underrehearsed. Much dra
matic impact is lost as actors seem unsure of their lines.
The director, Mary Rose McMaster, may be at fault here.
But in all fairness to McMaster, the production is seriously
hampered by the terrible acoustics of the Victoria
Theater.
Because of these various problems, the Renaissance
Ensemble Company's production of "The Little Foxes"
never creates the image of a tragically diseased social
body. Without this image, the production fails to convey
the play's timely relevance.

In spite of these fine performances, the production does
not sustain a high level of intensity. Such intensity seems
essential to a successful depiction of the Hubbards' deadly
avarice. Something truly hateful must be projected so that
the audience remains emotionally involved. Part of the
problem is that the play seems underrehearsed. Much dra
matic impact is lost as actors seem unsure of their lines.
The director, Mary Rose McMaster, may be at fault here.
But in all fairness to McMaster, the production is seriously
hampered by the terrible acoustics of the Victoria
Theater.
Because of these various problems, the Renaissance
Ensemble Company's production of "The Little Foxes"
never creates the image of a tragically diseased social
body. Without this image, the production fails to convey
the play's timely relevance.


Thomas Emerson, Peggy Linz and Tony Hartford portray the drama of a Southern family's lust for wealth
and power at the turn of the century.
