# 'Horsedreamer' disjointed
## 
### NANCY HENRY 
In search of something positive
to say about the San Francisco Ac
tor's Theatre production of
"Geography of a Horsedreamer"
by Sam Shepard, I considered that
the playwright has written some im
pressive plays, and the germs of
some of his most powerful themes
are discernible — but barely — in
this uneven and disjointed little
piece. And, the performance of
John Blevins as Cody showed
promise and, in fact, was quite good
in the second act. And the music
was interesting and the videos used
at the beginning of each of the two
scenes were, well, loud. But are
these features sufficiently redeem
ing? Can 1 recommend that
anybody go to see this rather
amateurish and frustrating show at
the Shelton Studio Theatre? The
answer is a conditional no.
It is conditional only because a
more objective analysis may un

cover something that the painful
acting, awkward blocking and ex
tended pauses (as though the actors
were searching their memories for
that next line) may have caused me
to overlook.
The horsedreamer of the title
refers to a naive cowboy from the
Midwest who, when discovered to
have the mysterious ability to
"dream" the winner of a given
horse race, is kidnapped by clumsy,
gangster-like members of a city
race-track racket, chained to a bed
and forced to dream.
Jackie Byrne as the senselessly
violent Santee is particularly ter
rorizing, to the audience as well as
to Cody. His performance is so stiff
and so loud that I felt like applaud
ing when he left the stage, and af
terwards things did improve.
The idea is creative, but its po
tential dies as the central, and only,

metaphor — the abused and so
cially restrained artist — is beaten
like a dead horsedream'er into the
ground. The rest of the story shows
Cody unable to continue dreaming
winners. Fallen from grace with the
gangster powers that be, he is
demoted to "dreaming dog races."
The unity of the action is nonex
istent, with a complete set and
costume change for the second act
that brings in new characters who
serve no apparent purpose; they
are caricatures who are not even
funny. Much of the comic effect is
lost in the flat delivery of the lines.
Again, Blevins brightens up the
last act by transforming himself into
a dog, scrambling around on all
fours, barking and performing
other canine activities.
The play is relatively short and
the theater is in a convenient loca
tion — 535 Sutter St. just off Union
Square. "Geography of a Horse
dreamer" plays through Dec. 8.
