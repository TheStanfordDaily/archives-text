# Law prof calls for labor reforms

### DOUGLAS POST 
Long-term solutions to "wrongful dis
charge," or the firing of non-unionized
workers "at will" by their employers, are
more likely to come from legislation and
arbitration than through the judicial
process, according to a Stanford labor Law
expert.
In an recent interview following a
speech to the American Arbitration Asso
ciation's seven Annual Arbitration Day
Conference in Los Angeles on Nov. 15,
Law School Prof. William Gould said
wrongful discharge falls into one of two
broad categories- The first involves the dis
charge of workers by employers for refus
ing to participate in illegal or unethical ac
tivities, reporting these activities or pos
sibly refusing to curtail free speech activi
ties at an employer's request.
The second type of wrongful discharge
centers around the implied contractual

agreements that companies otten establish
upon hiring, Gould said. Rarely docu
mented, this agreement may take the form
of statements made by recruiters or per
sonnel departments and representatives
made in corporate literature.
The move toward legislation is just
beginning, Gould said. A few states are
already enacting statutes that would
protect the rights of employees who refuse
to support an employer's policy that vi
olates a rule or law — and constitutes a
threat to public health or safety. New York
and Michigan already have laws like these;
several other states have less comprehen
sive laws to protect "whistle blowers,"
Gould said.
Dealing with the second type of wrong
ful discharge is considerably more difficult,
Gould said. Businesses seem determined
to limit remedies to these types of em
ployee problems. There remains the lin

gering yet significant problem of establish
ing the legal status of company announce
ments and employee statements that
would negate implied contractual obliga
tions.
Corporate unwillingness to "provide all
workers civilized treatment has provided
solid evidence for the view that our na
tion's concern with morality frequently
lag* behind its protection of efficiency and
profits," Gould said.
Until legislation finally approaches this
problem, it will continue to be dealt with in
the courts, Gould said. Large jury awards
"have sent a tremor through the corpora
tions not felt since the early days of either
the National Labor Relations Act or the
Civil Rights Act." This is particularly true
in California, according to Gould, who
cited awards of $500,000 and up. Until
this vacuum is filled by legislative action.
Gould said he expects a continuing rise in

wrongful discharge litigation.
Economically, Gould said be sees pro
posed legislation protecting workers as
largely beneficial. He noted that the
workers* right to protection is already
recognized in Japan and West Germany,
and he also related the current trend closer
to home to protect non-union workers
with the earlier struggle of union workers.
"I think the experience in the unionized
sector ... has been a very good experi
ence. The benefits that have been gained
in productivity and loyalty have out
weighed any burden of inefficiency."
Ideally. Gould would Hke to see a com
bination of legislation and arbitration as a
solution to the problem.
"Wrongful discharge is the first step in a
journey of a thousand miles," Gould said.
"Its promise is fairness for all the work
force. Its threat is to bind up the divisions
among workers. Its time will come."
