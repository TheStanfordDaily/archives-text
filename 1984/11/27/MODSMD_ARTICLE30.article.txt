# 'School for Wives' charming

### MARC FAJER 
A stylish American Conservatory
Theater production of Moliere's
"The School for Wives" opened last
week at the Geary Theatre in San
Francisco and showed that it is possi
ble to perform a classic comedy that is
both funny and true to its creator. A
talented cast, primarily ACT veter
ans, bring across the humor and
charm of the play while doing justice
to the characters and to the rhymed
verse.
The play is about a middle-aged
cynic, Arnolphe, who attempts to
marry with the guarantee of not being
cuckolded. To accomplish this feat
(seemingly impossible in the Paris of
his day) he has supervised the
secluded upbringing of a girl, Agnes,
with an eye to keeping her as simple
as possible.
While he is away from home for a
week, she falls for a handsome young
man. The young man, Horace, is the
son of a friend of Arnolphe, and
makes the older man his confidante in
the nascent affair with Agnes. The
play tracks Arnolphe's attempts to
stop the young gallant and the growth
of understanding in Agnes as she
helps her lover foil the old fool's
plans.
Peter Donat generally does a good
job with the part of Arnolphe. His
grins and grimaces are very funny to
watch, as are his mood swings as he
alternates between feeling that he has
outwitted his rival and being outfoxed
himself. Some of his posturing and his
line readings fall a bit flat, perhaps
because he is on stage so much and
his continual ups and downs become
a trifle repetitive.
Still, Donat is most often a pleasure
to watch and makes the rhymed verse
work beautifully. And most impor
tant, he is not afraid to try to be
funny; the puncturing of Arnolphe's
self-assurance should be, and is, very
amusing.
Annette Bening is somewhat less
successful as the simple Agnes. While
she, too, is very funny, her character
is somewhat fuzzy. Agnes is a difficult
role because she is supposed to be un
tutored, yet naturally astute. In this
production, the combination does not

come across; at times she appears an
utter dolt, at other times wise in ways
that do not make sense.
Bening's natural charm, however,
usually makes it possible to ignore the
inconsistencies, and her comic timing
is superb. There is just an uneasy
feeling that she didn't quite get the
proper grasp on Agnes.
Mark Murphey is lively and ap
pealing as young Horace, though his
occasional overattention to diction is
distracting in places. Sydney Walker
does an excellent and very funny turn
as Chrysalde, the old friend of Ar
nolphe. He chides him for his obses

sion with fidelity and notes that
"cuckoldry is what you make of it."
Rosemarie Smith and Geoffrey El
liott are also very amusing as the dim
witted servants of the household who
try to please their master in the best
way they can.
Director Nagle Jackson keeps the
production moving at the right clip
and infuses the play with a lot of
humorous business. The fact that this
play is a "classic" is not allowed to
prevent its natural boisterousness
from coming through. Overall, "The
School for Wives" is a very enjoyable
evening of theater. It will play in
repertory through Feb. 9.
