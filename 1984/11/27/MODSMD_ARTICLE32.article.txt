# 'Two Dancing' interweaves varied textures and tones
## 
### AMY FRIEDMAN 
Two Dancing successfully interweaves different
styles of modern dance in a tapestry of varied textures and
tones. The pieces have been created either by Duncan
Macfarland and Clare Whistler or have been created spe
cifically for them by prominent Bay Area choreographers.
Whistler and Macfarland through superb dancing and
diverse selections draw the audience into their world of
warmth, anger, joy and beauty in the San Francisco debut
performance of their duet concert.
Both dancers feel that diversity and quality are the hall
marks of their work. As husband and wife they also share
a tenderness with the audience that is often very moving.
Recently they formed the umbrella company called Mac
farland/Whistler DanceArtCompany to devote them
selves to further exploration of different styles in the con
tinued evolution of "Two Dancing" and to collaborate
with other artists in future productions. Neither dancer is
a newcomer to the dance community in San Francisco â€”
both have danced for The San Francisco Moving Com
pany and as guest performers with several companies in
the area. Last spring they performed at Stanford with 30
different artists in "Conversing," which examined the im
pact of technology on our society.
Macfarland is "essentially a humanist" and explores
themes suggested by the "human condition" in the pieces
he creates. "Post Mortem, Remedial Modern. A Little
Dance is an elegant study in communication breakdown.
Dressed in black and white, he and Whistler fidget in their
chairs as their voices overlap in monotone repeating
phrases like: "dehumanization, advanced thought, missed
communication, fatalistic continuacy." Boredom defines
the limits of this piece in the sterile environment created
by the white cube with glasses of colored liquid on it, two
white chairs and a large tape recorder. The cool blue light
only further alienates the two who barely acknowledge
the other's presence. Between movements of the dance a
typewriter taps as Macfarland or Whistler change cassette
tapes.
Whistler is less concerned with issues than in "bringing
something beautiful" to her pieces. There is an airiness to
the two pieces she created in the concert, "Catch" and
"Double Fault." "Catch" is a delightful flirtation per
formed to the unusual sound of Inuit throat singing. She
includes snatches of folk dance and even hints of break
dancing in a happy example of Macfarland/Whistler's

broad dance vocabulary. "Double Fault," just finished in
time for this concert, demonstrates that Whistler is be
coming more "prop-oriented." An oversized net
dominates the stage. The two swish badminton racquets
and step lightly in the first part of the dance. Next they
dive and leap as a television announcer describes a tennis
game. After a sip of green Gatorade from a fountain, the
two rally with a real badminton birdie. The piece is
delightfully lighthearted.
The tour de force of the evening is, on the other hand,
an emotional battleground. The magical intimacy that
characterizes all the duet pieces is put to a brutal test in
Giff Keuter's "Until Death Do Us Part." The piece ex
plores the demise of a marriage. Macfarland becomes in
creasingly violent with Whistler as he loses all patience
with her. She meanwhile uses her sexuality as a weapon
against him. The relationship is complex. The pull of love
and hate eventually leads to destruction when Macfarland
kills his wife. The dance accentuates the different per
sonalities of the husband and wife but also show the
compatibility and love the two shared at the start of the
dance in a reminscence at the end.
The solos underscore the strengths of each dancer.
Whistler stretches and flows languidly to the Blue Danube
in "The Waltz." Her classical training in ballet is very ap
parent in the piece. She floats as if in a dream. Macfarland
is very theatrical and very dramatic. He uses a great deal
of facial expression to highlight his movement. Although
his solo performance in "Waking Dreams" was excellent,
the piece was less original than the others. He con
templates the boundaries of waking and dreaming but
seems restricted to explore the two worlds in a small, shal
low space.
Macfarland and Whistler use their differences as a
strength. They fit together like puzzle pieces in the closing
configuration of "Don't Touch." Katie Nelson "makes
movement make sense" in this piece as Macfarland and
Whistler ricochet off one another in paradoxically
deliberate yet random paths that eventually lead to their
seduction of each other. It breaks with tradition as
Whistler lifts Macfarland as well as vice versa. The piece
that opens the concert establishes the intimacy and daring
that characterize the evening. The concert is worth the
trip to the New Performance Gallery in San Francisco.
The show closes tonight.


Duncan Macfarland and Clare Whistler display the vibrancy of dancing in their performance, "Two Dan
cing."
