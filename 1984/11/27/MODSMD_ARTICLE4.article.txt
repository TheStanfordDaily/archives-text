# ASSU to vote on Motorola
## 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate will consider a
bill advocating a nationwide boycott
of the Motorola Corporation at
tonight's meeting.
According to Senators Mark Lan
desmann and Jon Adelstein, who co
authored the measure, the bill
represents a strengthening of the
anti-apartheid sentiment expressed
by students in last month's referen
dum.
"The referendum clearly indicates
the level of student concern about the
moral indifference of the Motorola
Corporation," Landesmann said.
Landesmann, Adelstein and others
have been researching Motorola's
policies for some time — and say they
continue to be shocked by what they
discover.
"The more we study, the greater
we see Motorola's lack of concern on
a variety of issues," Landesmann
said. "The degree of moral indif
ference is almost incomprehensible to
anyone who understands basic moral
values. Their record is sad and em
barrassing."
The proposed bill has two main
foci: a call for greater awareness
of Motorola policies and a voluntary
boycott of its products.
The authors say they consider the
awareness initiative the most impor
tant component of the measure. The
bill urges the Career Planning and
Placement Center to advise potential
Motorola employees that the Stan
ford Commission on Investment Re
sponsibility has found Motorola's

South African policies to be "socially
injurious/'
"Students have a right to know
this," Adelstein said. "This aspect of
the bill is a reminder to students that
this company might be doing things
that could be considered insensitive."
The proposed voluntary boycott
will be an attempt to exert economic
pressure on Motorola, calling on
Stanford students and alumni to
refrain from purchasing all Motorola
products. This would be in conjunc
tion with an existing nationwide
boycott initiated by the Friends of
Prowse Farm.
"A Stanford-only boycott would
have marginal significance at best,"
Landesmann said. "Our main target,
the inclusion of alumni in the boycott,
is included because they are in a bet
ter position to boycott Motorola ef
fectively. If this passes, we're count
ing on the Alumni Association to
disseminate information."
On Oct. 30 and 31, students voted
2045 to 485 in favor of divesting
Stanford's 94,000 shares of Motorola
stock because of the company's
operations in South Africa.
Adelstein and Landesmann say
they are pleased with the apparently
poor turnout at the recent Motorola
recruiting meeting on the Stanford
campus.
"Motorola appears to be sensitive
to the fact of the poor turnout and
their management appears to be very
sensitve about the referendum," Lan
desmann added. "They seem to get
very uptight when people know what
they're doing."
