# Plastic heart sparks query

Artificial hearts, like the one placed in the chest of
William Schroeder on Sunday, have been and will continue
to be supported by funds from investors and researchers,
History Prof. Barton Bernstein said.
Bernstein, who is also a member of the interdisciplinary
team at the medical center, said in an interview yesterday
that "there's been no evidence so far" that financial sup
port for artificial heart research has been or will be a sub
stantial part of the U.S. government budget.
"If s just been rubber stamped so far," he said.
The $20 million used for the implant of an artificial
heart into Schroeder's chest came from private investors,
Koiff Medical, Inc. announced shortly after the operation.

According to Bernstein's calculations, Willen Kolff, in
ventor of the artificial kidney, and Robert Jarvik, inventor

of the Jarvik-7,
the heart that
now rests in
Schroeder's
chest, are worth
more than $6
million.
William
DeVries, the
surgeon who
transplanted an
artificial heart
into the chest of
the late Seattle
dentist Barney
Clark, has per
sonal worth of
approximately
$350,000,
Bernstein said.

Clark received the first permanent artificial heart on
Dec. 2,1982. He lived for 112 days in the hospital before
dying after several of his vital organs stopped functioning.
Since Clark's death, DeVries has admitted to the press
that the artificial heart recipient asked to be taken off the
respirator and allowed to die, but the surgeon has said he
did not comply with Clark's request because be did not
think Clark had the mental capacity to make that decision.
Bernstein noted that two other artificial hearts have
been implanted in the past, but they were used only tem
porarily before a human heart could be located.
The history professor believes the medical conditions of
both Clark and Schroeder were not examined to the
greatest extent before the operations took place. Clark
had advanced emphysema that was "not picked up" until
after the open heart surgery, and Schroeder had a gall
bladder operation in addition to the double coronary by
pass surgery he had in March 1983.
