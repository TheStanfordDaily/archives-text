# Plastic heart sparks query

### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER Senior staff writer 
Artificial hearts, like the one placed in the chest of
William Schroeder on Sunday, have been and will continue
to be supported by funds from investors and researchers,
History Prof. Barton Bernstein said.
Bernstein, who is also a member of the interdisciplinary
team at the medical center, said in an interview yesterday
that "there's been no evidence so far" that financial sup
port for artificial heart research has been or will be a sub
stantial part of the U.S. government budget.
"If s just been rubber stamped so far," he said.
The $20 million used for the implant of an artificial
heart into Schroeder's chest came from private investors,
Koiff Medical, Inc. announced shortly after the operation.

According to Bernstein's calculations, Willen Kolff, in
ventor of the artificial kidney, and Robert Jarvik, inventor

of the Jarvik-7,
the heart that
now rests in
Schroeder's
chest, are worth
more than $6
million.
William
DeVries, the
surgeon who
transplanted an
artificial heart
into the chest of
the late Seattle
dentist Barney
Clark, has per
sonal worth of
approximately
$350,000,
Bernstein said.

Clark received the first permanent artificial heart on
Dec. 2,1982. He lived for 112 days in the hospital before
dying after several of his vital organs stopped functioning.
Since Clark's death, DeVries has admitted to the press
that the artificial heart recipient asked to be taken off the
respirator and allowed to die, but the surgeon has said he
did not comply with Clark's request because be did not
think Clark had the mental capacity to make that decision.
Bernstein noted that two other artificial hearts have
been implanted in the past, but they were used only tem
porarily before a human heart could be located.
The history professor believes the medical conditions of
both Clark and Schroeder were not examined to the
greatest extent before the operations took place. Clark
had advanced emphysema that was "not picked up" until
after the open heart surgery, and Schroeder had a gall
bladder operation in addition to the double coronary by
pass surgery he had in March 1983.


Barton Bernstein
Schroeder is also a diabetic. "AU of
that suggests that he is going to have
difficulties," Bernstein said.
He noted that there are other basic
complications that can occur in artifi
cial heart recipients. He said that cal
cium deposits are common in artifi
cial heart testing on calves.
Bernstein said the researchers
"don't know how good their valves

(in the artificial heart) are."
Bernstein has tried to obtain data
on the testing of artificial hearts, but
he has been unsuccessful in his re
quests. He added that the Food and
Drug Administration does not have
copies of the research reports.
The reports cannot be disclosed to
any third party, Bernstein said.
He said he believes that the artifi
cial heart surgery is like the process of
writing a test, taking it and grading it
yourself. In other words, not much
outside review has been done in this
area of research.

In discussing the Baby Fae case,
Bernstein said that larger issues were
involved than in the artificial heart
cases.
The history professor said he does
not think that the doctors at Loma
Linda University Medical Center,
where Baby Fae received the heart of
a baboon, had any evidence that the
operation was likely to be a success.
Bernstein also noted that the doc
tor who performed the transplant at
Loma Linda had never before per
formed a heart transplant. He also
said that the doctors at Loma Linda

apparently did not know how to use
the anti-rejection drugs properly.
He said there was a possible altern
ative therapy for Baby Fae. He said
she could possibly have been kept
alive by open heart surgery to correct
the defect in her crippled heart.
Bernstein wrote to administrators
at the Loma Linda hospital asking for
a report of the case but received a
reply saying that the hospital plans to
release all the details in a medical
journal.
