Treasury reveals tax proposal
WASHINGTON — The Department of the Treasury handed Presi
dent Reagan a comprehensive tax reform proposal yesterday that would
slash individual and corporate tax rates — cutting the highest personal
rate from 50 percent to 35 percent — but would also impose taxes on
many currently exempt items, including workers' fringe benefits, accord
ing to White House officials.
Administration officials, who declined to be identified, estimated that
the plan — which grew out of a year-long tax reform study at the De
partment of the Treasury and is known among experts as a "modified
flat tax" — would trim the average individual's tax bill by about 8.5 per
cent. They said 80 percent of the nation's taxpayers would enjoy a tax
cut or suffer no tax increase, and mortgage interest rates would continue
to be tax deductible.
The biggest losers, Treasury officials said, would be the millionaires
who currently use all the available tax loopholes to avoid paying taxes.
"Those who have similar incomes should be taxed alike," said one offi
cial. "This is a tax reformer's dream come true."
But critics of the plan predicted that it would turn out to mean higher
" tax bills for many middle-class Americans.
Under the Treasury plan the current graduated system of 14 different
tax rates ranging from 11 percent to 50 percent would be replaced by
just three tax rates — 15 percent for people with the lowest income, 25
percent for middle income taxpayers and 35 percent for those in the
highest bracket, administration sources said.
The plan would also triii. the corporate tax rate from 46 percent to 33
percent.
Heart patient 'extremely stable'
LOUISVILLE, Ky. — The world's second artificial heart recipient
"looked super" yesterday with his internal bleeding slowed considerably
and his new heart's output increasing, his doctor said.
William Schroeder, 52, of Jasper, Ind., was still listed in critical condi
tion, but Dr. Allan Lansing, a member of the surgical team, described
him as "extremely stable."
"I am very pleased with his appearance. There appear to be no com
plications," said Lansing, chairman of the Humana Heart Institute Inter
national, a branch of Humana Hospital Audubon, where the operation
took place.
Dr. William DeVries, the surgeon who performed the implant in a six
and-a-half hour operation, spent the night at the hospital to keep an eye
on his patient, Lansing said. DeVries performed the first permanent ar
tificial heart implant operation on Seattle-area dentist Barney Clark in
1982.
Schroeder was sent back to the operating room less than six hours
after his new plastic-and-metal Jarvik-7 heart was in place to correct ex
cessive bleeding. Surgeons found the source of the bleeding, in the
sutures surrounding the aorta, and stopped it with special sponges.
'Star Wars' defense plan attacked
WASHINGTON — Four prominent members of past administrations
called on President Reagan yesterday to abandon his controversial "Star
Wars" space defense program, saying it would be costly, impossible to
achieve and destabilizing to the U.S.-Soviet nuclear balance.
At a press conference, the four former officials also said that future
arms control talks with Moscow would fail unless Reagan "radically con
strains" his effort to find a nationwide defense against enemy warheads.
"He has a choice between 'Star Wars' as it now stands and arms con
trol (agreements) in his second term," according to McGeorge Bundy,
who was national security adviser to President Kennedy and later head
of the Ford Foundation.
Mcßundy was joined at the press conference by Robert McNamara,
secretary of defense in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations and
later head of the World Bank; Gerard Smith, chief of strategic arms
negotiations for former President Nixon, and George Kennan, former
ambassador to Moscow and an international authority on the Soviet
Union.
Reagan announced the "Star Wars" program in March 1983, saying
its aim was to make nuclear missiles "impotent and obsolete" and sug
gesting that he was seeking a fully effective umbrella to protect both
-missile installations and U.S. cities.
Hijackers release hostages
ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia — Five Somali dissidents holding 103 pas
sengers and five crew members hostage surrendered today to Ethiopian
authorities and released the hostages unharmed.
An Associated Press correspondent at the Addis Ababa airport,
where the plane has been since it was commandeered Saturday on a
flight from Somalia to Saudi Arabia, said the hijackers were being
granted political asylum.
The hijackers, three Somali army officers joined by two passengers,
had been threatening to blow up the plane unless the Somali government
•released 21 political prisoners.
The hijackers, who according to unconfirmed reports were close to the
~ ""Somali National Movement" guerrilla organization, had already let five
pass without carrying out their threat.

Treasury reveals tax proposal
WASHINGTON — The Department of the Treasury handed Presi
dent Reagan a comprehensive tax reform proposal yesterday that would
slash individual and corporate tax rates — cutting the highest personal
rate from 50 percent to 35 percent — but would also impose taxes on
many currently exempt items, including workers' fringe benefits, accord
ing to White House officials.
Administration officials, who declined to be identified, estimated that
the plan — which grew out of a year-long tax reform study at the De
partment of the Treasury and is known among experts as a "modified
flat tax" — would trim the average individual's tax bill by about 8.5 per
cent. They said 80 percent of the nation's taxpayers would enjoy a tax
cut or suffer no tax increase, and mortgage interest rates would continue
to be tax deductible.
The biggest losers, Treasury officials said, would be the millionaires
who currently use all the available tax loopholes to avoid paying taxes.
"Those who have similar incomes should be taxed alike," said one offi
cial. "This is a tax reformer's dream come true."
But critics of the plan predicted that it would turn out to mean higher
" tax bills for many middle-class Americans.
Under the Treasury plan the current graduated system of 14 different
tax rates ranging from 11 percent to 50 percent would be replaced by
just three tax rates — 15 percent for people with the lowest income, 25
percent for middle income taxpayers and 35 percent for those in the
highest bracket, administration sources said.
The plan would also triii. the corporate tax rate from 46 percent to 33
percent.
Heart patient 'extremely stable'
LOUISVILLE, Ky. — The world's second artificial heart recipient
"looked super" yesterday with his internal bleeding slowed considerably
and his new heart's output increasing, his doctor said.
William Schroeder, 52, of Jasper, Ind., was still listed in critical condi
tion, but Dr. Allan Lansing, a member of the surgical team, described
him as "extremely stable."
"I am very pleased with his appearance. There appear to be no com
plications," said Lansing, chairman of the Humana Heart Institute Inter
national, a branch of Humana Hospital Audubon, where the operation
took place.
Dr. William DeVries, the surgeon who performed the implant in a six
and-a-half hour operation, spent the night at the hospital to keep an eye
on his patient, Lansing said. DeVries performed the first permanent ar
tificial heart implant operation on Seattle-area dentist Barney Clark in
1982.
Schroeder was sent back to the operating room less than six hours
after his new plastic-and-metal Jarvik-7 heart was in place to correct ex
cessive bleeding. Surgeons found the source of the bleeding, in the
sutures surrounding the aorta, and stopped it with special sponges.
'Star Wars' defense plan attacked
WASHINGTON — Four prominent members of past administrations
called on President Reagan yesterday to abandon his controversial "Star
Wars" space defense program, saying it would be costly, impossible to
achieve and destabilizing to the U.S.-Soviet nuclear balance.
At a press conference, the four former officials also said that future
arms control talks with Moscow would fail unless Reagan "radically con
strains" his effort to find a nationwide defense against enemy warheads.
"He has a choice between 'Star Wars' as it now stands and arms con
trol (agreements) in his second term," according to McGeorge Bundy,
who was national security adviser to President Kennedy and later head
of the Ford Foundation.
Mcßundy was joined at the press conference by Robert McNamara,
secretary of defense in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations and
later head of the World Bank; Gerard Smith, chief of strategic arms
negotiations for former President Nixon, and George Kennan, former
ambassador to Moscow and an international authority on the Soviet
Union.
