# Chernenko calls for broader talks

### 
MOSCOW — Soviet President
Konstantin Chernenko yesterday said
future arms-control talks between the
United States and the Soviet Union
should cover both strategic and
medium-range nuclear weapons, the
two areas where talks between the su
perpowers broke down almost a year
ago.
Chernenko's statement, made
during a meeting yesterday with
British Labor Party leader Neil Kin
nock and published by the Soviet
news agency Tass, was his first since
the announcement last week that So
viet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko and Secretary of State
George Shultz will meet in Geneva in
January.
Chernenko said the Soviet Union
wants "to start negotiations on the

entire complex of interconnected
questions of nonmilitarization of
outer space, reduction of strategic nu
clear arms and medium-range nuclear
weapons."
He noted that the Soviet Union "is
prepared to search for the most radi
cal solutions" in order to achieve "the
complete prohibition and ultimately
... the liquidation of nuclear arms."
This, he said, was the thrust of a
Soviet proposal recently sent to Presi
dent Reagan.
By explicitly citing strategic and
medium-range weapons, Chernenko
expanded on a Foreign Ministry
statement four days ago that said only
that the Soviets were willing to dis
cuss "the entire complex of questions
concerning nuclear and space weap
ons."

The Soviets broke off negotiations
on medium-range weapons in
Geneva last December after the
deployment in Western Europe by
the North Atlantic Treaty Organiza
tion of Pershing 2 and cruise missiles.
Strategic arms reduction talks were
suspended by the Soviets the same
month.
The Soviets have insisted that
negotiations on medium-range
weaponry could not be resumed un
less the NATO missiles are
withdrawn.
In his comments yesterday, Cher
nenko made no mention of NAIO
withdrawals or other conditions.
However, he noted that the question
of Soviet missiles deployed in Eastern
Europe as a countermeasure "can be

decided only with taking into consid
eration the further actions of the U.S.
side."
A ban on nuclear weapons in outer
space has long been a top Soviet
priority. But a proposal this summer
for space weapons negotiations col
lapsed after the Soviets balked at
U.S. efforts to broaden the scope of
the talks, and after the United States
objected to Soviet demands for a
moratorium on testing.
Chernenko's call for talks on "the
entire complex of arms-control is
sues closely parallels Reagan's sug
gestion at the United Nations last
September for "umbrella talks" on
wide-ranging arms issues.
