# World Court rules against U.S.
## 
### 
THE HAGUE, Netherlands — The Interna
tional Court of Justice ruled unanimously yesterday
to accept Nicaragua's suit demanding a halt in U.S.
support for "military and paramilitary activities"
against the Sandinista government.
The 16-judge panel, also known as the World
Court, handed down the interim decision after
rejecting by a 15-to-l vote the U.S. argument that
the court did not hold proper jurisdiction to try the
case. An American, Stephen Schwebel. was the
lone dissenter.
The judgment, which opens the way for further
hearings in which Nicaragua is likely to press for
compensation, came as another propaganda blow
to the Reagan administration's policy of supporting
opponents of the Sandinista government.
"We are deeply disappointed by the court's deci

sion," Davis Robinson, the State Department legal
adviser handling the case, said after yesterday's ses
sion. "We think we presented compelling argu
ments why this is not the appropriate forum for
resolving complex conflicts in Central America."
Carlos Arguello Gomez, the chief counsel for the
Nicaraguan government, said he was "happy and
hopeful that the court's decision will open a new
avenue for Nicaragua's search for peace."
Arguello said the United States "will become re
garded as an international delinquent" if it refuses
to abide by the findings of the court.
In Washington, State Department spokesman
Alan Romberg, said at the daily State Department
news briefing that the United States was
"disappointed with the court's decision" and con
tinues to believe "that the court is not the proper

forum, either as a matter of law or for helping to
achieve a peaceful resolution ot the conflict in the
region."
Later, an official in the department s legal ad
viser's office said the United States would not
decide whether to accept the court's ruling and par
ticipate in further sessions until U.S. officials have
had a chance to read the opinion, which has not yet
been received in Washington.
Paul Reichler, a Washington attorney who
represents Nicaragua, called the ruling a "complete
vindication of Nicaragua's decision to go to the
court" over the dispute and of its view that "the
court is the proper forum" for settling such
disputes.
