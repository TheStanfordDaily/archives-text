## The
						Stanford Daily Libyan hypocrisy 
### 
As long as the University is mulling over its in
vestments in South Africa, maybe it ought to con
sider divesting from corporations doing business
in another totalitarian African country: Libya.
We've never been particularly fond of this bru
tal regime, which thinks nothing of murdering ex
patriate dissidents and shooting into a crowd of
demonstrators from its embassy. But recent
revelations make Libya's past conduct seem
meek by comparison and make continued U.S.
investment in the country intolerable.
Last week the Egyptian government an
nounced that it had foiled a plot to kill a former
Libyan prime minister living in Egypt. The story
which unraveled not only reads like a cloak-and
dagger thriller, but also conclusively demonstrates
Libya's direct involvement in worldwide assas
sination. After uncovering the murder plans,
Egypt patched together some fake photographs
which showed the prime minister bound and
gagged and splattered with blood. Egyptian
agents saw to it that the photos were delivered to
the Libyan ambassador in Malta, where the
would-be assassins had been based. The ambas
sador immediately flew to Crete — where Libyan
leader Moammar Khadafy was meeting with
French President Francois Mitterand — to
deliver the good news. Libya triumphantly an

nounced the death of the prime minister a few
days later.
Meanwhile, the apprehended assassins had
done a lot of talking to their Egyptian inter
rogators. And before revealing the photograph
hoax, Cairo notified the governments of Britain,
Germany, France, Pakistan, India and Saudi
Arabia of Libyan plans to kill political leaders in
those countries. Based on their new information,
Egyptian intelligence officials became convinced
that Libya was also involved in the assassination
of Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.
It was also discovered last week that Libya has
kept about 1,000 of its soldiers in Chad in viola
tion of the troop pullout accord with France.
All of this comes on top of what we've known
about Libya for some time, now: that it suppres
ses all dissent within its borders and foments
armed violence outside them.
Given this record, it is unconscionable for
American oil companies to continue in a partner
ship of profit with Libya. It is ridiculous for the
Reagan administration to try to isolate Khadafy
diplomatically while our corporations fill his cof
fers with the royalty money he uses to buy weap
ons and assassins. Stanford should have no part
of this hypocrisy.
