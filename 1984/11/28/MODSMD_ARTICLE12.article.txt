## Tensions and the women's rights struggle 
### 
The altered status of women in the Stanford
community and in the nation as a whole has
brought about profound changes in the self
conceptions of both sexes and in the structure
of the American family. Despite the signifi
cance of the subject, the popular treatments
of "women's issues" (a misnomer, consider
ing that such subjects should be of concern to
all) have formed a curious dichotomy. For the
most part, Stanford's various student publica
tions and public fora offer either lighthearted
essays that intentionally ignore the changes of
recent decades or all-too-serious arguments
about the conspiratorial implications of tall
buildings. While such expositions often
produce amusement (in the latter case, unin
tentionally), they shed little light on the
topic and, regrettably, detract from a broader
understanding of social transformations.
Like the black civil-rights campaign, the
struggle for women's rights has exhibited the
fundamental tension beneath all social move
ments based on a single immutable character
istic: the conflict between the desire to assert
equality and the powerful impulse to retain
identifiable differences. Blacks wish to in
tegrate themselves with the mainstream of
American society yet harbor legitimate con
cerns regarding the maintenance of an inde
pendent ethnic identity. Similarly, women
seek equality most overtly in economic terms;
yet as the feminist movement discovered (to

its surprise), many remain skeptical of efforts
to abolish the distinctions that define feminin
ity itself. Indeed, the value of feminist schol
arship lies not in its depiction of the world as
one of invidious subjugation but in its efforts
to alert both genders to the manner in which
collective presuppositions influence individ
ual attitudes and behavior. If current trends

Many remain skeptical

the distinctions that
define femininity it
self.

continue, such efforts will ultimately elimi
nate illegitimate distinctions that hinder
women in the marketplace; equally impor
tant, they have the capacity to liberate men
from the peculiar necessity of continually
reconfirming their masculinity.
The civil-rights movement's efforts to open
the "door of opportunity" to blacks stand to
benefit a very particular type of person. A so
ciety purged of racism would serve the inter
ests of the black intellectual elite eager to

enter previously restricted professions but,
perversely, may not serve the interest of those
who — rightly or wrongly — have no such
aspirations. Such people frequently label suc
cessful black lawyers and doctors as "traitors"
to their race precisely because such tangible
examples put other members of the group in a
decidedly negative light.
Likewise, among its multifaceted objec
tives, the women's movement seeks to confer
enchanced status on a subgroup heretofore
inhibited by social barriers: career-minded
female intellectuals. Leaders of the move
ment do not recognize, however, that such a
change involves an implicit (though perhaps
unintended) deprecation of those that the
traditional view would otherwise place on a
pedestal: namely, women who are physically
beautiful and skilled in social graces but who
— for whatever reason — are not intellec
tually inclined.
This subtle distrnctfon takes on greater sig
nificance in the Stanford community where,'
as a result of a selective admissions policy, an
unusually high number of women combine
the characteristics of both groups. As the
fabled "Stanford woman" studies advanced
circuitry or colonialism in Latin America, she
nonetheless must think of William Butler
Yeats' telling observation that every woman,
from the day she is born, knows that she must
be beautiful. The patterns of behavior that

will help such a pe r son earn stellar grades si
multaneously remove her from everything so
ciety has taught her she should be. Unlike the
antipathy between differently situated blacks,
such a phenomenon concentrates the dialogue
of conflicting doubts and recriminations
within the psyche of a single individual. This,
perhaps more than any other factor, accounts

The women's move
ment seeks to confer
enhanced status on
... career-minded
female intellectuals.

for the profound unease of women in higher
education.
Aside from providing psychological in
sights, such an observation may also shed light
on the residential system that in large part or
ganizes personal relationships. Where else
could a woman study physics for an after
noon, return to her room, change her clothes
(and seemingly her self-conception) and dash
off to a gathering where she is rewarded on
the basis of charm and physical appeal?

Despite the eloquent protestations of in
numerable fraternity presidents, the Greek
system does not exist primarily to cultivate so
cial skills. Human beings can surely imagine
more meaningful methods of social interac
tion than meandering about a room teeming
with intoxicated people. Rather, in an age of
ambiguous sex roles (typified by the
popularity of "Tootsie," Boy George and Mi
chael Jackson), the fraternity system offers a
secure — though arguably artificial — envi
ronment wherein these roles are clearly
defined. To put it directly, it is a place where
men are men and women are women, at least
as these roles have been traditionally under
stood. In a residential system that attempts to
justify ethnically based living groups as means
to ease the transition between a minority
community and the Stanford campus, one
could credibly argue that a gender-based
scheme acts as a means of catharsis in a time
of widespread anxiety regarding sex roles'- -
It is not at all clear that there exists a point
of termination to the conflicting doubts in the
minds of both men and women. For the mo
ment, one can only hope that the institutions
used to mask these tensions will act as means
of eventual resolution rather than avoidance.

The altered status of women in the Stanford
community and in the nation as a whole has
brought about profound changes in the self
conceptions of both sexes and in the structure
of the American family. Despite the signifi
cance of the subject, the popular treatments
of "women's issues" (a misnomer, consider
ing that such subjects should be of concern to
all) have formed a curious dichotomy. For the
most part, Stanford's various student publica
tions and public fora offer either lighthearted
essays that intentionally ignore the changes of
recent decades or all-too-serious arguments
about the conspiratorial implications of tall
buildings. While such expositions often
produce amusement (in the latter case, unin
tentionally), they shed little light on the
topic and, regrettably, detract from a broader
understanding of social transformations.
Like the black civil-rights campaign, the
struggle for women's rights has exhibited the
fundamental tension beneath all social move
ments based on a single immutable character
istic: the conflict between the desire to assert
equality and the powerful impulse to retain
identifiable differences. Blacks wish to in
tegrate themselves with the mainstream of
American society yet harbor legitimate con
cerns regarding the maintenance of an inde
pendent ethnic identity. Similarly, women
seek equality most overtly in economic terms;
yet as the feminist movement discovered (to

its surprise), many remain skeptical of efforts
to abolish the distinctions that define feminin
ity itself. Indeed, the value of feminist schol
arship lies not in its depiction of the world as
one of invidious subjugation but in its efforts
to alert both genders to the manner in which
collective presuppositions influence individ
ual attitudes and behavior. If current trends

the distinctions that

self.

continue, such efforts will ultimately elimi
nate illegitimate distinctions that hinder
women in the marketplace; equally impor
tant, they have the capacity to liberate men
from the peculiar necessity of continually
reconfirming their masculinity.
The civil-rights movement's efforts to open
the "door of opportunity" to blacks stand to
benefit a very particular type of person. A so
ciety purged of racism would serve the inter
ests of the black intellectual elite eager to

enter previously restricted professions but,
perversely, may not serve the interest of those
who — rightly or wrongly — have no such
aspirations. Such people frequently label suc
cessful black lawyers and doctors as "traitors"
to their race precisely because such tangible
examples put other members of the group in a
decidedly negative light.
Likewise, among its multifaceted objec
tives, the women's movement seeks to confer
enchanced status on a subgroup heretofore
inhibited by social barriers: career-minded
female intellectuals. Leaders of the move
ment do not recognize, however, that such a
change involves an implicit (though perhaps
unintended) deprecation of those that the
traditional view would otherwise place on a
pedestal: namely, women who are physically
beautiful and skilled in social graces but who
— for whatever reason — are not intellec
tually inclined.
This subtle distrnctfon takes on greater sig
nificance in the Stanford community where,'
as a result of a selective admissions policy, an
unusually high number of women combine
the characteristics of both groups. As the
fabled "Stanford woman" studies advanced
circuitry or colonialism in Latin America, she
nonetheless must think of William Butler
Yeats' telling observation that every woman,
from the day she is born, knows that she must
be beautiful. The patterns of behavior that

will help such a pe r son earn stellar grades si
multaneously remove her from everything so
ciety has taught her she should be. Unlike the
antipathy between differently situated blacks,
such a phenomenon concentrates the dialogue
of conflicting doubts and recriminations
within the psyche of a single individual. This,
perhaps more than any other factor, accounts

The women's move
ment seeks to confer
enhanced status on
... career-minded
female intellectuals.

for the profound unease of women in higher
education.
Aside from providing psychological in
sights, such an observation may also shed light
on the residential system that in large part or
ganizes personal relationships. Where else
could a woman study physics for an after
noon, return to her room, change her clothes
(and seemingly her self-conception) and dash
off to a gathering where she is rewarded on
the basis of charm and physical appeal?

Despite the eloquent protestations of in
numerable fraternity presidents, the Greek
system does not exist primarily to cultivate so
cial skills. Human beings can surely imagine
more meaningful methods of social interac
tion than meandering about a room teeming
with intoxicated people. Rather, in an age of
