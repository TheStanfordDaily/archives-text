SCIRE merits credit
As a former intern through the
Student Center for Innovation in
Research and Education (SCIRE), I
am disturbed to learn of the recent
recommendation of the Review
Committee on Extradepartmental
Education to eliminate SCIRE (The
Daily, Nov. 26).
SCIRE serves a vital function on
campus; namely, it provides students
with educational experiences of
fieldwork, planning and developing
courses, initiating task forces and
funding for innovative projects that
are not available through University
departments. SCIRE grants credit
for internships and projects that are
interdisciplinary, supplementing
classroom learning with experiential
education.
What brings students to SCIRE in
the first place is a desire to explore
innovative educational experiences
that are not available through the
departments. In my case, I was inter
ested in studying peace and in
studying women in history. Through
SCIRE I got involved in an oral
history project of women peace
activists in the Bay Area. This proj
ect has been one of my most enrich
ing educational experiences here at
Stanford, complementing my course
work in history and in peace studies
and greatly enhancing my knowledge
and interest in this area. An aca
demic opportunity of this nature was
not available through departments,
but does this make it less academic?
The Review Committee report
identifies the credit aspect of SCIRE
as problematic, implicitly asserting
that extradepartmental internships
are not worthy of credit. The com
mittee suggests doing away with
SCIRE, and thus with credit for
SCIRE internships, and instead
providing the same Clearinghouse
Catalog listings that SCIRE offers to
students interested in volunteering.
But why shouldn't the student who
wants to do a long-term, in-depth
internship or project with an aca
demic emphasis be rewarded with
credit? In my case, it would have
been impossible for me to pursue the
oral history project on a volunteer
basis and get the same educational
benefits out of it, accrued from
writing a lengthy research paper at
the end. And as a student on finan-

cial aid, I cannot afford to use the
time in which I am not getting credit
as a volunteer. When I am not study
ing, 1 am working to help pay my
educational debts. Should students
on financial aid be severely hindered
from pursuing fieldwork opportuni
ties because no credit is available to
them?
Although SCIREs catalog listings
are not limited to public-service
agencies, many students do pursue
community-service internships and
projects. Accrediting students for
their long-term, intensive commit
ment and their related research for
final SCIRE papers encourages
students to regard public service
seriously, and not merely as a short
term, volunteer activity.
The University should rethink
what valuable educational opportu
nities SCIRE offers students and
preserve its accrediting functions, not
eliminate them.

Reagan a Keynesian
In a recent column for The Daily
(Nov. 20), Loren Borud attributes
the Reagan landslide to the success
of "Reaganomics," which he claims
is conclusive evidence against
Keynesian economic theory. Nothing
could be further from the truth.
Indeed, the facts indicate that Presi
dent Reagan is probably the most
Keynesian president the United
States has ever had.
Borud argues that the "time scale
of the economic recovery is discon
certing to the Keynesians." Accord
ing to Borud, the recovery began on
the date the tax cuts became effec
tiveâ€” Jan. 1, 1982. This event
would indeed be disconcerting to all
but the supply-side fringe if it were
true. However. Reagan's own Eco
nomic Report of 1984 dates the
beginning of the recovery as Novem
ber 1982. Furthermore, the first
round of Reagan tax cuts actually
took effect on July 1, 1981, over a
year earlier.
The most glaring error in Borud's
article, however, lies in his presump
tion that tax cuts are not an integral
part of Keynesian anti-recessionary
policy. Borud points approvingly at
what he terms "the only tl*Ue macro
economic precedent to Reagan's

30-percent tax cut: the Kennedy tax
cuts." Apparently, Borud is unaware
that the Kennedy tax cuts were
proposed and designed entirely by
Keynesian economists, and these
cuts have now become a textbook
example of the success of fiscal
stimulation. In this respect, the
Reagan tax cuts are no different. By
lowering taxes without lowering
government spending, Reagan has
given businesses and households
more money with which to consume
and invest. The pattern of the
recovery clearly shows that it was led
by consumer spending and business
investment, which depleted inven
tories and caused firms to increase
production. A supply-led recovery
should have occurred in the reverse
order, and it was the abysmal failure
of supply-siders to correctly predict
the timing of the recovery that led to
their disappearance from policy
making circles in the administration
during 1982.
Another major error in Borud's
column is his contention that budget
deficits are currently running at $140
billion and will decline even more
with continued economic growth.
According to Time magazine (Nov.
26), the Office of Management and
Budget has just announced that the
current budget deficit is $200 billion
and will stay above $160 billion
through 1989 even under the most
optimistic projections of economic
growth. It is precisely these budget
deficits that have led some observers
to call Reagan our most Keynesian
president ever.
While it is certainly true that most
Americans are happy with
Reaganomics so far, a continuation
of current economic policies for
another four years could yield ad
verse consequences. Reagan's budget
deficits have been financed in part by
record inflows of foreign money.
These capital inflows have forced the
value of the dollar to such a high
level that our manufacturing indus
tries cannot compete ef 112 'ively with
foreign manufactures. '.;it recovery
has thus been an unbalanced one,
with the bulk of economic growth
concentrated in defense, service and
high-tech industries, while the
agriculture, machinery, steel and
housing industries remain in reces
sion. In the long run, the richest
nation on earth cannot continue to

borrow such massive amounts from
its neighbors, many of whom are
struggling to service their own debts
and are suffering greatly from high
U.S. interest rates. When the capital
inflow finally stops, we will need our
agricultural and manufacturing sec
tors to fill the foreign-exchange gap.
The longer Reagan postpones this
day of reckoning, the weaker will
these industries be and the adjust
ment will be all the more traumatic.

Damn the torpedoes
On Monday morning, Nov. 19, my
blue Toyota was the victim of a
hit-and-run driver. The car was
parked well within the lines, in the
"C" parking lot off Serra Street, and
could have been struck only through
carelessness. The right rear fender is
damaged in such a way that a new
fender will be required.
This is not the first time a car of
mine has been hit in a Stanford
parking lot, nor, I suspect, is it the
last. But why does it always have to
be hit-and-run? If 1 damaged some
one's car, my conscience would not
let me leave the scene without giving
full information and leaving it on the
windshield for the other driver. This
is simple common courtesy, and also
the reason we carry auto insurance,
so problems like this can be taken
care of reasonably.
Why is it such a big deal to own up
to causing an accident and letting
your insurance company cover the
cost? Is it possible that you have
done this so many times that no
insurance company will cover you? Is
it fun?
Stanford University is known for
the excellent quality of the faculty,
staff and students here. Unfortun
ately, there also seem to be some
rotten apples in the barrel who spoil
things for everyone else.
Lest the hit-and-run drivers who
are innocent of this particular acci
dent think I am not speaking to
them, think again. This is for all of
you. I do not consider myself a vin
dictive person, but I would manage
quite well to withhold even crocodile
tears if a freeway overpass should
collapse on you
