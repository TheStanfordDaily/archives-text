Ask not what The Daily can do for your opinion, but
rather what your opinion can do for The Daily. In this
paper, as in the hearts of the people who wrote a letter
to The Daily, the memory of relevant opinion is
enshrined forever. You know the rules: typed double
spaced anu delivered by any means to The Stanford
Daily, Storke Student Publications Building, Stanford,
CA 94035. Don't be afraid to include your name, phone
number and Stanford affiliation if applicable. Remem
ber, submission can be fun.
