# Tri Delt sorority seeks University recognition
## 
### MARK BEYREIS Staff writer 
Three Stanford students have established a campus
chapter of the Delta Delta Delta sorority, gained recogni
tion from the sorority's national organization and are cur
rently seeking official University recognition.
Sophomores Aleka Doumas and Jill Nelson and junior
Stacy Torres said they began organizing the group last
summer because they thought it would be a "fun idea to
get in on the ground floor of a new sorority."
The students also said that they wanted to create their
own group so that they would have more input in estab
lishing rush practices, fund-raisers and other functions
than they would in an existing sorority.
"Basically, we're offering students another choice,"
Nelson said.
If the "Tri Delt" women achieve their goal, Delta Delta
Delta will be the eighth sorority recognized here since the
University lifted a 33-year ban on sororities in 1977.
The group received official recognition from its national
organization last Tuesday, according to Tri Delt spokes
women.
The representatives of the newly formed group first
sought the approval of Stanford's Inter-Sorority Council,
which voted unanimously that the Tri Delts would form a
productive and non-discriminatory sorority, according to
Tri Delt spokeswomen.
The ISC's vote allowed recognition of the local chapter
by the national Tri Delt organization. But University ad
ministrators use their own criteria to decide whether to
recognize fraternal groups.

To be recognized by the University, a sorority must
prove that it is autonomous from its national organization
in the selection and governing of its members. The Tri
Delts must submit to Stanford a petition from its members
and a letter from the national body stating that the
sorority is indeed autonomous.
"We are pretty sure we'll be recognized by the Univer
sity," Nelson said.
Leaders of the group said they expect the sorority to
gain University recognition before' prospective members
rush this spring.
Until the sorority is officially recognized, the Tri Delts
cannot claim to be a Stanford organization or use any of
the University's facilities. This means that the approxi
mately 30 students planning to pledge this week will have
to do so off campus.
Doumas said that meeting off-campus has been a bur
den but that the sorority has received a great deal of sup
port from area alumnae and other sororities on campus.
Sororities were banned from Stanford in 1944 by the
University Board of Trustees following a student referen
dum that opposed their continued existence on the
grounds that they created extreme social pressures.
These "pressures" were due in part to the high percentage
of women at Stanford during World War 11. In 1943 there
were five applicants for every place in a sorority.
The ban was lifted in 1977 after a group of students
fought to reinstitute sororities because they provide "a
chance for women to get together."
It was not until 1980 that the first postwar sorority,
Delta Gamma, actually received University recognition.
