## Front line leads aggressive Cardinal to 3-point victory 
### JOHN LIS Daily staff 
Some teams just won't be denied. The Stanford
women's basketball team was one of those teams last
night when it scrapped, played aggressively and made its
free throws to defeat San Jose State University, 75-72. in
Maples Pavilion.
"We all wanted to win badly," Cardinal guard Sue
Sebolt said. "We just bore down and fought till the end."
Stanford Coach Dotty McCrea was more than satisfied
with her team's effort. "We played with such heart." she
said. "I think of us as being a blue-collar team. We have to
get angry when we're out there. This was one of the best
wins I've had here.
The Cardinal's victory also came with junior guard Vir
ginia Sourlis. Stanford's top scorer last season, out with a
hyperextended knee. "It was a great win without Vir
ginia," McCrea said.
Before the game. McCrea said three Cardinal scorers
would need to score in double figures for Stanford to win.
Three did. Freshman forward Kami Anderson led all
scorers with her second-straight 2()-point game, scoring 16
in the second half. Forward Karen Goedewaagen finished
with 18. including a 10-of-13 showing from the free
throw line, and center Kim Mercer had 14. The Cardinal
got 62 points from its five front-line players.
"I didn't expect to score 20 points a game," Anderson
said. "My goal at the beginning of the year was just to
start.
"1 don't score 20 points on my own. I score 20 points
with my teammates passing to me."

Anderson and Mercer got many of their points off jump
shots from the eorner of the foul line. A well-executed of
fense enabled them to he open consistently, and the Card
inal totaled 13 assists, many to players taking open
jumpers from the foul line. Freshman guard Charli Turner
had four assists, and guard Erica Mueser and forward
Mary Bradach had three each.
Goedewaagen said. "We had individuals coming out
tonight, finally, and being scorers, being a threat. It
breaks down any defense if you attack it aggressively."
Stanford came back from a first-half performance that
was sometimes sloppy to hold off the Spartans in the
second half. The Cardinal trailed, 35-33, at halftime in a
foul-plagued first half. Stanford was called for 15 fouls,
while the Spartans were whistled 13 times.
The Cardinal never led by more than seven points, but
made its free throws late in the game. Stanford made 12 of
1 5 in the second half and 72 percent in the game.
McCrea also used a lineup of two freshmen — Ander
son and Turner — and three sophomores —
Goedewaagen, Mercer and Sebolt — in the final minutes.
McCrea left in Turner instead of Mueser, a sophomore,
and kept Bradach, the team's only senior, on the bench.
"We talked a lot about going with Mary (Bradach) and
Erica (Mueser)," McCrea said, "but the group out there
was winning, so we decided to stick with them. They
started believing in themselves — it was a real confidence
builder."
Stanford evened its record at 2-2 while San Jose State
fell to 1-2. The Cardinal faces Pepperdine University at
Maples Pavilion Friday at 4:30 p.m.
