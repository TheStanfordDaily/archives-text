Holy Sacrameno, Batman! It's time
to declare for the Volume 187 elec
tion.
That's correct, Robin. Declarations
must he placed in Date's mailbox by
midnight on Tuesday, Dec. 4.
Duck, Batman! There's a dark
horse just back from Oxford in the
running and he's coming right at us
BAM! WHOP! POW!
Holy turtle. Batman. That was a
close call.
Don't relax just yet, Robin. The
Bat-pre-declaration-polygraph-lie
detector attached to my belt is still lit.
Holy Tim Wirth, Batman! A
holographic herd of heinous her
culean henchmen headed this way.
Only an apparition, Robin.
Holy seven-year-old girls. Batman!
The Chicago Seven up on the roof!
Stay tough, chum. No one would
elect an old ops editor.
