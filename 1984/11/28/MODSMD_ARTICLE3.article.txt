# SIDO raises awareness
## Students try for concrete impact in Third World 
### JOHN CALLON 
Third World issues are everyone's
concern, but opportunities for con
crete involvement come few and far
between.
The Overseas Development Net
work and its Stanford affiliate, the
Stanford International Development
Organization, are new student organ
izations designed to "provide an out
let for people who have an interest" in
Third World affairs, according to
sophomore Lucy Perkins, head of
SIDO's Development Education
Group.
ODN is a national student consor
tium concerned with innovative and
educational approaches to Third
World development. It allows college
students to "make a specific commit
ment" through the adoption of a
small-scale development project, said

Nazir Ahmad, one of ODN's co
founders and a third-year graduate
student at the Food Research In
stitute.
"We're not talking about all the
hungry in the world, but about so
many grandfathers, 'X' number of
people in a specific village," he said.
A clearinghouse group is also com
piling a listing of development
related employment opportunities
and internships.
ODN, begun in the summer of
1983 by Ahmad and his younger
brother, Kamal, a sophomore at Har
vard, now boasts 25 chapters
nationwide.
In choosing to assist a particular
project, Ahmad emphasized that "we
believe they are an indigenous people
with their own initiative. They come

up with the ideas. We ask questions
to satisfy ourselves. We don't tell
them how to do their project."
SIDO is raising funds for 100
Bangladesh women to start a business
using their skills in rice-husking, net
making, sewing and a variety of hand
icrafts.
ODN has chosen to concentrate on
Bangladesh at first because "with lim
ited resources, we didn't want to get
spread all over." But the organization
does have plans to expand to several
countries, he said.
Ahmad said he feels that the net
work "has really filled a need. Some
thing like this hasn't existed. People
don't have to re-invent the wheel. • • •
That's the magic of this network.
People will share resources. Word
