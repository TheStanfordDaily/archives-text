# ASSU Senate OKs boycott of Motorola
## 
### CLINT HIGHFILL Senior staff writer 
The ASSU Senate voted last night
to urge Stanford students and alumni
to boycott Motorola Corp. products,
and to recommend the postponement
of a decision on the proposed reor
ganization of extradepartmental aca
demic programs.
The senate also allocated about
$14,000 of Publications Board and
Program Board monies to student
groups and publications and resolved
that the Stanford Police Department
should review its post-Big Game ac
tions.
The boycott of Motorola products
is one half of a resolution intended to
penalize the company for its employ
ment and sales practices in South
Africa.
The other half of the resolution
mandates that "the senate urge the
Career Planning and Placement Cen
ter (CPPC), the Graduate School of
Business Placement Center, and
other University placement services
to inform all potential applicants for
employment . . . that the Stanford
Commission on Investment Respon
sibility (C-IR) has found Motorola's
sales ... to Ihe South African police
and military to be socially injurious."
A Motorola spokesman told The
Daily yesterday he had not previously

heard of the resolution. "We are
surprised by this resolution and don't
feel it's appropriate to comment at
this time," he said.
CPPC Director Chris Shinkman
said the CPPC would have "no objec
tion to written materials here'" in
forming interviewees of the C-1R fin
dings on Motorola.
Graduate Senator Mark Landes
mann, one of the bill's sponsors, said
economic protests were necessary be
cause profits are the company's only
motivation.
The company was not serving any
other interest than profit by selling
electronic equipment to the South
African military and police and by
failing to comply adequately with the
Sullivan Employment Principles for
companies operating in the country,
Landesmann said.
The second of three resolutions ap
proved by the senate at last night's
meeting requests that Dean of
Humanities and Sciences Carolyn
L.ougee "defer any decision" on thi
future of "the extradepartmental pro
grams SWOPSI, SCIRE, UGS,
ARLO and URO . . . until at least
February 1, 1985."
The delay is intended to enable the
"issues raised by the Policy
Boards and staffs of SWOPSI and
SCIRE" to be considered and to
enable greater student input before
the final decision on the future of the
programs is made.
The Committee on Undergraduate
Studies is scheduled to meet today to
consider the future of those pro
grams.
The senate also approved the fund
ing request of the Publications Board
and most of the budget submitted by
the Program Board. A lump sum of
money is set aside for the boards each
year, and twice per quarter the
boards appear before the senate to
request allocation of that money for
particular student groups and
publications.
The Program Board budget faced a
barrage of cost-cutting amendments

initiated by Graduate Senator James
McGrath prior to the budget's even
tual acceptance. Debate over the
many amendments consumed much
of the senate's meeting time, but en
abled approximately $1,500 to be
slashed from the total amount all
ocated in this funding cycle.
The final resolution passed by the
senate called on the Stanford Police
Department to conduct an internal
review of actions taken by its officers
after Big Game and to improve its
communication with the Stanford
community.
Senator Derek Passarelli, the
resolution's sponsor, said
"insufficient notice was given" to
Stanford students telling them not to
enter the playing field after the game
at Berkeley's Memorial Stadium.
Passarelli said his resolution was
intended to "patch things up between
students and the police."
The senate also received an update
on the progress of the proposed Stan

ford to San Francisco shuttle bus ser
vice.
Senator Bob Slater, chairman of a
special committee formed expressly
to consider the shuttle, said several
options for the shuttle are being in
vestigated.
The committee is considering
having one bus leave for the City late
in afternoon and return around mid
night; having a group of Sinclair Ser
vice Vans drive students to the City
and back in one group; and having a
specific Sam Trans bus allocated to
drive students back to campus. Slater
said.
The first two ideas are designed to
overcome the problem of leaving
people stranded in the City due to a
shortage of space on the final bus or
van returning to campus. The com
mittee foresaw a problem with stu
dents going to the City at various
times during the day and then all
waiting to return on the last shuttle,
Slater said.
