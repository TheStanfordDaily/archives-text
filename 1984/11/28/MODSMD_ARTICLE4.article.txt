### CLINT HIGHFILL Senior staff writer 
The ASSU Senate voted last night
to urge Stanford students and alumni
to boycott Motorola Corp. products,
and to recommend the postponement
of a decision on the proposed reor
ganization of extradepartmental aca
demic programs.
The senate also allocated about
$14,000 of Publications Board and
Program Board monies to student
groups and publications and resolved
that the Stanford Police Department
should review its post-Big Game ac
tions.
The boycott of Motorola products
is one half of a resolution intended to
penalize the company for its employ
ment and sales practices in South
Africa.
The other half of the resolution
mandates that "the senate urge the
Career Planning and Placement Cen

Business Placement Center, and
other University placement services

employment . . . that the Stanford
Commission on Investment Respon

sales ... to Ihe South African police
and military to be socially injurious."
A Motorola spokesman told The
Daily yesterday he had not previously

heard of the resolution. "We are
surprised by this resolution and don't
feel it's appropriate to comment at
this time," he said.
CPPC Director Chris Shinkman
said the CPPC would have "no objec

forming interviewees of the C-1R fin
dings on Motorola.
Graduate Senator Mark Landes
mann, one of the bill's sponsors, said
economic protests were necessary be
cause profits are the company's only
motivation.
The company was not serving any
other interest than profit by selling
electronic equipment to the South
African military and police and by
failing to comply adequately with the
Sullivan Employment Principles for
companies operating in the country,
Landesmann said.
The second of three resolutions ap
proved by the senate at last night's
meeting requests that Dean of
Humanities and Sciences Carolyn
L.ougee "defer any decision" on thi
future of "the extradepartmental pro
grams SWOPSI, SCIRE, UGS,
ARLO and URO . . . until at least
February 1, 1985."
The delay is intended to enable the
"issues raised by the Policy
