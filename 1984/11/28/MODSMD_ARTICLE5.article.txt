# Police deny excessive force
## 
### GREGORY WEINGARTEN Staff writer 
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Herrington yesterday
refuted charges that police used excessive force against
students at the Big Game, saying the officers used only
what force was necessary to avert a potentially more dan
gerous situation.
"Usually if you do lose the field, what you end up with
is a riot," Herrington said. "People get hurt. We had a
very nasty scene at Stanford before the security fence was
put up.
Once the "mob psychology" takes over, Herrington
said, "no one can tell what can happen."
"Many college stadiums have had serious injuries after
the game. Half the people in the crowds are drunk, and
their judgment is shot," Herrington said.
Herrington spoke before about 70 students in Branner
Lounge. Sgt. Nick Bruno, the officer in charge of the
Stanford police force at the game, also spoke.
Herrington felt that several points were left out of The
Daily's coverage of the incident.
"They (The Daily) came out against the police depart
ment in their editorial ("The Big Maim," Nov. 26) with
out ever interviewing me.
"There was no mention until yesterday that there were
warnings given over loud speakers not to go on the field
and a sign on the scoreboard," Herrington said.
Herrington said that no one was hit by a night stick but
"maybe [someone was] shoved." He added that every of
ficer there was struck by spectators or by objects thrown
from the stands.
Bruno said he saw Big Game fans strike his own offi
cers, Berkeley police and student security forces ("Yellow
Jackets"). Bruno also said that beginning at halftime, stu
dents pelted the officers with food and beer.

"One captain was hit between the eyes by a bagel. None
of us expected that would happen," he said.
Bruno said the Yellow Jacket security force of Berkeley
students was supposed to keep the students off the field,
but after about five minutes, people started to break
through the security line. He said it was at that point that
the fight started.
"We took action because assault was taking place on
the security people. People who refused to leave were
herded back onto the stands," he said.
Herrington said he felt that force was necessary to keep
the "wave of students" off the field. "There were a num
ber of people who, given ordinary circumstances, would
have been arrested," he said.
According to Herrington, students caused seveial
hundred dollars' worth of damage. He said that a sound
system was destroyed, and that some individuals in the
Berkeley security force want to bring charges against
Stanford students.
Herrington said the police department has not received
any complaints thus far from individuals who claim to
have been mistreated by the force. He suspects that some
people have been reluctant to talk because they are afraid
of charges being brought against them by Berkeley police.
He explained that Berkeley police organized the secur
ity system. According to Herrington, the officers there
didn't think people would jump the wall with the security
force present.
"I wish I had spoken to the Berkeley chief. More heavy
warnings could've avoided it. but that didn't happen," he
said.
"I've encouraged Berkeley to build a fence, and I don't
want to get my people involved in this type of experience
again," Herrington said.
