Unrest continues in Chile
SANII AGO, Chile — Thousands of troops patrolled the capital and
some opened fire on demonstrators yesterday as the government of Gen.
Augusto Pinochet sought to suppress nationwide demonstrations called
to defy a state of siege.
In the onset of a crucial two-day challenge to the government, opposi
tion leaders gathered in the central Plaza de Armas at midday and stu
dents rallied at campuses around Santiago. Clandestine leaflets called
for neighborhood protests last night and a halt of urban activities today.
Six bombs exploded in Santiago Monday night, including a powerful
car bomb set in a side street facing the presidential palace. In the north
ern city of Arica. President Pinochet was forced to cancel his schedule of
activities after his arrival late Monday was greeted with violent
demonstrations.
The government responded to the opposition with the strongest secur
ity measures adopted this year. Army and air force troops were stationed
on street corners and around bus and train stations, bridges and utilities
beginning early yesterday morning.
Plot to bomb embassy uncovered
ROME — Eight men suspected of planning a suicide-bomb attack
against the U.S. Embassy in Rome — "the same as in Beirut" — have
been arrested here and in Zurich, Switzerland, Italian police sources said
yesterday.
Six of the men, al! reportedly Lebanese citizens, were arrested at a
beach resort near Rome last Sunday after a seventh Lebanese was
detained outside the U.S. Embassy on Rome's Via Veneto.
The man picked up near the embassy had a map in his pocket showing
the layout of the embassy, including special security arrangements that
were installed after attacks last year against the U.S. Embassy and
Marine headquarters in Beirut, one of the sources said.
I he eighth alleged plotter, whose nationality was not disclosed but
who police said was linked to the seven others, was arrested in Zurich,
carrying two kilograms (4.4 pounds) of high explosives as he attempted
to leave Switzerland for Rome late last week, according to a source in
Italy's special anti-terrorist police.
Soviets increase military budget
MOSCOW — The Kremlin leadership yesterday announced a 12-per
cent increase in military spending for next year in an apparent response
to a rapid rise in U.S. defense outlays.
The military budget, which officially held steady during the past four
years, will rise to 19.06 billion rubles (about $23 billion) in 1985. The
disclosure was made at a meeting of the Supreme Soviet, the Soviet
Union's nominal Parliament.
Western experts say that actual Soviet defense spending may be two
or three times higher than the publicly announced figure, which equals
4.9 percent of the entire budget. The Western sources said 15 percent
was probably nearer to the real figure.
Restaurant strike threatens City
SAN FRANCISCO — Five decades after a general strike brought San
Francisco to a virtual standstill, a stalled restaurant walkout has raised
the threat of a citywide shutdown that could put more than 100,000
workers on the picket line.
The proposal, backed unanimously by the 130-member San Francisco
Labor Council on Monday night, is to be taken up today by the council's
17-member executive committee following an AFL-CIO "Council of
War" meeting.
The idea surfaced as union officials sought new leverage in the restau
rant strike that began on Labor Day.
FBI arrests 6 in abduction case
NEW YORK — FBI agents have arrested six Koreans for allegedly
kidnapping and torturing the acting leader of Rev. Sun Myung Moon's
Unification Church in a scheme to extort $1 million from the church, of
ficials announced yesterday.
Bo Hi Pak, who is also chairman of News World Communications,
publisher of the Washington Times, the New York City Tribune and Los
Angeles' Noticias Del Mundo, was released unharmed two days after his
Sept. 23 abduction from outside a Manhattan hotel, according to Lee
Laster, assistant director in charge of the New York FBI office. The ar
rests were made in the last five days and the ransom was not paid.
Two of the kidnappers, including retired Korean Marine Gen. Sang
Whi Nam, were members of the church. Although a lawyer for another
defendant said that the kidnapping stems from a "power struggle" in the
church, Laster and Rudolph Guiliani, U.S. attorney for the Southern
District of New York, said that investigators had ruled out an internal
church squabble as a motive. "As far as I'm concerned, it was done for a
million dollars," said Laster.
Israeli jets bomb Palestinian posts
JERUSALEM — Israeli pilots, flying U.S.-made F-15 and F-16 jet
fighters, attacked inside Lebanon for the first time in more than two
months yesterday, bombing what the Israeli Defense Forces said were
Palestinian guerrilla command posts in the northern Bekaa Valley.
According to later Lebanese military reports, seven people were killed
and nine wounded in the mid-morning strikes near the town of Qabb
Elias, which is in Syrian-held territory about 20 miles southeast of Beirut
near the Beirut-Damascus highway.
Voice of Lebanon radio said three buildings were destroyed by the Is
raeli attack and "Syrian army bulldozers were seen clearing debris to
remove people believed to be trapped underneath."
In Damascus, a military spokesman said Syrian anti-aircraft gunners
fired at "enemy aircraft and prevented them from completing their ag
gressive mission." According to the Syrian report, broadcast by state
run Damascus radio, "several civilians were killed and others wounded
but there were no Syrian military casualties."
600 commemorate SF slayings
SAN FRANCISCO — Enduring drizzly rain and gusty winds, about
600 people walked quietly in San Francisco last night to commemorate
the 1978 shooting deaths of Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor
Harvey Milk.
The liberal Moscone and openly-homosexual Milk were shot by Su
pervisor Dan White after discussions about White's status on the board.
"They were the leaders of an important political, progressive coalition
in San Francisco and Harvey Milk, of course, was an important symbol
for the gay and lesbian community worldwide," said Cleve Jones, an or
ganizer of the annual march.
The one-and-a-half-mile walk from Castro Street, a center of the
city's gay community, to City Hall has been conducted each year since a
spontaneous march involving roughly 50,000 people was held the night
of the shooting, Jones said.
Moscone and Milk were shot by White in their City Hall offices on
Nov. 27, 1978. White said he shot the pair because he thought they were
working together to see that he did not regain the supervisor's seat he
had resigned.
White, a former policeman in San Francisco, went to Moscone's office
and shot the mayor before continuing to Milk's office and killing him.
White was convicted of two counts of voluntary manslaughter rather
than murder, as the prosecution had sought, and was released from
prison last Jan. 6, after serving five years, and is reported to be living
somewhere in the Los Angeles area.
