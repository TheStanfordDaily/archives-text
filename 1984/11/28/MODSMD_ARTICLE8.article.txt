# Reagan reacts coolly to tax plan
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Secretary of
the Treasury Donald Regan, declar
ing "the present tax system in the
United States is unfair," formally un
veiled yesterday a long-awaited plan
for reforming the federal tax system
— a proposal that would mean
smaller tax bills for about 60 percent
of the nation's individual taxpayers
but sharply higher taxes for American
business.
But President Reagan, who or
dered the Department of the Trea
sury to prepare such a plan and
pledged repeatedly during his re
election campaign to make tax reform
a centerpiece of his second term,
reacted coolly, saying that he "will
need time to study the entire docu
ment" before deciding what kind of
tax proposal he will submit to
Congress.
The president's reaction, echoed in
comments from White House aides,
appeared to reflect the fact that the
Treasury's comprehensive reform
plan, if embraced as a major priority
in Reagan's second term, would

plunge the administration and the
Congress into a punishing political
battle against powerful interest
groups without addressing what many
see as the government's most pressing
economic problem: the skyrocketing
federal deficit.
The Treasury blueprint, on the
president's orders, is designed to be
"revenue neutral." That is, it may
mean higher or lower taxes for partic
ular individuals or businesses but it is
not intended to increase the total
amount of revenue Washington col
lects. And Reagan said that he was
satisfied that the plan is "not a tax in
crease in disguise."
That is consistent with Reagan's
emphatic campaign pledges not to
seek a tax increase as an antidote to
soaring deficits, but it also removes
what many in Congress and even the
White House see as the chief justifi
cation for mounting the kind of
crusade that would be necessary to
defeat the interest groups already
lining up to defend the existing tax
system.

Under the Treasury plan, the exist
ing graduated tax system for individ
uals. with its 14 tax brackets ranging
from 11 percent to 50 percent. * ou
be collapsed into just three r ' l,cV '
percent at the lowest income L\es.
25 percent at the broad middle
income level and 35 percent tot t k
highest income levels.
"There was a feeling within the act
ministration that il we re e\cr gomj
to reform the tax system, now is c
right time to do it. said one a m ' nis
tration official. "Most people t in
the tax system is out ot hand.
Yet many of Reagan's White
House aides, who originally sup
ported the goal of tax reform, were
stunned when they read the rea
sury's proposal. "Everybody was a
little surprised by the scope ot w lat
we're undertaking here.'' one official
said. "They said. 'My God. this is a
revolutionary document.
Nevertheless, aides said that the
president is determined to put forth
legislation providing tor a modified
flat tax. although they expect the final

White House proposal to be more
modest than the one set forth yester
day by the Treasury.
The rates would be applied on a
progressive basis, with all taxpayers
paying the lowest rate on part of their
income, a higher rate on an additional
portion and the highest rate only jf
they earned more than a specified
amount.
The plan would double the $ 1.()()()
personal exemptions and increase the
standard deduction so that a family of
four would pay no income tax on the
first $ 11,800 of income.
All tax brackets, along with the
personal exemptions and standard
deduction, would be indexed against
inflation.
A Department of the Treasur\
report said 56 percent of individual
taxpayers would receive a tax cut un
der the proposal, while 22 percent
would see no change in their income
tax payments.
