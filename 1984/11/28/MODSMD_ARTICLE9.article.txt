# CAMPUS COMPENDIUM

Homestead takes co-op
living to the extreme
If you think life in a co-op on The Farm
would be rough, don't even think about put
ting The Homestead on your Draw card.
Sure, Synergy is about four blocks from
campus, but The Homestead, a cluster of
cabins built on 200 acres of Ohio, is about a
mile from the main campus of Denison Uni
versity. Students on their way to class must
trek across fields to get to the nearest paved
road a half-mile away.
Sure, Columbae grows vegetables, but The
Homestead is an agricultural cooperative
where students milk cows, bale hay and raise
chickens. Sometimes it's necessary to milk the
goat before breakfast.
Co-op members do all the maintenance on
the Theta Chi house, but Denison students
built the three cabins that constitute their co
op.
Stanford students at Terra House bake
their own bread, but at least they have a gas
oven. The Homestead features wood-burning
stoves.
And no co-op at Stanford goes without run
ning water, electricity or indoor plumbing like
The Homestead does.
Still, four students like it enough to live
there this term, and up to 16 students have
lived there in past semesters.
"It's a humanizing experience," said Rich
Kobe, 18, of Cleveland. Kobe is a sophomore
who spent the summer at The Homestead and
intends to return for the spring semester. "A
real sense of community is built there.
Homesteaders depend on each other to keep
it going."

Professor Robert Alrutz, faculty adviser to
the project, is a professor of biology and co
ordinator of environmental studies at the
school. He's sympathetic to the reasons some
students want to give homesteading a try.
"These youngsters grow up in a way so
there's no call on them to contribute to their
own support system. Their only responsibility

is to get good grades and stay out of trouble,"
he said. "The net result is, when they get a
chance to create something with their hands,
it's an emotional experience. They're almost
hungry to do it."
Homesteading isn't a wise choice for every
one, Alrutz said. "I remember a parental fight
between daughter and a sorority-oriented
mother. That didn't work," he said.

USC outperks them all
As if beating us in football wasn't enough,
the University of Southern California has now
one-upped us in coffee houses.
Just compare the names. Stanford has "The
Coffee House." USC has "Cafe Vieni Vieni."
Dennis Reid, a representative of the Coffee
Development Group (CDG), doesn't even
put us in the same league with Cafe Vieni
Vieni, according to the Daily Trojan.
Reid's organization is funded by coffee
growing countries to promote coffee con
sumption in the United States, and he was at
Cafe Vieni Vieni to help more young people
develop a taste for coffee.
Reid evidently hopes that Cafe Vieni Vieni
will help the coffee industry stand tall in its
fight against declining coffee drinking among
college students.
"Reid said that [USC's] facility 'may be the
nicest' coffee house of the 22 the group sup
ports at campuses nationally, including
[University of California campuses at] Santa
Barbara and Berkeley, which he labeled
'prestigious,' " wrote the Daily Trojan.
Another CDG representative called Cafe
Vieni Vieni the organization's "leading
spirit," and noted that Cafe Vieni Vieni won
first prize last July in a national contest for
food-service organizations.
Those coffee achievers sure do well for
themselves.
The Axe is gone but
Mr. Polka-Dot remains
Do you really believe all those stories about
wild and interesting people in Berkeley?

If you don't, maybe you should read the
Daily Californian.
In the last month, for instance, the newspa
per serving the University of California at
Berkeley has run articles about a Dead Head
named Sky and about the Polka-Dot Man.
Sky was among the many Grateful Dead
fans who converged on Berkeley for a recent

concert by the Dead at the Berkeley Commu
nity Theater.
But Sky and his "family" ran into trouble
with the law when they came to town early
and parked their renovated, light-blue
schoolbus in the one-hour parking spots
outside the theater.
Parking there was not cool, city traffic ad
visers decided. They notified Sky and several

other Dead Heads who had parked their vans
and buses in the spots that they would get
tickets if they did not park somewhere else.
But Sky was not alarmed.
"Our karma's so good we're not worried
about tickets," he said.
As an alternative to his karma. Sky pro
posed that all the vehicles switch places each
hour so that none would violate the one-hour
time limit.
More recently, the Daily Californian re
ported that a jury had found the Polka-Dot
Man, a.k.a. William Wollbrinck, guilty of
obstructing a firetruck.
The trial was prompted when the city of
Berkeley charged the Polka-Dot Man with
stopping a fire truck as it attempted to
respond to a call last July.
The emergency vehicle was trying to cross
Sproul Plaza, an open area between
Berkeley's administration and student gov
ernment buildings, when it came upon the
Polka-Dot Man lying in the truck's path.
The Polka-Dot Man has devoted much of
his life to warming the plaza's paving stones.
"He refused to move and he just sat there
laughing at us," testified one firefighter.
Wollbrinck, however, claimed he could not
move out of the way of the truck because he
was "virtually paralyzed." After years of
prostration in Sproul Plaza, he had become a
"human statue," he said.
"I felt like a deer in the headlights— I was
frozen on the ground," he added.
Apparently the jury did not think much of
his argument.



MIT Deep Throat
Students on many college
campuses are doing something about
pornography.
The Daily Californian recently
decided not to accept ads for Playboy
magazine. Oregon State University
students are debating whether or not
to sell pornography in their
bookstore.
And students at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology may be creat
ing it.
The October issue of Penthouse
magazine ran a 1,500-word letter in
its Forum column which was
authored by a student at "a New En
gland university known for attracting

'nerdy' people who are interested in
studying computer science or engi
neering."
The letter, from a fraternity house
member, explained "in very graphic
detail" a sexual encounter that he had
with several women from the all
women house next door, an unnamed
MIT source (Deep Throat?) said.
The freshman fraternity member
allegedly went to a party at the
women's house, and began talking to
a woman there. When he began to get
tired, the woman suggested that he
spend the night there.
Well, one thing led to another, and
this student in his "sexual prime"
ended up having an orgy with three of
the house's residents, the letter said.
Soon after the letter's publication,
someone linked the letter to the Al
pha Delta Phi fraternity, and the let
ter became a campus phenomenon.
The fraternity was placed on

probation, and its members face addi
tional penalities.
Our unnamed MIT source said,
"When I went to the college
bookstore, the guy said 'page 24'
when he saw me thumbing through
Penthouse."
One campus magazine vendor
"sold more of that issue than even the
Vanessa Williams issue," according
to another MIT student.
But students took it in stride, said
The Daily's anonymous MIT source.
"Most people don't care, they
realize it's just a prank and no harm
was meant by it,"he said.
Letters to porn magazines are
"something the fraternities do all the
time," he continued. "It's like Nixon:
All the presidents spy on each other
all the time — it's just that he got
caught."

They buy grades
Money rears its head again at the
University of Southern California.
There are some things money can't
buy, hut at USC, there are some un
usual things that money can buy —
grades for instance.
The Daily Trojan reports that an
employee in the university's Registra
tion and Records Department was
fired last June after admitting that she
accepted $1,500 to alter the
computer-recorded grades of five stu
dents.
University officials suspect another
former employee of taking bribes to
change the grades on the transcripts
of about 25 other students.
About 21 students will be charged
with crimes ranging from theft to
tampering with public records, said a
lawyer for the university.

MIT Deep Throat
Students on many college
campuses are doing something about
pornography.
The Daily Californian recently
decided not to accept ads for Playboy
magazine. Oregon State University
students are debating whether or not
to sell pornography in their
bookstore.
And students at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology may be creat
ing it.
The October issue of Penthouse
magazine ran a 1,500-word letter in
its Forum column which was
authored by a student at "a New En
gland university known for attracting

'nerdy' people who are interested in
studying computer science or engi
neering."
The letter, from a fraternity house
member, explained "in very graphic
detail" a sexual encounter that he had
with several women from the all
women house next door, an unnamed
MIT source (Deep Throat?) said.
The freshman fraternity member
allegedly went to a party at the
women's house, and began talking to
a woman there. When he began to get
tired, the woman suggested that he
spend the night there.
Well, one thing led to another, and
this student in his "sexual prime"
ended up having an orgy with three of
the house's residents, the letter said.
Soon after the letter's publication,
someone linked the letter to the Al
pha Delta Phi fraternity, and the let
ter became a campus phenomenon.
The fraternity was placed on

probation, and its members face addi
tional penalities.
Our unnamed MIT source said,
"When I went to the college
bookstore, the guy said 'page 24'
when he saw me thumbing through
Penthouse."
One campus magazine vendor
"sold more of that issue than even the
Vanessa Williams issue," according
to another MIT student.
But students took it in stride, said
The Daily's anonymous MIT source.
"Most people don't care, they
realize it's just a prank and no harm
was meant by it,"he said.
Letters to porn magazines are
"something the fraternities do all the
time," he continued. "It's like Nixon:
All the presidents spy on each other
all the time — it's just that he got
caught."

They buy grades
Money rears its head again at the
University of Southern California.
There are some things money can't
buy, hut at USC, there are some un
usual things that money can buy —
grades for instance.
The Daily Trojan reports that an
employee in the university's Registra
tion and Records Department was
fired last June after admitting that she
accepted $1,500 to alter the
computer-recorded grades of five stu
dents.
University officials suspect another
former employee of taking bribes to
change the grades on the transcripts
of about 25 other students.
About 21 students will be charged
with crimes ranging from theft to
tampering with public records, said a
lawyer for the university.
Homestead takes co-op
living to the extreme
If you think life in a co-op on The Farm
would be rough, don't even think about put
ting The Homestead on your Draw card.
Sure, Synergy is about four blocks from
campus, but The Homestead, a cluster of
cabins built on 200 acres of Ohio, is about a
mile from the main campus of Denison Uni
versity. Students on their way to class must
trek across fields to get to the nearest paved
road a half-mile away.
Sure, Columbae grows vegetables, but The
Homestead is an agricultural cooperative
where students milk cows, bale hay and raise
chickens. Sometimes it's necessary to milk the
goat before breakfast.
Co-op members do all the maintenance on
the Theta Chi house, but Denison students
built the three cabins that constitute their co
op.
Stanford students at Terra House bake
their own bread, but at least they have a gas
oven. The Homestead features wood-burning
stoves.
And no co-op at Stanford goes without run
ning water, electricity or indoor plumbing like
The Homestead does.
Still, four students like it enough to live
there this term, and up to 16 students have
lived there in past semesters.
"It's a humanizing experience," said Rich
Kobe, 18, of Cleveland. Kobe is a sophomore
who spent the summer at The Homestead and
intends to return for the spring semester. "A
real sense of community is built there.
Homesteaders depend on each other to keep
it going."

Professor Robert Alrutz, faculty adviser to
the project, is a professor of biology and co
ordinator of environmental studies at the
school. He's sympathetic to the reasons some
students want to give homesteading a try.
"These youngsters grow up in a way so
there's no call on them to contribute to their
own support system. Their only responsibility

is to get good grades and stay out of trouble,"
he said. "The net result is, when they get a
chance to create something with their hands,
it's an emotional experience. They're almost
hungry to do it."
Homesteading isn't a wise choice for every
one, Alrutz said. "I remember a parental fight
between daughter and a sorority-oriented
mother. That didn't work," he said.

USC outperks them all
As if beating us in football wasn't enough,
the University of Southern California has now
one-upped us in coffee houses.
Just compare the names. Stanford has "The
Coffee House." USC has "Cafe Vieni Vieni."
Dennis Reid, a representative of the Coffee
Development Group (CDG), doesn't even
put us in the same league with Cafe Vieni
Vieni, according to the Daily Trojan.
Reid's organization is funded by coffee
growing countries to promote coffee con
sumption in the United States, and he was at
Cafe Vieni Vieni to help more young people
develop a taste for coffee.
Reid evidently hopes that Cafe Vieni Vieni
will help the coffee industry stand tall in its
fight against declining coffee drinking among
college students.
"Reid said that [USC's] facility 'may be the
nicest' coffee house of the 22 the group sup
ports at campuses nationally, including
[University of California campuses at] Santa
Barbara and Berkeley, which he labeled
'prestigious,' " wrote the Daily Trojan.
Another CDG representative called Cafe
Vieni Vieni the organization's "leading
spirit," and noted that Cafe Vieni Vieni won
first prize last July in a national contest for
food-service organizations.
Those coffee achievers sure do well for
themselves.
The Axe is gone but
Mr. Polka-Dot remains
Do you really believe all those stories about
wild and interesting people in Berkeley?

If you don't, maybe you should read the
Daily Californian.
In the last month, for instance, the newspa
per serving the University of California at
Berkeley has run articles about a Dead Head
named Sky and about the Polka-Dot Man.
Sky was among the many Grateful Dead
fans who converged on Berkeley for a recent

concert by the Dead at the Berkeley Commu
nity Theater.
But Sky and his "family" ran into trouble
with the law when they came to town early
and parked their renovated, light-blue
schoolbus in the one-hour parking spots
outside the theater.
Parking there was not cool, city traffic ad
visers decided. They notified Sky and several

other Dead Heads who had parked their vans
and buses in the spots that they would get
tickets if they did not park somewhere else.
But Sky was not alarmed.
"Our karma's so good we're not worried
about tickets," he said.
As an alternative to his karma. Sky pro
posed that all the vehicles switch places each
hour so that none would violate the one-hour
time limit.
More recently, the Daily Californian re
ported that a jury had found the Polka-Dot
Man, a.k.a. William Wollbrinck, guilty of
obstructing a firetruck.
The trial was prompted when the city of
Berkeley charged the Polka-Dot Man with
stopping a fire truck as it attempted to
respond to a call last July.
The emergency vehicle was trying to cross
Sproul Plaza, an open area between
Berkeley's administration and student gov
ernment buildings, when it came upon the
Polka-Dot Man lying in the truck's path.
The Polka-Dot Man has devoted much of
his life to warming the plaza's paving stones.
"He refused to move and he just sat there
laughing at us," testified one firefighter.
Wollbrinck, however, claimed he could not
move out of the way of the truck because he
was "virtually paralyzed." After years of
prostration in Sproul Plaza, he had become a
"human statue," he said.
"I felt like a deer in the headlights— I was
frozen on the ground," he added.
Apparently the jury did not think much of
his argument.

will help the coffee industry stand tall in its
fight against declining coffee drinking among
college students.
"Reid said that [USC's] facility 'may be the
nicest' coffee house of the 22 the group sup
ports at campuses nationally, including
[University of California campuses at] Santa
Barbara and Berkeley, which he labeled
'prestigious,' " wrote the Daily Trojan.
Another CDG representative called Cafe
Vieni Vieni the organization's "leading
spirit," and noted that Cafe Vieni Vieni won
first prize last July in a national contest for
food-service organizations.
Those coffee achievers sure do well for
themselves.
The Axe is gone but
Mr. Polka-Dot remains
Do you really believe all those stories about
wild and interesting people in Berkeley?

If you don't, maybe you should read the
Daily Californian.
In the last month, for instance, the newspa
per serving the University of California at
Berkeley has run articles about a Dead Head
named Sky and about the Polka-Dot Man.
Sky was among the many Grateful Dead
fans who converged on Berkeley for a recent

concert by the Dead at the Berkeley Commu
nity Theater.
But Sky and his "family" ran into trouble
with the law when they came to town early
and parked their renovated, light-blue
schoolbus in the one-hour parking spots
outside the theater.
Parking there was not cool, city traffic ad
visers decided. They notified Sky and several

other Dead Heads who had parked their vans
and buses in the spots that they would get
tickets if they did not park somewhere else.
But Sky was not alarmed.
"Our karma's so good we're not worried
about tickets," he said.
As an alternative to his karma. Sky pro
posed that all the vehicles switch places each
hour so that none would violate the one-hour
time limit.
More recently, the Daily Californian re
ported that a jury had found the Polka-Dot
Man, a.k.a. William Wollbrinck, guilty of
obstructing a firetruck.
The trial was prompted when the city of
Berkeley charged the Polka-Dot Man with
stopping a fire truck as it attempted to
respond to a call last July.
The emergency vehicle was trying to cross
Sproul Plaza, an open area between
Berkeley's administration and student gov
ernment buildings, when it came upon the
Polka-Dot Man lying in the truck's path.
The Polka-Dot Man has devoted much of
his life to warming the plaza's paving stones.
"He refused to move and he just sat there
laughing at us," testified one firefighter.
Wollbrinck, however, claimed he could not
move out of the way of the truck because he
was "virtually paralyzed." After years of
prostration in Sproul Plaza, he had become a
"human statue," he said.
"I felt like a deer in the headlights— I was
frozen on the ground," he added.
Apparently the jury did not think much of
his argument.



MIT Deep Throat
Students on many college
campuses are doing something about
pornography.
The Daily Californian recently
decided not to accept ads for Playboy
magazine. Oregon State University
students are debating whether or not
to sell pornography in their
bookstore.
And students at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology may be creat
ing it.
The October issue of Penthouse
magazine ran a 1,500-word letter in
its Forum column which was
authored by a student at "a New En
gland university known for attracting

'nerdy' people who are interested in
studying computer science or engi
neering."
The letter, from a fraternity house
member, explained "in very graphic
detail" a sexual encounter that he had
with several women from the all
women house next door, an unnamed
MIT source (Deep Throat?) said.
The freshman fraternity member
allegedly went to a party at the
women's house, and began talking to
a woman there. When he began to get
tired, the woman suggested that he
spend the night there.
Well, one thing led to another, and
this student in his "sexual prime"
ended up having an orgy with three of
the house's residents, the letter said.
Soon after the letter's publication,
someone linked the letter to the Al
pha Delta Phi fraternity, and the let
ter became a campus phenomenon.
The fraternity was placed on

probation, and its members face addi
tional penalities.
Our unnamed MIT source said,
"When I went to the college
bookstore, the guy said 'page 24'
when he saw me thumbing through
Penthouse."
One campus magazine vendor
"sold more of that issue than even the
Vanessa Williams issue," according
to another MIT student.
But students took it in stride, said
The Daily's anonymous MIT source.
"Most people don't care, they
realize it's just a prank and no harm
was meant by it,"he said.
Letters to porn magazines are
"something the fraternities do all the
time," he continued. "It's like Nixon:
All the presidents spy on each other
all the time — it's just that he got
caught."

They buy grades
Money rears its head again at the
University of Southern California.
There are some things money can't
buy, hut at USC, there are some un
usual things that money can buy —
grades for instance.
The Daily Trojan reports that an
employee in the university's Registra
tion and Records Department was
fired last June after admitting that she
accepted $1,500 to alter the
computer-recorded grades of five stu
dents.
University officials suspect another
former employee of taking bribes to
change the grades on the transcripts
of about 25 other students.
About 21 students will be charged
with crimes ranging from theft to
tampering with public records, said a
lawyer for the university.
