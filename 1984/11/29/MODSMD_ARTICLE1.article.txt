# Stanford wins copyrights to vocational test
## 
### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER Senior staff writer 
A U.S. district court judge has ruled that Stanford has
ownership rights to a vocational guidance test designed by
a Stanford professor and a North Carolina psychologist.
David Campbell, one of the authors of the Strong-
Campbell vocational guidance test, lost a suit earlier this
month against the University in which he claimed Stan
ford breached two provisions of a 1966 contract.
The 57-year-old Strong-Campbell test is used to match
people with certain careers and determine their profes
sional interests.
Stanford has owned the copyright to the test since 1927,
when Psychology Prof. E.K. Strong signed an agreement
with the University for publication of the test and assigned
all relevant copyrights to Stanford.
Strong died in 1963.
Campbell had charged that the University breached its
contract by signing an agreement with Consulting Psy
chologist Press (CPP). The agreement gives the Palo Alto
company exclusive marketing, scoring and sublicensing
rights to the test. In the suit, Campbell attempted to in
validate this clause.
Stanford University Press currently publishes the test,
which is formally known as the Strong-Campbell Interest
Inventory.
Campbell said the test has "enormous prestige. . . . It's
very well thought of." The test contains 325 questions
"about what people like to do," he said.
Campbell was contacted at his home in Greensboro,
N.C., where he is a member of the Center for Creative
Leadership.
The University signed a series of agreements with CPP
in 1957. That agreement made CPP the sole director of
the Strong Vocational Interest Blank and all of Stanford's
psychological tests.
CPP's exclusive contract with the University was bro
ken in 1966, when Stanford awarded other companies the
right to score the test commercially.
The history of the test between
1966 and 1984 is complex. In 1974,
Campbell wrote the University: "I
think you should proceed on the basis
that my formal responsibilities for the
Strong Vocational Interest Band are
concluded.. .. Let me make it clear
now that I think you should have
complete flexibility in whatever new
arrangements you wish to consider,"
according to the University News

Service.
Campbell now argues that the con
tract concerning the test should have
indicated that the University has the
power to sell the rights of the test
without his consent.
"1 really disagree with what was
decided upon (in court). ... It just
doesn't seem right," Campbell said.
Campbell said he has not decided
whether he will appeal the court's
ruling. He noted that he is an
"extreme admirer of Stanford Uni
versity . . . that's been a real di
lemma."
