## The 						Stanford Daily The 						Democratic sell out 
### 
Ten days after the presidential elections, Repub
lican leaders met in the Virgin Islands to chart the
party's new course. Amid clinking glasses at
opulent luaus, they confidently declared that the
New Deal coalition of labor, blacks and other
minorities "was put to rest for once and for all" in
the last election. Future politics would be a
"numbers game in votes and in money," so the
party's appeal must be to "white middle-income
Americans."
Outrageous as the preceding paragraph may
sound, only one part of it is inaccurate: the name
of the political party. The Democrats, not the
Republicans, were lushing it up in the Caribbean,
although from the rhetoric tossed around you'd
be hard put to tell the difference.
The evolution of the Democratic Party over
the last six months has been a progressive
nightmare for minorities, the poor and organized
labor. Faced with the Rev. Jesse Jackson's unam
biguous primary mandate, the Democratic es
tablishment tried to appease the Rainbow
Coalition with a few token gestures at the con
vention, like the establishment of the party's
"Fairness Commission." But the crumbs that
the left hand gaveth, the right hand tooketh away
tenfold. The Democrats in San Francisco
proceeded to enact the most conservative plat
form in the party's history. On the campaign trail,
Walter Mondale repeatedly ignored Jackson's
call for endorsement of a jobs program and other

measures to benefit the poor and minorities.
The Virgin Islands meeting is a fitting and re
vealing coda to these earlier events. As they
lobbied to succeed Charles Manatt as party chair
man, the six candidates vied with each other to
see who could put the most distance between
himself and such unfashionable constituencies as
blacks, the poor and organized labor. In the past
week, one of the leading candidates, former Utah
Gov. Scott Matheson, even suggested abolishing
the party's minority caucuses.
The "new direction" of the Democrats is
wrong in both a tactical and a moral sense. The
party cannot improve its miserable record in
presidential elections by becoming a clone of the
Reagan Republicans. If the Democrats think they
can turn their backs on their old constituencies
and still get their votes because "they have
nowhere else to go," they're making a big
mistake. Look at the black and Hispanic voter
turnout in 1984, which was up only slightly from
1980 because of disillusionment with the Demo
crat's forgotten promises. It is only when
Mondale re-embraced the liberal themes of fair
ness and equality that he began drawing large,
enthusiastic crowds.
And morally, the Virgin Islands meeting is a
cynical post-election sellout. We hope for the
best when the Democrats elect their new party
chairperson in January, but we're not holding our
breath.
