Voodoo economics
In Loren Borud's column on
Reaganomics (The Daily, Nov. 20)
he referred to the proving of spurious
economic philosophies as
"theoretical necromancy." This is a
mistake. Necromancy involves the
control of the dead, a practice not at
all useful in economics, unless one is
controlling the dead John Maynard
Keynes. As the Archaeus of the
Council of the Major Arcana, I
would like to make clear that this
theoretical manipulation lies not in
the realm of Necromancy. Rather, it
is the task of the Diviner, the
Enchanter, or even the odd Cabalist,
but not the Necromancer.

As we once again head into Dead
Week and another set of final exams
with all the stress thereby entailed, it
might be good to keep a few
thoughts in mind: Herbert Hoover
never got an A in four years at Stan
ford; John Steinbeck flunked out;
John F. Kennedy only audited
courses; John McEnroe majored in
eligibility; and David Packard never
got elected to Phi Beta Kappa. If you
are thinking about pulling a few
all-nighters, remember that there is
only so much that you can cram into
your head before it starts to come
out, or in the words of the first Stan
ford president, David Starr Jordan
(an ichthyologist by profession),
"Whenever I learn the name of a

student, I forget the name of a fish."
So . . . study hard, do your best,
but don't sweat it. After all, it's only

"Faced with the human-biology
core, are you sure you want to be a
pre-med?" he queries. A very good
way of putting it! I've received very
little academic encouragement at
Stanford. In fact, I've often been
discouraged. No matter how hard I
work or how much I learn or how
well I think I am doing in a class,
there is always someone "better"
than me, who does "better" on the
tests and gets a much higher score.
Relative to his/her high score, I am a
failure and get no credit for any
worthy effort I have made.
But I have learned to expect the
poor grades that come with the
unreal competition. After all, I
wanted to attend a competitive
school, and not everyone can come
out on top. And besides, I realize
that for someone like me there has
to be a trade-off between getting
good grades and enjoying the non
academic advantages that Stanford
has to offer (i.e., a social life).
But what I object to are professors
who like to make the competition
even more unreal, by giving an un
reasonably difficult and/or tedious

workload. Many programs here seem
to be designed to "weed out" poten
tial majors. (I've met many of these
unhappy "weeds" who are majoring
in a subject they are uninterested in.)
An introductory class I am taking
started out with an over-capacity
crowd of enthusiastic students. Now,
after the midterm, it is maybe half
filled — with lethargic, apathetic
students whose only excitement is
the close of the lecture. People
majoring in this subject tell me, "It
gets a lot better," but I know of
many people who have been and are
discouraged from the major, includ
ing yours truly. Those of us who
haven't dropped the class find that
one of the most difficult things about
it is staying awake during lectures!
Is this on purpose? Is this a fair
way to introduce a student to a
major? Is this a real way of finding
out just how dedicated a student is
— through discouragement?
Still, I try — with dampened en- !
thusiasm — I really try. But each day

SCIRE fire
In The Daily's recent article
"Report urges end to SCIRE" (The
Daily, Nov. 26), only the Arrow
committee's recommendations were
given on why SCIRE should be
eliminated. The report contains
many problems which I think

should be known. First, the com
mittee reached its conclusions
from a sample of only 8 percent of
SCIRE enrollments. Even with this
small sample, the statistics in support
of the value of academic work
through SCIRE were strong;
however, the report concentrated on
the small proportion of negative
responses. The report also bases its
broad conclusions on faculty opinion,
although it cited not faculty statis
tics; furthermore, its conclusions
were unrepresentative, since faculty
comment in support of SCIRE were
10:1 compared to negative or
"needs-improvement" responses.
Rather than suggesting possible
remedies to perceived problems, the
review committee recommended
doing away with all extradepartmen
tal accreditation except for courses.
I find this inconsistent with the
bulk of the statistical evidence and
inequitable since extradepartmental
courses are evaluated more than 50
percent of the time by non-faculty
and all SCIRE work is evaluated by
faculty. Second, the questionnaire
itself posed many problems. Al
though it asked if Stanford should
offer internships (and nearly 100
percent of the respondents indicated
"yes"), it did not ask if they should
be offered for credit. Third, the
report failed to discuss the funda
mental role of SCIRE in providing
credit for interdisciplinary projects
and internships when department
credit is unavailable. SCIRE was
established to fill this need, which 1
feel is a strong and continuing one.

If the recommendations of the
review are implemented, this credit
option will no longer exist. Ironi
cally, this removal of credit for
SCIRE comes at a time when the
University is promoting community
service. Most SCIRE internships are
in the area of community service and
many students rely on SCIRE credit
to make extensive contributions to
community agencies.

Smokescreen tactics
What Edwin Harwood is funda
mentally saying in his plea to
"Defend freedom" (The Daily, Nov.
27) is that if you disagree that Amer
ican military power should be used
v to control weaker nations,, then you
are "hostile to our way of life," an
is not really
defending freedom, but McCar
thyism and imperialism.
Why single out Nicaragua for
armed intervention in defense of
freedom? Why not liberate the
people of Guatemala, the Philippines
and the scores of other countries
where people are considerably less
free than in Nicaragua? Because the
issue is not liberty, but rather con
tinuation of U.S. dominance of other
nations. That is why, judging from
his article's tone., I daresay Harwood
wouldn't have bothered to write a
piece about repression in Nicaragua
if it were being done by anti
communist dictator Somoza. The

"defend freedom" rhetoric is merely
a smokescreen, as we learned at
great cost in Vietnam. Harwood's
warped interpretation of the peace
movement of that time conveniently
neglects the deceit and atrocities
perpetrated by the U.S. government;
that way, it fits his simplistic good
versus-evil worldview. But we won't
be fooled again.
Similarly, his talk of appeasement,
no doubt a relic of his youth during
Hitler and the Cold War, seems
rather silly today. Fortunately, most
of us recognize it as the same sort of
cheap scare tactics that Khomeini
used to keep Iranians in line resisting
the "great Satan," the United States.
Having grown accustomed to Presi
dent Reagan's fabrications about
arms flows, MiGs and student
rescues, we find it hard to take such
rubbish seriously.
Still, in general, 'Americans find it
difficult to separate criticism of the
U.S. government from criticism of
the United States itself. Thus, decry
ing U.S. militarism is seen as an
"effort to weaken American power";
criticizing Reagan is seen as an at
tack on our system of government
and way of life; and dissenting is
seen as an unpatriotic, even
treasonous act. But on the contrary,
some of us have found our patriotism
precisely through dissent: an effort

Why single out Nicaragua for

SCIRE fire
In The Daily's recent article
"Report urges end to SCIRE" (The
Daily, Nov. 26), only the Arrow
committee's recommendations were
given on why SCIRE should be
eliminated. The report contains
many problems which I think

should be known. First, the com
mittee reached its conclusions
from a sample of only 8 percent of
SCIRE enrollments. Even with this
small sample, the statistics in support
of the value of academic work
through SCIRE were strong;
however, the report concentrated on
the small proportion of negative
responses. The report also bases its
broad conclusions on faculty opinion,
although it cited not faculty statis
tics; furthermore, its conclusions
were unrepresentative, since faculty
comment in support of SCIRE were
10:1 compared to negative or
"needs-improvement" responses.
Rather than suggesting possible
remedies to perceived problems, the
review committee recommended
doing away with all extradepartmen
tal accreditation except for courses.
I find this inconsistent with the
bulk of the statistical evidence and
inequitable since extradepartmental
courses are evaluated more than 50
percent of the time by non-faculty
and all SCIRE work is evaluated by
faculty. Second, the questionnaire
itself posed many problems. Al
though it asked if Stanford should
offer internships (and nearly 100
percent of the respondents indicated
"yes"), it did not ask if they should
be offered for credit. Third, the
report failed to discuss the funda
mental role of SCIRE in providing
credit for interdisciplinary projects
and internships when department
credit is unavailable. SCIRE was
established to fill this need, which 1
feel is a strong and continuing one.

If the recommendations of the

tial majors. (I've met many of these
unhappy "weeds" who are majoring
in a subject they are uninterested in.)
An introductory class I am taking
started out with an over-capacity
crowd of enthusiastic students. Now,
after the midterm, it is maybe half
filled — with lethargic, apathetic
students whose only excitement is
the close of the lecture. People
majoring in this subject tell me, "It
gets a lot better," but I know of
many people who have been and are
discouraged from the major, includ
ing yours truly. Those of us who
haven't dropped the class find that
one of the most difficult things about
it is staying awake during lectures!
Is this on purpose? Is this a fair
way to introduce a student to a
major? Is this a real way of finding
out just how dedicated a student is
— through discouragement?
Still, I try — with dampened en- !
thusiasm — I really try. But each day
I find it a little harder to get out of
bed. And every night I spend more
and more of my library time sleep
ing.

SCIRE fire
In The Daily's recent article
"Report urges end to SCIRE" (The
Daily, Nov. 26), only the Arrow
committee's recommendations were
given on why SCIRE should be
eliminated. The report contains
many problems which I think

should be known. First, the com
mittee reached its conclusions
from a sample of only 8 percent of
SCIRE enrollments. Even with this
small sample, the statistics in support
of the value of academic work
through SCIRE were strong;
however, the report concentrated on
the small proportion of negative
responses. The report also bases its
broad conclusions on faculty opinion,
although it cited not faculty statis
tics; furthermore, its conclusions
were unrepresentative, since faculty
comment in support of SCIRE were
10:1 compared to negative or
"needs-improvement" responses.
Rather than suggesting possible
remedies to perceived problems, the
review committee recommended
doing away with all extradepartmen
tal accreditation except for courses.
I find this inconsistent with the
bulk of the statistical evidence and
inequitable since extradepartmental
courses are evaluated more than 50
percent of the time by non-faculty
and all SCIRE work is evaluated by
faculty. Second, the questionnaire
itself posed many problems. Al
though it asked if Stanford should
offer internships (and nearly 100
percent of the respondents indicated
"yes"), it did not ask if they should
be offered for credit. Third, the
report failed to discuss the funda
mental role of SCIRE in providing
credit for interdisciplinary projects
and internships when department
credit is unavailable. SCIRE was
established to fill this need, which 1
feel is a strong and continuing one.

If the recommendations of the
review are implemented, this credit
option will no longer exist. Ironi
cally, this removal of credit for
SCIRE comes at a time when the
University is promoting community
service. Most SCIRE internships are
in the area of community service and
many students rely on SCIRE credit
to make extensive contributions to
community agencies.

Smokescreen tactics
What Edwin Harwood is funda
mentally saying in his plea to
"Defend freedom" (The Daily, Nov.
27) is that if you disagree that Amer
ican military power should be used
v to control weaker nations,, then you
are "hostile to our way of life," an
is not really
defending freedom, but McCar
thyism and imperialism.
Why single out Nicaragua for
armed intervention in defense of
freedom? Why not liberate the
people of Guatemala, the Philippines
and the scores of other countries
where people are considerably less
free than in Nicaragua? Because the
issue is not liberty, but rather con
tinuation of U.S. dominance of other
nations. That is why, judging from
his article's tone., I daresay Harwood
wouldn't have bothered to write a
piece about repression in Nicaragua
if it were being done by anti
communist dictator Somoza. The

"defend freedom" rhetoric is merely
a smokescreen, as we learned at
great cost in Vietnam. Harwood's
warped interpretation of the peace
movement of that time conveniently
neglects the deceit and atrocities
perpetrated by the U.S. government;
that way, it fits his simplistic good
versus-evil worldview. But we won't
be fooled again.
Similarly, his talk of appeasement,
no doubt a relic of his youth during
Hitler and the Cold War, seems
rather silly today. Fortunately, most
of us recognize it as the same sort of
cheap scare tactics that Khomeini
used to keep Iranians in line resisting
the "great Satan," the United States.
Having grown accustomed to Presi
dent Reagan's fabrications about
arms flows, MiGs and student
rescues, we find it hard to take such
rubbish seriously.
Still, in general, 'Americans find it
difficult to separate criticism of the
U.S. government from criticism of
the United States itself. Thus, decry
ing U.S. militarism is seen as an
"effort to weaken American power";
criticizing Reagan is seen as an at
tack on our system of government
and way of life; and dissenting is
seen as an unpatriotic, even
treasonous act. But on the contrary,
some of us have found our patriotism
precisely through dissent: an effort
to preserve American values being
destroyed by the men in power.
Defending freedom begins at home.
