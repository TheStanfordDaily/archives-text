## Exploring an abstract peace 
### 
We know everything there is to know about kill
ing. We know nothing of what there is to know
about living.
- General Omar Bradley
There is something happening here and you
don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Ladd? You're
running away from it; you are afraid, aren't you?
Why? What is it? Why do you not want to talk or
even think about peace? Why is it that you don't
want to write about this, one of the most critical is
sues facing mankind today?
Maybe you fear that the truth in history is indis
putable and unchangeable. Of the roots and driving
forces behind human experiences, peace may just
not be a critical issue at all. You can see just as well
as anyone that people have their lives, their
families, their jobs, their grades to worry about.
And, to be truthful, you know that such personal
circumstance are what you worry about also.
Talking about peace, thinking about it and working
for it, do not seem very immediate; they all belong
to the netherworldly realm of ideal, of fantasy, of
the hope for the impossible that whispers to you
when faced with circumstances that just won't
change, for all your despairing. You know about
hope that stands in the face of devastation and asks
"Couldn't there be some other way?"
You're sad. It does seem to be a rather forlorn
hope, doesn't it? It does seem as though people do
not want to regard anything on "the international
scene" in any but the most warlike terms.
Perhaps you shouldn't be so morose; after all,
there is an alternative way that people in different
nations deal with each other, and that is the way of
trade. Economic reality is a better "immediate cir
cumstance" for people to be concerned about, you
believe. It is much more hopeful than the "reality"
that sees international tension as inevitable, taking
for granted that war is too.
But you hope for a more radical state of affairs
than that, don't you, Mr. Ladd? Of course, if it's a
choice between selling a country tomatoes and at
tacking it, then by all means, sell, sell, sell! But,
again, you want people to view reality from an en
tirely different perspective. You want nations to
deal with each other on a level similar to that of the
people you know; plenty of disagreement, but
never, ever, any violence. Violence is pathological,
it is psychotic behavior. Why should we view the
people around us with trust, or at the very least as

deserving of common courtesy, while approaching
other countries pathologically, with a skeptical eye
and a dagger always at the ready?
Perhaps, you admit to yourself, the difference is
in two levels of thinking: We think of people
around us in terms of immediate, personal concern;
we think of the people of other nations only in
terms of their collected mass. The leaders of those
countries, who, so far, have been our only contacts,
are for us the representatives of an abstraction'
They lead whole populations of abstractions, and
those abstractions have left us very full of that aw
ful terror of the unknown. Because running away,
for a nation, is physically impossible and because
few people believe in compromises as feasible on
an international level, all too often we paint our
selves into a corner and must behave like a trapped
animal. We must, you have heard, react with ag
gression, with all of our calculated brutality. And
for this to happen means we have failed to see
those abstractions for the human beings that they
are.
It's good that you try to understand the fear of
those who call for even more defense; it reinforces
people to know you take their fears seriously. But
you reserve the right to call the fear an abstraction,
and a very dangerous one indeed. You also suspect,
in your heart of hearts, that fearing the power of
another is very real, and you ask yourself; Is it too
much to hope that people will realize just how
much fear they cause in others, and take action to
reassure them, and gain their trust?
Much as you hate to admit it, Thomas, there is
the nagging doubt that your hope is based on an
abstraction too; perhaps you should look again at
the reality that is war, and judge it for yourself.
You can imagine being on a battlefield, and feel
your terror and disgust. "What a piece of work is
man"; the awful irony of that phrase! It mocks you
as you stand in a puddle of blood, gazing at the
body of a man you hardly even know, at the body
of a woman who perhaps could have loved you, at
the body of a child, unknown and faceless. Future
less. Their lives are over; what you see is only life
less meat.
You imagine the bloodied, blackened sin of
scores of corpses strewn about you, rudely sun
dered from life, blasted into agony and nothing
ness. The inconsequence that war makes of human
death lambasts you, torments you; you muddy your

feet in the jeering crimson filth with every step.
After the battle has ended, you are left feeling a
keen absence, the maddening calm of the storm's
end. You have seen the beast gorge itself, and slit
her back into its cave.
Here it is that hope whispers to you. But it is only
a whisper, like a puff of smoke, drifting slowly and
dissipating over the blood and filth of the bat
tlefield.
You have been made to feel that you don't
deserve to speak of war, on the premise that you
have never known it. To paraphrase Geraldine Fer
raro's best words of her campaign, "Must I have
known war to love peace?"
Yet you hear again the words used for all war,
that have come to sicken you with overuse: "Ours
is the just cause. We are right, we are defending
ourselves. This is a cause of liberation. This war is
justified."
And you are sick with helplessness. They made
the rules for you, and you find it hard to say any
thing, don't you? Often the most you can produce
is an angry and confused stutter:
That is, I know, I mean . . . oh, yes, but it's all
wrong; that is, I think I disagree. Let me take you
down 'cause I'm going to
My Lai, Verdun, Pearl Harbor, Gettysburg,
Strawberry Fields - Forever.
You should be able to see through such a black
thought, my lad. Your hope, and the hope of every
one you know, demands that you be able to. Per
haps you can find a way of showing people how
their immediate concerns, just like yours, are
indeed grounded on the basis of peace. Perhaps
everyone will see then that this must be so, if we
and our unborn children are to live a decent life.
After all, anyone can understand the difference be
tween life in Northern California and life in North
ern Ireland.
If people understand this message, that we
cannot and do not live without peace in our lives; if
they ask themselves for once what peace actually
means for them; then, perhaps, your fragile hope
will have helped us see the reality of a world with
out war. It is then that we will come to understand
that what there is to living, is living.

you reserve the right to call the fear an abstraction,
and a very dangerous one indeed. You also suspect,
in your heart of hearts, that fearing the power of
another is very real, and you ask yourself; Is it too
much to hope that people will realize just how
much fear they cause in others, and take action to
reassure them, and gain their trust?
Much as you hate to admit it, Thomas, there is
the nagging doubt that your hope is based on an
abstraction too; perhaps you should look again at
the reality that is war, and judge it for yourself.
You can imagine being on a battlefield, and feel
your terror and disgust. "What a piece of work is
man"; the awful irony of that phrase! It mocks you
as you stand in a puddle of blood, gazing at the
body of a man you hardly even know, at the body
of a woman who perhaps could have loved you, at
the body of a child, unknown and faceless. Future
less. Their lives are over; what you see is only life
less meat.
You imagine the bloodied, blackened sin of
scores of corpses strewn about you, rudely sun
dered from life, blasted into agony and nothing
ness. The inconsequence that war makes of human
death lambasts you, torments you; you muddy your

feet in the jeering crimson filth with every step.
After the battle has ended, you are left feeling a
keen absence, the maddening calm of the storm's
end. You have seen the beast gorge itself, and slit
her back into its cave.
Here it is that hope whispers to you. But it is only
a whisper, like a puff of smoke, drifting slowly and
dissipating over the blood and filth of the bat
tlefield.
You have been made to feel that you don't
deserve to speak of war, on the premise that you
have never known it. To paraphrase Geraldine Fer
raro's best words of her campaign, "Must I have
known war to love peace?"
Yet you hear again the words used for all war,
that have come to sicken you with overuse: "Ours
is the just cause. We are right, we are defending
ourselves. This is a cause of liberation. This war is
justified."
And you are sick with helplessness. They made
the rules for you, and you find it hard to say any
thing, don't you? Often the most you can produce
is an angry and confused stutter:
That is, I know, I mean . . . oh, yes, but it's all
wrong; that is, I think I disagree. Let me take you
down 'cause I'm going to
My Lai, Verdun, Pearl Harbor, Gettysburg,
Strawberry Fields - Forever.
You should be able to see through such a black
thought, my lad. Your hope, and the hope of every
one you know, demands that you be able to. Per
haps you can find a way of showing people how
their immediate concerns, just like yours, are
indeed grounded on the basis of peace. Perhaps
everyone will see then that this must be so, if we
and our unborn children are to live a decent life.
After all, anyone can understand the difference be
tween life in Northern California and life in North
ern Ireland.
If people understand this message, that we
cannot and do not live without peace in our lives; if
they ask themselves for once what peace actually
means for them; then, perhaps, your fragile hope
will have helped us see the reality of a world with
out war. It is then that we will come to understand
that what there is to living, is living.

There is something happening here and you
don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Ladd? You're
running away from it; you are afraid, aren't you?
Why? What is it? Why do you not want to talk or
even think about peace? Why is it that you don't
want to write about this, one of the most critical is
sues facing mankind today?
Maybe you fear that the truth in history is indis
putable and unchangeable. Of the roots and driving
forces behind human experiences, peace may just
not be a critical issue at all. You can see just as well
as anyone that people have their lives, their
families, their jobs, their grades to worry about.
And, to be truthful, you know that such personal
circumstance are what you worry about also.
Talking about peace, thinking about it and working
for it, do not seem very immediate; they all belong
to the netherworldly realm of ideal, of fantasy, of
the hope for the impossible that whispers to you
when faced with circumstances that just won't
change, for all your despairing. You know about
hope that stands in the face of devastation and asks
"Couldn't there be some other way?"
You're sad. It does seem to be a rather forlorn
hope, doesn't it? It does seem as though people do
not want to regard anything on "the international
scene" in any but the most warlike terms.
Perhaps you shouldn't be so morose; after all,
there is an alternative way that people in different
nations deal with each other, and that is the way of
trade. Economic reality is a better "immediate cir
cumstance" for people to be concerned about, you
believe. It is much more hopeful than the "reality"
that sees international tension as inevitable, taking
for granted that war is too.
But you hope for a more radical state of affairs
than that, don't you, Mr. Ladd? Of course, if it's a
choice between selling a country tomatoes and at
tacking it, then by all means, sell, sell, sell! But,
again, you want people to view reality from an en
tirely different perspective. You want nations to
deal with each other on a level similar to that of the
people you know; plenty of disagreement, but
never, ever, any violence. Violence is pathological,
it is psychotic behavior. Why should we view the
people around us with trust, or at the very least as

deserving of common courtesy, while approaching
other countries pathologically, with a skeptical eye
and a dagger always at the ready?
Perhaps, you admit to yourself, the difference is
in two levels of thinking: We think of people
around us in terms of immediate, personal concern;
we think of the people of other nations only in
terms of their collected mass. The leaders of those
countries, who, so far, have been our only contacts,
are for us the representatives of an abstraction'
They lead whole populations of abstractions, and
those abstractions have left us very full of that aw
ful terror of the unknown. Because running away,
for a nation, is physically impossible and because
few people believe in compromises as feasible on
an international level, all too often we paint our
selves into a corner and must behave like a trapped
animal. We must, you have heard, react with ag
gression, with all of our calculated brutality. And
for this to happen means we have failed to see
those abstractions for the human beings that they
are.
It's good that you try to understand the fear of
those who call for even more defense; it reinforces
people to know you take their fears seriously. But
you reserve the right to call the fear an abstraction,
