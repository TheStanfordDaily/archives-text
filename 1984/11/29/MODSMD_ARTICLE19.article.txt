## COP: COPing with campus problems 
### LESLIE KAUFMAN 
Todd Kerr, David Porter, Alice
Wells and Melissa Auchard.
Familiar names? Yes. They are the
1984-85 Council of Presidents —
they call themselves the Gang of
Four. And although their names may
be known by students here, few of
those students know what the Council
of Presidents actually does.
The COP members divide their re
sponsibilities, with each president re
sponsible for one of four areas.
Kerr is the chairman of the board
of the Coffee House. He says his en
thusiasm for his work comes from his
belief in the importance of running
the Coffee House well.
"The Coffee House is the only all
student-run place on campus to get
food; even the co-op is run by food
service," said Kerr. "When the Cof
fee House is running well it gains
credibility for the students."
Running well means more than just
the food, drinks and cultural pro
grams that students expect from the
Coffee House. It means running effi
ciently and making money so that the
Coffee House can fulfill its contrac
tual obligations to the students.
This year it is especially important
that the Coffee House prove its effi
ciency because its contract expires in
January. Kerr realizes that there will
be several bids by food-service com
panies to gain control of the Coffee
House. He wants to ensure that the
students keep control of the Coffee
House, as well as renegotiate the
contract.
But putting aside contract worries,
Kerr is finding his jobs at the ASSU
and the Coffee House both fun and
personally rewarding. "The interac
tion with the people has been the spe
cial part of each job. Working with
co-council members has given me a
lot of insight into people relations
that will be valuable in whatever I do.
"We complement each other well,"
said Kerr of his co-council members.
"We don't always agree, but we can
always compromise and make things
work one way or another."
According to Kerr, there are draw
backs in every relationship, like
having to watch Porter " 'pig-out' on
junk food," he joked.
When Kerr makes such a comment
of his co-president, Porter just tries to
ignore him. But when he comes to his
job, he is very serious.
Porter's biggest concern is funding
groups on campus. His goal is to

make funding easier to acquire. He has
been treasurer for many campus
groups, and he said that nobody un
derstands the hassles of getting fund
ing for a group better than he does.
"Sure, accountability is impor
tant," he said, "but I know what it is
like to have to be responsible for
every last paper clip. I'm working on
a way to cut some of the red tape. I'd
like to make things easier. Most stu
dents don't realize we have their best
interests in mind. After all, we are
students, too."
For example, Porter said that most
students are wary of voting to give the
ASSU any extra money. But, he says,
many don't understand that the
ASSU doesn't use the money on it
self. The money is used to build and
refurbish necessary buildings for the

student body, such as the Boat
House.
Student funding also concerns
Wells.
According to Wells, the ASSU
should be open, accessible and

Wells said. "I know sometimes
people get angry when we fund
groups, especially if the students have
voted agaist funding them in a recent
election. But not every group that
needs funding can gain a majority to
back it.

'We don't always agree, but we can
always compromise . . .'

friendly to as many groups as possi
ble.
"We are trying to provide funding
for as many groups as possible,"

"We can only give limited backing
without a popular vote anyway. And
this way there is more diversity and
interest on campus," Wells said.

She also stresses involvement.
"I think any group of people with
an interesting program should he en
couraged. I want people to get in
volved with their own groups as well
as others and the ASSU can help this
happen," she said.
Besides working with funding.
Wells is trying to work toward the de
velopment of the Women's Center at
Stanford. "The center has never
really had the chance to flourish and
be strong because Stanford is so
decentralized," she said. "There is no
one place where a woman can go to
deal with all of her varied needs."
Wells has worked on developing a
women's advisory council. This coun
cil would bring together representa
tives from the various women's
groups around campus, as well as fac

ulty and administration. The aim of
the group would be to coordinate and
discuss women's programs on
campus.
Wells said she hopes the council will
provide a stable and continuous inter
est in women's problems, something
that she says has been lacking on
campus.
Wells has also been working on a
student commission that would create
ideas and programs to celebrate Stan
ford's Centenniel. This student
group, operating separately from the
official University commission, will
work on programs that reflect student
perspectives on the event. According
to Wells, the group aims to raise stu
dent awareness of and interest in the
Centenniel through publications and
programs.


Council of Presidents members Alice Wells, Todd Kerr, Melissa Auchard and David
Porter are working to make their jobs less mysterious. Their jobs may be misunderstood,

but the presidents clearly understand the importance of their roles. The "Gang of Four"
plans to make the ASSU more accessible to students here.
