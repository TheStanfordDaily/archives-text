Wells describes her job as busy.
But it is fun, really. At first 1 was a
little dubious of the four-president
system, but now I see we all have our
own responsibilities. We balance each
other well," she said.
As the chair of the COP, Auchard
spends much of her time tying to
gether all the loose ends. The ASSU
suggests that if students want to talk
to one of the presidents, it should be
the chair. Therefore, Auchard deals
with requests and demands from the
students. She also represents the stu
dent point of view at numerous fac
ulty and administrative meetings.
She takes pride in the fact that this
council has a very good relationship
with the faculty. Hut she said that
sometimes she can't help feeling a
little bit like a diplomat.
I recognize the students' immedi
ate needs." said Auchard. "But I can
understand the administrative posi
tion on a lot of topics because they
can see long range."

According to Auchard, it is a prob
lem that each student council starts
anew every year unaware of the prog
ress made by the previous council. In
an effort to increase continuity of
programs and knowledge, Auchard
has expanded the ASSU intern pro
gram. In addition to allowing for a
smooth transfer of ideas from one
year to the next, the intern program
increases students' interest and aware
ness in their own government.
"I know it sounds cliche," said
Auchard, "but we really want to
make the ASSU more accessible. I
think the ASSU offers worthwhile ex
perience. People don't understand
what we are doing here, and there is a
general feeling around campus that
the ASSU is a place to be avoided."
Auchard strives to change the
image of the ASSU. "The members of
this year's council have been trying to
set goals and complete them and to
make the ASSU a valid institution,"
she said.


Last spring the group campaigned on KZSU. This year they hope to
broadcast the message that the ASSU is not be a place to be avoided.
