### BRADLEY RUBIDGE Chez Panisse Pasta, Pizza Calzone" By Alice Waters Random House, $ .95, 196 pp 
"The Dungeon Master"
By William Dear
Houghton Mifflin, $ .95, 284 pp.
In 1979, Dallas Egbert, a 16-year
old computer whiz at Michigan State
University, disappeared amid bizarre
circumstances that eventually
aroused international attention. The
curiosity about the case was not
allayed when private investigator
William Dear completed his search
for the boy, for he gave no details
about the case to the press. The
speculation about conspiracies among
drug dealers, the local gay community
and student groups involved in dan
gerous games of Dungeons and
Dragons in the heating tunnels
beneath the university campus con
tinued in the absence of any hard in
formation about the case.
In "The Dungeon Master," Dear
gives a surprisingly readable account
of his search for Egbert and reveals
for the first time what actually hap
pened to the boy. Despite Dear's
somewhat juvenile enthusiasm for his
own private investigator's gadgetry
and the flamboyant self-image he
carefully cultivates, the book presents
his concern for Egbert convincingly,
and manages to touch the reader's
sentiments as well. There's not much
action in the story, but Dear's efforts

to penetrate the suspicious and fright
ened groups on and around campus
provide adequate suspense and ten
sion, as does the promise — continu
ally held out — that Egbert may have
indeed met a horrifying fate as part of
some arcane conspiracy.
Unfortunately, the conclusion
doesn't quite live up to the suspense
developed. The book offers the
excitement of fiction, and delivers the
banality of real life. Yet that real life
says enough about real people to
make the book worth reading.
"Letters to a Young Poet"
By Rainer Maria Rilke
Translated by Stephen Mitchell
Random House, $0.95, 109 pp.
This beautiful little presentation

edition of Rilke's famous letters
preserves its very fin-de-siecle text in
a reliquary of the same style. Stephen
Mitchell's translation reproduces the
flavor of the original German and
does not obscure the fact that the let
ters of advice were not only ad
dressed to a young man with adoles
cent concerns, but were written by a
poet who was not so very old himself
and whose answers to these concerns
reveal that he has acquired a wiser
tone, if perhaps not wiser views.
I am personally unsympathetic to
Rilke's mystical attitude toward the
"vocation" of poetry. But Rilke is to
be admired for the sympathy and sen
sitivity with which he wrote about
adolescent preoccupations. And I
