### BRADLEY RUBIDGE Chez Panisse Pasta, Pizza Calzone" By Alice Waters Random House, $ .95, 196 pp 
"The Dungeon Master"
By William Dear
Houghton Mifflin, $ .95, 284 pp.
In 1979, Dallas Egbert, a 16-year
old computer whiz at Michigan State
University, disappeared amid bizarre
circumstances that eventually
aroused international attention. The
curiosity about the case was not
allayed when private investigator
William Dear completed his search
for the boy, for he gave no details
about the case to the press. The
speculation about conspiracies among
drug dealers, the local gay community
and student groups involved in dan
gerous games of Dungeons and
Dragons in the heating tunnels
beneath the university campus con
tinued in the absence of any hard in
formation about the case.
In "The Dungeon Master," Dear
gives a surprisingly readable account
of his search for Egbert and reveals
for the first time what actually hap
pened to the boy. Despite Dear's
somewhat juvenile enthusiasm for his
own private investigator's gadgetry
and the flamboyant self-image he
carefully cultivates, the book presents
his concern for Egbert convincingly,
and manages to touch the reader's
sentiments as well. There's not much
action in the story, but Dear's efforts

to penetrate the suspicious and fright
ened groups on and around campus
provide adequate suspense and ten
sion, as does the promise — continu
ally held out — that Egbert may have
indeed met a horrifying fate as part of
some arcane conspiracy.
Unfortunately, the conclusion
doesn't quite live up to the suspense
developed. The book offers the
excitement of fiction, and delivers the
banality of real life. Yet that real life
says enough about real people to
make the book worth reading.
"Letters to a Young Poet"
By Rainer Maria Rilke
Translated by Stephen Mitchell
Random House, $0.95, 109 pp.
This beautiful little presentation

edition of Rilke's famous letters
preserves its very fin-de-siecle text in
a reliquary of the same style. Stephen
Mitchell's translation reproduces the
flavor of the original German and
does not obscure the fact that the let
ters of advice were not only ad
dressed to a young man with adoles
cent concerns, but were written by a
poet who was not so very old himself
and whose answers to these concerns
reveal that he has acquired a wiser
tone, if perhaps not wiser views.
I am personally unsympathetic to
Rilke's mystical attitude toward the
"vocation" of poetry. But Rilke is to
be admired for the sympathy and sen
sitivity with which he wrote about
adolescent preoccupations. And I



William Dear
must admit that the devotion and as
cetic fervor with which he regards the
task of writing literature are a neces
sary working attitude for some au
thors that I would be sorry not to have
read. These are, after all, letters, and
letters from a very idiosyncratic au
thor, at that. They have been popular
with many readers, and ought to be
sampled to see if they might strike a
sympathetic and productive chord.

This handsome cookbook will
enable you to reproduce some of the
outstanding recipes from Chez
Panisse in Berkeley and from the

pizza parlor operated upstairs from it.
Alice Waters has organized her
recipes into seasonal categories, ac
cording to the fresh ingredients re
quired for them. Though it is claimed
that the ingredients can come from a

backyard garden, most of the recipes
demand some specialized shopping
that could prove expensive. Though
the end products are delicious, this
book seems directed at an audience
that is accustomed to shopping at
Niven's. It would be a better invest
ment as a gift for someone who'll
invite you to dinner than as an addi
tion to your own kitchen shelf.
"Classical Literary Criticism"
Edited by Alex Preminger, et al.
Ungar, $10.95 paper, 281 pp.
The ancient critical texts included
in this anthology — Aristotle, Plato,
Longinus, Horace, Quintilian — are
indispensable for anyone who wants
to understand the principles underly
ing literary texts written through the
Neoclassical period. Some larger
collections of criticism include most
of the texts given here, which are also
available separately in well
annotated editions. Preminger and
his colleagues have, however,
responded to the need for an inex
pensive edition of these major
writings that includes authoritative,
informative introductions and very
helpful bibliographies. When the
companion volume, "Medieval
Literary Criticism," appears, the pair
will form a reference source that
every student of literature — modern
or ancient — should have in his li
brary.

"Stanford Desk Calendar"
The Phillips Group, $9.95
Cardinal-blooded alumni and stu
dents have the appointment book of
their dreams. Most days in this calen
dar are marked with a notable event
from Stanford history and sections
between months recount both the
trivial and intriguing highlights of
University lore. The Stanford Desk
Calendar should not only keep you
organized in 1985, but will also pro
vide endless stories to tell the uni
nitiated who dare to wonder why you
love the Farm.
