### JOHN WALLIN TELFORD WORK 
KZSU will air the most promising tracks from these albums tonight at 6
The rating scale is one to five stars.

Rickie Lee Jones —
The Magazine ★ ★ ★V2
This album represents the
best Rickie Lee Jones has to of
fer in several ways: It is her
best produced, her backing
band is tight and ultraprofes
sional and her outlook on life
has brightened considerably.
When Jones first entered the
business in the late 19705, the
sudden thrust into fame was
too much for her and her recent
recovery is noticeable in the
music — the formerly dark.

despairing lyrics have turned
more positive, indicating that
Jones has resolved her personal
crisis. Her tough, street-wise
image has lost its cynicism
without exchanging it for
naivete. Musically, her sound
has evolved as well: Each
track's sound is unique and the
post-blues. Steely Dan-ish style
comes from so many places that
it's impossible to nail down her
real influences. "The Maga
zine" shows that Jones has
learned to apply her newfound

maturity not only to herself,
but to her music as well.

Danny Elfman —So-Lo
★ ★ ★V2
How different could a solo
album by the lead (only)
singer/writer of Oingo Boingo
and even performed by the
members of the band (plus an
additional synthesist) be,
anyway? Not much, at first lis
ten — but though Elfman's dis
tinctive vocals and arrange
ments and the band's im
mutable instrumentation still
brand every track, the tone of
the entire album is definitely
more relaxed, and it is actually
possible to stay seated during a
song. This will be quite a treat

to hardcore Boingo fans, who
finally will be able to rest with
out playing anything from an-

other group. They will hear
more melodic, less intense
songs, with the same sarcastic,
thought-provoking lyrics that
have made Oingo Boingo one
of the only new wave hands to
actually respect the intelligence
of its teenage audience.
Elfman's "solo" music is more
conventional, less obsessed,
and might even get some
nationwide interest (it anyone
outside California knows who
he is by now, of course). Ask an
Oi-Boy or Oi-Girl to play some
for you, or call a radio station:
if they're cool, they'll know
who he is and play you sotr-2.

Frank Zappa — Them Or Us
All we have to do is say
there's a new double Zappa al
bum out and all the already

fans will go right out and buy it.
Then again, the other 99 per
cent of you either haven't
heard of him or have already
heard too much. So we've
decided to include two reviews:
one for the have's, one for the
rest of you.
-The Have's ★ ★ ★ V; 2
Excellent sound. Digital. Hot
drumming. The usual lyrics.
Lotsa novelties that'll make
you laugh. A few guitar solos (a
couple by Dweezil) that you'll
either love or hate as much as

ever. Some soul, some operatic,
some backwards-masking, even
cool cover art
- The Rest of You ★ ★
First of all, you better sit
down. This is pretty potent
stuff. The lyrics are funny and
sarcastic, but kind ol vulgar.
The style, is all over the place.
Really long, painful guitar
solos, messages nobody under
stands. .. . Find a friend and
listen to it repeatedly until it
starts sounding good. Then
vou'll love it. It's a way of life!
