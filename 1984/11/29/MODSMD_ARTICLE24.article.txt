# 'Payback' tantalizing but frustrating

### MARK KING "Payback" By joe Klein Knopf, 351 pp., $17. 95 
In January 1981, during the
jubilant, flag-waving mood that fol
lowed the hostages' return from Iran,
a Vietnam veteran named Gary
Cooper died in a shootout with police
in Indiana. Cooper apparently was
reliving a Vietnam experience when
he began firing from inside his home.
The trigger for his action seems to
have been the reception given the
hostages, a patriotic welcome of a
kind that had been denied Cooper
and his fellow veterans.
In the course of investigating
Cooper's life and death for a maga
zine article, Joe Klein, a New York
journalist, met several other Vietnam
veterans who had known Cooper.
Klein soon realized he had the ma
terial for a book. "Payback" is the
result of that research — research in
volving close personal contact with
the veterans and their families.
"Payback" follows the lives of five
Marines, including Cooper, all of
whom enlisted for service in the early
years of the war. All of Klein's sub
jects were involved in Operation
Cochise, which proved ( to be a devas
tating slaughter. It was the last day
the five would spend together in Viet
nam. Klein begins his book here, re
creating the horror of the ambush in
which all five men were caught,
tracing their thoughts and movements
in the action.The return to the States

Despite the unsatisfied
feeling this 'open-ended'
quality leaves, Klein is ad
mirably successful in
probing human relationships
and in bringing his charac
ters to life.

and the years that follow unwind al
most novelistically.
Klein has come up with a series of
graphic portraits of lives changed
forever by the war, in some cases ir
revocably damaged. All five of
Klein's subjects came from working
class families. Several were from bro
ken homes. Family life typically
centered around mill work, with
heavy drinking in off-time. Most of
the five either sought some kind of
escape from this existence or were

hoping to prove their worth to their
families, particularly to cold, distant
fathers. All felt a lack of understand
ing, compassion, and communication
with their families. Moral questions
about the war, political motivations
for the U.S. involvement, awareness
of Vietnam's history and where
America's policies might lead simply
did not exist for these men — or for
many others — in the early 19605.
The men who returned, as Klein
vividly documents, were emotionally

strained misfits, living strung-out
lives characterized by alcohol and
drug abuse, by endless strings of jobs
and firings, marriages, girlfriends,
divorces, bar fights, car crashes, wife
beatings. . . .
