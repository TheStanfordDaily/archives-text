# 'Payback' tantalizing but frustrating
## 
### MARK KING "Payback" By joe Klein Knopf, 351 pp., $17. 95 
In January 1981, during the
jubilant, flag-waving mood that fol
lowed the hostages' return from Iran,
a Vietnam veteran named Gary
Cooper died in a shootout with police
in Indiana. Cooper apparently was
reliving a Vietnam experience when
he began firing from inside his home.
The trigger for his action seems to
have been the reception given the
hostages, a patriotic welcome of a
kind that had been denied Cooper
and his fellow veterans.
In the course of investigating
Cooper's life and death for a maga
zine article, Joe Klein, a New York
journalist, met several other Vietnam
veterans who had known Cooper.
Klein soon realized he had the ma
terial for a book. "Payback" is the
result of that research — research in
volving close personal contact with
the veterans and their families.
"Payback" follows the lives of five
Marines, including Cooper, all of
whom enlisted for service in the early
years of the war. All of Klein's sub
jects were involved in Operation
Cochise, which proved ( to be a devas
tating slaughter. It was the last day
the five would spend together in Viet
nam. Klein begins his book here, re
creating the horror of the ambush in
which all five men were caught,
tracing their thoughts and movements
in the action.The return to the States

Despite the unsatisfied
feeling this 'open-ended'
quality leaves, Klein is ad
mirably successful in
probing human relationships
and in bringing his charac
ters to life.

and the years that follow unwind al
most novelistically.
Klein has come up with a series of
graphic portraits of lives changed
forever by the war, in some cases ir
revocably damaged. All five of
Klein's subjects came from working
class families. Several were from bro
ken homes. Family life typically
centered around mill work, with
heavy drinking in off-time. Most of
the five either sought some kind of
escape from this existence or were

hoping to prove their worth to their
families, particularly to cold, distant
fathers. All felt a lack of understand
ing, compassion, and communication
with their families. Moral questions
about the war, political motivations
for the U.S. involvement, awareness
of Vietnam's history and where
America's policies might lead simply
did not exist for these men — or for
many others — in the early 19605.
The men who returned, as Klein
vividly documents, were emotionally

strained misfits, living strung-out
lives characterized by alcohol and
drug abuse, by endless strings of jobs
and firings, marriages, girlfriends,
divorces, bar fights, car crashes, wife
beatings. . . .

and alcohol, unable to hold a steady
job. Gary Cooper, who dies in the
shoot-out with police, was fighting
heroin addiction and was out of work
at the time of his death. Total apathy
toward themselves and everyone
around them is also a striking, com
mon characteristic. The men simply
don't seem to care what happens in
their lives. Immaturity and self-pity,
carelessness and callousness are a
way of life.
Lack of communication, though,
could be the theme of the book.
Every relationship we see — whether
with parents, wives, girlfriends, coun
selors, friends — is marked by a com
plete lack of communication. A
decade and a half later, some contacts
finally began to open. EST training
appears to help one Marine; Vet
Center group therapy helps another;
and hypnosis still another. A reunion
of some of the participants of
"Operation Cochise" in 1982 serves
as both a time of tension and a time to
sort out feelings that hadn't yet been
confronted.
While Klein details the men's prob
lems, he offers little explanation for
them. It is this lack of following
through on his observations and
analyses that makes "Payback" both
tantalizing and frustrating reading.
The reader frequently waits for an ex
ploration behind events and behav
ior, but none is forthcoming. One
suspects various factors lying behind
the anti-social behavior that charac
terizes several of the men. Besides
the war experience itself, the recep
tion home was singularly unreward
ing, and the extensive use of drugs

certainly could have played some
part, as might have the rigorous and
unrelenting military training the
Marines received. Yet Klein inex
plicably fails to explore any of these
influences. As a rather neat wrap-up
final conclusion, "post-traumatic
stress disorder" is mentioned, but
Klein does little but tack this
"explanation" on in the book's final
pages. The reader is left to draw his
own conclusions.
The trouble is that Klein plots his
book as if it is leading up to some sort
of summation or conclusion, but it
isn't. He states that his intention is
"simply to write about five men who
fought together in Vietnam, and what
had happened to them when they
came home." This protestation is a
bit difficult to accept, though; the
feeling that a thesis lurks somewhere
among the pages is persistent. Impor
tant issues are raised but not ex
plored.
Despite the unsatisfied feeling this
"open-ended" quality leaves, Klein is
admirably successful in probing
human relationships and in bringing
his characters to life. "Payback" is a
highly readable account, written in a
Rolling Stone style which should ap
peal to a wide audience. Klein is obvi
ously an acute observer, objective but
sympathetic. And while "Payback"
doesn't tell us a great deal that is new,
little that we haven't read in
newspapers over the years, Klein
succeeds in going beyond headlines
and showing the actual men. This is
the real value of the book: We come
to know these veterans and their ex
periences and, if not to understand
them completely, to acknowledge
what they have gone through and are
living through still. "Payback" is a

and the years that follow unwind al
most novelistically.
Klein has come up with a series of
graphic portraits of lives changed
forever by the war, in some cases ir
revocably damaged. All five of
Klein's subjects came from working
class families. Several were from bro
ken homes. Family life typically
centered around mill work, with
heavy drinking in off-time. Most of
the five either sought some kind of
escape from this existence or were

hoping to prove their worth to their
families, particularly to cold, distant
fathers. All felt a lack of understand
ing, compassion, and communication
with their families. Moral questions
about the war, political motivations
for the U.S. involvement, awareness
of Vietnam's history and where
America's policies might lead simply
did not exist for these men — or for
many others — in the early 19605.
The men who returned, as Klein
vividly documents, were emotionally

strained misfits, living strung-out
lives characterized by alcohol and
drug abuse, by endless strings of jobs
and firings, marriages, girlfriends,
divorces, bar fights, car crashes, wife
beatings. . . .

and alcohol, unable to hold a steady
job. Gary Cooper, who dies in the
shoot-out with police, was fighting
heroin addiction and was out of work
at the time of his death. Total apathy
toward themselves and everyone
around them is also a striking, com
mon characteristic. The men simply
don't seem to care what happens in
their lives. Immaturity and self-pity,
carelessness and callousness are a
way of life.
Lack of communication, though,
could be the theme of the book.
Every relationship we see — whether
with parents, wives, girlfriends, coun
selors, friends — is marked by a com
plete lack of communication. A
decade and a half later, some contacts
finally began to open. EST training
appears to help one Marine; Vet
Center group therapy helps another;
and hypnosis still another. A reunion
of some of the participants of
"Operation Cochise" in 1982 serves
as both a time of tension and a time to
sort out feelings that hadn't yet been
confronted.
While Klein details the men's prob
lems, he offers little explanation for
them. It is this lack of following
through on his observations and
analyses that makes "Payback" both
tantalizing and frustrating reading.
The reader frequently waits for an ex
ploration behind events and behav
ior, but none is forthcoming. One
suspects various factors lying behind
the anti-social behavior that charac
terizes several of the men. Besides
the war experience itself, the recep
tion home was singularly unreward
ing, and the extensive use of drugs

certainly could have played some
part, as might have the rigorous and
unrelenting military training the
Marines received. Yet Klein inex
plicably fails to explore any of these
influences. As a rather neat wrap-up
final conclusion, "post-traumatic
stress disorder" is mentioned, but
Klein does little but tack this
"explanation" on in the book's final
pages. The reader is left to draw his
own conclusions.
The trouble is that Klein plots his
book as if it is leading up to some sort
of summation or conclusion, but it
isn't. He states that his intention is
"simply to write about five men who
fought together in Vietnam, and what
had happened to them when they
came home." This protestation is a
bit difficult to accept, though; the
feeling that a thesis lurks somewhere
among the pages is persistent. Impor
tant issues are raised but not ex
plored.
Despite the unsatisfied feeling this
"open-ended" quality leaves, Klein is
admirably successful in probing
human relationships and in bringing
his characters to life. "Payback" is a
highly readable account, written in a
Rolling Stone style which should ap
peal to a wide audience. Klein is obvi
ously an acute observer, objective but
sympathetic. And while "Payback"
doesn't tell us a great deal that is new,
little that we haven't read in
newspapers over the years, Klein
succeeds in going beyond headlines
and showing the actual men. This is
the real value of the book: We come
to know these veterans and their ex
periences and, if not to understand
them completely, to acknowledge
what they have gone through and are
living through still. "Payback" is a
gripping, moving account of five
human lives.
In January 1981, during the
jubilant, flag-waving mood that fol
lowed the hostages' return from Iran,
a Vietnam veteran named Gary
Cooper died in a shootout with police
in Indiana. Cooper apparently was
reliving a Vietnam experience when
he began firing from inside his home.
The trigger for his action seems to
have been the reception given the
hostages, a patriotic welcome of a
kind that had been denied Cooper
and his fellow veterans.
In the course of investigating
Cooper's life and death for a maga
zine article, Joe Klein, a New York
journalist, met several other Vietnam
veterans who had known Cooper.
Klein soon realized he had the ma
terial for a book. "Payback" is the
result of that research — research in
volving close personal contact with
the veterans and their families.
