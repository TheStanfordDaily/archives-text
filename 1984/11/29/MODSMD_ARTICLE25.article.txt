## Offense is gone, defense is top priority 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sports writer 
The Stanford basketball team
finished the 1983-84 season with a
19-12 record. It finished tied for fifth
in the competitive Pacific 10 Confer
ence. And it finished probably only a
victory away from its first post-season
tournament berth since 1942.
But when Coach Tom Davis
walked into 7,500-seat Maples
Pavilion for the first day of basketball
practice last month, he noticed a few
things were missing from that team.
Like John Revelli. And Keith Jones.
And Hans Wichary. And Steve
Brown.
Together, the four accounted for
more than 70 percent of the Car
dinal's offense last season. With them.
Stanford led the Pac-10 in scoring,
averaging 74.5 points per game.
And Stanford is without them — as
in all of them — this season. Two of
them — Revelli and Jones — ran out
of eligibility last season, another —
Wichary — decided not to use his
final year of eligibility and the fourth
— Brown — suffered a stress fracture
in his leg that will force him to use his
final year of eligibility next season.
Davis legitimately could be con
cerned about this year's team, and he
is. But he doesn't spend his time
crying over spilled starters and lost
milk.
Davis, a master of substitution, said
"I think one of the advantages of
playing more than five guys is that
you can go into a season and have lost
all five starters and still have guys that
have played and know the system."
Those guys who "have played and
know the system" are playing more
this season, and if Saturday's 87-48
season-opening victory over the Uni
versity of California at San Diego is
any indication, they have picked up
the slack well.
Although more than 70 percent of
the offense is gone, offense isn't
Davis' first and foremost concern.
Defense is.
After the 39-point destruction of
the UCSD Tritons, Davis told
reporters, "If we are going to be a
decent team this year, we're going to
have to play good defense." The of
fense, as junior forward Andy Fischer
said, will take care of itself.
"We lost two very, very fine offen
sive dimensions," Davis said of

Revelli and Jones, the No. 2 and No.
4 all-time scorers in Stanford history,
"so it might take a little longer to get
that shot. But I think we will score,
contrary to what a lot of people might
think. 1 just think we will be a more
balanced scoring team."
Even if Davis didn't have confi
dence in his offensive system, he still
wouldn't resort to slow-down tactics
against physically-superior and more
talented opponents. In fact, the
thought didn't even cross his mind.
"I hate doing that," he said. "I just
think the game should be played up
and down the court. We're going to
fast break and press every opponent
on our schedule, both home and
away."
Davis is also not an advocate of the
"tough pre-conference schedules
build tough teams" belief. Davis likes
to get ready for the Pac-10 with
gimmes, patsies, freebees or whatever
else you want to call them. Last year

they were called Hawaii-Pacific,
Bemidji State, Eastern Montana and
Western Michigan, to name a few.
But the 1984-85 preseason
schedule is the toughest of Davis'
three seasons at Stanford. Road
games at St. Mary's University and in
the Longhorn Invitational at the Uni
versity of Texas won't be cakewalks.
nor will this Saturday's contest
against either Brigham Young Uni
versity or LaSalle University in the
weekend's Apple Invitational Tourn
ament. Both BYU and LaSalle went
to post-season tournaments last year.
As has been Davis' policy at Stan
ford, he's not promising what he can't
deliver. And this season, a winning
season may be a tall order, especially
with a harder-than-usual pre
conference schedule and a harder
than-ever Pac-10 slate.
Should Stanford suffer a losing
season, it would be Davis' first in his
14 years as a collegiate head coach.

"It doesn't really bother me," said
Davis, who has a career coaching
record of 250-117. "Nobody wants to
have a losing season. But if you're in
this profession long enough, it's going
to catch up with you sometime."
Davis, however, isn't new to the
situation he faces this season. In his
second year at Lafayette, he lost five
of the top six players from a 21-6
team that went to and won a National
Invitational Tournament game, the
only post-season basketball tourna
ment victory in Lafayette history.
What happened? The team
finished 16-10 and won its confer
ence championship.
Below is a position-by-position
run-down of this year's team.
Guards
This is probably the most talented
and undoubtedly the deepest part of
the team. Junior Keith Ramee, one of
two returning starters, is back to run
the offense from his point guard or, as

Davis calls it, No. 1, position. John
Paye has traded in his football cleats
for a pair of sneakers, and as soon as
he recovers from an assortment of in
juries, he'll see plenty of action and
might even break into the starting
lineup.
Paye will also play the off guard or
No. 2 spot, a position he will share
with as many as three others. Sopho
more Novian Whitsitt is the top can
didate to start and pop off an oc
casional 20-point game. Whitsitt,
though only 6-foot-1 and 160
pounds, has a better-than-average
outside jumper and is quick enough
to score on the fast break.
Besides Whitsitt, 6-2 junior John
Williams and 6-2 freshman Scott
Meinert could also see time. Meinert,
from Salem, Ore., made a big impres
sion on Davis in the team's first
preseason scrimmage when he scored
26 points. But a week later, Meinert
severlv sprained his ankle and won't

he ready to contribute until later this
season, according to Davis.
"I think he'll be a good offensive
player," Davis said of Meinert, "but
whether or not he'll be able to
develop the defensive skill to match is
questionable."
Forwards
Davis' problem here isn't experi
ence — he's got juniors Andy Fischer
and Earl Koberlein. It's size. Fischer
is 6-4 and Koberlein is 6-6, and that's
with their shoes on. After Brown got
news of his season-ending stress
fracture, Koberlein — the only re
turning starter besides Ramee —
became the team's leading returning
scorer and rebounder. He averaged
6.1 points and 4.4 rebounds per game
last season.
Davis does have some size in 6-1 1
freshman Greg Butler — the bigger
but younger brother of Cal's Dave
Butler, a 6-9 junior. Butler's biggest
adjustment will be learning to play
away from the basket, not with his
back to it like he did in high school.
He'll also have to learn how to stay
out of foul trouble. He played less
than 10 minutes against UCSD and
had two fouls. That works out to an
average of eight a game.
Charles Hunt, one of two scholar
ship seniors on the team, had a
career-high seven points against
UCSD and may see a career-high
amount of playing time this season.
So may sophomore Doug Wall.
Centers
There are only two that, barring in
jury, will play. One is a senior and the
other a freshman. The senior — 6-7,
200-pound Kent Seymour — was a
pleasant surprise Saturday with 1 1
points, six rebounds, four blocked
shots and three slam dunks. Reveno,
the 6-8, 245-pound freshman who
went to high school with Paye, also
played, and had five points, three
rebounds, one block and no slams.
"I think that Seys (Seymour) is
about as different from John
(Revelli) as you can get as far as his
game goes," Davis said. "But he's a
perfect complement for Eric
(Reveno). Kent's got the experience
that Eric needs and Eric's got the
bulk that Kent will never have."
Though Seymour and Reveno may
do fine in the preseason, things could
change quickly when the likes of 7-0
Blair Rasmussen or 7-0 Christian
Welp visit Maples Pavilion during the
Pac-10 season.


Freshman big men Greg Butler (left) and Eric Reveno will have to help
make up for some of Stanford lost offensive punch if the Cardinal ex-


Rod Searcey/Daily
pects to be competitive in the Pac-10. Stanford led the conference in
scoring last season but lost more than 70 percent of its offense.
