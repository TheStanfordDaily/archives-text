How I wish 1 was Doug Flutie
With so much money
At my feet
If his name hadn't already been
plastered across sports pages of
America enough to prove the no
tion, on Friday Boston College
quarterback Doug Flutie laid all
doubts to rest about who is the
best college football player in the
country. Or at least the most excit
ing.
Flutie's heroic performance
against the University of Miami
(Fla.) not only sealed up a Heis
man Trophy for the mighty-mite,
but also earned him the respect of
the Dallas Cowboys' head scout,
Gil Brandt.
Brandt called Flutie a legitimate
first-round draft choice. That cer
tainly makes the 5-foot-9 Flutie a
very happy man because it means
he'll get some attention and prob
ably a lot of money. Prior to
Brandt's declaration, the argu
ments over whether Flutie could
play pro football (many people
think he's too short) were very
much up in the air.
So in this, the yuletide season,
Flutie should give thanks to
Brandt for making him a rich man.
But in keeping with the holiday
spirit, I've made my own list of
presents for some of those who are
less fortunate than Flutie.
To Stanford running back Brad
Muster, I wish him a pickup truck.
With the extensive losses on the
Cardinal offensive line, he may

need one if he expects to gain any
yardage next year.
To Stanford football Coach Jack
Elway, a 10-year supply of lighter
fluid. Then again, he might go
through that in a year if John Paye
gets hurt again.
To Stanford quarterback John
Paye, a hospital.
To Stanford linebacker Dave
Wyman, a full recovery.
To the University of California
at Berkeley football Coach Joe
Kapp, the ability to answer a ques
tion with a substantial statement.
To sportswriter Beano Cook
(who picked Arizona State Uni
versity to win the national champi
onship in football), a new job.
To the San Francisco Chronicle
sports department, something
besides the San Francisco 49ers to
write about.
To NBC Sports (which missed
Jack Nicklaus' $240,000 putt in
the Skins Game in order to show a
football pregame show), a new
program director.
To the Stanford Athletic De
partment, lower prices on football
tickets. The seats in Stanford
Stadium aren't filling up.
To Stanford freshman basket
ball players Greg Butler, Eric
Reveno and Steve Meinert, a lot
of scoring.
To Stanford basketball players
Earl Koberlein, Andy Fischer,
Novian Whitsitt, Keith Ramee and
the rest of the team, a lot of
scoring.
To Stanford basketball Coach
Tom Davis, a new conference for
the Cardinal to play in this year.
