## Sturm gets WCAA award; Oden Player of the Year 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford women's volleyball team received several
post-season honors yesterday as three of its players were
selected to the All-Conference teams and Head Coach
Fred Sturm was named the WCAA Co-Coach of the year.
In addition to being named to the All-Conference
team, middleblocker Kim Oden was selected as the West
ern Collegiate Athletic Association's Player of the Year
for the second straight year.
Oden led Stanford to its first WCAA championship and
the nation's No. 1-ranking with a league-leading .398 hit
ting percentage and high kill and blocking averages. The
6-foot-2 junior from Irvine is a two-time Ail-American.
"It was a definite surprise but a welcomed one," Oden
said. "I still have such a long way to go. I'm still really
making the effort to improve" for next year.
Sturm called Oden the "clear-cut" choice for the
award. "There was no question. She was the 'straw that
stirred the drink.' She was the [Most Valuable Player) last
year, and had a fantastic season this year. It's well
deserved."
The WCAA coaches voted Sturm Coach of the Year
along with San Diego State University's Rudy Suwara. "It
was pretty much unexpected," Sturm said. "I voted for
Rudy Suwara because [San Diego State] was the biggest
surprise this year. They beat USC, UCLA, and us."
In his seventh year as head coach for Stanford, Sturm
"finally got what he really deserves," setter Deidra
Dvorak said. After finishing second in the conference the
last two seasons, he guided Stanford to the 12-2 confer
ence record and a 17-4 overall mark.
Sturm attributed the award to Cardinal Asst. Coach
Don Shaw. "It's a representation of Don's hard work and
effort. What is so fortunate about coaching at Stanford is
that I'm surrounded by outstandingly qualified people â€”
neat people."
Seniors Bobbie Broer and Dvorak were named to the
second-team All-WCAA. Broer is a middleblocker and is
second to Oden with a .255 hitting percentage and 90
blocks (to Oden's 109).

Broer was also named the WCAA
Athlete of the Week last week for her
play against Arizona State University
and the University of Arizona. She
had 14 kills in each match and hit
.476 against Arizona.
Dvorak leads the team with 593
setting assists. She has been a starting
setter for Stanford the last three
seasons and was an honorable
mention All-WCAA pick last year.
The National Collegiate Athletic
Association playoffs begin today, but
Stanford does not have a first-round
match. The Cardinal is seeded No. 1
in the West Regional and, with a first
round bye, will open post-season play
Dec. 6-9 against the winner of the
University of Arizona-Colorado
State University match.
