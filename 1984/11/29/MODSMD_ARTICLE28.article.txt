Stanford water polo Coach Dante Dettamanti was
named Pacific 10 Conference Coach of the Year yester
day after leading the Cardinal to a second-place finish in
the National Collegiate Athletic Association Champion
ship.
Stanford lost to the University of California at
Berkeley, 9-8, in the NCAA final on Sunday in Long
Beach. Dettamanti, now in his eighth year of coaching at
Stanford, led the team to a 5-1 record in the Pac-10 and a
25-5 record overall.
In Dettamanti's eight years at Stanford he has led the
team to a 191-34-6 overall record, three NCAA Cham
pionships (1978, 1980, 1981) and six Pac-10 Champion
ships.
This marks Dettamanti's fifth year as Pac-10 Coach of
the Year, but he professed that the honor means more to
him this year than it has in the past.
"1 am pretty excited about the honor because I feel it
reflects how far we have come this year," Dettamanti said.
"We came back from a 0-6 Pac-10 record (last season) to
become this year's Pac-10 champions. I think that says a
lot about the caliber of our team."
Although Dettamanti feels the team's success this year is
largely due to the perseverance and talent of the players,
many of them feel his role as the coach was the major fac
tor in the team's improvement.
"All of our success this year is because of Dettamanti,"
goalie Steve Moyer said. "He took our team from last
year's losing season to a second-place finish in the
NCAAs this year. He was the driving force behind all of
us."
Sophomore David Imbernino was equally appreciative
of Dettamanti's coaching abilities. "Dettamanti is really a
hard-working coach," Imbernino said. "The great thing
about him is he can be a friend outside the pool while also
being your coach."
Imbernino, Stanford's leading scorer this year with 63
goals, was named to the NCAA All-Tournament First
Team over the weekend, along with sophomore Craig
Klass. According to Dettamanti, both players deserved
the honor.
