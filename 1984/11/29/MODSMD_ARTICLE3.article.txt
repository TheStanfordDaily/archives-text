# Ten years later, still no clues
## Grisly '74 campus murder mystifies police 
### TODD RAMMING Staff writer 
On Oct. 13, 1974, at 5:45 a.m., a guard
from the Stanford Police Department found
a dead body in the rear of the east transept
of Memorial Church. The victim, Arlis
Perry, 19, newlywed wife of then-Stanford
sophomore Bruce Perry, had been molested
and stabbed in the back of the head.
Now, more than 10 years after the still
unsolved incident, the case remains one ot
the most bizarre and grisly murders in Stan
ford history. In an effort to crack the case,
police have established theories that link
the murder both to New York s 'Son of
Sam" killer and to a satanic cult in North
Dakota.
According to Dean of the C hapel Robert
G.H. Kelly, who was quoted in The Daily
the day after the murder, "The woman was
lying face up on the floor, and was nude
from the waist down. One three-foot long
candle had been forced up her vagina, while
another was pushed up her blouse and be
tween her breasts."
This description led observers to the con
clusion that the murder was rooted in

Satanic ritualism. Autopsy reports, however,
showed that Perry died quickly; coroners
detected none of the usual signs of sadism
usually associated with a "black-mass" mur
der.
Based on the autopsy reports, police char
acterized the murderer as a "sexual psy
chopath." Physical evidence — candles, per
haps the murder weapon and other articles
bearing fingerprints — was sent to the FBI
for tests. Santa Clara County Sheriff s C a P l -
Frank Mosunic, chief of detectives, called
this evidence "the key to the case."
FBI lab tests detected about 125 fin
gerprints on the objects submitted as
evidence. Also, investigators produced a
composite picture of the suspect based on
testimony from other people in Memorial
Church on the night of the murder.
None of the fingerprints matched up,
however, and the suspect in the composite
picture was found and cleared.
By December 1974, although the case
was not officially closed, the investigation
was no longer producing any new results.
"We can hope that the FBI will find some
thing," Mosunic said on Dec. 4, 1974. "We

have nothing else to go on."
Little new evidence surfaced until 1979,
when Felix Gilroy, a New York legal-aid at
torney, linked David Berkowitz, the famed
"Son of Sam" killer, with the Stanford case.
Detectives Ken Kahn and Tom Beck, both
of San Jose, pursued the Berkowitz connec
tion further.
Meanwhile, a book of witchcraft surfaced
with a message — allegedly written by
Berkowitz — that read: "Arliss (sic) Perry,
hunted, stalked and slain. Followed to Cali
fornia. Stanford Univ."
According to testimony, Berkowitz had
joined a satanic cult in Minot, N. D., a town
of about 32,000 located 110 miles north of
the Perry couple's hometown of Bismarck.
Berkowitz. claimed that, at a cult meeting, a
man claimed responsibility for the death of
Arlis Perry.
There is no evidence linking Berkowitz to
the actual murder, but many detectives
believe he does indeed know the indentity of
the murderer.

years of investigations, police detectives are still trying to
solve the bizarre case.

Officials wheel out the body of Arlis Perry after she was
found dead in Memorial Church in October, 1974. After 10
In a phone conversation yesterday, Beck told
The Daily that he and Kahn are convinced that
Berkowitz does know the killer's identity. But he
no longer is cooperating with the police, Beck said,
because other inmates have threatened and at
tacked him for his role as informer.
Also, according to Beck, Berkowitz stopped
talking because he was being hounded by the press
and authorities for further information. "He felt
like he was just being used," Beck said.
In 1981, Kahn and Beck concluded their rela
tions with Berkowitz, left him a business card and
told him to call whenever he felt ready to talk. They
have not heard from him since.
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer of the Stanford Police
Department views Berkowitz' testimony with great
skepticism.
"I frankly don't believe it. Berkowitz liked to

play games," he said in a recent phone interview.
Capt. Mosunic of the Santa Clara Sheriff s De
partment, on the other hand, concedes that
Berkowitz "probably has some knowledge."
Despite their opposing views on the Berkowitz
testimony, neither Niemeyer nor Mosunic has
abandoned the Perry murder case. The FBI has
produced a final set of fingerprints and, according
to Mosunic, investigators need only find the owner
of these prints.
But these fingerprints, which have been on
record ever since the murder, still have not led to
the suspect.
Asked whether he feels closer to a solution now
than in 1974, however, Niemeyer responded, "We
are probably further away. We try to solve a case
within the first 48 hours." After the time immedi
ately following the crime has passed, investigation
becomes much more difficult and the situation wor
sens as time goes on, he said.
Niemeyer said that unless a suspect matching
these fingerprints happens to turn up, it may be
impossible to solve the case because police "have
no real evidence, no witnesses, no motive."
In a telephone interview yesterday, Bruce

Perry's parents flatly denied that Arlis Perry, or
any other family member, had any contact with
members of a satanic cult.
"We know nothing about the case except what
we have read in the papers," said Bruce Perry's
mother.
Following the murder in 1974, Bruce Perry left
Stanford to return to his parents in Bismarck, N.D.
At that time, "his life had collapsed around him,"
his mother said.
But over the past ten years, "he has started his
life over," she said. Bruce is "a strong individual
and a devout Christian," she said.
Perry remarried in 1981 and has since obtained
his doctorate and M.D. from Northwestern Univer
sity in Chicago, his mother said.
Asked about the quality of the police investiga
tion, Bruce Perry's father said the detectives have
been "very thorough, very professional." They are
doing "an excellent job, although the resolution
has not been achieved," he said.
Now, as the 11th year of investigation dawns, life
goes on for Bruce Perry and his parents; meanwhile
detectives continue to search for a solution to what
may be the strangest case in campus history.
