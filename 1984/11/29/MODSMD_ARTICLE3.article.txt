# Ten years later, still no clues
## Grisly '74 campus murder mystifies police 
### TODD RAMMING Staff writer 
On Oct. 13, 1974, at 5:45 a.m., a guard
from the Stanford Police Department found
a dead body in the rear of the east transept
of Memorial Church. The victim, Arlis
Perry, 19, newlywed wife of then-Stanford
sophomore Bruce Perry, had been molested
and stabbed in the back of the head.
Now, more than 10 years after the still
unsolved incident, the case remains one ot
the most bizarre and grisly murders in Stan
ford history. In an effort to crack the case,
police have established theories that link
the murder both to New York s 'Son of
Sam" killer and to a satanic cult in North
Dakota.
According to Dean of the C hapel Robert
G.H. Kelly, who was quoted in The Daily
the day after the murder, "The woman was
lying face up on the floor, and was nude
from the waist down. One three-foot long
candle had been forced up her vagina, while
another was pushed up her blouse and be
tween her breasts."
This description led observers to the con
clusion that the murder was rooted in

Satanic ritualism. Autopsy reports, however,
showed that Perry died quickly; coroners
detected none of the usual signs of sadism
usually associated with a "black-mass" mur
der.
Based on the autopsy reports, police char
acterized the murderer as a "sexual psy
chopath." Physical evidence — candles, per
haps the murder weapon and other articles
bearing fingerprints — was sent to the FBI
for tests. Santa Clara County Sheriff s C a P l -
Frank Mosunic, chief of detectives, called
this evidence "the key to the case."
FBI lab tests detected about 125 fin
gerprints on the objects submitted as
evidence. Also, investigators produced a
composite picture of the suspect based on
testimony from other people in Memorial
Church on the night of the murder.
None of the fingerprints matched up,
however, and the suspect in the composite
picture was found and cleared.
By December 1974, although the case
was not officially closed, the investigation
was no longer producing any new results.
"We can hope that the FBI will find some
thing," Mosunic said on Dec. 4, 1974. "We

have nothing else to go on."
Little new evidence surfaced until 1979,
when Felix Gilroy, a New York legal-aid at
torney, linked David Berkowitz, the famed
"Son of Sam" killer, with the Stanford case.
Detectives Ken Kahn and Tom Beck, both
of San Jose, pursued the Berkowitz connec
tion further.
Meanwhile, a book of witchcraft surfaced
with a message — allegedly written by
Berkowitz — that read: "Arliss (sic) Perry,
hunted, stalked and slain. Followed to Cali
fornia. Stanford Univ."
According to testimony, Berkowitz had
joined a satanic cult in Minot, N. D., a town
of about 32,000 located 110 miles north of
the Perry couple's hometown of Bismarck.
Berkowitz. claimed that, at a cult meeting, a
man claimed responsibility for the death of
Arlis Perry.
There is no evidence linking Berkowitz to
the actual murder, but many detectives
believe he does indeed know the indentity of
the murderer.
