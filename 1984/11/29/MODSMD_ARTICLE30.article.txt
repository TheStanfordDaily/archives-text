# Stanford wrestlers begin season in Davis
## 
### PETER CASTILLO 
Stanford wrestling Coach Chris Horpel is
hoping to avoid a repeat of last year, when the
Cardinal was decimated hy injuries.
But as Horpel leads his team into its first dual
meet of the season tonight against Oregon
Technology and the University of California at
Davis in Davis, his luck seems to be lacking.
Kurt Kassulke (190 pounds) injured his jaw in a
bicycle accident yesterday.
But if Kassulke can heal quickly, Horpel, who
again has the help of Olympic gold-medal win
ners Dave and Mark Shultz, may have his best
team since the wrestling program's reinstate
ment five years ago. The Cardinal team features
a mixture of seasoned returnees and talented
freshman.
The team is led by junior co-captains Jeff
Bradley (134 pounds) and Scott Wiggen (150
pounds), who both qualified for the National
Collegiate Athletic Association Championships

last year.
Bradley is known for his aggressive and pow
erful style and is currently ranked in the top 10
in the nation. Horpel believes that Bradley's
strong points are his lower-body technique and
his ability to lift his opponents off the mat and
throw them for scores.
Wiggen moves up a weight class this year and
is untested so far. His style is unorthodox, but
he uses this to his advantage with his mental
toughness and upper body stregnth, according
to Horpel.
In the first tournament of the year, at Cal
Poly San Luis Obispo on Nov. 1 7, Bradley took
fourth place and Wiggen took fifth.
The star of the team has been freshman Dave
Lee, who in the Cal Poly tournament captured
first place and the Outstanding Wrestler honors.
Horpel calls Lee a sound fundamental wrestler
who can score from all positions.
The Cardinal's weak point may be in the

heavyweight class, where Ed Katz was forced to
retire due to lower-back problems that never
healed properly. Freshman Frank Lyles, who
took sixth in the tournament, is questionable at
the heavyweight spot due to an ankle injury.
Fellow freshman Terry Mclntyre will fill in for
Kassulke.
Horpel said the team has six potential NCAA
qualifiers at the moment and, barring injuries,
should finish third in the Pacific 10 Conference.
The strongest teams in the Pac-10 are perennial
powerhouses Arizona State and Oregon State.
Washington State and Oregon will be fighting
with Stanford for third place.
But the Cardinal has the good fortune to have
two of best wrestlers in the world on its coach
ing staff, the Schultz brothers.
"Mark and Dave are at every practice and
competition and are not assistant coaches in
name only," Horpel said. "They are a part of
the decision-making process in determining

workouts and other matters."
The Schultz brothers have also been useful in
recruiting, as Horpel highlights them in mailers
to recruits. "The Shultzs bring attention to our
program and are a symbol of the commitment
Stanford has to develop a nationally competi
tive program."
Wrestling at Stanford is carried on in relative
obscurity compared with the huge crowds wres
tling meets draw in the Midwest. Last year's
NCAA championship attracted nearly 16,000
fans for the finals.
"I have not actively pushed for fan support
until we had a successful program. 1 will make a
push for the last four meets if the teams is as
good as I believe it is," Horpel said.
In tonight's meet, Horpel thinks that Davis
will be stronger in the upper weights, while
Stanford will be better in the lower weights.
Davis leads the series 3-1. Horpel is not familiar
with the Oregon Tech team.
