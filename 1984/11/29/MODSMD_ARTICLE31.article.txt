## SCIRE, SWOPSI fates still in air 
### MARC PEYSER Staff writer 
The Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (C-US) yesterday made its
final recommendations on a report
that would effectively disband and
regroup five extradepartmental pro
grams.
The report, which was first pre
sented by the University Review
Committee on Extradepartmenal
Education in late August, recom
mends the reorganization of the re
sponsibilities of the Student Center
for Innovation in Research and Edu
cation (SCIRE), Stanford Workshops
on Political and Social Issues
(SWOPSI), Undergraduate Reserach
Opportunities (URO), Action Re
search Liaison Office (ARLO) and
the Undergraduate Special Program
(UGS) into one educational center.
In order to increase the legitimacy
of some of the programs as well as cut
down on some of the confusion
caused by overlapping functions of
the departments, the committee pro
posed a restructuring into two areas:
research and internships.
"We think we're headed in the
right direction," Economics Prof.
Kenneth Arrow, the committee
chariman, said before yesterday's C
US meeting.
Yet while the results of the meeting
will not be made public until next
week, there is already concern among
the heads of some of the programs as
to how a restructuring will ultimately
affect the quality of the current offer
ings.
"We don't want SWOPSI to lose
any of the uniqueness that makes

SWOPSI SWOPSI," said Andre Bur
nett, professional co-director of
SWOPSI. "They missed a great deal
of what a SWOPSI-type course is
about.
"We are not a department, not a
traditional program," Burnett said.
"Our whole system of teaching is dif
ferent."
While the observations of SCIRE
were somewhat different from those
of SWOPSI, staff members there also
remain concerned about the commit
tee's findings.
The area which was in the biggest
need of reworking, according to the
report, was the credit for internship
aspect of the program. "The award
ing of credit is sometimes an after
though; a student completes some
project or activity independently and
then asks SCIRE to award credit."
the report said.
Yet according to SCIRE Co-
Director Judy Adams, "The aca
demic requirements of SCIRE are in
most cases more strict than those of
departments, which usually just re
quire completion of the field place
ment and a journal." She explained
that in order to receive credit a stu
dent must submit not only a journal
but also a 10-15 page paper of re
search quality.
"Credit is never given for just a
journal or reading list, as the [report]
suggests," Adams said.
It is expected that History Prof.
Carolyn Lougee, dean of Humanities
and Sciences, will make a decision
based on the C-US recommendations
and the Arrow report around the
beginning of the year.
