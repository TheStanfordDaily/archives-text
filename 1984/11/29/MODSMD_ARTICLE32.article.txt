# Parisian activist describes gay scene
## 
### FRANK LESTER Staff writer 
Although homosexuality has been legal in
France since the lKth century, gay activism in the
country is only 30 years old, according to a
Parisian gay activist.
Jacques Vandemborghe explained the growth
of the movement to a small audience in the His
tory Corner last night. Vandemborghe talked
about the status of the gay movement in France,
illustrating a few of the differences between
French and U.S. gay activism.
Vandemborghe, secretary-general of the
Fondation Memoire des Homosexualites, an ar
chive for gay writings, said he is satisfied with the
way things are going for the gay movement in
France, but added that he is concerned about the
complacency that has started to set in since
French President Francois Mitterand and the
Socialist Party came to power in 1981.
In the past three years, homosexuals have
gained more legal freedom in a country where
two-century-old laws permitting consensual acts
between adults have not eliminated traditional
prejudices against homosexuality, Vandem
borghe said.
As evidence of this, Vandemborghe cited the

growth of gay media. Since the Socialists came to
power, there has been a relaxation of moralistic
licensing standards, creating the opportunity for
a 24-hour gay radio station. Frequence Gaie F"M,
as well as a gay cable-television network. There
are currently 10 gay newspapers and magazines
in France, and there is increased coverage of gay
events in the straight press, Vandemborghe said.
But yet more needs to be done, he emphasized.

There were riots in 1968 that solidified the gay
community, but since then, activism has been
replaced by "inefficiency."
Vandemborghe suggested that the lack of a
single issue to rally around has engendered a
"disaffectation" for activism among French
homosexuals. He noted that AIDS (Acquired
Immune Deficiency Syndrome), despite its hor
ror, has also served a positive good in the United
States: The disease has helped unite U.S.
homosexuals around a particular issue.
In France, "We are not aware of AIDS," he
said, at least to the extent that gays are unwilling
to take an active role in the issue.
Vandemborghe gave examples of issues that
the gay community should address and work
actively to change. Indignation should kindle ac
tivism, he said, citing the case of a Catholic bis
hop who said "homosexuals are sick." He and a
fellow activist took the bishop to court and sued
him for defamation. The court threw the case out
on the grounds that the bishop's comments were
not directed against a single individual or group
of individuals. The court also commented that
gays are not a "legally protected body." Van
demborghe is currently seeking redress in the
European Court of Justice.
