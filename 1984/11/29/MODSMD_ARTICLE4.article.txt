# Motorola raps ASSU charges
## 
### CLINT HIGHFILL Senior staff writer 
A spokesman for Motorola Corp.
yesterday denied the company has
acted irresponsibly in its sales and
employment practices in South
Africa, and a representative from the
Stanford Alumni Association said the
organization would not ask its mem
bers to participate in a boycott of
Motorola.
The Motorola spokesman's com
ments came in response to an ASSU
Senate resolution passed Tuesday
night calling on Stanford students and
alumni to boycott Motorola products.
The senate resolution, which claims
that Motorola tacitly supports apar
theid, also asks University placement
centers to notify students interested
in interviewing with Motorola that
the University's Committee on In
vestment Responsibility (CIR) has
determined Motorola's sales of
electronic equipment to the South
African military and police to be
"socially injurious."
The resolution also cites a recent
study by a consulting firm that
criticizes Motorola for failing to
"adequately" comply with the Sul
livan principles.
The Motorola spokesman, who
asked not to be named in accordance
with company policy, admitted that
the company had made sales to the
military and police as recently as
1983 but denied that the sales sup
ported South Africa's enforcement of
apartheid laws.
The non-tactical communications
equipment that the company sold did

"not meet any police or military
specifications" and did not "reinforce
apartheid any more than the sale ot
autos or food," he said.
But Graduate Senator Mark Lan
desmann, a co-sponsor of the resolu
tion, said the equipment "is used in
denying blacks their political rights
and in controlling them."
The Motorola spokesman said his
company's sales policies "conform
with the requirements of the State
Department and U.S. government."
With the 1982 lifting of U.S. export
restrictions, it is now legal for the
company to sell to the South African
military and police, he added.
The Motorola spokesman also
denied the charge that Motorola's
compliance with the Sullivan Prin
ciples was less than adequate.
He blamed two factors for the com
pany's low compliance rating in a
recent survey. He said the ratings did
not focus on efforts inside the
workplace, where he said Motorola
has performed well and failed to rec
ognize that Motorola's relatively
small size in South Africa necessitati s
small programs.
Because Motorola's operations are
smaller, "We take a different path
and try to achieve the same goal, he
said. He mentioned the compam's
adopt-a-school program as an exam
ple of how the company aids blacks <i
South Africa.
Regardless of Motorola's actions or
inactions, the ASSU's resolution call
ing for a boycott of the company's
products by students and alumni
probably will have little practical ef
fect.
As ASSU Graduate Senator Don
Gardner put it, "What Motorola
makes, students can't boycott."
Prof. Robert White, the chairman
of the Electrical Engineering Depart
ment, said Motorola's products, be
cause they are usually components of
larger electrical equipment, are often
hard to identify.
Gardner, a doctoral student in
electrical engineering, said Motorola
is "one of America's biggest semi
conductor producers," and its com
ponents are essential parts of Apple's
Macintosh and the computers at
LOTS.
The resolution also stipulates "that
the senate urge . . . the members of

the Alumni Association" to support
the boycott.
However, Bill Stone, director of
the Alumni Association, said the as
sociation was "not structured to be a
political agency" and would not sug
gest to Stanford alumni that they rec
ognize the boycott.
Landesmann said last night that the
senate may merely try to inform
alumni of the presence of the boycott.
Both the Career Planning and
Placement Center (CPPC) and the
Graduate School of Business' place
ment center indicated that they would
be willing to provide information to
potential applicants for employment
with Motorola of ClR's views on the
company's "socially injurious" ac
tions.
However, Ayse Kenmore, director
of Career Planning and Placement for
the business school, said that
Motorola hasn't recruited there for
about two years.
