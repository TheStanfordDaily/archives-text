The upcoming arms negotiations between the
United States and the Soviet Union will do little
toward improving relations between the two
countries, a foreign-affairs scholar told an audi
ence ij re last night.
In a presentation discussing the impact of
President Reagan's re-election on other
countries, Ronald Hilton, editor of the World
Affairs Report, told an audience gathered in
CERAS auditorium that an "exchange of good
will means very little" and that "high-level talks
have been going on year after year and getting
nowhere."
The lecture, sponsored by the California In
stitute of International Studies, also presented
analyses of United States relations with the
United Kingdom, the Philippines, Australia
and New Zealand.
Hilton said there has been a recent "sense of
euphoria" in the United States because of
reports by The Washington Post and NBC of
Soviet President Konstantin Chernenko's wil
lingness to negotiate.
However, Hilton said the public in this
country is unaware of anti-American
propaganda being published simultaneously.
"What we're faced with on one hand is the
Soviets saying something pleasant to us," he
said. "And on the other hand, they say some
thing bad about us behind our back in Russian."
Lord Morrice St. Brides, a British diplomat
and visiting scholar at the Center for Interna
tional Security and Arms Control, disagreed
with Hilton on the value of the upcoming weap
ons talks, labeling them "valuable and useful."
Brides discussed the British Labor Party's
promise to abolish the British nuclear deterrent
if the party wins the country's next election.
Brides said the chance of the Labor Party's win
ning the election would be "much less" if
Reagan was perceived to be striving for agree
ment with the Soviets.
"By and large, we see the need for mutual
deterrence," he said. "All of us fervently hope
for an agreement which would balance capabili
ties at a lower level, restrain the development of
more lethal weapons and provide a degree of
crisis management."
Brides said the history of arms control has
shown the United States taking the lead with
the Soviet Union then following. He also
termed Reagan's attempt to restore U.S. confi
dence and strength an "extraordinary achieve
ment."
"The United States should now take the in
tellectual lead in arms negotiations," Brides
said. "It is the American responsibility to lead
once again."

-Patzty [ !.w4i\}Lj#,,- u PhilippincjouTnulisi
fellow in Stanford's Department of Communi
cation, said U.S. involvement in the Philippines
is viewed by most Philippine citizens as Ameri
can imperialism.
Siccam termed a statement by Reagan, in
which he described opposition forces in the
Philippines as communist, as "misinformed."
To understand U.S. relations with the
Philippines, Siccam said an examination of the
Philippines' strategic location and its available
market and raw materials is necessary.
"It is sentimental, economic and practical in
terests which make the Philippines so important
to the United States," she said.
Noting that many Philippine citizens believe
that, if elected, Walter Mondale would ha\e
furthered human rights in their country. Siccam
said Reagan's re-election is perceived differ
ently.
"We now see the U.S. preparing for a U.S.-
Marcos dictatorship," she said.
Roy Pateman, a lecturer at the University of
Sydney, spoke on U.S. relations with
Australia and New Zealand. Pateman said Sat-

urday's election in Australia should not yield
any upsets, partly because of Reagan's re
election.
Pateman said the U.S.-Australian alliance
was important to citizens of Australia and most
people regard U.S. bases there as an "insurance
policy."
"There's a psychological feeling that because
we have put ourselves on the line as host to your
bases, then you can and must support us."
Pateman said.
However, Pateman also said the assertion of
force in Central America, the development of
the Trident submarine and the "Star Wars"
defense system "scares the hell out of a number
of people there."
