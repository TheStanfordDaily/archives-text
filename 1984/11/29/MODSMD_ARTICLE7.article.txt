Weinberger outlines cautious plan
WASHINGTON — Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, trying
to correct an image as an unbending "superhawk" and "cold warrior,"
declared yesterday that President Reagan would not allow the United
States "to creep, or be drawn gradually, into a combat role in Central
America,"
But, he cautioned in a major speech, the United States should never
make the mistake it made in Vietnam and fail to devote all necessary re
sources to win any war it enters.
I he defense secretary, outlining his views on the proper use of force
by the United States — and his differences on the subject with others in
the Reagan administration — said Americans cannot take over others'
defense responsibilities "when our own freedom is not threatened."
"We should only engage our troops if we must do so as a matter of our
own vital national interest," Weinberger said in the speech, delivered at
the National Press Club.
"The problems confronting us in Central America today are difficult,"
he said. "The possibility of more extensive Soviet and Soviet-proxy
penetration into this hemisphere in the months ahead is something we
should recognize. If this happens, we will clearly need more economic
and military assistance and training to help those countries who want
democracy."
But, seeking to apply what he called the lessons of the Vietnam War,
he stated: "The president will not allow our military forces to creep, or
be drawn gradually, into a combat role in Central America or any other
place in the world. And indeed, our policy is designed to prevent the
need for direct American involvement."
MiG shipment suspected again
WASHINGTON — President Reagan said in an interview published
yesterday that six Soviet vessels are en route to Nicaragua bringing mili
tary weaponry, and that he is in touch with the Soviet Union on the
question of whether the ships are carrying MiG jets.
White House spokesman Larry Speakes later softened Reagan's
remark, saying "the man is assuming from appearances" of crates on
board the six ships that they are carrying arms, but that he does not
know for sure. "We make the assumption that there are arms on these
ships," Speakes said, but "we're just not prepared" to say what kind.
A well-placed military source in Managua told a Washington Post cor
respondent on Tuesday that he was unaware of any Soviet arms ship
ments en route to Nicaragua at this time.
A senior Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry official went further: "We've
already said it: There are no MiGs coming in the near future," the offi
cial said. "We are not going to stop having relations with the Soviet
Union or any other nation, and we are not going to say what is coming
on ships."
President considers budget cuts
WASHINGTON — President Reagan is considering bundling into
one enormous bill the billions of dollars in domestic-spending cuts he
will propose to Congress next year in an effort to force a single up-or
down vote in Congress, a senior White House official said yesterday.
A similar tactic was used in his first year in office, by far his most suc
cessful in cutting the budget.
Budget director David Stockman gave Reagan a list yesterday of pos
sible cuts in domestic spending that have been termed Draconian by
White House aides, together with some curtailment of the military
buildup that was a conspicuous feature of his first term. While the presi
dent made no decisions "he liked what he saw," an official said.
The White House would bundle the cuts together on the theory that
they would be harder to vote down that way. Its strategy would be to cast
the Democratic leadership of the House as "obstructionists" standing in
the way of deficit reduction if they refused to vote on the one big bill.
"The elections showed that the American people do not want a tax in
crease." said White House chief of staff James Baker yesterday. "If ne
cessary, the president wM-g?***. r li'u kc;;d of-GMgrel+irnxJ take ::i* ctrc
to the American people to achieve his goals of budget cuts and deficit re
duction."
Food rerouted to Ethiopia
ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia — Eighty thousand tons of food in transit
throughout the world has been rerouted hurriedly to Ethiopia in recent
days to head off a new short-term famine emergency caused by rapidly
filling refugee camps and the slow delivery of larger aid shipments that
are not due to arrive until late January, according to officials here.
Among the emergency diversions is a ship that was carrying 10,000
tons of U.S. government grain bound for India. Members of the House
Select Committee on Hunger, at the end of a four-day visit to study the
famine problem, announced here yesterday that diversion of the ship
came after they had sent cables to President Reagan and other U.S. offi
cials explaining the "very severe shortfall of food in December."
Most of the food warehouses at Assab, Ethiopia's major port, are
empty. There is only a three-day supply of food left at the Korem
feeding camp, home to about 31,000 famine refugees. The British Royal
Air Force this week ran out of food to airlift to mountain camps and
ended its thrice daily flights to Assab.
With demand for food increasing rapidly at overcrowded feeding
centers in north-central Ethiopia, and with almost no scheduled ship
ments of donated food arriving until late January, the Ethiopian govern
ment and private relief agencies became alarmed in recent days that they
rapidly were approaching a point where they would be unable to keep
famine victims from starving in feeding camps.
Deukmejian suspends state order
SACRAMENTO — Gov. George Deukmejian, facing fierce criticism
of his administration, yesterday suspended a state order that Medi-Cal
recipients must sell their homes in order to continue receiving benefits.
The Health Department's policy, targeting 30,000 nursing home
patients, had stemmed from a "narrow interpretation" of state and
federal laws, but the department had "probably" acted in good faith
when it issued the directive, the governor said.
Instead of forcing home sales, the Republican governor suggested that
liens against patients' property could be employed.
"While the department probably proceeded in good faith to carry out
our state law consistent with federal regulations, it seems to me there
exists a better way to do it," Deukmejian said in a written statement.
He said forcing the sale of homes could only add "to the anxiety and
illness" of the Medi-Cal patients.
Transplant patient recovering
LOUISVILLE, Ky. — The world's second artificial heart recipient,
making progress toward recovery that "amazed" one of his doctors, ate
his first bites of solid food yesterday and joked with doctors and nurses.
William Schroeder's mental attitude since he awoke with the mechani
cal heart in his chest "is a very strong factor in his favor," said Dr. Allan
Lansing, chief clinical spokesman for the Humana Heart Institute Inter
national.
It's very important that he be cheerful, be able to joke. There's no
doubt that that is very positive — more important than most medicines
— to recovery." Lansing said.
All of Schroeder's vital signs were stable yesterday and the 52-year
old from Jasper, Ind., sat up in his bed, with his legs dangling over the
side, for the first time since his surgery, said Dr. Robert Goodin, chief of
cardiology at Humana Hospital Audubon.
"I'm amazed that he has this kind of strength and progress three days
following this kind of surgery," Goodin said. "He will undoubtedly he
up in a chair by tomorrow at the rate he's progressing now."
Stocks fall sharply
NEW YORK — The stock market fell sharply yesterday as Wall
Street shrugged off most major banks' adoption of an 11 percent prime
lending rate, the lowest since March.
Much of the downturn came in the final hour, and prices closed near
their lows of the session.
Today's weather
Mostly sunny with some high clouds today. Highs from the mid 50s to
mid 60s.
