## Sen. Dole elected majority leader 
### 
WASHINGTON —Sen. Robert Dole (R-Kan.),
who can be expected to temper his loyalt\ to Presi
dent Reagan by giving the Senate a strong indepen
dent voice, was elected majority leader on the
fourth ballot cast yesterday by his Republican col
leagues.
Dole, who succeeds retiring Sen. Howard Baker
Jr. (R-Tenn.) in the powerful post, defeated Sen.
Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) 28-25, after Sens Richard
Lugar (R-Ind.), Pete Domenici (R-N M.) and
James McClure (R-lda.) had been eliminated on
three earlier, secret ballots.
Dole, a deft, articulate legislator who has been
more willing than Reagan in the past to fight
federal deficits with tax increases, said after the
voting, "We will support the president's programs
when we can."
But he made clear that an important aim will be
considering the agenda of Senate Republicans, who
will have a difficult time retaining their slim 53-47
advantage over Democrats in the 1986 elections. A
total of 22 Republicans and only 1 2 Democrats will

be up for re-election then.
Several GOP senators said it was important to
have a leader such as Dole who would be willing to
stand apart from White House defense and eco
nomic policies if they did not jibe with what the
voters wanted back home.
Dole's election as majority leader cleared the
way for Lugar, a reliable Reagan ally, to become
chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Commit
tee, replacing Sen. Charles Percy (R-11l ). who was
defeated for re-election Nov. 6.
Sen. Jesse Helms (R- N.C.). a frequent critic of
Reagan foreign policies who was in line to take
over the influential post, said he would reluctantly
keep a campaign promise to remain as chairman ot
the Agriculture Committee.
"If I can't keep my word, 1 don't belong here.
Helms said, noting that he owed special allegiance
to tobacco farmers whose support helped send him
to Washington.
Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.) will succeed Dole
as chairman of the Finance Committee, which will

consider whatever tax-simplification plan Reagan
recommends. The move could spell trouble tor the
White House, with whom the outspoken, generally
liberal Packwood has warred, but Packwood and
Dole have held similar views on tax matters.
As in the bruising, closely tought majority leader
battle, conservative ideologues were rejected in fa
vor of pragmatic conservatives or moderate-to
liberal Republicans in races for other key leader
ship jobs that involve policymaking and frequent
meetings with Reagan. However, Sen. Pete Wilson
(R-Calif ) and others argued that the choices were
based more on personal than ideological grounds.
Sen. Alan Simpson (R-Wyo.), as witty and prag
matically conservative as Dole, was elected GOP
whip, succeeding Stevens in the No. 2 leadership
position. Simpson defeated Sen. Slade Gorton (R-
Wash.) after Sen. Robert Kasten (R-Wis.), a
staunch advocate of supply-side economics, was
eliminated on the first ballot.
