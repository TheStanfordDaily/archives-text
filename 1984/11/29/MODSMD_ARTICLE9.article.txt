WASHINGTON â€” William Ruck
leshaus, administrator of the Envi
ronmental Protection Agency,
abruptly resigned last night, and offi
cials said he is likely to be replaced by
one of his principal deputies, Lee
Thomas.
In an exchange of letters, Ruckel
shaus said the troubled agency he in
herited "is righted and is now steering
a steady course." President Reagan
said he was accepting the resignation
with "great regret."
Some sources said Ruckelshaus
was unhappy with the prospect of cuts

in the EPA's operating budget of as
much as 30 percent as part of the ad
ministration's proposed spending
reductions.
A Sierra Club spokesman yester
day praised Ruckelshaus for his at
tention to health and safety concerns,
but said Reagan had listened instead
to the budget-cutting recommen
dations of David Stockman, Office of
Management and Budget director.
Others in the administration said
Ruckelshaus was simply eager to
return to Seattle, where he served as

vice president of the Weyerhaeuser
Co. until Reagan called on him in
March 1983 after allegations that the
EPA had mismanaged the regulation
of toxic-waste dumps forced Anne
Burford to resign as administrator.
"He thinks that he has done what
he came here to do and now its time
to do something else," a high-level
EPA official said. In Washington
state. Republicans have long consid
ered Ruckelshaus a prime prospect to
run for the governorship or a Senate
seat.
Ruckelshaus is the second high

level administration official to quit
since Reagan's re-election to a
second term. Education Secretary
T.H. Bell previously announced he
was leaving.
Thomas, the man favored to
replace his boss, is assistant adminis
trator in charge of the agency's
hazardous-waste programs. In this
capacity, he heads the $1.6 billion
"Superi'und" that Congress created
to clean up the nation's most danger
ous toxic-waste sites.
