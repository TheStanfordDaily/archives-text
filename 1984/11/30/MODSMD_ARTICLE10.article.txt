## Egyptian Consul criticizes Israel 
### LYNN MARCUS Staff writer 
"It's time the U.S. take a decisive stand by telling
Israel enough is enough," the Egyptian Consul
General to San Francisco told a Bechtel Interna
tional Center audience yesterday.
Criticizing Israeli violations of "the letter and
spirit" of the Camp David Accords, Consul Ismail
Abd El-Moeti outlined Egypt's positions on cur
rent events in the Middle East, reaffirmed his
country's commitment to peace in the region and
called on the United States to exercise "dynamic
leadership" to bring about a negotiated settlement.
El-Moeti accused Israel of placing obstacles in
the way of peace in the Middle East by refusing to
negotiate with the Palestinians, allowing and en
couraging new settlements on the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, invading Lebanon and failing to
withdraw from Taba in the Sinai.
The diplomat said former Egyptian President
Anwar Sadat's unprecedented visit to Jerusalem in
1977 and Egypt's compliance with the agreement
reached at Camp David demonstrate Egypt's
dedication to establishing peace between the Arabs
and the Israelis.
"Unfortunately, the Israeli government em
barked on a different course" after the signing of
the Camp David accords, El-Moeti said.
He said that while the Egyptians had hoped the
accords would resolve the problem of the Palestin
ian people by granting them full autonomy on the
West Bank, "Israel's narrow interpretation of
autonomy" quickly eroded such hopes.
El-Moeti, who has served in the Egyptian gov
ernment since 1958, accused the Israelis of "brutal
treatment" of Palestinians through repressive

measures including indiscriminate detention with
out trial and the shooting of teenage protesters.
"Jewish settlers took the law into their own hands,"
he said.
El-Moeti also cited "Israeli annexation of the
Golan Heights and Arab East Jerusalem and the
bombing of the Iraqi nuclear reactor" as obstacles
to the peace process.
Even so, Egypt will continue to adhere to the
peace treaty and to try to convince other Arab
states to join in the peace process, despite Israel's
reneging on an agreement to withdraw from the
Taba region of the Sinai in 1982 and the invasion of
Lebanon, he said. "For Egypt, peace is irrevoca
ble."
El-Moeti said the recent restoration of relations
between Jordan and Egypt will "help give a push to
. . . finding a solution to the Palestinian problem,"
but added that U.S. efforts are also necessary.
"It is an established fact that the U.S. exercises
significant leverage upon all parties concerned," he
said. The consul general praised President
Reagan's peace initiative, a plan which the Israelis
rejected, and called for the United States to pres
sure Israel to negotiate with the Palestinian Libera
tion Organization.
"Can we help these two peoples to start negotia
tions and consider moderation to achieve what they
yearn for?" El-Moeti asked, "I believe we can, but
we need the dynamic leadership from the United
States."
El-Moeti also addressed the conflicts in the Per
sian Gulf and in Lebanon. He accused Iran of
trying to "force her system" on Iraq by overthrow
ing the government and described an Egyptian

peace proposal that would involve a United Na
tions peace-keeping force.
He called for the withdrawal of Israeli forces
from Lebanon and their replacement with U.N.
troops. "We should increase the number of U.N.
forces and give them the necessary mandate to per
form their mission in Southern Lebanon."
A question-and-answer session following the
speech soon turned into a heated debate between
El-Moeti and several audience members, one of
whom accused the diplomat of "being very hard on
the Jews." Another accused him of putting the sit
uation in the Middle East into "a framework of fal
lacies and distortions."
El-Moeti denied both accusations and added,
"We are not against the Israelis. We are not against
the Jewish people. Israel has the right to live but
the Palestinians also have the right to live."
He said the Egyptians are-asking the Israelis to
help them in their efforts to "extend peace all over
the region."
El-Moeti received a bachelor's degree in com
merce from the University of Cairo in 1951 and
then entered the Egyptian navy and served as an
officer for six years. He began his "second career"
in 1958 with his appointment as the second secre
tary in the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Since then he has served Egypt as a consul in
Turkey; as the first secretary of the Egyptian em
bassy in Madrid; as the charge d'affaires in
Ougadougou, Upper Volta; as the counselor of the
Egyptian embassy in Rome; and as Egypt's ambas
sador at the United Nations Development Founda
tion Governing Council. He was appointed Egypt's
consul general to San Francisco in 1983.
