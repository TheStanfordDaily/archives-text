America spends a lot of money on its medicine.
Each year, we spend close to $70 billion on
health care and related costs. That's more than
$270 for every man, woman and child in this
country. And that figure doesn't include expen
sive academic research.
For that money, we get some very sophisti
cated medical care. Our doctors use the finest
equipment that high technology can produce and
money can buy.
Yet for all the wonder drugs, CAT-scanners
and plastic hearts we develop, there remains a
dark side to American health care.
Beneath the glitter of the Barney Clarks, Baby
Faes and William Schroeders lies an America no
ones likes talking about: an America in which
babies die because of malnutrition, pregnant
women don't receive pre-natal care and children
don't receive the immunizations most of us take
for granted.
Infant death rates in inner-city ghettos and in
rural areas such as Appalachia are twice those of
the U.S. average and three times those of affluent
regions. Furthermore, the United States, the
wealthiest and most technologically advanced na
tion on Earth, has an infant-mortality rate that
ranks 14th in the world. Many nations poorer

than the United States, including some "Third
World" nations like Cuba, have lower infant
mortality rates.
With the price of medical care continually
spiraling upward, even basic primary care is
beyond the reach of many lower- and lower
middle-class Americans. Medicaid, Medical and
similarly minded programs, while good ideas,
barely scratch the surface of the problem.
What we need is a national health plan that
guarantees everyone a basic level of both
preventive and primary care. Such a plan could
be administered at state or federal level, using
direct or indirect payment or a voucher system.
Opponents of a national health plan point to
Great Britain, whose National Health Service is
beset with problems including a one- to two-year
waiting period before one can receive elective
surgery.
It's true that any administrative program has
inherent inefficiencies, but it seems fairer to have
a somewhat inefficient health-care program that
cares for everyone rather than a super-efficient
system that leaves some patients out in the cold.
It's better to wait two years for surgery than
never to receive it at all.
Proper medical care should not be a luxury.
