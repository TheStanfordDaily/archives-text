## Predictable right-wing demonology 
### 
Edwin Harwood's viewpoint, "Defend
freedom," (The Daily, Nov. 7) is as disturbing for
what it states as for what it implies. Harwood's
central thesis posits a highly polarized world of
democracies and totalitarian powers in which the
United States has an unquestioned right and duty
to apply military force at times in the defense of
liberty. Failure to carry out our moral role is
equated with "appeasement" of these totalitarian
powers and their regional surrogates, an invitation

VIEWPOINT

to further aggression on their part and an even
more likely major conflict sometime in the future.
Harwood's essay is replete with the standard and
predictable right-wing demonology. Those who
oppose a possible sending of American troops to
Central America either are morally blind to com
munist atrocities in areas like Southeast Asia when
we lacked the will as a nation in the past to persist
militarily (isn't it the same Reagan administration,
aware of such past atrocities, that currently sup
ports the genocidal Khmer Rouge leaders as the
legitimate government of Kampuchea?); or they
have been "conditioned" to appease by jnaleyolent
groups dedicated to undermining American power
and playing upon the guilt-ridden and despairing
confusion of misinformed Americans. Importantly,
for Harwood, the cutting edge of this moral
struggle between democracies and totalitarian
states within the United States has now shifted to
our American universities. Harwood worries that
our universities, as in the Vietnam era, again would
morally retreat and fail to support our mission
against totalitarianism. American universities again
would open their doors to accommodators of the
enemy and fail to mobilize American public
opinion in favor of military force.
Harwood's caricature of the world divided into
those supporting and opposing liberty, freedom
and the use of American military force hardly
merits serious discussion or rebuttal. Unfortun
ately, it all too closely echoes the mindset of the
Reagan administration, which has substituted for a
realistic foreign policy a narrow self-righteous
morality, philosophical categories and almost a
blissful celebration of its own ignorance about the
nations, peoples and problems of the world.
The problems of nation-states, the complexities
of world events and the ambiguous and unknown
motivations of foreign leaders (and their fellow
Americans) are all easily interpreted and explained
in this mindset. As in the most dogmatic excesses of

communist ideology, peoples and nations do not
exist in all their perplexing diversity, but as
dehumanized and objectified categories of good
and evil. As communists interpret world events in
light of an assumed "correlation of forces," the
world in this mindset is also understandable as a
flow of interconnected happenings all either
impeding or facilitating our moral quest as a nation
to resist totalitarianism and promote liberty. We
need not attempt (and perhaps should not attempt)
to understand the complexities of society, politics,
economics or history in Central America, because
understanding and the very awareness of com
plexity could undermine our national will to mount
action against the spread of totalitarianism in that
region. As communist ideologues shut off debate
by citing an authoritative term from Lenin, the at
tribution of the label "totalitarian" to a nation
state or "appeaser" to an opponent of American
military force in a particular situation ipso facto
ends further discussion about the complex political
realities of nations or the ethical justifications of
American actions. Even more alarming, the func
tion of American universities is redefined: not di
versify and the search for truth among critical and
informed thinkers but the mobilization of support
for the mission against worldwide totalitarianism.
As someone who has been associated with
various American universities over the past two
decades and who plans to spend the next three
decades in college teaching, I find Harwood's com
ments professionally offensive and threatening. As
someone who, like Harwood, is also temporarily
affiliated with the Hoover Institution, I find it ne
cessary to write in opposition if only to avoid my
own guilt by association through silence. And, as
someone who has taught and written on Soviet
politics and government since 1971, I find Har
wood's implications quite disturbing and all too
familiar. Those who would identify the purpose of
American universities with mobilizing public sup
port and who question the motivations of those op
posing military force in such areas as Central
America sound all too much like those whose arti
cles have appeared with increasing frequency since
1981 in many Soviet periodicals: imploring Soviet
youth to increase their ideological "vigilance"
against Western influences; encouraging their fel
low Soviet social scientists to rededicate their ef
forts with "counter-propaganda" refuting Western
distortions of Soviet reality; and applauding the
"liberating" mission of Soviet troops in Afghanis
tan as the highest form of Soviet international
morality.

The spirit of that liberty and democracy, which I
revere as much as Harwood, and the very differ
ence between our society and theirs, should be ex
actly what Harwood implies our universities
foresake: the encouragement of diversity and
tolerance, conflicting ideas, an appreciation of the
Â» wondrous complexity in the human condition and
the search for objective truth unfettered by one
dimensional ideologies and dubious morality. It is
in such "totalitarian" nations as the Soviet Union
that universities have long been used to "mobilize"
support, promote militarism-patriotism and stifle
objectivity and anti-state opinions. Anti-state
opinions in those nations are also perceived to be
"conditioned" by outsiders hostile to their way of
life and the state's moral duty to bring "freedom"
to an Afghanistan or Czechoslovakia.
Despite Harwood's use of Munich analogies and
the supposedly immutable lessons of history which
we should have learned about appeasing
totalitarian states, today's parallel is not 1938. It is
the years immediately preceding 1914, when close
minded nationalistic leaders on both sides began to
substitute an arms build-up and military force for
diplomacy in a changing world they either could
not or refused to understand. Nor should the ques
tion be whether a lack of support for military force
undermines our military morale and leads to a
greater loss of lives. Actually, American military
officers as reported in our press have provided
some of the most knowledgeable and severe
criticisms of our past military actions in Lebanon
and Grenada and any future involvements in
Central America; and the few White House staff
with military backgrounds like Robert McFarlane
appear to be among the minority injecting at least a
semblance of common-sense realism in the other
wise ideological ramblings of the Reagan adminis
tration. .
Even more, the question should be whether the
current Reagan administration is competent to
devise a sane and rational foreign policy, sensitive
to the complex realities of the world as it exists and
precluding the senseless resort to military force in
the wrong places for the wrong reasons. Knowledge
of the world as it is should be the mission of a Stan
ford University or Hoover Institution, not the
promotion of militarism or an ideological party
line.
