Where's the beef?
Is Stanford the school of apathy,
as it was once hailed? Autumn quar
ter of 1984 has certainly proved that
student activism is alive and kicking.
The elections spurred on a slew of
organizations, all of which attracted
great numbers of students. The
Mondale-Ferraro cluh was the larg
est such venture in the country, with
activities almost every day. Likewise,
the Stanford Republicans had never
been stronger and yielded an equally
enthusiastic following. Stanford-in-
Government provided speakers.
Central American Forum had rallies
and Students Against Reaganism led
songs. Let's face it: Students had the
energy that had somehow been
sapped since the '60s.
But with the election now at a
close, one would expect a return to
the myopia and shallowness of yes
teryear. Not so. This last week the
Middle East was again a hot issue on
campus with the upcoming anniver
sary of the U.N. partition of Israel. It
has been 37 years since the creation
of the democratic Jewish state. To
commemorate this day, students
circulated petitions throughout the
campus calling for continued Ameri
can "policies which enhance Israel's
economic recovery and military
security." The result was overwhelm
ing support for the statement and
enough donations to buy space
for it in The Daily.
Political activism at Stanford does
not revolve around election years or
Dead Week. Rather, it thrives when
students take the initiative to rally
behind an important cause. The
existence of Israel is one such cause
and one that Stanford students aren't
hesitant to admit.

Recently, Dr. Helen Caldicott
spoke to a group of Stanford stu
dents at Branner Hall in an effort to
enlist them as members of Physicians

for Social Responsibility, encourag
ing them to leave studies and books
behind in favor of joining her move
ment. During her talk she implied
that she was privy to more counsel
and intelligence sources than people
in the highest levels of our govern
ment. She was very liberal in her
charges of lying and brainwashing on
the part of the Reagan administra
tion. Having sat through an hour of
her lies and brainwashing efforts, I
must say she is hardly in a position to
make such accusations.
It is possible to alter the balance of
power by influencing perceptions. In
this connection, as one Soviet scholar
has revealed, the role of information
and misinformation is growing in
world politics. It is small wonder she
is unable to find anyone but an oc
casional government underling to
debate when her basic premises are
so unsound and her methods so rich
in propaganda. She implied that the
United States, not the Soviet Union,
is the expansionist country. She
characterized the differences be
tween the two countries as a silly,
childish argument about who has the
best system of life. I wonder if the
people of Afghanistan, Hungary,
Czechoslovakia, etc., who are no
longer free to choose their own
destiny, would agree.
I certainly share her deep concern
over a nuclear confrontation with
any nation, and I'm confident Presi
dent Reagan does too. Unfortun
ately, Caldicott's statements charging
him with stupidity, lack of knowl
edge and impending senility indicate
she may have difficulty accepting
that. Reagan has publicly declared a
nuclear weapons reduction (and
hopefully, total elimination) to be his
main priority for his second term in
office. My suggestion to Caldicott,
since she has been living here in
America for so many years now, is to
invest the effort and commitment to
become a citizen and join the huge
numbers of free-thinking, intelligent
Americans who are actively seeking
reasonable solutions to this complex
problem.
