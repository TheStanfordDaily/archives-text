## The
						spirit that is Poland 
### 
Has Solidarity been successfully
and finally crushed? The assassina
tion of the Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko
last month and the defection of 428
Poles to West Germany this month
depressingly seem to indicate so.
However, the possibility of freedom in
Poland is indeed still alive — it lives
in a hope that can be provided by the
Catholic Church and the Western
economic powers.
On Dec. 13, 1981, Gen. Woj
ciech Jaruzelski declared martial
law in Poland. Solidarity was
outlawed and its leaders were im
prisoned. Although martial law has
been lifted and many political dissi
dents have been freed, the Polish
government remains determined to
extinguish the people's movement
that once spread through Poland like
a fierce brush fire.
Today the government employs
more covert ways to kill the spirit of
Solidarity. After unprecedently is
suing passports to entire families
(families probably considered a
threat to the state), the Polish gov
ernment cannot possibly be surprised
at the recent explosion of defection.
It has become an unofficial method of
exile.
According to a spokesman for the
Interior Ministry in Bonn, the small
flow of Polish refugees that began in
1981 has tidal waved to 3,000
seeking political asylum in West Ger
many during this year alone! Inter

viewed refugees cite various reasons
for defecting: the desire to join
relatives in the West, Jaruzelski's fail
ure to improve economic conditions
and, most frequently, the political un
certainty since Popieluszko's assas
sination.
The Polish government's use of as
sassination as an instrument in
suppressing Solidarity is even more
repulsive. Three members of the se
cret police are charged with kidnap
ping and killing the outspoken

The Polish government cannot be

Popieluszko; an Interior Ministry
colonel is accused of assisting them.
Assassination seems to be so much in
fashion among governments these
days — the Soviet ties to the attempt
on Pope John Paul IPs life, the
American ClA's infamous manual in
Nicaragua, the Philippine military's
slaying of Mayor Ceser Climaco and
Benigno Aquino. One thinks they
would have learned from the assas
sination of Ferdinand II (which
ignited World War I) that assassina
tion only causes more problems than
it purports to solve.
This is exemplified in the assassina-

tion of Popieluszko, as it only
strengthened the religious community
in its opposition to the government.
In a letter read before 25,000 during
the memorial mass for Popieluszko
last Sunday, Rev. Josef Cardinal
Glemp, the Polish Primate,
demanded full explanation of
Popieluszko's assassination from the
government. The Catholic Church in
Poland has never been stronger; it is
overflowing with socially responsible
young priests and flourishing under

the personal care of the Pope. The
Church is a sanctuary for political
dissidents, a safe home for outlawed
Solidarity; it embodies a most effec
tive vehicle for achieving social prog
ress from within Poland.
The Western economic powers can
provide another vehicle for progress
from outside of Poland. This oppor
tunity lies in decreasing the Polish
economic dependence on the Soviets.
Jaruzelski himself said that the eco
nomic sanctions imposed by the U S
had indeed led Poland to closer ties
with its Soviet-bloc allies. If the
West were to replace this economic

dependence with comprehensive aid
that fosters economic independence,
future Polish leaders would have
some leeway to establish civil
freedoms which pressure from the
Soviets would otherwise prevent.
This is admittedly no overnight solu
tion; but both Jaruzelski's new inter
est in better relations with America,
and America's re-institution of
Poland's favorite-nation status for
loans are an optimistic start.
Solidarity's bright flame has not
diminished to a mere flicker despite
the government's apparent success in
outlawing the movement. The Polish
refugees could become Solidarity's
voice in the West, and the assassina
tion of Popieluszko has created a last
ing opposition sentiment that could
render future assassinations useless.
A continued commitment from the
church and the West will assure
that Solidarity's struggles for human
rights remain alive. In the words of
Teofil Bogucki, pastor of
Popieluszko's parish: Popieluszko's
cult is growing and"the labors of
those who would stop it by violence
and force are in vain. Nothing can
stop Poland, which marches toward
the sun of love and truth, toward the
sun of solidarity and freedom."
