# Stanford OKs smoking rules
## Restricts indoor smoking 
### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
A new University policy will
prohibit smoking in any indoor
campus area where smokers and non
smokers share the same space. Offi
cials say the University adopted the
measure because of the adverse
health effects of second-hand smoke.
The regulation bans cigarette, cigar
and pipe smoking in classrooms,
open-air offices and public areas in
cluding lobbies, hallways, restrooms
and stairwell 1 -.
University officials who approved
the policy Wednesday are trying to
achieve a "smoke-free environment,"
according to Marlene Wine, special
assistant to University President
Donald Kennedy. The measure was
adopted after seven months of work
by an eight-member ad hoc commit
tee. It will take effect Jan. 1, 1985.
University vice presidents and
deans are responsible for implement
ing and enforcing the measure, which
Wine calls "a radical change" in Stan
ford policy.
"I would anticipate that there will
be some people who are unhappy,"
said Wine, a member of the commit
tee.
"It's an emotional subject," said
Robert Freelen, vice president for
public affairs. "Sure it will be hard to
enforce."
"It's going to cause some tensions,
but we think that those can be

worked out," said Henry Riggs, vice
president for development. Riggs said
the proposal had been widely dis
cussed among faculty and staff before
its adoption and thus comes as no
surprise.
The policy calls for the establish
ment of designated smoking sections
in work areas where space permits. In
addition, up to one-third of dininy
and lounge areas will be reserved tor
smokers if ventilation is adequate.
Smoking will also be permitted in
closed rooms which have floor-to
ceiling partitions, as long as non
smokers are not exposed to
secondhand smoke.
Nevertheless, University officials
concede that some buildings are too
small to accommodate smoking sec
tions. Riggs also said the policy will
be especially tough on heavy smokers
who work in general work areas.
These people would have to leave
their desks and go to specially desig
nated areas or outside in order to
smoke
"The presumption is that eveiy
thing is a no-smoking area unless des
ignated smoking," Riggs said It
may be called a no-smoking policy
rather than a smoking policy."
Stanford's policy comes in the
wake of similar measures adopted
throughout the area. On Tuesday, the
San Jose City Council passed a strict
smoking ordinance. Other cities that
have similar regulations include San
Francisco, Palo Alto and Mountain
View. Los Angeles officials are cur
rently considering a smoking policy.
But whereas most of these regula
tions affect only the workplace, Stan
ford's guidelines apply to the entire
campus. Wine said the University
went further "because we're a re
search institution, and we like to view
ourselves as avant garde and health
concerned."
Wine said the primary purpose of
the policy is to protect non-smokers
from carcinogenic sidestream smoke.
She cited a study by the Environmen
tal Protection Agency estimating that
500 to 5,000 non-smokers die each
year of lung cancer caused by other
people's cigarettes.
According to University statistics,
6 percent of all Stanford students are
smokers, and 12 to 13 percent of fac
ulty and staff members smoke.

"Our intent is not to single out
smokers and say, 'Hey, you guys are
really terrible,' " Wine said. "But in
the meantime, we want to protect the
majority of the University population
who are non-smokers."
In an official statement, Kennedy
said, "Stanford is dedicated to pro
viding a safe and healthful environ
ment. . . . Moreover, the University
his substantial commitments to
health-related research and teaching
and for patient care. Thus the Stan
ford community has a particular obli
gation to be sensitive to health
protection issues."
Officials said all faculty and staff
would be informed of the new policy
through interdepartmental memoran
dums.
Aside from looking out for the
health interests of non-smokers,
Wine said the policy might encourage
existing smokers to quit. She said
University assistance is available for
those who are trying to quit through
the Stanford Help Center and the
Health Improvement Program.
The ad hoc committee, chaired by
Vice Provost Rav Bacchetti. includes

representatives from the following
University departments: Manage
ment and Budget, Personnel, the
Health Improvement Program, the
Heart Disease Prevention Program,
the Help Center and the president's
office.
The policy guidelines are scheduled
to be reviewed July 1, 1985, after six
months.

ment and Budget, Personnel, the
Health Improvement Program, the
Heart Disease Prevention Program,
the Help Center and the president's
office.
The policy guidelines are scheduled
to be reviewed July 1, 1985, after six
months.
A new University policy will
prohibit smoking in any indoor
campus area where smokers and non
smokers share the same space. Offi
cials say the University adopted the
measure because of the adverse
health effects of second-hand smoke.
The regulation bans cigarette, cigar
and pipe smoking in classrooms,
open-air offices and public areas in
cluding lobbies, hallways, restrooms
and stairwell 1 -.
University officials who approved
the policy Wednesday are trying to
achieve a "smoke-free environment,"
according to Marlene Wine, special
assistant to University President
Donald Kennedy. The measure was
adopted after seven months of work
by an eight-member ad hoc commit
tee. It will take effect Jan. 1, 1985.
University vice presidents and
deans are responsible for implement
ing and enforcing the measure, which
Wine calls "a radical change" in Stan
ford policy.
"I would anticipate that there will
be some people who are unhappy,"
said Wine, a member of the commit
tee.
"It's an emotional subject," said
Robert Freelen, vice president for
public affairs. "Sure it will be hard to
enforce."
"It's going to cause some tensions,
but we think that those can be

worked out," said Henry Riggs, vice
president for development. Riggs said
the proposal had been widely dis
cussed among faculty and staff before
its adoption and thus comes as no
surprise.
The policy calls for the establish
ment of designated smoking sections
in work areas where space permits. In
addition, up to one-third of dininy
and lounge areas will be reserved tor
smokers if ventilation is adequate.
Smoking will also be permitted in
closed rooms which have floor-to
ceiling partitions, as long as non
smokers are not exposed to
secondhand smoke.
Nevertheless, University officials
concede that some buildings are too
small to accommodate smoking sec
tions. Riggs also said the policy will
be especially tough on heavy smokers
who work in general work areas.
These people would have to leave
their desks and go to specially desig
nated areas or outside in order to
smoke
"The presumption is that eveiy
thing is a no-smoking area unless des
ignated smoking," Riggs said It
may be called a no-smoking policy
rather than a smoking policy."
Stanford's policy comes in the
wake of similar measures adopted
throughout the area. On Tuesday, the
San Jose City Council passed a strict
smoking ordinance. Other cities that
have similar regulations include San
Francisco, Palo Alto and Mountain
View. Los Angeles officials are cur
rently considering a smoking policy.
But whereas most of these regula
tions affect only the workplace, Stan
ford's guidelines apply to the entire
campus. Wine said the University
went further "because we're a re
search institution, and we like to view
ourselves as avant garde and health
concerned."
Wine said the primary purpose of
the policy is to protect non-smokers
from carcinogenic sidestream smoke.
She cited a study by the Environmen
tal Protection Agency estimating that
500 to 5,000 non-smokers die each
year of lung cancer caused by other
people's cigarettes.
According to University statistics,
6 percent of all Stanford students are
smokers, and 12 to 13 percent of fac
ulty and staff members smoke.

"Our intent is not to single out
smokers and say, 'Hey, you guys are
really terrible,' " Wine said. "But in
the meantime, we want to protect the
majority of the University population
who are non-smokers."
In an official statement, Kennedy
said, "Stanford is dedicated to pro
viding a safe and healthful environ
ment. . . . Moreover, the University
his substantial commitments to
health-related research and teaching
and for patient care. Thus the Stan
ford community has a particular obli
gation to be sensitive to health
protection issues."
Officials said all faculty and staff
would be informed of the new policy
through interdepartmental memoran
dums.
Aside from looking out for the
health interests of non-smokers,
Wine said the policy might encourage
existing smokers to quit. She said
University assistance is available for
those who are trying to quit through
the Stanford Help Center and the
Health Improvement Program.
The ad hoc committee, chaired by
Vice Provost Rav Bacchetti. includes

representatives from the following
University departments: Manage
ment and Budget, Personnel, the
Health Improvement Program, the
Heart Disease Prevention Program,
the Help Center and the president's
office.
The policy guidelines are scheduled
to be reviewed July 1, 1985, after six
months.
