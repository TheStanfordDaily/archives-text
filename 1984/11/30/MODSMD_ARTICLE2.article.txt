# Stanford OKs smoking rules
## Restricts indoor smoking 
### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
A new University policy will
prohibit smoking in any indoor
campus area where smokers and non
smokers share the same space. Offi
cials say the University adopted the
measure because of the adverse
health effects of second-hand smoke.
The regulation bans cigarette, cigar
and pipe smoking in classrooms,
open-air offices and public areas in
cluding lobbies, hallways, restrooms
and stairwell 1 -.
University officials who approved
the policy Wednesday are trying to
achieve a "smoke-free environment,"
according to Marlene Wine, special
assistant to University President
Donald Kennedy. The measure was
adopted after seven months of work
by an eight-member ad hoc commit
tee. It will take effect Jan. 1, 1985.
University vice presidents and
deans are responsible for implement
ing and enforcing the measure, which
Wine calls "a radical change" in Stan
ford policy.
"I would anticipate that there will
be some people who are unhappy,"
said Wine, a member of the commit
tee.
"It's an emotional subject," said
Robert Freelen, vice president for
public affairs. "Sure it will be hard to
enforce."
"It's going to cause some tensions,
but we think that those can be

worked out," said Henry Riggs, vice
president for development. Riggs said
the proposal had been widely dis
cussed among faculty and staff before
its adoption and thus comes as no
surprise.
The policy calls for the establish
ment of designated smoking sections
in work areas where space permits. In
addition, up to one-third of dininy
and lounge areas will be reserved tor
smokers if ventilation is adequate.
Smoking will also be permitted in
closed rooms which have floor-to
ceiling partitions, as long as non
smokers are not exposed to
secondhand smoke.
Nevertheless, University officials
concede that some buildings are too
small to accommodate smoking sec
tions. Riggs also said the policy will
be especially tough on heavy smokers
who work in general work areas.
These people would have to leave
their desks and go to specially desig
nated areas or outside in order to
smoke
"The presumption is that eveiy
thing is a no-smoking area unless des
ignated smoking," Riggs said It
may be called a no-smoking policy
rather than a smoking policy."
Stanford's policy comes in the
wake of similar measures adopted
throughout the area. On Tuesday, the
San Jose City Council passed a strict
