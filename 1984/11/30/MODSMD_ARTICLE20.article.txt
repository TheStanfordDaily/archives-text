## Stanford, UOP to open Apple Invite 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
There's one problem with the setup
of this weekend's Apple Invitational
Basketball Tournament as far as the
Stanford basketball team is con
cerned. Win or lose its first-round

game tonight, the Cardinal will have a
tougher one tomorrow night.
Stanford opens the fourth-annual
December tournament — the first
sponsored by Apple Computers, Inc.
— against the University of the
Pacific tonight at 7. The winner ad

vances to tomorrow night's champi
onship game at 9 against either I.a
Salle University (of Philadelphia) or
Brigham Young University. And the
loser plays either La Salle or Brigham
Young in the consolation game at 7
p.m.
"1 think fans are going to be
pleasantly surprised with the talent
they will see on the floor in.La Salle
and BYU," Stanford Coach Tom
Davis said. Neither team carries the
name of, say, a University of North
Carolina, the winner of last year's
tournament. But both teams have tal
ent comparable to, say, a North
Carolina, and both teams went to
postseason tournaments last year
like, say, a North Carolina.
"When you recruit a player from
Philly, and most of L.a Salle's players
are from there, those kids know how
to play." Davis said. "And BYU's
known for always having fine
players."
The La Salle Explorers' Ralph
Lewis and Steve Black, known in
Philadelphia as the Lewis and Black
Expedition, are both being "pushed
for national honors," according to La
Salle Coach Dave "Lefty" Ervin.
And BYU Coach Ladell Anderson
calls Scott Sinek "the best defensive
guard in the country."
The tournament, which was spon
sored by Hewlett Packard last year,
has traditionally had an East Coast
flavor. Host Stanford, which has been
in all three championship games, won
the tournament in 1982 by beating
Temple University, 77-70. The Uni
versity of Pennsylvania beat the
Cardinal, 71-63, in 1981 and North
Carolina won, 88-75, last year.
"1 think we have a decent tourna
ment going here," Davis said, "and

get into tomorrow night's Apple Invitational championship game.
we have a very good field this year."
It might also be one of the most
balanced fields with the possible ex
ception of Pacific, which is coming off
a 3-27 season. On paper, La Salle and
Brigham Young are better than Stan
ford, but both are missing key players
and won't be playing at full strength
this weekend. And both will be
playing before the recently raucous
crowds in Maples Pavilion, which
probably will be sold out both nights.
If anything, the BYU-La Salle
game at 9 p.m. will match two known
quantities. Both were 20-11 last
season and went to postseason tour
naments, BYU to the National Col
legiate Athletic Association tourney
and La Salle to the National Invita
tional Tournament.
On the other hand, the Stanford-
Pacific game will be a battle of two
teams with more questions than most
final exams. Seven of Pacific's 11
players are new to the program this
year. Stanford also has lots of new
faces after losing four of its top five
players and more than 70 percent of
its offense from last year's 19-12
squad.
Below is a team-by-team rundown
of the tournament in order of
tonight's games.
Stanford (1-0)
The Cardinal enters the tourna

ment undefeated hut untested. Stan
ford beat the University of California
at San Diego, 87-48, in its season
opener last Saturday but still left a lot
of questions unanswered, especially
how it will play in a close game.
Davis is hoping that question won't
be answered tonight. And unless
Pacific plays well and Stanford plays
poorly, or a combination of both, it
won't. Davis, however, remembers
well Stanford's opening-round game
last year against San Jose State, when
the Cardinal might have looked
ahead to North Carolina and almost
lost.
Davis will start the same lineup he
used against UCSD — Keith Ramee
and Novian Whitsitt at guard, Andy
Fischer and Earl Koberlein at for
ward, and Kent Seymour at center.
Everyone is healthy except guard
John Paye, who suffered a chest con
tusion last Friday and missed two
days of practice this week. Paye is
listed as probable for the tournament.
No matter what happens tonight,
Stanford will be tested tomorrow
against either La Salle or BYU.
Pacific (0-1)
Tigers Coach Tom O'Neill said,
"We feel we have improved ourselves
as a basketball team." But after last
year's 3-27 season, Pacific could do
nothing but improve.
O'Neill hit the recruiting trail early
and hard in an attempt to quickly
resurrect a Pacific program that
recently was a West Coast power.

"We feel we have recruited well, and
we feel our players are getting the
confidence to play at the Division I
college level," he said.
The Tigers opened the season with
a 73-61 loss at Portland University
last Saturday, but O'Neill said their
biggest problem was a lack of experi
ence, not talent.
Pacific matches up evenly with
Stanford in both height and experi
ence, or lack thereof. Sophomore
Brent Counts, the son of former pro
fessional star Mel Counts, is 6-9 and
starts at center, 6-8 junior Andy
Franklin and 6-6 freshman Domingo
Rosario (from the Dominican
Republic) at forward, and 6-5 junior
Drew Rogers and 6-0 sophomore
Kyle Pepple at guard.
At yesterday's pre-tournament
press conference at a local Chinese
restaurant, O'Neill said his fortune
cookie read, "You will play a host
team in a tournament and the officials
will be from [its] conference. Good
luck."
La Salle (1-1)
The Explorers were billed as the
pre-tournament favorite early this
week, but that was before they
ventured to St. Mary's University in
Moraga Wednesday night. La Salle
lost, 69-59.
Ervin, who spoke after O'Neill at
the press conference, also read his
fortune: "You will have the same
three officials this weekend as you
had last night." St. Mary's shot 36

free throws in the game. Fordham
shot nine.
When La Salle was down 37-21
early in the second half, Lewis and
Black got hot and they cut the deficit
to 41-39 in a matter of minutes. Then
the pair that look — and play — alike
got cold, and La Salle fell behind
again and lost.
The Explorers still would probably
walk away with the tournament title if
they had the services of 6-9, 215-
pound senior center Albert "Truck"
Butts. Butts, 24, was declared in
eligible last week by an obscure rule
penalizing a player a year of eligibility
if he plays past his 20th birthday in
high school. La Salle attempted to get
a 10-day injunction allowing Butts to
play until the NCAA reviews his case
next week, but the judge said no.
Hence, La Salle has no Butts for
the tournament and, if the St. Mary's
game was any indication, no
rebounding, either.
Brigham Young (0-0)
The Cougars thought losing Devin
Durrant, the NCAA's third-leading
scorer last season with a 27.9-points
per-game average, was bad enough.
Then the 1984-85 season began.
Four returning players accepted
Mormon mission calls, instantly end
ing their seasons before they began.
"And then," BYU Sports Informa
tion Director Dave Schulthess said,
"we started to get things like ankle
sprains." Then Sinek, the top retur
nee, got a knee in his back at a

practice and cracked a few ribs. And
then 7-2 center Carl Pollard also ac
cepted a mission call.
"It's just been a season of adversity
for Ladell (Anderson)," Schulthess
said. "He doesn't have much hair to
lose, either. Now we say we have
three teams at BYU — one on the
basketball court, one on the mission
field and one in the hospital."
Sinek is listed as questionable for
the tournament, but it's questionable
on the doubtful side. Without Sinek,
the Cougars are inexperienced, with
only two other seniors, but tall, with
seven players at least 6-6.
If Sinek does not play, Anderson is
expected to start 6-1 senior Marty
Perry, 6-5 junior Richie Webb, 6-6
senior Timo Saarelainen (who red
shirted last year to play on Finland's
Olympic team), 6-9 freshman Alan
Pollard and 6-10 sophomore Tom
Gneiting.
Card notes
The Athletic Department will hold
its drawing for 50 pairs of Super Bowl
tickets for Stanford students at the
tournament tomorrow night. Winners
of the drawing, to be held at halftime
of both games and between them, will
have the option of buying two tickets
for $60 each. Today is the last day to
register for the draw. Signups will be
held between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. at
the ticket booth on the south side of
Stanford Stadium.

Pacific game will be a battle of two
teams with more questions than most
final exams. Seven of Pacific's 11
players are new to the program this
year. Stanford also has lots of new
faces after losing four of its top five
players and more than 70 percent of
its offense from last year's 19-12
squad.
Below is a team-by-team rundown
of the tournament in order of
tonight's games.
Stanford (1-0)
The Cardinal enters the tourna

ment undefeated hut untested. Stan
ford beat the University of California
at San Diego, 87-48, in its season
opener last Saturday but still left a lot
of questions unanswered, especially
how it will play in a close game.
Davis is hoping that question won't
be answered tonight. And unless
Pacific plays well and Stanford plays
poorly, or a combination of both, it
won't. Davis, however, remembers
well Stanford's opening-round game
last year against San Jose State, when
the Cardinal might have looked
ahead to North Carolina and almost
lost.
Davis will start the same lineup he
used against UCSD — Keith Ramee
and Novian Whitsitt at guard, Andy
Fischer and Earl Koberlein at for
ward, and Kent Seymour at center.
Everyone is healthy except guard
John Paye, who suffered a chest con
tusion last Friday and missed two
days of practice this week. Paye is
listed as probable for the tournament.
No matter what happens tonight,
Stanford will be tested tomorrow
against either La Salle or BYU.
Pacific (0-1)
Tigers Coach Tom O'Neill said,
"We feel we have improved ourselves
as a basketball team." But after last
year's 3-27 season, Pacific could do
nothing but improve.
O'Neill hit the recruiting trail early
and hard in an attempt to quickly
resurrect a Pacific program that
recently was a West Coast power.

"We feel we have recruited well, and
we feel our players are getting the
confidence to play at the Division I
college level," he said.
The Tigers opened the season with
a 73-61 loss at Portland University
last Saturday, but O'Neill said their
biggest problem was a lack of experi
ence, not talent.
Pacific matches up evenly with
Stanford in both height and experi
ence, or lack thereof. Sophomore
Brent Counts, the son of former pro
fessional star Mel Counts, is 6-9 and
starts at center, 6-8 junior Andy
Franklin and 6-6 freshman Domingo
Rosario (from the Dominican
Republic) at forward, and 6-5 junior
Drew Rogers and 6-0 sophomore
Kyle Pepple at guard.
At yesterday's pre-tournament
press conference at a local Chinese
restaurant, O'Neill said his fortune
cookie read, "You will play a host
team in a tournament and the officials
will be from [its] conference. Good
luck."
La Salle (1-1)
The Explorers were billed as the
pre-tournament favorite early this
week, but that was before they
ventured to St. Mary's University in
Moraga Wednesday night. La Salle
lost, 69-59.
Ervin, who spoke after O'Neill at
the press conference, also read his
fortune: "You will have the same
three officials this weekend as you
had last night." St. Mary's shot 36

free throws in the game. Fordham
shot nine.
When La Salle was down 37-21
early in the second half, Lewis and
Black got hot and they cut the deficit
to 41-39 in a matter of minutes. Then
the pair that look — and play — alike
got cold, and La Salle fell behind
again and lost.
The Explorers still would probably
walk away with the tournament title if
they had the services of 6-9, 215-
pound senior center Albert "Truck"
Butts. Butts, 24, was declared in
eligible last week by an obscure rule
penalizing a player a year of eligibility
if he plays past his 20th birthday in
high school. La Salle attempted to get
a 10-day injunction allowing Butts to
play until the NCAA reviews his case
next week, but the judge said no.
Hence, La Salle has no Butts for
the tournament and, if the St. Mary's
game was any indication, no
rebounding, either.
Brigham Young (0-0)
The Cougars thought losing Devin
Durrant, the NCAA's third-leading
scorer last season with a 27.9-points
per-game average, was bad enough.
Then the 1984-85 season began.
Four returning players accepted
Mormon mission calls, instantly end
ing their seasons before they began.
"And then," BYU Sports Informa
tion Director Dave Schulthess said,
"we started to get things like ankle
sprains." Then Sinek, the top retur
nee, got a knee in his back at a

practice and cracked a few ribs. And
then 7-2 center Carl Pollard also ac
cepted a mission call.
"It's just been a season of adversity
for Ladell (Anderson)," Schulthess
said. "He doesn't have much hair to
lose, either. Now we say we have
three teams at BYU — one on the
basketball court, one on the mission
field and one in the hospital."
Sinek is listed as questionable for
the tournament, but it's questionable
on the doubtful side. Without Sinek,
the Cougars are inexperienced, with
only two other seniors, but tall, with
seven players at least 6-6.
If Sinek does not play, Anderson is
expected to start 6-1 senior Marty
Perry, 6-5 junior Richie Webb, 6-6
senior Timo Saarelainen (who red
shirted last year to play on Finland's
Olympic team), 6-9 freshman Alan
Pollard and 6-10 sophomore Tom
Gneiting.
Card notes
The Athletic Department will hold
its drawing for 50 pairs of Super Bowl
tickets for Stanford students at the
tournament tomorrow night. Winners
of the drawing, to be held at halftime
of both games and between them, will
have the option of buying two tickets
for $60 each. Today is the last day to
register for the draw. Signups will be
held between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. at
the ticket booth on the south side of
Stanford Stadium.
There's one problem with the setup
of this weekend's Apple Invitational
Basketball Tournament as far as the
Stanford basketball team is con
cerned. Win or lose its first-round

game tonight, the Cardinal will have a
tougher one tomorrow night.
Stanford opens the fourth-annual
December tournament — the first
sponsored by Apple Computers, Inc.
— against the University of the
Pacific tonight at 7. The winner ad

vances to tomorrow night's champi
onship game at 9 against either I.a
Salle University (of Philadelphia) or
Brigham Young University. And the
loser plays either La Salle or Brigham
Young in the consolation game at 7
p.m.
"1 think fans are going to be
pleasantly surprised with the talent
they will see on the floor in.La Salle
and BYU," Stanford Coach Tom
Davis said. Neither team carries the
name of, say, a University of North
Carolina, the winner of last year's
tournament. But both teams have tal
ent comparable to, say, a North
Carolina, and both teams went to
postseason tournaments last year
like, say, a North Carolina.
"When you recruit a player from
Philly, and most of L.a Salle's players
are from there, those kids know how
to play." Davis said. "And BYU's
known for always having fine
players."
The La Salle Explorers' Ralph
Lewis and Steve Black, known in
Philadelphia as the Lewis and Black
Expedition, are both being "pushed
for national honors," according to La
Salle Coach Dave "Lefty" Ervin.
And BYU Coach Ladell Anderson
calls Scott Sinek "the best defensive
guard in the country."
The tournament, which was spon
sored by Hewlett Packard last year,
has traditionally had an East Coast
flavor. Host Stanford, which has been
in all three championship games, won
the tournament in 1982 by beating
Temple University, 77-70. The Uni
versity of Pennsylvania beat the
Cardinal, 71-63, in 1981 and North
Carolina won, 88-75, last year.
"1 think we have a decent tourna
ment going here," Davis said, "and


Rod Searcey/Daily
Point guard Keith Ramee will try to help the Cardinal bypass UOP and
get into tomorrow night's Apple Invitational championship game.
we have a very good field this year."
It might also be one of the most
balanced fields with the possible ex
ception of Pacific, which is coming off
a 3-27 season. On paper, La Salle and
Brigham Young are better than Stan
ford, but both are missing key players
and won't be playing at full strength
this weekend. And both will be
playing before the recently raucous
crowds in Maples Pavilion, which
probably will be sold out both nights.
If anything, the BYU-La Salle
game at 9 p.m. will match two known
quantities. Both were 20-11 last
season and went to postseason tour
naments, BYU to the National Col
legiate Athletic Association tourney
and La Salle to the National Invita
tional Tournament.

Ervin, who spoke after O'Neill at
the press conference, also read his
fortune: "You will have the same
three officials this weekend as you
had last night." St. Mary's shot 36

free throws in the game. Fordham
shot nine.
When La Salle was down 37-21
early in the second half, Lewis and
Black got hot and they cut the deficit
to 41-39 in a matter of minutes. Then
the pair that look — and play — alike
got cold, and La Salle fell behind
again and lost.
The Explorers still would probably
walk away with the tournament title if
they had the services of 6-9, 215-
pound senior center Albert "Truck"
Butts. Butts, 24, was declared in
eligible last week by an obscure rule
penalizing a player a year of eligibility
if he plays past his 20th birthday in
high school. La Salle attempted to get
a 10-day injunction allowing Butts to
play until the NCAA reviews his case
next week, but the judge said no.
Hence, La Salle has no Butts for
the tournament and, if the St. Mary's
game was any indication, no
rebounding, either.
Brigham Young (0-0)
The Cougars thought losing Devin
Durrant, the NCAA's third-leading
scorer last season with a 27.9-points
per-game average, was bad enough.
Then the 1984-85 season began.
Four returning players accepted
Mormon mission calls, instantly end
ing their seasons before they began.
"And then," BYU Sports Informa
tion Director Dave Schulthess said,
"we started to get things like ankle
sprains." Then Sinek, the top retur
nee, got a knee in his back at a

practice and cracked a few ribs. And
then 7-2 center Carl Pollard also ac
cepted a mission call.
"It's just been a season of adversity
for Ladell (Anderson)," Schulthess
said. "He doesn't have much hair to
lose, either. Now we say we have
three teams at BYU — one on the
basketball court, one on the mission
field and one in the hospital."
Sinek is listed as questionable for
the tournament, but it's questionable
on the doubtful side. Without Sinek,
the Cougars are inexperienced, with
only two other seniors, but tall, with
seven players at least 6-6.
If Sinek does not play, Anderson is
expected to start 6-1 senior Marty
Perry, 6-5 junior Richie Webb, 6-6
senior Timo Saarelainen (who red
shirted last year to play on Finland's
Olympic team), 6-9 freshman Alan
Pollard and 6-10 sophomore Tom
Gneiting.
Card notes
The Athletic Department will hold
its drawing for 50 pairs of Super Bowl
tickets for Stanford students at the
tournament tomorrow night. Winners
of the drawing, to be held at halftime
of both games and between them, will
have the option of buying two tickets
for $60 each. Today is the last day to
register for the draw. Signups will be
held between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. at
the ticket booth on the south side of
Stanford Stadium.
There's one problem with the setup
of this weekend's Apple Invitational
Basketball Tournament as far as the
Stanford basketball team is con
cerned. Win or lose its first-round

game tonight, the Cardinal will have a
tougher one tomorrow night.
Stanford opens the fourth-annual
December tournament — the first
sponsored by Apple Computers, Inc.
— against the University of the
Pacific tonight at 7. The winner ad

vances to tomorrow night's champi
onship game at 9 against either I.a
Salle University (of Philadelphia) or
Brigham Young University. And the
loser plays either La Salle or Brigham
Young in the consolation game at 7
p.m.
"1 think fans are going to be
pleasantly surprised with the talent
they will see on the floor in.La Salle
and BYU," Stanford Coach Tom
Davis said. Neither team carries the
name of, say, a University of North
Carolina, the winner of last year's
tournament. But both teams have tal
ent comparable to, say, a North
Carolina, and both teams went to
postseason tournaments last year
like, say, a North Carolina.
"When you recruit a player from
Philly, and most of L.a Salle's players
are from there, those kids know how
to play." Davis said. "And BYU's
known for always having fine
players."
The La Salle Explorers' Ralph
Lewis and Steve Black, known in
Philadelphia as the Lewis and Black
Expedition, are both being "pushed
for national honors," according to La
Salle Coach Dave "Lefty" Ervin.
And BYU Coach Ladell Anderson
calls Scott Sinek "the best defensive
guard in the country."
The tournament, which was spon
sored by Hewlett Packard last year,
has traditionally had an East Coast
flavor. Host Stanford, which has been
in all three championship games, won
the tournament in 1982 by beating
Temple University, 77-70. The Uni
versity of Pennsylvania beat the
Cardinal, 71-63, in 1981 and North
Carolina won, 88-75, last year.
"1 think we have a decent tourna
ment going here," Davis said, "and

Point guard Keith Ramee will try to help the Cardinal bypass UOP and
get into tomorrow night's Apple Invitational championship game.
we have a very good field this year."
It might also be one of the most
balanced fields with the possible ex
ception of Pacific, which is coming off
a 3-27 season. On paper, La Salle and
Brigham Young are better than Stan
ford, but both are missing key players
and won't be playing at full strength
this weekend. And both will be
playing before the recently raucous
crowds in Maples Pavilion, which
probably will be sold out both nights.
If anything, the BYU-La Salle
game at 9 p.m. will match two known
quantities. Both were 20-11 last
season and went to postseason tour
naments, BYU to the National Col
legiate Athletic Association tourney
and La Salle to the National Invita
tional Tournament.
On the other hand, the Stanford-
Pacific game will be a battle of two
teams with more questions than most
final exams. Seven of Pacific's 11
players are new to the program this
year. Stanford also has lots of new
faces after losing four of its top five
players and more than 70 percent of
its offense from last year's 19-12
squad.
Below is a team-by-team rundown
of the tournament in order of
tonight's games.
Stanford (1-0)
The Cardinal enters the tourna

ment undefeated hut untested. Stan
ford beat the University of California
at San Diego, 87-48, in its season
opener last Saturday but still left a lot
of questions unanswered, especially
how it will play in a close game.
Davis is hoping that question won't
be answered tonight. And unless
Pacific plays well and Stanford plays
poorly, or a combination of both, it
won't. Davis, however, remembers
well Stanford's opening-round game
last year against San Jose State, when
the Cardinal might have looked
ahead to North Carolina and almost
lost.
Davis will start the same lineup he
used against UCSD — Keith Ramee
and Novian Whitsitt at guard, Andy
Fischer and Earl Koberlein at for
ward, and Kent Seymour at center.
Everyone is healthy except guard
John Paye, who suffered a chest con
tusion last Friday and missed two
days of practice this week. Paye is
listed as probable for the tournament.
No matter what happens tonight,
Stanford will be tested tomorrow
against either La Salle or BYU.
Pacific (0-1)
Tigers Coach Tom O'Neill said,
"We feel we have improved ourselves
as a basketball team." But after last
year's 3-27 season, Pacific could do
nothing but improve.
O'Neill hit the recruiting trail early
and hard in an attempt to quickly
resurrect a Pacific program that
recently was a West Coast power.

"We feel we have recruited well, and
we feel our players are getting the
confidence to play at the Division I
college level," he said.
The Tigers opened the season with
a 73-61 loss at Portland University
last Saturday, but O'Neill said their
biggest problem was a lack of experi
ence, not talent.
Pacific matches up evenly with
Stanford in both height and experi
ence, or lack thereof. Sophomore
Brent Counts, the son of former pro
fessional star Mel Counts, is 6-9 and
starts at center, 6-8 junior Andy
Franklin and 6-6 freshman Domingo
Rosario (from the Dominican
Republic) at forward, and 6-5 junior
Drew Rogers and 6-0 sophomore
Kyle Pepple at guard.
At yesterday's pre-tournament
press conference at a local Chinese
restaurant, O'Neill said his fortune
cookie read, "You will play a host
team in a tournament and the officials
will be from [its] conference. Good
luck."
La Salle (1-1)
The Explorers were billed as the
pre-tournament favorite early this
week, but that was before they
ventured to St. Mary's University in
Moraga Wednesday night. La Salle
lost, 69-59.
Ervin, who spoke after O'Neill at
the press conference, also read his
fortune: "You will have the same
three officials this weekend as you
had last night." St. Mary's shot 36

free throws in the game. Fordham
shot nine.
When La Salle was down 37-21
early in the second half, Lewis and

to 41-39 in a matter of minutes. Then
