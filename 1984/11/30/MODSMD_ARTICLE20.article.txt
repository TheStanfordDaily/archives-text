## Stanford, UOP to open Apple Invite 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
There's one problem with the setup
of this weekend's Apple Invitational
Basketball Tournament as far as the
Stanford basketball team is con
cerned. Win or lose its first-round

game tonight, the Cardinal will have a
tougher one tomorrow night.
Stanford opens the fourth-annual
December tournament — the first
sponsored by Apple Computers, Inc.
— against the University of the
Pacific tonight at 7. The winner ad

vances to tomorrow night's champi
onship game at 9 against either I.a
Salle University (of Philadelphia) or
Brigham Young University. And the
loser plays either La Salle or Brigham
Young in the consolation game at 7
p.m.
"1 think fans are going to be
pleasantly surprised with the talent
they will see on the floor in.La Salle
and BYU," Stanford Coach Tom
Davis said. Neither team carries the
name of, say, a University of North
Carolina, the winner of last year's
tournament. But both teams have tal
ent comparable to, say, a North
Carolina, and both teams went to
postseason tournaments last year
like, say, a North Carolina.
"When you recruit a player from
Philly, and most of L.a Salle's players
are from there, those kids know how
to play." Davis said. "And BYU's
known for always having fine
players."
The La Salle Explorers' Ralph
Lewis and Steve Black, known in
Philadelphia as the Lewis and Black
Expedition, are both being "pushed
for national honors," according to La
Salle Coach Dave "Lefty" Ervin.
And BYU Coach Ladell Anderson
calls Scott Sinek "the best defensive
guard in the country."
The tournament, which was spon
sored by Hewlett Packard last year,
has traditionally had an East Coast
flavor. Host Stanford, which has been
in all three championship games, won
the tournament in 1982 by beating
Temple University, 77-70. The Uni
versity of Pennsylvania beat the
Cardinal, 71-63, in 1981 and North
Carolina won, 88-75, last year.
"1 think we have a decent tourna
ment going here," Davis said, "and
