# Sorry, no Hobbie this season
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
Remember Jerry Hobbie?
He was the guy who scored 21
points in Fordham University's vic
tory in the consolation game of last
year's Stanford basketball tourna
ment. The guy who was 13-for-13
from the free-throw line and was
named to the All-Tournament
team. The scrappy-looking guy
with slicked-back hair and an unor
thodox left-handed, off-the-hip set
shot.
Hobbie was the guy the Stanford
student section literally adopted,
shouting "Hobbie, Hobbie," and
"Transfer, Transfer," while bowing
to him when he accepted his All-
Tourney award. The guy who inad
vertently walked in front of the stu
dent section at halftime of the
championship game and was
swamped with requests for
autographs and one last unortho
dox set shot. Hobbie obliged, sign
ing a few autographs and then step
ping onto the vacant Maples
Pavilion floor and hitting a 35-
footer on his second try. Then he
was carried off the floor on the
shoulders of some students.
"It's definitely been a conversa
tion piece," Hobbie, now in his
senior season at Fordham, said on
the phone yesterday. "Everybody
who's heard of me has heard of me
because of that. It's almost like my
claim to fame."
That's probably because
newspapers, magazines, and televi
sion and radio stations across the

country picked up the Hobbie
story. Sports Illustrated was one ot
the first to report about the Stan
ford students' love at first sight, and
coined Hobbie "The Cabbage
Patch kid."
Fordham is 1-1 this season attei
losing to North Carolina by 15
points in its opener, then beating
Lone Island University by 11 I ues

day night. And Hobbie, a 6-foot-2,
170-pound point guard, started
both games and, as he said, "played
pretty well."
Hobbie scored 20 points against
North Carolina, including 16 in the
first half when he did not miss a
shot or a free throw. "1 was reallv

hot in the first half," he said
"But I didn't have much chance
to shoot in the second. They
played a trapping zone."
Against Long Island, Hobbie
had 12 points and 13 assists
bringing his two-game assist
total to 20.
Hobbie said he has a few
connections with La Salle Uni
versity's team, the favorite to
win the Apple Invitational.
Hobbie played with La Salle
stars Steve Black and Albert
Butts at Fredericks Military
Academy on what was one of
the top prep teams in the na
tion in 1981. Hobbie also was
the player that beat La Salle
last year with a 25-foot jumper
at the buzzer for the Metro At
lantic Athletic Conference
championship.
Hobbie will get a chance to
play in front of West Coast
crowds for the first time since
last December's Stanford
tournament early this January
when Fordham plays at Pep
perdine University and Long
Beach State University. And
it's rumored that groups of
Stanford students home for
quarter break will attend the
games to cheer on their hero.
Asked if he had any
messages for the Stanford stu
dents, Hobbie said, "Just tell
everyone hello. Maybe some
day I'll be able to get out there
(to Stanford) again. We'll be
playing Pepperdine and Long
Beach State around New
Year's. Maybe I could leave
tickets (at the door) or some
thing.
"And thanks a lot again for
all the support."
