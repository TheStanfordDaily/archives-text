# Sorry, no Hobbie this season

### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
Remember Jerry Hobbie?
He was the guy who scored 21
points in Fordham University's vic
tory in the consolation game of last
year's Stanford basketball tourna
ment. The guy who was 13-for-13
from the free-throw line and was
named to the All-Tournament
team. The scrappy-looking guy
with slicked-back hair and an unor
thodox left-handed, off-the-hip set

Hobbie was the guy the Stanford
student section literally adopted,
shouting "Hobbie, Hobbie," and
"Transfer, Transfer," while bowing
to him when he accepted his All-

championship game and was
swamped with requests for
autographs and one last unortho

was carried off the floor on the
shoulders of some students.

senior season at Fordham, said on
the phone yesterday. "Everybody
who's heard of me has heard of me
because of that. It's almost like my
claim to fame."
That's probably because
newspapers, magazines, and televi
sion and radio stations across the

country picked up the Hobbie
story. Sports Illustrated was one ot
the first to report about the Stan
ford students' love at first sight, and
coined Hobbie "The Cabbage
Patch kid."
Fordham is 1-1 this season attei
losing to North Carolina by 15
points in its opener, then beating
Lone Island University by 11 I ues

day night. And Hobbie, a 6-foot-2,
170-pound point guard, started
both games and, as he said, "played
pretty well."
Hobbie scored 20 points against
North Carolina, including 16 in the
first half when he did not miss a

Pavilion crowd.
