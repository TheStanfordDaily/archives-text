# Women's basketball squad to play Waves
## 
### JOHN LIS Daily staff 
Coming off a 75-52 victory over San Jose State Univer
sity Tuesday, the Stanford women s basketball team goes
lor its third straight triumph today at Maples Pavilion
against Pepperdine University.
The Waves come into Maples with only eight healthy
players and have not shown much depth. Against UCLA
earlier this season, they lost, 77-47, and two players,
junior forwards Maureen Formorico and Shawn Sturgeon!
combined for 35 of those 47 points.
"We re going to try to pick up the tempo," Cardinal
Head Coach Dotty McCrea said. "We'll run and see if
they have enough gas to stay with us till the end."
Part of Stanford s game plan will be to avoid a letdown
after the victory Tuesday that McCrea called "one of the
best wins I've had here." McCrea said yesterday, "If we
have the heart and emotion we had against San Jose, we'll
beat them.
"We've had two pretty good days of practice. They (the
players) see when they play like that (Tuesday's game),
they get results."

Today, the Cardinal will also have the services of guard
Virginia Sourlis, who missed the San Jose State game with
a hyperextended knee. With her knee heavily taped,
Sourlis practiced yesterday for the first time since injuring
it last Friday at the University of California at Santa Bar
bara.
"It feels fine," Sourlis said after practice yesterday.
"I'm going to play. The doctor said the ligaments and car
tilage are fine. It's just a matter of time."
McCrea said she didn't know whether Sourlis would
start tonight. "I'm going to take 24 hours to decide who's
starting tomorrow," she said after yesterday's practice.
The Cardinal will also be hoping for increased scoring
from forward Mary Bradach. Bradach averaged more
than 12 points per game last season but has yet to score in
double figures in four games.
Bradach chose not to dwell on her performance this
season. "We have so many other people playing well," she
said. "It's a good feeling that when someone goes under
for a while, someone else can step in and take her place."
Today's game starts at 4:30 p.m. at Maples.
