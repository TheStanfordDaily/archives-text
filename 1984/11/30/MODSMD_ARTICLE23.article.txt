# Fencing teams facing tough Spartan team

### JASON COLE Daily staff 
The Stanford men's and women's fencing teams will face pos
sibly their toughest competition of the season today when they
host San Jose State University.
Both Stanford teams go into the meet with 2-0 records, but
Coach Buzz Hurst said that is not an indicator of how the match
will go. "This is the type of meet that we never know what's
going to happen," he said. "Over the past couple of years, the
teams have been so evenly matched, it (the result) depends on
who is up for it."
Hurst's greatest worry is that the Cardinal will become too
tense for the matches. "It's so easy to get uptight with a big
match like this. It's easy to get nervous," he said. "I'm just going
to try to keep them unwound."
The men's team might have an advantage over the Spartans
because it is slightly more experienced, according to Hurst.
"Basically, Mike D'Asaro (the San Jose State coach) has pretty
much the same team he had last year, and I basically have a
stronger team than I had last year," he said.
Last season, San Jose State and Stanford split two regular
season meetings. The Spartans won the first, 14-13, and the
Cardinal took the second 16-11. In the Western Regionals,
however, Stanford finished first, ahead of San Jose State. But
Hurst quickly added that, because of D'Asaro's coaching ability,

"I'd be worried about San Jose State even if they were all on
crutches."
San Jose State's best event will be the foil, where it is led by
senior Dean Hinton, who finished 16th in the nation and was the
Western Regional champion last season.
Hinton will be matched against Stanford's finest fencer, junior
co-captain Elliot Cheu. Hinton and Cheu split their two 1983
regular-season meetings, but Hinton beat Cheu in the regionals.
Hurst expects the teams to have a close match. "The way it
checks out to me is, I don't see either team winning by more than
a 16-11 score. It could very likely be 14-13," he said.
"To be honest, I think [we're] stronger in the other two events
(sabre and epee). It's probably a push (tie) in the foil, but we're
slightly stronger otherwise."
Stanford's top performers, besides Cheu, have been the other
two captains, senior Chris McConnell and junior Andy Goorno.
McConnel is in the epee and Goorno is in the sabre.
Two weeks ago, the Cardinal men's team had trouble with the
University of California at Santa Cruz, winning 14-13. Hurst said
he anticipated a tough match and said the Cardinal had won the
match early and might have let up a little at the end.
For the women's team, the situation is very similar. Stanford
and San Jose State are evenly matched but not for the same
reasons, according to Hurst. "We are probably pretty even again
because we both lost about the same number of veterans," he
said.

This match might be even closer than the men's match, accord
ing to Hurst. Since it is possible to tie the number of bouts won,
the tie-breaker would be the total number of touches by each
team. "I would call this one very close, it could come down to
touches," Hurst said.
The mental factor might also loom even greater in the
women's match. "It's particulary important on the women's side.
The San Jose State women have dominated the region and the
nation (they won the national championship five times in a row)
for so long that teams tend to get scared against them," Hurst
said.
Despite the fact that the Cardinal swept San Jose State twice
last season and won the Western Regional championship. Hurst
doesn't think that will help his team. "We're the regional
champs, and last year was the first time we had ever beaten them,
but we're still a little bit scared when we see San Jose uniforms,"
he said.
The match will also feature one of the top individual matches
in the country when Stanford's Jennifer Yu takes on San Jose
State's Katie Coombs. Both are juniors, but Yu was the regional
champion last season.
In order to win, Yu must be patient, Hurst said. "Basically she
can't rush things. Sometimes she tries to go for the kill too soon,
and Katie is good enough to defend against it,"he said.
The San Jose State-Stanford match begins at 4 p.m. at Roble
Gym.
