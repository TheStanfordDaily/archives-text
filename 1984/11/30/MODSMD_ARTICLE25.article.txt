# Swimmers here, in LA this weekend

I he Stanford men's swimming
team will split this weekend â€” half
the team will compete in the Stanford
Invitational today through Sunday
and the other half will travel to the
University of Southern California for
the Pacific 10 Conference Invita
tional tomorrow and Sunday.
The women's swimming team
will also he competing in the Stanford
Invitational, although Cardinal swim
mers will only be swimming in pre
liminary heats.
Approximately 60 men's club and
college teams will be competing in the
Stanford Invitational at DeGuerre
Pool. According to Stanford Coach
Skip kenney, his entire squad will not
be attending the Pac-10 meet because
of classes and a need for study time.
Coach George Haines, the
women's swimming coach, has
similiar reasons for not wanting his
swimmers to swim in the finals of the
invitational.
"Our women will only be swim
ming in the preliminaries, with a few
exceptions," Haines said. "A few of
our swimmers will compete in the
finals on Sunday, but the majority
will not. They just have too much
work to do at this time of the quar
ter."
IJSC, the University of Arizona,
UCLA, the University of California
at Berkeley and Stanford will be com
peting in the Pac-10 Invitational.
Kenney said the meet is important
because it is the first meeting of the
nation's top collegiate swimmers,
many of them 1984 Olympians.
"The meet will be held in the
Olympic pool and will give us a good
chance to get some NCAA (National
Collegiate Athletic Association) time
standards," Kenney said. "Swimming
in that pool against such top-notch

swimmers should really give our team
some extra motivation."
Swimmers competing in the Pac-10
meet include Olympic medalists Matt
Biondi from Cal and Pablo Morales, a
Stanford sophomore.
Kenney expects Morales, a gold

medalist on the 4xloo-meter medley
relay team, to swim well this
weekend.
"Pablo is coming out of the water
polo season after swimming almost
nothing but sprints, and I'll be
looking for him to be swimming very

fast," Kenney said.
Morales will be swimming in the
100 butterfly and freestyle, and the
200 individual medley.
Another Cardinal swimmer ex
pected to swim well for Stanford is
senior captain Dave Bottom, a back

stroker. Bottom currently holds the
Stanford record in the 100 hack
stroke with a time of 48.30 seconds.
Sophomore Jeff Kostoff, a member of
the 1984 Olympic team, should be a
stronghold for the Cardinal in the
freestyle distance events.


Cardinal men's swimming Coach Skip Kenney has large expectations
for 1984 Olympic swimmer Pablo Morales (above), who will compete
in the 100-meter butterfly and freestyle races and the 200 individual

loss Geiduschek/Daily file
medley. Kenney said Morales' play on the Stanford water polo team
helped keep the swimmer in shape. Part of the Stanford swim team will
swim in Los Angeles this weekend while the rest will compete here.
