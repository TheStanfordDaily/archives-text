## Restauranteur discovers secret recipe to success 
### CATHY JANUS 
Alouette French Restaurant
401 Lytton Ave.
Palo Alto
327-4187
Tucked away on the corner of Lyt
ton Avenue and Waverly Street is a
small French restaurant. No bright
neon sign identifies it. Rather, its
name is painted on the large window
fronting the street and outside is a
table with a candle and the menu.
Opening the door, one enters the
foyer combination restaurant with its
eleven tables. Seating is limited,
making each group feel very special,
as if it were one of the select cho
sen to enjoy Alouette for the evening.
The small size is part of the charm of
this cozy, warm restaurant decorated
with various tasteful pieces of wood
furnishings and trinkets. You'll im
mediately feel at home and com
fortable when the maitre d' or owner
herself addresses you with a simple
French greeting as she seats you.
Everything seems properly French
without being stuffy, and it is.
The owner of L'Alouette is a native
of Versailles, France where she
learned to cook in school. While
living in France she taught French,
and it was only upon emigrating to the
United States that she entered the res
taurant business. After 10 years at
Le Pot au Feu in Menlo Park, she
decided to buy out the owners of

L'Alouette. Since then, she has
earned a reputation of high regard
from her customers who guarantee
her such a steady clientele that one is
required to make reservations on
weekend evenings.
Everything is cooked on the
premises, from the pates to the
pastries. The menu is constantly
evolving and changing, depending on
the cook's mood and what fresh in
gredients she can get.
The "menu du jour" featured three
choices of appetizers: escargots de
Bougogne ($3.50), French onion
soup gratinee ($4.00) and mousse
pate or country pate ($3.50). I asked
our most proficient waiter, who
doubles as the maitre d', what the dif
ference in the two pates was and
learned that mousse is creamier and
the country pate is more coarse and
spicy. Always out to please my taste
buds, I ordered the country pate. I
was very pleased with my decision
once I tasted it. Sometimes pate is
prepared with fatty pork or has been
kept in a refrigerator and the chilled
taste lingers. This evening I could not
fault the rich, spicy taste. French
bread and butter were also served.
Entrees include beef, fish, fowl and
veal. All dinners are served with soup
and salad, and that evening there
were a number of tempting items, all
with long French names and even

longer translations.
I heartily recommend that French
classes make luncheon reservations at
L'Alouette. Hours are Tuesday
through Friday from 11:00 a.m. to
1:30 p.m. and dinner is served Tuesday
through Saturday beginning at 5:30
p.m. The hostess is happy to speak in
French with her customers and there
couldn't be a more enjoyable or con
ducive atmosphere to learn in. Except
perhaps France itself.
Prices for the entrees ranged from
$11.50 for rabbit to $13.50 for sal
mon. One of the house specialties is
leg of lamb roasted with herbs. Finely
sliced and very tender, it is cooked to
perfection. According to our hostess,
many people have never experienced
the true taste of lamb because there is
a tendency to overcook it. For the
more daring gourmet, veal
sweetbreads are also prepared. That
evening the choice of fish was salmon
or baked swordfish.
Finally, the dishes are cleared
away, and it is time for dessert. At
L'Alouette how can one say no to a
fresh home-made napoleon, a slice of
apple or pear tart or other sweets?
Served with coffee, tea or a cold bev
erage, dessert is an enjoyable way to
prolong a cozy evening in the candle
lit charm of L'Alouette.

or baked swordfish.
Finally, the dishes are cleared
away, and it is time for dessert. At
L'Alouette how can one say no to a
fresh home-made napoleon, a slice of
apple or pear tart or other sweets?
Served with coffee, tea or a cold bev
erage, dessert is an enjoyable way to
prolong a cozy evening in the candle
lit charm of L'Alouette.
