A good French restaurant offers
more than fine French cuisine. It
should surround you with an am
biance rich enough in small detail
to transport you into another world
for the evening. Whether it evokes
the sidewalk cafe of Paris or the
formal elegance of Maxim's, its suc
cess rests in the choice of decor and
the style of service that create these
moods. Le Pot au Feu has these
elements but lacks a coherent
theme. It is at once insouciant and
elegant. You are not handed the
evening on a platter. You must
choose it yourself from the wealth
of detail.
Located on El Camino Real in
Menlo Park, Le Pot au Feu is easily
lost among the storefronts. Parking
directly in front of the restaurant
poses no problem on a weeknight,
but on a busier night you should ex
pect a short stroll from your car.
Don't be surprised if no one
greets you as you walk through the
door. The restaurant is small, and
the host is around somewhere. You
just have to catch his attention. But
his enthusiasm makes up for any
delay. As he seats you, he opens
your linen napkin with a flourish
and wishes you a hearty "bon ap
petit." You may experience a mo
ment of deja vu when you settle
back into your chair, which is a
Coffee House replica. The table for
four is crowded, so be sure to go
with friends.
High ceilings add space to an
otherwise small restaurant. Its two
rooms hold many tables without in
spiring claustrophobia. We dined at
Le Pot au Feu on a Tuesday night
and most of the tables were empty.
Add another fifty people chewing
and chatting, and the restaurant
would have quite another feel.
The interior decorator has bro
ken up the space in the restaurant
so as to create different moods in
different areas and a feeling of
privacy in each. One area, raised
off the floor on a platform deck,
represents a sidewalk cafe complete
with Cinzano umbrellas. Windows
painted high on the wall behind it
add to the effect. In constrast, the
remaining areas place you in what

feels much like someone's private
dining room. Kitchen utensils deco
rate some walls, and fine engrav
ings hang from others. A mirrored
dresser completes the atmosphere.
But what place does a plastic
tablecloth have in the midst of
homestyle elegance, you may ask.
Its blue and white checkered pat
tern is deceptively French, but its
texture belongs in the American
diner. We understand the conveni
ence of the wipe-clean tabletop but
would have hoped to find here an
appreciation of impractical finery.
For example, the candle lamp and
the homestyle silverware add a nice
touch.
The fast and friendly service at
Le Pot au Feu is a treat. A basket of
baguettes complete with salted but
ter appeared on the table within
moments. Throughout the meal,
you can expect continual attention
without pressure from the person
able waitresses and waiters.
The wine list is extensive, with
prices ranging from $6 to $30. But
if you aren't in the mood for wine,
your choice of beverage is limited.
Heaven forbid you should ask for a
soft drink. Le Pot au Feu serves
only Perrier, iced tea, milk and
water.
The menu is divided into two sec
tions — specialties and daily spe
cials. There is a nice selection of
hors d'oevres ranging in price from
$3.75 to $4.75. We chose fresh
mussels in garlic-butter sauce and a
Brie-filled pastry. Both are excel
lent, especially the cheese ap
petizer. The flaky pastry shell en
hances the melted Brie.
The soup du jour and salad,
which come with all entrees,
quickly follow the appetizers. Our
soup, a creamy blend of vegetables,
arrived steaming hot. It had a
pleasant taste but would benefit
from larger pieces of vegetables
and a more subtle blend of spices.
The fresh Romaine lettuce topped
with a flavorful house dressing is a
nice change from the standard
Iceberg-lettuce salad.
Give yourself a moment to enjoy
the French music and to glance
about the restaurant while you wait
for the entrees. Le Pot au Feu is ob
viously not a student hangout. It
draws its clientele from the business
community instead.

Our entrees arrived hot and at
tractively arranged. The portions
are generous and are comple
mented by a variety of side dishes,
of which the ratatouille is especially
pleasing. The meat in each entree is
top quality and cooked to perfec
tion.
The Boeuf Wellington ($l4 75)
is a thick filet mignon in a flaky
pastry crust. A savory sauce en
hances the flavor of the meat. The
Grilled Brochette ($12.75), on the
other hand, loses its flavor in a
profusion of herbs and spices. This
is particularly disappointing be
cause the beef is tender and other
wise delicious. Sorry to say, the
Stuffed Salmon suffers the same
malady. Served in a flaky, fish
shaped pastry shell, it is an attrac
tive dish, but a confusing blend of
herbs undermines its flavor. The
four of us agreed that the Duckling
in Apple Cider is by far the best of
the dishes we tasted. The tender
meat slides easily from the bones.
And the sauce? Forget the ad
jectives. Just lick your lips to get
every drop.
When you finish the entrees you
will have eaten enough to last you a
week, but it's worth saving room
for the dessert. Our waitress of
fered us a choice of cream puffs,
chocolate mousse, or chocolate and
raspberry cake, all $3.
The cake could be more moist,
but it should please any chocolate
lover. The mousse has a rich,
smooth flavor, although it is slightly
airy. And the cream puff, a
welcome alternative to the choco
late choices, gets an interesting
twist from the almond flavoring in
the cream.
Le Pot au Feu is the experience
that you make of it. If you're
looking for elegance, the elements
are all there — fine food, charming
atmosphere, excellent service and a
bill to prove it. But if the carefree
pleasure of the cafe suits your style,
you don't need to worry about
which fork to use. Just slip your
tennis shoes under the table and
enjoy yourself.
Le Pot au Feu serves dinner from
6 to 10 p.m. and is closed Sunday
and Monday. Reservations are ac
cepted for parties larger than five.
