# Crepes, ice cream at new University Ave. hangout
## 
### MARGARET SCHNEIDER 
Copenhagen Cones and Crepes
386 University Ave.
Palo Alto
327-3476
Its time to tune up your tastebuds
to try the latest addition to our wealth
of ice cream alternatives. Copen
hagen Cones and Crepes has its grand
opening this Saturday night at 7, and
it might just be that new hangout
you've been waiting for. As the name
advertises, this informal eatery serves
both crepes and Danish-style ice
cream cones. The Danish touch is
really in the thick, crispy, wafer-like
cones made freshly on the premises.
Plain, dipped in chocolate or dipped
in chocolate and nuts, the cones are
much more than just a container for
your ice cream. What goes inside the
cone is equally satisfying, and
chocaholics should note that they
carry Tres Chocolate ice cream,
which uses as its base a rich cocoa
syrup, rather than just cocoa powder.
On the lighter side, the Irish Coffee
makes you wonder why they ever
serve it hot, and you should definitely
taste some of the other flavors before
you make your final decision.
Remember, though, that this is also
a creperie in the Brittany tradition
— with a California twist. The menu
changes daily to accommodate new in
spirations, but the general theme is to

stuff paper-thin crepes with interest
ing combinations of flavors. Take, for
example, The Californian. Naturally,
this one includes avocado, but it also
has mushrooms, tomatoes, onions
and sour cream. This would be a great
alternative to omelettes for anyone
who doesn't like eggs. Some items do
include meat, for the more car
nivorous types; The Copenhagen has
as its base Danish ham. All of these
tasty crepes are under $4.00, and
there is also a choice of quiches for
those who really do like eggs.
Crepes also appear on the dessert
menu, filled with ice cream and a va
riety of toppings: a truly unusual
sundae. These would go well with a
fresh cup of espresso coffee, and you
should feel very comfortable enjoying
each bite at your leisure. Copenhagen
Cones and Crepes (or The Cope, as it
may come to be known) has
combined mirrored walls with subtle
neon lighting and round cafe-style
tables to create a nicely relaxed atmo
sphere. The friendly staff is an extra
bonus; service is quick and low
pressured. So, don't write it off as
"just another ice cream parlor"; it's
not.
Hours are Monday through Friday
10 a.m. to 7 p.m., and weekends until
10 p.m.
