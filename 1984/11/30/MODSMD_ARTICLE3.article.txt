# Financial predictions include tuition hikes
## 
### JEANNE COOPER Senior staff writer 
Stanford's operating budget ex
penses for 1985-86 may reach $212
million, two million more than the
projected income, according to fig
ures from the University's financial
planning staff.
Addressing the Faculty Senate yes
terday afternoon, Provost James
Rosse presented a preliminary finan
cial forecast for the operating budget
through 1987-88 that includes steady
tuition increases, salary raises and a
drop in utility costs.
The financial planning staff hopes
to close next year's "budget gap"
through departmental budget cuts,

reductions in the consolidations and
improvements program, and transfer
of money from another area of the
overall budget, which will run close to
$650 million this year, Rosse said.
The projected long-range operat
ing costs do not include funding for
the Stanford Graduate School of
Business, the medical school or areas
in the Hoover Institution; support for
these will account for 21.7 percent of
this year's total estimated operating
budget of $247 million.
Rosse urged the senate to remem
ber the tentative nature of any
predictions. Calling the forecast a
"tool developed ... to permit us to
look, however inaccurately and

dimly, into the future to see how
we're doing." Rosse said the alloca
tions are "only implicitly a statement
of policy over the next few years but
not by any stretch of the imagination
firm."
Several of the estimated figures for
upcoming income and expenses
depend on the annual national infla
tion rate, predicted at 5 percent for
the next three academic years by
Stanford's economic consultants.
Tuition, which generally provides
about 50 percent of operating
income, could rise a total of 7.5 per
cent if the predicted inflation rate is
accurate.
Rosse explained that the additional
2.5 percent would help offset rising
faculty and staff salaries, which will
rise at a similar rate to tuition. "We're
largely a people-run enterprise," he
said, "and the salaries to attract the
people we want are determined by
markets outside our control that do
seem to increase real wages 2 percent
annually." This year's salaries should
total 49.5 percent of all operating
costs.
Rosse noted that although the Uni
versity takes tuition increases "very
seriously," Stanford is "doing as well
if not improving [its] ability to attract
top students" despite such hikes.
Stanford's current tuition charge of
$9,705 places it in mid-range with
those of other academically pres
tigious private institutions, led by
Harvard's $10,540, Rosse said.
The financial planners project total
returns on the endowment will rise
above inflation by 6.75 percent. If so,
5 percent will stay invested; of the
remainder, Rosse said only 4.75 per
cent will pay into the budget due to a
"persistent tendency for costs to in
crease 2 percent faster than infla
tion."
Nevertheless, Rosse observed the
University's "more aggressive invest
ment policy" is beginning to pay off,
since last year's total returns over in
flation came to only 5.8 percent.
Overall, endowment earnings could
provide about 25 percent of operat
ing income.
The University may also see an in
crease in indirect cost recovery from

government and industry contracts,
which could supply 27.5 percent of
this year's projected $198 million
operating income. Stanford recovers
building and management costs of
sponsored research from the federal
government under a program in
which the final sum is determined by
the amount of research and a return
rate negotiated with the government.
Stanford financial experts predict
the volume of research will increase
by 10 percent next year and expect
higher grant rates to contribute
surplus funds despite their projection
that the current return rate of 69 per
cent will remain the same. The next
two years should bring volume in
creases of 8.5 percent with rate in
creases of a few percentage points, al
though Rosse warned the senate that
these predictions are complicated and
risky.
On the expense side, financial aid
will grow to maintain the program.
Student aid accounts for 7.8 percent
of this year's projected operating
costs, the largest expenditure after
salaries and benefits. Utility costs
should drop next year, however, by 3
percent, and after two years of 3-
percent increases, should decrease
again when the University initiates its
energy co-generation plan.
New buildings may draw approxi
mately $1.9 million from the operat
ing budget next year to fund the con
struction of several science buildings
and accommodate unexpectedly high
utility costs for the Center for Inte
grated Systems, according to Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy.
Building costs will drop sharply in
1986-87, according to the forecast, to
about $441,000 before rising the next
year to an estimated $1.18 million.
Rosse pointed out that the new build
ings should increase the number of
research contracts, thus bringing in
more indirect recovery costs, al
though the "real costs" of the
structures should not be overlooked.

ing and "mortgages" from past proj
ects. may rise steadily by 1.5 to 1.6
percent over the next three years.
The 1985-K6 budget may allot $3
million alone to those areas and $2
million to academic computing.
By transferring funds brought by
increased graduate enrollment from a
"conditional budget" to the operating
budget, Stanford could trim $750,000
from the income/expenses gap, Rosse
said. Planners also hope to prune
$500,000 from consolidations and
improvements spending. Rosse said
the University will ask its department
heads to review their budgets care
fully in order to cut the remaining
$750,000, a suggestion not well
received by the senate.
"Stanford is a well-run financial in
stitution, but for 15 years we've been
making budget cuts," said Physics
Prof. Dirk Walecka, a 15-year Fac
ulty Senate observer. "Stanford is
perceived to be wealthy, but our de
partments are pared to the bone. It
seems to me we run on a marginal
level of academic financing."
In other Faculty Senate business,
Rosse announced the formation of a
search committee to find a new direc
tor for the Overseas Study Program.
Norm Wessells, dean of the School of

Humanities and Sciences, will chair
the group.
Wessells said the committee will
look for a director within Stanford,
giving preference to tenured faculty
members with extensive experience
in undergradute teaching and lang
uage capability other than English.
The committee will hold a national
search for someone to serve as ad
ministrative director under the aca
demic director.
Wessells said the academic direc
tor's desired qualities are "high intel
ligence, the capacity to deal with very
complicated problems that one may
not deal commonly with in one's aca
demic career, the ability to cope with
local mayors and universities, the
ability to work well with the very
complicated governing structure
within the University and the capacity
to inspire extraordinary performance
on the part of the staff, here and
overseas, from many different
cultures."
The academic director should
"have an idea of what overseas study
can become to serve a broader clien
tele," Wessells said. The minimum
appointment will be for three years,
with five as the optimum length, Wes
sells said, but the position is "open
ended to longevity." Academic
Council members in all areas includ
ing professional school faculty may
apply. The committee plans to com
plete its work in January.
