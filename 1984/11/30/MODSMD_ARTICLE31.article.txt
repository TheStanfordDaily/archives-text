## Czech artist/poet displays 3-D 'poetry' 
### AMY FRIEDMAN 
It seems appropriate for San Fran
cisco to host a show of 53 recent
works of Czech-born Jiri Kolar in the
same quarter that Jaroslav Seifert
received the Nobel prize in literature.
Kolar also began his creative en
deavors as a poet. Born in Bohemia
in 1914, he was influenced by the po
litical turmoil that formed the back
drop of his life. Czechoslovakia was
united as one nation and doomed to
control by others. In Kolar's words:
Fie was interested in giving his poetry
all "possible freedom and responsi
bility for itself." The manifesto,
"Parole in Liberta" by futurist
Filippo Marinetti, also had a
profound effect on the poet.
Marinetti espoused freeing poetry
from traditional verse and sentence
construction. Kolar wanted to
"release poetry from the strait-jacket
;of words," and "set it free."
The shape of Kolar's poetry, in a
,sense, de-evolved through
progressively fewer textual limita
[tions toward a form he calls "the
poetry of silence." These poems have
abandoned words, yet remain typed
on pages. The syntax is made
|up of punctuation marks, digits and
[spaces. Finally in complete liberation,
IKolar created his visual poems:
iThree-dimensional realization of his
poetry. "My work led me to the
[necessity of creating my own world
[just like Paul Klee, Joan Miro, Max
Ernst. . . . An inhabited paradise
[filled with creatures ... a paradise of
(the spirit, and a paradise of hell . . .

paradise of returning time and of all
languages . . . and a land of reality."
His artwork employs elements of
Dadaism and Surrealism. "L'Univers
dans une Assiette" (The Universe in
a Plate) at the Walton-Gilbert
Gallery is an example of a sculptural
"poem." It is a chiasmaged ball on a
chiasmaged plate. ("Chiasmage" is a
type of collage Kolar uses in almost
all his work. Tiny pieces of printed
matter are glued meticulously over a
surface.) Like Dada artwork Kolar is
having fun with these common ob
jects. But like the Surrealists, Kolar
intends a deeper meaning, an irony.
The chiasmage on the sphere is made
up of bits of astrological maps imply
ing that — maybe — the universe is in
our plate, at our mercy.
It is hard to resist trying to read and
understand' the little bits of type that
make up the chiasmages. The pattern
stands as an elegant, lacy back
ground; but I felt cheated when 1 dis
covered there was no significance to
the content of the snippets. The
chiasmage often seem washed out
against the white of the gallery walls.
In this environment the most effec
tive pieces are those with more color
and less background. "Vague de Fer"
(Wave of Iron) is a bold, car
"crumplage" (crumpled and glued
photo) on a tan background of braille
chiasmage. It speaks with confidence.
The pieces like the "ventillage"
(paper attached at only one point to
the board), "Venetian blind" (veil

like shreds of paper over a view of an
other image), and versions of "Melle
Riviere" stood out because of their
kinetic movement and depth.
"Melle Riviere" seems to follow
you around the gallery as she stares
from several different works.
"Riviere" is a rendition of "M idame
Riviere" by Ingres. Kolar ex/lains:
"The Surrealists knew what they
were doing when they evoked e. rlier
artists, referring metaphoricall_ to
the ways in which they were
'surrealists.' [The Surrealists] had
come to terms with the methods of
the great masters. And so in fact, they
too sought tradition."
Another example of Kolar's ex
perimentation with traditional art,
"Le Pomme Qui Chante" (The Sing
ing Apple) typifies the fastidious bal
ance and symmetry Kolar loves to
offset with touches of humor and the
surreal. One of the most witty

"poems" is "Anti-Collage" where
again he plays with earlier works. In
stead of laying things on top of one
another as in conventional collage.
Kolar strips away layers: In one panel
he removes the figures from the "Last
Supper" which is intact in the panel
below.
But Kolar's genius is only just un
covered in the show. The "poems"
are more subtle than some of his ear
lier works and fc,'- a first reading may
be difficult to grasp. To appreciate
the message of each of the "poems,"
,t is important to read the title, view
the work as a whole and then study
the phrases within it. Kolar points out
that his poems "themselves open up
the possibility to think differently, but
it is . . . through contemplation that
this enters our awareness." The
catalogs of his museum exhibits are
available at the gallery and testify to
the breadth and wit that arc not fully
explored in this collection. Just off
Union Square, the Walton-Gilbert
Gallery hosts Kolar's works through
the New Year.

it is . . . through contemplation that
this enters our awareness." The
catalogs of his museum exhibits are
available at the gallery and testify to
the breadth and wit that arc not fully
explored in this collection. Just off
Union Square, the Walton-Gilbert
Gallery hosts Kolar's works through
the New Year.
It seems appropriate for San Fran
cisco to host a show of 53 recent
works of Czech-born Jiri Kolar in the
same quarter that Jaroslav Seifert
received the Nobel prize in literature.
Kolar also began his creative en
deavors as a poet. Born in Bohemia
in 1914, he was influenced by the po
litical turmoil that formed the back
drop of his life. Czechoslovakia was
united as one nation and doomed to
control by others. In Kolar's words:
Fie was interested in giving his poetry
all "possible freedom and responsi
bility for itself." The manifesto,
"Parole in Liberta" by futurist
Filippo Marinetti, also had a
profound effect on the poet.
Marinetti espoused freeing poetry
from traditional verse and sentence
construction. Kolar wanted to
"release poetry from the strait-jacket
;of words," and "set it free."
The shape of Kolar's poetry, in a
,sense, de-evolved through
progressively fewer textual limita
[tions toward a form he calls "the
poetry of silence." These poems have
abandoned words, yet remain typed
on pages. The syntax is made
|up of punctuation marks, digits and
[spaces. Finally in complete liberation,
IKolar created his visual poems:
iThree-dimensional realization of his
poetry. "My work led me to the
[necessity of creating my own world
[just like Paul Klee, Joan Miro, Max
Ernst. . . . An inhabited paradise
[filled with creatures ... a paradise of
(the spirit, and a paradise of hell . . .

paradise of returning time and of all
languages . . . and a land of reality."
His artwork employs elements of
Dadaism and Surrealism. "L'Univers
dans une Assiette" (The Universe in
a Plate) at the Walton-Gilbert
Gallery is an example of a sculptural
"poem." It is a chiasmaged ball on a
chiasmaged plate. ("Chiasmage" is a
type of collage Kolar uses in almost
all his work. Tiny pieces of printed
matter are glued meticulously over a
surface.) Like Dada artwork Kolar is
having fun with these common ob
jects. But like the Surrealists, Kolar
intends a deeper meaning, an irony.
The chiasmage on the sphere is made
up of bits of astrological maps imply
ing that — maybe — the universe is in
our plate, at our mercy.
It is hard to resist trying to read and
understand' the little bits of type that
make up the chiasmages. The pattern
stands as an elegant, lacy back
ground; but I felt cheated when 1 dis
covered there was no significance to
the content of the snippets. The
chiasmage often seem washed out
against the white of the gallery walls.
In this environment the most effec
tive pieces are those with more color
and less background. "Vague de Fer"
(Wave of Iron) is a bold, car
"crumplage" (crumpled and glued
photo) on a tan background of braille
chiasmage. It speaks with confidence.
The pieces like the "ventillage"
(paper attached at only one point to
the board), "Venetian blind" (veil

like shreds of paper over a view of an
other image), and versions of "Melle
Riviere" stood out because of their
kinetic movement and depth.
"Melle Riviere" seems to follow
you around the gallery as she stares
from several different works.
"Riviere" is a rendition of "M idame
Riviere" by Ingres. Kolar ex/lains:
"The Surrealists knew what they
were doing when they evoked e. rlier
artists, referring metaphoricall_ to
the ways in which they were
'surrealists.' [The Surrealists] had
come to terms with the methods of
the great masters. And so in fact, they
too sought tradition."
Another example of Kolar's ex
perimentation with traditional art,
"Le Pomme Qui Chante" (The Sing
ing Apple) typifies the fastidious bal
ance and symmetry Kolar loves to
offset with touches of humor and the
surreal. One of the most witty

"poems" is "Anti-Collage" where
again he plays with earlier works. In
stead of laying things on top of one
another as in conventional collage.
Kolar strips away layers: In one panel
he removes the figures from the "Last
Supper" which is intact in the panel
below.
But Kolar's genius is only just un
covered in the show. The "poems"
are more subtle than some of his ear
lier works and fc,'- a first reading may
be difficult to grasp. To appreciate
the message of each of the "poems,"
,t is important to read the title, view
the work as a whole and then study
the phrases within it. Kolar points out
that his poems "themselves open up
the possibility to think differently, but
it is . . . through contemplation that
this enters our awareness." The
