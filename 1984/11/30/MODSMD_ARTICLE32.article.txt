# Company's 'Fool for Love' sensitive to Shepard vision
## 
### KARY ANTHOLIS 
The beautiful and destructive
power of intense emotional attach
ment has been a favorite thematic
focus for Sam Shepard. To love and
to despise are necessary complements
for him. In his vision there is no
middle ground. As the level of energy
in a relationship increases, so increase
the attracting and repelling forces be
tween the two individuals. In "Fool
for Love," Shepard explores these
forces as they are affected by circum
stances beyond the participants' con
scious control. Creating a sense of the
emotional tension in a relationship of
such intense energy is no small task.
The Company, a student group at
Stanford, is presenting a new produc
tion of the play, which is, on the
whole, adequate in rendering
Shepard's theme.
The play focuses on two lovers,
May (Polly Firestone) and Eddie
(Martin Bedoian) who rest on the
brink of estrangement. The opening
scene reveals that these two charac

ters can either love or despise each
other; there is no indifference. As the
lights go up, May and Eddie are in a
hotel room. May sits with her head in
her hands. Eddie nervously asks if he
can do anything for her. As he ap
proaches her, May grabs his legs.
Eddie suggests that he go outside to
get her something. May reacts
violently, and Eddie has to protect
himself from her punches. Without a
word, we get a sense of the inner ten
sion that drives May. Similarly,
Eddie straddles a line between cocki
ness and sensitivity.
Shepard gives this play much his
torical and psychological depth.
There is an old man (John Atthowe)
who occasionally appears like a ghost
in the hotel room. We learn that he is
father to both Eddie and May, and
only discovered their relationship
after they had become involved. The
old man exerts strong psychological
influence on Eddie, with whom he
claims to have made a "pact." This
pact takes two forms. Eddie defends

his father's bigamous actions, and he
repeats them.
The repetition is revealed as May
vents her jealousy of a woman
referred to as the Countess. Like his
father, Eddie has fallen in love with
two women. The defense takes place
in a scene with Martin (Jay Holland)
who has shown up to take May to the
movies. This scene is the most suc
cessful of the production. In it we see
Eddie's brutal cockiness transform
into sensitivity and affection as he
abandons the defense of his father,
and May resigns herself to her love
for Eddie. The scene begins with
Eddie telling his father's romantic
version of the story of the old man's
love for two women. As he tells it, we
see how life and experience enable
Eddie to dominate sheltered and
naive Martin. Later we get May's side
of the story. The actors seem to ac
curately render the emotional shifts
as May's story proves true.
Although the production is ulti
mately successful in creating an ade
quate image of the tension in the
hotel room, it is not without prob
lems. At times, Firestone and
Bedoian lose the sharp contrast be
tween attachment and repulsion.
Mostly this occurs during moments of
alienation when we should get some
sense that the characters are at odds,
and instead it seems that one of them
is actually indifferent.
Tony Kelly's direction also has
some problems. Characters too often
walk aimlessly about the room and
there are moments in the scenes be
tween Eddie and May where the
timing is off. Nevertheless, Kelly dis
plays sensitivity to Shepard's vision of
emotional attachment and that makes
the show worth seeing.
"Fool for Love" will play through
Saturday at 8 p.m. in Cubberley
Auditorium on the Stanford campus.
