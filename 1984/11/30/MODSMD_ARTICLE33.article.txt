# Ramones, Yanks rock the Keystone
## 
### JOHN PHILLIPS 
The Ramones are a band with con
flicting reputations. On the one hand,
there's the punk reputation. The
Ramones surfaced at the front of Amer
ican New Wave. Anarchistic punks
and thrashers are found in large num
bers at Ramones shows. Every album
cover, every publicity photograph
and every interview portrays tattered,
belligerent street toughs. Joey
Ramone (bandleader and vocalist)
even spent time in a hospital recover
ing from a beating given to him
during a barroom brawl.
On the other hand, there's the
reputation that the Ramones may be
a bit mean but not malevolent. Their

than a little mean but probably not
evil. Here are the facts:
• There are exactly four Ramones.
Joey sings. Johnny and Dec Dee play
guitar and bass. Ricky drums. The
tempo is somewhere between very
fast and very, very fast.
• I he four Ramones played thirty
four songs in seventy-two minutes.
Dee Dee introduced at least twenty
five of these songs by barking
" 1 -2-3-4!" at roughly the same speed
as the subsequent beat.
• Ihe audience consisted of
preppies, punks, preppies who
thought they were punks and punks
who would make great preppies.

Joey's recognizable, forgettable holler
confirmed that one doesn't relish the
Ramones for lyrical content (most
thought-provoking line: 'The KKK
took my baby away').

studio albums consist of essentially
raunchy chainsaw pop, but it is very
cleanly delivered. A lot of the raw
edge is removed in the production.
The songs don't venture to say a great
deal about America, society, injustice
or hate. Their mascot is Zippy the
Pinhead, and their motto is "Gabba
Gabba Hey!" The band even played
the good guys in a wonderfully ter
rible cult film ("Rock and Roll High
School").
So when Joey, Johnny, Dee Dee
and Ricky romped through the
Keystone Palo Alto Saturday night
along with a talented Bay Area
foursome called the Yanks, I had my
chance to find out where this New
York band stands. What I got was an
earful of wonderfully mindless, jump
up-and-down, turn-down-that-radio
junior-before-I-come-upstairs-and-
break-it rock and roll administered
by fatuous gentlemen who are more

Sweat was the concert's official bodily
function, and the official texture was
"leather 'n rivets."
• During the show eight punks
(and "punks") engaged in roughly
one dozen stage dives. Several of
these were particularly nasty — not
for the jumpers themselves, who in
variably landed comfortably atop a
pile of packed patrons, but for the pa
trons, who had no choice but to sub
mit to the helicoptering appendages
and steel-toed boots of the sociopath
ic tumblers. Two fights enlivened
the event further.
• And a roadie got hit in the
shoulder by a loogie.
Things got rolling at about 10:30
p.m. after the Yanks were intro
duced. This local foursome has
released two EPs, songs from which
have made radio station playlists.
Their sound is a lively one and well

varied within the confines of four-bar
guitar pop that bands like Cheap
Trick and Tom Petty have achieved
success with. Their sound reminds me
of a number of other groups, notably
the Greg Kihn Band, stirred up a bit
and with an extra teaspoon of
bravado thrown in. On the first track
of the respectable "Made in the
States" EP, the singer's voice
resembles that of Mike Peters of the
Alarm. And several songs during the

set were reminiscent of the "gentle
metal" that is found on The Clash's
"London Calling" (see "Spanish
Bombs").
The Yanks did well with the audi
ence which lay in wait for New York's
original punk band. There were no
"boos," no extended digits. The Yanks
are a first-rate, blue-collar rock band;
they play with grit and emotion. But
despite good recordings and a
refreshing live sound, their un

glamorous approach becomes a
liability. Sweeping success only very
rarely comes to bands like the Yanks,
the Michael Stanley Band, Wire
Train and the Iron City Houserock
ers. These groups exhibit elements of
other commercially successful bands
but lack the requisite gimmick. The
most triumphant bands, good and
bad, get to where they are by being
the first (Devo), the best
(Springsteen), the quirkiest (REM)

or the most eccentric (Twisted Sister
and every other heavy-metal hero).
But as long as members of the Yanks
are willing to pay their dues, there
will be a modest audience to enjoy
their efforts.
After the set change, out came the
headliners to answer my question.

his usual rose-tinted shades. His

rarely comes to bands like the Yanks,

last bathed, ba-dump-bump).

The Ramones are four adults who

They are not inclined to editorialize

like so many punk acts. Like their
mascot, their choice is to have fun.

The Ramones are a band with con
flicting reputations. On the one hand,
there's the punk reputation. The
Ramones surfaced at the front of Amer
ican New Wave. Anarchistic punks
and thrashers are found in large num
bers at Ramones shows. Every album
cover, every publicity photograph
and every interview portrays tattered,
belligerent street toughs. Joey
Ramone (bandleader and vocalist)
even spent time in a hospital recover
ing from a beating given to him
during a barroom brawl.
On the other hand, there's the
reputation that the Ramones may be
a bit mean but not malevolent. Their

than a little mean but probably not
evil. Here are the facts:
• There are exactly four Ramones.
Joey sings. Johnny and Dec Dee play
guitar and bass. Ricky drums. The
tempo is somewhere between very
fast and very, very fast.
• I he four Ramones played thirty
four songs in seventy-two minutes.
Dee Dee introduced at least twenty
five of these songs by barking
" 1 -2-3-4!" at roughly the same speed
as the subsequent beat.
• Ihe audience consisted of
preppies, punks, preppies who
thought they were punks and punks
who would make great preppies.

Joey's recognizable, forgettable holler
confirmed that one doesn't relish the
Ramones for lyrical content (most
thought-provoking line: 'The KKK
took my baby away').

studio albums consist of essentially
raunchy chainsaw pop, but it is very
cleanly delivered. A lot of the raw
edge is removed in the production.
The songs don't venture to say a great
deal about America, society, injustice
or hate. Their mascot is Zippy the
Pinhead, and their motto is "Gabba
Gabba Hey!" The band even played
the good guys in a wonderfully ter
rible cult film ("Rock and Roll High
School").
So when Joey, Johnny, Dee Dee
and Ricky romped through the
Keystone Palo Alto Saturday night
along with a talented Bay Area
foursome called the Yanks, I had my
chance to find out where this New
York band stands. What I got was an
earful of wonderfully mindless, jump
up-and-down, turn-down-that-radio
junior-before-I-come-upstairs-and-
break-it rock and roll administered
by fatuous gentlemen who are more

Sweat was the concert's official bodily
function, and the official texture was
"leather 'n rivets."
• During the show eight punks
(and "punks") engaged in roughly
one dozen stage dives. Several of
these were particularly nasty — not
for the jumpers themselves, who in
variably landed comfortably atop a
pile of packed patrons, but for the pa
trons, who had no choice but to sub
mit to the helicoptering appendages
and steel-toed boots of the sociopath
ic tumblers. Two fights enlivened
the event further.
• And a roadie got hit in the
shoulder by a loogie.
Things got rolling at about 10:30
p.m. after the Yanks were intro
duced. This local foursome has
released two EPs, songs from which
have made radio station playlists.
Their sound is a lively one and well

varied within the confines of four-bar
guitar pop that bands like Cheap
Trick and Tom Petty have achieved
success with. Their sound reminds me
of a number of other groups, notably
the Greg Kihn Band, stirred up a bit
and with an extra teaspoon of
bravado thrown in. On the first track
of the respectable "Made in the
States" EP, the singer's voice
resembles that of Mike Peters of the
Alarm. And several songs during the

set were reminiscent of the "gentle
metal" that is found on The Clash's
"London Calling" (see "Spanish
Bombs").
The Yanks did well with the audi
ence which lay in wait for New York's
original punk band. There were no
"boos," no extended digits. The Yanks
are a first-rate, blue-collar rock band;
they play with grit and emotion. But
despite good recordings and a
refreshing live sound, their un

glamorous approach becomes a
liability. Sweeping success only very
