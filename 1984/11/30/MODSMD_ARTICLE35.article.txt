Stop Making Sense (1984)
Park, MenJo Park
323-6181
Jonathan Demme's film of the
Talking Heads' appearance at the
Pantages Theatre in Hollywood in
December '83, contains a brilliant vir
tuoso performance by the lead
vocalist/songwriter David Byrne. No
rock performer since the young Mick
Jagger can have demonstrated such an

overwhelming combination of precisely
directed energy, razor wit and ver
satility. With his mongoose neck and
scarecrow body, his hair slicked back
except for a furtive patch that explodes
over one eye, he looks like a demented
Walker Evans figure, but everything he
does is funny. He never stops mocking
himself; he can be science-fiction hero
and villain, mutant, devil and evan
gelist, nerd and obsessive, and yet
remain the crown prince of nonsense, a

New-Wave Edward Lear. Demme's di
rection of the film is not merely a matter
of taste and tact; he constructs the
movie the way Byrne constructed the
concert, on a theatrical/cinematic
metaphor that peaks in the "stop
making sense" number, "Girlfriend Is
Better," when Byrne thrusts his mike in
front of a techie creeping around on
stage with a lighting instrument and
then points the mike at the camera — at
us. The other members of the band —

Jerrv Harrison, Chris Frantz, Tina
Weymouth, Benriie Worrell, Alex Weir,
Steve Scales, Ednah Holt and Lynn
Mabry — each demonstrate a distinc
tive personality. Byrne wrote most of
the songs, which have dry, sneaky word
game lyrics that bounce off each other
like billiard balls and veer off into unan
ticipated directions. An ecstatic movie,
superbly lit by Jordan Cronenweth
(adapting the stage lighting designed by
Byrne and Beverly Emmons).

The Turning Point
Kresge Auditorium
A civilized soaper set in the ballet
world of New York — bursting with
plot (by Arthur Laurents) but
eminently implausible and rather
foolish. Shirley MacLaine and Anne
Bancroft play long-time friends and
one-time rivals who meet again after
years of separation, when the dance
company both used to belong to, and
Bancroft still does, makes a tour stop in
the Midwestern city where MacLaine
live* with her family. She left the com
pany years ago to marry Tom Skerritt
and raise a family; now she has a chance
to return — vicariously, through her
talented daughter (Leslie Browne), who
is invited to come to New York and
train. Old wounds reopen; Bancroft
faces the end of her career; Browne has
her first affair (with Mikhail Barysh
nikov) and becomes a star — all in 119
minutes. The ballet sequences are
beautifully directed by Herbert Ross
and shot by Robert Surtees, but Shirley
MacLaine's crisp, down-to-earth per
formance and Tom Skerritt's deeply felt
small one make Anne Bancroft's grande
dame affectations look so overranged
that you come out thinking the Midwest
is a hell of a lot more reasonable than
New York.
Plays tonight at 9.
A Night at the Opera (1935)
Festival, Palo Alto
329-1848
The Marx Brothers moved from
Paramount to M-G-M with this movie;
they lost Zeppo but they gained the
dubious distinction of having Irving
Thalberg supervise the production. An

insistent culture vulture, he padded out
the great George Kaufman-Morrie Rys
kind script with musical interludes
(performed by Allan Jones and Kitty
Carlisle) that look like he culled them
from a touring production of "The Stu
dent Prince" playing nearby during the
shooting. The Marxes override this
preposterous intrusion, of course: "A
Nighi at the Opera" is a classic comedy.
Directed by Sam Wood, and co-starring
Margaret Dumont, Sig Rumann and
Walter Woolf King. The stateroom se

quence and the wreck of "II Trovatore"
at the end are sequences beyond
description.
Plays through Wednesday with "A
Day at the Races."
The Goto Rush (1925)
Bijou, Palo Alto
326-6196
Charles Chaplin's justly famous com
edy, in which he plays a prospector who
seeks his fortune in Alaska, with Mack
Swain as the villain and Georgia Hale as
the dance hall girl, as well as Tom Mur
ray, Henry Bergman, Malcolm Waite
and Betty Morrissey. The scene in
which Chaplin boils and eats his shoe is
one of the most remarkable (and deli
cate) examples of physical comedy ever
photographed.
Plays Sunday with "The Pawnshop,"
"The Floorwalker" and"The Rink."
Goklfinger (1964)
Memorial Auditorium
Perhaps the most enjoyable of the
James Bonds, this movie features two of
the best characters in the series: the
gold-painted corpse (Shirley Eaton)
and the Japanese villain Oddjob
(Harold Sakata), who uses his steel
rimmed bowler as a'lethal boomerang.
Sean Connery played Bond hen> for the
third time; audiences who have become
accustomed to Roger Moore will be
surprised to recall how vivid Bond used
to be. With Honor Blackman as Pussy
Galore, Gert Frobe, Bernard Lee, Lois
Maxwell, Desmond Llewellyn, and
Shirley Bassey singing the delightfully
silly title song by John Barry.
Plays Sunday at 7 and 9:30 p.m.

King Lear (1970)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Jan Kott's "Shakespeare Our Con
temporary" is one of the most vibrant
works of modern Shakespeare criticism,
but the productions it has inspired tend
to be both reductive and obsessive. In
this film, suggested by the essay "Lear
and 'Endgame,' " Peter Brook creates a
Beckettian setting for Shakespeare's
moat enormous play, and the results are
unimaginably grim and claustrophobic.
Paul Scofield gives his most unyielding

(and unpleasant) performance as Lear.
Jack MacGowran, as the Fool, provides
the film's only moments of relief (and
real feeling). With Irene Worth, Alan
Webb, Susan Engel, Patrick Magee,
Annelise Gabold, lan Hogg, Robert
Lloyd, Tom Fleming and Cyril Cusack.
Ways Monday.
Danton (1983)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Gerard Depardieu's Danton, the
French revolutionary leader whose last
days this film chronicles, is a sensualist
and a star — he knows he enjoys the
idolatry of the Parisians and he plays up
to them as well as playing hard-to-get
with them. He has the savvy of a
celebrity. Depardieu has said that he
used Muhammad Ali as a role model for
some of Danton's flourishes, and (as
usual) his instincts served him well:
Danton is a champion, even in defeat
(i.e., under the guillotine). The Polish
filmmaker Andrzej Wajda's film, writ
ten by Jean-Ctoide Carriere and others,
is a vigorous historical spectacle that
gives the constant impression of for
ward motion. Wajda's passionate sweep
and hts recognition of the farcical ele
ment embedded in any grand gesture
may not add up to great history, but
they are a welcome relief from the usual
cautious approach taken by the makers
of historical epics. The supporting cast
includes two of the luminaries of the
Parisian stage, directors Patrice
Chereau and Roger Planchon.
Plays Tuesday with "La Nuit de
Varennes."
