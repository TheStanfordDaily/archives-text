# Donation boxes placed throughout campus
## SVN begins charity drive 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
As Dead Week approaches and students' thoughts turn
to final exams and term papers, the Stanford Volunteer
Network is asking students to remember that it is also the
season of giving, especially the season for giving to those
less-fortunate members of the surrounding community.
According to Peter Spivack, head of the network, more
than 80 red donation boxes marked with the letters
"SVN" have been placed throughout campus in
residences, academic departments and other "high
visibility places." Green flyers promoting the drive have
also been posted on bulletin boards across the University.
Students, faculty and staff are asked to give "food,
clothing, toys and anything else" they no longer need or
use, Spivack said. He stressed the organization is "not col
lecting junk," but rather items that are "usable and in
good condition."
According to Melissa Auchard, Council-of-Presidents
member and director of the drive, the organization will
also collect Christmas trees from dorms and perishable
food from row houses when vacation begins.
The donations will be collected around Dec. 13 or 14,

Spivack said and turned ovei to the Ecumenical Hunger
Project and the Saint Vincent DePaul's Society. These or
ganizations will then distribute the items.
Spivack would not predict the number of students who
would make donations, although he noted that it would be
hard to expect students to give a large number of food
items. "How many students who live in Stern Hall will
have a can of chili to give? It's not that likely," he said.
Spivack said he hopes that students will give old clothes
or books they no longer use and that members of the fac
ulty and staff will donate more food items. Auchard said
there has been "a big push to get faculty and staff' in
volved in the area of food donations.
The drive is sponsored by the network in coordination
with nearly 10 other campus organizations that normally
have drives, including several fraternities and the Campus
Outreach Program, Spivack said. The network is also
hoping to get other service organizations to help with the
collection process.
Spivack, a member of last year's Council of Presidents,
said the ASSU sponsored a similar drive last year. This ef
fort is "a little bigger" in terms of the number of people
working and the number of boxes distributed, he said.
