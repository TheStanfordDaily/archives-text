The current U.S. policy that gives the president sole re
sponsibility to decide whether to use American nuclear
weapons in a war is not necessary, desirable or constitu
tional, Jeremy Stone told a sparse Kresge Auditorium au
dience last night.
Stone, director of the Federation of American Scien
tists, said that if nuclear weapons are never used first, then
the United States could go on indefinitely. If they are
used, a conflict will unavoidably escalate to a general nu
clear exchange.
Therefore, a point more important than the debate over
the proposed "Star Wars" system or over the proliferation
of weapons is who decides when to use them and how
broadly that responsibility is shared. Currently the re
sponsibility to decide whether to use American nuclear
weapons first in a conventional war, such as might result if
the Soviet Union invaded Western Europe, rests solely
with the president of the United States, Stone said.
It is not necessary to leave the decision up to the presi
dent alone because a conventional war is not lost in hours
or minutes, Stone said. "General Rodgers, supreme com
mander of NATO, says that the Soviets would have to
give at least two-days warning before any attack on West
ern Europe," simply by virtue of needing to mobilize their
troops.
In addition. Stone said, after an attack the war would be

fought conventionally for at least a few days, and notice
would have to be given to the nuclear command at
three to five days before the front lost cohesion.
Finally, the 15 countries constituting NATO all have i
right to vote on the first use of nuclear weapons, with spe
cial weight given to target countries, countries from which
weapons would be fired and countries that own the wur
heads or delivery systems involved.
Therefore, if this time were used effectively, 'he t:
would be more than enough opportunity to convene a
congressional committee without affecting response
flexibility or the conventional deterrent value of a first
use policy, Stone explained.
"This special committee could act for Congress to hold
or give first-use permission, and this additional procedural
requirement would have no adverse effect on flexible
response," Stone said. "If the president wants to use nu
clear weapons first, he must appeal to the committee
before he would have first-use authority "
The special committee is desirable because, according
to Stone, "In order for the president to be able to adv
ocate first use, he must persuade the committee of the
sensibility of the act. There are many personal and politi
cal reasons to advocate first use, including the fear of
being impeached after the conflict." It is, therefore, wrong
public policy to favor a system without review, even it it
were not unlawful.
