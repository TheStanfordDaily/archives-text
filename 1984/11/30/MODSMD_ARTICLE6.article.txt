New EPA head nominated
WASHINGTON — Lee Thomas, a career bureaucrat hand-picked
nearly two years ago to rescue the "superfund" toxic waste cleanup pro
gram from political scandal, was nominated yesterday by President
Reagan to replace William Ruckelshaus as head of the Environmental
Protection Agency.
Environmentalists and legislators, calling Thomas a "forceful and able
administrator," applauded the move. Sen. Robert Stafford (R-Vt.),
chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee,
predicted that Thomas would be quickly confirmed by the Senate when
Congress convenes in late January.
But some White House critics expressed concern that Thomas, who is
little known, lacks the clout to resist rumored budget cuts in the EPA's
controversial anti-pollution programs. One such critic, Rep. James
Florio, (D-N.J.), charged yesterday that a White House plan to
"drastically slash" the EPA's fiscal 1986 budget triggered Ruckelshaus'
sudden resignation, announced Wednesday.
But Ruckelshaus, who departs Jan. 5, denied the charge in several
network television interviews. He said Wednesday that he was leaving
because the job of rebuilding the agency's staff and morale was com
plete. And according to a knowledgable source who requested
anonymity, the only major cuts earmarked for the EPA's 1986 budget
are for sewer construction programs that have been widely attacked as
"pork barrel" projects.
Transplant patient recovering
LOUISVILLE, Ky. — William Schroeder took what he called "the
Coors cure" yesterday, getting out of bed for the first time to sit in a
chair and sip the can of beer he had asked for after waking up with a me
chanical heart in his chest.
Doctors and nurses who helped Schroeder walk from his bed to the
chair applauded when he sat down, said Robert Irvine, a spokesman for
the Humana Heart Institute International.
"This is a snack. My milkshake is the meal," said Schroeder, who was
in "absolutely great" condition, according to his increasingly confident
doctors.
"The progress he's made in the last 24 hours is amazing," said Dr. Al
lan Lansing, chairman of the heart institute, in a morning news briefing.
Feinstein meets with labor leaders
SAN FRANCISCO — Labor leaders met with Mayor Dianne
Feinstein yesterday in hopes of hastening a settlement in the nearly
three-month-long restaurant workers' strike.
Feinstein agreed to seek an informational meeting with representa
tives of the restaurants' owners. She also expressed optimism that the
strike against 37 eating establishments soon may be resolved, said Bill
Strawn, a spokesman for the mayor.
"She told the group she had been contacted by (mediator) Sam Kagel
early this morning, who reported substantial progress in the all-night
meeting," said Strawn. "She feels very optimistic that a resolution of the
strike will be attained in the near future."
Barbara Lewis, spokeswoman for Local 2 of the Hotel and Restaurant
Employees and Bartenders Union, said some progress was made in the
18-hour negotiating session that ended at 4 a.m. yesterday.
"It is definitely a good and positive step in the right direction and we
feel good about that," Lewis said. "There are still issues that need to be
discussed. It is by no means over."
Progress made in 2 murder cases
SAN FRANCISCO — Famed chef Masataka Kobayashi was killed
"at the hands of another" and his death will be considered a homicide,
authorities said yesterday.
The San Francisco coronor's office said Kobayashi died of "mulitiple
tramatic injuries at the hands of another." Homicide Inspector Frank
Falzon would not release specific details, saying only that two small
wounds found on the back of Kobayashi's head "contributed to the
coroner's findings."
The owner of Masa's, an exclusive 16-table restaurant, was found
dead Nov. 13 in his blood-splattered Nob Hill apartment. He was last
seen alive early on Nov. 11, after closing his restaurant.
An autopsy initially failed to find a cause of death. Police first spec
ulated that the celebrated chef had been shot, but the coroner found no
evidence of gunshot wounds and said the wounds on the back of the vic
tim's head did not appear serious enough to cause his death.
In another police investigation in Daly City yesterday, one man was
arrested and murder warrants were being sought for three Taiwanese
nationals, reputed members of the international "Bamboo Gang," in the
slaying of a journalist, authorities said.
Henry Liu, 52, a political writer for the Chinese-language San Fran
cisco Journal who had openly criticized Taiwan President Chiang Ching
kuo, was gunned down Oct. 15 in his garage in this community just south
of San Francisco.
David Yu, 28, was arrested in San Gabriel on Tuesday after a lengthy
investigation identified him as the driver of a car allegedly used in the
shooting attack on Liu, according to a joint statement by the FBI and the
Daly City Police Department.
Murder warrants were being sought through the San Mateo County
District Attorney's office for three men who authorities believe fled to
Taiwan after the killing, said Robert Gast 11, FBI agent in charge in San
Francisco.
Gulf nations to set up joint force
KUWAIT — Saudi Arabia and five of its Persian Gulf neighbors
agreed yesterday to establish a two-brigade rapid deployment force to
help protect the region's immense oil reserves, the Gulf News Agency
said.
The leaders of the six countries also approved a resolution calling for
the "ultimate unification" of their 160,000-man defense forces with a
joint high command, the Bahrain-based news agency said. Sources said
the command's headquarters would probably be in Saudi Arabia.
Their action came on the last day of a three-day summit of the Gulf
Cooperation Council, a body made up of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bah
rain, the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Oatar. The council made no
mention of the military resolutions in its closing statement.
King's daughter arrested at protest
WASHINGTON — As the widow of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
looked on, the daughter of the slain civil-rights leader and two other per
sons were arrested yesterday during the ongoing demonstration at the
South African Embassy to protest that country's apartheid policy of ra
cial separation.
Coretta Scott King, saying she, too, is prepared to go to jail to help op
pressed blacks in South Africa, watched as her daughter Yolanda King,
along with Gerald McEntee, international president of the American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and the first
white protester to be arrested, and Richard Hatcher, the mayor of Gary,
Ind., were handcuffed and placed into waiting police vehicles, bringing
to 13 the number of persons arrested in the nine-day-old demonstration.
"Not too long ago, a struggle started in Montgomery," King's widow
said, referring to the U.S. civil-rights movement. "We stand today, al
most 29 years later, in solidarity with our brothers and sisters in South
Africa . . . who are languishing under the worst and most inhumane con
ditions of human servitude."
Stocks continue retreat
NEW YORK — Stocks retreated sharply for the second consecutive
session yesterday, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average below
1,200.
Computer and aerospace issues were hit particularly hard. Chemical,
drug and financial stocks also fell.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slumped 11.93 to 1,193.46,
lifting its loss so far this week to 26.84 points.
Today's weather
Mostly cloudy today with light rain likely early this afternoon. Highs in
the mid 50s to low 60s.
