# Reagan losing support on the Hill
## Nicaraguan covert aid criticized 
### 
WASHINGTON — The likely new chairman of
the Senate Intelligence Committee fired a crisp
early-warning shot at the White House yesterday,
saying he will oppose renewal of covert U.S. aid to
rebels fighting the leftist government of Nicaragua.
Such resistance from Sen. David Durenberger
(R-Minn.) would further dim the already uncertain
prospects of the program, which the administration
wants to continue but which the Democratic House
has rejected three times. Congress has not voted
funds for the program since May.
Durenberger said judicious use of covert activity
is necessary to national security but that Nicaragua
is a political problem that cannot be solved through
covert activity.
Durenberger s remarks are one of several indica
tions that the new Congress may bring fundamental
changes in congressional regulation of the CIA, the
National Security Agency and the rest of the U.S.
intelligence network.
Durenberger is to replace Sen. Barry Goldwater
(R-Ariz.), who generally supported the administra
tion position on intelligence matters despite oc
casional tough potshots such as his opposition to
mining Nicaraguan harbors. Sen. Patrick Leahy
(D-Vt.), an administration critic, is to replace Sen.

Daniel Moynihan (D-N.Y.) as ranking minority
member.
Reagan generally is losing backers and garnering
opponents in other Hill changes affecting foreign
operations. Rep. Jack Edwards (R-Ala.), ranking
member of the appropriations defense subcommit
tee, is retiring. Rep. Lee Hamilton (D-Ind.), long a
Reagan critic, is to become chairman of the House
Intelligence Committee, and Rep. David Obey (D-
Wis.), a vocal critic, is to head the appropriations
foreign operations subcommittee.
A special Senate committee on reorganization
yesterday recommended that the House and Senate
intelligence committees be combined into one joint
committee.
It also recommended that the eight-year limit for
senators' terms on the intelligence committee be
extended to 10 years, a shift that would allow nine
members scheduled to leave to remain on the com
mittee. Among those is Sen. John Chafee (R-R.1.),
who then would become chairman instead of
Durenberger.
But Durenberger said he opposes both changes
and indicated he will have the support of incoming
Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-Kan.)
when the issues come up in January. "I have talked

to Dole. He does respect my judgment,"
Durenberger said. "The likelihood of
[Republicans] trying to reform ourselves is dim to
zip."
Durenberger's comments coincided with another
announcement pertaining to Central America that
came out of Washington.
Officials said yesterday the United States has
agreed to consider a massive aid request from Hon
duras, its main military ally in Central America,
despite the State Department's initial skepticism
over whether the request was warranted.
Honduran and U.S. aides said representatives of
the two nations, during two days of meetings in
Washington, agreed to set up a joint commission on
military and economic aid at Honduras' request.
And the chief of staff of Honduras' armed forces,
implying that continued military cooperation could
depend on the outcome of the talks, said his
country was willing to host a permanent U.S. mili
tary base and to re-admit Salvadoran soldiers to a
Honduran training facility if the United States in
creases aid sufficientlv.
