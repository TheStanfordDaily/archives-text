# President requests austere budget

WASHINGTON — President
Reagan instructed his advisers yester
day to draft an extremely austere
federal budget that would hold gov
ernment spending next year to this
year's level, according to White
House officials.
Reagan's plan, which would
produce the most severe cutback in
federal programs in modern times,
would require the elimination of
many programs, officials said. But
sources cautioned that it was only a

"tentative" decision that could be
reversed before Reagan's fiscal 1986
budget is submitted to Congress early
next year.
White House officials, who
declined to be identified, said the
president ordered his advisers to
return today with a budget that would
return to the current year's spending
level. The administration's latest
public estimate in July showed $930
hillion in «n e nding in fiscal 1985,

which began Oct. 1, but that estimate
has been creeping up toward $1 tril
lion in recent months.
David Stockman, Reagan's budget
director, had presented Reagan with
a budget that would apparently leave
spending at about $980 billion. Even
that would represent a reduction of
about $40 billion from the adminis
tration's estimate of the cost of main
taining current government program
levels in 1986.

Although Reagan's austerity
budget would hold next year's spend
ing at current levels, it differs signifi
cantly from an across-the-board
budget "freeze" being proposed by
members of Congress. The congres
sional proposal would trim or block
the growth of each program equally
without eliminating any entire pro
gram.
