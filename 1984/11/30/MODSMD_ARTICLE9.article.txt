# Treasury's tax plan under fire
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Sen. Bob Packwood (R-
Ore.), incoming chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, said yesterday he opposes any major
tax legislation next year, especially the tax
simplification plan being considered by the White
House.
"I sort of like the tax code the way it is," Pack
wood said in an interview.
Packwood was the latest and most influential op
ponent to speak out against the tax-simplification
plan advanced by Treasury Secretary Donald
Regan.
The president has stayed somewhat aloof from

the plan, and there were indications yesterday that
the White House wants to approach the tax
simplification issue as it did the Social Security
problem in 1982 and 1983, with bipartisan negotia
tion, although not with a formal commission as it
did with Social Security.
The Treasury proposal would replace the current
tax system with a simplified approach involving
three tax rates ranging from 15 percent to 35 per
cent. It would do away with many current
preferences and deductions such as the deduction
for state and local income taxes.
The Treasury proposal was also under fire in
Washington yesterday from charitable and non

profit groups, who said one aspect of the plan —
the elimination of tax deductions for contributions
to charity that total less than 2 percent of an indi
vidual's gross income — would discourage private
gift-giving and create a gap in services that the
federal government could have to fill.
"To eliminate the charitable tax deductions to
the extent proposed would be an unmitigated na
tional disaster," Lee Cobb, vice president for fund
raising for the U.S. UNICEF Committee, warned
in an interview this week.
