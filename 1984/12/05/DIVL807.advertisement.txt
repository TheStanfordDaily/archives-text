At Olivetti, we're committed to maintaining our leadership in the development of technologically advanced software.
We've achieved worldwide recognition through sponsorship of academic research, participation in joint projects with
universities, development of EEC-funded projects, and finally, through a commitment to our own research centers in Italy
and Northern California.
In keeping with this commitment, we are expanding our Artificial Intelligence Labs to include a team of software engineers
working out of Olivetti's Advanced Technology Center in Cupertino. We invite you to join this highly motivated group and
play a key role in an environment that rewards initiative and orginial thinking. In addition to the advantages of working
within Silicon Valley, you '11 be in constant touch with our headquarters in Italy (thanks to our geographic network of UNIX
machines) where we're already working with development environments for AI, expert systems and text understanding.
If you possess a BS, MS or Ph.D in Computer Science, with coursework and thesis or industry experience in AI system
development, we would like to talk with you about the following positions. Guru-level expertise, self-reliance and fluency in
Prolog or Smalltalk would also be desirable.
The first position will involve the design of an expert system, which will serve as the first of a family of products for
intelligent CAI application. Emphasis will be placed on heuristic reasoning, non-monotonic logics and fuzzy logic, as well
as the representation of inexact knowledge in general.
The second position will involve evaluating existing tools used to design expert systems, as well as analyzing knowledge
representation methods, inference engines and programming facilities of packages on the market. As a participant in our
project to build an in-house Knowledge Management System, you will also be responsible for designing new features.
Along with the excitement of working in a truly state-of-the-art field, we offer you the support of our international $2.4
billion corporation. We'll also offer a very competitive salary and a benefits package that includes 4 weeks paid time off.
Please send your resume to Professional Employment, Department 59, Olivetti Advanced Technology Center, 10430 South
De Anza Blvd., Cupertino, CA 95014. We are an equal opportunity employer.
