PHYSICS
SUMMER
COURSES
This summer the Physics Dept.
is offering:
PHYSICS 51
PHYSICS 53/54
Also:
PHYSICS 21/22
PHYSICS 23/24
In summer these courses are offered in an intensive
format, so it is possible to complete either group in
10 weeks! (See the Summer Bulletin for specifics.)
Don't keep this a secret; tell your friends so they
can benefit from this arrangement too.
