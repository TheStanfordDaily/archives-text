# DUs face inquiry
## Res Ed cites flooding, 'arrogant' behavior 
### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Staff writer 
Director of the Row Diana Conklin requested Monday
that the Interfraternity Council conduct an investigation
"into the behavior and governance" of Stanford's Delta
Upsilon fraternity.
The request, in a letter to IFC President Rick Hoskins,
followed a Saturday night DU party at which a broken
water pipe flooded the fraternity's 553 Mayfield Ave.
house, causing an estimated $10,000 damage.
Conklin called the behavior of DU members "arrogant,
inconsiderate, and intolerable" in her letter to Hoskins.
She asked that the IFC take into consideration past events
involving the fraternity.
Hoskins said the IFC plans to determine today "the
measures that need to be taken immediately" and will
then study the fraternity's behavior problems more
thoroughly. "Our investigation will deal with the entire
history of the DUs," he said.
DU President Mike Minchin said a third-floor water
pipe broke at 11:30 p.m. Saturday during a closed frater
nity party. Two DU members entered a third-floor room
to have a pull-up contest, Minchin said. The pipe, which
was part of the fire-suppression system, was stripped out
of the wall when one of the DU members grabbed hold of
it, he said. Water gushed out of the pipe at a rapid rate
due to the high pressure of the system.
The change in pressure within the sprinkler system acti
vated the fire alarm, and the DUs then evacuated the
house, Minchin said. "The fire department commended us
on the organized fashion in which we left the house," he
said.

When Minchin and DU Vice President Rob Blum
realized the house was not safe, they said they made al
ternative housing arrangements for the members. Cur
rently, everyone has a place to stay, according to Phil Hal
perin, DU facilities manager. The Beta Theta Psi and Phi
Delta Theta fraternities have taken in some stranded
DUs, Halperin said.
Fire marshals judged the house habitable yesterday,
after continuous work on it since Saturday night. House
members will be able to move back in around noon today.
They were not allowed to return until the fire alarm and
electrical systems were activated.
"The real drag is that it's Dead Week," Halperin said.
Residential Education and the IFC are taking this mat
ter very seriously, according to Hoskins and Norm Robin
son, dean of Res Ed.
"You can't have people behaving in this manner," Rob
inson said. "It is the latest in a series of incidents and all
part of a continuous history."
"Either the DUs or someone within the DU house are
in some very serious trouble," said James Lyons, dean of
Student Affairs. "There are a lot of students in the Uni
versity both with or without housing who would like to
live in that location . .. who would not do any damage."
Lucy Williams, an assistant at Housing Facilities, wrote
a three-page memo describing the damages to the house,
which is included in Conklin's letter to Hoskins.
The most expensive damage is to smoke detectors and
fire alarms, which will have to be replaced, Williams said.
The fire-sprinkler line was broken on the third floor and


Members of the Delta Upsilon fraternity are not only up to their ankles in water trouble, but they may be up
to their pocketbooks in trouble with the Office of Residential Education. Diana Conklin, director of the
Row, yesterday called for an investigation of the fraternity in a letter to its president.
there was extensive flood damage to
the alarm system, she said. Several
inches of water had flooded the base
ment, first and second floors. Light
fixtures and beams were also filled
with water, she said. Tho carpets on
the second and third floors, as well as
on the two staircases, are now in need
of repair.
The room directly beneath the pipe
lost some plaster off its ceiling.
Minchin and Blum said they do not
believe the plaster damage is that
serious. But Williams said that a two
foot by three-foot section of plaster
fell down and the entire ceiling will
have to be replaced.
Williams also reported several
hundred dollars' worth of damage
that is not necessarily related to the
party or flood. She found broken win

dows and furniture.
"I was disappointed that the house
was in that kind of shape," she said.
Conklin reported that when police
entered the house Saturday night
they "found mattresses stacked on
the stairway and, in the basement, a
floor flooded by beer and water, a
hole that appeared to be being used
for vomiting, and beer dripping from
overhead rafters."
One room has been declared uni
nhabitable, but the rest of the house
is structurally sound, Minchin and
Blum said Row Facilities officials told
them.
"The damage could have been a lot
worse if the water had not been
cleaned up that quickly," Minchin
said. Row Facilities officials, DU
members and different University
groups worked throughout the night
removing the carpet, thereby mini
mizing the damage to the floor.
"We moved quickly to protect
people's belongings," Minchin said.

They were able to put tarps over most
things, he said.
The DUs are taking financial re
sponsibility for the damages, al
though they have not yet discussed
financing with the University.
"It certainly is their responsibility,"
Robinson said, calling a DU reim
bursement "necessary but not suffici
ent. It is not exusable to say that they
can do this if they are willing to pay
for it."
Res Ed and the DUs are still dis
cussing the consequences of the da
mages. Neither Minchin nor Blum
sees any future problems with
keeping the house.
"It was a freak accident," Minchin
said.
Conklin said she prefers to work
through the IFC rather than the Uni
versity, if possible, since the IFC is
the legitimate representative body of
the fraternity system here. She said
she views the incident as a culmina
tion of behavior problems.

"This last incident brings us to the
point where we have to say, 'This is
enough,' " Conklin said. "We are
saying, now, 'Enough. You have to
demonstrate that you are able and
willing to govern yourselves respon
sibly.' "
"I want each person of the house to
understand the situation in a way that
is convincing, that shows they can and
will govern themselves if they remain
on campus," she said.
"1 worded the letter very strongly,
because I want the DUs to under
stand how seriously we are taking the
events in their house over the past
couple of years."
Hoskins said he felt it was
"unfortunate" the DU incident oc
curred now. "The DUs have done
well this year in taking responsibility
for their house," he said.
The DUs met yesterday afternoon
in Tresidder and, "realizing the
serious consequences that could have
developed from the accident" they

placed the two members involved in
the incident on probation, Minchin
said.
"The house has also agreed upon
several serious measures to prevent
any such event from occurring in the
future," Minchin said. "These
measures will be presented to the IFC
tomorrow night at their meeting."
"It is just an unfortunate accident
that occurred. I don't believe that it
should jeopardize the stature of the
DUs or the fraternity system at all,
because we are coming up with these
positions," he said.
"The students are making a bigger
issue on campus than it really is be
cause they haven't seen it in print,"
Blum said.
"I don't see it as something that
reflects over the whole fraternity sys
tem," Lyons said.
Robinson said the DU misbehavior
is "not helpful," to the fraternity sys
tem.
