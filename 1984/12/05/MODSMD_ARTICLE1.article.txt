# DUs face inquiry
## Res Ed cites flooding, 'arrogant' behavior 
### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Staff writer 
Director of the Row Diana Conklin requested Monday
that the Interfraternity Council conduct an investigation
"into the behavior and governance" of Stanford's Delta
Upsilon fraternity.
The request, in a letter to IFC President Rick Hoskins,
followed a Saturday night DU party at which a broken
water pipe flooded the fraternity's 553 Mayfield Ave.
house, causing an estimated $10,000 damage.
Conklin called the behavior of DU members "arrogant,
inconsiderate, and intolerable" in her letter to Hoskins.
She asked that the IFC take into consideration past events
involving the fraternity.
Hoskins said the IFC plans to determine today "the
measures that need to be taken immediately" and will
then study the fraternity's behavior problems more
thoroughly. "Our investigation will deal with the entire
history of the DUs," he said.
DU President Mike Minchin said a third-floor water
pipe broke at 11:30 p.m. Saturday during a closed frater
nity party. Two DU members entered a third-floor room
to have a pull-up contest, Minchin said. The pipe, which
was part of the fire-suppression system, was stripped out
of the wall when one of the DU members grabbed hold of
it, he said. Water gushed out of the pipe at a rapid rate
due to the high pressure of the system.
The change in pressure within the sprinkler system acti
vated the fire alarm, and the DUs then evacuated the
house, Minchin said. "The fire department commended us
on the organized fashion in which we left the house," he
said.

When Minchin and DU Vice President Rob Blum
realized the house was not safe, they said they made al
ternative housing arrangements for the members. Cur
rently, everyone has a place to stay, according to Phil Hal
perin, DU facilities manager. The Beta Theta Psi and Phi
Delta Theta fraternities have taken in some stranded
DUs, Halperin said.
Fire marshals judged the house habitable yesterday,
after continuous work on it since Saturday night. House
members will be able to move back in around noon today.
They were not allowed to return until the fire alarm and
electrical systems were activated.
"The real drag is that it's Dead Week," Halperin said.
Residential Education and the IFC are taking this mat
ter very seriously, according to Hoskins and Norm Robin
son, dean of Res Ed.
"You can't have people behaving in this manner," Rob
inson said. "It is the latest in a series of incidents and all
part of a continuous history."
"Either the DUs or someone within the DU house are
in some very serious trouble," said James Lyons, dean of
Student Affairs. "There are a lot of students in the Uni
versity both with or without housing who would like to
live in that location . .. who would not do any damage."
Lucy Williams, an assistant at Housing Facilities, wrote
a three-page memo describing the damages to the house,
which is included in Conklin's letter to Hoskins.
The most expensive damage is to smoke detectors and
fire alarms, which will have to be replaced, Williams said.
The fire-sprinkler line was broken on the third floor and


Members of the Delta Upsilon fraternity are not only up to their ankles in water trouble, but they may be up
to their pocketbooks in trouble with the Office of Residential Education. Diana Conklin, director of the
Row, yesterday called for an investigation of the fraternity in a letter to its president.
