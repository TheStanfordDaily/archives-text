# Accord in S.F. restaurant strike
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO — Exhausted negotiators,
following a 14-hour marathon session, announced
a tentative agreement early yesterday in the bitter
95-day restaurant strike which has idled 1,200
workers in some of the city's top restaurants.
The accord came with a solution of the final hurdle
in the dispute that started Sept. 1, between the 55-
member Golden Gate Restaurant Association and
Local 2 of the Hotel & Restaurant Employees &
Bartenders Union — the issue of "permanent" re
placement of some striking workers by manage
ment last month.
"We're going to take back whoever wants to
come back," said GGRA President Peter Seely,
general manager of Canlis restaurant. About 150

replacements have been offered permanent jobs,
he added.
The workers are to get their jobs back within 30
days of ratification under the tentative three-year
agreement.
The announcement of the agreement came from
veteran labor mediator Sam Kagel, who said
ratification votes will be staged today and Friday by
the owner group and the union, respectively.
Workers are picketing 26 GGRA restaurants
plus 11 of the 17 other eating establishments that
broke away from the association early in the
dispute. Represented by attorney Mark Montob
bio, the splinter group reportedly was not included
in the proposal.
Seely said the owners had won most of their

demands, including more stringent eligibility stand
ards for health and pension benefits, tighter wage
increases over three years and lower entry pay for
new hires.
Union spokeswoman Barbara Lewis, declining
comment on any specifics of the proposal, said,
"All our strikers are going back to work with their
seniority rights and their contract intact."
GGRA negotiator Paul Finkle said he was "very
optimistic" about the tentative settlement.
"By and large," declared Finkle, "I would have
to say the strike has been ineffective," adding, in
response to a question, that neither side was too
happy with the outcome.
