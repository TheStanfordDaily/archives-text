# To scalp or not to scalp
## What students plan to do with Super Bowl tickets 
### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
A random telephone poll of a handful of the 50 student
winners of Super Bowl XIX tickets suggests that more than
half of the students are considering selling their tickets at
a considerable profit.
With rumors circulating that Super Bowl tickets might
fetch $200 each or more, some of the winners are consid-

ering scalping their two tickets instead of going to the
game, which will be held Jan. 20 in Stanford Stadium.
"If I can make profits in the $500 range, then I might go
ahead and do it," said one student winner.
Nearly 3,000 students signed up for the random ticket
draw last week. The 50 winners were chosen from a ticket
drum Saturday at the Apple Invitational Tourna
ment in Maples Pavilion. The winners will be able
to purchase their tickets in early January at the face value
of $60 each.
Junior Drew Grove said he is still "weighing all the fac
tors," but "anyone with a head on [his] shoulders would
consider scalping."
"It's a once-in-a-lifetime thine, but staying at home and
watching with your buddies might be just as good," Grove
said.
"If the scalping opportunity is there, I'm going to go for
it," another winner said.
Several of the winners noted that the going rate for tick
ets might escalate if the San Francisco 49ers play in the
contest.
"If certain teams get in, I will not scalp the tickets," said
one. "But otherwise, there's a good chance I'll scalp
them."
"If it's nobody interesting (in the game), then I might
look at what the market has to offer," said another.
According to Stanford Police Chief Marvin Herrington,
if the market is anything like that at Super Bowl
XVIII in Tampa Bay, profits will be in the "several
hundred dollar range" per ticket.
Herrington said Stanford police would do its best to
crack down on scalpers by placing plainclothes men in the
crowds around the stadium before the 3 p.m. game. He
said these officers would be "looking for scalping along
with things like purse-snatching."
i But Herrington was quick to point out that arrests could
only be made for scalping when two conditions are ful
filled: The ticket has to be sold for more than its face

value; and it has to be sold on the grounds of the stadium
or in the immediate vicinity of the event.
Herrington defined the stadium grounds as an area bor
dered by El Camino Real, Galvez Street, Campus Drive
and an imaginary east-west line drawn even with Sunken
Diamond. Thus, ticket-sellers working on the far side of
El Camino, for example, would not be guilty of scalping,
according to Herrington.
"We are not anticipating this to be a big problem,"
Herrington said. "I'm not naive enough to think it's not
going to happen, but it's going to happen where it's legal.
People that do this generally know what the law is."
"If someone's dumb enough to try it on the grounds,
then we will arrest him," he said.
According to Sue Robichek, Super Bowl assistant for
the Athletic Department, the tickets were drawn in pairs
to prevent scalping. The theory was that students who
won two tickets could take a friend or relative and would
thus be less likely to want to sell the booty.
Carrie Zepeda, a senior who won a pair of tickets, said
she will give them to her parents for Christmas.

Junior George Ramos pledged the seats to his two
younger brothers if he won.
Sophomore Catherine Dominguez said she considered
scalping the tickets but then decided "that I really want to
go." Dominguez invited her father to watch the game with
her.
Of the 1,500 tickets allocated to Stanford by the Na
tional Football League, the University earmarked 100 for
students and another 100 for faculty and staff.
The faculty/staff draw begins today.
