## The 						Stanford Daily South Africa sense 
### 
Something exciting is happening. All over
America people are taking a stand against the
apartheid regime of South Africa and the U.S.
partnership with that nation.
Rep. Ron Dellums (D-Berkeley), Civil Rights
Commissioner Mary Berry, TransAfrica Director
Randall Robinson, Rep. Don Edwards (D-San
Jose), Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), Gary, Ind.,
Mayor Richard Hatcher and Yolanda King, Mar
tin Luther King, Jr.'s daughter, have all been ar
rested for protesting at the South African Em
bassy in Washington, D.C.
The longshoremen in San Francisco are facing
fines of $70,000 because they refuse to unload
cargo from South Africa aboard a Dutch
freighter.
The ASSU voted to boycott Motorola Corp.
products and ask the Career Planning and Place
ment Center to provide information on
Motorola's poor record in South Africa to stu
dents interviewing with the company.
We heartily applaud these acts of courage and
conscience and hope that they will continue and
escalate until South Africa is free for all of its
people.
It is unfortunate that, because of the nature of
the products made by Motorola, a boycott by stu

dents will not create much of a financial strain on
the company. And while we agree that students
should know as much as possible about their po
tential employers, we think that students and the
CPPC should ask themselves whether this is the
responsibility of the placement center.
We do feel, however, that every person has an
obligation to be aware of and take a stand against
injustice. As Martin Luther King said, "Injustice
anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."
We need to be particularly sensitive because our
nation and university are in complicity with this
injustice.
Next quarter, the issue of ending American
support for the apartheid regime again will be
thrust to the fore. We hope that this time, every
one will join in this movement for the freedom of
the South African people. The social conscience
of the Stanford community has blossomed during
the past quarter. We hope that next year it will
ignite and activate the campus to act against
apartheid.
We have become informed and passed a
resolution calling for Stanford to divest from
Motorola. Next quarter, we must hold the board
of trustees accountable and demand that it not
resist the tide of conscience spreading across
America.
