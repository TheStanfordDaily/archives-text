# Pre-registration blues
## 
### 
It's that time of the quarter again. You open
your time schedule only to find out that every
single class you want to take is offered at 9 or 11
a.m. But do not fear. You're in the first group to
pre-register. You finally have your chance. All is
not lost. Or is it?
In order to take advantage of your fortunate
registering situation, you get up early Monday to
go sign class lists. But when you arrive at the
Communication Department several of the class
lists are already filled. It becomes clear that lists
have been up for some time.
Now what. Here was your chance to finally get
into the small courses you wanted. But because
every department makes up its own rules con
cerning pre-reg, you get left out again.
And the Communication Department is not
the only guilty party. If the University is going to

have rules for pre-reg, and it must stagger the
reg times for logistics sake, then departments
should follow certain basic rules to keep the sys
tem fair.
• No sign-up lists should be posted until the first
day of pre-reg.
• Students should sign up on departmental lists as
well as on lists in Old Union according to their al
phabetical registration time.
Professors who want to give priority to seniors
or students in their department should be allowed
to do so. But the other students admitted to a
course should be admitted on some egalitarian
basis. If professors and departments would
respect the alphabetical sign-up procedure, then
everyone would get a chance to get into classes
when his letter finally makes it to the top of the
list.
