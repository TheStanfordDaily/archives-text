# Smoking rules needed
## 
### 
The University instituted a new policy last
week which prohibits smoking in classrooms,
open-air offices, lobbies, hallways, restrooms and
stairwells. Officials who approved the policy are
trying to achieve a "smoke-free environment,"
according to Marlene Wine, special assistant to
University President Donald Kennedy.
Achieving that environment is a laudable goal
for Stanford. Wine said the primary purpose of
the policy is to protect non-smokers from car
cinogenic sidestream smoke. She noted that
secondhand smoke is dangerous, citing an Envi
ronmental Protection Agency survey that es
timates 500 to 5,000 non-smokers die each year
of lung cancer caused by other people's
cigarettes. "We want to protect the majority of
the University population who are non
smokers," Wine said.
The tobacco industry contends that
secondhand smoke causes no adverse health ef
fects. Regardless of this contention, however, it is
unarguable that many individuals find

secondhand smoke extremely irritating.
Achieving a smoke-free environment here is a
feasible goal. According to University statistics, 6
percent of all students here are smokers, and 12
to 13 percent of faculty and staff members
smoke. Thus, the number of smokers on campus
does not merit a great deal of smoking space.
The new policy allows for the establishment of
designated smoking sections: in work areas,
where space permits; in dining and lounge areas,
if ventilation is adequate; and in closed rooms
that have floor-to-ceiling partitions, as long as
non-smokers are not exposed to secondhand
smoke. These designated areas seem sufficient
for smokers here.
Basically, the new policy prohibits smoking
everywhere on campus except in areas specifically
designated for smoking. The policy will create a
more enjoyable and healthy environment at
Stanford and is therefore a great service to the
community.
