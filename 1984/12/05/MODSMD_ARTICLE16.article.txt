# The 						Daily presence

### 
When The Daily's editorial board gets together
every Friday afternoon, there are usually some
pretty important issues to discuss. It's funny,
though. These "Big Issues" don't always get us
too excited.
Rather, it's the small things, the pet peeves, the
"little bitches," as one of us put it, that get up our
collective dander. Most of these don't warrant
entire editorials, but soon we find all those little
gripes weighing heavily on our chests. Now, at the
end of the quarter, it's time to throw them off so
we can all stand tall when we come back after
break.
Construction: It's become a Stanford tradition,
but not the sort of one we'd like to keep alive.
How about that Ouad? In August, it was going to
be done in September. In September, it became
October. Now it's December, and the work still
isn't done. The contractors will probably again
blame the weather for the delays, as if it's
impossible to predict in summer that it will rain a
few days in autumn.
The blood van: Whose idea is it to park the
blood-donor van so it blocks the bike path be
tween the bookstore and the post office? Traffic
is bad enough in the area, and it won't be long
before a few unlucky bicyclists are going to need
some of the blood the van has been collecting.
Parking: Just one thought. Why are there 40-
minute parking spaces but 50-minute classes?
Football: When Cardinal Today asked Stan
ford's graduating players what they'd miss least
about playing football here, many said the fans.
You must be careful not to bite the hand that
feeds you, and until the Cardinal runs up a few
Ohio State- or Oklahoma-quality seasons, the
players shouldn't expect Ohio State- or
Oklahoma-quality fans. The players do have
some die-hard fans in the members of the Stan
ford Players' Parents Association who gather

outside the main gate of the stadium before every
home game. Their loyalty is commendable; their
grammar — with a sign that reads, "Stanford
Player's Parents Association" — leaves much to be
desired.

But to keep you from thinking we're the
proverbial Grinch who stole the proverbial
Christmas, we'd like to join in the holiday spirit
and offer a few gifts to some of the people who
have graced our pages this quarter.
To the ASSU Senate, those masters of murky
thought and muddy verbiage: an ASSU-to-
English Dictionary.
To Eric Diesel and Steve Dauber, the heads of
Stanford Students for Mondale/Ferraro and the
College Republicans, respectively: The two
deserve nothing less than each other.
It is a great pleasure to give as a Christmas gift
the 1984 Quote of the Year award, smothered
generously in cream cheese, to Stanford Police
Sgt. Nick Bruno. At a forum on the department's
use of force at the Big Game, Bruno said: "One
captain was hit between the eyes by a bagel.
None of us expected that would happen." What
did they expect, lox?
To the Coffee House: ventilation.
To the Band: an Andy Geiger autographed
poster.
To Tresidder: a new bowling alley.
To Flo Mo: real ice cream.
To Stern: real everything else.
Last, and probably least, to our upstairs neigh
bors at the Chaparral, where a good time means
urinating off the roof of a building, we'd like to
give something funny. Anything funny.
