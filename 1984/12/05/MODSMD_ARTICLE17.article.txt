# Write me a column

Here's how to write a column. Just in case you were
wondering.
1. Find something that pisses you off.
This is the easy part. There's lots of material out there.
The world is a pretty shitty place, when you think about it.
Hey, you got into Stanford. You have lots of money.
You'll have lots more five years after you graduate, but
life still sucks, right? That's too bad, but at least there's al
ways something to complain aboutv Maybe you oanU-find
parts for your Porsche. I don't know. Why kill yourself?
Write a column. 1 mean, you doh't have to be starving to
be sad. It helps, though.
2. Pretend to know something about your topic.
This is a little more difficult than No. 1, but it's actually
easier than it should be. Nobody really knows anything,
anyhow. Some people are just better than others at faking
it. We call them experts. Everyone else is a layman. But
that's OK, because laymen can't understand a word the
experts say. So don't worry if you don't know jack about
your subject. It makes you that much closer to your audi
ence.
3. Forget about structure.
To hell with theses, topic sentences and the whole Har
vard outline idea. Just forget it. Strictly high-school
English stuff, that. We're in college now, and that means
free form. Be artsy. Write all over the place. It shows you

think differently than everyone else and can bring a fresh
perspective to the debate. Make a list or something.
4. Curse a lot.
This makes you look angrier than you are. That's good.
5. Make a joke or six. rl
Jokes are funny things, because people always take:
them seriously. This means that they also think all your
serious points are jokes. It can be a real pain in the ass, as
a matter of fact. ' * •> -.n » « -w >o)8f!j$of
6. Remember that you are right.
Even if you are absolutely wrong, ypu stjjl look, right.
Print is a neat thing. People see opinions that they dis
agree with in print, and they get very upset. It looks real,
like the word of God or something. This is why everyone
hates critics.
7. For God's sake don't be positive.
Bitterness is where it's at. Be negative. Sap is for trees.
Naive idealism, hope, optimism — sissy feelings, all of
them. No one listens to a sissy. Not in America at least.
8. Be short.
That's all I have to say about that one.
9. If it's a slow week make fun of yourself
Beat everyone else to it. This is the newspaper business.
