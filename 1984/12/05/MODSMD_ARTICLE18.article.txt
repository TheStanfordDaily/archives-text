# Nuclear waste
## 
### 
During the election, we, the
people, were bombarded with
propaganda about strength. Both
candidates, and one more than the
other, blabbed about a "strong
America"and said that to become
strong again and to remain strong, we
must spend billions and billions of
dollars on new nuclear weapons.
Both candidates argued that our
enemy responds only to strength;
hence, if we do not build more nu
clear weapons, our enemy will per
ceive this weakness, exploit it and
hegemonize the entire world under
its evil reign of tyranny. One candi
date proposed that we build a missile
called a Midgetman; the other pro
posed that we should continue build
ing the B-l bomber and the
"Peacekeeper missile" (or some
other doublespeak name) and start
building a fantastic space shield.
In many respects, the arguments of
the candidates make sense. Our
enemy has traditionally responded
primarily to strength. It exploits
our weaknesses for its gain, just as
we exploit its weaknesses for our
gain. Moreover, their arguments are
attractive in that no one wants to live
in a weak country. We want to live in
a strong country so that we can
protect and exercise the freedom
we've earned.
Unfortunately, the candidates
confused strength with military
strength. In their simple-minded view
of the world, they believe that if we
build more nuclear weapons, we will
be stronger. They fail to realize that
military strength has an upper limit.
That is, after a certain point, it does
not matter how many more nuclear
weapons we build, because these new
weapons do not increase our military
strength.
Consider our fleet of Trident sub
marines. Each submarine carries 240
warheads and each warhead is much,
much more powerful than the atomic
bomb dropped on Hiroshima. The
most recent studies on the long-term

effects of nuclear war show that it is
likely that two Trident submarines
have the capability of destroying
Western civilization as we know it. If
the entire fleet were to fire their
missiles at the enemy, it would cause
raging firestorms that would create
enough smoke and dust to block out
the sun over the entire Northern
Hemisphere, including the United
States, for months. We would live in
darkness, and the ensuing sub-zero
temperatures, as our crops and live
stock died, even if we were not hit by
an atomic bomb and only our enemy
were hit. If we also were unlucky enough
to be hit by nuclear weapons, as is
more than likely if we were to fire nu
clear weapons, we would endure the
resulting harsh, nuclear winter with
out electricity and hospitals.
Epidemics and plagues would spread
from the rotting, radiated bodies and
swarming pests. In short, the sur
vivors would be thrown back to the
Stone Age.
Now, if we have that much power
in our Trident fleet alone and if we
have at least another 10,000 war
heads, it then seems rather redundant
to build more nuclear weapons, espe
cially when one considers that Tri
dent submarines are invulnerable
when submerged. We are already
strong enough to destroy the world.
Why do we need to build more nu
clear weapons?
One can only conclude that we are
wasting the hundreds of billions of
dollars that we spend on new nuclear
weapons. These new weapons don't
produce anything; they don't give us
anything of value. They certainly will
never be used; once we destroy
civilization with our Tridents, we
don't need to destroy it again with
Peacekeeper missiles.
This money could be spent far
more productively. We could even
spend it to make America stronger
where it counts: for our people. For
example, the schools in the country
art 'onger providing an adequate

i education for many of our children.
; One study commissioned by Presi
; dent Reagan has suggested that it ap
t pears as if an enemy power has
deliberately sabotaged our educa
: tional system. Rather than simply
: praying for better schools, we could
t scrap the "peace" missile and pay our
i teachers a salary commensurate with
1 the responsibility we give them. We
i would then truly be a stronger
> country. We could stop production of
the B-l bomber and rebuild our
' deteriorating infrastructure. We
could build new roads, bridges, ports
i and railroads that we all can use and
, that will provide benefits for the
entire economy rather than a few
defense contractors We would then
truly be a stronger country. We could
cancel the ridiculously expensive and
I just plain ridiculous Star Wars plan
I and use the trillion dollars to pay our
deficit and to train the people of
America for productive jobs. We
would then truly be a stronger
country, because we would be a
better-educated people, a better
trained people, with a stronger eco
nomy, and we would still have a
strong enough defense to destroy
civilization at least once, no matter
what our enemy does.
In short, any new major nuclear
weapons system would be a waste of
money, because it would not increase
our strength. Accordingly, any money
spent on nuclear weapons actually
weakens our country, because money
spent on weapons is money that could
be spent on education or on the eco
nomy: on making our country strong
again. We live in a great country ded
icated to the highest principles:
freedom and equality. Let's not
weaken our great country by foolishly
wasting it on unneeded nuclear weap
ons.

could build new roads, bridges, ports

deficit and to train the people of
America for productive jobs. We
would then truly be a stronger
country, because we would be a
better-educated people, a better

nomy, and we would still have a
strong enough defense to destroy
civilization at least once, no matter
what our enemy does.
In short, any new major nuclear
weapons system would be a waste of
money, because it would not increase
our strength. Accordingly, any money
spent on nuclear weapons actually
weakens our country, because money
spent on weapons is money that could
be spent on education or on the eco
nomy: on making our country strong
again. We live in a great country ded
icated to the highest principles:
freedom and equality. Let's not
weaken our great country by foolishly
wasting it on unneeded nuclear weap
ons.

During the election, we, the
people, were bombarded with
propaganda about strength. Both
candidates, and one more than the
other, blabbed about a "strong
America"and said that to become
strong again and to remain strong, we
must spend billions and billions of
dollars on new nuclear weapons.
Both candidates argued that our
enemy responds only to strength;
hence, if we do not build more nu
clear weapons, our enemy will per
ceive this weakness, exploit it and
hegemonize the entire world under
its evil reign of tyranny. One candi
date proposed that we build a missile
called a Midgetman; the other pro
posed that we should continue build
ing the B-l bomber and the
"Peacekeeper missile" (or some
other doublespeak name) and start
building a fantastic space shield.
In many respects, the arguments of
the candidates make sense. Our
enemy has traditionally responded
primarily to strength. It exploits
our weaknesses for its gain, just as
we exploit its weaknesses for our
gain. Moreover, their arguments are
attractive in that no one wants to live
in a weak country. We want to live in
a strong country so that we can
protect and exercise the freedom
we've earned.
Unfortunately, the candidates
confused strength with military
strength. In their simple-minded view
of the world, they believe that if we
build more nuclear weapons, we will
be stronger. They fail to realize that
military strength has an upper limit.
That is, after a certain point, it does
not matter how many more nuclear
weapons we build, because these new
weapons do not increase our military
strength.
Consider our fleet of Trident sub
marines. Each submarine carries 240
warheads and each warhead is much,
much more powerful than the atomic
bomb dropped on Hiroshima. The
most recent studies on the long-term

effects of nuclear war show that it is
likely that two Trident submarines
have the capability of destroying
Western civilization as we know it. If
the entire fleet were to fire their
missiles at the enemy, it would cause
raging firestorms that would create
enough smoke and dust to block out
the sun over the entire Northern
Hemisphere, including the United
States, for months. We would live in
darkness, and the ensuing sub-zero
temperatures, as our crops and live
stock died, even if we were not hit by
an atomic bomb and only our enemy
were hit. If we also were unlucky enough
to be hit by nuclear weapons, as is
more than likely if we were to fire nu
clear weapons, we would endure the
resulting harsh, nuclear winter with
out electricity and hospitals.
Epidemics and plagues would spread
from the rotting, radiated bodies and
swarming pests. In short, the sur
vivors would be thrown back to the
Stone Age.
Now, if we have that much power
in our Trident fleet alone and if we
have at least another 10,000 war
heads, it then seems rather redundant
to build more nuclear weapons, espe
cially when one considers that Tri
dent submarines are invulnerable
when submerged. We are already
strong enough to destroy the world.
Why do we need to build more nu
clear weapons?
One can only conclude that we are
wasting the hundreds of billions of
dollars that we spend on new nuclear
weapons. These new weapons don't
produce anything; they don't give us
anything of value. They certainly will
never be used; once we destroy
civilization with our Tridents, we
don't need to destroy it again with
Peacekeeper missiles.
This money could be spent far
more productively. We could even
spend it to make America stronger
where it counts: for our people. For
example, the schools in the country
art 'onger providing an adequate

i education for many of our children.
; One study commissioned by Presi
; dent Reagan has suggested that it ap
t pears as if an enemy power has
deliberately sabotaged our educa
: tional system. Rather than simply
: praying for better schools, we could
t scrap the "peace" missile and pay our
i teachers a salary commensurate with
1 the responsibility we give them. We
i would then truly be a stronger
