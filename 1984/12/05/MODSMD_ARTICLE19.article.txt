# RACHELLE MARSHALL
## Terror and silence 
### 
Last April President Reagan sent legislation to Congress that would make it
a cnme for Americans to give aid to foreign terrorists. The secretary of state
would be the sole judge of who was a terrorist. Fortunately, Congress let that
one go by, but it would be hard to imagine how such a bill could be debated
without exposing the Reagan administration's own complicity in terrorism
abroad.
Under Reagan's presidency, the word is used so selectively it has all but lost
its meaning. In Nicaragua, for instance, the U.S.-backed guerrillas who burn
crops, massacre unarmed villagers and openly boast of assassinating govern
ment officials, are not terrorists but "freedom fighters." Two years ago, when
government death squads in Guatemala were kidnapping and murdering poli
tical dissenters and decimating Indian villages in the countryside, Reagan held

VIEWPOINT

a friendly meeting with Guatemala's then military dictator, General Efrain
Rios Montt, declared Montt had been given "a bum rap," and promised to
resume U.S. military aid.
While oppressive regimes around the world use terror as an instrument of
policy, in some countries it is virtually a substitute for government. Nowhere is
this more true today than in Chile, where for 11 years a military junta led by
Augusto Pinochet has suppressed dissent through the systematic use of kid
napping, torture and imprisonment. Still, in a country with 35-percent un
employment, notoriously low wages and an all-but-bankrupt economy,
opposition to Pinochet has been irrepressible. Despite bloody retaliation by
the army and police, protest demonstrations continue to take place.
In an effort to end them, Pinochet declared a state of siege on Nov. 6 (the
day that Reagan was re-elected). The government shut down newspapers and
magazines, banned all public meetings and rounded up hundreds of political
and labor leaders after ransacking their homes and offices. Pinochet, who took
over Chile in a coup that the United States helped foment, has announced his
determination to rule at least until 1989. His latest crackdown is seen as a
move to intimidate and destroy all opposition.
Because the poor have suffered most from Pinochet's ruthless economic and
social policies, the government crackdown has been most severe in working
class neighborhoods and shantytowns. Since early November, troops and
police have swept through entire communities in a series of pre-dawn raids. As
helicopters hover low overhead, their engines roaring, soldiers with machine
guns swarm through the streets, breaking into homes, dragging out all the men
over 16 and taking them away in vans — leaving behind stunned and terrified
women and children. Of the thousands arrested so far, many have never
returned; some have been sent to remote parts of Chile, others are unac
counted for. Untold numbers have been subjected to what Amnesty Interna
tional calls "torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman and degrading
treatment.'^
Arid what has been the Reagan administration's reaction to the terror in
Chile? To Vice President George Bush, Nicaragua is "a dungeon." But he, like
Reagan, Secretary of State George Shultz, U.N. Ambassador Jeanne
Kirkpatrick and other top foreign-policy officials, has been conspicuously
silent so far about the war that Pinochet is waging against his own people.
The reason for their silence is that the Reagan administration has had a soft
spot in its heart for Pinochet from the beginning. Although an estimated
30,000 Chileans have died in concentration camps or been killed by Pinochet's
firing squads since 1973, one of Reagan's early acts on taking office was to en
courage the Export-Import Bank and the International Monetary Fund to ex
tend generous loans to Chile. In July 1982, Assistant Secretary of State
Everett Briggs made a speech in Santiago congratulating Chile for having freed
itself from"the Marxist yoke" and pledging the "solidarity of President
Reagan's administration."
In 1981 Congress prohibited further U.S. aid to Chile unless there was
"significant progress" in human rights and unless the Chilean secret police
halted their assassinations of exiled political opponents. (One of these, Or
lando Letelier, was killed by a car bomb in Washington, D.C.) Despite this
legislation, in 1983 the Commodity Credit Corporation, a U.S. agency, assured
a consortium of private bankers that it would guarantee up to $144 million in
loans to Chile. With the Chilean economy in a shambles, there is little chance
these loans will be repaid. So American taxpayers may find themselves paying
not only for the murder of coffee farmers in Nicaragua but for the torture and
murder of poor Chileans as well.
Throughout American history, what are perceived as our national interests
have almost always superceded morality in determining U.S. foreign policy.
The Reagan administration is surely not the first to apply a double standard in
its relations with other countries. But the harsh discord between its rhetoric
and its actions where Nicaragua and Chile are concerned has less to do with
national interest than with ideology. Pinochet's lip service to a free-market
economy and his fulminations against Marxists (by which he means all leftists)
have made him immune from criticism by the Reagan administration. The San
dinistas, on the other hand, who have tried to improve the lot of the
Nicaraguan people, can seemingly do nothing to placate the United States but
agree to leave office and to hand Nicaragua over to leaders approved by the
CIA.

day that Reagan was re-elected). The government shut down newspapers and
magazines, banned all public meetings and rounded up hundreds of political
and labor leaders after ransacking their homes and offices. Pinochet, who took
over Chile in a coup that the United States helped foment, has announced his
determination to rule at least until 1989. His latest crackdown is seen as a
move to intimidate and destroy all opposition.
Because the poor have suffered most from Pinochet's ruthless economic and
social policies, the government crackdown has been most severe in working
class neighborhoods and shantytowns. Since early November, troops and
police have swept through entire communities in a series of pre-dawn raids. As
helicopters hover low overhead, their engines roaring, soldiers with machine
guns swarm through the streets, breaking into homes, dragging out all the men
over 16 and taking them away in vans — leaving behind stunned and terrified
women and children. Of the thousands arrested so far, many have never
returned; some have been sent to remote parts of Chile, others are unac
counted for. Untold numbers have been subjected to what Amnesty Interna
tional calls "torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman and degrading
treatment.'^
Arid what has been the Reagan administration's reaction to the terror in
Chile? To Vice President George Bush, Nicaragua is "a dungeon." But he, like
Reagan, Secretary of State George Shultz, U.N. Ambassador Jeanne
Kirkpatrick and other top foreign-policy officials, has been conspicuously
silent so far about the war that Pinochet is waging against his own people.
The reason for their silence is that the Reagan administration has had a soft
spot in its heart for Pinochet from the beginning. Although an estimated
30,000 Chileans have died in concentration camps or been killed by Pinochet's
firing squads since 1973, one of Reagan's early acts on taking office was to en
courage the Export-Import Bank and the International Monetary Fund to ex
tend generous loans to Chile. In July 1982, Assistant Secretary of State
Everett Briggs made a speech in Santiago congratulating Chile for having freed
itself from"the Marxist yoke" and pledging the "solidarity of President
Reagan's administration."
In 1981 Congress prohibited further U.S. aid to Chile unless there was
"significant progress" in human rights and unless the Chilean secret police
halted their assassinations of exiled political opponents. (One of these, Or
lando Letelier, was killed by a car bomb in Washington, D.C.) Despite this
legislation, in 1983 the Commodity Credit Corporation, a U.S. agency, assured
a consortium of private bankers that it would guarantee up to $144 million in
loans to Chile. With the Chilean economy in a shambles, there is little chance
these loans will be repaid. So American taxpayers may find themselves paying
not only for the murder of coffee farmers in Nicaragua but for the torture and
murder of poor Chileans as well.
Throughout American history, what are perceived as our national interests
have almost always superceded morality in determining U.S. foreign policy.
The Reagan administration is surely not the first to apply a double standard in
its relations with other countries. But the harsh discord between its rhetoric
and its actions where Nicaragua and Chile are concerned has less to do with
national interest than with ideology. Pinochet's lip service to a free-market
economy and his fulminations against Marxists (by which he means all leftists)
have made him immune from criticism by the Reagan administration. The San
dinistas, on the other hand, who have tried to improve the lot of the
Nicaraguan people, can seemingly do nothing to placate the United States but
agree to leave office and to hand Nicaragua over to leaders approved by the
CIA.

Last April President Reagan sent legislation to Congress that would make it
a cnme for Americans to give aid to foreign terrorists. The secretary of state
would be the sole judge of who was a terrorist. Fortunately, Congress let that
one go by, but it would be hard to imagine how such a bill could be debated
without exposing the Reagan administration's own complicity in terrorism
abroad.
Under Reagan's presidency, the word is used so selectively it has all but lost
its meaning. In Nicaragua, for instance, the U.S.-backed guerrillas who burn
crops, massacre unarmed villagers and openly boast of assassinating govern
ment officials, are not terrorists but "freedom fighters." Two years ago, when
government death squads in Guatemala were kidnapping and murdering poli
tical dissenters and decimating Indian villages in the countryside, Reagan held

a friendly meeting with Guatemala's then military dictator, General Efrain
Rios Montt, declared Montt had been given "a bum rap," and promised to
resume U.S. military aid.
While oppressive regimes around the world use terror as an instrument of
policy, in some countries it is virtually a substitute for government. Nowhere is
this more true today than in Chile, where for 11 years a military junta led by
Augusto Pinochet has suppressed dissent through the systematic use of kid
napping, torture and imprisonment. Still, in a country with 35-percent un
employment, notoriously low wages and an all-but-bankrupt economy,
opposition to Pinochet has been irrepressible. Despite bloody retaliation by
the army and police, protest demonstrations continue to take place.
In an effort to end them, Pinochet declared a state of siege on Nov. 6 (the
