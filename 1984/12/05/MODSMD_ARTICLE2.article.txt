# Report encourages new ties to Hoover
## Poli Sci profs, call it inaccurate 
### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
In a move apparently aimed at
mending damaged relations, a special
committee of Stanford and Hoover
Institution scholars is calling for a se
of joint appointment* that-wevtrid
create a prestigious social sciences
program here.
A recent report submitted to the
board of trustees suggests systematic
cooperation between Stanford and
Hoover "would immediately es
tablish Stanford in a position of al
most unchallengeable national lead
ership in the field of both domestic
and international public policy re
search."
That cooperation has been blocked
in part by the Political Science De
partment, which has engendered
"acrimonious" relations with
Hoover, according to the report. It
cites three Hoover scholars who
sought joint appointments in political
science but were in some way
rebuffed by the department.
The report further contends that
whereas the Economics Department
and the Graduate School of Business
have been "friendly and profes
sional" in dealing with Hoover, the
Political Science Department has
been less so.
The report, submitted to the board
of trustees subcommittee on
University-Hoover relations, was

prepared by a six-member resource
group chaired by Robert Ward, pro
fessor of political science, senior fel
low at Hoover and director of the
University's Center for Research in
International Studies.
meeting of the TulitiCill
Science Department's Plans and
Policies Committee was called yester
day to discuss the report. Members of
the five-person committee are eager
to correct what they see as substantial
factual inaccuracies.
Alexander George, political sci
ence professor and member of the
plans and policies committee, said the
committee is taking the report very
seriously. The entire department will
meet today to begin discussing a
response to the report.
"It's a very serious thing for a com
mittee of that kind to extend criticism
like this," George said.
The report also notes that it is an
occasion for "at least mild surprise"
that such Hoover appointees as
demographer Kingsley Davis, Nobel
economist Milton Friedman,
diplomat Philip Habib, philosopher
Thomas Sowell and physicist Edward
Teller have never been offered Uni
versity appointments.
"Other scholars at Hoover are
known to be aggrieved on this score,"
says the report.
In addition to Ward, the resource
group included Martin Anderson and
Peter Duignan, Hoover senior re
search fellows, John Ferejohn, pro
fessor of political science and Hoover
senior research fellow, James
Sheehan, chairman of the History
Department and the late William
Clebsch, professor of religious
studies.
The recommendations are de
signed to combine the individual
strengths of both institutions.
"The advantages for both parties
that could flow from the establish
ment of a systematically cooperative
relationship between the University
and Hoover are dazzling," according
to the report, which was made public
last Friday.
The report was greeted with en
thusiasm from University President
Donald Kennedy, who appointed the

group last March, Board of Trustees
Chairman William Kimball and
Hoover Director W. Glenn
Campbell.
Campbell said "increased coopera
tion will strengthen both institutions,
as this report points out so well and
convincingly. This is something that
the record will show I have long sup
ported and worked toward to the best
"of my abilities."
According to the report, joint ap
pointments at the senior level
"should make it possible in time to
assemble the strongest complement
of research talents in the social
sciences the U.S. has ever seen."
The resource group's report says
the program here would rival Har
vard's John F. Kennedy School of
Government, with Princeton's
Woodrow Wilson School of Public
and International Affairs represent
ing "a distinctly secondary chal
lenge."
Ward said by making joint
Stanford-Hoover appointments, the
quality of teaching and research will

be enhanced, and the current strain
between the two institutions may be
relaxed.
Kennedy said the University
"should not fail to take prompt ad
vantages" of the oppportunities cited
in the report.
Kennedy is expected to appoint a
committee to look into how the Uni
versity could work toward imple
menting the Ward recommendations.
The resource group said that of the
17 joint appointments made in the
last decade. 15 have been the result
of University employees who sought
Hoover appointments, while only two
Hoover fellows have been accepted
as part-time University professors.
The report laments this "notably one
sided" trend in appointments.
The Ward report indicates that by
accepting its recommendations, Stan
ford would be issuing a positive sign
"that the University and the Hoover
Institution have embarked on a
process of repairing the ideological
and other rifts that have divided them
in the past."

vantages" of the oppportunities cited
in the report.
Kennedy is expected to appoint a
committee to look into how the Uni
versity could work toward imple
menting the Ward recommendations.
The resource group said that of the
17 joint appointments made in the
last decade. 15 have been the result
of University employees who sought
Hoover appointments, while only two
Hoover fellows have been accepted
as part-time University professors.
The report laments this "notably one
sided" trend in appointments.
The Ward report indicates that by
accepting its recommendations, Stan
ford would be issuing a positive sign
"that the University and the Hoover
Institution have embarked on a
process of repairing the ideological
and other rifts that have divided them
in the past."
In a move apparently aimed at
mending damaged relations, a special
committee of Stanford and Hoover
Institution scholars is calling for a se
of joint appointment* that-wevtrid
create a prestigious social sciences
program here.
A recent report submitted to the
board of trustees suggests systematic
cooperation between Stanford and
Hoover "would immediately es
tablish Stanford in a position of al
most unchallengeable national lead
ership in the field of both domestic
and international public policy re
search."
That cooperation has been blocked
in part by the Political Science De
partment, which has engendered
"acrimonious" relations with
Hoover, according to the report. It
cites three Hoover scholars who
sought joint appointments in political
science but were in some way
rebuffed by the department.
The report further contends that
whereas the Economics Department
and the Graduate School of Business
have been "friendly and profes
sional" in dealing with Hoover, the
Political Science Department has
been less so.
The report, submitted to the board
of trustees subcommittee on
University-Hoover relations, was

prepared by a six-member resource
group chaired by Robert Ward, pro
fessor of political science, senior fel
low at Hoover and director of the
University's Center for Research in
International Studies.
meeting of the TulitiCill
Science Department's Plans and
Policies Committee was called yester
day to discuss the report. Members of
the five-person committee are eager
to correct what they see as substantial
factual inaccuracies.
Alexander George, political sci
ence professor and member of the
plans and policies committee, said the
committee is taking the report very
seriously. The entire department will
meet today to begin discussing a
response to the report.
"It's a very serious thing for a com
mittee of that kind to extend criticism
like this," George said.
The report also notes that it is an
occasion for "at least mild surprise"
that such Hoover appointees as
demographer Kingsley Davis, Nobel
economist Milton Friedman,
diplomat Philip Habib, philosopher
Thomas Sowell and physicist Edward
Teller have never been offered Uni
versity appointments.
"Other scholars at Hoover are
known to be aggrieved on this score,"
says the report.
In addition to Ward, the resource
group included Martin Anderson and
Peter Duignan, Hoover senior re
search fellows, John Ferejohn, pro
fessor of political science and Hoover
senior research fellow, James
Sheehan, chairman of the History
Department and the late William
Clebsch, professor of religious
studies.
The recommendations are de
signed to combine the individual
strengths of both institutions.
"The advantages for both parties
that could flow from the establish
ment of a systematically cooperative
relationship between the University
and Hoover are dazzling," according
to the report, which was made public
last Friday.
The report was greeted with en
thusiasm from University President
Donald Kennedy, who appointed the

group last March, Board of Trustees
Chairman William Kimball and
Hoover Director W. Glenn
Campbell.
Campbell said "increased coopera
tion will strengthen both institutions,
as this report points out so well and
convincingly. This is something that
the record will show I have long sup
ported and worked toward to the best
"of my abilities."
According to the report, joint ap
pointments at the senior level
"should make it possible in time to
assemble the strongest complement
of research talents in the social
sciences the U.S. has ever seen."
The resource group's report says
the program here would rival Har
vard's John F. Kennedy School of
Government, with Princeton's
Woodrow Wilson School of Public
and International Affairs represent
ing "a distinctly secondary chal
lenge."
Ward said by making joint
Stanford-Hoover appointments, the
quality of teaching and research will

be enhanced, and the current strain
between the two institutions may be
relaxed.
Kennedy said the University
"should not fail to take prompt ad
vantages" of the oppportunities cited
in the report.
