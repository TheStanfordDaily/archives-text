# Report encourages new ties to Hoover
## Poli Sci profs, call it inaccurate 
### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
In a move apparently aimed at
mending damaged relations, a special
committee of Stanford and Hoover
Institution scholars is calling for a se
of joint appointment* that-wevtrid
create a prestigious social sciences
program here.
A recent report submitted to the
board of trustees suggests systematic
cooperation between Stanford and
Hoover "would immediately es
tablish Stanford in a position of al
most unchallengeable national lead
ership in the field of both domestic
and international public policy re
search."
That cooperation has been blocked
in part by the Political Science De
partment, which has engendered
"acrimonious" relations with
Hoover, according to the report. It
cites three Hoover scholars who
sought joint appointments in political
science but were in some way
rebuffed by the department.
The report further contends that
whereas the Economics Department
and the Graduate School of Business
have been "friendly and profes
sional" in dealing with Hoover, the
Political Science Department has
been less so.
The report, submitted to the board
of trustees subcommittee on
University-Hoover relations, was

prepared by a six-member resource
group chaired by Robert Ward, pro
fessor of political science, senior fel
low at Hoover and director of the
University's Center for Research in
International Studies.
meeting of the TulitiCill
Science Department's Plans and
Policies Committee was called yester
day to discuss the report. Members of
the five-person committee are eager
to correct what they see as substantial
factual inaccuracies.
Alexander George, political sci
ence professor and member of the
plans and policies committee, said the
committee is taking the report very
seriously. The entire department will
meet today to begin discussing a
response to the report.
"It's a very serious thing for a com
mittee of that kind to extend criticism
like this," George said.
The report also notes that it is an
occasion for "at least mild surprise"
that such Hoover appointees as
demographer Kingsley Davis, Nobel
economist Milton Friedman,
diplomat Philip Habib, philosopher
Thomas Sowell and physicist Edward
Teller have never been offered Uni
versity appointments.
"Other scholars at Hoover are
known to be aggrieved on this score,"
says the report.
