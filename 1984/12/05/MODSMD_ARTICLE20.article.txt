Macintosh boycott?
Now that the ASSU has"urge(d)
Stanford students to boycott
Motorola Corp. products" (The
Daily, Nov. 28), it's time to examine
the impact such a boycott would
have on the Stanford community.
The definition of a boycott includes
discontinuing use of products as well
as restraining from buying new ones,
and this may affect students more
than they realize. In fact, the same
students who are so concerned about
the boycott may be directly support
ing Motorola without knowing it.
More than 3,000 Macintoshes
have been purchased by faculty, staff
and students through Microdisc since
the beginning of the program last
spring. However, these computers
would not operate without
Motorola's 68000 microprocessor,
the "brain" of the computer.
Roughly $4 million have gone into
the purchase of the Macintoshes, and
at $1,050 per computer it is an ex
cellent and affordable educational
opportunity for many Stanford stu
dents. It is completely unreasonable
to ask those who have already pur
chased Macs to discontinue their use
because of the Motorola chip, and
even if they wanted to sell the com
puters, they are forbidden to do so
by contract within one year of pur
chase.
It is important to be concerned
about where the University holds
investments, but our actions should
accurately reflect our cause. The
object is to protest Motorola's sale of
military and communications equip
ment to South Africa, but by re
questing a boycott of all Motorola
products, we are sacrificing valuable
educational opportunities which have
nothing to do with South Africa. The
issues warrant much closer investiga
tion if a decision is to be made which
is in the best interest of the Stanford
community.

Inform not titillate
Your story about the unsolved
murder of 1974 (The Daily, Nov.
29) may have been newsworthy.
However, there was absolutely no
reason for you to print a description
of the victim's condition or a photo
of her body being wheeled out of the
church. This is yellow journalism,
meant not to inform but to titillate.
You should be ashamed! Gabriel
Tarde, 19th-century French
sociologist, described the phenome
non of copycat crimes which follow
when the media publicize details
about gruesome murders. Are you
willing to accept that responsibility?

Sickening details
At the end of the quarter there is
not much happening between home

and the library. The Daily becomes
the highlight of my day and keeps
me in touch with reality. The sicken
ing details about Arlis Perry's death
(The Daily, Nov. 29) went far
beyond my need for information.
Was it vital to enlighten the reader
with such gruesome and descriptive
details?
I was furthermore infuriated and
outraged by the report of the con
versation between The Daily and
Bruce Perry's parents. The inter
viewer demonstrated a shocking lack
of sensitivity. In addition, the ques
tions were of nil interest and denoted
a journalistic practice rooted in the
sensational. Please be considerate to
your readers, leave this approach to
information for those who indulge in
the dubious practice of titillating
sadomasochistic tendencies.

No choice for peace
The propaganda machine in Wash
ington keeps telling us about the
Nicaraguan military buildup. With a
straight face they shout that all these
weapons are far beyond Nicaragua's
needs for its own defense.
How does a country of 3.5
million people defend itself
from the greatest military power in
the history of civilization? I'm not
sure, but being armed and prepared
certainly seems a prerequisite.
In rejecting the Contadora peace
plan after Nicaragua agreed to sign
it, Washington has signaled that it
will not stop short of absolute con
trol of all the governments in Central
America. If the United States should
continue to escalate the military
conflict in the area, as it most cer
tainly will, it would be more than
appropriate if Nicaragua were to
move against the U.S.-controlled
terrorist government in El Salvador
or the U.S. garrison state in Hon
duras.
For, given the U.S. position,
• Nicaragua is not allowed to choose
peace. It can only choose war on
U.S. terms or on its own.

Library suggestion
I would like to offer a fourth al
ternative site for the Ronald Reagan
Presidential Library at Stanford,
one vastly superior to those now
under consideration. I propose a
twin to Hoover Tower, shaped like
an MX Peacekeeper missile, posi
tioned on the west side of the Quad
on Serra Street where Sequoia Hall
now stands. Not only would the
symmetry of the campus be im
proved (Stanford's original planner,
Frederick Law Olmstead, God rest
his soul, liked symmetry), but place
ment in the scientific side of the
campus also would reflect nicely
Reagan's faith in science and tech
nology for achieving military
supremacy over our adversaries.
Imagine the patriotic pounding
hearts of thousands of scholars,
visitors, faculty and staff as they

drive up majestic Palm Drive and
come into view of the Hoover Insti
tution on War, Revolution and Peace
on the left, and on the right, the
Reagan Institution on Prayer,
Deficits, Arms and "Star Wars."
Symbolism of this kind is the very
foundation on which great univer
sities are built.
Why should a facility as important
as the Reagan library and museum
be tucked away, yes squandered on
sites as mediocre, inconsequential
and out-of-the-way as Deer Creek,
Alpine Road or a nameless hill be
hind Lake Lagunita? Has Stanford
lost its sense of what is important
and what is not?
Get with it, Stanford! Seize the
opportunity to give future genera
tions of leaders a chance to study in
the shadow of not one, but two
magnificent towering scholarly
edifices! Select the only site on the
campus that truly gives the Reagan
library the prominence it deserves.
Put it up front for all to see, to
admire, to be inspired by. God will
be forever grateful to Stanford and
his rich bounties will never cease to
flow in thy direction.

No simple solutions
Congratulations on a thoughtful
editorial "It's not so academic" (The
Daily, Nov. 27) concerning public
education. You rightly observe that
solutions to the many problems
currently facing public education,
particularly at the elementary and
secondary school levels, are not
simply found in requiring more
courses, anymore than today's prob
lems of reducing the threat of nu
clear annihilation are simply solved
by increasing defense spending.
While more money is unquestionably
needed, genuine solutions will re
quire a combination of better talent,
stronger leadership, wiser policies
and more money.
At issue is who will teach what
courses and how those courses will
be taught. Although the teaching
profession as part of the public ser
vice sector will never successfully
compete in salaries with private
sector careers, salaries for teaching
must be increased. Still, it's not just
the modest money that deters would
be teachers from entering the profes
sion or dissuades effective classroom
veterans from staying on. The quality
and caliber of one's colleagues — as
well as one's students — counts for a
great deal. In teaching, who you
work with can make'a big difference
in the kind of satisfaction and
meaning one experiences on the job.
Bright, competent and motivated
colleagues are crucial, yet they are
often the ones who leave after a few
years, in part perhaps because of the
money. But they also leave because
they are confronted with large
groups of students (for example four
or five classes daily of 30 to 40 stu
dents per class). Trying to reach and
teach that many students day after
day can lead to tremendous stresses
and strains on the best of teachers.
Much can be done, however, to

improve the quality of teaching and
of learning if more bright, talented
young people make a commitment
and put their minds and emotions to
the task of improving what goes on
in schools. To improve, education
not only needs an infusion of com
mitted and creative people in the
classroom but also a cadre of
research-minded young scholars who
will tackle the many unsolved prob
lems of effective teaching and learn
ing, particularly how to tailor
teaching to the broad range of differ
ences that learners bring to the class
room.
Recognizing cultural differences,
as noted in the editorial, and using
rather than denying those differences
to facilitate learning in the classroom
is essential. But it is not, as you
claim, the solution. More important
is dramatically improving the recruit
ment, selection and training of the
best possible people to become
classroom teachers. Even more
crucial is promoting and supporting a
heightened sense that we can,
through controlled research and
careful scholarship, learn to do bet
ter learning and teaching. Such
scholarship can provide the much
needed information to make better
policies concerning public education,
policies that now often condone
almost impossible situations for
teachers and learners. Fortunately
there are a few institutions like Stan
ford that are committed to excel
lence not only in preparing
outstanding teachers for the class
room but also in preparing top-flight
research scholars — people who can
conduct the kind of scholarly re
search that will lead to much-needed
reform in public and even private
education.

Service incentives
Efforts to link public service to
financial aid have received publicity
recently. I'd like to mention some
ways Stanford students can actively
assist University President Donald
Kennedy's office and others working
on this issue.
The importance of this work is
underscored by the situation students
face upon graduation, and even
sooner in choosing careers. Cur
rently, students who may be inter
ested in public-service careers are
discouraged by the relatively lower
wages paid for this employment in
comparison with those paid by the
private sector. Another problem is
that many students compile large
educational debts during college
years. These problems can make it
impractical to seek public-service
employment.
The possibility of providing finan
cial aid benefits to those willing to
spend a part of their careers in public
service may help alleviate some of
the economic disincentives.
