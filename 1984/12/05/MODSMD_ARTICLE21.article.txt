## Stanford vs. the public interest 
### 
What would Stanford do if one of its most
respected members — a well known professor of
splendid wit and peculiar charm and one of the
most eminent scholars of our system of justice —
decided one day to play games with that very sys
tem, to toy with it out of some perverse sense of in
tellectual curiosity, or decided to use it cynically for
selfish gain.
The answer is that Stanford would do nothing.
The University does not care.
The case is already a reality. There is sufficient
information to suggest immoral conduct by a pro
fessor. Though neither I nor Stanford can fairly

VIEWPOINT

judge without hearing his side, there is enough
evidence to warrant a forum to discuss the issue.
As things stand now, though, it will be dropped,
with possibly severe implications for Stanford's
reputation and for the future of our legal system,
unless someone steps in soon to set up a procedure.
Here is how the prosecution's case might sound
in Stanford vs. John Kaplan.
In just a few weeks, Prof. John Kaplan of the
Law School will file an apellate brief to the federal
circuit court in a case which he has already lost in
district court, a case which seems to many to have
little apparent merit, a case where Kaplan may be
taking advantage of his knowledge of the legal sys
tem to try to extract $1 million from a national
magazine.
Kaplan's claim is that Newsweek damaged his
reputation in an article back in October 1983. He
didn't like the fact that Newsweek said his under
graduate course was the easiest course at Stanford,
and that it was broadcast over KZSU in the after
noon when it was actually broadcast in the evening.
Kaplan says this caused him considerable suffer
ing and loss of esteem among his colleagues. He
calls Newsweek's action "libel and intentional in
fliction of emotional distress."
Perhaps a magazine article like the one in
Newsweek might hurt a younger man teaching his
first course at Stanford. But Prof. Kaplan is not
a schoolboy getting up in front of the class for the
first time. He is a public figure.
The law school community knows Kaplan as
someone who is outspoken if not flamboyant. Some
say that he welcomes publicity and controversy,
and that he seems to thrive on it.
So where is the harm, the loss of esteem and the
suffering?

This is the same John Kaplan that has lost such
esteem in the profession that he is now visiting for
the year at Harvard Law School.
It is the same Prof. Kaplan whom we have
regarded and still regard at the Stanford Law
School as one of the foremost authorities on
evidence and criminal law.
It is the same Prof. Kaplan that some of us in
the Law School used to look up to with respect and
trust.
What, then, is this case all about?
This appears to be a case about greed and
revenge. Kaplan is not just asking for a mere
retraction to clear his name. He already had the
chance to respond in a letter to the editor.
Kaplan is asking for $1 million — more than the
average American family will earn in a lifetime, the
equivalent of what a Stanford law professor will
earn in 20 years and enough to retire on comfor
tably. Kaplan would never have to lift a pen or
stand at a podium again.
Kaplan probably isn't just out to snatch the
equivalent of 20 years' worth of salary in one fell
swoop or to buy a condominium in Hawaii. He
wants to punish the media through Newsweek. Half
of the $1 million that he is asking is for punishment.
Perhaps Kaplan isn't vindictive or greedy. Per
haps he thinks that this is just a big joke and an
other avenue to publicity. Maybe he just wants to
play intellectual games with the legal system the
same way that little boys pull the legs off spiders or
smash up toys.
The problem is that this is not just a game. The
court is not a playground. Kaplan is just one tier
below the highest court in the land.
What Kaplan is doing hurts everybody.
Stanford law professors know that our society
has become too litigious. They know that our
courts are filled and that one reason ordinary
people don't receive justice is because wealthier
members of society tie up the courts with frivolous
claims.
They know, too, that making exhorbitant claims
in litigation is an abuse of the faults of the legal sys
tem. If you have the best lawyers on your side you
can find a loophole and win more than you deserve,
or you can threaten a long legal battle and can force
your opponent to settle out of court, not because he
is legally in the wrong, but because he can't afford
the expense of a legal battle.
They know that people who pay for the excessive
reliance on the courts are taxpayers who have to
pay the salaries of judges, their assistants, stenog

raphers, court clerks and a whole army of people
every time a case goes to court.
Most professors know better, and they don't take
advantage of the courts. They know that they rep
resent the public trust. They know that society
demands high moral standards of its law faculties
and expects them to lead by good example.
So when a Stanford professor of criminal law and
evidence at one of the nation's top law schools
takes his claim of $1 million to a federal circuit
court, it is an act which tarnishes the degree of
every Stanford law graduate, hurts the national
reputation of the school, violates the public trust
and shatters faith in our democratic institutions.
It is an act which demands outrage from the dean
and faculty of the Law School and from the entire
Stanford community.
If Kaplan were a student, the University could
hear a challenge like that and then listen to
Kaplan's side by initiating procedures under the
Fundamental Standard.
According to the standard, "Students are ex
pected to show, both within and without the Uni
versity, respect for order, morality, personal honor,
and the rights of others as is demanded of good
citizens. Failure to do this shall be sufficient cause
for removal from the University." But unfortun
ately the standard only works in one direction —
top down. The same rules do not apply to faculty
members.
Since Kaplan is a professor, only the University's
Statement on Faculty Discipline applies. It is a very
different standard from the student code. It says
that a professor may not be subject to any discipli
nary sanctions for immoral conduct occurring
outside the University.
In other words, a Stanford law professor found to
be abusing the legal system within the boundaries
of the law or teaching students how to disobey the
law can keep on teaching and setting examples for
generations of future Stanford lawyers.
Is this a policy Stanford really wishes to con
tinue?
If Kaplan is abusing the courts, the University
must take appropriate action. If he is not, we will
all be better off knowing that Stanford has a means
of holding faculty as well as students to high moral
standards, and that there is a procedure to help
erase the taint that the Kaplan case puts on Stan
ford's reputation and on its law degrees.
Until it acts, the University's policy is one of
silence. One must conclude that Stanford just does
not care.

tem. If you have the best lawyers on your side you
can find a loophole and win more than you deserve,
or you can threaten a long legal battle and can force
your opponent to settle out of court, not because he
is legally in the wrong, but because he can't afford
the expense of a legal battle.
They know that people who pay for the excessive
reliance on the courts are taxpayers who have to
pay the salaries of judges, their assistants, stenog

raphers, court clerks and a whole army of people
every time a case goes to court.
Most professors know better, and they don't take
advantage of the courts. They know that they rep
resent the public trust. They know that society
demands high moral standards of its law faculties
and expects them to lead by good example.
So when a Stanford professor of criminal law and
evidence at one of the nation's top law schools
takes his claim of $1 million to a federal circuit
court, it is an act which tarnishes the degree of
every Stanford law graduate, hurts the national
reputation of the school, violates the public trust
and shatters faith in our democratic institutions.
It is an act which demands outrage from the dean
and faculty of the Law School and from the entire
Stanford community.
If Kaplan were a student, the University could
hear a challenge like that and then listen to
Kaplan's side by initiating procedures under the
Fundamental Standard.
According to the standard, "Students are ex
pected to show, both within and without the Uni
versity, respect for order, morality, personal honor,
and the rights of others as is demanded of good
citizens. Failure to do this shall be sufficient cause
for removal from the University." But unfortun
ately the standard only works in one direction —
top down. The same rules do not apply to faculty
members.
Since Kaplan is a professor, only the University's
Statement on Faculty Discipline applies. It is a very
different standard from the student code. It says
that a professor may not be subject to any discipli
nary sanctions for immoral conduct occurring
outside the University.
In other words, a Stanford law professor found to
be abusing the legal system within the boundaries
of the law or teaching students how to disobey the
law can keep on teaching and setting examples for
generations of future Stanford lawyers.
Is this a policy Stanford really wishes to con
tinue?
If Kaplan is abusing the courts, the University
must take appropriate action. If he is not, we will
all be better off knowing that Stanford has a means
of holding faculty as well as students to high moral
standards, and that there is a procedure to help
erase the taint that the Kaplan case puts on Stan
ford's reputation and on its law degrees.
Until it acts, the University's policy is one of
silence. One must conclude that Stanford just does
not care.
(David Lempert is a fourth-year J D IMB A student.)
What would Stanford do if one of its most
respected members — a well known professor of
splendid wit and peculiar charm and one of the
most eminent scholars of our system of justice —
decided one day to play games with that very sys
tem, to toy with it out of some perverse sense of in
tellectual curiosity, or decided to use it cynically for
selfish gain.
The answer is that Stanford would do nothing.
The University does not care.
The case is already a reality. There is sufficient
information to suggest immoral conduct by a pro
fessor. Though neither I nor Stanford can fairly

VIEWPOINT

judge without hearing his side, there is enough
evidence to warrant a forum to discuss the issue.
As things stand now, though, it will be dropped,
with possibly severe implications for Stanford's
reputation and for the future of our legal system,
unless someone steps in soon to set up a procedure.
Here is how the prosecution's case might sound
in Stanford vs. John Kaplan.
In just a few weeks, Prof. John Kaplan of the
Law School will file an apellate brief to the federal
circuit court in a case which he has already lost in
district court, a case which seems to many to have
little apparent merit, a case where Kaplan may be
taking advantage of his knowledge of the legal sys
tem to try to extract $1 million from a national
magazine.
Kaplan's claim is that Newsweek damaged his
reputation in an article back in October 1983. He
didn't like the fact that Newsweek said his under
graduate course was the easiest course at Stanford,
and that it was broadcast over KZSU in the after
noon when it was actually broadcast in the evening.
Kaplan says this caused him considerable suffer
ing and loss of esteem among his colleagues. He
calls Newsweek's action "libel and intentional in
fliction of emotional distress."
Perhaps a magazine article like the one in
Newsweek might hurt a younger man teaching his
first course at Stanford. But Prof. Kaplan is not
a schoolboy getting up in front of the class for the
first time. He is a public figure.
The law school community knows Kaplan as
someone who is outspoken if not flamboyant. Some
say that he welcomes publicity and controversy,
and that he seems to thrive on it.
So where is the harm, the loss of esteem and the
suffering?

This is the same John Kaplan that has lost such
esteem in the profession that he is now visiting for
the year at Harvard Law School.
It is the same Prof. Kaplan whom we have
regarded and still regard at the Stanford Law
School as one of the foremost authorities on
evidence and criminal law.
It is the same Prof. Kaplan that some of us in
the Law School used to look up to with respect and
trust.
What, then, is this case all about?
This appears to be a case about greed and
revenge. Kaplan is not just asking for a mere
retraction to clear his name. He already had the
chance to respond in a letter to the editor.
Kaplan is asking for $1 million — more than the
average American family will earn in a lifetime, the
equivalent of what a Stanford law professor will
earn in 20 years and enough to retire on comfor
tably. Kaplan would never have to lift a pen or
stand at a podium again.
Kaplan probably isn't just out to snatch the
equivalent of 20 years' worth of salary in one fell
swoop or to buy a condominium in Hawaii. He
wants to punish the media through Newsweek. Half
of the $1 million that he is asking is for punishment.
Perhaps Kaplan isn't vindictive or greedy. Per
haps he thinks that this is just a big joke and an
other avenue to publicity. Maybe he just wants to
play intellectual games with the legal system the
same way that little boys pull the legs off spiders or
smash up toys.
The problem is that this is not just a game. The
court is not a playground. Kaplan is just one tier
below the highest court in the land.
What Kaplan is doing hurts everybody.
Stanford law professors know that our society
has become too litigious. They know that our
courts are filled and that one reason ordinary
people don't receive justice is because wealthier
members of society tie up the courts with frivolous
claims.
They know, too, that making exhorbitant claims
in litigation is an abuse of the faults of the legal sys
tem. If you have the best lawyers on your side you
can find a loophole and win more than you deserve,
or you can threaten a long legal battle and can force
your opponent to settle out of court, not because he
is legally in the wrong, but because he can't afford
