## Cardinal off to a quick, winning start Pacific, La Salle defeated, Stanford wins Apple Invite 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
People have constantly reminded
the Stanford basketball team that
four of its top players from last year's
19-12 team aren't around this year.
And that more than 70 percent of the
offense is gone as well. And that only
one senior is in the starting lineup.
But somebody forgot to tell the
Cardinal that it's not supposed to win
games like it did Saturday night,
when it defeated La Salle University,
83-72, to win the four-team Apple
Invitational Tournament. And the
scary thing about it is that Stanford
handled La Salle (of Philadelphia),
considered to be one of the top teams
on the East Coast, with relative ease.
When Stanford Coach Tom Davis
put the "pine patrol" into the game
with a little more than two minutes
left, the score was 83-65. Had he left
the regulars in, the Cardinal probably
would have beaten the Explorers by
more than 20 points.
Davis didn't take an "I-told-you
so" attitude after the victory, simply
because he hasn't been telling
anybody so. Davis, in fact, was nearly
as surprised with the his team's per
formance as the crowd was.
"I thought it was an exceptional
win because La Salle played a very
good game," Davis said. "It wasn't a
case of them not playing very well. To
be quite honest, we are playing better
than we thought we would at this
point."
Stanford, which won for the second
time in its tournament's four-year
history, beat the University of the
Pacific, 66-53, in Friday night's first
game and then beat La Salle to
remain undefeated after three games.
La Salle, which dropped to 2-2,
earned the right to play Stanford for
the first-place trophy — a clock on a
slab of redwood — by defeating Brig
ham Young University, 74-73, on a

last-second tip-in by All-Tournament
forward Ralph Lewis.
Lewis was joined on the all
tourney team by teammate Steve
Black (who had a two-game total of
42 points), Brigham Young's Timo
Saarelainen (47 points) and Stan
ford's Keith Ramee (25 points, 10 as
sists) and Novian Whitsitt (26
points). The tournament's Most
Valuable Player was Cardinal for
ward Earl Koberlein. who led Stan
ford with 28 points and 14 rebounds.
He also shot 80 percent (8-for-10)
from the floor.
Brigham Young, the tallest team in
the tournament, overcame a 15-4
deficit to defeat Pacific, 72-63, in the
consolation game and evened its
record at 1-1. Pacific, trying to shake
the memories of a 3-27 record last
season, fell to 0-3.
The talk of the tournament,
however, was Stanford and the way it
disposed of a La Salle team most
Cardinal players agreed will be in the
postseason tournament picture by
season's end. But it was also a La
Salle team playing without 6-foot-9,
215-pound center Albert "Truck"
Butts, who was declared ineligible
last week for playing in high school
after his 20th birthday.
"The bottom line is that we did
play them without their very, very
fine center. Truck Butts," Davis said.
"We're also aware they were playing
the last game of a (three-game) road
trip. But at the same time, it's such a
great win for this young team. I'm
very proud of them."
It didn't take very sophisticated
knowledge of basketball to figure out
where Stanford beat La Salle — the
free-throw line.
It wasn't that the Explorers missed
free throws — they missed only one
and outshot the Cardinal at the line,
83.3 to 72.2 percent. It was that the
Explorers didn't shoot many. Stan

ford shot 36. La Salle shot six.
Stanford shot most of them, 20 to
be exact, in the final six minutes and
21 seconds of the game, after Davis
decided to protect a 66-55 lead with
his famed "The Roll" delay game.
Junior guard Keith Ramee took con
trol of the ball — and the game. "The
Roll" isolated Ramee on the right
side of the court and let him go one
on-one against his defender.
"It takes a really good defensive
player to guard somebody one-on
one," said Ramee, who scored nine
straight points after Stanford went
into its delay game. "1 look good, but
it's the guys off the ball that make it
work"
Ramee hit a pair of free throws
with 6:21 left, then converted a
three-point play, a lay-in and two
more free throws to give the Cardinal
a 75-59 lead with 4:22 to go. Nine
seconds later. Black — La Salle's big
gest offensive threat — fouled out,
and the Explorers were history.
Stanford got in position to ice the
game with "The Roll" by rattling La
Salle with its full-court press and rat
tling the basket with piping-hot
shooting.
"Stanford showed us one of the
best presses in the country; 40
minutes of pressure," La Salle Coach
Dave "Lefty" Ervin said. "I haven't
seen a better press in three or four
years. And Stanford shot as well as
[it] possibly could. I'll be surprised if
[it has] another shooting night like
that this season."
The Cardinal made 15 of 23 shots
(65.2 percent) in the second half and
29 of 48 in the game (60.4 percent),
many of which were, uncharacteristi
cally, from the 12- to 15-foot range.
Once again, Stanford spread the
scoring around — three players
scored 14 points and a fourth had 13.
No Cardinal player has scored more
than 16 points in a game this season.

"At first, it was hard (breaking La
Salle's 1-3-1 zone defense) because
(6-5) Steve Black was playing at the
top," said Whitsitt, Stanford's leading
scorer with a 14 points-per-game
average. "But after a while, it started
breaking down because they got
tired."
Stanford broke open a close game,
one that was tied nine times in the
first half, during a four-minute stretch
in the second half. Five Cardinal
players scored in a 12-4 run that gave
it a 61-49 lead with 10:21 remaining.
Koberlein started the surge with a
twisting foltr-footer from the left side,
followed by a hook from the right
"baseline that freshman center Eric
Reveno said he "made up as I went
along." Two minutes later, another
freshman, 6-11 forward Greg Butler,
helped out with an eight-footer in the
lane that made it 56-47.
"1 thought that was our best game
by far," Davis said of his team, which
outrebounded La Salle, 33-22, and
outshot it, 60.4 to 53.1 percent. "We
played some really good minutes
against Pacific last night (Friday), but
we got rattled at times."
Against the Tigers, Stanford shot
64 percent from the floor in the first
half and went into the locker room
with a 40-22 lead. But in the second
half, the Cardinal had what Davis
called "a few moments," turning the
ball over 14 times and scoring only 26
points.
Stanford had a 51 -28 advantage, its
biggest of the night, with 13:40 left in
the game. However, it was then that
the roof started to crack and, thanks
to Pacific's poor free-throw shooting,
it didn't fall in.
The Tigers scored 13 staight points
in a four-minute stretch to cut Stan
ford's lead to 10 with 9:23 to go.
They narrowed it to nine with 5:07

left, but could have been as close as
three had they not missed the front
ends of three one-and-one free throw
opportunities. For the game, Pacific
1 made 13 of 25 free throws (52 per
cent) and 20 of 47 field goals (42.6
percent).

"Once you get that lead, it's hard
to keep that drive," Davis said. "And
the younger you are, the bigger a
problem it is. We've got to work on
that, because anytime we get a lead,
we've got to hold onto it."
Two incidents in particular helped
spice up an otherwise boring game.
Minutes into the game, Koberlein
took the ball on the right side and
went in for a one-hand slam dunk, the
first of his career. "All the guys in my

fraternity were giving me crap about
not having a dunk," said Koberlein, a
junior who finished the game with a
team-high 14 points. "I finally got
one tonight."
Midway through the second half,
Davis took center stage. After a few
calls — or lack of them — by the offi
cials. Davis argued a charging foul on
Ramee a little too vehemently and
drew a rare technical foul.

Black (who had a two-game total of
42 points), Brigham Young's Timo
Saarelainen (47 points) and Stan
ford's Keith Ramee (25 points, 10 as
sists) and Novian Whitsitt (26
points). The tournament's Most
Valuable Player was Cardinal for
ward Earl Koberlein. who led Stan
ford with 28 points and 14 rebounds.
He also shot 80 percent (8-for-10)
from the floor.
Brigham Young, the tallest team in
the tournament, overcame a 15-4
deficit to defeat Pacific, 72-63, in the
consolation game and evened its
record at 1-1. Pacific, trying to shake
the memories of a 3-27 record last
season, fell to 0-3.
The talk of the tournament,
however, was Stanford and the way it
disposed of a La Salle team most
Cardinal players agreed will be in the
postseason tournament picture by
season's end. But it was also a La
Salle team playing without 6-foot-9,
215-pound center Albert "Truck"
Butts, who was declared ineligible
last week for playing in high school
after his 20th birthday.
"The bottom line is that we did
play them without their very, very
fine center. Truck Butts," Davis said.
"We're also aware they were playing
the last game of a (three-game) road
trip. But at the same time, it's such a
great win for this young team. I'm
very proud of them."
It didn't take very sophisticated
knowledge of basketball to figure out
where Stanford beat La Salle — the
free-throw line.
It wasn't that the Explorers missed
free throws — they missed only one
and outshot the Cardinal at the line,
83.3 to 72.2 percent. It was that the
Explorers didn't shoot many. Stan

ford shot 36. La Salle shot six.
Stanford shot most of them, 20 to
be exact, in the final six minutes and
21 seconds of the game, after Davis
decided to protect a 66-55 lead with
his famed "The Roll" delay game.
Junior guard Keith Ramee took con
trol of the ball — and the game. "The
Roll" isolated Ramee on the right
side of the court and let him go one
on-one against his defender.
"It takes a really good defensive
player to guard somebody one-on
one," said Ramee, who scored nine
straight points after Stanford went
into its delay game. "1 look good, but
it's the guys off the ball that make it
work"
Ramee hit a pair of free throws
with 6:21 left, then converted a
three-point play, a lay-in and two
more free throws to give the Cardinal
a 75-59 lead with 4:22 to go. Nine
seconds later. Black — La Salle's big
gest offensive threat — fouled out,
and the Explorers were history.
Stanford got in position to ice the
game with "The Roll" by rattling La
Salle with its full-court press and rat
tling the basket with piping-hot
shooting.
"Stanford showed us one of the
best presses in the country; 40
minutes of pressure," La Salle Coach
Dave "Lefty" Ervin said. "I haven't
seen a better press in three or four
years. And Stanford shot as well as
[it] possibly could. I'll be surprised if
[it has] another shooting night like
that this season."
The Cardinal made 15 of 23 shots
(65.2 percent) in the second half and
29 of 48 in the game (60.4 percent),
many of which were, uncharacteristi
cally, from the 12- to 15-foot range.
Once again, Stanford spread the
scoring around — three players
scored 14 points and a fourth had 13.
No Cardinal player has scored more
than 16 points in a game this season.

"At first, it was hard (breaking La
Salle's 1-3-1 zone defense) because
(6-5) Steve Black was playing at the
top," said Whitsitt, Stanford's leading
scorer with a 14 points-per-game
average. "But after a while, it started
breaking down because they got
tired."
Stanford broke open a close game,
one that was tied nine times in the
first half, during a four-minute stretch
in the second half. Five Cardinal
players scored in a 12-4 run that gave
it a 61-49 lead with 10:21 remaining.
Koberlein started the surge with a
twisting foltr-footer from the left side,
followed by a hook from the right
"baseline that freshman center Eric
Reveno said he "made up as I went
along." Two minutes later, another
freshman, 6-11 forward Greg Butler,
helped out with an eight-footer in the
lane that made it 56-47.
"1 thought that was our best game
by far," Davis said of his team, which
outrebounded La Salle, 33-22, and
outshot it, 60.4 to 53.1 percent. "We
played some really good minutes
against Pacific last night (Friday), but
we got rattled at times."
Against the Tigers, Stanford shot
64 percent from the floor in the first
half and went into the locker room
with a 40-22 lead. But in the second
half, the Cardinal had what Davis
called "a few moments," turning the
ball over 14 times and scoring only 26
points.
Stanford had a 51 -28 advantage, its
biggest of the night, with 13:40 left in
the game. However, it was then that
the roof started to crack and, thanks
to Pacific's poor free-throw shooting,
it didn't fall in.
The Tigers scored 13 staight points
in a four-minute stretch to cut Stan
ford's lead to 10 with 9:23 to go.
They narrowed it to nine with 5:07

left, but could have been as close as
three had they not missed the front
ends of three one-and-one free throw
opportunities. For the game, Pacific
1 made 13 of 25 free throws (52 per
cent) and 20 of 47 field goals (42.6
percent).

"Once you get that lead, it's hard
to keep that drive," Davis said. "And
the younger you are, the bigger a
problem it is. We've got to work on
that, because anytime we get a lead,
we've got to hold onto it."
Two incidents in particular helped
spice up an otherwise boring game.
Minutes into the game, Koberlein
took the ball on the right side and
went in for a one-hand slam dunk, the
first of his career. "All the guys in my

fraternity were giving me crap about
not having a dunk," said Koberlein, a
junior who finished the game with a
team-high 14 points. "I finally got
one tonight."
Midway through the second half,
Davis took center stage. After a few
calls — or lack of them — by the offi
cials. Davis argued a charging foul on
Ramee a little too vehemently and
drew a rare technical foul.
People have constantly reminded
the Stanford basketball team that
four of its top players from last year's
19-12 team aren't around this year.
And that more than 70 percent of the
offense is gone as well. And that only
one senior is in the starting lineup.
But somebody forgot to tell the
Cardinal that it's not supposed to win
games like it did Saturday night,
when it defeated La Salle University,
83-72, to win the four-team Apple
Invitational Tournament. And the
scary thing about it is that Stanford
handled La Salle (of Philadelphia),
considered to be one of the top teams
on the East Coast, with relative ease.
When Stanford Coach Tom Davis
put the "pine patrol" into the game
with a little more than two minutes
left, the score was 83-65. Had he left
the regulars in, the Cardinal probably
would have beaten the Explorers by
more than 20 points.
Davis didn't take an "I-told-you
so" attitude after the victory, simply
because he hasn't been telling
anybody so. Davis, in fact, was nearly
as surprised with the his team's per
formance as the crowd was.
"I thought it was an exceptional
win because La Salle played a very
good game," Davis said. "It wasn't a
case of them not playing very well. To
be quite honest, we are playing better
than we thought we would at this
point."
Stanford, which won for the second
time in its tournament's four-year
history, beat the University of the
Pacific, 66-53, in Friday night's first
game and then beat La Salle to
remain undefeated after three games.
La Salle, which dropped to 2-2,
earned the right to play Stanford for
the first-place trophy — a clock on a
slab of redwood — by defeating Brig
ham Young University, 74-73, on a

last-second tip-in by All-Tournament
forward Ralph Lewis.
Lewis was joined on the all
tourney team by teammate Steve
Black (who had a two-game total of
42 points), Brigham Young's Timo
Saarelainen (47 points) and Stan
ford's Keith Ramee (25 points, 10 as

decided to protect a 66-55 lead with
his famed "The Roll" delay game.
Junior guard Keith Ramee took con
trol of the ball — and the game. "The
Roll" isolated Ramee on the right
side of the court and let him go one
on-one against his defender.
"It takes a really good defensive
player to guard somebody one-on
one," said Ramee, who scored nine
straight points after Stanford went
into its delay game. "1 look good, but
it's the guys off the ball that make it
work"
Ramee hit a pair of free throws
with 6:21 left, then converted a
three-point play, a lay-in and two
more free throws to give the Cardinal
a 75-59 lead with 4:22 to go. Nine
seconds later. Black — La Salle's big
gest offensive threat — fouled out,
and the Explorers were history.
Stanford got in position to ice the
game with "The Roll" by rattling La
Salle with its full-court press and rat
tling the basket with piping-hot
shooting.
"Stanford showed us one of the
best presses in the country; 40
minutes of pressure," La Salle Coach
Dave "Lefty" Ervin said. "I haven't
seen a better press in three or four
years. And Stanford shot as well as
[it] possibly could. I'll be surprised if
[it has] another shooting night like
that this season."
The Cardinal made 15 of 23 shots
(65.2 percent) in the second half and
29 of 48 in the game (60.4 percent),
many of which were, uncharacteristi
cally, from the 12- to 15-foot range.
Once again, Stanford spread the
scoring around — three players
scored 14 points and a fourth had 13.
No Cardinal player has scored more
than 16 points in a game this season.

"At first, it was hard (breaking La
Salle's 1-3-1 zone defense) because
(6-5) Steve Black was playing at the
top," said Whitsitt, Stanford's leading
scorer with a 14 points-per-game
average. "But after a while, it started
breaking down because they got
tired."
Stanford broke open a close game,
one that was tied nine times in the
first half, during a four-minute stretch
in the second half. Five Cardinal
players scored in a 12-4 run that gave
it a 61-49 lead with 10:21 remaining.
Koberlein started the surge with a
twisting foltr-footer from the left side,
followed by a hook from the right
"baseline that freshman center Eric
Reveno said he "made up as I went
along." Two minutes later, another
freshman, 6-11 forward Greg Butler,
helped out with an eight-footer in the
lane that made it 56-47.
"1 thought that was our best game
by far," Davis said of his team, which
outrebounded La Salle, 33-22, and
outshot it, 60.4 to 53.1 percent. "We
played some really good minutes
against Pacific last night (Friday), but
we got rattled at times."
Against the Tigers, Stanford shot
64 percent from the floor in the first
half and went into the locker room
with a 40-22 lead. But in the second
half, the Cardinal had what Davis
called "a few moments," turning the
ball over 14 times and scoring only 26
points.
Stanford had a 51 -28 advantage, its
biggest of the night, with 13:40 left in
the game. However, it was then that
the roof started to crack and, thanks
to Pacific's poor free-throw shooting,
it didn't fall in.
The Tigers scored 13 staight points
in a four-minute stretch to cut Stan
ford's lead to 10 with 9:23 to go.
They narrowed it to nine with 5:07

left, but could have been as close as
three had they not missed the front
ends of three one-and-one free throw
opportunities. For the game, Pacific
1 made 13 of 25 free throws (52 per
cent) and 20 of 47 field goals (42.6
percent).

"Once you get that lead, it's hard
to keep that drive," Davis said. "And
the younger you are, the bigger a
problem it is. We've got to work on
that, because anytime we get a lead,
we've got to hold onto it."
Two incidents in particular helped
spice up an otherwise boring game.
Minutes into the game, Koberlein
took the ball on the right side and
went in for a one-hand slam dunk, the
first of his career. "All the guys in my

fraternity were giving me crap about
not having a dunk," said Koberlein, a
junior who finished the game with a
team-high 14 points. "I finally got
one tonight."
Midway through the second half,
Davis took center stage. After a few
calls — or lack of them — by the offi
cials. Davis argued a charging foul on
Ramee a little too vehemently and
drew a rare technical foul.
People have constantly reminded
the Stanford basketball team that
four of its top players from last year's
19-12 team aren't around this year.
And that more than 70 percent of the
offense is gone as well. And that only
one senior is in the starting lineup.
But somebody forgot to tell the
Cardinal that it's not supposed to win
games like it did Saturday night,
when it defeated La Salle University,
83-72, to win the four-team Apple
Invitational Tournament. And the
scary thing about it is that Stanford
handled La Salle (of Philadelphia),
considered to be one of the top teams
on the East Coast, with relative ease.
When Stanford Coach Tom Davis
put the "pine patrol" into the game
with a little more than two minutes
left, the score was 83-65. Had he left
the regulars in, the Cardinal probably
would have beaten the Explorers by
more than 20 points.
Davis didn't take an "I-told-you
so" attitude after the victory, simply
because he hasn't been telling
anybody so. Davis, in fact, was nearly
as surprised with the his team's per
formance as the crowd was.
"I thought it was an exceptional
win because La Salle played a very
good game," Davis said. "It wasn't a
case of them not playing very well. To
be quite honest, we are playing better
than we thought we would at this
point."
Stanford, which won for the second
time in its tournament's four-year
history, beat the University of the
Pacific, 66-53, in Friday night's first
game and then beat La Salle to
remain undefeated after three games.
La Salle, which dropped to 2-2,
earned the right to play Stanford for
the first-place trophy — a clock on a
slab of redwood — by defeating Brig
ham Young University, 74-73, on a

last-second tip-in by All-Tournament
forward Ralph Lewis.
Lewis was joined on the all
tourney team by teammate Steve
Black (who had a two-game total of
42 points), Brigham Young's Timo
Saarelainen (47 points) and Stan
ford's Keith Ramee (25 points, 10 as
sists) and Novian Whitsitt (26
points). The tournament's Most
Valuable Player was Cardinal for
ward Earl Koberlein. who led Stan
ford with 28 points and 14 rebounds.
He also shot 80 percent (8-for-10)
from the floor.
Brigham Young, the tallest team in
the tournament, overcame a 15-4
deficit to defeat Pacific, 72-63, in the
consolation game and evened its
record at 1-1. Pacific, trying to shake
the memories of a 3-27 record last
season, fell to 0-3.
The talk of the tournament,
however, was Stanford and the way it
disposed of a La Salle team most
Cardinal players agreed will be in the
postseason tournament picture by
season's end. But it was also a La
Salle team playing without 6-foot-9,
215-pound center Albert "Truck"
Butts, who was declared ineligible
last week for playing in high school
after his 20th birthday.
"The bottom line is that we did
play them without their very, very
fine center. Truck Butts," Davis said.
"We're also aware they were playing
the last game of a (three-game) road
trip. But at the same time, it's such a
great win for this young team. I'm
very proud of them."
It didn't take very sophisticated
knowledge of basketball to figure out
where Stanford beat La Salle — the
free-throw line.
It wasn't that the Explorers missed
free throws — they missed only one
and outshot the Cardinal at the line,
83.3 to 72.2 percent. It was that the
Explorers didn't shoot many. Stan

ford shot 36. La Salle shot six.
Stanford shot most of them, 20 to
be exact, in the final six minutes and
21 seconds of the game, after Davis
decided to protect a 66-55 lead with
his famed "The Roll" delay game.
Junior guard Keith Ramee took con
trol of the ball — and the game. "The
Roll" isolated Ramee on the right
