# Koberlein's award surprising

### JASON COLE Daily staff 
At halftime of Saturday's Apple
Invitational championship game,
KSFO radio announcer Bob Murphy
and Stanford President Donald Ken
nedy surprised some students with
the news that they had won the right
to buy Super Bowl tickets.
The Stanford men's basketball

team was also surprising the Maples
Pavilion crowd with its tenacious
defense, on which it had built a 35-31
halftime lead over favored La Salle.
But amid all these surprises, public
address announcer Art Snyder not
so-surprisingly informed the crowd
that perennial powerhouse Bel
larmine Prep High School had
defeated Oak Grove High School in

the semi-finals of the Central Coast
Section football playoffs.
At least most of the crowd wasn't
too surprised to hear of Bellarmine's
victory, but Stanford forward Earl
Koberlein did get one of his many
pleasant surprises during that night.
Oak Grove was California's No. 1-
ranked team going into the game, but
Koberlein's alma mater rose from its
underdog status to earn a berth into
the CCS finals.
During the rest of the night,
Koberlein made an incredible,
falling-on-his side jump shot, led his
team to an 84-73 victory and the
tournament championship, and earned
the tournament's Most Valuable
Player award.
But Koberlein was hardly the shoo
in for the MVP award. In fact, he was
among four players who received
votes, narrowly edging out teammate
Keith Ramee and La Salle's Steve
Black by one and two votes,
respectively.
Within reasonable argument,
Koberlein could have been com
pletely left off the All-Tournament
Team and no one would have
noticed. As Snyder announced the
tourney honors and culminated them
with the MVP award, the wide-eyed,
exasperated look on Koberlein's face
told the story.
