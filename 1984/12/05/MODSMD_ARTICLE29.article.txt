# Koberlein's award surprising
## 
### JASON COLE Daily staff 
At halftime of Saturday's Apple
Invitational championship game,
KSFO radio announcer Bob Murphy
and Stanford President Donald Ken
nedy surprised some students with
the news that they had won the right
to buy Super Bowl tickets.
The Stanford men's basketball

team was also surprising the Maples
Pavilion crowd with its tenacious
defense, on which it had built a 35-31
halftime lead over favored La Salle.
But amid all these surprises, public
address announcer Art Snyder not
so-surprisingly informed the crowd
that perennial powerhouse Bel
larmine Prep High School had
defeated Oak Grove High School in

the semi-finals of the Central Coast
Section football playoffs.
At least most of the crowd wasn't
too surprised to hear of Bellarmine's
victory, but Stanford forward Earl
Koberlein did get one of his many
pleasant surprises during that night.
Oak Grove was California's No. 1-
ranked team going into the game, but
Koberlein's alma mater rose from its
underdog status to earn a berth into
the CCS finals.
During the rest of the night,
Koberlein made an incredible,
falling-on-his side jump shot, led his
team to an 84-73 victory and the
tournament championship, and earned
the tournament's Most Valuable
Player award.
But Koberlein was hardly the shoo
in for the MVP award. In fact, he was
among four players who received
votes, narrowly edging out teammate
Keith Ramee and La Salle's Steve
Black by one and two votes,
respectively.
Within reasonable argument,
Koberlein could have been com
pletely left off the All-Tournament
Team and no one would have
noticed. As Snyder announced the
tourney honors and culminated them
with the MVP award, the wide-eyed,
exasperated look on Koberlein's face
told the story.
"I never dreamed that I would win
it (MVP). When you have such a


lohii Phillips/Daily
Apple Invitational Most Valuable Plav«*> 1 "nherlein s.iiH he "never
balanced scoring attack . . . with
everybody contributing, I just didn't
know who was going to win it,"
Koberlein said.
The way Stanford played, any one
of at least three players could have
won the MVP award, but Koberlein
played the most consistently in two
games which featured consumate
team play by the Cardinal.
In the two games against the Uni
versity of the Pacific and La Salle,
Koberlein led Stanford in scoring
with 28 points and 14 rebounds,
hardly awe-inspiring statistics. Espe
cially when you consider that three
other Cardinal players scored 20 or
more points in the same span.
But Koberlein's dedication,
defense and inspiration may have
been the edge that got him the award.
As Coach Tom Davis explained, "I'm
really happy for Earl. He's dedicated
himself to having a good year and it's
nice to see it pay off for him."
On defense, Koberlein had four
steals in the two games, including a
game-high three against La Salle, and
when he discusses Stanford's full
court press defense, he gets this al
most devilish look of glee on his face.
"Defense is my biggest thrill,"
Koberlein said. "I love seeing teams
get out of their offense. Seeing them
panic."
Defense may be the key to Stan
ford's success this season, according
to Koberlein. "We don't have the tal
ent to go out and play with a lot of
teams, so we have to have gimmicks
(like a constant full-court press) to
win," he said.
But as inspired as Koberlein's
defense may have been, it may have
been his inspiring offensive that made
him standout from the rest. In
Friday's game, Koberlein brought the
crowd to its feet with a fast-break
dunk over a UOP player.
On Saturday, during the first half
with the score tied at 31, Koberlein
was fouled by La Salle's Steve Black
and nearly went after Black in a fit of
excitement. "I was just excited and
got caught up in the game," he said a
little sheepishly.
Koberlein hit the two free throws

and then added two more to give the
Cardinal its halftime lead and La
Salle was never able to tie the game
again. Then in the second half, just to
add insult to injury, he started a five
point run with a short jump shot in
which he was "clipped" as he went
up.
The shot again brought the crowd
to its feet and the run put the Car

dinal ahead by 11 with 13 minutes
and 34 seconds remaining.
"It was pretty much a lucky shot,"
Koberlein said. "I had good follow
through, though, and it just went
through." As he finished the state
ment, he gave a little shrug, as if to
say "I was surprised too." His look
seemed to fit the whole evening.

Oak Grove was California's No. 1-
ranked team going into the game, but
Koberlein's alma mater rose from its
underdog status to earn a berth into
the CCS finals.
During the rest of the night,
Koberlein made an incredible,
falling-on-his side jump shot, led his
team to an 84-73 victory and the
tournament championship, and earned
the tournament's Most Valuable
Player award.
But Koberlein was hardly the shoo
in for the MVP award. In fact, he was
among four players who received
votes, narrowly edging out teammate
Keith Ramee and La Salle's Steve
Black by one and two votes,
respectively.
Within reasonable argument,
Koberlein could have been com
pletely left off the All-Tournament
Team and no one would have
noticed. As Snyder announced the
tourney honors and culminated them
with the MVP award, the wide-eyed,
exasperated look on Koberlein's face
told the story.
"I never dreamed that I would win
it (MVP). When you have such a


lohii Phillips/Daily
Apple Invitational Most Valuable Plav«*> 1 "nherlein s.iiH he "never
balanced scoring attack . . . with
everybody contributing, I just didn't
know who was going to win it,"
Koberlein said.
The way Stanford played, any one
of at least three players could have
won the MVP award, but Koberlein
played the most consistently in two
games which featured consumate
team play by the Cardinal.
In the two games against the Uni
versity of the Pacific and La Salle,
Koberlein led Stanford in scoring
with 28 points and 14 rebounds,
hardly awe-inspiring statistics. Espe
cially when you consider that three
other Cardinal players scored 20 or
more points in the same span.
But Koberlein's dedication,
defense and inspiration may have
been the edge that got him the award.
As Coach Tom Davis explained, "I'm
really happy for Earl. He's dedicated
himself to having a good year and it's
nice to see it pay off for him."
On defense, Koberlein had four
steals in the two games, including a
game-high three against La Salle, and
when he discusses Stanford's full
court press defense, he gets this al
most devilish look of glee on his face.
"Defense is my biggest thrill,"
Koberlein said. "I love seeing teams
get out of their offense. Seeing them
panic."
Defense may be the key to Stan
ford's success this season, according
to Koberlein. "We don't have the tal
ent to go out and play with a lot of
teams, so we have to have gimmicks
(like a constant full-court press) to
win," he said.
But as inspired as Koberlein's
defense may have been, it may have
been his inspiring offensive that made
him standout from the rest. In
Friday's game, Koberlein brought the
crowd to its feet with a fast-break
dunk over a UOP player.
On Saturday, during the first half
with the score tied at 31, Koberlein
was fouled by La Salle's Steve Black
and nearly went after Black in a fit of
excitement. "I was just excited and
got caught up in the game," he said a
little sheepishly.
Koberlein hit the two free throws

and then added two more to give the
Cardinal its halftime lead and La
Salle was never able to tie the game
again. Then in the second half, just to
add insult to injury, he started a five
point run with a short jump shot in
which he was "clipped" as he went
up.
The shot again brought the crowd
to its feet and the run put the Car

dinal ahead by 11 with 13 minutes
and 34 seconds remaining.
"It was pretty much a lucky shot,"
Koberlein said. "I had good follow
through, though, and it just went
through." As he finished the state
ment, he gave a little shrug, as if to
say "I was surprised too." His look
seemed to fit the whole evening.

In the Apple Invitational, Earl Koberlein got the first one-handed dunk
of his three-year Stanford career.
At halftime of Saturday's Apple
Invitational championship game,
KSFO radio announcer Bob Murphy
and Stanford President Donald Ken
nedy surprised some students with
the news that they had won the right
to buy Super Bowl tickets.
The Stanford men's basketball

team was also surprising the Maples
Pavilion crowd with its tenacious
defense, on which it had built a 35-31
halftime lead over favored La Salle.
But amid all these surprises, public
address announcer Art Snyder not
so-surprisingly informed the crowd
that perennial powerhouse Bel
larmine Prep High School had
defeated Oak Grove High School in

the semi-finals of the Central Coast
Section football playoffs.
At least most of the crowd wasn't
too surprised to hear of Bellarmine's
victory, but Stanford forward Earl
Koberlein did get one of his many
pleasant surprises during that night.
