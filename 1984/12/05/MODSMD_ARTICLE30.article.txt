# Fourth consecutive victory at Maples over St. Louis
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
The Stanford basketball team had a
lot of things on its mind before last
night's home game against the Uni
versity of Missouri at St. Louis. The
UMSL Rivermen weren't one of
them.
So instead of blowing out the
Rivermen in the first half, Stanford
regrouped in the locker room at
halftime and blew them out in the
second before a Dead Week crowd of
3,817. The Cardinal, which improved
its record to 4-0, led by 20 with three
minutes remaining, but a last-gasp
run by UMSL cut the Cardinal's vic
tory margin to 86-72.
"I think they were ready and we
weren't," Stanford Coach Tom Davis
said. "They came out roaring and did
an excellent job. We came out think
ing that we'd win because we beat La
Salle" to win the Apple Invitational
Tournament Saturday.
Junior forward F.arl Koberlein,
who led Stanford with a career-high
23 points, agreed with his coach. "We
weren't up for it,"he said. "We were
really excited about winning the
tournament, and we're not the type of
team that can come out and simply
beat teams with talent."
The Rivermen jumped to a lead of
16-8 thanks to some hot shooting and
more than a few turnovers by Stan
ford. The Cardinal didn't lead until
late in the half, when it went in front,
29-28, on a pair of free throws by
Charles Hunt with 3:36 remaining.
Stanford then proceeded to blow
the game open with 16 unanswered
points, six at the end of the first half
and 10 straight at the beginning of the
second. After UMSL took a 35-33
lead, Koberlein hit two free throws
and then added a four-foot bank shot.
Hunt, who scored a career-high 12
points, hit two more free throws (he
was 8-for-8 in the game) to give Stan
ford a 39-33 halftime lead.

Koberlein and guard Keith Ramee
each scored two baskets in a 10-0 run
at the start of the second period that
put Stanford ahead to stay, 49-35.
The Rivermen, who fell to 3-3, never
got closer than nine the rest of the
way.
"I was pleased just with the way
they (Stanford) hung in there, the
way they didn't get disrupted," Davis
said. "This team (UMSL) did some
interesting things. They changed
defenses regularly and did different
things on offense. But we adjusted to
them well."
Stanford did some interesting
things of its own in the first half, like
shooting 38.7 percent from the floor
and turning the ball over 11 times,
many on sure scoring opportunities.
But a Davis halftime talk, and
changes in the Cardinal's defense and
pressing schemes, made the differ
ence in the second period.
Besides Koberlein and Hunt, for
ward Andy Fischer, with 10 points,
was the only other Cardinal in double
figures, while center Kent Seymour
and guard Novian Whitsitt had nine
apiece. Most of Stanford's scoring
came from inside, as 66 of the its 86
points were scored by either forwards
or centers. Seymour also blocked four
shots, bringing his season total to 13
— more than any Cardinal player
blocked all last season.
Stanford now has two weeks off
before its next game, a Dec. 18 road
date at St. Mary's College in
Moraga. Then it's back home for
games against Seattle University
(Dec. 19), Loyola Marymount Uni
versity (Dec. 21) and the University
of California at Riverside (Dec. 24).
The Cardinal's final tuneup before
its Pacific 10 Conference opener at
the University of Wasington (Jan. 3)
will be in the four-team Longhorn
Classic tournament at the University
of Texas (Dec. 28 and 29).

ford. The Cardinal didn't lead until
late in the half, when it went in front,
29-28, on a pair of free throws by
Charles Hunt with 3:36 remaining.
Stanford then proceeded to blow
the game open with 16 unanswered
points, six at the end of the first half
and 10 straight at the beginning of the
second. After UMSL took a 35-33
lead, Koberlein hit two free throws
and then added a four-foot bank shot.
Hunt, who scored a career-high 12
points, hit two more free throws (he
was 8-for-8 in the game) to give Stan
ford a 39-33 halftime lead.

Koberlein and guard Keith Ramee
each scored two baskets in a 10-0 run
at the start of the second period that
put Stanford ahead to stay, 49-35.
The Rivermen, who fell to 3-3, never
got closer than nine the rest of the
way.
"I was pleased just with the way
they (Stanford) hung in there, the
way they didn't get disrupted," Davis
said. "This team (UMSL) did some
interesting things. They changed
defenses regularly and did different
things on offense. But we adjusted to
them well."
Stanford did some interesting
things of its own in the first half, like
shooting 38.7 percent from the floor
and turning the ball over 11 times,
many on sure scoring opportunities.
But a Davis halftime talk, and
changes in the Cardinal's defense and
pressing schemes, made the differ
ence in the second period.
Besides Koberlein and Hunt, for
ward Andy Fischer, with 10 points,
was the only other Cardinal in double
figures, while center Kent Seymour
and guard Novian Whitsitt had nine
apiece. Most of Stanford's scoring
came from inside, as 66 of the its 86
points were scored by either forwards
or centers. Seymour also blocked four
shots, bringing his season total to 13
— more than any Cardinal player
blocked all last season.
Stanford now has two weeks off
before its next game, a Dec. 18 road
date at St. Mary's College in
Moraga. Then it's back home for
games against Seattle University
(Dec. 19), Loyola Marymount Uni
versity (Dec. 21) and the University
of California at Riverside (Dec. 24).
The Cardinal's final tuneup before
its Pacific 10 Conference opener at
the University of Wasington (Jan. 3)
will be in the four-team Longhorn
Classic tournament at the University
of Texas (Dec. 28 and 29).
