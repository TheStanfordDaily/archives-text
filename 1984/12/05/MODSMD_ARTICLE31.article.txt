# Which Expedition member was that? Lewis or Black?

### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
About the only way you can tell La Salle University
basketball players Ralph Lewis and Steve Black apart
is by the number on their jerseys. Lewis wears 11 and
Black 22.
Other than that, they might as well be clones. Lewis
is tall and slender (6-foot-6, 200 pounds). So is Black
(6-4, 185). Lewis has his hair cut close to his head with
a part on the left side. Ditto with Black.
And you won't tell them apart by the way they play,
either. Lewis may shoot more inside shots and get a
few more rebounds, but that's because he plays for
ward and Black plays guard. Both have virtually un
stoppable, pull-up-in-traffic-and-shoot-it jumpers and
more moves than most gigolos. And both score — in
basketball, that is — with similar regularity. Which is a
lot.
In La Salle's four games, Black is averaging 20.5
points per game and Lewis 19. Together, the two ac
count for 54 percent of the Explorers' offense, making
them one of the nation's top guard-forward scoring
tandems.
Lewis and Black, referred to as the Explorers'
"Lewis and Black Expedition" around Philadephia,
are also roommates. And, no joke, Black is going out
with Lewis' sister.
Both are team captains, and being seniors, they're
the guys La Salle looks to when the Explorers are ex
ploring the possibility of losing a game. "As captains,
we feel like we have to take a leadership role," Black
says. "If things aren't going right, we feel like we have
to lead the way."

1 hat was the case in La Salle's first game of a West
Coast road trip that ended Saturday night with an 84-
73 loss to Stanford in the finals of the Apple Invita
tional Tournament. The Explorers found themselves
behind St. Mary's College (of Moraga) 37-21 early in
the second half. Then Lewis and Black took over, with
a long-range jumper here or a tomahawk slam dunk
there. A few minutes and a few more jumpers and
dunks later, St. Mary's led by only two, 41-39.
But Lewis and Black cooled off and La Salle went on
to lose by 10. As far as La Salle was concerned, the loss
to the Gaels was an upset. "Stevie and I held a (players
only) team meeting in our hotel room the next day,"
Lewis said. "We just got together to discuss our loss to
St. Mary's and regroup for the tournament."
Whatever it was they said worked. La Salle came
from behind to beat a taller and more disciplined Brig
ham Young University team in the opening round of
the Apple tournament. But it was how they defeated
the Cougars that was so, well, typical for the Explorers.
With nine seconds to go and La Salle on the short
end of a 73-71 score, Explorer forward Larry Koretz
was fouled. He went to the line and sunk his first free
throw He missed the second one, but Lewis slipped in
from the left side and tipped it in to give La Salle a 74-
73 lead — its only one of the second half. BYU
couldn't score in the remaining seconds, and the 74-73
score was a final.
"When he made the first foul shot, I got in there
pretty easy," Lewis said. "The second time I did the
same thing as I did on the first one. I just jumped a
little higher than he (BYU's Timo
Saarelainen) did and got the tip."
So what was Black's role in all this?
He just scored 30 points — 20 in the
second half — and shot 56.5 percent
(13-of-23) from the floor.
"He does it all in there," Black said
of his roommate. "When I saw him
get his hand on it, I knew it was going
in. He even put a little English (spin)
on it."
La Salle Coach Dave "Lefty" Er
vin, however, claims he doesn't actu
ally call on Lewis and Black when he
needs those 20 second-half points or
that last-second tip-in. "I think the
natural flow of the offense just goes
their way," Ervin said. "They're our
money guys."
Natural or not, Lewis and espe
cially Black pose all kinds of prob
lems for opposing coaches. Stanford
Coach Tom Davis, for one, said he
didn't even consider playing man-to
man — the Cardinal's best defense —
against La Salle because of Lewis and
Black, whom he called "without any
question" professional basketball
prospects.
"He's almost unstoppable," Davis
said of Black, who had an off night
against Stanford, scoring only 12
points before fouling out with 4:13
left. "I don't know how you stop him.
He'll go around you, over you or
through you. He's calm and just
keeps coming at you."
So what are the future plans for
Lewis and Black? Will the Lewis and
Black Expedition venture into the
National Basketball Association?
"That would be nice," Black said.

"That would be nice," Black said.

La Salle's Ralph Lewis (11) led his teammates and the Cardinal in
rebounding (8) and scoring (21 points).
About the only way you can tell La Salle University
basketball players Ralph Lewis and Steve Black apart
is by the number on their jerseys. Lewis wears 11 and
Black 22.
Other than that, they might as well be clones. Lewis
is tall and slender (6-foot-6, 200 pounds). So is Black
(6-4, 185). Lewis has his hair cut close to his head with
a part on the left side. Ditto with Black.
And you won't tell them apart by the way they play,
either. Lewis may shoot more inside shots and get a
few more rebounds, but that's because he plays for
ward and Black plays guard. Both have virtually un
stoppable, pull-up-in-traffic-and-shoot-it jumpers and
more moves than most gigolos. And both score — in
basketball, that is — with similar regularity. Which is a
lot.
In La Salle's four games, Black is averaging 20.5
points per game and Lewis 19. Together, the two ac
count for 54 percent of the Explorers' offense, making
them one of the nation's top guard-forward scoring
tandems.
Lewis and Black, referred to as the Explorers'
"Lewis and Black Expedition" around Philadephia,
are also roommates. And, no joke, Black is going out
with Lewis' sister.
Both are team captains, and being seniors, they're
the guys La Salle looks to when the Explorers are ex
ploring the possibility of losing a game. "As captains,
we feel like we have to take a leadership role," Black
says. "If things aren't going right, we feel like we have
to lead the way."

1 hat was the case in La Salle's first game of a West
Coast road trip that ended Saturday night with an 84-
73 loss to Stanford in the finals of the Apple Invita
tional Tournament. The Explorers found themselves
behind St. Mary's College (of Moraga) 37-21 early in
the second half. Then Lewis and Black took over, with
a long-range jumper here or a tomahawk slam dunk
there. A few minutes and a few more jumpers and
dunks later, St. Mary's led by only two, 41-39.
But Lewis and Black cooled off and La Salle went on
to lose by 10. As far as La Salle was concerned, the loss
to the Gaels was an upset. "Stevie and I held a (players
only) team meeting in our hotel room the next day,"
Lewis said. "We just got together to discuss our loss to
St. Mary's and regroup for the tournament."
Whatever it was they said worked. La Salle came
from behind to beat a taller and more disciplined Brig
ham Young University team in the opening round of
the Apple tournament. But it was how they defeated
the Cougars that was so, well, typical for the Explorers.
With nine seconds to go and La Salle on the short
end of a 73-71 score, Explorer forward Larry Koretz
was fouled. He went to the line and sunk his first free
throw He missed the second one, but Lewis slipped in
from the left side and tipped it in to give La Salle a 74-
73 lead — its only one of the second half. BYU
couldn't score in the remaining seconds, and the 74-73
score was a final.
"When he made the first foul shot, I got in there
pretty easy," Lewis said. "The second time I did the
same thing as I did on the first one. I just jumped a
little higher than he (BYU's Timo
Saarelainen) did and got the tip."
So what was Black's role in all this?
He just scored 30 points — 20 in the
second half — and shot 56.5 percent
(13-of-23) from the floor.
"He does it all in there," Black said
of his roommate. "When I saw him
get his hand on it, I knew it was going
in. He even put a little English (spin)
on it."
La Salle Coach Dave "Lefty" Er
vin, however, claims he doesn't actu
ally call on Lewis and Black when he
needs those 20 second-half points or
that last-second tip-in. "I think the
natural flow of the offense just goes
their way," Ervin said. "They're our
money guys."
Natural or not, Lewis and espe
cially Black pose all kinds of prob
lems for opposing coaches. Stanford
Coach Tom Davis, for one, said he
didn't even consider playing man-to
man — the Cardinal's best defense —
against La Salle because of Lewis and
Black, whom he called "without any
question" professional basketball
prospects.
"He's almost unstoppable," Davis
said of Black, who had an off night
against Stanford, scoring only 12
points before fouling out with 4:13
left. "I don't know how you stop him.
He'll go around you, over you or
through you. He's calm and just
keeps coming at you."
So what are the future plans for
Lewis and Black? Will the Lewis and
Black Expedition venture into the
National Basketball Association?
"That would be nice," Black said.
