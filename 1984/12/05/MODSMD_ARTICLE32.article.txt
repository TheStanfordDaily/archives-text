# Volleyball team begins NCAA tourney
## 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
As the top seed in this season's
National Collegiate Athletic Associa
tion playoffs, the Stanford women's
volleyball team will begin its
postseason play this weekend witn a
match against Colorado State Uni
versity.
The top ranking has proven to be a
"disadvantage" for the Cardinal be
cause Stanford has been placed in the
Western Region, easily the "strongest
region," according to Cardinal Head
Coach Fred Sturm.
The Western Region teams that
remain in the tournament after the
first round include Stanford,
Colorado State, San Diego State Uni
versity and the University of South
ern California. San Diego State and
USC are seeded No. 5 and No. 8 in
the tournament, respectively.
Although Stanford has a tough
tournament schedule, Sturm said the
Cardinal has been well prepared by
Western Collegiate Athletic Associa
tion regular-season play.
"The fact that we had a strong
season will really help us," he said.
Stanford finished first in the WCAA
at 12-2. "There isn't a team in the
country that can match our (season)
schedule. We haven't gotten through
without out licks and lumps, but the
positives outweigh the negatives."
The regular season, Sturm said, is
"preparation for the tough competi
tion" in the playoffs. "We've seen
everybody. . . . There won't be any
surprises."
Stanford will play Colorado State
Friday at the regional site, San Diego
State University. It is a match Sturm
said Stanford "would be a fool" to
overlook. Colorado State defeated
the University of Arizona, 3-1, in the
first round while Stanford got a bye.

Colorado State is led by outside
h«tter Sherri Danielson, who leads the
nation in kill percentage per game
and has the fourth-highest hitting
percentage in the country at .403. "I
have a feeling they're going to be set- 1
ting her a lot," Sturm said.
Stanford Asst. Coach Don Shaw
said Danielson "can hit from all over
the court. She's consistent from any
position and is definitely their key."
Running a 5-1 offense for the
Rams will be setter Robin Williams,
who has led the nation in assists this
season, averaging 12.5 per match.
Colorado State will have to stop
Stanford's middle attack, led by Kim
Oden, the WCAA's Player of the
Year the past two seasons.
The Rams have experienced coach
ing as well, according to Sturm.
Colorado State Head Coach Rich
Feller is a former University of the
Pacific assistant coach. After two
years. Feller has helped the Rams to a
lOth-place national ranking.
If Stanford defeats Colorado State,
it will play the winner of the San
Diego State-USC match, which will
be played at 8 p.m. Friday. The Car
dinal split its league matches this
season with both San Diego State and
USC and probably would prefer not
to play San Diego State on its home
court.
The NCAA chose to have the
Western Region matches played at
San Diego State because San Diego
attracts large crowds — which has
worked to the host Aztec's advan
tage.
But Cardinal hitter Susan Compton
said Stanford is not concerned with
playing San Diego or USC.

ment, you have to beat everyone. We

have some tough early matches, but
you have to face [the better teams]
sometime. Why not get it over with?"
Stanford's "focus" on the tourna
ment, according to Sturm, is
"consistency in execution" — some
thing the Cardinal has lacked
recently. "We've had a semi-rough
six or seven days with final exams and
Dead Week," Sturm said.
"We're in a period of transition,"
Oden said. "We haven't played in a
while (since defeating Purdue Nov.
24), and it's hard to put full energy
into studying and volleyball at the
same time."
Practices have been "picking up,"
however. "Everybody is really geared
up," Compton said. "If we play our
best, and any other team plays [its]
best, there is no question that we will
win. We just have to play our best,
that's all."
Stanford finished second in the
Final Four last year. According to
Compton, "what hurt us last year was
that we wanted to win so much, it
scared us into losing."
The Final Four will match the win
ners of the West, Mideast, Northwest
and South Regions and will be played
Dec. 14 and 16 at UCLA's Pauley
Pavilion.
UCLA is seeded second in the
playoff tournament and will have to
defeat Duke University and the win
ner of the Eastern Kentucky
University-Lamar University match
to advance from the South regional to
the Final Four.

Stanford finished first in the WCAA
at 12-2. "There isn't a team in the
country that can match our (season)
schedule. We haven't gotten through
without out licks and lumps, but the
positives outweigh the negatives."
The regular season, Sturm said, is
"preparation for the tough competi
tion" in the playoffs. "We've seen
everybody. . . . There won't be any
surprises."
Stanford will play Colorado State
Friday at the regional site, San Diego
State University. It is a match Sturm
said Stanford "would be a fool" to
overlook. Colorado State defeated
the University of Arizona, 3-1, in the
first round while Stanford got a bye.

Colorado State is led by outside
h«tter Sherri Danielson, who leads the
nation in kill percentage per game
and has the fourth-highest hitting
percentage in the country at .403. "I
have a feeling they're going to be set- 1
ting her a lot," Sturm said.
Stanford Asst. Coach Don Shaw
said Danielson "can hit from all over
the court. She's consistent from any
position and is definitely their key."
Running a 5-1 offense for the
Rams will be setter Robin Williams,
who has led the nation in assists this
season, averaging 12.5 per match.
Colorado State will have to stop
Stanford's middle attack, led by Kim
Oden, the WCAA's Player of the
Year the past two seasons.
The Rams have experienced coach
ing as well, according to Sturm.
Colorado State Head Coach Rich
Feller is a former University of the
Pacific assistant coach. After two
years. Feller has helped the Rams to a
lOth-place national ranking.
If Stanford defeats Colorado State,
it will play the winner of the San
Diego State-USC match, which will
be played at 8 p.m. Friday. The Car
dinal split its league matches this
season with both San Diego State and
USC and probably would prefer not
to play San Diego State on its home
court.
The NCAA chose to have the
Western Region matches played at
San Diego State because San Diego
attracts large crowds — which has
worked to the host Aztec's advan
tage.
But Cardinal hitter Susan Compton
said Stanford is not concerned with
playing San Diego or USC.

have some tough early matches, but
you have to face [the better teams]
sometime. Why not get it over with?"
Stanford's "focus" on the tourna
ment, according to Sturm, is
"consistency in execution" — some
thing the Cardinal has lacked
recently. "We've had a semi-rough
six or seven days with final exams and
Dead Week," Sturm said.
"We're in a period of transition,"
Oden said. "We haven't played in a
while (since defeating Purdue Nov.
24), and it's hard to put full energy
into studying and volleyball at the
same time."
Practices have been "picking up,"
however. "Everybody is really geared
up," Compton said. "If we play our
best, and any other team plays [its]
best, there is no question that we will
win. We just have to play our best,
that's all."
Stanford finished second in the
Final Four last year. According to
Compton, "what hurt us last year was
that we wanted to win so much, it
scared us into losing."
The Final Four will match the win
ners of the West, Mideast, Northwest
and South Regions and will be played
Dec. 14 and 16 at UCLA's Pauley
Pavilion.
UCLA is seeded second in the
playoff tournament and will have to
defeat Duke University and the win
ner of the Eastern Kentucky
University-Lamar University match
to advance from the South regional to
the Final Four.
As the top seed in this season's
National Collegiate Athletic Associa
tion playoffs, the Stanford women's
volleyball team will begin its
postseason play this weekend witn a
match against Colorado State Uni
versity.
The top ranking has proven to be a
"disadvantage" for the Cardinal be
cause Stanford has been placed in the
Western Region, easily the "strongest
region," according to Cardinal Head
Coach Fred Sturm.
The Western Region teams that
remain in the tournament after the
first round include Stanford,
Colorado State, San Diego State Uni
versity and the University of South
ern California. San Diego State and
USC are seeded No. 5 and No. 8 in
the tournament, respectively.
Although Stanford has a tough
tournament schedule, Sturm said the
Cardinal has been well prepared by
Western Collegiate Athletic Associa
tion regular-season play.
"The fact that we had a strong
season will really help us," he said.
