# Card 'outplayed' in women's basketball
## Stanford the Waves' first victim, 71-65 
### JOHN LIS Daily staff 
By blowing a seven-point halftime
lead and losing 71-65 to under
manned Pepperdine University Sat
urday, the Stanford women's basket
ball team showed it cannot simply
walk onto the floor and pick up a vic
tory — even if it's more talented than
its opponent.
Pepperdine had only seven healthy
players suited up, and its No., 2
scorer, center Shawn Sturgeon, was
still playing with the Waves volleyball
team. Pepperdine proceeded to show
the same kind of intensity Stanford
had shown in winning its two previous
games. The Waves outscored the
Cardinal, 44-31, in the second half.
"They wanted it more than we
did," Stanford Asst. Coach Mike
Kehoe said. "They beat us in the
transition game and murdered us on
the weakside boards. They just out
hustled and outplayed us."
Cardinal Head Coach Dotty
McCrea was concerned with her
team's effort. "What I see is when in
dividuals don't have good games,
they step away. When things didn't go
well, they didn't get angry. They just
died. They waited for someone else to
start scoring.
"Pepperdine was prepared to play.
It was a typical Dead Week game (for
us)."
The Cardinal's last chance to pull
out a victory came with 30 seconds
left and Pepperdine leading 67-62.
Stanford forward Kim Mercer made
the first of two free throws and got
her rebound after missing the second.

A basket could have pulled the Car
dinal within two, but Mercer turned
the ball over, and the Waves made
four free throws at the end to close it
out.
The brightest spot for Stanford was
again the play of freshman forward
Kami Anderson. For the third
straight game, Anderson scored a
game-high 20 points, and, along with
guard Sue Sebolt, led the Cardinal
with seven rebounds.
Saturday's game also marked the
return of guard Virginia Sourlis, who
missed the game against San Jose
State University Nov. 27 with a hy
perextended knee. Wearing a knee
brace, Sourlis played 36 minutes and
scored 10 points.
Forward Mary Bradach scored in
double figures for the first time this
season, finishing with 12 points.
Bradach, who has had difficulties this
year, didn't catagorize her perfor
mance as particularly good, though.
"The fact was we overall played
poorly — I didn't feel I played that
differently just because I scored some
points," she said.
"We started off OK, then lost our
intensity," she continued. "We went
flat and didn't pick it up. It's some
thing we've got to figure out and
make sure doesn't happen again."
In addition to playing without in
tensity, the Cardinal had a poor
shooting night. Stanford made 38
percent from the field, and Bradach
was the only Cardinal to make more
than half her shots.
Stanford fell to 2-3 this season, and

Pepperdine went back to Malibu with
its first victory in five games. The
Cardinal gets Dead Week off before
traveling to face Fresno State Univer
sity Friday night. The Cardinal's last
home game of 1984 is Dec. 15 against
the University of San Francisco.
After Christmas, Stanford will visit
the Midwest and East, playing five

games before Winter Quarter begins.
The team will be in Columbus, Ohio,
for the Ohio State University Tourn
ament Dec. 28 and 29. The Cardinal
will open 1985 with games at
Lafayette College Jan. 2, Monmouth
College Jan. 4 and Seton Hall Uni
versity Jan. 6 to close out its non
conference schedule.
