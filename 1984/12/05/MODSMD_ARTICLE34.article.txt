# Rolex tennis tournament
## Gates-Eldridge triumph 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
The 1984 Rolex Northern Califor
nia Women's Collegiate Champion
ships finally ended yesterday, as the
top-seeded doubles pair of Linda
Gates and Leigh Anne Eldredge
defeated Stanford teammates Anna
Ivan and Patty Fendick in straight
sets, 6-2, 6-4.
Ivan, the No. 1 seed and a fresh
man, also won the singles champion
ship on Friday, defeating teammate
Stephanie Savides, 6-3, 6-0. "I was
really pleased with the way I played
(against Savides). I wasn't tentative
and I went for a lot of shots that I
don't normally go for," she said.
It was a different story for Ivan and
her partner, Fendick, in the doubles
match. "We got frustrated not by
what [Gates and Eldredge] were
doing, but by what we couldn't do,"
Ivan said. What they couldn't do
was "get the points."
Fendick is recovering from a spine
illness and has just recently begun
playing again. "They played well and
we were both off," Ivan said.
Despite the fact that Ivan and Fen
dick did not play up to their capabili
ties, the match featured some of the
best collegiate tennis in the country.
"The story on this match is in the
rankings," women's tennis Coach
Frank Brennan said. "All the players
on the court are ranked in the top 10
in the country. You can't get any bet
ter than that."
In the preseason Intercollegiate

Tennis Coaches Association poll,
Gates is ranked second, Fendick
third, Ivan sixth, and Eldredge ninth
in the nation.
Last year, Fendick and Eldredge
were the No. 1-ranked doubles team
in the country. However, the gradua
tion of Elise Burgin, who teamed with

Gates last year, broke up one of the
Cardinal's doubles teams and Bren
nan is looking for new combinations.
Eldredge and Gates advance along
with Ivan to the Rolex National In
door Intercollegiate Singles and
Doubles Championship Feb. 7-10 in
Houston, Texas.
