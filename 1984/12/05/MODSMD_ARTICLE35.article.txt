### PETER CASTILLO 
The Stanford wrestling team
will fly to Las Vegas, Nev. this
week for a quick study break â€”
the Caesar's Palace Invitational
Friday and Saturday.
This invitational will feature the
top 40 teams in the nation, includ
ing the University of Oklahoma,
lowa State University, Arizona
State University and Cal-State
Bakersfield.
Cardinal wrestlers traveling to
Las Vegas will be Neil Wartnik
(126 pounds), Jeff Bradley (134
pounds), Scott Wiggen (150
pounds), Pete Rogers (158
pounds) and Dave Lee (167
pounds).
"This tournament will be a good
indicator on how well each athlete
will do in the NCAA (National
Collegiate Athletic Association)

championships," Stanford Coach
Chris Horpel said. "Jeff Wilson
(as a senior) placed last year in the
meet and then went on to earn
All-America honors."
The Cardinal wrestling team
will take a break for Christmas,
and on Dec. 28 and 29, Wartnik,
Bradley, Wiggen, Rogers and Lee
will compete in the Midwest Invi
tational in Ames, lowa. This meet
will consist of open competition,
so Olympic gold-medal winner
Dave Shultz will accompany the
team as both a coach and a com
petitor.
The first home meet for the
Cardinal will be Jan. 3 against
Portland State University, which
Stanford beat two years ago. In
the interim, Portland State has
hired a new coach and worked
hard to improve its program.
