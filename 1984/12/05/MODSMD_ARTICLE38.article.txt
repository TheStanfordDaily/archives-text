# Stanford wins by one, two points
## Fencing teams barely defeat Spartans 
### JASON COLE Daily staff 
As Coach Buzz Hurst anticipated, the Stanford men's
and women's fencing teams improved their records to 3-0
by sweeping matches over San Jose State University, but
by only the closest of margins.
The Cardinal men won the final duel of its match to
win, 14-13, and the Stanford women got seven victories
from Jennifer Yu and Holly Taylor to win, 9-7, Friday at
Roble Gym.
The men's match came down to the final sabre event
between Stanford senior Craig Miott and San Jose State's
Mike Van De Vooren. Not only were the two teams tied,
but so was the Miott-Van De Vooren match.
Miott won his match on the final touch despite the
"tremendous pressure," according to Hurst. "Considering
the fact he (Miott) started fencing two years ago, it was a
remarkable performance," Hurst said.
Stanford had trouble in the other two events, losing
both the epee and the foil 5-4. The sabre team won, 6-3,
but the Cardinal was constantly behind from the start.
The Spartans "caught us a little off balance, and, as a
result, we trailed throughout the meet," Hurst said. "We
took the lead halfway through the last round, when our
sabre team started to establish some dominance."
The Cardinal was led by junior Andy Goorno, who was
3-0 in the sabre. "Andy fenced as well as I have ever seen

him fence," Hurst said. Junior Elliot Cheu was 2-1 in the
foil, but was caught off guard by the Spartans' Dean Hin
ton. Hinton, who "got his timing going," according to
Hurst, won 5-0.
"It was a dogfight," Hurst said of the match. "That's
what it has usually become when these two team get to
gether. ... In a match like this, it comes down to who has
more fight in them."
In the women's match, Yu was 4-0 and Taylor was 3-1,
and the Cardinal won its closest match this season. Taylor
also "fenced as well as I have ever seen her fence," Hurst
said.
But it was Yu who won the toughest duel of the match,
beating San Jose State's Katie Coombs on the final touch.
Coombs might be Yu's toughest competition in the West
ern Region.
Hurst analyzed the women's meet about the same way
he did the men's match, saying, "Certainly we outfenced
them, but we also had the fighting edge over them as well.
"I think that's a very important point. As far as fun
damentals go, I was already aware of our abilities, but on
Friday I found out how much fight they (Stanfords teams)
have in them," Hurst said.
Stanford will take the holidays off and return to action
Jan. 12 when it hosts the University of California at Santa
Cruz.
