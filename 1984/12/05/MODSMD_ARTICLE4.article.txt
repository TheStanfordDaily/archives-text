The University lifted a probation on the beta
Theta Pi fraternity yesterday, citing the fraternity s
promised compliance with the recently formulated
and published Interfraternity Council Party
Guidelines.
Dean of Residential Education Norm Robinson
placed the Betas on probation Nov. 14, following a
reported sexual assault at a Beta House party Nov.
8. Alleged victims and witnesses at the party
charged that onlookers had watched and even
cheered an assailant as he ripped the clothes off a
young woman, but had offered no help. Campus
police reported that five women had filed separate
battery charges against the same man, all saying he
attacked them at the party.
The University quickly launched a major investi
gation into the incident and placed the host frater
nity on probation "so that there would be no risk of
this happening again," Robinson said.
As the University and legal investigations began,

the IFC convened and released a set of fraternity
party guidelines to Robinson on Nov. 16. The
guidelines, which included methods of monitoring
and maintaining control of parties, gained praise
from Robinson, who called the report thoughtful
and comprehensive.
In addition to the IFC guidelines, Robinson said
he received detailed reports "analyzing what
went wrong" at the Nov. 8 party from Beta Presi
dent Dennis Furlong and Resident Assistant Mike
Melendez. "The Betas have been a very respon
sible house and the way they responded to this is
evidence of that," he said.
Robinson announced his decision to lift the
Betas' probation in a letter to Furlong yesterday.
"I do want to tell you again how impressed I and
others have been with the responsible way in which
you and the Betas responded to the incident and its
aftermath," he wrote. "I am hopeful that not only
the Betas but also all fraternities will be
strengthened as a result of the discussions and new
policies that followed the party."

Furlong said the Betas were happy to hear the
probation had been terminated quickly. "We're es
pecially happy that the probation ended before the
quarter. We want to begin next quarter with no
thing hanging over our heads."
IFC President Rick Hoskins explained that Rob
inson lifted the probation "because the Betas took
it very seriously. Melendez's report was very thor
ough. All of the house members were very con
cerned."
Hoskins said the fraternities were able to turn
the Beta party incident into a positive step by
"raising awareness and simply discussing the is
sues."
The University is currently investigating charges
against sophomore David Keane, stemming from
the Nov. 8 party. Widespread reports that all legal
charges against Keane have been dropped are false,
according to freshmen Charlotte Lowson and
Cathy Zerboni, two of the women who filed
charges. Both women said they have no intention
of dropping charges.
