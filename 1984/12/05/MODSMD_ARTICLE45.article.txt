# Rugby team fifth
## 
### 
The Stanford men's rugby team
finished well through all divisions,
despite stiff competition and its own
relative inexperience, in the annual
Stanford 10-a-side Rugby Tourna
ment held here Saturday.
Stanford's No. 1 team finished fifth
in the "A" division, defeating a much
larger PAXO's squad, 9-4, before
losing, 20-4, to the San Jose
Seahawks. Team captain Darrell
Brooks keyed the Cardinal victory by
scoring after recovering his own short
pop-kick.
In the other divisions, Stanford's
No. 2 team tied the Stanford Business
School team, 14-14, to grab a share
of the "B" consolation championship,
after losing to the Chico Rugby Foot
ball Club, 10-4, and then beating
Marin I 12-10.
Stanford's No. 3 team defeated
Santa Rosa after losing to Napa in the
"C" division, while in the "D" divr
sion the No. 4 and No. 5 teams fell on
hard times, losing their first two games.
