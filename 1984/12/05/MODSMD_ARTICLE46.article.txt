## Zetes petition to regain house 
### KURT JOHNSON Staff writer 
In early January, the Zeta Psi fra
ternity plans to submit a petition to
regain its house at 353 Campus
Drive. If the petition is approved, the
Zetes could be back in their house by
next fall.
The petition will go to the Commit
tee on Services to Students, which
will forward a recommendation to
Dean of Residential Education Norm
Robinson. Robinson will then make
the final decision.
In the fall of 1,981, the Zetes lost
University recognition and were or
dered to vacate their house. The fra
ternity regained University recogni
tion last January.
On Oct. 29, 1981, Zete Psi was
suspended after a Mills College stu
dent was tossed into a pond at the
house during a social exchange earlier
in the month.
At that time, the Zetes were given
a year to demonstrate the effective
ness of their new governance
structure for various events such as
officer elections, rush and initiation.

The key issues in the University's
decision on whether to allow the
Zetes to regain their house will be
"the behavior of the group since they
received recognition," and how suc
cessful the group has been in self
governance, according to Diana Con
klin, director of the row.
Zete president Sam Aronson said,
"We've changed the structure of the
fraternity." Recently, the group
voted member Jim Mulvihill out of
the fraternity because "he refused to
comply" with guidelines set by the
Zetes' new judicial committee, Aron
son said.
If the Zetes do get their house
back, the current residents of 353
Campus Drive "will leave gracefully
and be happy for the Zetes," accord
ing to Katy Kinney, resident assistant
there.
Those currently living at the house
would of course lose their returning
residence priority there, but they can
"hopefully get a priority somewhere
else," Kinney said.
Robinson's final decision is ex
pected in early February, Conklin
said.
