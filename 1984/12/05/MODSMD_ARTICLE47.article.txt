# Jews decry Soviet imprisonment of Hebrew teachers
## Protest of arrests planned 
### CAMERON KALLER Staff writer 
Protesting the recent arrests of four Hebrew
teachers in the Soviet Union, Jewish clergymen
and college students will hold a peaceful
demonstration outside the Soviet consulate in
San Francisco today.
The protest, which is scheduled on Green
Street at 5 p.m., will begin with the performance
of a Hebrew service across the street from the
consulate and end with the protesters symboli
cally chaining themselves together, according to
Rabbi Doug Kahn, assistant director of Jewish
Community Relations for the Bay Area Council
of Soviet Jewry.
"This is an attempt to state as dramatically as
we can our outrage over what continues to go on
in the Soviet Union concerning teachers of He
brew and the Jewish culture, said Rabbi Shel
don Lewis of the Kol Emeth congregation.
The rally is part of a larger effort, including an
ongoing rotating fast, in support of Soviet Jewish
refuseniks, according to Lewis.
"Our reasons are many-fold, really. We want
to educate the public about this cause, and we
want to send as dramatic a message as possible to
the Soviet Union, because we know [it's] listen
ing," Lewis said.
The teaching of Hebrew is not illegal in the So

viet Union, but "it goes against current Soviet
policies, " according to Kahn.
"In order to suppress the teachings of the
Jewish language and culture, the Soviets have
concocted or justified means for arresting people
. . . with the use of tactics reminiscent of the
czars," he said.
David Barrett, a student co-chairman of the
World Jewry Committee of Stanford Hillel, dis
cussed the four different cases where Hebrew
teachers have been arrested in the Soviet Union
in the past few months.
Alexander Kholmiansky from Moscow was ar
rested in September of this year and was charged
for "illegal possession of a gun in his home."
Yuli Edelshtein, also from Moscow, was ar
rested when the KGB "discovered" a supply of
opium in his mezzuza, a Jewish ritual object,
which normally contains a scroll from the Bible in
it.
Yacov Levin from Odessa was arrested in Sep
tember for "illegal possession of drugs,"
however, he was just sentenced two weeks ago to
a three-year term of hard labor in a Soviet labor
camp for "defamation of the Soviet state."
Marc Nepomniashchy was recently arrested,
but no one knows what his charge is yet. "It'll
probably be along the same lines as the others,"
Kahn said. "All we know is that the investigation

is'secret.
"Basically, these teachers have all been
charged for being Jewish," Barrett said.
"It's unclear whether or not the KGB will ulti
mately have a leg to stand on with some of these
arrests. They've had to stretch a lot to trump up
these charges," Kah.i said.
According to Kahn, the demonstration today
presents "a special opportunity and duty for
those in the Bay Area" because it will be held in
front of the only Soviet consulate in the United
States.
"We know our message will be transmitted di
rectly to the Kremlin, letting the Soviet officials
know of the concern in this community about the
increased persecution of Jewish Soviet
refuseniks," Kahn said.
"There is no guarantee of any amelioration of
the situation there, but fwe hope] there'll be
some response to our protest," Lewis said.
Commenting on the possibilities of protestors
being arrested today, Lewis said, "The arrest of a
non-violent protestor means a lot more inside
(the Soviet Union) than it does here.'
The protest was organized by all of the Hillel
foundations in the Bay Area.
The Stanford contingent will be led by Rabbi
Ari Cartun, director of the Stanford Hillel foun
dation.
