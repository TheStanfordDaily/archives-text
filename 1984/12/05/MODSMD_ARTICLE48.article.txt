# Five years after invasion, Afghanistan still debated
## 
### DOUG GROVE 
It was Christmas Eve, 1979, when
the Soviets took the world by surprise
and began in earnest to move troops
into Afghanistan.
The public was stunned, ai 1 it
wasn't until almost a month late, in
former President Carter's State of he
Union address, that the U.S. govei i
ment made a comprehensive public
statement about the invasion. Five
years later, experts here are still
debating Soviet conduct in Afghanis
tan â€” and whether the intervention
has been a success or a failure.
History Prof. Alexander Dallin and
Vladimir Bukovsky, a Soviet dissi
dent pursuing a doctorate in neuro
science here, have differing
interpretations of Soviet intentions in
the region.
"The (Persian Gulf) oil was not
the reason (for the invasion). . . . The
timing was not correct," Dallin said in
an interview. The goal, in fact, was
simply "to support a fraternal
regime," and the gulf oil may have
just been an additional gain, he
added.
The communist coup that estab
lished the fraternal regime took place
before Soviet troops marched in, but
an Afghan request for Soviet assis
tance came after the troops had
already been pouring into Kabul.
Bukovsky. on the other hand, said
the Soviet "aim is toward the gulf
oil." But both Bukovsky and Dallin
agree that by controlling the border

and testing personnel and weapons,
most Soviet goals have been
achieved.
But the price tl 1 Soviets have paid
has been substan. al. Some experts
uggest that the Soviets seem to be
c >unting on the short-term memory
ot the free world, as their prestige in
the world view dropped significantly
after the invasion. Manpower and ex
penses have also taken a toll on the
Soviets, as some rebels are waging a
"holy war" as mandated by Muslim
law.
"There were some public outbursts
in the Soviet Union in 1982 and 1983
when the Soviets started the old
American policy of sending dead
bodies home," Bukovsky said. That
policy was soon dropped.
Dallin also said there tends to be an
"exaggeration of casualties (within
the Soviet Union) . . . since the war
doesn't appear in the Soviet press."
Although initially taken by surprise
by the invasion, the United States has
since taken no small account of Af
ghanistan. Dallin said the current
U.S. attitude is to "let China do the
dirty work" when it comes to dealing
with the Soviets in Afghanistan.
Bukovsky tends to think the
United States could give more direct
aid to the rebels but understands the
complicated sets of relations in neigh
boring countries such as Pakistan, In
dia and Iran. He does suggest the
United States use a system of
"payment on delivery" in order to

supply weapons because there is a
large "underground market" that is
much more efficient than dealing
through the respective governments.
But whatever this country does,
Bukovsky said, "It will be too little
too late."
Regarding the current situation,
not much has changed, according to
Bukovsky.
"The rebels control about 85 per
cent of the country, [mainly] just the
countryside, and the Soviets control
the cities," he said. It is now "a war
on communications," with the rebels
making intermittent strikes on the
main lines of communication between
the city and the country. Bukovsky
also said the Soviets are fighting the
rebels by "driving the (local) popula
tion out ... so the guerrillas are
unable to operate."
Whatever the specific means of
fighting, the tactics used against the
rebels have been refined through long
use by the Soviets. "The U.S.S.R.
(has) a pattern of aggression,"
Bukovsky said. It is "to prepare the
ground beforehand, pump money in
and play on internal conflicts."
History seems to show that after 10
percent of the population has fled
or been killed, the rest get tired,
Bukovsky said. Even though the
rebels are still holding their own, "It
is only a matter of time," according to
Dallin.
