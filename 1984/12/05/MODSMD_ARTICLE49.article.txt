# Survey of '84 graduates calls education excellent
## 
### GREGORY WEINGARTEN Staff writer 
A little more than half of Stan
ford's 1983-84 graduating seniors
rated their undergraduate education
as excellent in the annual
senior survey conducted by the Office
of Undergraduate Research.
The four-part survey is conducted
to determine the retrospective views
of seniors on various aspects of their
undergraduate experience. The sur
vey, which is mailed to all seniors
during spring quarter, was answered
by 625 graduating students, or 39
percent of the graduating class.
Ninety-three percent of the re
spondents rated their undergraduate
education as "excellent" or "good,"

with 51 percent in the "excellent"
range. Only 5 percent described it as
"average" and just 1 percent chose
"poor." Advising continued as a
weak point, with 49 percent saying
this was "very poor" or "poor" prior
to choosing a major, and 30 percent
rated it the same after selecting a
major.
In several areas, the seniors sur
veyed gave higher ratings to
categories that received high evalua
tions in previous senior surveys. But
in general, most of the ratings
remained roughly consistent with last
year's student evaluations, according
to Undergraduate Research Coordin
ator John Boli. Boli said an upcoming
report would analyze five-year trends

in the surveys.
The survey indicated that students'
living environments are seen as con
tributing positively to their academic
development. Fifty-five percent said
their campus living arrangement con
tributed highly to their intellectual
life, and 92 percent of the students
who attended an overseas campus felt
their experiences there were "good"
or "excellent."
Fifty-five percent of the seniors
said they planned to work full time
after graduation. More than half of
this group reported they had received
job offers by mid-May, when the sur
vey was conducted. Nine out of ten
said they eventually planned to at
tend graduate or professional school.
