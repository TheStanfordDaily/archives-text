# Board to discuss library location
## 
### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
Stanford's board of trustees will
discuss three potential sites for the
Ronald Reagan Presidential Library
at its Dec. 11 meeting and is expected
to forward its recommendation to the
White House soon after.

than 20 possible locations for the
facility, proposed sites on Junipero
Serra Boulevard, Deer Creek Road
and Alpine Road on Oct. 29. The
board of trustees may pass along all
three site proposals to the White
House, or it may forward just one or
two of them.
The board of trustees will also con
sider plans for relocating the LOTS
computer facility, expanding the
Graduate School of Business, build
ing a new Applied Physics laboratory
and revamping the University's cur
rent debt policy.
The action on the Reagan library
site culminates more than seven
months of work on the part of the
planning committee. Robert Freelen,
director of University Public Affairs
and chair of the planning committee,
said he expects the trustees to make
some kind of decision at this meeting
because "I don't think we've over
looked anything."
Freelen and Director of Planning
Phil Williams, another member of the
10-person committee, will present
the committee's report, including the
advantages and disadvantages of each
of the three sites, to the board's Com
mittee on Academic Affairs and De
velopment Monday.
The planning committee recom
mends the Junipero Serra site,
situated above Lake Lagunita near
the Center for Advanced Study in the
Behavioral Sciences, as its top choice
for the library. Second ranking goes
to the Alpine Road site, adjacent to
the towns of Ladera and Portola Val
ley. The Deer Creek option, located
just off Interstate 280 in the Stanford
South area, is the committee's third
choice.
All three sites are located west of
Junipero Serra Blvd. and away from
the center of campus, two considera
tions of primary importance to the
committee.
The Reagan library will sit on five
to seven acres of land and will be
composed of buildings totaling be
tween 50,000 and 100,000 square
feet, according to current plans. Offi
cials expect 200,000 to 500,000
visitors during the first two years.
Each of the three sites could ac
commodate these projections, ac

cording to the planning committee's
report. Only the Alpine Road site al
lows any flexibility in the plans.
Freelen said it will probably be one
and a half to two years before
groundbreaking begins on the library.
He said he expects the facility to be
ready for occupancy by the end of
President Reagan's second term.

report, several members visited the
Lyndon Johnson Presidential Library
at the University of Texas in Austin
as well as the Gerald Ford Presiden
tial Library at the University of Mich
igan in Ann Arbor.
According to the report, the most
important criteria for analysis of the
sites were: relationship of the library
to Stanford academic users, opportu
nity costs of the land, environmental
impact, aesthetic impact and poten
tial for attractive architectural design.
The board of trustees approved a
Reagan library and modest museum
in January after Reagan agreed to
drop from the plans a requirement for
a public policy center as part of the
package.
The board will also be asked to ap
prove the concept of the Academic
Computing Facility's housing LOTS
and Instruction and Research Infor
mation Systems (IRIS).
Of the five sites considered for the
new building, the University's top
choice is the "Stern Beach" area —
the grass parcel between Meyer Li
brary and Stern Hall, just north of
CERAS.
The University is also considering
sites within or attached to Meyer Li
brary; east of the Career Planning
and Placement Center, in Canfield
Court (between Meyer and the Law

School) and in the parking lots at
either Stern Hall or the Stanford Law
School.
Freelen said there is a "strong con
sensus" for the Stern Beach site.
According to Freelen, LOTS must
move out of CERAS because the
School of Education needs the space.
The new Academic Computing
Facility, expected to cost between $4
and $5.5 million, probably will stand
two stories and take several years to
complete.
In the meantime, the LOTS
facilities will be relocated to Tresid
der Union, at the former site of the
campus bowling alley.
The board will also be asked to ap
prove the site for the expansion of the
Graduate School of Business and
concur with the proposal for the Ap
plied Physics/Gintzon Laboratory
Annex.
Approval for the GSB site came
before the board at the October

meeting, but trustees asked planners
to reconsider its recommendation.
After reviewing the potential sites,
planners again chose the area just
east of the current GSB structure, be
tween the Oval and Frost Amphi
theater.
"They're saying that there are just
very good academic reasons for this
site," said Freelen, who also serves as
the press liason to the board of trus
tees.
The total cost of the' GSB expan
sion project is estimated between $12
and $13.5 million, with an additional
$1 to $1.5 million required for
renovation of the existing GSB build
ing.
The $2.2 million Applied Physics
laboratory is designed to meet the ex
panded needs of the physical sciences
here.
The board will also begin the
process of reviewing the University's
policy on debt for academic facilities.

new building, the University's top
choice is the "Stern Beach" area —
the grass parcel between Meyer Li
brary and Stern Hall, just north of
CERAS.
The University is also considering
sites within or attached to Meyer Li
brary; east of the Career Planning
and Placement Center, in Canfield
Court (between Meyer and the Law

School) and in the parking lots at
either Stern Hall or the Stanford Law
School.
Freelen said there is a "strong con
sensus" for the Stern Beach site.
According to Freelen, LOTS must
move out of CERAS because the
School of Education needs the space.
The new Academic Computing
Facility, expected to cost between $4
and $5.5 million, probably will stand
two stories and take several years to
complete.
In the meantime, the LOTS
facilities will be relocated to Tresid
der Union, at the former site of the
campus bowling alley.
The board will also be asked to ap
prove the site for the expansion of the
Graduate School of Business and
concur with the proposal for the Ap
plied Physics/Gintzon Laboratory
Annex.
Approval for the GSB site came
before the board at the October

meeting, but trustees asked planners
to reconsider its recommendation.
After reviewing the potential sites,
planners again chose the area just
east of the current GSB structure, be
tween the Oval and Frost Amphi
theater.
"They're saying that there are just
very good academic reasons for this
site," said Freelen, who also serves as
the press liason to the board of trus
tees.
The total cost of the' GSB expan
sion project is estimated between $12
and $13.5 million, with an additional
$1 to $1.5 million required for
renovation of the existing GSB build
ing.
The $2.2 million Applied Physics
laboratory is designed to meet the ex
panded needs of the physical sciences
here.
The board will also begin the
process of reviewing the University's
policy on debt for academic facilities.
Stanford's board of trustees will

than 20 possible locations for the
facility, proposed sites on Junipero
Serra Boulevard, Deer Creek Road
and Alpine Road on Oct. 29. The
board of trustees may pass along all
three site proposals to the White
House, or it may forward just one or
two of them.
The board of trustees will also con
sider plans for relocating the LOTS
computer facility, expanding the
Graduate School of Business, build
ing a new Applied Physics laboratory
and revamping the University's cur
rent debt policy.
The action on the Reagan library
site culminates more than seven
months of work on the part of the
planning committee. Robert Freelen,
director of University Public Affairs
and chair of the planning committee,
said he expects the trustees to make
some kind of decision at this meeting
because "I don't think we've over
looked anything."
Freelen and Director of Planning
Phil Williams, another member of the
10-person committee, will present
the committee's report, including the
advantages and disadvantages of each
of the three sites, to the board's Com
mittee on Academic Affairs and De
velopment Monday.
The planning committee recom
mends the Junipero Serra site,
situated above Lake Lagunita near
the Center for Advanced Study in the
Behavioral Sciences, as its top choice
for the library. Second ranking goes
to the Alpine Road site, adjacent to
the towns of Ladera and Portola Val
ley. The Deer Creek option, located
just off Interstate 280 in the Stanford
South area, is the committee's third
choice.
All three sites are located west of
Junipero Serra Blvd. and away from
the center of campus, two considera
tions of primary importance to the
committee.
The Reagan library will sit on five
to seven acres of land and will be
composed of buildings totaling be
tween 50,000 and 100,000 square
feet, according to current plans. Offi
cials expect 200,000 to 500,000
visitors during the first two years.
Each of the three sites could ac
commodate these projections, ac

cording to the planning committee's
report. Only the Alpine Road site al
lows any flexibility in the plans.
Freelen said it will probably be one
and a half to two years before
groundbreaking begins on the library.
He said he expects the facility to be
ready for occupancy by the end of
President Reagan's second term.

According to the report, the most
important criteria for analysis of the
sites were: relationship of the library
to Stanford academic users, opportu
