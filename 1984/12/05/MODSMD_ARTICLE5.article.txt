# Board to discuss library location

### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
Stanford's board of trustees will
discuss three potential sites for the
Ronald Reagan Presidential Library
at its Dec. 11 meeting and is expected
to forward its recommendation to the
White House soon after.

than 20 possible locations for the
facility, proposed sites on Junipero
Serra Boulevard, Deer Creek Road
and Alpine Road on Oct. 29. The
board of trustees may pass along all
three site proposals to the White
House, or it may forward just one or
two of them.
The board of trustees will also con
sider plans for relocating the LOTS
computer facility, expanding the
Graduate School of Business, build
ing a new Applied Physics laboratory
and revamping the University's cur
rent debt policy.
The action on the Reagan library
site culminates more than seven
months of work on the part of the
planning committee. Robert Freelen,
director of University Public Affairs
and chair of the planning committee,
said he expects the trustees to make
some kind of decision at this meeting
because "I don't think we've over
looked anything."
Freelen and Director of Planning
Phil Williams, another member of the
10-person committee, will present
the committee's report, including the
advantages and disadvantages of each
of the three sites, to the board's Com
mittee on Academic Affairs and De
velopment Monday.
The planning committee recom
mends the Junipero Serra site,
situated above Lake Lagunita near
the Center for Advanced Study in the
Behavioral Sciences, as its top choice
for the library. Second ranking goes
to the Alpine Road site, adjacent to
the towns of Ladera and Portola Val
ley. The Deer Creek option, located
just off Interstate 280 in the Stanford
South area, is the committee's third
choice.
All three sites are located west of
Junipero Serra Blvd. and away from
the center of campus, two considera
tions of primary importance to the
committee.
The Reagan library will sit on five
to seven acres of land and will be
composed of buildings totaling be
tween 50,000 and 100,000 square
feet, according to current plans. Offi
cials expect 200,000 to 500,000
visitors during the first two years.
Each of the three sites could ac
commodate these projections, ac

cording to the planning committee's
report. Only the Alpine Road site al
lows any flexibility in the plans.
Freelen said it will probably be one
and a half to two years before
groundbreaking begins on the library.
He said he expects the facility to be
ready for occupancy by the end of
President Reagan's second term.

report, several members visited the
Lyndon Johnson Presidential Library
at the University of Texas in Austin
as well as the Gerald Ford Presiden
tial Library at the University of Mich
igan in Ann Arbor.
According to the report, the most
important criteria for analysis of the
sites were: relationship of the library
to Stanford academic users, opportu
nity costs of the land, environmental
impact, aesthetic impact and poten
tial for attractive architectural design.
The board of trustees approved a
Reagan library and modest museum
