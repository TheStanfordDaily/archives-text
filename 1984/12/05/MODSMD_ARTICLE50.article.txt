Strange bedfellows
Tim Grieve's "Good Manners and
Bad Breath will get you Nowhere"
slate will do-si-do the "Ho!" slate of
Jason Cole at the Volume 187 grill
session and bo-ho-down, to com
mence Jan. 8 at noon. You can cast
your ballots and vote, too, all on the
following day from 1-10 p.m.
Biddulph? Where were you when
we needed you?
Business as usual
Department editors: Loads 'o fun
await on Jan. 4 and 5, when you are
to arrive for the rest of this. Terms
are negotiable in the usual fashion
with Shirish, the not-yet-outgoing
editor. Western diplomats praise
Date for his special breed of compro
mise. He knows we all just want a
little respect.
