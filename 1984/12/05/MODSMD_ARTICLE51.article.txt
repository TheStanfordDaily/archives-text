# Not much happens in 'Falling in Love'

### STEVE VINEBERG Daily staff 
The release of "Falling in Love,"
starring Robert De Niro and Meryl
Streep, has provoked some rankling
about the cynicism of stitching to
gether such an obvious commercial
vehicle for two high-powered stars. It
is cynical, but it's such an old
fashioned Hollywood brand of
cynicism that it would hardly be
worth commenting on — if the movie
were any good. Movies have thrown
together box-office champions to
double the potential of popular suc
cess since the silents, and sometimes
it works magically: Suddenly
performers we wouldn't have
dreamed of co-starring as lovers il
luminate corners in each other's per
sonalities we'd never seen before.
Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert
were such a match in "It Happened
One Night," and Bogart and Hep
burn in "The African Oueen," and a
decade ago Barbra Streisand and
Robert Redford, certainly an unlikely
pair, almost managed to turn a con
ventional marital melodrama, "The
Way We Were," into a romantic
tragedy. Streisand and Redford fur
nished one of the best examples in
movies of how star chemistry can
both set a film in motion and supply
the complexity of relationships that
the material only sketches; watching
these two charismatic yet physically
and emotionally dissimilar types on
screen together, we understood im
mediately how they could fall in love
— and why their marriage could
never survive.

But Robert De Niro and Meryl
Streep are the two most wilfully enig
matic actors of their stature on screen
today — hardly a promising footing

for a romantic picture. The last time
they played opposite each other, in
the 1978 "The Deer Hunter," Streep
hadn't yet entered her woman-of

mystery phase; she gave a warm,
open performance that surpasses
everything she's done since for clarity
and legibility. But that film marked
the beginning of De Niro's closed
psyche approach to acting, and so no
sparks flew between them. In
"Falling in Love," positions are
reversed: Streep is impenetrable, but
De Niro — and this is the surprise —
seems at lpst to have emerged .from
his hiding place. As Frank Raftis, a
construction engineer with a loving
wife (Jane Kaczmarek) and two
children who falls in love with a fel
low commuter he keeps bumping into
on trains and in book stores (in Riz
zoli, actually — Manhattan's ritziest
book mart), De Niro creates a com
prehensible, sympathetic character in
just a few strokes. (It's the only char
acter De Niro's played that I've
enjoyed since Jimmy Doyle in "New
York, New York.") The problem is
that in his scenes with Meryl Streep.
the two of them seem so uncomfort
able and joyless that "Falling in
Love" begins to sound like a
ridiculously inapt title.
De Niro has to build his role
economically, because neither the
writer, Michael Cristofer. nor the
director, Ulu Grosbard, gives him
much to go on. Frank leads an ap
parently happy existence, unlike
Molly Gilmore (Streep), who is
haunted by the recent loss of a baby
and worried about the precarious
health of her father (George Martin).
He has a profitable job (though De
Niro looks a little odd carrying

blueprints around) that overworks
him but keeps him energetically en
gaged; his biggest problem is his
boss's pressuring him to transfer to
the Houston office, where the com
pany needs a strong man-in-charge.
So his attraction to Molly doesn't
arise from loneliness or emptiness,
restlessness or boredom — his need
for her is less clear than her need for
him. De Niro's achievement in this
film is that he makes Frank's longing
for Molly, and his resultant confusion
about his feelings for his wife Ann,
accessible — normal. What remains
opaque is his choice of Molly as an
object of affection, since De Niro and
Streep don't bring anything out in
each other.
Frank and Molly must be the most
laconic lovers since sound came in:
their conversations leave so much un
said — and unexpressed in any other
way — that when Grosbard cuts to
the end of a meal they've eaten to
gether, we can't help wondering how
they dealt with the awkward pauses.
In fact, the term "lovers" is mislead
ing, because their pained embraces
never actually melt into lovemaking;
Frank takes Molly to bed, but,
panicked, she breaks away before
they have even removed their clothes.
(Streep communicates contradictory
emotions with her usual authenticity
and intensity — and, as usual, we
don't understand what those emo
tions are. Her performance is not
without its high points, however: She
does a good one-way phone con
versation and a terrific nervous
breakdown.) Considering how unin

passioned and psychically blocked
their interchanges are, the inability oi
these characters to consummate their
attachment is less puzzling than their
persistence, long after this debacle, in
putting each other at the center of
their lives.
It's hard to think of a recent movie
with so lew ideas in it. Michael Cris
tofer has chosen a structure so
sleepily symmetrical that even Mi
chael Kahn's editing can't maintain
the requisite liveliness when the
picture rounds the corner into its
second hour. Each of the protagonists
has a loyal, slightly boring spouse
(Dave Clennon does a nice job with
the role of Brian, Molly's physician
husband) and a best friend/confidant
who is experiencing marital complica
tions of his/her own. (Two talented
performers — Harvey Keitel and
Dianne Wiest — are wasted in these
tertiary roles.) In the opening scenes,
Molly's and Frank's movements
around New York City keep overlap
ping, so that we know they can't fail
to notice each other for long. (The
filmmakers try to dig some humor out
of these initial moments, but the>
have their origins in so many 1930s
and '40s comedies that the laughter
they dravs sounds merely obiigat -i\
at best, wilted at worst.) And for the
next half hour or so, Grosbard and
Cristofer intercut domestic scenes be
tween Frank and his family with
sceYies between Molly and Frank (or
Molly and her father), scenes of
Molly receiving counsel from Isabelle
