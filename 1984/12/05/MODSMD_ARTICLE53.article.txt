# What to do in Golden Gate Park
## Holiday diversions in the City 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
Fear not, Stanford students stranded in
the Bay Area over Christmas vacation.
There will be more to do than merely get
ting a head start on reading for winter
quarter and watching an endless number of
holiday specials on television. One can
escape the academic environs by joining in
on the activities and attractions at San
Francisco's Golden Gate Park, less than an
hour from campus.
The park, located in the City's Haight
district at Fell and Stanyan streets, features
1,017 acres of hills, museums and paths for
strolls and hiking. The park is an ideal

place for a late autumn picnic in the City
before an evening on the town.
Several special events are planned for
the holidays, including the lighting of a
100-foot Christmas tree by San Francisco
Mayor Dianne Feinstein on Dec. 17 at 5
p.m. Caroling will accompany the cere
mony and a band will play for the crowd on
hand.
For those lovers of flora on the Farm,
the park's Conservatory of Flowers will
present a display featuring thousands of
plants, including the traditional Christmas
plant, the poinsettia. A dove in flight will
be depicted in a special arrangement with

the word "peace" spelled out in flowers.
The conservatory is open from 10 a.m.
to 6 p.m. daily, with extended evening
hours to 8:30 p.m. on Mondays.
The park will also be the scene of a
Holiday Hobby and Boutique on Dec. 22
from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. near the Conser
vatory of Flowers by Ninth Street. While
not billed as "a white elephant sale," the
event will feature arts, crafts and paintings
done by elderly citizens in the Bay Area.
To date, 27 agencies for the elderly have
contacted the park about purchasing tables
at the boutique.
The park is the home of the City's

renowned M.H. de Young Museum, one of
the best art museums on the West Coast,
and the California Academy of Sciences
The park also includes a Japanese tea
garden near the de Young Museum, full of
shrubbery trimmed in oriental fashion
For the younger set — and for the grade
schooler inside each Stanford student —
the park features a children's playground
with a carousel that was opened in June
after seven years of renovation.
And of course, the park is always
available for picnicking, hiking and
rollerskating. Park officials estimate that
as manv as 6,000 rollerskaters frequent the
park on Sundays.


Rollerskaters perform in an rollerskating competition at Golden Gate Park in
San Francisco. The park will host a number of activities over the upcoming

holidays, as well as continue to provide recreation through the M.H. de Young
Museum, the California Academy of Sciences and the Japanese Tea Garden.
