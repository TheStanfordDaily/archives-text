## 'Once Upon a Time' far from coherent 
### STEVE VINEBERG Daily staff 
A measure of just how far Robert De Niro took interior
acting before coming out the other side in "Falling in
Love" is currently on view in the uncut "Once Upon a
Time in America," Sergio Leone's four-hour gangster
chronicle. De Niro was a powerhouse as Jake La Motta in
Scorsese's 1980 "Raging Bull," but he built his perfor
mance inward, so that we couldn't comprehend this man's
brutality and paranoia; in the climactic scenes, he im
ploded. And by "Once Upon a Time in America," De
Niro — playing David "Noodles" Aaronson, one of the
two leaders of a Jewish gang in Brooklyn during Prohibi
tion — has moved so far inside himself that nothing is
visible to us; only his phenomenal presence on camera
keeps us watching him.
During the course of the film. Noodles sees the woman
he loves turn away from him forever and everyone else he
is close to die violently, yet De Niro never shows us how
this man processes all this information or what kind of
psychological damage it causes him. If it weren't for his
timing, we would have no way of knowing that he's pro
cessed it at all. (He leaves space for Noodles to drink in
the implications of each incident, so we know it's all going
somewhere, deep under that protective hide.)
The screenplay Leone and a quintet of other Italian
writers culled from a book called "The Hoods" (by Harry
Grey) abets De Niro in maintaining Noodles' mystery.
You can scramble all the facts they give you about this
man — that he grew up tough on the streets, that he saw a
friend shot down by a neighborhood punk and went to
prison for 12 years for stabbing him (and a cop who tried
to stop him) in revenge, that he cherished a lifelong and
hopeless love for Deborah, the girl next door (Elizabeth
McGovern), who grew into a stage and film star, that he
raped a woman during a bank robbery (Tuesday Weld)
and that, the one time he had a chance to express his love
for Deborah he raped her too — and arrive at half a dozen
contradictory explanations for his behavior.
The movie can't decide whether Noodles is sympathetic
(a victim) or malevolent (a heartless killer), just as it can't
make up its mind about Noodles' best pal and partner,
Max Goldenberg (James Woods), who may be a raving
lunatic — and then again may not be. We might have a
little more patience for these enigmas if we felt they had a
point — and if Leone didn't spend so long on them with
out providing any real clues to how we're supposed to
read them.
I'm not sure why I stayed for all of "Once Upon a Time
in America" — certainly not out of admiration for the
performers (only Burt Young does anything fresh, and
he's rubbed out after a couple of scenes) or fascination
with the recycled ideas from the "Godfather" movies.
(It's amusing to contemplate the idea of a group of
Italians remaking "The Godfather" with Jewish Mafiosi.)
And despite all the talk about Sergio Leone's
panoramic pop mythologizing, the movie's not even
visually interesting, and last year's soporific "Scarface"
contained more grandiose excesses. (Leone squeezes out
just two striking images in four hours: an aerial shot of a
hospital nursery where the babies in their spotless white
gowns look like so many pastries on display; and a proces

sion in a speakeasy to celebrate the death ot the Volstead
Act, in which customers toss flowers on top of an enor
mous coffin-shaped chocolate cake.)
Perhaps I felt committed to the damn thing, after in
vesting so much time in it, or perhaps I was curious about
how the plot would sort itself out.
"Once Upon a Time in America" had its first release in
this country during the summer, in a version running
slightly over two hours, and friends assure me that the
narrative was incoherent. Leone s original scheme in
cluded traveling in and out of flashback. He began with
Noodles' return to Brooklyn after 35 years' hiding in Buf
falo to escape hit men and then explained how he reached
that point of desperation. On paper, at least, the structure
must have promised two kinds of suspense (past and pres
ent tense) working simultaneously on the audience, since
Noodles has come back to discover who stole the gang's
money after Max and their two buddies. Cockeye
(William Forsythe) and Patsy (the late James Hayden),
perished in a gun battle with the cops on the eve of
Prohibition's demise — and also to face the anonymous
figure who has finally succeeded in tracking him down
after all these years.
In recutting the picture, the distributors changed the
flashback structure into a straight linear retelling of the
plot and omitted the conclusion of what had been the
framing story. Those who suffered through this shorter
version without understanding what went on in it won't
find much solace in the longer one. Only hours after sit
ting through it and taking copious notes, I found I couldn't
reconstruct the story and that at least half the burning
questions I had had in the first hour remained unanswered
in the last.
And there isn't very much suspense once you realize
those answers aren't forthcoming — in fact, there isn't
very much suspense ever, because in a Leone movie
everyone moves so slowly that your mind either flies
ahead to what you imagine the next scene will be (a risky
proposition, considering how arbitrary the switches in and
out of the flashbacks are) or starts calculating next week's
grocery expenses.
The single moment of suspense came for me in the
scene, near the end, when Noodles visits Deborah in her
dressing room after three-and-a-half decades of separa
tion. She's removing her make-up, very slowly and
deliberately, and you're dying to know whether Elizabeth
McGovern (who gives a dreadful performance) will be
wearing age make-up under her theatrical make-up, since
in these 1960s scenes De Niro, Treat Williams, Larry
Rapp and all the other survivors are sporting some of the.
most grotesque latex jobs since Elizabeth Taylor and
Rock Hudson grew old, Hollywood fashion, in "Giant."
Perhaps I shouldn't spoil the suspense for other viewers,
but I will: When she finally removes a sufficient quantity
of white greasepaint, the face we see peeking underneath
is the unmistakably young countenance of Elizabeth
McGovern, but then — after the camera cuts away to De
Niro and back to her — she's gained a few wrinkles and
lines. For the rest of the movie, I was haunted by the pres-:
ence of that invisible make-up artist, ready to rush in be
tween takes at a moment's notice.


Friends from their youth, Noodles (Robert De Niro) and Max (James Woods) attain positions of power in the
gangland hierarchy.
