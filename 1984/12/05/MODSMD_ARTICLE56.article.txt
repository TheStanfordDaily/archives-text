# A 						weekend at the Keystone
## The 						Dream Syndicate wakes up 
### JOHN PHILLIPS 
The Dream Syndicate has gone through a lot in the last
two years. After getting together in Los Angeles, it
released an album on tiny Ruby Records. "The Days of
Wine and Roses" received incredible underground
popularity. Critics hailed the group as the undisputed
cream of the U.S. psychedelic revival crop. A & M of
fered a major record deal. They have toured with the
Psychedelic Furs, U2 and R.E.M. as well as staying active
on the West Coast club circuit. Their first big label LP,
"The Medicine Show," was released this spring.
The blessing of relative fame has yielded mixed results.
The Dream Syndicate sound is a custom one, and it simply
doesn't suit the ears of many. This became a nagging
problem when they opened for U2 in 1983. To solve this,
they hired a big-name producer for their second album
("The Medicine Show") and signed on the services of a
keyboardist. Things got even more confusing at this point,
for established fans didn't take well to the slicker sound
emerging from the studio, and yet their sound hadn't
become accessible enough to draw a new layer of support
ers.
Given the disappointing reviews for "The Medicine
Show," the Dream Syndicate — vocalist Steve Wynn,
guitarist Karl Precoda, drummer Dennis Duck and bas
sist Mark Walton — seems to have taken stock of itself, its
sound, and its predicament. What it has decided is that
straddling the fence between creativity and accessibility is
entirely uncomfortable. In jumping off, it has landed with
experience, greater perspective and a much better sound.
At the Keystone Palo Alto Thursday night, Wynn asked
the disappointingly small crowd attending KFJC's 25th
anniversary party "Who was at the Stanford show a year

and a half ago?" Several of us raised our hands, ack
nowledging our attendance on the Beta House lawn
(where the band played after driving from Portland, Ore.,
the night before). Wynn continued, "Two of us were on
LSD, one of us was on bourbon. . . . We'll never do that
again."
Clearly both the group and its sound have grown up.
Wynn, Precoda and Duck, the three original members,
are all better musicians. Karl did not rely on feedback so
much; Steve was able to coax a lot more out of his guitar
than the "chicka-chicka" strumming that was evident at
Stanford; Dennis was unforgivingly physical with his
drums, he hit them hard.
I don't mean to imply that elements so visible in the
Syndicate's past are bad; I smiled whenever Karl's notes
fed back. But these elements have been professionally
embellished with time and skill so that the music no longer
strikes you and bounces off like it used to, leaving you
either amazed or appalled. Now it strikes you and gets ab
sorbed into your head, activating the dance mechanism as
well as the listen mechanism.
The band played material from both albums. Of three
new songs played, "Witness" sounded best. It rocked,
built to a climax and was very danceable. "Medicine
Show" and "Armed with an Empty Gun" were both per
formed brilliantly, with arrangement much better than on
record. On the whole, the songs themselves were more
bluesy and less noisy. At times I swear you could
label them mainstream rockers, putting out Rolling
Stones and Doobie Brothers licks. (Please don't
shudder at the thought "mainstream," old


John Phillips/Daily
The Dream Syndicate's vocalist, Steve Wynn, had as good a time as his fans last week. The performance was
more relaxed and better received than the Dream Syndicate's summer tour with R.E.M.
fans. For the Dream Syndicate,
maturity is thoroughly befitting.)
Wynn was very comfortable with
his audience. He has been known to
make audiences uneasy when things
aren't going well, taunting them or
making senseless banter. At Stanford
he went off on a Woodstockesque
description of the green grass, the
helicopters in the sky and the preg
nant woman and bad acid in the
"crowd." The real crowd had to be a
bit baffled. On Thursday, a positive
stage presence was assured by his
genuine friendliness with the audi
ence. whom he treated like old
friends
And then there was I'recoda, a.k.a.
"Jethro." The style of lead he would
play changed as many times as his
faces. One break he'd be an Eric
Clapton-meets-Keith Richards blues
man. The next he'd be 8.0.C.'s Buck
Dharma. He was so involved with his
guitar he seemed to become a part of

it: His eyes rolled when he bent a
note; his head lurched about when he
chose feedback. In polite response,
his guitar seemed to come alive. The
bird-chirps and tiger-growls he fas
hioned sounded better than any syn
thesizer which would seek to do the
same. The man was enlightened.
The Dream Syndicate is not out to
impress anybody. But it cares about
its doings. It's come out of the
Medicine Show episode wiser, its
music, crisper. The sacking of Tommy
Zvoncheck (keyboardist) and —
presumably — Sandy Pearlman
(producer) portends a rosy future
from the look of Thursday's show.
The band must follow through in this
manner by producing its new material
uncompromisingly. Its new live al
bum is a great first step. A more
garage-oriented sound will benefit its
refreshed arrangements and atti
tudes, leading to another round of ex
posure and acclaim. Find the new
improved Dream Syndicate on a bill
somewhere, do yourself a favor, and
attend. If you like new guitar music,
you deserve to see it. And the band
deserves the ticket sales.
