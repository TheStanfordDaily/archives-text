# Minutemen, PiL: anarchy in the USA
## 
### TONY TRAN 
It was a magical evening. Friday
night at the Keystone, I had the good
fortune to see two bands who
represented the best qualities of what
"punk/underground" music was
supposed to mean and be. The bands
— the Minuteman from San Pedro
and Public Image Ltd. (PiL) from
London — mesmerized the audience
in two compact, intense, nearly flaw
less sets. Together, they prove again
that their brand of adventurous, un
derground, "semi-popular" (a term
coined by rock critic Robert

Christgau of the Village Voice to
describe the degree of attractiveness
that this type of music holds for the
average masses of rock consumers)
rock 'n' roll may be the only kind of
rock 'n' roll that really counts today.
Punk rock, a broad rock genre that
includes various offshoots such as
post-punk, dirge, thrash and
hardcore, is necessary and important
not only because it offers an alterna
tive or choice to pop or top-40 music,
but also because from a pure and
ideological standpoint, it is made for
love of music, not for money or

profit. I am not saying that all top-40
or mainstream pop should be dis
missed as bland, repetitive and
meaningless, or that punk is good or
suitable for everyone.
The fact remains that thanks to
punk rock, the music fan in the
relatively apathetic musical atmo
sphere of the 1980s — as compared
to the '70s (Bob Marley), the '60s
(Bob Dylan) and the '50s (Elvis) —
can believe in rock as something
much more than mere entertainment.
Punk is a whole philosophy and life
style. Since much of punk and inde

pendent rock is radical, protest,
political music at its most active and
articulate nature — above the
frenzied beat and power chords — its
angst-ridden voice cries out against
such issues as racism, sexism, war and
the ways of the rich and the establish
ment while advocating anarchy and
youth advancement, organization and
independence. Listeners react in dif
ferent ways to punk rock. Most hate
it with a passion; the relative few who
believe in it would die for it.
Then there are people like me, who
believe in pluralism (that there are

only two kinds of music — good or
bad — and no really worthless rock
genre, except for post-Zeppelin
heavy metal). I am able to say that 1
like the Sex Pistols, Jerry Lee Lewis,
Funkadelic, Joni Mitchell, Muddy
Waters, Bob Marley, the Boss and
early Dolly Parton in the same
breath.
The punk philosophy carries over
to the beautifully radical music that is
made — harsh, melodic and dense it
the same time. From the musical per
spective alone, without even consid
ering the political and socially

conscious overtones, it's understand
able why punk, as with all previous
underground music, will never gain
mass appeal on the radio.
Again, keep in mind that about 95
percent of the music fans in the
United States consider rock 'n' roll as
nothing more than catchy love songs
and background music while doing
the dishes. It follows necessarily that
the majority of punk bands burn out
after a couple of years; they make a
statement and then disappear, out of
money (or new ideas). Among the
ones that are able to etch a longer
term existence and achieve some
degree of popularity (such as X, the
Clash and Black Flag), rare examples
exist where the band is able to remain
bound to its original punk ideologies.
Note X's dismal turn to heavy metal
on "Wild Thing" and the Clash's
lightweight pop songs on "Combat
Rock."
The Minutemen (consisting of D.
Boon on vocals and guitar, Mike
Watt on bass and vocals and George
Hurley on drums) are a group that
has been able to remain together
since its beginnings in 1980, and still
stay dedicated to its uniquely fiery
and explosive underground sound.
Part of the reason for the group's

ability to escape the loopholes of
commercialism and resist compro
mise lies in its independent and
revolutionary brand of music (even in
terms of punk) that does not fit any
narrow categorization, allowing for
unrestrained freedom in creativity

The tempo in one song can alternate
abruptly between frenzied fast and
soothing slow, and the mood ranges
from eccentric to mainstream.

and originality.
The Minutemen play hybrid rock
consisting of many influences: hard
core (shades of Husker Du, 7

Seconds, Dead Kennedys), poetic
rock (Patti Smith) and classic Ameri
can rock (Chuck Berry and
Creedence Clearwater Revival).
The three Minutemen succeed in
taking full advantage of the unpre
dictability and variety that this kind

of hybridized, "abstract" music pro
vides; their music is to rock 'n' roll
what Cubism was to modern art. The
unpredictable surges and changes can

be quite exhilarating. I heir songs are
remarkable for quick structural al
terations: The tempo in one song can
alternate abruptly between frenzied
fast and soothing slow, and the mood
ranges from eccentric to mainstream.
The band members are able to ac
complish all this because they are vir
tuoso musicians. Boon effortlessly
makes his guitar bleed ethereal solos
or crank out staccato rhythms, as the
case requires — and even sings at the
right times. Watt (bass) and Hurley
(drums) did not so much play their in
struments as attack them, creating a
tornado of sound effects that some
how all fit together. The three
musicians incessantly trade roles of
playing lead and rhythm patterns in
each of the 40-odd songs (the
majority well under two minutes
long) that were performed.
The variety of influences on the
band contributing to the unique na
ture of its sound — contradictory yet
