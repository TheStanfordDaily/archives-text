# Minutemen, PiL: anarchy in the USA
## 
### TONY TRAN 
It was a magical evening. Friday
night at the Keystone, I had the good
fortune to see two bands who
represented the best qualities of what
"punk/underground" music was
supposed to mean and be. The bands
— the Minuteman from San Pedro
and Public Image Ltd. (PiL) from
London — mesmerized the audience
in two compact, intense, nearly flaw
less sets. Together, they prove again
that their brand of adventurous, un
derground, "semi-popular" (a term
coined by rock critic Robert

Christgau of the Village Voice to
describe the degree of attractiveness
that this type of music holds for the
average masses of rock consumers)
rock 'n' roll may be the only kind of
rock 'n' roll that really counts today.
Punk rock, a broad rock genre that
includes various offshoots such as
post-punk, dirge, thrash and
hardcore, is necessary and important
not only because it offers an alterna
tive or choice to pop or top-40 music,
but also because from a pure and
ideological standpoint, it is made for
love of music, not for money or

profit. I am not saying that all top-40
or mainstream pop should be dis
missed as bland, repetitive and
meaningless, or that punk is good or
suitable for everyone.
The fact remains that thanks to
punk rock, the music fan in the
relatively apathetic musical atmo
sphere of the 1980s — as compared
to the '70s (Bob Marley), the '60s
(Bob Dylan) and the '50s (Elvis) —
can believe in rock as something
much more than mere entertainment.
Punk is a whole philosophy and life
style. Since much of punk and inde

pendent rock is radical, protest,
political music at its most active and
articulate nature — above the
frenzied beat and power chords — its
angst-ridden voice cries out against
such issues as racism, sexism, war and
the ways of the rich and the establish
ment while advocating anarchy and
youth advancement, organization and
independence. Listeners react in dif
ferent ways to punk rock. Most hate
it with a passion; the relative few who
believe in it would die for it.
Then there are people like me, who
believe in pluralism (that there are

only two kinds of music — good or
bad — and no really worthless rock
genre, except for post-Zeppelin
heavy metal). I am able to say that 1
like the Sex Pistols, Jerry Lee Lewis,
Funkadelic, Joni Mitchell, Muddy
Waters, Bob Marley, the Boss and
early Dolly Parton in the same
breath.
The punk philosophy carries over
to the beautifully radical music that is
made — harsh, melodic and dense it
the same time. From the musical per
spective alone, without even consid
ering the political and socially

conscious overtones, it's understand
able why punk, as with all previous
underground music, will never gain
mass appeal on the radio.
Again, keep in mind that about 95
percent of the music fans in the
United States consider rock 'n' roll as
nothing more than catchy love songs
and background music while doing
the dishes. It follows necessarily that
the majority of punk bands burn out
after a couple of years; they make a
statement and then disappear, out of
