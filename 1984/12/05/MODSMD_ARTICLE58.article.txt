## 'The Rain God'—the unique Mexican paradox The 						Rain God

"The Rain God"

A desert flower is paradoxical. It is
life amid death. In a dusty sea of
sand it is a tiny oasis of moisture, of
fragrance, of endurance and, yet, of
fragility. A desert flower is seemingly
out of place and therefore almost un
real. It is like the mirages which are
real, because we see them, but which
do not actually exist. The paradox is
perplexing. Still, a desert in full
bloom after a storm is a subtle ex
pression of immense power — the
power of living things. "The Rain
God," by Professor Arturo Islas,
communicates a similar power. His
novel follows the Angel family from
its ancestral origins in the heart of
northern Mexico to a dusty Texas
border town on the banks of the Rio
Grande.
The members of the Angel family
are just like those desert flowers —
thorny and beautiful at the same
time. It is their "thorniness" that
makes them so appealing, believable
and realistic. The Angels are all won
dertullv imperfect people. The most
important feature of these characters,
to each of which a separate section of
the book is devoted, is the fact that
they are ordinary, yet not
stereotyped. Islas does not portray
the Chicano as an anti-hero avenging
"Anglo oppression," but rather has
him leading a mainstream life which
is distinctively Mexican-American
and very authentic. The "Chicano
gang member" motif which surfaces
in recent Chicano (or pseudo-
Chicano) novels, due to its popular
appeal in American markets, is based
on stereotypes that are not indicative
of mainstream Mexican-American
life. It is refreshing to read a novel
that avoids this simplification.
The Angels are like any other
family. They have their share of ec
centricities, sibling rivalries, dark
secrets, guilt, disappointment, times

of joy, fear, love and sorrow. But the
driving force in "The Rain God" is
death. Each member of the family
must come to terms with the death of
loved ones. Death functions as the
all-powerful force. It alternately
unites and divides the Angels. It in
fluences decisions they make, and
each time it changes their lives in a
lasting way.
Death would not have the impact it
does if Islas did not make the reader
care about the Angels. The family
members emanate a haunting
familiarity because they are all like

people we know. Miguel Angel,
called "Miguel Chico" in the Spanish
diminutive, is caught in a love-hate
relationship with his father Miguel
Grande. Miguel Chico cannot
decide between respectfully loving his
father or hating him for neglecting a
childhood illness which handicapped
Miguel Chico for the rest of his life.
Miguel Grande is torn between his
love for his wife, Juanita, and his lust
for his wife's best friend, Lola. There
is young cousin JoEl, a sensitive boy
who can tell when a thunderstorm is
coming when he feels the presence of
angels. Gentle Uncle Felix, a happy,
warm, affectionate man, meets with a
brutal death. Above all, the matriarch
of the Angel family, Mama Chona is a
dominant presence. Mama Chona is
devoted to the "old ways" and will
not stand "malcriados" and their col

loquial Spanish in her presence. A
devout Catholic, she symbolizes rev
erence, stability and a certain mys
ticism. Islas draws his characters with
prosaic sensuality and a genuine love
for them.
Through the story of "The Rain
God" runs a strain of "magical
realism," a legacy of major Latin
American writers like the Colombian
Gabriel Garcia Marquez, the master
of what he calls "lo real maravilloso."
Magical realism is a twisting of nor
mal experience until there is only a
vague sense of reality remaining. It is
a combination of the real with the su
pernatural. This eerie quality is par
ticularly apparent in Islas' treatment
of two of his characters. Mama Chona
and JoEl. They have a sensitivity
beyond that of normal people, insight
into the world beyond. If any mortals
are graced with the power to speak
with God himself. Mama Chona and
JoEl must be among them. Magical
realism is characteristic of Spanish-
American literature, and Islas incor
porates it marvelously.
Filled with bountiful prose and
imagery, "The Rain God" is a
moving novel of great depth and in
sight. The story is like the desert blos
som: penetrating to the mind and eye.
It will touch the heart of Chicano and
non-Chicano alike. I would not be
surprised if this work were somewhat
autobiographical because it is filled
with so much love and understanding,
and it expresses with a beautiful
Mexican authenticity the author's
communion with his subject. Like the
desert flower, there is a paradox
unique to Mexican nature and
folklore which Islas obviously knows
of and around which he perhaps
structured his novel. One of his ob
servations might refer to his own
work: "To himself, he thought how
only a Mexican song could mix sad
ness and laughter like that so that one
could cry and sing at the same time."
