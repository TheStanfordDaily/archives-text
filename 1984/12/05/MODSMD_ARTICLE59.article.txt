Last year, Frederick Barthelme was widely acclaimed
for his first collection of short stories, "Moon Deluxe."
Now Barthelme has written his first novel — "Second
Marriage," the story of an unusual love triangle. "Second
Marriage" is based on the same fine foundation that made
"Moon Deluxe" successful. Bartheleme's world is both
specific and compelling — utterly believable characters
behave in ways that seem true to their nature, yet some
how, both characters and situations are surreal.
"Second Marriage" is the story of Henry, who has just
married Theo, his second wife. Life goes on fairly
smoothly until Clare, Henry's first wife, appears on the
scene. Faced with her own domestic problems, Clare
decides to make herself a part of her ex-husband's
household. Theo, instead of being jealous, falls in love
with Clare, and the two women ask Henry to move out.
The credibility of the characters stems from their un
nervingly familiar suburban gestures — they eat at the Pie

A lonely girl follows Henry home one day and
instantly becomes a part of the household. Theo digs a
hole in the backyard, enlarges it from pit size to tomb
size to van size, and eventually pushes Henry into it.
Barthelme makes everything seem so normal.

Queen, notice the brands of car tires and toasters, and in
vest in computer games. Due to Barthelme's meticulous
detail, the novel approaches the surreality of an ultra
realist painting. In any situation, the reader would never
notice all of the details Barthelme forces us to notice.
The unique atmosphere in "Second Marriage" begins
when these real characters start doing bizarre things. A
lonely girl follows Henry home one day and instantly
becomes a part of the household. Theo digs a hole in the
backyard, enlarges it from pit size to tomb size to van size,
and eventually pushes Henry into it during a rainstorm.
Henry's neighbor, Duncan, goes into a tirade about his
failed sexuality after a fight between their dogs. The odd
ness of these events is due partly to their own nature and
partly to Barthelme's utterly indifferent treatment of
them. Somehow, he makes everything seem so normal
that we begin to wonder if perhaps ordinary people do be
have the way Barthelme-folk do.
Actually, the indifference to the oddities of the world of
"Second Marriage" stem not from Barthelme but from

Henry, who tells us the story. Henry is a remarkably un
reflective person — Clare and Theo's behavior is con
stantly bewildering, and though Henry tries to under
stand, he only feels contusion and anger. Also, though
Henry often reacts, he rarely acts — we get the feeling
Henry always has been and always will be acted on. Even
the brief affair he attempts is initiated by the woman in
volved.
"Second Marriage" could have been a story about
Henry's actions and decisions, but it isn't. And mar
velously, we understand why.
Theo is an enigma to us as well as to Henry — perhaps
too much so. She is essentially the character who calls the
shots in "Second Marriage" — she decides that she, her
daughter Rachel and Henry will move into a house, that
Clare will move in with them and that Henry will move
out. Because she is such a forceful character, it is unclear
whether Henry's apathy is a cause for her decisiveness or
a result of it.
The problem with Theo is that she does all of the decid
ing, yet she is the most psychologically elusive of all of the

characters. We never quite know how much control she
has over the things she does and the decisions she makes
— whether everything is part of a process, or whether she
is simply trying to "wait and see where things stop," as she
tells Henry. Since we don't really know Theo, occasionally
the entire novel loses focus — her actions become the ac
tions of an undefined force, of fate more than a character,
and as such, they become less interesting.
These moments do not last, however, and they are set
against the desperately real situation of Henry. The mo
ments between Henry and his first wife's ex-lover are
hilarious and bittersweet. Rachel's attempt to patch up
this second marriage almost types her as the typical "child
from a troubled home," but she, like all of Barthelme's
charaters, transcends type.
Finally,"Second Marriage" is a wonderful book to read
to learn about the ways people behave — or don't behave.
Take your pick. It's a Barthelme world.
