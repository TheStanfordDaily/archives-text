# Local residents rap sites

### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
As the Stanford Board of
Trustees prepares to take ac
tion on the site of the Ronald
Reagan Presidential Library,
several community groups have
already taken action of their
own on the matter.
Residents of Ladera and
Portola Valley have expressed
displeasure over the proposed
site on Alpine Road, and a
two-county committee has
opposed all three sites. Here on
campus, at least one faculty
member has questioned the ap
propriateness of the Junipero
Serra site.
The University's Reagan Li
brary Planning Committee con
sidered more than 20 sites for
the facility before recommend
ing three to the board of trus
tees: Junipero Serra
Boulevard, in the hills above
Lake Lagunita; Deer Creek
