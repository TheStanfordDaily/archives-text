# Local residents rap sites
## 
### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
As the Stanford Board of
Trustees prepares to take ac
tion on the site of the Ronald
Reagan Presidential Library,
several community groups have
already taken action of their
own on the matter.
Residents of Ladera and
Portola Valley have expressed
displeasure over the proposed
site on Alpine Road, and a
two-county committee has
opposed all three sites. Here on
campus, at least one faculty
member has questioned the ap
propriateness of the Junipero
Serra site.
The University's Reagan Li
brary Planning Committee con
sidered more than 20 sites for
the facility before recommend
ing three to the board of trus
tees: Junipero Serra
Boulevard, in the hills above
Lake Lagunita; Deer Creek
Road, east of Interstate 280 in the Stanford South dis
trict; and Alpine Road, adjacent to Ladera and Portola
Valley.
All three sites are located on land owned by the Uni
versity.
Unhappy groups from Ladera and Portola Valley
have written letters to the Stanford Board of Trustees ex
plaining why the library should not be located in the
foothills across from the Ladera Shopping Center on
Alpine Road.
According to the results of a poll conducted by the
Ladera Community Association, an overwhelming
majority of Ladera residents oppose a Reagan library
in their neighborhood.
William Larkin, vice president of the association,
said 97 percent of the 231 residents who replied to the
survey are against the Alpine Road site.
Larkin cited the increased community traffic and the
adverse environmental effects as the primary reasons
for the opposition.
"There's already a hazardous (traffic) condition on
Alpine Road," Larkin said. "This is just going to ag
gravate that problem."
As for the environment, Larkin said the library
might disturb a tree nursery and a bike path in the
area.
Larkin also expressed concern over the apparent
precedent that would be set if the University were
allowed to develop land west of 1-280 without first
submitting a master plan.
"Some of us are concerned that it's one of the first
major (campus) developments beyond 280," he said.
"The people feel that the site selection committee
took a very provincial attitude in just looking at it from
a Stanford point of view."
The Portola Valley Town Council also objects to the
Alpine Road site. In a letter to the board of trustees,
council members cited additional traffic and the con
struction of new restaurants, gas stations and motels
that the library might bring.
The Portola Valley council prefers to keep the area
as rural as possible, according to a town official.

The Committee for Green Foothills has voiced ob
jections to all three potential sites on the grounds that
the library should be located on the central campus,
not in areas that might adversely affect Stanford's
neighbors.
"We think the remaining Stanford lands are a
resource for many generations, and they should be
treated with extreme care," said Lennie Roberts,
spokesperson for the committee. She said the large
amount of traffic would put an "intolerable burden"
on Junipero Serra Boulevard, Alpine or Old Page Mill
Roads, depending on the location of the library.
The committee opposes any development of Stan
ford land west of Junipero Serra. The University plan
ning committee, meanwhile, is recommending that the
library not be located east of Junipero Serra.
Planning committee members have stated that the li
brary should not be located in the central-campus area.
Craig Heller, professor of biological sciences and the
chair of the Faculty Senate, has expressed ambivalence
over the Junipero Serra site. Heller is concerned that a
development in this area would ruin the beauty of the
foothills and give prominence to a partisan endeavor.
Heller noted some confusion about the exact loca
tion of this site. Some members of the committee, he
said, have indicated that the library would sit atop a
ridge overlooking campus. If this is the case, Heller
said he would object to the "symbolism" of the loca
tion.
But David Abernethy, professor of political science
and a member of the planning committee, said the
committee has insisted that, if the Junipero Serra site is
chosen, "the buildings be kept low so you won't be
able to see the campus."
Heller said he would be "fairly well satisfied" with
this site as long as it didn't overlook the campus and as
long as no new access road were built from Junipero
Sena.
Current plans indicate that, if this site is chosen,
access will be from the road that currently serves the
Stanford Golf Course and the Center for Advanced
Study in the Behavioral Sciences.
Robert Freelen, director of University Public Affairs
and chair of the planning committee, said the Junipero
Serra site is apparently the one preferred by Reagan.

Study in the Behavioral Sciences.
Robert Freelen, director of University Public Affairs
and chair of the planning committee, said the Junipero
Serra site is apparently the one preferred by Reagan.
As the Stanford Board of
Trustees prepares to take ac
tion on the site of the Ronald
Reagan Presidential Library,
several community groups have
already taken action of their
own on the matter.
Residents of Ladera and
Portola Valley have expressed
displeasure over the proposed
site on Alpine Road, and a
two-county committee has
opposed all three sites. Here on
campus, at least one faculty
member has questioned the ap
propriateness of the Junipero
Serra site.
The University's Reagan Li
brary Planning Committee con
sidered more than 20 sites for
the facility before recommend
ing three to the board of trus
tees: Junipero Serra
Boulevard, in the hills above
Lake Lagunita; Deer Creek
Road, east of Interstate 280 in the Stanford South dis
trict; and Alpine Road, adjacent to Ladera and Portola
Valley.
All three sites are located on land owned by the Uni
versity.
Unhappy groups from Ladera and Portola Valley
have written letters to the Stanford Board of Trustees ex
plaining why the library should not be located in the
foothills across from the Ladera Shopping Center on
Alpine Road.
According to the results of a poll conducted by the
Ladera Community Association, an overwhelming
majority of Ladera residents oppose a Reagan library
in their neighborhood.
William Larkin, vice president of the association,
said 97 percent of the 231 residents who replied to the
survey are against the Alpine Road site.
Larkin cited the increased community traffic and the
adverse environmental effects as the primary reasons
for the opposition.
"There's already a hazardous (traffic) condition on
Alpine Road," Larkin said. "This is just going to ag
gravate that problem."
As for the environment, Larkin said the library
might disturb a tree nursery and a bike path in the
area.
Larkin also expressed concern over the apparent
precedent that would be set if the University were
allowed to develop land west of 1-280 without first
submitting a master plan.
"Some of us are concerned that it's one of the first
major (campus) developments beyond 280," he said.
"The people feel that the site selection committee
took a very provincial attitude in just looking at it from
a Stanford point of view."
The Portola Valley Town Council also objects to the
Alpine Road site. In a letter to the board of trustees,
council members cited additional traffic and the con
struction of new restaurants, gas stations and motels
that the library might bring.
The Portola Valley council prefers to keep the area
as rural as possible, according to a town official.

The Committee for Green Foothills has voiced ob
jections to all three potential sites on the grounds that
the library should be located on the central campus,
not in areas that might adversely affect Stanford's
neighbors.
"We think the remaining Stanford lands are a
resource for many generations, and they should be
treated with extreme care," said Lennie Roberts,
spokesperson for the committee. She said the large
amount of traffic would put an "intolerable burden"
on Junipero Serra Boulevard, Alpine or Old Page Mill
Roads, depending on the location of the library.
The committee opposes any development of Stan
ford land west of Junipero Serra. The University plan
ning committee, meanwhile, is recommending that the
library not be located east of Junipero Serra.
Planning committee members have stated that the li
brary should not be located in the central-campus area.
Craig Heller, professor of biological sciences and the
chair of the Faculty Senate, has expressed ambivalence
over the Junipero Serra site. Heller is concerned that a
development in this area would ruin the beauty of the
foothills and give prominence to a partisan endeavor.
Heller noted some confusion about the exact loca
tion of this site. Some members of the committee, he
said, have indicated that the library would sit atop a
ridge overlooking campus. If this is the case, Heller
said he would object to the "symbolism" of the loca
tion.
But David Abernethy, professor of political science
and a member of the planning committee, said the
committee has insisted that, if the Junipero Serra site is
chosen, "the buildings be kept low so you won't be
able to see the campus."
Heller said he would be "fairly well satisfied" with
this site as long as it didn't overlook the campus and as
long as no new access road were built from Junipero
Sena.
Current plans indicate that, if this site is chosen,
access will be from the road that currently serves the
Stanford Golf Course and the Center for Advanced
Study in the Behavioral Sciences.
Robert Freelen, director of University Public Affairs
and chair of the planning committee, said the Junipero
Serra site is apparently the one preferred by Reagan.
