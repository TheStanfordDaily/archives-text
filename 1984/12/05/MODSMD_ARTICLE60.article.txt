following juxtaposition of one of the
lyrics sung, "Punk rock saved our
lives" (British punk influence) and its
inclusion in the set of versions of two

greatest American roots rock band of

— let's not forget the contributions of
such American efforts as the
Ramones, the New York Dolls, the
Stooges, the MCS and the Velvet Un

Back in those days of upheaval in
the summer of 1977, Rotten's of
fensively obnoxious stage behavior
and all-around badness helped make
