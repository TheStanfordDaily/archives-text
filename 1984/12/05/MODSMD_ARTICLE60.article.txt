logical — can be demonstrated in the
following juxtaposition of one of the
lyrics sung, "Punk rock saved our
lives" (British punk influence) and its
inclusion in the set of versions of two
'60s rock classics done by perhaps the
greatest American roots rock band of
all time, Creedence Clearwater
Revival: the obscure, politically
tinted "Don't Look Now," and the
more well-known "Green River."
The Minutemen's wide sphere of
influences adds depth to their musi
cal, lyrical prowess and inventiveness.
The result is funky, vivacious music
that is intense, scintillating and
liberating in its social consciousness
and structural changes. The audience
is kept on edge and wary, never
knowing what to expect next. The
Minutemen are among the best rock
bands in the country. The band's al
bums are distributed by the great
label SST (home also for Husker Du
and Black Flag). I recommend all of

them, particularly "What Makes a
Man Start Fires" and "Double Nick
els on the Dime."
The Minutemen were followed by a
band that's a bit more well-known,
Public Image Ltd., with its front man,
the indomitable Johnny Rotten
(a.k.a. John Lydon, or according to
Neil Young, Rotten Johnny). Our
hero's claim to fame, as anyone who
considers himself a self-respecting fan
should know, was being lead vocalist
for Britain's infamous Sex Pistols —
rock's first punk band (or were they?
— let's not forget the contributions of
such American efforts as the
Ramones, the New York Dolls, the
Stooges, the MCS and the Velvet Un
derground).
Back in those days of upheaval in
the summer of 1977, Rotten's of
fensively obnoxious stage behavior
and all-around badness helped make

the Sex Pistols the world's most hated
hand. By trying to project a had,
demonic image on stage at the
Keystone, he did his best to show the
crowd that he hasn't mellowed out.
His voice remains one of the two
greatest punk rock voices (along with
Joe Strummer's), compelling in its
sustained, almost unbearable high
pitched and snarling quality. There
was much interaction between Rotten
and the crowd. He continuously
taunted the audience, and spat on
those of us who had the nerve to
manually gesture our disapproval of
his conduct. He was as cocky and self
centered as ever (remember the Pis
tols' song "No Feelings"? — "I've got
no feelings for anybody else . . . ex
cept for myself"); and he never
stopped parodying himself.
During the song "Religion," as he
held up a fluorescent halo behind his
head akin to a Christ figure, the irony
was at once ridiculously inappropri
ate and unerringly apt. For all the
"devil" connotations, we still worship
Johnny Rotten as we do a god.
Still, even though I never had the
opportunity, or the good sense, to see
the Sex Pistols when they were kick
ing, I could not help but think that
perhaps Rotten's stage antics and be
havior Friday had more of a meaning
or urgency (as I assumed they were
when he was a Sex Pistol). For one
thing. Public Image L.td. is not the
Sex Pistols; the band doesn't even
play punk rock per se, but more of a
brand of tech no-rock and avant
garde "New Age" music (the mood
was completed by the saturation of
eerie, unworldly green light on the
band for much of the time, making
the stage resemble the inside of a
spaceship, or some remote planet).
The group's sound, hypnotically
and subtly potent on record (listen to
"Second Edition") achieves a power
on a different level in concert — it is
more tense, rough and tangible. The
band played four songs from the new
album "This is What You Want. . . .
This is What You Get," but somehow
curiously omitted the great single
from the album, "This Is Not a Love
Song." Beside this, my chief com
plaint was the concert's length. PiL
played 13 songs, including encores, in
about 50 minutes.

punk rock past, present and future in
two brilliant sets of soul-uplifting,

is liberated of categorization or con

ample room left for growth in
creativity, as well as the capacity to
make more vital music. Let's hope
that the same will hold true for

At the Keystone Friday night, 1
witnessed the coming together of
punk rock past, present and future in
two brilliant sets of soul-uplifting,
radical music. The Minutemen,
playing original, explosive music that
is liberated of categorization or con
strictions, showed that they have
ample room left for growth in
creativity, as well as the capacity to
make more vital music. Let's hope
that the same will hold true for
former punk ringleader Johnny Rot
ten and his current band. Public
Image Ltd., with its own brand of
post-punk, electro-synthetic pop
rock.

logical — can be demonstrated in the
following juxtaposition of one of the
lyrics sung, "Punk rock saved our
lives" (British punk influence) and its
inclusion in the set of versions of two
'60s rock classics done by perhaps the
greatest American roots rock band of
all time, Creedence Clearwater
Revival: the obscure, politically
tinted "Don't Look Now," and the
more well-known "Green River."
The Minutemen's wide sphere of
influences adds depth to their musi
cal, lyrical prowess and inventiveness.
The result is funky, vivacious music
that is intense, scintillating and
liberating in its social consciousness
and structural changes. The audience
is kept on edge and wary, never
knowing what to expect next. The
Minutemen are among the best rock
bands in the country. The band's al
bums are distributed by the great
label SST (home also for Husker Du
and Black Flag). I recommend all of

them, particularly "What Makes a
Man Start Fires" and "Double Nick
els on the Dime."
The Minutemen were followed by a
band that's a bit more well-known,
Public Image Ltd., with its front man,
the indomitable Johnny Rotten
(a.k.a. John Lydon, or according to
Neil Young, Rotten Johnny). Our
hero's claim to fame, as anyone who
considers himself a self-respecting fan
should know, was being lead vocalist
for Britain's infamous Sex Pistols —
rock's first punk band (or were they?
— let's not forget the contributions of
such American efforts as the
Ramones, the New York Dolls, the
Stooges, the MCS and the Velvet Un
derground).
Back in those days of upheaval in
the summer of 1977, Rotten's of
fensively obnoxious stage behavior
and all-around badness helped make

the Sex Pistols the world's most hated
hand. By trying to project a had,
demonic image on stage at the
Keystone, he did his best to show the
crowd that he hasn't mellowed out.
His voice remains one of the two
greatest punk rock voices (along with
Joe Strummer's), compelling in its
sustained, almost unbearable high
pitched and snarling quality. There
was much interaction between Rotten
and the crowd. He continuously
taunted the audience, and spat on
those of us who had the nerve to
manually gesture our disapproval of
his conduct. He was as cocky and self
centered as ever (remember the Pis
tols' song "No Feelings"? — "I've got
no feelings for anybody else . . . ex
cept for myself"); and he never
stopped parodying himself.
During the song "Religion," as he
held up a fluorescent halo behind his
head akin to a Christ figure, the irony
was at once ridiculously inappropri
ate and unerringly apt. For all the
"devil" connotations, we still worship
Johnny Rotten as we do a god.
Still, even though I never had the
opportunity, or the good sense, to see
the Sex Pistols when they were kick
ing, I could not help but think that
perhaps Rotten's stage antics and be
havior Friday had more of a meaning
or urgency (as I assumed they were
when he was a Sex Pistol). For one
thing. Public Image L.td. is not the
Sex Pistols; the band doesn't even
play punk rock per se, but more of a
brand of tech no-rock and avant
garde "New Age" music (the mood
was completed by the saturation of
eerie, unworldly green light on the
band for much of the time, making
the stage resemble the inside of a
spaceship, or some remote planet).
The group's sound, hypnotically
and subtly potent on record (listen to
"Second Edition") achieves a power
on a different level in concert — it is
more tense, rough and tangible. The
band played four songs from the new
album "This is What You Want. . . .
This is What You Get," but somehow
curiously omitted the great single
from the album, "This Is Not a Love
Song." Beside this, my chief com
plaint was the concert's length. PiL
played 13 songs, including encores, in
about 50 minutes.
