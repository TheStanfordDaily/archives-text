## The
						pursuit of excellence: searching for art in Palo Alto 
### MARK KING 
Being an art aficionado — or just a
humanist in general — might seem a
daunting prospect at times for a Stan
ford student. The heart of Silicon
Valley might seem to be an unlikely
environment for an art lover. But is
this actually the case?
Not at all. One need not escape to
San Francisco to view some of the
most exciting and professional work
on the Peninsula — or on the West
Coast, for that matter. Stanford and
Palo Alto are home to a generous
sprinkling of top-notch galleries. Not
only are there several excellent small
galleries, but there is also an unusual
degree of diversity and variety among
them.
Within the area of a few city blocks
in downtown Palo Alto, for example,
you will find a chic, trend-setting
gallery that claims to be the proving
ground for a number of San Francisco
galleries: an artists' cooperative
gallery; a superb photography
showroom; and a community art
league, among others.
One need not stray from campus to
find an excellent showroom of art
from around the world and from a va
riety of periods. The Stanford Univer
sity Art Gallery, located near the
Cummings Art Building, has rotating
exhibits that change four or five times
a year.
The gallery was founded in 1917
largely through donations by Thomas
Welton Stanford, brother of Leland
Stanford. The gallery, which consists
of three rooms, is currently showing
work by the studio art faculty.
At the entrance of the current ex
hibition stands a bronze statue by
Nathan Oliveira. The Quixote-like
"Standing Figure with Stick," whiqh
was cast in 1983, seems both to
beckon and warn the visitor. Known
for his work in several different
media, this most recent work once
again illustrates Oliveira's versatility.
The first room displays the most
recent work of Prof. Keith Boyle,
Asst. Prof. Kristina Branch, Prof.
Matt Kahn, and Prof. Frank Lobdell,
all faculty members in the Art De
partment. Boyle's contribution to the
exhibit is his large abstract canvasses
done in acrylic and oil. The paintings
are expressionistic works of subdued
purples, dark reds and greens.
On either side of a wall that divides
the room hang Matt Kahn's oval and
fan-shaped canvasses arrayed with
dizzying fine lines of black, white and
grey. The delicacy of the lines and the
varied shape of the canvasses make
the works appear light and free
spirited.
One of the works, entitled "Delta,"
seems with its undulating form like a
butterfly that has stopped to rest a
moment on the wall before taking to
flight once again. This room also dis
plays Lobdell's large abstract oils of
geometric forms and Branch's pas
tels, including a dream-like "San
Egidio."
The middle room of the Stanford
gallery shows the three-dimensional
work of Greg Lynch, pieces that look
like sculpted origami. Richard Ran
dell's day-glo logs also occupy the

room. The logs, some of them
mounted, others suffused with neon
light, fluoresce startlingly.
Joel Leivick's and Laura Volkerd
ing's photography grace the final
room. Leivick's work concentrates on
Connecticut scenes, the most inter
esting of which are his shots of a
quarry. Volkerding has an astonish
ing panorama made up of over a
dozen prints positioned side to side.
Her work consists mainly of
landscapes which have been called ar
chitectural.
The current faculty exhibit will be
on display through Dec. 30. January
will bring a series of 18th-century En
glish paintings, drawings and prints.
And every June brings the opportu
nity to see what student artists have
been doing, since the last show of the
year generally exhibits graduate stu
dents' work.
Gallery hours are 10 a.m. to 4:45
p.m. Tuesday through Thursday, and
1 to 4:45 p.m. Saturday and Sunday.
Around the corner from the gallery
you'll find The Gallery Bookshop
which carries art books, cards, prints,
calendars, posters and jewelry. The
giftshop's hours are 10 a.m. to 4:30
p.m. Tuesday through Friday and 1 to
4:30 p.m. Saturday and Sunday.
You won't want to limit your ex
cursion into the world of art to Stan
ford, of course. Palo Alto offers a
number of galleries to supplement
anyone's interests. The Smith Ander
sen Gallery, at 200 Homer St., has
received a great deal of publicity and
has been steadily building its ex
tremely high reputation over the past
15 years.
The bright, airy aesthetics of the
spacious two-room gallery lends
themselves well to the relatively few
but carefully chosen representative
samples of one or two artists per
showing. As with the other galleries
mentioned in this article, Smith An
dersen is a showcase for purchasable
art. While Stanford students are not
likely to buy works priced in
hundreds or thousands of dollars, the
gallery is, of course, open to the
public. There is no admission fee at
any of the galleries.
Smith Andersen's current exhibit
features the work of two artists, Joan
Ward Summers and Craig Henry.
The first room shows Summers' large
colorful tapestries. Summers designs
the tapestries, supervises the dying of
the woAl f "and has' the finished
tapestry Woven in Mexico.
The result is a modern, glorious
tapestry. One called "Flotsam and
Jetsam" presents a lively collage of
color; another, "Picnic," looks like
Miro on tapestry. The seven
tapestries currently on exhibit mea
sure from about 14 to 28 square feet.
Some represent a limited edition,
while others are unique; prices for the
tapestries range from $1,200 to
$3,000.
The second room at Smith Ander
sen shows a selection of monotypes
by Craig Henry. The director of the
gallery, Paula Kirkeby, championed
the monotype long before the form
was fashionable or even acceptable,
showing monotypes by Stanford's

Oliveira 15 years ago. Now the
gallery appears to be setting a trend
in reviving the monotype. The
monotype process consists of painting
a flat surface, such as metal, and then
printing the image.
Henry's chromatic examples illus
trate the medium in its purest form.
These are darkly stunning images,
understated in their simplicity.
Beautifully matted and displayed, the
prints are priced at $525 each.
The Smith Andersen Gallery is
worth visiting if only to see the rustic,
charmingly detailed tin toys created
by a late Mexican artisan named Cor
ral. At times, fortunately for us, un

appreciated genius — rural and
primitive in this case — is discovered.
Corral's tin toys are magic created
from ordinary objects. Cans and
boxes have been transformed un
recognizably; the results would
delight even the most wary of modern
art observers. They are displayed to
advantage in a separate annex only
recendy opened. Prices for the toys
range from $200 to $5,000.
The Smith Andersen Gallery is
open from 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
Tuesday through Saturday.
Of quite different atmosphere and
flavor is The Gallery House at 538
Ramona St. Established in 1957, The

Gallery House is the Peninsula's only
artists' cooperative. Approximately
55 artists own and operate the
gallery, which is supported by mem
bership fees and by sales of its work.
Monthly shows aim at bringing
quality work by new and mid-career
professional artists to the attention of
Palo Alto and neighboring commun
ities. Members are selected by a jury
review process; each member is en
titled to a one-person show once a
year.
A wide variety of media is regularly
displayed at Gallery House, including
painting, sculpture, fiber, prints, pot
tery, jewelry, graphics and photogra

phy. There is a small graphics ro< m
and a ceramics room. You will fi id
dozens of affordable objets d'art lor
sale, including original etchings, 10
inches by seven inches, matted, or
$13; hand-screened notecards (10 or
$3.75); lovely ceramic Christiras
decorations for $2.50 a piece. Haril
crafted silver jewelry by Edith So ti
mers is appreciably more expensive;
her work has a primitive, N 'w
Mexico quality.
Because of the number of media
represented, there are many iter is,
but few of any one type. Yemiina
Rabin is the only photographer cur
rently represented; her sharp, oi

chestrated compositions balance
color and subject in a way that defies
realism.
You will find something of every
thing at The Gallery House, a com
fortable gallery in which to browse
and linger over objects. A gallery of
fine arts by some of the Bay Area's
finest artists, The Gallery House is
less a museum than a salon or home
for living arts. Hours are from 10 a.m.
to 7 p.m. Monday through Saturday.
Next door at 540 Ramona is an ex
ceptional find, The Photographer's
Gallery of Palo Alto. The Photog
rapher's Gallery is the only photogra
phy gallery between San Jose and San

Francisco, and it would be difficult to
find a better one anywhere.
The gallery, which consists of one
long room, features originals and edi
tions of both master photographers
and established local artists. It offers
a wide selection of both black-and
white and color photography, and
subject matter that ranges from tradi
tional landscapes to abstractions.
A new exhibit goes up this week, a
group show featuring Ansel Adams,
Don Worth, Bruce Barnbaum, Chris
Rainier, John Wimberly and other
equally known artists. Many of the
featured artists will be on hand for
the opening of the new exhibit on

Dec. 7, coinciding with the gallery's
second anniversary.
The new show will feature "big
color" in general. Francis Sakamoto's
Cibachrome prints are a case in point:
The colors are searing in his sunset
landscapes. His long-lens photogra
phy features scenes of Death Valley
and Mono Lake. Barnbaum's dye
transfer prints (a selective color
printing technique) further illustrate
the intensity of color. In contrast are
his black-and-white photographs of
Arizona's Antelope Canyon.
One highly respected local artist,
Don Worth (formerly an assistant to
Ansel Adams), will show works from

the 19705. Among them are "Trees
and Fog," a soft, mysterious picture
of blending images and gentle repose.
The subject and tone of most work at
the gallery, in fact, suggest serious
ness and depth.
Prices at the gallery start at $150.
Some of the Ansel Adams pieces, for
example, including some rare and less
familiar prints which will be part of
the exhibit, are priced at $20,000.
The Photographer's Gallery offers
original fine art that is collectable.
The gallery maintains a large inven
tory and offers consignments. Posters
and books are also available.
The directors of the gallery are

very helpful; they see one of their re
sponsibilities in particular as educat
ing the public on the relatively new
art form of photography. Hours are
11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Tuesday through
Friday, and from 12 to 5 p.m. Satur
day.
Not far down the street is a very
different kind of art center. The Palo
Alto Art Club at 668 Ramona St. is
literally an art center. A non-profit
gallery, the Art Club is also — and
perhaps most importantly — an edu
cational organization. It offers
classes, workshops and lectures in the
visual arts to the community.
As such, the Art Club is unique to
Palo Alto and, moreover, is the
second largest art league in the na
tion. PAAC was founded in 1921 by
several prominent artists and art
teachers in the area. (Founders in
cluded A. B. Clark, head of the Stan
ford Art Department, and Pedro de
Lemos, curator of the Stanford
Museum.)
The Art Club has gone through
many changes in its 63-year history.
Members first met in each others'
homes; later, as the group grew, it
moved into a wing of the Palo Alto
Library, and still later, into a church.
Its current location, acquired in
1965, houses six studios where classes
are held in painting, graphics,
printmaking, sculpture, fabric design
and porcelain painting. The club is in
transition again — its name is soon to
become The Pacific Art League of
Palo Alto.
PAAC sponsors community service
shows, offers grants to teachers who
are learning how to teach art, and
sponsors the Northern California
Print Competition held every two
years.
The club's 850 to 900 members in
clude amateurs and professionals who
come from as close as San Francisco
and as far as Monterey; members
may exhibit their work in the gallery.
A variety of media is featured.
The current exhibit consists of
etchings, pastels, oils, watercolors,
sculpture, silkscreen, ceramics and
jewelry. Classes are taught by profes
sionals and often include Stanford
graduate students. Facilities include a
sculpture studio and a printroom for
etching and lithography.
In addition to the regular gallery
featuring members' art, the Elizabeth
Norton Studio on the second floor
has monthly exhibits. The galleries
are open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Mon
day through Friday, and from 10 a.m.
to 4 p.m. on Saturday.
Los Robles Galleries, 167 Hamilton
Ave., is a large, spacious gallery of
professional standing. Its work is
primarily that of Bay Area artists, in
cluding many art faculty of Cali
fornia State University at San Fran
cisco.
Los Robles, now in its 19th year,
recently relocated to a newly con
structed building. The gallery consists
of one attractive, high-ceilinged room
the size of a small auditorium.
A Donald Louthian collage priced
at $750 is one of the first works you
see upon entering. The gallery houses
many attractive items such as a solid

walnut sculpture, modern water
colors and a handcrafted hallway
mirror in a light-colored natural
wood setting that was pictured in a
recent issue of "American Craft."
A number of innovative works by
several artists appears, including
several mixed-idea constructions.
These are canvasses which have
three-dimensional structural aspects
such as windows which jut out from
the canvas plane. The juxtaposition
of painting and reproduced mass
culture artifacts appears in a single
work.
The exhibit at Los Robles changes
the first of every month. A Christmas
show has just opened for December.
Fewer paintings are displayed than
usual in order to accommodate a
wider selection of crafts that sell bet
ter during the Christmas season.
Emphasis currently is on hand
crafted wood items — utilitarian art
such as cutting boards and decorative
chopsticks. The ceramic section is
also plentiful for the holiday season.
Hours at Los Robles Galleries are
from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday
through Sunday.
Our final gallery is an exclusive,
small gallery of abstract and inventive
art. Vorpal Gallery opened only a few
weeks ago at 415 University Ave.
Palo Alto's Vorpal is one of four as
sociated galleries; the others are lo
cated in San Francisco, New York
and Laguna Beach. Vorpal exhibits
highly marketable art and concen
trates on classical, European,
Japanese and modern works.
The small one-room gallery just off
the street with its selective collection
seems to be a museum in miniature.
The white adobe walls, high ceiling
and light monochromatic color
scheme are purely aesthetic. Three
modern sculptures by Linda Vampola
of Southern California are displayed
the length of the room.
The three walls allotted to
presentation currently hold prints and
paintings by M. C. Escher, Jesse Al
len, Jack Hooper and others. Escher's
black-and-white line drawings were
originally promoted by Vorpal's
owner. Escher prints are listed at
$1,000 to $27,000.
Exhibits at thQ new Vorpal will
change frequently because the Palo Alto
gallery has access to all of the Vorpal
galleries. The current exhibit contin
ues through Jan. 15. Coming later in
January are oils by Piet Bekaert, as
well as work by Yozo Hamaguchi and
sculptor Robert Holmes.
Vorpal's director, Verne Freeman,
hopes the gallery will become a part
of life in Palo Alto and stimulate the
cultural scene. Although the works
displayed are costly, this is not a
gallery only for buyers.
Vorpal is a place for people to stop
in and view some of the greatest of
contemporary art. The gallery is well
worth a visit by anyone who ap
preciates the aesthetics of modern
masterpieces. Vorpal is open seven
days a week from 11 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.
Art enthusiasts needn't go far to
find high-quality work. A hotbed of
creativity and art both eclectic and
abundant exists only steps away.
