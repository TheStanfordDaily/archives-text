When you ask Stanford students
to name a good restaurant in the
area, the responses you receive will
range from Mac Arthur Park and the
Gatehouse to any of the plethora of
French, Italian and Chinese places
within 20 minutes of campus.
But you probably won't hear
mention of Waverley Place. That's
too bad, because it's probably one
of the best, yet least known, restau
rants in the vicinity.
Waverley Place is relatively new
to Palo Alto — it's been around
only a year or so — and sits on the
relatively quiet corner of Waverley
Street and Hamilton Avenue.
My friend and I went there on a
Friday night at 6:15. While the bar
was packed with cocktail-hour pa
trons wearing expensive, yuppie
type clothes, the restaurant itself
was relatively empty. We were
seated immediately and promptly
served ice water and warm sour
dough bread with butter.
The restaurant's interior is as
simply decorated as its exterior. The
walls are paneled with wood, the
floor is covered with green carpet
ing and the ceiling is criss-crossed
by stained two-by-fours with lamps
hanging down among them. Each
table is covered with white and tan
tablecloths and a vase of fresh
flowers. The seats are covered with
green felt. Potted trees grow from
clay and brass containers.
In fact, the restaurant, from its
decor to its service to its menu —
salads, pastas and grilled foods —
projects an image of tasteful
simplicity. I called it unpretentious;
my friend, a native New Yorker,
called it "California chic."
The menu is extensive and in
cludes a number of specials — ap

petizers, soups and entrees — that
change daily.
The menu is also expensive. Din
ner for two averages in the range of
$50, so unless you've got a lot of
money you don't mind spending on
one night's worth of food — or your
parents are in town and buying —
Waverley Place may not be such a
good idea.
To start with, 1 chose the Clams
Livornese ($4.75). My friend or
dered onion soup ($3), and we
decided to split an Autumn Salad
($4.95), one of the specials.
The soup came in a big bowl and,
though good, was not exceptional.
The broth was flavorful and in
cluded many onions but was topped
with a rather bland cheese, accord
ing to my companion.
The clams were quite another
story. They were cooked in a sauce
of garlic, shallots, tomatoes and
parsley. The sauce, strong but not
overpowering, complemented the
clams nicely. Perhaps the only prob
lem with the dish was the difficulty
of finding the clams among the
shells and the sauce. After most of
the clams were gone, I was com
pelled to remove the empty shells
and dredge the bowl with my fork to
find the remaining creatures. This,
however, was by no means a major
complaint. The portion size (huge)
more than made up for the trouble
of organizing a clam-salvage mis
sion.
The salad included raddichio,
asparagus, tomatoes, olives,
avocados, hearts of palm, mush
rooms, watercress and walnuts. The
raspberry vinaigrette dressing
added a tangy flavor to the beauti
fully arranged plate.
Other appetizers range from
$3.50 to $5.75, while salads go from
$2.50 for a mixed green salad to
$8.50 for a seafood salad designed
as a main course.

By the time our entrees arrived,
the restaurant had filled con
siderably, so reservations are a good
idea if you plan to go on a weekend
between 7:30 and 9 p.m. The dinner
clientele was older, well dressed and
seemed wealthy.
I had ordered the broiled salmon
($11.95) while my companion chose
one of the evening's specials,
roasted pheasant ($12.95): After
looking at the wine list — all 20
pages of it, divided into sections (i.e.
Italian red wines, French chablis,
California chardonnays, etc.) — 1
decided the easiest course was to or
der a glass of the house white wine,
which turned out to be a very dry,
not too sweet, Bianco D'Oro ($2 a
glass). The wines on the list range in
price from $10 for a bottle of Cali
fornia white to $100 for Dom
' Perignon.
Each entree was accompanied by
pureed celery roots, slices of broiled
potatoes and a vegetable comple
ment made with zucchini, onions
and tomatoes.
The vegetables were cooked well,
but the entrees were outstanding.
The salmon was broiled to perfec
tion, was covered with melted but
ter and served in a deliciously rich
Hollandaise sauce. The pheasant

was equally well done, served with
sauteed mushrooms. The outside
was roasted to a crisp while the
inside was tender and flavorful.
Other entrees range from $6.95
for the vegetarian platter to $14.95
for rack of lamb. Pasta dishes, made
"fresh on the premises," cost be
tween $7 and $7.50.
After a full and satisfying meal,
we ordered a chocolate mousse,
which may have been a mistake. Not
that it was bad. But it was not per
fect, which it needed to be in order
to top our main course.
The mousse came in two choco
late scoops floating in some rich
cream. The mousse had an excellent
flavor, fully chocolatey, but had a
slightly grainy texture.
Other desserts included amar
retto cheese cake and tartufogelato,
both $3.50.
All in all, the evening was com
pletely enjoyable. The service was
courteous, fast and helpful; the food
good; the atmosphere relaxing. It's
expensive, sure, but if you have $50
and nothing better to do with it,
you'd be hard pressed to find a bet
ter restaurant on which to splurge.
