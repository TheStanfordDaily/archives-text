It wouldn't be too far off base to
say that Stanford students and the
community in general are fascinated
with Mexican food.
Within a mile of campus are at least
three Mexican, restaurants that, aside
from their names, are almost indistin
guishable. All three have basically the
same food, the same happy hours, the
same service and the same decor.
The most prominent of those fac
tors, the food, is usually mediocre.
Most of it is not authentic Mexican
food but a spiceless, bland,
Americanized version. Even the
prices at these restaurants are very
similar. Despite the similarities, all
three are doing a brisk business.
Which leaves the adventuresome
diner with a yearn for something dif
ferent. Some place that serves food
that has some taste and character.
So with anticipation, we went to La
Fortuna. Our hopes for authentic
style cooking were enhanced as we
entered the predominantly Hispanic
section of Redwood City. Unfortun
ately, our expectations weren't ex
actly fulfilled. The food was tremen
dously inconsistent.
La Fortuna may be the kind of res
taurant that is decent if you order the
right items and bad if you order the
wrong items.
The meal began with the usual tor
tilla chips and salsa. The chips were
oversalted and slightly stale. The
salsa was watery, had too much chile
powder and wasn't well mixed. The
result was a sauce that was spicy, but
had very little flavor.
It probably didn't help that the two
of us like the kind of salsa that has
diced onions and tomatoes. Nonethe
less, the sauce was not good.
We followed that with the
quesadillas ($2) for appetizers. If you
like melted Monterey Jack cheese
and flour tortillas, it isn't bad, but
that's all it is.
Our main entrees consisted of a
combination plate and the Authentic
Red Mexican-Style Enchiladas with
steak, a house special. Both were sub
stantial improvements over the salsa
and quesadillas, but each had some
problems.

The combination plate ($6.50)
consisted of a chile relleno, a beet
enchilada and a beef taco with beans,
rice, salad and two fresh corn or flour
tortillas. To say the least, it was an
ample meal.
The beef enchilada was the best of
the three. The ground beef filling was
sweetly spiced with melted Jack
cheese. It was good, but nothing to
write about.
The chile relleno had a good batter
around it, but there was too much of
it. So much so that it was hard to taste
the egg, cheese and green chile filling.
The beef taco was mediocre at best.
The ground beef wasn't spiced (which
is strange, considering the enchilada),
and had only lettuce and cheese as
the remaining filling.
The Mexican-style enchiladas ($7)
are sauteed in a red sauce of spices
and herbs and filled with fresh
Mexican cheese. Mexican cheese is
somewhat like fetta cheese, but it
doesn't taste good melted. Especially
not with a sauce that tastes like it has
chalk as one of its ingredients.
Fortunately, the enchiladas were
topped with avocado slices, which
helped diminish the taste of the
sauce. The steak was tender, lightly
peppered and very good. The
enchiladas also featured beans, rice,
salad and two fresh corn or flour tor
tillas.
The rest of the menu features a
long list of combinations, which is
also usual for Mexican restaurants.
They range in price from $4.50 to $5,
which is more than reasonable for
what they include. The other house
specials include carne asada,
enchilada verdes, flautas and beef or
pork a la Mexicana dishes. They
range between $5.50 and $7 each.
Unfortunately, La Fortuna does
not have a full liquor license and does
not sell any hard liquor. It does have
a full-line of Mexican and domestic
beer, as well as wine margaritas.
The service is very slow and nearly
unattentive. La For tuna's lone
waitress on a Friday night did two
things for us: showed us to a table and
took our order. The restaurant could
use some more help.
