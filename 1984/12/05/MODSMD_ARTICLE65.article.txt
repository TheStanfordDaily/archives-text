Looking for Disneyland in Northern Califor
nia? Aspiring to yuppie status or simply eager to
mingle with those who have been accepted into
the ranks of the successful in Silicon Valley?
If so, you should visit the Lion and Compass
Bar and Grill in Sunnyvale. If not, you might
want to move on, unless you have an expense ac
count or vast sums of money you need to spend.
That's right. The Lion and Compass is a high
budget bar and restaurant with, i admit, well
prepared and aesthetically pleasing cuisine. But
the steep prices might make the restaurant unaf
fordable for many Stanford students.
There are two distinct parts to the Lion and
Compass. To the left of the entrance is the dining
area, with bright, white twinkling lights, some tall
floor plants, and comfortable wicker chairs.
Everything seems very white and clean, and the
bright festive lights reminded my friend of Dis
neyland.
To the right of the entrance is the bar. Booths
that don't look any cozier than those at Denny's
or Lyon's fill this room. There is also a bar, of
course, which extends across one wall, and a
large chalkboard listing the evenings' special
drinks.
The night of our visit, most people crowded
around the bar, which was definitely more ap
pealing than the booths. Of course, if you prefer
to be secluded, the booths offer a degree of
privacy and quiet the bar doesn't.
Outside, your car is parked by a valet. Though
the expensive cars parked around the entrance
might raise some eyebrows, the people inside
were dressed casually.
The food itself, however, is anything but
casual. And that was the problem. It seemed the
prices were comparable to a restaurant in San
Francisco with a view of the Bay or a charming
cafe on the streets of Carmel. But the casual at
mosphere was not in keeping with the menu.
Even the waitress's uniform, a large chef s apron,
seemed inappropriate.
There were two menus, the standard one and
another with the evening's specials. The waitress
focused on the second one, which was sufficient
in and of itself. She explained each of the ap
petizers, highly recommending the wild mush
room saute ($6.50). She said the artichoke farci
($5.95) was very popular that evening. Many
couples had ordered a second after trying one or
der of it. We decided to try it.
While waiting, we ate some complimentary
bread and perused the list of premium wines,
which are served by the glass. I couldn't help but
gasp when I saw the first choice, a 1982 chardon
nay for $6 (for one glass, mind you!). Skipping

quickly to the bottom of the eight offerings, I saw
the cheapest was a zinfandel for $2.75. I decided
to order water.
We were served the artichoke farci, which con
sists of pieces of fresh artichoke with crab meat in
a tarragon mayonnaise. It was really quite deli
cious. The meat was tender and complemented
the artichoke perfectly.
The two specials that evening were the St.
Pierre moules et crevettes a la vapeur de
Chinoise ($17.50) and magret de canard au porto
et shiitake ($17.75). The first was a combination
of fresh French John Dory white fish, Santa Bar
bara mussels and Alaskan spot prawns steamed
with Chinese shrimp stock and aromatic julienne
vegetables. The other was fresh duck breast.
My guest ordered the St. Pierre and I ordered
the Ahi Tuna ($16.75), which the waitress highly
recommended. Each entree was served with
white rice and some colorful vegetables. We both
found the meals exceptionally well prepared,

from the rice and vegetables to the main entree.
However, my friend felt he was served an inor
dinately small portion of everything and was still
hungry after clearing his plate.
So he decided to order dessert, choosing the
custard ($3.75). This was one of the more rea
sonably priced desserts. The fresh raspberry
tartlette was $5 and most items were $4.
Lion and Compass also offers salads (including
Greek spinach with feta cheese, $6.50), sand
wiches (including shrimp on baguette with herb
mayonnaise, $8.75), and various meat entrees
(including dry aged New York steak, $11.95, and
marinated chicken breast, $8.25).
Lion and Compass is open for lunch from 11
a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and dinner from 5:15 to 10
p.m. Monday through Friday. Only dinner is
served on Saturday. The establishment is closed
on Sunday.

found the meals exceptionally well prepared,

from the rice and vegetables to the main entree.
However, my friend felt he was served an inor
dinately small portion of everything and was still
hungry after clearing his plate.
So he decided to order dessert, choosing the
custard ($3.75). This was one of the more rea
sonably priced desserts. The fresh raspberry
tartlette was $5 and most items were $4.
Lion and Compass also offers salads (including
Greek spinach with feta cheese, $6.50), sand
wiches (including shrimp on baguette with herb
mayonnaise, $8.75), and various meat entrees
(including dry aged New York steak, $11.95, and
marinated chicken breast, $8.25).
Lion and Compass is open for lunch from 11
a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and dinner from 5:15 to 10
p.m. Monday through Friday. Only dinner is
served on Saturday. The establishment is closed
on Sunday.

Lion and Compass
1023 North Fair Oaks Ave.
Sunnyvale

Looking for Disneyland in Northern Califor
nia? Aspiring to yuppie status or simply eager to
mingle with those who have been accepted into
the ranks of the successful in Silicon Valley?
If so, you should visit the Lion and Compass
Bar and Grill in Sunnyvale. If not, you might
want to move on, unless you have an expense ac
count or vast sums of money you need to spend.
That's right. The Lion and Compass is a high
budget bar and restaurant with, i admit, well
prepared and aesthetically pleasing cuisine. But
the steep prices might make the restaurant unaf
fordable for many Stanford students.
There are two distinct parts to the Lion and
Compass. To the left of the entrance is the dining
area, with bright, white twinkling lights, some tall
floor plants, and comfortable wicker chairs.
Everything seems very white and clean, and the
bright festive lights reminded my friend of Dis
neyland.
To the right of the entrance is the bar. Booths
that don't look any cozier than those at Denny's
or Lyon's fill this room. There is also a bar, of
course, which extends across one wall, and a
large chalkboard listing the evenings' special
drinks.
The night of our visit, most people crowded
around the bar, which was definitely more ap
pealing than the booths. Of course, if you prefer
to be secluded, the booths offer a degree of
privacy and quiet the bar doesn't.
Outside, your car is parked by a valet. Though
the expensive cars parked around the entrance
might raise some eyebrows, the people inside
were dressed casually.
The food itself, however, is anything but
casual. And that was the problem. It seemed the
prices were comparable to a restaurant in San
Francisco with a view of the Bay or a charming
cafe on the streets of Carmel. But the casual at
mosphere was not in keeping with the menu.
Even the waitress's uniform, a large chef s apron,
seemed inappropriate.
There were two menus, the standard one and
another with the evening's specials. The waitress
focused on the second one, which was sufficient
in and of itself. She explained each of the ap
petizers, highly recommending the wild mush
room saute ($6.50). She said the artichoke farci
($5.95) was very popular that evening. Many
couples had ordered a second after trying one or
der of it. We decided to try it.
While waiting, we ate some complimentary
bread and perused the list of premium wines,
which are served by the glass. I couldn't help but
gasp when I saw the first choice, a 1982 chardon
nay for $6 (for one glass, mind you!). Skipping

quickly to the bottom of the eight offerings, I saw
the cheapest was a zinfandel for $2.75. I decided
to order water.
We were served the artichoke farci, which con
sists of pieces of fresh artichoke with crab meat in
a tarragon mayonnaise. It was really quite deli
cious. The meat was tender and complemented
the artichoke perfectly.
The two specials that evening were the St.
Pierre moules et crevettes a la vapeur de
Chinoise ($17.50) and magret de canard au porto
et shiitake ($17.75). The first was a combination
of fresh French John Dory white fish, Santa Bar
bara mussels and Alaskan spot prawns steamed
with Chinese shrimp stock and aromatic julienne
vegetables. The other was fresh duck breast.
My guest ordered the St. Pierre and I ordered
the Ahi Tuna ($16.75), which the waitress highly
recommended. Each entree was served with
white rice and some colorful vegetables. We both
found the meals exceptionally well prepared,

from the rice and vegetables to the main entree.
