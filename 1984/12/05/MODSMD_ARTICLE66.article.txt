Now here's something you don't
see every day: a combination restau
rant/cabaret that offers unusual en
tertainment as well as excellent food.
As the name implies, Mame's
Palazzo is decorated in a festive
cabaret style. Our hostess greeted us
in the bar and escorted us to the
dining room, where we met our
charming waiter. Bill. He presented
us with a diverse menu, which claims
to be inspired by Mame's "travels
around the world and by the year
'round bounty of our own Golden
State." For that reason, the restau
rant terms its cuisine "California
eclectic."

Appetizers range from lemon
chicken ($3.50) to baked brie ($4.50)
to Mame's own homemade pasta;
entrees include other pasta dishes as
well as calamari steak ($8.95), veal
piccata ($11.95) and a variety of
chicken and seafood dishes.
We started with fresh, hot sour
dough bread, followed by an ap
petizer of pasta pegeen — "pasta with
prawns and bell peppers in Mame's
rich blush cream sauce." The spicy
pepper and prawn cheese sauce was
excellent and complemented the
smooth flavor of the pasta. After a
light salad with a honey vinaigrette
dressing. Bill returned with our
entrees.
We had "Beau's canard" — a half
duck with a sweet cranberry brandy
sauce ($13.50) and "Claude's lamb
chops" ($14.75), which were served
with a tangy homemade mint sauce.

The duck, which was slightly
pressed in the oven and finished on
the grill, was crispy outside and suc
culent inside. Although the lamb
could have been more tender, it was
flavorful and juicy.
The house wine, a 1979 Martini
California Cabernet, complemented
dinner with its fruity, well-balanced
flavor. We finished with a house
blend coffee of Colombian, espresso
and cinnamon.
After dinner, our hostess seated us
in the cabaret. Murals depicting
scenes from the musical "Mame"
decorate the room; a fountain and a
long swimming pool add a final touch.
The stage is small, providing an inti
mate setting in which the performer
can closely relate to the audience.
And Leola Jiles, the performer of
the evening, related to us closely

indeed. Her repertoire included
rhythm-and-blues numbers, much in
the style of Billie Holiday. She cap
tivated the audience with a delicate
and moving pianissimo range and of
ten made glissandos up to a powerful
climax.
The nightclub section of Mame's
captures the cabaret feeling with
more style than the dining room;
however, the service remains consis
tent throughout. Our hostess greeted
us with "hello, darling," and
autographed our menu with a kiss.
We must agree with her that
"Mame's is a place for holding
hands."
Upcoming performers at Mame's
include Mamie Van Doren, Lynda
Bergen and Morgana King.
