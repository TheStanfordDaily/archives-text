# CAMPUS COMPENDIUM
## Barely getting physical

In this summer's Olympic Games, long
distance runner Zola Budd received much at
tention because she competed in the Games
barefoot. However, students at Princeton

University bare a lot more than their feet
when they compete in Princeton's annual
"Nude Olympics."
All universities have their traditions which
make them unique. Among Stanford originals
are the customs of shaking keys at football
games to indicate displeasure, holding an an

nual Big Game rally in San Francisco and, of
course, kissing in the Quad on the first full
moonlit evening of fall quarter, which sup
posedly turns a Stanford freshman girl into a
"woman."
But Nude Olympics would never work at
Stanford in the true Princetonian tradition,
for Stanford lacks one very important element
— snow.
According to the Daily Princetonian, the
members of Princeton's Nude Olympic Squad
" ... take off all their clothes on the night of
the first snowfall with no protection from
pneumonia, hypothermia or even the com
mon cold."
What's more, anyone can compete, as the
rules are very arbitrary. " 'The Nude Olym
pics' really can't be considered an 'Olympics'
at all because the event is missing the vital
point tallies, precise rules, medal counts and a
clear-cut winner." In spite of these apparent
obstacles, though, the tradition has endured
at Princeton for some time.
Though Palo Alto lacks the snow of New
Jersey, it's still tempting to consider the possi
bility of starting such an Olympic tradition
here. After all, Stanford Stadium has been
newly renovated, and any chemist would con
firm that the only real difference between
snow and rain is purely kinetic. . . .
