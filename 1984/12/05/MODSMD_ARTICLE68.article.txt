# 'Old fashioned' is in

### 
When you finally make up your mind to get
rid of those four-year-old, patched Levi's,
wait! Don't throw them away, sell them! They
might be just what some University of Cali
fornia at Santa Barbara student is looking for.
A recent two-page advertisement in the
Daily Nexus encouraged students to discover
the value and great fashion possibilities of
used clothes. Like wine and cheese, the ad
suggested, clothes improve with age.
"With today's high-priced fashions, clothes
seem to be far from a student's reach," the ad

explained. "Fortunately, a new and inexpen
sive trend has come alive. . . . The latest in
fashion just may be hidden away in an old
trunk up in the attic. Wipe off the dust, be
cause used clothes are hot!!!"
It's not enough, however, simply to buy
some old piece of clothing and wear it around
town. The ad warns that there is a "technique
to both buying and wearing used clothes,"
a technique that the advertisers obviously feel
UCSB students can easily grasp.
Nonetheless, it appears that the "used
clothes" trend may be catching on at Stan
ford. Just the other day a Stanford undergrad
uate was overheard saying that it was about
time she wore her cashmere sweater again,
since she had worn it once last year.
Such an activity may have been unthinkable
before.
