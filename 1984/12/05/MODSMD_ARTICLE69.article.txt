# A 						rosy look at USC
## 
### 
Things are looking rosy for the University
of Southern California.
"... The idea began in San Francisco after
the excitement of the Stanford victory. ..."
Students at USC got "Rose Bowl Fever" a
little early as they planned a mini-rally to
prepare their team for the decisive Nov. 10
match up with the University of Washington.
The highlight of the spirit rally was a
several-block-long human tunnel formed by

USC students, band members and song girls
one afternoon after football practice. Accord
ing to the Daily Trojan, the football team was
to "run through the tunnel after practice."
The Rose Bowl deciding contest, in which
USC eventually upset the top-ranked Huskies
16-7, placed USC in the enviable position of
representing the Pac-10 in the Rose Bowl on
New Year's Day.
Whether or not the human tunnel played
any role at all in the victory is uncertain.
