Miss USA 1984 was recently crowned â€” on
the campus of the University of Southern Al
abama.
The annual competition, sponsored by
USA's Pi Kappa Phi fraternity and the Stu
dent Government Association, selects a can
didate from the university who will eventually
represent the University of Southern Ala
bama in the Miss Alabama pageant. The con
test is of the traditional format, including tal
ent, evening gown and swimsuit competitions.
This year's winner was Alabama junior
Pamela Deane. When asked how she would
celebrate her victory, the new queen replied,
"I'm going to spend the night with my parents
. . . and eat for days."
