# 'Tis the crunch season

"... Then there is finals week, which ranks
up there with getting wisdom teeth pulled,
giving the dog a bath and washing dishes for
three days straight. . . . "
Just about this time of year, university stu
dents around the nation are feeling the crunch
of final exams. A writer for the Daily Kent
Stater summed up the anxiety which comes
from realizing that two-and-a-half months
have somehow escaped us.
"If teachers gave grades for procrastina
tion, I know I would be getting an 'A+' .. ..

Finals week is not only a week full of tests, it
is also a week of many, many late-night piz
zas, as well as Ho-Hos, Ding-Dongs and
Little Debbie cakes." However, though we
may lose control with our eating habits, the
author assures that "when things come down

to the wire and serious buckling down is in or
der, it can be done."
So chin up, Stanford students. Just stock up
on Ho-Hos and it'll be over before you know
it.
