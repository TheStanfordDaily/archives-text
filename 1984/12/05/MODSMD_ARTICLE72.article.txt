## Yes, there is a world outside the West: New course challenges ethnocentrism 
### FRANK LESTER Staff writer 
Six social-science professors have joined
forces to start a new non-Western course they
hope will remedy a few of the effects of what
one professor terms "a very heavily eth
nocentric" curriculum at Stanford.
The two-quarter sequence, which will be of
fered beginning winter quarter, is called "The

World Outside the West." Formally, the se
quence is titled Anthropology/History 21 and
Anthropology/History/Political Science 22. It
will probe the cultural, social and political de
velopment of three non-Western civilizations
prior to and following contact with the West.
Lyman van Slyke, one of the three history
professors involved in the course, said that the
purpose of the course is to "show that these
societies are not stagnant, that they are not
static, that they are not timeless, and that
they're not out there waiting around for the
West to come and drag them into the process
of history and progress."
He said that the course came about because
a number of professors were concerned about
the Western bias of the Stanford curriculum.
"It isn't just Stanford — Stanford does better
than many places in this regard — but it
doesn't do nearly well enough, in our view.
When the Stanford campus thinks about areas
outside of the West, it's usually not often, not
much, and ethnocentrically."

Van Slyke said that the course will try to get
students to rethink their fundamental assump
tions about non-Western cultures. "The term
'non-West' itself is a particularly ethnocentric
notion," he said. "It assumes that everything
out there is alike in its non-Westernness. It's a
good idea for students to know a little bit
about that."
As to whether he thinks students will be at

tracted to the course, van Slyke said he hopes
so, but added that at this point, "we're just
firing in the dark." The professors have
reserved 80 copies of each book to be used in
the course.
The course will be structured in such a way
that it will be difficult to take it for only one
quarter without losing a sense of continuity.
The course abstract submitted by the profes
sorial team to the National Endowment for
Humanities as a funding application says,
"Our inclination is to recommend strongly,
but not require, that both courses be taken,
seen as a set of interconnected themes."
The first quarter will examine the cultures
of Aztec Mexico, China and Nigeria before
they made contact with the West. According
to a description of the course, one of the
purposes of the first quarter will be to rid stu
dents of the notion they might have had of
non-Western civilizations as mysterious hin
terlands lost in the shadows of time before
they were given the touch of gold by the West.

The second quarter will highlight the com
ing of the West. The course abstract empha
sizes the importance of the second quarter in
re-evaluating students' concepts of the way
the West "discovered" other civilizations.
"The deep ambivalence of non-Western
peoples toward the West is one of the ines
capable facts of the contemporary world, and
it is essential for well-educated undergradu
ates to confront the historical reasons for it,"it
reads.
Van Slyke likened the learning process in
the course to learning about non-Euclidean
geometry. "From the standpoint of Euclidean
geometry, non-Euclidean geometry might not
make a lot of sense. But if you accept the
axioms of a different geometry, the system
works, it makes sense, and can be derived.
What we're going to try to do is some of that
derivation."
"The World Outside the West" will be a
five-unit course, and will possibly fulfill as
many as three distribution requirements, ac
cording to van Slyke. The structure of the

course will be simple enough: It will meet four
times a week (and possibly on Fridays at
times), and the class "will be divided into six
discussion sections. There will be a midterm, a
final, and three short papers.

Asked whether he realistically thought that
six white men could innovatively teach a
course in non-Western civilizations, van Slyke
said, "We think we're innovating, but we don't
have all the answers. Maybe we won't even
have them at the end of the first go-round.
We're all male Caucasians, that's right.
"Originally we thought we'd have a 1A
(teaching assistant) who was Nigerian, and an
other who was Chinese. The Nigerian pulled
out because he claims that his thesis requires
that he return to Nigeria, and that will be too
heavy of a burden. The Chinese woman will be
with us one quarter, but then is going to Japan
on a research fellowship. That happens,
though."
Van Slyke entertained no hopes that the
course will radically innovate the curriculum.
"I don't think it'll go very far. If we can just do
reasonably well what we hope to do, I guess
that's the most we can hope for. I don't know
that I would want to take anything out of the
curriculum, but I would like to stretch people
a little — stretch them to the point where they
ask questions.

"It's hard for us not to think ethnocentri
cally," he added. "It's not a venal sin, but it is
something we need to be aware of. As we step
outside to study other cultures, we get a per
spective on our own."

Van Slyke likened the learning process in
the course to learning about non-Euclidean
geometry. "From the standpoint of Euclidean
geometry, non-Euclidean geometry might not
make a lot of sense. But if you accept the
axioms of a different geometry, the system
works, it makes sense, and can be derived.
What we're going to try to do is some of that
derivation."
"The World Outside the West" will be a
five-unit course, and will possibly fulfill as
many as three distribution requirements, ac
cording to van Slyke. The structure of the

course will be simple enough: It will meet four
times a week (and possibly on Fridays at
times), and the class "will be divided into six
discussion sections. There will be a midterm, a
final, and three short papers.

Asked whether he realistically thought that
six white men could innovatively teach a
course in non-Western civilizations, van Slyke
said, "We think we're innovating, but we don't
have all the answers. Maybe we won't even
have them at the end of the first go-round.
We're all male Caucasians, that's right.
"Originally we thought we'd have a 1A
(teaching assistant) who was Nigerian, and an
other who was Chinese. The Nigerian pulled
out because he claims that his thesis requires
that he return to Nigeria, and that will be too
heavy of a burden. The Chinese woman will be
with us one quarter, but then is going to Japan
on a research fellowship. That happens,
though."
Van Slyke entertained no hopes that the
course will radically innovate the curriculum.
"I don't think it'll go very far. If we can just do
reasonably well what we hope to do, I guess
that's the most we can hope for. I don't know
that I would want to take anything out of the
curriculum, but I would like to stretch people
a little — stretch them to the point where they
ask questions.

"It's hard for us not to think ethnocentri
cally," he added. "It's not a venal sin, but it is
something we need to be aware of. As we step
outside to study other cultures, we get a per
spective on our own."
Six social-science professors have joined
forces to start a new non-Western course they
hope will remedy a few of the effects of what
one professor terms "a very heavily eth

The two-quarter sequence, which will be of

World Outside the West." Formally, the se
quence is titled Anthropology/History 21 and
Anthropology/History/Political Science 22. It
will probe the cultural, social and political de
velopment of three non-Western civilizations
prior to and following contact with the West.
Lyman van Slyke, one of the three history
professors involved in the course, said that the
purpose of the course is to "show that these
societies are not stagnant, that they are not
static, that they are not timeless, and that
they're not out there waiting around for the
West to come and drag them into the process
of history and progress."
He said that the course came about because
a number of professors were concerned about
the Western bias of the Stanford curriculum.
"It isn't just Stanford — Stanford does better
than many places in this regard — but it
doesn't do nearly well enough, in our view.
When the Stanford campus thinks about areas
outside of the West, it's usually not often, not
much, and ethnocentrically."

Van Slyke said that the course will try to get
students to rethink their fundamental assump
tions about non-Western cultures. "The term
'non-West' itself is a particularly ethnocentric
notion," he said. "It assumes that everything
out there is alike in its non-Westernness. It's a
good idea for students to know a little bit
about that."
As to whether he thinks students will be at

tracted to the course, van Slyke said he hopes
so, but added that at this point, "we're just
firing in the dark." The professors have
reserved 80 copies of each book to be used in
the course.
The course will be structured in such a way
that it will be difficult to take it for only one
quarter without losing a sense of continuity.
The course abstract submitted by the profes
sorial team to the National Endowment for
Humanities as a funding application says,
"Our inclination is to recommend strongly,
but not require, that both courses be taken,
seen as a set of interconnected themes."
The first quarter will examine the cultures
of Aztec Mexico, China and Nigeria before
they made contact with the West. According
to a description of the course, one of the
purposes of the first quarter will be to rid stu
dents of the notion they might have had of
non-Western civilizations as mysterious hin
terlands lost in the shadows of time before
they were given the touch of gold by the West.

The second quarter will highlight the com
ing of the West. The course abstract empha
sizes the importance of the second quarter in
re-evaluating students' concepts of the way
the West "discovered" other civilizations.

peoples toward the West is one of the ines
