The Maltese Falcon (1941)
Bijou, Palo Alto
326-6196
Humphrey Bogart at his best in one
of the key roles of his career: Sam
Spade, the hero of Dashiell Hammett's
lean, existential detective thriller, who
is misanthropic and borderline paranoid
and fiercely loyal to a private code of et
hics. Warners bought the rights to Ham
mett's novel in the very early '30s and
certainly got their money's worth out of :
it: Ricardo Cortez and Bebe Daniels
starred in the first, fairly literal version
in 1931, and then it was dressed up for
Bette Davis (with Warren William in
the Spade role) and retitled "Satan Met
a Lady" in 1936. The Bogan version is,
of course, definitive. John Huston wrote
the screenplay and directed it, his first
time out: it was a stunning (and much
talked-about) debut. With Mary Astor
(in her best peformance), LeC Patrick,
Gladys George, Ward Bond, Jerome
Cowan, and a trio of homosexual vil
lains (and Spade is virulently anti
homosexual): Sydney Greenstreei,
Peter Lorre and Elisha Cook, Jr.
Plays today with "Hammett."
If Happened One Night (1934)
Kresge Auditorium
To punish Clark Gable and Claudette
Colbert for their rebellious attitudes,
their home studios (M-G-M and
Paramount, respectively) loaned them
out to Columbia and stuck them, over
their objections, on this modest roman
tic comedy, which Robert Riskin had
adapted from a Samuel Hopkins Adams
story called "Night Bus." Not only did
the picture turn out to be a hit, but it
won all five top Oscars: Best Picture,
Best Actor, Best Actress, Best
Screenplay and Best Director (Frank
Capra). And certainly neither Gable
nor Colbert ever turned in a better per
formance. It's an enchanting movie,
beautifully directed and lit (by Joseph
Walker), and containing at least three
scenes no movie lover ever forgets: the
bus ride, the hitchhiking routine and
the "Walls of Jericho - ' sequence, which
ends with a close-up of Colbert in tears
that could melt stone. Walter Connolly
and Roscoe Karns contribute
memorable support.
Plays Friday evening at 9.

After the Thin Man (1936)
Festival, Palo Alto
329-1848
Frances Goodrich and Albert Hack
ett, the authors of the original Thin Man
script, worked on this sequel, too, but
it's? rather heavy-handed and it seems
awfully long. The colorful wist includes
Elissa Landi, displaying her 1920s
drawing-room melodrama style; Jessie
Ralph as a tyrannical matriarch; Joseph
Calleia as a beady-eyed gangster; Alan
Marshall as an alcoholic; Teddy Hart as
a lawyer; Sam Levene as a cop; and
Jimmy Stewart, giving arguably his
worst performance (at least until
Hitchcock's "Rope"). Nick and Nora
Charles, the highball-slinging sleuths,
are playW once again by William
Powell and Myrna Lay, and Asta's still
around, too, trying to keep a new dog in
town away from his canine wife. Di
rected by W.S.Van Dyke.
Plays through next Wednesday with
"Murder at the Gallop."
Return of the Secaucus Seven (1980)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
323-6411
John Sayles, relying mostly on funds
he earned by writing screenplays for
Roger Corman, made this picture
(which he wrote, produced, directed,
edited and plays a supporting role in)
for $60,000, and it looks like a home
movie — but it is wonderful.
The characters are a group of friends
who experienced the '60s together and
now, at 30 or thereabouts, are confront
ing crises. Sayles writes crinkly, soft-*
edged, funny lines that catch not only
the turn of phrase of individuals but
their speech rhythms as well as the ten
sions that direct those rhythms. The cast
is made up largely of Sayles' friends,
several of whom were his at
Williams College; as actors they are a
highly variable lot, but they communi
cate such a strong bond that we see
more in the ways in which they relate to
each other than we might see in a highly
trained ensemble. The best of them are
Mike Arnott, Jean Passanante, Gordon

Clapp, Maggie Renzi and Sayles him
self.
Plays tomorrow with "Baby It's
You."
Triumph of the Will (1936)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Leni Riefenstahl fuses Greek,
Roman, Norse and Anglo-Saxon myt
hology as well as biblical imagery in this
most famous and most disturbing of all
propaganda films, dedicated to the
deification of Adolf Hitler. The crowd
sequences are in a class with the ride of
the Klan in Griffith's "The Birth of a
Nation," and one shot of soldiers' arms
raised simultaneously in salute like so
many self-propelled playing cards is one
of the most startling images in the his
tory of cinema. This movie still holds so
much power that it offers an unequalled
magnetic-repellent viewing experience.
It's great, despicable art.
Plays Monday with "Nazi Cinema"
and an excerpt from "Olympiad." ,
Stripes (1981)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Bill Murray joins the army. Not a
good movie, God knows, but a fairly
consistently funny one, though the
screenwriters (Dan Goldberg, Len
Blum and Murray's co-star, Harold
Ramis) would have-been smarter to
leave Murray and the boys at home in
the United States — once they get to
Europe, the goes haywire and the
script runs out of comic invention. Bill
Murray is priceless, as usual, and John
Candy gives him able support. Also
starring the late Wlarren Oates; directed
by Ivan Reitman, who made Murray's
first picture, "Meatballs."
Plays Friday and Saturday with
"Ghostbusters."
Picnic at Hanging Rock (1978)
.New Varsity, Palo Alto
Peter Weir's jigsaw puzzle picture is
about a party of English schoolgirls in
1900 who fail to return from a nature

t
outing. The film is based on a true (and
unsolved) mystery, and Weir and the
screenwriter, Cliff Green, don't solve it
for us, either; they leave out all the re
vealing puzzle pieces. Some people
have found this film erotic and
provocative. It's certainly well shot,
anyway (by Russell Boyd). With Rachel
Roberts as the headmistress. Mrs. Ap
pleyard.
Plays Tuesday with "Heart of the
Stag."
