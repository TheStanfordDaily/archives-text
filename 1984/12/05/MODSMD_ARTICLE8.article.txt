Mondale campaign under fire
WASHINGTON — Walter Mondale's presidential campaign ac
knowledged yesterday a violation of federal campaign spending laws,
and the House Ethics Committee said it had found that his running
mate, Rep. Geraldine Ferraro (D-N.Y.), technically violated the Ethics
in Government Act at least 10 times since 1978 by failing to file infor
mation about her family's finances.
Mondale's campaign agreed to pay the U.S. Treasury $379,640 plus a
civil fine of $18,500 for accepting the excess donations through his
delegate-selection committees, which were units set up ostensibly to
finance the campaigns of Mondale supporters who were running for del
egate seats at the July Democratic National Convention.
Mondale had ordered the committees to disband in late April under
pressure from one opponent. Sen. Gary Hart (D-Colo.), and promised
to refund several hundred thousand dollars to union political-action
committees and individuals who had given the legal maximum to his
campaign. Instead, the campaign will pay the money to the U.S. Trea
sury.'
The House Committee on Standards of Officials Conduct voted 8 to 2
Monday to approve a 47-page staff report accusing Ferraro of technical
violations of House ethics rules that do not require disciplinary action.
Ferraro, who could not seek re-election when she became the Demo
cratic vice-presidential nominee, will not be subject to House jurisdic
tion when her term expires Jan. 3.
Hammer and Chernenko talk
MOSCOW — President Konstantin Chernenko was quoted yesterday
as saying it was time to "roll up one's sleeves" and prepare substantive
agreements to limit and reduce nuclear arms.
Armand Hammer, the American industrialist, said Chernenko made
the comment in a conversation in which the Soviet leader also said he
could foresee "positive effects" from a future summit meeting with Pres
ident Reagan. But there was no indication that Moscow would agree to
an early meeting on terms acceptable to the United States.
The 86-year-old industrialist — whose business relations with the So
viet Union began with V.I. Lenin, the Bolshevik leader, more than 60
years ago — met with Chernenko for an hour and a half at Chernenko's
invitation.
Hammer said Chernenko began the conversation by reading a state
ment in Russian. According to Hammer's translation, Chernenko said
Soviet policy toward the United States "has never been guided by short
term considerations," and added:
"Our constant policy line is to establish normal — better still, good —
relations with the United States. If these relations are sometimes mer
curial, if they are thrown backward occasionally, this does not happen
through any fault of ours."
NATO agrees to increase spending
BRUSSELS, Belgium — Defense ministers of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization agreed yesterday on a six-year, $7.85 billion pack
age of basic improvements in conventional defense to upgrade ground
equipment and boost ammunition stocks in response to U.S. criticism of
the alliance's infrastructure.
The accord calls for NATO to build or improve aircraft shelters, fuel
pipelines, communications and munitions dumps to enhance the ability
of the United States to reinforce Western Europe during a military crisis.
The 14 ministers, representing all NATO members except France and
Iceland, also affirmed that each country will strive to attain 30 days'
worth of ammunition stocks for all key weapons to strengthen capacity
to fight prolonged wars without resorting to early use of nuclear weap
ons. Some NATO countries are said to possess ammunition stocks that
would last only a week to 10 days if war broke out.
Meanwhile, in Washington, the State Department announced yester
day that the Soviet Union has increased its force of SS-20 medium-range
missiles' targeted on Europe and confirmed that Moscow is converting
SS-20 medium-rang? buses to deploy other missiles, probably
intercohlmentar-range 4 SS-255.
The increase of at least nine SS-20 missiles beyond the 378 already
deployed was of greater political than military significance for Europe.
The Netherlands said last month it would cancel deployment of U.S.
cruise missiles if there was no rise in the Soviet force, and the Soviet in
crease means Holland will now participate in the NATO plan to balance
the Soviet weapons.
More important, if SS-25 intercontinental missiles are being deployed
in modified SS-20 bases, the Soviets may be violating previous strategic
arms agreements shortly before arms-control talks take place in January
betweeen Secretary of State Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko in Geneva, Switzerland.
Reagan approves spending cuts
WASHINGTON — President Reagan has given tentative approval to
a package of $34 billion in domestic spending cuts for next year and in
tends to deliver a firm message to his Cabinet today that he does not
want to overturn the cuts on appeal, administration officials said yester
day
The $34 billion falls short of the White House goal of $42 billion in
savings for next year. The $8 billion difference may be made up with a
slowdown in defense spending, officials said. It was also learned that
Reagan's lengthy review of the budget had not yet identified enough
savings to reach the goal of slashing the deficit in half by 1988, from
more than $200 billion.
Sources said the administration's "core group" of fiscal experts was
less than 80 percent toward achieving that goal for 1988.
'Bronze Age' ship discovered
WASHINGTON — In the most extensive discovery of its kind, un
dersea explorers have found "an enormous cargo" of Bronze Age trade
goods in the oldest ship ever excavated — a 65-foot vessel that sank
nearly 3,400 years ago off southern Turkey, the National Geographic
Society announced yesterday.
The ship's remains, first spotted by a Turkish sponge diver, are yield
ing a treasure trove of artifacts that scientists say will help them under
stand trading practices and marine history in the Mediterranean region
during the time of the Trojan War and the reign of King Tutankhamen
of Egypt.
So far, the items discovered include a gold goblet, beads, pottery and
tall, narrow jars known as amphoras, as well as copper, cobalt-blue glass
and tin ingots, said George Bass, anthropology professor at Texas A&M
University and director of the Institute of Nautical Archeology. Bass is
directing the excavation off Cape Ulu Burun near the Turkish town of
Kas.
Nobel winner raps Reagan
WASHINGTON — Bishop Desmond Tutu, winner of the 1984 Nobel
Peace Prize, yesterday strongly condemned the Reagan administration's
policy of "constructive engagement" toward his homeland of South
Africa, saying that it has been detrimental to blacks in that country and
is comparable to collaboration with the Nazis.
"Four years ago, I said this policy was unmitigated disaster for us
blacks," Tutu told the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa.
"Four years later, I have no reason to alter my original assessment. . .."
Indeed, constructive engagement, or quiet diplomacy, "has worsened
our situation under apartheid," which is the white-ruled Pretoria gov
ernment's policy of racial segregation and discrimination, Tutu said.
On Monday, Chester Crocker, assistant secretary of state for African
affairs, reasserted the Reagan administration's support for "constructive
engagement" while denouncing apartheid as "repugnant."
Wall Street posts modest gain
NEW YORK — The stock market held on yesterday to post some
modest price gains, breaking a four-session string of declines.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which fell 6.52 on Monday,
rose 2.65 to 1,185.07.
Today's weather
Cloudy today with a chance of light rain or showers, decreasing later

The 86-year-old industrialist — whose business relations with the So
viet Union began with V.I. Lenin, the Bolshevik leader, more than 60
years ago — met with Chernenko for an hour and a half at Chernenko's
invitation.
Hammer said Chernenko began the conversation by reading a state
ment in Russian. According to Hammer's translation, Chernenko said
Soviet policy toward the United States "has never been guided by short
term considerations," and added:
"Our constant policy line is to establish normal — better still, good —
relations with the United States. If these relations are sometimes mer
curial, if they are thrown backward occasionally, this does not happen
through any fault of ours."
NATO agrees to increase spending
BRUSSELS, Belgium — Defense ministers of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization agreed yesterday on a six-year, $7.85 billion pack
age of basic improvements in conventional defense to upgrade ground
equipment and boost ammunition stocks in response to U.S. criticism of
the alliance's infrastructure.
The accord calls for NATO to build or improve aircraft shelters, fuel
pipelines, communications and munitions dumps to enhance the ability
of the United States to reinforce Western Europe during a military crisis.
The 14 ministers, representing all NATO members except France and
Iceland, also affirmed that each country will strive to attain 30 days'
worth of ammunition stocks for all key weapons to strengthen capacity
to fight prolonged wars without resorting to early use of nuclear weap
ons. Some NATO countries are said to possess ammunition stocks that
would last only a week to 10 days if war broke out.
Meanwhile, in Washington, the State Department announced yester
day that the Soviet Union has increased its force of SS-20 medium-range
missiles' targeted on Europe and confirmed that Moscow is converting
SS-20 medium-rang? buses to deploy other missiles, probably
intercohlmentar-range 4 SS-255.
The increase of at least nine SS-20 missiles beyond the 378 already
deployed was of greater political than military significance for Europe.
The Netherlands said last month it would cancel deployment of U.S.
cruise missiles if there was no rise in the Soviet force, and the Soviet in
crease means Holland will now participate in the NATO plan to balance
the Soviet weapons.
More important, if SS-25 intercontinental missiles are being deployed
in modified SS-20 bases, the Soviets may be violating previous strategic
arms agreements shortly before arms-control talks take place in January
betweeen Secretary of State Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko in Geneva, Switzerland.
Reagan approves spending cuts
WASHINGTON — President Reagan has given tentative approval to
a package of $34 billion in domestic spending cuts for next year and in
tends to deliver a firm message to his Cabinet today that he does not
want to overturn the cuts on appeal, administration officials said yester
day
The $34 billion falls short of the White House goal of $42 billion in
savings for next year. The $8 billion difference may be made up with a
slowdown in defense spending, officials said. It was also learned that
Reagan's lengthy review of the budget had not yet identified enough
savings to reach the goal of slashing the deficit in half by 1988, from
more than $200 billion.
Sources said the administration's "core group" of fiscal experts was
less than 80 percent toward achieving that goal for 1988.
'Bronze Age' ship discovered
WASHINGTON — In the most extensive discovery of its kind, un
dersea explorers have found "an enormous cargo" of Bronze Age trade
goods in the oldest ship ever excavated — a 65-foot vessel that sank
nearly 3,400 years ago off southern Turkey, the National Geographic
Society announced yesterday.
The ship's remains, first spotted by a Turkish sponge diver, are yield
ing a treasure trove of artifacts that scientists say will help them under
stand trading practices and marine history in the Mediterranean region
during the time of the Trojan War and the reign of King Tutankhamen
of Egypt.
So far, the items discovered include a gold goblet, beads, pottery and
tall, narrow jars known as amphoras, as well as copper, cobalt-blue glass
and tin ingots, said George Bass, anthropology professor at Texas A&M
University and director of the Institute of Nautical Archeology. Bass is
directing the excavation off Cape Ulu Burun near the Turkish town of
Kas.
Nobel winner raps Reagan
WASHINGTON — Bishop Desmond Tutu, winner of the 1984 Nobel
Peace Prize, yesterday strongly condemned the Reagan administration's
policy of "constructive engagement" toward his homeland of South
Africa, saying that it has been detrimental to blacks in that country and
is comparable to collaboration with the Nazis.
"Four years ago, I said this policy was unmitigated disaster for us
blacks," Tutu told the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa.
"Four years later, I have no reason to alter my original assessment. . .."
Indeed, constructive engagement, or quiet diplomacy, "has worsened
our situation under apartheid," which is the white-ruled Pretoria gov
ernment's policy of racial segregation and discrimination, Tutu said.
On Monday, Chester Crocker, assistant secretary of state for African
affairs, reasserted the Reagan administration's support for "constructive
engagement" while denouncing apartheid as "repugnant."

Mondale campaign under fire
WASHINGTON — Walter Mondale's presidential campaign ac
knowledged yesterday a violation of federal campaign spending laws,
and the House Ethics Committee said it had found that his running
mate, Rep. Geraldine Ferraro (D-N.Y.), technically violated the Ethics
in Government Act at least 10 times since 1978 by failing to file infor
mation about her family's finances.
Mondale's campaign agreed to pay the U.S. Treasury $379,640 plus a
civil fine of $18,500 for accepting the excess donations through his
delegate-selection committees, which were units set up ostensibly to
finance the campaigns of Mondale supporters who were running for del
egate seats at the July Democratic National Convention.
Mondale had ordered the committees to disband in late April under
pressure from one opponent. Sen. Gary Hart (D-Colo.), and promised
to refund several hundred thousand dollars to union political-action
committees and individuals who had given the legal maximum to his
campaign. Instead, the campaign will pay the money to the U.S. Trea
sury.'
The House Committee on Standards of Officials Conduct voted 8 to 2
Monday to approve a 47-page staff report accusing Ferraro of technical
violations of House ethics rules that do not require disciplinary action.
Ferraro, who could not seek re-election when she became the Demo
cratic vice-presidential nominee, will not be subject to House jurisdic
tion when her term expires Jan. 3.
Hammer and Chernenko talk
MOSCOW — President Konstantin Chernenko was quoted yesterday
as saying it was time to "roll up one's sleeves" and prepare substantive
agreements to limit and reduce nuclear arms.

the comment in a conversation in which the Soviet leader also said he
could foresee "positive effects" from a future summit meeting with Pres
ident Reagan. But there was no indication that Moscow would agree to
an early meeting on terms acceptable to the United States.
