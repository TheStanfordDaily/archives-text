# 551 dead in gas disaster

### 
BHOPAL, India â€” Hindu funeral
fires blazed in the improverished
fringes of this stunned central Indian
state capital yesterday after the death
toll in one of the worst industrial
poisonings in history officially
reached 551, including at least 200
small children.
Hundreds of people blinded by
poisonous fumes that leaked from a
Union Carbide plant here early Mon
day morning were still groping
through the streets yesterday in
search of treatment. In the confusion,
others wandered along carrying
bodies wrapped in shrouds.
N.R. Bhandari, superintendent of
Hamidia Hospital here, said last night
that the actual number of deaths may
be more than 800, and the news
agency United News of India esti

mated that there were 1,200 dead.
The true number will probably never
be known, because many of the poor
and uneducated families affected
buried or cremated their dead before
they could be counted by officials.
Bhandari said the hospital treated
more than 18,000 victims for in
flamed eyes, vomiting and seared
lungs after the leak of deadly methyl
isocyanate gas at the plant, which is
operated by a subsidiary of the
American company. Police at the
gates of the hospital wielded bamboo
staves yesterday to keep emotional
crowds outside from blocking the en
trance.
Methyl isocyanate gas, used in
making the pesticide "Sevin," poured
from a stainless steel underground
storage tank and flowed into neigh

boring slum areas before dawn, turn
ing the neighborhood's flimsy shacks
into gas chambers.
The gas concentrations were so let
hal that large water buffalo, goats and
other animals simply dropped where
they stood. Nearby radish fields were
left chemically scorched.
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi
visited the city yesterday and went to
the Union Carbide plant, located on
the edge of the city near a heavily
populated area.
Gandhi said he had ordered a sur
vey of other chemical or pesticide
plants in urban areas to assess their
danger to surrounding communities.
"It is something we have been think
ing about even before this tragedy oc
curred," Gandhi said. "There has
been planning in an uncontrolled

manner. Planning has not been en
forced well."
Experts called in by the govern
ment were quick to criticize the
Union Carbide layout in Bhopal.
"Any plant that produces pesticides
has to use dangerous gases," said
Harish Sharma, an electrical engineer
from Bombay who arrived here yes
terday to investigate the safety system
at the Union Carbide facility.
"A plant like this should never be
close to town," he said.
A major reason for the high death
toll in the accident appears to have
been that no warning was given to
surrounding communities when the
leak was discovered by a plant worker
some time around 1 a.m. Monday.
