# Meet Paul Walters, Cowell's new director
## 
### TIM GRIEVE 
Paul Walters knows what he
wants.
"When students think of
health," he says,"I want them
to think of Cowell."
As Cowell's new director, Wal
ters has his work cut out for him.
He says he knows that Cowell,
like most student health centers,
has a less-than-perfect reputa
tion. But he says Cowell doesn't
deserve the rap.
"There are always horror
stories," he says, "about the ap
pendicitis that was diagnosed as
stomach flu." But, Walters says,
the stories are usually just that:
stories. "If there are real prob
lems, we need to talk about
them."
One of Walter's major goals
for Cowell is to make the health
center less "scary" and more of a
normal part of students' lives —
and then to make it not a normal
part of students' lives. But it's
not as confusing as it sounds.
Walters wants students to
feel comfortable about coming
to Cowell for help, but at that
same time he wants to teach stu
dents enough about themselves
so they won't always need Cowell
to solve their problems.
And in an age of economic un
certainty, the mental health
problems students face are be
coming as important as the
physical ones.
He says he believes the mental
health side of Cowell — Counsel

ing and Psychological Services —
is well received and well used by
Stanford students.
But, he says, the physical
health side of Cowell needs to
play the type of role the mental
side plays in the Stanford com
munity by reaching out to stu
dents with information and help.
The Student Body is one such
reaching-out project; the "You
Choose" nutrition project at
Tresidder is another.
For the future, Walters is ex
amining the issue of women's
health at Cowell. Women's
health care is more important
now than ever before, Walters
says, because women today
demand more of themselves in
the form of careers, families,
and physical fitness than did
their counterparts in earlier
generations.
Walters is also looking into the
idea of adding to Cowell phar
macy and dental services,
services which many students
have requested. While tooth
decay is not a major problem for
U.S.-born students here, it is a
concern for foreign students at
Stanford. A pharmacy at Cowell
could become a reality if studies
show that the relatively small
student population could make
such a venture self-supporting.
Another one of Walters' con
cerns is that students have more
input on how Cowell operates.
One key to this is Cowell's active
student advisory group.

But for now, Walters is busy
getting used to the California
way of life. Born in North
Carolina, he attended medical
school at Duke University and
did his residency and internship
at Johns Hopkins. Walters then
travelled to Harvard, where he
was the chief of mental health
services for 10 years.

During his stay at Harvard,
Walters became more and more
interested in student health and
taught a class on drug use during
the late sixties in which, he ad
mits, "The students knew a lot
more than I did.
Walters came to Stanford in
September with his wife Patricia
and son Bucky, leaving his four

other children — now grown —
scattered across the country.
After settling in. Walters has
some interesting observations
about Stanford and California.
He says students are, in a way,
more intense here than they are
at Harvard, even though they
like to hide their intensity be
