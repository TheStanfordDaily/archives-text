# Appointment plan makes Cowell easier for you
## 
### JOHN DORMAN, M.D. Associate Director of Medicine 
In recent years it has often
seemed that the front lobby at
Cowell was one of the "in
places" to be on campus. Espe
cially on Mondays and Fridays,
students sometimes sat there
for an hour of longer, waiting to
be seen. A frustrating experi
ence!

It was frustrating for doctors,
too, when, in the midst of this
crush, students came in with
problems of weeks' or months
duration — clearly not urgent —
and made the wait longer for
students who really needed to be
seen right away. How many of
you have said on a Monday mor
ning, '"This cough has been going
on for a month. Today I am going
to do something about it."

So you went to Cowell and
waited forever for a doctor. But
on other days the doctors as
signed to "walk ins" like you
were just sitting around, with no
patients to see.
In an attempt to remove the
peaks and valleys from the sys
tem, reduce waiting time and
eliminate the frustration for
students and doctors alike,
Cowell has instituted a new all
appointment system starting
this quarter. This does not mean
that if you have a truly urgent
problem you won't be seen right
away; a doctor and a nurse
practitioner cover "urgent care"
every weekday. But if you just
"walk in" to Cowell now, you will
be offered a choice: either make
an appointment or see the triage
person. (Triage: the sorting out
and classification of casualties
to determine priority of need
and proper place of treatment.)
The triage person, usually a
nurse, will screen your problem
and decide how soon you need to

be seen. A number of appoint
ments are held open each day for
problems that, while not urgent,
deserve immediate attention.
Only the triage person can fill
these appointments.
A word about colds, coughs,
and minor injuries: Many of
these problems have been han
dled by our treatment room in
the past, and wil continue to be,
although the problems will be
"triaged" first. If the problem is
long-standing, the triage person
may ask you to make an appoint
ment instead.
A new service for students
still in the pilot stage is the
"Cold Self-Care" area. Here stu
dents can take their own tem
peratures, look at their throats,
and take a questionnaire to de
termine whether they really need
to see a health professional at
all; those with a significant
fever, sinus pain, ear ache, pro
ductive cough, wheezing or pus in
their throats need to see some
one. Most others can take care

of themselves without wasting
their time waiting to see a prac
titioner.
You can also save time by call
ing 497-4841 for an ap
pointment, rather than com
ing in to Cowell to make one. If
you feel you truly need to be
seen today, say so, and you will
be connected to the triage nurse.
The new system is designed to
operate on time. Usually you will
be seen very close to your actual
appointment time, so waiting
will be minimal. If fact, if you
are more than a few minutes
late, you may be asked to re
schedule rather than make the
practitioner late for those after
you.
Good luck and be "patient"
with us as we get used to working
with the new system. We feel
confident that this is the most
efficient way to see patients in
the long run, and we are working
to remove the kinks in the sys
tem — including our inadequate
phone service!
