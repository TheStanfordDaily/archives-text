What is premenstrual syndrome?
Premenstrual syndrome, or PMS, is a
group of symptoms causing physical dis
comfort, emotional distress, or both.
These symptoms are experienced by
some women anywhere from five to 14
days prior to the onset of menstruation.
PMS is unique to each person in type and
degree of symptomatology.
How do I know if I have PMS? Unfor
tunately, there is no internationally ac
cepted scheme for defining PMS. The

symptoms one experiences are nervous
tension, anxiety, hostility, fatigue, food
cravings, depression, lethargy, mood
swings, decreased self-esteem, breast
tenderness, abdominal bloating or edema
(swelling) of the face, hands or feet, to
name a few of the 150 symptoms of
PMS. In identifying the syndrome it is
important that a woman be free of all
symptoms at some time during her cycle.
Who gets PMS? 70 to 90 percent of all
women have some degree of
premenstrual symptoms. Of these, 20
percent of the women have some degree

of incapacitation. Those at risk of
Premenstral Tension are women who
have had multiple childbirths (especially
complicated with toxemia), have had ad
verse reaction to oral contraceptives,
are in their mid-30s or have a family his
tory of Premenstrual Tension. Women
with poor eating habits — including high
intakes of refined sugar, salt, coffee,
tea, chocolate, soda drinks and dairy
products — who seldom exercise are also
most susceptible to Premenstrual Ten
sion.
Are menstrual cramps considered part
of PMS? No, PMS doesn't include

menstrual cramps. Many women are sub
ject to some mild discomfort during
their periods. If the cramping interferes
with normal activities or requires bed
rest, the condition is called dysmenor
rhea and is treated differently than
PMS.
What causes PMS? The causes of PMS
have been attributed to an elevated
estrogen/proestrogen ratio or to in
creased progesterone and androgens,
depending on the study one reads. Other
theories for the cause of PMS include
decreased levels of Vitamin 86,
magnesium and Vitamin A.
Theories which include hormone
allergies and psychosomatic
problems as causes for PMS have
been discarded.
What is the treatment for PMS?
At this time there are as many as
300 different treatments sug
gested for PMS sufferers. The
most common treatment in
cludes diets, vitamin supple
ment. exercise programs and
counseling if needed to deal with
living problems. Treatment of
PMS should be under the super
vision of an experienced profes
sional.
