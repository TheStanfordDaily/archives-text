True or false? Measles is a
childhood disease of little im
portance to college students.
False. Bccause of the usual immunizations re
quired by elementary schools in the United
States today, most children horn since 1968 are
immune to measles. Those born before 1957 are
assumed to have had the disease, since the
vaccine was not available then. Consequently,
those born between 1957 and 1967 — people
who are now 17-27 years old, the current univer
sity population — are those most susceptible to
the disease. An epidemic last spring at Indiana
University afflicted over 300 students. In addi
tion, measles is a more serious illness in an older
population. The last U.S. death from measles
was that of a college student. For these reasons,
Stanford this year instituted a requirement for
proof of immunity against measles — either a
positive antibody titre, a history of receiving
the live virus vaccine, or a doctor-documented
case of the illness.

Okay, so I'll get a measles shot.
But why require a rubella shot?
It's a mild illness, only of impor
tance in pregnant women.
Wrong. Rubella, or German measles, is indeed
a mild illness, only dangerous in its effects on
the fetus. But these effects can be devastat
ing, causing blindness and mental retardation.
The issue is the resevoir of disease — where do
the pregnant women become infected? Aut
horities feel that women get infected mostly
from other women and men in their peer group,
since today most children are immunized before
they begin school. Here too we are following
the recommendations of the Centers for
Disease Control in requiring proof of immunity
against rubella. Since the disease is very diffi
cult to diagnose for certain — even for doctors
— only a positive antibody titre or a history of
the vaccine is acceptable as proof.
So I'll get the vaccines for
measles and rubella, since I
