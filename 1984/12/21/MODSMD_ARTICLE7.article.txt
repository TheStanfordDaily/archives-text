Stress is, unfortunately, a
big part of many students'
lives. Students may feel stress
about grades, friendships,
sexual relationships and
careers. This quiz should tell
you more about stress and the
way we can handle it.
In what area of their lives do
students most commonly report
stressful or traumatic events?
A. Academics.
B. Finances.
C. Health.
D. Relationships.
The answer is D: relation
ships.
As a group, Stanford stu
dents experience stressful or
traumatic relationship prob
lems more frequently than
other types of problems. This
includes breakups, problems

with relationships, or rejec
tions. The next area of con
cern is personal problems,
including anxiety, depression,
loneliness and identity con
cerns. Following this is academ
ic matters such as feeling of
inadequacy and excessive
demands or problems.
Graduate students report aca
demic concerns as stressful
more often than undergradu
ates do.
It is difficult to avoid many
traumatic events in life.
Depending where you are in
your development, you may
perceive any given event as
stressful, traumatic, or just
difficult to handle. A breakup
in a relationship as an under
graduate may help you deal
with later, more traumatic
losses.
While stress and trauma are
not aspects of life with which
you would choose to rehearse,
they may be painful opportu
nities to develop skills for the
future. They often become

teachers of an invaluable
resilience for future un
avoidable events.
When students experience
stressful or traumatic events, to
whom do they talk?
A. Family member.
B. Friend.
C. Priest/rabbi/minister.
D. No one.
The answer is B: a friend.
Most Stanford students talk
to friends when they experi
ence a stressful or traumatic
event. Only one percent of
students keep traumatic expe
rience entirely to themselves.
One out of five talk to family
members, and almost as many
talk to intimate partners or
spouses.
It is encouraging to find
that Stanford students are
willing to use their social assets
to deal with difficult life situ
ations. Research is increasingly
demonstrating the value of

these resources during crises
and major traumatic times in
our lives. People who have
someone who cares for them
are more likely to adequately
resolve tension than those who
do not. Simply knowing that
these resources are available
increases one's ability to cope.
Take time to develop and
sustain your social assets â€”
friends, family ties, etc. It's
the best way to make sure they
are there when you need them.
What proportion of Stanford
students report feeling lonely at
some time during a month?
A. 16 percent.
B. 25 percent.
C. 60 percent.
D. 84 percent.
The answer is D, 84 percent
of all Stanford students
report feeling lonely at some
time during a typical month.
While the majority of these 84
percent do not experience
loneliness on an ongoing basis,
25 percent say they often or
almost always feel lonely.

It is worth noting that
loneliness is a state of mind,
not a state of geography.
While it may be uncomfort
able, it is also a force of cul
tural and personal
development. Ultimately, the
goal for most of us is to choose
solitude when we wish to be
alone, rather than experience
loneliness as a condition in
which we are.
For people who feel lonely
there is some associated
thought that they are lonely
because of some negative
quality in themselves. This can
include concerns about physical
unattractiveness, social unat
tractiveness or some social
liability.
Because of rejection, the
person with persisting loneli
ness is less likely to take action
which will heighten the sense
of connection, friendship and
linkage with others. A self-

fulfilling prophecy is created.
Everyone seems to be
waiting for the other person
to say hello first. No one wants
to be the first to risk rejec
tion. So they wait and wait for
someone else to get them out
of their loneliness. Yet it
seems that the risk is the way
to free one's self from loneli
ness. The risk involves a willing
ness to try again to establish
contact if the initial overture
doesn't work.
The next time you feel ap
prehensive about approaching
a new person or group, keep in
mind that at least one out of
four people areound you have
the same fears and experience
the same loneliness.
What is the relationship of anx
iety to stress?

B. Anxiety is a word for more
intense stress.
C. Anxiety is a particular
