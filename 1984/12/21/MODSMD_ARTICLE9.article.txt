BACK RUBS: A hack rub can he an effec
tive pain reliever. Some researchers
believe that a simple back rub stimulates
an area in the brain that produces endor
phins, the natural substances the body
produces to block pain. Heavy massage of
the muscles is not necessary. A back rub
can be effective in reducing pain with
mere gentle strokes by lubricated palms.
BLISTERS: Blisters result from some kind
of physical trauma. They are frequently
seen on the feet after wearing poorly
fitted shoes and boots but are also com
monly seen on the hands. Unless the
blister is very large, it should not be
opened because of the danger of infec
tion. The blister fluid acts as an excellent
culture medium and the opening provides
a route of entrance for bacteria.
BREAST LUMPS: The most common
type of breast lump is the cyst. This type
of lump is not cancerous and is often

fluid-filled. Another common type of
breast lump is the fibroadenoma, which is
a firm growth but is also not cancerous.
Breast cancer is more likely to occur iri
women over 40. Frequent — monthly —
breast self-examination is the best
screening procedure. Self-examination is
best done right after your menstrual per
iod. By frequently examining your
breasts, you can detect even subtle
changes. If you discover a breast lump,
have it examined by a health professional,
ideally right after your menstrual period.
LAUGHTER: A human being's ability to
laugh and to appreciate funny material is
a valuable and valid indicator of the state
of his or her health. Besides being a great
tension reliever, laughter affects the
diaphragm, which is in close proximity to
all other vital organs of the body. A
hearty laugh triggers a whole chain of
healthy reactions.
MITTELSCHMERZ: "Mittelschmerz"
means "middle pain" and refers to the

pain of ovulation which some women ex
perience in the "middle" of their cycles. It
can cause varying degrees of discomfort in
the low abdomen and may occur regularly
each month or be more irregular. The pain
is usually mild, short-lived and on one side.
PROSTATITIS: Prostatitis means inflam
mation of the prostate gland. It is the
most frequent prostate problem in men
under 50. It is not usually something you
get through sexual intercourse, however,
and prostatitis is not a life-threatening
disease, nor is it associated with cancer.
SLEEP: If you are sick or injured your
body needs extra energy available for
healing — for building up antibodies, for
collecting and disposing of bacteria and
for creating new cells to replace cells
destroyed or damaged by sickness. You
get this extra energy from sleep. A good
mental model to follow is that if you get
a case of the 11 u, it will require about the
same energy to heal your body as it would
for you to walk about 150 miles over a

three-day period with a 40-pound pack on
your back. Getting some rest and extra
sleep is good medicine.
TESTICULAR CANCER: While this can
cer accounts for only one percent of all
cancers in males and only three percent of
male urogenital cancer, it is of concern be
cause it occurs mainly in the 20 to 35 age
group. If caught early, testicular cancer
is one of the most curable of cancers; if
not, it is one of the deadliest. Many auth
orities advocate self-examination of the
testes on a monthly basis. The first sign
of testicular cancer is usually a slight en
largement and a change in consistency of
the testes. Although these tumors may
be painless, there is often a dull ache in
the lower abdomen and groin, accompa
nied by a sensation of dragging and heavi
ness. If the tumor is growing rapidly and
hemorrhage is present, there may be a
sharp testicular pain. If any of these
symptoms occur, come to Cowell for a
check-up immediately.
