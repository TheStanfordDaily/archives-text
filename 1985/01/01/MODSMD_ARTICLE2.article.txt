When David Starr Jordan
arrived at Stanford in the summer
of 1891 to be the University's
first president, he found the
countryside enthralling:
"The Santa Clara Vally," he
wrote in his autobiography,
"extends southward 50 miles and
more from near the head of San
Francisco Bay. Bounding it on the
southwest rises ... the Sierra de
la Santa Cruz — ' misty camp of
mountains pitched tumul
tously'. . . .
"Immediately behind the Uni
versity estate and forming its
higher background is the wooded
Sierra Morena, its cloak of red
wood, oak and madrono diver
sified by thickets of chemical. . . .
"On the east, opposing the
green ridges of the Holy Cross,
stretches the long, relatively bar
ren and treeless Sierra del Monte
Diablo."
In this sheltered area 30 miles
south of San Francisco, its favor
able climate assured by its situa
tion between bay and ocean, its
meadows patterned with ancient
oaks, Senator and Mrs. Leland
Stanford established their univer
sity on the site of their suburban
home, Palo Alto.
The first parcel, bought in
1876, consisted of 650 acres
along San Francisquito Creek,
and subsequent purchases ran the
total to 8,250 acres.

The whole of the Stanfords'
land was given to the University
in the 1885 Grant of Endowment
with the stipulation that it should
never be sold.
To this land, Senator Stanford
brought Francis Walker, presi
dent of the Massachusetts In
stitute of Technology, and Fred
erick Law Olmsted, the
prominent lanscape architect, in
the summer of 1886.
They gave serious thought to
locating the campus in the foot
hills of the ranch, so as to take ad
vantage of the magnificent view
of the bay, but they finally
decided to drive in a stake in the
grainfields below, at a point on a
corner of the Inner Quadrangle.
The senator felt the flat site was
more practical for later expan
sion.
Olmsted worked out the gen
eral concept for the grounds and
the buildings, but it remained for
the young Boston architect,
Charles Allerton Coolidge, to
develop this concept in the style
of his late mentor, Henry Hobbs
Richardson, considered the most
eminent architect of his time.
The style is called Ric
hardsonian Romanesque, and it
follows the European
Romanesque, which is character
ized by rectilinear stone buildings
joined by covered arcades. These
arcades are formed of successive

half-circle arches and supported
by short columns with decorated
capitals.
At the University's opening on
Oct. 1, 1891, several buildings
were ready: the inner quad of 12
classroom buildings — with the
central place reserved for the
future Memorial Church — and

three engineering buildings; En
cina Hall, a dorm for men; and
Roble Hall, the women's
residence.
"These long corridors with
their stately pillars," Jordan said
at the dedication, "will have their
part in the students' training.
Each stone in the quadrangle

shall teach its lesson of grace and
genuiness."
President Andrew White of
Cornell pronounced the Stanford
buildings the most beautiful col
lege architecture in America.
But just before 5 a.m. on April

18, 1906, the ground beneath
Stanford's new buildings shook
for 45 seconds. The great
earthquake killed two men on
campus and caused millions of
dollars of damage.
The ponderous church tower,
with its clocks, chimes and spire,
crashed into the chancel of
Memorial Church, and the con
cussion blew out the front wall.
The rose window and the huge
Venetian mosaic of the sermon
on the Mount that had graced the
facade lay as rubble in the inner
quad.
Memorial Arch, the central
structure of the outer quad — 100
feet high and decorated with the
frieze depicting the march of
civilization — was damaged

beyond repair. So were a library
and gymnasium that were just
short of completion. None of
these was replaced.
Reconstruction cost more than
$2 million. Classes were dis
missed until the fall. Seniors in
what has come to be known as
"The Earthquake Class" were
voted their degrees in May.
It was a setback, but only a
temporary one, for the young uni
versity quickly rebuilt, pursuing a
construction project that was
begun in 1886 and that has been
continued intermittently up to the
present.
The construction has taken
place on approximately 5,000
acres reserved by the Board of
Trustees for educational uses.
This is the heart of the Stanford
land, comprised for the most part
of the central portion running
from El Camino Real to the back

boundary in the foothills.
The inner and outer quads oc
cupy 17 acres at the heart of the
academic area. The inner quad's
12 classroom buildings, two of
which are now used by the presi
dent and his staff, date from the
time the University opened in
1891, while the outer quad was
completed in 1903, the same year
that Memorial Church was dedi

cated.
Buildings in the outer quad are
being brought up to earthquake
proof standards by an "inside
out" process of construction to
preserve the sandstone exterior.
The church represents the
Stanfords' deep religious faith,
though they were followers of no
particular denomination. In the
Founding Grant, they directed
the trustees "to have taught in the
University the immortality of the
soul, the existence of an all-wise
and benevolent Creator, and that
obedience to His laws is the high

est duty of man."
To serve the widest needs of
the campus community, they
decreed that the church and the
University were not to be tied to
any particular denomination.
In the original plans, the
central site now occupied by the
church was reserved for it, though
construction was deferred. When
Senator Stanford died in 1893,
his widow determined that the
church would be built as a
memorial to him.
After the earthquake of 1906,
the structure was completely dis

mantled and rebuilt around a
steel framework. Another set of
mosaics was brought from
Venice, but the 80-foot spire,
housing clocks and chimes, was
never rebuilt.
The campift landmark, 285-
foot Hoover Tower, was dedi
cated at the University's 50th an
niversary in 1941. The tower and
the adjoining Lou Henry Hoover
Building (opened in 1967) house
the vast documentary collections
of the Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace — millions
of items that include books, docu

ments, files, manuscripts, diaries
pamphlets, posters, maps and
photos. The Herbert Hoover
Memorial Building, completed in
1978, honors the former presi
dent's humanitarian works.
Just south of the quad is White
Memorial Plaza, a 200,000-
square-foot landscaped area
donated to the University by Mr.
and Mrs. Raymond White in
memory of their sons.
Bordered by the bookstore,
post office, Tresidder Memorial'
Union, the music building and the
old Union — which contains
several student services — the
plaza is a campus crossroads.
In the last 20 years the Univer

sity has raised some $32 million
to pay for new campus facilities
and improvements, including
Maples Pavilion, Meyer Library,
the Green Library annex, the
Terman Engineering Center and
the Mudd Chemistry building.
Plans are now under considera
tion for a complete revamping of
the near-west campus.
