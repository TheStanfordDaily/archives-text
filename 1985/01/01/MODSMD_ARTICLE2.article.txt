When David Starr Jordan
arrived at Stanford in the summer
of 1891 to be the University's
first president, he found the
countryside enthralling:
"The Santa Clara Vally," he
wrote in his autobiography,
"extends southward 50 miles and
more from near the head of San
Francisco Bay. Bounding it on the
southwest rises ... the Sierra de
la Santa Cruz — ' misty camp of
mountains pitched tumul
tously'. . . .
"Immediately behind the Uni
versity estate and forming its
higher background is the wooded
Sierra Morena, its cloak of red
wood, oak and madrono diver
sified by thickets of chemical. . . .
"On the east, opposing the
green ridges of the Holy Cross,
stretches the long, relatively bar
ren and treeless Sierra del Monte
Diablo."
In this sheltered area 30 miles
south of San Francisco, its favor
able climate assured by its situa
tion between bay and ocean, its
meadows patterned with ancient
oaks, Senator and Mrs. Leland
Stanford established their univer
sity on the site of their suburban
home, Palo Alto.
The first parcel, bought in
1876, consisted of 650 acres
along San Francisquito Creek,
and subsequent purchases ran the
total to 8,250 acres.

The whole of the Stanfords'
land was given to the University
in the 1885 Grant of Endowment
with the stipulation that it should
never be sold.
To this land, Senator Stanford
brought Francis Walker, presi
dent of the Massachusetts In
stitute of Technology, and Fred
erick Law Olmsted, the
prominent lanscape architect, in
the summer of 1886.
They gave serious thought to
locating the campus in the foot
hills of the ranch, so as to take ad
vantage of the magnificent view
of the bay, but they finally
decided to drive in a stake in the
grainfields below, at a point on a
corner of the Inner Quadrangle.
The senator felt the flat site was
more practical for later expan
sion.
Olmsted worked out the gen
eral concept for the grounds and
the buildings, but it remained for
the young Boston architect,
Charles Allerton Coolidge, to
develop this concept in the style
of his late mentor, Henry Hobbs
Richardson, considered the most
eminent architect of his time.
The style is called Ric
hardsonian Romanesque, and it
follows the European
Romanesque, which is character
ized by rectilinear stone buildings
joined by covered arcades. These
arcades are formed of successive

half-circle arches and supported
by short columns with decorated
capitals.
At the University's opening on
Oct. 1, 1891, several buildings
were ready: the inner quad of 12
classroom buildings — with the
central place reserved for the
future Memorial Church — and

three engineering buildings; En
cina Hall, a dorm for men; and
Roble Hall, the women's
residence.
"These long corridors with
their stately pillars," Jordan said
at the dedication, "will have their
part in the students' training.
Each stone in the quadrangle

shall teach its lesson of grace and
genuiness."
President Andrew White of
Cornell pronounced the Stanford
buildings the most beautiful col
lege architecture in America.
