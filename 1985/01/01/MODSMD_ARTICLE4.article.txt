# Temples of Tourism to visit in 'The City'
## 
### 
No stay in the area is complete
without a tour of the most
popular tourist digs in"the City."
Listed below are some of San
Francisco's most famous attrac
tions: the rest is up to you. Just
remember —* it's never really
summer in San Francisco, so dress
warmly. And bring a camera.
Cable Cars — Back in opera
tion after a heartbreaking hiatus.
They aren't only transportation,
they're a way of life.
Alcatraz — Known to inmates
as "The Rock," Alcatraz claims
most of its fame from the time
that it was a Devil's Isle-style
federal penitentiary housing such
notable criminals as the bird man.
The island has also been used as a
fortification, a U.S. military
prison, an army diciplinary bar
racks and an American Indian
stronghold. The National Park
Service runs two-hour conducted
tours from the waterfront.
Ghirardelli Square — Here is
where 19th century laborers once
made chocolate, packaged spices
and wove fine woolens.
Nowadays, visitors browse
through a shopping plaza, watch
street performers, and buy choco
late and ice cream in the original
chocolate building.
Chinatown — A long-time resi
dent of Hong Kong once said that
Chinatowm reminded him of
home — the rush-hour traffic
jams on the main drag rivaled any
traffic tie-up a Chinese city could
muster. But Grant Avenue also
offers a kaleidoscope of Asian

delights — restaurants, dim sum
bars, pharmacies displaying
pickled snakes .... The streets
radiating out from Grant Avenue
house one of the largest Chinese
populations outside of China and
plenty of opportunities for explo
ration.
Fisherman's Wharf — Salty fis
hermen, seagulls and the ripe
smell of fish once dominated San
Francisco's wharf. Although the
nearby ships still berth, travelers,
carnivals, wax museums and
tourist shops have almost taken
over the surrounding wharf area.
Still, the 19th-century museum
ship Bajclutha harks back to the
old days, and some of the city's
best restaurants are to be found
along the wharf.
Polk Street — In the pre
supermarket era, this avenue
once supported a posh shopping
district catering to the well-to-do
residents of Russian Hill and Nob
Hill. Gay activists have since sup
planted the fur-coated
housewives and chic shops. Shop
ping on Polk street may no longer
be elite, but it's trendy and fun.
Beware of high prices.
Telegraph Hill — The
Bohemian section of San Fran
cisco. The circuitous streets and
cliff-hanging houses of Telegraph
Hill have been inhabited by suc
cessive generations of flower
children, artists and literati.
49 Mile Drive — This half-day
tour is a planned drive through
the most famous landmarks of
"the City." The route starts on

Van Ness Avenue at the Civic
Center and is clearly marked by
blue-and-white seagull signs.
Palace of Fine Arts — A won
derful anachronism. Created as
the diadem of the 1915 Pacific
Exposition, a central rotunda
embracing a Corinthian
colonnade ornamented, with
friezes and statues comprise the
Palace.
Twin Peaks — A cliche necking
and hangout joint for the Bay
Area's teens, the peaks offer an
intoxicating panorama from the
Marin Headlands to the Santa
Clara Valley.
Lombard Street — A popular
postcard advertises Lombard as
' The crookedest street in the
world." There are 10 hairpin
turns in a single block.
