Newark has discos. Cleveland has discos.
Omaha has discos. Even Marriott's Great
America has discos.-. " -
Houston has a stadium capable of ac
commodating Led Zeppelin. Seattle has a
really big stadium and they put really big
(and trashy and mindless) acts like Aeros
mith in there. Los Angeles has two
stadiums capable of accommodating
Aerosmith, if you count Anaheim (the
Rams did).
And every place has symphonies, albeit
of varied quality. Every place also has
Roller Derby rinks and experimental
theater. Every place has most everything, if
you look long enough — even the most
branch-office of all branch-office
metropoli to go pains to see that this is
true. Quality of performance aside, it just

goes to show that it was a mistake to leave
Kansas in the first place. Maybe out there
you can't get what you want, but you can
get what you need, so to speak.
Everything except nightclubs, that is.
San Francisco's nightclubs, even more than
Herb Caen and the Zodiac Killer, distin
guish this city from every inhabited com
munity outside New York state lines. The
City has both more nightclubs and more
variety than L.A., for instance, which holds
eight times as many human beings.
Of course it is very hard to find one's
way around when one doesn't always know
where to go. It isn't always good to have a
billion zillion nightclubs if your summer
visitor's gujde doesn't at least include a
guide to the good ones.
As usual, the Keystone Palo Alto is the

club most folks know about. It's not the
cheapest club, or the biggest, or the
friendliest, or the one with best sound
(Lord, no!). But it is close, and that means
a lot to a mostly bicycle-bound audience
justifiably uneasy about traversing the
wilds of San Mateo on a stray Samtrans 7F
or facing the Tenderloin district without an
easy escape route.
But location doth not a nightclub make,
and the Keystone is not a nightclub, so
don't let anyone tell you differently. A
nightclub has entertainment, but also gives
you an atmosphere and a chance to con
verse. The Keystone Palo Alto does not
exactly fail in these goals; rather, it
blatantly refuses to attempt reaching them.
Consequently, the selection of bands is
like that of a small concert arena —

country bumpkins one night, multigenarian
blues/jazz artists the next, rapid and rabid
lobotomy rock the next (of both the heavy
metal and punk varieties). For the latter,
be especially forewarned, for Palo Alto
punk rockers are a singularly ridiculous
bunch. Despite the kids with skinny ties
borrowed from their fathers and the
lineups of family Buicks outside the
Keystone dropping off Skip and Cindy for
Punk Nite Out, the dancing inside can of
ten resemble a cross between leapfrog and
rollerball. If you beware of the hazards,
though, the Keystone is always a good
guess in the spontaneous "let's go to a
show" rallies common in dorms around the
end of a quarter.
If, on the other hand, you enjoy
the hazards and want to go out of
your way to create them, then the
Mabuhay Gardens is waiting for
you with open safety pins. Five or
six years after the fact, punk
music seems to have settled its
feud with (and acknowledged
debt to) heavy metal. Perhaps in
deference to this newly dis
covered patrimony (or perhaps to
the sacred cash cow of the con
certgoing public), punk clubs of
ten have "metal nights" and
everyday audiences definitely
have more of an axle-grease aura
around them these days. Which is
actually perfect for the Mabuhay
Gardens. While the Keystone acts
like a small arena, the Fab Mab is
more like a slightly oversized ga
rage, with brick walls and a self
consciously dangerous air about
it. The bands have the best names
in the Bay Area, though certainly
not the tonal quality. Still thriving
as a Polynesian restaurant by
day/leatherette cave by night, the
club is best for those who under
stand the colossal joke taking
place six or seven nights a week.
That's entertainment.
Roosting at the mouth of
Broadway, the Fab Mab also
serves as an introduction to the
North Beach area of the City,
where most of the real nightclubs
(i.e., the ones that advertise)
reside. Right across the street

from the Mab is The Stone,
owned by the same folks who dis
pense entertainment at the
Keystone Palo Alto and the
Keystone Berkeley. The Stone is
sort of a hybrid; it has the physi
cal qualities of its immediate
neighbor but the musical selec
tion of the Keystone, a decidedly
pop flavor (they often share
bands, staging the same show at
each 'stone on successive nights).
If you go down Broadway a few
blocks (negotiating your way past
the massage parlors and Carol
Doda's) and turn onto Columbus,

you'll eventually pass Wolfgang's,
the physical successor to the
Boarding House (901 Columbus)
and the spiritual heir to the Old
Waldorf as Bill Graham's Home
for Acts That Can't Sell Out the
Coliseum. Amazingly enough,
few of the many sins of the father
are visited upon the latest off
spring: The sound is decent, the
stage and lighting very good, and
there's even a balcony for those
who really don't go to clubs to see
the band. The only caveats to the
clubber are well-known to Wal
dorf denizens: beware the chairs

(bicycle seats with legs), the drink
minimum (the "Calistoga with
Orange Flavor" tastes like it
should have "Agent" in there
somewhere) and the food
(Chicken Lollipops? McPutrid).
Better chairs and better shows
can be found at the other Graham
venue, the Kabuki Nightclub at
the Japan Center near Geary
Street. Located significantly west
of North Beach, the Kabuki
nonetheless has even more tradi
tional nightclub aesthetics; it's big
and flashy, like the nightclubs in
1930s musicals, with lots of tables

for the Nicholas Brothers to
dance across. It's a little bit odd to
see Greg Kihn play in a place that
should have Billie Holiday, but
it's still a roomy, nice club. The
videos in the lobby help, as does
the Japantown Bowling Alley
across the street (open until 4
a.m. Wednesdays and Thursdays
and 24 hours on weekends).
If you accept the above three
elements — music, rock video
and bowling — as a sort of a holy
trinity of night-on-the-town ex
periences, then the Park Bowl on
Haight Street was designed with
you in mind. Located a couple of
blocks away from the I-Beam, one
of the more elaborate dance clubs
on the scene (forget the bands —
the stage is a show in itself), the
Park Bowl is your basic, well
mannered, direct-from-Muncie,
Indiana, bowling alley during the
week. But on Friday and Satur
day nights, the lights go down, the
volume goes up, and a 12-foot
video screen descends and hovers
around the center lanes. It, and
satellite TV sets around the
country, shows rock videos and
the like while the paying custom
ers ($6 cover charge for entrance
and about two hours of tenpin
ning) take their turns at the line
and dance back to their seats.
There's a bar, too, for the athleti
cally inclined. As a concept, the
Park Bowl is fascinating; it in
spires the kind of never-there
but-nostalgic-anyway sigh that

you only hear outside old drive-in
hamburger stands and Broadway
revivals. Moreover, the darn
thing works; it's a lot of fun, and
you very rarely get a chance to
think what a stupid game bowling
is. If nightclubbing is the art of
distraction, the Park Bowl on
Friday and Saturday nights
should be bronzed.
Don't think of this guide to
nightclubbing as being more than
a series of press-box tracer shells,
however; you're going to have to
make the rounds yourself. In your
search, you'll probably find clubs
off the beaten path, and certainly
ones not mentioned here. The
North Beach area has most of the
big clubs, for example, but there's

a better variety of acts south of
Market Street around the China
Basin (where the Giants and the
city want to insert a new domed
baseball stadium, provided
Southern Pacific can be per
suaded not to build an entire cor
porate Atlantis on the same
land). The only problem with this
area is that most of the "clubs"
are converted warehouses, with
few comforts and even fewer
ways of finding out about perfor
mances. If you can learn you way
around there, you'll be in an "in
crowd" that's so in, no one knows
it's there.
In any case, there are some
relatively hard-and-fast (as
opposed to soft-and-slow) rules
about finding a particular roost
for your night-owl habits.
Rule No. 1 of nightclub
choosery specifically prohibits

parties of the first part from fol
lowing only high fame quotient
stars. High fame quotient stars
usually end up in stadiums, with
high boredom quotient warm-up
acts — you must remember that
nightclubs depend on medium
small entertainers.
"Medium-small" generally has
to do only with album sales,
however, as does the "high fame
quotient" — the point is that you
ought not wait all year for your
favorite group. They'll sell out
anyway, if they play in a
nightclub, so what true clubbers
ought to do is experiment with
their ears.
And you should know in ad
vance that rule No. 2 is not for a
great many people. It requires
that you admit the existence of a
flow. Yet it is important, and we
should shed our misconceptions

eventually. So remember this —
despite the popularity of compo
nent stereo systems with multi
colored dials and switches, most
of humanity is unable to tell a
good sound system from a dixie
cup on a string. It follows from
this that although sound systems
vary in nightclubs, to most people
it really doesn't matter.
Next, it is absolutely essential
to know what kind of crowd you
like. There's a world of difference
between Mabuhay Gardens-type
crowds and the rest of mankind as
we know it, for example.
Rule No. 3 has to do with ticket
prices, but that's usually in the
paper, so forget it.
And the differences in food and
drink prices begat Rule No. 4.
And 10, the multitudes were told
not to forget that gasoline is
sometimes required when return

is made to Palo Alto and they
were told that they would have to
sleep in an alley. And the mul
titude adhered to the command
ments of the golden calf of tui
tion, and called in advance to find
out the drink minimum.
And finally, over at Rule No. 5,
everybody got the Final Clue.
When you choose a club and like
it, go back. Frequent the place
that treated you like you wanted
to be treated. The psychological
difference between an easy I.D.
check and the jerk who laughs
and says you don't look 13 can be
considerable, and a place that has
extra dancing space might turn
things around. Never underes
timate the power of a pleasant at
mosphere, once you've made up
your mind as to your definition of
"pleasant."
