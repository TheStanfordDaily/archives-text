# Where to go when the sun goes down

Newark has discos. Cleveland has discos.
Omaha has discos. Even Marriott's Great
America has discos.-. " -
Houston has a stadium capable of ac
commodating Led Zeppelin. Seattle has a
really big stadium and they put really big
(and trashy and mindless) acts like Aeros
mith in there. Los Angeles has two
stadiums capable of accommodating
Aerosmith, if you count Anaheim (the
Rams did).
And every place has symphonies, albeit
of varied quality. Every place also has
Roller Derby rinks and experimental
theater. Every place has most everything, if
you look long enough — even the most
branch-office of all branch-office
metropoli to go pains to see that this is
true. Quality of performance aside, it just

goes to show that it was a mistake to leave
Kansas in the first place. Maybe out there
you can't get what you want, but you can
get what you need, so to speak.
Everything except nightclubs, that is.
San Francisco's nightclubs, even more than
Herb Caen and the Zodiac Killer, distin
guish this city from every inhabited com
munity outside New York state lines. The
City has both more nightclubs and more
variety than L.A., for instance, which holds
eight times as many human beings.
Of course it is very hard to find one's
way around when one doesn't always know
where to go. It isn't always good to have a
billion zillion nightclubs if your summer
visitor's gujde doesn't at least include a
guide to the good ones.
As usual, the Keystone Palo Alto is the

club most folks know about. It's not the
cheapest club, or the biggest, or the
friendliest, or the one with best sound
(Lord, no!). But it is close, and that means
a lot to a mostly bicycle-bound audience
justifiably uneasy about traversing the
wilds of San Mateo on a stray Samtrans 7F
or facing the Tenderloin district without an
easy escape route.
But location doth not a nightclub make,
and the Keystone is not a nightclub, so
don't let anyone tell you differently. A
nightclub has entertainment, but also gives
you an atmosphere and a chance to con
verse. The Keystone Palo Alto does not
exactly fail in these goals; rather, it
blatantly refuses to attempt reaching them.
Consequently, the selection of bands is
like that of a small concert arena —

country bumpkins one night, multigenarian
blues/jazz artists the next, rapid and rabid
lobotomy rock the next (of both the heavy
metal and punk varieties). For the latter,
be especially forewarned, for Palo Alto
punk rockers are a singularly ridiculous
bunch. Despite the kids with skinny ties
borrowed from their fathers and the
lineups of family Buicks outside the
Keystone dropping off Skip and Cindy for
Punk Nite Out, the dancing inside can of
ten resemble a cross between leapfrog and
rollerball. If you beware of the hazards,
though, the Keystone is always a good
guess in the spontaneous "let's go to a
show" rallies common in dorms around the
end of a quarter.
