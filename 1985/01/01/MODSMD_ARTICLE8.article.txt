# Bicycling and beaches around the Farm
## 
### LISA LYNCH 
True, California summertime
weather goes quite well with a tall
glass of iced tea, a good book and
a hammock. But the Great Out
doors is good for more than a
great tan — be sure to save some
time on your calendar to get off
the Farm and into a pair of roller
skates, an inner tube, a sailboat or
scuba gear — and maybe get into
shape.
Instead of walking the streets
of San Francisco, why not
rollerskate? There are rental
places in Golden Gate Park
where you can get a prime pair of
skates for about $5 a day.
Bicycles generally cost $1.50-
$2 per hour, depending on the
speed and make. Be sure to bring
an I.D. and deposit money. Ave
nue Cyclery, on the east side of
the park, has 3-, 5- and 10-speeds
and is open every day (phone
387-3155).
For those who prefer to be in
rather than on the water, there's
always the beach. The Pacific
Ocean is less than an hour away
from Stanford. Half Moon Bay,
with its beautiful beaches and
cliffs, can be reached by driving
on Interstate 280 to San Mateo
and then Highway 92 west. For a
more scenic route, and one that
can be traveled by bike or moped,
take Sand Hill Road over Inter
state 280 and beyond, pass Whis

key Hill Road, and turn right over
Sand Hill onto Portola Road.
Turn left from Portola onto La
Honda Road, which winds
through some breathtaking red
wood forests up to Skyline
Boulevard. Continue on La
Honda down to the coast at San
Gregorio Beach, which has great
caves and a concession stand, but
closes at dusk. Beaches with
campgrounds are farther down
the road.
The water at San Gregorio is
cold (actually freezing). The
water south of Santa Cruz won't
give you hypothermia, but there
are strong undercurrents and only
the hardy should venture a swim.
The beaches outside of San
Francisco are predictably windy,
but pretty — the Point Reyes Na
tional Seashore, on the other side
of the Golden Gate Bridge, has
miles of hiking areas.
If you find bodies beautiful and
tan lines disgusting, there are
several nude beaches in the Bay
Area. Edun Cove Beach, prob
ably the most beautiful of them
all, is located on private land
outside of San Francisco. To get
there, follow Highway 1 past
Rockaway Beach, past the point
where the highway turns into a
two-lane road, and three miles
past an A&W stand. You'll see an
American flag and a sign that says
"Beach Parking" (there's a

charge for parking).
For those who prefer woods to
water, there are of course Califor
nia's incomparable state parks,
which offer trails for hiking and
campgrounds for camping. The
closest parks include Mount
Tamalpais, site of the famous
Muir Woods. Tamalpais, which is
north of San Francisco, has won
derful hiking trails,
Castle Rock, off of Skyline

Boulevard, is a favorite of rock
climbers. Call 408-338-6132 for
camping reservations. The Big
Basin Redwoods State Park, in
the Santa Cruz Mountains, has
more than 35 miles of hiking
trails; call 408-338-5132 for
reservations.
Camping equipment is easy to
get; the SOAR office at Tresidder
rents tents, backpacks and sleep
ing bags cheaply, and North Face

of Palo Alto has equipment at
reasonable prices.
Those who only want a mild
dose of the outdoors can go to
one of Palo Alto's community
parks; many offer picnic facilities
and playing fields. Byxbee Park,
at East Embarcadero, has 1,800
acres of land, a duck pond, an 18-
acre golf course, a Nature In
terpretive center and a yacht har
bor.
