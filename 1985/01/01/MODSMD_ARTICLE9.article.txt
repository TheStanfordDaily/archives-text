# More than just another film

### 
During the school year, seven or eight film series
may be in operation at ihe same time, but most sum
mers only the ASSU Sunday Flicks— dealing exclu
sively in recent theatrical releases (and usually box
office hits) — continues to screen films. However,
the Peninsula boasts a large number and variety of
moviehouses, both first- and second-run, that make
it possible not only to go to the movies every night
but also to skip, if you so desire, that long trek to the
city. In Palo Alto, Menlo Park and Mountain View
alone there are several theaters, and within a 15- or
20-minute distance — in Redwood City, San Mateo
and Belmont — newly arrived movie addicts will
find their needs liberally tended to:
New Varsity — located on University Avenue be
tween Waverley and Cowper Streets, the New Var
sity is a nearly ideal repertory cinema. Double bills
(and occasionally triple bills) change every day or
two, and they offer not only recent films (often hot
off the first-run screens) but also American and
foreign classics, some not often revived. If a
relatively unpublicized movie opens in San Fran
cisco and fails to show up first-run in Palo Also,
chances are it will surface at the New Varsity within
6 or 8 months. The seats are slightly rickety and un
comfortable, but the Varsity's patrons don't seem to
mind very much. The building also houses an
indoor-outdoor cafe-restaurant where locals often
gather in the evenings for coffee, dessert and live
music in the courtyard. Warning: On Friday nights
the Varsity is a hangout for teenagers — a
responsive but perhaps overly vocal audience for
the movies the management has lately provided to
cater to high school audiences.
Aquarius — The Aquarius, on Emerson between

University and Lytton, has two small cinemas that
show mostly foreign films, with the occasional
"small" American feature like "Chilly Scenes of
Winter' or "Angelo, My Love." Since it is one of
Palo Alto's major claims to culture, it is nearly al
ways crowded on Friday and Saturday nights; the
Palo Alto moviegoing crowd tends to adopt certain
movies that open at the Aquarius — "El Norte" or
"Carmen" — and keep them playing there for
months. It's your basic (essential) university theater,
and though its films are (of course) of highly
variable quality, the management has never com
promised its decision to show only arthouse selec
tions.
Fine Arts — On Califonria Avenue, just east of El
Camino — in the midst of the nicest commercial
area in Palo Alto. The Fine Arts is a fairly nice
theater, known in the past for grabbing hold of
movies it could show for months and months — like
"An Officer and a Gentleman" or "Gandhi." Lately
the turnover has been more rapid. The management
of the theater, it should be noted, is not especially
nice; chances are that someone will snap at you on
your way in.
Palo Alto Square — These twin theaters take up
the bottom floor of a very bland-looking office
building at the corner of El Camino and Page Mill
Road. They draw mostly high school kids, because
they tend to show boffo films like "Footloose" and
"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom." But they
are undeniably comfortable and convenient (if you
have a car).
