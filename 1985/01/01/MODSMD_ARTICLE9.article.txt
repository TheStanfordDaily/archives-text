# More than just another film
## 
### 
During the school year, seven or eight film series
may be in operation at ihe same time, but most sum
mers only the ASSU Sunday Flicks— dealing exclu
sively in recent theatrical releases (and usually box
office hits) — continues to screen films. However,
the Peninsula boasts a large number and variety of
moviehouses, both first- and second-run, that make
it possible not only to go to the movies every night
but also to skip, if you so desire, that long trek to the
city. In Palo Alto, Menlo Park and Mountain View
alone there are several theaters, and within a 15- or
20-minute distance — in Redwood City, San Mateo
and Belmont — newly arrived movie addicts will
find their needs liberally tended to:
New Varsity — located on University Avenue be
tween Waverley and Cowper Streets, the New Var
sity is a nearly ideal repertory cinema. Double bills
(and occasionally triple bills) change every day or
two, and they offer not only recent films (often hot
off the first-run screens) but also American and
foreign classics, some not often revived. If a
relatively unpublicized movie opens in San Fran
cisco and fails to show up first-run in Palo Also,
chances are it will surface at the New Varsity within
6 or 8 months. The seats are slightly rickety and un
comfortable, but the Varsity's patrons don't seem to
mind very much. The building also houses an
indoor-outdoor cafe-restaurant where locals often
gather in the evenings for coffee, dessert and live
music in the courtyard. Warning: On Friday nights
the Varsity is a hangout for teenagers — a
responsive but perhaps overly vocal audience for
the movies the management has lately provided to
cater to high school audiences.
Aquarius — The Aquarius, on Emerson between

University and Lytton, has two small cinemas that
show mostly foreign films, with the occasional
"small" American feature like "Chilly Scenes of
Winter' or "Angelo, My Love." Since it is one of
Palo Alto's major claims to culture, it is nearly al
ways crowded on Friday and Saturday nights; the
Palo Alto moviegoing crowd tends to adopt certain
movies that open at the Aquarius — "El Norte" or
"Carmen" — and keep them playing there for
months. It's your basic (essential) university theater,
and though its films are (of course) of highly
variable quality, the management has never com
promised its decision to show only arthouse selec
tions.
Fine Arts — On Califonria Avenue, just east of El
Camino — in the midst of the nicest commercial
area in Palo Alto. The Fine Arts is a fairly nice
theater, known in the past for grabbing hold of
movies it could show for months and months — like
"An Officer and a Gentleman" or "Gandhi." Lately
the turnover has been more rapid. The management
of the theater, it should be noted, is not especially
nice; chances are that someone will snap at you on
your way in.
Palo Alto Square — These twin theaters take up
the bottom floor of a very bland-looking office
building at the corner of El Camino and Page Mill
Road. They draw mostly high school kids, because
they tend to show boffo films like "Footloose" and
"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom." But they
are undeniably comfortable and convenient (if you
have a car).
Guild, Park — These are Menlo Park's two movie

theaters. (There used to be a third, the Menlo, but it
closed a couple of years ago and its space was ab
sorbed by an expanding Chinese restaurant.) They
are located a couple of blocks from each other on El
Camino. Each offers first-run movies of all kinds,
including "art house" films like "This Is Spinal
Tap." They are pleasant theaters, and pretty
reliable with regard to programming — generally
speaking, at least one of them is offering a film
worth seeing at any given time.
Old Mill 6 — The bane of a moviegoer's existence
— you can't avoid seeing films here, because since
there are six screens, two or three new pictures
arrive every week. Besides, the bargain-price
twilight shows are very seductive. (The cinemas can
celled their other attractive deal: All showings on
Tuesday nights were featured at 99 cents. Tuesday
night reduced prices are now subject to the whims of
the management.) But the screens are tiny, the
theater is always crowded, and you move from line
to line until you feel you're being processed. Fur
thermore, it's an offensively ugly environment in
which to see movies — the theater looks vaguely
like a video arcade. But if you must, you must. Lo
cated in the Old Mill Shopping Mall on San Antonio

Road, near the San Antonio Shopping Center. (The
easiest way to get to it is via Alma; if you take the
San Antonio turnoff, you'll find immediate signs for
the Old Mill.)
U.A. Redwood 6 — Another six-screen theater,
the U.A. is located in one of the most unattractive
areas in Redwood City (which is saying a lot), and
the theater is even more claustrophobic than the
Old Mill. But it's not as popular (I've never been
turned away) and all matinees (except Sundays and
holidays) are offered at bargain prices.
Mann 6 — Fashion Island Shopping Mall, located
in San Mateo just off Route 92 (heading toward the
San Mateo Bridge — watch for the turnoff to the
right, or you'll end up in Hayward), is amazing. The
shopping center is enormous, and you drive around
it for what seems like hours before you can park
outside the Mann 6 theaters. Inside sits every junk
food shop you've every craved (or avoided) —
usually semi-vacant. Before slipping in to see a
movie at one of the six small screens, you can sit and
lick your Haagen-Dazs chocolate-cholocate chip
cone or bite into your corn dog while watching kids
ice skate on the rink that separates the fast food
stands from the movies. Fashion Island is also big on
bargain matinees, and if you pick an unconventional
time to go (like 5:00 in the afternoon) you can see

even a blockbuster like "Indiana
Jones" without a wait. Besides,
it's a pop cultural experience you
won't want to miss.
Any local paper will tell you

what's playing at each of the
above theaters except those north
of Menlo Park — you'll need a
Chronicle or an Examiner for that
information. The bills usually
change on Fridays (except for the
revival cinemas, of course). The
best overall guide to the movies is
the Arts and Entertainment sec

tion of the Sunday Examiner &
Chronicle, affectionately known
as the "pink section." A number
of local theaters advertise in The
Daily as do the on-campus film
series. A selective list of movies
(mostly revivals) appears in the
"Cinemascope" section of The
Daily every Friday.
