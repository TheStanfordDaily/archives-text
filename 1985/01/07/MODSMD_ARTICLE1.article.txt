# Growing pains
## GSB, LOTS, Applied Physics gain facilities 
### BOB COHN Senior staff Writer 
Responding to a severe space
shortage in many University depart
ments, the Stanford Board of Trus
tees approved three major expansion
projects at its Dec. 11 meeting.
Construction of a new academic
computing center, an annex for the
Applied Physics Department and an
addition to the Graduate School of
Business (GSB) will probably begin
this year.
The board was also expected to
recommend site proposals to the
White House for the Ronald Reagan
Presidential Library, but that decision
was postponed after a trustee com
mittee determined the issue required
more discussion time.
The board approved the concept of
a new academic computing center to

house the LOTS and Instruction and
Research Information Systems
(IRIS) facilities. The 30,000- to
50,000-square-foot structure, ex
pected to cost between $4 million and
$6.5 million, will unite both comput
ing systems under one roof. Existing
LOTS mainframes and minicom
puters, however, will remain in the

Center for Educational Research at
Stanford (CERAS).
The proposed site for the comput
ing facility is a grassy area between
CERAS, Meyer Library and Stern
Hall. Referred to as the "Stern Beach
site" in the trustees' agenda packet,
the location may prove controversial
as it is one of the last undeveloped
plots of land in the center of campus.
It has been designated for building
use on the University master plan for
more than 20 years.
According to the agenda, a build
ing could be designed for this site
"without serious aesthetic impact, al
though there will be, in the near term,
a perceived impact from the loss of
pleasant open space."
"This location is a sensitive one be
cause it is in an eclectic but prominent
neighborhood," according to the
agenda. "The challenge will be to
design an attractive but unobtrusive
building which lives comfortably in an
area of both strong (CERAS, Meyer,
Law School) and weak (Stern Hall)
architecture."
LOTS' current space has been on
loan from the School of Education
since 1976. IRIS, whose services in
clude offering technical advice on
hardware and software concerns,
teaching courses in the use of infor
mation technology, and writing,
editing and publishing documents on
information systems, is now located
in a wing of Cypress Hall and in an
adjacent trailer.
If the trustees approve the project
and its design at the February
meeting, construction will begin im
mediately thereafter, with occupancy
expected by early 1986.
The board also approved construc
tion of a 12,000-square-foot annex to
the Applied Physics/Gintzon Labora
tory Building. The $2.2 million addi
tion is designed to help alleviate se
vere space problems in the depart
ment.

The building will provide space for
future faculty offices, for current fac
ulty and students displaced by the
crowded conditions in the existing
structure and for teaching. Construc
tion is expected to be completed by
September.
According to Lynda Weisberg, as
sistant provost for facilities planning,
the space shortage is ;o drastic that
the Applied Physics Department has
delayed filling three faculty positions,
two of them at the senior level. Five
postdoctoral fellows and 30 graduate
students also need workspace, she
said.
A shortage of space at the GSB
also prompted the board to approve
the site for a $ 12-million to $13.5-
million expansion of that school. A
new building will be located just
north of the existing facility, between
Frost Amphitheater and the Oval.
Although various schemes are un
der consideration, the structure will
probably stand four or five stories
and contain between 40,000 and
50,000 square feet.
Board members postponed site ap
proval for the GSB expansion in Oc
tober, asking planners to reconsider
other options. Nevertheless, the
board approved the originally recom
mended site last month, rejecting
other sites because they were too
close to the Oval and thus affected
the University's main entrance. If the
board approves design proposals in
May, construction could be com
pleted by October 1987.
Paul Johnson, associate dean of the
business school, underscored the im
portance of the expansion.
"The point is right now we can't
even handle the faculty we have," he
said. "We are already overcrowded."
These three expansion projects —
combined with a multi-level parking
garage and a state-of-the-art tele-


William Kimball
communications system. both ap
proved by the board in October —
will join the whir of campus construc
tion currently underway. In total,
these projects guarantee that jack
hammers. tractors and trucks will
pester at least another generation of
students.
University President Donald Ken
nedy and Provost James Rosse faced
that grim reality when, in a Sept. 2ft
letter to board members, they said:
"If Stanford is to move forward in the
years ahead, we are in for a decade of
building activity."
In other action, the board ap
proved a $145 million fund-raising
program to support capital projects
and endowments for the Stanford
Medical Center.
Kennedy compared the plan to the
effort that resulted in the financing of
the original medical center in the late
19505.
Among the projects to he funded
by the $145 million include: the Cen
ter for Molecular and Genetic
Medicine ($5O million); the New
Children's Hospital at Stanford ($4O
million); the Magnetic Resonance
Center ($5 million); and renovation
of the Stanford University clinic ($2
million).
The board also began a lengthy in
vestigation of Stanford's policy on
debt for academic facilities. Perhaps
as a logical result of increased expan
sion, board members acknowledged
that current debt practices may be in
need of reform in order to "meet ur
gent needs."
According to a summary of the
debt policy. "The need for capital is
pressing."

Law School) and weak (Stern Hall)
architecture."
LOTS' current space has been on
loan from the School of Education
since 1976. IRIS, whose services in
clude offering technical advice on
hardware and software concerns,
teaching courses in the use of infor
mation technology, and writing,
editing and publishing documents on
information systems, is now located
in a wing of Cypress Hall and in an
adjacent trailer.
If the trustees approve the project
and its design at the February
meeting, construction will begin im
mediately thereafter, with occupancy
expected by early 1986.
The board also approved construc
tion of a 12,000-square-foot annex to
the Applied Physics/Gintzon Labora
tory Building. The $2.2 million addi
tion is designed to help alleviate se
vere space problems in the depart
ment.

The building will provide space for
future faculty offices, for current fac
ulty and students displaced by the
crowded conditions in the existing
structure and for teaching. Construc
tion is expected to be completed by
September.
According to Lynda Weisberg, as
sistant provost for facilities planning,
the space shortage is ;o drastic that
the Applied Physics Department has
delayed filling three faculty positions,
two of them at the senior level. Five
postdoctoral fellows and 30 graduate
students also need workspace, she
said.
A shortage of space at the GSB
also prompted the board to approve
the site for a $ 12-million to $13.5-
million expansion of that school. A
new building will be located just
north of the existing facility, between
Frost Amphitheater and the Oval.
Although various schemes are un
der consideration, the structure will
probably stand four or five stories
and contain between 40,000 and
50,000 square feet.
Board members postponed site ap
proval for the GSB expansion in Oc
tober, asking planners to reconsider
other options. Nevertheless, the
board approved the originally recom
mended site last month, rejecting
other sites because they were too
close to the Oval and thus affected
the University's main entrance. If the
board approves design proposals in
May, construction could be com
pleted by October 1987.
Paul Johnson, associate dean of the
business school, underscored the im
portance of the expansion.
"The point is right now we can't
even handle the faculty we have," he
said. "We are already overcrowded."
These three expansion projects —
combined with a multi-level parking
garage and a state-of-the-art tele-


William Kimball
communications system. both ap
proved by the board in October —
will join the whir of campus construc
tion currently underway. In total,
these projects guarantee that jack
hammers. tractors and trucks will
pester at least another generation of
students.
University President Donald Ken
nedy and Provost James Rosse faced
that grim reality when, in a Sept. 2ft
letter to board members, they said:
"If Stanford is to move forward in the
years ahead, we are in for a decade of
building activity."
In other action, the board ap
proved a $145 million fund-raising
program to support capital projects
and endowments for the Stanford
Medical Center.
Kennedy compared the plan to the
effort that resulted in the financing of
the original medical center in the late
19505.
Among the projects to he funded
by the $145 million include: the Cen
ter for Molecular and Genetic
Medicine ($5O million); the New
Children's Hospital at Stanford ($4O
million); the Magnetic Resonance
Center ($5 million); and renovation
of the Stanford University clinic ($2
million).
The board also began a lengthy in
vestigation of Stanford's policy on
debt for academic facilities. Perhaps
as a logical result of increased expan
sion, board members acknowledged
that current debt practices may be in
need of reform in order to "meet ur
gent needs."
According to a summary of the
debt policy. "The need for capital is
pressing."
Responding to a severe space
shortage in many University depart
ments, the Stanford Board of Trus
tees approved three major expansion
projects at its Dec. 11 meeting.
Construction of a new academic
computing center, an annex for the
Applied Physics Department and an
addition to the Graduate School of
Business (GSB) will probably begin
this year.
The board was also expected to
recommend site proposals to the
White House for the Ronald Reagan
Presidential Library, but that decision
was postponed after a trustee com
mittee determined the issue required
more discussion time.
The board approved the concept of
a new academic computing center to

house the LOTS and Instruction and
Research Information Systems
(IRIS) facilities. The 30,000- to
50,000-square-foot structure, ex
pected to cost between $4 million and
$6.5 million, will unite both comput
ing systems under one roof. Existing
LOTS mainframes and minicom
puters, however, will remain in the

Center for Educational Research at
Stanford (CERAS).
The proposed site for the comput
ing facility is a grassy area between
CERAS, Meyer Library and Stern
Hall. Referred to as the "Stern Beach
site" in the trustees' agenda packet,
the location may prove controversial
as it is one of the last undeveloped
plots of land in the center of campus.
It has been designated for building
use on the University master plan for
more than 20 years.
According to the agenda, a build
ing could be designed for this site
"without serious aesthetic impact, al
though there will be, in the near term,
a perceived impact from the loss of
pleasant open space."
"This location is a sensitive one be
cause it is in an eclectic but prominent
neighborhood," according to the
agenda. "The challenge will be to
design an attractive but unobtrusive
building which lives comfortably in an
area of both strong (CERAS, Meyer,
Law School) and weak (Stern Hall)
architecture."
