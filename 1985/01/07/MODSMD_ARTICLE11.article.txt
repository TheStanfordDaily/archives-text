Protesters greet Kennedy
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Sen. Edward
Kennedy, starting an eight-day visit to South Africa to
mobilize opposition to its apartheid policies of racial
segregation, landed in the midst of a black political feud
when he arrived here Saturday.
The Massachusetts Democrat was met at Johannes
burg's Jan Smuts Airport not only by Bishop Desmond
Tutu, the Nobel Peace Prize winner and one of his hosts
here, but also by about 100 protesters from a militant
black group, the Azanian People's Organization.
"Kennedy, go home!" the placard-waving
demonstrators shouted as the senator left the airport.
They scuffled with those supporting the visit and with
police, who briefly detained nine of the anti-Kennedy
protesters for violating a ban on demonstrations at the air
port.
'•My community is divided," Tutu warned Kennedy in
brief welcoming remarks, "and they will show their oppo
sition to your visit."
That opposition, which reflects increasingly bitter poli
tical divisions among South Africa's 24 million blacks,
now threatens to undercut Kennedy's visit, embarrassing
the senator and clouding the attempt to recruit support for
the campaign against apartheid.
The Azanian People's Organization, a 6-year-old
"black consciousness" group, believes that apartheid and
South Africa's white minority regime must be brought
down through the efforts of the country's black people
themselves, and that whites, here or abroad, must play
only a supporting role lest they take over the whole
struggle.
Other groups here, which together call themselves
"progressive democrats," urge a multiracial effort against
apartheid and accord whites prominent roles in their or
ganizations.
This division in both philosophy and tactics runs deep
and splits South African blacks in virtually everything.
Whatever one side proposes, the other side will criticize
and even actively oppose.
The Azanian People's Organization a month ago and
again last week objected to/Kennedy's visit, saying the
senator was merely campaigning for the American
presidency. It plans protests at virtually every stop of the
trip, garnering considerable publicity for itself and its
"black consciousness" approach.
"Ted Kennedy must be informed that the black people
of Azania (South Africa) are not his ticket to the
presidency and that our enemies include the American
imperialism that props up the racist regime here," the or
ganization said in a statement.
Democrats oust Price
WASHINGTON — In a sharp break with tradition.
House Democrats Friday ousted Rep. Melvin Price (D
-III.), SO, as chairman of the powerful Armed Services
Committee and reached well down in committee ranks to
give the post to Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.), 46, a frequent
critic of the Defense Department.
All other incumbent chairmen were re-elected by the
Democrats, who met in caucus. In addition, the caucus
filled three vacancies. Rep. William Gray 111 (D-Pa.) was
chosen to be chairman of the House Budget Committee;
Rep. Julian Dixon (D-Calif.) was picked to head the
Committee on Standards of Official Conduct; and Rep.
Lee Hamilton (D-lnd.) was named as chairman of the
Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.

The elevation of the generally liberal Aspin to head
Armed Services suggests the committee, and House
Democrats generally, may be less willing than in President
Reagan's first four years to approve his defense buildup.
But Aspin, a sophisticate on defense issues, also has
been willing to compromise with Reagan on occasion and
helped engineer a victory for the MX missile two years
ago in a tradeoff for arms control concessions.
Gray, a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, is
also likely to be more liberal than his predecessor, Rep.
James Jones (D-Okla.), who could not remain as chair
man under House rules. But Gray has said his liberal
credentials give him considerable leeway to take on issues
others would not touch.
The 121-1 18 secret ballot to strip Price of the armed
services chairmanship occurred after House Speaker
Thomas (Tip) O'Neill Jr. (D-Mass.) pleaded that Price be
given one more term as chairman so that he can " leave the
House with the same thing he brought here — dignity."
After voting against Price, who sat quietly through the
debate on his abilities, the Democrats then voted 125-103
to pass over the next senior Democrat, Rep. Charles Ben
nett (Fla.), 74, and make Aspin the chairman. Aspin is
seventh in seniority on the committee, but committee
members more senior to him did not run in deference to
Bennett.
Democrats control the House by 70 votes and they
select committee chairmen.
By tradition, the chairman of a committee is its most
senior member. In only a handful of cases this century has
the majority party ousted a chairman, most recently in
1975 when a group of younger Democrats succeeded in
removing three chairmen they viewed as too authortarian.
One, Rep. F. Edward Hebert ( D-La.), chairman of armed
services, was pushed out in that coup — to be replaced by
Price, the next-senior Democrat.
Zaccaro may plead guilty
NEW YORK — John Zaccaro, husband of Democratic
vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro, is consider
ing pleading guilty to unspecified charges stemming from
an investigation into some of his business dealings, his
lawyer said Saturday.
Zaccaro, whose financial affairs became an issue during
his wife's unsuccessful 1984 campaign with Walter
Mondale, is now "looking at all of his options, and consid
ering pleading guilty is one of them," attorney John
Koegel told The Associated Press.
Koegel denied a report in yesterday's editions of The
New York Times that the possible plea by the real estate
manager involves the falsification of a sales contract for
five apartment buildings.
"That's completely wrong," Koegel said. "It's on an
other matter," he said, refusing to give further details.
The Times said that after a three-month investigation
by Manhattan prosecutors, a grand jury last week voted
sealed indictments of Zaccaro and three others in connec
tion with two separate cases.
A spokeswoman for the Manhattan District Attorney's
office, Mary deßourbon, would not verify accounts that
the husband of the three-term Queens congresswoman
may be pondering a guilty plea, or detail possible charges.
"We wouldn't confirm or deny anything," deßourbon
said.
Zaccaro replied "no comment" Saturday when a
reporter went to his home to ask him about possible in
dictments.
One involved the alleged falsified sales contract; the

other, a loan from the credit union of the Port Authority
of New York and New Jersey, the newspaper said.
The latter involves a $550,000 loan by the credit union
in 19K3 to John DeLorenzo, a real estate investor who is
not a credit union member and therefore ineligible to bor
row money from it. according to federal auditors.
DeLorenzo reportedly got the money to buy a building in
a sale that Zaccaro co-brokered with the credit union's
lawyer.
DeLorenzo used the funds to purchase an apartment
building that he later hired Zaccaro's company to manage.
After a federal examiner ruled the loan illegal,
Del.orenzo repaid it.the newspaper said.
Surgery for Justice Powell
WASHINGTON — Supreme Court Justice Lewis
Powell Jr. underwent surgery for prostate cancer Friday in
a Minnesota hospital and was reported in fair condition.
Powell, at 77 the third oldest member of the court, is
expected to be hospitalized for 10 to 14 days and to return
to his duties on the bench in February, a court spokes
woman said.
"The prognosis is excellent," Toni House, the court's
public information officer, said.
A court announcement said that the cancer was dis
covered at a recent routine physical checkup. Powell, ac
companied by his wife, Josephine, underwent tests
Thursday and was operated on Friday at Rochester,
Minn., Methodist Hospital.
The surgery was performed by Dr. David Utz, a
urological surgeon at the Mayo Clinic, which is affiliated
with the hospital. A clinic spokesman said Friday night
that Powell was in fair condition following the operation.
Neither spokesmen for the court nor the clinic would
divulge further details of the justice's condition.
Powell, a successful corporate lawyer from Virginia and
a leader of the organized bar, was nominated to the court
in 1971 by President Nixon to succeed Justice Hugo
Black, who had resigned. Powell, 64 at the time, at first
had been reluctant to accept, wondering whether he was
too old to take on the assignment.
Police end airport ordeal
CLEVELAND — A woman who tried to commandeer
a jetliner kept her gun trained on her hostages and said
little before being shot by police, who stormed the plane
to end the 6 1/2-hour ordeal, passengers said Saturday.
"The gun was always at our faces," said Bonnie Ester
quest, 75, one of the last four hostages aboard the Pan
American Airways Boeing 727 on Friday. "She was to
tally uncompassionate."
The assailant took control of Flight 558 bound for New
York about 3 p.m. Friday and took seven hostages after
shooting an attendant at a boarding gate.
She released three hostages about two hours into the
ordeal, and police stormed the plane after she threatened
to harm an 8-month-old baby. One of her bullets hit an
officer but did not seriously injure him because of his
bullet-proof vest.
Oranette Mays, 42, of Cleveland, was shot in the chest
by SWAT officers from the FBI and Cleveland police to
end the standoff, said John Dunn, an FBI spokesman.
Mays was in stable condition Saturday at Cleveland
Metropolitan General Hospital after surgery, the hospital
said. No charges had been filed against her, Dunn said.
*'She continually pointed the gun at us," said Frank Es
terquest, 75, at a news conference given by police and the

hostages. "She was rather impassive all the way through.
She didn't say much more than 'No' the whole time."
New trial for von Bulow
PROVIDENCE. R.I. — Claus von Bulow. the Danish
born socialite whose conviction on charges of trying to
murder his heiress wife was overturned last year, will be
retried, Rhode Island's attorney general announced Sat
urday.
Arlene Violet, a former nun who took office just five
days ago, said she reviewed the original trial as well as
new evidence submitted by defense lawyers and con
cluded that "there is sufficient probative evidence which,
if believed by a jury, would result in conviction."
In announcing her decision. Violet criticized Alan Der
showitz, a Harvard law professor and a key von Bulow
defense attorney, for comments he made Friday about the
case. She threatened to try to have him removed from the
case if he continued.
The new trial is scheduled to begin April 2 in Newport.
Von Bulow, a New York City financier, was convicted
in March 1982 on two counts of trying to kill his wife.
Martha "Sunny" von Bulow. so he could marry his
mistress, former soap opera star Alexandra Isles, the
conviction was overturned last year by the Rhode Island
Supreme Court.
Martha von Bulow, 53, heiress to a Pittsburgh utilities
fortune worth more than $34 million, entered what doc
tors call an irreversible coma during the 1980 Christmas
holiday at Clarendon Court, the couple's Newport home.
She remains in a New York hospital.
The state contended that von Bulow induced the coma
by giving his wife insulin injections. She suffers from
hypoglycemia, a condition that would be aggravated by
insulin.
Soviets apologize to Finns
HELSINKI. Finland — The Soviet Union apologized to
Finland Friday for the possible intrusion into Finnish
airspace for what was reportedly to have been a cruise
missile that misfired, the Foreign Ministry announced.
A brief communique said that the Soviet Ambassador
in Helsinki, V.M. Sobolev, had apologized at a meeting
with Finnish Foreign Minister Paavo Vaeyrynen.
The ministry said the ambassador told Vaeyrynen that a
"flying target" veered off course during a military shoot
ing exercise in the Barents Sea on Dec. 28 because of a
technical fault.
Sobolev said it was possible that the object violated Fin
land's air space and expressed his government's regrets
over the incident, the communique said.
The Finnish government had earlier asked the Soviet
Union for a clarification of the incident, disclosed by Nor
wegian authorities Wednesday.
Finland is neutral and has a friendship pact with the So
viet Union.
Norway had said that it tracked a Soviet cruise missile,
probably fired from a submarine, as it crossed Norwegian
airspace and disappeared over Lake Inari in the north of
Finland.
Finnish border guards searched for wreckage in tem
peratures dipping to 20 degrees below zero in an area of
almost permanent winter darkness.
Finnish Border guard sources discounted the Nor
wegian analysis that concluded the object had been a
cruise missile.
