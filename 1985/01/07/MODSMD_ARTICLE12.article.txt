The eyes of the world have turned to Geneva.
One thousand journalists from around the world
will he in attendance. ABC, NBC and CBS will
all broadcast live from there. Most American
newspapers have previewed the event with front
page headlines.
What's going on? Is a major peace treaty about
to be signed? Has a world leader been assas
sinated? Has a nuclear exchange taken place?
No, Secretary of State George Shultz is meeting
with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko to
begin arms control talks. They are not signing any
treaties. They are not even close to reaching an
agreement. They are simply sitting down and
talking. It's about time.
The fact that the simple act of meeting has
generated such media attention is a sad commen
tary on the state of U.S.-Soviet relations. This is
the first time in 13 months that the two sides will
conduct serious negotiations.
We applaud the fact that the talks are occur
ring, but we don't understand why there haven't
been talks all along. The inflammatory rhetoric,
the fact that President Reagan has never met his
Soviet counterpart and the unprecedented mili

tary buildup, all indicate that the Reagan admin
istration has not been serious about arms control.
We hope that the talks today and tomorrow sig
nify a change in direction.
One encouraging sign is the composition of the
American delegation. The intransigent con
servatives have been left home. Shultz represents
the more realistic and pragmatic wing of the ad
ministration. We hope he will not be shackled by
ideology and will be able to get about the busi
ness of pursuing peace.
Along with the excessive media hype comes a
heightened sense of expectation. We should be
wary, however, and not expect anything sub
stantive to come out of this round of talks. The
best that we can realistically hope for is an agree
ment to meet and talk more. Perhaps such
meetings may even become commonplace.
After four years of name calling by both sides,
American and Soviet leaders have matured to the
level where they can sit down and talk like
reasonable adults. Now they must act like world
leaders and take concrete steps to eliminate the
threat of the destruction of the human race.
