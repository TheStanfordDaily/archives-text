## Institutional politics and arms negotiations 
### 
Today is the first day of talks on nuclear
arms control between Secretary of State
George Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister
Andrei Gromyko. Labeled as agenda-setting
sessions, these talks have been the subject of
widespread speculation, and have once again
brought to the fore questions about the
Reagan administration stance on arms con
trol. After four years of evil empire rhetoric
and an enormous nuclear weapons buildup,
has this administration changed its mind?
President Reagan wants arms control. He
wants it politically, and he may want it per
sonally as well. But Reagan is committed to
"fair" arms control, and his definition of what
is fair is quite different from previous presi
dents'. Reagan says previous accords
amounted to little more than American
sanctioning of a Soviet nuclear buildup.
Also, Reagan may be seeking arms control
as a means of salvaging the MX missile. In a
strange twist of nuclear politics, arms control
has become a bargaining chip for the MX,
whereas originally the MX was supposed to
be a bargaining chip for arms control. Unfor
tunately, even an apparent move on the part
of this administration vis a vis the Soviets may
save the MX in Congress this spring. Reagan's
enthusiasm for talks may be enthusiasm for
the MX in disguise.
But even with a presidential commitment to
a U.S.-Soviet arms treaty, whatever Reagan's
reasons, several institutional factors leave the

impression that prospects for a successful ac
cord are slim. While Reagan himself may
have shifted positions on Soviet relations (at
least publicly), his closest national security
advisers are hardly united behind him in sup
port of the upcoming talks.
The tension between Shultz and Secretary
of Defense Caspar Weinberger has been con-

sistent and appears to have intensified over
the issue of arms talks. The decision to forego
the creation of an arms control "czar" may
well have resulted from the various depart
ments' fear of relinquishing their influence.
Similarly, Paul Nitze's appointment as special
adviser to Shultz for the talks was an out

growth of the Defense Department's unwill
ingness to let Shultz gain too much control of
the process. In the words of one Pentagon of
ficial, "The State Department may be too
anxious for an agreement." In other words,
the Pentagon thinks State might give away the
store, and Nitze is supposed to prevent that.
Nitze's appointment as adviser doesn't ap
pear to have had much of a unifying effect,
however. Although The New York Times re
ported that Nitze is respected hy both liberals
and conservatives, he is clearly embraced
most warmly by hardliners. Nitze was one of
the leading critics of the SALT II treaty. Yet
Nitze has already announced that he will not
serve in any capacity other than as adviser to
Shultz in Geneva. Apparently, there are sig
nificant disagreements even among the hawk
ish powers that be.
Nitze's appointment also leaves the fate of
the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency
and its director, Kenneth Adelman, in a state
of flux. Historically the most pro-arms control
agency, ACDA appears to have been all but
frozen out of the prqpess this time around.
Another highly influential player in the
Shultz-Burt-Weinberger-Nitze-McFarlane
circle is the Pentagon's International Security
Affairs director, Richard Perle. Former na
tional security adviser to the hawkish late
Senator Henry "Scoop" Jackson, Perle is an
outspoken critic of any arms talks with the
Soviets, and he continues to play a key role in

U.S. national security policies.
So while the president may be committed to
arms talks, and even an arms treaty with the
Soviet Union, his closest advisers are far from
united in their opinion on how to approach
talks, or even if talks should be approached.
Institutional maneuvering seemed intense as
the talks approached. It is hard to envision

Reagan's closest na
tional security advisers
are hardly united be
hind him in support of
the upcoming talks.

any treaty or agenda that will be acceptable to
a majority of Reagan's inner circle and the
Soviet Union. In an administration like this
one — where the president himself so openly
relies on aides to advise him on the course of
nuclear relations — the disharmony within
the cabinet casts a significant shadow of doubt

over the prospects for successful negotiations.
The issue of space weapons, the so-called
Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI). or "Star
Wars" proposal, looks to he the first (perhaps
insurmountable) stumbling block in Geneva.
The Soviets have stated repeatedly that the
control of weapons in space is a prerequisite
for talks on strategic and theater nuclear
weapons. Initially, Shultz said all systems and
issues, including SDI. would be on the table in
Geneva. Since then, however, we've seen an
apparent hardliner victory. Weinberger said
last week on "This Week With David
Brinkley" that the administration "does not
feel [negotiating space defenses] is the way to
go," and that they hold out too much hope to
be limited in U.S.-Soviet talks. McFarlane
made similar statements last week, denying
that Reagan is willing to "trade" "Star Wars"
for limits on earth-based weapons.
With such major differences in U.S. and
Soviet approaches to even the agenda setting
sessions in Geneva, with the enormous influ
ence cabinet hawks appear to have over U.S.
policy and with the apparent infighting
among moderate and conservative U.S. offi
cials involved, it is unlikely that arms talks
with the Soviet Union will get very far very
fast.

Today is the first day of talks on nuclear
arms control between Secretary of State
George Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister
Andrei Gromyko. Labeled as agenda-setting
sessions, these talks have been the subject of
widespread speculation, and have once again
brought to the fore questions about the
Reagan administration stance on arms con
trol. After four years of evil empire rhetoric
and an enormous nuclear weapons buildup,
has this administration changed its mind?
President Reagan wants arms control. He
wants it politically, and he may want it per
sonally as well. But Reagan is committed to
"fair" arms control, and his definition of what
is fair is quite different from previous presi
dents'. Reagan says previous accords
amounted to little more than American
sanctioning of a Soviet nuclear buildup.
Also, Reagan may be seeking arms control
as a means of salvaging the MX missile. In a
strange twist of nuclear politics, arms control
has become a bargaining chip for the MX,
whereas originally the MX was supposed to
be a bargaining chip for arms control. Unfor
tunately, even an apparent move on the part
of this administration vis a vis the Soviets may
save the MX in Congress this spring. Reagan's
enthusiasm for talks may be enthusiasm for
the MX in disguise.
But even with a presidential commitment to
a U.S.-Soviet arms treaty, whatever Reagan's
reasons, several institutional factors leave the

impression that prospects for a successful ac
cord are slim. While Reagan himself may
have shifted positions on Soviet relations (at
least publicly), his closest national security
advisers are hardly united behind him in sup
port of the upcoming talks.
The tension between Shultz and Secretary
of Defense Caspar Weinberger has been con-

sistent and appears to have intensified over
the issue of arms talks. The decision to forego
the creation of an arms control "czar" may
well have resulted from the various depart
ments' fear of relinquishing their influence.
Similarly, Paul Nitze's appointment as special
adviser to Shultz for the talks was an out

growth of the Defense Department's unwill
ingness to let Shultz gain too much control of
the process. In the words of one Pentagon of
ficial, "The State Department may be too
anxious for an agreement." In other words,
the Pentagon thinks State might give away the
store, and Nitze is supposed to prevent that.
Nitze's appointment as adviser doesn't ap
pear to have had much of a unifying effect,
however. Although The New York Times re
ported that Nitze is respected hy both liberals
and conservatives, he is clearly embraced
most warmly by hardliners. Nitze was one of
the leading critics of the SALT II treaty. Yet
Nitze has already announced that he will not
serve in any capacity other than as adviser to
Shultz in Geneva. Apparently, there are sig
nificant disagreements even among the hawk
ish powers that be.
Nitze's appointment also leaves the fate of
the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency
and its director, Kenneth Adelman, in a state
of flux. Historically the most pro-arms control
agency, ACDA appears to have been all but
frozen out of the prqpess this time around.
Another highly influential player in the
Shultz-Burt-Weinberger-Nitze-McFarlane
circle is the Pentagon's International Security
Affairs director, Richard Perle. Former na
tional security adviser to the hawkish late
Senator Henry "Scoop" Jackson, Perle is an
outspoken critic of any arms talks with the
Soviets, and he continues to play a key role in

U.S. national security policies.
So while the president may be committed to
arms talks, and even an arms treaty with the
Soviet Union, his closest advisers are far from
united in their opinion on how to approach
talks, or even if talks should be approached.
