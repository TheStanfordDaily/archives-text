In the public interest
In David Lempert's viewpoint
entitled "Stanford vs. the public
interest," (The Daily, Dec. 5), the
author suggests that Stanford must
take "appropriate action" with
respect to Prof. John Kaplan's possi
ble "immoral conduct" in filing a
libel suit against Newsweek maga
zine.
Just who the hell does Lempert
think he is? What gives him the right
to determine that Kaplan's claim
"has little apparent merit" and is
motivated by "greed and revenge"?
This is a question for the courts, not

the University or a JD/MBA student,
to decide.
Lempert has apparently deter
mined that Kaplan's reputation has
not been harmed by the false state
ments published in Newsweek. As
evidence of this proposition he cites
the fact that Kaplan is visiting at
Harvard Law School this year. Some
people might find this fact persuasive
evidence in Kaplan's favor.
Moreover, the fact remains that
every person who believes he has
been wronged by false publications
has a right to clear his name in court.
This right is not diminished when the
wronged party happens to be a Stan

ford professor.
Finally, Lempert claims that
Kaplan's suit "tarnishes the degree
of every Stanford law graduate, hurts
the national reputation of the school,
violates the public trust and shatters
faith in our democratic institutions."
Come on!
I for one find it refreshing that a
professor is willing to stand up for
his reputation and defend himself
against a national publication. Our
democratic institutions will survive,
and 1 won't find my degree tarnished
in the least.
