## A 						systems approach to highlighting 
### 
Last month, the East Memorial lectures on
Morality, Student Conduct and Student Destiny
were given by the eminent Dr. Ernest Mocks, who
has been director of the Centre for Classical High
lighting at Harvard for 25 years. Although these
lectures ordinarily deal with philosophical prob-

lems. this year the hoard of trustees and the presi
dent preferred a less-filling lecture of "Life" phil
osophy. i.e. literary criticism.
Yet Mocks is the acknowledged world leader in
the field of highlighting. His classic book, "Critical
Highlighting: A Systems Approach." established
the discipline of highlighting and became the staple
for a generation of Harvard freshmen, who en
rolled in the "Highlighting Great Books" freshman
seminar. This course initiated the now common
model of reading the "Great Books" with particu
lar concern for writing papers defending why the
student "highlighted" specific regions of the text.
The series of four lectures entitled "Highlighting
Interpretations" were tepidly received, and the
speaker dispatched the back rows with methodical
celerity.
The first two lectures traced the history of high
lighting. explaining how emphasis derived mainly
from speech patterns and then progressed to crude
changes in spacing with the spread of writing.
Mocks brilliantly portrayed the invention and dif
fusion of emphasis by letter size, underlining,
capitalization, holding, italics and eventually high
lighting. The most novel issue of the first two
lectures deait with the new movement called
"speed-highlighting." which combines speedread
ing. highlighting and minimalism.
For several years, highlight researchers have
known 1) that many students were highlighting
whole pages and as a result the students had diffi
culty reviewing the highlinhted material, and 2)

that minimal highlighting was highly efficacious.
The breakthrough creating speed-highlighting
came from a student of Mocks, who was ex
perimenting with various shades of highlighter and
its effects on reading comprehension and speed. In
a moment of clairvoyance, she used a dark black
highlighter as a pacer for reading speed and
proceeded to highlight everything she didn't think
was important at 1,200 words per minute. The
results have been spectacular, and students now
can leisurely review the few non-highlighted areas.
The third lecture, titled "The Psychology of
Highlighting," presented a summary of highlighting
"styles" and shade preferences (Yellow still
dominates the market). Mocks described his early
work on self-esteem and highlighting, proposing

Usually, highlighting is a
daily prerequisite for
adequate functioning.

the once radical theory that highlighting provides
students with a feeling of mastery and adequacy.
He quoted one economics student saying.
"Highlighting is my only proof that I read — or at
least turned the pages of those books."
A more serious issue for Mocks is the behavioral
disorder he defined, namely highlighting depen
dence. This disorder tends to afflict prosperous,
well-educated, college-age students. Usually, hitih

lighting is a daily prerequisite for adequate func
tioning. but occasionally the individual will go on
binges of highlighting. The dependency begins with
casual underlining, often provoked by review
books and anxiety, and progresses with insidious
onset of pathological highlighting. Some warning
signs of pathological underlining include highlight
ing notes from parents, directions on laundry deter
gent boxes, album jacket covers and Sunday comic
strips. While the prognosis remains bleak for most
addicts, several palliative treatments were des
cribed.
The last lecture in the series was titled "Current
Perspectives in Highlighting." Mocks poignantly
presented the position of the Committee Against
Torture to Highlighters. This group believes that
highlighters are the reincarnation of deprived yel
low legal pads, the untouchable caste of stationary.
The committee objects to the premature death and
suffering of millions of highlighters from people
gnawing on their caps and wantonly letting them
dry out.
Will books of the future come highlighted?
Mocks expects that future textbooks will come on
floppy discs, enabling the student to select the level
of highlighting. He suggested three levels of high
lighting — genius/ "sponge" (no highlighting),
smart (mild), and compulsive (severe highlighting).
Second editions of texts will provide a statistical
package of cumulative highlighting from professors
using the text, and the student could choose to
highlight a designated percentage of the most fre
quently highlighted lines.
Mocks concluded his desultory lectures by re
turning to the paradox of "Why we highlight": "If
the ideas or facts were really important, we would
not need to highlight them. We would just remem
ber."
