# Library site: still waiting
## 
### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
"It was too much in too Uttle time."
That's the way Bob Freelen, vice
president for public affairs, explained
the Stanford Board of Trustees' deci
sion not to make a decision on a site
for the Ronald Reagan Presidential
Library.
Freelen, chairman of the Reagan
Librar. Planning Committee, had ex
pected the board to review the three
sites proposed by his committee and
make a recommendation to the White

House. But the trustee Committee on
Academic Affairs and Development,
faced with a heavy agenda at its
December meeting, felt "45 minutes
was simply not enough time for such
an important decision," according to
board President William Kimball.
Kimball defended the trustee com
mittee's decision to postpone any ac
tion, saying the library site selection is
"very permanent" and "has to be ex
tremely well thought out."
"We have to realize this is one of
the most permanent installations

Stanford will commit; itself to," he
said after the
meeting.
Both Kimball and Freelen denied
that the board was attempting to im
pede the construction of the library.
The board of trustees approved the
Reagan library, and a modest
museum, last February.
Freelen presented 20 potential
sites to the trustee committee,
showed slides of the three recom

mended sites and reviewed the
protests lodged against each of these
three.
The committee will probably dis
cuss the matter in more detail at next
month's meeting and make a recom
mendation to the full board.
The Reagan Library Planning
Committee recommends the Junipero
Serra site, in the foothills just oppo
site Lake Lagunita, as the top choice.
The Alpine Road site, near Interstate
280 and Ladera, ranks second, and
the Deer Creek site, near the inter
section of Page Mill and Deer Creek

Roads, is rated third by the commit
tee.
Freelen said he spoke after the
meeting with Martin Anderson,
senior fellow at the Hoover Institu
tion and Reagan's Stanford liaison for
library decisions, to reassure him that
the failure to recommend any sites
was "not a delaying tactic."
