## UCLA comes back to win women's volleyball title Golden hopes turn into the blues 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
Most teams only dream of finishing
in second place in the NCAA Divi
sion I women's volleyball tourna
ment.
Stanford, in its best season ever,
achieved that end on December 16 at
UCLA's Pauley Pavilion. The Card
inal came in second in the Final Four
tournament behind the UCLA Bruins
and ahead of the University of the
Pacific and San Jose State University.
What hurts is the prospect of what
Stanford could have been — and
many believe should have been: No.
1.
UCLA, seeded No. 2, upset top
seeded Stanford in a two-hour, 30-
minute, five-game match. The Bruins
won in the fifth game, 15-13.
What hurts even more is the fact
that Stanford held and lost a nine
point lead in the fifth game. The
Cardinal was ahead, 11-2 and 12-4.
The loss ended a season for Stan
ford that included its first Western
Collegiate Athletic Association title,
the naming of Kim Oden as WCAA
Player of the Year and Coach Fred
Sturm WCAA Co-Coach of the Year,
and the top seed in the National Col
legiate Athletic Association tourna
ment.
Stanford's lead in the match and
apparent national title was lost, ac
cording to Sturm, due to inescapable
human nature.
"It's a very natural feeling. Put
yourself in the players' shoes . . .
ahead 12-4. You begin to put wanting
to win ahead of execution." The
result was unforced errors by Stan
ford and a shrinking lead.
With Stanford ahead 13-9, frustra
tion showed for the first time on
middle hitter Kim Oden's face after
she and freshman setter Wendi Rush
collided while going for an easily
playable ball at midcourt.
UCLA, led by outside hitter Liz
Masakayan and middle blocker
Merja Connolly, and backed by a
home crowd of 5,000, became in
creasingly aggressive. Seven con
secutive side outs slowed down the
game, however, at 13-12 and it ap
peared Stanford had a chance to turn
the tide and hold off UCLA.
The Bruins got the ball on a wide

serve by Stanford's Teresa Smith.
UCLA sped up play and quickly won
the next two points on a missed spike
attempt by Rush and a crosscourt
spike by Masakayan.
"I was scared (down 12-4),"
Masakayan said. "We just had to
believe in ourselves. We reminded

ourselves of our comeback from 10-
14 last time." That comeback came in
November against Stanford in the
first-round match of the Wendy's
Classic Tournament that also went
five games, UCLA winning the fifth
game 16-14.
"It must be a given that we'll win in

five against Stanford," Head Coach
Andy Banachowski said. "1 can't ex
plain it, but I'll take it."
Banachowski cited the value of the
home crowd. "The crowd helped a lot
. . . I can't believe the energy that was
out there on the court. The fans were
great. Everybody got to see a lot of

excellent volleyball."
According to Stanford setter
Deidra Dvorak, the Cardinal's
"biggest problem was us. not the
Bruin players or crowd. "We were
hurrying everything up. It was
frustrating." she said.
Sturm agreed. "We were trying too
hard. It requires experience. It re
quires patience (to handle UCLA s
comeback)."
Perhaps Stanford was ready tor a
repeat of its first Final Four match on
December 14 against UOP. which
advanced the Cardinal to the title
game against UCLA. In a little over
an hour, the Cardinal advanced to the
finals over a fourth-seeded I iger
squad Sturm said should have been
seeded No. 1 or No. 2 in the tourna
ment.
Stanford has beaten UOP in the
last three NCAA tournaments. I he
Cardinal beat UOP last season in the
third-place match and took the ligers
out of the tournament in l l )N2 in the
Southern regional.
UOP Coach Taras Liskevych. who
retires this season to become the na
tional women's team coach, said his
team did not play emotionally.
"We didn't execute except in the
first six points (UOP took a 6-0 lead
in the first game but lost 15-1 1), and
a little bit toward the end of the last
game. . . . Toward the end, we were
stuffing people and jumping up and
down. We needed that all through the
match," Liskevych said.
Sturm said UOP did not have its
usual spectacular evening, but he
credited Stanford with quick transi
tions and consistent outside hitting.
"Things we stress in a match in
clude dictating the tempo. I think
Stanford dictating the action moved
them out of their comfort zone. UOP
was off but somewhere Stanford did
something," he said.
The "critical play" in the first
game, and possibly in the match, as
described by Liskevych came at 10-9,
UOP. Rush's spike was called wide,
but the head referee overruled the
call and gave Stanford the ball. Stan
ford. which had earlier been behind
6-0, then scored two points to take
the lead.
"We never got in a groove," UOP
setter Jan Saunders said. "I know 1

never got in my groove anyway. Once
we lo>t that lead, we never got back in
our rhythm. ... Gosh, we were so
ready (to win the championship). Wo
wanted it so had. We're emotional
now. but we weren't out there."
UOP was a strong favorite to reach
the finals because it won the Wendy'.,
Classic and the National Invitational
Volleyball Tournament this season.
In addition. Uskevych's players prob
ably would have liked to give I.is.
kevych a collegiate volleyball cham
pionship as a going-away present
before he takes his new coaching pos
tion.
Instead, UOP took third by beating
the surprise visitor to the Final Four.
San Jose State, in tour games. "We've
always had a hard time getting third,"
I.iskevych said. UOP gave up 4.1
points to the Spartans in the match.
"It was a tough match to play when
our designs were for a national cham
pionship." Uskevych said.
Since the NCAA established the
Final Four tournament in 1981, UOP
has never reached the finals but has
played in the consolation match three
of four years.
San Jose defeated the NCAA No. }
seed, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, in
the Northwest region finals. There
were no other major upsets in
regional play. UCLA easily won the
Southern region, UOP beat the Uni
versity of Nebraska in the Mideast
region, and Stanford beat the Univer
sity of Southern California for the
Western region championship.
You're right if USC sounds like a
tougher opponent than Nebraska or
the University of Texas (UCLA's op
ponent). Both Sturm and USC's
Chuck Erbe said the meeting be
tween these two teams should have
been in the Final Four.
Sturm called the match "the best of
the year" — from Stanford's view
point. The Cardinal came back from a
2-0 deficit to win. 11-15, 14-16, 15-
9, 15-9, 15-10.
Stanford held a 14-10 lead in the
second game, but USC scored six
points to win. The string followed a
net call on Oden which she disputed
personally — something that rarely
happens.
