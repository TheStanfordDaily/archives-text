# Card's unorthodox style kept others off balance

### VIRGINIA PEARSON 
Staff sportswriler
Taras Liskevych, who retires after
nine years as the University of the
Pacific's women's volleyball coach to
become coach of the national team,
called Stanford "the most unortho
dox team you can play," after the
sweep his Tigers suffered in the semi
final match of the Final Four tourna
ment Dec. 14.
Unorthodox, yes. But effective?
Yes again.
Stanford must be doing something
right to have finished second in the
country, and according to Liskevych,
that something is hitting well from
the outside positions.
"The outside hitters hit so late
they're difficult to block," Liskevych
said. "Their key wasn't (Kim) Oden.
It was Susan Compton from the
outside."
Rarely will an opposing coach play
down the presence of Oden at the
net. The season and tournament
honors Oden has received this year
alone are more than impressive. But
here, Compton and Stanford's other
outside hitters, including sophomore
Barbra Fontana. got much of the
credit for a match that put the Card
inal in the finals for the first time.
According to Stanford Asst. Coach
Don Shaw, what Stanford has been
missing and what might have helped
put them over the hump this season is
a strong outside attack.
"In the past, we've lacked consis
tency from our outside hitter." Shaw
said. "But with Compton and Fon
tana. we have two outstanding
players in that position."
Compton. a senior from San Diego,
summed up Stanford's outside hitting
as a "very, very stable element" on
the team. "We always were able to
come through. We are not the
glamour part, but we do our job." sHfe
said.
Compton did more than her job in
the final match of the Western
regional, against the University of
Southern California. She had two
season bests, in kills. 27. and digs. 23.
in that match.
Stanford defeated USC in five
games after losing the first two. In the
fifth game. Stanford relied heavily on
outside hitting. Compton hit four
consecutive kills midway through the
game to give Stanford a 9-5 lead and
break a 5-5 tie.
Setter Wtndi Rush said Stanford
switched its offense more to the
outside because. "USC was commit
ting themselves to the middle
(hitters)."
Several teams have been caught
guarding Stanford's "bin" middle

players, Oden and Bobbie Broer.
And for a good reason. There is no
denying Oden's value to the team this
season. As of the Final Four champi
onship. she had hit better than .300 in
16 of Stanford's 23 matches. In those
matches, the Cardinal was 15-1.
Stanford is 4-3 when Oden has hit
under .300. Oden has also hit over
.400 in 13 matches and over .500
seven times.
Stanford's main strength is un
doubtedly in these players, and the
Cardinal is primarily a team known
for its middle attack. However, in the

playoffs Compton, Fontana, and
freshman hitter Teresa Smith proved
the need for a balanced offense.
Smith came in midway in the third
game of the match against USC.
Stanford wasted no time in setting for
her, and she hit two consecutive kills.
"We put [Smith] in as a change of
pace — a little something different
for SC to look at," Shaw said. "I
don't think it was a risk. She did a
good job."
Smith, as a freshman, has gained

some early playoff experience. Al
though Compton will graduate, she
and sophomore Fontana still have
several years left to play for the Card
inal.
The experience Compton and Fon
tana have gained this season has
helped them become two of Stan
ford's smarter players. Fontana has
used her dink consistently and effec
tively over blocks, and Compton has
used down-the-line and offspeed
shots to keep Stanford's opponents
moving and guessing on defense.
"I am [smart] . . . but that just
comes with experience," Compton
said. If smartness and consistency is
what Stanford needed to win this
season, Compton and Fontana filled
the gap. And even though they say
they are not the "glamour part" of
the team, who is?
Stanford this season was a "down
to-work" team. Jumping up and
down and slapping hands was just not
their style. On the other side of the
spectrum, there was little complain
ing to referees.
Maybe the reserved image stems
from Sturm and Shaw, who seem to
prefer to do their job without a lot of
fuss and attention. But where do the
standards of a "fussy" team come
from? Take a look at UCLA.
The Bruins' top player, Liz
Masakayan, was given a yellow card
warning for unsportsmanlike conduct
in the fifth game against Stanford.
She got the warning after she
disputed a call and rapped the net.
The question remains as to whether
or not Stanford could do itself some
good by showing more anger or ela
tion in the course of a match.
Masakayan admitted she was "scared
to death" in that fifth game against
Stanford, her team behind by nine
points. But the call visibly made her
angry, she put some determination
behind her hits, and led her team to a
two-point victory.
Merja Connolly, a UCLA middle
blocker, is not one to hide her emo
tions either. Her shaking, clenched
fists and shouts let everyone know
when she scored a point. Connolly
had many kills to celebrate over— 22
in fact. She had a .264 hitting
percentage in the match.
The UCLA crowd seemed to
respond to its players showing so
much emotion. The noise level in
Pauley Pavilion during the last points

of the championship match was,
needless to say, high.
Stanford, on the other hand, has
had relative difficulty in attracting
large crowds to its home games. The
noise level in Maples rarely changes
except with the soft chants for
"Oden."
Perhaps the simple answer is that
flashy players and teams attract larger
crowds. It seems to be UCLA's
working principle, but not Stanford's.
UCLA is No. 1 and Stanford is No. 2,
but that is about as close as these two
teams get.
The Final Four All-Tournament
Team consisted of all Stanford and
UCLA players. Masakayan and Oden

were named to the team, but they are
not strangers to all-tournament
honors. Stanford's Broer and Com
pton were also named, as was
UCLA's Connolly and Michelle
Boyette. Boyette, a setter, had 11
kills in 23 attempts in the champion
ship match against Stanford for a
team-leading hitting percentage of
.391.
UCLA has been in the Final Four
14 of the last 16 years, and has been
in the championship game nine times,
winning four times in those appear
ances. Stanford was almost 1-0 in
championship matches but will have
to wait at least another year for the
No. 1 spot.

Stanford defeated USC in five
games after losing the first two. In the
fifth game. Stanford relied heavily on
outside hitting. Compton hit four

Setter Wtndi Rush said Stanford

Several teams have been caught
guarding Stanford's "bin" middle

players, Oden and Bobbie Broer.
And for a good reason. There is no
denying Oden's value to the team this
season. As of the Final Four champi
onship. she had hit better than .300 in
16 of Stanford's 23 matches. In those
matches, the Cardinal was 15-1.
Stanford is 4-3 when Oden has hit
under .300. Oden has also hit over
.400 in 13 matches and over .500
seven times.
Stanford's main strength is un
doubtedly in these players, and the
Cardinal is primarily a team known
for its middle attack. However, in the

playoffs Compton, Fontana, and
freshman hitter Teresa Smith proved
the need for a balanced offense.
Smith came in midway in the third
game of the match against USC.
Stanford wasted no time in setting for
her, and she hit two consecutive kills.
"We put [Smith] in as a change of
pace — a little something different
for SC to look at," Shaw said. "I
don't think it was a risk. She did a
good job."

some early playoff experience. Al
though Compton will graduate, she
and sophomore Fontana still have
several years left to play for the Card
inal.
The experience Compton and Fon
tana have gained this season has
helped them become two of Stan
ford's smarter players. Fontana has
used her dink consistently and effec
tively over blocks, and Compton has
used down-the-line and offspeed
shots to keep Stanford's opponents
moving and guessing on defense.
"I am [smart] . . . but that just
comes with experience," Compton
said. If smartness and consistency is
what Stanford needed to win this
season, Compton and Fontana filled
the gap. And even though they say
they are not the "glamour part" of
the team, who is?
Stanford this season was a "down
to-work" team. Jumping up and
down and slapping hands was just not
their style. On the other side of the
spectrum, there was little complain
ing to referees.
Maybe the reserved image stems
from Sturm and Shaw, who seem to
prefer to do their job without a lot of
fuss and attention. But where do the
standards of a "fussy" team come
from? Take a look at UCLA.
The Bruins' top player, Liz
Masakayan, was given a yellow card
warning for unsportsmanlike conduct
in the fifth game against Stanford.
She got the warning after she
disputed a call and rapped the net.
The question remains as to whether
or not Stanford could do itself some
good by showing more anger or ela
tion in the course of a match.
Masakayan admitted she was "scared
to death" in that fifth game against
Stanford, her team behind by nine
points. But the call visibly made her
angry, she put some determination
behind her hits, and led her team to a
two-point victory.
Merja Connolly, a UCLA middle
blocker, is not one to hide her emo
tions either. Her shaking, clenched
fists and shouts let everyone know
when she scored a point. Connolly
had many kills to celebrate over— 22
in fact. She had a .264 hitting
percentage in the match.
The UCLA crowd seemed to
respond to its players showing so
much emotion. The noise level in
Pauley Pavilion during the last points

of the championship match was,
needless to say, high.
Stanford, on the other hand, has
had relative difficulty in attracting
large crowds to its home games. The
noise level in Maples rarely changes
except with the soft chants for
"Oden."
Perhaps the simple answer is that
flashy players and teams attract larger
crowds. It seems to be UCLA's
working principle, but not Stanford's.
UCLA is No. 1 and Stanford is No. 2,
but that is about as close as these two
teams get.
The Final Four All-Tournament
Team consisted of all Stanford and
UCLA players. Masakayan and Oden

were named to the team, but they are
not strangers to all-tournament
honors. Stanford's Broer and Com
pton were also named, as was
UCLA's Connolly and Michelle
Boyette. Boyette, a setter, had 11
kills in 23 attempts in the champion
ship match against Stanford for a
team-leading hitting percentage of
.391.
UCLA has been in the Final Four
14 of the last 16 years, and has been
in the championship game nine times,
winning four times in those appear
ances. Stanford was almost 1-0 in
championship matches but will have
to wait at least another year for the
No. 1 spot.

Staff sportswriler
Taras Liskevych, who retires after
nine years as the University of the
Pacific's women's volleyball coach to
become coach of the national team,
called Stanford "the most unortho
dox team you can play," after the
sweep his Tigers suffered in the semi
final match of the Final Four tourna
ment Dec. 14.
Unorthodox, yes. But effective?
Yes again.
Stanford must be doing something
right to have finished second in the
country, and according to Liskevych,
that something is hitting well from
the outside positions.
"The outside hitters hit so late
they're difficult to block," Liskevych
said. "Their key wasn't (Kim) Oden.
It was Susan Compton from the
outside."
Rarely will an opposing coach play
down the presence of Oden at the
net. The season and tournament
honors Oden has received this year
alone are more than impressive. But
here, Compton and Stanford's other
outside hitters, including sophomore
Barbra Fontana. got much of the
credit for a match that put the Card
inal in the finals for the first time.
According to Stanford Asst. Coach
Don Shaw, what Stanford has been
missing and what might have helped
put them over the hump this season is
a strong outside attack.
"In the past, we've lacked consis
tency from our outside hitter." Shaw
said. "But with Compton and Fon
tana. we have two outstanding
players in that position."
