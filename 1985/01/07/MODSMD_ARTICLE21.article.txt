# Card's unorthodox style kept others off balance

Taras Liskevych, who retires after
nine years as the University of the
Pacific's women's volleyball coach to
become coach of the national team,
called Stanford "the most unortho
dox team you can play," after the
sweep his Tigers suffered in the semi
final match of the Final Four tourna
ment Dec. 14.
Unorthodox, yes. But effective?
Yes again.
Stanford must be doing something
right to have finished second in the
country, and according to Liskevych,
that something is hitting well from
the outside positions.
"The outside hitters hit so late
they're difficult to block," Liskevych
said. "Their key wasn't (Kim) Oden.
It was Susan Compton from the
outside."
Rarely will an opposing coach play
down the presence of Oden at the
net. The season and tournament
honors Oden has received this year
alone are more than impressive. But
here, Compton and Stanford's other
outside hitters, including sophomore
Barbra Fontana. got much of the
credit for a match that put the Card
inal in the finals for the first time.
According to Stanford Asst. Coach
Don Shaw, what Stanford has been
missing and what might have helped
put them over the hump this season is
a strong outside attack.
"In the past, we've lacked consis
tency from our outside hitter." Shaw
said. "But with Compton and Fon
tana. we have two outstanding
players in that position."
Compton. a senior from San Diego,
summed up Stanford's outside hitting
as a "very, very stable element" on
the team. "We always were able to
come through. We are not the
glamour part, but we do our job." sHfe
said.
Compton did more than her job in
the final match of the Western
regional, against the University of
Southern California. She had two
season bests, in kills. 27. and digs. 23.
in that match.
Stanford defeated USC in five
games after losing the first two. In the
fifth game. Stanford relied heavily on
outside hitting. Compton hit four
consecutive kills midway through the
game to give Stanford a 9-5 lead and
break a 5-5 tie.
Setter Wtndi Rush said Stanford
switched its offense more to the
outside because. "USC was commit
ting themselves to the middle
(hitters)."
Several teams have been caught
guarding Stanford's "bin" middle

players, Oden and Bobbie Broer.
And for a good reason. There is no
denying Oden's value to the team this
season. As of the Final Four champi
onship. she had hit better than .300 in
16 of Stanford's 23 matches. In those
matches, the Cardinal was 15-1.
Stanford is 4-3 when Oden has hit
under .300. Oden has also hit over
.400 in 13 matches and over .500
seven times.
Stanford's main strength is un
doubtedly in these players, and the
Cardinal is primarily a team known
for its middle attack. However, in the

playoffs Compton, Fontana, and
freshman hitter Teresa Smith proved
the need for a balanced offense.
Smith came in midway in the third
game of the match against USC.
Stanford wasted no time in setting for
her, and she hit two consecutive kills.
"We put [Smith] in as a change of
pace — a little something different
for SC to look at," Shaw said. "I
don't think it was a risk. She did a
good job."
Smith, as a freshman, has gained

Senior outside hitter Susan Compton was an integral part of Stanford's
offensive attack during the season. Despite the Cardinal's somewhat
unorthodox — but successful — style, its season ended in dejection.
