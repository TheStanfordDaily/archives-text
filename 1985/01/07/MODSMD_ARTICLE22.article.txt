WESTWOOD â€” UCLA middle blocker Merja
Connolly was brandishing her index fingers in front of
the television cameras like a pair of six-shooters, ack
nowledging the fact that her team had just won the
National Collegiate Athletic Association champion
ship and was now the undisputed No. 1 team in the
country.

Commentary

Along the sideline of the Pauley Pavilion court,
Stanford women's volleyball Coach Fred Sturm was
stoic, oblivious to the roar of the crowd and to the an
tics of Connolly and her teammates. But a little more
than a half hour before, Sturm might have been pictur
ing himself in a celebrating mood.
Because not only had the Cardinal lost, it was
literally gunned-down by the Bruins after it appeared
that the championship trophy was going to go home
with Sturm to Stanford.
First, however, Stanford had to get the trophy out of
the Bruins' home. In the fifth game, it looked as if that
was going to happen when the Cardinal took a 12-4
lead, needing only three more points to win. It got only
one as UCLA staged a tremendous comeback and won
15-13.
In most athletic events, such a loss is known as a
choke. Someone who didn't see this game and only
heard about it would easily come to that conclusion.
Make no mistake about it, Stanford did not play well
at the end of the match. But it didn't play poorly
enough to lose straight up to UCLA. What really hap

pened was that the Cardinal had only six players while
the Bruins had at least seven.
No, this wasn't some strange rule change to help
UCLA. No, the Cardinal didn't give the Bruins an ex
tra player just to make the match more challenging.
In fact, the Bruin's "seventh"' player never even
stepped on the court. T hat extra player never blocked
a shot, never dug a shot, never made a serve.
More than 4,000 fans attended the match. Of them,
the number of Stanford fans might have been outnum
bered by the 10 NCAA basketball championship ban
ners that hang from the rafters of Pauley. For the
Bruins, the advantage of playing at home was like
having an extra player.
"I couldn t believe the energy out there. So much of
it came from the fans," UCLA Coach Andy Banac
howski said.
As UCLA's comeback started, the noise of the
crowd grew steadily to the point where it was obvious
that Stanford was unnerved and distracted. As senior
setter Deidra Dvorak explained with a feeling of dis
belief in her voice. " I he crowd gets on your nerves."
Pauley became anything but a welcome place for the
visitors as Stanford s rushed play indicated. Unlike its
calm, business-as-usual style of play, the Cardinal
began to play as if it just wanted to get out of there as
fast as possible.
Unfortunately for Stanford, it was just like having to
sit through the neighbors vacation slide show; the
( ardinal couldn t just leave, it had to sit through every
excrutiating moment.
Certainly, you could argue that UCLA had an unfair
advantage. That it you played this game at some
neutral court, Stanford would have won. You probably
would be right.
However, the fact of the matter is that Stanford
knew well in advance playing in Pauley would be
rough. I he Cardinal just didn't make the right adjust
ments and let the championship get away.
