The Stanford men's basketball team returned
home Saturday night having learned a tough lesson
over the holiday: It's not easy to win on the road.
After opening the Pacific 10 Conference season
with losses to the University of Washington and
Washington State, the Cardinal is now 8-4 overall.
Stanford is 7-0 at Maples Pavilion and 1-4 on the
road.
On Saturday in Pullman, Wash., Stanford lost,
71-59, to Washington State in a game that was
closer than the score indicated. The Cardinal was
behind during most of the first half after spotting
the Cougars, now 10-2 overall and 2-0 in the Pac
-10, an 11-point lead.
But a 16-5 run to end the first half tied the game
at 31. Backup swingman John Paye led the Card
inal with 1 1 points in the half, but was shut down in
the second half and finished with 13.
In the second half, Stanford appeared to be
taking control of the game, albeit slowly. With just
less than 10 minutes remaining, the Cardinal led
55-50 and had rattled the Cougars' offense with its
frenzied style of pressing defense.
To add insult to injury, Washington State's start
ing point guard, Keith Morrison, had fouled out
just as Stanford took its five-point lead. Kitrick
Taylor replaced Morrison and it looked like the
Cardinal might be able to take advantage of the sit
uation.
At the beginning of the season, Taylor was an
athlete at Washington State, but he wasn't on the
basketball team. He was a red-shirted wide
receiver for the football team. But Taylor deftly
handled the Stanford press and scored on a fast
break layup to give the Cougars their first lead in
more than six minutes, 56-55.
But the disappearance of the Stanford offense
might have been more telltale. In the final ten
minutes, the Cardinal scored only two field goals.
Washington State was led by sophomore forward
Joe Wallace. Wallace entered the game as the Pac
10's leading scorer, averaging 20.7 points per game.

and did nothing to hurt his statistics, finishing with
28 points.
Wallace was able to get several open shots along
the baseline when the Cougars took leads and the
Cardinal u is forced to press upcourt. As Stanford
Coach lorn Davis explained, "We would have
liked to contain him more. But when we get behind
and have to put pressure on the guards, that allows
the baseline player more freedom."
The Cougars also got a career-high scoring ef
fort from 7-foot-1 center Todd Anderson. "We
were told that he had improved a lot, but he really
hurt us by being able to tip the ball several times
and keep it in play."
Anderson scored 15 points on 7-of-12 shooting
from the field, many of those shots coming from the
perimeter.
Washington State was supposed to be one of the
few teams in the Pac-10 that Stanford was
supposed to handle with relative ease. But the
Cougars, who have already equaled their number
of victories from last season, might have added
proof to Davis' point that playing on the road will
be very difficult during conference play.
"Most young teams will play like that. Being on
the road tends to be a problem without a whole lot
of experience," Davis said.
On Thursday in Seattle, Stanford not only had to
battle its own inexperience, but also had to contend
with an experienced and talented University of
Washington team. The 78-69 score seems closer
than the game actually was.
Stanford led only once, at 4-2, but then Wash
ington was able to wear down the Cardinal's pesky
pressure defense and take a 36-22 lead at halftime.
The story in the first 10 minutes of the second half
wasn't much different as the Huskies built up a 27-
point lead before putting in the subs and allowing
Stanford to make the result look respectable.
The Huskies, now 8-3 and 1-1 in the Pac-10
after losing to Oregon State on Saturday, weren't
exactly able to break down the Stanford press
easily, but once they got the ball down the court,
they were able to get easy inside baskets from 7-0
center Christian Welp and 6-9 forwards Paul For

tier and Detlef Schrempf.
They scored 24, 17 and 14 points respectively
and had 25 rebounds among them. Washington
outrebounded Stanford 47 to 30. As Davis put it
simply, "We got killed on the boards."
(5n offense, the Cardinal wasn't much better as it
made less than 45 percent of its shots, including less
than 35 percent in the first half. "We just couldn't
seem to get it done. We just missed the open
shots," Davis said.
"They forced us out of our offense," starting
guard Keith Ramee said. "We would rather work
the ball around, but we had to hurry when we got
behind." Novian Whitsitt led the Cardinal with 16
points, but shot an uncharacteristic 6of 16 from the
floor.
Whitsitt, a sophomore, has started to lead the
Cardinal's fairly balanced offensive attack and is
now averaging more than 13 points per game and is
shooting better than 50 percent from the field.
In other games over the holiday:
Dec. 29, Stanford 75, Army 60— In the consola
tion game of the Texas Long Horn Tournament at

Koberlein with 17 and Whitsitt with 15.
Dec. 28, Mercer College 90, Stanford 72 — The

led by Whitsitt with 16. Riverside
shot 31.9 percent from the floor.
Dec. 21, Stanford 67, Loyola
Marymount University 59 — This
game was much closer than the score
indicated. Stanford led 48-33 midway
through the second half. Then I.MU
guards Keith Smith and Steve Haney
got hot and closed it to four with a
minute left in the game.
I.MU had a chance to cut Stan
ford's lead to two. but Ramee inter
cepted a cross-court pass, was fouled,
and hit both free throws with 16
seconds remaining to give Stanford a
65-59 lead.
Smith, who is considered one of the
top guards on the West Coast,
finished with 25. equaling his
average. The Cardinal got career
high efforts from junior Andy Fischer
and senior Kent Seymour, who had
17 and 15 points, respectively.
Dec. 19, Stanford 83, Seattle Uni
versity 46 — Seattle was outmanned
to begin with, but they didn't play
with their top player. Rich Brooks,
and his 20 points per game.
Whitsitt scored a career-high 23
points, which also equaled Kober
lein's team-high for the season.
Freshman Greg Butler also scored a
career-high 13 points.
Dec. 18, St. Mary's 61, Stanford 56
(overtime) — A game that Stanford
could have and should have won in
regulation. Stanford had an eight
point lead in the first half, while St.
Mary's led only once during regula
tion.
But Stanford scored only one field
goal in the final 10 minutes of the
game and was two of six from the free
throw line down the stretch.
In the overtime, St. Mary's was
simply too much for Stanford.
Seymour and Fischer had fouled out,
and Koberlein was suffering with a
pulled groin muscle. Whitsitt scored
1 1 to lead the Cardinal while
Seymour and Fischer had 10 apiece.
