# Stanford hosts 60th Shrine game
## Veris, Harry lead West team 
### DAVE DUTCHER Daily staff 
The 60th Annual Shrine All-Star
Game was all that it was supposed to
be — pageantry and a chance for col
lege seniors to strut their stuff for
professional scouts.
And there was more for the esti
mated 72,000 people at Stanford
Stadium on Saturday. The represen
tatives of the host team contributed
greatly to the West's 21-10 victory,
which broke.a two-year East winning
streak.
First was the effort of Stanford de
fensive end Garin Veris, who was
voted the most valuable defensive
player. Veris, an All Pacific 10 Con
ference selection, had eight tackles : —
Brian Noble of Arizona State Univer
sity led the West with nine — and two
of his team's seven sacks.
On the other side of the ball. Card
inal receiver Emile Harry teamed
with West quarterbacks Rusty Hilger
of Oklahoma State University and of
fensive MVP Randall Cunningham of
the University of Nevada at Las
Vegas for 69 yards on seven recep
tions. Teammate Vance Johnson of
the University of Arizona also had
seven catches, for 59 yards.
Not to be overlooked was the play
of center Brent Martin, the Cardinal's
other first-team All Pac-10 represen
tative. Martin and the rest of the
West offensive line enabled the West
to outgain the East, 374-228 yards,

even though the East held possession
of the ball for almost three minutes
more than the West.
Martin and the West offense dem
onstrated one of the obstacles in all
star games — quickly having to get
accustomed to teammates. The West
fumbled two center snaps, the second
of which led to the East's first quarter
touchdown.
Martin snapped on the first fumble,
a fourth-down play that failed to gain
a first down, and Chris Martin of
Southern Methodist University was
the center during the West's second
fumble.
That turnover gave the East the
ball at the West's 23-yard line. Two
plays later, Steve Calabria of Colgate
University got the East to the one
with a looping pass down the left
sideline to Johnnie Jones of the Uni
versity of Tennessee, and Jones
scored on the next play. Jones had 40
of the East's 60 rushing yards on 13
carries.
"We knew we were going to try
and throw the ball and get into
seams," said East Coach Joe Restic,
Harvard University's coach. "When
we got a chance to stand in there and
throw the ball, we did a good job."
A 17-yard punt return by Harry set
up the West's first touchdown, which
tied the game, 7-7. Cunningham, who
threw for 186 yards on 18-of-29 pass

Senior Emile Harry caught seven passes for 69 yards to help lead the
West team to a2l -10 victory over the East in the 60th Shrine game Sat
urday.
ing, moved the West from the East's
43 to its 2. Then Johnson took a
pitch, as if to sweep right, stopped
and passed to Cunningham in the left
side of the end zone with 13 minutes,
23 seconds left in the first half.
Less than eight minutes later, with
Hilger at quarterback, the West took
the lead with an 83-yard, six-pass
drive. Hilger completed five of those:
one for 29 yards, one for 38 yards and
the final one a four-yarder to Larry
Willis of Fresno State University that
made the score 14-7 with 4:50 left in
the second quarter.
"Their defense was basic," Martin
said, noting another shortcoming of
all-star games. "You can't put too
much together in one week."
The East responded by driving 55
yards to the West 19 in four minutes,
but Ricky Anderson of Vanderbilt
University missed a 35-yard field goal
attempt 48 seconds before halftime.
It was Anderson's second consecutive
misss, the first coming from 49 yards
after the West's first touchdown.

Anderson did hit a field goal in the
third quarter, hut it seemed a let
down: It was the only East score fol
lowing two straight interceptions. The
first came when Johnson tried his
second pass. He had considerably less
luck — Jim Bowman of Central Mic
higan University intercepted for the
East. The ensuing drive ended in a
punt, but the West's next possession
consisted of one play — an intercep
tion. this time thrown by Hilger and
picked off by Richard Johnson of the
University of Wisconsin.
That put the East at the West's 25.
and the East had to settle for Ander
son's field goal, which made the score
14-10, after gaining seven yards on
three plays.
Cunningham, who said. "I can't
believe that I won this (MVP)
award," opened the fourth quarter by
leading the West 76 yards in 1 1 plays
for the final score, l ike the touch
down drive Hilger led. the West
moved via the pass, using only one
running play. Harry caught two of the
six passes for 27 yards en route to the
final score. It was 21-10 when Cun
ningham threw 15 yards to Terry Orr
of the University of Texas. Orr had a
game-high 48 yards rushing on 12

carries.
Although the final score came with
11:54 left in the game. Hilger was
confident.
"When we hit with the TD (in the
fourth quarter). I think it broke their
backs because they had to score two
touchdowns to win." he said.
Hilger was correct. Ihe West's
defense held the East to two firsi
downs until there was 4:02 left. Thi
East nearly scored from its 25 when
three completions gained 70 yards to
the West's 5. A play later from the 4
George Adams of the University of
Kentucky fumbled and Kevin Han
cock of Baylor University recovered
for the West.
In the fourth quarter, the West
sacked the East's Kurt Page, of Van
derbilt, three times, twice bv Jini
Herrmann of Brigham Young Uni
versity.
"1 think Garin Veris and Jim Herr
mann put good pressure on our
guys." said East Asst. Coach Foge
Fazio, the head coach at the Univer
sity of Pittsburgh. "It seemed like
every time we scrambled out of the
pocket, we didn't make anything hap
pen and they did."
