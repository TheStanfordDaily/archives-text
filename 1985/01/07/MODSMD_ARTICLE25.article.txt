# Stanford hosts 60th Shrine game
## Veris, Harry lead West team 
### DAVE DUTCHER Daily staff 
The 60th Annual Shrine All-Star
Game was all that it was supposed to
be — pageantry and a chance for col
lege seniors to strut their stuff for
professional scouts.
And there was more for the esti
mated 72,000 people at Stanford
Stadium on Saturday. The represen
tatives of the host team contributed
greatly to the West's 21-10 victory,
which broke.a two-year East winning
streak.
First was the effort of Stanford de
fensive end Garin Veris, who was
voted the most valuable defensive
player. Veris, an All Pacific 10 Con
ference selection, had eight tackles : —
Brian Noble of Arizona State Univer
sity led the West with nine — and two
of his team's seven sacks.
On the other side of the ball. Card
inal receiver Emile Harry teamed
with West quarterbacks Rusty Hilger
of Oklahoma State University and of
fensive MVP Randall Cunningham of
the University of Nevada at Las
Vegas for 69 yards on seven recep
tions. Teammate Vance Johnson of
the University of Arizona also had
seven catches, for 59 yards.
Not to be overlooked was the play
of center Brent Martin, the Cardinal's
other first-team All Pac-10 represen
tative. Martin and the rest of the
West offensive line enabled the West
to outgain the East, 374-228 yards,

even though the East held possession
of the ball for almost three minutes
more than the West.
Martin and the West offense dem
onstrated one of the obstacles in all
star games — quickly having to get
accustomed to teammates. The West
fumbled two center snaps, the second
of which led to the East's first quarter
touchdown.
Martin snapped on the first fumble,
a fourth-down play that failed to gain
a first down, and Chris Martin of
Southern Methodist University was
the center during the West's second
fumble.
That turnover gave the East the
ball at the West's 23-yard line. Two
plays later, Steve Calabria of Colgate
University got the East to the one
with a looping pass down the left
sideline to Johnnie Jones of the Uni
versity of Tennessee, and Jones
scored on the next play. Jones had 40
of the East's 60 rushing yards on 13
carries.
"We knew we were going to try
and throw the ball and get into
seams," said East Coach Joe Restic,
Harvard University's coach. "When
we got a chance to stand in there and
throw the ball, we did a good job."
A 17-yard punt return by Harry set
up the West's first touchdown, which
tied the game, 7-7. Cunningham, who
threw for 186 yards on 18-of-29 pass
