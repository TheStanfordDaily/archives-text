# Cardinal players hope for pro opportunity

### DAVE DUTCHER Daily staff 
For the three Stanford players
who competed in the 60th Annual
Shrine All-Star game Saturday
and, perhaps, the other Cardinals
who completed their eligibility,
there remains a waiting game re
garding their futures on the foot
ball field.
The bright side for receiver
Emile Harry, offensive lineman
Brent Martin and defensive
lineman Garin Veris is that they
probably played well enough Sat
urday to get attention from profes
sional scouts — if they needed it in
the first place.
Harry, Veris and Martin already
have been drafted — along with
linebacker Tom Briehl, kicker
Mark Harmon, defensive lineman
Terry Jackson and offensive
lineman Matt Moran — by the
Oakland Invaders of the United
States Football League. The Na
tional Football League's draft will
be held in April.
But being drafted by a team in

either professional football league
is only the beginning. Professional
teams are composed of about half
the players college squads are, and
even the better players sometimes
lose out because of the situation of
the team that drafts them.
Take, for instance, the case of
Mike Tolliver, who played his final
season for the Cardinal in 1983.
Tolliver was a choice of the NFL's
Dallas Cowboys. Although Tol
liver was the nation's leading
receiver at one point during his
final season hnd finished that year
ranked high in the Pacific 10 Con
ference, he did not make Dallas'
roster.
A Cowboys scout at the West's
21-10 Shrine game victory Satur
day said Tolliver might have been
the final receiver cut and was
"part of the numbers game."
Translation: The Cowboys already
had enough receivers, so Tolliver
was released.
It's safe to say that most — and
