# Cardinal players hope for pro opportunity
## 
### DAVE DUTCHER Daily staff 
For the three Stanford players
who competed in the 60th Annual
Shrine All-Star game Saturday
and, perhaps, the other Cardinals
who completed their eligibility,
there remains a waiting game re
garding their futures on the foot
ball field.
The bright side for receiver
Emile Harry, offensive lineman
Brent Martin and defensive
lineman Garin Veris is that they
probably played well enough Sat
urday to get attention from profes
sional scouts — if they needed it in
the first place.
Harry, Veris and Martin already
have been drafted — along with
linebacker Tom Briehl, kicker
Mark Harmon, defensive lineman
Terry Jackson and offensive
lineman Matt Moran — by the
Oakland Invaders of the United
States Football League. The Na
tional Football League's draft will
be held in April.
But being drafted by a team in

either professional football league
is only the beginning. Professional
teams are composed of about half
the players college squads are, and
even the better players sometimes
lose out because of the situation of
the team that drafts them.
Take, for instance, the case of
Mike Tolliver, who played his final
season for the Cardinal in 1983.
Tolliver was a choice of the NFL's
Dallas Cowboys. Although Tol
liver was the nation's leading
receiver at one point during his
final season hnd finished that year
ranked high in the Pacific 10 Con
ference, he did not make Dallas'
roster.
A Cowboys scout at the West's
21-10 Shrine game victory Satur
day said Tolliver might have been
the final receiver cut and was
"part of the numbers game."
Translation: The Cowboys already
had enough receivers, so Tolliver
was released.
It's safe to say that most — and
perhaps all — of the former Car
dinals who played Saturday will not
earn positions on the rosters of pro
fessional teams. Still, it's hard to
give up hope. Veris, Harry and
Martin appear to be in that cate
gory.
Martin, who quietly earned first
team All Pac-10 honors this season,
is equally as unobtrusive — but
confident — about playing profes
sionally.
"I have a good shot," the
bearded Martin said after peeling
off most of his uniform Saturday.

"A good showing in the Senior
Bowl (on Saturday in Mobile, Ala.)
will help." Martin also said
graduating is a high priority.
For Veris, where and for whom
are mere details. Quite simply,
Veris wants to continue playing.
"I definitely want to play profes
sional football." he said to a group
of reporters huddled around his
locker. "My first goal is to get
drafted and make a team. I don't
care who it is. I feel I can play and
contribute to a team."
Veris, who made eight tackles
and had two sacks, helped himself
by being named the most valuable
defensive player of the game Satur
day, something that surprised him.
"I couldn't believe it when I saw
it on the scoreboard."
Although Veris said it "was im

portant to play my last game here
well," he already felt confident
about his abilities. "I don't think I
had anything to prove," he said. "I
just went out and played like I was
taught."
Harry, however, might have
thought he had doubters.
"I proved I can catch the ball,"
he said. "I hope they look at me as
someone who can play in the NFL
and the USFL. Right now, I'm just
having fun."
Harry, whose 69 receiving yards
Saturday were the highest on the
West team, said he is leaving the
decision about how well he rates
against other receivers up to those
who make the recommendations
and decisions. "It's up to the
scouts," he said. "I'm not going to
worry about it."
