## 
### JOHN LIS Daily staff 
COLUMBUS, Ohio — While most students
spent the weekend after Christmas relaxing and
maybe catching a movie, the Stanford women's
basketball team was at the Buckeye Classic at St.
John's Arena here for a command performance of
"Welcome to the Top 20."
The results were as ugly as any "Halloween" se
quel, as the Cardinal lost to No. 9-ranked Ohio
State University. 79-47, Dec. 28 and No. 14-
ranked Rutgers. The State Universitv of New Jer
sey, 82-53, Dec. 29.
"It makes you realize what level we've got to
come up to in our recruiting," said Stanford Head
Coach Dotty McCrea. "We have three players
we're recruiting this year who could bring us up to
the level of a Top 50 team. We've got to put to
gether two good years (of recruiting)."
For about the first five minutes of the opener
against Ohio State, Stanford played like it was one
of those teams, staying even with the Buckeyes.
Then reality set in. OSU opened a 38-27 halftime
lead, then ran off a 19-4 spurt in the first nine
minutes of the second half to remove any doubt as
1,433 looked on.
"The first thing you have to realize is that Ohio
State is a very good team," McCrea said.
"Ouickness-wise, it's very hard for us to keep up
with them. A quick team like that wears us down.
"Our problem is we depend on people to play
well and we didn't get that. We'd have to play a
perfect game to win, but I'd feel better if we got
some good games."
The Cardinal also had difficulty with the
Buckeyes' press, which has held opponents to less
than 40 percent shooting from the field all season.
Stanford shot 37 percent on the night and commit
ted 25 turnovers. "We were looking for someone to
help 'V' (guard Virginia Sourlis) bring the ball up,
and they didn't," McCrea said.

Sourlis was the only Stanford player in double
figures. with 14. "We were expecting the press."
she said. "They were playing a run-and-jump. and
we have more experience against a trap." The fact
that Sourlis got little help in the backcourt didn't
make her job easier.
Against Ohio State, freshman forward Kami An
derson missed her first free throw of the season
after making her first 21 attempts as a collegian. "1
knew about the streak." she said afterward. "Now I
can relax and be myself."
Against Rutgers, the Cardinal played one good
half— the second. In the first 20 minutes, the Lady
Knights used a press against Stanford and opened a
44-21 advantage. The press was taken off in the
second half, and Rutgers outscored Stanford bv
only 38-32.
Cardinal forward Sue Sebolt said. "We were a
little more aggressive in the second half, but we
didn't have it all together. We were too tentative
the entire game."
Sourlis again led the Stanford scoring list with 16
points. Anderson was the only other Cardinal in
double figures, with 14.
Rutgers enjoyed a major size advantage over the
Cardinal inside, which resulted in a 49-23 rebound
ing edge for the Lady Knights. Describing Rutgers.
Sebolt said, "They're big, physical and weigh a
ton."
Stanford guard Erica Mueser said, "Whenever
we got it inside, Kami would turn around into nine
feet of arms. They got the the ball inside at will."
Anderson elaborated, "You felt helpless because
they were so tall. We boxed out, and they could still
reach over us and get the rebound."
McCrea used a military analogy. "I know now
what it was like for the Russians in World War II
on horseback fighting the German tanks."
The other problem for Stanford was again break
ing the press. Sourlis summed up the Cardinal's dif
ficulty, "We weren't taking our time and using the

clock wisely. We used 15 seconds bringing the ball
upcourt, then didn't have time to get a good shot.
Rutgers Head Coach Theresa Grentz agreed.
"We knew we wanted to up-tempo Stanford on
defense." she said. "In the second half we didn t
press. If you let them run their offense, they'll hit
those shots."
In the championship game. Ohio State had three
chances in the last 16 seconds to win. but the Uni
versity of Georgia hung on for a 58-57 victory in
front of 2.067 fans.
Dec. 7, Fresno State 72, Stanford 57 — Senior
forward Mary Bradach scored IS points and pulled
down seven rebounds, but it was not enough as the
Cardinal lost a non-conference game to the host
l.ady Bulldogs.
Dec. 15, Stanford 69, L'SF 5M — Bradach scored
a career-high 21 points and pulled down 13
rebounds as Stanford downed visiting University of
San Francisco in another non-conference game.
Sourlis added IS points and seven rebounds, and
Anderson had 13 points and nine rebounds. Sebolt
missed the game with a sprained ankle.
Jan. 2, Stanford 55, Lafayette 53 — Sourlis
scored a game-high 16 points and Anderson added
12 points and 10 rebounds as the Cardinal downed
Lafayette College in Easton, Pa. Leading 27-23 at
halftime, Stanford opened a 14-point advantage
with 7:52 left, but the Leopards came back. The
Cardinal hung on despite four missed free throws in
the final four minutes.
Jan. 4, Monmouth 62, Stanford 55 — Anderson
scored a career-high 21 points as the Cardinal lost a
seesaw battle to Monmouth College in West Long
Branch, N.J. Bradach and forward Kim Mercer
both had 12 points, and Sourlis added 10 points
and six assists. Mueser had eight assists. The
outside shooting of Anderson and Sourlis opened
up the inside game, but Stanford could not get the
ball inside in the end.
