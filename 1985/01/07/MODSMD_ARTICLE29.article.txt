## 
### JOHN LIS Daily staff 
Forward Mary Bradach hit a 10-
foot jumper at the end of regula
tion to force overtime, and guard
Virginia Sourlis made four free
throws at the end of the extra per
iod. as the Stanford women's bas
ketball team edged Seton Hall
University, 75-74, yesterday in
South Orange, N.J.
A missed Seton Hall tree throw
with the Bucettes leading 63-61
with 12 seconds left gave Stanford
the opportunity to tie the game in
regulation. Stanford Asst. Coach
Mike Kehoe said the plan was to
get the ball to either Sourlis or for
ward Kami Anderson, but neither
was open. Guard Charli Turner
got the ball to Bradach, who put it
into the net as the horn went off.
Stanford shot well on the after
noon, hitting 58 percent from the
field and 86 percent from the line.
Sourlis finished with 23 points to
lead the Cardinal. Anderson had
18 points while playing all 45
minutes. Bradach was seven of
nine from the field, finishing with
16 points, and forward Kim Mer
cer was four of four from the field
and two of two from the line for 10
points

Stanford was able to run its of
fense, a luxur\ that it hadn't had in
earlier games with Ohio State and
Rutgers. "They pressed some, but
they weren't quicker than we
were," Kehoe said. "When we
move the ball well, we'll get our
shots.
"It was a great win for us — a
great team effort."
Bradach's shot gave Stanford
momentum going into the
overtime. "We came out strong in
overtime," Kehoe said. " 'V'
(Sourlis) hit the first hoop and we
never trailed. At the end of the
game, we wanted to get the ball in
her hands, and they fouled her."
Sourlis responded by sinking the
free throws to seal the victory.
"Kami and Virginia were hitting
well from the outside." Kehoe
continued, "and that opened the
inside for Kim (Mercer) and Mary
(Bradach), who were doing a good
job of posting up."
With the win, Stanford im
proves to 5-7. The Cardinal was 2-
3 on the 11-day Eastern swing,
and it opens its Western Collegiate
Athletic Association schedule Sat
urday night against Cal State
Fullerton at Maples Pavilion.
