The Stanford men won the Spartan Open men's gym
nastics meet in San Jose Dec. 14-15, but one of the six
teams the Cardinal defeated, well, hardly exists.
The Cardinal defeated a group of gymnasts who have
completed their eligibility, a team Stanford Coach Sadao
Hamada said was called the University of Rigormortis,
239.9-237.65. San Jose State University was third with
228.75 points, and the University of California at Santa
Barbara was fourth with 199.1. Scores for the other
teams, Fullerton State University, the University of Cali
fornia at Davis and Chico State University, weren't
available.
Although Billy Paul, formerly of the University of Cali
fornia at Berkeley, won the all-around competition with
111.05 points, Stanford junior Jon Levy had a strong
showing.
Levy, who was second in the all-around with 107.35
points, was competing in his first meet of this season. He
was first in the vault and the horizontal bar events and
third in the rings, where he finished with a 9.4, behind

Fullerton's Chris McNulty's 9.65 and former Cal gymnast
A 1 Garcia's 9.6.
Levy, who Hamada said "is probably the best gymnast
on the Stanford team this year," has a good chance to be
among the top 15 nationally in the all-around. Last
season, Lev\ qualified for the National Collegiate Ath
letic Association championships. He also tried out for the
U.S. Olympic team but didn't make it to the second round
of the trials.
Cardinal sophomore Randy Besosa was third in the all
around with 106.45 points. Besosa was second in the hori
zontal bars, with a 9.35, and in the pommel horse, which
Paul won with a 9.5. Besosa had a 9.4 and tied with Mike
Bergman, who was the NCAA champion in 1980 and
1981 while at Cal.
A pair of Stanford freshmen also fared well. Mike Mat
zek and Chuck Gerardo were fourth and fifth,
respectively, in the all-around. Gerardo was the 19.84
United States Gymnastics Federation Class 1 alLaround
champion and was "one of the best recruits in the country
last year," Hamada said. Gerardo was second in the all
around in a recent meet in Colorado Springs. Colo.
