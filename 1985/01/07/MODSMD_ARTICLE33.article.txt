# 49ers put clamp on Chicago, 23-0

### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Gary
Johnson and Michael Carter led a San
Francisco defense that registered nine
sacks and outplayed its Chicago
counterpart yesterday as the 49ers
shut out the Bears 23-0 to win the Na
tional Football Conference title.
The victory put the 49ers into
Super Bowl XIX at Stanford
Stadium Jan. 20 against Miami.
Wendell Tyler scored on a nine
yard, third-quarter run up the middle,
Joe Montana threw to Freddie
Solomon for a 10-yard, fourth
quarter touchdown and Ray Wersch
ing had field goals of 21, 22 and 34
yards as the 49ers equaled a National
Football League record with their
17th victory of the season.
But it was a defense that never let
Chicago inside its 20 and limited the
Bears to 115 yards in the first three
quarters that gave the 49ers their
11th straight triumph. The 17th vic
tory — the 49ers have lost once —
ties the record set by the undefeated
Super Bowl champion Dolphins in
1972.
Carter, a silver medalist in the shot
put in the Summer Olympics, was
credited with 2 sacks and Johnson, a
10-year veteran released by the San
Diego Chargers, had two as San
Francisco allowed Chicago only two

drives of note while the game was in
doubt.
The first was to the 24 on the first
series of the game, and ended when
Boh Thomas missed a 41-yard field
goal try. The second came late in the
third quarter, when consecutive sacks
by Dwaine Board and Johnson
pushed Chicago back from the 21 to
the 40.
San Francisco's offensive line con
tained the Chicago defense that had
an NFL record 72 sacks in the regular
season and seven more in last week's
23-19 victory over Washington. This
time, the Bears had three sacks, but
none had a significant impact on the
game.
Midway through the third quarter.
49er Dana McLeniore returned a
Max Runager punt 15 yards to the
San Francisco 35. Four plays later,
Tyler took a pitchout from Montana
and cut off-tackle, shrugging off four
Bears on his way to the endzone to
make it 13-0.
After the sacks by Board and
Johnson thwarted the next Chicago
drive. San Francisco put the game
away, going 88 yards in eight plays,
climaxed by Montana's toss to
Solomon. Roger Craig's 39-yard run
to the Chicago 14 set up the score.
Wersching's 34-yard field goal with
1:57 left closed out the scoring.
