# Marino beats blitz in Miami's victory

### 
MIAMI (AP) — "When a defense
blitzes," Dan Marino said, "they take
the chance they are going to get
hurt." The Pittsburgh Steelers blitzed
the Miami quarterback yesterday —
and he killed them.
He also damaged the National
Football League record book, throw
ing for 421 yards and four touchdown
passes, both American Conference
championship-game records, as the
Dolphins barreled into Super Bowl
XIX with a 45-28 bombing of the
Steelers.
Marino followed up his record
setting regular season with scoring
strikes of 40 yards to Mark Clayton in
the first period, 41 yards to Mark

Duper in the second, 36 yards to
Duper in the third and six yards to
Nat Moore in the fourth.
That broke the AFC title-game
record of three touchdown passes
shared by George Blanda of Houston
and Joe Namath of the New York
Jets. And the yardage exceeded
Daryle Lamonica's 401 for the Oak
land Raiders against the Jets in 1968.
It also was the second-most yards
ever in NFL postseason play, behind
only Dan Fouts' 433 in San Diego's
41-38 overtime victory in Miami in a
1982 divisional playoff.
And this despite the fact that
Marino didn't throw the ball in the
final 11:05.
