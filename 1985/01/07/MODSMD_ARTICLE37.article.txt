One Stanford sophomore was
killed and two other students
received minor injuries Dec. 13 when
their southbound car went off the
road and rolled down a 40-foot slope
on Interstate 5 south of Los Banos.
Aleka Doumas, 19. of Los An
geles, was thrown from the car in the
accident at 10:40 a.m. She died less
than two hours later at Los Banos
Community Hospital, the Merced
County coroner's office said. Miss
Doumas lived in Burbank House at
Stern Hall.
Tanya Novak, 20, from Laguna
Hills, and Jill Nelson, 19, of Mission
Viejo, were treated at Los Banos
Community Hospital and released.
The three had been driving home
for the holidays after autumn quarter
final exams. After stopping to change
drivers, they reportedly encountered
strong winds when pulling back onto
the road. Miss Doumas was driving at
the time of the accident.
The car, a 1978 Chevrolet Malibu,
belonged to Miss Novak's father.
Residents in the two houses were
"stunned" to hear the news, said Bur
bank Resident Fellow David Larue
shortlv after the accident. "Everyone

has been walking around in a state ol
shock." he said. "Some students had
just seen them at breakfast."
Memorial services for Miss
Doumas have not yet been an
