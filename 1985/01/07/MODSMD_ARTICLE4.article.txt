# ID options considered
## 
### FRANK LESTER Staff writer 
ASSU officials and the University registrar
have begun preliminary discussions to institute
a new student identification card system that
would render obsolete the paper cards now in
use.
Registrar Sally Mahoney said she has talked
with officials and student leaders, including
ASSU Senate Chair Eric Berg and Council-of-
Presidents member Alice Wells, about the
feasibility of revamping the current ID card and
replacing it with a card that could be read by
food service computers and by a proposed com
puter system that may be installed in Meyer Li
brary next year. "I think it's a question we need
to explore," she said.
Mahoney indicated that the "major thrust" of
any new card system would be machine
readability rather than photograph IDs.
Wells said that in her meetings with
Mahoney, the major question considered was
whether photo IDs would be obsolete in a mat
ter of a few years. She said one of the arguments
in favor of photo IDs is that they would make it

easier for vendors to identify students. 81.1 lie
added that in New York, where photo IDs are
now in use, businesses that were surveyed did
not teel any more compelled to cash people's
checks when they had photos on their ID cards
than when they did not.
Wells said that since the University is consid
ering installing computerized systems in many
areas where ID cards are now used by students,
it would be wise to "step back" and consider
whether giving students photo IDs would be
prudent in the long term.
"The photo ID might be outdated in a couple
of years," she said. "It would be a good idea to
evaluate whether it could do what it is intended
to do."
Mahoney and Wells agree that any new iden
tification card should be multi-purpose."
Wells said the purpose of the senate ID card
drive is to give students a card that could be
used not only for identification, but also for
checking out books and eating meals. Eventu
ally, such an ID could be used with any new
computer system the University installs.
