# GSB enters 60th year

### MONICA HARDER 
The new year marks the 60th anniversary of
the Stanford Graduate School of Business.
On first glance, the business school may ap
pear to have changed very little during the last
10 years. But though enrollment and faculty
have remained relatively constant, the school is
now "in a stronger position than 10 years ago,"
owing to the increased quality of faculty and
students, according to Eugene Webb, associate
dean for academic affairs.
Much of the festivities to celebrate the 60th
anniversary have yet to be worked out. The
alumni seminars scheduled for Los Angeles in
March and the annual alumni day in the fall are
possibilities, according to Richard Kurovsky,
director of news and publications at the business
school.
The business school first opened its doors in
1925. This was due, in large part, to the efforts
of Herbert Hoover, then secretary of commerce
in President Coolidge's administration. Saying
"a graduate school of business is urgently
needed upon the Pacific coast," he persuaded a
group of entrepreneurial San Franciscan friends

to finance a graduate school of business at Stan
ford.
During 1925-26, annual tuition, room and
board totaled $760. Sixty years later, compara
ble costs exceed $ 16,400.
The business school was first located in Jor
dan Hall. It began as a regional school with the
intent "to lift business training out of the cate
gory of formalism . . . and to elevate it to a pro
fessional dignity."
The first class comprised only 16 students,
but enrollment and faculty increased through
the 1940s and '50s, and a march began in the
1960s to make the business school a national
center of excellence.
In 1966 the business school moved to its cur
rent location opposite the History Corner. As
evidence of its growth, one half of the school's
alumni have graduated since 1970.
Total enrollment for the class of 1984 totaled
319, with a mean age of 26.4. Forty-nine per
cent of these graduates chose traditional em
ployment in the areas of consulting, investment
banking, financial services and commercial
banking.
