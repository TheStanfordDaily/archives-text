'Star Wars' called a deception
GENEVA, Switzerland — A comprehensive study prepared by top
Soviet scientists in advance of the U.S.-Soviet arms talks charges that
President Reagan's "Star Wars" plan is a dangerous and costly
"deception" that could increase the chances of nuclear war.
The purpose of the 42-page, largely technical report, which is dated
only "1984," is unknown, but it apparently was prepared earlier last
year to draw together the thinking of top Soviet scientists in several
fields.
Although there is no indication it played a role in preparation of So
viet policy for the talks beginning here today, it is the most comprehen
sive account of the Soviet estimate and attitude toward the Reagan ad
ministration's Strategic Defense Initiative known to have reached the
West
Two Western reporters noticed a reference to it in a recent Soviet
technical journal, and one of them obtained it and shared it with the
other.
Taken together with Washington statements, including those of
Reagan last week, the report dramatizes the deep division between the
two nuclear superpowers on a subject that is expected to loom large in
the talks here between Secretary of State George Shultz and Foreign
Minister Andrei Gromyko.
A State Department spokesman with the Shultz party would not com
ment on the report.
The document concedes that parts of a space-based antiballistic
missile system may be feasible at enormous cost, which it estimates at
$1.5 trillion to $2 trillion.
But it maintains that any hoped-for increase in U.S. security would be
illusory and charges that "the very attempt to create" such a system will
be "a heavily destabilizing factor" in increasing the likelihood of a pre
emptive nuclear strike and all-out nuclear war.
Jordan to use Soviet arms
BEIRUT. Lebanon — Jordan, traditionally one of the closest U.S.
allies in the Arab world, has announced that it plans to deploy a Soviet
supplied air defense system early this year.
The announcement was made by the Jordanian army commander. Lt.
Gen. Sharif Zayed Shaker, during a speech to military officers in Am
man, Jordan's capital, Saturday night.
Shaker also announced that Jordan, which formerly depended
primarily on U.S. military equipment, is negotiating other arms pur
chases from European countries.
"Jordan is looking to conclude more deals with Britain and France in
order to support our forces and strengthen (their) military structure
despite our limited resources," Shaker said, according to an Associated
Press dispatch from Amman.
The Soviet air defense system purchased by Jordan is believed to con
sist primarily of surface-to-air missiles and radar to control them. The
size of the purchase was not disclosed.
Initially, the Reagan administration had proposed selling Jordan
Stinger anti-aircraft missiles. But the Jordanian monarch. King Hussein,
rejected the offer last March when the plan encountered resistance in
Congress from supporters of Israel.
Hussein has since explained that he was turning to the Soviet Union
and Western Europe as arms suppliers because America's relationship
with Israel had tilted the United States away from an even-handed ap
proach to the Middle East.
"We have turned to diversifying sources for our weapons after certain
difficulties with the United States," Hussein said in an interview pub
lished in October. "We bring weapons to defend ourselves against the
danger of some ministers in the present Israeli government who claim
that the Jordanain east side is also part of Israel."
Dan White now a free man
LOS ANGELES — Vowing to do "nothing stupid" to endanger his
own security, Dan White became a free man yesterday, six years after he
killed San Francisco Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey
Milk, a state prison official said.
White's parole ended at 12:01 a.m. yesterday. State parole officers did
not know whether he would move from the apartment where he has
been living alone in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles, said Bob
Gore, spokesman for the state Department of Corrections.
"He's given no indication of his future plans at any time." Gore said
yesterday. "As of midnight he was a free man and we don't keep track of
his whereabouts . . . We have no indication of where he is right now."
In the San Francisco area, many groups and individuals have warned
that White, 38, should not return there for his own and the public's
safety.
Before his parole, White was told that Mayor Dianne Feinstein called
parole officials "to express her grave concern that the public safety and
Dan White's safety would be endangered if Dan White returned to San
Francisco," Gore said.
The last official contact by state officials with White was a visit to his
apartment Friday night by his parole officer who reminded him he was
still on parole one more day"and advised him that there was hostility
toward him in the San Francisco area," said Gore.
"His response was: 'I will do nothing stupid,' " Gore said.
White, himself a former San Francisco supervisor, shot to death
Moscone and Milk, a popular gay supervisor, on Nov. 27, 1978. His
defense of diminished capacity due in part to consumption of sugary
Twinkie cupcakes won him a voluntary manslaughter conviction instead
of murder. The conviction touched of a night of rioting by people
outraged at what they considered the jury's leniency.
Israel hopes to continue airlifts
JERUSALEM — Israeli officials said yesterday that they still hope to
rescue more Ethiopian Jews despite premature publicity that they were
blamed for at least a temporary halt to a clandestine emergency airlift
code-named "Operation Moses."
A Belgian charter airline which had been ferrying the Ethiopian Jews
from the Sudan to Israel via three West European cities announced Sat
urday that the operation, under way since early November, "has ended
as far as we are concerned."
Top officials of the government's Jewish Agency, meeting in London,
confirmed that a flight scheduled for yesterday had been canceled. The
last planeload of Ethiopians arrived at Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion airport
Saturday night.
A spokesman for the Belgian company. Trans European Airways, was
quoted by the British Broadcasting Corp. as saying that widespread
publicity about the sensitive rescue effort had made it impossible to con
tinue.
The Jerusalem Post reported yesterday that the charter airline does
considerable business flying Moslem pilgrims to Mecca, which would ac
count for its sensitivitv.
Cambodians prepare for assault
BANGKOK. Thailand — Vietnamese forces and the Khmer People's
National Liberation Front, which is defending its bases along the Thai
border, were preparing yesterday for what observers described as a
decisive battle for the Cambodian rebel headquarters at Ampil.
The observers predicted that the Vietnamese would attempt to take
the heavily defended base today to highlight the sixth anniversary of
their occupation of Cambodia.
The struggle for Ampil has led to the greatest troop concentration
ever in the Cambodian guerrilla war. Thai intelligence service sources
said the Vietnamese have moved some 4.000 troops into the area, to
gether with about 50 armored vehicles and heavy artillery.
The Thai sources also believe that Hanoi may be considering using
fighter aircraft and armed helicopters for the first time in the conflict.
An initial Vietnamese effort to conquer Ampil last April ended in a
bloody defeat.
Ampil. which has a mobile field hospital and other military installa
tions. as well as training schools for officers and young guerrilla recruits,
is defended by 3,500 Khmer People's National Liberation Front troops,
most of whom have only light arms which cannot match the Vietnamese
fire-power.
Today's weather
Rain likely today with a high temperature in the 50s.
