GENEVA. Switzerland — Secre
tin \ of State George Shultz and So
viet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko pledged yesterday to do
theii best in pursuit of peace as they
arrived in the hitter chill of this Swiss
city to work out plans for resumption
of U.S.-Soviet arms-control negotia
tions after a year-long suspension.
At arrival ceremonies about eight
hours apart. Shult/ and Gromyko
spoke of the desire for "responsible,"
"constructive" and "serious" discus
sions beginning here today in the
glare of intense international atten
tion. In deference to the occasion and
to diplomatic tradition, they made
only the barest reference to the wide
and. in some respects, basic differ
ences between them on issues to be
confronted in the next two days.
Shultz. who arrived first, after an
all-night flight from Washington,
said. "We have no illusions that prog
ress will be easy to achieve." but he
promised to "work as hard as we can
to achieve a positive outcome from
these discussions."
Standing in the numbing wind of a
record-breaking cold wave, blamed
by meteorologists on icy blasts from
Siberia. Shultz said it was a sign of

U.S. seriousness that he was accom
panied by "a high-powered team" in
cluding Robert McFarlane. the White
House national security adviser. Also
along are a number of sometimes
feuding senior State Department.
Defense Department. Arms Control
and Disarmament Agency and Na
tional Security Council officials.
In an interview with reporters
aboard his plane. Shultz said he is
going into the meetings with "some
very interesting and reasonable posi
tions"
"These are not talks to negotiate
substantive agreements." he said, but
are "political-level" discussions de
signed to pave the way for future full
scale negotiations on arms issues be
tween the two nations.
Gromy ko. speaking to the cameras
and reporters in English in what
seemed to be a bow to the extraordi
nary international press attention,
harked back to the Thanksgiving Day
U.S.-Soviet joint statement of agree
ment to the current talks.
The veteran Soviet minister noted
that the two nations in the joint state
ment had agreed in principle to enter
into new substantive negotiations on
complex issues including space weap

ons and offensive nuclear arms.
The task before him and Shult/. lie
said, is to work out "a common un
derstanding as to the subject and ob
jectives" of such negotiations.
The Soviet position, he said, is that
the later negotiations should aim to
"prevent an arms race in outer spaic
and move toward "radical reduction
of nuclear arms" and. in the long iun.
their elimination.
Since separate U.S.-Soviet negotia
tions on strategic offensive arms am
medium-range missiles in I uiope
were broken off by Moscow late in
1983. the arms-control dialogue has
been complicated by the increasing
focus of both sides on President
Reagan's space-based Strategic
Defense Initiative, also called Star
Wars" — a plan intended to protect
the United States against nuclear
missiles.
The central priority of the Soviet
Union, according to U.S. officials and
public statements from Moscow, is to
head off the placement ot U.S. weap
ons in space for defense or any othei
purpose.
The U.S. position as enunciated ny
Reagan, McFarlane and others is that
space-based defense systems may oi

ler an opportunity to escape from the
postwar pattern of security based on
the threat of nuclear retaliation.
li.S. officials have made it clear
that Shultz is primed to reject Soviet
proposals that interfere with testing
or development of the Star Wars pro
gram. which is still in its early re
search stage.
Soviet officials, on the other hand,
have described agreement on at least
the objective of halting militarization
of outer space as "the key" to every
thing else in the arms-control arena.
This suggests that Moscow will refuse
to move toward reductions of offen
sive arms control unless an accom
modation can be sighted in the space
area.
Shultz and Gromyko will begin
their talks at the Soviet mission here
today. Accompanying Shultz into the
talks will be McFarlane. special ad
viser Paul Nitze and Arthur Hartman.
U.S. ambassador to Moscow.
Gromyko is to be accompanied by
strategic arms negotiator Viktor Kar
pov; Anatoliy Dobrynin, the Soviet
ambassador to the United States; and
one other official.

GENEVA. Switzerland — Secre
tin \ of State George Shultz and So
viet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko pledged yesterday to do
theii best in pursuit of peace as they
arrived in the hitter chill of this Swiss
city to work out plans for resumption
of U.S.-Soviet arms-control negotia
tions after a year-long suspension.
At arrival ceremonies about eight
hours apart. Shult/ and Gromyko
spoke of the desire for "responsible,"
"constructive" and "serious" discus
sions beginning here today in the
glare of intense international atten
tion. In deference to the occasion and
to diplomatic tradition, they made
only the barest reference to the wide
and. in some respects, basic differ
ences between them on issues to be
confronted in the next two days.
Shultz. who arrived first, after an
all-night flight from Washington,
said. "We have no illusions that prog
ress will be easy to achieve." but he
promised to "work as hard as we can
to achieve a positive outcome from
these discussions."
Standing in the numbing wind of a
record-breaking cold wave, blamed
by meteorologists on icy blasts from
Siberia. Shultz said it was a sign of

U.S. seriousness that he was accom
panied by "a high-powered team" in
cluding Robert McFarlane. the White
House national security adviser. Also
along are a number of sometimes
feuding senior State Department.
Defense Department. Arms Control
and Disarmament Agency and Na
tional Security Council officials.
In an interview with reporters
aboard his plane. Shultz said he is
going into the meetings with "some
very interesting and reasonable posi
tions"
"These are not talks to negotiate
substantive agreements." he said, but
are "political-level" discussions de
signed to pave the way for future full
scale negotiations on arms issues be
tween the two nations.
Gromy ko. speaking to the cameras
and reporters in English in what
seemed to be a bow to the extraordi
nary international press attention,
harked back to the Thanksgiving Day
U.S.-Soviet joint statement of agree
ment to the current talks.
The veteran Soviet minister noted
that the two nations in the joint state
ment had agreed in principle to enter
into new substantive negotiations on
complex issues including space weap

ons and offensive nuclear arms.
The task before him and Shult/. lie
said, is to work out "a common un
derstanding as to the subject and ob
jectives" of such negotiations.
The Soviet position, he said, is that
the later negotiations should aim to
"prevent an arms race in outer spaic
and move toward "radical reduction
of nuclear arms" and. in the long iun.
their elimination.
Since separate U.S.-Soviet negotia
tions on strategic offensive arms am
medium-range missiles in I uiope
were broken off by Moscow late in
1983. the arms-control dialogue has
been complicated by the increasing
focus of both sides on President
Reagan's space-based Strategic
Defense Initiative, also called Star
Wars" — a plan intended to protect
the United States against nuclear
missiles.
The central priority of the Soviet
Union, according to U.S. officials and
public statements from Moscow, is to
head off the placement ot U.S. weap
ons in space for defense or any othei
purpose.
The U.S. position as enunciated ny
Reagan, McFarlane and others is that
space-based defense systems may oi

ler an opportunity to escape from the
postwar pattern of security based on
the threat of nuclear retaliation.
li.S. officials have made it clear
that Shultz is primed to reject Soviet
proposals that interfere with testing
or development of the Star Wars pro
gram. which is still in its early re
search stage.
Soviet officials, on the other hand,
have described agreement on at least
the objective of halting militarization
of outer space as "the key" to every
thing else in the arms-control arena.
This suggests that Moscow will refuse
to move toward reductions of offen
sive arms control unless an accom
modation can be sighted in the space
area.
Shultz and Gromyko will begin
their talks at the Soviet mission here
today. Accompanying Shultz into the
talks will be McFarlane. special ad
viser Paul Nitze and Arthur Hartman.
U.S. ambassador to Moscow.
Gromyko is to be accompanied by
strategic arms negotiator Viktor Kar
pov; Anatoliy Dobrynin, the Soviet
ambassador to the United States; and
one other official.
