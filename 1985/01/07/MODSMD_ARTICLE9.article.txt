# Fight arising over Social Security
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Barely three months after
President Reagan pledged "never" to "tamper"
with the Social Security system, the politically
sensitive program has become a prime target of key
GOP lawmakers and others in the effort to find a
formula for reducing the massive federal budget
deficits.
L.ed by Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-
Kan.). Republican senators have steered the
budget debate carefully toward this inevitable colli
sion between political and economic priorities,
despite bitter memories on both sides of similar
fights during Reagan's first term.
The growing likelihood that an effort will be
made to delay or limit cost-of-living increases in
Social Security benefits as part of an overall budget
freeze sets the stage for a major struggle this year
that not only would pit Republicans against
Democrats but also could enlarge fissures in both
parties over difficult fiscal issues.
The fight also could produce strange bedfellows.
Reagan has ruled out a freeze on Social Security
cost-of-living increases in his new budget, and an
aide to one House Democrat said, "There's great
sentiment (among Democrats) in helping President
Reagan keep his promise."
The president's opposition has not deterred
GOP senators. Dole, who said Friday that

Republicans will write their own budget in the Sen
ate, began hinting at the need to rein in Social Se
curity almost from the day he was elected majority
leader in mid-December. Fete Domenici (R-
N.M.), Senate budget committee chairman, and
newly elected Majority Whip Alan Simpson (R-
Wyo.) have supported him.
Last week, Dole organized a well-publicized
hearing in which former chief economic advisers to
three presidents told the Senate Finance Commit
tee that significant progress on reducing the deficit
could not occur without touching Social Security.
Dole's motivation in raising such a politically
delicate issue is not clear. Some members of
Congress say they believe he may be doing it to
force Reagan to accept larger defense cuts.
"I assume that is the motivation," Sen. Daniel
Moynihan (D-N.Y.) said. Others say they believe
Dole is paving the way for Reagan to accept such
cuts as part of an overall budget compromise.
Dole's effort puts him on a collision course not
only with the president but with his counterpart in
the House, Minority Leader Robert Michel (R
-III.).
"It sounds to me as if they're going to pursue that
course," Michael Johnson, Michel's press secre
tary, said of developments in the Senate. "But we
are not."

Johnson called reductions in Social Security "off
the table" because, in Reagan's first term. Republi
can candidates "got beat over the head" when the
White House tried to cut benefits in 198 1.
Reagan's aborted attempt to cut the program
eventually led to a political truce and a bipartisan
commission that assembled a package of tax in
creases and future benefit cuts to keep the system
from going bankrupt. Republicans reluctantly
bought the higher taxes and Democrats swallowed
hard on the benefit cuts. Once approved by the
commission, the package moved quickly through
Congress in the spring of 1983.
The talk about Social Security cuts is all the more
extraordinary because of the issue's role in the
presidential campaign last fall. In the first presiden
tial debate, Walter Mondale goaded Reagan into
saying he would not go after the program after the
election.
"A president should never say never," Reagan
said in Louisville, "but I am going to violate the
rule and say 'never.' I will never reduce Social Se
curity benefits to people that are now getting
them."
