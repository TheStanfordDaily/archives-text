### 
NEW YORK — John Zaccaro, whose financial
dealings haunted the vice presidential campaign of
his wife, Geraldine Ferraro, pleaded guilty yester
day to a misdemeanor charge of "scheming to
defraud" in connection with the sale of live apart
ment buildings.
Judge George Roberts said that in accordance
with an agreement between Zaccaro and the Man
hattan district attorney, he would not impose a jail
sentence unless Zaccaro committed another of
fense before sentencing on Feb. 20.
Zaccaro was released without bail.
In a statement, Zaccaro said he hoped his plea
would end the "microscopic attention given to my
personal and business affairs" since July, when his
wife was selected by Walter Mondale as his running
mate, making her the first woman to run on a major
party's national ticket.
"In a real sense, his plea today is the end of the
1984 presidential campaign," said Zaccaro's
lawyer, Arthur Liman.
Ferraro said in a statement that her husband
"has freely admitted his mistake and for this I am

proud of him. John is a decent, honorable man and
today's events do nothing to change him in the eyes
of his family and friends. We love him very much."
Liman said he believed Zaccaro had a
"defensible" case.
But Zaccaro said, "In light of the nature of the
charge and in order to spare my family the publicity
of prolonged legal proceedings, I wish to conclude
the matter and try to return to a private life."
Neither Ferraro nor the couple's three children
were in court. Liman said Ferraro had wanted to be
there, but Zaccaro insisted that she not accompany
him.
Roberts read the indictment to Zaccaro in state
Supreme Court, a trial court. He then asked Zac
caro if he had been a broker rather than a principal
in the deal. Zaccaro said he was, anil told the judge
the deal never went through.
The judge asked him if he had read the indict
ment, and if the charges were true.
"Yes. the parts that you read," Zaccaro said.
A co-defendant, Harold Farrell, 63, of New
York City, also pleaded guilty to the charge.

Zaccaro pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor,
punishable by up to a year in prison and $1,000 in
fines. Lillian said that under the plea, the most Zac
caro could face is the tine and probation.
State officials said Zaccaro would not automati
cally lose his real estate license, but the conviction
would be part of an investigation into Zaccaro's
business dealings that could ultimately result in
such a penalty.
District Attorney Robert Morgenthau alleged
that Zaccaro. 51, of New York City, tried to obtain
financing for the purchase of five buildings in
Queens for John DeLorenzo. a real estate investor.
Zaccaro submitted a falsely inflated contract of
sale for the apartment buildings to a mortgage bro
ker. altered a copy of an appraisal of the buildings,
which was submitted to Prudential-Bache Securi
ties, and issued a financial statement listinu ln\ own
net worth at $21.6 million — about $IN ivuUum voo
high. Morgenthau said.
