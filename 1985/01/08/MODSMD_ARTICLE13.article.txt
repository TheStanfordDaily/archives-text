## The 						Stanford Daily Taking Carbide to task 
### 
One morning five weeks ago, a Union Carbide
gas storage tank began to leak in Bhopal, a town
in central India. A halt hour later, five tons of the
deadly methyl isocyanate had leaked into the air
and began a silent slaughter.
When it was over, more than 2,500 people had
died and nearly 1 ()().()()() survivors may be left
with permanent disabilities, ranging from blind
ness to brain damage. The scale of the disaster
was unprecedented; Bhopal has acquired the un
happy distinction of becoming the site of the
worst industrial accident in history.
That the accident occurred should not be a
great surprise. The Bhopal plant had, at best, a
spotty record, with six documented mishaps in
the past six years.
At this point, culpability is unclear. Both the
Indian government and the company seem to
share blame in the tragedy. But in the interest of
short-term equity and long-term corporate ac
countability, Union Carbide must be held re
sponsible for any and all negligence.
One of the most-asked questions after the
tragedy was "Can it happen here?" This worry —
perhaps a measure of our ethnocentricity — pro
vides the necessary clue to deal with industrial

accidents in underdeveloped countries.
To ensure an adequate safety standard tor
people living near industrial plants in non-
Western nations, punishment must he uniform
regardless of the accident's location. Union
Carbide should pay the same price for the Bhopal
disaster as it would have had the leak occurred in
New York or London.
Corporations seem to understand little outside
of profit and loss. If the cost of industrial acci
dents is lower in underdeveloped nations, then
these companies have little incentive to keep
safety standards high in those areas.
San Francisco attorney Melvin Belli and others
have filed class action suits against Union
Carbide in federal court. Some of these are ask
ing for as much as $15 billion.
These lawyers have been described as vultures
by some, and the amounts asked for have been
called too high.
It's true that $15 billion is a lot of money. But
if such settlements are necessary to force multi
nationals to enforce adequate safety levels, then
even Union Carbide's bankruptcy is not too high
a price.
