## Results show supply side working 
### 
In my last column (Nov. 20), I pointed out
that both the time-scale of the economic
recovery and the Kennedy tax cuts ot the
1960s established the cause-effect relation
ship between tax cuts and economic growth as
outlined in the supply-side doctrine. I con
tended further that the popular mandate
demonstrated in the November elections
combined with the empirical vindication of
the supply-side theory should lead to the
eventual adoption of a flat income tax rate. In
a Nov. 28 letter to The Daily. Joseph Gagnon
purports to expose my most glaring errors,
concluding finally that the impending deficit
expansion has led to abandonment of supply
side theory in the administration; Gagnon at
tributes the Kennedy tax cut success to the
Keynesians, and ends by urging Reagan to
"postpone the day of reckoning" no further.
Regrettably for the Keynesians, both his
premise and his thesis are flawed. Old ideas
die hard.
Gagnon opens by arguing that the recovery
began in November 1982, while the first
round of tax cuts took effect over a year ear
lier on July 1, 1981. In fact, the first and
smallest round did not begin until Oct. 1 of
that year. The first major tax cut (a 10-
percent across-the-board reduction) did not
occur until July 1. 1983, a year later. The
catch here is that no distinction is made be
tween income earned before that date and

income earned up to Dec. 31. 1982. Hence,
investors on the margin who were deciding
whether to invest before or after Jan. 1, 1983,
had an incentive to postpone. This would ac
count perfectly for the bottoming out of the
recession in December 1982 and the marked
growth that began New Year's Day 1983 and
which still continues today. To substantiate
this, let's look at the figures. Nov. 1982 and
Dec. 1982 unemployment reached 10.7 per
cent and 10.8 percent, respectively. Both
broke records for post-World War II un
employment. During January 1983, un
employment dropped to 10.4 percent, the
first decrease since 1981. Industrial produc
tion, which had lagged in November and
December, actually increased in January. The
index of leading economic indicators rose in
January by 3.6 percent. The last time such a
one-month jump was recorded was in July
1950, just after the Korean War. Producer
prices, which had increased 0.6 percent in No
vember, fell 1 percent in January, the largest
drop since records had first been kept in
1947. Housing starts, which had been down
by 13 percent in December, rose by 35.9 per
cent in January, the largest increase since
1959 when the Commerce Department first
began keeping the statistic. The bottom line is
clear: Reagan's most significant departure
from classical economic theory produced
sharp economic growth which has been sus
tained, and whose timing coincides precisely

with the incentive calculation upon which
supply-side economics is based.
In terms of the Kennedy tax cuts, which I
referred to as the only true macroeconomic
precedent to Reagan's 25-percent cut, Gag
non insists on calling them a Keynesian vic
tory. It is certainly true that the Kennedy
package was designed and implemented by
Keynesians. It worked, but for the wrong
reasons. Supposedly, taking money from the
government during a major economic con
traction and giving to the people will result in
increased consumption. What in fact happens
is that tax reductions encourage people to in
vest rather than to spend, to work rather than
to collect unemployment or to spend more
time at leisure. Smaller taxes let people keep
more of what they earn. In other words,
supply-siders always advocate tax reduction
when tax rates are prohibitively high and pro
gressive. It is quite a coincidence that the only
truly successful Keynesian prescription since
World War 11 was also the only instance in
which supply-siders concurred. This realiza
tion. and the accompanying demise of the
Keynesian school, did not gain grass-roots ap
proval until their pretensions to precisely ad
just the delicate economic machinery by
interfering in the free-market economy led to
the dire difficulties of the 19705: spiraling in
flation, swelling unemployment and the
declining dollar.

The most pressing problem confronting us
today is, of course, the budget deficit. Gag
non, who conveniently fails to mention that
the budget deficit has been continually falling
since its peak in December 1982, cites recent
OMB forecasts which predict only slow ero
sions of the deficit in the coming years. Some
urgent change is needed, he implies, in order
to prevent economic disaster. Though he pro
vides no specific details, the panacea is
presumably a tax hike such as Walter
Mondale advocated. A return such as this to
the decaying policies of the past will simply
reproduce the stagflation they caused in the
past. The only way to ameliorate the deficit
without killing the body economic is to stay
the course. From its peak in December 1982,
the deficit fell from about $240 billion to
$195.4 billion at the end of fiscal year 1983
(Journal of Commerce) as the recovery began
to take effect. As the boom continued the def
icit was reduced further to $175.34 billion at
the end of fiscal year 1984 (Treasury Report,
Oct. 25). During the last few years. OMB and
Congressional Budget Office (CBO) predic
tions have consistently been too high. During
the next few years, despite the pessimistic
foreboding of some, we should see a continu
ing reduction in the deficit led by natural eco
nomic growth, provided the Congress decides
to cooperate a little better in trimming the
budget. The Nov. 26 National Review puts it
best: "Mondale is in touch with the consensus

view nf the economy. Reagan is in touch with
the economy."
But we don't need to rely solely on the tax
cuts of the first administration. Beginning in
I I )NS, the final major element of Reagan's tax
package will take effect: indexing of tax
schedules to account lor inflation. This un
precedented move, instigated by supply-side
advisers, puts the final nail in the coffin ot
bracket-creep, that insidious economic
parasite which causes steady, unlegislated tax
increases for all Americans.
Finally, we have the modified flat tax pro
posal to look forward to. It is ironic that news
of this distinctly supply-side proposal ap
peared in the same issue of The Daily in
which Gagnon recounted the "disappearance
from policymaking circles in the administra
tion during l l )X2" of the supply-siders.
Though Reagan has not endorsed the
specifics of the Treasury Department pro
posal. he will almost 1 certainly propose some
variation of a flat tax.early next year. Passage
of such a bill is the next step toward ensuring
sustained economic growth and a continually
diminishing deficit. If Congress is not yet
ready for such a step, the popular mandate for
Reaganomies will have to wait a while for im
plementation. Kemp in'NN!

1947. Housing starts, which had been down
by 13 percent in December, rose by 35.9 per
cent in January, the largest increase since
1959 when the Commerce Department first
began keeping the statistic. The bottom line is
clear: Reagan's most significant departure
from classical economic theory produced
sharp economic growth which has been sus
tained, and whose timing coincides precisely

with the incentive calculation upon which
supply-side economics is based.
In terms of the Kennedy tax cuts, which I
referred to as the only true macroeconomic
precedent to Reagan's 25-percent cut, Gag
non insists on calling them a Keynesian vic
tory. It is certainly true that the Kennedy
package was designed and implemented by
Keynesians. It worked, but for the wrong
reasons. Supposedly, taking money from the
government during a major economic con
traction and giving to the people will result in
increased consumption. What in fact happens
is that tax reductions encourage people to in
vest rather than to spend, to work rather than
to collect unemployment or to spend more
time at leisure. Smaller taxes let people keep
more of what they earn. In other words,
supply-siders always advocate tax reduction
when tax rates are prohibitively high and pro
gressive. It is quite a coincidence that the only
truly successful Keynesian prescription since
World War 11 was also the only instance in
which supply-siders concurred. This realiza
tion. and the accompanying demise of the
Keynesian school, did not gain grass-roots ap
proval until their pretensions to precisely ad
just the delicate economic machinery by
interfering in the free-market economy led to
the dire difficulties of the 19705: spiraling in
flation, swelling unemployment and the
declining dollar.

The most pressing problem confronting us
today is, of course, the budget deficit. Gag
non, who conveniently fails to mention that
the budget deficit has been continually falling
since its peak in December 1982, cites recent
OMB forecasts which predict only slow ero
sions of the deficit in the coming years. Some
urgent change is needed, he implies, in order
to prevent economic disaster. Though he pro
vides no specific details, the panacea is
presumably a tax hike such as Walter
Mondale advocated. A return such as this to
the decaying policies of the past will simply
reproduce the stagflation they caused in the
past. The only way to ameliorate the deficit
without killing the body economic is to stay
the course. From its peak in December 1982,
the deficit fell from about $240 billion to
$195.4 billion at the end of fiscal year 1983
(Journal of Commerce) as the recovery began
to take effect. As the boom continued the def
icit was reduced further to $175.34 billion at
the end of fiscal year 1984 (Treasury Report,
Oct. 25). During the last few years. OMB and
Congressional Budget Office (CBO) predic
tions have consistently been too high. During
the next few years, despite the pessimistic
foreboding of some, we should see a continu
ing reduction in the deficit led by natural eco
nomic growth, provided the Congress decides
to cooperate a little better in trimming the
budget. The Nov. 26 National Review puts it
best: "Mondale is in touch with the consensus

view nf the economy. Reagan is in touch with
the economy."
But we don't need to rely solely on the tax
cuts of the first administration. Beginning in
I I )NS, the final major element of Reagan's tax
package will take effect: indexing of tax
schedules to account lor inflation. This un
precedented move, instigated by supply-side
advisers, puts the final nail in the coffin ot
bracket-creep, that insidious economic
parasite which causes steady, unlegislated tax
increases for all Americans.
Finally, we have the modified flat tax pro
posal to look forward to. It is ironic that news
of this distinctly supply-side proposal ap
peared in the same issue of The Daily in
which Gagnon recounted the "disappearance
from policymaking circles in the administra
tion during l l )X2" of the supply-siders.
Though Reagan has not endorsed the
specifics of the Treasury Department pro
posal. he will almost 1 certainly propose some
variation of a flat tax.early next year. Passage
of such a bill is the next step toward ensuring
sustained economic growth and a continually
diminishing deficit. If Congress is not yet
ready for such a step, the popular mandate for
Reaganomies will have to wait a while for im
plementation. Kemp in'NN!

In my last column (Nov. 20), I pointed out
that both the time-scale of the economic
recovery and the Kennedy tax cuts ot the
1960s established the cause-effect relation
ship between tax cuts and economic growth as
outlined in the supply-side doctrine. I con
tended further that the popular mandate
demonstrated in the November elections
combined with the empirical vindication of
the supply-side theory should lead to the
eventual adoption of a flat income tax rate. In
a Nov. 28 letter to The Daily. Joseph Gagnon
purports to expose my most glaring errors,
concluding finally that the impending deficit
expansion has led to abandonment of supply
side theory in the administration; Gagnon at
tributes the Kennedy tax cut success to the
Keynesians, and ends by urging Reagan to
"postpone the day of reckoning" no further.
Regrettably for the Keynesians, both his
premise and his thesis are flawed. Old ideas
die hard.
Gagnon opens by arguing that the recovery
began in November 1982, while the first
round of tax cuts took effect over a year ear
lier on July 1, 1981. In fact, the first and
smallest round did not begin until Oct. 1 of
that year. The first major tax cut (a 10-
percent across-the-board reduction) did not
occur until July 1. 1983, a year later. The
catch here is that no distinction is made be
tween income earned before that date and

income earned up to Dec. 31. 1982. Hence,
investors on the margin who were deciding
whether to invest before or after Jan. 1, 1983,
had an incentive to postpone. This would ac
count perfectly for the bottoming out of the
recession in December 1982 and the marked
growth that began New Year's Day 1983 and
which still continues today. To substantiate
this, let's look at the figures. Nov. 1982 and
Dec. 1982 unemployment reached 10.7 per
cent and 10.8 percent, respectively. Both
broke records for post-World War II un
employment. During January 1983, un
employment dropped to 10.4 percent, the
first decrease since 1981. Industrial produc
tion, which had lagged in November and
December, actually increased in January. The
index of leading economic indicators rose in
January by 3.6 percent. The last time such a
one-month jump was recorded was in July
1950, just after the Korean War. Producer
prices, which had increased 0.6 percent in No
vember, fell 1 percent in January, the largest
drop since records had first been kept in
1947. Housing starts, which had been down
by 13 percent in December, rose by 35.9 per
cent in January, the largest increase since
1959 when the Commerce Department first
began keeping the statistic. The bottom line is
