Fraternity choice
Why all the negative publicity
about the fraternities? Many stu
dents chose to attend Stanford, at
least partially, because of its incredi
bly diverse student body. As a
prospective freshman, I looked to
Stanford as a university where every
one did his own thing and was at the
same time respected for it. I would
hate to think that the men in the
fraternity system don't possess that
right. I chose the sort of environment
that I wanted to live in at Stanford,
and I question why the men in the
Greek system should not have this
same opportunity.
The fraternity system contributes
much to the Stanford campus and
residential life just as the co-ops, the
dorms and the specialty houses do.
Each expresses its own sort of in
dividuality. In addition, no matter
how much some people might hate
to admit it, the fraternities make a
much-needed contribution to the
social life, providing a significant
majority of the parties, especially on
weeknights. 1 agree that the ex
tended abuse of rules should not be
tolerated; however, these rules have
been quite inconsistently enforced.
Why have only the fraternities been
investigated? It seems that Residen
tial Education as well as the students
at this university should be much
more interested in preserving the
fraternity system as well as any other
group that contributes as much to
our cultural diversity and residential
life.

Dear Dean Lou gee,
< This is un open teller 10 Dean of the
School of Humanities and Sciences
Carolyn Lou gee)
1 am writing this letter to request
the continued support of the
SWOPSI-SCIRE programs at Stan
ford. During last quarter. I had the
nood fortune to take m\ first
SWOPSI class — SWOPSI 140:
Approaching the 21st Century —
with Jack Chin. This course has
helped me a great deal in terms of
developing my self-confidence in the
classroom. While this may not ap
pear to be important, it has certainly
been crucial to a sophomore in the
throes of "sophomore slump."

How did one course help ac
complish such a goal? To begin with,
after going through one year of
classes in the traditional
lecture/discussion format, I really
wanted a course with more discus
sion. It was quite refreshing to take a
class that emphasized discussion
among the students and removed the
formalized and sometimes intimidat
ing class format.
By having an enthusiastic student
teaching the course, a relaxed atmo
sphere is created which inspires
cooperation and curiosity in the
students. Due to the small size of the
course, students are not allowed to
be mere passive recipients of data
but are encouraged to perform inde
pendent research through an action
project.
While the intellectual content of
SWOPSI courses has been criticized,
I believe these courses are not
structured to focus on exclusively
intellectual subject matter, nor are
they intended to duplicate the con
tent of other courses taught in other
areas of the University. Rather, the
strength of SWOPSI courses lies in a
different but just as critically impor
tant goal — fostering self-confidence
in the classroom and encouraging
students to partake in an innovative
educational experience.

Look behind Reagan
Accountability is the essence ot
our system. Every modern president
has held regular news conferences.
Franklin D. Roosevelt held them
weekly. President Reagan has held
fewer than any. and has not had a
full-scale press conference since last
J ill v. Now he is saying. "I don't have
to (have them) anymore"! What are
they hiding? Let us mandate monthly
presidential press conferences.
Otherwise, they could choose never
to have one. Reagan did say a few
words on the Heisman football
awards TV show as our "master of
ceremonies." This is what passes for
accountability?
The question is being asked.
"What is wrong with the
Democrats?" The real question is.
"What has gone wrong with our
electoral process?" Nixon/Agnew
were elected twice and Reagan/Bush
twice. Our elections are dominated
by sham instead of issues and
produce crooks and pretenders in-

stead of our best statesmen (or
women). Reagan's "landslide" is less
than 20 percent of the American
people (42 million out of 250 mil
lion). 4 minority rules this country,
and it is trying to divide us further:
• Clarence Pendleton, chairman of
the Civil Rights Commission (one of
Reagan's usual "foxes guarding the
henhouse") recently vehemently
attacked blacks for not voting for
Reagan. Dissent is no longer allowed
here? Pendleton, by the way, was on
the board of the bank in San Diego
that let Ed Meese fall 15 months
behind in his mortgage payments.
They are wallowing in cronyism.
Reagan has always said that govern
ment is the problem. His is.
• Good government unites, but we
are being set against each other. The
new "sport" is "bashing" vagrants,
gays or anyone we dislike. It is an
echo of "the master race." And,25
abortion clinics have been bombed
since last January, when Reagan
chose abortion as a trumped-up issue
to distract us from his record.
• Reagan proposes large cuts in
domestic spending to pay for his
deficit and weaponry. Perhaps he
could forgo his salary, as John F.
Kennedy did. and his pensions as
his contribution. And how much
will his four-day inauguration bash
cost us?
• Reagan's only interview since the
election was a warmongering piece in
the Rev. Moon's Washington Times.
Moon recently paid for 400 Ameri
can journalists to go to a conference
in Korea where James Watt spoke.
What is their connection and why is
the lid kept so tightly on all the
questions about Reagan using KAL
-007 to scuttle the peace movement?
Much is hidden behind our grinning
figurehead.

Post Office blues
Along with the joy of sending
packages comes the joy of receiving
them. At Stanford, however, that joy
is often changed to frustration due to
the inefficiency of the local post
office: The tardiness of the mail,
frequent losses, obscure distribution
and ridiculous waiting times call for
an overall extension of the Stanford
post office.
A very annoying consequence of
this inefficiency is the consistent

delay of mail. It takes up to a week
for a letter from Detroit to find its
way into a mailbox here. This can be
extremely frustrating for both the
sender and the receiver: If your mom
stayed up all night to make cookies
to be received by you in time for the
first Advent, she would be upset if
they arrive three days late. And if
you, in turn, are desperately expect
ing those cookies and, instead, find a
yawning emptiness day after day, it
just won't make you merry.
A curious phenomenon of the
Stanford system is that packages
always arrive in piles, even if your
mom made sure to send them on
consecutive days so you would have
something every day.
Among all the problems, the fre
quent loss of mail is the most serious.
A German student at Stanford, for
example, scored a poor two out of
four in receiving letters from his
parents, all of which contained im
portant information as well as
money. The loss of money can lead
to troubled feelings up to complete
panic in the potential receiver, espe
cially if s/he is broke.
Also. I wish somebody could
explain to me why you have to pick
up most parcels at the post office,
while others are mysteriously
deposited at the dorm office, irre
spective of size or weight. You prob
ably have experienced the
excitement of running all the way to
the post office and standing in line
for your first package at Stanford —
just to be told that the slip tightly
grasped by your hand is not from the
post, but the dorm, office!
Finally, we have come to one of
Stanford students' favorite pastimes
— standing in line. In what more
purposeful a way could 30 to 45
minutes be spent, especially if you
only have to write two papers and
run the Dish? It is certainly reward
ing to read all the educational
posters and watch all the interesting
people bursting with the urge to
converse. And finally the delight
when you find the object of all your
efforts is Health Magazine.
The frustration and damage
caused by the inefficiency of the post
office is unacceptable and needs to
be eliminated. Students should ad
dress the representative authorities
as a group to press for a change in
the current situation.
