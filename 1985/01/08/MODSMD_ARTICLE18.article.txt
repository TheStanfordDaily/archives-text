## Dave Dutcher A 						new year in sports 
### 
Since Jason Cole, my co-editor,
beat me to the punch last month
and suggested Christmas gifts for
the sporting community. I decided
to respond b\ offering a few
resolutions for the new vear plus
a week.
For Barry Switzer. football
coach at the University of Okla
homa: For next season, find one
less injury, a couple fewer turn
overs and some guts. I hese would
have won the Sooners the national
championship I believe they —
and others (more on this later) —
deserve. Sorry. I just don't believe
Oklahoma is the sixth-best team in
the land, as they were rated.
Despite Brigham Young Uni
versity s unblemished 13-victory
record, I don t believe the Cougars
would defeat Switzer's Sooners
more than four times if the two
teams were to play 10 games. In
other words, Oklahoma is a better
team than BYU. So, for that mat
ter, are the University of Washing
ton and the University of Florida,
which did not play in a bowl game
because of acts committed against
the oh-so-honorable wishes of the
National Collegiate Athletic Asso
ciation.
Oklahoma lost twice and was
tied once this season. The
Sooners' first loss was to the Uni
versity of Kansas, that (ahem)
renowned football power, after
quarterback Danny Bradley
missed that game due to an injury.
Oklahoma lost to Washington in
the Orange Bowl Jan. 1, thanks to
untimely turnovers in a game that
was far closer than the 28-17 score
indicated.
Finally, guts would've given the
Sooners the undisputed top
ranking. Their tie was to the Uni
versity of Texas after they
declined to run their offense from
deep in their territory against
Texas late in the game, took a
safety and saw the Longhorns
come back and tie the game, 15-
15.
From this situation comes the
next resolution. It's for Switzer
and anyone looking for a lesson in
brains and class. Washington
Coach Don James chose to say
little in favor of his team or against
BYU regarding the national
championship before the Orange
Bowl. Meanwhile, Switzer put
down BYU and plugged his
Sooners. Remember, James'
Huskies will play BYU during the

next two seasons, so let's hear it
lor the Don't-Get-Them-Upset
school of coaching philosophy
On the other hand, here's one
from the no-class department. It's
called the Let's-Grow-Up resolu
tion. and it's for the Oregon State
University basketball fans who
booed UCLA player Dave Immel
each time he touched the ball
during OSU's Pacific 10 Confer
ence victory Thursday. Immel
played high school basketball in
Oregon, and OSU fans apparently
don't like promising basketball
players who leave Oregon.
For the NCAA, department of
football: Let's get some sense. To
sensibly crown a national cham
pion, a "tournament" or a playoff
system is needed in college foot
ball.
Not only is it ridiculous to have
the existing biased sectionalism
when pollsters vote for the na
tional champion and rank teams
during the season, but a playoff
system — as would numerous ones
that have been proposed —
wouldn't mean a loss of bucks to
bowls and to the teams that play in
them.
It wouldn't if the playoff rounds
were played at bowl sites and
treated like bowls, leading to a
championship game for the na
tional title. It wouldn't eliminate
sportswriters, who somehow have
the responsibility of declaring the
champion, if a tournament of 16
or eight teams were chosen based
on their rankings.
For the Bay Area and the Stan
ford community: Be sure to knock
hard on some wood somewhere
regarding the security and hand
ling of the thousands of football
fans who'll descend upon Stanford
Stadium and surrounding areas for
Super Bowl XIX Jan. 20.
The Super Bowl will feature the
San Francisco 49ers and the
Miami Dolphins, undoubtedly the
best two teams in the National
Football League as shown by their
domination of their respective
conference championship vic
tories. All that could spoil what is
potentially the best Super Bowl
matchup (Believe it or not, the
names Blooper Bowl and Blunder
Bowl for the season finale indeed
have had, yawn, foundation.) is
violence or some other unex
pected act that would cast the Bay
Area, San Francisco and Stanford
into a bad light.

into a bad light.

Since Jason Cole, my co-editor,
beat me to the punch last month
and suggested Christmas gifts for
the sporting community. I decided
to respond b\ offering a few
resolutions for the new vear plus
a week.
For Barry Switzer. football
coach at the University of Okla
homa: For next season, find one
less injury, a couple fewer turn
overs and some guts. I hese would
have won the Sooners the national
championship I believe they —
and others (more on this later) —
deserve. Sorry. I just don't believe
Oklahoma is the sixth-best team in
the land, as they were rated.
Despite Brigham Young Uni
versity s unblemished 13-victory
record, I don t believe the Cougars
would defeat Switzer's Sooners
more than four times if the two
teams were to play 10 games. In
other words, Oklahoma is a better
team than BYU. So, for that mat
ter, are the University of Washing
ton and the University of Florida,
which did not play in a bowl game
because of acts committed against
the oh-so-honorable wishes of the
National Collegiate Athletic Asso
ciation.
Oklahoma lost twice and was
tied once this season. The
Sooners' first loss was to the Uni
versity of Kansas, that (ahem)
renowned football power, after
quarterback Danny Bradley
missed that game due to an injury.
Oklahoma lost to Washington in
the Orange Bowl Jan. 1, thanks to
untimely turnovers in a game that
was far closer than the 28-17 score
indicated.
Finally, guts would've given the
Sooners the undisputed top
ranking. Their tie was to the Uni
versity of Texas after they
declined to run their offense from
deep in their territory against
Texas late in the game, took a
safety and saw the Longhorns
come back and tie the game, 15-
15.
From this situation comes the
next resolution. It's for Switzer
and anyone looking for a lesson in
brains and class. Washington
Coach Don James chose to say
little in favor of his team or against
BYU regarding the national
championship before the Orange
Bowl. Meanwhile, Switzer put
down BYU and plugged his
Sooners. Remember, James'
Huskies will play BYU during the

next two seasons, so let's hear it
lor the Don't-Get-Them-Upset
school of coaching philosophy
On the other hand, here's one
from the no-class department. It's
called the Let's-Grow-Up resolu
tion. and it's for the Oregon State
University basketball fans who
booed UCLA player Dave Immel
each time he touched the ball
during OSU's Pacific 10 Confer
ence victory Thursday. Immel
played high school basketball in
Oregon, and OSU fans apparently
don't like promising basketball
players who leave Oregon.
For the NCAA, department of
football: Let's get some sense. To
sensibly crown a national cham
pion, a "tournament" or a playoff
system is needed in college foot
ball.
Not only is it ridiculous to have
the existing biased sectionalism
when pollsters vote for the na
tional champion and rank teams
during the season, but a playoff
system — as would numerous ones
that have been proposed —
wouldn't mean a loss of bucks to
bowls and to the teams that play in
them.
It wouldn't if the playoff rounds
were played at bowl sites and
treated like bowls, leading to a
championship game for the na
tional title. It wouldn't eliminate
sportswriters, who somehow have
the responsibility of declaring the
champion, if a tournament of 16
or eight teams were chosen based
on their rankings.
For the Bay Area and the Stan
ford community: Be sure to knock
hard on some wood somewhere
regarding the security and hand
ling of the thousands of football
fans who'll descend upon Stanford
Stadium and surrounding areas for
Super Bowl XIX Jan. 20.
The Super Bowl will feature the
San Francisco 49ers and the
Miami Dolphins, undoubtedly the
best two teams in the National
Football League as shown by their
domination of their respective
conference championship vic
tories. All that could spoil what is
potentially the best Super Bowl
matchup (Believe it or not, the
names Blooper Bowl and Blunder
Bowl for the season finale indeed
have had, yawn, foundation.) is
violence or some other unex
pected act that would cast the Bay
Area, San Francisco and Stanford
into a bad light.
