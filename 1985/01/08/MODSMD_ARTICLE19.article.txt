# Cardinal faces Oregon Ducks
## Wrestlers open home season 
### PETER CASTILLO Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford wrestling team will open its home
season tonight against the University of Oregon in
Maples Pavilion at 7 p.m.
The Cardinal, which may have its finest team un
der Coach Chris Horpel. has caused a mild stir
among other schools with two exceptional perfor
mances in two ma jor tournaments and a near upset
of Pacific 10 Conference powerhouse Oregon State
last Friday.
"This shall he an interesting matchup for Oregon
is strong where we are." Horpel said. "I feel good

for we are wrestling well and even match should he
close."
But Oregon may be a little fatigued by the in
tense schedule it's had in the past week. At the Doc
Peterson Invitational last Saturday, the Cardinal
took fifth and the Ducks took fourth.
A key matchup will be at 177 pounds with Tom
Mullen. At the Peterson tournament Mullen
finished third and his Oregon counterpart first, al
though they did not face each other.
A big surprise for the Cardinal this year has been
the performance of freshman heavy weight Frank
I.yles. I.vies walked onto the team and into a start
ing spot. His early results were unexpected since he

did not even place in his own state high school meet
last \t»- ■.
"F.ank does not know a lot of technique, hut
wrestles each match with a lot of heart." Horpel
said. "I am really impressed with Frank and he has
a bright future if he continues to work at it."
I-vies is actually a 1 90-pound wrestler competing
as heavyweight because he was the best 011 the
team at that weight. Quickness and power have
compensated for his small si/e. along with his
desire to win.
Other wrestlers to watch for will be early season
standouts Jeff Bradley ( 134 pounds). Scott Wiggen
(150 pounds) and Dave Lee (167 pounds).
