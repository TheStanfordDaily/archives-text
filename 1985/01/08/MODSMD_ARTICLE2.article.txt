# Doctor here faces sex charge
## 
### CLINT HIGHFILL Senior staff writer 
Eugene Farber, chairman of the medical
center's Dermatology Department, was ar
rested Thursday on charges of felony sexual
battery after a patient complained about
Farber's behavior during a Nov. 28 appoint
ment at the Stanford Medical Center.
The patient told police that she went in to
have Farber treat her for psoriasis of the
feet, a skin ailment, but that he gave her a
pelvic examination and later tried to "grab
her and kiss her," according to l.ynne
Johnson, coordinator of the Palo Alto Police
Department's Investigative Services Divi

Medical School Dean David Korn issued
a written statement saying he plans "to look

into the matter promptly and thoroughly"
and report to University President Donald
Kennedy.
Farber is referring all questions regarding
the charges to Tom Nolan, his attorney, and
was unavailable for comment.
Nolan said the charges are "simply not
true."
The police investigation was incomplete,
and failed to note that another doctor, Rich
ard Noodleman, a third-year resident in der
matology, was in the room during the
woman's examination, Nolan said.
"We're dealing with a disturbed individ
ual," Nolan said of the woman pressing the
charges. "He acted totally properly towards
this patient."
Johnson said a phone call from the
woman to Farber, which the police taped.

"substantiated the victim's statements."
In the conversation, Farber implicitly ad
mitted to having conducted a pelvic exam
and admitted to having been alone with the
patient, Johnson said.
"The victim asked Dr. Farber if he
noticed anything wrong during her pelvic
exam, and he said. 'No, there was nothing to
worry about,' " Johnson said.
The pelvic exam was considered signifi
cant because, "Based on our information, it
is not a normal exam performed for psoriasis
of the feet," Johnson said.
In addition, the "phone call did substan
tiate that he had tried to kiss her and that he
grabbed her," Johnson said.
After the pelvic examination, the woman
