# Colleges hope that IRS will reconsider tax break
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” College
administrators and athletic directors
pleaded with the Internal Revenue
Service yesterday to allow a tax
deduction tor scholarship-fund gifts
even il the donor receives preferen
tial seating at football games in
return.
To do otherwise, said representa
tives of the American Council on
Education and the National Col
legiate Athletic Association, would
have a chilling effect on contributions
for education and force schools -to
seek more money from tax revenues.
The educators asked the IRS to kill
a 1 S)S4 ruling that denied a charity
deduction for a contribution to an
athletic scholarship fund because the
donor was put on a waiting list to buy
preferred seats for the college's home
football names. The tax anencx held

simply that the privilege of buying
preferred seats was worth more than
the $300 donation.
The ruling caused such an outcry
from colleges and alumni funds that
the Treasury Department, under
pressure from key members of
Congress, suspended the order until a
public hearing could be held.
At that hearing Monday, the IRS
insisted the ruling simply restated a
long-standing principle: that a contri
bution is a contribution only if noth
ing is received in return.
However, Charles Morgan 111. as
sociate chief counsel, said the IRS
mav need to consider how the ruling
would affect various types of college
giving programs as well as how to
value such benefits as preferred
seating and free stadium parking.
'The law is still what the law was"

before the ruling was issued and
suspended, Morgan said. He said the
agency will act quickly in determining
whether to amend or reimpose the
ruling. He noted that a "revenue
ruling," the technical name for the
holding, applies only to a strictly lim
ited set of circumstances, and that a
change in circumstances might bring a
different result.
The disputed rule referred to a per
son who gave $300 a year to a college
athletic scholarship fund and the only
thing received in return was the right
to purchase a season ticket between
the 40-yard lines for the school's
home games.
The waiting list for those preferred
seats contained 2,000 names: a per
son on the list could buy the ticket
only when one became available and
only by paying an additional S 120.
