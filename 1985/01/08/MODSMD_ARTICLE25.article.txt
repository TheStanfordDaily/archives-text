## 'Cotton Club' a horrendous waste 
### STEVE VINEBERG Daily staff 
In 1920, the first black
heavyweight champ, Jack Johnson,
acquired a new building on the corner
of Lenox and 142 nd Street in New
York City and turned it into an es
tablishment called the Club Deluxe.
When he failed to make a success of
it, the syndicate under the control of
gangster Owen "Owney" Madden,
who was then serving time in Sing
Sing for murder, took it over from
Johnson. Renaming it the Cotton
Club, they sank a goodly amount of
bootleg money into it and staged a
grand opening in the fall of 1923
(some months after Maddens
release).
For the next I 7 years — during the
period of the Harlem Renaissance,
when white socialites and white intel
lectuals "discovered" the black man
— the Cotton Club occupied the key
spot in Harlem night life, and it oc
cupies a significant place in the his
tory of black culture in this country. It
represented the highest plane to
which black performers of the 1920s
and '30s could aspire, in terms of
recognition, yet everyone associated
with the production end of the Cotton
Club shows was white, all the chorus
girls were "high yaller" (light
skinned) until an insistent young
woman named Lucille Wilson broke
the "color bar," and the clientele was
exclusively Caucasian. Under the
management of Herman Stark and a
genial gambler named George "Big
Frenchy" DeMangc, Don Healy
staged a series of elaborately de
signed, elegantly costumed revues
that capitalized on the Negro

stereotypes white audiences had sud
denly begun to delight in — the
plantation darky, the jaz/ baby, the
grinning, loudly dressed Harlem
dandy. But however fake and
deleterious the image of the Negro
propounded by these shows, the tal
ent they offered up was anything but
counterfeit: Bandleaders Duke El
lington, Jimmie Lunceford and Cab
Calloway, dancers Bill "Bojangles"
Robinson, Avon Long and the Nich
olas Brothers, singers Ethel Waters
and Lena Home were among the en
tertainers featured, often in numbers
built around the music of Harold Ar
len, whom Waters dubbed "the
Negro-ist white man" she ever knew.
I he Cotton Club's unique location
at the crossroads of white society and
black culture (which met on the whim
of white savants), of gangland and the
New York aristocracy (which met as a
result of Prohibition), makes it a
great — and until now, untapped —
subject for the movies. When you
read Jim Haskins' rather scattered
but still tantalizing account ("The
Cotton Club: A Pictorial and Social
History of the Most Famous Symbol
of the Jazz Era"), you can imagine a
sumptuous, provocative, deliriously
entertaining musical drama, filled
with fabulous numbers and scintillat
ing personalities and amazing inci
dents— like the one about how Mad
den's boys "arranged" to terminate
Ellington's Philadelphia contract to
get him to New York sooner, or the
story of Lena Home's smuggling her
self out of the club in a crowd of
chorus girls when she quit, because
no one ever walked out on the Cotton
Club. But Francis Ford Coppola di

rected "The Cotton Club,"and he
had a different idea: to star himself,
strr his technical razzle dazzle and his
spendthrift virtuosity — nearly $50
million worth. Squandering money,
squandering the talents of his sizable
cast, Coppola lets what is likely the
richest film material in years slip
through his fingers.
To begin with, the movie isn't
about the Cotton Club, any more
than "Apocalypse Now" was about
Vietnam or "The Outsiders" and
"Rumble Fish" were about
teenagers. The script Coppola and
last year's Pulitzer Prize winner,
William Kennedy, came up with
(after God knows how many revi
sions) has three separate plots, two of
them intertwined. There's the
gangster story, centering on madman
"Dutch" Schultz (James Remar),
who in actuality had only the most
tenuous connection to Owney Mad
den's club (he used to hang out at
Connie's Inn, a rival night spot fur
ther downtown and closer to the Har
lem River), and his inability to keep
out of gang wars, despite Madden's
repeated attempts to play
peacemaker. There's the oddball love
story, in which a white cornettist
named "Dixie" Dunbar (Richard
Gere), adopted by Schultz when he
saves him from a bullet, infringes on
his territory by romancing his
mistress, a hard-boiled 19-year-old
named Vera (Diane Lane) whom
Schultz has set up in her own
nightclub. Dwyer's brother Vince
(Nicolas Cage), making the most of
his connection, becomes first one of
Schultz's henchmen and then, greedy
for some of his boss's wealth, one of
his enemies. Finally there's the other
love story, with a pair of ambitious
black entertainers, tap dancer
"Sandman" Williams (Gregory
Hines), who promotes his black iden
tity, and light-skinned torch singer
Lila Rose (Lonette McKee), who dis
guises hers, as the hero and heroine.
Having made the idiotic decision to
bypass the real story of the Cotton
Club, Coppola and Kennedy might at
least have concentrated on Sandman
and Lila Rose, who are more or less
concocted of bits and pieces of half a
dozen true-life entertainers (Harold
Nicholas, Lena Home and Dorothy
Dandridge among them), and on the
music and dancing. But the
filmmakers handle this affair so hap
hazardly (and Coppola obviously did
so much heavy cutting on this part of
the picture) that we never understand
what's keeping them apart, or why
the state of their relationship is never
the same at the outset of one scene as
it was at the conclusion of the previ
ous one.

Worse — unbelievably — Coppola
shows so little interest in their musical
comedy gifts, which presumably
prompted him to sign them for these
roles, that he keeps shoving them and
the other singers and dancers into the
background. Lonette Mckee does a
feverish rendition of "111 Wind"
(written by Arlen and Ted Koehler),
but that's her only major number.
And does Coppola really think that
when you've got a peerless dancer
like Gregory Hines on screen, there's
something more interesting to cut
away to? Hines hoofs happily with his
brother Maurice (as Sandman's
brother Clay) and does some of the

Coppola had a different idea: to star
himself, star his technical razzle dazzle
and his spendthrift virtuosity — nearly
$50 million worth. Squandering
money, squandering the talents of his
sizable cast, Coppola lets what is likely
the richest film material in years slip
through his fingers.

most glistening solo tapping in movies
since the golden age of M-G-M musi
cals, hut Coppola has other things on
that entrepreneurial mind of his: He
uses Mines' dancing as a point of con
trast for the underworld violence
transpiring outside — and on one oc
casion inside — the club. (In fact, no
violence ever disturbed the patrons of
the Cotton Club in the two decades of
its existence.) When Hines does his
most prodigious dance, a cappella,
Coppola turns it into his big number,
intercutting Hines' feet with a series
of killings as he intercut Michael Cor
leone's son's baptism with the
revenge murders in "The Godfath
er." He wants to remind us that he's
still the Godfather of Hollywood,
commanding all the action from his
director's chair, and to illustrate his
(highly dubious) thesis: that whites
express their anger through violence
while blacks release theirs through
popular art. He must be proud of this
deduction — it's the only idea in the
whole two-and-a-half-hour movie.
By calling attention to his own
cleverness in this way, he minimizes
our enjoyment of the performers —
our chief reason for going to see this

picture in the first place. He comes
close to spoiling a joyous,
spontaneous-looking display of clas
sical tap by Charles "Honi" Coles
and others, too. by trying to top it
with his own flashy demonstration of
directing and editing; he throws every
shot in our faces.
The gangster story is old hat, and it
has the unpleasant flavor of self
indulgence — both for the maker of
the "Godfather" pictures and for the
writer whose "Albany trilogy"
abounds with mobsters. (One scene,
in which Schultz's wife catches him
squiring Vera, has the central triangle
of kennedv's first novel, "Legs," as

its antecedent.) Reprising "The God
father" wouldn't be so painful, I
suppose, if Coppola still made movies
the way he did in the early '70s. in the
style of Renoir, honoring his actors
and respecting his audience by
keeping his camera at a distance so
that we could take in an entire room
at a glance and choose where first to
cast our eyes. But when he got lost in
that jungle in "Apocalypse Now," the
first piece of luggage Coppola threw
away was the long shot. Since then,
his prime medium has been the close
up, which he uses in tandem with a
quantity of loud, undisciplined, over
lapping improvisation. He may think
he serves his actors by letting them
overact in overlong, unshaped group
scenes, but he isn't doing Nicolas
Cage or James Remar (both of whom
have turned in creditable work under
other directors) any favors.
l uckily, not everyone in the film
seems to be vulnerable to Coppola's
intemperance. As Frenchy DeMange,
Fred Gwynne utilizes that hanging
sausage face to superb comic effect;
with his thinning hair slicked down

for many years and only recently ac
corded the praise it deserves. Victor
Sjostrom, the Swedish emigre Lillian
Ciish had hand-picked to direct her in
the (magnificent) film version of
"The Scarlet Letter" — and, inciden
tally, the old man in Bergman's "Wild
Strawberries" — made this film about
a young woman who ventures out
into the Midwest, to an unhappy mar
riage and the unwelcome advances of
a rake. Lillian Ciish's performance is a
startlingly modern study of neurosis
produced by environment.
"The Women" (1939; Jan. 26):
Audiences adore this movie, which is
performed by a stellar cast consisting
of many of the most interesting
females of the period: Joan Craw
ford. Rosalind Russell, Paulette God
dard, Ruth Hussey, Mary Boland,
Marjorie Main, Butterfly McQueen,
Phyllis Povah, Virginia Grey, young
Virginia Weidler — and, unfortun
ately, Norma Shearer and Joan Fon
taine. It is not an especially flattering
portrait of women; one of the themes
is that, given the chance, women will
destroy each other's homes through
malicious gossip and envy. But the
script by Anita Loos and Jane Murfen
(adapted from the stage play by
Claire Boothe) is too lighthearted to
be taken very seriously. The fairly
stylish direction is by George C'ukor.
"Libeled Lady" (1936; Feb. 7):
This wisecracking comedy ought to
be a classic. In order to save his paper
from a libel suit, managing editor
Spencer Tracy hires suave William
Powell to woo the plaintiff, heiress
Myrna Loy, and persuades his own
long-suffering fiancee, Jean Harlow,
to wed Powell and then raise a stink
about the affair, placing Loy in an
embarrassing position. Still follow
ing? Of course, Powell really falls for
Loy, and Harlow falls for Powell —
and the screenwriters have to race to
patch everything up in the last reel.
(The patching is rather obvious.) All
four stars are at the top of their
respective forms — Myrna Loy is es
pecially fine — and the dialogue (by
Maurinc Watkins, Howard Emmett
Rogers and George Oppenheimer) is
delightful. Jack Conway directed.

and parted in the middle, he's an art
deco caricature. And when Bob Hos
kins (as Owney Madden) and the
Living Theatre's Julian Beck (as
Dutch Schultz's top underling. Saul)
overact, they do so with panache.
Gwynne and Hoskins — whose
clenched, hoarse voice is almost as
witty as the cartoon New York accent
he put on as Nathan Detroit in the
National Theatre of Great Britain
production of "Guys and Dolls" —
share one of the two scenes in "The
Cotton Club" that we can get close
to. a humorous reaffirmation of their
friendship after Madden, kidnaped by
Vince and held for ransom, returns
unharmed. The other affecting scene
is the Williams brothers' reunion
after Sandman's aggressiveness and
ego have split them up. (Hines
reports that he and his brother
Maurice experienced a similar rift in
their relationship, which may account
in part for the Tightness of the mo
ment on screen.)
The Dixie-Vera plot is the movie's
great unsolved riddle. Since no white
musician ever played at the Cotton
Club, what the hell is a white horn
player doing in the leading role of a
film set there? Coppola and Kennedy
don't violate history much in this case
— Dixie only sits in with the band
once, on a special occasion — so
wherever they place him, in Dutch's
entourage or in Hollywood starring in
Cagney-type roles, they can't really
explain his presence. As usual, Rich
ard Gere's self-consciousness, all
licensed by Coppola's direction,
doesn't help to cluiify things in the
least: Gere's grabbag of peculiar
mannerisms is so full to bursting, es
pecially when he tries to play hip, that
he seems to belong on another planet.
As for Diane Lane, her character is so
misplaced in this movie that Coppola
and Kennedy move her to another
club altogether. Saddled with a

couple of wigs (Louise Brooks
brunette and platinum blonde) that
don't flatter her. and the worst lines
in the movie (she actually calls Gere
"my very, very lover" at one point).
Lane comes off as an even bigger hole
in the screen here than she did as the
abducted rock star who sang those
boring songs in "Streets of Fire."
These two non-characters have a
non-love scene that ranks with the
greatest follies Coppola has master
minded over the last several years
(like the red and blue fish sitting in
the middle of the black and white
frame in "Rumble Fish"): They ap
pear to be having sex under an enor
mous mesh stocking.
If I sound angry about this movie,
it's because it's such a horrendous
waste: No one is going to make
another movie about the Cotton
Club, at least not for a long while.
With the resources Coppola had at
his disposal, there was no reason for
reducing the material to self-reflexive
banalities. From the glimpses we get
of the production numbers, he or his
choreographers (Michael Smuin of
the San Francisco Ballet heads the list
in the credits) seem to have under
stood the period and the style of
those revues, and some strong jazz
voices — Prisci 11a Baskerville 011 El
lington's "Creole Love Call" and
Sydney Goldsmith on "Barbecue" —
soar triumphantly above the gun
shots. Probably Coppola was trying to
be "mythic" again (as he was in his
last musical, "One from the Heart")
by reverting to the Hollywood
pictures of an earlier epoch and then
enlarging them, in this case the
gangster melodrama/jazz musical
melees Warner Brothers made a
fairly entertaining stab at in the '40s
("Blues in the Night," "The Man I
Love"). Simply changing the size of a
genre without rethinking its meaning
leaves it stranded in no man's land,
though. Too outsize to be modestly
enjoyable, too shallow to be
memorable, "The Cotton Club" is a
tinselly tribute to a time that never
existed.

last musical, "One from the Heart")
by reverting to the Hollywood
pictures of an earlier epoch and then
enlarging them, in this case the
gangster melodrama/jazz musical
melees Warner Brothers made a
fairly entertaining stab at in the '40s
("Blues in the Night," "The Man I
Love"). Simply changing the size of a
genre without rethinking its meaning
leaves it stranded in no man's land,
though. Too outsize to be modestly
enjoyable, too shallow to be
memorable, "The Cotton Club" is a
tinselly tribute to a time that never
existed.


Couples dance in one of the lavish scenes from M-G-M's "The Merry Widow."
In 1920, the first black
heavyweight champ, Jack Johnson,
acquired a new building on the corner
of Lenox and 142 nd Street in New
York City and turned it into an es
tablishment called the Club Deluxe.
When he failed to make a success of
it, the syndicate under the control of
gangster Owen "Owney" Madden,
who was then serving time in Sing
Sing for murder, took it over from
Johnson. Renaming it the Cotton
Club, they sank a goodly amount of
bootleg money into it and staged a
grand opening in the fall of 1923
(some months after Maddens
release).
For the next I 7 years — during the
period of the Harlem Renaissance,
when white socialites and white intel
lectuals "discovered" the black man
— the Cotton Club occupied the key
spot in Harlem night life, and it oc
cupies a significant place in the his
tory of black culture in this country. It
represented the highest plane to
which black performers of the 1920s
and '30s could aspire, in terms of
recognition, yet everyone associated
with the production end of the Cotton
Club shows was white, all the chorus
girls were "high yaller" (light
skinned) until an insistent young
woman named Lucille Wilson broke
the "color bar," and the clientele was
exclusively Caucasian. Under the
management of Herman Stark and a
genial gambler named George "Big
Frenchy" DeMangc, Don Healy
staged a series of elaborately de
signed, elegantly costumed revues
that capitalized on the Negro

stereotypes white audiences had sud
denly begun to delight in — the
plantation darky, the jaz/ baby, the
grinning, loudly dressed Harlem
dandy. But however fake and
deleterious the image of the Negro
propounded by these shows, the tal
ent they offered up was anything but
counterfeit: Bandleaders Duke El
lington, Jimmie Lunceford and Cab
Calloway, dancers Bill "Bojangles"
Robinson, Avon Long and the Nich
olas Brothers, singers Ethel Waters
and Lena Home were among the en
tertainers featured, often in numbers
built around the music of Harold Ar
len, whom Waters dubbed "the
Negro-ist white man" she ever knew.
I he Cotton Club's unique location
at the crossroads of white society and
black culture (which met on the whim
of white savants), of gangland and the
New York aristocracy (which met as a
result of Prohibition), makes it a
great — and until now, untapped —
subject for the movies. When you
read Jim Haskins' rather scattered
but still tantalizing account ("The
Cotton Club: A Pictorial and Social
History of the Most Famous Symbol
of the Jazz Era"), you can imagine a
sumptuous, provocative, deliriously
entertaining musical drama, filled
with fabulous numbers and scintillat
ing personalities and amazing inci
dents— like the one about how Mad
den's boys "arranged" to terminate
Ellington's Philadelphia contract to
get him to New York sooner, or the
story of Lena Home's smuggling her
self out of the club in a crowd of
chorus girls when she quit, because
no one ever walked out on the Cotton
Club. But Francis Ford Coppola di

rected "The Cotton Club,"and he
had a different idea: to star himself,
strr his technical razzle dazzle and his
spendthrift virtuosity — nearly $50
million worth. Squandering money,
squandering the talents of his sizable
cast, Coppola lets what is likely the
richest film material in years slip
through his fingers.
To begin with, the movie isn't
about the Cotton Club, any more
than "Apocalypse Now" was about
Vietnam or "The Outsiders" and
"Rumble Fish" were about
teenagers. The script Coppola and
last year's Pulitzer Prize winner,
William Kennedy, came up with
(after God knows how many revi
sions) has three separate plots, two of
them intertwined. There's the
gangster story, centering on madman
"Dutch" Schultz (James Remar),
who in actuality had only the most
tenuous connection to Owney Mad
den's club (he used to hang out at
Connie's Inn, a rival night spot fur
ther downtown and closer to the Har
lem River), and his inability to keep
out of gang wars, despite Madden's
repeated attempts to play
peacemaker. There's the oddball love
story, in which a white cornettist
named "Dixie" Dunbar (Richard
Gere), adopted by Schultz when he
saves him from a bullet, infringes on
his territory by romancing his
mistress, a hard-boiled 19-year-old
named Vera (Diane Lane) whom
Schultz has set up in her own
nightclub. Dwyer's brother Vince
(Nicolas Cage), making the most of
his connection, becomes first one of
Schultz's henchmen and then, greedy
for some of his boss's wealth, one of
his enemies. Finally there's the other
love story, with a pair of ambitious
black entertainers, tap dancer
"Sandman" Williams (Gregory
Hines), who promotes his black iden
tity, and light-skinned torch singer
Lila Rose (Lonette McKee), who dis
guises hers, as the hero and heroine.
Having made the idiotic decision to
bypass the real story of the Cotton
Club, Coppola and Kennedy might at
least have concentrated on Sandman
and Lila Rose, who are more or less
concocted of bits and pieces of half a
dozen true-life entertainers (Harold
Nicholas, Lena Home and Dorothy
Dandridge among them), and on the
music and dancing. But the
filmmakers handle this affair so hap
hazardly (and Coppola obviously did
so much heavy cutting on this part of
the picture) that we never understand
what's keeping them apart, or why
the state of their relationship is never
the same at the outset of one scene as
it was at the conclusion of the previ
ous one.

Worse — unbelievably — Coppola
shows so little interest in their musical
comedy gifts, which presumably
prompted him to sign them for these
roles, that he keeps shoving them and
the other singers and dancers into the
background. Lonette Mckee does a
feverish rendition of "111 Wind"
(written by Arlen and Ted Koehler),
but that's her only major number.
And does Coppola really think that
when you've got a peerless dancer
like Gregory Hines on screen, there's
something more interesting to cut
away to? Hines hoofs happily with his
brother Maurice (as Sandman's
brother Clay) and does some of the

Coppola had a different idea: to star
himself, star his technical razzle dazzle
and his spendthrift virtuosity — nearly
$50 million worth. Squandering
money, squandering the talents of his
sizable cast, Coppola lets what is likely
the richest film material in years slip
through his fingers.

most glistening solo tapping in movies
since the golden age of M-G-M musi
cals, hut Coppola has other things on
that entrepreneurial mind of his: He
uses Mines' dancing as a point of con
trast for the underworld violence
transpiring outside — and on one oc
casion inside — the club. (In fact, no
violence ever disturbed the patrons of
the Cotton Club in the two decades of
its existence.) When Hines does his
most prodigious dance, a cappella,
Coppola turns it into his big number,
intercutting Hines' feet with a series
of killings as he intercut Michael Cor
leone's son's baptism with the
revenge murders in "The Godfath
er." He wants to remind us that he's
still the Godfather of Hollywood,
commanding all the action from his
director's chair, and to illustrate his
(highly dubious) thesis: that whites
express their anger through violence
while blacks release theirs through
popular art. He must be proud of this
deduction — it's the only idea in the
whole two-and-a-half-hour movie.
By calling attention to his own
cleverness in this way, he minimizes
our enjoyment of the performers —
our chief reason for going to see this

picture in the first place. He comes
close to spoiling a joyous,
spontaneous-looking display of clas
sical tap by Charles "Honi" Coles
and others, too. by trying to top it
with his own flashy demonstration of
directing and editing; he throws every
shot in our faces.
The gangster story is old hat, and it
has the unpleasant flavor of self
indulgence — both for the maker of
the "Godfather" pictures and for the
writer whose "Albany trilogy"
abounds with mobsters. (One scene,
in which Schultz's wife catches him
squiring Vera, has the central triangle
of kennedv's first novel, "Legs," as

its antecedent.) Reprising "The God
father" wouldn't be so painful, I
suppose, if Coppola still made movies
the way he did in the early '70s. in the
style of Renoir, honoring his actors
and respecting his audience by
keeping his camera at a distance so
that we could take in an entire room
at a glance and choose where first to
cast our eyes. But when he got lost in
that jungle in "Apocalypse Now," the
first piece of luggage Coppola threw
away was the long shot. Since then,
his prime medium has been the close
up, which he uses in tandem with a
quantity of loud, undisciplined, over
lapping improvisation. He may think
he serves his actors by letting them
overact in overlong, unshaped group
scenes, but he isn't doing Nicolas
Cage or James Remar (both of whom
have turned in creditable work under
other directors) any favors.
l uckily, not everyone in the film
seems to be vulnerable to Coppola's
intemperance. As Frenchy DeMange,
Fred Gwynne utilizes that hanging
sausage face to superb comic effect;
with his thinning hair slicked down

for many years and only recently ac
corded the praise it deserves. Victor
Sjostrom, the Swedish emigre Lillian
Ciish had hand-picked to direct her in
the (magnificent) film version of
"The Scarlet Letter" — and, inciden
tally, the old man in Bergman's "Wild
Strawberries" — made this film about
a young woman who ventures out
into the Midwest, to an unhappy mar
riage and the unwelcome advances of
a rake. Lillian Ciish's performance is a
startlingly modern study of neurosis
produced by environment.
"The Women" (1939; Jan. 26):
Audiences adore this movie, which is
performed by a stellar cast consisting
of many of the most interesting
females of the period: Joan Craw
ford. Rosalind Russell, Paulette God
dard, Ruth Hussey, Mary Boland,
Marjorie Main, Butterfly McQueen,
Phyllis Povah, Virginia Grey, young
Virginia Weidler — and, unfortun
ately, Norma Shearer and Joan Fon
taine. It is not an especially flattering
portrait of women; one of the themes
is that, given the chance, women will
destroy each other's homes through
malicious gossip and envy. But the
script by Anita Loos and Jane Murfen
(adapted from the stage play by
Claire Boothe) is too lighthearted to
be taken very seriously. The fairly
stylish direction is by George C'ukor.
"Libeled Lady" (1936; Feb. 7):
This wisecracking comedy ought to
be a classic. In order to save his paper
from a libel suit, managing editor
Spencer Tracy hires suave William
Powell to woo the plaintiff, heiress
Myrna Loy, and persuades his own
long-suffering fiancee, Jean Harlow,
to wed Powell and then raise a stink
about the affair, placing Loy in an
embarrassing position. Still follow
ing? Of course, Powell really falls for
Loy, and Harlow falls for Powell —
and the screenwriters have to race to
patch everything up in the last reel.
(The patching is rather obvious.) All
four stars are at the top of their
respective forms — Myrna Loy is es
pecially fine — and the dialogue (by
Maurinc Watkins, Howard Emmett
Rogers and George Oppenheimer) is
delightful. Jack Conway directed.

and parted in the middle, he's an art
deco caricature. And when Bob Hos
kins (as Owney Madden) and the
Living Theatre's Julian Beck (as
Dutch Schultz's top underling. Saul)
overact, they do so with panache.
Gwynne and Hoskins — whose
clenched, hoarse voice is almost as
witty as the cartoon New York accent
he put on as Nathan Detroit in the
National Theatre of Great Britain
production of "Guys and Dolls" —
share one of the two scenes in "The
Cotton Club" that we can get close
to. a humorous reaffirmation of their
friendship after Madden, kidnaped by
Vince and held for ransom, returns
unharmed. The other affecting scene
is the Williams brothers' reunion
after Sandman's aggressiveness and
ego have split them up. (Hines
reports that he and his brother
Maurice experienced a similar rift in
their relationship, which may account
in part for the Tightness of the mo
ment on screen.)
The Dixie-Vera plot is the movie's
great unsolved riddle. Since no white
musician ever played at the Cotton
Club, what the hell is a white horn
player doing in the leading role of a
film set there? Coppola and Kennedy
don't violate history much in this case
— Dixie only sits in with the band
once, on a special occasion — so
wherever they place him, in Dutch's
entourage or in Hollywood starring in
Cagney-type roles, they can't really
explain his presence. As usual, Rich
ard Gere's self-consciousness, all
licensed by Coppola's direction,
doesn't help to cluiify things in the
least: Gere's grabbag of peculiar
mannerisms is so full to bursting, es
pecially when he tries to play hip, that
he seems to belong on another planet.
As for Diane Lane, her character is so
misplaced in this movie that Coppola
and Kennedy move her to another
club altogether. Saddled with a

couple of wigs (Louise Brooks
brunette and platinum blonde) that
don't flatter her. and the worst lines
in the movie (she actually calls Gere
"my very, very lover" at one point).
Lane comes off as an even bigger hole
in the screen here than she did as the
abducted rock star who sang those
boring songs in "Streets of Fire."
These two non-characters have a
non-love scene that ranks with the
greatest follies Coppola has master
minded over the last several years
(like the red and blue fish sitting in
the middle of the black and white
frame in "Rumble Fish"): They ap
pear to be having sex under an enor
mous mesh stocking.
If I sound angry about this movie,
it's because it's such a horrendous
waste: No one is going to make
another movie about the Cotton
Club, at least not for a long while.
With the resources Coppola had at
his disposal, there was no reason for
reducing the material to self-reflexive
banalities. From the glimpses we get
of the production numbers, he or his
choreographers (Michael Smuin of
the San Francisco Ballet heads the list
in the credits) seem to have under
stood the period and the style of
those revues, and some strong jazz
voices — Prisci 11a Baskerville 011 El
lington's "Creole Love Call" and
Sydney Goldsmith on "Barbecue" —
soar triumphantly above the gun
shots. Probably Coppola was trying to
be "mythic" again (as he was in his
last musical, "One from the Heart")
by reverting to the Hollywood
pictures of an earlier epoch and then
enlarging them, in this case the
gangster melodrama/jazz musical
melees Warner Brothers made a
fairly entertaining stab at in the '40s

With the resources Coppola had at
his disposal, there was no reason for
reducing the material to self-reflexive
banalities. From the glimpses we get
of the production numbers, he or his
choreographers (Michael Smuin of
the San Francisco Ballet heads the list
in the credits) seem to have under
stood the period and the style of
those revues, and some strong jazz
voices — Prisci 11a Baskerville 011 El
lington's "Creole Love Call" and
Sydney Goldsmith on "Barbecue" —
soar triumphantly above the gun
shots. Probably Coppola was trying to
be "mythic" again (as he was in his
last musical, "One from the Heart")
by reverting to the Hollywood
pictures of an earlier epoch and then
enlarging them, in this case the
gangster melodrama/jazz musical
melees Warner Brothers made a
fairly entertaining stab at in the '40s
("Blues in the Night," "The Man I
Love"). Simply changing the size of a
genre without rethinking its meaning
leaves it stranded in no man's land,
though. Too outsize to be modestly
enjoyable, too shallow to be
memorable, "The Cotton Club" is a
tinselly tribute to a time that never
existed.


Couples dance in one of the lavish scenes from M-G-M's "The Merry Widow."
In 1920, the first black
heavyweight champ, Jack Johnson,
acquired a new building on the corner
of Lenox and 142 nd Street in New
York City and turned it into an es
tablishment called the Club Deluxe.
When he failed to make a success of
it, the syndicate under the control of
gangster Owen "Owney" Madden,
who was then serving time in Sing
Sing for murder, took it over from
Johnson. Renaming it the Cotton
Club, they sank a goodly amount of
bootleg money into it and staged a
grand opening in the fall of 1923
(some months after Maddens
release).
For the next I 7 years — during the
period of the Harlem Renaissance,
when white socialites and white intel
lectuals "discovered" the black man
— the Cotton Club occupied the key
spot in Harlem night life, and it oc
cupies a significant place in the his
tory of black culture in this country. It
represented the highest plane to
which black performers of the 1920s
and '30s could aspire, in terms of
recognition, yet everyone associated
with the production end of the Cotton
Club shows was white, all the chorus
girls were "high yaller" (light
skinned) until an insistent young
woman named Lucille Wilson broke
the "color bar," and the clientele was
exclusively Caucasian. Under the
management of Herman Stark and a
genial gambler named George "Big
Frenchy" DeMangc, Don Healy
staged a series of elaborately de
signed, elegantly costumed revues
that capitalized on the Negro

stereotypes white audiences had sud
denly begun to delight in — the
plantation darky, the jaz/ baby, the
grinning, loudly dressed Harlem
dandy. But however fake and
deleterious the image of the Negro
propounded by these shows, the tal
ent they offered up was anything but
counterfeit: Bandleaders Duke El
lington, Jimmie Lunceford and Cab
Calloway, dancers Bill "Bojangles"
Robinson, Avon Long and the Nich
olas Brothers, singers Ethel Waters
and Lena Home were among the en
tertainers featured, often in numbers
built around the music of Harold Ar
len, whom Waters dubbed "the
Negro-ist white man" she ever knew.
I he Cotton Club's unique location
at the crossroads of white society and
black culture (which met on the whim
of white savants), of gangland and the
New York aristocracy (which met as a
result of Prohibition), makes it a
great — and until now, untapped —
subject for the movies. When you
read Jim Haskins' rather scattered
but still tantalizing account ("The
Cotton Club: A Pictorial and Social
History of the Most Famous Symbol
of the Jazz Era"), you can imagine a
sumptuous, provocative, deliriously
entertaining musical drama, filled
with fabulous numbers and scintillat
ing personalities and amazing inci
dents— like the one about how Mad
den's boys "arranged" to terminate
Ellington's Philadelphia contract to
get him to New York sooner, or the
story of Lena Home's smuggling her
self out of the club in a crowd of
chorus girls when she quit, because
no one ever walked out on the Cotton
Club. But Francis Ford Coppola di

rected "The Cotton Club,"and he
had a different idea: to star himself,
strr his technical razzle dazzle and his
spendthrift virtuosity — nearly $50
million worth. Squandering money,
squandering the talents of his sizable
cast, Coppola lets what is likely the
richest film material in years slip
through his fingers.
To begin with, the movie isn't
about the Cotton Club, any more
than "Apocalypse Now" was about
Vietnam or "The Outsiders" and
"Rumble Fish" were about
teenagers. The script Coppola and
last year's Pulitzer Prize winner,
William Kennedy, came up with
(after God knows how many revi
sions) has three separate plots, two of
them intertwined. There's the
gangster story, centering on madman
"Dutch" Schultz (James Remar),
who in actuality had only the most
tenuous connection to Owney Mad
den's club (he used to hang out at
Connie's Inn, a rival night spot fur
ther downtown and closer to the Har
lem River), and his inability to keep
out of gang wars, despite Madden's
repeated attempts to play
peacemaker. There's the oddball love
story, in which a white cornettist
named "Dixie" Dunbar (Richard
Gere), adopted by Schultz when he
saves him from a bullet, infringes on
his territory by romancing his
mistress, a hard-boiled 19-year-old
named Vera (Diane Lane) whom
Schultz has set up in her own
nightclub. Dwyer's brother Vince
(Nicolas Cage), making the most of
his connection, becomes first one of
Schultz's henchmen and then, greedy
for some of his boss's wealth, one of
his enemies. Finally there's the other
love story, with a pair of ambitious
black entertainers, tap dancer
"Sandman" Williams (Gregory
Hines), who promotes his black iden
tity, and light-skinned torch singer
Lila Rose (Lonette McKee), who dis
guises hers, as the hero and heroine.
Having made the idiotic decision to
bypass the real story of the Cotton
Club, Coppola and Kennedy might at
least have concentrated on Sandman
and Lila Rose, who are more or less
concocted of bits and pieces of half a
dozen true-life entertainers (Harold
Nicholas, Lena Home and Dorothy
Dandridge among them), and on the
music and dancing. But the
filmmakers handle this affair so hap
hazardly (and Coppola obviously did
so much heavy cutting on this part of
the picture) that we never understand
what's keeping them apart, or why
the state of their relationship is never
the same at the outset of one scene as
it was at the conclusion of the previ
ous one.

Worse — unbelievably — Coppola
shows so little interest in their musical
comedy gifts, which presumably
prompted him to sign them for these
roles, that he keeps shoving them and
the other singers and dancers into the
background. Lonette Mckee does a
feverish rendition of "111 Wind"
(written by Arlen and Ted Koehler),
but that's her only major number.
And does Coppola really think that
when you've got a peerless dancer
like Gregory Hines on screen, there's
something more interesting to cut
away to? Hines hoofs happily with his
brother Maurice (as Sandman's
brother Clay) and does some of the

Coppola had a different idea: to star
himself, star his technical razzle dazzle
and his spendthrift virtuosity — nearly
$50 million worth. Squandering
money, squandering the talents of his
sizable cast, Coppola lets what is likely
the richest film material in years slip
through his fingers.

most glistening solo tapping in movies
since the golden age of M-G-M musi
cals, hut Coppola has other things on
that entrepreneurial mind of his: He
uses Mines' dancing as a point of con
trast for the underworld violence
transpiring outside — and on one oc
casion inside — the club. (In fact, no
violence ever disturbed the patrons of
the Cotton Club in the two decades of
its existence.) When Hines does his
most prodigious dance, a cappella,
Coppola turns it into his big number,
intercutting Hines' feet with a series
of killings as he intercut Michael Cor
leone's son's baptism with the
revenge murders in "The Godfath
er." He wants to remind us that he's
still the Godfather of Hollywood,
commanding all the action from his
director's chair, and to illustrate his
(highly dubious) thesis: that whites
express their anger through violence
while blacks release theirs through
popular art. He must be proud of this
deduction — it's the only idea in the
whole two-and-a-half-hour movie.
By calling attention to his own
cleverness in this way, he minimizes
our enjoyment of the performers —
our chief reason for going to see this

picture in the first place. He comes
close to spoiling a joyous,
spontaneous-looking display of clas
sical tap by Charles "Honi" Coles
and others, too. by trying to top it
with his own flashy demonstration of
directing and editing; he throws every
shot in our faces.
The gangster story is old hat, and it
has the unpleasant flavor of self
indulgence — both for the maker of
the "Godfather" pictures and for the
writer whose "Albany trilogy"
abounds with mobsters. (One scene,
in which Schultz's wife catches him
squiring Vera, has the central triangle
of kennedv's first novel, "Legs," as

its antecedent.) Reprising "The God
father" wouldn't be so painful, I
suppose, if Coppola still made movies
the way he did in the early '70s. in the
style of Renoir, honoring his actors
and respecting his audience by
keeping his camera at a distance so
that we could take in an entire room
at a glance and choose where first to
cast our eyes. But when he got lost in
that jungle in "Apocalypse Now," the
first piece of luggage Coppola threw
away was the long shot. Since then,
his prime medium has been the close
up, which he uses in tandem with a
quantity of loud, undisciplined, over
lapping improvisation. He may think
he serves his actors by letting them
overact in overlong, unshaped group
scenes, but he isn't doing Nicolas
Cage or James Remar (both of whom
have turned in creditable work under
other directors) any favors.
l uckily, not everyone in the film
seems to be vulnerable to Coppola's
intemperance. As Frenchy DeMange,
Fred Gwynne utilizes that hanging
sausage face to superb comic effect;
with his thinning hair slicked down

for many years and only recently ac
corded the praise it deserves. Victor
Sjostrom, the Swedish emigre Lillian
Ciish had hand-picked to direct her in
the (magnificent) film version of
"The Scarlet Letter" — and, inciden
tally, the old man in Bergman's "Wild
Strawberries" — made this film about
a young woman who ventures out
into the Midwest, to an unhappy mar
riage and the unwelcome advances of
a rake. Lillian Ciish's performance is a
startlingly modern study of neurosis
produced by environment.
"The Women" (1939; Jan. 26):
Audiences adore this movie, which is
performed by a stellar cast consisting
of many of the most interesting
females of the period: Joan Craw
ford. Rosalind Russell, Paulette God
dard, Ruth Hussey, Mary Boland,
Marjorie Main, Butterfly McQueen,
Phyllis Povah, Virginia Grey, young
Virginia Weidler — and, unfortun
ately, Norma Shearer and Joan Fon
taine. It is not an especially flattering
portrait of women; one of the themes
is that, given the chance, women will
destroy each other's homes through
malicious gossip and envy. But the
script by Anita Loos and Jane Murfen
(adapted from the stage play by
Claire Boothe) is too lighthearted to
be taken very seriously. The fairly
stylish direction is by George C'ukor.
"Libeled Lady" (1936; Feb. 7):
This wisecracking comedy ought to
be a classic. In order to save his paper
from a libel suit, managing editor
Spencer Tracy hires suave William
Powell to woo the plaintiff, heiress
Myrna Loy, and persuades his own
long-suffering fiancee, Jean Harlow,
to wed Powell and then raise a stink
about the affair, placing Loy in an
embarrassing position. Still follow
ing? Of course, Powell really falls for
Loy, and Harlow falls for Powell —
and the screenwriters have to race to
patch everything up in the last reel.
(The patching is rather obvious.) All
four stars are at the top of their
respective forms — Myrna Loy is es
pecially fine — and the dialogue (by
Maurinc Watkins, Howard Emmett
Rogers and George Oppenheimer) is
delightful. Jack Conway directed.

and parted in the middle, he's an art
deco caricature. And when Bob Hos
kins (as Owney Madden) and the
Living Theatre's Julian Beck (as
Dutch Schultz's top underling. Saul)
overact, they do so with panache.
Gwynne and Hoskins — whose
clenched, hoarse voice is almost as
witty as the cartoon New York accent
he put on as Nathan Detroit in the
National Theatre of Great Britain
production of "Guys and Dolls" —
share one of the two scenes in "The
Cotton Club" that we can get close
to. a humorous reaffirmation of their
friendship after Madden, kidnaped by
Vince and held for ransom, returns
unharmed. The other affecting scene
is the Williams brothers' reunion
after Sandman's aggressiveness and
ego have split them up. (Hines
reports that he and his brother
Maurice experienced a similar rift in
their relationship, which may account
in part for the Tightness of the mo
ment on screen.)
The Dixie-Vera plot is the movie's
great unsolved riddle. Since no white
musician ever played at the Cotton
Club, what the hell is a white horn
player doing in the leading role of a
film set there? Coppola and Kennedy
don't violate history much in this case
— Dixie only sits in with the band
once, on a special occasion — so
wherever they place him, in Dutch's
entourage or in Hollywood starring in
Cagney-type roles, they can't really
explain his presence. As usual, Rich
ard Gere's self-consciousness, all
licensed by Coppola's direction,
doesn't help to cluiify things in the
least: Gere's grabbag of peculiar
mannerisms is so full to bursting, es
pecially when he tries to play hip, that
he seems to belong on another planet.
As for Diane Lane, her character is so
misplaced in this movie that Coppola
and Kennedy move her to another
club altogether. Saddled with a

couple of wigs (Louise Brooks
brunette and platinum blonde) that
don't flatter her. and the worst lines
in the movie (she actually calls Gere
"my very, very lover" at one point).
Lane comes off as an even bigger hole
in the screen here than she did as the
abducted rock star who sang those
boring songs in "Streets of Fire."
These two non-characters have a
non-love scene that ranks with the
greatest follies Coppola has master
minded over the last several years
(like the red and blue fish sitting in
the middle of the black and white
frame in "Rumble Fish"): They ap
pear to be having sex under an enor
mous mesh stocking.
If I sound angry about this movie,
it's because it's such a horrendous
waste: No one is going to make
another movie about the Cotton
Club, at least not for a long while.
With the resources Coppola had at
his disposal, there was no reason for
reducing the material to self-reflexive
banalities. From the glimpses we get

in the screen here than she did as the
abducted rock star who sang those
boring songs in "Streets of Fire."
These two non-characters have a
non-love scene that ranks with the
greatest follies Coppola has master
minded over the last several years
(like the red and blue fish sitting in
the middle of the black and white
frame in "Rumble Fish"): They ap
pear to be having sex under an enor
mous mesh stocking.
If I sound angry about this movie,
it's because it's such a horrendous
waste: No one is going to make
another movie about the Cotton
Club, at least not for a long while.
With the resources Coppola had at
his disposal, there was no reason for
reducing the material to self-reflexive
banalities. From the glimpses we get
of the production numbers, he or his
choreographers (Michael Smuin of
the San Francisco Ballet heads the list
in the credits) seem to have under
stood the period and the style of
those revues, and some strong jazz
voices — Prisci 11a Baskerville 011 El
lington's "Creole Love Call" and
Sydney Goldsmith on "Barbecue" —
soar triumphantly above the gun
shots. Probably Coppola was trying to
be "mythic" again (as he was in his
last musical, "One from the Heart")
by reverting to the Hollywood
pictures of an earlier epoch and then
enlarging them, in this case the
gangster melodrama/jazz musical
melees Warner Brothers made a
fairly entertaining stab at in the '40s
("Blues in the Night," "The Man I
Love"). Simply changing the size of a
genre without rethinking its meaning
leaves it stranded in no man's land,
though. Too outsize to be modestly
enjoyable, too shallow to be
memorable, "The Cotton Club" is a
tinselly tribute to a time that never
existed.


Couples dance in one of the lavish scenes from M-G-M's "The Merry Widow."
In 1920, the first black
heavyweight champ, Jack Johnson,
acquired a new building on the corner
of Lenox and 142 nd Street in New
York City and turned it into an es
tablishment called the Club Deluxe.
When he failed to make a success of
it, the syndicate under the control of
gangster Owen "Owney" Madden,
who was then serving time in Sing
Sing for murder, took it over from
Johnson. Renaming it the Cotton
Club, they sank a goodly amount of
bootleg money into it and staged a
grand opening in the fall of 1923
(some months after Maddens
release).
For the next I 7 years — during the
period of the Harlem Renaissance,
when white socialites and white intel
lectuals "discovered" the black man
— the Cotton Club occupied the key
spot in Harlem night life, and it oc
cupies a significant place in the his
tory of black culture in this country. It
represented the highest plane to
which black performers of the 1920s
and '30s could aspire, in terms of
recognition, yet everyone associated
with the production end of the Cotton
Club shows was white, all the chorus
girls were "high yaller" (light
skinned) until an insistent young
woman named Lucille Wilson broke
the "color bar," and the clientele was
exclusively Caucasian. Under the
management of Herman Stark and a
genial gambler named George "Big
Frenchy" DeMangc, Don Healy
staged a series of elaborately de
signed, elegantly costumed revues
that capitalized on the Negro

stereotypes white audiences had sud
denly begun to delight in — the
plantation darky, the jaz/ baby, the
grinning, loudly dressed Harlem
dandy. But however fake and
deleterious the image of the Negro
propounded by these shows, the tal
ent they offered up was anything but
counterfeit: Bandleaders Duke El
lington, Jimmie Lunceford and Cab
Calloway, dancers Bill "Bojangles"
Robinson, Avon Long and the Nich
olas Brothers, singers Ethel Waters
and Lena Home were among the en
tertainers featured, often in numbers
built around the music of Harold Ar
len, whom Waters dubbed "the
Negro-ist white man" she ever knew.
I he Cotton Club's unique location
at the crossroads of white society and
black culture (which met on the whim
of white savants), of gangland and the
New York aristocracy (which met as a
result of Prohibition), makes it a
great — and until now, untapped —
subject for the movies. When you
read Jim Haskins' rather scattered
but still tantalizing account ("The
Cotton Club: A Pictorial and Social
History of the Most Famous Symbol
of the Jazz Era"), you can imagine a
sumptuous, provocative, deliriously
entertaining musical drama, filled
with fabulous numbers and scintillat
ing personalities and amazing inci
dents— like the one about how Mad
den's boys "arranged" to terminate
Ellington's Philadelphia contract to
get him to New York sooner, or the
story of Lena Home's smuggling her
self out of the club in a crowd of
chorus girls when she quit, because
no one ever walked out on the Cotton
Club. But Francis Ford Coppola di

rected "The Cotton Club,"and he
had a different idea: to star himself,
strr his technical razzle dazzle and his
spendthrift virtuosity — nearly $50
million worth. Squandering money,
squandering the talents of his sizable
cast, Coppola lets what is likely the
richest film material in years slip
through his fingers.
To begin with, the movie isn't
about the Cotton Club, any more
than "Apocalypse Now" was about
Vietnam or "The Outsiders" and
"Rumble Fish" were about
teenagers. The script Coppola and
last year's Pulitzer Prize winner,
William Kennedy, came up with
(after God knows how many revi
sions) has three separate plots, two of
them intertwined. There's the
gangster story, centering on madman
"Dutch" Schultz (James Remar),
who in actuality had only the most
tenuous connection to Owney Mad
den's club (he used to hang out at
Connie's Inn, a rival night spot fur
ther downtown and closer to the Har
lem River), and his inability to keep
out of gang wars, despite Madden's
repeated attempts to play
peacemaker. There's the oddball love
story, in which a white cornettist
named "Dixie" Dunbar (Richard
Gere), adopted by Schultz when he
saves him from a bullet, infringes on
his territory by romancing his
mistress, a hard-boiled 19-year-old
named Vera (Diane Lane) whom
Schultz has set up in her own
nightclub. Dwyer's brother Vince
(Nicolas Cage), making the most of
his connection, becomes first one of
Schultz's henchmen and then, greedy
for some of his boss's wealth, one of
his enemies. Finally there's the other
love story, with a pair of ambitious
black entertainers, tap dancer
"Sandman" Williams (Gregory
Hines), who promotes his black iden
tity, and light-skinned torch singer
Lila Rose (Lonette McKee), who dis
guises hers, as the hero and heroine.
Having made the idiotic decision to
bypass the real story of the Cotton
Club, Coppola and Kennedy might at
least have concentrated on Sandman
and Lila Rose, who are more or less
concocted of bits and pieces of half a
dozen true-life entertainers (Harold
Nicholas, Lena Home and Dorothy
Dandridge among them), and on the
music and dancing. But the
filmmakers handle this affair so hap
hazardly (and Coppola obviously did
so much heavy cutting on this part of
the picture) that we never understand
what's keeping them apart, or why
the state of their relationship is never
the same at the outset of one scene as
it was at the conclusion of the previ
ous one.

Worse — unbelievably — Coppola
shows so little interest in their musical
comedy gifts, which presumably
prompted him to sign them for these
roles, that he keeps shoving them and
the other singers and dancers into the
background. Lonette Mckee does a
feverish rendition of "111 Wind"
(written by Arlen and Ted Koehler),
but that's her only major number.
And does Coppola really think that
when you've got a peerless dancer
like Gregory Hines on screen, there's
something more interesting to cut
away to? Hines hoofs happily with his
brother Maurice (as Sandman's
brother Clay) and does some of the

Coppola had a different idea: to star
himself, star his technical razzle dazzle
and his spendthrift virtuosity — nearly
$50 million worth. Squandering

sizable cast, Coppola lets what is likely
the richest film material in years slip
through his fingers.

most glistening solo tapping in movies
since the golden age of M-G-M musi
cals, hut Coppola has other things on
that entrepreneurial mind of his: He
uses Mines' dancing as a point of con
trast for the underworld violence
transpiring outside — and on one oc
casion inside — the club. (In fact, no
violence ever disturbed the patrons of
the Cotton Club in the two decades of
its existence.) When Hines does his
most prodigious dance, a cappella,
Coppola turns it into his big number,
intercutting Hines' feet with a series
of killings as he intercut Michael Cor
leone's son's baptism with the
revenge murders in "The Godfath
er." He wants to remind us that he's
still the Godfather of Hollywood,
commanding all the action from his
director's chair, and to illustrate his
(highly dubious) thesis: that whites
express their anger through violence
while blacks release theirs through
popular art. He must be proud of this
deduction — it's the only idea in the
whole two-and-a-half-hour movie.
By calling attention to his own
cleverness in this way, he minimizes
our enjoyment of the performers —
our chief reason for going to see this

picture in the first place. He comes
close to spoiling a joyous,
spontaneous-looking display of clas
sical tap by Charles "Honi" Coles
and others, too. by trying to top it
with his own flashy demonstration of
directing and editing; he throws every
shot in our faces.
The gangster story is old hat, and it
has the unpleasant flavor of self
indulgence — both for the maker of
the "Godfather" pictures and for the
writer whose "Albany trilogy"
abounds with mobsters. (One scene,
in which Schultz's wife catches him
squiring Vera, has the central triangle
of kennedv's first novel, "Legs," as

its antecedent.) Reprising "The God
father" wouldn't be so painful, I
suppose, if Coppola still made movies
the way he did in the early '70s. in the
style of Renoir, honoring his actors
and respecting his audience by
keeping his camera at a distance so
that we could take in an entire room
at a glance and choose where first to
cast our eyes. But when he got lost in
that jungle in "Apocalypse Now," the
first piece of luggage Coppola threw
away was the long shot. Since then,
his prime medium has been the close
up, which he uses in tandem with a
quantity of loud, undisciplined, over
lapping improvisation. He may think
he serves his actors by letting them
overact in overlong, unshaped group
scenes, but he isn't doing Nicolas
Cage or James Remar (both of whom
have turned in creditable work under
other directors) any favors.
l uckily, not everyone in the film
seems to be vulnerable to Coppola's
intemperance. As Frenchy DeMange,
Fred Gwynne utilizes that hanging
sausage face to superb comic effect;
with his thinning hair slicked down

for many years and only recently ac
corded the praise it deserves. Victor
Sjostrom, the Swedish emigre Lillian
Ciish had hand-picked to direct her in
the (magnificent) film version of
"The Scarlet Letter" — and, inciden
tally, the old man in Bergman's "Wild
Strawberries" — made this film about
a young woman who ventures out
into the Midwest, to an unhappy mar
riage and the unwelcome advances of
a rake. Lillian Ciish's performance is a
startlingly modern study of neurosis
produced by environment.
"The Women" (1939; Jan. 26):
Audiences adore this movie, which is
performed by a stellar cast consisting
of many of the most interesting
females of the period: Joan Craw
ford. Rosalind Russell, Paulette God
dard, Ruth Hussey, Mary Boland,
Marjorie Main, Butterfly McQueen,
Phyllis Povah, Virginia Grey, young
Virginia Weidler — and, unfortun
ately, Norma Shearer and Joan Fon
taine. It is not an especially flattering
portrait of women; one of the themes
is that, given the chance, women will
destroy each other's homes through
malicious gossip and envy. But the
script by Anita Loos and Jane Murfen
(adapted from the stage play by
Claire Boothe) is too lighthearted to
be taken very seriously. The fairly
stylish direction is by George C'ukor.
"Libeled Lady" (1936; Feb. 7):
This wisecracking comedy ought to
be a classic. In order to save his paper
from a libel suit, managing editor
Spencer Tracy hires suave William
Powell to woo the plaintiff, heiress
Myrna Loy, and persuades his own
long-suffering fiancee, Jean Harlow,
to wed Powell and then raise a stink
about the affair, placing Loy in an
embarrassing position. Still follow
ing? Of course, Powell really falls for
Loy, and Harlow falls for Powell —
and the screenwriters have to race to
patch everything up in the last reel.
(The patching is rather obvious.) All
four stars are at the top of their
respective forms — Myrna Loy is es
pecially fine — and the dialogue (by
Maurinc Watkins, Howard Emmett
Rogers and George Oppenheimer) is
delightful. Jack Conway directed.

and parted in the middle, he's an art
deco caricature. And when Bob Hos
kins (as Owney Madden) and the
Living Theatre's Julian Beck (as
Dutch Schultz's top underling. Saul)
overact, they do so with panache.
Gwynne and Hoskins — whose
clenched, hoarse voice is almost as
witty as the cartoon New York accent
he put on as Nathan Detroit in the
National Theatre of Great Britain
production of "Guys and Dolls" —
share one of the two scenes in "The
Cotton Club" that we can get close
to. a humorous reaffirmation of their
friendship after Madden, kidnaped by
Vince and held for ransom, returns
unharmed. The other affecting scene
is the Williams brothers' reunion
after Sandman's aggressiveness and
ego have split them up. (Hines
reports that he and his brother
Maurice experienced a similar rift in
their relationship, which may account
in part for the Tightness of the mo
ment on screen.)
The Dixie-Vera plot is the movie's
great unsolved riddle. Since no white
musician ever played at the Cotton
Club, what the hell is a white horn
player doing in the leading role of a
film set there? Coppola and Kennedy
don't violate history much in this case
— Dixie only sits in with the band
once, on a special occasion — so
wherever they place him, in Dutch's
entourage or in Hollywood starring in
Cagney-type roles, they can't really
explain his presence. As usual, Rich
ard Gere's self-consciousness, all
licensed by Coppola's direction,
doesn't help to cluiify things in the
least: Gere's grabbag of peculiar
mannerisms is so full to bursting, es
pecially when he tries to play hip, that
he seems to belong on another planet.
As for Diane Lane, her character is so
misplaced in this movie that Coppola
and Kennedy move her to another
club altogether. Saddled with a

couple of wigs (Louise Brooks
brunette and platinum blonde) that
don't flatter her. and the worst lines
in the movie (she actually calls Gere
"my very, very lover" at one point).
Lane comes off as an even bigger hole
in the screen here than she did as the
abducted rock star who sang those
boring songs in "Streets of Fire."
These two non-characters have a
non-love scene that ranks with the
greatest follies Coppola has master
minded over the last several years
(like the red and blue fish sitting in
the middle of the black and white

licensed by Coppola's direction,
doesn't help to cluiify things in the
least: Gere's grabbag of peculiar
mannerisms is so full to bursting, es
pecially when he tries to play hip, that
he seems to belong on another planet.
As for Diane Lane, her character is so
misplaced in this movie that Coppola
and Kennedy move her to another
club altogether. Saddled with a

couple of wigs (Louise Brooks
brunette and platinum blonde) that
don't flatter her. and the worst lines
in the movie (she actually calls Gere
"my very, very lover" at one point).
Lane comes off as an even bigger hole
in the screen here than she did as the
abducted rock star who sang those
boring songs in "Streets of Fire."
These two non-characters have a
non-love scene that ranks with the
greatest follies Coppola has master
minded over the last several years
(like the red and blue fish sitting in
the middle of the black and white
frame in "Rumble Fish"): They ap
pear to be having sex under an enor
mous mesh stocking.
If I sound angry about this movie,
it's because it's such a horrendous
waste: No one is going to make
another movie about the Cotton
Club, at least not for a long while.
With the resources Coppola had at
his disposal, there was no reason for
reducing the material to self-reflexive
banalities. From the glimpses we get
of the production numbers, he or his
choreographers (Michael Smuin of
the San Francisco Ballet heads the list
in the credits) seem to have under
stood the period and the style of
those revues, and some strong jazz
voices — Prisci 11a Baskerville 011 El
lington's "Creole Love Call" and
Sydney Goldsmith on "Barbecue" —
soar triumphantly above the gun
shots. Probably Coppola was trying to
be "mythic" again (as he was in his
last musical, "One from the Heart")
by reverting to the Hollywood
pictures of an earlier epoch and then
enlarging them, in this case the
gangster melodrama/jazz musical
melees Warner Brothers made a
fairly entertaining stab at in the '40s
("Blues in the Night," "The Man I
Love"). Simply changing the size of a
genre without rethinking its meaning
leaves it stranded in no man's land,
though. Too outsize to be modestly
enjoyable, too shallow to be
memorable, "The Cotton Club" is a
tinselly tribute to a time that never
existed.
