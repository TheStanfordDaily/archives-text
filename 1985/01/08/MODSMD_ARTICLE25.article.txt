## 'Cotton Club' a horrendous waste 
### STEVE VINEBERG Daily staff 
In 1920, the first black
heavyweight champ, Jack Johnson,
acquired a new building on the corner
of Lenox and 142 nd Street in New
York City and turned it into an es
tablishment called the Club Deluxe.
When he failed to make a success of
it, the syndicate under the control of
gangster Owen "Owney" Madden,
who was then serving time in Sing
Sing for murder, took it over from
Johnson. Renaming it the Cotton
Club, they sank a goodly amount of
bootleg money into it and staged a
grand opening in the fall of 1923
(some months after Maddens
release).
For the next I 7 years — during the
period of the Harlem Renaissance,
when white socialites and white intel
lectuals "discovered" the black man
— the Cotton Club occupied the key
spot in Harlem night life, and it oc
cupies a significant place in the his
tory of black culture in this country. It
represented the highest plane to
which black performers of the 1920s
and '30s could aspire, in terms of
recognition, yet everyone associated
with the production end of the Cotton
Club shows was white, all the chorus
girls were "high yaller" (light
skinned) until an insistent young
woman named Lucille Wilson broke
the "color bar," and the clientele was
exclusively Caucasian. Under the
management of Herman Stark and a
genial gambler named George "Big
Frenchy" DeMangc, Don Healy
staged a series of elaborately de
signed, elegantly costumed revues
that capitalized on the Negro

stereotypes white audiences had sud
denly begun to delight in — the
plantation darky, the jaz/ baby, the
grinning, loudly dressed Harlem
dandy. But however fake and
deleterious the image of the Negro
propounded by these shows, the tal
ent they offered up was anything but
counterfeit: Bandleaders Duke El
lington, Jimmie Lunceford and Cab
Calloway, dancers Bill "Bojangles"
Robinson, Avon Long and the Nich
olas Brothers, singers Ethel Waters
and Lena Home were among the en
tertainers featured, often in numbers
built around the music of Harold Ar
len, whom Waters dubbed "the
Negro-ist white man" she ever knew.
I he Cotton Club's unique location
at the crossroads of white society and
black culture (which met on the whim
of white savants), of gangland and the
New York aristocracy (which met as a
result of Prohibition), makes it a
great — and until now, untapped —
subject for the movies. When you
read Jim Haskins' rather scattered
but still tantalizing account ("The
Cotton Club: A Pictorial and Social
History of the Most Famous Symbol
of the Jazz Era"), you can imagine a
sumptuous, provocative, deliriously
entertaining musical drama, filled
with fabulous numbers and scintillat
ing personalities and amazing inci
dents— like the one about how Mad
den's boys "arranged" to terminate
Ellington's Philadelphia contract to
get him to New York sooner, or the
story of Lena Home's smuggling her
self out of the club in a crowd of
chorus girls when she quit, because
no one ever walked out on the Cotton
Club. But Francis Ford Coppola di

rected "The Cotton Club,"and he
had a different idea: to star himself,
strr his technical razzle dazzle and his
spendthrift virtuosity — nearly $50
million worth. Squandering money,
squandering the talents of his sizable
cast, Coppola lets what is likely the
richest film material in years slip
through his fingers.
To begin with, the movie isn't
about the Cotton Club, any more
than "Apocalypse Now" was about
Vietnam or "The Outsiders" and
"Rumble Fish" were about
teenagers. The script Coppola and
last year's Pulitzer Prize winner,
William Kennedy, came up with
(after God knows how many revi
sions) has three separate plots, two of
them intertwined. There's the
gangster story, centering on madman
"Dutch" Schultz (James Remar),
who in actuality had only the most
tenuous connection to Owney Mad
den's club (he used to hang out at
Connie's Inn, a rival night spot fur
ther downtown and closer to the Har
lem River), and his inability to keep
out of gang wars, despite Madden's
repeated attempts to play
peacemaker. There's the oddball love
story, in which a white cornettist
named "Dixie" Dunbar (Richard
Gere), adopted by Schultz when he
saves him from a bullet, infringes on
his territory by romancing his
mistress, a hard-boiled 19-year-old
named Vera (Diane Lane) whom
Schultz has set up in her own
nightclub. Dwyer's brother Vince
(Nicolas Cage), making the most of
his connection, becomes first one of
Schultz's henchmen and then, greedy
for some of his boss's wealth, one of
his enemies. Finally there's the other
love story, with a pair of ambitious
black entertainers, tap dancer
"Sandman" Williams (Gregory
Hines), who promotes his black iden
tity, and light-skinned torch singer
Lila Rose (Lonette McKee), who dis
guises hers, as the hero and heroine.
Having made the idiotic decision to
bypass the real story of the Cotton
Club, Coppola and Kennedy might at
least have concentrated on Sandman
and Lila Rose, who are more or less
concocted of bits and pieces of half a
dozen true-life entertainers (Harold
Nicholas, Lena Home and Dorothy
Dandridge among them), and on the
music and dancing. But the
filmmakers handle this affair so hap
hazardly (and Coppola obviously did
so much heavy cutting on this part of
the picture) that we never understand
what's keeping them apart, or why
the state of their relationship is never
the same at the outset of one scene as
it was at the conclusion of the previ
ous one.

Worse — unbelievably — Coppola
shows so little interest in their musical
comedy gifts, which presumably
prompted him to sign them for these
roles, that he keeps shoving them and
the other singers and dancers into the
background. Lonette Mckee does a
feverish rendition of "111 Wind"
(written by Arlen and Ted Koehler),
but that's her only major number.
And does Coppola really think that
when you've got a peerless dancer
like Gregory Hines on screen, there's
something more interesting to cut
away to? Hines hoofs happily with his
brother Maurice (as Sandman's
brother Clay) and does some of the

himself, star his technical razzle dazzle
and his spendthrift virtuosity — nearly

most glistening solo tapping in movies
since the golden age of M-G-M musi
cals, hut Coppola has other things on
that entrepreneurial mind of his: He
uses Mines' dancing as a point of con
trast for the underworld violence
transpiring outside — and on one oc
casion inside — the club. (In fact, no
violence ever disturbed the patrons of
the Cotton Club in the two decades of
its existence.) When Hines does his
most prodigious dance, a cappella,
Coppola turns it into his big number,
intercutting Hines' feet with a series
of killings as he intercut Michael Cor
leone's son's baptism with the
revenge murders in "The Godfath
er." He wants to remind us that he's
still the Godfather of Hollywood,
commanding all the action from his
director's chair, and to illustrate his
(highly dubious) thesis: that whites
express their anger through violence
while blacks release theirs through
popular art. He must be proud of this
deduction — it's the only idea in the
whole two-and-a-half-hour movie.
By calling attention to his own
cleverness in this way, he minimizes
our enjoyment of the performers —
our chief reason for going to see this

picture in the first place. He comes
close to spoiling a joyous,
spontaneous-looking display of clas
sical tap by Charles "Honi" Coles
and others, too. by trying to top it
with his own flashy demonstration of
directing and editing; he throws every
shot in our faces.
The gangster story is old hat, and it
has the unpleasant flavor of self
indulgence — both for the maker of
the "Godfather" pictures and for the
writer whose "Albany trilogy"
abounds with mobsters. (One scene,
in which Schultz's wife catches him
squiring Vera, has the central triangle
of kennedv's first novel, "Legs," as

its antecedent.) Reprising "The God
father" wouldn't be so painful, I
suppose, if Coppola still made movies
the way he did in the early '70s. in the
style of Renoir, honoring his actors
and respecting his audience by
keeping his camera at a distance so
that we could take in an entire room
at a glance and choose where first to
cast our eyes. But when he got lost in
that jungle in "Apocalypse Now," the
first piece of luggage Coppola threw
away was the long shot. Since then,
his prime medium has been the close
up, which he uses in tandem with a
quantity of loud, undisciplined, over
lapping improvisation. He may think
he serves his actors by letting them
overact in overlong, unshaped group
scenes, but he isn't doing Nicolas
Cage or James Remar (both of whom
have turned in creditable work under
other directors) any favors.
l uckily, not everyone in the film
seems to be vulnerable to Coppola's
intemperance. As Frenchy DeMange,
Fred Gwynne utilizes that hanging
sausage face to superb comic effect;
