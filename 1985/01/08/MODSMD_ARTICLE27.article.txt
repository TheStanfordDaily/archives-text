I or film huffs who have wearied of
the stale fare at our local repertor\
houses. the Castro Theatre in San
I rancisco is in the midst of a spectac
ular six-week tribute to M-Ci-M's
Diamond Jubilee, during which a
number of rarelv seen classics will
n'surface. King Vidor's much lauded
silents. "The Big Parade" (Jan. 15)
and"The Crowd" (Jan. 28). will be

screened, ;is well as the 1952 swash
buckler "Ivanhoe" (Feh.2) with
I li/aheth and Robert Taylor (no re
lation) and the sparkling new print of
the first full-spectrum Technicolor
feature, "Becky Sharp" (Jan. 24),
shown at last fall's New York Film
festival. I was especially pleased to
see the following pictures listed on
the Castro program:
"Fury" (1936; Jan. 14): The Ger
man Expressionist director Fritz Lang
came to Hollywood when he tied Hit
ler in the mid-1930s (having refused
to he Hitler's private filmmaker — a
post eventually awarded to Leni
Riefenstahl — he had no alternative)
and stayed for two decades, hut very
few of his American films demon
strate his genius. This is one of them.
A Depression-era "problem picture"
about mob violence, it has a Ger
manic sensibility (fate hovers unmis
takably over the events) and a highly
stylized look — partly the contribu
tion of the photographer, Joseph
Ruttenberg. With Spencer Tracy and
the proletarian beauty of the '30s,
Sylvia Sidney.
"Intruder in the Dust" (1949; Jan.
14): It is generally assumed that
William Faulkner wrote nothing first
rate after the war, and that no
filmmaker has ever been able to get
him onto the screen. Both assump
tions are false. Clarence Brown made
this near-great (and virtually un
known) film of Faulkner's trenchant
late novel about the relationship be
tween a white boy (Claude Jarman,
Jr.) and a black man (the magnificent
actor Juano Hernandez) in a small

Southern town. (The host parts of
Harper Lee's "To Kill a Mock
ingbird" are probably indebted to it.)
Two generally undistinguished char
acter actors. Porter Hall and
Elizabeth Patterson. gi\e imaginative
supporting performances.
"Throe Comrades" (193K: Jan.
15): F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote most of
the screenpla\ for this fatalistic
melodrama, based on a Remarque
novel: it's a bad picture, but ever)

tew minutes a line shimmers with
Fitzgerald's trademark doomed wit.
There's another reason to sit through
the film, too, despite the fairly hope
less attempt hv the director. Frank
Borzage, to evoke a German milieu,
and despite the performances of
Robert Taylor. Robert Young and
Franchot Tone as the comrades of the
title: Margaret Sullavan is unforget
table as the tragic heroine.

her greatest performance, as Mar
guerite Gauthier, the heroine of the
celebrated well-made play by Dumas.

again, and James Stewart, as adver
saries who become lovers in one of
the best comedies ever made in this
country. Samson Raphaelson drew
his screenplay from a Nikolaus Laszlo
play set in a department store in
Budapest; it has been remade as a
cheery, unmemorable Judy Garland
picture ("In the Good Old Sum
mertime") and as a lovely Broadway
operetta with a Bock-Harnick score
("She l.oves Me"). This movie, di-

rected bv Ernst Lubitsch. is the best
version, however. Stewart and Sul
lavan are superbl) matched, and they
make triumphant sense out of the
conflict and development of the rela
tionship: We can see exactly which
traits in each of these characters in
furiate the other, and at the same
time what leads them to fall in love.
"Private Lives" (1931; Jan. 19):
Sidney Franklin, normally a heavy
handed director M-G-M hauled out
for its most expensive properties —
and nothing was ever heavier than an
M-G-M "prestige" picture — did a
surprisingly good job putting Noel
Coward's play on screen. Even more
surprising is Norma Shearer's perfor
mance as Amanda: She's no Maggie
Smith, but she's not bad at all. and
Robert Montgomery is excellent as
Elvot. Their respective spouses are
plaved bv Reginald Denny and Una
Merkel. '
"The Merry Widow" (1934: Jan.
22): Ernst Lubitsch directed this
second of three versions (so far) of
the Fritz Lehar operetta. (The first, a
silent, was a perverse and devilishly
clever comedy by Erich von
Stroheim.) Before she met Nelson
Eddy in "Naughty Marietta,"
Jcancttc Mac Donald made a series of
early movie musicals with Maurice
Chevalier, most of them under
Lubitsch's supervision: this one is far
and away the best. Lubitsch allowed
something coquettish and almost sexy
to emerge in Mac Donald — she isn't
wholesome or kittenish here — and
he restrained Chevalier (no easy
task).

"Camille" (1937; Jan. 25): The
great Garbo in her greatest perfor
mance. as Marguerite Gauthier, the
heroine of the celebrated well-made
plav by Alexandre Dumas jits. "The
l ady of the Camellias" (also the
source of "La Traviata"). George
Cukor directed, handsomely, though
the production does suffer from the
M-G-M high-class look.

I li/aheth and Robert Taylor (no re

the first full-spectrum Technicolor
feature, "Becky Sharp" (Jan. 24),
shown at last fall's New York Film
festival. I was especially pleased to
see the following pictures listed on
the Castro program:
"Fury" (1936; Jan. 14): The Ger
man Expressionist director Fritz Lang
came to Hollywood when he tied Hit
ler in the mid-1930s (having refused
to he Hitler's private filmmaker — a
post eventually awarded to Leni
Riefenstahl — he had no alternative)
and stayed for two decades, hut very
few of his American films demon
strate his genius. This is one of them.
A Depression-era "problem picture"
about mob violence, it has a Ger
manic sensibility (fate hovers unmis
takably over the events) and a highly
stylized look — partly the contribu
tion of the photographer, Joseph
Ruttenberg. With Spencer Tracy and
the proletarian beauty of the '30s,
Sylvia Sidney.
"Intruder in the Dust" (1949; Jan.
14): It is generally assumed that
William Faulkner wrote nothing first
rate after the war, and that no
filmmaker has ever been able to get
him onto the screen. Both assump
tions are false. Clarence Brown made
this near-great (and virtually un
known) film of Faulkner's trenchant
late novel about the relationship be
tween a white boy (Claude Jarman,
Jr.) and a black man (the magnificent
actor Juano Hernandez) in a small

Southern town. (The host parts of
Harper Lee's "To Kill a Mock
ingbird" are probably indebted to it.)
Two generally undistinguished char
acter actors. Porter Hall and
Elizabeth Patterson. gi\e imaginative
supporting performances.

the screenpla\ for this fatalistic
melodrama, based on a Remarque
novel: it's a bad picture, but ever)

There's another reason to sit through

Robert Taylor. Robert Young and

again, and James Stewart, as adver
saries who become lovers in one of
the best comedies ever made in this
country. Samson Raphaelson drew
his screenplay from a Nikolaus Laszlo
play set in a department store in
Budapest; it has been remade as a
cheery, unmemorable Judy Garland
picture ("In the Good Old Sum
mertime") and as a lovely Broadway
operetta with a Bock-Harnick score
("She l.oves Me"). This movie, di-

rected bv Ernst Lubitsch. is the best
version, however. Stewart and Sul
lavan are superbl) matched, and they
make triumphant sense out of the
conflict and development of the rela
tionship: We can see exactly which
traits in each of these characters in
furiate the other, and at the same
time what leads them to fall in love.
"Private Lives" (1931; Jan. 19):
Sidney Franklin, normally a heavy
handed director M-G-M hauled out
for its most expensive properties —
and nothing was ever heavier than an
M-G-M "prestige" picture — did a
surprisingly good job putting Noel
Coward's play on screen. Even more
surprising is Norma Shearer's perfor
mance as Amanda: She's no Maggie
Smith, but she's not bad at all. and
Robert Montgomery is excellent as
Elvot. Their respective spouses are
plaved bv Reginald Denny and Una
Merkel. '
"The Merry Widow" (1934: Jan.
22): Ernst Lubitsch directed this
second of three versions (so far) of
the Fritz Lehar operetta. (The first, a
silent, was a perverse and devilishly
clever comedy by Erich von
Stroheim.) Before she met Nelson
Eddy in "Naughty Marietta,"
Jcancttc Mac Donald made a series of
early movie musicals with Maurice
Chevalier, most of them under
Lubitsch's supervision: this one is far
and away the best. Lubitsch allowed
something coquettish and almost sexy
to emerge in Mac Donald — she isn't
wholesome or kittenish here — and
he restrained Chevalier (no easy
task).

"Camille" (1937; Jan. 25): The
great Garbo in her greatest perfor
mance. as Marguerite Gauthier, the
heroine of the celebrated well-made
plav by Alexandre Dumas jits. "The

the production does suffer from the
