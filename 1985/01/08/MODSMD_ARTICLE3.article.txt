(In this, the first of a two-part series, The Daily takes a
look at religious life at Stanford from a student view
point. Tomorrow: A faculty perspective.

A little after noon the students gather for their
prayer service in the Old Union clubhouse. Outside,
sunlight falls on the green grass and asphalt in White
Plaza. Bicyclists whip through the brightly-dressed
crowd.
The worshipping students in the clubhouse are mem
bers of the Stanford Islamic Society. Nine have gath
ered for the second of the five daily prayers required
by their religion.

On the wall of the small, white room hangs a picture
of the Mosque of the Prophet in Medina. Copies of the
Koran and religious texts fill bookcases.
The barefoot students stand on a mat. They face
north, because they are required to face Mecca and
that is the shortest direction. One student takes the
role of itnanm, or prayer leader. He stands in front of
the group and recites from the Koran. The other stu
dents recite responsively. Sometimes they are silent.
Sometimes they kneel and bow.
