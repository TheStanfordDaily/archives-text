(In this, the first of a two-part series, The Daily takes a
look at religious life at Stanford from a student view
point. Tomorrow: A faculty perspective.

A little after noon the students gather for their
prayer service in the Old Union clubhouse. Outside,
sunlight falls on the green grass and asphalt in White
Plaza. Bicyclists whip through the brightly-dressed
crowd.
The worshipping students in the clubhouse are mem
bers of the Stanford Islamic Society. Nine have gath
ered for the second of the five daily prayers required
by their religion.

On the wall of the small, white room hangs a picture
of the Mosque of the Prophet in Medina. Copies of the
Koran and religious texts fill bookcases.
The barefoot students stand on a mat. They face
north, because they are required to face Mecca and
that is the shortest direction. One student takes the
role of itnanm, or prayer leader. He stands in front of
the group and recites from the Koran. The other stu
dents recite responsively. Sometimes they are silent.
Sometimes they kneel and bow.
In White Plaza, a thin young man in a tight tank top

coaxes feedback from his electric
guitar.
Amr Badawi, from Egypt, is a
graduate student in electrical engi
neering and a member of the Islamic
Society. He joined the group because
"I needed to fulfill my needs. And so
cially I feel more comfortable with
people who are from my country and
from my religion."
"This is kind of an active year, ac
tually," says Badawi, who served as
the organization's president last year.
He estimates that about 50 Muslims
participate in the society.
The group holds prayer meetings
three times a day in Old Union and a
Friday service at noon in the Interna
tional Center. The group's social ac
tion activities consist of sending
donations to Muslim countries in
need, such as Somalia.
Another active religious group on
campus is the Hillel Foundation,

which caters to the need of Jewish
students. Junior Joel Bellenson of
Simi Valley co-chairs the organiza
tion's social action committee.
"I'm not a religious person," says
Bellenson. "I saw it as a particular
network in which I can provide social
change."
Shaun Skelton, a graduate student
in electrical engineering from
Manitowoc, Wise., chairs the New
man Center's community council.
The Newman Center is the Catholic
students' organization on campus.
"I never intended to get as in
volved in the Newman Center as I
did, but the more I got involved the
more 1 realized its potential for social
change." says Skelton.
says Skelton.
Newman Center works closely with
the Community Outreach Program at
Stanford (CORPS), Skelton says.
Among other activities, CORPS vol
unteers work with the handicapped,
fix up houses in East Palo Alto and
sponsor food drives and blood drives
each quarter.
