# Stanford bucks merit-based aid
## 
### MARY YUH Staff writer 
The University will continue its policy of giving
out scholarships based on financial need or athletic
prowess instead of academic merit, as some Texas
schools are doing, according to University officials.
Stanford opposes merit scholarships because it
wishes to compete for students on the basis of its
academics and extracurricular offerings and not on
the basis of how much money it can otter the stu
dents, according to Michael Jackson, assistant to
Provost James Rosse.
Robert Huff, director of financial aid. cites other
reasons. Merit scholarships are a "zero-sum game
that in essence takes money that could be given to
qualified students with need, and gives it to stu
dents who, although qualified, have no need tor it.
"The University is committed to meet the dem
onstrated need of all undergraduates' and thus

merit scholarships are unwarranted, he said.
However, Stanford does have a program of ath
letic scholarships â€” a program that bases its finan
cial awards on athletic prowess instead of need.
Under National Collegiate Athletic Association
rules, Stanford gives out the equivalent of 180 full
scholarships for men and SO full scholarships for
women, divided among any number of students,
except within certain sports where only a specific
number of students are allowed to receive scholar
ships, according to Sue Lemmon, administrative as
sistant to the director of athletics and liaison for
financial aid and eligibility.
All the funds for these scholarships are raised
yearly through the Buck Club for men and the
Cardinal Club for women. Athletic scholarships are
not financially supported by the University.
"If we can't raise the money through the clubs,
we don't give out the scholarships," Lemmon said.

"We're not giving out money that might he going to
financial aid for those who need it."
Law Prof. Jack Friedenthal, Stanford's faculty
representative to both the NCAA and the Athletic
Department, said it is "sad but true that we have to
give out some money" in the form of athletic schol
arships.
Because of the "competitive nature of the ath
letic enterprise, the way in which collegiate ath
letics is structured, we must give out athletic schol
arships it we want to have the sports program we
now have." he said.
Regarding the absence of merit scholarships, he
said. "It's not a question of "why don't we do for
scholars what we do for athletes?"
"We are opposed to merit scholarships. We
would be opposed to athletic scholarships but we
are in a situation where we must com
pete for the good athletes it we want a
strong athletic program." he said.
"There are few talented athletes
with the requisite academic qualifica
tions to he admitted to Stanford, and
therefore we are limited to the very
I "test" in terms of recruitment,
I reidenthal said. "We compete or
the most highly desired athletes, a id
that makes recruiting vers difficult
and scholarships very important."
Outside of athletic recruitment.
Stanford has no problem attracting
students of high academic caliber, as
evidenced by the rising number both
of applicants and of those who
matriculate once admitted, which
means there is no need for merit
scholarships. Friedenthal said.
"The schools that give out merit
scholarships are those that need high
quality students. They are not the
outstanding academic institutions,"
he said.
Because there are no outstanding
athletic colleges in the way that there
are outstanding academic colleges-,
student athletes must be "persuaded
to come to a college," he said. That
persuasion takes the form of scholar
ships.
Another reason for giving out ath
letic scholarships is to demonstrate
the school's commitment to an excel

lent sports program. According to
Friedenthal. without such demonstra
tions ot dedication. Stanford or any
school would appear to have little in
terest in attracting the best athletes or
in having winning teams.
"As athletes, these students want
to be on winning teams," he said.
"They don't want to go to a school
that they think doesn't care about
winning, about beiii.i the best."
No matter what the reasons for
h; ing an athletic scholarship pro
gri. n. such a program can be best jus
tified by the answer to the question.
"Do we want big-time athletics?" he
said. "Everything comes back to this:
Do we want that level of competi
tion?"
For now and the near future, the
answer appears to be "yes." Frieden
thal said.
"College is a gathering place, more
than a place to learn academically;
it's a place where we experience a dif
ferent kind of education. Part of that
experience is physical fitness." he
said.
Although collegiate competition is
not necessary for physical fitness, the
University is committed to
"excellence in a wide variety of
areas," and that includes athletics.
Friedenthal said.
"Where the whole thing will fall
apart is when we forget that we are a
university, that our mission is to edu
cate the most interesting young
people in the U.S.. that athletics is

only a part of it."he said.
"There are too mam schools where
there is too little else apart from ath
letics. where the administration is
only interested in what happens on
the football field."
He said he sees little chance of that
ever happening at Stanford, noting
that athletes must he qualified before
they are admitted, and that once they
enroll, they are encouraged in their
intellectual pursuits.
"Student athletes here don't get
pushed through an easy curriculum so
that they can pass and be eligible to
play." he said. "In the balance of
things, academics is more important,
and we tr\ to convey that to our ath
letes."
Both Friedenthal and Lemmon feel
it is important to realize Stanford
does not concentrate on one sport to
the exclusion of others. "We try to
give all sports an equal deal," Lem
mon said.
According to Friedenthal. "We try
to have a strong, broad athletics pro
gram. and that means that we support
a large variety of sports and give out
scholarships in many of them.
"We still feel that there are good
old-fashioned values in having teams
and sports and a band, that we want
to be successful, that the costs (of
being in the collegiate athletics
structure) are really not that great"
when compared to the benefits of a
"strong, broad athletics program,"
Friedenthal said.
