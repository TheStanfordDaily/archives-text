The University will continue its policy of giving
out scholarships based on financial need or athletic
prowess instead of academic merit, as some Texas
schools are doing, according to University officials.
Stanford opposes merit scholarships because it
wishes to compete for students on the basis of its
academics and extracurricular offerings and not on
the basis of how much money it can otter the stu
dents, according to Michael Jackson, assistant to
Provost James Rosse.
Robert Huff, director of financial aid. cites other
reasons. Merit scholarships are a "zero-sum game
that in essence takes money that could be given to
qualified students with need, and gives it to stu
dents who, although qualified, have no need tor it.
"The University is committed to meet the dem

merit scholarships are unwarranted, he said.
However, Stanford does have a program of ath

All the funds for these scholarships are raised
yearly through the Buck Club for men and the
Cardinal Club for women. Athletic scholarships are
not financially supported by the University.
"If we can't raise the money through the clubs,
we don't give out the scholarships," Lemmon said.

"We're not giving out money that might he going to
financial aid for those who need it."
Law Prof. Jack Friedenthal, Stanford's faculty
representative to both the NCAA and the Athletic
Department, said it is "sad but true that we have to
give out some money" in the form of athletic schol
arships.
Because of the "competitive nature of the ath
letic enterprise, the way in which collegiate ath
letics is structured, we must give out athletic schol
arships it we want to have the sports program we
now have." he said.
Regarding the absence of merit scholarships, he
said. "It's not a question of "why don't we do for
scholars what we do for athletes?"
"We are opposed to merit scholarships. We
would be opposed to athletic scholarships but we
