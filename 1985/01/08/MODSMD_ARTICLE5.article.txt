# SPA suspended in SOS inquiry
## 
### TODD RAMMING Staff writer 
"University recognition of the Stanford Pro
gressive Alliance (SPA) is hereby suspended.
SPA may not, therefore, meet on campus, con
duct programming activities, make use of Uni
versity resources, or have access to its funds in
the ASSU until further notice from this office."
In this excerpt from a Dec. 4 letter to SPA.
the Office of Student Organization Services
(SOS) handed down its final decision in
response to "serious violations" of campus
guidelines for political activities by SPA prior to
the November elections.
"Serious organizational flaws contributed to
SPA's tolerance of repeated, inappropriate uses
of its phone and office by STAR (Students
Against Reaganism) Coalition," said SOS Co
ordinator Michael Ramsey-Perez elsewhere in
the letter.
In three other letters, Ramsey-Perez:
• Reprimanded STAR Coalition for its viola
tion of University guidelines in using SPA's
telephone and office space for "candidacy ad
vocacy activities."
• Informed the STAR Coalition that the use of
a post office box rented with ASSU funds by
STAR-PAC (Students Against Reaganism Poli
tical Action Committee), an external group reg
istered with the State of California, violated
University regulations.
• Cautioned Stanford Students for Mondale-
Ferraro (SSM-F) that its use of SPA's phone
number in SSM-F literature was a serious viola
tion of the same guidelines.
These violations were first called to attention
by Steve Dauber and Jason Matherly, president
and vice-president, respectively, of the Stanford
College Republicans. Matherly informed ASSU
Senator Jay Alter of the suspected wrongdoings
by SPA. Alter said an inspection of financial
records confirmed Dauber and Matherly's
suspicions.
With the evidence in hand. Alter concluded
"something had to be done," for SPA's misuse
of funds "jeopardized the tax-exempt status of
both the ASSU and the University."
The ASSU Appropriations Committee,
alerted by Alter of the situation, began an in
vestigation of SPA and the related organiza
tions. According to Senator Carey White, chair
man of the Appropriations Committee, the
ASSU, through investigation on its own and
consultation with Ramsey-Perez, concluded
that "the University should deal with the mat
ter."
"They (SPA) had clearly violated University
policy. We did not feel that their violations were
sufficiently serious or that they had misused
specifically ASSU funds," White said.
The University arranged meetings with the

involved groups on Nov. 6 and 13 and released
its final decision on Dec. 4. Asked why it had
decided to suspend SPA and only to reprimand
STAR and SSM-F. Ramsey-Perez said in a tele
phone interview yesterday that SPA s problems
lay in "fundamental organization difficulties",
while STAR and SSM-F suffered from more su
perficial problems.
In allowing STAR-PAC the use of an ASSU
funded post office box, STAR "just made an
honest mistake," Ramsey-Perez said. SSM-F
wrongdoings resulted from miscommunication.

but the organizational problems of SSM-F could
be "easily corrected," he said.
SPA, in contrast, suffered from serious struc
tural flaws "cutting across the issues of mem
bership criteria, leadership selection, leadership
responsibilities, and decision-making
procedures."
"Unless the organizational issues were sorted
out, other violations could occur," Ramsey-
Perez said.
Ramsey-Perez added that "I never detected
people trying to get away with something, noth
ing I could construe as malice or dishonesty."
Asked whether he suspected malicious con
duct on behalf of his Democratic opponents,
Dauber said "it doesn't matter. Whether they
are dishonest or incompetent, they shouldn't be
trusted with Univeristy funds."
The final statement of the University to SPA
asserted that reinstatement could take place
only after the "organizational flaws have been
corrected."
Mark Mazur, authorized spokesperson of
SPA, said the relatively new steering committee
has taken charge of reorganization. "We are


Jay Alter
trying to decide what the next step
should be," he said.
While SPA is attempting to satisfy
the University's demands so that it
may regain official recognition,

Mazur termed the suspension
"unreasonable" and "more punitive
than remedial."
The basic problems, he said, lie in
interpretation of political guidelines
rather than disorganization of the
SPA organization. The problems
which have occurred, Mazur said,
"have not been properly addressed."
