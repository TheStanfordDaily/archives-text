Hewlett-Packard Co. has chal
lenged other corporations to join in
support for the Stanford University
Hospital's modernization project,
saying it will contribute $ 1 for every
$4 raised by other corporations.
John Young, Hewlett-Packard's
president and a Stanford trustee, said
his company will give $25(),()()() to the
project, in hope of bringing the total
to $1.25 million.
Mary Anne Easley, a representa
tive of Hewlett-Packard, said the
pledged money will go to the hospital
modernization project in general. "It
is not for anything specific."
Explaining the modernization proj
ect. director Elvia Garwood said,
"We are moving and expanding."
During the next three months, ap
proximately 4,000 truckloads of dirt
will be moved away from the medical
center to make way for a center for
nuclear magnetic resonance, a
modern high-powered \-ray machine
that produces detailed pictures with
out the dangers of radiation.
Another addition will be "satellite
pharmacies" that will complement
the existing main pharmacy, Gar
wood said. The eight new pharmacies
will be located on each floor at the
nurse stations, providing one phar
macy per unit.
One hundred ninty-eight new beds
will replace some existing beds. They
will be placed in the "more private

rooms" for the "more acutely ill
patients," Garwood said.
Some additional lounges and coun
sulting areas will be main additions to
the hospital. The consulting rooms
will be used for conferences between
physicians, families and patients, ac
cording to Garwood.
Asked about the noise the con
struction will inevitably cause, Gar
wood said the waiting areas will be
least affected. She noted, however,
that jackhammering outside the
building may bother some patients
who are sensitive to noise. Those
patients and their families will be pro
vided with ear plugs, Garwood said.
"We know it's a nuisance," she
added.
"Once the outside walls are put on,
there shouldn't be too much noise,"
Garwood said.
She added that the interior con
struction should not produce enough
noise to disturb patients or staff
members.
As a result of the construction,
some parking spaces will be removed,
but "the hospital is required by the
city of Palo Alto to replace the spots
that are removed."
Richard Rogers, president and
chief operating officer of Syntex
Corp. of Palo Alto, has been ap
pointed bv the University to head the
fund-raising efforts for the project.
University President Donald Ken
nedy has announced that Rogers will
be joined by Albert Eisenatat, vice
president and general counsel of Ap
ple Computers in Cupertino; James
Morrell, executive vice president of
Saga Corp., a Menlo Park-based na
tional food supplier; and Jack Black,
Central California vice president for
Pacific Bell in San Jose, according to
the Medical Center News Service.
Eisenstat will be in charge of
working with the electronics industry.
Black will work with businesses in his
field, and Morrell will make connec
tions within the industrial sector.
The moderization project is
schuleded to be finished in the fall of
l 987.
