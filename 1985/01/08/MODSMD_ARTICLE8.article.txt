Reagan may alter Social Security
WASHINGTON — President Reagan would consider eliminating the
Social Security cost-of-living adjustment scheduled for January 1986 it
the Democratic congressional leadership proposed such a step and
worked for it. a senior administration official said yesterday.
Although there appears to he little prospect that Democratic leaders
will follow, that course, the official's comments represented the first hint
that Reagan would consider hacking down on his campaign promise not
to tamper with Social Security benefits. Publicly. Reagan has continued
to insist that he considers Social Security benefits untouchable.
In fact, at about the time the official was interviewed at a not-for
attribution lunch with reporters. White House spokesman Larry Speakes
told a press briefing that Reagan still strongly opposes tampering with
Social Security benefits.
So far. most of the impetus for limiting the cost-of-living raise for So
cial Security recipients as part of a deficit-reduction plan has come from
Senate Republicans headed by new Majority Leader Robert Dole (R
-kan.). In a recent interview. Dole predicted that Congress would pass a
deficit-reduction package trimming not only Social Security benefits but
also defense spending, another item Reagan has ruled untouchable.
Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici (R-N.M.), and
Sen. Alan Simpson (R-Wyo.), the newly elected majority whip, have
also supported limiting the cost-of-living adjustment.
Rep. James Jones ( D-Okla.) one of the few Democrats to publicly en
dorse the idea, said he believed that the public, including Social Security
recipients, would accept a limit "if it is perceived as fair-share sacrifice"
aimed at reducing the deficit. Jones. House budget committee chairman
during Reagan's first term, had earlier proposed limiting the cost-of
living raise.
Jones' successor as Budget Committee chairman. Rep. William Gray
111 (D-Pa.) said he believed that the House should seek to put together a
budget-reduction package without cutting Social Security benefits but
added, "We may not be able to do that."
Kennedy calls for black rights
PRETORIA. South Africa — Sen. Edward Kennedy urged the South
African government yesterday to grant full citizenship rights to the
country's black majority, but said after talks here that he received no in
dication that the apartheid policies of racial segregation would ever be
ended.
Meeting with Foreign Minister Roelof "Pik" Botha, Kennedy asked
that South Africa's 24 million blacks be given full political rights, that no
more be stripped of their South African citizenship and that the govern
ment's program of forced resettlement of blacks be ended.
But Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat, said after the hour-long
meeting, "I did not find anything that was very much encouraging."
Botha did not disagree. "It would be naive ever to expect me and
Senator Kennedy to reach common ground," the South African foreign
minister told reporters. "He cannot even reach common ground with the
Republicans in the United States, and the Republicans are to the left of
us."
Kennedy warned Botha that, unless "meaningful change (was) likely
in the forseeable future," the U.S. Congress would probably enact eco
nomic sanctions against South Africa, including restrictions on Ameri
can investments here.
In recent weeks, however, the South African government has
repeatedly declared its determination to resist such foreign pressure and
to proceed with selected political and social reforms at its own pace.
Vietnamese attack key rebel post
BANGKOK. Thailand — Fighting raged yesterday as Vietnamese
troops launched a long-expected assault on the Cambodian rebel camp
at Ampil, the military headquarters and last border stronghold of the
non-Communist Khmer People's National Liberation Front.
Intensive shelling of the camp, located about 45 miles northeast of the
Thai border town of Aranyaprathet, began early y esterday morning and
was followed by a tank-led thrust into sections of the Khmer rebels'
four-mile-long forward defense line.
Thai military sources at the border said the guerrillas repulsed the ini
tial attack but reporters observing the fighting across the border said one
Vietnamese tank had already broken through.
Maj. Gen. San Sripen, commander of the Thai border forces, said
Khmer People's National Liberation Front troops had knocked out
three tanks in the course of the fighting.
The battle for Ampil was described by Thai military sources as the
fiercest seen in the border area since the launching of the Vietnamese
dry-season offensive Nov. 18.
The attack on Ampil. the last standing stronghold of the KPNLF.
which is led by former Cambodian Prime Minister Son Sann, had been
long anticipated by guerrilla forces and Thai intelligence.
Administration to up Honduras aid
WASHINGTON — The Reagan administration plans to ask Congress
for a 41 percent jump in military aid to Honduras but only a small in
crease in arms aid to El Salvador in the budget being prepared for fiscal
1986, officials said yesterday.
The large increase for Honduras, from $62.5 million this year to $88.2
million in the new budget, is partly a response to Honduran leaders'
complaints that they are bearing the brunt of the U.S. confrontation with
leftist Nicaragua but getting insufficient benefits, the officials said.
"The Hondurans are in the front line, facing a major buildup of
Nicaragua's military strength, and they need more help." a State De
partment official said.
The leveling off of requests for aid to EI Salvador after several years of
massive increases reflects new confidence in the ability of the Salvadoran
army to hold its own against leftist guerrillas, they said.
The budget, to be submitted to Congress Feb. 4, proposes $ 132.6 mil
lion in military aid to El Salvador in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, a 4
percent increase over the $127.2 million appropriated by Congress this
year.
El Salvador received a peak of $197 million in U.S. military aid in fis
cal 1984. Undersecretary of Defense Fred Fkle said recently that he ex
pects aid levels to begin declining soon because of the Salvadorans' im
proved military performance.
"The tactics have improved; they're more effective and. very impor
tantly. the Salvadoran armed forces can now count on a steady flow of
U.S. assistance." Ikle said.
No request is planned for a supplemental appropriation of military aid
for El Salvador this year, the officials said. It would be the first time in
four years that no mid-vear appropriation would be sought.
