# Start of talks 'businesslike'
## 
### 
GENEVA. Switzerland — Secre
tary tit State George Shultz and So
viet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko met yesterday tor almost
seven hours — two hours longer than
originally planned — in an apparently
businesslike opening' of renewed
U.S.-Soviet arms control talks.
The two usually dour men laughed
and bantered in seeming good spirits
as they returned to the bargaining
table after lunch, a sharp contrast
with the more reserved start to the
morning session.
But there was no way to tell if the
smiles were a sign of progress or
merely a public relations ploy. Nei
ther delegation would provide more
than the most sketchy information
about the substance of the talks.
In a break with the usual procedure
at such meetings, the U.S. side did
not brief reporters after the session
adjourned for the day. Instead the
State Department issued a terse
statement, listing only the length of
the sessions, held in the morning at
the Soviet mission to the U.N.
European headquarters here and in
the afternoon at the U.S. mission.
Both sessions had been scheduled
for about two and one-half hours and
both ran almost three and one-half,
delaying the start of a reception
scheduled by the United States to
give a sense of participation to mem
bers of the large U.S. delegation who
are not part of the much smaller
group attending the actual meetings
with Gromyko.
The two days of talks are scheduled
to end today.
The extreme secrecy gave a varied

group of demonstrators a chance to
vie tor attention from the 1.000 jour
nalists and television technicians
com'ring the talks. I he clear winner
in competition was Avital
Shcharansky. wife of imprisoned So
viet Jewish dissident Anatoly
Slwharansky. She called a news con
ference to urge Shultz to raise her
husband's case with Gromyko.
Wearing a light blue skirt, white
blouse and navy blue sweater, with
her hair covered by a scarf in keeping
with orthodox Jewish tradition.
Shcharansky said the Soviet govern
ment has provided no information
about her husband's fate for the last
month, raising fears that he may be
dead or dying.
■It is of urgent importance that the
Soviet authorities be pressed for ac
curate information as to his condi
tion." she said.
Shcharansky met Sunday night
with Assistant Secretary of State
Richard Burt, winning an assurance
that Shultz would raise the issue.
There were published reports last
week that Assistant Defense Secre
tary Richard Perle. perhaps the most
anti-Soviet hardliner in the U.S. gov
ernment, planned to bring
Shcharansky's wife to Geneva to
dramatize Perle's reasons for distrust
ing Soviet intentions. But
Shcharansky denied yesterday that
Perle had anything to do with her ap
pearance.
"I decided to come here by
myself," she said. "I decided to be
here because this is a focus of world
attention."
Anatoly Shcharansky was sen

tenced to 13 years in prison in 1977
on charges of spying for the United
States. His wife, who now lives in Is
rael. said freed Soviet prisoners who
served time with her husband say
"they have never seen a prisoner who
was tortured so much."
Shcharansky said she did not at
tempt to contact Gromyko or any
member of his delegation because she
has given up on direct appeals to the
Soviet authorities.
The State Department issued a
brief written statement saying that
Burt, who is in Geneva but is not one
tit the U.S. officials attending the ac
tual talks, told Shcharansky that, "as
is usually the case, the United States
will raise human rights concerns with
the Soviets/'
Nevertheless, all signs indicated
that Shultz was soft-pedaling the
human rights issue — although it cer
tainly would be raised in passing — in
his talks with Gromyko in an effort to
thaw the current freeze in
Washington-Moscow relations.
The only break in the secrecy sur
rounding the talks came at the start ol
the two meetings when photog
raphers were given a brief opportu
nity to take pictures.
At one point Gromyko interrupted
a reporter asking a question. "No in
terviews." the veteran Soviet
diplomat said in English. "No fair.
At the opening of the morning ses
sion. Shultz. and Gromyko were
restrained, showing neither tension or
joviality.
But at the start of the afternoon
meeting, both men seemed to be in a
jolly mood. Both laughed and joked.

obviously aware that their mood was
being recorded.
The snatches of conversation oxer
heard In reporters centered on tech
niques of taking notes during
meetings. Gromyko held up a sheet
from his writing pad for Shultz to see
and the secretary of state responded
with a hearty laugh.
Shultz told a long anecdote about a
labor arbiter he once knew who
divided his note paper in half, record
ing the points of the two sides on
either half. Gromyko seemed to find
it amusing.
Despite the carefully displayed
good will, however, the sides
remained far apart. The Soviets have
not changed their demand for talks
on the demilitarization of space, and
the United States remains committed
to continuing its research program
aimed at discovering a defensive sys
tem that would stop incoming ballistic
missiles.
However, there were reports that
Shultz has been authorized to offer
concessions on the related but far less
emotional issue ol anti-satellite
weapons if enough progress is made
on other topics to warrant it.
The U.S. side was reported to be
ready to postpone its scheduled test
of anti-satellite weapons during the
duration of arms control talks if the
two countries can agree to resume
them. There was no indication of
whether Gromyko would accept that
basis for restoring full-scale negotia
tions, which were broken off 13
months ago.
