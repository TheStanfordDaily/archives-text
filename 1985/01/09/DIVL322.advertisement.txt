I Kennedy announces no-smoking policy and guidelines
l OFFICE OF THE PRUSIDIN I
Dear Fellow Members of the Stanford Community:
The Stanford University No-Smoking Policy and Guidelines, adopted in late November by the
? Deans' Council and Administrative Council, became effective January 1, 1985. At Stanford,
S 99% of medical students. 94% of students generally, and approximately 85% of laculty and staff are
!i non-smokers, whereas nationally 68% are non-smokers. Thus the vast majority welcome this event
i as a recognition of what is essentially a non-smoking culture at Stanford. But for those who do
i smoke, it will require considerable adjustment. To the smokers, let me say that we recognize an
obligation to all our colleagues, that we will do all we can to ease the transition. Smoking will be
permitted in specified areas in as many buildings as can accommodate them. For those who wish
I access to quit-smoking programs, consultation, or advice, the HELP Center, the Health Improve
js ment Program (HIP), and Cowell Student Health Center should be contacted.
'i The evidence of serious health hazards from tobacco smoke for smokers has been conclusive for
5 some time. New evidence indicates effects from sidestream or secondhand smoke. An analysis of
research done for the Environmental Protection Agency estimates between 500 and 5.000 people die
t each year from cancer caused by inhaling the smoke of other people's cigarettes — making tobacco
smoke the country's most dangerous airborne carcinogen
| As Stanford's policy states, our eventual goal is a smoke-free environment. Our immediate elfort.
however, is to approach smoke-free conditions for the vast majority of non-smokers by confining
smoking to fully enclosed indoor spaces designated "Smoking Permitted and by segregating smok
i ers and non-smokers in dining areas. Unfortunately some buildings may not be able to provide sepa
rate smoking-permitted areas; this may inconvenience those wishing to smoke by requiring them to
I go outside or to adjacent buildings.
* Speaking on behalf of the Deans and Vice Presidents. I express our appreciation to all of you for
j: your understanding, your assistance, and your cooperation as we make the adjustments this new
policy requires.
jj Sincerely.
"j) o.a
