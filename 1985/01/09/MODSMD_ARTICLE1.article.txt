# Res Ed says no to room rentals
## 
### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
In what may come as bad news to
students who hoped to make a few
bucks over Super Bowl weekend, a
memorandum warns that it is a viola
tion of the University residence
agreement to rent campus rooms,
suites, apartments and lounges to
non-residents.
Copies of the letter, signed by
Norm Robinson, dean of Residential
Education, will be distributed today
under the doors of all on-campus stu
dent living units. Robinson said fail
ure to comply with the policy could
result in loss of housing privileges.
Robinson said "it's a strong
likelihood" that students will attempt
to rent out their rooms, but these
hopes are nothing more than "wishful
thinking" on the part of would-be
entrepreneurs.
"Most of the people who come to
the game are real high rollers; they
wouldn't want to stay in dorm
rooms," Robinson said.
He added that Res Ed will have
"no verification procedures" to
ensure that violations do not occur.
The Daily has received several calls
from students trying to find out-of
towners who want to sublease rooms.
The memo also urges students to

take extra security precautions before
and during the Super Bowl game,
which will be played Sunday, Jan. 20
at 3 p.m. in Stanford Stadium. Robin
son advises students to lock their
doors at all times and to report any
suspicious people to the police.
To enhance security, all exterior
doors will be locked over the
weekend, requiring students to carry
room keys at all times. In addition,
Res Ed will hire student guards to pa
trol the exterior doors of all dormi
tories and Row houses on a regular
basis.
Robinson points out that security
problems may be increased bfecause
many students will be off-campus for
the three-day weekend. Monday. Jan.
21 is a University holiday com
memorating the birth of Martin Luth
er King, Jr.
