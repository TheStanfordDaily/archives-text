# Res Ed says no to room rentals
## 
### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
In what may come as bad news to
students who hoped to make a few
bucks over Super Bowl weekend, a
memorandum warns that it is a viola
tion of the University residence
agreement to rent campus rooms,
suites, apartments and lounges to
non-residents.
Copies of the letter, signed by
Norm Robinson, dean of Residential
Education, will be distributed today
under the doors of all on-campus stu
dent living units. Robinson said fail
ure to comply with the policy could
result in loss of housing privileges.
Robinson said "it's a strong
likelihood" that students will attempt
to rent out their rooms, but these
hopes are nothing more than "wishful
thinking" on the part of would-be
entrepreneurs.
"Most of the people who come to
the game are real high rollers; they
wouldn't want to stay in dorm
rooms," Robinson said.
He added that Res Ed will have
"no verification procedures" to
ensure that violations do not occur.
The Daily has received several calls
from students trying to find out-of
towners who want to sublease rooms.
The memo also urges students to

take extra security precautions before
and during the Super Bowl game,
which will be played Sunday, Jan. 20
at 3 p.m. in Stanford Stadium. Robin
son advises students to lock their
doors at all times and to report any
suspicious people to the police.
To enhance security, all exterior
doors will be locked over the
weekend, requiring students to carry
room keys at all times. In addition,
Res Ed will hire student guards to pa
trol the exterior doors of all dormi
tories and Row houses on a regular
basis.
Robinson points out that security
problems may be increased bfecause
many students will be off-campus for
the three-day weekend. Monday. Jan.
21 is a University holiday com
memorating the birth of Martin Luth
er King, Jr.
Super Bowl Notes:
Winners of the faculty/staff ticket
draw should purchase their tickets
Jan. 9to 11 from 3to 5 p.m. at the
Super Bowl trailer near Gate Two at
the south end of Stanford Stadium.
Five thousand faculty and staff mem
bers — half of those eligible — vied
for 50 pairs of tickets. Winners were
notified by mail in late December.
I'he tickets cost $60 each. . . .
Fans attending Super Howl XIX
will not be permitted to carry any
bottles, cans or coolers into the
stadium. Although the University al
lows fans to bring containers to Stan
ford football games, the National
Football League is concerned that
overzealous spectators might hurl a
beer or bourbon bottle and injure
someone. Beer and wine will be on
sale at concession stands inside the
stadium. . . .
In addition to containers, the list of

items prohibited inside the stadium
on game day includes umbrellas, ban
ners, horns, fireworks, weapons and
animals. . . .
Police expect more than 45,000
cars and 1,000 buses to enter the
campus for the game from Highway
101 and Interstate 280. Only those
cars with authentic Super Bowl tick
ets will be permitted to park in the
game parking lots at a cost of $5 and
$10 per car; others will be routed to
El Camino Real. Parking lots will
open at 8:30 a.m. and stadium doors
will open at 12:15 p.m. for the 3 p.m.
contest. Signs along Highway 101 will
direct fans to the Embarcadero Road
exit, but police acknowledge that
traffic jams on University Avenue in
downtown Palo Alto could be im
mense.
