Of diets and dates
Why have Crown Publishers been advertising their
book on finding beautiful college women in The Daily
Princetonian?
Why was Princeton University picked as a test site for
the New Cambridge Diet Plan?
Recent pages of The Daily Princetonian seem to be
saying, indirectly, that the women at this Ivy League
school are not so attractive.
The ad for the book, titled "Where the Girls Are
Today," offers to provide the men of Princeton with "the
latest advice on what to wear and how to pick up girls,
plus where to hang out and what types of girls to expect at
each school."

To help male undergrads at Princeton find attractive
women, the book's authors personally conducted
"research" at 81 schools.
Maybe the reason Princeton men need to look else
where is that the university's co-eds need to lose some
weight.
Evidently, the company selling the diet (the same com
pany that brought us the Mark Eden Bust Developer and
reducing pants attached to vacuum cleaners), thinks that
someone at this Ivy League institution needs to lose
weight, because the redesigned diet is being tested in the
Princeton/Trenton, New Jersey area.
Princeton men must not have an admissions dean as
benevolent as Dean Fred to let in attractive females.
Gordon Schmierer, it's a good thing that you didn't go

to Princeton University.
Drinking for success
Here's a little pro-drinking publicity in an age of rising
drinking ages and renewed concern about problems
created by alcohol.
According to the University of Southern California's
newspaper, the Daily Trojan, two men from Los Angeles
have formed a club called Successful Drinkers.
Joe Grein and Dan Ketchum, former roommates at the
University of Massachusetts, founded the club after
moving out to Southern California and discovering a bad


attitude toward drinking.
"We were both amazed at the
negativity towards alcohol in Califor
nia. You see, most people are suc
cessful drinkers. Instead of focusing
on the minority of abusers, we
wanted to focus on the majority of re
sponsible drinkers," Ketchum told
the Daily Trojan.
The club now has more than 1,000
members all over the world, and
Grein and Ketchum say they want to
make Successful Drinkers their
career. However, the two claim they
do not try to force their beliefs about
drinking onto others.
"There is plenty of literature
available, and we like to talk to
people about drinking," Ketchum
said. "We're not really preaching, but
we believe the place to learn about
drinking is in a bar."
"It's an American custom," Grein
said. "Alcohol has so many good
qualities: good taste, releases tension,
enhances food, moderate use in
creases the lifespan."
