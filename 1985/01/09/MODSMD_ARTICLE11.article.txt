## The 						Stanford Daily Keeping the system safe 
### 
First, abortion clinics are bombed by pro-life
supporters. Then, a man shoots four teenagers on
a New York subway. What's the response to
these acts of vigilante violence?
Applause.
Some citizens of the United States, a nation
that has condemned terrorist acts around the
world, now condone individuals who take the law
into their own hands.
In the first instance, pro-lifers involved in the
bombings, as well as some not directly involved,
have no qualms about destroying abortion
facilities and possibly pro-choice lives.
Their rationale?
Abortion is wrong.
In the second instance, New Yorkers, who
have long been threatened by thieves in the sub
ways, applaud the shootings.
To some people abortion is wrong, to all
people stealing is wrong. But it is the responsibil

ity of our court system to define our laws and the
responsibility of our law enforcement system to
enforce them. It is not the responsibility of indi
viduals. In our system — based on the freedoms
of thought and expression — there is plenty of
room for anti-abortionists to express their
opinions against the majority. There is no room,
however, for terrorism.
Granted, the system is slow and sometimes in
effective, but we must work within its framework.
Society will cease to function if individuals feel
they can play prosecutor, judge and jury. Instead
of applauding acts of terrorism, those concerned
must work through the existing system. One can
act to strengthen a police department or work
through the democratic system for legislation that
supports certain views.
Violence is not the answer. Observing the law
is. Condoning those who break the law only hurts
the system we all rely on.
