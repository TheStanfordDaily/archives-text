## Dead end for American policy in Nicaragua 
### 
President Reagan's re-election has in
creased the fears of a possible invasion of
Nicaragua. His enormous popularity, and the
idea that the Americans who voted for him
would support almost every one of his deci
sions, may encourage some sectors of the ad
ministration to take a major step in
Nicaragua. I would like to argue, however,
from an Ibero-American point of view, that
an invasion of Sandino's land by U.S. troops
would result in a moral, political and perhaps
even in a military disaster for the United
States.
Let me start by granting a point to Reagan,
a point that every serious observer of the

VIEWPOINT

Nicaraguan process has to acknowledge, to
wit, that the Sandinist regime (or at least an
important part of it) is Marxist and that its ul
timate goal is to establish a socialist economic
system in Nicaragua. Whether you like that
kind of system or not is irrelevant here. As
suming that the United States wants to
prevent the Sandinistas from attaining that
objective, the question is whether a military
invasion is the only or the best way to do it. 1
think that it is not and, moreover, that it
would be counterproductive.
From a moral point of view.
In spite of the image that Americans have
of their own country, namely as a nation com
mitted to freedom and to the best causes of
man, America's record in this respect in
Ibero-America is rather poor. Unfortunately,
the name of Lincoln's country has been asso
ciated with the most brutal and arbitrary dic
tatorships in that part of the continent. Some
may believe that this is an unimportant
idealistic point, that what really matters is po
litical or military efficacy, but the truth is that
Ibero-American youths are very sensitive to
the behavior of the United States in that
region and many are becoming increasingly
alienated by the United States.
Indeed, the Sandinist movement started
originally as a reaction against the last occu
pation of Nicaragua by American troops,
from 1926 to 1933, and it took power after
overthrowing with the force of a hurricane
one of the most hated tyrants ever in Ibero-
America, most unfortunately a client of the
United States. His National Guard was per
ceived by the Nicaraguan people as an occu
pation army serving (?) the interests of the
United States and, above all, as a criminal or
ganization ready to torture and kill the oppo
nents of the dictator.
Some of the Contras are not, as Reagan
called them all, "freedom fighters"; they are

former members of the National Guard and
so, given the structure of that organization,
they must have taken part in the torture and
murder of innocent people during the time of
Somoza. It is already a moral defeat for the
United States to have to support that kind of
individual, but the moral cost of invading
Nicaragua just could not be measured. An
enormous proportion of the Ibero-American
youth would become forever incapable of
perceiving any moral principle in the policy of
the United States toward their countries. I
leave it to the reader to decide whether it
would not be an enormous disgrace for
America if that happened.
From a political point of view.
After the revolution of 1979, the Sandinists
found themselves suddenly in a very curious
situation: Contrary to their own expectations,
the destruction of the National Guard gave
them the real possibility of concentrating all
the power of the state in their hands. The
temptation to do so was enormous. Mao Tse
Tung had said that the source of power of the
state is the gun and after the revolution it
turned out that the gun was in the hands of
the Sandinists, who had pledged to build a
pluralistic society.
My main contention with the Sandinists is
that they have succumbed up to a point to the
Maoist temptation and abused their position
in the Nicaraguan society in order to impose
their own political program. This does not
mean, however, that they have already
destroyed the capitalist class or private enter
prise. In spite of the fact that the Sandinists do
not seem to be prepared "to put a brake on
the powers of the state," as the Sandinist offi
cial Carlos Nunez Tellez expressed it, I think
that there is still enough room for political
maneuvering in Nicaragua.
President-elect Daniel Ortega declared
recently that private property (of means of
production) will not be banned from
Nicaragua. What this means is that the San
dinists are opening a political and economical
space for the capitalist class. However, in
stead of relying on a dictator to guarantee
their privileges (more feudalistic than
capitalistic, to be sure) and huge benefits with
minimal investment and risk, this class will
now have to work hard in order to convince
the people of Nicaragua that they will be bet
ter off in a regime of free enterprise than in a
bureaucratic centralized economy (up to now
the Nicaraguan people do not seem to have
obtained many benefits from capitalism).
In spite of all the difficulties, 1 think that
this still can be done, maybe with the help and
the pressure of the United States. What is not
right — I think — is for these individuals to

expect that the Americans will do all the work
for them. One of the greatest political dangers
that I see in the event of an invasion of
Nicaragua is that if the capitalist class still has
a chance to sell its project to the people, after
the invasion they would appear as dependent
in an unacceptable way upon the United
States; indeed, they would appear in a posi
tion similar to that of the Somoza dynasty,

lacking all political prestige in the eyes of the
people and, as I shall argue in a moment, sup
ported only by the guns of a new National
Guard. Is this a political solution for
Nicaragua which is convenient for the Ameri
can interests? For how long?
From a military point of view.
Nicaragua is not Grenada. If the combined
forces found little resistance in Grenada, the
assault on Nicaragua represents a major mili
tary undertaking. Do not be misled by the size
of the country. Recall the resistance of the In
dians of Monimbo against the National Guard
in the times of Somoza. Using only .22 caliber
rifles, machetes and even stones, they held off
a well-equipped force for an entire week!
(This episode is one of the origins of the San
dinist revolution.)

Leaving all rhetoric aside, the American
forces would find a Monimbo virtually in
every neighborhood of every town. The San
dinist regime has contingency plans to provide
modern sub-machine guns for about half a
million men through the CDSs (Committees
of Sandinist Defense), which operate
everywhere. What this means is that the fight
would have to be house by house against a

fairly well-armed force which, moreover,
would be defending its own land and many of
whose members have previous experience in
combat.
Still, there is no doubt that the American
forces could win control over the major cities
at the expense of heavy casualties on both
sides. But yet this would be just the beginning
of an endless war in Central America which,
frankly speaking, 1 do not see how the United
States can win. On the other hand, the com
munists would be happy to fight that war.
After all, Ernesto "Che" Guevara's slogan
was, "To create one, two, many Vietnams" in
Ibero-America. What some Marxists want in
Ibero-America is a global "war of liberation"
completely out of the control of the United
States. An American invasion of Nicaragua

might provide a good occasion to start that
.war.
It is more likely, however, that no such war
would start after an American invasion of
Nicaragua. Rather, it looks like American
forces would have to occupy the territory for
some time until they build a repressive force
— maybe using some of the contras now fight
ing in the countryside. This force would be a
new National Guard whose task would be to
maintain a certain class in power against the
leftist guerrillas which — you can bet —
would be operating all of the time against the
U.S.-backed regime. It seems to me that this
back-to-good-ol'-Somoza perspective is a
dead end for American policy in the region
which would have no way out that could not
be implemented today — prior to the killings
of both American and Nicaraguan individ
uals.
There is a real solution for Nicaragua, and
that solution is close. The solution is to
negotiate with the Sandinists using and
widening the political space provided by Pres
ident Ortega. The Americans — usually able
and good-willed people — could do mar
velous things using that space. The people of
Ibero-America appreciate gestures very
much. But Americans could do much more
than just gesture in Nicaragua. There are
many needs in Nicaragua. Why not, for in
stance, instead of sending contras to kill
people, prepare a huge plan of American in
vestments there? I am thinking of a very spe
cial plan, a plan especially designed for the
needs of Nicaragua, to solve the problems of
Nicaragua and respecting the environment,
the customs and the laws of Nicaragua.
Instead of isolating the Sandinists, and
throwing them into the arms of the Soviet
Union as was so clumsily done with Cuba, it
might be better to learn from that historical
lesson and increase American influence
within Nicaragua making the Sandinists more
dependent on the United States and, above
all, showing the people that America can
make significant contributions to the solution
of their problems. The point is that capitalism
must compete within Nicaragua against other
proposals showing that it is a better option. I
think that something like this is the message
ot President Ortega. The United States
should take advantage of that opportunity
within the framework of the Contadora
Group accord for peace in the region.
America needs a less arrogant and more im
aginative approach to the Nicaraguan ques
tion. She has more than enough talent and
resources to do so.

called them all, "freedom fighters"; they are

former members of the National Guard and
so, given the structure of that organization,
they must have taken part in the torture and
murder of innocent people during the time of
Somoza. It is already a moral defeat for the
United States to have to support that kind of
individual, but the moral cost of invading
Nicaragua just could not be measured. An
enormous proportion of the Ibero-American
youth would become forever incapable of
perceiving any moral principle in the policy of
the United States toward their countries. I
leave it to the reader to decide whether it
would not be an enormous disgrace for
America if that happened.
From a political point of view.
After the revolution of 1979, the Sandinists
found themselves suddenly in a very curious
situation: Contrary to their own expectations,
the destruction of the National Guard gave
them the real possibility of concentrating all
the power of the state in their hands. The
temptation to do so was enormous. Mao Tse
Tung had said that the source of power of the
state is the gun and after the revolution it
turned out that the gun was in the hands of
the Sandinists, who had pledged to build a
pluralistic society.
My main contention with the Sandinists is
that they have succumbed up to a point to the
Maoist temptation and abused their position
in the Nicaraguan society in order to impose
their own political program. This does not
mean, however, that they have already
destroyed the capitalist class or private enter
prise. In spite of the fact that the Sandinists do
not seem to be prepared "to put a brake on
the powers of the state," as the Sandinist offi
cial Carlos Nunez Tellez expressed it, I think
that there is still enough room for political
maneuvering in Nicaragua.
President-elect Daniel Ortega declared
recently that private property (of means of
production) will not be banned from
Nicaragua. What this means is that the San
dinists are opening a political and economical
space for the capitalist class. However, in
stead of relying on a dictator to guarantee
their privileges (more feudalistic than
capitalistic, to be sure) and huge benefits with
minimal investment and risk, this class will
now have to work hard in order to convince
the people of Nicaragua that they will be bet
ter off in a regime of free enterprise than in a
bureaucratic centralized economy (up to now
the Nicaraguan people do not seem to have
obtained many benefits from capitalism).
In spite of all the difficulties, 1 think that
this still can be done, maybe with the help and
the pressure of the United States. What is not
right — I think — is for these individuals to

expect that the Americans will do all the work
for them. One of the greatest political dangers
that I see in the event of an invasion of
Nicaragua is that if the capitalist class still has
a chance to sell its project to the people, after
the invasion they would appear as dependent
in an unacceptable way upon the United
States; indeed, they would appear in a posi
tion similar to that of the Somoza dynasty,

lacking all political prestige in the eyes of the
people and, as I shall argue in a moment, sup
ported only by the guns of a new National
Guard. Is this a political solution for
Nicaragua which is convenient for the Ameri
can interests? For how long?
From a military point of view.
Nicaragua is not Grenada. If the combined
forces found little resistance in Grenada, the
assault on Nicaragua represents a major mili
tary undertaking. Do not be misled by the size
of the country. Recall the resistance of the In
dians of Monimbo against the National Guard
in the times of Somoza. Using only .22 caliber
rifles, machetes and even stones, they held off
a well-equipped force for an entire week!
(This episode is one of the origins of the San
dinist revolution.)

Leaving all rhetoric aside, the American
forces would find a Monimbo virtually in
every neighborhood of every town. The San
dinist regime has contingency plans to provide
modern sub-machine guns for about half a
million men through the CDSs (Committees
of Sandinist Defense), which operate
everywhere. What this means is that the fight
would have to be house by house against a

fairly well-armed force which, moreover,
would be defending its own land and many of
whose members have previous experience in
combat.
Still, there is no doubt that the American
forces could win control over the major cities
at the expense of heavy casualties on both
sides. But yet this would be just the beginning
of an endless war in Central America which,
frankly speaking, 1 do not see how the United
States can win. On the other hand, the com
munists would be happy to fight that war.
After all, Ernesto "Che" Guevara's slogan
was, "To create one, two, many Vietnams" in
Ibero-America. What some Marxists want in
Ibero-America is a global "war of liberation"
completely out of the control of the United
States. An American invasion of Nicaragua

might provide a good occasion to start that
.war.
It is more likely, however, that no such war
would start after an American invasion of
Nicaragua. Rather, it looks like American
forces would have to occupy the territory for
some time until they build a repressive force
— maybe using some of the contras now fight
ing in the countryside. This force would be a
new National Guard whose task would be to
maintain a certain class in power against the
leftist guerrillas which — you can bet —
would be operating all of the time against the
U.S.-backed regime. It seems to me that this
back-to-good-ol'-Somoza perspective is a
dead end for American policy in the region
which would have no way out that could not
be implemented today — prior to the killings
of both American and Nicaraguan individ
uals.
There is a real solution for Nicaragua, and
that solution is close. The solution is to
negotiate with the Sandinists using and
widening the political space provided by Pres
ident Ortega. The Americans — usually able
and good-willed people — could do mar
velous things using that space. The people of
Ibero-America appreciate gestures very
much. But Americans could do much more
than just gesture in Nicaragua. There are
many needs in Nicaragua. Why not, for in
stance, instead of sending contras to kill
people, prepare a huge plan of American in
vestments there? I am thinking of a very spe
cial plan, a plan especially designed for the
needs of Nicaragua, to solve the problems of
Nicaragua and respecting the environment,
the customs and the laws of Nicaragua.
Instead of isolating the Sandinists, and
throwing them into the arms of the Soviet
Union as was so clumsily done with Cuba, it
might be better to learn from that historical
lesson and increase American influence
within Nicaragua making the Sandinists more
dependent on the United States and, above
all, showing the people that America can
make significant contributions to the solution
of their problems. The point is that capitalism
must compete within Nicaragua against other
proposals showing that it is a better option. I
think that something like this is the message
ot President Ortega. The United States
should take advantage of that opportunity
within the framework of the Contadora
Group accord for peace in the region.
America needs a less arrogant and more im
aginative approach to the Nicaraguan ques
tion. She has more than enough talent and
resources to do so.
(Adolfo Garcia de la Sienra is a graduate stu
dent in philosophy.)

President Reagan's re-election has in
creased the fears of a possible invasion of
Nicaragua. His enormous popularity, and the
idea that the Americans who voted for him
would support almost every one of his deci
sions, may encourage some sectors of the ad
ministration to take a major step in
Nicaragua. I would like to argue, however,
from an Ibero-American point of view, that
an invasion of Sandino's land by U.S. troops
would result in a moral, political and perhaps
even in a military disaster for the United
States.
Let me start by granting a point to Reagan,
a point that every serious observer of the

VIEWPOINT

Nicaraguan process has to acknowledge, to
wit, that the Sandinist regime (or at least an
important part of it) is Marxist and that its ul
timate goal is to establish a socialist economic
system in Nicaragua. Whether you like that
kind of system or not is irrelevant here. As
suming that the United States wants to
prevent the Sandinistas from attaining that
objective, the question is whether a military
invasion is the only or the best way to do it. 1
think that it is not and, moreover, that it
would be counterproductive.
From a moral point of view.
In spite of the image that Americans have
of their own country, namely as a nation com
mitted to freedom and to the best causes of
man, America's record in this respect in
Ibero-America is rather poor. Unfortunately,
the name of Lincoln's country has been asso
ciated with the most brutal and arbitrary dic
tatorships in that part of the continent. Some
may believe that this is an unimportant
idealistic point, that what really matters is po
litical or military efficacy, but the truth is that
Ibero-American youths are very sensitive to
the behavior of the United States in that
region and many are becoming increasingly
alienated by the United States.
Indeed, the Sandinist movement started
originally as a reaction against the last occu
pation of Nicaragua by American troops,
from 1926 to 1933, and it took power after
overthrowing with the force of a hurricane
one of the most hated tyrants ever in Ibero-
America, most unfortunately a client of the
United States. His National Guard was per
ceived by the Nicaraguan people as an occu
pation army serving (?) the interests of the
United States and, above all, as a criminal or
ganization ready to torture and kill the oppo
nents of the dictator.
Some of the Contras are not, as Reagan
called them all, "freedom fighters"; they are

former members of the National Guard and
so, given the structure of that organization,
they must have taken part in the torture and

the pressure of the United States. What is not
right — I think — is for these individuals to

expect that the Americans will do all the work
for them. One of the greatest political dangers
that I see in the event of an invasion of
Nicaragua is that if the capitalist class still has
a chance to sell its project to the people, after
the invasion they would appear as dependent
in an unacceptable way upon the United
States; indeed, they would appear in a posi
tion similar to that of the Somoza dynasty,

lacking all political prestige in the eyes of the
people and, as I shall argue in a moment, sup
ported only by the guns of a new National
Guard. Is this a political solution for
Nicaragua which is convenient for the Ameri
can interests? For how long?
From a military point of view.
Nicaragua is not Grenada. If the combined
forces found little resistance in Grenada, the
assault on Nicaragua represents a major mili
tary undertaking. Do not be misled by the size
of the country. Recall the resistance of the In
dians of Monimbo against the National Guard
in the times of Somoza. Using only .22 caliber
rifles, machetes and even stones, they held off
a well-equipped force for an entire week!
(This episode is one of the origins of the San
dinist revolution.)

Leaving all rhetoric aside, the American
forces would find a Monimbo virtually in
every neighborhood of every town. The San
dinist regime has contingency plans to provide
modern sub-machine guns for about half a
million men through the CDSs (Committees
of Sandinist Defense), which operate
everywhere. What this means is that the fight
would have to be house by house against a

fairly well-armed force which, moreover,
would be defending its own land and many of
whose members have previous experience in
combat.
Still, there is no doubt that the American
forces could win control over the major cities
at the expense of heavy casualties on both
sides. But yet this would be just the beginning
of an endless war in Central America which,
frankly speaking, 1 do not see how the United
States can win. On the other hand, the com
munists would be happy to fight that war.
After all, Ernesto "Che" Guevara's slogan
was, "To create one, two, many Vietnams" in
Ibero-America. What some Marxists want in
Ibero-America is a global "war of liberation"
completely out of the control of the United
States. An American invasion of Nicaragua

might provide a good occasion to start that
.war.
It is more likely, however, that no such war
would start after an American invasion of
Nicaragua. Rather, it looks like American
forces would have to occupy the territory for
some time until they build a repressive force
— maybe using some of the contras now fight
ing in the countryside. This force would be a
new National Guard whose task would be to
maintain a certain class in power against the
leftist guerrillas which — you can bet —
would be operating all of the time against the
U.S.-backed regime. It seems to me that this
back-to-good-ol'-Somoza perspective is a
dead end for American policy in the region
which would have no way out that could not
be implemented today — prior to the killings
of both American and Nicaraguan individ
uals.
There is a real solution for Nicaragua, and
that solution is close. The solution is to
negotiate with the Sandinists using and
widening the political space provided by Pres
ident Ortega. The Americans — usually able
and good-willed people — could do mar
velous things using that space. The people of
Ibero-America appreciate gestures very
much. But Americans could do much more
than just gesture in Nicaragua. There are
many needs in Nicaragua. Why not, for in
stance, instead of sending contras to kill
people, prepare a huge plan of American in
vestments there? I am thinking of a very spe
cial plan, a plan especially designed for the
needs of Nicaragua, to solve the problems of
Nicaragua and respecting the environment,
the customs and the laws of Nicaragua.
Instead of isolating the Sandinists, and
throwing them into the arms of the Soviet
Union as was so clumsily done with Cuba, it
might be better to learn from that historical
lesson and increase American influence
within Nicaragua making the Sandinists more
dependent on the United States and, above
all, showing the people that America can
make significant contributions to the solution
of their problems. The point is that capitalism
must compete within Nicaragua against other
proposals showing that it is a better option. I
think that something like this is the message
ot President Ortega. The United States
should take advantage of that opportunity
within the framework of the Contadora
Group accord for peace in the region.
America needs a less arrogant and more im
aginative approach to the Nicaraguan ques
tion. She has more than enough talent and
resources to do so.

President Reagan's re-election has in
creased the fears of a possible invasion of
Nicaragua. His enormous popularity, and the
idea that the Americans who voted for him
would support almost every one of his deci
sions, may encourage some sectors of the ad
ministration to take a major step in
Nicaragua. I would like to argue, however,
from an Ibero-American point of view, that
an invasion of Sandino's land by U.S. troops
would result in a moral, political and perhaps
even in a military disaster for the United
States.
Let me start by granting a point to Reagan,
a point that every serious observer of the

VIEWPOINT

Nicaraguan process has to acknowledge, to
wit, that the Sandinist regime (or at least an
important part of it) is Marxist and that its ul
timate goal is to establish a socialist economic
system in Nicaragua. Whether you like that
kind of system or not is irrelevant here. As
suming that the United States wants to
prevent the Sandinistas from attaining that
objective, the question is whether a military
invasion is the only or the best way to do it. 1
think that it is not and, moreover, that it
would be counterproductive.
From a moral point of view.
In spite of the image that Americans have
of their own country, namely as a nation com
mitted to freedom and to the best causes of
man, America's record in this respect in
Ibero-America is rather poor. Unfortunately,
the name of Lincoln's country has been asso
ciated with the most brutal and arbitrary dic
tatorships in that part of the continent. Some
may believe that this is an unimportant
idealistic point, that what really matters is po
litical or military efficacy, but the truth is that
Ibero-American youths are very sensitive to
the behavior of the United States in that
region and many are becoming increasingly
alienated by the United States.
Indeed, the Sandinist movement started
originally as a reaction against the last occu
pation of Nicaragua by American troops,
from 1926 to 1933, and it took power after
overthrowing with the force of a hurricane
one of the most hated tyrants ever in Ibero-
America, most unfortunately a client of the
United States. His National Guard was per
ceived by the Nicaraguan people as an occu
pation army serving (?) the interests of the
United States and, above all, as a criminal or
ganization ready to torture and kill the oppo
nents of the dictator.
Some of the Contras are not, as Reagan
called them all, "freedom fighters"; they are

former members of the National Guard and
so, given the structure of that organization,
they must have taken part in the torture and
murder of innocent people during the time of
Somoza. It is already a moral defeat for the
United States to have to support that kind of
individual, but the moral cost of invading
Nicaragua just could not be measured. An
enormous proportion of the Ibero-American
youth would become forever incapable of
perceiving any moral principle in the policy of
the United States toward their countries. I
leave it to the reader to decide whether it
would not be an enormous disgrace for
America if that happened.
From a political point of view.
After the revolution of 1979, the Sandinists
found themselves suddenly in a very curious
situation: Contrary to their own expectations,
the destruction of the National Guard gave
them the real possibility of concentrating all
the power of the state in their hands. The
temptation to do so was enormous. Mao Tse
Tung had said that the source of power of the
state is the gun and after the revolution it
turned out that the gun was in the hands of
the Sandinists, who had pledged to build a
pluralistic society.
My main contention with the Sandinists is
that they have succumbed up to a point to the
Maoist temptation and abused their position
in the Nicaraguan society in order to impose
their own political program. This does not
mean, however, that they have already
destroyed the capitalist class or private enter
prise. In spite of the fact that the Sandinists do
not seem to be prepared "to put a brake on
the powers of the state," as the Sandinist offi
cial Carlos Nunez Tellez expressed it, I think
that there is still enough room for political
maneuvering in Nicaragua.
President-elect Daniel Ortega declared
recently that private property (of means of
production) will not be banned from
Nicaragua. What this means is that the San
dinists are opening a political and economical
space for the capitalist class. However, in
stead of relying on a dictator to guarantee
their privileges (more feudalistic than
capitalistic, to be sure) and huge benefits with
minimal investment and risk, this class will
now have to work hard in order to convince
the people of Nicaragua that they will be bet
ter off in a regime of free enterprise than in a
bureaucratic centralized economy (up to now
the Nicaraguan people do not seem to have
obtained many benefits from capitalism).
In spite of all the difficulties, 1 think that
this still can be done, maybe with the help and
the pressure of the United States. What is not
right — I think — is for these individuals to

expect that the Americans will do all the work
for them. One of the greatest political dangers
that I see in the event of an invasion of
