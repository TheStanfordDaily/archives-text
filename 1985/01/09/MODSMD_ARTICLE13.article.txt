## Priorities of housing and foot odor 
### 
us speak of housing. Talking with most
people on the Stanford campus about housing is
akin to broaching the question of foot odor; it's
something we all have and feel no need whatsoever
to talk about. But, unlike foot odor, University
housing is not all pervasive. And like foot odor, it
stinks. Not the residences, mind you — many of

VIEWPOINT

these are very nice, and only a tew of them are
Stern. It's the system that needs work, the means
by which students are housed and living quarters
are alloted.
Uncle Leland has built whole cities of student
housing in the last few years — Sterling Quad.
Governor's Corner — and yet. even today, students
go without a room here in the land of palm trees
and bike lanes. Good folks. Nice people. People
like you. People like me.
What we need is some improvement, some
shaking up in the housing administration.
Trouble-shooting is often easier from the outside in
cases like these, so I've drawn up a list of proposals.
Submitted for your approval:
All Freshmen Live in Branner
Simple, isn't it? Solutions need not be intricate.
Many freshmen I have spoken with profess to have
severely enjoyed their first-year tenure at Branner.
Many suggest it's an experience all freshmen
should be exposed to. Absolutely right. How many
students are in your standard-issue frosh class these
days — fifteen, sixteen hundred? Great. Mom al
ways used to say. "Son. when you go off to college,
do yourself a favor and live in a small, cramped
room with many, many other students." Mom had
a real handle on peer pressure. Adversity builds
freshmen.
All Fral Guys Live at the DL 1 house
Wonderfully similar to the prior solution — con
sistency is important when developing a full-scale

plan. There's been a lot of talk lately about kicking
all the frats off campus, and many of my frat
buddies feel that this is unfair. Sure is. Removing
all frats is a narrow-minded solution. Let's leave
'em the Delta Upsilon house. Heck, it's a fun and a
friendly place, isn't it? Seems like all the brothers
would relish the chance to live under one spacious,
specious roof. This would allow them to participate
in a wealth of intra-house activities which always
seemed so bothersome when the frats were scat
tered hither and yon across the campus. This action
would, it is my considered opinion, open up lots of
housing in the Stanford area. Now things are really
starting to look up.
Establish Salvage Rights
Seems like folks are just tooooo complacent
about where they live these days. Say — wouldn't

Want a room? Take a
look around. Find one
that's open and move in.

all that change if we put a little something like this
into the works: "Leaving one's room door open
shall be taken as an invitation to enter and occupy
said room, and this means your stereo and your
class notes, too." Want a room? Take a look
around. Find one that's open and move in.
Granted, returning former occupants can be a
pesky problem. One of my favorite explanations
(always preceded by a firm handshake) runs like
this: "Greetings. Once, this was your room and
your stuff. No longer. Mine now. Well, see you
around, huh?" Spoken with a sure voice and in the
company of several large friends, this never fails to
elicit the proper good-sportsman-like attitude of

utter resignation. Note that such a policy makes
those with rooms much more conscientious, and
makes "just looking" a lot more fun. Caveat
Emptor!
Housing preference alphabetical by last name;
Priority for those six feet and taller; Special priority
for Alaskan Irish Catholic students who once almost
shook hands with Jerrv Ford.
Ideas whose time have come. First of all, let's as
sign housing on the good old alphabetical bijisis that
worked so well in grade school — you know, Joey
Aamanas is assigned first and /ack Zuckerman
gets to look for a home in East Palo Alto. This
ensures that everything is done fair and square and
that those whose parents saw fit to burden them
with surnames off in the alphabetical deep end are
punished. As for priority, six feet seems like a
handy guideline. Let's assign those people right
away — just give them priority anywhere. Much
simpler than all that running about signing lists and
making dinners and such.
Special priorities? This one is especially well
thought out When you really look at the problem
objectively, the genuine need for Alaskan Irish
Catholic students who once almost shook hands
with Jerry l ord becomes glaringly obvious. It's a
minority interest overlooked for far too long. Why,
perhaps a theme house would be in order. I've got a
gut-level feeling that such a project would be wildly
popular and very crowded to boot. Times-a
wastin'!
Well, there you have it. Four simple steps to a
better, more efficient housing system. Oh, I know
there will be skeptics — change is never painless.
And yet, I believe that these modifications will lead
to a far more livable and enjoyable University envi
ronment.

housing in the last few years — Sterling Quad.
Governor's Corner — and yet. even today, students
go without a room here in the land of palm trees
and bike lanes. Good folks. Nice people. People
like you. People like me.
What we need is some improvement, some
shaking up in the housing administration.
Trouble-shooting is often easier from the outside in
cases like these, so I've drawn up a list of proposals.

All Freshmen Live in Branner
Simple, isn't it? Solutions need not be intricate.
Many freshmen I have spoken with profess to have
severely enjoyed their first-year tenure at Branner.
Many suggest it's an experience all freshmen
should be exposed to. Absolutely right. How many
students are in your standard-issue frosh class these
days — fifteen, sixteen hundred? Great. Mom al
ways used to say. "Son. when you go off to college,
do yourself a favor and live in a small, cramped
room with many, many other students." Mom had
a real handle on peer pressure. Adversity builds
freshmen.
All Fral Guys Live at the DL 1 house
Wonderfully similar to the prior solution — con
sistency is important when developing a full-scale

plan. There's been a lot of talk lately about kicking
all the frats off campus, and many of my frat
buddies feel that this is unfair. Sure is. Removing
all frats is a narrow-minded solution. Let's leave
'em the Delta Upsilon house. Heck, it's a fun and a
friendly place, isn't it? Seems like all the brothers
would relish the chance to live under one spacious,
specious roof. This would allow them to participate
in a wealth of intra-house activities which always
seemed so bothersome when the frats were scat
tered hither and yon across the campus. This action
would, it is my considered opinion, open up lots of
housing in the Stanford area. Now things are really
starting to look up.
Establish Salvage Rights
Seems like folks are just tooooo complacent
about where they live these days. Say — wouldn't

Want a room? Take a
look around. Find one
that's open and move in.

all that change if we put a little something like this
into the works: "Leaving one's room door open
shall be taken as an invitation to enter and occupy
said room, and this means your stereo and your
class notes, too." Want a room? Take a look
around. Find one that's open and move in.
Granted, returning former occupants can be a
pesky problem. One of my favorite explanations
(always preceded by a firm handshake) runs like
this: "Greetings. Once, this was your room and
your stuff. No longer. Mine now. Well, see you
around, huh?" Spoken with a sure voice and in the
company of several large friends, this never fails to
elicit the proper good-sportsman-like attitude of

utter resignation. Note that such a policy makes
those with rooms much more conscientious, and
makes "just looking" a lot more fun. Caveat
Emptor!
Housing preference alphabetical by last name;
Priority for those six feet and taller; Special priority
for Alaskan Irish Catholic students who once almost
shook hands with Jerrv Ford.
Ideas whose time have come. First of all, let's as
sign housing on the good old alphabetical bijisis that
worked so well in grade school — you know, Joey
Aamanas is assigned first and /ack Zuckerman
gets to look for a home in East Palo Alto. This
ensures that everything is done fair and square and
that those whose parents saw fit to burden them
with surnames off in the alphabetical deep end are
punished. As for priority, six feet seems like a
handy guideline. Let's assign those people right
away — just give them priority anywhere. Much
simpler than all that running about signing lists and
making dinners and such.
Special priorities? This one is especially well
thought out When you really look at the problem
objectively, the genuine need for Alaskan Irish
Catholic students who once almost shook hands
with Jerry l ord becomes glaringly obvious. It's a
minority interest overlooked for far too long. Why,
perhaps a theme house would be in order. I've got a
gut-level feeling that such a project would be wildly
popular and very crowded to boot. Times-a
wastin'!
Well, there you have it. Four simple steps to a
better, more efficient housing system. Oh, I know
there will be skeptics — change is never painless.
And yet, I believe that these modifications will lead
to a far more livable and enjoyable University envi
ronment.

us speak of housing. Talking with most
people on the Stanford campus about housing is
akin to broaching the question of foot odor; it's
something we all have and feel no need whatsoever
to talk about. But, unlike foot odor, University
housing is not all pervasive. And like foot odor, it
stinks. Not the residences, mind you — many of

these are very nice, and only a tew of them are
Stern. It's the system that needs work, the means
by which students are housed and living quarters
are alloted.
