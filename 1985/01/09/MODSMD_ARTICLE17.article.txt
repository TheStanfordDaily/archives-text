# Let's buy a bar

### 
The Successful Drinkers could find
at least a few eager members for their
organization at Montana State Uni
versity.
The MSU Exponent reports that
two students proposed a ballot initia
tive to gut student government in or
der to enable the establishment of an
off-campus bar for students.
The bill suggested ended funding
for intramural sports, the homecom

ing committee, the student govern
ment's tutorial program and the stu
dent government's administration.
The bar would have admitted stu
dents to all events at no charge and
would have dispensed "over-the
counter contraceptives . . . tree, to all
students," sponsors told the campus
newspaper.
Unfortunately, the measure failed
to receive enough signatures to make
it onto the ballot.
