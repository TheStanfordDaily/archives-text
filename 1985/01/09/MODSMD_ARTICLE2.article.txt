# Faculty sees student zeal for religion

### KENT MILLER 
In this, the second of a two-part series, The Daily takes a
look at religious life at Stanford from a faculty perspective.

In the reception area of the Hillel Center, in the base
ment of the Old Union Clubhouse, administrator Marina
Bertelli is tearing blue cloth into strips. These will be used
as armbands in a protest for that afternoon.
Rabbi Ari Cartun, executive director of the Hillel
Foundation, shows a visitor into his office. He clears a seat
by putting aside an antelope horn. This is a shofar, or war
horn from Biblical days, he explains. "We blow it on days
of distress, so we're taking it to the rally with us," says
Cartun. 1
Students are still interested in religion, Cartun says."I
would say that 50 percent of what people talk about after
2 o'clock in the morning is that kind of stuff."
Cartun estimates that between 100 and 200 of the 700
students on Hillel's mailing list are highly involved in the
group.
"This year we have the most active social action com
mittee we've ever had," because of student leaders, says
Cartun.
Rev. Eugene Boyle, director of the Newman Center,
says students continue to look for spiritual guidance from
religion. "If religion and Christianity in particular isn't
giving me instruction about what the hell it's all about,
Alfie, then what's the point of doing it?"
Boyle says students are attending church more today
than they did a few years ago. He estimates that there are
at least 2,000 Catholics on campus and that 20 percent of
these are active in the Newman Center.
Boyle has a narrow office in the Old Union Clubhouse.
Walking into the room is like walking into a a refrigerator.
The room is sparsely furnished.
Boyle discusses changes in students' religious attitudes
over the years. Twenty years ago, he says,"it was kind of
a leisure class. People could stop out of school for a
year. . . . But given the economy today, they have to stay
put." As a result, Boyle has seen an increase in the num
ber of students organizing volunteer work.
"There is a basic understanding on the part of students
that while they can't do a heck of a lot while they re at
Stanford, their religious beliefs demand that they do
something for their brothers and sisters in need.
The office of the dean of the Chapel is in the Round
Room, behind Memorial Auditorium. The reception area
has a dome ceiling and much wood, iron and leather.
Dean of the Chapel Robert Hamerton-Kelly oversees
religious activities on campus. "1 think there s a slight in
crease in interest," says Hamerton-Kelly. "If there s a
resurgence in patriotism, at least it drags religion along
with it."
He estimates that 75 to 90 students attend the inter
denominational services in Memorial Auditorium each
Sunday. But many students who do not join a group or at
tend services are still religious, he says.
"There are more of them that are interested without
being affiliated to any particular religious group. This is
becuase "spiritual questions are less defined, more in
choate these days than when Christian civilization was in
tact."
"People are more independent in their thinking, says
Hamerton-Kelly.
