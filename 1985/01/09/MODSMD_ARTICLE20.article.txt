## University Creamery: a colorful hangout 
### TRASK LEONARD 
Palo Alto is, well, Palo Alto.
Sometimes the expensive boutiques
and fro/en yogurt hangouts can all
start looking dreadfully similar
But for many Stanford students, a
change of pace is available at the Uni
versity Creamery on University Ave
nue, where they can pull up a chair
and study, talk or people-watch at a
24-hour coffee shop left over from
the 19505.
"I come here to study among nor
mal people," said junior Jeri Lane as
she looked up from her biology notes
and a cup of coffee. "This place is so
different from the typical Palo Alto
place. It's a haven for some rather
strange people, yet at the same time
uniquely cultural."
The Creamery stays open all night,
serving everything from fried fish and
chip specials to thick chocolate
shakes to good coffee to omelettes,
all listed on paper menus. This,
however, is where the comparisons to
any other coffee shops stop.
For one, there are telephones in
every other booth.
"I love calling up my friends at all
hours," said Lane. "However, I do
have to call collect."
But by far the most favorite activity
at the Creamery is people-watching.

"You can come in here at most any
time of the night and find some in
credible characters," said sophomore
Lee Cline, who frequents the
Creamery.
"One man, who dresses in his leath
er jacket, is always sitting in the
same seat at the end of the counter.
When I come in, I am constantly
amazed at how often I see him. He is
either sitting at the counter alone or
playing Pac Man in the corner." Cline
said.
It turns out that this man, Ron Kir
sen, has been at the Creamery on a
regular basis since 1972. Behind his
greased-back hair, long sideburns and
a dark mustache is a soft-spoken and
amiable man.
"I love coming here and seeing all
my old buddies," said Kirsen. "I love
the waiters and waitresses, and espe
cially the Stanford crowd.
"I was a cook at Tresidder for two
years and miss the young people. But
I feel like I belong again here at the
Creamery," explained Kirsen as he
drank a black cup of coffee at his
usual spot.
"I get so used to the routine here
that I can tell what time it is by seeing
who comes in and goes out. It's like

Another regular at the Creamery is
Nick DeCarlo, who sells hot dogs
from a stand across the street.
"I've been coming here for several
years now," said DeCarlo, as he sat
by himself in a booth. "The people
here have become my friends; this is
mv home."

'A good friend of mine was upset over
something last year. I knew only one
thing would cheer her up, and that was
the Creamery.'
— Sophomore Lee Cline

DeCarlo comes from New York,
and since his move out here has
studied photography, worked as a
medic in an ambulance and sold hot
dogs. During Christmas, he collects
toys at his stand for Toys for Tots.

"Especially during the holiday
season, I appreciate the warm atmo
sphere here. The servers are nice, the
food is good and I love the Stanford
students," said DeCarlo.
Student regulars have their own in
teresting stories to tell about the
Creamery.
"I was in here when a woman
passed out at the counter," said Lane.
"They brought the paramedics in and
everything, but nobody seemed to
notice."
Junior Michael Hawley. who spent

a great deal of time last summer in
the Creamery working on the ASSU
Course Guide, recalled one happen
ing.
'One guy didn't have enough
money to pay for a hamburger one

night, so when the manager asked
him to pay, he just stood up, yelled
his head off and walked out the
door," said Hawley.
"Also, just the other night, I saw a
woman dressed in fluorescent green
pants and a hot pink top with a gaud\
blond wig. Her eyes seemed to be
glued open extraordinarily wide, so
much that you could see her whole
eyeball.
"She came in alone, went to the
bathroom, walked back to the front
and bought a gumball. Then, she
left," said Hawley.
The tremendous human element at
the Creamery has even prompted one
student to bring in a depressed friend
to be cheered up.
"A good friend of mine was upset
over something last year," said Cline.
"1 knew only one thing would cheer
her up, and that was the Creamery."
While the Creamer.y has
become increasingly popular among
Stanford students, it has kept its
modest appearance.
"They've created a Midwest atmo
sphere here, similai to the cafe in the
movie 'Diner,' " said senior Mark
Bedoian. "Yet the good thing is that
they don't realize it. That's what
makes it so classy."

'One guy didn't have enough
money to pay for a hamburger one

night, so when the manager asked
him to pay, he just stood up, yelled
his head off and walked out the
door," said Hawley.
"Also, just the other night, I saw a
woman dressed in fluorescent green
pants and a hot pink top with a gaud\
blond wig. Her eyes seemed to be
glued open extraordinarily wide, so
much that you could see her whole
eyeball.
"She came in alone, went to the
bathroom, walked back to the front

The tremendous human element at
the Creamery has even prompted one
student to bring in a depressed friend
to be cheered up.
"A good friend of mine was upset
over something last year," said Cline.
"1 knew only one thing would cheer
her up, and that was the Creamery."
While the Creamer.y has
become increasingly popular among
Stanford students, it has kept its
modest appearance.
"They've created a Midwest atmo
sphere here, similai to the cafe in the
movie 'Diner,' " said senior Mark
Bedoian. "Yet the good thing is that
they don't realize it. That's what
makes it so classy."

regulars all cherish their hangout.
Palo Alto is, well, Palo Alto.
Sometimes the expensive boutiques
and fro/en yogurt hangouts can all
start looking dreadfully similar
But for many Stanford students, a
change of pace is available at the Uni
versity Creamery on University Ave
nue, where they can pull up a chair
and study, talk or people-watch at a
24-hour coffee shop left over from
the 19505.
"I come here to study among nor
mal people," said junior Jeri Lane as
she looked up from her biology notes
and a cup of coffee. "This place is so
different from the typical Palo Alto
place. It's a haven for some rather
strange people, yet at the same time
uniquely cultural."
The Creamery stays open all night,
serving everything from fried fish and
chip specials to thick chocolate
shakes to good coffee to omelettes,
all listed on paper menus. This,
however, is where the comparisons to
any other coffee shops stop.
For one, there are telephones in
every other booth.
"I love calling up my friends at all
hours," said Lane. "However, I do
have to call collect."
But by far the most favorite activity
at the Creamery is people-watching.

"You can come in here at most any
time of the night and find some in
credible characters," said sophomore
Lee Cline, who frequents the
Creamery.
"One man, who dresses in his leath
er jacket, is always sitting in the
same seat at the end of the counter.
When I come in, I am constantly
amazed at how often I see him. He is
either sitting at the counter alone or
playing Pac Man in the corner." Cline
said.
It turns out that this man, Ron Kir

regular basis since 1972. Behind his
greased-back hair, long sideburns and
a dark mustache is a soft-spoken and
amiable man.
"I love coming here and seeing all
my old buddies," said Kirsen. "I love
the waiters and waitresses, and espe
cially the Stanford crowd.
"I was a cook at Tresidder for two
years and miss the young people. But
I feel like I belong again here at the
Creamery," explained Kirsen as he
drank a black cup of coffee at his
usual spot.
