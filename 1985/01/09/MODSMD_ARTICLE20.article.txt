## University Creamery: a colorful hangout 
### TRASK LEONARD 
Palo Alto is, well, Palo Alto.
Sometimes the expensive boutiques
and fro/en yogurt hangouts can all
start looking dreadfully similar
But for many Stanford students, a
change of pace is available at the Uni
versity Creamery on University Ave
nue, where they can pull up a chair
and study, talk or people-watch at a
24-hour coffee shop left over from
the 19505.
"I come here to study among nor
mal people," said junior Jeri Lane as
she looked up from her biology notes
and a cup of coffee. "This place is so
different from the typical Palo Alto
place. It's a haven for some rather
strange people, yet at the same time
uniquely cultural."
The Creamery stays open all night,
serving everything from fried fish and
chip specials to thick chocolate
shakes to good coffee to omelettes,
all listed on paper menus. This,
however, is where the comparisons to
any other coffee shops stop.
For one, there are telephones in
every other booth.
"I love calling up my friends at all
hours," said Lane. "However, I do
have to call collect."
But by far the most favorite activity
at the Creamery is people-watching.

"You can come in here at most any
time of the night and find some in
credible characters," said sophomore
Lee Cline, who frequents the
Creamery.
"One man, who dresses in his leath
er jacket, is always sitting in the
same seat at the end of the counter.
When I come in, I am constantly
amazed at how often I see him. He is
either sitting at the counter alone or
playing Pac Man in the corner." Cline
said.
It turns out that this man, Ron Kir
sen, has been at the Creamery on a
regular basis since 1972. Behind his
greased-back hair, long sideburns and
a dark mustache is a soft-spoken and
amiable man.
"I love coming here and seeing all
my old buddies," said Kirsen. "I love
the waiters and waitresses, and espe
cially the Stanford crowd.
"I was a cook at Tresidder for two
years and miss the young people. But
I feel like I belong again here at the
Creamery," explained Kirsen as he
drank a black cup of coffee at his
usual spot.
"I get so used to the routine here
that I can tell what time it is by seeing
who comes in and goes out. It's like

Junior Jeri Lane uses the University Creamery as a place to study in the
"real world/' and she enjoys the interesting diversions. For some, the
Creamery is an all-night library.

The Creamery is a state-of-the-art diner with typical diner fare. Sopho
more Lee Cline and senior Mark Bedoian like to sip their milkshakes
'50s style.
