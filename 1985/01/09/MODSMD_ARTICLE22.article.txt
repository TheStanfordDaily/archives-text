## Card wrestlers get comeback victory 
### PETER CASTILLO 
Ihe Stanford wrestling team last
night upset the University of Oregon.
20-18, at Maples Pavilion in front of
the largest home crowd since the
wrestling program's reinstatement
five years ago.
It was the Cardinal's first victory
over the Ducks and improves its dual
meet record to 4-1. while Oregon
falls to 7-5.
"I think something special is hap
pening with the team." Stanford
Coach Chris Horpel said. "We are
making a lot of progress over some
difficult obstacles. The wrestlers are
making up for a lack of talent with
emotion and willpower
An example of this was the perfor
mance of 177-pound senior Tom
Mullen, who wrestled despite a fever.
Horpel originally did not want Mul
len to compete, but Mullen did not
want to forfeit his match and cost the
Cardinal six points.
Oregon's Mike Haster started
quickly, getting a 5-0 lead, and led, 5-
1, after the first period. Mullen took
control in the second period and
narrowed the score to 6-4, but could
score no more and lost 7-4.
Horpel feels Mullen's performance
typifies his team in that the wrestlers
are competing with a lot of heart.
The meet started slow for the
Cardinal as it lost its first two
matches. Sophomore B.G. Porter
(118 pounds) was decisioned by
Roberto Pelayo 9-4. Porter trailed
only by a point after two periods, but
Pelayo dominated the final period,
outscoring Porter 5-1, to win the
match.
Stanford junior Neil Wartnik (126
pounds) lost a heartbreaker to James
Hawthorne. The score was tied at
eight in the final minute when Haw
thorne got a two-point takedown for
the 10-8 victory.
The Cardinal registered its first vic
tory at 134 pounds. Junior Jeff Brad
ley took command over Glenn Jarrett

early and coasted to a 12-2 victory.
Stanford's Jeff Hazard, a 142-pound
junior, scored four unanswered
points in the final period to defeat
Tim Curtis 7-3. Hazard's triumph
gave Stanford a 7-6 lead it never
relinquished.
In the most exciting match of the
evening, junior Scott Wiggen (150
pounds) pinned the Ducks' Vince
Hochanadel 30 seconds into the final
period. Wiggen had nearly pinned
Hochanadel in both of the previous
periods before throwing Hochanadel
to the mat and getting the pin.
The Ducks narrowed the lead to
13-9 when Rich O'Shea (158
pounds) beat junior Pete Rogers 3-1.
Stanford freshman Dave Lee (167
pounds) continued his successful
season by decisioning Keith Beutler
6-2. In a touch of irony, Lee was
called for an illegal toe hold by his
father Charles, who filled in as ref
eree when the scheduled official
failed to appear. Dave Lee is now 5-0
in dual meets.
Sophomore Kurt Kassulke (190
pounds) clinched the team victory for
Stanford when he defeated Cal
Thomason 10-6. Kassulke scored a
takedown in the final two seconds of
the second period and was able to
fend off Thomason's attacks in the
final period.
Cardinal freshman heavyweight
Frank Lyles lost, 10-6, to Brad Stew
ard, but showed quickness by
scoring three reversals in the match.
The crowd became a factor in the
Cardinal victory, and this pleased
Horpel.
"I appreciated all the fans who
came, and this did give us a home
court advantage. This is a building
type of thing and the better the team
gets the larger the crowds will
become," he said.
The Cardinal will travel to Biola
University in La Mirada to compete
in the Eagle Invitational Saturday.

period. Wiggen had nearly pinned
Hochanadel in both of the previous
periods before throwing Hochanadel
to the mat and getting the pin.
The Ducks narrowed the lead to
13-9 when Rich O'Shea (158
pounds) beat junior Pete Rogers 3-1.
Stanford freshman Dave Lee (167
pounds) continued his successful
season by decisioning Keith Beutler
6-2. In a touch of irony, Lee was
called for an illegal toe hold by his
father Charles, who filled in as ref
eree when the scheduled official
failed to appear. Dave Lee is now 5-0
in dual meets.
Sophomore Kurt Kassulke (190
pounds) clinched the team victory for
Stanford when he defeated Cal
Thomason 10-6. Kassulke scored a
takedown in the final two seconds of
the second period and was able to
fend off Thomason's attacks in the
final period.
Cardinal freshman heavyweight
Frank Lyles lost, 10-6, to Brad Stew
ard, but showed quickness by
scoring three reversals in the match.
The crowd became a factor in the
Cardinal victory, and this pleased
Horpel.
"I appreciated all the fans who
came, and this did give us a home
court advantage. This is a building
type of thing and the better the team
gets the larger the crowds will
become," he said.
The Cardinal will travel to Biola
University in La Mirada to compete
in the Eagle Invitational Saturday.


Stanford freshman Dave Lee, a 167-pounder, kept his dual meet record
undefeated with a triumph over Oregon's Keith Beutler last night at

Todd Sitrin/Daily
Maples Pavilion. The Cardinal rebounded from a 6-0 deficit to beat the
•Ducks for the first time in five years.
