## DUs to face Res Ed 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
Officials in the Office of Residential Education will
meet with heads of the Delta Upsilon fraternity late this
month to determine what action the University will take
regarding an incident in early December.
Director of the Row Diana Conklin said yesterday that
she would allow Stanford's Interfraternity Council time to
complete its own investigation before meeting formally
with representatives of the fraternity.
On Dec. 1, a third-floor water pipe burst while it was
used for a pull-up contest during a closed fraternity party.
Extensive flood damage to the house was reported, and
Conklin said at the time that police "found mattresses
stacked on the stairway and, in the basement, a floor
Hooded by beer and water, a hole that appeared to be
being used for vomiting, and beer dripping from overhead
rafters."
In a letter to IFC President Rick Hoskins shortly after
the incident, Conklin called the behavior of DU fraternity
members "arroeant, inconsiderate and intolerable."

Conklin said yesterday that the fraternity is currently
not on probation, a situation that "needless to say, could
change dramatically, quite suddenly," should the mem
bers of the fraternity be involved in similar behavior be
tween now and the meeting.
Conklin said the meeting will be scheduled through the
Interfraternity Council.
Hoskins yesterday called the DU's situation "a difficult
issue just to rush," adding that it will take "time to look
into the issue more."
He said he agreed to compile a report on the incident to
be presented to the IFC Jan. 30. An IFC investigation is
currently underway, he said, adding that it will be "a slow
process."
Shortly after the incident. Hoskins said the IFC investi
gation would "deal with the entire history of the DUs."
DU President Mike Minchin said he was "not worrying
about (the pending decision] over break."
He said the DU residence is "all fixed up now, and it
looks good, too."
