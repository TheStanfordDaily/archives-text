Recruited athletes fare well
About 87 percent of recruited ath
letes, like other students, graduate
from Stanford within five years, ac
cording to University Registrar Sally
Mahoney.
This finding, confirming earlier
studies, is based on an individual
analysis of all 563 athletes recruited
by Stanford between 1975 and 1980.
The study was done by Dean Nam
boothiri of the Registrar's Office.
There was no difference in five
year graduation rates between those
recruited as football players (169),
those recruited in other sports (394)
and other undergraduates. Other
sports in which Stanford recruited
athletes include basketball, baseball,
golf, swimming and tennis.
In general, Mahoney said, the aca
demic majors of recruited athletes
were similar to those of other stu
dents, although there may have been
slightly fewer humanities majors
among athletes. There were many
majors in the social sciences, "hard"
sciences — including pre-meds — and
engineering.

More analysis is planned by Nam
boothiri, whose work is based on
names provided by Law Prof. Jack
Friedenthal, Stanford's faculty repre
sentative to the Pacific 10 Confer
ence.
The national average for five-year
graduation from college is about 55
percent.
Depleted uranium sent to SLAC
Three hundred eighty tons of
"depleted"' uranium, to be used as
part of an experiment, is being
shipped from Oak Ridge, Tenn., to
the Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter, SLAC officials said Jan. 3.
The uranium is mildly radioactive,
and appropriate precautions have
been taken, the officials said. Part of
the shipment has already arrived.
The uranium, in the form of the
isotope U" 8 , will be used as part of an
instrument called a calorimeter,
which measures the energy of parti
cles produced in the high-energy col
lisions studied at the accelerator. The
calorimeter will be part of the Stan
ford Linear Collider (SLC), now un
der construction.
