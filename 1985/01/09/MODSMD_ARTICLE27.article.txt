# Big Tim sees all in 1985
## 
### 
It was a cold, damp day in The Dairy as Win
ston Gofen climbed the six stories 10 his flat. He
had just returned from the polling place; The
Dairy was in the midst of yet another election.
Of course, there was no worry as to the
outcome. For as long as Winston could remem
ber, Tim Grief had been leader-in-chief. And he
had been a good leader. In fact, Winston couldn't
think of a time when Big Tim hadn't been leader.
It was reassuring, that.
Winston opened the door and put down his
story assignments. He walked over to the VDT
and turned up the volume. He stared into the
benevolent eyes of Big Tim and slowly began to
do toe-touches to the background music.
"Red Shoes," The Dairy's anthem, was piped
into every home. Every day. All the time.
Winston loved "Red Shoes." He loved
"Trust," "Armed Forces," and most especially,
"Jailhouse Rock." They made him think of Big
Tim.
Winston called Domino's for a large sausage
and-mushroom and then sat in front of the VDT
and got ready for the one-hour munchie hate. He
loved the hate. He hated the Chaparral. As far as
Winston remembered, he had always hated the
Chaparral. And he had always loved Campus

Report.
For as long as Big Tim had been leader. The
Dairy had been at war with Chaparral and at
peace with Campus Report.
The VDT went quiet as Big Tim came on the
screen. He announced that deadlines were being
met, ad lines were being kept low, news coverage
was up 48 percent, speech stories were down 60
percent, new folios were being planned and the
war against Campus Report was going as hoped.
The proverbial light-table was visible at the end
of the backshop tunnel.
Winston was relieved. He had always hated
Campus Report and knew that as long as Big Tim
stayed the course. The Dairy would be in for
smooth sailing.
Winston picked up a piece of Victory Pizza. He
chewed slowly, despising the texture and taste.
Winston thought of the annual hate rally at El
Super Burrito. and he quickly forgot the dreary
pizza.
Winston got undressed and crawled into bed.
He was satisfied with the results of the day's elec
tion, and he knew he would dream of Big Tim.
Once again, Winston was happy. He loved The
Dairy, he loved El Super. But most of all, he
loved Big Tim.
