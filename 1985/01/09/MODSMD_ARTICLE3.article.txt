Broader asset allocations and aggressive in
vestments have paved the way for annual Uni
versity endowment returns that surpass the
average rate for major endowed universities,
according to William Massy, University vice
president for business and finance.
A survey compiled by Cambridge Associates,
a consulting firm specializing in college invest
ments, shows an annual average return of 12
percent on the University's endowment for the
past 10 years. In the same decade, the annual
return for other major endowed institutions
averaged 11 percent.
Massy, noting that Stanford's endowment

now totals $1.1 billion, attributed the Univer
sity's financial success to the quality of its
money managers and a "more aggressive" in
vestment policy, especially in the area of
venture capital. "We're pushing harder (than
other universities)," Massy said.
Forty-five percent of the endowment. Massy
said, is invested in domestic equities, including
companies such as IBM and Hewlett-Packard.
He estimated that the University owns stock in
70 to SO such corporations.
Another 5 percent is invested in small
capitalization companies. Massy characterized
such companies as "emerging companies" that
have just gone public.
