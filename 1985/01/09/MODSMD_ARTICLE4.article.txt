# Stanford gets shuttle center
## 
### BAIE NETZER Senior staff writer 
A student-operated experiment
control center scheduled to operate
during the July flight of the space
shuttle will be set up on campus
through a joint project of NASA and
the University.
The center will involve an initial
transfer of nearly $800,000 worth of
computer equipment from the Uni
versity's Space Telecommunications
and Radioscience Laboratory
(STAR) and other space centers to
the third floor of the Durand Build
ing, located between Terman Engi
neering Center and the Physics
Lecture Hall.
Calling the center "the first of its
kind." Roger Williamson, senior re
search associate at the Stanford
Electronics Laboratory, said the
Stanford facility will be the first space
shuttle center to operate outside of a
NASA or military facility.
According to Williamson, the cen
ter will control the testing of Stanford
space equipment being carried in the
cargo bay of the space shuttle and will
also monitor data received from the
shuttle.
"But experiment control is differ
ent from mission control," William
son said. "We won't have anything to
do with actually controlling the space
shuttle mission."
Besides its operation during the ap
proximate seven days of the space
shuttle mission, the facility will con
tinue with flight-analysis after the
mission and will then remain here
permanently. To emphasize space
station research, the center will be
called Stanford University Network
for Space Telescience Applications
Research (SUNSTAR).
"One of the things we discovered
when we started studying this concept
two years ago was that we needed this
kind of facility anyway," Williamson
said. "We need the communications,
the computers and the displays, so
now we'll have a 24-hour operation."
Williamson said SUNSTAR will
not only monitor the testing of equip
ment but will also provide support to
NASA's center in Houston and edu

cational benefits to the Stanford com
munity.
SUNSTAR will control the testing
of an electron beam gun which will
fire electrons at a satellite. The results
of those fired beams will be moni
tored here and then compared to
radio waves emitted from an antenna
to study the effectiveness of electron
beams and antennas in generating
radio waves.
According to Williamson, the
results of the SUNSTAR-monitored
test may help in developing new tech
nology for communications.
Stanford Instructional Television
Network (SITN) will also be involved
in the operation of SUNSTAR and in
using the SUNSTAR facility for edu
cational purposes.
Williamson said an important com
ponent of the new center will be a
computer that generates video graph
ics similar to television animation.
This animation may be used by SITN
for classroom use.
''We're applying the concept of
animation to illustrate physical
phenomena that can be used in
lectures and in teaching," Williamson
said.
One graduate student has already
spent a week in Salt Lake City learn
ing to use the video graphics com
puter,
The facility has received some
equipment, and graduate and under
graduate students, primarily from the
Electrical Engineering Department,
are now being trained on the com
puters, Williamson said.
Williamson also said he expected
SUNSTAR to eventually expand its
operations.
"These kinds of things grow, and
there's no doubt that we will grow in
time," he said.
Astronauts Owen Garriott and
Byron Lichtenberg will travel to
Stanford in July to participate in the
SUNSTAR operation during the
shuttle mission.
Williamson said he is also hoping to
have space-to-ground communica
tions available at the center during
the space shuttle mission to talk to
the astronauts aboard the shuttle.
