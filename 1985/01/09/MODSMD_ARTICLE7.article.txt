Westmoreland lawyer rests case
NEW YORK — The lawyer for retired Gen. William Westmoreland
rested his $120 million libel ease against CBS yesterday, stressing the
support the general has received from some of nation's former top offi
cials.
After U.S. District Judge Pierre Leval cautioned the jurors to "keep
an open mind," the network's lawyer, David Boies, opened the defense
by submitting excerpts from pretrial papers. He is to call his first witness,
ex-CIA analyst Sam Adams, later this week.
Westmoreland, commander of U.S. forces in Vietnam from 1964 to
196N, says he was defamed by a 1982 documentary that said he tried in
1967 to hide the true enemy strength from the public, Congress and pos
sibly President Johnson.
Ignoring the broadcast's charge that the public and Congress were
misled, attorney Dan Burt has focused the case on the question of
whether Westmoreland deceived Johnson, and others in the military.
"Eighteen men came from all over this country ... to testify that they
believed that Gen. Westmoreland did not deceive his superiors," Burt
told jurors during an "interim summation."
The 3-month-old trial has included testimony by Robert McNamara.
Johnson's defense secretary, who had never publicly discussed Vietnam
since leaving office; Walt Rostow, l.BJ's national security adviser; Paul
Nitze, then an assistant defense secretary and now the nation's chief
arms control negotiator, and Westmoreland himself.
GM announces new 'Saturn' line
WARREN, Mich. — General Motors Corp. announced yesterday it
will form a new subsidiary, the Saturn Corp.. to develop and market a
new line of small cars in the United States.
GM said Saturn will become its sixth automotive nameplate. The
others are Chevrolet. Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Buick and Cadillac.
More than a year ago, GM announced the formation of Project
Saturn, in which the company planned to revolutionize the way it makes
cars by using high technology.
GM Chairman Roger Smith has said that concepts developed in Proj
ect Saturn eventually would be used throughout the corporation.
Smith said GM would commit $5 billion to the project, with an initial
expenditure of $ 150 million.
The Saturn cars will be sold through separate franchises.
GM said that two major recent developments would aid in supporting
the Saturn Project — GM's acquisition last year of the giant computer
company Electronic Data Systems Corp.. and a joint car-making venture
in California with Toyota Motor Corp. of Japan.
The first Saturn cars will be a four-door sedan and a two-door coupe,
and will be in the subcompact category, GM said.
Gas leak causes evacuation in S.F.
SAN FRANCISCO — A natural gas leak yesterday in the city's Fi
nancial District forced the evacuation of several buildings, including
Pacific Gas and Electric's headquarters, while firefighters searched for
the source.
The San Francisco Fire Department still was trying to pinpoint the
origin of the leak, which sent a strong odor of gas wafting through the
area at about 2:30 p.m.
"We don't know the source. We're still investigating," PG&E spokes
man Larry Baack said.
Hundreds of utility employees were evacuated about 3:15 p.m., along
with workers in some neighboring buildings. Utility employees were sent
home about 15 minutes later.
U.S. priest kidnaped in Beirut
BEIRUT, Lebanon — An American Roman Catholic priest was
kidnaped by gunmen yesterday as he was being driven to work on a
crowded street in predominantly Moslem West Beirut.
Police officers identified him as the Rev. Lawrence Jenco, 50, of
Chicago. He is program director in Lebanon for Catholic Relief
Services, a charity of the U.S. Catholic Conference of Bishops.
No group came forth immediately to take responsibility for the kid
naping, which occurred only a day after the charge d'affaires at the Swiss
Embassy here. Eric Wehrli. was released after being abducted and held
for five days.
Over the past year, four other Americans have disappeared in West
Beirut in suspected kidnapings. Telephone callers saying they
represented a group known as Islamic Jihad (Islamic Holy War) have
claimed responsibility for three of these incidents, as well as for the
suicide bombing attacks on the U.S. Embassy and Marine barracks here.
According to the police and witnesses, Jenco's car was boxed in by two
others and the priest and his driver were seized. The incident, at 7:30
a.m., occurred on a side street in the Manara district, near the American
University and only 20 yards from the district police station.
Police Lt. Fadi Salman said the gunmen forced Jenco and his driver
into the back seat of a car, then sped off firing their weapons into the air
to clear traffic.
Jenco's driver said they were driven to the Corniche, the seafront
boulevard, where he was forced to climb into the trunk of Jenco's car
and was hit on the head with a pistol. The kidnapers then abandoned the
car, and the driver managed to escape and make his way to a police sta
tion.
Msgr. John Esseff. an American working for the Pontifical Mission in
Beirut and a close friend of the missing priest, said Jenco had arrived in
Lebanon in late September after tours with Catholic Relief Services in
North Yemen and Thailand.
Vietnamese overrun resistance base
BAN SANGAE, Thailand — Vietnamese troops yesterday overran
the key Ampil base of Cambodia's main anticommunist resistance group
after more than 24 hours of shelling and ground fighting that forced the
camp's guerrilla defenders to flee across the Thai border.
A number of Vietnamese artillery rounds landed on Thai territory,
and Thai gunners fired back across the border. About 60 miles north in
Thailand's Buriram province, a Thai Air Force A-37 light-strike aircraft
was shot down yesterday morning while supporting ground troops in an
area where a Thai patrol clashed this weekend with Vietnamese in
truders. Thai authorities said.
After having been driven from their Ampil camp, hundreds of guerril
las of the Khmer People's National Liberation Front were regrouping
along the border near here today for what their leaders said would be a
series of counterattacks aimed at recapturing their most important base,
site of the front's military headquarters. But it was apparent that the
Vietnamese onslaught, which went more quickly and met less resistance
than expected, had already dealt the front a severe military and political
blow.
Sporadic fighting continued in the camp yesterday amid what ap
peared to be a systematic Vietnamese effort to destroy its main installa
tions. But by nightfall, the remaining guerrilla defenders had withdrawn.
Thai military sources said.
As Vietnamese artillery and mortar rounds crashed near the main
western entrance to the Ampil camp a few hundred yards from a Thai
antitank ditch, tank and automatic weapons fire could be heard inside
the sprawling settlement that formerly housed about 23,000 Cambodian
civilians and more than 5,000 Khmer front guerrillas.
Stocks finish mixed
NEW YORK — The stock market turned in a mixed performance
yesterday as traders were hit with a surprise switch in the Reagan admin
istration lineup, a swap of jobs by the treasury secretary and White
House chief of staff.
■ Wall Street was a little confused by it all." said William LeFevre. an
analyst at Purcell, Graham & Co.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 5.63 points Monday,
gained another 1.11 points to close at 1,191.70. Earlier in the session,
the blue-chip average had been up as much as 4.64 points.

Gas leak causes evacuation in S.F.
SAN FRANCISCO — A natural gas leak yesterday in the city's Fi
nancial District forced the evacuation of several buildings, including
Pacific Gas and Electric's headquarters, while firefighters searched for
the source.
The San Francisco Fire Department still was trying to pinpoint the
origin of the leak, which sent a strong odor of gas wafting through the
area at about 2:30 p.m.
"We don't know the source. We're still investigating," PG&E spokes
man Larry Baack said.
Hundreds of utility employees were evacuated about 3:15 p.m., along
with workers in some neighboring buildings. Utility employees were sent
home about 15 minutes later.
U.S. priest kidnaped in Beirut
BEIRUT, Lebanon — An American Roman Catholic priest was
kidnaped by gunmen yesterday as he was being driven to work on a
crowded street in predominantly Moslem West Beirut.
Police officers identified him as the Rev. Lawrence Jenco, 50, of
Chicago. He is program director in Lebanon for Catholic Relief
Services, a charity of the U.S. Catholic Conference of Bishops.
No group came forth immediately to take responsibility for the kid
naping, which occurred only a day after the charge d'affaires at the Swiss
Embassy here. Eric Wehrli. was released after being abducted and held
for five days.
Over the past year, four other Americans have disappeared in West
Beirut in suspected kidnapings. Telephone callers saying they
represented a group known as Islamic Jihad (Islamic Holy War) have
claimed responsibility for three of these incidents, as well as for the
suicide bombing attacks on the U.S. Embassy and Marine barracks here.
According to the police and witnesses, Jenco's car was boxed in by two
others and the priest and his driver were seized. The incident, at 7:30
a.m., occurred on a side street in the Manara district, near the American
University and only 20 yards from the district police station.
Police Lt. Fadi Salman said the gunmen forced Jenco and his driver
into the back seat of a car, then sped off firing their weapons into the air
to clear traffic.
Jenco's driver said they were driven to the Corniche, the seafront
boulevard, where he was forced to climb into the trunk of Jenco's car
and was hit on the head with a pistol. The kidnapers then abandoned the
car, and the driver managed to escape and make his way to a police sta
tion.
Msgr. John Esseff. an American working for the Pontifical Mission in
Beirut and a close friend of the missing priest, said Jenco had arrived in
Lebanon in late September after tours with Catholic Relief Services in
North Yemen and Thailand.
Vietnamese overrun resistance base
BAN SANGAE, Thailand — Vietnamese troops yesterday overran
the key Ampil base of Cambodia's main anticommunist resistance group
after more than 24 hours of shelling and ground fighting that forced the
camp's guerrilla defenders to flee across the Thai border.
A number of Vietnamese artillery rounds landed on Thai territory,
and Thai gunners fired back across the border. About 60 miles north in
Thailand's Buriram province, a Thai Air Force A-37 light-strike aircraft
was shot down yesterday morning while supporting ground troops in an
area where a Thai patrol clashed this weekend with Vietnamese in
truders. Thai authorities said.
After having been driven from their Ampil camp, hundreds of guerril
las of the Khmer People's National Liberation Front were regrouping
along the border near here today for what their leaders said would be a
series of counterattacks aimed at recapturing their most important base,
site of the front's military headquarters. But it was apparent that the
Vietnamese onslaught, which went more quickly and met less resistance
than expected, had already dealt the front a severe military and political
blow.
Sporadic fighting continued in the camp yesterday amid what ap
peared to be a systematic Vietnamese effort to destroy its main installa
tions. But by nightfall, the remaining guerrilla defenders had withdrawn.
Thai military sources said.
As Vietnamese artillery and mortar rounds crashed near the main
western entrance to the Ampil camp a few hundred yards from a Thai
antitank ditch, tank and automatic weapons fire could be heard inside
the sprawling settlement that formerly housed about 23,000 Cambodian
civilians and more than 5,000 Khmer front guerrillas.

Westmoreland lawyer rests case
NEW YORK — The lawyer for retired Gen. William Westmoreland
rested his $120 million libel ease against CBS yesterday, stressing the
support the general has received from some of nation's former top offi
cials.
After U.S. District Judge Pierre Leval cautioned the jurors to "keep
an open mind," the network's lawyer, David Boies, opened the defense
by submitting excerpts from pretrial papers. He is to call his first witness,
ex-CIA analyst Sam Adams, later this week.
Westmoreland, commander of U.S. forces in Vietnam from 1964 to
196N, says he was defamed by a 1982 documentary that said he tried in
1967 to hide the true enemy strength from the public, Congress and pos
sibly President Johnson.
Ignoring the broadcast's charge that the public and Congress were
misled, attorney Dan Burt has focused the case on the question of
whether Westmoreland deceived Johnson, and others in the military.
"Eighteen men came from all over this country ... to testify that they
believed that Gen. Westmoreland did not deceive his superiors," Burt
told jurors during an "interim summation."
The 3-month-old trial has included testimony by Robert McNamara.
Johnson's defense secretary, who had never publicly discussed Vietnam
since leaving office; Walt Rostow, l.BJ's national security adviser; Paul
Nitze, then an assistant defense secretary and now the nation's chief
arms control negotiator, and Westmoreland himself.
GM announces new 'Saturn' line
WARREN, Mich. — General Motors Corp. announced yesterday it
will form a new subsidiary, the Saturn Corp.. to develop and market a
new line of small cars in the United States.
GM said Saturn will become its sixth automotive nameplate. The
others are Chevrolet. Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Buick and Cadillac.
More than a year ago, GM announced the formation of Project
Saturn, in which the company planned to revolutionize the way it makes
cars by using high technology.
GM Chairman Roger Smith has said that concepts developed in Proj
ect Saturn eventually would be used throughout the corporation.
Smith said GM would commit $5 billion to the project, with an initial
expenditure of $ 150 million.
The Saturn cars will be sold through separate franchises.
GM said that two major recent developments would aid in supporting
the Saturn Project — GM's acquisition last year of the giant computer
company Electronic Data Systems Corp.. and a joint car-making venture
in California with Toyota Motor Corp. of Japan.
The first Saturn cars will be a four-door sedan and a two-door coupe,
