## Superpowers plan new talks 
### 
GENEVA. Switzerland — The
United States and the Soviet Union
agreed yesterday to begin new
negotiations aimed at "preventing an
arms race in space and terminating it
on Earth."
Secretary of State George Shultz
told a news conference after two days
of talks with Soviet Foreign Minister
Andrei Gromyko that the date and
place of the negotiations will be
decided through diplomatic channels
within one month.
A joint statement issued late yes
terday before Shultz and a Soviet
Foreign Ministry spokesman held
separate news conferences said. "The
sides be'ieve that ultimately the
forthcoming negotiations . . . should
lead to the complete elimination of
nuclear arms everywhere."
It also said both sides "agree that
the subject of the negotiations will be

a complex of questions concerning
space and nuclear arms, both strate
gic and intermediate range, with all
the questions considered and re
solved in their interrelationship."
It said the "objective of the
negotiations will be to work out effec
tive agreements aimed at preventing
an arms race in space and terminating
it on Earth, at limiting and reducing
nuclear arms, and at strengthening
strategic stability."
In Moscow, the official Soviet news
agency l ass carried a dispatch on the
Shultz-Gromyko statement in its
English-language service at the
agreed upon release time, which was
1 I p.m. yesterday in Geneva and 2
p.m. PST.
lass did not carry an accompany
ing statement or comments on the So
viet view.
The U.S.-Soviet statement said the
bilateral negotiations "will be con

ducted by a delegation from each side
divided into three groups."
Shultz told his news conference one
group would "address space arms,
whether based or targeted on Earth
or in space while the two other
groups would deal with "limitations
and reductions in strategic and
intermediate-range nuclear arms.
Previously, the United Stated and
the Soviet union held two separate
negotiations 011 medium-range and
strategic, or long-range, missiles, but
the Soviets walked out of those talks
in Geneva in late 1983.
Shultz told the news conference in
a huge salon of the Intercontinental
Hotel, "Whether we will get
anywhere in the negotiations . . .
remains to be seen. We will bring a
positive and constructive spirit to
the talks.
Vladimir Lomeiko, a Soviet

Foreign Ministry spokesman, also
foresaw a difficult task ahead. He told
a later news conference, "This agree
ment is just a beginning. The negotia
tions themselves — the important
part — lie ahead of us."
The Soviets have strongly criticized
President Reagan's proposed "Star
Wars" program, and Kenneth Adel
man. director of the U.S. Arms Con
trol and Disarmament Agency, said
Groniyko was "real still in his con
tention that the anti-missile program
would have an offensive capability.
-We agreed to disagree," Adelman
said.
Shultz and Gromyko met for nearly
eight hours yesterday in an effort to
resume superpower negotiations on
arms reductions after a lapse of 13
months.
