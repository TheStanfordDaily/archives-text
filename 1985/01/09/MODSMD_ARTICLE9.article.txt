# Regan and Baker to swap jobs
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — President Reagan, in an un
expectedly sudden shift among senior members of
his administration, announced yesterday that
James Baker HI, White House chief of staff, and
Secretary of the Treasury Donald Regan will ex
change jobs.
Reagan did not even know of the plan for the ex
traordinary exchange — worked out in tight
secrecy last week by Baker, Regan and deputy
chief of staff Michael Deaver — until it was pre
sented to him Monday for his approval Barely 24
hours later, the president, flanked by Baker and
Regan, announced it at a hastily arranged White
House news briefing.
The move, although generally greeted favorably
both inside and outside the administration, stunned
most observers because Baker and Regan had indi
cated that they would remain in their current posts
for some time.
"It's a shocker." one White House official said.
"But it makes all kind of sense. Both wanted new
jobs, and Regan gets to retain his Cabinet-level
status. Baker gets a Cabinet job and one that will
give him a little less of the day-to-day grind."
Moreover, the business community will support
the shift, Richard Lesher, president of the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce, predicted. "Although the
announcement came as a complete surprise, the

two individuals involved arc seasoned and ex
tremely capable," Lesher said.
Baker's departure, which is dependent upon his
confirmation by the Senate as secretary ot the
Treasury, will represent a clean sweep ot the troika
that shaped White House policy and strategy lor
Reagan during his first term. Last week, Deaver
announced that he would take a job in the private
sector in March, and White House counselor Ed
win Meese 111 is scheduled to leave after his ex
pected confirmation by the Senate as attorney gen
eral.
Reagan, declaring that he was confident that the
Baker-Regan swap could be accomplished
smoothly, said the move would "contribute sub
stantially" to the success of his second term. Both
men. he said, had compiled "outstanding records of
achievement."
"Each has indicated to me that while willing to
serve in whatever capacity I would wish, each
would welcome an oportunity to assume new re
sponsibilities and new challenges," he said. "Alter
four grueling years in their current positions, their
desire for change is completely understandable.
Baker had made no secret of his desire to be
named secretary of the Treasury or another top
Cabinet officer. But as recently as Monday, he had
indicated to reporters that he probably would

remain indefinitely as chief of staff.
The idea for the swap was initiated by Regan,
who said he first read in newspapers that Baker was
interested in several Cabinet posts. Treasury
among them. Regan then told Baker he would be
interested in being named chief of staff — but only
if Deaver had no interest in the job. After Deaver
said he had none, the plan was presented to the
president.
As secretary of the Treasury, Baker, a wealthy
54-year-old Houston lawyer, will become the ad
ministration's chief economic spokesman, while
Regan, a 66-year-old former Wall Street broker,
will keep his status as a Cabinet member in his new
White House post. Both men will still be desig
nated members of the top-secret National Security
Council.
The exchange is expected to touch off further
shake-ups in the administration, with both Baker
and Regan bringing in some of their own personnel
choices to their new offices. Indeed, a senior White
House official suggested that a general houseclean
ing may be in order in both the White House and
Department of the Treasury.
"There are duds in Treasury and in the White
House, and this is a golden opportunity to clean
house in both places," the official said.
