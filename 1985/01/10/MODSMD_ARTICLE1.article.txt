# Budget cuts may harm student aid

### FRANK LESTER Staff writer 
Proposals currently under consideration by the Reagan
administration to cut federal student financial aid pro
grams would have a disastrous impact on undergradu
ates here, according to Financial Aids Director Robert
Huff.
Huff listed three plans for fund limitations rumored to
be under consideration by the federal government. He
said the following proposals, if implemented by Congress,
would put pressure on the University" and have a consi
derable impact on the University's commitment to meet
undergraduate students demonstrated financial needs:
• Plan 1 would put a ceiling on the allowable family
incomes of students borrowing from the government un
der the Guaranteed Student Loan (GSL) program. This
means that students whose parents make $30,000 and
more a year would be ineligible to apply for GSL. loans.
• Plan 2 would put a "cap" on the amount of federal aid a
student can receive, limiting the amount to $4,000 a year
instead of the current $7,000 a year.
• Plan 3 would freeze the four campus-based federal fin
ancial aid programs (National Direct Student Loans, Pell
Grants, Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants,
and work-study programs) at current levels so as not to
permit funding increases.
Huff emphasized there is no certainty at this point
about the aggressiveness with which the Reagan adminis
tration will pursue cutting student aid programs. The an
nual education message, with details of the proposals, will
he delivered by President Reagan to Congress shortly
after the Jan. 29 State of the Union address.
If the past is any indicator, the administration will use
several of many means at its disposal to get Congress to
agree to spending cuts in student financial aid. Huff said.
He said it could go as far as rescinding the appropriations
act passed before the adjournment of last year's Congress
that allowed for "some fairly generous increases" in fund
ing for aid programsover the 1985-86 school year. The
effect of this would be to leave the money already ap
propriated unspent.
In the past, "Congress has generally not been disposed
to go along with the administration's proposals for reduc
tions in student aid." Huff said. He indicated that the sit
uation could change this year if Congress is in an itchy
mood to grapple with the federal deficit problem and if
the administration pushes to cut social programs such us
federal student aid.
If that happens, the University would be forced into the
position of searching for alternative funding sources to
make up lor the gap created by the spending cuts. Huff
said. The effect this would have on loan programs, for ex
ample. would be drastic.
"Obviously, the most favorably-funded programs are
the federal student programs," Huff said. "The student
pays no interest, and the government ensures that the
funds are available by paying the lenders a special allow
ance which makes up the difference between the interest
on the loan and what it costs to get money.
"If those loan funds are all of a sudden not available to
a large number of students, the University has to find an
alternative credit source. That's going to be expensive,
and probably the cost is going to have to be passed on to
the student." Huff said.
The passing of the buck would mean that about two
thirds of students now receiving GSL loans would be cut
off from that funding source.
Huff said the federal government provides more money
now for loans than for any other component of a student's
financial aid package. Of the $N million spent by the Uni
versity for loan funding annually. $6.5 million comes from
the government.
The vulnerability of student aid programs can he attrib
uted to the mood of the administration toward social pro
grams in general, but it is also due to a lack of unity on the
part of higher educational institutions, according to Huff.
