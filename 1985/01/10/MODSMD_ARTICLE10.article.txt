# Professor calls for bacteria embargo
## 
### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER Senior staff writer 
A Stanford microbiology pro
fessor claims the Soviet Union's
decision to stop geneticist David
Goldfarb from emigrating for se
curity reasons is simply "an excuse
to prohibit someone from leaving
the country."
In response to the Soviet action,
Charles Yanofsky is asking that
the United States sends no biolog
ical materials to the Soviet Union
until Goldfarb is released.
In April, Goldfarb's bacteria ex
periments were taken by the KGB
and his visa was revoked just
before he was ready to emigrate
for New York.
Yanofsky said Goldfarb wants
to leave the Soviet Union, but he
is not certain that Goldfarb specif
ically wants to come to the United
States.
However, the Soviet scientist
may have some interest in coming
to this country because his son,
Alexander, is a researcher at Co
lumbia University.
Goldfarb is "not really inter
ested in taking the (bacteria)
cultures with him," according to
Yanofsky, who has been in contact
with the Soviet scientist by mail.
"I have no idea what his
(Goldfarb) wishes are," Yanofsky
said.
He said the materials Goldfarb
is working with are "perfectly
harmless cultures."

The Stanford scientist said the
cultures are commonly exchanged
between countries.
Yanofsky is joined by three
other members of the Committee
of Concerned Scientists in calling
for the moratorium on shipments
of biological samples from the
United States.

Alexander Goldfarb said the
moritorium could hinder the work
of Soviet scientists so severely that
the Soviet government might be
forced to allow the elder Goldfarb
to leave, acccording to the Univer
sity News Service.
Yanofsky said Britain has pro
posed a similar moratorium.
Laboratories in the United
States, Britain and other Western
countries reportedly hold a com
fortable lead in the field of
microbiology.
