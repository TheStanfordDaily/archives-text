## The 						Stanford Daily A 						destabilizing change 
### 
Now that nearly everyone from Geneva to
Hollywood is is supposed to he a mini-expert on
arms control, it's getting harder and harder to
add anything new and different to the debate
over what to do with nuclear weapons.
And sometimes that can be a good thing, be
cause a lot of the ideas we've worked out over the
past 40 years make sense. Of course there's room
for improvement, hut not at the cost of interna
tional agreements that serve us well.
It's no secret that one of our best accords, the
1M72 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty between the
United States and the Soviet Union, has stood
the test of time because it reflects an underlying
reality: that protection against a nuclear ex
change is impossible because a nuclear exchange
would be suicidal.
For two decades the superpowers mostly kept
their word, because building a defense against in
coming nuclear missiles with existing technology
couldn't provide total protection. Worse, it might
encourage each country to contemplate a first
strike from a "safe haven" guarded by an ABM
system.
So it's not surprising that when Ronald Reagan
took office in 1981 he opted, rhetoric aside, to
tacitly accept most of the ABM Treaty. Because
even when the "window of vulnerability" yawned

at its very widest, the strategic stand-off still
made dubious any real thought of defending
against an ICBM sortie.
But the president's 1983 Strategic Defense Ini
tiative — the "Star Wars" plan — promised to
change that. To its champions in the administra
tion, Star Wars offered the hope of developing an
impenetrable shield to protect all the people in
this country from a missile attack, "to render nu
clear weapons impotent and obsolete."
If successfully deployed, the defense envi
sioned by the president might be preferable to
the current balance of terror.
But a couple weeks ago Reagan's top scientific
advisors acknowledged that the United States
lacks the technology to build an impenetrable
shield, and is not likely to have that technology in
the forseeable future. We are now told that under
a revised Star Wars plan, the American public
would not be protected from enemy missiles. The
best we could hope for is a limited defense
around our own ICBM silos.
We don't need a limited missile defense, for
most of the reasons we chose not to develop one
over a decade ago. The facts are in, and we've
gone full circle. It doesn't take an expert to un
derstand that.
