## Education: a problem of framework 
### 
In the past few years, we have often heard
that our schools are failing. SAT scores are
plummeting. Johnny can't read or write or do
arithmetic and American high school students
can't locate the United States on a map as
well as the students can in Upper Volta. The
government even recognizes that our schools
are not doing the job of educating our
children.
Some states and school districts have begun
to address the problem. Some require that
students pass a competency test to graduate
from high school. Many states are in a back
to-basics program where they stress reading,
writing and arithmetic. Other states are re
quiring students to stay in school longer hours
and more days; what they can't provide in
quality they substitute in quantity.
These steps, though admirable, treat the
symptoms only, not the disease. The disease is
much bigger, and much more difficult to treat,
foi it lies at the root of nearly all of the prob
lems that face this country. The disease is this:

The world around us is changing and. for
the last century, has been changing drasti
cally. The primary institutions of human life,
the family, the church, the government and,
to a certain extent, the school, were formed in
a much different time. They were formed
before the Industrial Revoiution, before
World War I, before the great technical revo
lution of this century, before television, radio
and indoor plumbing, before Darwin, Edison,
Freud, Marx and Lenin, people who have
radically changed this world.
New knowledge of'the world gained
through science has challenged our basic
belief structures, our institutions, because
they cannot explain the new world revealed to
us by science. We therefore lose faith in the
old institutions and question all of the values
codified in the old institutions, not just the
values called to question by science.' Without
this foundation of values and the institutions
that have codified the values, we have no
foundation for action. Each action) alone is no

a new system of beliefs that can explain the
new knowledge gained through science and
the old knowledge codified in our institutions.
We can then codify these new beliefs in new
institutions. »
For example, consider evolution. Darwin

beings evolved trpm chemicals and lower
animals. The Bible and the church tell us
that God created Adam and Eve in the Gar
den of Eden. Who's correct? Can they both
be correct? If the Bible is not exactly right on
this subject, who is to say that the Bible and
the church are not exactly correct on many
other subjects? Why should we trust the other

teachings of the Bible and the church if we do
not trust their teachings on creation?
Our decaying institutions and our failing
values have a profound effect on education.
The old system of values showed everybody
why it was important to go to school. It pro
vided people with motivation to learn. Now.
without that fondation in our system, it is very
difficult to learn because learning requires a
framework in which to place the new knowl
edge. Without a framework that provides
meaning, facts are meaningless, and thus
nearly impossible to remember. For example,
consider the problem of memorizing the order
of 12 random digits which can all come from a
collection of 26 digits. It is a formidable prob
lem, as there are a billion possible combina
tions. Next, consider learning the word
"civilization," which is a non-random selec
tion of 1 2 random digits from a collection of
26 digits. It is much easier now, because the
digits, or letters, together have a meaning.
In a similar manner, it is difficult for stu
dents to learn unless they have a framework
in which to place the facts they are supposed
to learn. Parents cannot force their children to

learn; the students at some point in their edu
cation must find their own motivation to
learn. For example, if a junior high school stu
dent does not understand the importance of
the history of this country and its monumental
achievements in establishing an entirely new
kind of government, she will find it quite"diffi
cult to memorize the names of the first 10
presidents. However, if this student wants to
be an actress, she will have no problem
memorizing 10 pages of dialogue for her
drama class.
Unfortunately, the framework of values
that provides the source for motivation is
deteriorating; our institutions are crumbling
around us. Accordingly, students' SAT scores
fall and students have difficulty reading and
writing and doing arithmetic and locating the
United States on a map. Until we can con
struct a new system of values that can ade
quately explain the changing world, until that
renaissance, our schools will continue to tail
to educate the children of this country.
