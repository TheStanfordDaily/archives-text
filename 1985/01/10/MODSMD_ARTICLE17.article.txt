## Washington is no longer clear favorite Pac-10 hoops will be parity without power 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
Ust November, when the Pacific
I" Conference basketball coaches
gathered around a long table at San
Francisco's Airport Executive Inn to
discuss the outlook for the 19N4-85
season with the media, it all seemed
so simple. The University of Wash
ington was the hands-down favorite to
win the conference, and about two or
three teams would battle it out for
second.
No more.

Fwo months and god knows how
many upsets later, a case could be
made for any of seven or so teams to
win the Pac-lO title. The Pac-lO cer
tainly is not the nation's best basket
ball conference. Just the one with the
most parity. And the most confusion.
Washington was cruising along
with its top-l() national ranking until
it fell to Brigham Young Dec. 22. A
week later, the Huskies fell to Atlan
tic Coast Conference power Georgia
Tech. And after last Saturday's loss to
Oregon State University — the

Huskies' first home conference defeat
in nearly two years — they are on the
verge of falling out the top 20.
To make a bad situation worse,
starting guard Gary Gardner was
declared academically ineligible this
week. So much for an outright con
ference favorite.
Now Washington joins a group of
about seven teams that have
legitimate title aspirations. Washing
ton and Oregon State were co
champions last season with 15-3
records and a repeat of 1 5-3 should

easily be good enough to win again.
But in all likelihood, the champ will
have as many as four, five or even six
conference losses. Never before in
the Pac-10 or the old Pac-8 (before
the Arizona schools joined in 1979)
has a team won the title with more
than three defeats.
I do know that the trend that is
taking over college basketball around
the nation will continue in the Pac
-10. said Oregon State Coach Ralph
Miller, who is in his 15th year there.
"And that is that you won't see one
or even two or three teams dominat
ing."
Besides parity, the Pac-10 has
something else working in its favor —
youth. Five of last season's All-Pac
-10 team returnees, including Player
of the Year A.C. Green, and each
team has an average of fewer than
three seniors on its roster.
Though the Pac-10 may have the
best young talent in the country,
there is no "may have" when talking
about coaching. The Pac-10 has the
best basketball coaches in the nation.
No doubt about it.
Washington Coach Marv
Harshman. who plans to retire at the
end of the season, is the winningest
active Division 1 coach, and Miller is
the second winningest active coach.
Over the past few seasons, the Pac-10
has brought in the top coaches from
around the country to complement
Harshman and Miller, the Pac-10's
elder statesmen.
Nonetheless, it's been said that a
coach is only as good as his players,
and if that notion holds true, the
teams with more experience will have
the upper hand. Everyone has talent,
but it's young talent. Experience is
something a coach can't recruit.
Freshmen don't have it. they get it.
The place where experience will
play the biggest part will be on the
road. Pac-10 teams were 42-4 at
home and 10-16 on the road in their
pre-conference games this season. So
whoever has the best road record will
probably also be the conference
champion. But put a special emphasis
on probably, because probably so far
has meant probably not.
Below is a team-by-team run down
of the Pac-10 in predicted order of
finish.
WASHINGTON (9-3, 1-1)
Last Year: 24-7, 15-3, tied Ist
The Huskies are more than a
game off the pace and the loss of
Gardner for the season made an
already weak guard position weaker.
But they'll be back.
The Huskies have a sentimental
reason to repeat as Pac-10 champs
with Harshman retiring at the end of
the season. They also have perhaps
the biggest and most potent front line
in college basketball with 7-foot cen
ter Christian Welp and 6-9 forwards

Oregon State's A.C. Green was the Pac-10 Player of the Year last season and has already led the Beavers to a
victory over Washington, the Huskies' first home loss in over two years.
