## Washington is no longer clear favorite Pac-10 hoops will be parity without power 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
Ust November, when the Pacific
I" Conference basketball coaches
gathered around a long table at San
Francisco's Airport Executive Inn to
discuss the outlook for the 19N4-85
season with the media, it all seemed
so simple. The University of Wash
ington was the hands-down favorite to
win the conference, and about two or
three teams would battle it out for
second.
No more.

Fwo months and god knows how
many upsets later, a case could be
made for any of seven or so teams to
win the Pac-lO title. The Pac-lO cer
tainly is not the nation's best basket
ball conference. Just the one with the
most parity. And the most confusion.
Washington was cruising along
with its top-l() national ranking until
it fell to Brigham Young Dec. 22. A
week later, the Huskies fell to Atlan
tic Coast Conference power Georgia
Tech. And after last Saturday's loss to
Oregon State University — the

Huskies' first home conference defeat
in nearly two years — they are on the
verge of falling out the top 20.
To make a bad situation worse,
starting guard Gary Gardner was
declared academically ineligible this
week. So much for an outright con
ference favorite.
Now Washington joins a group of
about seven teams that have
legitimate title aspirations. Washing
ton and Oregon State were co
champions last season with 15-3
records and a repeat of 1 5-3 should

easily be good enough to win again.
But in all likelihood, the champ will
have as many as four, five or even six
conference losses. Never before in
the Pac-10 or the old Pac-8 (before
the Arizona schools joined in 1979)
has a team won the title with more
than three defeats.
I do know that the trend that is
taking over college basketball around
the nation will continue in the Pac
-10. said Oregon State Coach Ralph
Miller, who is in his 15th year there.
"And that is that you won't see one
or even two or three teams dominat
ing."
Besides parity, the Pac-10 has
something else working in its favor —
youth. Five of last season's All-Pac
-10 team returnees, including Player
of the Year A.C. Green, and each
team has an average of fewer than
three seniors on its roster.
Though the Pac-10 may have the
best young talent in the country,
there is no "may have" when talking
about coaching. The Pac-10 has the
best basketball coaches in the nation.
No doubt about it.
Washington Coach Marv
Harshman. who plans to retire at the
end of the season, is the winningest
active Division 1 coach, and Miller is
the second winningest active coach.
Over the past few seasons, the Pac-10
has brought in the top coaches from
around the country to complement
Harshman and Miller, the Pac-10's
elder statesmen.
Nonetheless, it's been said that a
coach is only as good as his players,
and if that notion holds true, the
teams with more experience will have
the upper hand. Everyone has talent,
but it's young talent. Experience is
something a coach can't recruit.
Freshmen don't have it. they get it.
The place where experience will
play the biggest part will be on the
road. Pac-10 teams were 42-4 at
home and 10-16 on the road in their
pre-conference games this season. So
whoever has the best road record will
probably also be the conference
champion. But put a special emphasis
on probably, because probably so far
has meant probably not.
Below is a team-by-team run down
of the Pac-10 in predicted order of
finish.
WASHINGTON (9-3, 1-1)
Last Year: 24-7, 15-3, tied Ist
The Huskies are more than a
game off the pace and the loss of
Gardner for the season made an
already weak guard position weaker.
But they'll be back.
The Huskies have a sentimental
reason to repeat as Pac-10 champs
with Harshman retiring at the end of
the season. They also have perhaps
the biggest and most potent front line
in college basketball with 7-foot cen
ter Christian Welp and 6-9 forwards

victory over Washington, the Huskies' first home loss in over two years.

Washington has the most experi
ence in the league and will have to
use it. Five of its final seven confer
ence games are on the road. But the
next few weeks will he the biggest test
for the Huskies. They are steadily
slipping and need to establish them
selves as the all-dominating team
they were last season and can be this
season.
OREGON STATE (12-1, 3-0)
Last Year: 22-7, 15-3, tied Ist
Ralph Miller's teams are always
well-coached. They play defense,
throw proper two-handed passes and
never take bad shots. They also win.
Always.
Critics said Oregon State would be
hurting up front this season after
three-time All-Pac-10 performer
Charlie Sitton graduated and 6-7
Rick Berry transfered to San Jose
State, where his father coaches. But
they forgot that Player of the Year
Green is back, along with center
Steve Woodside, and guards Darryl
Flowers and Darrin Houston. They
also forgot that Miller is coaching.
Still, the Beavers' tradition as a pe
rennial basketball power might catch
up with them this season. Now that
beating once-great UCLA is old hat,
everyone is gearing up to beat the
Beavers. And, unfortunately for Mil
ler and company, most teams in the
Pac-10 have enough talent to do it.

Second-year Coach Lute Olson is
hesitant to admit that the Wildcats
have completely turned the corner
after a disastrous 4-24 campaign in
1982-83.
Olson disregarded Playboy maga

Arizona 18th."I think they (Playboy)
have been spending too much time
chasing Miss America candidates,"
he joked. "At least it gave me an
excuse to buy Playboy and bring it
home. 1 told my wife I was looking at
the basketball predictions, but 1 had
trouble finding the right page."
Arizona does field the Pac-10's
shortest team, though it's a deceiving
short team. On it is the Pac-10's
leading rebounder last season, 6-7
Pete Williams. And what the
Wildcats lack in height they make up

will try to run with them are stupid

Things in Eugene haven't quite

Three starters, including All-Pac

back from last season's 16-13 team
that finished third in the Pac-10 and
earned a berth in the National Invita
tional Tournament. The only prob
lem is that the Ducks have been
losing. Last weekend's losses to USC
at home and UCLA on the road
dropped their overall record under
the .500 mark.
But after Washington. Oregon has
the most experience in the starting
lineup and McArthur Court is the
toughest place to play in the Pac-10,

one of the teams to beat, though
probably not until the second half of

Last Year: 17-11, 10-8, 4th
The Bruins have a new coach in

UCLA lost Coach Larry Farmer
last season along with 1983 Pac-10
Player of the Year Kenny Fields, All-
Pac-10 guard Ralph Jackson and 7-2

a shorter, younger, less talented
team. Hazzard also was welcomed
with an absolutely brutal pre
conference schedule, which included
the likes of DePaul. Memphis State.
St. John's. Brighani Young — all on
the road.
Hazzard said before the season
began. "I believe that by the time we
finish our preseason schedule, we will
have had a baptism of fire and gained
a lot of experience that w ill help our
younger players to prepare for the
conference race."

rison wasted no time stating the
Trojans' intentions this season.
"USC has some goals this season,
the first of which is to win some
respect back." he said. "We had an
awful season last year. And when you
live in the fishbowi of Southern Cali
fornia athletics, people aren't inter
ested in excuses, and I'm not inter
ested in giving any."
The Trojans may have turned
things around a bit. They are still one
of the youngest teams in the league
with only two seniors on the roster.
One of the those seniors is sharp
shooting AII-Pac-10 forward Wayne
Carlander. who Morrison says "will
play any one of four positions for us."

with an injury.
Despite all this, the Cougars are
10-2 overall and 2-0 in league play.
You figure it out.

The Bears were in fine shape until

Ust November, when the Pacific
I" Conference basketball coaches
gathered around a long table at San
Francisco's Airport Executive Inn to
discuss the outlook for the 19N4-85
season with the media, it all seemed
so simple. The University of Wash
ington was the hands-down favorite to
win the conference, and about two or
three teams would battle it out for
second.
No more.

Fwo months and god knows how
many upsets later, a case could be
made for any of seven or so teams to
win the Pac-lO title. The Pac-lO cer
tainly is not the nation's best basket
ball conference. Just the one with the
most parity. And the most confusion.
Washington was cruising along
with its top-l() national ranking until
it fell to Brigham Young Dec. 22. A
week later, the Huskies fell to Atlan
tic Coast Conference power Georgia
Tech. And after last Saturday's loss to
Oregon State University — the

Huskies' first home conference defeat
in nearly two years — they are on the
verge of falling out the top 20.
To make a bad situation worse,
starting guard Gary Gardner was
declared academically ineligible this
week. So much for an outright con
ference favorite.
Now Washington joins a group of
about seven teams that have
legitimate title aspirations. Washing
ton and Oregon State were co
champions last season with 15-3
records and a repeat of 1 5-3 should

easily be good enough to win again.
But in all likelihood, the champ will
have as many as four, five or even six
conference losses. Never before in
the Pac-10 or the old Pac-8 (before
the Arizona schools joined in 1979)
has a team won the title with more
than three defeats.
I do know that the trend that is
taking over college basketball around
the nation will continue in the Pac
-10. said Oregon State Coach Ralph
Miller, who is in his 15th year there.
"And that is that you won't see one
or even two or three teams dominat
ing."
Besides parity, the Pac-10 has
something else working in its favor —
youth. Five of last season's All-Pac
-10 team returnees, including Player
of the Year A.C. Green, and each
team has an average of fewer than
three seniors on its roster.
Though the Pac-10 may have the
best young talent in the country,
there is no "may have" when talking
about coaching. The Pac-10 has the
best basketball coaches in the nation.
No doubt about it.
Washington Coach Marv
Harshman. who plans to retire at the
end of the season, is the winningest
active Division 1 coach, and Miller is
the second winningest active coach.
Over the past few seasons, the Pac-10
has brought in the top coaches from
around the country to complement
Harshman and Miller, the Pac-10's
elder statesmen.
Nonetheless, it's been said that a
coach is only as good as his players,
and if that notion holds true, the
teams with more experience will have
the upper hand. Everyone has talent,
but it's young talent. Experience is
something a coach can't recruit.
Freshmen don't have it. they get it.
The place where experience will
play the biggest part will be on the
road. Pac-10 teams were 42-4 at
home and 10-16 on the road in their
pre-conference games this season. So
whoever has the best road record will
probably also be the conference
champion. But put a special emphasis
on probably, because probably so far

Ust November, when the Pacific
I" Conference basketball coaches
gathered around a long table at San
Francisco's Airport Executive Inn to
discuss the outlook for the 19N4-85
season with the media, it all seemed
so simple. The University of Wash
ington was the hands-down favorite to
win the conference, and about two or
three teams would battle it out for
second.
No more.

Fwo months and god knows how
many upsets later, a case could be
made for any of seven or so teams to
win the Pac-lO title. The Pac-lO cer
tainly is not the nation's best basket
ball conference. Just the one with the
most parity. And the most confusion.
Washington was cruising along
with its top-l() national ranking until
it fell to Brigham Young Dec. 22. A
week later, the Huskies fell to Atlan
tic Coast Conference power Georgia
Tech. And after last Saturday's loss to
Oregon State University — the

Huskies' first home conference defeat
in nearly two years — they are on the
verge of falling out the top 20.
To make a bad situation worse,
starting guard Gary Gardner was
declared academically ineligible this
week. So much for an outright con
ference favorite.
Now Washington joins a group of
about seven teams that have
legitimate title aspirations. Washing
ton and Oregon State were co
champions last season with 15-3
records and a repeat of 1 5-3 should

easily be good enough to win again.
But in all likelihood, the champ will
have as many as four, five or even six
conference losses. Never before in
the Pac-10 or the old Pac-8 (before
the Arizona schools joined in 1979)
has a team won the title with more
than three defeats.
I do know that the trend that is
taking over college basketball around
the nation will continue in the Pac
-10. said Oregon State Coach Ralph
Miller, who is in his 15th year there.
"And that is that you won't see one
or even two or three teams dominat
ing."
Besides parity, the Pac-10 has
something else working in its favor —
youth. Five of last season's All-Pac
-10 team returnees, including Player
of the Year A.C. Green, and each
team has an average of fewer than
three seniors on its roster.
Though the Pac-10 may have the
best young talent in the country,
there is no "may have" when talking
about coaching. The Pac-10 has the
best basketball coaches in the nation.
No doubt about it.
Washington Coach Marv
Harshman. who plans to retire at the
end of the season, is the winningest
active Division 1 coach, and Miller is
the second winningest active coach.
Over the past few seasons, the Pac-10
has brought in the top coaches from
around the country to complement
Harshman and Miller, the Pac-10's
elder statesmen.
Nonetheless, it's been said that a
coach is only as good as his players,
and if that notion holds true, the
teams with more experience will have
the upper hand. Everyone has talent,
but it's young talent. Experience is
something a coach can't recruit.
Freshmen don't have it. they get it.
The place where experience will
play the biggest part will be on the
road. Pac-10 teams were 42-4 at
home and 10-16 on the road in their
pre-conference games this season. So
whoever has the best road record will
probably also be the conference
champion. But put a special emphasis
on probably, because probably so far
has meant probably not.
Below is a team-by-team run down
of the Pac-10 in predicted order of
finish.
WASHINGTON (9-3, 1-1)
Last Year: 24-7, 15-3, tied Ist
The Huskies are more than a
game off the pace and the loss of
Gardner for the season made an
already weak guard position weaker.
But they'll be back.
The Huskies have a sentimental
reason to repeat as Pac-10 champs
with Harshman retiring at the end of
the season. They also have perhaps
the biggest and most potent front line
in college basketball with 7-foot cen
ter Christian Welp and 6-9 forwards
