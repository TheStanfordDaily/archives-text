# Card comes home to face Sun Devils
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
The best part about tonight's
basketball game against Arizona
State University for Stanford isn't
that it's against a team with a
losing record. Or even that it's
against the only Pacific 10 Confer
ence team Stanford beat twice last
season.
It's that tonight's game starting
at 7:30 is in Maples Pavilion,
where Stanford is 7-0 this season.
And after braving the wind. rain,
fog and three defeats in a four
game road trip, there's no place
like home for Coach Tom Davis
and his 8-4 Cardinal team.
"It's great to be sleeping in our
own beds, eating in our restau
rants and walking on our own
campus," point guard Keith
Ramee said."l love playing here."
The crowd at Maples Pavilion

tonight will he in love with Rumee
after he dishes out his first assist,
which will make him Stanford's
all-time assist leader with 282.
Ramee. only a junior, will break
an eight-year-old record held by
Mike Bratz. who presently plays
for the National Basketball Asso
ciation's Golden State Warriors.
"My goal has been to get it (the
career record) as soon as possi
ble." Ramee said 011 the eve of the
game in which the record should
fall. "After I got 10 assists in my
first game (as a freshman). I
looked up the assist mark. But I
haven't thought much about it
since then."
Ramee. however, said he'd
much rather beat Arizona State
than break the assist record

for its first Pac-10 victory after
opening the conference season
with a pair of road losses to the
Washington schools last weekend.
And Ramee remembers last
season well, when Stanford
dropped its first six Pac-10 games
before finally winning. "We (the
team) talked about that after
losing (Saturday) to Washington
State," Ramee said. "We've got to
stop losing now, before it starts
snowballing like it did last year."
Davis, though, is quick to point
out that while the Cardinal was
more experienced last season, it
was also hurting while it was losing
those six games. "It's different in
that this year we're young and in
experienced," he said. "Last year,
we were playing well in December
and then got a couple of key injur
ies and struggled."
Stanford isn't the only team that
has been doing more losing than

winning of late. Arizona State. 5-6
overall and 0-1 in the Pac-10. has
dropped its last four. The hardest
of those setbacks for Coach Bob
Weinhauer was the most recent
one. when the Sun Devils squan
dered a seven-point lead with 34
seconds left and lost, 61-60. to
rival University of Arizona.
Nonetheless, the Sun Devils
have Davis worried, particularly
because they are big and quick.
Teams like Washington are big.
but not quick, while teams like
Arizona — Stanford's opponent
Saturday afternoon — are quick,
but not big. Arizona State,
however, is both.
Although no Sun Devil player is
averaging more than 12 points per
game, three are scoring in double
figures. Freshman forward Chris
Sandle is averaging 1 2. sophomore
guard Steve Beck 11.2 and an
other sophomore guard. Bobby
Thompson. 10.6 points per game.

ward, round out the starting line
