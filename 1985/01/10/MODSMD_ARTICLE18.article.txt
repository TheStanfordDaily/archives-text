The best part about tonight's
basketball game against Arizona
State University for Stanford isn't
that it's against a team with a
losing record. Or even that it's
against the only Pacific 10 Confer
ence team Stanford beat twice last
season.
It's that tonight's game starting
at 7:30 is in Maples Pavilion,

and his 8-4 Cardinal team.

all-time assist leader with 282.

an eight-year-old record held by
Mike Bratz. who presently plays
for the National Basketball Asso
ciation's Golden State Warriors.
"My goal has been to get it (the
career record) as soon as possi
ble." Ramee said 011 the eve of the
game in which the record should
fall. "After I got 10 assists in my
first game (as a freshman). I
looked up the assist mark. But I
haven't thought much about it
since then."
Ramee. however, said he'd
much rather beat Arizona State
than break the assist record
tonight. Stanford is still looking

Stanford junior point guard Keith Ramee, barring a fluke, will
break the all-time Cardinal assist record of 281 that he now
shares with Golden State Warrior Mike Bratz.
