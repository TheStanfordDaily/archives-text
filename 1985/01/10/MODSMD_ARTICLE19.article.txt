## Old lessons relearned 
### 
Last season, the Stanford men's
basketball team began its Pacific
10 Conference pi a > with six
straight losses. At that point, the
second-guessers had a field day.
Cardinal Coach Tom Davis wa
criticized for scheduling too many
pushovers and therefore not pre
paring his team for conference
play. Teams like Western Mich
igan University. Bemidiji State
and the University of California at
San Diego made Stanford look
like the second coming of George
town University.
But when Stanford started dan
cing with the big boys, it got lost in
the shuffle. What was worse was
that every game was within five
points, theoretically meaning that
the players didn't know how to
win when things got close.
This writer wasn't any different.
1 pointed my finger right at Davis
and waved it with unceasing ven
geance. Before the season began 1
even asked, with a slightly accus
ing tone, whether or not he
thought that his cake-walk was a
mistake or not.
He said, not to my surprise, that
the scheduling wasn't the reason
that the Cardinal had started so
poorly. Key injuries were more to
blame than not being prepared.
Maybe so. I believed him, a
little bit. But he was going to have
to disprove my notion this year
when he again stacked the
preseason games with the Univer
sity of the Pacific, Seattle Univer
sity and, once again, UC San
Diego.
So what happens. The Cardinal
goes 8-2 in the preseason and then
loses its first two conference
games. With two of the better
teams in the conference coming to
town tonight and Saturday, it
would seem that the critics may
have been right all along.
Maybe not. During the holiday I
had the good fortune to speak with
an old high school friend. Our dis
cussion went from our respective
states of being to our favorite sub
ject. UCLA basketball.
Since I'm originally from Los

Angeles. I've always been a
UCLA basketball fan. I know it
doesn't sound good, but that's the
way it is. Stanford-UCLA games
used to be absolute torture.
Both of us lamented the present
condition of Bruin basketball,
each having seen DePaul Univer
sity turn the Bruins demon-blue
and St. John's University make
them a little red in the face.
At which point I said. "I wish it
was like the old days, when
Wooden would have them beat up
on Long Beach State by 40 points.
Those teams always knew how to
win."
I didn't say anything for a few
seconds. The silence was broken
by "Jason, did you die or some
thing?" No, but 1 did feel a little
stupid. A little hypocritical.
During all the year's that the
legendary John Wooden coached
at UCLA, year after year he
would play a lot of teams that
didn't deserve to even look at a
National Collegiate Athletic Asso
ciation championship banner (let
alone 10 of them).
Once in a while, the media
would make fun of Wooden's
parade of patsies, but they always
knew that he did it for one reason,
to get his team used to winning.
Winning big.
The logic is that you have to
learn to walk before you can run.
Wooden believed that playing a
bunch of tough teams and possibly
losing a few games wasn't as
valuable as getting the confidence
from winning.
As a kid I agreed with that phil
osophy. I mean it's hard to argue
with somebody like Wooden.
But then at the worldly age of
22, the ace reporter and
propounder of pack journalism
that I am so proud to be redis
covered a lesson I learned a long
time ago and forgot for some un
known reason.
Now this isn't meant to be an
apology, I just decided to change
my mind a little. I'm allowed to do
that.
