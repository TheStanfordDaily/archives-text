# Prof, warns of population strain

### INDRA SEHDEV 
Despite recent United Nations estimates that
birth rates arc declining in many parts of the
world, a Stanford professor warned that over
population will continue to trigger global con
cern in the years ahead.
In a speech to about 60 people yesterday af
ternoon in Annenberg Auditorium. Biology
Prof. Paul Ehrlich discussed the disparity be
tween demographic and ecological views of the
population problem.
The population of India in the year 2025 is
estimated to be 1.2 billion in current popula
tion projections made by the United Nations.
Ehrlich said. This estimate is lower, by 4 per
cent. than previous U.N. projections.
The decrease is "a seemingly cheery thing"
to demographers. Ehrlich said. Demographers
see the stabilization of growth rates and death
rates as occuring when the population reaches
about 2 billion — the population of the entire
world in 1930.
But this seemingly "cheery" decrease in
growth rates does not make ecologists less
"nervous" about the population problem.

Ehrlich said. He used India as just one example
of "things not moving fast enough."
"Ecologists want to see a more rapid decline
in growth rates." he said.
"According to demographic statistics, lesser
developed countries are doubling every 33
years." Ehrlich said. He pointed out that when
a nation increases in size, it must also increase
the numbers of schools, hospitals, farms and
other social, political and economic institu
tions.
"Even in the United States, with all of our
advantages, we would be hard pressed to ac
commodate a population which doubled every
35 to 45 years. Lesser-developed countries
couldn't put in the capital or effort to do it."
Ehrlich said.
He went on to explain that the ecologist s
view is that the world is approaching the
"carrying capacity." or resources available rel
ative to a particular organism, of the planet. He
added that demographic ideas that assume
declines in fertility rates and decline, or at least
stabilization, of death rates are "not true."
Currently the world is getting rid of valuable

nonrencwahle resources in a "one-time
resource bonanza," Ehrlich said.
"We need to take into consideration long
term carrying capacity. There are reasons to
doubt our ability to raise our agricultural pro
ductivity."
He cited the depletion of fossil fuels, injec
tion of toxins into water supplies and the ero
sion of topsoil as a few of the reasons for the
projected lack of productivity. He also talked
about the distribution problem concerning the
food supply, saying society must take a conser
vative approach to the idea that if it could share
food equally, it would alleviate hunger.
"It is not at all clear that 4.S billion saints
would resort to vegetarianism and peaceful
sharing to help change the carrying capacity of
the world." he said.
He also said that since North America is the
only net agricultural exporter in the world,
sharing would mean that the farmers here
would support the rest of the world. "It
(sharing) makes you dependent on the weather

tion problems.
of just one area," he said. "It is going
to be hard enough to produce enough
food for just an additional one billion
people, even disregarding costs."
By practicing population control
and ending racism and other discrimi

nation, Ehrlich said the food supply
problem might be eased.
"We have to start learning to live
with each other and within the limits
of our income," he said. The chal
lenge society faces now is to give the
people inhabiting the earth now "a
decent life."
"Then we can worry about sup
porting a much larger population," he
said.
