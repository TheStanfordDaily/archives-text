## Unwieldy material buries 'Dune' 
### STEVE VINEBERG Daily staff 
I he viscous, putrescent nightmare imagery of
Eraserhead and the rigidly controlled romanticism of
I he Elephant Man (which looks like it was made by an
austere ( harles Dickens) lead one to expect miracles of
David Lynch"s third full-length movie, "Dune." And
indeed it is often visually astonishing. The young hero,
I aul Atreides (Kyle MacLachlan), son of an imperiled
duke, is trained tor combat in a body shield operated from
his waist that encases him in mirrors. His enemy, the cor
pulent Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (Kenneth McMillan),
has his pimples bled by doctors in punk outfits and then
Hies up above his throne like a malevolent variation on Ed
Wynn in "Mary Poppins," circling merrily — a one-man
cyclone. The Guild Navigator, who commands the
Huron's master, the Padishah Emperor (Jose Ferrer),
arrives at the Emperor"s court in a sleek black locomotive
that slides open to reveal, behind glass, a creature — the
brainchild of the father of E.T., Carlo Rambaldi — like a
swollen cerebellum with a vaginal mouth, pickled in a yel
lowish fluid. (When the Navigator withdraws, his black
suited attendants mop up the puddle he has left behind.)
Anthony Masters designs lor the Emperor's palace and
the industrial complex on Arrakis or Dune, the desert
planet Paul seeks to regain alter his lather s murder, are
loving hom to the greatest of all science fiction
films. Frit/ Langs "Metropolis," and the light-show ef
fects by Kit West occasionally recall the best of Ed
Emschwiller's experimental shorts.
Most extraordinary are the sand worms, reptiles of gar
gantuan length that glide beneath Arrakis' desert and
emerge in slow motion so it seems that the very sand has
grown jaws. Lynch and his photographer, Freddie Francis
(his collaborator on "The Elephant Man" as well), give
these omnivores such an expressive visual range that they
never look the same twice — at different times they suggst
a land-locked Moby Dick, an egg about to hatch, a Venus
flytrap, and a Georgia O'Kcefe sea shell. "Dune" must
surely be the best-looking fiasco in movie history.
When a movie as expensive (over $40 million) and as
long in the making (shooting began two years ago) goes as
disastrously wrong as this one, the most convenient — and
usually the most accurate — explanation is that the proj
ect got too big for the director, slipped out of his hands. In
this case, though, I don't think that David Lynch was ever
the right director for the material. Frank Herbert's be
stselling epic fantasy, a sweeping, exciting read for about
200 pages (while Paul and his mother. Lady Jessica, flee
from danger to danger in their escape from the Baron's
henchmen), hits a snag once Paul takes over the leader
ship of the Arrakeen rebels, the Fremen; then the patches
of humpbacked "poetry" so easily passed over in the first
half creep into prominence, now in the service of an ear
nestly presented pop messianic theme that, I am told, runs
through the other "Diine" novels as well.
The only way to make this dense narrative work on
screen would be to sustain the adventure element and let
the mythic dimension grow out of our attraction to warm
blooded human beings engaged in an archetypal struggle
— a feat that perhaps only the Irvin Kershner of "The
Empire Strikes Back" could accomplish. David Lynch,
the Dali of contemporary filmmakers, doesn't appear to
be interested in the characters or in archetypes, either;
faithful to Herbert's complicated narrative, he per
sonalizes the imagery yet remains totally, curiously
outside the story. His mark is all Over the movie — no one
else would have thought of puncturing the Baron's
pimples or leaving a watery trail behind the Guild
Navigator's vehicle — but it never transforms the un
wieldy material.
In fact. Lynch's virtuosity, since it in no way interacts
with the dialogue or the characters, makes them look even
sillier than they might have looked with a hack at the
helm. Inside the Langian decor and the imaginative make

up, an enormous cast barely makes a dent in the contus
ing, overloaded story and the jargonistic dialogue — 'he
movie is entirely in English, but it feels dubbed. Paul and
his allies (played by Patrick Stewart, Richard Jordan and
Everett McGill) are a lustreless lot, and so is his well
meaning, trapped father, (the German actor Jurgen
Prochnow. who should have been dubbed). As Lady Jes
sica, Francesca Annis looks stately and authoritative, but
her hyperrealistic upswept hairdo, with its brilliantine
finish (she might be a parody of a 1940s musical star), is a
more interesting character than the woman underneath.
We can't fault the actress for failing to make more of an
impression than she does, because though she is essential
to the plot — her training produced Dune's messiah — the
script reduces her to a futurisitc variant on Andy Hardy s
wise old mother.
Other talented performers fade quickly, too — Jose
Ferrer, Max von Sydow as an Arrakeen ecologist whose
blue-shaded eyes give him even more warmth than usual
(the addictive spice called melange, mined out of Dune s
sand, turns the irises of everyone exposed to it inky blue),
and Linda Hunt as the ducal palace housekeeper, the
Shadout Mapes. Hunt has mavbe one-third as much time
on screen as she did in "The Bostonians," but even so she
manages to introduce the eeriest domestic since Judith
Anderson played Mrs. Danvers in "Rebecca."
Sian Phillips, wearing a Medieval wimple over her bald
head, has an amazing first scene as the Reverend Gaius
Helen Mohiam. the scheming old witch who schooled
Lady Jessica in the peculiarly intuitive brand of magic she
has passed on to her son; Putting Paul through a sadistic
"test." she closes her eyes in a kind of sexual ecstasy as he
suffers and wraps her voice up tight into a resounding
growl. In her subsequent appearances, however, she has
nothing to do but cower and scream.
Some of the others strive to hold the camera by overact
ing — Brad Dourif, Silvana Mangano, even Kenneth
McMillan, who for the first time in his career fails to rise
above bad material (despite his flights through the air).
The only really amusing and finished performances are of
fered by the child actress Alicia Roanne Witt as Paul's
sister, born a mental adult, and the rock star Sting as the
Baron's nasty nephew Feyd Rautha, who poses for his
salivating homosexual uncle in nothing but a bronze jock
strap. Brief as their appearances are, these two alone con
vey a sense of location. Everyone else seems to have been
lost in this vast, incoherent epic or else truncated in the
editing process.
In adapting the novel. Lynch has tried to simplify the
story, not by eliminating supplementary characters and
subplots, but by omitting many of the incidents that ex
plain the references he has diligently retained. Anyone
who hasn't read the book would have only the vaguest no
tion of what sort of danger Paul poses to the Guild, to
what end the Fremen have tamed the sand worms and are
rebelling against the Emperor's forces, or what is the im
pact of Paul's spice-induced extrasensory hallucinations.
Herbert, in his ploddingly effective way, created a civiliza
tion in which language and ritual derive from the desper
ate need to conserve water, but Lynch touches so lightly
on this aspect of the tale that the intended climactic dream
image — a rainstorm — strikes us as an interpolation from
some other fantasy. I'm certain Lynch didn't mean to ex
clude non-readers of the Herbert saga, but 1 honestly
don't see how anyone not versed in the book's
idiosyncratic vocabulary could hope to follow either the
dialogue or the plot. (At the preview screening 1 attended,
ushers handed out glossaries in the lobby.) Probably the
best way to watch "Dune" is to shut your ears, anyway:
Image for image, it's a fantastic movie to look at. With the
soundtrack attached — and that most definitely includes
the Hollywood Religious Epic musical score by Toto and
the "thought" voice-overs by Paul and Lady Jessica (a
throwback to Eugene O'Neiil's "Strange Interlude") —
this cult extravaganza becomes a cult special.


Rock star Sting gives one of the really finished performances in "Dune."
