# Vineberg reviews the newest
## This season's crop disappointing 
### SIEVE VINEBERG Daily staff 
I helicvc I have lost my enthusiasm
for Eddie Murphy. Like everyone
else. I applauded his debut in "4N
Hours." where the director, Walter
Hill, gave him the most spectacular
entrance of any new star since John
Iravolta hopped across the screen in
"Saturday Night Fever." and when he
seemed slightly sour in "Trading
Places." one could assume it was the
fault of the whole curdled comedy
and not his alone. But I couldn't
watch his video comedy special.
"Delirious." in which he tried to
carry off. unwarranted, the kind of
assaultive obscenity and outlandish
behavior Richard Prvor has earned
the right to engage in. Pryordraws on
his own life for his stand-up routines;
Murphy has nothing to draw on but
his image, and the human veneer is
beginning to wear thin on his
shrewdly packaged entertainment
machine. When I close my eyes and
think of Richard Pryor. a dozen con
trasting studies present themselves;
the thought of Eddie Murphy calls up
nothing but a smug smile and a thick
pile of mean green. And no wonder
— his new picture, "Beverly Hills
Cop." brought in $18 million in its
first week of release.
The main difference between
Murphy and Pryor is evident in two
scenes early in "Beverly Hills Cop."
Murphy plays Axel Foley, a talented
but compulsively irresponsible
Detroit policeman whose buddy, a
convicted thief, returns from prison
and promptly gets himself killed.
Though the script (by Daniel Petrie,
Jr. from a story he wrote with Danilo
Bach) is dumb and implausible, the
dialogue listless and pointlessly, child
ishly profane, it does offer Murphy
the potential for demonstrating some
emotional depth, first in Axel's
reunion with his boyhood pal and
then in the scene where he must tell a
mutual friend (Lisa Eilbacher) about
Mikey's murder. But Murphy, unlike
Pryor, is no actor. Faced with the
demands of real emotion, he freezes
and flattens out; he might just as well
be posing for a passport photo.
Ot course Murphy has some funny
scenes in this movie — notably one in
which he checks into an exclusive
Beverly Hills Hotel — but there's
something unpleasantly narcissistic
about his top-of-the-world self
assurance, his certainty that he can
get away with murder. (Sooner or
later somebody is going to call him on
those gay routines that have become
part of his repertoire. Bad taste can
be. enjoyable, but in this case
Murphy's bad taste has crossed the
line into offensiveness: He's no
longer the naughty boy fulfilling
everyone's secret dream by using
four-letter words at a high society
banquet, he's a rude guest who
delights in insulting his host.)
"Beverly Hills Cop" isn't quite
murder, but it's a bad film that could

have been still worse without forfeit
ing a cent of its impressive box office
returns, probably, because the audi
ence for it was preset, like the audi
ence for "Ghostbusters." Martin
Brest, the director, shows some wit in
his handling of a car chase in the first
five minutes of the picture, but the
chase was devised, like the ones in
"The Blues Brothers." as a destruc
tion orgy, so he can't go very far with
it — and for the rest of the movie his
contribution is undistinguished.
"Beverly Hills Cop" is the sort of
rehashed and overbaked casserole
that relies exclusively on its actors to
spice it up.
As it happens, there are a couple of
fresh performers in the cast. I was
happy to see Paul Reiser (he was
Modell in "Diner") in the Detroit
precinct scenes, as Axel's needling
best friend on the force, but when
Foley follows a lead to southern Cali
fornia, Reiser leaves the picture.
Luckily, Judge Reinhold steps in at
that point as Billy Rosewood, a four
square young cop you know must
have been weaned on 1940s G-man
movies and "Highway Patrol" reruns.
(He's like a Harold Llovd character
without the ingenuity.) Reinhold's
performance is so laid back that he
hardly seems to be acting at all. until
you think about how different he was
as the fantasizing high school senior
who blows a fuse in "Fast Times at
Ridgemont High" and as the ob
noxious yuppie in "Gremlins."
Best of all is Bronson Pinchot, who
has two brief scenes as Serge, Lisa
Eilbacher's asistant at the art gallery
she runs in Beverly Hills — the two
funniest scenes in the movie (hands
down). With a high-pitched squeal
and an accent somewhere to the left
of Inspector Clouseau's, Pinchot
(who also appears briefly with a great
hangdog look in "The Flamingo
Kid") does a delicious send-up of
California chic small talk and
manages to steal the screen from
Eddie Murphy — though Murphy
tries to grab it back by raising his
voice a decibel and drowning him out.
"Stranger Than Paradise"
In his poem "The Sins of
Kalamazoo," Carl Sandburg wrote;
"And the children grow up asking
each other, 'What can we do to kill
time?'
They grow up and go to the rail
road station and buy tickets for
Texas, Pennsylvania, Alaska.
'Kalamazoo is all right,' they say.
'But I want to see the world.'
And when they have looked the
world over they come back saying it is
all like Kalamazoo."
That is more or less the theme of
"Stranger Than Paradise," a first film
by Jim Jarmusch that won the Na
tional Society of Film Critics Award
last week. The three main characters
— Willie (John Lurie), his cousin Eva

from Budapest (Eszter Balint), and
his best friend Eddie (Richard Ed
son) — start off in New York City,
travel to Cleveland (where Eva is
now living with an old aunt and where
Willie and Eddie, flush and on vaca
tion in a "borrowed" car, visit her)
and end up in Florida. But they are so
emotionally and intellectually limited
that, except for the difference be
tween Cleveland's snow and Florida's
sunshine, they perceive all places as
pretty much the same. We do, too,
because Jarmusch and his photog
rapher, Tom Di Cello, shooting in
black and white, participate in this
constrained vision by returning in
scene after scene to the underlife of
all American cities — the crummy
motels, the freeway signs, the grimy
skies. The note in the end credit

claiming that "Stranger Than
Paradise" was shot on location in all
three cities supplies the best laugh in
the whole movie. (The one lyrical

moment, when Eszter Balint, dressed
all in black, sits on a white bench at a
white table, watching the ocean
waves roll in, seems to come from a

different film.)
Jarmusch presents the theme comi
cally, and it's clear that he likes this
trio, who suggest a recasting of

Godard's "Band of Outsiders" with
characters who are imaginatively
(rather than just emotionally)
blocked. He makes their affected af-

fectlessness very charming, and the
three leading actors (as well as Cecil
lia Stark, who plays Aunt Lotte) are
potent subjects for the camera — per
haps tor Diane Arbus's camera. The
weird rhythms of their line readings
give the impression of dubbing, or
perhaps a parody of dubbing, and
once you get used to them they yield
a fair amount of wry, unsmiling
humor.
The story of how Wim Wenders
made a present ot 30 minutes' worth
of leftover film to Jarmusch, who
managed to get 20 minutes of footage
out of it and eventually parlayed it
into a full-length movie, is well
known by now. It's certainly amazing
to see a perfectly competent 90-

minute feature that was brought in
for $ I 10,000, and it was clever of Jar
musch to make such stringent limits
the subject of this comedy, rather
than disguising them — the movie is
one long take after another, and the
scenes don't dissolve or fade to black;
they are separated by blank grey
frames. This isn't the sort of clever
ness that makes great movies,
however, and though "Stranger Than
Paradise" is no worse than, say. Or
son Welles' "Macbeth," in which he
employed film noir lighting and a
sweeping camera to cover up the
Gene Autry set he was obliged (also
by financial difficulties) to shoot on at
Republic Pictures, somehow Welles's
impulse was potentially more exciting
than Jarmusch's. "Stranger Than
Paradise," originally planned as a
short, makes a narrow stretch out to
an hour and a half; the characters'
poverty of imagination bounces off
the audience and back behind the
camera.
"Car
"Cal," a small drama set in
modern-day Belfast, is worth seeing
for the director Pat O'Connor's un
hysterical portrayal of the daily indig
nities the people of that city sutler
under the \oke of a seemingly inter
minable civil war — barricades, body
searches, the brutality of the occupy
ing British soldiers — and even more
for Donal McCann's fine perfor

mance as a Catholic driven out of his
home by Protestant arsonists.
McCann shows us the different facets
of this man's personality simply by
the way he wears his clothes: In the
slaughterhouse where he works, he's
earthy and raucous; holed up in bed
with a rifle, prepared to fend off at
tackers, he's an irascible old coot; but
in a business suit, gulping down his
morning coffee, or reading quietly in
an easy chair with his spectacles on,
he suggests other regions of the char- ,
acter's personality you'd never have
suspected.
John Lynch plays Cal, his son. who
falls in love with the widow (Helen
Mirren) of a protestant in whose mur
der he himself is implicated
(unbeknownst to her). From afar, his
face has a native American cast to it;
close up, he looks like a rock star —
or, from some angles, like the young
John Travolta of "Welcome Back,
Kotter" and "Carrie." Standing in
the rain outside the library where
Helen Mirren works, he is the picture
of shattered innocence, the emblem
of lost chances; we can see in his eyes
that he's doomed. He's a James Dean
type, leaking emotion, telling us
everything he's feeling at every mo
ment — which is usually a mixture of
nervousness and fear and embarrass
ment. And finally that suffering ef
feminate face, matched as it is with
extremely unrefined acting, gets to be
a pain, especially when Cal enters his
martyr phase and starts burning him
self with cigarettes, Lawrence of
Arabia style, and begging the soldier
who roughs him up to hit him again.
By this time, his father has had a ner
vous breakdown — a scene Donal
McCann doesn't manage quite as

gracefully as the subtle ones Bernard
McLaverty wrote for him in the first
half — and bowed out of the film,
leaving it bereft of the relationship we
cared most about.
"2010"
In ••2010." based on Arthur C.
Clarke's sequel to his own "2001: A
Space Odyssey." the first space team
comprised of both Soviets and
Americans visits the abandoned
L'.S.S. Discovery and the mysterious
I'ycho Monolith, while back on earth
their respective countries teeter on
the edge of a nuclear war. Peter
Hyams wrote, produced, directed and
shot this banal, unexciting sci-fi ad
venture. which wastes an unusually
talented supporting cast (Helen Mir
ren. John l.ithgow, Elya Baskin.
Savely Kramarov, Madolyn Smith.
Mary Jo Deschanel) and adds
credence to the theory that Roy
Scheider (cast as the NASA chief
held responsible for the failure of the
Discovery mission) went to sleep
after "All That Jazz" and has not yet
awakened. Lithgow, playing another
acrophobe, manages to make his
character funny in a diferent way
from the raving neurotic he portrayed
in "The Twilight /one," and saucer
eyed Elya Baskin (Robin Williams'
clown pal in "Moscow on the Hud
son") has a few charming moments;
aside from these and one beautiful

shot of a man swinging from one
spaceship to the other on what looks
like a series of chairlift bars, the film
has nothing to recommend it.
Whenever Hvams feels the need for
mysticism, he reverts to Richard
Strauss's "Thus Spake Xarathustra
or replays keir Dullea's final message
to earth in "2001 : " My God. its lull
of stars." ("2010" quotes this line
reverently, as if Arthur C. Clarke —
or Stanley Kubrick — were T. S.
Eliot. Those of us who don't rank
"2001: A Space Odyssey" among the
great works of art ot our century may
find the repetition less than inspir
