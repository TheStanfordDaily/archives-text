### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Staff writer 
Off-campus press representation at Facultv Senate
meetings is slated for discussion when the senate convenes
this afternoon.
I he Senate Steering Committee, initiated bv Commu
nications Prof. Elie Abel, is expected to put forth a pro
posal allowing up to five off-campus press representatives
the opportunity to attend senate meetings; preference
would be given to local newspapers.
Currently. the senate meetings are only open to repre
sentatives of campus media: these include The Stanford
Daily, radio station k/SU and Campus Report. The local
newspapers and other external media receive their infor
mation through extensive notes and verbatim recordings.
"A public perception that Stanford has nothing to hide
from its neighbors would seem to me a significant plus."
Abel said in a letter to the senate.
"Stanford happens to be a major emplover in the area.

As one of man) facultv members who live off campus. I
can testifv that mv neighbors do not in e\er\ case under
stand. or show great svmpathv tor. the Universit) s posi
tions on a range ot issues that mav effect them direct!):
such issues as new staff and facultv housing, the widening
of Willow Road, toxic waste disposal, research policv and
others." he said.
The senate previous!) denied the request ot The Palo
Alto Weeklv in November 1953 to allow outside coverage
of its meetings. The senate voted 22-1 against the re
quest as several facultv members questioned the possible
decline in qualitv of debate and news coverage if meetings
were opened to off-campus media.
The steering committee refused to change its policy
again this fall after a request from The San Jose Mercury.
However, the committee agreed to meet with Abel after
he expressed opposition to the current restriction.
If the new proposal is adopted, it will go into effect at
the next senate meeting Jan. 24.
