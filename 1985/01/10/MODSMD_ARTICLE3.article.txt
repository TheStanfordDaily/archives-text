## Stanford basks in media limelight 
### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
As nationwide media attention turns to Stan
ford and Super Bow! XIX, University and Palo
Alto officials are being flooded with questions
from reporters, editors, producers and ticket
holders who want to know everything from the
best route to campus to the number of
restrooms at Stanford Stadium.
At Super Bowl information centers in the
area — Stanford's News and Publications office,
the Athletic Department, the special Super

SUPERBOWL

Bowl trailer in a parking lot outside Stanford
Stadium and the Palo Alto city manager's office
— the phones are ringing off their hooks.
But it could be worse, says Diana Diamond,
editor of a special Super Bowl guide published
by Stanford and distributed to the more than
2,800 journalists across the country who will be
on hand for the game.
Diamond, a reporter with Stanford News Ser
vice, said the 32-page newspaper has been ef
fective in "informing the media as best as we
could about the Super Bowl and Stanford."
Nevertheless, Diamond fielded 65 Super
Bowl-related phone calls in a single day last
week. On Tuesday, ABC-TV called Diamond
five times with questions and Time magazine
called twice. Diamond has been working exclu
sively on Super Bowl stories since Jan. 1.
The Stanford guide features an impressive

color cover and map. a statement from Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy and articles
about the Super Bowl and the University . It cost
$6,500 to produce, not including staff time, said
Diamond.
Palo Alto printed 4.000 Super Bowl XIX
press kits of its own. Each contains seven "fact
sheets" describing the town's points of interest,
economic profile, location and population, gov
ernment. cultural and recreational activities,
quality of life and history.
June Fleming, assistant city manager of Palo
Alto, said the response to the kit has been so
great that the city might print a second version
for use after the Super Bowl.
The Palo Alto package, printed on heavy
bond white paper with green lettering and the
insignia of the El Palo Alto redwood tree on
each page, cost $10,000 to produce. The history
section includes three paragraphs on the found
ing of Stanford University in 1891.
Not surprisingly, the Stanford press effort
presents the University in a positive light.
Several pages are devoted to the strengths of
the University's Schools of Business. Law,
Medicine, Engineering and Humanities and
Sciences. Other sections look at faculty and stu
dent accomplishments, the Hoover Institution,
the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, the
competitive admissions process and"the cor
porate link" between Stanford and the Silicon
Valley.
Likewise, the Palo Alto press kit touts the
city's high median family income ($31,797),
strong record on education (90 percent of Palo


The University's Super Bowl press guide
Alto high school graduates go on to
college), and "architecturally diverse
tree-lined neighborhoods."
As the Super Bowl media blitz
shifts into high gear. Stanford will ap
pear with regularity in newspapers

and magazines and on radio and tele
vision across the country. Sources sav
that Time magazine is considering a
cover storv about Stanford and the
game for next week's issue. A Time
spokesman confirmed that a storv is
being written, but said it is magazine
policy not to reveal what the cover
will be in advance.
Alan Cummings, associate director

of athletics and director of Super
Bowl preparations here, said the
media attention is welcome after
thousands of hours of planning.
"Stanford University, well known
nationally and internationally, is cer
tainlv better known because "dateline
Stanford University' is being talked
about across the country," Cummings
said.
