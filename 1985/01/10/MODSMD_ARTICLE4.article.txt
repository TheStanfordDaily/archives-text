# Officials dispute humanities report
## 
### CAMERON KALLER Staff writer 
University officials here are calling into
question a report saying U.S. colleges and
universities are not giving students "an
adequate education in the culture and
civilization of which they are members."
The report, released by the National En
dowment for the Humanities, painted a
bleak picture of the present status of the
humanities in the nation's institutions of
higher learning, blaming academicians for
"failing to bring the humanities to life and
to insist on their value."
It also accused the schools of giving into
pressures from students for a more job
oriented education, due to students'
heightened interest in economic security.
In an interview. University President
Donald Kennedy said, "I don't recognize
Stanford in what I know of this report. The
trend here at Stanford has been in the
other direction."
According to an article published in The
New York Times last month, the
report,"To Reclaim a Legacy: A Report
on the Humanities in Higher Educa
tion." "laments what it terms the 'steady
erosion' in structured curriculums with
specific course requirements."
In 1980, Stanford made some
qualitative changes in its distribution re
quirements, forcing students to be much
more specific in their breadth of study.
"Before 1980, you could take any art or
English course and get humanities credit
for it. but the restrictions are much tighter
now," according to Alette Hauswald,
graduation assistant.

Currently, Stanford students must take
courses in eight areas of the School of
Humanities and Sciences and fulfill a
writing requirement and a foreign lang
uage requirement.
Carolyn Lougee, associate dean of
Humanities and Sciences, lambasted the

report, saying that "it is calling for some
thing as if it weren't happening that is, in
fact, happening." Stanford and Harvard
University were vanguards in this move
ment to put more emphasis on the impor
tance of study in the humanities nearly 10
years ago, according to Lougee.
"There's a lot of rhetoric in that report
that bears little or no relation to reality,"

Lougee said. "This report was appropriate
to the situation a decade ago, and was en
nunciatd to many groups at that time."
According to The New York Times,
William Bennet, the endowment's chair
man and possible successor to Secretary of
Education Terrence Bell, said that "too
much teaching in the humanities is 'lifeless
or tendentious, mechanical or ideological'
and that the curnculums on too many coY
leges are nothing more than 'a self-service
cafeteria through which students pass
without being nourished.' "
Lougee admonished Bennet's state
ments, and said that "he is using metap
hors that have been around for a long time.
If this (report) is understood to be another
voice in the structure, fine. If it's supposed
to be anything new, it's false.
"More so, pointing a finger at
humanities faculty and teachers as the
cause of the problem is a very destructive
move," Lougee said. "It's not couched in
sufficiently positive terms or set forth in
such a way to help faculties. It ought to
help rather than attack."
In the report, Bennet also criticized
schools for relegating too much of the in
struction in the humanities to the first two
years of college.
But Lougee said that "study of
humanities doesn't become relegated un
less a student moves out of the humanities.
Only because students don't go on is that a
feature of their early years and not the late
ones."
"There's a good reason for putting it up
front," Lougee said, "that's our best
chance of catching students who otherwise

wouldn't continue with English or philoso
phy. It gives them a foundation for explo
ration."
A testimony to the strength of the
humanities here is reflected in the number
of students who indicate upon entering
Stanford that they intend to major in the
field of humanities and the number of
those who end up doing exactly that.
"On\> 8 percent indicate an interest in
humanities before entrance here," accord
ing to Lougee, but when they go out, the
actual number in the humanities is closer
to forty percent. And the number of stu
dents finally majoring in natural science
and engineering go way down."
Kennedy said. "In times of uncertainty,
there's a tendency to focus harder on oc
cupational matters, careers, but it doesn't
mean that all else is being crowded out. I
find that students here are still pretty inter
ested in general, liberal learning."
The number of students majoring in the
humanities "may have dropped." Kennedy
said, " but it's important to note that the
drop has been due to increases of students
in interdisciplinary majors. And anyway, it
isn't clear that you ought to measure who's
majoring in what, but who's taking what.
According to Kennedy, signs show that
students are not taking fewer courses in
the humanities even though the number of
those majoring in it may have dropped.
According to the study, the number of
students majoring in the humanities has
fallen off sharply since the early '70s. Phil
osophy majors are down by 41 percent,
modern languages by 50 percent. English
by 57 percent and history by 62 percent.
