Reagan may break his promise
WASHINGTON — President Reagan hinted last night for the first
time that he might relent on his campaign promise not to use Social Se
curity cuts as a means of reducing the federal deficit.
At a nationally televised news conference, his 26th. Reagan said that
if there were "an overwhelming bipartisan majority in both houses" in
favor of freezing Social Security and cost-of-living increases. "I would
have to look at that situation and what I was faced with, with regard to a
possible congressional mandate."
But the president held firm on two other campaign pledges. He said he
did not favor cuts in his military buildup beyond those already agreed to
by the Department of Defense, and he repeated his long-held view that a
tax increase would be undesirable.
"We have made a great start on a recovery that is based on sound
principles and not on artificially stimulating the economy." Reagan said.
"We're going to stay with a plan of that kind. I think that a tax increase
would be counterproductive."
The president denied that he had painted himself into a corner with
his 1984 campaign promises and would be unable to meet administra
tion budget goals. Aides already have said that he probably cannot meet
the original White House objective of cutting the federal deficit in half to
$100 billion over a three-year period.
Number of jobholders hits a high
WASHINGTON — The nation's total unemployment rate edged up
slightly to 7.1 percent in December while at the same time the total
number of Americans holding jobs rose to a record 107.9 million, the
Department of Labor reported yesterday.
Presenting the monthly statistics to Congress. Director Janet Nor
wood of the Bureau of Labor Statistics stressed the positive, noting that
a total of 340,000 new jobs were created in December, including strong
gains in manufacturing employment for the first time in several months.
In her testimony, Norwood also emphasized the steady growth in em
ployment that has occurred since the recession ended in 1982. "More
than 7 million jobs," she noted, later remarking, "That's pretty strong."
But because the number of Americans looking for work shot up by
390.000 after several months of virtually no increases in the labor force,
the ranks of the unemployed also increased 49.000, to 8.2 million, the
Department of Labor said.
Civilian unemployment, which excludes members of the armed forces
on duty in the United States, stood at 7.2 percent last month, only
slightly higher than the revised 7.1 percent rate for November that also
was announced yesterday. Total unemployment for November, mean
while, was 7 percent.
Egypt asks for more U.S. aid
CAIRO, Egypt — Egypt has asked the United States for a boost in
economic and military assistance of almost $1 billion for fiscal 1986, ac
cording to Prime Minister Kamal Hassan Ali.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Ali said Egypt was count
ing on increased American aid to offset an expected fall in income this
year from oil sales, remittances from Egyptians working abroad and
tourism.
"Economic cooperation with the United States is one of the main
goals and means to compensate for all these difficulties," he said. "These
are the main items we cannot face because they are the real income
(from) foreign currency for us."
Egypt earned about $2.8 billion in oil sales and $3.4 billion in remit
tances from Egyptians working abroad during fiscal 1984, which ended
last June. But the world oil surplus and the end to the economic boom in
the Arab states of the Persian Gulf are expected to cut substantially into
these key earnings in the coming year.
Court rules on bankruptcy laws
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court, rejecting pleas from the
Reagan administration and 31 states, ruled yesterday that in some cases,
industrial polluters can use federal bankruptcy laws to avoid the cost of
hazardous-waste cleanup orders.
The justices unanimously said that companies may escape such costs
when they go into bankruptcy after losing control of their business to a
state-appointed receiver.
But the court, stressing the narrow scope of its ruling, left open the
question of whether such companies would be liable if they went into
bankruptcy before they lost control of their assets. And the justices em
phasized also that states were still free to prosecute environmental law
violators and impose fines, injunctions or criminal contempt proceedings
to curb industrial pollution.
Nonetheless, the decision came as a setback to attorneys for the ad
ministration and dozens of states that have filed hriefs urging the justices
to overturn a lower-court ruling that allowed polluters to avoid cleanup
costs by invoking the bankruptcy laws. Lawyers for the Council of State
Governments and other groups, for example, called the ruling a
"blueprint" for evading environmental laws.
U.S. condemns Vietnam attacks
WASHINGTON — The State Department yesterday strongly con
demned Vietnam's military incursions into Thailand and said the United
States was willing to increase arms aid to the Bangkok government if
needed to meet the threat.
"These unprovoked and hostile acts against Thailand are deplorable,"
spokesman Alan Romberg said, reading a prepared statement. "We call
on Vietnam to cease these attacks and to refrain from further violations
of the accepted norms of decent international behavior."
Romberg said that Thailand, a longtime U.S. ally, has not asked for
any new arms aid this year hut that U.S. officials "stand ready to respond
to future requests."
Communist Vietnam, which has occupied most of Cambodia since
1978. launched a major offensive against Cambodian guerrilla groups
with bases near the Thai border in November. On Monday and Tuesday,
Vietnamese forces crossed into Thailand at several points in pursuit of
Cambodian rebels, shooting down a Thai air force plane and clashing
with Thai army units.
Romberg said the State Department was "-in very close touch" with
the Thai government on the issue. Assistant Secretary of State Paul Wol
fowitz also met yesterday with Chinese Ambassador /hang Wenjin to
discuss the conflict, officials said. China has joined the United States in
opposing Vietnam's expansion into Cambodia and has reportedly pro
vided major aid to the Cambodian guerrillas.

Egypt asks for more U.S. aid
CAIRO, Egypt — Egypt has asked the United States for a boost in
economic and military assistance of almost $1 billion for fiscal 1986, ac
cording to Prime Minister Kamal Hassan Ali.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Ali said Egypt was count
ing on increased American aid to offset an expected fall in income this
year from oil sales, remittances from Egyptians working abroad and
tourism.
"Economic cooperation with the United States is one of the main
goals and means to compensate for all these difficulties," he said. "These
are the main items we cannot face because they are the real income
(from) foreign currency for us."
Egypt earned about $2.8 billion in oil sales and $3.4 billion in remit
tances from Egyptians working abroad during fiscal 1984, which ended
last June. But the world oil surplus and the end to the economic boom in
the Arab states of the Persian Gulf are expected to cut substantially into
these key earnings in the coming year.
Court rules on bankruptcy laws
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court, rejecting pleas from the
Reagan administration and 31 states, ruled yesterday that in some cases,
industrial polluters can use federal bankruptcy laws to avoid the cost of
hazardous-waste cleanup orders.
The justices unanimously said that companies may escape such costs
when they go into bankruptcy after losing control of their business to a
state-appointed receiver.
But the court, stressing the narrow scope of its ruling, left open the
question of whether such companies would be liable if they went into
bankruptcy before they lost control of their assets. And the justices em
phasized also that states were still free to prosecute environmental law
violators and impose fines, injunctions or criminal contempt proceedings
to curb industrial pollution.
Nonetheless, the decision came as a setback to attorneys for the ad
ministration and dozens of states that have filed hriefs urging the justices
to overturn a lower-court ruling that allowed polluters to avoid cleanup
costs by invoking the bankruptcy laws. Lawyers for the Council of State
Governments and other groups, for example, called the ruling a
"blueprint" for evading environmental laws.
U.S. condemns Vietnam attacks
WASHINGTON — The State Department yesterday strongly con
demned Vietnam's military incursions into Thailand and said the United
States was willing to increase arms aid to the Bangkok government if
needed to meet the threat.
"These unprovoked and hostile acts against Thailand are deplorable,"
spokesman Alan Romberg said, reading a prepared statement. "We call
on Vietnam to cease these attacks and to refrain from further violations
of the accepted norms of decent international behavior."
Romberg said that Thailand, a longtime U.S. ally, has not asked for
any new arms aid this year hut that U.S. officials "stand ready to respond
to future requests."
Communist Vietnam, which has occupied most of Cambodia since
1978. launched a major offensive against Cambodian guerrilla groups
with bases near the Thai border in November. On Monday and Tuesday,
Vietnamese forces crossed into Thailand at several points in pursuit of
Cambodian rebels, shooting down a Thai air force plane and clashing
with Thai army units.
Romberg said the State Department was "-in very close touch" with
the Thai government on the issue. Assistant Secretary of State Paul Wol
fowitz also met yesterday with Chinese Ambassador /hang Wenjin to
discuss the conflict, officials said. China has joined the United States in
opposing Vietnam's expansion into Cambodia and has reportedly pro
vided major aid to the Cambodian guerrillas.

Reagan may break his promise
WASHINGTON — President Reagan hinted last night for the first
time that he might relent on his campaign promise not to use Social Se
curity cuts as a means of reducing the federal deficit.
At a nationally televised news conference, his 26th. Reagan said that
if there were "an overwhelming bipartisan majority in both houses" in
favor of freezing Social Security and cost-of-living increases. "I would
have to look at that situation and what I was faced with, with regard to a
possible congressional mandate."
But the president held firm on two other campaign pledges. He said he
did not favor cuts in his military buildup beyond those already agreed to
by the Department of Defense, and he repeated his long-held view that a
tax increase would be undesirable.
"We have made a great start on a recovery that is based on sound
principles and not on artificially stimulating the economy." Reagan said.
"We're going to stay with a plan of that kind. I think that a tax increase
would be counterproductive."
The president denied that he had painted himself into a corner with
his 1984 campaign promises and would be unable to meet administra
tion budget goals. Aides already have said that he probably cannot meet
the original White House objective of cutting the federal deficit in half to
$100 billion over a three-year period.
Number of jobholders hits a high
WASHINGTON — The nation's total unemployment rate edged up
slightly to 7.1 percent in December while at the same time the total
number of Americans holding jobs rose to a record 107.9 million, the
Department of Labor reported yesterday.
Presenting the monthly statistics to Congress. Director Janet Nor
wood of the Bureau of Labor Statistics stressed the positive, noting that
a total of 340,000 new jobs were created in December, including strong
gains in manufacturing employment for the first time in several months.
In her testimony, Norwood also emphasized the steady growth in em
ployment that has occurred since the recession ended in 1982. "More
than 7 million jobs," she noted, later remarking, "That's pretty strong."
But because the number of Americans looking for work shot up by
390.000 after several months of virtually no increases in the labor force,
the ranks of the unemployed also increased 49.000, to 8.2 million, the
Department of Labor said.
Civilian unemployment, which excludes members of the armed forces
on duty in the United States, stood at 7.2 percent last month, only
slightly higher than the revised 7.1 percent rate for November that also
was announced yesterday. Total unemployment for November, mean
while, was 7 percent.
