# Geneva talks draw varied reactions
## Reagan sees 'new dialogue' 
### 
President Reagan yesterday called
Tuesdays superpower agreement in
Geneva "the beginning of a new
dialogue" with the Soviet Union and
asked Moscow to do its part to bring
"new lite and positive results" to a
reinvigorated arms-control process.
There were signs, though, that one
important facet ot the U.S.-Soviet
agreement — involving future talks
on outer-space issues — was not
nailed down to the extent that had
been suggested in initial reports from
Geneva. State Department officials
said a running controversy over the
scope of the space negotiations was
not completely resolved by Secretary
of State George Shultz and Soviet
Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko.
leaving a touchy issue as an early or
der of business when substantive bar
gaining begins later this year.
That bargaining, under the terms of
the Tuesday agreement, is to involve
long- and intermediate-range offen
sive weapons, on which talks were
broken off last year, as well as at
tempting to prevent an arms race in
space.
Reagan's comments were a high
light of a day in which senior U.S. of
ficials fanned out through Western
Europe and other parts of the world
to brief key U.S. allies on the agree
ment with the Soviets.
Gromyko. meanwhile, left Geneva
for home with expressions strikingly
similar to Reagan's. The Soviet
diplomat called the agreement setting
the stage for expanded arms talks "a
certain step in establishing a
dialogue" between the two countries
but spoke of "the immense tasks"
that lie ahead in the course of the
future negotiations.
In opening his news conference last
night. Reagan reminded his audience
that "our differences with the Soviet
Union are many and profound." He
said the new U.S.-Soviet arms
negotiations "will be difficult" but
"we will persevere."
The president said. "It is my hope
that this week's meeting in Geneva,
while only a single step, is the begin
ning of a new dialogue between the
United States and the Soviet Union."
Saying that the United States will
be "flexible, patient and determined"
in the forthcoming negotiations,
Reagan also declared, "We now look
to the Soviet Union to help give new

life and positive results to that
process ot dialogue.
Reucan's comments came several
hours after a personal briefing on the
talks b> Shultz. who flew home early
u>sterda>.
Shultz: "We hau* a start"
112 ired but relaxed as he flew home.
Secretary of State George Shultz said
the Soviet-American agreement to
resume arms control talks after a 13-
month hiatus was "a good agreement,
hut nobody's hat should go into the
air."
"We have a start." Shultz said, but
he and other returning U.S. officials
emphasized that the two sides remain
far apart on the substantive issues of
arms control and that long, difficult
negotiations almost certainly lie
ahead.
Still, emphasizing the positive.
Shultz denied during a press confer
ence aboard his plane that he or
Gromyko ever gave any indication
that they would walk out of the talks,
contrary to some news reports from
Geneva Tuesday. "That wasn't the
atmosphere of the talks at all," he
said.
And officials returning with Shultz
also said that Gromyko asked "far
less" than the U.S. team expected.
Specifically, the Soviets never men
tioned a moratorium on testing of
anti-satellite weapons, nor did they
demand an end to U.S.
"militarization of space." The sec
retary said he had had preliminary
talks with President Reagan by tele
phone on the politically sensitive
question of who might be named to
head the new U.S. arms negotiating
team. Shultz reportedly favors Max
kampelman, a conservative Demo
crat who represented the United
States at the 35-nation talks on Se
curity and Cooperation in Europe.
Some White House officials,
however, have indicated opposition
to Kampelman because he would be
suspect in the eyes of conservative
Republicans.
The difficulties over picking an
arms negotiating team parallel the
current problems over the related
question of choosing a new U.S. am
bassador to the United Nations. Pres
idential aides object to Shultz's
choice of Vernon Walters, now a

roving U.S. ambassador and trouble
shooter. to succeed Jeane
kirkpatrick.
I he White House wants to take
Cabinet status away from the U.N.
job. but Walters, a retired Armv gen
eral. has said he would not want the
job in that case. At the same time,
presidential aides view kampelman
as a preferrable choice for the United
Nations.
Some ot the glow was taken off
Shultz s achievement in Geneva even
before his plane landed, as skepticism
about Soviet intentions surfaced
among members of his delegation.
Some officials on the aircraft
reiterated earlier fears that Moscow's
basic aim may be to use the new arms
talks to kill the "Star Wars"' space
defense efforts rather than cut offen
sive missile strengths.
More specifically, those officials
told reporters that the Soviets might
negotiate reductions on long-range
and intermediate-range offensive
missiles but then withold final agree
ment until the administration ac
cepted restrictions on its "Star Wars"
program.
West European reaction mixed
West European governments
reacted with a mixture of relief and
applause yesterday to the U.S.-Soviet
announcement of comprehensive nu
clear disarmament negotiations, but
warned against expecting too much
too soon from the talks.
British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher declared that Britain
"warmly welcomed" the agreement.
After he briefed her in London on
details of the agreement, Thatcher
assured presidential national security
adviser Robert McFarlane of Brit
ain's "continued support for the
United States in the negotiations."
Said one of the prime minister's ad
visers, "There is more rather than less
hope around today."
An official West German govern
ment statement labeled the agree
ment as "encouraging" and said it
was proof that Western alliance se
curity policy works.
"I'm cautiously optimistic," said
Chancellor Helmut Kohl. "The atmo
sphere is not bad."
Members of U.S. Secretary of State
George Shultz's Geneva negotiating

team fanned out through Western
Europe yesterday to brief the allies
on the agreement reached in Geneva.
In press conferences after the
private consultations. U.S. officials
were clearly attempting to keep ex
pectations from rising too high,
repeatedly stressing that Tuesday
night's accord marked only the begin
ning of a extremely difficult negotiat
ing phase.
McFarlane. addressing reporters in
London, and Richard Burt, assistant
secretary of state for European af
fairs. speaking to journalists a few
hours later in Brussels, used almost
identical language, noting that only
determination could bring successful
agreement.
"It was patience and persistence
that brought the Soviets back to the
negotiating table, and it is likely to be
patience and persistence that leads to
a meaningful agreement." Burt said.
Soviets hail accord
The U.S.-Soviet agreement to
negotiate on nuclear and space weap
ons was welcomed in Moscow yester
day as a triumph of Kremlin
diplomacy that will reduce fears of
superpowecr confrontation.
Both the state-run media and ordi
nary citizens hailed the outcome of
talks in Geneva
"Fears vanished with the news —
there will he negotiations." reported
Izvestia, the official government
newspaper, in its account of the
Geneva meeting.
"I'm glad — it's a step toward
peace." said a middle-aged man,
plodding through heavy snow outside
the central market.
"It's time for better relations with
the United States," said a fur-hatted
woman waiting for a trolley.
A commentary by Tass, the official
news agency, emphasized that the
proposal for negotiations came from
the Soviet side, despite the Kremlin's
expressed doubts about U.S. sin
cerity.
"The ball is now in the West's
court," said the Tass article, written
by political analyst Yuri Kornilov.
