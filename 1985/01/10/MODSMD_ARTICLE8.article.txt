## Rent control debate heats up 
### SUSAN HARRINGTON 
Rent control the first act of the newly formed
East Palo Alto City Council. The subject of a peti
tion drive by landowners. An ordinance approved
by 59 percent of voters last April. The focus of a
second petition, a superior court decision, and an
initiative defeated 971 to 1710 in a special election
on Tuesday.
Rent control — the hottest issue in East Palo
Alto. It does more than stoke the home fires — it
burns people up.
Of just over 6,900 dwellings that house East Palo
Alto's 18,191 residents, 55 percent are rental, in
cluding 95 percent of the housing units west of
Highway 101. Of multi-unit residences, 83 percent
are owned by out-of-town landlords. The clout in a
rent-control election is clearly with the renters.
What's more, between January 1978 and August
1979, less than a year before the city's incorpora
tion, rents increased by 45.5 percent for studios,
42.5 percent for one-bedroom, and 36.6 percent
for two-bedroom apartments, according to a San
Mateo County report.
The median price for homes increased 33 per
cent, the report said.
The median rent for studio apartments in 1979
was $228, for one-bedroom apartments $275, and
for two-bedroom apartments $336. Now, a check
of registration forms in public files reveals rents
from $300 for studios to $600 for two-bedroom
apartments.
But the root of the conflict surrounding rent con
trol is fairness.
The average East Palo Alto renter pays 27 per
cent of his or her gross income in rent, according to
an April 1983 report by the Community Develop
ment Institute, a nonprofit corporation in East Palo
Alto.
The figure is 3 percent below a "widely accepted
standard" defining affordable housing. But to East
Palo Alto residents, whose median income in 1980
was $13,000, according to information taken from
the U.S. Census, the percentage is still too high.
Many property owners, though, bristle at the
very idea of rent control. They call it an infringe
ment of their rights and say that it will drive down
property values and discourage investment in the
community. The primary beneficiaries of rent con
trol, they say, are Stanford students, many of whom
live in the heavily rental area just west of Highway
101.
By some standards, however, the East Palo Alto
rent control ordinance is fairly mild.
The ordinance allows for a yearly rent increase
tied to the Consumer Price Index. This year's in
crease was 9 percent. In contrast, Berkeley, an
other Bay Area city with rent control, allowed a 2

percent increase.
The rent control ordinance applies only to apart
ments of four units or more.
The ordinance requires landlords to give "good
cause" for evictions and to submit registrations of
all rental units for public filing. The $30 registra
tion fee is split between landlord and tenant.
In addition, the landlord can pass along to the
tenant 110 percent of capital improvements to the
rental property.
The ordinance also establishes a seven-member
Rent Stabilization Board composed of three
tenants, two landlords and two homeowners, to
receive petitions for special rent increases and
landlord-tenant complaints.
One of the most telling clauses of the ordinance
is the so-called "vacancy" provision. It prohibits
landlords from raising rents when tenants leave.
The vacancy provision is "the only thing that
keeps rents from going completely out of whack,"
according to Francisco Lobaco, an attorney
specializing in landlord-tenant disputes at the non
profit Community Law Project in East Palo Alto.
Contention from the start
The rent control ordinance was under attack
from the beginning. After the city council passed
the measure by a vote of 4-1 in November 1983,
property owners collected signatures toward a ref
erendum petition. They presented a petition with
1,592 valid signatures.
At the election, held in April, the ordinance was
supported by an overwhelming 59 percent of the
vote.
Even before the April election, however, prop
erty owners introduced a petition, of which 1,648
signatures proved valid, for an initiative that they
dubbed "The Property Owners' Civil Rights Initia
tive."
The petition was rejected twice — once by the city
clerk, Russell Averhart, acting on advice from the
city attorney, and once, in March, by the city coun
cil. The city council said the initiative wording was
vague and that issues addressed by the initiative,
Measure A, would be addressed by the April refer
endum.
However, in September a San Mateo County
court decision forced the city to schedule the spe
cial election held on Tuesday. It was estimated that
the single-issue ballot would cost the city $25,000.
Once again, East Palo Alto residents supported
the ordinance by a resounding margin.
Protecting property values
According to Edrick Haggans, chairman of the

"Yes on 'A Committee, and Gertrude Wilks, the
only city council member to oppose the rent control
ordinance, rent control discourages investment and
lowers property values in a city. East Palo Alto,
with its small tax base, can ill afford the "luxury" of
rent control, they say.
"There's a direct correlation between rent con
trol and property values," said a realtor contacted
at Elsie M. Finley & Sons, who declined to give his
name.
James Crockett of Crockett Realty, Inc. said
property values have not gone down yet, but they
will if the city adopts a "Berkeley-style" ordinance.
He termed the East Palo Alto ordinance "livable."
Crockett added, "Where there's rent control, in
vestors tend to shy away."
Don Provost, East Palo Alto's community devel
opment director, said he disagrees. "Investors still
want to come and develop East Palo Alto."
Provost reached for a stack of building permits
on a nearby table. There were six, commercial as
well as residential. One was for a 222-unit con
dominium conversion project; the city council ap
proved it on Monday.
The permits are just a "sample," Provost said.
"They don't ask about rent control — they just file
an application."
Provost added, "There's an increase in develop
ment because it (East Palo Alto) became a city."
Spreading the word
How do tenants feel about the ordinance?
Most hardly know about it, according to John In
grassia and Steve Gavin, two Stanford law students
who work with the East Palo Alto Community Law
Project. They said they have tried to disseminate
information on the ordinance among tenants with
little success.
Lobaco commented that violations of rent con
trol often come to light only when tenants come to
the Community Law Project after being threatened
with eviction. He said that the vast majority of
tenants threatened with eviction never contest the
eviction order but simply move out.
Jackie Foster, consultant to the rent stabilization
board, has taken steps to inform tenants of the or
dinance, however. A major mailing — a letter
describing tenants' rights and a copy of the registra
tion form for each individual rental unit — was
scheduled for mid-December.
Tuesday's election may have doused the prop
erty owners'* fires, leaving them smoldering. But
with an issue so controversial, East Palo Alto may
well smoke for years to come.
