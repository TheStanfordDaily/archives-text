SUCCESS
At ROLM, we believe there is no single way
to be successful. Rather, we believe success stems from
the creativity and ambition of the individual.
That's why we're committed to creating an environment
in which motivated people can succeed. The risk
in this approach is high, but the rewards are greater.
ROLM. We create an atmosphere for success.
The rest is up to you.
