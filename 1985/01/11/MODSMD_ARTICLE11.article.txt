## The 						Stanford Daily A 						welcome decision 
### 
A vote yesterday finally opened the doors of
the Faculty Senate to the press. And it's about
time.
The Stanford Daily, Campus Report and
k/SU radio were previously the only press or
ganizations allowed to attend the biweekly
meetings. But these groups' circulation cannot
serve to inform the various individuals, groups
and communities affected by the senate's deci
sions. At times, the senate discusses issues of na
tional importance.
We applaud Communication Prof, and Senate
Steering Committee member Elie Abel's state
ment that "A public perception that Stanford has
nothing to hide from its neighbors would seem to
me a significant plus." The senate has a clear re
sponsibility to hold open meetings.
When issues like the site of the future Reagan
Library, the relationship between the Hoover In
stitution and the University and the funding of
research projects bv the Department of Defense
are brought before the senate, more people have
a right to hear the discussions.
The senate's reasons for keeping its
meetings closed — uninhibited discussion and a
less formal atmosphere — are valid. But the pres
ence of the press and the right of the press to
have access to these meetings outweighs the in
convenience the\ may cause to the senate mem
bers.

After all. the issues the senate discusses, while
important, are not top-security type of questions.
Before yesterday's decision, reporters from ex
cluded press organizations were permitted to lis
ten to unedited tapes of the meetings or to view
verbatim notes of the preceedings. Hence, open
meetings would not violate any privacy.
Furthermore, the previous practice prevented
the press from presenting a proper presentation
of the proceedings. Reporters could not meet
early deadlines if their work began after the sen
ate adjourned and they could not convey the at
mosphere and tone of a meeting that they were
prohibited from attending. Their coverage was
more difficult and less complete.
Yesterday's decision will allow up to five
outside news organizations to cover firsthand the
momentous events of a faculty senate meeting.
We welcome the decision.
However, the decision only covers those senate
meetings held the rest of this year. It appears that
the senate wishes to enact a sound policy on just a
trial basis. This we regret.
Rather than beat an old horse with an old stick,
we urge next year's senate to adopt the measure
as a permanent rules change, as George Mason
wrote, "The freedom of the press is one of the
great bulwarks of liberty, and can never be
restrained but by despotic governments."
