## Policy without negotiation 
### 
The networks moved their news
shows to Geneva, just to show that
the arms-control talks are a Big
Story. Not that they couldn't be cov
ered just as well via satellite, but in
this video age, being there makes all
the difference.
The analysts — those people who
understand the news so that you don't
have to — went to Geneva hoping to
guess the end of the script before
President Reagan released the
novelization. The scenario was
supposed to go something like this:
President builds many missiles, scares
Evil Empire, wins arms control pact
and achieves peace with honor.
It's a heartwarming story, and one
which appealed to many voters who
saw Reagan as the "peace" candi
date. Unfortunately, like any B
movie, the ending of this one is easy
to guess: If it wasn't obvious before,
the point was hammered home when
it was leaked that Secretary of State

George Schultz had been instructed
not to "bargain away" the "Star
Wars" defense system.
Since fear of a new arms race in
space is the only thing that brought
the Soviets to agree to negotiate
again, this announcement made it
clear that the Reagan team not only
has no interest in an agreement but
doesn't mind letting the Soviets know
that there isn't any point in talking.
This has been the pattern for arms
control talks under Reagan. His
negotiators make impossible
demands — unilateral cuts in Soviet
land-based missiles, or unilateral
withdrawal of Soviet missiles from
Europe. These proposals are de
signed to be rejected so that the
Soviets get the blame for blocking
progress towards disarmament.
Reagan's aversion to serious arms
control seems hard to understand.
After all, he is not our first anti
communist president, but he is the

first in the nuclear age to make no
real attempt to limit the arms race.
Reagan is a unique individual, to be
sure, but there is a certain logic to his
refusal to negotiate in good faith.
First of all, it's part of his appeal.
Cowboys don't talk, they shoot from
the hip. Negotiations imply a world
with give and take, a level of moral
complexity that many people are un
comfortable with. Like Olympics
without competitors, foreign policy
without negotiations create the illu
sion that we can do anything without
consulting anyone.
This feeling of omnipotence is a
major part of the New Patriotism.
There is a sexual element to all this:
America is "standing tall" while
Reagan threatens to make Soviet
missiles "impotent." Phallic
militarism is in style right now — ads
promise that if you join the navy, you
can shoot off rockets. At this point,
restrictions on the number of missiles

we could build would come across
like national castration.
Furthermore, military
Keynesianism — subsidizing the eco
nomy through the purchase of weap
ons — is the pillar of the recovery.
Arms control could take away the
justification for massive spending,
bursting the bubble that gave Reagan
his re-election. It makes sense, from a
profit point of view, to continue to
build "bargaining chips" than to actu
ally bargain them away.
But the main reason that Reagan's
people have achieved no arms con
trol, and will achieve none, is that
arms control is in direct conflict with
their plan for America. These are
people that look upon negotiations as
a sign of weakness, who see military
power as the only currency of inter
national relations and don't believe
the communists can be trusted to
keep agreements anyway. To Reagan
and the people who gather around

him, every arms-control agreement
reached to date has been a mistake.
A treaty at this point might hinder
the most important parts of the
Reagan build-up. Specifically, the
most major additions to our strategic
forces, the MX and the Trident II
missiles, have yet to be deployed. Not
only will these weapons drastically
raise the number of U.S. warheads,
but each will be a first-strike weapon
— powerful and accurate enough to
take out unlaunched Soviet missiles.
At the same time, Reagan is put
ting utmost stress on development of
a "shield" that is supposed to destroy
incoming missiles. Suddenly, the as
sumption is not that no one will
launch nuclear missiles because their
use would be too horrible. Now the
emphasis is on limiting the damage
caused by nuclear war — through
civil defense as well as through an
anti-ballistic missile system — so as to

prevail in a nuclear conflict.
Why does Reagan want us to
prepare for nuclear war? Why are we
feverishly acquiring first-strike weap
ons? The theory he seems to be acting
upon is that of "anticipatory retalia
tion:" nuking them before they nuke
us. As Reagan gets headlines for what
amounts to a photo opportunity in
Geneva, Congress continues to vote
funds for the weapons that could start
World War 111.
Reagan said in one of the debates
that he didn't know whether Ar
mageddon was going to happen next
year or a thousand years from now.
It's clear, though, that if the Lord in
tends it to be during the next four
years, Reagan is quite willing to do
his part.
