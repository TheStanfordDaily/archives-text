## The 						mental anguish of freshman year 
### 
As an underclassman brimming with hopes, with
ambition, with vim and vigor, I am forced to
protest. Frosh by the throngs are being forced to go
through mental anguish and self-doubt that should
be inflicted upon no human (or animal). The result
is a mental state balanced precariously on the edge

VIEWPOINT

of abysmal immaturity. Take, for instance, this piti
ful excuse for a letter written to the resident assis
tants at Hall:
Dear Sirs,
Yes, I'm a frosh, and proud of it. But, being a
frosh, there are some questions I have about Stan
ford. questions about all sorts of things that I'm a
little embarrassed to be ignorant of. Not wanting to
increase my internal tension with these pent-up in
quiries and thus causc unwanted skin problems, I
have decided to be open about this. So here below
are my questions, answerable by any upperclass
man or any idiot for that matter, or do I repeat
myself? In any case, here goes:
1. What is a daiquiri?
2. II Memorial Auditorium is abbreviated
MetnAud. is Braun Music Center called Brau Cen
ter? And is its department head, therefore, the
Meister of Brau Center?
3. Where am I?

4. How do those neat meal-card machines work?
5. Is it normal for me to be experiencing severe
mental trauma?
6. How drunk will I be if I drink one beer?
7. Where do 1 go for treatment of paranoia and
chronic depression?
8. What do you do if your roommates lock you
out of your room on purpose?
9. Is it okay if I don't make my bed every day?
10. Can I have more than one Coke at dinner, or
would that make me hyperactive?
11. Does calculus require much outside
homework?
12. Where do all those freshman girls go at
night? ,
13. How can I find out whether or not I'm
bisexual?
14. What should I do with my sled until it starts
snowing in February?
15. Where do they sell Clearasil around here,
anyway?
16. Is taking 19 credits going to be difficult?
17. Does the dining-hall food consist of the
proper four food groups in correct proportions,
with all the right vitamins, minerals, trace elements
and everything?
18. Who let all those rude people with paper
airplanes and loud obnoxious voices into the
Flicks?

19. How does a highly motivated but somewhat
inexperienced guy like me go about picking up
some hot babes?
Well, that's just the beginning of my scholarly in
quiry into the workings of Stanford, but I think that
the remnants of my ignorance will be assuaged by
my Sexual Education 001 class. I sure hope so. I'm
looking forward to the swell time I'll have here
once I, like you awesome upperclassmen, know
everything. Until then, I remain
Respectfully your humble servant,
Eric Reifsnider, Frosh in Res.
Mercifully, the letter ends here. Notice the pitiful
personal indictment of self, lack of confidence and
general absence of anything but a whining kow-tow
to upperclassmen and their supposed wisdom. But
that's normal; what reflects so poorly on this unfor
tunate chap's treatment is that he has been driven
to pester others with his insecurities. Heck, I don't
want to hear from perverts like him, and I'm sure
you don't either. So let's try to avoid inflaming the
anxieties of these little creeps, okay? That way they
are sure to mature into great guys and gals like we
are. I'm sure you know what I mean.

engineering.)
