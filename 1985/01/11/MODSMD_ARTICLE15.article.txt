Climate of fear
Henry Organ stated, in his letter
on Stanford's bad employment
practices (Campus Report. Nov. 28)
that he could not understand why
Stanford "should fear fairness." I am
a clerical worker and have been
fortunate in m\ three-and-one-half
years at Stanford in having received
fair, considerate and helpful supervi
sion. But those unlucky workers who
suffer anxiety in their jobs because
of the high-handed arrogance of
their supervisors can recognize the
problems they face every day at
work in Organ's clear and discerning
account.
The case of Elmas Gokcek. a
former half-time employee in ac
counts payable in the controller's
office, illustrates the worst of what
Organ has described. Gokcek had
the audacity to speak up in defense
of an employee who had been dis
missed without cause in October
1983. Maria Indano was an efficient

and courteous worker, who knew
how to improve the filing system and
had. in fact, cleared up a consider
able backlog. Indano was fired be
cause. according to her supervisor,
she had "raised her voice." Indano's
fellow workers wrote testimonials
proving the excellent skills and cour
tesy she demonstrated at work. At
the hearing, two witnesses, despite
their own great fear, defended In
dano and the third witness. Gokcek.
fearlessly declared that Indano had
in no way shown discourtesy to the
supervisor. Gokcek then asked the
hearing officer if she could expect a
discharge herself in six months. The
hearing officer (whose salary is paid
entirely by the University) assured
her that she need have no fear for
her job. However. Gokcek did not
get her scheduled review in March
and in April was offered full-time
work in a very high-pressure area.
Her supervisor knew this job was
unsuitable but Gokcek was given no
choice — she could take the new

position or she could quit. Her
former half-time position was
eliminated.
Clerical workers at Stanford
desperately need fair representation.
I am appalled that Indano, a first
rate worker, whose efficiency, intelli
gence and friendliness benefited
everyone, was arbitrarily dismissed
at the whim of her supervisor. The
"hearing" for her was an absurd
sham, since there was no way she
could be reinstated.
With this kind of behavior, the
University trifles unpardonably with
working people's livelihoods — their
economic survival. A climate of fear
is created and the atmosphere of
anxiety and suspicion is widespread.
The clerical workers need fair repre
sentation — we need someone in our
corner. We need a union.
People in the Stanford community
must demand that workers receive a
fair hearing and that the gross ir
regularities in cases such as Indano's
be shown and the bias of the Stan

ford arbitration process against the
employee be exposed.
The Stanford administration will
make no effort to clean up its act and
institute a fair arbitration process for
employee grievances unless enough
people — leaders in the community,
students, faculty, as well as workers
— complain loudly about arbitrary
firings and biased hearings and
demand justice with such strength
and persistence and determination
that the University will be compelled
to acknowledge the injustices and
implement effective reforms.
It may take the clerical workers'
joining forces with USW 680 to
expand the membership of the union
and thus create the power to bring
about such change, in which not only
Organ but all of us who work here
are interested.
