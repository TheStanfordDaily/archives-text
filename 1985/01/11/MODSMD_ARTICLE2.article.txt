# Bowl alcohol policy spurs debate
## 
### GREGORY WEINGARTEN Staff writer 
The decision to allow Super Bowl
alcohol sales only from concession
stands has met with opposition from
local politicians, NFL members and
fans who want strolling vendors, or
"hawkers," to sell beer and wine.
The sobering ruling came from the
California Department of the Al-

SUPERBOWL

coholic Beverage Control (ABC) and
is currently under review following a
meeting at Stanford last Wednesday,
which included ABC's California
Director Jay Stroh, San Francisco Su
pervisor Quentin Kopp. Stanford's
chief Super Bowl operative Alan
Cummings and NFL representatives.
"I believe the director (Stroh) after
leaving the meeting had a good
feeling that he made his case and the
others accepted it without any prob
lems," said the ABC director's assis
tant, Manuel Espinoza. "I rather
doubt the department will change the
decisipn as to whether hawking is
allowed, but that's not to say that the
ruling won't be changed," he added.
"Our experience with hawking has
been mostly bad. We don't feel it's in
the best public interest to stimulate

the sale of beer.
"There's a lot of reasons that en
tered into our decision. One is crowd
control. Another has to do with our
concern over the consumption of beer
by people who are going to have to

get in their cars after the game and
drive home. From what I understand,
the traffic patterns at Stanford
Stadium after a game are pretty
rough," Espinoza said.
Opponents of the decision point to
the inconvenience of Super Bowl fans
who will have to make their way
through Stanford's narrow aisles to
purchase beer, blocking the view of

spectators trying to watch the game.
Another fear is that the beer-carrying
fans will spill their drinks on seated
attendants in their zeal to return to
their seats.
Kopp proposed to Stroh that the

ABC allow beer sales in the stands
through the third quarter of the game
and limit it to the counters during the
fourth.
Cummings said he and an NFL rep
resentative had asked Stroh to recon
sider the ABC's ruling from "a stand
point of convenience." He also said
the director told him the matter was
under review and that he would give

his final opinion later this week.
Of the seven professional stadiums
in California, only two sell beer in
stands â€” Candlestick Park and the
Oakland Coliseum, both of which
have had a long history of hawking.

Spectators at the Super Bowl are
prohibited from bringing cans and
bottles of any type into Stanford
Stadium as a safety measure.
Umbrellas have also been banned
from the game to keep spectators'
views unobstructed and to save them
from the run-off water that invari
ably occurs when umbrellas are
opened.
