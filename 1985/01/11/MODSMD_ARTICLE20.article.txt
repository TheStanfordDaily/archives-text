## Italian House chef is pasta perfect 
### XAVIER BRIAND 
Home was never like this. Twice a
day Salvatore "Rino" Laneve
prepares Italian cuisine for students
at the Robert S. Moore House (La
Casa Italiana) on Mayfield Avenue.
And it's not just any ravioli or
lasagna. Laneve, 37, is a two-time
winner of the coveted "Cordon Bleu"
award, once in 1976 and again in
1981, for his food management in
restaurants in Italy. He is opening his
own Italian restaurant in San Fran
cisco soon.
Laneve said his hobby is photogra

phy, but he concedes that cooking is
where his interests really lie. and his
meals reflect that enthusiasm. For in
stance, he regularly drives to San
Francisco's North Beach area to pur
chase authentic Italian ingredients for
his cooking — De Cecco pasta. San
Giorgio olive oil and other name
brand products.
That kind of attention to detail
begins to explain the popularity he
enjoys with the 62 students and
eating associates, plus frequent
guests, at La Casa Italiana.
"The kids here, thev like me, and

of course 1 like them." Lavene said,
speaking with his hands and with an
unmistakabK Italian accent.
"Lverything is natural, no micro
wave or frozen food. Everything can
be made b\ hand." he said in regard
to food preparation.
The most striking difference be
tween Italian and American food
preparation is the American habit of
"putting everything in one single
plate," he said. "If you order veal pic
cata in Italy, the veal comes by itself
with the sauce in a separate dish."
A native of Italy and the son and

grandson of restauranteurs. Laneve
developed his culinary abilities and
management skills in his father's res
taurant. Brigantino. in Brindisi, a
seaport on the Adriatic. Laneve was
still in Brindisi in 1981 when a
woman on her way to Greece for
vacation dined in Valentino, the res
taurant he managed, and "love"
changed his life.
"One year later I was here (Palo
Alto)." said Laneve, who left a wife
and twin boys in Italy.
Laneve enjoys living in Palo Alto
and is "really surprised at how open,
friendly they (the students) are" since
he began working at the house last
fall.
"He's not only a fine cook but a
wonderful person as well," said house
manager Laura Mullen, a senior
majoring in industrial engineering.
At a recent weekday dinner.
Laneve stood behind a counter in the
dining room, dishing out plates of
"lasagna al forno," exchanging
pleasantries and greeting each stu
dent by name. Finally he helped him
self and headed for the end of one
table, ashtray in hand. "1 smoke, but
everyone forgives me," he joked.
' "Veal is his best dish," declared
Scott Martin, a sophomore majoring
in history, as he picked his plate
clean.
"His eggplant lasagna," countered
Michael Tuchin, a sophomore major
ing in psychology. Tuchin ate at
Lagunita Court last year and said
Laneve's food is a big improvement.
If Laneve's menus have any weak
nesses, it seems to be desserts.
Several students, who declined to
give their names, complained about
having ice cream too often. But they
are unlikely to enjoy fancy Italian
desserts with any regularity.

Martin recalled one occasion last
quarter when Laneve had students iill
250 cream puffs by hand and pile
them into "a huge mountain" cov
ered with a chocolate-brandy sauce.
The resulting creation was too large
to fit into the freezer — a disaster tor
Laneve, who insists on constant tem
peratures for his food — and involved
so much work that it has not been
made since.
Laneve, who owns his father's res
taurant in Brindisi, will continue to

cook at the house when his new res
taurant, Mamma Tina, opens on
Grant Street in San Francisco next
month.
Laneve said the dinner-only res
taurant, which seats 45, will avoid
trendiness and concentrate on quality
and "caring about everything we do."
As owner of Mamma Tina, no
doubt Laneve will maintain the same
exacting standards for freshness and
authenticity as he does for La Casa
Italiana.

If Laneve's menus have any weak
nesses, it seems to be desserts.
Several students, who declined to
give their names, complained about
having ice cream too often. But they
are unlikely to enjoy fancy Italian
desserts with any regularity.

Martin recalled one occasion last
quarter when Laneve had students iill
250 cream puffs by hand and pile
them into "a huge mountain" cov
ered with a chocolate-brandy sauce.
The resulting creation was too large
to fit into the freezer — a disaster tor
Laneve, who insists on constant tem
peratures for his food — and involved
so much work that it has not been
made since.
Laneve, who owns his father's res
taurant in Brindisi, will continue to

cook at the house when his new res
taurant, Mamma Tina, opens on
Grant Street in San Francisco next
month.
Laneve said the dinner-only res
taurant, which seats 45, will avoid
trendiness and concentrate on quality
and "caring about everything we do."
As owner of Mamma Tina, no
doubt Laneve will maintain the same
exacting standards for freshness and
authenticity as he does for La Casa
Italiana.

Laneve cooked in his father's restaurant in Italy before coming to Palo
Alto and won two Cordon Bleu awards for his work there.
Home was never like this. Twice a
day Salvatore "Rino" Laneve
prepares Italian cuisine for students
at the Robert S. Moore House (La
Casa Italiana) on Mayfield Avenue.
And it's not just any ravioli or
lasagna. Laneve, 37, is a two-time
winner of the coveted "Cordon Bleu"
award, once in 1976 and again in
1981, for his food management in
restaurants in Italy. He is opening his
own Italian restaurant in San Fran
cisco soon.
Laneve said his hobby is photogra

phy, but he concedes that cooking is
where his interests really lie. and his
meals reflect that enthusiasm. For in
stance, he regularly drives to San
Francisco's North Beach area to pur
chase authentic Italian ingredients for
his cooking — De Cecco pasta. San
Giorgio olive oil and other name
brand products.
That kind of attention to detail
begins to explain the popularity he
enjoys with the 62 students and
eating associates, plus frequent
guests, at La Casa Italiana.
"The kids here, thev like me, and

of course 1 like them." Lavene said,
speaking with his hands and with an
unmistakabK Italian accent.
"Lverything is natural, no micro
wave or frozen food. Everything can
be made b\ hand." he said in regard
to food preparation.
The most striking difference be
tween Italian and American food
preparation is the American habit of
"putting everything in one single
plate," he said. "If you order veal pic
cata in Italy, the veal comes by itself
with the sauce in a separate dish."
A native of Italy and the son and

grandson of restauranteurs. Laneve
developed his culinary abilities and
management skills in his father's res
taurant. Brigantino. in Brindisi, a
seaport on the Adriatic. Laneve was
still in Brindisi in 1981 when a
woman on her way to Greece for
vacation dined in Valentino, the res
taurant he managed, and "love"
changed his life.
"One year later I was here (Palo
Alto)." said Laneve, who left a wife
and twin boys in Italy.
Laneve enjoys living in Palo Alto
and is "really surprised at how open,
friendly they (the students) are" since
he began working at the house last
fall.
"He's not only a fine cook but a
wonderful person as well," said house
manager Laura Mullen, a senior
majoring in industrial engineering.
At a recent weekday dinner.
Laneve stood behind a counter in the
dining room, dishing out plates of
"lasagna al forno," exchanging
pleasantries and greeting each stu
dent by name. Finally he helped him
self and headed for the end of one
table, ashtray in hand. "1 smoke, but
everyone forgives me," he joked.
' "Veal is his best dish," declared
Scott Martin, a sophomore majoring
in history, as he picked his plate
clean.
"His eggplant lasagna," countered
Michael Tuchin, a sophomore major
ing in psychology. Tuchin ate at
Lagunita Court last year and said
Laneve's food is a big improvement.
