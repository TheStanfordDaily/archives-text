# Paly High party crashers plead boredom
## 
### BONNIE ZARE 
Certain young strangers appear
frequently at Stanford parties — stu
dents from Gunn and Palo Alto High
Schools. Stanford students say they
generally dislike the presence of high
schoolers at campus parties, and fra
ternity members here say they try to
discourage it.
But weekend after weekend their
cars cruise the campus. They face up
to the dirty looks and the sight of
many unknown people. The people at
Stanford and the lack of activity in
Palo Alto make this task worth it, the
young party-goers say.
"It's sort of exciting to meet new
faces. And there are so many gor
geous guys at Stanford! Oh my God
— I walk into a Stanford party and I
am in love with 20 different guys in
one minute," said Paly senior Liz
Smith. "Plus," she added, "you know
they're smart at the same time."
Many Stanford women do not view
the high school girls as competition,
hut rather as a source of irritation.
"Kick all people with purses out!"
said Stanford junior Kathy Romero.
"Parties are a function for the school,
and they aren't a part of it."
Mike IJerandi, president of the
Sigma Chi fraternity, agrees. "We
detest high school kids showing up at
our parties. You get random high
school people and not only does your
liability increase, but it detracts from
the party atmosphere because they
stick out like a sore thumb."
Smith said, "Most people are so
drunk they don't care. It is hard to
mix unless people are really ripped or
you have enough courage to intro
duce yourself to strangers. This year
fewer people are going because every
one knows how much Stanford hates
it."
Smith said Palo Alto can be dead,
adding that attending Stanford par
ties is better than watching reruns of
"The Love Boat." She also men
tioned that Stanford parties are better
for dancing than "cliquey" high
school parties.
"Everyone goes to Stanford parties

when they are bored of high school
social life," said Paly junior Karen
McDonald. "Most parents like to su
pervise parties and don't let their kids
serve alcohol. Kids are also afraid of
having their houses trashed. You don't
have any responsibility when you go
to a college party."
Both Smith and McDonald said
they get good grades and are active in
their school's student government.
McDonald described typical students
who attend Stanford parties as

'Oh my God — I walk into a Stanford
party and I am in love with 20 differ
ent guys in one minute.'

middle-of-the-road types. "Ex
tremely studious people wouldn't
care about parties and total flakes
kick their parents out of the house

and party all the time," she said.
McDonald said most of her friends
do lie about their age, but said she ad
mits to Stanford students that she is

15. "Sometimes students don't
believe that's my real age. I think I'm
interesting enough to talk to. I don't
have to be ashamed," she said.
Gunn students were much more
reluctant to admit they went to Stan
ford parties. Some completely denied
that any of their friends attend the
parties. Elise Estes, a Gunn senior,
attributed the higher percentage of
Paly students attending to their prox
imity to campus. Many Gunn stu
dents live as far away as Los Altos.

"We usually only go on Big Game
weekend," she said.
Romero said parties at the Univer
sity of California at Berkeley have
many outsiders ranging from high
school students to older citizens from
the community. Cal Theta Delt Brad
Kent said his fraternity receives many
more outsiders than kids.
The fraternities here seem to be
aware of the problem of responsibil
ity that high schoolers present.
Recently the Interfraternity Council
(IFC) issued a recommendation that
party-goers be checked for identifica
tion. Beta Theta Pi president. Dennis
Furlong, said, "We're going to be
watching at the door and asking
people who look like they're in high
school for Stanford IDs or key IDs.
We're planning to follow the IFC
guidelines."
Pete Gabriel, Sigma Alpha Epsilon
treasurer, was of the same opinion.
He said that they do not answer
anonymous phone calls about parties.
"The University has given us that re
sponsibility. It's up to us to police it."
Llerandi noted that, "It hasn't been
a big problem except at outdoor par
ties. They're (high school students) a
bit squeamish about going inside."
Perhaps the worst result of the
traditional problem of high school
students at parties is the fact that
Stanford freshmen get accused
falsely.
Karla Tinklenberg, a freshman at
Stanford and a Paly alumna, faces a
unique situation. She said she runs
into her little sister, a junior at Paly,
at Stanford parties. "Although I dis
courage her, she persists in showing
up in a cluster of seven friends all
wearing Maybelline kissing slick. I
combat this problem by asking them
loudly. 'How's Paly?' "
Stanford students in general seem
to feel the same way as Romero. "It's
so stupid to say all these things be
cause I might do the same thing in
their position, but from the other side
I'd say wait until you're in college."

frequently at Stanford parties — stu
dents from Gunn and Palo Alto High
Schools. Stanford students say they
generally dislike the presence of high
schoolers at campus parties, and fra
ternity members here say they try to
discourage it.
But weekend after weekend their
cars cruise the campus. They face up
to the dirty looks and the sight of
many unknown people. The people at
Stanford and the lack of activity in
Palo Alto make this task worth it, the
young party-goers say.
"It's sort of exciting to meet new
faces. And there are so many gor
geous guys at Stanford! Oh my God
— I walk into a Stanford party and I
am in love with 20 different guys in
one minute," said Paly senior Liz
Smith. "Plus," she added, "you know
they're smart at the same time."
Many Stanford women do not view
the high school girls as competition,
hut rather as a source of irritation.
"Kick all people with purses out!"
said Stanford junior Kathy Romero.
"Parties are a function for the school,
and they aren't a part of it."
Mike IJerandi, president of the
Sigma Chi fraternity, agrees. "We
detest high school kids showing up at
our parties. You get random high
school people and not only does your
liability increase, but it detracts from
the party atmosphere because they
stick out like a sore thumb."
Smith said, "Most people are so
drunk they don't care. It is hard to
mix unless people are really ripped or
you have enough courage to intro
duce yourself to strangers. This year
fewer people are going because every
one knows how much Stanford hates
it."
Smith said Palo Alto can be dead,
adding that attending Stanford par
ties is better than watching reruns of
"The Love Boat." She also men
tioned that Stanford parties are better
for dancing than "cliquey" high
school parties.
"Everyone goes to Stanford parties

when they are bored of high school
social life," said Paly junior Karen
McDonald. "Most parents like to su
pervise parties and don't let their kids
serve alcohol. Kids are also afraid of
having their houses trashed. You don't
have any responsibility when you go
to a college party."
Both Smith and McDonald said
they get good grades and are active in
their school's student government.
McDonald described typical students
who attend Stanford parties as

'Oh my God — I walk into a Stanford
party and I am in love with 20 differ
ent guys in one minute.'

middle-of-the-road types. "Ex
tremely studious people wouldn't
care about parties and total flakes
kick their parents out of the house

and party all the time," she said.
McDonald said most of her friends
do lie about their age, but said she ad
mits to Stanford students that she is

15. "Sometimes students don't
believe that's my real age. I think I'm
interesting enough to talk to. I don't
have to be ashamed," she said.
Gunn students were much more
reluctant to admit they went to Stan
ford parties. Some completely denied
that any of their friends attend the
parties. Elise Estes, a Gunn senior,
attributed the higher percentage of
Paly students attending to their prox
imity to campus. Many Gunn stu
dents live as far away as Los Altos.

"We usually only go on Big Game
weekend," she said.
Romero said parties at the Univer
sity of California at Berkeley have
many outsiders ranging from high
school students to older citizens from
the community. Cal Theta Delt Brad
Kent said his fraternity receives many
more outsiders than kids.
The fraternities here seem to be
aware of the problem of responsibil
ity that high schoolers present.
Recently the Interfraternity Council
(IFC) issued a recommendation that
party-goers be checked for identifica
tion. Beta Theta Pi president. Dennis
Furlong, said, "We're going to be
watching at the door and asking
people who look like they're in high
school for Stanford IDs or key IDs.
We're planning to follow the IFC
guidelines."
Pete Gabriel, Sigma Alpha Epsilon
treasurer, was of the same opinion.
He said that they do not answer
anonymous phone calls about parties.
"The University has given us that re
sponsibility. It's up to us to police it."
Llerandi noted that, "It hasn't been
a big problem except at outdoor par
ties. They're (high school students) a
bit squeamish about going inside."
Perhaps the worst result of the
traditional problem of high school
students at parties is the fact that
Stanford freshmen get accused
falsely.
Karla Tinklenberg, a freshman at
Stanford and a Paly alumna, faces a
unique situation. She said she runs
into her little sister, a junior at Paly,
at Stanford parties. "Although I dis
courage her, she persists in showing
up in a cluster of seven friends all
wearing Maybelline kissing slick. I
combat this problem by asking them
loudly. 'How's Paly?' "
Stanford students in general seem
to feel the same way as Romero. "It's
so stupid to say all these things be
cause I might do the same thing in
their position, but from the other side
I'd say wait until you're in college."
