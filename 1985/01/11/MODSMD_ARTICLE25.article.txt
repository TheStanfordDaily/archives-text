## Devils too hot; Card loses by 15 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
Stanford Basketball Coach Tom
Davis walked into the interview room
after last night's 89-74 loss to
Arizona State University, sighed, and
said, "There's got to be better ways to
make a living."
The Cardinal coach had just
watched his team fall behind early,
catch up, fall behind again, catch up
again, and then fall behind one final
time. He watched Stanford shoot
45.9 percent from the floor and
Arizona State 60.4. He watched
Stanford shoot 62 percent from the
free throw line and Arizona State
83.8.
Davis, along with a crowd of 4,342
in Maples Pavilion, also watched the
bigger, stronger, quicker and more
talented Sun Devils hand Stanford its
first home loss and third-straight
Pacific 10 Conference setback. The
Cardinal is now 8-5 overall and still in
search of its first Pac-10 victory.
"I almost feel some sympathy for
this team because of what they're
trying to accomplish," Davis said.
"We're trying to speed up the learn
ing process, but I don't know if it's
quick enough.
"I don't want to say too much
about our problems — and they're
considerable — because it would
detract from Arizona State," he con
tinued. "They played a very fine bas
ketball game."
And they did from the very begin
ning. The Sun Devils, 6-6 overall and
1-1 in the Pac-10, scored 15 of the
game's first 21 points, thanks in large
part to the deadly outside shooting of
guard Bobby Thompson and Steve
Beck. Thompson and Beck wasted no
time exploiting a sagging Cardinal
zone defense from the outside and to
gether scored all but two of Arizona
State's first 19 points.
Thompson, who entered the game
shooting only 42 percent from the
floor, led all scorers with 27 points on
a 10-for-13 (76.9 percent) shooting
performance. Beck, who was only
shooting 43.9 percent, finished with
20 points.
"We were actually trying to
[extend the zone]," Davis said of the
Cardinal's efforts to stop the Sun
Devils' blistering outside shooting.

"We tried to be more aggressive and
[tried to] pick them up. But we couldn't
find them. They were just too quick
for us."
As poorly as Stanford played, it did
have one opportunity in each half to
get back in the game. In the first half,
the Cardinal cut the Sun Devils' lead
to 30-26 when Keith Ramee fed Scott
Meinert underneath for a lay-in with
two minutes, 48 seconds left. It was
Ramee's 282 nd career assist, making
him Stanford's all-time assist leader.
But it was also the end of the Car
dinal's comeback. Arizona State
proceeded to score 13 of the final 15
points of the half and take a 43-28
halftime advantage.
Midway through the second half,
Stanford made another charge at the
Sun Devils. Behind 63-48, the Card
inal ran off nine straight points,
capped by a three-point play by
Novian Whitsitt with 6:52 left. John
Paye then knocked the ensuing
Arizona State inbounds pass to Andy
Fischer.
"I thought it was a pretty good
shot," Fischer said of his 12-footer
from the right baseline. "We had
some momentum and I thought we
could take it to him. But the shot
was long and bounced off the back
rim. Then they did a good job putting
the game away."
It took the Sun Devils just 38
seconds to score seven unanswered
points and Stanford's comeback was
over as quickly as it began. The Car
dinal never got closer than 11 points
the rest of the way as Arizona State
hit 13 of 15 free throws down the
stretch. Vernon Johnson put the
finishing touches on the Sun Devil
victory with a two-hand slam duck off
a lob pass at the buzzer.
"It was rather important for us to
play with intensity for 40 minutes,"
Arizona State Coach Bob Wenihauer
said. "We played 39 minutes of full
intensity against the University of
Arizona but lost in the final 30
seconds. We did not want that to hap
pen again tonight."
Against Arizona, the Sun Devils
blew a seven-point lead with 34
seconds left and lost, 61-60. But each
time Stanford tried to mount similar

Freshman Scott Meinert was a bright spot in Stanford's loss to Arizona State. He
scored a team-high 17 points despite playing less than half the game. Meinert's
season has been hampered by a sprained ankle he suffered during the preseason.
comebacks, "We did not let down this
time," Weinhauer said.
About the only bright spot for
Stanford was the offensive play of
Meinert, a freshman guard who
missed most of the preseason with a
badly sprained left ankle. Meinert
made seven of 11 shots to lead the
Cardinal with 17 points, including 11
in the second half.
"He has outstanding poise," Davis
said of Meinert. "For him to come on
and progress like he has after that in
jury is a really positive sign."
Meinert, however, said his ankle is
not completely healed. "I still feel
like I'm about a half step behind, es
pecially on defense," he said, glanc
ing at the three ice packs encasing his
ankle. "It's just one of those things
that doesn't heal really fast."
Stanford will have to go for Pac-10
victory No. 1 against Arizona tomor
row afternoon. And as was the case
last night, the Cardinal will not be
able to afford another slow start.
"We're going to have to make
some (starting) lineup changes be

cause we're starting so slowly," Davis
said. "This is the third-straight game
we've struggled early."
