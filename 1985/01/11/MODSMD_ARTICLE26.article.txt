# 'Cats' program rebuilding well

### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
You might say someone upstairs is looking after the
University of Arizona basketball team, Stanford's op
ponent tomorrow afternoon at 3 in Maples Pavilion.
Picture this: Last Saturday, the Wildcats were be
hind, 60-53, to rival Arizona State University with 34
seconds left and in front of Arizona State's raucous
fans. And Arizona State guard Steve Beck, the Sun
Devils second-best free throw shooter last season, was
at the line.
Looks bad, huh? Somehow, someway, the Wildcats
managed to pull it out.
Beck and, later, teammate Bobby Thompson missed
free throws. Arizona forward Eddie Smith scored a
pair of three-point plays, and forward Pete Williams
added two free throws. Final score: 61-60. Arizona
had the 61.
This is the same Arizona team that was everyone's
pick to finish 10th in the Pacific 10 Conference last
season, before finishing fifth. The same team that was
4-24 in 1982-83 and 11-17 a year later.
"The foundation is laid," said Coach Lute Olson, the
man behind the turnaround at Arizona. "Now all we
have to do is establish credibility."
Arizona, 11-3 overall and 2-0 in the Pac-10, has
done just that this season. Just ask Bay Area teams San
Jose State University, which lost to the Wildcats, 79-
44, or San Francisco State University, which went
down 107-75. Or even the University of California at
Berkeley, which lost to them, 69-67, last night.
Although the Wildcats are easily the Pac-10's
shortest team, they are just as easily the league's fastest
one. The starting center is 6-foot-7 Pete Williams, the
Pac-10's leading rebounder last season, and the for
wards — Smith and Keith Jackson — are 6-7 and 6-5,
respectively.
At the beginning of the season, it appeared Arizona
would have the most depth at guard. But after point
guards Brock Brunkhorst and Michael Tait were
sidelined with injuries, off guard Steve Kerr was forced
to play the point. Kerr's backup, 6-6 Craig McMillan,
who almost attended Stanford, is now starting at the
other guard.
Card notes
Tomorrow's game will be televised on San Jose's
KSTS-TV (Channel 48).
The game will be the final of a seven-game road trip
for the Wildcats.
Last year, Stanford beat Arizona, 73-69, in Tucson,
but the Wildcats returned the favor at Maples Pavilion,
87-76.
