## Tough opposition of WCAA to begin 
### JOHN LIS Daily staff 
If you think it's tough playing
teams like Ohio State University and
Rutgers University, which are ranked
in the top 15, you haven't seen the
conference schedule the Stanford
women's basketball team is facing.
The Western Collegiate Athletic
Association is widely regarded as the

top league in the nation, and teams -
like Long Beach State University,
San Diego State University and
defending national champion Univer
sity of Southern California, all ranked
in the top 15, don't hurt that reputa
tion.
The Cardinal starts its conference
schedule tomorrow night at 7:30
against Fullerton State University at
Maples Pavilion. Stanford takes a 5-7
record into the game, with as many
wins as it compiled all of last season.
Stanford forward Mary Bradach is
aware of the challenge the conference
presents. "We know it's not going to
get any easier," she said.
Fullerton is an experienced team,
with five seniors expected to start. "If
we make a mistake, they'll turn it

against us," Cardinal guard Virginia
Sourlis said. "They're a tall team and
they play a tough, denying man-to
man defense. The Coaches are confi
dent that if we score 70 points, we'll
win.
"We'll have to drive and get good
shots," she continued. "It'll be tough
to get my shots. I'll probably look
more to drive.
"When anyone plays us man-to
man, it's a tough game. We'll have to
take what they're giving us."
And tomorrow night is just the
beginning. "We're confident that we
can play with some of the teams in
our conference," Bradach said. "We
set certain goals at the beginning ot
the year â€” one was to go .500 in the
conference. There's some hard com
petition. Hopefully, we'll win the
games we're supposed to and win
some that we're not supposed to.
Sourlis said. "Five-hundred is a
high goal. If we could surprise some
teams at home, if we catch them on
an off night, then anything goes.
Maybe next year, with some good
recruits in, we'll be able to beat
anyone."
This year's top recruit, forward
Kami Anderson, summed up the con
ference in one word: "Tough." She
elaborated. "It'll be an experience to
play against all of these top-rated
teams. It'll be interesting for me be
cause I'm new to it all."
Stanford goes into the game with
only nine players in uniform after
freshman center Barb Hunt slipped a
disk in her back this week. She will
miss two weeks and maybe the rest of
the season. Center Sarah Evans is
redshirting with a back injury, and
guard Leslie Crandell might miss six
weeks with Achilles' tendon prob
lems. To top things off, forward Sue
Sebolt is not fully recovered from a
sprained ankle.
