# Card teams in two swim meets
## 
### INGRID SEYER Staff sportswriter 
The top-ranked Stanford women * swimming
team will compete in its first dual meet ot this
season when it competes at San Jose State Uni
versity today at 3 p.m.
The women will be joined by the No. - -ranked
men's squad Sunday in the Stanford Relays,
which will begin at 11 a.m. in DeGuerre Pool.
According to Stanford women's Coach George
Haines, San Jose State has a somewhat limited
squad, although the Spartans field ;i few strong
swimmers in the butterfly and backstroke events.
"San Jose doesn't have very man\ exception
ally strong swimmers, but Angela Wester should
provide some stiff competition in the butterfly
events," Haines said. "Wester swam very well in
the NCAA (National Collegiate Athletic Associ
ation) championships last year and is expected to
be strong this year as well."
Five teams are expected to compete in the
Stanford Relays Sunday, including the University
of California at Berkeley, San Jose State, Fresno
State University, Colorado State University and

the University of the Pacific. The University of
Hawaii and Chico State University might also
compete.
Cal is expected to be the strongest competition
tor both the Cardinal men and women, according
to Haines and Stanford men's coach Skip Ken
ney.
"Cal should really present some tough compe
tition for us." Kenney said. "All of their relays
are strong, but their freestyle relays should be es
pecially fast. They field some great sprinters, in
cluding (Olympic medalist) Matt Biondi."
According to Kenney, the Stanford men
should swim well in the 200- and 400-yard med
ley relays and in the 400-yard butterfly relay. Be
cause the Cardinal must do well in the medley
relays in this year's NCAA meet in order to win
the national championship, Kenney will be fol
lowing these relays closely on Sunday.
"The relays can affect the eventual outcome of
the NCAAs. Consequently, each and every time
we swim them they are important to us," Kenney
said. "Dave Bottom, John Moffet and Pablo
Morales are all very consistent and experienced
swimmers in the medley relays."

According to Haines, Cal will most assuredly
he the strongest team in the women's relay com
petition. Cal will be entering at least 32 women
while the Cardinal will only have 18 women com
peting. , . t , .
"Cal is very strong in all ot its relays, both in
the sprints and in the distance events," Haines
said. "We will have some fast relays, including
our medley and backstroke teams.
Although the Stanford women are currently
ranked first in the NCAA coaches poll, second
ranked University of Florida and third-ranked
Universitv of Texas are expected to put pressure
on the Cardinal this year. Texas defeated Stan
ford. 392-324. in last year's NCAA champion
ships.
In the men's division of the coaches poll,
Florida was ranked first, followed by Stanford
and Texas. Stanford placed third in last years
NCAAs, following repeat champion Florida and
Texas.
"Stanford and Texas are going to be battling
for the No. 2 position for some time." Kenney
said.
