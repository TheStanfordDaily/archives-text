# Stanford men gymnasts opening home season
## Japanese back for rematch 
### DAVE DUTCHER Daily staff 
The Stanford men's gymnastics
team isn't saving the best for last.
The Cardinal will compete in
"one of the most exciting gymnas
tic competitions we'll have this
year," according to Coach Sadao
Hamada, Sunday beginning at 2
p.m. That's when Stanford will
play host to the seven-man
Japanese Junior National All-Star
team and San Jose State Univer
sity.
If last season's match between
Stanford and the Japanese is an in
dication, it could be as exciting as
Hamada expects. The Japanese
defeated Stanford, 268.90-
266.96, last year.
However, the Cardinal will have
to pick up slack left by the injury
to freshman Chuck Gerardo, who
fell off a pommel horse and suf
fered a hyperextended left elbow
while practicing this week.
Gerardo is questionable for Sun
day's meet, Hamada said. Gerardo
placed second in the all-around in
a recent meet in Colorado Springs,
Colo, against the Japanese while
competing for the U.S. Junior Na
tional team.
"It's more important to have
him later in the season than for the

Japan meet," Hamada said. "Not
having his score will definitely hurt
our team score."
Stanford, though, still has
All-American Jon Levy, a
junior, and sophomore Randy Be
sosa.
Levy took first in the horizontal
bar and the vault and was third in
the rings in the Spartan Open last
month en route to finishing second
in the all-around. Besosa was right
behind, in third, and was second in
the horizontal bars and pommel
horse.
"Besosa's going to be tough,"
Hamada said. " He's a stylish gym
nast. After working out last week,
he's looking pretty good."
Hamada also is expecting posi
tive results from junior Gary
Smith, who didn't compete in the
Spartan Open. "He had too much
to do academically and didn't
spend too much time in the gym,"
Hamada said.
The Japanese team will feature
Yoshikazu Nakamura, who
finished first in the 1984 Japanese
National Sports Festival. Second
place Takashi Chinen, who was
second to Nakamura, also is ex
pected to compete Sunday.
