# Senate allows non-Stanford media access
## 
### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Staff writer 
The 17th Faculty Senate voted yes
terday to allow outside media
coverage of its meetings, marking the
first such vote in senate history.
The senate approved on a divided
voice vote a proposal allowing up to
five off-campus press representatives
to attend its biweekly meetings.
In the past, only campus media
have been allowed access to senate
meetings. That is still the official sen
ate rule; yesterday's vote will change
senate policy only through May 1985.
The proposal gives preference to
local newspapers and continues the
restriction on the use of cameras
without prior approval from the chair
and the senate.
The senate also discussed repercus
sions of holding the Super Bowl at
Stanford. Faculty members expressed
concern about future external sport
ing events being held in Stanford
Stadium and the increasing difficulty
in parking and mobility around
campus as Super Bowl Sunday ap
proaches.
Questions were also raised about
the distribution of the 1,500 Super
Bowl tickets allocated to the Univer
sity. Only 200 tickets were given to
faculty, students and staff.
The Office of the Vice Provost for
Academic Computing and Informa
tion Systems (ACIS) also updated the
senate on its continuing goal to ad
vance the computing tools at the Uni
versity and to integrate computers
into all areas of instruction and re
search.
The Senate Steering Committee
unanimously recommended the
resolution on media coverage of the
senate meetings. Communication
Prof. Bite A be/, the initiator of the
proposal, argued that Stanford's
policy was inconsistent with other
similar institutions and that one
"cannot assume that professional
journalists will do less well" than the
campus media currently allowed ad
mission. Abel said that although The
Stanford Daily accurately covers the
meetings, a single source is "not the
same as opening the door to all."
He also quoted a letter he received
from Michael Kidder, editor of the
Times Tribune, stating that the pro
posal would "enhance public under
standing of Stanford. . . . We support a
general policy of open meetings."
Opposition to the proposal cen
tered around similar concerns to
those mentioned in November 1983,
when a similar proposal was defeated
by the senate, 22-17. According to
Craig Heller, 16th Senate chairman,
last year's senate was afraid that off
campus representatives might inter
fere with the senate's "free and open
atmosphere."
Faculty members expressed possi
ble reluctance to brainstorming and
speaking freely with so many
reporters present. Rex Jamison, pro
fessor of medicine, told the senate he
was afraid he might not say what was
truly on his mind if "reporters are
going to be transmitting my remarks
all over Northern California."
Concern was also raised over the
infrequent attendance of the

reporters. History Prof. Carl Degler
argued that when the reporters chose
to attend, there would be "a change
in atmosphere and equipment . . . he
cause it will be a thing of public inter
est."
Another opposition to the resolu
tion was raised by English Prof. John
Bender, who said he saw no reason to
change the current policy except out
of admiration for Abel. Bender, who
opposed the measure last time,
believed there was "considerable in
difference" to the measure.

Ray Bacchetti, vice-provost for
management and director of Univer
sity budgets, responded to Jamison's
concerns by expressing the necessity
to learn how to speak under pressure.
The presence of the press should be
looked upon as a "benefit," Bacchetti
said, as it will encourage senate mem
bers "to keep things in context and
stick to the point." It will enable the
senate to "get business done and get
it done well."
University President Donald Ken
nedy assured the senate that he would
be just as candid about matters, espe
cially those concerning the board of
trustees, if off-campus press repre
sentatives were present.
"I conduct my business on the as
sumption that somebody lives inside
my file drawers. 1 once worked for
the government of the U.S., where it
happened to be true," Kennedy said.
The proposal was initially in
stigated by a request from the Palo
Alto Weekly in 1983 to cover senate
meetings. The San Jose Mercury
News made a similar request last fall,
and the steering committee recom
mended no change in policy at the
time but agreed to discuss the issue
with Abel, a Pulitzer Prize-winning
journalist, after he requested the
restriction be lifted.
The current proposal requires at
least 48-hours advance notice from
any newspaper requesting to occupy a
seat. If the senate goes into executive
session, "only senate members and
special guests as defined by the chair
will remain." The steering committee
is expected to approve a set of
guidelines Jan. 16 establishing stan
dard pooling procedures in situations
where more than five reporters re
quest seats.
