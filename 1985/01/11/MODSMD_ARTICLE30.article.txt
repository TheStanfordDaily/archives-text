### ERIK ESELIUS Staff sportswriter 
The Cardinal men's and women's
fencing teams, both 3-0, will try to
complete a two-match sweep of the
University of California at Santa Cruz
tomorrow in Roble Gym.
Earlier in the season at Santa Cruz,
the men's team, ranked ninth in the
nation, won 14-13. Meanwhile, the
eighth-ranked women's team came
away with a 10-6 victory.
Santa Cruz competes at the club
level, and. according to Stanford
Head Coach Buzz Hurst, that enables
it to field a more experienced roster
since they do not have to follow the
National Collegiate Athletic Associa
tion's four-year eligibility rule.
"They have graduate students who
have a lot of experience fencing,"
Hurst said. "We will have to rely on
guts."
Hurst expects another difficult
match for the Cardinal men, espe
cially in the epee and foil, events
Santa Cruz is strong in.
"They are a very strong team, one
of our most challenging opponents,"
Hurst said. "They are particularly
good in epee, second to that is their
foil. Their saber team is led by a guy
who finished sixth in a major national
tournament."
Though predicting a tough match
for the men. Hurst believes the Car

dinal women will do better the second
time around.
"We should beat them again and
expand upon the score." Hurst said.
"They're a well-coached team,
though. We don't take them for
granted at all."
Once again, the Stanford women,
who only compete in the foil competi
tion, will be led by Jennifer Yu. who
has compiled a 12-0 record.
Captains Elliot Chu, 11-2 in the foil,
and Andy Goorno, 10-1 in saber, will
lead the Cardinal men's attack. Hurst
said.
Hurst was pleased by the increasing
numbers on both the Cardinal men's
and women's teams.
"We have a more talented team
this year," Hurst said. "The people
not starting have previous fencing ex
perience."
Recently, the Cardinal fencing
teams won four gold medals and one
bronze in the Junior Olympic
divisional qualifing championship.
The Cardinal women won two golds
in the foil event, and the Stanford
men clinched a gold in both the saber
and the epee and a bronze in the foil
competition.
The Cardinal medalists qualified
for the National Junior Olympics,
which will be held next month in
Cleveland, Ohio.
