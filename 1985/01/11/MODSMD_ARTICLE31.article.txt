# Injuries keeping some home
## Card wrestlers to oppose 7 other squads at invite 
### PETER CASTILLO Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford wrestling team's hectic schedule of seven
meets in 11 days has taken its toll.
It's possible only five starters will make the trip to Biola
University in La Mirada, which is outside of Los Angeles,
for the Eagle Invitational this Saturday. Eight teams will
compete, including San Jose State University, Chico State
University and San Francisco State University .
"This tournament is not as strong as the others and,
healthy, we could win it," Stanford Coach Chris Horpel
said. "We are not going for a team victory as much as to
give some of the wrestlers a chance to compete and to
keep people continually improving."
The flu bug has hit the team as Jeff Bradley (134
pounds) and Tom Mullen (177 pounds) will take the
weekend off to rest. Dave Lee (167 pounds) will also take
the weekend off to rest, and Kurt Kassulke (190 pounds)
and heavyweight Frank Lyles are questionable with minor
injuries. Kassulke suffered a cut over his eye at practice
Wednesday, and Lyles has a sprained ankle.

Coach Horpel said this tournament will be a good ex
perience for team members who usually don't wrestle. It
will give them experience that could be valuable if a first
stringer is unable to wrestle.
However, there will be some starters going to Biola
University. They are B.G. Porter (118 pounds), Neil
Wartnik (126 pounds), Scott Wiggen (150 pounds) and
Pete -Rogers (158 pounds). For Wartnik, a junior, this
tournament could be a confidence-builder since he has
suffered tough defeats in his last three dual meets, includ
ing a 10-8 loss Tuesday night against the University of
Oregon.
Rogers, another junior, has done well in National Col
legiate Athletic Association-caliber competitions â€” he
nearly placed in the Caesar's Palace Invitational in mid-
December and he took fourth in the Doc Peterson Invita
tional Saturday. In his last three dual meets. Rogers had
victories against Oregon State University and Oregon and
a tie against Portland State University.
