A Streetcar Named Desire (1951)
Kresge Auditorium
"They told me to take a streetcar
named Desire and get off at the
Elysian Fields . . ." Thus begins the
role of Blanche Dußois, the greatest
character an American playwright has
ever written for an actress — played in
Elia Kazan's peerless film version by
the woman born to play her, Vivien
Leigh. Marlon Brando repeats the role
he originated in Kazan's 1947 stage
production: Stanley Kowalski, the ad
versary who eventually destroys
Blanche. This trio (Leigh, Brando and
Kazan) bring to Tennessee Williams'
monumental play — which is, along
with O'Neill's "Long Day's Journey
into Night," at the very apex of Ameri
can drama — all the clarity, power and
poetry it demands. Except for a hand
ful of lines excised to satisfy the Hays
Code enforcers (purists will miss the
last moment of the play), the film is
without a flaw, really; even Karl Mai
den (as Mitch) is better than could
have been expected, and Kim Hunter
(as Stella, Blanche's sister and Stan
ley's wife) is very good indeed.
(Maiden and Hunter had been in the
original cast along with Brando.)
Photographed by Harry Stradling;
Alex North wrote the famous musical
score.
Plays tonight at 9.
Purple Rain (1984)
Memorial Auditorium
The rock singer Prince has a bizarre
seductiveness: With the full head of
black curls of a proud, spoiled young
ster in an 18th-century family portrait,
a wardrobe filched from a historical
costume shop for androgynes, and just
the shadow of a moustache, he's like a
sexy child. A shy, melting smile tells us
that he's all warmth and vulnerability
underneath those grown-up ballroom
digs, but then he shifts into the con
temptuous smirk of a teenager who
knows he's gotten away with murder,
and the potent soft intensity of his gaze
grows dangerous. His numbers are the
obvious reason to watch what is actu
ally a very dumb movie; Prince could
be a fascinating movie actor, but his
role consists almost entirely of emo

tional frttcnes, and he needs a better
director than Albert Magnoli. And the
story couldn't Be much more basic —
Or unoriginal: A tough young singer
from an unhappy home abuses his
friends, mistreat# the woman who
loves him, but tragedy causes him to
reassess his life and come to the con
clusion that nice is better, Apollonia
Kotero co-stars; her talent, if any, is
not conspicuous here.
Plays tonight at 7 and 9:30.
La Strada (1956)
Cubberley Auditorium ®
Federico Fellini's most honored and
beloved movie. The title means "the
road," arid the story deals, superfi
cially, with the relationship between a
traveling strong man, Zampano
(Anthony Quinn) and a waif he adopts
and brutalizes (Giuilietta Masina). The
third character in this fable about the
interplay between brute force and in
nocence, body and soul, is an acrobat
(that fine, underrated actor, Richard
Basehart) — a fool who is also an art
ist. Quinn has never been better
(except perhaps in "Requiem for a
Heavyweight") and Masina gives a
heartbreaking performance — prob
ably inspired by Lillian Gish in Grif
fith's "Brpfcen Blossoms." The film
represents, along with the following
year's "Nights of Cabiria," the peak of
Fellings powers as a director, before
he began to sacrifice real sensitivity for
the patented, self-adoring kind that
would corrupt his later films. Be
forewarned: The final image is a
remarkably pure expression of despair
that you won't be able to shake oil'
when you leave the theater.
Plays Tuesday evening at 8.
Gandhi (1982)
Geology 320 (tonight); Krege

Auditorium (tomorrow) Jt'£a£sßfl
A three-and-u-quarter-hour
soporific. Richard Altenborough
doesn't have the right qualities for epic
filmmaking; furthermore, out of either
a lack of personal resources or an as
cetic refusal to vulgarize Gandhi's
story, he resists turning it into theater.
And in the process of purifying it of
historical lumps, he has buried much
essential factual information and ob
fuscated the issues. Ben Kingsiey
brings a fascinating mixture of under-^v,'
stated passion and unpredictable wit to *S
the title role — he humanizes the icon
John Britey's homilctic screenplay sets
up — but the rest of the cast (John
Gielgud. Edward Fox, Trevor
Howard, Martin Sheen, Candice Ber

John Mills, etc., etc.) is just expensive
dressing.
Plays tonight and tomorrow at 7:30.
Straight l ime (1978
Roxie, San Francisco
This modest study of convict men
tality —• of that restlessness with
"straight" society that is one of the
major causes ot recidivism — has
patches of solid, unsentimental writing
(Alvin Sargent was among, the
screenwriters) and some of 1 the scenes
have a fine documentary feefing,
though the film is perhaps too modest
and there is a puzzling switch in tone
after the first half hour. As Max
Dembo, the thief, Dustifl Hoffman
gives one of his two or three best per
formances. Max's eyes take in every
thing — they are his thief s requisite
equipment — and they betray all he is
feeling: fear, discomfort, distrust,
anger, desperation. Hoffman refuses
to cheat and make Max appealing in
any way; it's an uncompromising piece
of acting. There are also memorable
performances by Gary Busey and

Harry Dean Stanton. Directed by Ulu
Grosbard. 112
Plays Sunday with "The Long Good jL
Friday" and "Hair."
The Story of Adele H. (1975)
New Varsity, |alq Afto
FrancoiS Truffaufs Do#evskian
account of a woman whose passion for
a young man i| every w ay beneath her
transcends the paltriness of the affair
itself and becomes its own raison
d'etre. Adele (Tsabelle Adjani, in a
great peiformance) is the daughter of
*%3fc Ctor Hugo, and her insistence on
faking up *jth a young English
lieutenant §s fteant on one level as a
slap in her fathe|'s,££lebrated fage; the
irony that escapes her is that she ends
up concocting' a romantic fiction
worthy of her father's pen. Too few
people have seen this film, which is
Truffaut's best after "Jules and Jim.' s
Jt has a phenomenal screenplay, which
Truffaut co-authored with Suzanne
Schiffman and Jean Gruault, and some
of the best work Nestor Almendros,
the cinematographer, has ever done.
Plays Wednesday and Thursday with
"Small Change."
Roxie, San Francisco
' A modest picture, but offbeat and
consistently intelligent. Harold Shand
(Bob Hoskiis, creating a very specific
character with great'skill) has thrust
himself up from his slum roots to cap
tain the biggest gangster-run network
in London. Having eliminated or
cowed all rivals, he is about to clinch
the most ambitious deal of his career, a
transatlantic corporation that will ally
him with the American Mafia. But just
as his American connection arrives,
Shand's associates are killed off, one
by one, and his property destroyed by

an unknown enemy. (It's "The God
father'' in reverse, and played
„comically.) John Mackenzie, the direc
tor, has a quiet style that seems off
band at first; then the small, jagged
bits of Barrie Keeffe's script slide
swiftly into place, and you realize how
fca re fully the film has been crafted.
They depict Shand as a sort of hood
lum Winston Churchill and send up
British stick-to-itiveness; the movie
ends up as a cruel insider s view of En
gland on the wane. Helen Mirren and
Dave King are terrific as, respectively,
Shand's girlfriend and his top contact
on the police force.
Plays Sunday with "Straight Time"
and*' Hair."
Intruder in the Dust (1949)
Castro Theatre, San Francisco
ft is generally believed that William
Faulkner wrote nothing first-rate after
the war, and that no filmmaker has
ever been able to get him onto the
screen. Both assumptions are false.
Clarence Brown made this near-great
(and virtually unknown) film of
Faulkner's trenchant late novel about
the relationship between a white boy
(Claude Jarman, Jr., whom Brown had
directed in "The Yearling") and a
black man in a small Southern town.
The magnificent actor Juano Hernan
dez plays Lucas Beauchamp, who in
curs the hatred of some of his white
neighbors because he refuses to play
"nigger" for them. Two generally un
distinguished character actors, Porter
Hall and Elizabeth Patterson, give im
aginative supporting performances,
partly due to Brown's sensitivity and
partly due to the beautiful roles Ben
Maddow carved out of the novel.
Photographed superbly in black and
white by Robert Surtees, who died
earlier this week. (The best part of
Harper Lee's "To Kill a Mockingbird"

are probably inspired by this novel
and/or this film.)
Plays Monday with "Fury."
Woman of the Year (1942)
Festival. Palo Alto
The first screen meeting of Katha
rine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, and
you can see instantly why they become
such a beloved couple. The delight one
takes in their parry and thrust may ex
plain why movie buffs tend to remem
ber only the good parts of this picture
and forget the contrived working out
of the story (which casts Hepburn as a
political columnist and Tracy as a
sportswriter on the same paper) and
the infuriating way in which he — with
the help of a male director, George
Cukor. and two male screenwriters.
Ring Lardner Jr. and Michael Kanin
— succeeds in putting her down.
Plays through Wednesday with
"Holiday."
Out of the Past (1947)
Cedar Cinema, San Francisco
This tawdry little film noir has ac
quired a considerable reputation in the
past 10 or 15 years, along with its
director, Jacques Tourneur, but the
best one can say about it is that it
keeps one reasonably entertained (and
that it is infinitely better than its
remake, "Against All Odds"). Robert
Mitchum and Kirk Douglas are the
tough guys who get mixed up with the
mandatory femme fatale (Jane Greer,
who is what used to be called a dish).
Virginia Huston is Mitchum's boring
small-town girlfriend to whom — for
reasons not explained in the film — he
remains devoted, even while he falls
prey to Greer's charms. Rhonda
Fleming shows up, too. Aside from
Mitchum and Douglas, the men in the
cast are a dreary bunch; they even look
alike. Geoffrey Homes adapted his
own novel ("Hang the Gallows
High"); Nicholas Musuraca
photographed.
Plays Sunday and Monday with
"Nightfall."

Woman of the Year (1942)

The first screen meeting of Katha

such a beloved couple. The delight one

plain why movie buffs tend to remem
ber only the good parts of this picture
and forget the contrived working out

Out of the Past (1947)
Cedar Cinema, San Francisco
This tawdry little film noir has ac
quired a considerable reputation in the
past 10 or 15 years, along with its
director, Jacques Tourneur, but the
best one can say about it is that it
keeps one reasonably entertained (and
that it is infinitely better than its
remake, "Against All Odds"). Robert
Mitchum and Kirk Douglas are the
tough guys who get mixed up with the
mandatory femme fatale (Jane Greer,
who is what used to be called a dish).
Virginia Huston is Mitchum's boring
small-town girlfriend to whom — for
reasons not explained in the film — he
remains devoted, even while he falls
prey to Greer's charms. Rhonda
Fleming shows up, too. Aside from
Mitchum and Douglas, the men in the
cast are a dreary bunch; they even look
alike. Geoffrey Homes adapted his
own novel ("Hang the Gallows
High"); Nicholas Musuraca
photographed.
Plays Sunday and Monday with
"Nightfall."
A Streetcar Named Desire (1951)
Kresge Auditorium
"They told me to take a streetcar
named Desire and get off at the
Elysian Fields . . ." Thus begins the
role of Blanche Dußois, the greatest
character an American playwright has
ever written for an actress — played in
Elia Kazan's peerless film version by
the woman born to play her, Vivien
Leigh. Marlon Brando repeats the role
he originated in Kazan's 1947 stage
production: Stanley Kowalski, the ad
versary who eventually destroys
Blanche. This trio (Leigh, Brando and
Kazan) bring to Tennessee Williams'
monumental play — which is, along
with O'Neill's "Long Day's Journey
into Night," at the very apex of Ameri
can drama — all the clarity, power and
poetry it demands. Except for a hand
ful of lines excised to satisfy the Hays
Code enforcers (purists will miss the
last moment of the play), the film is
without a flaw, really; even Karl Mai
den (as Mitch) is better than could
have been expected, and Kim Hunter
(as Stella, Blanche's sister and Stan
ley's wife) is very good indeed.
(Maiden and Hunter had been in the
original cast along with Brando.)
Photographed by Harry Stradling;
Alex North wrote the famous musical
score.
Plays tonight at 9.
Purple Rain (1984)
Memorial Auditorium
The rock singer Prince has a bizarre
seductiveness: With the full head of
black curls of a proud, spoiled young
ster in an 18th-century family portrait,
a wardrobe filched from a historical
costume shop for androgynes, and just
the shadow of a moustache, he's like a
sexy child. A shy, melting smile tells us
that he's all warmth and vulnerability
underneath those grown-up ballroom
digs, but then he shifts into the con
temptuous smirk of a teenager who
knows he's gotten away with murder,
and the potent soft intensity of his gaze
grows dangerous. His numbers are the
obvious reason to watch what is actu
ally a very dumb movie; Prince could
be a fascinating movie actor, but his
role consists almost entirely of emo

tional frttcnes, and he needs a better
director than Albert Magnoli. And the
story couldn't Be much more basic —
Or unoriginal: A tough young singer
from an unhappy home abuses his
friends, mistreat# the woman who
loves him, but tragedy causes him to
reassess his life and come to the con
clusion that nice is better, Apollonia
Kotero co-stars; her talent, if any, is
not conspicuous here.
Plays tonight at 7 and 9:30.
La Strada (1956)
Cubberley Auditorium ®
Federico Fellini's most honored and
beloved movie. The title means "the
road," arid the story deals, superfi
cially, with the relationship between a
traveling strong man, Zampano
(Anthony Quinn) and a waif he adopts
and brutalizes (Giuilietta Masina). The
third character in this fable about the
interplay between brute force and in
nocence, body and soul, is an acrobat
(that fine, underrated actor, Richard
Basehart) — a fool who is also an art
ist. Quinn has never been better
(except perhaps in "Requiem for a
Heavyweight") and Masina gives a
heartbreaking performance — prob
ably inspired by Lillian Gish in Grif
fith's "Brpfcen Blossoms." The film
represents, along with the following
year's "Nights of Cabiria," the peak of
Fellings powers as a director, before
he began to sacrifice real sensitivity for
the patented, self-adoring kind that
would corrupt his later films. Be
forewarned: The final image is a
remarkably pure expression of despair
that you won't be able to shake oil'
when you leave the theater.
Plays Tuesday evening at 8.

Straight l ime (1978
Roxie, San Francisco
This modest study of convict men

"straight" society that is one of the
major causes ot recidivism — has
patches of solid, unsentimental writing
(Alvin Sargent was among, the
screenwriters) and some of 1 the scenes

though the film is perhaps too modest
and there is a puzzling switch in tone
after the first half hour. As Max
Dembo, the thief, Dustifl Hoffman
gives one of his two or three best per
formances. Max's eyes take in every
thing — they are his thief s requisite
equipment — and they betray all he is
feeling: fear, discomfort, distrust,

to cheat and make Max appealing in
any way; it's an uncompromising piece
of acting. There are also memorable

' A modest picture, but offbeat and
consistently intelligent. Harold Shand
(Bob Hoskiis, creating a very specific
character with great'skill) has thrust
himself up from his slum roots to cap
tain the biggest gangster-run network
in London. Having eliminated or
cowed all rivals, he is about to clinch
the most ambitious deal of his career, a
transatlantic corporation that will ally
him with the American Mafia. But just
as his American connection arrives,
Shand's associates are killed off, one

an unknown enemy. (It's "The God

bits of Barrie Keeffe's script slide
swiftly into place, and you realize how

Intruder in the Dust (1949)
Castro Theatre, San Francisco
ft is generally believed that William
Faulkner wrote nothing first-rate after
the war, and that no filmmaker has
ever been able to get him onto the
screen. Both assumptions are false.
Clarence Brown made this near-great
(and virtually unknown) film of
Faulkner's trenchant late novel about
the relationship between a white boy
(Claude Jarman, Jr., whom Brown had
directed in "The Yearling") and a
black man in a small Southern town.
The magnificent actor Juano Hernan

curs the hatred of some of his white
neighbors because he refuses to play

consistently intelligent. Harold Shand
(Bob Hoskiis, creating a very specific
character with great'skill) has thrust
himself up from his slum roots to cap
tain the biggest gangster-run network
in London. Having eliminated or
cowed all rivals, he is about to clinch
the most ambitious deal of his career, a
transatlantic corporation that will ally
him with the American Mafia. But just
as his American connection arrives,
Shand's associates are killed off, one
by one, and his property destroyed by

an unknown enemy. (It's "The God
father'' in reverse, and played
„comically.) John Mackenzie, the direc
tor, has a quiet style that seems off
band at first; then the small, jagged
bits of Barrie Keeffe's script slide
swiftly into place, and you realize how
fca re fully the film has been crafted.
They depict Shand as a sort of hood
lum Winston Churchill and send up
British stick-to-itiveness; the movie
ends up as a cruel insider s view of En
gland on the wane. Helen Mirren and
Dave King are terrific as, respectively,
Shand's girlfriend and his top contact
on the police force.
Plays Sunday with "Straight Time"

Intruder in the Dust (1949)
Castro Theatre, San Francisco
ft is generally believed that William
Faulkner wrote nothing first-rate after
the war, and that no filmmaker has
ever been able to get him onto the
screen. Both assumptions are false.
Clarence Brown made this near-great
(and virtually unknown) film of
Faulkner's trenchant late novel about
the relationship between a white boy
(Claude Jarman, Jr., whom Brown had
directed in "The Yearling") and a
black man in a small Southern town.
The magnificent actor Juano Hernan
dez plays Lucas Beauchamp, who in
curs the hatred of some of his white
neighbors because he refuses to play
"nigger" for them. Two generally un
distinguished character actors, Porter
Hall and Elizabeth Patterson, give im
aginative supporting performances,
partly due to Brown's sensitivity and
partly due to the beautiful roles Ben
Maddow carved out of the novel.
Photographed superbly in black and
white by Robert Surtees, who died
earlier this week. (The best part of
Harper Lee's "To Kill a Mockingbird"

are probably inspired by this novel
and/or this film.)
Plays Monday with "Fury."

Out of the Past (1947)
Cedar Cinema, San Francisco
This tawdry little film noir has ac
quired a considerable reputation in the
past 10 or 15 years, along with its
director, Jacques Tourneur, but the
best one can say about it is that it
keeps one reasonably entertained (and
that it is infinitely better than its
remake, "Against All Odds"). Robert
Mitchum and Kirk Douglas are the
tough guys who get mixed up with the
mandatory femme fatale (Jane Greer,
who is what used to be called a dish).
Virginia Huston is Mitchum's boring
small-town girlfriend to whom — for
reasons not explained in the film — he
remains devoted, even while he falls
prey to Greer's charms. Rhonda
Fleming shows up, too. Aside from
Mitchum and Douglas, the men in the
cast are a dreary bunch; they even look
alike. Geoffrey Homes adapted his
own novel ("Hang the Gallows
High"); Nicholas Musuraca
photographed.
Plays Sunday and Monday with
"Nightfall."
A Streetcar Named Desire (1951)
Kresge Auditorium
"They told me to take a streetcar
named Desire and get off at the
Elysian Fields . . ." Thus begins the
role of Blanche Dußois, the greatest
character an American playwright has
ever written for an actress — played in
Elia Kazan's peerless film version by
the woman born to play her, Vivien
Leigh. Marlon Brando repeats the role
he originated in Kazan's 1947 stage
production: Stanley Kowalski, the ad
versary who eventually destroys
Blanche. This trio (Leigh, Brando and
Kazan) bring to Tennessee Williams'
monumental play — which is, along
with O'Neill's "Long Day's Journey
into Night," at the very apex of Ameri
can drama — all the clarity, power and
poetry it demands. Except for a hand
ful of lines excised to satisfy the Hays
Code enforcers (purists will miss the
last moment of the play), the film is
without a flaw, really; even Karl Mai
den (as Mitch) is better than could
have been expected, and Kim Hunter
(as Stella, Blanche's sister and Stan
ley's wife) is very good indeed.
(Maiden and Hunter had been in the
original cast along with Brando.)
Photographed by Harry Stradling;
Alex North wrote the famous musical
score.
Plays tonight at 9.
Purple Rain (1984)
Memorial Auditorium
The rock singer Prince has a bizarre
seductiveness: With the full head of
black curls of a proud, spoiled young
ster in an 18th-century family portrait,
a wardrobe filched from a historical
costume shop for androgynes, and just
the shadow of a moustache, he's like a
sexy child. A shy, melting smile tells us
that he's all warmth and vulnerability
underneath those grown-up ballroom
digs, but then he shifts into the con
temptuous smirk of a teenager who
knows he's gotten away with murder,
and the potent soft intensity of his gaze
grows dangerous. His numbers are the
obvious reason to watch what is actu
ally a very dumb movie; Prince could
be a fascinating movie actor, but his
role consists almost entirely of emo

tional frttcnes, and he needs a better
director than Albert Magnoli. And the
story couldn't Be much more basic —
Or unoriginal: A tough young singer
from an unhappy home abuses his
friends, mistreat# the woman who
loves him, but tragedy causes him to
reassess his life and come to the con
clusion that nice is better, Apollonia
Kotero co-stars; her talent, if any, is
not conspicuous here.
Plays tonight at 7 and 9:30.
La Strada (1956)
Cubberley Auditorium ®
Federico Fellini's most honored and
beloved movie. The title means "the
road," arid the story deals, superfi
cially, with the relationship between a
traveling strong man, Zampano
(Anthony Quinn) and a waif he adopts
and brutalizes (Giuilietta Masina). The
third character in this fable about the
interplay between brute force and in
nocence, body and soul, is an acrobat
(that fine, underrated actor, Richard
Basehart) — a fool who is also an art
ist. Quinn has never been better
(except perhaps in "Requiem for a
Heavyweight") and Masina gives a
heartbreaking performance — prob
ably inspired by Lillian Gish in Grif
fith's "Brpfcen Blossoms." The film
represents, along with the following
year's "Nights of Cabiria," the peak of
Fellings powers as a director, before
he began to sacrifice real sensitivity for
the patented, self-adoring kind that
would corrupt his later films. Be
forewarned: The final image is a
remarkably pure expression of despair
that you won't be able to shake oil'
when you leave the theater.
Plays Tuesday evening at 8.
Gandhi (1982)
Geology 320 (tonight); Krege

Auditorium (tomorrow) Jt'£a£sßfl
A three-and-u-quarter-hour
soporific. Richard Altenborough
doesn't have the right qualities for epic
filmmaking; furthermore, out of either
a lack of personal resources or an as
cetic refusal to vulgarize Gandhi's
story, he resists turning it into theater.
And in the process of purifying it of
historical lumps, he has buried much
essential factual information and ob
fuscated the issues. Ben Kingsiey
brings a fascinating mixture of under-^v,'
stated passion and unpredictable wit to *S
the title role — he humanizes the icon
John Britey's homilctic screenplay sets
up — but the rest of the cast (John
Gielgud. Edward Fox, Trevor
Howard, Martin Sheen, Candice Ber

John Mills, etc., etc.) is just expensive
dressing.

Straight l ime (1978
Roxie, San Francisco
This modest study of convict men
tality —• of that restlessness with
"straight" society that is one of the
major causes ot recidivism — has
patches of solid, unsentimental writing
(Alvin Sargent was among, the
screenwriters) and some of 1 the scenes
have a fine documentary feefing,
though the film is perhaps too modest
and there is a puzzling switch in tone
after the first half hour. As Max
Dembo, the thief, Dustifl Hoffman
gives one of his two or three best per
formances. Max's eyes take in every
thing — they are his thief s requisite
equipment — and they betray all he is
feeling: fear, discomfort, distrust,
anger, desperation. Hoffman refuses
to cheat and make Max appealing in
any way; it's an uncompromising piece
of acting. There are also memorable
performances by Gary Busey and

Harry Dean Stanton. Directed by Ulu
