A class act
For his work in the news office fall
quarter, Troy Eid is the official
recipient of The Daily's semiannual
Pia Zadora Award. The award is

given in honor of Zadora, who played
the stage role of Anne Frank so
poorly that when the Nazis arrived,
an irate audience shouted, "She's
upstairs."
