# Two former Stanford students receive Rhodes scholarships
## 
### LYNDA JOHNSON-TATE 
Recent Stanford graduates Jeffrey Rideout
and Meredith Wadman, who now both attend
medical school, have been awarded 1985
Rhodes scholarships.
The Rhodes scholarship provides fees and
living expenses for two years of study at Ox
ford University in England. It is awarded to
students between the ages of 18 and 24 who
show a sense of community responsibility and
who demonstrate strong academic, leadership
and physical abilities.
Rideout, now in his second year at Harvard
Medical School, studied biological sciences at
Stanford and graduated in 1983. Rideout said
his interest in the ethical decisions involving
medical care may have been part of the rea
son he was selected by the Rhodes committee.

He cited the recent public attention given to
Baby Fae and patients who have received
heart implants. <
Rideout said Baby Fae's treatment was sur
rounded by ethical issues because of the great
sums of money spent to keep her alive. "You
have to think that every time you spend one
dollar, you are using money that might be bet
ter spent by affecting more people." he said.
Rideout applied to Magdalen College at
Oxford University with plans to study politics,
philosophy and economics. When he returns
to the United States, he intends to finish
medical school and then practice clinical
medicine. Rideout also said he might use his
experiences at Oxford and as a doctor to
teach or to explore bureaucratic public policy.
Wadman. who earned a bachelor's degree

in human biology here in 1982, is currently in
her second year at the University of British
Columbia's medical school. She said her
travel experience, especially her visits to
Africa to work with Operation Crossroads,
may have been a contributing factor to her
success in the Rhodes competition.
Wadman also applied to Magdalen College
at Oxford University and plans to study clini
cal medicine with a focus on tropical
medicine. She called Oxford a "terrific
launching pad for the field. - '
Wadman noted that the British approach to
medicine is quite different from the Ameri
can. and she said she hopes her experience in
England will prove helpful to her future work.
She explained that "they rely more on using
observation skills in a bedside diagnosis than

on technical equipment."
Although the Rhodes scholarship was
founded in 1902, it has been available to
women only since 1976. Wadman said she
was pleased to have won the scholarship, add
ing, "I was especially excited because I think
more women need to see women doing
things."
When she has finished her schooling, Wad
man hopes to "be in a place where there is a
crying need" for medical attention. Because
tropical medicine is her main area of interest,
Wadman suggested that she might work in
Asia. Africa or wherever there is a need for
"public health services in underserved com
munities."
The Rhodes scholarships were established
in 1902 upon the death of Cecil J. Rhodes, a

British businessman who made his fortune in
the gold and diamond mines in Africa. When
he died, the greater portion of his fortune was
put into scholarship funds.
The award has since become quite pres
tigious and highly competitive. This year
United States committees evaluated 1,150
applications for 32 positions. Harvard boasts
four winners, the most from any one school.
Despite the inherently competitive nature
of the scholaship. Rideout said the committee
as well as his fellow applicants were friendly.
"1 was impressed with all of the applicants,
and 1 learned to appreciate the others," he
said. "I actually felt sad. You meet nice
people and you tend to pull for each other.
But of course you always hope that you will
win."
