Reagan faces opposition in House
WASHINGTON — Majority Leader James Wright (D-Texas) said
yesterday that the House will not go along with any effort to freeze So
cial Security cost-of-living adjustments for a year to help reduce the
federal deficit.
President Reagan said at a news conference Wednesday night that he
might consider a one-year deferral of Social Security cost-of-living ad
justments (COLAs) if "faced with an overwhelming bipartisan majority
in both houses in support of that."
Senate Republican leaders, attempting to draft an alternative to
Reagan s fiscal 1986 budget that would produce greater reductions in
the deficit, have suggested a cancellation of the COLAs next year as part
of a comprehensive one-year spending freeze.
A study released yesterday by an economic forecasting firm showed
that a one-year freeze of the COLAs would result in a half-million older
Americans, mainly elderly women, being pushed below the poverty line
in 1986. More than three-fifths of that half-million would be 72 years
old or older, the study found. The COLAs are paid each year to prevent
Social Security benefits from being eroded by inflation.
Reagan "seems to be under some strange illusion . . . that an over
powering congressional mandate is going to force him to break his prom
ise to protect the cost-of-living adjustments for the Social Security
recipients," Wright said in an interview yesterday morning on NBCs
"Today" show.
"I can't speak for the Senate, but I can assure him that the House will
nqt be party to any [effort] such as that. We're not going to help him keep
his promise to the retirees of the United States," he said.
During his re-election campaign Reagan promised not to tamper with
Social Security, including the annual cost-of-living adjustment. When
asked Wednesday night whether Social Security was still off-limits,
Reagan said that if Congress insisted, "I would have to look at that situa
tion and what I was faced with, \vith regard to a possible congressional
mandate."
Kennedy remarks stir S. Africans
CAPETOWN, South Africa — After listening to Sen. Edward Ken
nedy s criticism of its apartheid policies of racial segregation for nearly a
week, South Africa began yesterday to counterattack, attempting to
make Kennedy, not apartheid, the focus of controversy.
In the course of 24 hours, the Massachusetts Democrat found himself
embroiled in disputes with Foreign Minister Roelof "Pik" Botha, Zulu
chief Gatsha Buthelezi, Dr. Christian Barnard, the pioneer heart
transplant surgeon, Capetown's liberal white mayor and local govern
ment administrators of black areas he visited.
There were also demonstrations yesterday by black militants from the
Azanian People's Organization, which wants Kennedy to go home, and
by Buthelezi's own Inkatha political movement, which opposes any eco
nomic sanctions against South Africa over apartheid.
In addition, editorial writers in both the English-language and more
conservative Afrikaans press sharpened their criticism of Kennedy,
questioning his motives for the eight-day visit and arguing that his own
personal flaws disqualified him from passing moral judgment on anyone
else.
"We must be getting to them," a Kennedy aide said, scanning the
angry newspaper editorials on the senator's visit. "They are starting to
play rough. Well, we can too."
Kennedy then issued a statement replying to Botha's attack and an
other statement criticizing Buthelezi. To Barnard's challenge for a tele
vision debate over health care for the poor here and in the United States,
Kennedy suggested that he debate a black physician instead. And at the
crossroads squatter camp here, Kennedy used the skills honed in Senate
debates and committee hearings to grill an official on the government's
policies.
CIA accused of intimidation
The CIA made a "crude attempt" to intimidate Jack Anderson into"
revealing confidential sources for a story about agency drug smuggling,
the syndicated columnist told the Los Angeles Times yesterday.
Patti Volz, a spokeswoman for the Central Intelligence Agency,
denied that a Dec. 26 letter from a high-ranking agency official to the
columnist was "a question of intimidation," but that it was only an effort
to have Anderson substantiate published charges that the CIA is
"involved in something blatantly illegal."
Anderson's exchange with the agency marks the second reported ef
fort by the CIA to challenge critical news reports of its involvement with
the bankrupt Honolulu investment firm of Bishop, Baldwin, Rewald,
Dillingham and Wong.
The agency has openly challenged ABC News' reporting of the Bis
hop, Baldwin story, and last November filed a formal complaint against
the network with the Federal Communications Commission. ABC
retracted a portion of its story, and, yesterday, the FCC staff dismissed
the ClA's complaint against the network.
Anderson responded to the ClA's letter with a mocking offer to share
his sources with the agency if the agency would agree to share its sources
with him.
"I think the letter smacks of intimidation," Anderson said in a tele
phone interview this week, "but it's not going to be successful."
Officer testifies in Polish trial
WARSAW, Poland — The most senior police officer implicated in the
murder of Warsaw priest Jerzy Popieluszko said yesterday he had never
authorized the use of force against the outspoken cleric and blamed the
killing on the initiative of his subordinate.
Testimony by Col. Adam Pietruszka, a deputy department director in
the Interior Ministry accused of aiding and abetting three junior officers
in the murder, appeared to end speculation that the threat of a trial and
stiff sentences might push the defendants to name higher-ranking offi
cials as instigators of the crime.
Grzegorz Piotrowski, the ex-captain charged with leading the assault,
concluded on the stand earlier yesterday that while he had been con
vinced high-level backing existed for the plot, he now understands the
killing of the priest was never sanctioned by his superiors. He realized
this, he said, when he saw Pietruszka's fury and shock at being told by
Piotrowski two days after the killing that Popieluszko was dead.
Nevertheless, Piotrowski and two former lieutenants who with him
kidnaped the priest, have testified that Pietruszka strongly suggested an
operation against Popieluszko, even if such action might result in the
frail cleric s death. They also have told of Pietruszka's involvement in a
vain attempt by all four to cover up the crime.
Bush begins plans for 1988
WASHINGTON — Less than two weeks before his second-term in
auguration, Vice President George Bush said yesterday that he has
taken preliminary steps to organize a 1988 presidential campaign, but
has not committed himself to running.
Bush said he is "talking to a handful of very close friends (to deter
mine) what I should do now to protect a decision way down into the
future." He emphasized in an interview, however: "I haven't made any
decisions at all."
But among Bush s close advisers, including his wife, Barbara, his can
didacy in 1988 is considered to have "a certain amount of inevitability,"
in the words of Peter Teeley, Bush's press secretary. Bush, 60, was
Reagan s chief challenger for the 1980 presidential nomination, and is
the GOP front-runner for 1988.
The vice president acknowledged in the interview that he has dis
cussed a 1988 race informally with Edward Rollins, director of the 1984
Reagan-Bush campaign, whose support Bush said he would be
"flattered and honored" to have.

powering congressional mandate is going to force him to break his prom
ise to protect the cost-of-living adjustments for the Social Security
recipients," Wright said in an interview yesterday morning on NBCs
"Today" show.
"I can't speak for the Senate, but I can assure him that the House will
nqt be party to any [effort] such as that. We're not going to help him keep
his promise to the retirees of the United States," he said.
During his re-election campaign Reagan promised not to tamper with
Social Security, including the annual cost-of-living adjustment. When
asked Wednesday night whether Social Security was still off-limits,
Reagan said that if Congress insisted, "I would have to look at that situa
tion and what I was faced with, \vith regard to a possible congressional
mandate."
Kennedy remarks stir S. Africans
CAPETOWN, South Africa — After listening to Sen. Edward Ken
nedy s criticism of its apartheid policies of racial segregation for nearly a
week, South Africa began yesterday to counterattack, attempting to
make Kennedy, not apartheid, the focus of controversy.
In the course of 24 hours, the Massachusetts Democrat found himself
embroiled in disputes with Foreign Minister Roelof "Pik" Botha, Zulu
chief Gatsha Buthelezi, Dr. Christian Barnard, the pioneer heart
transplant surgeon, Capetown's liberal white mayor and local govern
ment administrators of black areas he visited.
There were also demonstrations yesterday by black militants from the
Azanian People's Organization, which wants Kennedy to go home, and
by Buthelezi's own Inkatha political movement, which opposes any eco
nomic sanctions against South Africa over apartheid.
In addition, editorial writers in both the English-language and more
conservative Afrikaans press sharpened their criticism of Kennedy,
questioning his motives for the eight-day visit and arguing that his own
personal flaws disqualified him from passing moral judgment on anyone
else.
"We must be getting to them," a Kennedy aide said, scanning the
angry newspaper editorials on the senator's visit. "They are starting to
play rough. Well, we can too."
Kennedy then issued a statement replying to Botha's attack and an
other statement criticizing Buthelezi. To Barnard's challenge for a tele
vision debate over health care for the poor here and in the United States,
Kennedy suggested that he debate a black physician instead. And at the
crossroads squatter camp here, Kennedy used the skills honed in Senate
debates and committee hearings to grill an official on the government's
policies.
CIA accused of intimidation
The CIA made a "crude attempt" to intimidate Jack Anderson into"
revealing confidential sources for a story about agency drug smuggling,
the syndicated columnist told the Los Angeles Times yesterday.
Patti Volz, a spokeswoman for the Central Intelligence Agency,
denied that a Dec. 26 letter from a high-ranking agency official to the
columnist was "a question of intimidation," but that it was only an effort
to have Anderson substantiate published charges that the CIA is
"involved in something blatantly illegal."
Anderson's exchange with the agency marks the second reported ef
fort by the CIA to challenge critical news reports of its involvement with
the bankrupt Honolulu investment firm of Bishop, Baldwin, Rewald,
Dillingham and Wong.
The agency has openly challenged ABC News' reporting of the Bis
hop, Baldwin story, and last November filed a formal complaint against
the network with the Federal Communications Commission. ABC
retracted a portion of its story, and, yesterday, the FCC staff dismissed
the ClA's complaint against the network.
Anderson responded to the ClA's letter with a mocking offer to share
his sources with the agency if the agency would agree to share its sources
with him.
"I think the letter smacks of intimidation," Anderson said in a tele
phone interview this week, "but it's not going to be successful."
Officer testifies in Polish trial
WARSAW, Poland — The most senior police officer implicated in the
murder of Warsaw priest Jerzy Popieluszko said yesterday he had never
authorized the use of force against the outspoken cleric and blamed the
killing on the initiative of his subordinate.
Testimony by Col. Adam Pietruszka, a deputy department director in
the Interior Ministry accused of aiding and abetting three junior officers
in the murder, appeared to end speculation that the threat of a trial and
stiff sentences might push the defendants to name higher-ranking offi
cials as instigators of the crime.
Grzegorz Piotrowski, the ex-captain charged with leading the assault,
concluded on the stand earlier yesterday that while he had been con
vinced high-level backing existed for the plot, he now understands the
killing of the priest was never sanctioned by his superiors. He realized
this, he said, when he saw Pietruszka's fury and shock at being told by
Piotrowski two days after the killing that Popieluszko was dead.
Nevertheless, Piotrowski and two former lieutenants who with him
kidnaped the priest, have testified that Pietruszka strongly suggested an
operation against Popieluszko, even if such action might result in the
frail cleric s death. They also have told of Pietruszka's involvement in a
vain attempt by all four to cover up the crime.
Bush begins plans for 1988
WASHINGTON — Less than two weeks before his second-term in
auguration, Vice President George Bush said yesterday that he has
taken preliminary steps to organize a 1988 presidential campaign, but
has not committed himself to running.
Bush said he is "talking to a handful of very close friends (to deter
mine) what I should do now to protect a decision way down into the
future." He emphasized in an interview, however: "I haven't made any
decisions at all."
But among Bush s close advisers, including his wife, Barbara, his can
didacy in 1988 is considered to have "a certain amount of inevitability,"
in the words of Peter Teeley, Bush's press secretary. Bush, 60, was
Reagan s chief challenger for the 1980 presidential nomination, and is
the GOP front-runner for 1988.
The vice president acknowledged in the interview that he has dis
cussed a 1988 race informally with Edward Rollins, director of the 1984
Reagan-Bush campaign, whose support Bush said he would be
"flattered and honored" to have.

Reagan faces opposition in House
WASHINGTON — Majority Leader James Wright (D-Texas) said
yesterday that the House will not go along with any effort to freeze So
cial Security cost-of-living adjustments for a year to help reduce the
federal deficit.
President Reagan said at a news conference Wednesday night that he
might consider a one-year deferral of Social Security cost-of-living ad
justments (COLAs) if "faced with an overwhelming bipartisan majority
in both houses in support of that."
Senate Republican leaders, attempting to draft an alternative to
Reagan s fiscal 1986 budget that would produce greater reductions in
the deficit, have suggested a cancellation of the COLAs next year as part
of a comprehensive one-year spending freeze.
A study released yesterday by an economic forecasting firm showed
that a one-year freeze of the COLAs would result in a half-million older
Americans, mainly elderly women, being pushed below the poverty line
in 1986. More than three-fifths of that half-million would be 72 years
old or older, the study found. The COLAs are paid each year to prevent
Social Security benefits from being eroded by inflation.
Reagan "seems to be under some strange illusion . . . that an over
powering congressional mandate is going to force him to break his prom
ise to protect the cost-of-living adjustments for the Social Security
recipients," Wright said in an interview yesterday morning on NBCs
