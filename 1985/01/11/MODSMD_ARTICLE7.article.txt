# Reagan shuffles cabinet again

WASHINGTON â€” President
Reagan continued to shuffle his
Cabinet yesterday in preparation for
his second term, announcing that he
intends to nominate Energy Secretary
Donald Hodel as secretary of the In
terior, and White House personnel
director John Herrington to take over
the Energy Department.
Reagan also announced he will
nominate William Bennett, currently
chairman of the National Endowment
for the Humanities, as secretary of
education.
And it was announced that Richard
Darman, one of the most influential
White House officials during
Reagan's first term, is scheduled to
become deputy Treasury secretary
under James Baker 111, the White
House chief of staff, with whom Dar
man has been closely associated.

Reagan earlier this week nominated
Baker to become secretary of the
Treasury.
Meanwhile, administration officials
said yesterday that several possible
government reorganization schemes
have run into difficulty.
At a Cabinet meeting yesterday,
Secretary of State George Shultz
raised "quite vigorous" objections to
a plan that would consolidate trade
functions in a new Department of In
ternational Trade and Industry, the
officials said.
Reagan earlier promised Com
merce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige,
chief architect of the idea, that he
would support it, but officials quoted
Shultz as telling Reagan, "I wish you
hadn't done this."
White House spokesman Larry
Speakes said the president has taken

the trade proposal "under advise
ment." The plan would consolidate
trade functions currently at the De
partment of Commerce and the Of
fice of the Special Trade Representa
tive. Several agencies now at Com
merce and not related to trade issues,
such as the Census Bureau, would be
spun off.
Despite the objections, officials
said they still expect Reagan to ap
prove the new trade department, al
though key details remain to be
worked out, particularly the fate of
the agencies not associated with
trade. What happens to these
agencies, which also include the Na
tional Oceanic and Atmospheric Ad
ministration, is one of the key factors
in whether Congress goes along with
the plan.
Officials also said it was now

unlikely that Reagan would seek to
merge the Energy and Interior de
partments any time soon. Reagan
promised in his 1980 campaign to
eliminate the Energy Department but
the idea met with stiff congressional
opposition.
Recently, a proposal to merge the
two departments was discussed by
senior officials, including White
House counselor Edwin Meese 111,
whom Reagan has nominated as at
torney general, and outgoing Interior
Secretary William Clark, who is re
turning to California.
The nomination of Hodel to
succeed Clark was reported earlier
and had been expected since Clark
told Reagan over the New Year's
holiday that he wanted to go back to
his ranch.
