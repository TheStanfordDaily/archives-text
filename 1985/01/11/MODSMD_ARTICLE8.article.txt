# Shultz pitches 'Star Wars' on Hill
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State George
Shultz, briefing congressmen on his agreement to
begin new arms talks with the Soviets, put in a pitch
yesterday for congressional approval of two of the
Reagan administration's most controversial arms
proposals — the "Star Wars" space-based missile
defense system and the MX missile.
However, many on Capitol Hill believe it is too
early to tell whether the prospect of a breakthrough
in arms negotiations will give the administration an
edge in getting Congress to accept the two pro
grams.
Shultz told reporters after separate closed ses
sions with House and Senate members that the two
programs should be pursued regardless of the
negotiations, because they are vital to U.S. secur
ity.
However, he also suggested that continuing the
programs would strengthen the U.S. position in the
talks: "It is obviously the case that if [the Soviets]
can get what they want out of us without giving up
anything in return, they would love it."

Shultz said diplomats next week would begin
trying to agree on a time and place for the talks,
which are to include long-range strategic weapons,
intermediate-range missiles and space weapons.
Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko agreed to the negotiations at preliminary
sessions in Geneva earlier this week.
Congress is tentatively scheduled to vote in
March whether to spend the $2.5 billion it has set
aside to build 21 additional MX missiles, and
leaders of both houses have said the program's
chances are dicey. There also is strong opposition
to the Star Wars proposal, which Shultz said would
"move from deterrence based on the idea that 'we
can each blow each other up' to a deterrent based
more and more on defense."
Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.), Senate Foreign
Relations Committee chairman, and Rep. Dante
Fascell (D-Fla.), House Foreign Affairs Committee
chairman, each said after the briefings that they are
uncertain whether the anticipated arms negotia
tions have affected either program's prospects.

With most congressmen out of town for a congres
sional recess, it is difficult to determine overall
sentiment, they said.
However, Rep. Roy Dyson (D-Md.), one of
about 50 congressmen attending the briefing for
House members, said the session "was like a love
in there today. The Democrats there seemed to be
overwhelmed with what had been accomplished."
Dyson, who has supported the missile defense
plan and opposed the MX, added: "I think the ad
ministration has a tremendous momentum building
right now. They're very good at this. [From their
standpoint,] they ought to capitalize on it."
But others on Capitol Hill have suggested that
hopes for successful arms talks could instead work
against the weapons programs. They argue that
Congress is likely to want to avoid antagonizing the
Soviets during such a critical period.
