## Durand Building asbestos removal planned for March 
### BRYAN WALSER Staff writer 
University officials have made
plans to remove potentially danger
ous asbestos from the Durand Build
ing sometime in March, according to
James Burke, facilities coordinator
for the Stanford Electronics Labora
tory.
Burke emphasized that this is a
preventive action and that there is no
danger present to workers in the
building. "Asbestos levels in the
Durand Building's air are an order of
magnitude below federal health
guidelines and are right at ambient
Bay Area levels," Burke said.
While some workers in Durand
have expressed concern over possible
asbestos contamination, Burke says
there is no cause for alarm.
Asbestos is a building material that
was commonly used in the 1950s and
'60s for fireproofing and insulation.
Researchers discovered that certain
lengths of asbestos fiber can lead to
serious lung damage if inhaled. This
discovery has led to nationwide
removal or encapsulation programs.

Stanford began its own program of
asbestos abatement by removing as
bestos from Jordan Ouad's air cir
culation system, which was decaying.
The asbestos used in Durand does not
yet show signs of deterioration, but
the University has decided to remove
it before it can become a threat.
Since Durand will stay open during
asbestos removal, various safety
measures will be taken to ensure that
no health hazards are created.
Workers will enter the work site
through a "clean room" and will wear
protective clothing. After use, the
clothing will be properly disposed of,
and workers will exit through the
"clean room."
Also, negative pressure will be
maintained throughout the workplace
so that air flow will not spread the as
bestos.
According to Burke, the University
plans to engage in removal or encap
sulation projects for at least the next
five years and has ordered abatement
programs for areas undergoing
routine renovation.
