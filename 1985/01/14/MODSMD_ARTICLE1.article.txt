# Police snatch phony tickets for Super Bowl
## 
### DAVE DUTCHER Daily staff 
Some people lucky enough to possess a ticket to Super
Bowl XIX might find themselves out of luck at the Stan
ford Stadium entrance gate on Sunday.
1 hat's because as many as 500 counterfeit tickets might
be in circulation, according to the National Football
League. The NFL announced Saturday that the Millbrae
City Police Department had exposed a counterfeit ticket
ring Friday evening. Thirty-two bogus tickets were dis
covered, and one suspect was apprehended. The suspect
— Dean Foes, a 26-year-old from Honolulu, Hawaii —
was charged with grand theft and forgery for attempting
to sell the tickets.
Millbrae police yesterday discovered 849 additional
tickets in a sewer. The tickets were apparently going to be
sold today.
"It should be a buyer-beware situation for any fans who
are purchasing resale tickets from another party," NFL
Executive Director Don Weiss said. In a news release, the
NFL office said, "Tickets will be subject to close inspec
tion at Stanford Stadium on game day."
However, this situation shouldn't present a problem for
Stanford faculty, staff and students who purchased tickets
through the campus draws. A news release from the NFL
said those who purchased tickets from an NFL team ticket
office "need not be concerned about the authenticity of
their tickets."
Alan Cummings, associate athletic director and a main
liaison to the NFL, concurred with the NFL release. Stan
ford received 1,500 tickets, of which 200 were awarded to
the winners of student and faculty-staff drawings.
"The tickets we got came directly from the NFL, and
they mailed the tickets certified mail," Cummings said.
For those concerned that their tickets may be counter
feit, the NFL has established a verification center at
Candlestick Park in San Francisco. The center is located
at the baseball ticket booth at Gate Band will be open
from 2 to 6 p.m. through Saturday.
The NFL identified four major differences between the
genuine and counterfeit tickets.
• Color — The colors on the counterfeit tickets are not as
sharp. The real tickets have more of a blend of colors in
the background, but the background of the fake tickets is
blue.
• Ticket stock — The counterfeit tickets are made of thin
ner paper than the genuine ones and do not reveal a pink
inner sheet when the top layer is removed. The false tick
ets are also bit larger.
• Printing — The typeface on the stairway, section and
seat numbers is larger on the counterfeit tickets, and gate
numbers are incorrect.
• Perforation — The perforation marks on the counterfeit
tickets are more pronounced and visible.
"As hard as these people tried, I think that you can see
with the naked eye that it is close but certainly it is not a
perfect counterfeit ticket," according to Warren Welsh,
NFL executive director of security.
Welsh said he thinks the counterfeiters answered news
paper advertisements from people asking to buy tickets.
Welsh said Millbrae police exposed the ring after the
suspect allegedly sold tickets to another individual. He
added that it's not likely the suspect was involved in the
counterfeiting.
"I think the investigation to date would lead one to
believe that he is not [involved in the counterfeiting], that
he was a mere worker for this group," Welsh said. " I think
there are possibly two or three involved at this point, and
at least two of the people are from Honolulu."
Welsh added that there might be "some interstate
ramifications to this" and that the Millbrae police and
possibly the FBI and the Postal Service will be conducting
investigations.
