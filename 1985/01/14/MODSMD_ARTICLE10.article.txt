## The 						Stanford Daily Budget cut doubletalk 
### 
In an effort to reduce a deficit threatening to
top $200 billion in 1985, the Reagan Administra
tion has outlined proposals that threaten the
future of federal student financial aid programs
and would thus drastically cut loan funding at
Stanford.
Never mind that President Reagan may renege
on his promise and cut into Social Security if he
can muster bipartisan congressional support.
Never mind that the current budget-cut proposals
will effectively gut, among others, the Consumer
Protection Agency and the Small Business Ad
ministration. Never mind that administration of
ficials have shown less care for most social pro
grams than Rome showed for Carthage.
Federal aid cuts pose an immediate threat to
students here; these are programs we cannot af
ford to see destroyed.
Financial Aids Director Robert Huff outlined
three rumored administration proposals which he
said would have a "disastrous" effect on under
graduates at Stanford and would make it very dif
ficult for the University to meet students' demon
strated financial needs.

Plan one would place a ceiling on the allowable
family incomes of students borrowing from the
government under the Guaranteed Student Loan
program. This means that students whose parents
make $30,000 or more a year would be ineligible
to apply for GSL loans.
Plan two would lower the maximum amount of
federal aid a student can receive from the current
$7,000 to $4,000 a year.
Plan three would freeze the four campus-based
federal financial aid programs (National Direct
Student Loans, Pell Grants, Supplemental Edu
cational Opportunity Grants and work-study
programs) at current levels so as not to permit
funding increases.
The Reagan Administration is intent on main
taining the military budget at the expense of
relatively small programs. The same cut that
would gut the Consumer Protection Agency
would barely dent the defense budget. The brunt
of the budget cuts should not come from already
weak social programs such as student financial
aid but rather from the steadily rising allocation
for defense.
