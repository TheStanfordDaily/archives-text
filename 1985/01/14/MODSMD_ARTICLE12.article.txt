H seems that the infamous Steve
Vineberg is at it again. In his recent
review of Francis Ford Coppola's
"Tlie Cotton Club" he mistakenly
writes that the character of Dixie
Dunbar saved gangster Dutch
Schultz from a bullet. Sorry, Steve, it
was a bomb. The confusion contin
ues as Vineberg mixes up the charac
ters of Owney Madden, owner of the
Cotton Club, with his right-hand
man, Frenchy DeMange. (Just to set
the facts straight, it was Frenchy, not
Madden, who was kidnaped.)
Perhaps Vineberg should have
more time paying attention to
the*movie rather than thinking of
"witty" insults and invectives to hurl
at Coppola, the director. If he had,
he would have recognized a truly
enjoyable piece of filmmaking for
whjit it was worth. "The Cotton
Clijb" was neither a historical ac
count of Harlem in the 1920s, nor an
MCM musical extravaganza. In
stead, it was an entertaining film, a
wonderful blend of drama, music and
comedy, flavored with the charac
ter!;, both fictional and real, of that
bygone era. After the debacles of
"Qne From the Heart" and "The
Outsiders," Coppola redeems him
self with "The Cotton Club." He can
nojv reclaim his position of being one
of America's finest filmmakers.
