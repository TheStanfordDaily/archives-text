## Super Bowl lessons 
### 
It is a lucky chance for us, the students of
Stanford, that the 1985 Super Bowl is being
held here. Sure the campus will be a mess and
the fans a hassle, but think about what we're
getting in return: a unique object lesson on the
wonders of the American Way.
To begin with, we can admire two teams that
have reached the pinnacle of a freely competi
tive league. They faced other teams with equal
chances to compete, and have come out the
winners. There',s something inspiring and
enviable about the success of the 49ers —
wouldn't you like to see eight articles about
yourself in every issue of the San Francisco
Chronicle? One can't help but envy the individ
ual players as well. For the next week their
names will be whispered reverently on quiver
ing lips and spray-painted on walls across the
nation. When you're the best, the public happily
forgives a drug problem or a contract holdout.
Very few of us at Stanford are talented foot
ball players. No problem: The lesson of the
Super Bowl includes a taste of what lies ahead
for the Stanford student who works hard and
makes himself or herself marketable. In the Jan.
9 issue of The Daily, a few of the possibilities
were listed. Twenty-six corporate tailgaters are
scheduled to take place — lavish affairs flowing
with fine food, wine and good cheer for well
paid, productive corporate employees. Ahem.
We read of 500 limousines, conveying to the
game at least 500 men and women who have
reaped the rewards of success in the open mar
ket. Still not hungry? Then I guess I won't even

mention the 1,500 private jets due to arrive at
area airports. On a lower level, one can still
aspire to be one of thousands of fans who can
afford to fly in from around the country to
watch three hours of football. The flashing dol
lar signs are enough to drive you to business
school — anything to join the club.
By bringing all the rich folks to town, the
Super Bowl teaches yet another facet of the
American ideal. For a hard-working student en
trepreneur, there's a pile of money to be made.
No doubt many of our prospective guests would
pay handsomely for the chance to stay in a dorm
and relive their college days. So why does Resi
dential Education object to our renting out our

rooms over the weekend? It wants a cut of the
profits. Try writing down and submitting your
sublet proposal on a couple of twenties and then
have them read you the fine print on your
housing contract. It's a pity there aren't any tall
buildings around the stadium; the ASSU has
probably already sold all the space on the obser
vation deck of Hoover Tower.
If personal goods are more your style, that's
fine. The bookstore is sure to be picked clean by
souvenir scavengers, so buy a bunch of stuff
now and sell it at double price on Super Bowl
Sunday. Or you could print up T-shirts to sell
outside the gates. Any fan would be proud to go
home with an "Official 1985 Stanford Student

Edition Commemorative Super Bowl Shirt." Of
course, those of us who put our money into
"Welcome Home John Elway" jerseys stand to
lose some bucks, but hey, that's the market. The
Super Bowl is the perfect opportunity to
practice the fine, old American tradition of
making money.
The last lesson offered by the presence of the
Super Bowl is different from the others. It's one
of humility to Stanford students. On Jan. 20
we'll be just a few pairs of eyes among 100 mil
lion television viewers. Just dust in the wind.
The whole student body has been offered only
50 pairs of tickets — no one seems to care that
we're some of the rowdiest, most innovative,
fun-to-watch football fans around. I feel small.
They didn't even invite the Band to play at
halftime, a low blow to school pride. And even
if we all did get into the game, it's intimidating
to think that the time it takes to say "Hi Mom"
to the TV cameras would cost $100,000 to buy.
I feel smaller.
Yes, we the students of Stanford have been
put in our place. At the same time, however,
we've been shown what can be a golden future.
With a good GPA and a Stanford degree, you
may find yourself arriving for the next Stanford
Super Bowl in a custom limousine, sipping
champagne and casually clutching your 50-
yard-line tickets, a glorious example to future
students of the promise of the American Way.
Don't it sound just great?
