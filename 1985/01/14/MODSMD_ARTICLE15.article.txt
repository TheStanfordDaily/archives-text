## All men at fault in rape and terror 
### 
The recent series of rape reportings in Palo Alto
and Menlo Park has touched the life of every
woman in these communities. How this affects our
lives has motivated me to consider the pervasive ef
fects of rape and the fear of rape. I believe that
rape and the fear of rape are forms of systematic in

\ VIEWPOINT

tirQidation and, as such, forms of terrorism. As
wqmen, we are aware that we have been, and can
bej raped at any time and in any place. Statistically
th<f rapist is very likely to be someone we know, if
noi someone we trust. We live with this knowledge,
this fear. This crime of sexual violence is per
petuated in our lives where sex and rape often
betome indistinguishable, where consent is never
determined and where force is romanticized.
pur fear is grounded in the reality that one of
fo6r women will be raped in her lifetime. As Stan
ford students, we need to be reminded that being at
Stanford fails to make us atypical women. Though
at times I have hoped that Stanford would shield us
fram the injustice women face in the world. I and
coiintless other women at Stanford know the fear,
th$ guilt and the anger of being raped. Fear is the
product of the terrorism of rape. It constrains and
linjits our freedom in the world.
jn the darkness of winter nights, I fear riding my
bi<jycle from campus to my home on Hamilton Av
enue. I fear walking down Mayfield Avenue at
dusk. I feel fear, alone in my bedroom with the
glass windows, comforted only when my lover
re$ts beside me. I fear night. Rape is the constant
anjl ever-present reminder of our oppression. At
th£> point, I am expanding my definition of sys
tematic intimidation (terrorism) to include harass
ment and the objectification of women; these acts
of mtimidation serve continually to remind us of
the power men exercise over us. The harassment

speaks to a particular experience we have all had —
or are intimately aware of our vulnerability to —
that of rape. Our exposure in provocative advertis
ing clearly presumes men's right to access, be it
with their eyes or with their bodies.
Fundamental to the systematic oppression of
women is the power to enforce the ultimate threat,
and this power lies with the rapist. All men share in
the power garnered from the rapist's act. This act
serves to keep women off the streets — silent,
passive and afraid — while men gain power from
the role of hero, protector, guardian and "good
man."

I do not draw distinc
tions between good men
and rapists.

All men perpetuate the conditions of women's
oppression through their passive and active com
plicity. I do not draw distinctions between good
men and rapists: I cannot, when so much of my ex
perience and knowledge defy this division. Men
strengthen the conditions of our oppression when
they trivialize and invalidate our common experi
ence, when harassment is seen as just fun and when
our fear is seen as petty cowardice.
Underlying these ideas is the presumption that
our experience is unfounded. Society tends to in
validate women's experience when the study of that
(

experience uncovers society's structural inequities.
For instance, if seen in this light, the fact that men
expose themselves to women on campus should not
be taken either as the act of one sick man, or the
harmless bravado of a few men. It should be taken
as an instance of men claiming the right to force our
recognition of their genitalia. Flashers are not
harmless; they are an ever-present reminder of
male aggression and dominance.
At this point I am going to extend my definition
of rape to include those instances where our
(women's) peace of mind and monetary concerns
are compromised by men. I ponder why I have to
tolerate boorish stunts by men on campus. Why am
I held responsible to help defray the costs of the da
mages men routinely inflict on University property,
from the stolen signs that grace the walls of drink
ing rooms to destroyed and littered lawns after a
rowdy party? Why do I pay for the staff time
consumed by men's bigotry, men's drunkenness
and men's routine pre-adolescent behavior?
I call on men to take responsibility.
I call on men to assume financial responsibility.
I call on men to examine what right you have to
your drunken stupors.
I call on men to change the atmosphere of fear
and terrorism that male power feeds upon.
I call on men to lift your burden from half of
humanity's shoulders.
But do not offer women protection. Do not
console women with bodyguards. Do not warn
women, and resrict women to daylight hours, for
our protection.
Give us unrestricted freedom to breath, live, and
walk upon this earth unharrowed by your collective
terrorism and without constant reminders of the
price far too many of us have paid for your male
power.

The recent series of rape reportings in Palo Alto
and Menlo Park has touched the life of every
woman in these communities. How this affects our
lives has motivated me to consider the pervasive ef
fects of rape and the fear of rape. I believe that
rape and the fear of rape are forms of systematic in

\ VIEWPOINT

tirQidation and, as such, forms of terrorism. As
wqmen, we are aware that we have been, and can
bej raped at any time and in any place. Statistically
th<f rapist is very likely to be someone we know, if
noi someone we trust. We live with this knowledge,
this fear. This crime of sexual violence is per
petuated in our lives where sex and rape often
betome indistinguishable, where consent is never
determined and where force is romanticized.
pur fear is grounded in the reality that one of
fo6r women will be raped in her lifetime. As Stan
ford students, we need to be reminded that being at
Stanford fails to make us atypical women. Though
at times I have hoped that Stanford would shield us
fram the injustice women face in the world. I and
coiintless other women at Stanford know the fear,
th$ guilt and the anger of being raped. Fear is the
product of the terrorism of rape. It constrains and
linjits our freedom in the world.
jn the darkness of winter nights, I fear riding my
bi<jycle from campus to my home on Hamilton Av
enue. I fear walking down Mayfield Avenue at
dusk. I feel fear, alone in my bedroom with the
glass windows, comforted only when my lover
re$ts beside me. I fear night. Rape is the constant
anjl ever-present reminder of our oppression. At
th£> point, I am expanding my definition of sys
tematic intimidation (terrorism) to include harass
ment and the objectification of women; these acts
of mtimidation serve continually to remind us of
the power men exercise over us. The harassment

speaks to a particular experience we have all had —
or are intimately aware of our vulnerability to —
that of rape. Our exposure in provocative advertis
ing clearly presumes men's right to access, be it
with their eyes or with their bodies.
Fundamental to the systematic oppression of
women is the power to enforce the ultimate threat,
and this power lies with the rapist. All men share in
the power garnered from the rapist's act. This act
serves to keep women off the streets — silent,
passive and afraid — while men gain power from
the role of hero, protector, guardian and "good
man."

I do not draw distinc
tions between good men
and rapists.

All men perpetuate the conditions of women's
oppression through their passive and active com
plicity. I do not draw distinctions between good
men and rapists: I cannot, when so much of my ex
perience and knowledge defy this division. Men
strengthen the conditions of our oppression when
they trivialize and invalidate our common experi
ence, when harassment is seen as just fun and when
our fear is seen as petty cowardice.
Underlying these ideas is the presumption that
our experience is unfounded. Society tends to in
validate women's experience when the study of that
(

experience uncovers society's structural inequities.
