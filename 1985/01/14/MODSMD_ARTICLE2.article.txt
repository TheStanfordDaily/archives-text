# Officials plan security
## 
### DAVID GOLDSTEIN 
About 500 police and hired personnel will
join forces Sunday to provide security at Super
Bowl XIX, according to Stanford Police Chief
Marvin Herrington.
Herrington says he does not anticipate any
security difficulties.
"This is not a typical football crowd," be
cause the fans who are able to attain tickets are

SUPERB OWL

generally more well-to-do and well-behaved
than the typical Candlestick Park spectator, he
said.
Associate Athletic Director Alan Cummings,
the University's chief Super Bowl operative,
said the NFL contracted a private Los Angeles
based security company, Contemporary Secur
ity Services, to assist at the game.
"The NFL has had very good luck with them
(Contemporary Security Services)," Cummings
said. "They are experienced in crowd control
and stadiums," having assisted at many such
functions, including the Rose Bowl.
Field rushing, which plagued the playoff
game at Candlestick Park after the 49ers' vic
tory, should be little or no problem here, Her
rington said. Nevertheless, he plans to have 300
people guarding the field from overzealous
fans.
Herrington also said that traffic control will

be enforced. No one without a Super Bowl
ticket will be allowed to drive onto campus from
El Camino Real.
"Obviously, if you live here that won't ap
ply," Herrington said.
Palo Alto police will take care of traffic
within the Palo Alto city limits.
Because the game will end after dark, the
parking areas outside Stanford Stadium will be
lit, and vans will be available to take lost fans
back to their cars after the game, Herrington
said.
The 15,000 to 20,000 people without tickets
who are expected to descend upon the area
should noT pose too much trouble because
fences and security personnel will keep them
away from the stadium, he said.
Tailgaters will also be kept from the area.
"We don't have the space for them," Her
rington said.
He added that he is beefing up security
outside the stadium and plans to have eight offi
cers on motorcycles patrolling the campus.
Scalpers also should beware.
"We'll arrest them if we catch them," Her
rington said, although he doesn't consider them
a high-priority problem. Selling tickets at the
game site on the day of the game for more than
the face value of the ticket is illegal, he ex
plained.
Herrington refused to discuss the possibility
of terrorism but said, "Anything is possible.
We're prepared to handle [terrorists]."
Herrington expects after-game revelers to
head to San Francisco for parties, regardless of
who wins the game. Security will be in force
there, too. but Herrington is not responsible for
that.
And that suits him fine.
