## Card not pretty, but victorious, 55-51 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
Stanford won its first Pacific 10
Conference basketball game Satur
day afternoon. It wasn't a particularly
pretty victory, but a victory nonethe
less.
"We'll take it," Stanford Coach
Tom Davis said of the 55-51 victory
over the University of Arizona, a
team considered by many — includ
ing Davis — to be of top 20 caliber. A
Mpples Pavilion crowd of 6,209 and a
Metro Sports television audience

watched Stanford improve its record
to 9-5 overall and 1-3 in the Pac-10.
"I think this win means a lot to us,"
said John Paye, who started at guard
yesterday after starting at forward in
Thursday night's 15-point loss to
Arizona State University. "Our con
fidence was sort of dwindling, espe
cially after the Arizona State game."
Arizona Coach Lute Olson, mean
while, was rather disgusted with his
Wildcats, who dropped to 11-4 over
all and 2-1 in the Pac-10. The
Wildcats won their first two Pac-10

games by a total of three points and
their bid to win a third straight
squeaker ended when Morgan Taylor
made what Olson called a "very bad
decision."
After Wildcat guard Craig McMil
lan cut a four-point Stanford lead to
two with 14 seconds remaining, for
ward Eddie Smith fouled Paye and
sent him to the free throw line to
shoot one-and-one. Paye's free throw
was short and Arizona had a chance
to tie the game and send it into
overtime.
But instead of working the ball
inside, Taylor, a 6-foot-7 forward,
fired off an off-balance 2()-footer. It
hit nothing. Cardinal center Kent
Seymour grabbed the ball, was
fouled, hit two free throws with 0:03
to go, and Arizona had its first Pac-10
defeat.
Said Olson of his postgame talk: "I
walked into the locker room and said,
"OK, hypothetical situation: We're
down by two, and there are seven
seconds left. What do we do?' "
Olson didn't wait for an answer.
"We stick it inside," he said. "We
don't take a 20-footer. We get it
inside to Smith. We do that every day
in practice. We just made a very bad
decision on that one."
But as angry as Olson was with his
own team, he praised Stanford, espe
cially when the topic of rebounding
came up. "They killed us on the of
fensive boards in the second half," he
said while staring at the statistics
sheet, which credited Stanford with
10 offensive rebounds in the second
half and a 37-32 margin overall.
"That's the first time we've been out
rebounded in a while."
Other than the rebounding num
bers, the final statistics were, well,
ugly. Stanford shot 27.3 percent (six
of 22) from the floor in the second
half and 34 percent for the game, 16
percentage points below its season
average. The Cardinal scored only 16
field goals, more than 10 below its
season average.
The Wildcats were worse. In the
second half, they shot 25 percent

(five of 20) and turned the ball over
13 times.
Stanford slowly whittled away at
Arizona's lead and finally tied it at 43
when Earl Koberlein scored after a
missed shot. Two minutes later, at the
5:04 mark, Stanford found itself with
the ball and the game tied, 45-45.
Davis called time out and decided to

go into the delay game.
Something else Davis did down the
stretch was not substitute with his
usual regularity. In fact, except for
two brief replacements, Davis"
starters — Paye, Koberlein, Seymour,
Andy Fischer and Keith Ramee —
played the final 7:36 of the game.
"I think on purpose 1 didn't sub
much," Davis said. "That's some

thing you can do in these TV games
because there are so many time outs
and they're longer than usual."
Both tactics, the delay game and
not substituting, worked. The Card
inal went ahead, 46-45, on a free
throw by Seymour with 4:1 1 left and,
after two free throws by Koberlein
and a third by Paye, led 49-45 with
1:31 to go.

John Paye said Saturday's victory over Arizona was important to Stan
ford because the Cardinal's confidence was "dwindling."

Stanford Coach Tom Davis didn't substitute a lot near the end of the game, partly because of television
timeouts. Nevertheless, reserve forward Charles Hunt (above) played enough to score nine points.

in practice. We just made a very bad
decision on that one."
But as angry as Olson was with his
own team, he praised Stanford, espe
cially when the topic of rebounding
came up. "They killed us on the of
fensive boards in the second half," he
said while staring at the statistics
sheet, which credited Stanford with
10 offensive rebounds in the second
half and a 37-32 margin overall.
"That's the first time we've been out
rebounded in a while."
Other than the rebounding num
bers, the final statistics were, well,
ugly. Stanford shot 27.3 percent (six
of 22) from the floor in the second
half and 34 percent for the game, 16
percentage points below its season
average. The Cardinal scored only 16
field goals, more than 10 below its
season average.
The Wildcats were worse. In the
second half, they shot 25 percent

(five of 20) and turned the ball over
13 times.
Stanford slowly whittled away at
Arizona's lead and finally tied it at 43
when Earl Koberlein scored after a
missed shot. Two minutes later, at the
5:04 mark, Stanford found itself with
the ball and the game tied, 45-45.
Davis called time out and decided to

go into the delay game.
Something else Davis did down the
stretch was not substitute with his
usual regularity. In fact, except for
two brief replacements, Davis"
starters — Paye, Koberlein, Seymour,
Andy Fischer and Keith Ramee —
played the final 7:36 of the game.
"I think on purpose 1 didn't sub
much," Davis said. "That's some

thing you can do in these TV games
because there are so many time outs
and they're longer than usual."
Both tactics, the delay game and
not substituting, worked. The Card
inal went ahead, 46-45, on a free
throw by Seymour with 4:1 1 left and,
after two free throws by Koberlein
and a third by Paye, led 49-45 with
1:31 to go.

John Paye said Saturday's victory over Arizona was important to Stan
ford because the Cardinal's confidence was "dwindling."

Stanford Coach Tom Davis didn't substitute a lot near the end of the game, partly because of television
timeouts. Nevertheless, reserve forward Charles Hunt (above) played enough to score nine points.
Stanford won its first Pacific 10
Conference basketball game Satur
day afternoon. It wasn't a particularly
pretty victory, but a victory nonethe
less.
"We'll take it," Stanford Coach
Tom Davis said of the 55-51 victory
over the University of Arizona, a
team considered by many — includ
ing Davis — to be of top 20 caliber. A
Mpples Pavilion crowd of 6,209 and a
Metro Sports television audience

watched Stanford improve its record
to 9-5 overall and 1-3 in the Pac-10.
"I think this win means a lot to us,"
said John Paye, who started at guard
yesterday after starting at forward in
Thursday night's 15-point loss to
Arizona State University. "Our con
fidence was sort of dwindling, espe
cially after the Arizona State game."
Arizona Coach Lute Olson, mean
while, was rather disgusted with his
Wildcats, who dropped to 11-4 over
all and 2-1 in the Pac-10. The
Wildcats won their first two Pac-10

games by a total of three points and
their bid to win a third straight
squeaker ended when Morgan Taylor
made what Olson called a "very bad
decision."
After Wildcat guard Craig McMil
lan cut a four-point Stanford lead to
two with 14 seconds remaining, for
ward Eddie Smith fouled Paye and
sent him to the free throw line to
shoot one-and-one. Paye's free throw
was short and Arizona had a chance
to tie the game and send it into
overtime.
But instead of working the ball
inside, Taylor, a 6-foot-7 forward,
fired off an off-balance 2()-footer. It
hit nothing. Cardinal center Kent
Seymour grabbed the ball, was
fouled, hit two free throws with 0:03
to go, and Arizona had its first Pac-10
defeat.
Said Olson of his postgame talk: "I
walked into the locker room and said,
"OK, hypothetical situation: We're
down by two, and there are seven
seconds left. What do we do?' "
Olson didn't wait for an answer.
"We stick it inside," he said. "We
don't take a 20-footer. We get it
inside to Smith. We do that every day
in practice. We just made a very bad
decision on that one."
But as angry as Olson was with his
own team, he praised Stanford, espe
