# Stanford loses to Japanese gymnasts
## 
### CAROLYN TARKINGTON 
The Stanford men's gymnastics team had its first home
meet yesterday afternoon at Maples Pavilion, and the
competition brought San Jose State University and
Japan's Junior National All-Star team together in an an
nual event hosted by Stanford.
"It was unfortunate that there was not a better atten
dance," Cardinal Coach Sadao Hamada said. "It is one of
the better meets of the season."
Japan's all-star team, made up of the top high-school
gymnasts in Japan, easily won the team title with a score
of 278.65 points. The Stanford gymnasts were a bit incon

sistent with their routines, but displayed potential in their
second-place finish, with 270.40 points. San Jose State
placed third with 231.35.
Overall I was happy about our team score," Hamada
said. "Last season, we started out at about a 266; that is a
four-point improvement over last season."
Stanford's team score suffered some due to freshman
Chuck Gerardo's elbow injury. Gerardo, normally a
strong all-around competitor, was only able to compete in
two of the six events. Hamada expects that when Gerardo
is healthv and competing in the six events, Stanford's team

score will improve.
"It was too bad about Chuck," Stanford gymnast Jon
Levy said. "Had we all been healthy, we probably would
have had more team spirit."
Cardinal sophomore Randy Besosa had an excellent
overall performance and placed third in the all-around
with 55.55 points. Placing sixth in the all-around for Stan
ford was junior Jon Levy, with 54.40 points.
In the individual events for Stanford, Besosa placed
third on the pommel horse with a 9.40, and Levy was first
in the high bar and rings with a 9.65 and 9.45,

respectively. Junior Gary Smith was second on the paral- </4
lei bars with a 9.15, freshman Mike Matzeik was third in .
the rings with a 9.35, and there was a tie for first in the
vault with a 9.50 between Smith. Levy and Besosa. ,
"Our weak events are pommel horse and parallel bars," 0 "
Hamada said. "We have two weeks before our next
and we need to work on numbers of routines in order tfT' 1
improve our consistency." r
Hamada is hoping his gymnasts will be healthy for the /r
next competition. Jan. 26 against Fullerton State
sity and San Jose Mate at Maples.
