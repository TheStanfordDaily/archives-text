## Offense the problem in Cardinal's 66-51 loss 
### JOHN LIS Daily staff 
Going into Saturday's conference
opener against Fullerton State Uni
versity. Stanford women's head bas
ketball Coach Dotty McCrea said the
Cardinal would need to score 70
points to defeat the Titans.
She was right. Unfortunately for
Stanford, it fell about 20 points short
of that goal and lost to Fullerton, 66-
51, at Maples Pavilion.
The bright point for the Cardinal
was its defensive play. Stanford
switched throughout the game be
tween a man-to-man and a matchup
zone and kept the Titans off balance.
At the other end of the floor,
however, Fullerton played a tight
man-to-man, and the Stanford of
fense wilted under the pressure.
The Cardinal offense seemed in
capable of scoring. "We tried five,
six, maybe seven different things out
there," McCrea said. "We spent
three days running through things.
We added a roll to the offense, and
when we add a roll, we short out."
Stanford appeared to play 40
minutes without setting a successful
pick away from the ball, and move
ment away from the ball was minimal
until a player stopped her dribble and
was in danger of a five-second call.
"No one waited for the screens,"
McCrea said.
"It's the difference between a good
team and a bad team," guard Virginia
Sourlis said. There's only one player
with the ball — the other four need to
move with purpose. We have to learn
to move without the ball.
"We didn't seem to be able to get
some flow. They forced us out of our
offense, forced us to go one-on-one."
Whenever a defense has done that

this Reason, the Cardinal has had
trouble. "Our players don't play one
on-one," McCrea said./ They're too
busy with the offense that they don't
look for opportunities to score. There
are too many people out there who
don't look to be threats, they just run
through the offense.
"You can teach defense. Offense is
experience and instinct, which we
lack. We want to run the offense. We
don't want to play offense. There's a
big difference."
Stanford Asst. Coach Eileen Roche
said. "We get caught up — we think
too much. We get too involved with
running the offense."
Sourlis finished with 15 points to
lead the Cardinal, and forward Mary
Bradach had 13 points before fouling
out late in the game. Forward Kami
Anderson, Stanford's leading scorer
this year, was just under her average
of 13.7 points, finishing with 12
points and eight rebounds.
Stanford jumped out to an early 8-
2 lead in the first four minutes, then
the Cardinal went into its prevent df
fense. Fullerton ran off 10 straight
points and never looked back.
Stanford only trailed at halftime
26-22, thanks largely to the Titans'
34-percent shooting effort from the
field and in spite of the Cardinal's 29-
percent showing from the free throw
line. In the second half, Fullerton for
ward Meg Gallagher scored 15 of her
game-high 19 points, and the Titans
shot 74 percent from the field.
The Fullerton defense forced Stan
ford to commit 22 turnovers and held
the Cardinal to 38-percent shooting.
With the loss, Stanford is 0-1 in the
Western Collegiate Athletic Associa
tion, and 5-8 overall. Fullerton is 1-0
in conference, 10-4 overall.
