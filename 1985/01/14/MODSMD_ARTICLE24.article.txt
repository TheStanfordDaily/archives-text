## 
### INGRID SEYER Staff sports writer 
The Stanford men's swimming
team paced itself to victory yesterday
in the Stanford Relays, finishing with
1 56 points. The University of Califor
nia at Berkeley was second with 128
points, followed by the University of
Puget Sound with 103.
In the women's competition, Cal
outscored Stanford, 164-140 to win
the meet. Puget Sound was third with
59 points.
Cardinal men's Coach Skip Kenney
was pleased with his team's perfor
mance but felt his swimmers' times
could have been better.
"This meet really showed how im
portant mental preparation is for
swimmers," Kenney said. "Everyone
swam hard, but most of the men
weren't swimming fast enough be
cause they hadn't psyched themselves
up for the meet."
Stanford will travel to the Univer
sity of Arizona and Arizona State
University next weekend, and Ken
ney has hopes for much better times
at those meets.
"We are going to have to swim
much faster against the Arizona
schools if we want to win," Kenney
said. "1 know the guys can swim
faster if they get their heads better set
for the meets."
Kenney said he was especially
pleased with the performance of

sophomore Pablo Morales, who
anchored the winning 400-yard indi
vidual medley relay to a time of 3
minutes. 31.2 seconds. Morales was
joined on this relay by juniors John
Moffet and Dave Reynolds and fresh
man Sean Murphy.
"Pablo (Morales) anchored the
relay and really pulled off the victory
for us." Kenney said. "Pablo also
swam the 100-yard butterfly very
well in the 400-yard butterfly and
medley relays."
Two freshmen. Julie Miller and
Stephanie Norton, swam well for
Stanford in the women's competition.
Miller swam on the victorious 400-
yard backstroke relay (4:02.92) and
on the 200-yard freestyle and individ
ual medley relays.
Norton swam the butterfly leg of
the 200-yard medley relay and com
peted on the winning 400-ya~d but
terfly (3:56.27) and 1,600-yard
freestyle (16:09.71) relays.
"Both Miller and Norton are com
ing along great this season." Asst.
Coach Kathy Nelson said. "Diane
Zock has also been improving a great
deal and swam very well in the relays
for us."
Zock swam on the first-place 800-
yard freestyle relay (7:37.34) and on
the 500-yard freestyle relay.
The women's team will also be
competing at Arizona and Arizona
State next weekend.
