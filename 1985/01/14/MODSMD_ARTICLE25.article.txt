## Fencers beat Santa Cruz for 2nd time 
### ERIK ESELIUS Staff sports writer 
The Stanford men's and
women's fencing teams both im
proved their records to 4-0,
defeating the University of Cali
fornia at Santa Cruz, 18-9 and 9-
7, respectively.
Jennifer Yu and Holly Taylor
paved the way for the Cardinal
women, combining for seven vic
tories in the foil competition. Yu
extended her season record to 16-
0, and according to Stanford Head
Coach Buzz Hurst, "had no trou
ble at all" in Saturday's match.
Hurst was also pleased with the
performance of Taylor, who in
spite of a sprained ankle that lim
ited her mobility, managed to
record three victories during the
competition.
"Jennifer and Holly are the
backbone of the team," Hurst
said. "The other three girls do not
have very much experience. I ex
pect Jennifer and Holly to produce
most of the victories. They are car
rying most of the load. How we do
in the NCAAs (National Col
legiate Athletic Association cham
pionships) will depend on how
much experience the other girls
get."
Hurst expressed some disap
pointment about the closeness of
the match, hoping to have ex
panded upon a previous 10-6 vic
tory over the same Santa Cruz

team.
"I thought we'd get a more
lopsided score than we did." Hurst
said. "I expected a few more vic
tories. Nevertheless, we main
tained our performance."
The Cardinal men's team, on
the other hand, convincingly im
proved upon its earlier 14-13 vic
tory, getting 6-3 victories in the
foil, saber and epee competitions.
"I was really surprised by how
much we dominated them," Hurst
said." We didn't expect that strong
a victory. We started off strong
and kept up the momentum."
Foil and epee captains Elliot
Cheu and Chris McConnell both
had 3-0 records in their respective
events. Saber captain Andy
Goorno compiled a 2-1 record, his
loss coming on a questionable call.
Hurst said.
"I thought Andy fenced ex
tremely well," Hurst said. "1 was
pleased with his performance.
And of course Elliot Cheu and
Chris McConnell — their records
speak for themselves."
Hurst praised "the overall solid
performance" of the Cardinal
men's and women's teams, espe
cially against a strong team such as
Santa Cruz, ranked fourth in the
national club rankings.
