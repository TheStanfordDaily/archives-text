# Depleted wrestling team gets 5th in nine-squad Eagle Invitational
## 
### PETER CASTILLO Staff sports writer 
The Eagle Invitational at Biola University Satur
day gave some second-string Stanford wrestlers a
valuable chance to compete because illness and
fatigue from an intense schedule forced some
starters to remain home.
As a result, the Cardinal placed fifth in a nine
team field behind champion San Jose State Univer
sity.
"The team performance was OK, hut it did not
show to the other teams the progress Stanford has
made." Cardinal Coach Chris Horpel said. "This
tournament was more to identify weaknesses and
problem areas to work on and to keep the second
stringers ready."
Stanford freshman B.G. Porter (118 pounds)
registered his first collegiate victory with a pin over
Belizario Magana from La Verne College and
eventually placed sixth. Neil Wartnik faced tough

competition at 126 pounds and took fourth. The
only Stanford wrestler not to place was reserve
Reggie Kellum (134 pounds), who was filling in for
Jeff Bradley.
In a come-from-behind victory. Jeff Hazard (142
pounds) pinned No. 1 seed Brian Rognholt from
Adams State College of Southern Colorado 5
minutes and 22 seconds into the match. Later, Haz
ard lost to Ken Bryson of San Jose State 19-2 for
fourth place.
Scott Wiggen, a 1 50-pounder, lost his first match
but proceeded to pin his next opponent. Wiggen
lost to Rick Willets from Adams State, 12-8, and
took fourth place.
Tom Mullen (177 pounds) decided to compete
despite a nagging illness. In the finals against San
Jose State's Don Knox, the match ended, 7-7, and
went into overtime. The overtime proved to be too
much for Mullen because of his illness and he lost,
1-0, taking second place.

Reserve lerry Mclntyre (190 pounds) lost his
first match to eventual champion Tim Gleeson of
Fullerton State University, 8-5, but won his next
two matches to capture third in a bright spot for the
Cardinal.
"It is not easy to be ready as a second stringer
and, thus, this tournament was a worthwhile exper
ience," Horpel said. "It is hard for the second
stringers to be motivated to do the extra work the
starters do, for they are not the No. 1 wrestlers.
"I am scheduling more of these tournaments to
keep the reserves ready since it is difficult to step
in."
Heavyweight Frank Lyles appears to have a
more serious illness than previously thought and is
questionable for matches at San Francisco State
University Thursday and at Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo Friday. Lyles captured fourth, but ap
peared weaker as the meet progressed.
