## Supervising the Super Bowl, Earl's way 
### EUGENE CHEN 
Earl Edwards stands at his post at
the Stanford Stadium and oversees a
relatively tranquil site. Except for
answering the questions of a dozen or
so visitors, today Edwards' job is
routine.
Today, Edwards may even have the
opportunity to greet all visitors who
enter the stadium.
But come Super Bowl Sunday
things will change for Edwards. As
the supervisor of sporting events, he
will he in charge of maintaining order
in and around the stadium. On Super
Sunday, Edwards will only meet the
unruly visitors as he attempts to con
trol the madness of a crowd of
85,000.
In addition to supervising the
crowd, Edwards will also coordinate
about two dozen fellow Stanford se
curity men who will keep anxious fans
off the field. The red-jacketed Stan
ford security men will be joined by
NFL. security guards and the Stanford
police in their efforts.
Visitors who encounter Edwards
will meet a tall, dignified man with
graying hair. He proudly wears his
red Stanford jacket and sunglasses.
He holds a black, cackling walkie
talkie.
This is the fourteenth year that he's
worked on stadium security. "It's not
for the money, because I do it for
nothing. I just love sports," he said.
Stanford Stadium is a special place
for Edwards, who has been living in
Sunnyvale with his wife Liz since
1946. "I love the stadium. Anyplace
in the stadium you go, you get a good
seat," he said.
Edwards has fond memories of the
stadium. "I'll never forget that 35 or
36 years ago, I used to bring my son
to every game when he was still in
diapers." As his son Ron has grown.

Edwards has seen many great games
at Stanford. Ron now has little time
to attend Stanford games; he is a
company vice president and high
school football coach. But father Earl
still passionately roots for Stanford
teams.

"One thing I'll never forget," said
Edwards, "is the time back in the 50s
when Stanford got beat by UCLA 72-
0. Then, naturally, [there are] all the
(University of) California-Stanford
Big Games I've been attending for 25
years."

Edwards has been in some big
games himself, as coach and player.
"I played basketball at Kansas Uni
versity from 1939 until the war broke
out. I went on a basketball scholar
ship. I was a forward. I'm only 6-2,
hut in those days I was big — I played

center and forward, " he said.
"We held records in the country in
basketball in those days — even after
that. You see. Wilt Chamberlain
played at KU, but way after me."
After graduation and some time in
the service. Edwards worked for the
American Can Company in San Jose,
where he worked as supervisor. After
thirty-five years in the company, he
retired in 1976.
It seems that Edwards just can't
seem to get away from being a super
visor. But his activities are not limited
to supervising.
What does he do now in addition to
stadium security?
"During the weekdays I have a
part-time job. I'm also the site direc
tor for the Central Coast Section
High Schools, which stretch from
Palo Alto to the Monterey Bay area,"
he said. "In all athletics, all champi
onship games — whether it's football,
baseball, track or basketball — I'm
the site director. I have to be there to
make sure that everything is taken
care of at all the big championship
playoffs."
On weekends when the stadium
hosts a game, Edwards starts his day
early. "I'm in charge of the main gate
out here; that's No. 2 gate. I come in
at approximately 6:30 in the morning
and open it up for the vending trucks.
"When the game starts, I turn it
over to another person and stay on
the football field. I keep the people
who aren't supposed to be there off
the field."
Of course, Edwards looks forward
to working on Super Bowl Sunday.
"I've never been to a Super Bowl yet.
I've been to a lot of bowl games, but
this will be my first Super Bowl," he
said.
Working this Sunday will present
Edwards with special challenges.

"The Super Bowl is just in a class by
itself as far as people." said Edwards.
"I know they're going to have a lot of
security, hut I still say that if the 49ers
win. they'll never lie able to keep the
fans off the field."
Edwards notes the changes being
made in the field. "There was a fence
all the way around here (the field)
and they took it out until the Super
Bowl is over. This is why 1 say they'll
never keep them (the fans) off the
field.
"For example, look at what hapf
pened with the 49ers and Chicago,
how they swarmed down on the field
even with the police officers, horses
and everything. They even had a
fence to go over. Security couldn't
stop them there, so how are they
going to stop fans here, especially if
the 49ers win it'.'"
What happens if it rains, given the
NFL's no-umbrella policy?
"I kind of agree with it." said Ed
wards. "If it weren't the Super Bowl,
then I'd say 'no' to it. but the Super
Bowl with the alcohol and stuff like
that and the way people are. well,
they're liable to hit you over the head
or anything else with the umbrella. A
lot of them wouldn't be very polite."
His prediction for the game: "I'll
take the 49ers. That'll be a very smalt
margin, say maybe three points at the
most."
Regardless of whether his Niners
win or lose, after the game has been
played and the audience and actors*
have exited from the stage, Stanford
Stadium will revert to its former self.
But with the opening kick-off of
next fall's football season. Edwards
will once again be on security duty,
doing what he loves to do. By that
time, the "not very polite" fans that;
Edwards deals with this Sunday will
be only a memory.

wards. "If it weren't the Super Bowl,
then I'd say 'no' to it. but the Super
Bowl with the alcohol and stuff like
that and the way people are. well,
they're liable to hit you over the head
or anything else with the umbrella. A
lot of them wouldn't be very polite."
His prediction for the game: "I'll
take the 49ers. That'll be a very smalt
margin, say maybe three points at the
most."
Regardless of whether his Niners
win or lose, after the game has been
played and the audience and actors*
have exited from the stage, Stanford
Stadium will revert to its former self.
But with the opening kick-off of
next fall's football season. Edwards
will once again be on security duty,
doing what he loves to do. By that
time, the "not very polite" fans that;
Edwards deals with this Sunday will
be only a memory.

Who is that man behind those shades? He is a person one probably does not want to meet at the Super Bowl
this Sunday. Earl Edwards, head supervisor for Stanford Stadium sporting events for the past 14 years, con
trols rowdy crowds here.
Earl Edwards stands at his post at
the Stanford Stadium and oversees a
relatively tranquil site. Except for
answering the questions of a dozen or
so visitors, today Edwards' job is
routine.
Today, Edwards may even have the
opportunity to greet all visitors who
enter the stadium.
But come Super Bowl Sunday
things will change for Edwards. As
the supervisor of sporting events, he
will he in charge of maintaining order
in and around the stadium. On Super
Sunday, Edwards will only meet the
unruly visitors as he attempts to con
trol the madness of a crowd of
85,000.
In addition to supervising the
crowd, Edwards will also coordinate
about two dozen fellow Stanford se
curity men who will keep anxious fans
off the field. The red-jacketed Stan
ford security men will be joined by
NFL. security guards and the Stanford
police in their efforts.
Visitors who encounter Edwards
will meet a tall, dignified man with
graying hair. He proudly wears his
red Stanford jacket and sunglasses.
He holds a black, cackling walkie
talkie.
This is the fourteenth year that he's
worked on stadium security. "It's not
for the money, because I do it for
nothing. I just love sports," he said.
Stanford Stadium is a special place
for Edwards, who has been living in
Sunnyvale with his wife Liz since
1946. "I love the stadium. Anyplace
in the stadium you go, you get a good
seat," he said.
Edwards has fond memories of the
stadium. "I'll never forget that 35 or
36 years ago, I used to bring my son
to every game when he was still in
diapers." As his son Ron has grown.

Edwards has seen many great games
at Stanford. Ron now has little time
to attend Stanford games; he is a
company vice president and high
school football coach. But father Earl
still passionately roots for Stanford
teams.

"One thing I'll never forget," said
Edwards, "is the time back in the 50s
when Stanford got beat by UCLA 72-
0. Then, naturally, [there are] all the
(University of) California-Stanford
Big Games I've been attending for 25
years."

Edwards has been in some big
games himself, as coach and player.
"I played basketball at Kansas Uni
versity from 1939 until the war broke
out. I went on a basketball scholar
ship. I was a forward. I'm only 6-2,
hut in those days I was big — I played

center and forward, " he said.
"We held records in the country in
basketball in those days — even after
that. You see. Wilt Chamberlain
played at KU, but way after me."
After graduation and some time in
the service. Edwards worked for the
American Can Company in San Jose,
where he worked as supervisor. After
thirty-five years in the company, he
retired in 1976.
It seems that Edwards just can't
seem to get away from being a super
visor. But his activities are not limited
to supervising.
What does he do now in addition to
stadium security?
"During the weekdays I have a
part-time job. I'm also the site direc
tor for the Central Coast Section
High Schools, which stretch from
Palo Alto to the Monterey Bay area,"
he said. "In all athletics, all champi
onship games — whether it's football,
baseball, track or basketball — I'm
the site director. I have to be there to
make sure that everything is taken
care of at all the big championship
playoffs."
On weekends when the stadium
hosts a game, Edwards starts his day
early. "I'm in charge of the main gate
out here; that's No. 2 gate. I come in
at approximately 6:30 in the morning
and open it up for the vending trucks.
"When the game starts, I turn it
over to another person and stay on
the football field. I keep the people
who aren't supposed to be there off
the field."
Of course, Edwards looks forward
to working on Super Bowl Sunday.
"I've never been to a Super Bowl yet.
I've been to a lot of bowl games, but
this will be my first Super Bowl," he
said.
Working this Sunday will present
Edwards with special challenges.

"The Super Bowl is just in a class by
itself as far as people." said Edwards.
"I know they're going to have a lot of
security, hut I still say that if the 49ers
win. they'll never lie able to keep the
fans off the field."
Edwards notes the changes being
made in the field. "There was a fence
all the way around here (the field)
and they took it out until the Super
Bowl is over. This is why 1 say they'll
never keep them (the fans) off the
field.
"For example, look at what hapf
pened with the 49ers and Chicago,
how they swarmed down on the field
even with the police officers, horses
and everything. They even had a
fence to go over. Security couldn't
stop them there, so how are they
going to stop fans here, especially if
the 49ers win it'.'"
What happens if it rains, given the
NFL's no-umbrella policy?
"I kind of agree with it." said Ed
wards. "If it weren't the Super Bowl,
then I'd say 'no' to it. but the Super
Bowl with the alcohol and stuff like
that and the way people are. well,
they're liable to hit you over the head
