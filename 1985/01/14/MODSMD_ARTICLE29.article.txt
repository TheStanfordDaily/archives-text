# Testing at SRI
## Gas unnerves Menlo Park 
### BAIE NETZER Senior staff writer 
In the wake of a recent television
broadcast dealing with nerve gas test
ing, a number of Menlo Park resi
dents have expressed surprise and
concern.
While reporting on protests by
Massachusetts residents against the
Arthur D. Little Co., an organization
conducting nerve gas tests, an ABC
"20/20" broadcast revealed Menlo
Park as another site of nerve gas re
search.
SRI International of Menlo Park, a
private non-profit organization for
merly affiliated with the University, is
one of 12 U.S. companies conducting
nerve gas research under U.S. Army
contracts.
Nerve gas is a colorless, odorless
chemical compound invented by the
Germans in the 19305. The gas kills
humans through skin contact or in
halation.
According to SRI spokesman Paul
Shay, SRI is not producing nerve gas
but is instead testing for chemical
agents to combat the gas. Shay said
no more than half a thimbleful of the
gas is kept on SRI premises.

After student demonstrations pro
testing courier-insurgency research,
the University severed its relations
with SRI — then the Stanford Re
search Institute — in 1970. SRI now
has its own board of directors and
board of trustees.
Because of the new attention focused
on SRI nerve gas testing, residents
are now questioning whether the tests
are safe for the community and
whether the city government ever ap
proved the tests.
At the time the tests were set up
two years ago, the Menlo Park police
and fire department were notified
and a senior member of city govern
ment was briefed. Shay said.
However, Menlo Park City
Manager Mike Bedwell said city ap
proval for the testing was never given.
"There was never any formal ap
proval, and it never came before the
council as an official item," Bedwell
said.
According to the city's community
development department, Menlo
Park ordinances require city use
permits for the building of laborato
ries to use toxic materials but not for
the testing of specific toxic materials.

SRI was granted a use-permit for the
building of a toxic-material labora
tory. Bedwell said.
Since the SRI nerve gas research
has gained publicity. Menlo Park
Mayor Jack Morris has asked the city
planning commission to investigate
giving the city greater control over
toxic-material testing within city
limits.
"It's important to find out what
kind of verification we had." Bedwell
said. "If they informed the mayor, it
could have been any of three or four
people, one of whom is now dead."
A number of concerned and
surprised local residents have phoned
SRI and local papers to find out more
about the testing going on in Menlo
Park. Most seem never to have
known such tests were being con
ducted.
Carolyn Grundt, a Menlo Park res
ident, said she was shocked when she
watched the December "20/20"
broadcast.
"I was sitting listening to some
thing going on in Cambridge when all
of a sudden I hear them say "Menlo
Park is also doing these tests,' " she
said.

Grundt said she is concerned about
the gas leaking out into the air and is
not sure the tests are completely safe
for the community.
According to Shay. SRI has taken a
number of security precautions to
ensure safe testing conditions.
"We made a decision not to do any
research for which substantial
amounts of the agent were required,"
he said.
Of the half-thimbleful of nerve gas
kept on SRI premises. Shay said only
one-thousandth of that amount is
used in an experiment. When not in
use. the gas is kept frozen at minus 20
degrees centigrade, where it is inert.
SRI is also refusing to reveal the
exact location of the nerve-gas labo
ratory within its Menlo Park complex,
the names of the researchers involved
or the exact chemicals that form
nerve gas.
Shay said the nerve gas is usually
brought to SRI once a year in an
armored truck and is escorted by the
California Highway Patrol.
"We're not conducting the tests on
any sort of animal or insect either,"
Shay said. "All the testing is on
enzymes."

Carolyn Grundt, a Menlo Park res
ident, said she was shocked when she
watched the December "20/20"
broadcast.
"I was sitting listening to some
thing going on in Cambridge when all
of a sudden I hear them say "Menlo
Park is also doing these tests,' " she
said.

Grundt said she is concerned about
the gas leaking out into the air and is
not sure the tests are completely safe
for the community.
According to Shay. SRI has taken a
number of security precautions to
ensure safe testing conditions.
"We made a decision not to do any
research for which substantial
amounts of the agent were required,"
he said.
Of the half-thimbleful of nerve gas
kept on SRI premises. Shay said only
one-thousandth of that amount is
used in an experiment. When not in
use. the gas is kept frozen at minus 20
degrees centigrade, where it is inert.
SRI is also refusing to reveal the
exact location of the nerve-gas labo
ratory within its Menlo Park complex,
the names of the researchers involved
or the exact chemicals that form
nerve gas.
Shay said the nerve gas is usually
brought to SRI once a year in an
armored truck and is escorted by the
California Highway Patrol.
"We're not conducting the tests on
any sort of animal or insect either,"
Shay said. "All the testing is on
enzymes."
