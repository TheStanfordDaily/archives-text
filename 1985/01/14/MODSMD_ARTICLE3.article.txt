# SCIRE to end
## New program starts in fall 
### R. TAEZA PIERCE Staff writer 
In a decision aimed at streamlining
extra-departmental programs here,
the University has announced plans
to dissolve the Student Center for In
novation in Research and Education
(SCIRE) and the Stanford
Workshops on Political and Social Is
sues
The decision, announced by Asso
ciate Dean of Humanities and
Sciences Carolyn Lougee, also calls
for the dismantling of of the Under
graduate Special Program (UGS), the
Action Research Liaison Office
(ARLO) and Undergraduate Re
search Opportunities (URO), effec
tive Sept. 1.
Lougee said the University will
create a single extra-departmental
agency, absorbing SWOPSI and
UGS. "Experimental and student
initiated courses as well as social and
political workshops will continue to
be a priority of this new agency,"
Lougee said in a release.
In addition, she said a
"consolidated network of internship
opportunities" will replace SCIRE
and ARLO. "Specially designated
staff in URO, Public Service Center
and CPPC (Career Planning and
Placement Center)" will take over
identifying internships and matching
students with them â€” functions cur
rently in the hands of SCIRE and
ARLO, Lougee said.
According to Lougee, credit will no
longer be available for internships
themselves, although "students may
seek accreditation from faculty mem
bers according to regular departmen
tal procedures."
The Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (C-US) reviews extra
departmental programs periodically.
In the fall of 1983-84, SCIRE,
SWOPSI, UGS, ARLO and URO
came up for review.
In response to the C-US request,
the dean ol Humanities and Sciences
appointed a committee, headed by
Economics Prof. Kenneth Arrow, to
look into the functioning of the pro
grams.
The announced changes are the
result of a year-long investigation
into the five extra-departmental pro
grams by the Arrow committee,
which issued its report at the end of
summer quarter.
Arrow said the group "felt the pro
gram (SWOPSI) had been supplying
a great deal of valuable material," but
the committee was concerned about
the perception that SWOPSI and
UGS courses "were not as rigorous
and demanding" academically as
other Stanford courses.
The committee also
"recommended internships be re
allocated and ... [a] strengthening of
the Undergraduate Research Office,"
he said.
Although Arrow stressed that in

ternships are valuable resources, he
said that "attempting to give credit
for them as such really spoils them."
He said he feels having an academic
constraint like a paper imposed in or
der for credit to be granted would
detract from the internship experi
ence.
Change spawns debate
Criticism of the proposed changes
in extradepartmental programs has
centered around the dissolution of
SCIRE, SWOPSI. UGS and ARLO.
Eric Berg, ASSU Senate chairman,
expressed concern that efforts to in-

crease the academic rigor of ex
tradepartmental programs might take
away from what makes SWOPSI and
UGS special.
Berg and other critics of the change
said they fear changing the programs
to make their requirements similar to
those of other Stanford courses might
alter the focus on student leadership
and participation that has character
ized the programs.
Berg said he is "concerned that the
distinct focus on social and political
issues be preserved" within the new
structure.
He also said, "I'm not convinced
eliminating SCIRE is going to im
prove the quality," of the internship
program. Berg said he feels SCIRE
"was doing a good job," and is not
sure such a major restructuring was
necessary.
"One of the concerns the senate
expressed," was that relying on
departmental accreditation for in
ternships "might create disparities
between students in different depart
ments doing the same type of intern
ships."
Berg cited the Communication
Department as an example, saying
that traditionally, only communica
tion majors could get credit for in
ternships through the department.
Under the new structure, it might be
possible for an English major and a
communication major to do the
