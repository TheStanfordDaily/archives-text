The Stanford East African Relief Organiza
tion (SEARO) held a "March on Hunger" yes
terday afternoon to aid the starving peoples of
drought-stricken East African nations.
The march, which originated in downtown
Palo Alto, ran down Palm Drive and culminated
in a brief program in Memorial Church. It was
composed of Stanford students, off-campus
supporters of SEARO and community people,
many of whom joined the march while it was in
progress.
Marchers carried signs bearing such slogans
as "Starvation is a painful death, and "Love is
helping the hungry." Also, the march received a
surprise donation of a 20-foot inflatable whale
reading "Save the humans."
The program at the church consisted of brief
presentations from representatives of the Ethi
opian Famine Relief Committee, The American
Red Cross, the Stanford African Students Asso
ciation (SASA) and SEARO, a performance by
the Stanford Gospel Choir and a keynote ad

dress from the Rev. Cecil Williams of San Fran
cisco.
The main thrust of the speeches was to en
courage donations to organizations dedicated to
aiding famine victims in East Africa. Awetu
Simesso, a graduate student in political science
and a founder of SEARO, made a special ap
peal to the Africans in the audience.
"If our people are starving, then there is
nothing, to my thinking, that would take more
importance than this simple issue of human
life," Simesso said. He urged, along with SASA
President Joseph Rugumyamheto. the pursuit
of a long-term cure as well as hunger relief in
the short run.
Williams, the keynote speaker, pushed for a
reassessment of the agenda of the "haves." He
suggested that the primary goal of this agenda
should be the elimination of famine. He also
suggested that a "new kind of compassion" be
developed so that disasters like today's drought
need not reach astronomical proportions before
people become aware of them and begin to
help.
