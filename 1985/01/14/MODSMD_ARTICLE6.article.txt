Kennedy cancels final speech
SOWE I O, South Africa — Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.), fearing
a fight between rival black political factions, canceled the speech here
yesterday that was to have been the climax of his trip to South Africa
aimed at rallying American opinion against this country's apartheid sys
tem of racial segregation.
As angry members of the United Democratic Front and the rival
Azanian People's Organization stood nose to nose, their fists in the air
and threatening to battle in front of the altar of Regina Mundi Catholic
Church, Bishop Desmond Tutu, the Nobel peace laureate, announced
that Kennedy would not come lest his speech provoke violence.
Although the 200 protesters from the militant Azanian People's Or
ganization were outnumbered 10 to 1 by Tutu's supporters, the black pre
late — and Kennedy's American and South African bodyguards —
judged the situation far too volatile to let the senator speak in this
sprawling black suburb of Johannesburg.
"I regret very much that 1 was unable to speak at Soweto," Kennedy
said at the Johannesburg airport before leaving for I.usaka, Zambia. He
said he had been warned that his appearance in Soweto would probably
provoke violent clashes between the two groups and that there was a
serious danger not only to himself but to the 2,500 people attending the
rally.
For Kennedy, it was an ignominious end to his eight-day visit, a trip he
hopes will mobilize Americans for a campaign against apartheid and end
the Reagan Administration's policy of "constructive engagement"
toward the white minority regime here.
For I utu. the Anglican bishop of Johannesburg, it was a humiliation,
for he was unable to fill the church with his supporters and unable to
command even a minimum of respect from rivals within the black com
munity.
But for the Azanian People's Organization, a militant "black con
sciousness" group that opposed Kennedy's trip from the outset and
demonstrated almost daily against him. it was a success that will make
the organization, with its black nationalist and increasingly socialist
ideology, a much greater force on the political scene here.
Israeli cabinet ponders pullout
JERUSALEM — Israel's four-month-old national unity Cabinet yes
terday opened perhaps its most crucial deliberations so far, debating for
six hours a plan submitted by Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin for a uni
lateral troop withdrawal from Lebanon.
The discussions were secret, but Cabinet sources said that under
Rabin's recommendation, the first phase of a three-stage pullout could
begin as soon as three weeks.
Completion of the troop pullout would depend in part on develop
ments after each stage, but the goal would reportedly be to bring home
the vast majority of Israeli troops within nine months, bringing to an end
this country's longest and most divisive war.
A Cabinet source, alluding to Israel's inability to conclude a pullout
agreement with the Beirut government in months of negotiations,
remarked after yesterday's meeting: "It looks that even a bad agreement
(on troop withdrawal), but (one) still reasonable for Israel, cannot be
achieved."
The ministers are to resume their debate this afternoon, and the
Cabinet hopes to approve the phased withdrawal plan by the end of the
day. About half the Cabinet's members spoke on the question yesterday,
with a long list of speakers scheduled for today's meeting, the sources
said.
Support for the proposal reportedly cuts across party lines, and Israel
radio reported last night that despite the opposition of some ministers, a
clear majority appears ready to vote for it.
The continuing debate means that Israel again today will not return to
the stalemated pullout talks with Lebanon at the southern Lebanese
town of Naqoura. The Israelis previously stayed away from the session
last Thursday. The talks, which are being held under U.N. auspices, were
intended to try to achieve a bilateral accord on a system of security ar
rangements to go into place in southern Lebanon after an Israeli
withdrawal.
The security arrangements would offer protection for northern Israeli
settlements against any resumption of terrorist attacks and ensure
against an outbreak of factional bloodshed among southern Lebanon's
Muslim, Druse and Christian populations in the vacuum that would be
left by an Israeli pullout.
Israel proposed at Naqoura that a combination of U.N. troops and the
largely Christian South Lebanon Army — a militia trained, armed and
paid by Israel — take control of the region from which the Israelis will be
pulling back. But Beirut insisted that the regular Lebanese Army is ca
pable of taking full control of the south.
At least 150 die in train fire
DHAKA, Bangladesh — At least 150 persons were either burned or
suflocated to death and more than 100 others injured as a fire engulfed
three compartments of an express train-near Bheramara, about 210
miles west of here early yesterday.
A railway spokesman said that 55 bodies had been counted, but the
toll was expected to rise much higher. The fire reportedly broke out
before dawn when most of the passengers were sleeping on the Simanta
Express, which was traveling between Khulna, a southern port city, and
Parbatipur town in the north.
Survivors and police officials estimated about 150 deaths, dozens of
whom died while jumping in panic from the blazing train. There were
about 400 passengers in the three compartments that caught fire.
Rear Admiral Sultan Ahmed, the minister of communications, and
senior railway officials flew to the accident site in the afternoon and also
visited the injured being treated for serious burns in local hospitals.
The government has ordered an investigation in to what is said to be
the worst railway disaster in the past year. An electrical short circuit may
have caused the blaze, authorities said.
Diablo proposal faces hearing
SAN FRANCISCO — Attorney General John Van de Kamp's pro
posal to forbid participants in the Diablo Canyon rate case from contact
ing Public Utilities Commission members outside the hearings goes
before a hearing officer today.
I"he unusual ban. which Van de Kamp says would promote fairness
and public confidence in the multibillion-dollar proceedings, is endorsed
by the PUC's consumer advocate staff but opposed by a private con
sumer leader as well as Pacific Gas & Electric Co.
1 he first of two reactors in the long-delayed nuclear power plant on
the San Luis Obispo County coast is scheduled to begin full commercial
operation at the end of February, but it may be two years before the
PUC decides how much of the cost can be passed along to ratepayers.
PG&E wants to charge the entire $5.4 billion cost of the plant to its
3.6 million customers over 30 years, starting with an increase of $353
million this year, or $2.48 in the average monthly electric bill. The com
mission must decide how much of the cost was "reasonable and pru
dent" and can be included in rates.
The PUC is required to base its decision on evidence at the hearings,
but commissioners and their staff are not prohibited from talking to par
ticipants outside the public sessions.
Van de Kamp, w ho says he is taking part in the case as a public adv
ocate to argue against excessive rates, has proposed forbidding any com
munication about the case outside the hearings between any participant
and any of the five PUC members, their staff or the administrative law
judge who is holding the fact-finding hearings.
With so much money at stake, "public confidence in the fairness of the
proceeding must be of paramount concern," Van de Kamp said in his
proposal. He said it would "remove any doubt that the Diablo Canyon
decision will be based solely on the official record and that all parties will
have fair and equal access to the decision makers."
The proposal was endorsed last week by the PUC's "public" staff,
which was organized last July to represent consumer interests and is ar
guing against the rate increase proposed by PG&E.
