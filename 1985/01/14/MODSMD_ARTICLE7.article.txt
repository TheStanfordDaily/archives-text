# Gromyko attacks 'Star Wars'
## 
### 
MOSCOW — Soviet Foreign Mini
ster Andrei Gromyko said yesterday
that no agreement on reducing nu
clear weapons is possible unless the
United States accepts limitations on
space weapons.
Launching a strong attack on Presi
dent Reagan's plan, nicknamed "Star
Wars," to conduct research on a sys
tem to defend the United States
against enemy ballistic missiles in
space, Gromyko said that it would
put the Soviet Union at an unaccepta
ble military disadvantage.
"This plan, frankly speaking, is an
aggressive plan," Gromyko said in an
extraordinary television interview
that was broadcast to the United
States as well as throughout the So
viet Union. "We will fight to the end
on this matter."
Me also warned that continued
deployment of U.S. Pershing 2 and
cruise missiles under a NATO pro
gram in Western Europe would
jeopardize the new set of arms con
trol negotiations agreed upon by
Gromyko and Secretary of State
George Shultz in Geneva last week.
Pershing 2 and cruise missiles are
intermediate-range weapons being
sited to counter Soviet deployment of
SS-20 missiles targeted on Western
Europe.

In addition, Gromyko said, if the
United States were to test anti
satellite weapons while the negotia
tions are under way, "the talks would
he torpedoed. ... We made such a
warning to the American representa
tives."
If an accord is reached on space
weapons, he said, the Soviet Union
would be prepared to make "sharp
reductions" in intercontinental ballis
tic missiles on the basis of equality
and equal security.
"On the other hand, if there were
no advancement on the issues of
outer space, it would be superfluous
to discuss the possibility of reducing
strategic (intercontinental-range)
armaments," he added.
Gromyko said that negotiations re
sulting from last week's Geneva
agreement would not succeed unless
there is "simultaneous and inter
related" progress on strategic
missiles, intermediate-range missiles
and space issues.
But Gromyko, the 75-year-old
master of Kremlin foreign policy,
praised the overall outcome at
Geneva in the first detailed report on
the talks that has been made to the
Soviet people.
"On the whole, we evaluate the
results of that meeting in a positive

light," he said. But he added that the
discussions were "not easy at all" and
sometimes became tense, although
"we did not bang our fists on the
table."
Gromyko. wearing a dark suit and
tie. was questioned by four journalists
for an hour and 50 minutes in a rare
discussion of policy by a member of
the ruling Politburo.
But he was not grilled in the style
of U.S. television interview programs,
although some of the questioners
mentioned arguments that have been
raised by U.S. officials. No one asked,
however, about the Soviet anti
satellite weapons system during the
lengthy discussion of space warfare.
In Washington, Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger immediately
denied that current space defense re
search, or future weapons based on
that research, can be bargained away,
and he accused Gromyko of introduc
ing a new condition — parallel prog
ress in all the talks — even before the
negotiations begin.
"We approach these talks with a
completely undetermined, free
agenda," Weinberger said on the
CBS television program. "Face the
Nation."
In a more relaxed vein. Secretary
of State George Shultz said "it

remains to he seen" whether the
Soviets will insist on parallel progress
on space defense arms — which Mos
cow most wants to curb — and offen
sive weapons, which are prime targets
of U.S. negotiators.
During the Geneva meeting last
week, he said. Gromyko made a
similar statement about firm
"linkage" between offensive and de
fensive talks. "And then he
(Gromyko) proceeded to list a lot of
exceptions" where agreements could
be reached — and presumably signed
and put into effect — independent of
progress in other forums, Shultz
added.
The "exceptions" were agreements
Moscow has wanted for a long time,
he explained. Shultz did not identify
the subjects of the exceptions.
-It remains to be seen what will
happen if we agree on something in
one area, but not in some other
area." Shultz said. "It may or may not
go forward." Hut Gromyko's remarks
"do not doom prospects" for even
tual success in reaching an arms
agreement, he said.

Launching a strong attack on Presi
dent Reagan's plan, nicknamed "Star
Wars," to conduct research on a sys
tem to defend the United States
against enemy ballistic missiles in
space, Gromyko said that it would
put the Soviet Union at an unaccepta
ble military disadvantage.
"This plan, frankly speaking, is an
aggressive plan," Gromyko said in an
extraordinary television interview
that was broadcast to the United
States as well as throughout the So
viet Union. "We will fight to the end
on this matter."
Me also warned that continued
deployment of U.S. Pershing 2 and
cruise missiles under a NATO pro
gram in Western Europe would
jeopardize the new set of arms con
trol negotiations agreed upon by
Gromyko and Secretary of State
George Shultz in Geneva last week.
Pershing 2 and cruise missiles are
intermediate-range weapons being
sited to counter Soviet deployment of
SS-20 missiles targeted on Western
Europe.

In addition, Gromyko said, if the
United States were to test anti
satellite weapons while the negotia
tions are under way, "the talks would
he torpedoed. ... We made such a
warning to the American representa
tives."
If an accord is reached on space
weapons, he said, the Soviet Union
would be prepared to make "sharp
reductions" in intercontinental ballis
tic missiles on the basis of equality
and equal security.
"On the other hand, if there were
no advancement on the issues of
outer space, it would be superfluous
to discuss the possibility of reducing
strategic (intercontinental-range)
armaments," he added.
Gromyko said that negotiations re
sulting from last week's Geneva
agreement would not succeed unless
there is "simultaneous and inter
related" progress on strategic
missiles, intermediate-range missiles
and space issues.
But Gromyko, the 75-year-old
master of Kremlin foreign policy,
praised the overall outcome at
Geneva in the first detailed report on
the talks that has been made to the
Soviet people.
"On the whole, we evaluate the
results of that meeting in a positive

light," he said. But he added that the
discussions were "not easy at all" and
sometimes became tense, although
"we did not bang our fists on the
table."
Gromyko. wearing a dark suit and
tie. was questioned by four journalists
for an hour and 50 minutes in a rare
discussion of policy by a member of
the ruling Politburo.
But he was not grilled in the style
of U.S. television interview programs,
although some of the questioners
mentioned arguments that have been
raised by U.S. officials. No one asked,
however, about the Soviet anti
satellite weapons system during the
lengthy discussion of space warfare.
In Washington, Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger immediately
denied that current space defense re
search, or future weapons based on
that research, can be bargained away,
and he accused Gromyko of introduc
ing a new condition — parallel prog
ress in all the talks — even before the
negotiations begin.
"We approach these talks with a
completely undetermined, free
agenda," Weinberger said on the
CBS television program. "Face the
Nation."
In a more relaxed vein. Secretary
of State George Shultz said "it

remains to he seen" whether the
Soviets will insist on parallel progress
on space defense arms — which Mos
cow most wants to curb — and offen
sive weapons, which are prime targets
of U.S. negotiators.
During the Geneva meeting last
week, he said. Gromyko made a
similar statement about firm
"linkage" between offensive and de
fensive talks. "And then he
(Gromyko) proceeded to list a lot of
exceptions" where agreements could
be reached — and presumably signed
and put into effect — independent of
progress in other forums, Shultz
added.
The "exceptions" were agreements
Moscow has wanted for a long time,
he explained. Shultz did not identify
the subjects of the exceptions.
-It remains to be seen what will
happen if we agree on something in
one area, but not in some other
area." Shultz said. "It may or may not
go forward." Hut Gromyko's remarks
"do not doom prospects" for even
tual success in reaching an arms
agreement, he said.
