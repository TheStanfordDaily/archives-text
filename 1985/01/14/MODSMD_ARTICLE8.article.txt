# Sharon trial to go before jury
## 
### 
NEW YORK — The jury is expected to begin
deliberations today in the $50 million libel lawsuit
brought by former Israeli Defense Minister Ariel
Sharon against Time magazine.
Whatever the six jurors decide, the two-month
long trial in U.S. District Court here already may
have made a lasting imprint on the futures of both
Sharon and Time.
Much of Sharon's testimony at the trial's outset
involved his defense of his conduct as architect of
Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon. And, after Time
conceded last week that its disputed story was par
tially wrong, Sharon, a former general who has fur
ther political ambitions in Israel, claimed a political
victory for himself.
Sharon's attorneys also have endeavored to show
that Time is untrustworthy and that its journalistic
methods, especially its reliance on confidential
sources in reporting the disputed story, are sloppy.
That has raised questions about what scars the trial
might leave on the magazine, on public confidence
in the press generally and on the use of anonymous
sources in particular.
And, as a sidelight, the case may lead to a prece
dent in constitutional law as well. U.S. District
Judge Abraham Sofaer closed a portion of the trial

— an unusual stop in a libel suit — because of an
agreement he made with the Israeli government to
gain access to classified Israeli documents. Press or
ganizations are now appealing that closure.
The trial focuses on one paragraph in a 1983
Time cover story, which Sharon claims falsely
accused him of knowingly permitting or encourag
ing the massacre of more than 700 Palestinian
refugees by Lebanese Christian militia in West
Beirut camps in September 1982. The massacre
followed the assassination of Lebanese leader Ba
shir Gemayel.
In the paragraph, Time reported that Sharon
"discussed . . . the need for revenge" with
Lebanese leaders the day before the massacre, and
that the discussion was cited in a secret Appendix B
of the Israeli government's Kahan Commission
report on the massacre.
How the jury interprets the disputed paragraph
will be the pivotal element in the case. If the jury
agrees with Time that the paragraph does not mean
what Sharon alleges it means, his case falls. If
Sharon's interpretation prevails, the jury then must
determine whether Time knew that its story was
false or published it with reckless disregard for
whether it was true or false.

Sharon, who publicly has stated he wants to be
Israeli prime minister, himself raised the political
implications of the suit during his seven days of tes
timony. He testified that Time's story was "blood
libel" against all Israel, which he in effect was
representing. Sharon's testimony attracted criticism
at home that he had no authorization to take on
such a role.
Nonetheless, Israeli reporters covering the trial
said they generally believe that Sharon does stand
to gain much politically from the suit. He may
already have done so, because some Israelis regard
as a patriotic act his fight to vindicate the Kahan
Commission finding that the Israeli authorities
were not directly responsible for the massacre. The
lawsuit also has cleared up suspicions that the com
mission may have concealed potentially incriminat
ing evidence in the secret appendix.
Earlier last week. Time conceded in court that it
was wrong in contending that what it had reported
was contained in the appendix. Afterward, Sharon
on the courthouse steps claimed victory over the
"blood libel" against his people.
