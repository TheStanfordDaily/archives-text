Missile accident kills 3
BONN, West Germany — Three U.S. Army soldiers
were killed and seven others were injured Friday when a
rocket motor for a Pershing 2 missile caught fire and
burned as it was being unpacked at an American nuclear
base in West Germany, U.S. Army officials said.
It was the second mishap involving a missile in Europe
in the past three weeks. On Dec. 28 an unarmed Soviet
missile being used as a target went off course and flew
over Norway and Finland. A Norwegian official quoted
the Soviet ambassador as saying it was an "old cruise
missile" that had been fired from a ship in the Barents
Sea.
A U.S. Army spokesman said no nuclear weapons were
involved in Friday's incident and that no explosion took
place. At no time, he added, was there any danger to the
German civilian population.
The accident occurred when an Army crew, working in
a tent, tried to use a special crane to lift the first of two
rocket motors from a shipping container that had just
arrived from the United States, U.S. officials said. The
crane apparently broke, dropping the motor and igniting
its contents of solid fuel.
A U.S. Army statement said the crew had followed
"authorized procedures" in what was called "a routine
operation" at Camp Redleg, near Heilbronn, where 36 of
a total of 108 Pershing 2 nuclear missiles are being
deployed by the U.S. Army's 56th Artillery Brigade in
West Germany. Battalions in Neu Ulm and Schwaebisch
Gmuend are also being equipped with 36 new missiles
each.
An Army spokesman said the operation was conducted

under the supervision of "a qualified field artillery cap
tain."
Brig. Gen. Raymond Haddock, the commanding officer
of the three Pershing 2 bases operated by the 56th Ar
tillery Brigade in West Germany, ordered a full investiga
tion to determine the cause of the tragedy.
On Saturday, West Germany's opposition Social
Democrats also demanded a full-scale government inves
tigation into the accident.
Riots hit New Caledonia
PARIS — France Saturday announced that it is sending
another 1,000 troops to its troubled Pacific territory of
New Caledonia to reinforce law and order following the
declaration of a state of emergency on the island.
The decision to send the mixed contingent of gen
darmes and paramilitary police to the island was made at
an emergency meeting of senior ministers chaired by
Prime Minister Laurent Fabius in Paris. The reinforce
ments will bring the size of the island's internal security
force to 3,280 men, in addition to 3,000 French soldiers
and 300 local gendarmes who can also be called up if ne
cessary.
Saturday's declaration of a state of emergency followed
the shooting by police of two leading Kanak separatists
and riots in the capital, Noumea, by largely white
demonstrators incensed at the killing of a European
farmer Friday. It was the first time such measures have
been taken in a French-ruled territory since 1961, when
Charles de Gaulle assumed full powers to deal with a set
tler insurrection in Algeria.
In a statement, Fabius pleaded with New Caledonia's

mixed 145,000 population of indigenous Kanaks,
European settlers and largely Asian immigrants not to al
low themselves to be drawn into "an infernal cycle of vio
lence."
Reports from Noumea Saturday evening said that the
streets of the town were deserted following the imposition
of a nighttime curfew. Troops were guarding the residence
of the government delegate, Edgard Pisani. who devised a
plan designed to lead to independence for the island "in
association with France" from the beginning of 1986 fol
lowing a referendum in July.
The dramatic increase in tension in New Caledonia over
the last two days has undermined hopes of the Socialist
government in Paris for a peaceful transition to indepen
dence for the territory, which has been ruled by France
since 1853. It has also stirred unpleasant memories here
of the civil war in Algeria in the late 1950s and early
1960s and the mass exodus of the white settler population
there following the granting of independence.
Afghan aid reportedly up
WASHINGTON — The Central Intelligence Agency's
secret aid to insurgents fighting the Soviet invaders in Af
ghanistan has mushroomed to $250 million this year,
making it the largest covert program since the Vietnam
War era, The Washington Post reported.
The expenditure, triple the amount initially requested
by the Reagan administration, represents more than 80
percent of the ClA's annual payments for covert opera
tions, the Post reported yesterday, saying it had inter
viewed 20 officials familiar with the aid plan.
The program, which supplies weapons, ammunition,

clothing, medical supplies and money for food is expected
to support an estimated 200,000-300,000 full- or part
time insurgents in a war against about 100.000 Soviet
troops, the report said.
A number of the officials expressed concern that the
size of the program has grown so quickly that it is getting
out of hand and could lead to an escalation of Soviet mili
tary operations in Afghanistan, the Post said.
"This program is on the verge of blowing up." one in
telligence official was quoted as saying. "It is an area of
the world where there are great tensions."
'Star Wars' key to talks
WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger and arms negotiator Edward Rowny said Sat
urday that success in future arms talks with the Soviet
Union is tied to congressional support for the MX missile
and "Star Wars" weapons systems.
Weinberger, a staunch supporter of both systems,
reiterated his belief that the president's Strategic Defense
Initiative, or Star Wars program, is "absolutely essential"
to U.S. security interests.
The defense secretary spoke during an appearance on
the Cable News Network's "Evans and Novak" program.
"It is not a bargaining chip." Weinberger said of the
$26 billion research program. "I have talked to a number
of people and one of them, a very widely known
newspaperman . . . said that in all of his experience, he's
never seen a disinformation campaign of the kind the
Soviets are mounting in an attempt to destroy the Strate
gic Defense Initiative right now."
