## 
### MARK BEYREIS Staff writer 
If the U.S. Air Force has its way, armchair quarterbacks
won't abandon their posts during the Super Bowl halftime
intermission this Sunday.
The Air Force is putting on a 12 minute, top-secret,
halftime celebration that is known only by its code name
— "refrigerator." The project's goal: Keep viewers at

SUPER BOWL

home from going to the refrigerator tor a snack during the
intermission and keep people in Stanford Stadium from
visiting the concession stands.
While the specifics of the program remain a secret. Air
Force Col. Tony Ciemann said the show is a collection of
six musical and dance numbers "depicting the dreams of
children everywhere."
While the theme is non-military, the show has a "nice
patriotic flair," Gemann said. Ciemann said the show is a
good way to "enhance both recruiting and the Air Force
image."
The pre-gamc celebration is somewhat less of a mys
tery. According to a spokeswoman for Michael Olmstead,
director of pre-game celebration, the 30-minute show
before the kickoff will feature, among others, Jeffrey Os
borne singing "This is the NFL.." During the song, the
mascots of all 28 NFL teams and 100 dancers from local
high schools and colleges will also perform.
Also planned for the pre-game event is "the world's
largest human flag," the spokeswoman said. The flag will
consist of 1,300 high school band members.
While the entertainment office of the San Francisco
49ers is trying to help defray expenses incurred by local
high school and college performers, most of the enter
tainers are volunteering their services.
The halftime show, choreographed and directed by
Tom Edwards, head of Air Force entertainment, will be
funded by the NFL.
Under Edwards' watchful eye, 650 entertainers from
the "Air Force family" will perform on the field amid
moving floats and stages.
This is only the second time the Air Force has designed
a halftime event. The first-was the 1981 Garden State
Howl, which, according to Gemann, was so successful that
the NFL requested that the Air Force present a proposal
for the Super Bowl.
Edwards began choreographing the show two years
ago, according to Gemann. After his ideas were approved
by the Air Force, a video tape was
prepared for the NR. selection
process.
Members of the halftime cast and
about 300 support people come from
various areas of the Air Force. Fifty
of the entertainers are what Gemann
describes as "Air Force professionals"
— members of the group Tops in
Blue, which entertains members of
tb»armed services here and abroad.
Other members of the halftime en
semble include family members of ac
tive duty personnel. Air National
Guard members, retired service men

and government service employees.
Representatives of both shows said
they were prepared for rain and
would cancel the show only if the per
formances would damage the field.
