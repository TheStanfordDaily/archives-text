## OSA questionnaire Res Ed asks, 'Are you happy?' 
### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER Senior staff writer 
Students in all University housing will receive a lengthy
questionnaire within the next two weeks to help the Office
of Student Affairs determine how satisfied people are in
their current housing situation.
Dean of Residential Education Norm Robinson
pointed out that, while surveys have been conducted in in
dividual dormitories, this is the first campus-wide ques
tionnaire.
"It used to be up to each residence." Robinson said.
Robinson said the questionnaire was not prompted by a
single incident.
The dean said the campus-wide survey is not a new
idea: "We've been talking about it for years."
Alice Supton. associate dean of Residential Education
said. "We want people to take it (the survey) seriously.
"One of the important points." she continued, "is that
for several years now there have been efforts to develop a
questionnaire to relay student views within the
residences."
"The real purpose is to get feedback to the house so
that they know where changes need to be made," Robin
son said.
"There has been a lot of consultation with the RFs and
RAs" on the formation of the questionnaire. Robinson
said. "The questionnaire that is going to be distributed has
not been finalized."
A Dec. 20 memo asks resident fellows and resident as
sistants to set a date for a house meeting to discuss and
pass out the questionnaire. Prior to the gathering, stu
dents will be reminded by announcements and fliers.
Before the house meeting, students will be reminded to
bring a pen or pencil with them. Students will be given the
option to return to their rooms, so they will not have to fill
out the surveys in public.
The RAs have been instructed to serve refreshments
after the questionnaires have been filled out.
Each student will be provided with an envelope for the
questionnaire to ensure secrecy.
A draft of the survey contains seven pages of questions.
The first page, "Background and General Questions,"
asks simple things like year in school, sex and ethnic back
ground.
The main question asks, "How important is it to you
that your residence achieves these goals?" The survey

mentions goals such ;is creating a supportive and friendh
communis: stimulating interest in cultural activities —
theater, art. literature, dance and music: and providing
recreational opportunities.
the second page ot the draft is titled. "Your lite in the
house. It asks tor information on how active students are
in house activities, with questions such as. "How much of
vour social lite is centered in \our residence?"

The following three pages delve into the relationships
between the students and the RFs and RAs with questions
as simple as, "Have you met the RF?"
I he final page asks about students' academic, personal
and "beyond Stanford" interests.
Robinson pointed out that different residences will
receive slightly different questionnaires due to the great
variation in the number of RAs in dormitories and the ab
sence of RFs in others.
Supton said the results of the survey will be available to
staff members, but she is not certain if the results will be
made public.
