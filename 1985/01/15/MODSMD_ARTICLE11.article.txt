						Stanford Daily Happy birthday to you 
### 
There oughta be a lime
That we can set aside to show
Just how much we love you
And Tm sure you would agree
What could fit more perfectly
Than to have a world party
On the day you came to he
Happy Birthday to you
â€” Stevie Wonder
Martin Luther King, Jr.'s birthday is finally
being recognized as a legitimate holiday through
out the nation. We welcome this development
despite the fact that it is long overdue.
There is a danger with these holidays, however,
to place too much emphasis on individuals. King
was as great as humans come, but he was human.
We must never forget that he was the representa
tive for a mass movement of ordinary people
united in a quest for freedom, justice and
equality. Since he articulated the aspirations of
the masses, we have singled him out for honor.
While we praise the man who rode the crest of

the civil rights movement, let us remember the
people who raised him to prominence.
It is heartening to note that 17 years after
King's death, the spirit of the movement has been
rekindled. From the election of Harold Washing
ton to the mayoralty of Chicago, to the campaign
of King's protege. Jesse Jackson, for the highest
office in the land, to the Free South Africa Move
ment, the flame of idealism burns increasingly
bright.
Stanford, as well, has been caught up in the
spirit of the struggle for social change. The Peace
and Justice Week Coalition has organized a series
of events to raise consciousness and mobilize
people to act to bring about change.
As we celebrate the birthday of King with a
day off on Monday, let us take time to ponder the
true meaning of the day and the man's message.
Let us examine our lives in relation to society's
needs and heed the words of King: We are prone
to judge success by the index of our salaries and
the size of our automobiles rather than by the
quality of our service to humanity.
