## Vigilantism in an unhealthy environment 
### 
As we warmed ourselves around the fire
this past holiday, a New York subway rider
fired bullets into four youths, paralyzing one
of them. The 1 8- and 19-year-olds were guilty
of carrying sharpened screwdrivers and of
harassing the passenger for money. They
received what many considered a fair retribu
tion. Hundreds phoned the New York police
to congratulate the gunman, some offering to
pay for his bail and legal defense.
New York Times columnist Sydney Schan
berg wrote that the supporters see the
vigilante as "a spokesman for their general
frustration over the lack of obedience to the
law in cities . . . where crime is a daily disease,
not a statistic." The shooting and the harass
ment are not the disease, however; they are
spots indicating a much more pervasive can
cer. The disease is the environment which
cheers rapists on, which encourages suicidal
jumps, which permits harassment and mur
der. The unhealthy attitudes crumble our so
cial contract and our sense of communal
welfare.
It is not enough, though, to point out that
our system is imperfect. We must change what
is wrong and ineffective, as we preserve our
freedom. We must confront Big Brother, dis
allowing eyes and ears to record our acts and
sounds. And we must also prevent an unstable
liberty, yielding to us the right to disregard
others. Consistency, community and balance
are the keys to this social revitalization.
We need to address the criminal justice sys
tem, eliminating loopholes and unclear legis
lation. Defenses based on the uncontrollable
influences of junk food, television and
temptation should not mitigate the punish
ments. Just because potato chips and choco

late may cause hyperactive, homocidal
tendencies in a person does not give that per
son any more right to commit a murder. Just
because fictional characters destroy each
other does not permit the viewer to behave
likewise. Just because a teenager happens
upon car keys in an ignition, "finders-

keepers" does not allow him to steal the
BMW. And just because you do not like the
word "shh" does not accord you the privilege
of axing your mother to death when she tries
to quiet you. A criminal act is criminal, and
we must punish these misdeeds. Our decisions
must be fair, consistent and, most of all, effec
tive in order to discourage a repetition of
crime, repetition by the convict or by would

be criminals. We must not pluck an eye for
eye, however; this will only perpetuate the
disease. We cannot argue that our action is
just and theirs is not when it is the same ac
tion. We must prove that our system is better
by incorporating criminals into an active and
productive society.

Jails must be expanded and improved, al
lowing convicts to serve their terms as well as
contribute to the economic well-being of our
society. If we are to eradicate crime, we must
eliminate the environment which allows one
person to murder another because of a dis
agreement over which was the best basketball
team. We must supply the convict with a new
sense of purpose; we must provide the tools

and knowledge which will allow the prisoner
to survive in and contribute to our society it
and when he returns to it; and we must en
courage him to work with people, not against
them. The industry of jailworkers will pay for
the bars which bind them. And their punish
ment is their lack of freedom. They cannot
live and love like those outside their cell; they
cannot enjoy the products of their labor. They
have created their own chains, hut they may
remove them if they so desire.
We must also revamp the welfare system so
that we don't institutionalize poverty and en
courage situational crime. We must help the
poor break out of and reshape their environ
ment so that they can contribute to our soci
ety rather than restrain it. We must eliminate
bureaucratic waste, inefficiency and insen
sitivity in the welfare system; we must reach
all of the poor, not special classes such as
families with dependent children or unwed
mothers; and we must provide incentives for
the poor to work. The best proposal which
meets these needs is Milton Friedman's
Negative Income Tax plan. Its reduction of
government interference and its eventual
elimination of substantial poverty wins the
support of both conservatives and liberals.
There exists no panacea which will cure all
of our ills. Each law, each program, each
microsystem feeds and supports our entire so
cial network. The aforementioned suggestions
deserve detailed study and argument, as well
as the company of a panoply of other pro
grams, many of which will evidence them
selves as we implement these. We need, for
example, to lighten the Supreme Court's
docket by creating a powerful judiciary rules

committee that will direct the legal traffic or
hv creating a new level of courts. And we
need to enforce gun control, (inns do not kill
people; people kill each other, but handgun
convenience, accessibility and accidents mag
nify their presence to such a power that we
cannot afford their use. Human life is more
precious than accidental metal.
The problem remains that we need to
implement our ideas: we need to act. Just as
the hundreds of New Yorkers called the
police and radio programs, illuminating the
dire need for social change, we too can influ
ence policy-makers by calling them and
writing to them. Wc can exchange and debate
ideas among each other. We can attend jury
duty. We can become legally, judicially and/or
politically active. We can scrutinize* our repre
sentatives and vote according to our convic
tions. And most important, we can adopt a
community spirit. II we cannot work with
each other, we are very alone in this world.
Everything and everyone is part of a greater
effort.
The instant-justice incident in New York is
yet another cry for change. II we are blind to
these inequities, we create a thick fear which
suffocates our freedom, and which leads to
hand-jerk reactions. If we work together, ac
complishing greater goals, if we free ourselves
from the fear of hunger, poverty, destruction,
government regulation and crime, we truly
liberate ourselves. I he social contract is not
an infringement on our liberty or individual
rights, but a popular manifestation of self
evident truths. We live with each other, of
each other, by each other and for each other.
