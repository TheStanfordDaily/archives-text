Synergistic living
I am a graduate student in biology
at Stanford and a current resident of
the co-operative house Synergy. I am
both saddened and angered by the
threatened closure by Residential
Education of one of the co-ops,
possibly Synergy. Saddened because
of the loss to the University of a
unique living experience embodied
in the concept of Synergy. That
concept is to live in a manner that is
both efficient and environmentally
aware. To this end. the house sup
ports chickens and a vegetable gar
den. The house cooks dinners
together that are purposefully un
processed with bread, yogurt and
granola. among other products.
made by house members. The resi
dents of the house strive to form a
cohesive conimunit> based on inter
action. support and consensual deci
sion making. It is unique in mv
experience to see 45 busy students

committing themselves to the
idealism that is represented by this
house.
I am saddened that this could be
lost. More than this, I am angered by
the reason that it might be lost. To
my understanding there is a belief
held by the University that there is a
lack of interest by the student body
in living at Synergy. To counter this
argument I would like to state what I
perceive to be the problem and what
I would do to solve that problem.
The student body at Stanford,
both undergraduate and graduate, is
given very little information on what
co-op housing is all about. In the
housing packet given to graduates
there is perhaps one sentence on
what Synergy is. I know that I would
not request to live in a house that 1
had so little information on. Accord
ing to a recent survey, undergradu
ates in general knew very little about
the co-ops.

There are ways that this problem
can be dealt with. One is to have
more interaction between the co-ops
and the Stanford community in the
nature of talks, readings and films
given at the houses. Another is to
give presentations on the houses for
freshmen and other interested stu
dents around the time of the spring
Housing Draw and to generate
more printed information to be sent to
incoming students. Finally, programs
involving communities around Stan
ford can be envisioned. Last fall, for
example, a bread-making project
produced more than 450 loaves
between the houses that were given
to needy families for Thanksgiving.
The point is that if we as a com
munity are committed to maintaining
Synergy as a living alternative, there
are very concrete ways in which
knowledge of the house can be dis
seminated and its popularity in
creased. If this, or any other co-op, is
closed now without being given a

chance to spread its message and
ideals to the rest of campus, a large
amount of co-operative resources
will be lost.
I am angered also by the double
standard at this University which
pardons again and again the
destructive and irresponsible activi
ties of the fraternities while forcing
the closure of a bold and unique
experiment in living that is Synergy.
To survive in this complex and
increasingly specialized world we
must all learn the principles of com
munal living, of synergism. A univer
sity is traditionally the place where
broadening of outlook and knowl
edge is to occur. To close Synergy
would mean a failure on the part of
this University to uphold these tradi
tions of learning and enlightenment.
I strongly urge you as a commu
nity to oppose this impending action.
