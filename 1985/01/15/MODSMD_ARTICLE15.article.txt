## An exemplar of the American dream 
### 
The short span of five months now separates me
and my fellow seniors from the time when we must
leave this happ> place we call the Farm. And who
among us can deny that along with that feelinu of
gleeful anticipation we share there looms a veil of
apprehension.
What does life hold in store for us be\ond these
palm-lined drives we know so well? And. more im-

portant. how shall we meet the challenges which
will surely face America's new generation of
leaders?
To this question I sa\ look back, my friends, look
back into the annals of this great nation and find
your guidance in the person of one who has held
her highest office.
But so nian\ have ser\ed in this exhalted post,
and served with such distinction, that you ma\
rightl\ question of whom I speak.
Is it George Washington, you pose: that man of
impeccable honesty. unswerving devotion to duty
and unbending mettle? That man who led the
founding fathers as they forged the colonies into
union in the blast furnace of rebellion? Is it he to
whom we must turn?

No. I must rejoin, for though a greater man than
Washington our nation has never seen, still it is not
Washington of whom I write.
Then surely it is Honest Abe. the Railsplitter
whose might\ character, like a thousand bands of
steel, bound our nation together when she seemed
bent on rending herself assunder. Can it be anyone
but Abe Lincoln in whom we are to seek inspira
tion?
I his man too was great, as no student of our past
would deny. but perhaps there is another not quite
so removed from us in time and not quite so inim
itable in character from whom more practical les
sons might be learned.
Look past Lincoln, past Wilson, and even
Coolidge. past Roosevelt and Kennedy and then
you cannot help but discern to whom I would have
you turn.
Yes. he is Gerald Ford. For this man is truly an
exemplar of the American dream. Fie is tough, he is
dedicated, and more than that, he is mediocre.
Let these quotes inform you of the character of
an uncommonly common American:
New York Congressman Barber Conable said.
"Fie has a slow mind, but he has backbone."
Adds Ford's son (and surely no one knows the
man better): "He's a go-getter. When he skis, he

skis hard."
President Johnson, in praise of Ford's dogged
determination and gritty tenacity: "He played too
much football with his helmet off."
Even now. after such recommendations have
been presented, 1 anticipate that not a little doubt
remains in \our minds as to the suitability of this
particular president for imitation. Meaning no dis
respect for the office he held, you might exclaim.
"But there are those who have held it better." And
you would not be far from wrong in your assess
ment of his talents and contributions, but you must
ask yourself a question: Has God made you from
the same mold as Washington? as Lincoln? Surely
there are feu among you who can verily answer
"\es" to this query. From the same mold as Ford?
Are we not just a bit closer to you now?
Ask yourselves then, ought the mouse to look
after the lion for his guidance? Should the sparrow
seek to soar like an eagle? No, and again no.
So. my friends, look not toward Washington nor
Lincoln, for they are rare men of brilliance, sent to
us in times of great tribulation by a power greater
than ourselves. Rather, look upon Ford and a spark
of hope cannot fail to ignite in your breast as you
think. "If Jerry did it, by God so can I."
