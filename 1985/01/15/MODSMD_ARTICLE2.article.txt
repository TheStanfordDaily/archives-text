# Students honor King
## 
### JOYA WESLEY 
In an effort to raise consciousness about
various injustices around the world, and to com
memorate Martin Luther King, Jr.'s birthday,
several student organizations have combined to
sponsor "Peace and Justice Week, 1985" this
week.
Beginning last Friday with a screening of
"Gandhi" and continuing with Saturday's per
formance by "Sweet Honey in the Rock," a mu
sical group that focuses on themes of oppres
sion, Sunday's march and program for hunger
and last night's memorial service, the events
have been well-attended by members of the
Stanford community, according to Keith Ar
chuleta, a member of the Peace Week Coali
tion, which is sponsoring the events.
The coalition is composed of the Black Stu
dent Union, the Stanford African Students As
sociation, the Stanford Coalition Against Apar
theid, the Stanford Central American Action
Network, the Stanford East African Relief Or

ganization and Students Against Reaganism.
Today's rally and the workshop following it,
sponsored by the BSU, serve as the focal point
of the week because they occur on King's
birthday. The University will observe King's
birthday on Monday. The rest of the week's
events will include a broader range of issues, en
compassing other goals for which King
struggled, according to Steven Phillips, chair
man of the BSU.
"Given the fact that this is Martin Luther
King's birthday, it is not enough to pause and
reflect. We must also remember that he was a
symbol for a whole movement," said Ar
chuleta. He emphasized that this series of
events was planned with hopes of reiterating the
advances King made toward promoting peace
and justice, and to recover ground that has been
lost since his death.

vestments in that country and to
revive the spirit of revolutionary ac

The goal of the Peace Week Coali
tion is summed up on a flier it handed
out this week, which quotes King:
"These are revolutionary times. All
over the globe men are revolting
against old systems of exploitation
and oppression, and out of the wombs
of a frail world, new systems of justice
and equality are being born. . . . Our
only hope today lies in our ability to>
recapture the revolutionary spirit and
go out into a sometimes hostile world!
declaring eternal opposition to!
poverty, racism, and militarism. - '
