## Dave Dutcher Bowl, baskets and Belton 
### 
Dressed in blue jeans and a
black jacket. Kim Belton yester
day didn't look like someone
you'd think would hold what many
consider a • glamor" job. But
there's something to be said for
competence and style kept under
w raps.
You can sit and tick off the
things Belton. 26. has done anu
shake your head. He's graduated
from a school most only dream of
attending, he's played and left a
significant mark on a major sport
at that school, and his occupation
has brought him back, successful,
to his former stomping grounds.
What more is there? What else
is on people's minds? The Super
Bowl, and Belton will be at Stan
ford Stadium playing a key role
Sunday in the telecast of the 19th
championship of professional
football since the American Foot
ball League began playing the Na
tional Football League.
Belton came to Stanford from
New York City in 1976. Before he
graduated with a degree in com
munication in 1980. his name had
become associated, to say the
least, with a few records. Belton
has scored more points than any
other Cardinal player, 1615. has
the most rebounds. 955. is second
in field goal percentage. .572, and
has the third-best shooting season
from the field. 61.9 percent, in
1979.
But while on the Farm estab
lishing credentials that made him
the Phoenix Suns' second-round
choice in the 1 9SO National Bas
ketball Association draft. Belton.
and Stanford, experienced lean
years on the hardwood under Dick
Dißiaso. who was succeeded by
current coach Tom Davis. During
Belton's four seasons, the Card
inal was 43-64. But. as Belton told
me in one of the trailers that
makes up the maze ABC Sports
has established next to Stanford
Stadium, basketball success wasn't
the entire idea behind this young
man who came West.
"If I had to do it again, I'd prob
ably do it again because it's
worked out, although it didn't
work out necessarily athletically,"
Belton said. "But I didn't come
here to go to the pros. I came here

to get an education and have some
fun and I did that.
"We didn't win vers much, but
we had a great group of guys. He
(Dißiaso) was a good judge of
character. The guys he recruited
were really down-to-earth people,
really good people. Everyone
graduated. and everyone
graduated in four years."
After graduation. Belton went
to Phoenix's rookie camp, where
he was the leading scorer. In camp
with the veterans, though, a recur
ring problem with tendonitis in his
left knee came back to plague him
and. ultimately, end his basketball
career.
"As a rookie trying to make the
team, you can't very well sit out.
So 1 had to try and play and. con
sequently. I couldn't jump and do
the things that 1 was capable of
doing, so I got waived."
After being waived. Belton
"just felt that anywhere I went, it
was going to be the same situation.
I guess. The team asked me if I
wanted to take a year off and
come back, but I felt as though
once it ended it was time to move
on to something else. It wasn't as
though I lived for basketball and
that was the only thing I could
do."
He and a friend tried to start a
radio station in Portland. Ore. but
failed. Belton. who plays basket
ball "once in a blue moon," even
tually sent a resume to Chet Forte,
who will direct Super Bowl XIX,
interviewed, and became a pro
duction assistant at ABC. Now an
associate director, he has been
there nearly four years, but televi
sion is a funny business.
Even with the $ I million per ad
vertising minute it will receive
during Sunday's game, ABC is re
ducing its staff, largely because it
needed many hands for Olympics
coverage — hands that are no
longer needed.
"It came down to a seniority
thing, and I was low person on the
totem pole," Belton said. "The
Pro Bowl (Jan. 27) will be my last
ABC show." After that, he'll
"look for another job." Such is
television life, but Belton has been
a success thus far, and it's likely he
will continue to be.
