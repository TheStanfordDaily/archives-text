# Possible successor named
## USFL commissioner resigns 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) â€” Chet Sim
mons resigned yesterday as commis
sioner of the United States Football
League, the league announced, and
the man rumored to be his successor
arrived in New York to "continue a
dialogue" about the job with the
league's club owners.
Los Angeles attorney Harry Usher,
who was executive vice president and
general manager of the Los Angeles
Olympic Organizing Committee,
arrived late yesterday from Los An
geles.
"I've been talking off and on for
two months or so with various USFL
owners" about the commissioner's
job, he said. "I would consider it un
der the proper set of circumstances,
and I have talked periodically with
various owners . . . concerning it."
Usher was considered the right
hand man of Peter Ueberroth, the
president of the LAOOC who
became commissioner of baseball on
Oct. 1, shortly after the Summer
Olympic Games ended.
A. Alfred Taubman, chairman of
the USFL's Special Committee for
the Commissioner's Office, an

nounced that Simmons had stepped
down and said a search is under way
for a new commissioner.
Simmons was named commissioner
of the USFL one month after the
league was formed in 1982. He had
been president and chief executive
officer of ESPN, the predominantly
sports cable television network.
Taubman praised Simmons for
"providing the energy and leadership
to transform an idea into reality. Chet
can take great satisfaction in his ac
complishments. He built a first-rate
organization overnight, and in less
than three years formed an exciting,
respected professional sports
league."
Taubman said the league is
"looking for an individual who can
build upon Chet's solid foundation
and maximize the opportunities that
lay ahead."
The USFL signed a two-year tele
vision contract with ABC before Sim
mons became commissioner. After
Simmons joined the USFL, the
league signed a two-year contract
with ESPN, and that was renewed for
three years, beginning next month.

In November. NBC said it was not
interested in televising the league's
games. ABC had two one-year op
tions in its contract and picked up the
option for the 1985 season. But it in
formed the league that it was not in
terested in televising USFL names in
the fall of 1986.

The league, which has played its
games in the spring, will move to a
fall schedule in 1986 and go head-to
hcad against the established National
Football League.
Some owners have expressed dis
satisfaction with Simmons' failure to
negotiate a new network TV contract.
