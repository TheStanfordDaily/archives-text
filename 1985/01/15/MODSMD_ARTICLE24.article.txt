# Ruggers get lesson
## 
### 
It was a great day for Oueensland
University of Australia as it gave the
Stanford men's rugby club a hard. 67-
0, lesson last Saturday.
Trying to avenge a loss during its
'83 Australia tour, the Cardinal ran
up against hustling, technically exper
ienced forwards and a sparkling
backline that controlled and moved
the ball at will for much of the after
noon.
Duncan Hughes scored three tries
for Oueensland and Australian Na
tional team member Michael Lynagh
added nine of 10 extra points, two
penalty kicks, and a spectacular 30-
yard on-the-run drop-kick.

For the Cardinal, it was a day of
learning from the far more experi
enced Aussies. The Australians' trip
to the United States has been a learn
ing experience for more teams than
just Stanford.
Stanford will host another
Australian side, Sydney University,
next Wednesday at 2 p.m. on the Palo
Alto park soccer field, across El
Camino Real from the Stanford
Shopping Center. The Cardinal will
begin regular league play at St.
Mary's College Saturday with the No.
I team playing at I p.m.. the No. 2
team at 3 p.m. and the No. 3 team at
I I a.m.
