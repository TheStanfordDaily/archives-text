## Bridges' originality saves 'Starman' 
### STEVE VINEBERG Daily staff 
In "Starman," Jeff Bridges plays an
extraterrestrial sent by his home
planet in response to Voyager 2's in
vitation to intelligent life to visit
earth. Landing in Madison, Wis., he
enters the home of a young widow
(Karen Allen) still in mourning for
her husband, a house painter killed in
an accident, and transforms himself
into a carbon copy of him by cloning
from a lock of his hair he finds in her
scrapbook. She tries to frighten him
off with a gun but is so scared herself
that she passes out; meanwhile he
picks up the weapon, and, when she
comes to, she assumes he means to
use it if she doesn't comply with his
wishes. So, reluctantly, she agrees to
drive him to Arizona, where he must
rendezvous with the ship that will
carry him back home. (His own vehi
cle was destroyed when he landed.)
On the way she discovers that this
gentle creature has no intention of
harming her; when they find a dead
deer strapped to the back of a
hunter's truck outside a diner and he
brings it back to life, she falls in love
with him. At this point the film
becomes a cross between a sci-fi
romance and a racing-against-time
thriller — the Starman will die if he
stays on earth longer than three days,
and once alerted to his presence,
every police force across his path is
mobilized to bring him in. by force if
necessary, for examination.
The use of subjective camera in the
opening scene and the menacing sci
entists are a steal from "E.T.," the
New Testament parallels that become
more apparent in the second half of
the movie recall "Close Encounters
of the Third Kind" and the basic
premise — the peaceful alien who
keeps meeting with the threat of vio
lence — goes all the way back to

"The Day the Earth Stood Still." The
filmmakers (director John Carpenter
and writers Bruce Evans and Raynold
Gideon) have so little imagination
that all they can think of doing with
their alien is to catch him in one low

comedy routine after another —
learning how to smoke, picking up
swear words, getting into a brawl, etc.
— or feed him dialogue of the Hall
mark Greeting Card variety to
describe his emotional reactions to
his encounters with earthlings. Hap
pily, they have one advantage that
their most stultifying ideas can't
diminish: Jeff Bridges.
Bridges' Starman has an exact,
robot-like walk, and his small, twist
ing movements indicate the presence
of invisible joints in all parts of his
body that divide every action into tiny
phases. He memorizes everything*he
sees and hears and reproduces it —
mechanically but with uncanny preci
sion. When he speaks English, his
voice sounds independent of his

body, as if he had slipped a tape into a
recorder in his mouth; he ends every
phrase with a closed, clicking sound,
disengaging the tape.
The cleverest element in Bridges'
performance is the way he invests
everything the Starman does with
humor of a totally original kind — his

style of running with his knees bent,
his incongruous and weirdly dis
sociated aping of mannerisms he has
observed, and especially his timing.
(He gets laughs when he smokes a
proffered cigarette by approaching
the act in his methodical, evenly meas
ured fashion — blithely — and then

exploding into enormous, racking
coughs. The joke is in the way his
rhythm changes.) But Bridges' most
amazing feat is the emotional color
ing he gives the Starman. His face —
or rather, the face he has put on —
has no life of its own, nor does his
voice, so he communicates his

feelings with the most delicate
modulations and pauses in his line
readings, and with the juxtaposition
of vocal and facial expressions he has
adopted. I've never seen anything
quite like this performance, which is a


Tom and Mae Carvey (Mel Gibson and Sissy Spacek) work to build a makeshift dam to stop a ravaging river
from flooding their farm land.
