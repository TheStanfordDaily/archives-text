# A
						preposterous narrative stops any flow to 'River'

The first two or three minutes of
"The River" contain a shot of a dead
cow floating in the water, its head
caught in the branch of a tree evi
dently uprooted and toppled in a
flood. This shocking image might lead
you to think that you were going to
see a movie dealing in some forceful
and resonant way with the elemental
struggle of Southern farmers whose
livelihood both depends on and can
be destroyed by the river running past
their land. But "The River" was di
rected by Mark Rydell, in whose last
picture, the maple candy concoction
"On Golden Pond," the loons began
by serenading Katharine Hepburn
and Henry Fonda on their return to
their idyllic country house and ended
by taking over the whole movie. That
bovine corpse is the last brush with
reality you get in "The River."
Tom and Mae Garvey (Mel Gibson

and Sissy Spacek) own a farm that
seems to bring them nothing but
grief. Their bulldozer keeps breaking
down, at one point injuring Mae so
badly that she nearly bleeds to death,
one of their cows dies, they are in
debt to everyone (mainly the bank)
and when the annual floods arrive,
their land almost washes away. Quite
sensibly, the head of the local milling
company, Joe Wade (Scott Glenn),
works out a plan with the local
senator to flood the valley in order to
irrigate farm land elsewhere in the
county and provide hydro power and
jobs.
But Tom and other farmers like
him refuse to sell their land, so Joe
puts the pressure on the bank to
foreclose on them — a fate the Garv
eys avoid only because Tom gets a
factory job in a neighboring town to
pay off some of his bills, leaving Mae
to do all the farming by herself.
(There is no indication that she has

the slightest difficulty managing the
work alone, even after her accident
with the dozer. In fact, two scenes
after the accident she's no longer
wearing a sling — as if the filmmakers
had forgotten she'd been badly hurt.)
Rydell and the screenwriters, ap
parently under the misconception
that they're making a 1930s problem
picture about the mistreatment of
American farmers, solemnly take
Tom Garvey's side in his conflict with
Joe, even though his obstinacy about
holding onto his land might strike us
as schizophrenic. The movie never
questions the logic of refusing to sell
land that barely survives the floods
every year. Instead, it provides Joe
with an unsavory ulterior motive for
bullying Tom (he wants to sleep with
Mae) and ropes in a chorus of lean
faced ex-farmers (all "victims" of
Joe's scheme) who hover over the
