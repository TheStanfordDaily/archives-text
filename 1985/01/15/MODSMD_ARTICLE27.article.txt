film like specters from a Dust Bowl
past. Not very surprisingly, Scott
Glenn, normally a fine actor, can't
figure out how to play scenes like the
one in which, pitching to Tom in a
baseball game, he wings a couple of
fastballs toward him that seem to in
dicate a homicidal impulse.
The Garveys act up to some heroic
ideal throughout the movie, but their
heroism is so lunatically misplaced
that after an hour you begin to think
you're crazy. The cow dies because
Mae has been unable to nurse it back
to health; she doesn't call the vet be
cause the Garveys owe him so much
money that she can't face him. And
no one in the movie — least of all the
director or the writers — suggests
that this is an irresponsible or need
lessly prideful way to behave.
Once Tom goes off to work in the
factory, the narrative becomes so
preposterous that you stop asking
questions. He obtains the job through
a cousin who neglects to tell him that
they will be scabs; when they arrive
they are put up in a bunk inside the
factory and forbidden to leave (for
their own good, they are told — so

that they won't have to face the mob
of picketers). Yet after a couple of
weeks Tom invites Mae and their two
children out for a visit, and there are
no constraints on his movements
then. When labor and management
reach an agreement, Tom and the
others are summarily fired, but at the
gates they find that the trucks that

transported them through the angry
pickets are no longer at their dis
posal: The strikers have demanded
that the scabs be forced to walk out
and face the men whose jobs they
took.
The scene doesn't make any sense
(especially since no violence of any
kind erupts), but I suppose it doesn't
have to. The filmmakers wanted to

include a confrontation between
these two groups to show that
someone (the bosses, the politicians,
the money men) always gets ahead by
dividing decent human beings up and
setting them against each other. It's a
foreshadowing of the finale, when Joe
Wade hires the starving ex-farmers to
help him flood the land Tom. Mae

'The River is an even dopier movie
than 'Country' (and they double up on
some scenes, like the 'No Sale!' auc
tion number), but it is better acted.

and their neighbors are trying to save
— a scene that is written and directed
as if King Vidor had made "Our
Daily Bread" and Steinbeck had
turned out "The Grapes of Wrath"
yesterday instead of half a century
ago.
"The River" is an even dopier
movie than "Country" (and they
double up on some scenes, like the
"No' Sale!" auction number), but it is

better acted. Sissy Spacek gives one
of her undoubtedly authentic but
fairly boring performances (she can't
rise above bad material, but she al
ways manages to remain untainted by
it), and Mel Gibson actually finds an
imaginative route into lines like
"Don't tear me down — all I got's
what's growin" in these fields!" When
you see him as Fletcher Christian in
"The Bounty" or as the convicted
murderer in the new "Mrs. Soffel."
though, you rcali/c that he's working
at half steam in this movie. And who
could blame him? (The better part of
valor, of course, would have been to
refuse the part.) How seriously can
you take a project like this, in which
the hero's teenage son always looks
like he's posing for a jeans commer
cial and the photographer (the gifted
Vilmos /sigmond) makes every ex
terior look like a Maxfield Parrish? A
project which includes a litle girl of
the Twentieth Century-Fox variety
(circa 1935) who says things like
"Can daddies cry?" and which makes
a symbolic point by showing us a deer
trapped and urinating in a factory?
This movie didn't infuriate me (the
way "Country" did) because nothing
in it after that drowned cow bears any
relation to the real world. It might
have been made on the planet
Bizarro.
