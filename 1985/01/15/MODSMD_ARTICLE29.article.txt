# Expert discusses Soviet relations
## 
### DAVID GELB 
The Soviet Union is "unlikely" to
accept anything less than parity with
the United States, and Soviet percep
tions on the balance of power differ
from those in the West, an expert on
the Soviet Union said last night.
David Holloway. a professor at the
University of Edinburgh and a visit
ing tellow at the Stanford Center for
International Security and Arms
Control, told about N5 people in
Toy on Hall that the Reagan adminis
tration s Strategic Defense Initiative
— the "Star Wars" plan — is viewed
by the Soviets as an attempt to un
dermine deterrence between the su
perpowers.
I he author of "The Soviet Union
and the Arms Race." Holloway is
currently writing a book about Soviet
counterparts to men like Robert Op
penheimer and their role in the devel
opment of nuclear weapons.
Holloway noted that "when Hitler
attacked the USSR.. the Soviet ef
forts to develop the uranium bomb
were dropped. It was revived in
1942-43 because the Soviets got wind
of the American. British and German
interests in developing atomic weap
ons."
After discussing the acquisition of
the atomic bomb by the Soviet
Union. Holloway spoke on the
change of Soviet doctrine under
Nikita Khrushchev.
"The U.S.S.R. concentrated on
reaching parity with the U.S. by in
creasing its offensive power and
pay ing scant attention to anti-ballistic
missile systems." he said.
"If the U.S. goes ahead with the
building of strategic defense systems,
the Soviet Union can and will go

ahead with developing its offensive
forces. The relationship between de
fensive and offensive weapons sys
tems is recognized in the ABM treaty
of 1972."
That treaty, signed by both super
powers. limits the development of
anti-ballistic missile defense systems.
The Soviets do not take a consis
tent position in regard to the Star
Wars plan. Hollowav said.
"The Soviet position is character-

ized hy statements like "Star Wars
won t work, hut it jeopardizes our
safety.' The position is largek used
for propaganda purposes."
According to Holloway. "Political
pressure would also he great on the
Soviet Union to develop space weap
ons as the new status svnihol of the
superpowers" because, "nuclear
weapons are thought about in two
different ways — as instruments of
policy and as a device which can
cause huge destruction."
