# New grants to aid undergrad research
## 
### R. TAEZA PIERCE Staff writer 
As part of an effort to "make undergraduate re
search a much larger part of what undergraduates
do . .. during their course of study at Stanford,"
the University has announced plans to expand the
Undergraduate Research Opportunities (URO)
program here.
The plans, announced hv Carolyn Lougee, asso
ciate dean of Humanities and Sciences, also call for
the creation of two new grant programs for faculty
sponsored undergraduate research, as well as
awards for faculty members sponsoring such re
search.
According to Lougee. the emphasis on under
graduate research is "not entirely new." She said
the URO office has operated "on a small scale"
since 1974. and has been "verv valuable for those

undergraduates who have taken advantage of it."
Lougee said she hopes expanding the office, and
the services it provides, can make research projects
"one of the major advantages that accrue to a stu
dent who comes to Stanford."
Laura Selznick, currently director of the Under
graduate Specials program, has been named direc
tor of URO. Lougee said Selznick "will be spend
ing much more time on that (URO)," helping to
match interested students and faculty and stepping
up publicity for the program through meetings with
individual departments as well as beginning a new
publication that will list available research opportu
nities. <
Currently Lougee said there is a bulletin board of
opportunities. She said she hopes the publication
will supplement this, as well as eventually publish
ing the results of the research conducted by some of

the students involved in the program.
Lougee said the availability of awards to sub
sidize student research is the newest element in the
plans to revamp URO. She said she hopes the
grants will make it possible for more students to use
the program, "though sometimes undergraduate
research doesn't have costs attached to it, very of
ten it does."
In 1985-86 and 1986-87, Lougee said URO will
sponsor an Undergraduate Awards pilot program.
During that period, she said the pilot program will
award "$lOO,OOO per year in student stipends for
undergraduate research" on a competitive basis.
All the awards will be competitive, and include:
• Major awards — At least 25 major grants of up to
$2,500 each will be awarded to students who corn-
