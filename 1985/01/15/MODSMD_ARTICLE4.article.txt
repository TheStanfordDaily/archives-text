# Students clash over draft
## 
### ALLISON HARTWELL VICTORIA HURD 
Registration for military service "is an en
dorsement for the government to do what
they want with our bodies" an anti
registration activist said here yesterday.
Matt Grant, a representative of Stanford
Against Conscription, told about 40 people
in Florence Moore Hall yesterday that
registration gives the government the power
to "judge our consciences" by overriding
the moral choices of individuals. Grant was
joined by Selective Service representative
Terry Knight, who stressed that residents ot
the United States "can't pick and choose
laws."
"There is no question why we need to reg
ister. ... If there's a national emergency,
we're the people who are supposed to
administer the manpower." Knight said.
Response time to a national crisis can be
shortened by two to six weeks through
Selective Service registration, according to
Knight.
Grant disagreed, claiming that in register
ing with the Selective Service. U.S. citizens

relinquish those rights granted to them in
the Fifth Amendment. A question from the
audience prompted a discussion of the ex
ample set by the late civil rights activist Mar
tin Luther King. Jr.. who broke many laws in
accordance with his beliefs.
Stanford Against Conscription attempts
to inform prospective registrants of the
ramifications of their actions. Grant said.
Knight countered by saying. "You're not
giving up any rights (when you register)."
He added that registration is not a classifica
tion, and that an individual retains the right
to appear before a draft board and seek con
scientious objector status.
There are also economic considerations to
registration. By law. students who
desire federal financial aid must register in
compliance with the Solomon Act. The Su
preme Court reviewed and upheld the con
stitutionality of the Solomon Act in July
198.1.
Grant said the Solomon Act "has a dis
proportionate effect on the poor and those
of ethnic backgrounds" who apply for finan
cial aid.

Knight supported the Solomon Act. "If
you are not obeying the laws of the govern
ment. you're not entitled to the benefits." he
said.
According to Knight. 98 percent of those
eligible comply with registration. Those who
do not comply are not usually aware of their
responsibility to the law. and it is Knight's
job to inform them, the Selective Service
uses such personalities as entertainer Scott
Baio and members of the San Francisco
49ers to peddle registration on television.
Knight said he does not feel there is a sig
nificant problem concerning non
registrants. saying "there is no great protest
organization."
Grant disagreed, admitting that he has en
couraged people not to register, although he
is registered himself. He cited examples of
recent protests in San Diego, showing that
protest does exist.
Knight said he hopes people who disagree
with registration will indeed register and no
