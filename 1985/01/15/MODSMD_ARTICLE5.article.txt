# Report retort
## Poli Sci criticizes findings 
### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
A committee report calling for
more joint appointments between
Stanford and the Hoover Institution
is "libelous," "shocking" and
"factually wrong," according to some
professors in the Political Science De
partment.
The report, released last month by
Political Science Prof. Robert Ward,
chairman of a six-member committee
appointed by University President
Donald Kennedy, criticizes the Politi
cal Science Department for engen
dering "acrimonious" relations with
Hoover and specifically cites three
cases in which Hoover scholars
seeking joint appointments were
rebuffed by the department.
But some political science profes
sors say the report is riddled with er
rors. They claim committee members
neglected to research the topic ade
quately and failed to allow the de
partment to respond to the charges.
Some assert that the Ward committee
— with four of its six members claim
ing Hoover ties — is partisan.
The political science faculty met in
December to discuss the report. As a
result of that meeting. Prof. Stephen
Krasner, chairman of the department,
sent a letter to Ward asking for a
public retraction of the charges.
"We're talking about the prob
lem," Ward said yesterday. "We'll try
to straighten it out."
Ward said he hoped the matter
would be resolved "as soon as possi
ble." He declined to comment on the
specific nature of the dispute.
"Frankly, some people are upset,"
said one member of the Ward com
mittee who asked not to be identified.
"It's a touchy matter."
Krasner said a clarification of the
report would probably satisfy the de
partment, and he said he awaits
Ward's response. He said the report
had embittered several members of
the department.
"I think it's fair to say that some
people had reservations about inter
pretations put on the report," Kras
ner said.
Political Science Prof. John Manley
said the report contains "statements
which many members of the faculty
think may be libelous" both to indi
viduals and to the department itself.
"To have an officially appointed
committee say these kinds of things
about individual faculty and entire
departments, and to receive the gen
eral endorsement of the president of
the University, well, that was just
shocking," said Manley.
"I think the report is factually
wrong," said Hubert Marshall, pro
fessor of political science. "It does
libel our department. It says we
behaved in an unprofessional way,
and that's untrue."
Marshall said Krasner's letter "asks
for a blanket withdrawal of the
charge of unprofessional conduct of
our department."
The report, which was submitted to
the board of trustees, sys
tematic cooperation between Stan
ford and Hoover "would immediately

establish Stanford in a position of al
most unchallengeable national lead
ership in both domestic and interna
tional public policy research."
By uniting the resources of both in
stitutions. the new public policy pro
gram would be rivaled nationally only
by Harvard's John F. Kennedy
School of Government, according to
the report.
Most political science professors
find these statements, if exaggerated,
not objectionable. The controversy
centers on sections of the report that
directly criticize the conduct of the
Political Science Department.
For example, the report praises the
attitudes of the Economics Depart
ment and Graduate School of Busi-

ness as "friendly and professional"
toward Hoover. It adds: "The prin
cipal exceptions have been the Politi
cal Science Department and, less
notably, the History Department
where the relationship has been
acrimonious at times, with some
members opposing any association
with Hoover."
The report cites three cases involv
ing joint appointments that did not
materialize between Hoover and the
Political Science Department. In each
case, the committee blames some
member or members of the depart
ment for in some way squelching the
proposal.
Last week. Ward issued a retrac
tion concerning one of these cases. In
a letter to Campus Report, Ward
said, "The group did not at the time
check the accuracy of this state
ment. . . . This was a serious oversight
on our part."
Ward said he stands by the ac
curacy of the rest of the report.
The report also notes that eminent
Hoover scholars such as Kingsley
Davis, Milton Friedman, Philip
Habib, Sidney Hook. Thomas Sowell
and Edward Teller were never of
fered joint or courtesy appointments
with the Political Science Depart
ment.
"Other scholars at Hoover are
known to be aggrieved on this score,"
says the report.
But Marshall said the report
ignores all examples in which the de


Hubert Marshall
partment has offered joint appoint
ments to Hoover scholars. He added
that despite the committee's conten
tion. Hahih did teach accredited
courses in the Political Science De
partment.
"Their recital of the alleged factual
record totally ignores one side." Mar
shall said. "Their research was either
incompetent or the Ward committee
was so partisan that it deliberate!)
falsified the report."
Marshall criticized Kenned) for not
allowing the department to respond
to the charges before the report was
published in Campus Report.
In addition to Ward, who is a pro
fessor of political science, a senior fel
low at Hoover and the director of the
University's Center For Research in
International Studies, other members
of the special Stanford-Hoover com
mittee include: Martin Anderson and
Peter Duignan. Hoover senior fel
lows: John Ferejohn. Hoover senior
research fellow and professor of poli
tical science; James Sheehan. chair
man of the History Department: and
the late William Clebsch. professor of
religious studies.
"It's a stacked committee." said
Marshall. "Two of them are full-time
Hoover people, and two have part
time Hoover positions. Obviously,
Kennedy wanted a certain kind of an
swer from this committee."
After the report was released in
late November. Kennedy lauded it as
"thoughtful and thorough." Board of
Trustees President William Kimball
and Hoover Institution Director W.
Glenn Campbell also showered com
mittee members with praise for "a
careful, objective and thoughtful ex
amination."
At last week's Faculty Senate
meeting, Kennedy said he recognized
that there had been questions raised

about portions of the report, but he
maintained its conclusions had not
been altered. The Faculty Senate is
expected to hear a full report on the
situation at its Feb. 7 meeting.
Dav id Abernethy. professor of po
litical science and department repre
sentative to the senate, said he will
withhold comment until that meeting.
Manley said the report poses a tur
ther — and perhaps more substantial
— threat because it ignores the ques
tion raised in recent years about the
appropriateness of Hoover at Stan
ford.
"The problem with all of this is that
it presupposes all of the questions
about Hoover's alleged political ac
tivities." Manley said. "The 'adminis
tration is preventing discussion by
presupposing that closer ties and a
"strengthened relationship' is what we
need."
In the spring of 1983. Manley and
English Prof. Ron Rebholz gathered
N4 signatures from Stanford faculty
and 1.500 signatures from students
on a petition that expressed concern
about the University's reputation and
political neutrality with regard to
Hoover's alleged partisan activities.
Last April. 101 faculty members
"called for a distinguished and inde
pendent visiting committee to inquire
into relations between Stanford Uni
versity and the Hoover Institution."
Manley said he fears that the Uni
versity is straying further from
answering that question. He called
this report an attempt to bury the
issue entirely. In a memorandum to
his colleagues, he wrote. "Efforts to
pressure us into closer relations (with
Hoover) must and should be
opposed."
"The problem is that whole com
plex is growing by leaps and bounds,
and now the University administra
tion has joined hands with Glenn
Campbell in calling for further expan
sion," Manley said.
Manley, unlike most of his col
leagues. also objects to the commit

tee's basic recommendation that joint
appointments between Hoover and
Stanford might be mutually benefi
cial.
"If Hoover were a legitimate re
search institution without its distinc
tive political coloration, then I think
the argument for joint appointment
would make sense." he said. "Bui
Hoover's got a mission, and its mis
sion is domestic and international
anti-communism."
Initially, the Ward committee had
hoped its report would improve
damaged relations between Hoover
and Stanford. The committee urged
the University to implement its
recommendations as a signal "that
the University and the Hoover Insti
tution have embarked on a process o!
repairing the ideological and othei
rifts that have divided them in the
past."
But some political science profes
sors apparently see these rifts widen
ing into chasms.
"Since when has name calling ever
mended relations?" Manlev asked.
