# U.S. clarifies defense posture
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The White
House said yesterday that differences
within the administration over
forthcoming bargaining on its "Star
Wars" defense plan are merely "a
matter of terminology
On Sunday. Secretary of State
Cieorge Shult/ and Defense Secretar\
Caspar Weinberger appeared to dis
agree about the relationship among
the three planned sets of arms
negotiations — Star Wars, strategic
nuclear arms and medium-range nu
clear weapons.
White House spokesman Larry
Spcakes. seeking to clarify the U.S.
posture in liuht of the conflicting
statements, volunteered this account
in a briefing for reporters:
'•Interrelationships, yes" between
offensive and defensive limitations —
'"that was our basic position going in"
to the Geneva talks. "But as far as
linkage where one doesn't proceed
without the other, no. that's not our
position." Spcakes said.
"Will SDI (Strategic Defense ln
ititative or Star Wars) research con
tinue? Yes. SDI research will con
tinue. We regard it as a research pro

gram and only that. Research is diffi
cult to verify and the Soviets agree
that research is difficult to verifs.
"Is deployment of SDI negotiable?
It is premature to discuss that until we
have our research program and
decide that there is a mode (for its
deployment).. At that time we prob
ably would discuss it with the Soviets.
"Is agreement needed in all three
talks in order to implement it in any
one? That is not our view. Agreement
in one or two areas would certainly be
something we hope we could proceed
with. The Soviets may not see it that
way but we presume that would be a
topic for discussion."
Asked by reporters to sum up what
he had said. Spcakes replied that if he
were writing the story he would say.
"The White House spokesman said
today it is premature to discuss ... to
negotiate the deployment of SDI.
The spokesman went 011 to say it is a
research program and therefore it
w as too early for discussions.
Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko, in a televised appearance
with "soviet reporters in Moscow Sun

dax. said limits nn offensive arms and
space defense programs such as the
U.S. Star Wars program for destroy
ing incoming ballistic missiles "can
only he examined jointly" as part of
"a single complex."
Ciromxko said that "if no progress
were made in space, then none could
he made in the question of strategic
xveapons."
The Soviet foreign minister seemed
to concede that "scientific research
xvork" on Star Wars cannot he moni
tored and thus would be difficult to
limit through negotiations between
the two nuclear superpowers.
Me maintained, though, that the
U.S. delegation, headed by Shult/.
"told us clearly in Geneva" that
"testing" and"the stationing of
facilities" in connection with the Star
Wars program "might be
prohibited."
(iromxko max have been referring
to restrictions that already exist in the
Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM)
treaty, in which both the United
States and the Soviet Union agreed
"not to develop, test or deploy AHM

systems or components which are
sea-based, air-based, space-based or
mobile land-based.
The United States has been carry
ing out "experiments" with devices
that could be part of a future anti
ballistic missile system. But the
United States has insisted the
"experiments" tall short of "tests" of
an ABM "component." The Soviet
Union also has been modernizing the
ground-based ABM that is permitted
under the treaty and has been con
ducting experiments that, according
to the United States, are in the same
gray area of "test" and
"development."
Presidential National Security Ad
viser Robert McFarlane. interviewed
yesterday on NBC's "Today" pro
gram. said threatening statements
from (iromxko about the require
ments for accord on space defense
were "almost laughable." He charac
terized Ciromxko's remarks as "the
kind of thing you can expect to see in
the runup to formal negotiations."
