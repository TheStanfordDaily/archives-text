# Reagan, Martens discuss missiles

### 
WASHING I ON — Belgian Prime Minister
Wiltried Martens told President Reagan yesterday
that he still supports the North Atlantic Treaty Or
ganization decision to base U.S.-made, medium
range missiles in Western Europe, but he refused to
say whether Belgium will begin deploying its share
of the missiles in March as planned.
Nevertheless. U.S. officials said later that the
White House meeting had left them "optimistic"
that Martens' center-right government eventually
will go ahead with deployment of the 48 cruise
missiles despite strong domestic pressure from
antinuclear groups and opposition parties.
Reports last night from Brussels quoted Belgian
television as saying that Martens' Cabinet intends
to approve deployment "in principle" in March,
but will hold further consultations about a
timetable for actual placement of the missiles.
U.S. and Belgian officials here said they could

not confirm that report. A senior U.S. official, who
briefed reporters after the White House meeting on
condition he not be identified, replied to questions
about whether deployment will begin in March by
saying. "I would not rule anything out."
To support their expressions of optimism, the of
ficials cited Martens' public comment to Reagan as
he left the White House. He said:
"I reaffirm our attachment to the NATO dual
track decision, which is an expression of firmness in
defense and of openness for dialogue."
That was a reference to the 1979 NATO decision
to station 572 cruise and Pershing 2 missiles capa
ble of striking deep into the Soviet Union in five
NATO countries unless the Soviets agree, through
negotiations with the United States, to reduce sub
stantially the number of medium-range missiles
they have in Eastern Europe.
The U.S. officials, eager not to be perceived as

interfering in Belgium's internal affairs, were
eautiousK circumlocutions in discussing the talks
between Reagan and Martens. But they left the im
pression that Martens is trying to use the time be
tween now and Mai eh to buttress his position by
collecting expressions of public support for deploy
ment from Reagan and the leaders of other major
NATO countries.
"The Belgian government is beginning a process
of consultation with the United States and other
NATO countries before making a specific decision
on deployment, and we think the process got off to
a very good start today, the senior U.S. official
said. "After this first consultative stage, we are very
reassured".
Belgium's adherence to the NATO agree
ment is regarded as very important by the Reagan
administration.
