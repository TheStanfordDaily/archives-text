## Hoover hosts bash in capital Reagans join in celebration 
### 
WASHINGTON — President
Reagan dropped in on a party
hosted by the Hoover Institution
last night, and while he didn't bur
den his audience with all that much
to think about — "I knew we had a
recovery when they stopped calling
it Reaganomics," he said at one
point— he did leave them laughing.
"What's nice about him," said
Dennis Bark, a Hoover senior fel
low, "is that he makes people stop
worrying about whether everything
is all right and gets them to relax."
About 600 people managed to
stop worrying last night. They
relaxed by drifting between buffet
tables of roast beef, crab claws and
oysters on the half shell at the party,
held at the Corcoran Gallery of Art.
Some came from California for
the meeting of Hoover's 40-
member board of overseers. Others
came from around town because the
president did. The president came
from across the street because he's
an honorary fellow.
Hoover made Reagan its first
honorary fellow in 1975, the same
year he gave it his gubernatorial
papers. His presidential papers will
soon follow, when the Ronald
Reagan Presidential Library is built

at Stanford.
Guests shivered in the freezing
night air as they lined up outside,
waiting their turn to enter. They had
just made it when the Reagans, who
didn't have that trouble, walked
onto the platform with Hoover
Director W. Glenn Campbell, his
wife, Rita Ricardo-Campbell, and
co-host Emil Mosbacher Jr. with his
wife, Pat.
Stanford alumni at the gathering
included Supreme Court Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor and Allan
Hoover, a son of President Hoover,
the institution's founder.
Other Washington luminaries
present included Defense Secretary
Casper Weinberger, Secretary of
State George Shultz, CIA Director
William Casey and Interior Secre
tary William Clark.
Said Allan Hoover when asked if
he saw any resemblance between
Reagan and his father: "They both
speak English."
Hoover said his father got the
idea for the institution "when he
was feeding all of Western Europe
and saw a lot of documents being
destroyed. He thought they ought to
be saved and said, 'You collect all
this and I'll pay for it after the war.'

1 don't have the remotest idea what
he paid but it's priceless now. We
have stuff there the Russians have
to come over to see because they
don't have it."
Other people talked about job
swapping, reducing the deficit and
negotiating with the Soviets. The
president didn't get into specifics
about any of those topics.
"After you pass 40, you know,"
he said, "you suffer from lumbago

and the tendency to tell the same
stories."
But all eyes weren't always on the
president last night.
Nancy Reagan's black Adolfo
dinner suit, banded with elaborate
gold embroidery, drew an apprais
ing glance from one guest. "That."
the woman knowingly told her com
panion, "is a Valentino."
