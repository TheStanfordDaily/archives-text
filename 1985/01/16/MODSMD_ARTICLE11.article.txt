## The
						Stanford Daily Hot on the press 
### 
Some people think they can push the press
around. They try to use the press as a public rela
tions firm, they leak sensitive information to
reporters on purpose, and they are satisfied.
Then, when the press does what it is supposed to
do — check and report on these same organiza
tions — the subjects become a little less satisfied.
In the case of the recent "top secret" shuttle
mission, the Defense Department implied that, if
necessary, it would accuse The Washington Post
and a few other major newspapers of something
akin to treason if they released information on
the mission. The details on the defense experi
ments were discovered by reporters in much the
same way past information has been relayed to
the press. The only difference is that this time the
Pentagon honestly didn't want the details
released.
Organizations that appear frequently in the
press must begin to understand the status of the
press in society. The press should attempt to
report as much of the truth as is possible — not

just the parts certain interested parties would like
reported. There cannot be a double standard
when dealing with reported information. If an
item of interest is leaked or discovered and it is
truly newsworthy, then the responsibility of the
media is to release the details.
There must not be a distinction between differ
ent types of leaks. The self-policing mechanism
within each media body must determine whether
a tip will threaten national security or if it is ap
propriate for publication. Unplanned and un
scheduled leaks cannot be differentiated from in
tentional leaks. The media must examine all tips
on the assumption that virtually all are released
for ulterior reasons, ranging from the level of a
personal vendetta to an issue of national security.
Because the job of the press is to relay to the
public truthful information, people and organiza
tions in the news cannot continue to insist that
the press only publish information that is inten
tionally released. If they do, the power and the
importance of the press is rendered impotent.
