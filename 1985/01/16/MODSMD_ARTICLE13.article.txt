## Correct unaffirmative action

On Monday, the United States will ofti
daily celebrate the birthday of Martin Luther
King, Jr. for the first time. In doing so,
America will observe only its third national
holiday dedicated to a particular person.
Recently, the nation also witnessed the 30th
anniversary of the Supreme Court's landmark
decision in Brown v. Board of Education
which struck down the legal basis of segrega
tion. These two milestones in the history of
the black civil rights movement provide an
opportunity to take stock of our collective ef
fort to fulfill the Constitution's principle of
equality.
One may interpret the profound inability of
today's young adults to imagine a world or
ganized by racial distinctions as evidence of
genuine progress. In the Stanford community,
the effects of this belief may be seen in class
rooms, dormitories and even — God forbid —
fraternity houses.
As recently as the 19605, well-dressed
black students quietly read Goethe at an all
white Woolworth's lunch counter. Their care
fully orchestrated protest vividly
demonstrated that segregation operated not
because of innate racial supremacy but solely
on the arbitrary basis of skin color. As such,
Dr. King's campaign appealed to an idea
deeply rooted in America's frontier tradition
and political thought: equal opportunity. His
message came through loud and clear. It was
no longer relevant whether you were black or
white but only that you possessed talent and
determination.
We currently view the confrontations of the

1950s and '60s with a degree of moral clarity,
bordering on melodrama, heretofore reserved
for the Civil War and World War 11. Today,
the issue is not whether a black person can sit
at the front of a public bus but whether, for
instance, a black person should receive pref
erential treatment based on race in the job
market or the college admissions process.
Despite consistent evidence of blacks' an
tipathy toward affirmative action (a misnomer

Organizations now
have an incentive to
'prove' they are not
racist, if for no other
reason than to blunt
potential criticism.

considering the decidedly negative self
conception it produces within the targets of
such condescension), many contemporary
leaders nonetheless feel that the nation must
alter its otherwise neutral standards for social
advancement to account for the past. Apart
from explicit statutory requirements, all or
ganizations now have an incentive to "prove"
they are not racist, if for no other reason than
to blunt potential criticism. While this new

idea (aptly labeled "equality of result") may
offer a quick solution to interracial inequities,
it hardly squares with King's — or the public's
— traditional interpretation of equality.
Moreover, as economist Thomas Sowell has
warned, preferential treatment will likely
produce a new, more subtle form of racism as
the comparatively modest performance of
less-qualified black candidates will artificially
confirm fears of innate inferiority. Whether
we wish to admit it or not, this psychological
process occurs within the minds of blacks and
whites in classrooms, offices and boardrooms.
It occurs at Stanford as well.
Regarding the judiciary's role in the civil
rights campaign, many legal scholars mis
takenly characterized the Brown decision as
one which had at last enacted the proposition
that the Constitution is "colorblind." Chief
Justice Earl Warren did conclude that differ
ential treatment of the races was "inherently
unequal," but he based this finding not on a
neutral principle of equality but on the em
pirical effects of such treatment. More than
two decades later, in the controversial Bakke
decision, the court therefore could approve
the use of racial classifications which osten
sibly did not carry prejudicial intent. Com
menting on the case, the late Alexander
Bickel observed that the colorblindness of the
Constitution now depends on "whose ox is
gored." The persistent inability of the Court
to allocate rights among individuals, rather
than among individuals as members of a given
social group, thus has paralleled the change in
the objectives of the civil rights movement.

Well-intentioned leaders— both black and
white — who purport to speak for black
Americans remind us that King's "dream"
has yet to be realized, but they do not under
stand why. Indeed, the racially based view of
the world that they seek to eradicate is
precisely what augments their own political
power.
To offer a vision of a society that judges in
dividuals as individuals is rhetorically appeal
ing; more accurately, the fulfillment of that
"dream" requires courage. Whites must seek
a way to exorcise their psychological guilt that
does not stigmatize those they seek to help. In
addition, blacks can no longer use traditional
stereotypes as excuses for deficient individual
initiative. It will do no good to play the role of
the "dumb nigger" (a charade personified by
Jack Benny's sidekick "Rochester") in a soci
ety that knows that a black person can be just
as successful as anyone else.
As Tennyson once wrote: "That which we
are, we are." The record of civilization is
replete with wrongs, often perpetrated with
the noblest of intentions. Unless we invent a
magical time machine, we can never rewrite
that legacy. We must accept the moral chal
lenge of dispensing justice in the present — a
task surely of such magnitude as to require all
of our energy and spirit — before seeking to
right every injustice of human history. That
list of tragedies, after all, is not the exclusive
property of any race.
