All idiots at fault
I wake up one morning and read
in The Daily (Jan. 14) about a class
of monstrous beasts known as
"men." As a male, I understand that
these "men" are somehow related to
me and I decide to discover what
links us together. (They are, you
must understand, a constant embar
rassment to me.) From the morning's
reading 1 know several things:
"Men" are violent, they are
destructive and they oppress other
living things. Quickly running these
facts through my mind, I make a
stunning discovery: These "men" are
simply mules that are idiots! After
this great mental effort, I'm quite
hungry, so I eat lunch.
After lunch I decide that it really
is my duty, as a male, to solve the
problem of these "idiotic men." I
resolve that the most efficient solu
tion is to simply kill them all and
make the world safe for males,
females and animals. Adeptly notic
ing that to kill would cause me to
become one of these same "idiots," I
decide to alter my strategy. Instead I
will simply confine them to some sort
of prison where they will be fed and
exercised regularly, allowing them to
lead healthy, idiotic lives, well iso
lated from me and my loved ones.
Always being the sharp one.
however. I realize that this imprison
ment would be blatant physical
oppression. Beginning to clutch at
straws. I decide to send these "idiotic
men" to a training institution where
they will be taught not to be idiotic.
Sounds like a good idea, doesn't it?
Unfortunately, these idiots might not
appreciate such a systematic altera
tion of their beliefs and attitudes. I
would again have to charge m\self
with oppression, although of a
slightly more subtle variety.
I then decide to institute a care
fully thought-out program of social
change, one designed specifically not
to compromise any of my beliefs s
about idiocy. I determine (with the
latest theories of mathematical
sociology, mind you) that such a plan
will take 293.74 years to complete.
Sadly observing that this date will
occur several centuries after my
death. I put away all of my ideas
about changing the minds of the
"idiotic men" and I lapse into a deep
sleep.

The next morning, refreshed by
my sleep, I renew my search for a
solution to the problem of "men." I
think to myself, "Now, as a male,
how should I go about reaching these
distant brothers of mine, these
'men' ?" I ponder the question over
breakfast and come up with a per
sonal strategy, one which will not
depend on mass slaughter, giant
prisons, phenomenally large brain
washing camps or a "293-year plan."
My strategy is composed of a set of
resolutions which I will use to guide
my life:
1) I will personally commit no acts
of idiocy.
2) Whenever thoughts of idiotic
acts enter my mind, I will analyze the
thoughts until I realize why they are
idiotic and will reject them from my
mind. If I do not succeed, I will seek
help from my friends.
3) When confronted with an act of
idiocy committed by someone near
me, I will express my disapproval in
a rational fashion. If that is not
practical. I will seek help from my
friends.
4) I will do my best to repair any
damage done by the idiotic acts of
my "brothers."
Now. at first I feel happy and a bit
self righteous about my set of resolu
tions, but then the hard facts of the
matter hit home: These rules will be
quite hard to obey! And some of
them require "help from my friends"
— friends who must agree with the
resolutions or at least with the ideas
underlying them. Then I wonder if I
have any such friends. In fact, I see
that my plan will only be successful if
I have many such friends, and then
only if each of these friends has
many friends who are well
befriended. I need millions, even
billions of friends if I'm going to save
the world! And none of them can be
idiots!
I begin to doubt my ability to
succeed in gathering a group of such
magnitude in light of the fact that so
many before me have unsuccessfully
spent their entire lives trying to
make people agree. But in order that
my thoughts might at least have
some effect, I decide to send them to
The Daily with the hope that they
will be read and pondered.

Rape responsibility
The belief that each individual is
responsible for his or her own ac
tions may possibly be on the wane in
our day and age, but I trust that most
people, especially those of us at
Stanford, would argue otherwise. We
may rest assured that former San
Francisco Supervisor Dan White,
irrespective of how many Twinkies
he may have eaten, was responsible
for the death of San Francisco Mayor
George Moscone and Supervisor
Harvey Milk; and no matter how
disturbed Charles Manson or the
Trailside Killer may have been, they
nonetheless had to accept the conse
quences of their behavior; and if a
man rapes a woman, he too is guilty
of a grievous crime and must accept
responsibility. Only lawyers argue
otherwise. Consequently, when I had
the misfortune of reading Noel Han
rahan's viewpoint (The Daily, Jan.
14), I was a bit perturbed.
It seems Hanrahan wishes to
engender in the male species the
burdensome guilt of "The Rapist."
According to Hanrahan, it is not just
the individual rapist who is at fault
here but "all men perpetuate the
conditions of women's oppression
through their passive and active
complicity. I do not draw distinctions
between good men and rapists. 1
cannot, when so much of my experi
ence and knowledge defy this divi
sion." A rather harsh indictment of
the male species if 1 have ever heard
one. I would endeavor to argue her
point, but opinion not based on
reason cannot be removed by argu
ment. 1 can only say than any man
who rapes a woman is a fiend who
merits the punishment of a fiend.
But if we are to discuss the problem
of "rape," we would discover that it
is the fault of society: men and
women. The pervasiveness of the
moral depravity that nurtures many
of our youth to perverseness is not
strictly the fault of men. If women
refused to appear in pornographic
magazines, we simply wouldn't have
such magazines. And for every vul
gar fraternity song, rest assured some
sorority has one to match. The
stereotypes and the ignorance that
exacerbate the phenomenon of rape
are also the fault of women.

More economics
It is gratifying to note that in his
most recent column (The Daily, Jan.
8) Loren Borud has taken the time
to check at least some of his facts
before publication. Unfortunately,
Borud persists in reaching erroneous
conclusions about the causes and
events of the Reagan recession and
recovery.
After their much-anticipated
boom of 1982 turned to bust,
supply-siders began to cast about for
an explanation. They apparently
found it in the recovery of 1983.
Because the final-round tax cuts
took effect in 1983, supply-siders
argued that workers and investors
had simply delayed their production
plans until January 1983 to take
advantage of the even lower tax rate
that would then be applicable.
Beginning on Jan. 1, everything
would work according to the supply
side hypothesis: Workers would
work more, businesses would
produce more, and stores and
warehouses would be flooded with
the newly produced goods. The extra
supply of goods and services on the
market would keep prices low, en
abling consumers to purchase the
increased production. This is the
argument recited in Borud's column.
Unfortunately for the supply-siders,
it didn't happen that way.
The pattern of the recession and
recovery is outlined in great detail in
the "Economic Report of the Presi
dent" for 1984. Shortly after the first
Reagan tax cut took effect, consumer
spending lifted out of the doldrums.
The increased spending intensified
after the second round of tax cuts in
July 1982. This spending gradually
depleted inventories, which had been
at an all-time high in 1981. By No
vember 1982, inventories reached a
low point that prompted businesses
to increase production in order to
meet the rising demand, and the
recovery officially began. (I should
point out that industrial production
increased in December 1982, con
trary to Borud's claim.) A supply-led
recovery would have happened in
precisely the reverse order, but most
supply-siders conveniently ignore
this fact. Of course, it has often been
noted that when ideology is at stake,
false hypotheses die hard.

irrespective of how many Twinkies
he may have eaten, was responsible
for the death of San Francisco Mayor
George Moscone and Supervisor
Harvey Milk; and no matter how
disturbed Charles Manson or the
Trailside Killer may have been, they
nonetheless had to accept the conse
quences of their behavior; and if a
man rapes a woman, he too is guilty
of a grievous crime and must accept
responsibility. Only lawyers argue
otherwise. Consequently, when I had
the misfortune of reading Noel Han
rahan's viewpoint (The Daily, Jan.
14), I was a bit perturbed.
It seems Hanrahan wishes to
engender in the male species the
burdensome guilt of "The Rapist."
According to Hanrahan, it is not just
the individual rapist who is at fault
here but "all men perpetuate the
conditions of women's oppression
through their passive and active
complicity. I do not draw distinctions
between good men and rapists. 1
cannot, when so much of my experi
ence and knowledge defy this divi
sion." A rather harsh indictment of
the male species if 1 have ever heard
one. I would endeavor to argue her
point, but opinion not based on
reason cannot be removed by argu
ment. 1 can only say than any man
who rapes a woman is a fiend who
merits the punishment of a fiend.
But if we are to discuss the problem
of "rape," we would discover that it
is the fault of society: men and
women. The pervasiveness of the
moral depravity that nurtures many
of our youth to perverseness is not
strictly the fault of men. If women
refused to appear in pornographic
magazines, we simply wouldn't have
such magazines. And for every vul
gar fraternity song, rest assured some
sorority has one to match. The
stereotypes and the ignorance that
exacerbate the phenomenon of rape
are also the fault of women.

More economics
It is gratifying to note that in his
most recent column (The Daily, Jan.
8) Loren Borud has taken the time
to check at least some of his facts
before publication. Unfortunately,
Borud persists in reaching erroneous
conclusions about the causes and
events of the Reagan recession and
recovery.
After their much-anticipated
boom of 1982 turned to bust,
supply-siders began to cast about for
an explanation. They apparently
found it in the recovery of 1983.
Because the final-round tax cuts
took effect in 1983, supply-siders
argued that workers and investors
had simply delayed their production
plans until January 1983 to take
advantage of the even lower tax rate
that would then be applicable.
Beginning on Jan. 1, everything
would work according to the supply
side hypothesis: Workers would
work more, businesses would
produce more, and stores and
warehouses would be flooded with
the newly produced goods. The extra
supply of goods and services on the
market would keep prices low, en
abling consumers to purchase the
increased production. This is the
argument recited in Borud's column.
Unfortunately for the supply-siders,
it didn't happen that way.
The pattern of the recession and
recovery is outlined in great detail in
the "Economic Report of the Presi
dent" for 1984. Shortly after the first
Reagan tax cut took effect, consumer
spending lifted out of the doldrums.
The increased spending intensified
after the second round of tax cuts in
July 1982. This spending gradually
depleted inventories, which had been
at an all-time high in 1981. By No
vember 1982, inventories reached a
low point that prompted businesses
to increase production in order to
meet the rising demand, and the
recovery officially began. (I should
point out that industrial production
increased in December 1982, con
trary to Borud's claim.) A supply-led
recovery would have happened in
precisely the reverse order, but most
supply-siders conveniently ignore
this fact. Of course, it has often been
noted that when ideology is at stake,
false hypotheses die hard.

All idiots at fault
I wake up one morning and read
in The Daily (Jan. 14) about a class
of monstrous beasts known as
"men." As a male, I understand that
these "men" are somehow related to
me and I decide to discover what
links us together. (They are, you
must understand, a constant embar
rassment to me.) From the morning's
reading 1 know several things:
"Men" are violent, they are
destructive and they oppress other
living things. Quickly running these
facts through my mind, I make a
stunning discovery: These "men" are
simply mules that are idiots! After
this great mental effort, I'm quite
hungry, so I eat lunch.
After lunch I decide that it really
is my duty, as a male, to solve the
problem of these "idiotic men." I
resolve that the most efficient solu
tion is to simply kill them all and
make the world safe for males,
females and animals. Adeptly notic
ing that to kill would cause me to
become one of these same "idiots," I
decide to alter my strategy. Instead I
will simply confine them to some sort
of prison where they will be fed and
exercised regularly, allowing them to
lead healthy, idiotic lives, well iso
lated from me and my loved ones.
Always being the sharp one.
however. I realize that this imprison
ment would be blatant physical
oppression. Beginning to clutch at
straws. I decide to send these "idiotic
men" to a training institution where
they will be taught not to be idiotic.
Sounds like a good idea, doesn't it?
Unfortunately, these idiots might not
appreciate such a systematic altera
tion of their beliefs and attitudes. I
would again have to charge m\self
with oppression, although of a
slightly more subtle variety.
I then decide to institute a care
fully thought-out program of social
change, one designed specifically not
to compromise any of my beliefs s
about idiocy. I determine (with the
latest theories of mathematical
sociology, mind you) that such a plan
will take 293.74 years to complete.
Sadly observing that this date will
occur several centuries after my
death. I put away all of my ideas
about changing the minds of the
"idiotic men" and I lapse into a deep
sleep.

The next morning, refreshed by
my sleep, I renew my search for a
solution to the problem of "men." I
think to myself, "Now, as a male,
how should I go about reaching these
distant brothers of mine, these
'men' ?" I ponder the question over
breakfast and come up with a per
sonal strategy, one which will not
depend on mass slaughter, giant
prisons, phenomenally large brain
washing camps or a "293-year plan."
My strategy is composed of a set of
resolutions which I will use to guide
my life:
1) I will personally commit no acts
of idiocy.
2) Whenever thoughts of idiotic
acts enter my mind, I will analyze the
thoughts until I realize why they are
idiotic and will reject them from my
mind. If I do not succeed, I will seek
help from my friends.
3) When confronted with an act of
idiocy committed by someone near
me, I will express my disapproval in
a rational fashion. If that is not
practical. I will seek help from my
friends.
4) I will do my best to repair any
damage done by the idiotic acts of
my "brothers."
Now. at first I feel happy and a bit
self righteous about my set of resolu
tions, but then the hard facts of the
matter hit home: These rules will be
quite hard to obey! And some of
them require "help from my friends"
— friends who must agree with the
resolutions or at least with the ideas
underlying them. Then I wonder if I
have any such friends. In fact, I see
that my plan will only be successful if
I have many such friends, and then
only if each of these friends has
many friends who are well
befriended. I need millions, even
billions of friends if I'm going to save
the world! And none of them can be
idiots!
I begin to doubt my ability to
succeed in gathering a group of such
magnitude in light of the fact that so
many before me have unsuccessfully
spent their entire lives trying to
make people agree. But in order that
my thoughts might at least have
some effect, I decide to send them to
The Daily with the hope that they
will be read and pondered.

this great mental effort, I'm quite
hungry, so I eat lunch.
After lunch I decide that it really
is my duty, as a male, to solve the
problem of these "idiotic men." I
resolve that the most efficient solu
tion is to simply kill them all and
make the world safe for males,
females and animals. Adeptly notic
ing that to kill would cause me to
become one of these same "idiots," I
decide to alter my strategy. Instead I
will simply confine them to some sort
of prison where they will be fed and
exercised regularly, allowing them to
lead healthy, idiotic lives, well iso
lated from me and my loved ones.
Always being the sharp one.
however. I realize that this imprison
ment would be blatant physical
oppression. Beginning to clutch at
straws. I decide to send these "idiotic
men" to a training institution where
they will be taught not to be idiotic.
Sounds like a good idea, doesn't it?
Unfortunately, these idiots might not
appreciate such a systematic altera
tion of their beliefs and attitudes. I
would again have to charge m\self
with oppression, although of a
slightly more subtle variety.
I then decide to institute a care
fully thought-out program of social
change, one designed specifically not
to compromise any of my beliefs s
about idiocy. I determine (with the
latest theories of mathematical
sociology, mind you) that such a plan
will take 293.74 years to complete.
Sadly observing that this date will
occur several centuries after my
death. I put away all of my ideas
about changing the minds of the
"idiotic men" and I lapse into a deep
sleep.

The next morning, refreshed by
my sleep, I renew my search for a
solution to the problem of "men." I
think to myself, "Now, as a male,
how should I go about reaching these
distant brothers of mine, these
'men' ?" I ponder the question over
breakfast and come up with a per
sonal strategy, one which will not
depend on mass slaughter, giant
prisons, phenomenally large brain
washing camps or a "293-year plan."
My strategy is composed of a set of
resolutions which I will use to guide
my life:
1) I will personally commit no acts
of idiocy.
2) Whenever thoughts of idiotic
acts enter my mind, I will analyze the
thoughts until I realize why they are
idiotic and will reject them from my
mind. If I do not succeed, I will seek
help from my friends.
3) When confronted with an act of
idiocy committed by someone near
me, I will express my disapproval in
a rational fashion. If that is not
practical. I will seek help from my
friends.
4) I will do my best to repair any
damage done by the idiotic acts of
my "brothers."
Now. at first I feel happy and a bit
self righteous about my set of resolu
tions, but then the hard facts of the
matter hit home: These rules will be
quite hard to obey! And some of
them require "help from my friends"
— friends who must agree with the
resolutions or at least with the ideas
underlying them. Then I wonder if I
have any such friends. In fact, I see
that my plan will only be successful if
I have many such friends, and then
only if each of these friends has
many friends who are well
befriended. I need millions, even
billions of friends if I'm going to save
the world! And none of them can be
idiots!
I begin to doubt my ability to
succeed in gathering a group of such
magnitude in light of the fact that so
many before me have unsuccessfully
spent their entire lives trying to
make people agree. But in order that
my thoughts might at least have
some effect, I decide to send them to
The Daily with the hope that they
will be read and pondered.

Rape responsibility
The belief that each individual is
responsible for his or her own ac
tions may possibly be on the wane in
our day and age, but I trust that most
people, especially those of us at
Stanford, would argue otherwise. We
may rest assured that former San
Francisco Supervisor Dan White,
irrespective of how many Twinkies
he may have eaten, was responsible
for the death of San Francisco Mayor
George Moscone and Supervisor
Harvey Milk; and no matter how
disturbed Charles Manson or the
Trailside Killer may have been, they
nonetheless had to accept the conse
quences of their behavior; and if a
man rapes a woman, he too is guilty
of a grievous crime and must accept
responsibility. Only lawyers argue
otherwise. Consequently, when I had
the misfortune of reading Noel Han
rahan's viewpoint (The Daily, Jan.
14), I was a bit perturbed.
It seems Hanrahan wishes to
engender in the male species the
burdensome guilt of "The Rapist."
According to Hanrahan, it is not just
the individual rapist who is at fault
here but "all men perpetuate the
conditions of women's oppression
through their passive and active
complicity. I do not draw distinctions
between good men and rapists. 1
cannot, when so much of my experi
ence and knowledge defy this divi
sion." A rather harsh indictment of
the male species if 1 have ever heard
one. I would endeavor to argue her
point, but opinion not based on
reason cannot be removed by argu
ment. 1 can only say than any man
who rapes a woman is a fiend who
merits the punishment of a fiend.
But if we are to discuss the problem
of "rape," we would discover that it
is the fault of society: men and
women. The pervasiveness of the
moral depravity that nurtures many
of our youth to perverseness is not
strictly the fault of men. If women
refused to appear in pornographic
magazines, we simply wouldn't have
such magazines. And for every vul
gar fraternity song, rest assured some
sorority has one to match. The
stereotypes and the ignorance that
exacerbate the phenomenon of rape
are also the fault of women.

More economics
It is gratifying to note that in his
most recent column (The Daily, Jan.
8) Loren Borud has taken the time
to check at least some of his facts
before publication. Unfortunately,
Borud persists in reaching erroneous
conclusions about the causes and
events of the Reagan recession and
recovery.
After their much-anticipated
boom of 1982 turned to bust,
supply-siders began to cast about for
an explanation. They apparently
found it in the recovery of 1983.
Because the final-round tax cuts
took effect in 1983, supply-siders
argued that workers and investors
had simply delayed their production
plans until January 1983 to take
advantage of the even lower tax rate
that would then be applicable.
Beginning on Jan. 1, everything
would work according to the supply
side hypothesis: Workers would
work more, businesses would
produce more, and stores and
warehouses would be flooded with
the newly produced goods. The extra
supply of goods and services on the
market would keep prices low, en
abling consumers to purchase the
increased production. This is the
argument recited in Borud's column.
Unfortunately for the supply-siders,
it didn't happen that way.
The pattern of the recession and
recovery is outlined in great detail in
the "Economic Report of the Presi
dent" for 1984. Shortly after the first
Reagan tax cut took effect, consumer
spending lifted out of the doldrums.
The increased spending intensified
after the second round of tax cuts in
July 1982. This spending gradually
depleted inventories, which had been
at an all-time high in 1981. By No
vember 1982, inventories reached a
low point that prompted businesses
to increase production in order to
meet the rising demand, and the
recovery officially began. (I should
point out that industrial production
increased in December 1982, con
trary to Borud's claim.) A supply-led
recovery would have happened in
precisely the reverse order, but most
supply-siders conveniently ignore
this fact. Of course, it has often been
noted that when ideology is at stake,
false hypotheses die hard.
