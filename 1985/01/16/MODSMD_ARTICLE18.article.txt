## Does Stanford need the 'Super' image? 
### GREGORY WEINGARTEN Staff writer 
Super Bowl weekend brings to
Stanford an army of corporate elites,
powerful alumni and football fans

who will descend on campus en masse
for a series of elaborate tailgaters,
parties and social events. Following
the hordes of people, will be an
equally large army assigned to cover
the events — the media. TV, radio
and print journalists will all be there
in force to document the highest
rated spectacle of the year.
Some welcome the attention and
publicity that the Super Bowl brings
to Stanford.
"If there could possibly be young
people who are athletically inclined
who've never heard of Stanford
before this weekend, I think they will
all have heard of Stanford by the end

of it, and I think that that's a positive
thing," said Athletic Director Andy
Geiger.
There are many others, though,
among the faculty and students who

are less enthusiastic about the game
and the extra attention given to the
University.
"Who is Stanford competing
against — Harvard or Madison
Square Garden?" asked David Lem
pert, a graduate student in the law
and business schools here.
"This is a giant advertisement for
Stanford. They get free media time to

present their propaganda, and they
get to give a 'freebie' to their major
donors," he added.
In a session of the Faculty Senate
last week, English Prof. John Bender
asked President Donald Kennedy, "Is
this the kind of super publicity act we
should have at our masthead?"
"I guess," Bender added, "I would
speak for a fair number of people
who are distressed with some of the
fantasies floating around in the press
that regular Super Bowl events are
turning the stadium into a center for
some kind of activity that is not
central to the Universitv."
At the meeting, Kennedy told
Bender that he had already said "no"
when asked whether Stanford would
make "some kind of advance com
mitment to host a later game."
Kennedy's assistant, Robert
Hamrdla, said, "It's public fact that
Stanford is hosting the game for a
matter of service to the community."
Many, though, question the Uni
versity's reasoning.
"I understand the benefits that
come from it, and I understand the
pressures that were brought to bear
from local community leaders and I
understand the argument that we're
doing it as a kind of community ser

vice," said Political Science Prof.
John Manley.
"But," he continued, "I think were
doing it ... at some risk to our
reputation, and I am not sure the
rewards are worth it."
Manley called the Super Bowl
"probably the single most commer
cial event of the year." He said to
host the game involved Stanford in an
incredible commercialization effort
which, in his opinion, doesn't serve
the University's best interest.
"I don't think it (the Super Bowl)
will enhance it (Stanford's image),"
Manley said. "A lot of people at
Stanford spend a lot of time worrying
about whether or not we will ever
become on a par with Harvard, Yale,
Princeton and places like that.
"I think we might well ask our
selves . . . even if they had a facility
that housed 85,000 people whether
or not Harvard, for example, would
lend itself to this kind of activity," he
said. "I think they would think better
of it as, now that it comes to us, many
people at Stanford are doing . . ."
Lempert said the Super Bowl was
not bad for Stanford but must be
viewed in the context of everything
the University has done. He included
the Super Bowl in Stanford's attempt
to latch onto "popular symbols" over

the past two years.
He cited the Olympic soccer
games, the visit of Queen Elizabeth
and the Reagan library as other
"popular s\mbols."

Lempert said there is an insecurity
among leaders of the University who
are so concerned with their image
"that they've forgotten what a Uni
versity is about."
"They're reaching out to big busi
ness and politicians, and reaching out
to the status quo without challenging
it with new ideas," Lempert said.
Lempert also said the University's

greatest fear, the "fun and sun at
Stanford image" is becoming a self
fulfilled prophecy.
Manley criticized the decision
making apparatus which brought the

Super Bowl to Stanford.
"This is another example of top
down decision making in which we
are presented with a decision ad
ministratively with little if any effort
made to gather input from relevant
people like faculty and students,"
Manley said.
Geiger, on the other hand, views
the Super Bowl as an "educational"
experience.
"I think that just the laboratory ex
perience of having something like this
here is part of the overall dimension
of Stanford that's consistent with it
academically in the context of its edu
cational thrust," he said.

Manley called the Super Bowl
"probably the single most commer
cial event of the year." He said to
host the game involved Stanford in an
incredible commercialization effort
which, in his opinion, doesn't serve
the University's best interest.
"I don't think it (the Super Bowl)
will enhance it (Stanford's image),"
Manley said. "A lot of people at
Stanford spend a lot of time worrying
about whether or not we will ever
become on a par with Harvard, Yale,
Princeton and places like that.
"I think we might well ask our
selves . . . even if they had a facility
that housed 85,000 people whether
or not Harvard, for example, would
lend itself to this kind of activity," he
said. "I think they would think better
of it as, now that it comes to us, many
people at Stanford are doing . . ."
Lempert said the Super Bowl was
not bad for Stanford but must be
viewed in the context of everything
the University has done. He included
the Super Bowl in Stanford's attempt
to latch onto "popular symbols" over

the past two years.
He cited the Olympic soccer
games, the visit of Queen Elizabeth
and the Reagan library as other
"popular s\mbols."

Lempert said there is an insecurity
among leaders of the University who
are so concerned with their image
"that they've forgotten what a Uni
versity is about."
"They're reaching out to big busi
ness and politicians, and reaching out
to the status quo without challenging
it with new ideas," Lempert said.
Lempert also said the University's

greatest fear, the "fun and sun at
Stanford image" is becoming a self
fulfilled prophecy.
Manley criticized the decision
making apparatus which brought the

Super Bowl to Stanford.
"This is another example of top
down decision making in which we
are presented with a decision ad
ministratively with little if any effort
made to gather input from relevant
people like faculty and students,"
Manley said.
Geiger, on the other hand, views
the Super Bowl as an "educational"
experience.
"I think that just the laboratory ex
perience of having something like this
here is part of the overall dimension
of Stanford that's consistent with it
academically in the context of its edu
cational thrust," he said.

Super Bowl weekend brings to
Stanford an army of corporate elites,
powerful alumni and football fans

who will descend on campus en masse
for a series of elaborate tailgaters,
parties and social events. Following
the hordes of people, will be an
equally large army assigned to cover
the events — the media. TV, radio
and print journalists will all be there
in force to document the highest
rated spectacle of the year.
Some welcome the attention and
publicity that the Super Bowl brings
to Stanford.
"If there could possibly be young
people who are athletically inclined
who've never heard of Stanford
before this weekend, I think they will
all have heard of Stanford by the end

of it, and I think that that's a positive
thing," said Athletic Director Andy
Geiger.
There are many others, though,
among the faculty and students who

are less enthusiastic about the game
and the extra attention given to the
University.
"Who is Stanford competing
against — Harvard or Madison
Square Garden?" asked David Lem
pert, a graduate student in the law
and business schools here.
"This is a giant advertisement for
Stanford. They get free media time to

present their propaganda, and they
get to give a 'freebie' to their major
donors," he added.
In a session of the Faculty Senate
last week, English Prof. John Bender
asked President Donald Kennedy, "Is
this the kind of super publicity act we
should have at our masthead?"
"I guess," Bender added, "I would
speak for a fair number of people
who are distressed with some of the
fantasies floating around in the press
that regular Super Bowl events are
turning the stadium into a center for
some kind of activity that is not
central to the Universitv."
At the meeting, Kennedy told
Bender that he had already said "no"
when asked whether Stanford would
make "some kind of advance com
mitment to host a later game."
Kennedy's assistant, Robert
Hamrdla, said, "It's public fact that
Stanford is hosting the game for a
matter of service to the community."
Many, though, question the Uni
versity's reasoning.
"I understand the benefits that
come from it, and I understand the
pressures that were brought to bear
from local community leaders and I
understand the argument that we're
doing it as a kind of community ser

vice," said Political Science Prof.
John Manley.
"But," he continued, "I think were
doing it ... at some risk to our
reputation, and I am not sure the
rewards are worth it."
Manley called the Super Bowl
"probably the single most commer
cial event of the year." He said to
host the game involved Stanford in an
