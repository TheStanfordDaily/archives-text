Strippers at halftime
We thought the "Incomparable Leland Stanford Junior
Univeristy Marching Band" was good at making, err . . .
headlines. Well, wait until you attend an Idaho State Uni
versity football game, and witness the reaction when its
Pep Band launches into it's rendition of "The Stripper."
For three years running, a group of male fans have
stripped all of their clothes off at the very first note of the
song and danced around in the stands.
The ISU Pep Band would like to put an end to it,
however, so Band Director David Misal has announced
that the band will no longer play "The Stripper."
Misal complained that, "It's just not funny anymore.
Four or five guys do what they think is a comedy routine.
They don't even have good bodies."
The strippers, all alleged members of the ISU track
team, have proven to be a hard lot to stop. Since the band
has ceased to play the song, they have begun to bring a
cassette and tape deck to the games, and then proceed in
baring all anyway.
The band continues to try and outwit or at least outplay
the determined strippers by "drowning them out with an
other sons," according to Misal.

Run for credit at UCSB
"People work out on the course all the time," said Uni
versity of California at Santa Barbara teacher Judith Dale.
Only Dale is no regular teacher, and neither is this a

"regular course." At least it's one that has never been
found in a Stanford time schedule.
The course in question is a jogging course, on which
Dale teaches a "Jogging and Fitness" class.
The cost of the course vyas estimated at over $1,000,
which was contributed by Wells Fargo Bank.
When the money had been donated, the American
Heart Association chose UCSB to develop the course be
cause "UCSB is a campus concerned with physical fit
ness."
Kent State and new cars
If Andy Geiger is still worried about the dropping at
tendance at Stanford football games, he might learn a les
son or two from the Kent State University athletic pro
gram.
On a Saturday afternoon, while students and assorted
fans of the Kent State Golden Flashes were busy watching
the players speed down the field, a contest was being held
which would allow the winner to speed away from the
game in a new white 1980 Chevrolet Chevette.
Freshman Amy Dix , an art major, was the happy win
ner of the Chevette, given away at the KSU-Bowling
Green football game.
"I couldn't believe it," was the line uttered by Dix when
she heard her name announced as the car winner.
The contest began at Kent State's first football game,
and students were allowed to put as many entries as they
wanted into a box.

Maybe, just maybe, if Geiger offered a few tickets to
local car dealers for this Sunday's game at Stanford
Stadium (what game could that be?), he could pos
sibly persuade them to donate cars to "boost attendence"
at Stanford's home games?

Northwesterners master
the art of meditation
Have you ever been "softly tapped on the top of
your head?"
Northwestern University students described the contin
uous chanting of a Sanskrit phrase as feeling like such a
soft tapping.
Nevertheless, an anonymous guest instructor purported
to bring the students in attendance a "finer understanding
of meditation."
"One way to understand meditation is to do it," said
Prof. George Bond, an associate professor of history and
literature of religions, who brought the guest instructor
into his class.
The instructor compared meditation with a shampoo
that "goes where your head needs it," because it benefits
different people in different ways.
To explain public acceptance of meditation, the instruc
tor told a story of a land where people didn't sleep. The
people walked around irritated and grumpy until one per
son got fed up, took a boat and left, she said.
The person sailed to an island where people were prac
ticing a concept called "sleep." At first the traveler
thought it was "weird," but as he learned the technique
from the masters, he found its relaxing benefits.
After the group chanted for 10 minutes, the instructor
quieted the room and told them to chant silently to them
selves. The silence lasted 15 minutes.

Rinky Dinky in Jersey
In considering the scope of higher education, one
usually concludes that Princeton University has quite a lot
going for it. Not only is Princeton respected for its present
and past academic successes, hut it also boasts one of the
prettiest coeds on campus in world-renowned model
Brooke Shields.
However, until recently there was one thing which
Princeton felt the lack of — a dinky.
At a cost of nearly $900,000, the dinky, according to
university officials was well worth it. And though Prince
ton plans to spend $400,000 more on a variety of dinky
repairs, even that hasn't quelled the excitement which the
university is experiencing over this new acquisition.
"We feel more comfortable if we own (the dinky) than
if someone else does." Robert Durkee, vice president for
public affairs, explained. Though he went on to say that
only one building will be sufficient to house the dinky, he
also added that the university plans to have an architect
take a look at the dinky as soon as possible to decide what
else could be done with it.
Princeton president, Bowen. said that the dinky will of
fer the university the chance to improve neglected areas of
the campus. What's more, he hopes the dinky will provide
a "safer and more effective connection between Forbes
College and the (Princeton) campus."
The dinky will definitely create a demand for long-term
parking spaces nearby, and to provide for this need,
Princeton is committed to providing 150 commuter
parking spaces near the dinky.
University officials are certain that students will reap
great benefits from the dinky. And if past experience is
any indication, then the dinky, Princeton's nickname for a
nearby train station formerly owned by New Jersey Tran
sit— will be much more than a "dinkv" success.
