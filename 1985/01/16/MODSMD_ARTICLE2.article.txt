# SCIRE changes cause controversy

Following the recent decision to relocate or dis
solve certain interdepartmental programs here,
those involved in the programs are not sure stu
dents will be the ones to benefit.
According to Carolyn Lougee, associate dean of
the Humanities and Sciences, part of the regret ex
pressed by students is probably due to confusion
caused by a Daily article printed Monday. The arti
cle listed the Stanford Workshops on Political and
Social Issues (SWOPSI). the Undergraduate Spe
cial Program (UGS) and the Undergraduate Re
search Opportunities (U RO) as programs to be dis
mantled by Sept. 1.
While the Student Center for Innovation in Re
search and Education (SCIRE) and the Action Re
search Liaison Office (ARLO) will be dissolved,
Lougee said the staffs and functions of SWOPSI,
UGS and URO will be retained and combined in a
new extradepartmental center.

"It's not the case that we're dissolving all five
programs," Lougee said.
The decision to dissolve SCIRE and ARLO and
to relocate and combine SWOPSI, UGS and URO
came after a committee's year-long investigation of
extradepartmental programs. Lougee appointed
the committee, which was headed by Economics
Prof. Kenneth Arrow.
Noel Hanrahan, program co-director for
SWOPSI, said the planned changes would be an
improvement.
"The fundamental philosophy of SWOPSI is not
going to be changed, and we're happy to have the
support of the University," Hanrahan said.
According to Hanrahan, Lougee assured
SWOPSI directors that student involvement would
remain at the same level.
"For us that means that re-emphasis on the pro
gram and renewed support can only help," she said.
Although Lougee said the "functions and aims"
of the dissolved ARLO and SCIRE will be rel
ocated in the Public Service Center, SCIRE Pro

gram Assistant Becky Fischbach said SCIRE has
effectively been "abolished."
SCIRE serves to give accreditation for intern
ships that are interdisciplinary, according to SCIRE
co-director Judy Adams. When departmental
credit is given only to majors within that depart
ment, SCIRE also grants general credits toward
graduation.
Adams said the decision to dismantle SCIRE
suggests that students would no longer be able to
get credit for interdisciplinary internships except
through individual departments.
"Our concern is not so much with the survival of
the agency as with the survival of certain academic
functions," Adams said. "We don't feel that there
has been sufficient reassurance to date that those
academic functions will be continued."
SCIRE Co-Director Teresa Rodriguez expressed
doubts that the Public Service Center would be
