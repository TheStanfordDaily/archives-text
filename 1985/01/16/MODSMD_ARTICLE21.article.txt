# Engineering prof invents far-flying disc

The Aerobie, by Superflight, a
Frisbee-type disc described as "The
Astonishing Flying Ring," is flying
out of the bookstore almost as fast as
each new shipment comes in, accord
ing to Lois Kleinkauf, gift buyer.

"They've been selling very well,"
Kleinkauf said.
What gives the Aerobie such ap
peal in the Stanford community? Part
of it may be due to hometown pride,
because the product was patented by
Stanford mechanical engineering lec

turer Alan Adler.
Adler, who is also an engineering
consultant in Silicon Valley, possesses
over 20 patents, but most of them are
for high-technology products.
"About 10 years ago, I realized I had
all these patents," Adler recalls, "and

all of them were on things I wouldn't
even buy myself. They're too expen
sive. I'm working on a tape recorder
now that would cost SI million."'
As a result, Adlcr decided to pat
ent a few products that he thought he
might he inclined to purchase himself.
Adler's first patented Hying disk,
the Skyro. is currently listed in the
Guinness Book of World Records as
the world's farthest-thrown object.
Tom Mcßann, a Stanford physical
education instructor, set the record in
Golden Gate Park with a toss of 857
feet, 8 inches.
Mcßann teaches a one-unit course
here on flying discs, in which the
Skyro and now the Aerobie are in
cluded.
Picking up pointers from Mcßann
on the technicalities of throwing
could be worth $1,000 to someone.
Each Aerobie, which is designed to
fly with control, accuracy and dis
tance comes with a promise of a
$1,000 prize for the first person to
outdistance Mcßann's record.
In addition to being designed for
long-distance throws, the Aerobie
also offers maximum control for the
recreational thrower. By bending, or
"tuning," the Aerobie, one can actu
ally eliminate unwanted curving in
the throw.
The Aerobie is available for $6.95,
a cost which is on par with the
topflight Frisbees on the market, ac
cording to Adler. The rings are made
of thermoplastic rubber and poly
carbonate. "The materials are much
more expensive than most Frisbees,"
Adler explained.
Since Adler put the Aerobie on the
market in early December, demand
has been on the upswing. " Right now,
I have 50 or 60 retailers, and I have a
lot of orders I haven't been able to fill
yet," he said. "I'm going to be ship
ping several thousand in the next
week."
The bookstore has already sold out
of Aerobies three times, so customers
may want to check elsewhere in the
Palo Alto area if the supply runs low
again.

Mechanical engineering lecturer, Alan Adler, recently launced this frisbee-like disc called the Aerobie
which he designed to fly farther and straighter than your run-of-the-mill flying disc.

An earlier invention of Adler's, the Skyro, has a place in the Guinness
Book of World Records as the farthest-thrown object. Adler promises
$1,000 to the person who beats this record.
