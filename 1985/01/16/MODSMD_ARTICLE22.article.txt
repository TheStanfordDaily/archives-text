Escondido smoke detectors
Preliminary work has begun on a
project to install smoke detectors in
Escondido Village and six residence
halls, according to Terry McGovern
of the Facilities Management Office.
The installation, which is expected
to be completed by summer, will
bring the University into compliance
with a Santa Clara County ordinance
that requires smoke detectors in all
buildings used for sleeping.
The apartments in the low-rise
buildings in Escondido Village, in
cluding Mirrielees, will receive indi
vidual "hard-wired" smoke detectors
that will be attached to the house
wiring system and will eliminate the
need for batteries. McGovern said.
The seven Escondido village high
rise buildings also will have a unit in
each household, as well as a system in
the corridors and common spaces that
will be connected to the local fire de
partment.
Actual installation in the
residences is expected to begin in the
spring. The affected houses are Crot

hers. Crothers Memorial. Stern. Wil
bur. Florence Moore and Lagunita.
All other residences already are
equipped with smoke detection sys
tems. McGovern said.
Cost for the project is estimated at
around $550,000.
McCarthy critical
Computer Science Prof. John
McCarthy in a Faculty Senate
meeting Jan. 10 criticized the Univer
sity's efforts toward computerization,
saying Stanford was 10 years behind
the times in bringing word processing
to students and may be backing the
wrong technology in networking.
McCarthy, one of the developers of
the science of artificial intelligence,
made his criticism at a Faculty Senate
meeting at which Robert Street, vice
provost for computing and head of
the Academic Computing and Infor
mation Systems, reported to the Sen
ate on ACIS's progress and budget.
Street reported on the clusters of
microcomputers now being estab
lished around the campus, at

residence halls and libraries and in
the former bowling alley at Tresidder.
The goal is eventually to provide
every Stanford student with access to
the computing power he or she needs.
But McCarthy said: "I believe . . .
that you are making progress toward
this goal much more slowly relative to
the available technology.
I would like to see (someone).

whether it's the senate or somebody
else . . . ask you for a definite plan or
time schedule to provide this word
processing capability." he said.
He also said he was afraid ACIS's
plans were based on technology that
might not prevail over time, particu
larly for SUNet. the University's
coming data network.
"It seems to me as you describe
things there's a kind of static goal of
what will be in this Utopian world of
the future with regard to Stanford's
computer facilities. What I worry
about is that the things being cur
rently planned will be. for one reason
or another, obsolete by the time they
are implemented.''

1.062 applicants.
$1.2 million grant to Hoover
The Hoover Institution has been
awarded a $ 1.2 million grant by the J.
Howard Pew Freedom Trust, Hoover
Director W. Glenn Campbell an
nounced last week.
"The grant for fiscal year 1984-85
makes a significant contribution to

the support of several research pro
grams at the Hoover Institution,"
Campbell said.
The funds are to be allocated
among the following programs: $1
million. Domestic Studies Program;
$100,000, National Fellows Program;
and $100,000. National Security Af
fairs Program.
In addition, this private sector
urant will be applied to the Hoover
Institution's participation in a Na
tional Endowment for the
Humanities challenge grant.
New undergrad advising director
Audrey Bernfield. coordinator of
departmental student sciences in the
School of Humanities and Sciences,
has been appointed director of under
graduate advising at Stanford, Dean
Norman Wessells has announced.
Bernfield will identify and analyze
undergraduate advising needs, design
innovative programs to serve those
needs and recruit and train faculty
and staff members to serve as ad
visers.
