# Eye on Motorola sales
## C-IR ratifies conditional divestiture 
### LYNN MARCUS Staff writer 
In an unprecedented decision, the
Commission on Investment Respon
sibility (C-IR) voted unanimously
yesterday to recommend divestment
of Stanford's shares in Motorola Cor
poration if the company resumes
sales of equipment to the South
African police or military.
If implemented by the Stanford
Board of Trustees, the decision could
be "the most important step to a
more active divestment policy in the
last five years" and a "turning point
in the responsiveness of the Univer
sity to students' moral concerns," ac
cording to student commission mem
ber Mark Landesmann.
The recommendation is only a first
step toward a more encompassing
and active divestment policy, Landes
mann said, "but a very important first
step" and a "clear and unambiguous
signal that the University will no
longer tolerate Motorola's moral
bankruptcy."
According to C-IR Chairman
Richard Brody, "the commission has
never recommended divestment un
der any conditions" and is only
recommending it now contingent
upon Motorola's actions.
The issue of Motorola's policies in
South Africa came before the com
mission after a student referendum
calling for Stanford to sell its 94,000
shares of Motorola stock passed by a
vote of 81 to 19 percent in October.
The referendum, authored by ASSU
Senators Landesmann and Jon
Adelstein, also called for the
University to "establish criteria for
selective divestment."
Motorola has acknowledged
making two sales of electronic equip
ment to the South African police
since the Reagan Administration
lifted the ban on such sales.
According to Brody, a professor in
the Political Science Department, the
company stressed in its correspon
dence with C-IR following the student
vote that it made no sales to the
South African police or military in
1984 but was "vague as to its inten
tions after 1984."

Company officials declined an invi
tation to meet with C-IR. stating in a
letter to the commission that they had
already clarified Motorola's policies,
Brody said.
"I'm disappointed that they didn't
speak on their intentions for the
future," Brody said.
Given the ambiguity in Motorola's
responses, "1 think we did the re
sponsible thing," Brody said.
Adelstein hailed the commission's
decision as evidence "that when stu
dents act, the University is listening."
He also said it "represents real
progress after years of University in
transigence on investment behavior."
Although University regulations
require divestment of stock from
companies determined to be causing
substantial "social injury," specific
actions by companies which would
lead to divestment have never before
been established.
"This is a real step to defining ex
plicitly what social injury entails,"
said Adelstein, adding that "directly
supporting a military state and apar
theid through sales is now considered
injurious."
Landesmann said he believes the
decision will have a significant impact
on both institutional and private in
vestors and may thus affect the
practices of Motorola and other
American companies. "Part of the
idea was to send a signal to other uni
versities and other private investors
that such behavior is incompatible
with ethical and moral standards."
Brody said C-IR also plans to ad
dress the second issue of the student
referendum — the establishment of
specific criteria for selective divest
ment — after Landesmann prepares a
report for the commission.
The C-IR recommendation will be
submitted to the board of trustees'
Subcommittee on Investment Re
sponsibility once the commission
determines the exact wording.
Brody said that decisions in previ
ous years regarding policies toward
companies dealing with South Africa
have put the commission "on record
as believing in socially responsible in
vestment."
