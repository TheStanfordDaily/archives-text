# Future uncertain for French House
## 
### DOUG POST 
The Office of Residential Educa
tion has expressed concern over the
French House, a University residence
that has failed to fill in the first round
of the undergraduate housing draw
each of the past four years.
With only a few months left before
the 1985 Draw, the future of the
French House is up in the air. accord
ing to Rodger Whitney, associate
dean of Res Ed and director of the
Housing Center.
Although there have not been any
vacancies for women, the house has
had from 3 to 11 vacancies for men
during the past four years. The house
holds only 35 residents.
The house is currently under study
by the Committee on Services to
Students-Residences (COSS-R) to
determine whether the French House
program is strong enough to merit a
special house. A variety of options
are being studied, ranging from al
lowing the program to continue in
definitely to terminating the program
as early as next year and possibily
changing the theme of the residence.
"With housing for less than the
entire undergraduate population, we
have to ask ourselves if this is a
suitable use for a house. Whitney
said.
And while Res Ed is not sure what
the reason for the house's problem is,
the time has come for a close look.

Whitney said. "We're looking into
the activity of the house — we do not
want to be in the business of propping
up programs that are not doing well,"
he said. The study by COSS-R and
Res Ed could determine whether the
program needs a "little support" or
merits termination. Whitney said.
Claude Millman, resident assistant
at the French House, described the
reaction of the residents to the study
as "very surprised."
"There are a lot of people that
seem to be really interested in the
theme." he said, adding that there are
probably other factors at work in the
house's relative unpopularity in the
Draw. It is an old house, and its lack
of single rooms seem to discourage
some applicants, he said.
In addition, an RA some years r ago
was very active in the gay community,
leaving behind a reputation that
could have discouraged potential res
idents — particularly men — from
applying, Millman said. While that
reputation is no longer accurate, it
still seems to be a serious problem, he
said.
Millman said the cultural theme
seems to be alive and well, citing a
recent house program on Moliere.
Thursday night theme dinners,
French films and the house's most
ambitious project. La Creperie. a
