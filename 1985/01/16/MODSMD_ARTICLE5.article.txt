### SUSAN HARRINGTON 
Area residents who plan to leave town for Super
Bowl weekend are going to miss one heck of a
party.
Some 28 corporations have kicked in $2,000 to
$1,000 each for one-day leases on tent sites sur
rounding the Stanford Stadium on Super Bowl
Sunday, and the festivities scheduled are lavish.
The NFL Properties tent will boast murals and
props to simulate a football stadium, complete with
lockers and a miniature playing field, according to
Perrin Cunningham of Van Wyk Associates. The
company is handling nine pre- and post-game par
ties for six different companies.
Scattered over the NFL. Properties "playing
field" will be vignettes of key plays from champion
ship games, made up of flexible mannequins

wearing actual 49er and Dolphin uniforms.
Jugglers, mimes. 49ers cheerleaders and the
Stanford Band will all he part of the festivities.
Roving vendors will stroll the inside of the
24,000-square-foot tent, giving away gifts, hats,
popcorn and peanuts to the 1.400 people expected
to attend.

SUPERBOWL

But don't plan on slipping into the tent to watch
the festivities.
According to Stanford's Super Bowl assistant.
Heather Pfoutenhauer. guards hired by the corpo
rations will be stationed at every tent on campus.

"At Tampa Bay (the site of last year's Super
Bowl), they were just open site," Pfoutenhauer
said.
This year, she said, "each of the party sites are
hiring their own security guards to be standing at
each of the main doors."
The power will be imported, too. Each company
will have its own generators for the festivities.
Pfoutenhauer said.
The generators will power the likes of such bands
as Papa Doo Run Run and the Red Garter Band,
both at the Nissan Corporation's party, and Gladys
Knight will be featured at a party sponsored by the
Ford Motor Company.
"Nissan's bringing in a forest of trees," Pfouten
hauer said. "It's pretty amazing."

Pfoutenhauer estimates that the
corporate parties alone will bring
some 14,000 to 17,000 people to
Stanford on Sunday. ABC's guest list
runs to approximately 2,400. Ford
Motor Company expects 1,500 guests
and the NFL Properties bash will en
tertain some 1,400.
The home team has helped swell
the sizes, too. Most corporate parties
have grown by 50 to 100 people since
the 49ers got into the Super Bowl,
Pfoutenhauer said.
The smallest party is 50 people; the
average is 200.
Most of the revelers will arrive by
bus and will walk from the Oval to
their party sites. All but two or three
of the corporations will have both

pre- and post-game parties, according
to Pfoutenhauer.
Those without tickets will watch
the Super Bowl on wide screen TVs
set up in most of the tents. "I think
it's still exciting for those who don't
have tickets," Pfoutenhauer said.
