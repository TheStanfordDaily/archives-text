Belgium delays missile deployment
WASHINGTON — Belgium, opening a crack in NATO's support for
swift installation of medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe, has put
President Reagan on notice that it will not begin deploying missiles in
March as planned and could delay a decision on deployment until next
year.
Reagan met with Belgian Prime Minister Wilfried Martens at the
White House Monday, but failed to convince him to adhere to a March
deployment schedule. Instead, Martens' insistence that he needs more
time to make a decision appeared to undercut the public assertions of
U.S. officials that they remain "optimistic" about Belgium's acceptance
of the missiles.
U.S. officials yesterday attempted to put the best face on the situation
by contending that there had never been a firm decision to begin Belgian
deployment in March. They noted that Martens publicly had told
Reagan that Belgium remains committed to NATO's decision to deploy
the missiles by the end of 1987 unless the Soviets agree to reduce their
arsenal of SS-20 medium-range missiles.
In private, the U.S. officials conceded that, while they understand
Martens' need to buy time, it appears to show weakness within NATO at
a crucial time in East-West relations. The United States sought fast ac
tion by Belgium to show that America's NATO partners are united on
the so-called "Euromissile" question, thereby strengthening the U.S.
hand as it prepares for new arms-control negotiations with the Soviets.
At their Geneva meeting last week. Secretary of State George Shultz
and Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko agreed that medium
range missiles in Europe would be one of the three types of weapons
covered by the talks. That gave heightened significance to Reagan's dis
cussions with Martens because they marked the first post-Geneva test of
NATO's resolve to press ahead with deployment in Western Europe of
572 U.S.-made cruise and Pershing 2 missiles.
However, the best that Reagan could get was Martens' promise that
his government will decide its next move by the end of March. Belgian
officials said later that even if Martens does set a deployment timetable
then, it will require time-consuming scrutiny and debate in the Belgian
parliament. The officials added that there is a strong possibility Martens
will decide to postpone a decision until after the Belgian national elec
tions scheduled for December.
Brazil elects a new president
BRASILIA, Brazil — Tancredo de Almeida Neves, a moderate
reform candidate, was elected yesterday as president of Brazil, ending
21 years of authoritarian rule by military-dominated governments.
The Electoral College, meeting in the white-marble National
Congress building, gave Neves 480 votes to 180 for his opponent, Paulo
Maluf, the candidate of the regime's official Democratic Social Party.
The vote in the Electoral College was represented by the Neves forces
as the last stage in the restoration of full democracy in Brazil. On a huge
poster placed outside the Congress building by enthusiastic Neves back
ers were the words: "Good Morning. Democracy."
When the tally reached the 344 votes necessary to elect Neves,
fireworks exploded and church bells rang. In most of the major cities
across Brazil, crowds danced and sang the national anthem.
The election of Neves as Brazil's 38th president marks the return to
political dominance of the Brazilian middle class and labor parties that
were ousted when the military seized power in March 1964, overthrow
ing President Joao Goulart.
Arrest made in SF journalist case
TAIPEI, Taiwan — The Taiwan government yesterday announced
the arrest of a Defense Ministry intelligence officer for alleged involve
ment in the murder of Chinese-American journalist Henry Liu.
Government spokesman Chang King-yuh didn't identify the officer,
but said he would face "harsh punishment" if convicted in the murder of
Liu, a political writer for the Chinese-language San Francisco Journal.
Liu, 52, who had criticized Taiwain President Chiang Ching-kuo, was
gunned down Oct. 15 in the garage of his home in Daly City, south of
San Francisco.
Some, including the slain journalist's widow, Helena, have called his
killing a political assassination.
The Taiwanese government also announced yesterday the dismissal of
Lt. Gen. Wong Shi-lin, head of the Defense Ministry's intelligence de
partment. The government said Wong was not the officer who had been
arrested.
Liu was reported to have revised, shortly before his death, a muckrak
ing biography of President Chiang.
On Monday, the Defense Ministry reported that alleged underworld
leader Chen Chi-li, 39, arrested in an anti-crime sweep Nov. 13, had dis
closed information on the murder.
Chen, who allegedly masterminded the journalist's killing, is the
reputed leader of the Ju Lien Bong, or "Bamboo Gang," an interna
tional group that deals in extortion, prostitution and gambling.
Nation celebrates King's birthday
Americans black and white marched, prayed, sang — and some even
became victims of discrimination for a day — to mark the 56th birthday
yesterday of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.
In the Atlanta neighborhood where King was born, marchers formed
lines 10 abreast and two blocks long and sang songs from the civil rights
movement as they walked through downtown to a rally at the federal
building.
Similar marches were held in New Orleans, Savannah, Ga., St. Louis,
Mo., and Birmingham. Tuscaloosa and Tuskegee, Ala.
City, county and state government offices were closed in many parts of
the country in observance of King's birthday. The federal holiday in
honor of King, enacted by Congress last year, will be observed for the
first time in 1986.
Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste led a memorial service in downtown Co
lumbus while in Boston more than 2,000 people turned out for the 15th
annual memorial breakfast in honor of the slain black leader.
In Chicago, the scene of King's first northern civil rights campaign in
1966, Mayor Harold Washington, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, entertainers
Stevie Wonder and Pete Seeger and King's youngest son. Dexter King,
led a day-long celebration.
One of the more original observances was in Atlanta, where 75 stu
dents at predominantly white Sandy Springs Middle School agreed to
become victims of discrimination for a day.
Six die in Air Force copter crash
HONOLULU — A U.S. Air Force helicopter sent to evacuate a sick
seaman from a merchant ship crashed on the vessel yesterday, killing six
crewmen and leaving a seventh missing and presumed dead, authorities
said.
