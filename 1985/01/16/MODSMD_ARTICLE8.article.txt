## Court says student searches OK 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” The Supreme Court, citing
the growing problem of disorder in the public
schools, gave teachers and administrators wide
power yesterday to search students they suspect of
committing crimes or violating school rules.
I he justices held unanimously that students were
entitled to some protection under the Fourth
Amendment. But by a vote of 6 to 3. they said that,
unlike police, school authorities do not need a war
rant or "probable cause" to believe a crime has oc
curred before conducting searches of students and
their belongings.
Ordinarily, a search will be justified when there
are "reasonable grounds" for suspecting it will dis
close evidence that a student broke the law or the
school rules, the majority on the court said.
Searches must be "reasonably related" to their ob
jectives and "not excessively intrusive" in view of
the age and sex of the student and nature of the in
fraction. it said.
But the court, trying to strike a balance between
competing interests, said that the right to privacy
must be limited by the need to ensure school dis
cipline. Justice Byron White, writing the majority
opinion for the court, observed:
"Maintaining order in the classroom has never
been easy, but in recent years, school disorder has
often taken particularly ugly forms: Drug use and
violent crime in the schools have become major so
cial problems."
But the court's dissenters warned that the deci
sion represented a "dangerous weakening" of the

right to privacy and could lead to searches, not just
for drugs or weapons, but also for "trivial" rule in
fractions.
"For the court, a search for curlers and sun
glasses in order to enforce the school dress code is
apparently just as important as a search for
evidence of heroin addiction or violent gang activ
ity. Justice John Paul Stevens wrote in dissent.
"... The court's decision today is a curious moral
for the nation's youth."
I he case before the court was one of the most
widely awaited on the justices' docket for the cur
rent term.
In "friend ot the court" briefs, education groups
urged the justices to give teachers and administra
tors sufficient leeway to curb violence and drugs.
Civil liberties organizations warned against lax
standards that would open the way for abusive
searches. The Reagan administration, citing the
"growing lack of discipline" in the schools, asked
that teachers, acting much like parents, be given
more discretion to search than are police.
The case involved a 14-year-old female student,
identified only as T.L.0.. whom a teacher saw
holding a lighted cigarette in a restroom at Pis
cataway, N.J.. High School in 1980.
The teacher reported the incident to a school
vice principal. When he questioned the girl, she
denied she ever smoked. But the administrator
took her into his office, opened her purse and
found not only cigarettes but also rolling papers of
the kind used for marijuana. Looking further, he

found marijuana, a pipe, several plastic bags, $40
in one-dollar bills and a list of names indicating she
had been selling the drug to her fellow students.
The vice principal then notified the girl's mother
and police, and in questioning at police
headquarters the girl admitted selling marijuana at
school. She was tried, found guilty, adjudged a
delinquent and placed on probation for one year.
Later, the Supreme Court of New Jersey upheld
contentions by T.L.O.'s lawyers that the evidence
should be suppressed because the vice principal
lacked reasonable grounds to search the girl's
purse.
But yesterday the Supreme Court reversed the
state court, finding that the administrator's actions
were reasonable under the circumstances (New
Jersey vs. T.L.0.. 83-712). White's majority
opinion was joined by Chief Justice Warren Burger
and Justices Lewis Powell Jr., William Rehnquist
and Sandra Day O'Connor. Justice Harry Black
mun concurred separately.
The ruling was consistent with past court deci
sions extending some constitutional protections to
students but stopping short of wholesale applica
tion of the same rights adults enjoy. For example,
the justices have held that while students facing
suspension are entitled to notice and a hearing,
they do not have the right to a lawyer or to present
witnesses at such proceedings.
