## Fed offers lower interest rates 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” Federal
Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker,
holding out the carrot of lower inter
est rates if Congress accepts the stick
of drastic spending cuts, predicted
yesterday that interest rates would be
"lower than they would otherwise
be" if the federal deficit is cut by
about $50 billion next year from the
current $225 billion.
Volcker, emerging from a break
fast meeting with a small group of
Republican senators, gave the im
pression that the Federal Reserve
would help push interest rates down if
a major deficit reduction package is
approved. Thus, he provided some
reassurance to skittish legislators that
the Fed would compensate for the
depressing economic effects of huge
spending cutbacks by easing its mon
etary policy.
"The more you do in reducing the
deficit, the lower interest rates are
going to be," Volcker said he told the
Republican leaders. "As I've said

before, a $50 billion cut this year is
the first step."
Volcker's comments are likely to
assist the crusade by Senate
Republicans to slash the deficit by
about $50 billion without a tax in
crease, primarily by imposing an
across-the-board freeze on federal
spending, including Social Security
and the Pentagon. Some domestic
programs also would be eliminated or
cut deeply under the Senate GOP
outline.
In talking to reporters after the
meeting, Volcker declared he "can't
help but feel encouraged" by the ef
fort being organized by Senate
Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-
Kan.). Moreover, he gave his general
support for the GOP senators' three
year goal of cutting deficits to less
than $100 billion, saying that "if
you're going to have a convincing
program . . . some follow-through" is
needed.
Senate GOP leaders have been on

the defensive recently because of
divisions within their own ranks over
limiting defense spending increases,
as well as objections by both
Republicans and Democrats in the
House to freezing cost-of-living hikes
for Social Security recipients. They
are hoping to complete their budget
plan by Feb. 1.
By contrast. President Reagan is
expected to deliver a budget to
Congress on Feb. 4 that would lower
the deficit to about $ 1 70 billion in fis
cal 1986, mainly by making deep cuts
in domestic programs. But the admin
istration's budget is likely to fall as
much as $50 billion short of Reagan's
original goal of reducing the deficit to
$100 billion by 1988.
Volcker's meeting with the Senate
GOP leaders was the first of three
sessions that Dole arranged to help
push his deficit-reduction ideas.
Senate Majority Whip Alan
Simpson of Wyoming, who attended
the meeting, warned that senators

would not he deterred from making
changes in Reagan's budget. "It's
going to be COLAs (Social Security
cost-of-living adjustments), it's going
to be defense, and you can't mess
around," Simpson said. "You're in it,
and you're going to get wet all over."
After the Senate Republicans met
with members of the Business
Roundtable. an organization of top
business executives. Prudential Insur
ance Co. Chairman Robert Beck
echoed Volcker's remarks by calling
for cuts in the deficit over the next
three years.
"We've got to demonstrate we are
taking steps in '86, '87 and '88,"
Beck said. "It would be a shot in the
arm that would provide for continued
growth."
But Senate Finance Committee
Chairman Bob Packwood (R-Ore.)
warned that deficit reduction could
drag on for months.
