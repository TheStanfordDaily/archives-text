# Right-to-sun lawsuit fails

Stanford Psychiatry Profs. Herbert and Gloria Leider
man will not have to trim their trees to provide "solar
access" for their campus neighbors, according to a deci
sion by the Santa Clara County Superior Court.
The suit was brought against the Leidermans by Engi
neering Prof. Rudolph Sher and his wife, Bonnie. They
claim trees in the Leiderman's backyard cast a permanent
shadow over the Sher's 740 Mayfield Ave. home each
winter and are a "public nuisance." The dispute was
brought to court last September after 10 years of out-of
court negotiation.
But in a ruling issued Friday, Judge Taketsugu Takei
declared there is no right of solar access in California.
"Although the court finds that the complaints of the
Shers are very real both in the aspect of emotional distress
and the reduction of potential property value, the injuries
. . . are not ones that are afforded protection or
recognized as a legally enforceable right in a court of
law," Takei wrote in a seven-page opinion.
One of the issues on trial was whether the Shers were
entitled to the benefits of the Solar Shade Control Act of
1978, which protects solar energy collectors from neigh
boring shade. According to Takei, the Sher home is a
"passive solar" design because it does not involve collec
tors.
According to Mark Solomon, the Leidermans' attorney,
the Shers sought an easement for unrestricted access to
sun for which people in California have the right by law to
purchase. Solomon said that such cases in California are a
matter of private contract between individuals and are
generally solved in a bargain context among the individuals
involved, and not by a court-imposed order.
"Evidence was even if they had unrestricted access all
winter long, it would have resulted in a $30 to $50 savings
in heating costs all winter season. In order to get that min
imal savings, it would require the destruction of six fully
grown trees," Solomon said. The trees include a redwood,
eucalyptus, acacias, Canary Island pine, and Monterey
pine.
"If the Leidermans had planted all the trees that the
University encouraged them to plant at the time, there
would have been practically a forest at the time the houses
were built," Soloman said. He would not say what, if any,
position the University took in the case.
Bonnie Sher said the court decision was "terrible" and
"devastating."
"We really feel just as loud noises and objectional
odors are disturbing intrusions, so, for us, is the darkness
and cold caused by a neighbor's shade falling on our prop
erty," she said.
The Shers may appeal the case in a higher court. Bonnie
Sher said she thought the law should be changed to in
clude a right to solar access.
"The rules that prevent remedies for a loss of sunlight
make no sense to us for this day and age," Sher said.
"They're so many people out there who've had the same
troubles."
Herbert Leiderman said he was pleased the case is over.
"I've spent a lot of time and money to get the trees cut to
their pleasure and nothing really satisfies them," he said.
Leiderman said he has spent $4,300 on tree-cutting to
please the Shers.
"They just don't seem to like trees. They tried to have
the other neighbors shave their trees also," he said.
The Shers have 60 days to decide whether to appeal.
