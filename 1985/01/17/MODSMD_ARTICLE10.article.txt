## African agriculture experiences 'crisis' 
### DOUG GROVE 
"When starvation and famine oc
cur it is rarely because there is not
enough food," Prof. Henry Bernstein
of the United Kingdom's Open Uni
versity said here yesterday.
In a discussion on "stagnation and
decline in agriculture in sub-Saharan
Africa" at the Bechtel International
Center, Bernstein said the current
agrarian crisis in parts of Africa
should be viewed as a long
term ideological context, not just lim
ited to short-term economic analysis.
Food shortages generally can be at
tributed to problems in distribution,
according to Bernstein. Those prob
lems often originate in the ruling elite
of a country, which can invoke both
left- and right-wing ideology to jus
tify its actions.
"Left-wing writing in the 1960s
and 1970s about peasants was a
populous ideology which culminated
into two positions: first, that small
scale production is economically effi
cient and, secondly, that moral, com
munal virtues are embodied in the
population and the moral heroes and
heroines are within that same popula
tion," Bernstein said.
In this way, left-wing writers are
able to maintain that peasants are an
exploited class with revolutionary po
tential, Bernstein said. This view can
then be used to justify social agitation
against the elite. It also implicitly af
firms the need for the elite to main
tain power in order to survive.
Bernstein said he finds weaknesses
in arguments such as: "Are the
peasants actually a class?"
and, "What does one mean by a
'common class" when referring to
peasants?" This group of people,
Bernstein pointed out, is differenti
ated and constantly changing, to the
dismay of leftists.
"In my view, it is quite wrong to
see the peasants as homogeneous and
revolutionary," he said. The question
to ask, according to Bernstein, is that

it the peasants can be considered a
class by themselves, then "who is the
class enemy?"
One interpretation is that
held by the World Bank and
" Reaganites," Bernstein said. It is the
state that "has blocked the intrinsic
rationale of the market mechanism''
and it is the state that is exploiting the
peasants, he said. Exploitation by
the state is accomplished in a number
of ways, two of which are "surface ex
traction," which includes taxes and
rents on agricultural equipment, and
"repression of political and ideologi
cal expression."
What is happening in Africa has
"wider implications than just being a
crisis in Africa," Bernstein said.
Africa is an example of a state that
cannot feed its people and thus
struggles with legitimacy. What needs
to be found is "feasible socialism."
"The peasants must be given con
trol of their own existance (economic
and political) as people with ideas. . . .
They need to be given incentives in
stead of being ripped off," Bernstein
said.
"Why is Africa seen as having a
crisis now?" Bernstein asked, when
the problem can be traced back to the
colonial period. Answering himself,
he said the "integration with the
world economy . . . and problems of
political stability with food
shortages" have brought an old prob
lem to the attention of the Western
press. "Western news agencies . . .
make this into a (current) crisis."
In sum, Bernstein stressed that any
anaylsis, no matter what is taken into
account, has its limitations.
"In a situation where there is
ideological and political change . . .
no simple descriptive statements can
be made." In any case, the exploita
tion by the state of the peasants is
"not exploitation of class versus class
. . . just a struggle between two differ
ent capitalist enterprises . . . the state
versus the individual."
