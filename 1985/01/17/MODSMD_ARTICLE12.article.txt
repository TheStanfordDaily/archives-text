## The 						Stanford Daily Quality resignation 
### 
The ASSU was jolted last night by three
resignations: resignations which could spell
major trouble for Stanford's student government.
Like most student groups, the ASSU must oc
casionally feel the effect of students who choose
to put more time into academics than extracurric
ular activities. But when these events happen in
as vital and visible an organization as the ASSU,
they are more important than usual.
Senator George Ramos leaves the senate be
cause he is stopping out of school. But Council of
Presidents member Alice Wells and Senator Bob
Slater say they are dropping out because of time
constraints.
Slater's explanation was typical: "I recal
culated my time schedule . . . and there's just not
enough time to give it (the ASSU) the effort it
deserves."
These two were not just a couple more people
hanging out at the ASSU so they could put stu
dent government on their resumes.
Rather, Slater was among the hardest working
ASSU senators. He was the driving force behind
plans to institute a Stanford-to-San Francisco
shuttle service. He put in long hours last year for
mulating his idea and managed to sell it to the

senate. When the project ran out of time as last
year's senate drew to a close, he ran for the sen
ate again. This fall the senate set up a special
committee to deal with the shuttle proposal —
with Slater in charge. He leaves the shuttle proj
ect only as it nears completion.
Wells has been involved with the ASSU since
her freshman year, when she was a senate associ
ate. Her sophomore and junior years saw her ex
tensively involved with the Program Board and
the Nominations Commission. t This year, as one
of the four heads of the ASSU, she worked hard.
She was an articulate and intelligent spokesman
for the COP and, with David Porter, was the
most active president during debate in the senate
chamber.
But even these seemingly committed students
succumbed to the time pressures inherent in the
life of every student at Stanford.
Many student groups here have trouble win
ning a commitment from their members. Finding
Stanford students willing to devote themselves to
a cause which will detract from their study and
leisure time is a difficult task. As last night's
resignations show, getting them to stay is just as
difficult.
And that's a shame.
