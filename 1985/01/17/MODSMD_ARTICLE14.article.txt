Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery
None but ourselves can free our minds.
— Bob Marley
In the middle of the journey of our life,
I came to myself in a dark wood where
the straight way was lost.
— Dante, "The Inferno"
Hey! Guess what? I got my grades from last
quarter! Would you believe it? I'm not quite
sure what this here means, though . . . what
are these initials?
Initials?
Yeah, initials. Look, what does this say?
That says "N.C."
Right. Like I said, initials. What do they
stand for? "No Comparison"? "Nervous
Crustacean"? "Nasty Cabbage"? "Novice
Cerebrant"? Or — more likely — "Needs
Care"?
They stand for "No Credit."
Oh. You mean, like. Not even Close?
I mean, like, you blew it.
Oh.

It began with an idea. What happens, I
thought, if all these papers I write are
meaningless?
Suppose that not only are my papers utterly
useless, but that all the material I'm writing
about, books, literature, philosophy, all that,
is diverting me from whatever is truly good in
life?
My addled mind raced on. Suppose that,
contrary to their name, "the humanities"
don't really foster an interest in humankind at
all, but instead actually consume what could
be useful mental energy? Why am I reading

St. Augustine, for example, or Rousseau or
Dante, and spending a lot of time thinking
about them, when my prodigious mind could
be solving the real, material problems facing
people all over the world? Seems kind of
crass, even immoral to be discussing the dif
ference between a "sign" and a "signifier"
when there are people shriveling up with
hunger and dying in the wastes of some
African desert, when people must live in
poverty in their own country, which harbors
such inconceivable wealth that it can afford to
let millions of tons of produce spoil, just to
keep prices up. I mean, isn't there something
wrong about me doing absolutely nothing to
stop such unfairness in the world?
Now I realize the answer to this proposition
may seem obvious to you, by whatever
thought process you're used to going
through. The answer may be for you an un
equivocal "Yes, it is wrong!" and seem self
evident; or this may seem like no problem at
all — in fact, it might seem hopelessly naive
and ridiculous. All I can respond to either
point of view is, I don't entirely believe it
myself; but it was a line of reasoning I used on
myself, in a particularly destructive way.
I used it as "an abstract notion," the label
so many give to what copld be a genuine
moral foundation. It was a notion that
crippled me, had me drawing cartoons of
frustration in my humanities notebook, fig
ures bordering on the pathological.
The disenchantment I felt with my aca
demic direction reflected how I felt about my
life in general. I began to feel the urge to fol
low a "moral" courseload, one which would
enable me to help other people in a very tan
gible, immediate way.
I have a very gifted friend who has wrestled
with this problem; he has set his mind on a

pre-med approach to this end. Stimulated by
his example and the books he was reading, I
dropped humanities, and switched to the core
program in human biology.
The results, of course, were disastrous. I
followed the lectures, and even completed
some of the readings. But I just couldn't con
centrate enough; I couldn't give myself to it. I
sauntered on into the midterm, put down
what seemed appropriate, and sauntered out.

nally laid the fiasco of fall quarter to rest. Still,
I felt like an abysmal failure.
Now, though, I'm glad it happened. So
what if I'm on probation? I can't reasonably
take hum bio again. I'm left with a pressing
urge to take what best suits me, to turn
around and make my direction clearer. I'm
left with questions that I can actually deal
with, a situation that in itself gives me a cer
tain peace of mind.

It was a notion that crippled me, had me
drawing cartoons of frustration in my
humanities notebook, figures bordering on the
pathological.

My paper was a laughable affair written in the
five hours before the deadline of a two-day
extension. And the final? Well, I proved 1 was
definitely in the wrong orbit on that one; I
studied more than I had all quarter, then se
cured my place on the bottom of the bell by
scoring the worst on any major test I've ever
taken, anywhere. Period. Down went my
career in human biology, in flames.
But the debacle wasn't over yet. My
registration was held up because I was liable
for money I owed to the Music Department
for a course I'd attended for only two weeks. I
dropped it in favor of the time I thought I'd
spend studying; unfortunately, I forgot to tell
Old Union that. A very expensive (and
ironic) mistake, but with that last check, I fi-

Why did I let the idea ply me so? Granted, I
should take ideas seriously, but must I let
them completely paralyze me? How can an
abstraction be so powerful?
I believe that it was I, not the idea, that
wrought the damage. For a combination of
personal reasons, I was morose, and very vul
nerable. I think that the disturbing idea that
humanities, and even education itself, were
useless, was a direction that I stumbled onto
by virtue of an already addled mind. I know I
brought unaddressed frustration into the new
school year and was particularly sensitive to
any ideas that would unsettle me. My mind
tried to find answers, but was instead finding
only notions that damaged it and hurt it; I
know it could seek no comfort in ideas at that

time, and so it found none.
Because my learning ability was short
circuited, because 1 had, for all intents and
purposes, splintered my intelligence, 1 have
found a renewed faith in understanding. It's
not just The Humanities or The Sciences
that offer understanding. You can understand
certain forces that drive human beings just by
watching, say, a football game. We can learn
from every experience that we have, and give
ourselves a handle on the world around us.
Understanding, I suppose, is itself a vague
concept that I can't really define for anyone
but myself. For me, it is through learning and
piecing together little bits of knowledge and
experience that I find the ability to overcome
paralysis and act on what I have come to feel
is essential. Understanding doesn't guarantee
action, of course, but I for one, am incapable
of genuine, constructive action without it.
As for me, I will be quite content (well,
more content than I am now) just to get past
the paralysis. I'll cross the bridge of con
structive action when I come to it, although to
maintain peace of mind I have to promise
myself that I will someday seek out ways to
find that bridge. I will pursue my interests as
far as I can. 1 will carry through on my ideas as
cheerfully and tenaciously as possible. And
then, hopefully, I will redeem myself, finding
my way to whatever freedom it is that sleeps
so fitfully in my heart.
Won't you help to sing
These songs of freedom
Cause all I ever had.

when there are people shriveling up with
hunger and dying in the wastes of some
African desert, when people must live in
poverty in their own country, which harbors
such inconceivable wealth that it can afford to
let millions of tons of produce spoil, just to
keep prices up. I mean, isn't there something
wrong about me doing absolutely nothing to
stop such unfairness in the world?
Now I realize the answer to this proposition
may seem obvious to you, by whatever
thought process you're used to going
through. The answer may be for you an un
equivocal "Yes, it is wrong!" and seem self
evident; or this may seem like no problem at
all — in fact, it might seem hopelessly naive
and ridiculous. All I can respond to either
point of view is, I don't entirely believe it
myself; but it was a line of reasoning I used on
myself, in a particularly destructive way.
I used it as "an abstract notion," the label
so many give to what copld be a genuine
moral foundation. It was a notion that
crippled me, had me drawing cartoons of
frustration in my humanities notebook, fig
ures bordering on the pathological.
The disenchantment I felt with my aca
demic direction reflected how I felt about my
life in general. I began to feel the urge to fol
low a "moral" courseload, one which would
enable me to help other people in a very tan
gible, immediate way.
I have a very gifted friend who has wrestled
with this problem; he has set his mind on a

pre-med approach to this end. Stimulated by
his example and the books he was reading, I
dropped humanities, and switched to the core
program in human biology.
The results, of course, were disastrous. I
followed the lectures, and even completed
some of the readings. But I just couldn't con
centrate enough; I couldn't give myself to it. I
sauntered on into the midterm, put down
what seemed appropriate, and sauntered out.

nally laid the fiasco of fall quarter to rest. Still,
I felt like an abysmal failure.
Now, though, I'm glad it happened. So
what if I'm on probation? I can't reasonably
take hum bio again. I'm left with a pressing
urge to take what best suits me, to turn
around and make my direction clearer. I'm
left with questions that I can actually deal
with, a situation that in itself gives me a cer
tain peace of mind.

It was a notion that crippled me, had me
drawing cartoons of frustration in my
humanities notebook, figures bordering on the
pathological.

My paper was a laughable affair written in the
five hours before the deadline of a two-day
extension. And the final? Well, I proved 1 was
definitely in the wrong orbit on that one; I
studied more than I had all quarter, then se
cured my place on the bottom of the bell by
scoring the worst on any major test I've ever
taken, anywhere. Period. Down went my
career in human biology, in flames.
But the debacle wasn't over yet. My
registration was held up because I was liable
for money I owed to the Music Department
for a course I'd attended for only two weeks. I
dropped it in favor of the time I thought I'd
spend studying; unfortunately, I forgot to tell
Old Union that. A very expensive (and
ironic) mistake, but with that last check, I fi-

Why did I let the idea ply me so? Granted, I
should take ideas seriously, but must I let
them completely paralyze me? How can an
abstraction be so powerful?
I believe that it was I, not the idea, that
wrought the damage. For a combination of
personal reasons, I was morose, and very vul
nerable. I think that the disturbing idea that
humanities, and even education itself, were
useless, was a direction that I stumbled onto
by virtue of an already addled mind. I know I
brought unaddressed frustration into the new
school year and was particularly sensitive to
any ideas that would unsettle me. My mind
tried to find answers, but was instead finding
only notions that damaged it and hurt it; I
know it could seek no comfort in ideas at that

time, and so it found none.
Because my learning ability was short
circuited, because 1 had, for all intents and
purposes, splintered my intelligence, 1 have
found a renewed faith in understanding. It's
not just The Humanities or The Sciences
that offer understanding. You can understand
certain forces that drive human beings just by
watching, say, a football game. We can learn
from every experience that we have, and give
ourselves a handle on the world around us.
Understanding, I suppose, is itself a vague
concept that I can't really define for anyone
but myself. For me, it is through learning and
piecing together little bits of knowledge and
experience that I find the ability to overcome
paralysis and act on what I have come to feel
is essential. Understanding doesn't guarantee
action, of course, but I for one, am incapable
of genuine, constructive action without it.
As for me, I will be quite content (well,
more content than I am now) just to get past
the paralysis. I'll cross the bridge of con
structive action when I come to it, although to
maintain peace of mind I have to promise
myself that I will someday seek out ways to
find that bridge. I will pursue my interests as
far as I can. 1 will carry through on my ideas as
cheerfully and tenaciously as possible. And
then, hopefully, I will redeem myself, finding
my way to whatever freedom it is that sleeps
so fitfully in my heart.

Hey! Guess what? I got my grades from last

are these initials?
Initials?
Yeah, initials. Look, what does this say?
That says "N.C."
Right. Like I said, initials. What do they
stand for? "No Comparison"? "Nervous
Crustacean"? "Nasty Cabbage"? "Novice
Cerebrant"? Or — more likely — "Needs
Care"?
They stand for "No Credit."
Oh. You mean, like. Not even Close?
I mean, like, you blew it.

It began with an idea. What happens, I
thought, if all these papers I write are
meaningless?
Suppose that not only are my papers utterly
useless, but that all the material I'm writing
about, books, literature, philosophy, all that,
is diverting me from whatever is truly good in
life?
My addled mind raced on. Suppose that,
contrary to their name, "the humanities"
don't really foster an interest in humankind at
all, but instead actually consume what could
be useful mental energy? Why am I reading

St. Augustine, for example, or Rousseau or
Dante, and spending a lot of time thinking
about them, when my prodigious mind could
be solving the real, material problems facing
people all over the world? Seems kind of
