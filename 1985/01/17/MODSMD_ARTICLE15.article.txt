Good men and rape
I do not wish to take issue with
Noel Hanrahan (The Daily, Jan. 14)
on the wrongness of rape, flashing or
pornography, but to extend the
blame for the acts to the population
in general. While 1 will never
pretend to be able to understand the
fear and anger a woman might feel, I
do not believe that the cause of those
feelings can or should be associated
only with the male population. Her
message about rape and attitudes
toward rape was unfortunately hid
den from many people by her attack
upon men.
Rape is a gender-specific crime.
Murder is specific only to the human
race. If I say that I do not draw the
distinction between good people and
murderers, I am extrapolating the
blame for the deaths of thousands of
men and women to the whole popu
lation. However, there is no way that
society can identify a John Hinckley
or a Dan White and stop him before
he kills. In the same way there is no
way that men as a group could stop a
potential rapist. The blame for an act
cannot be placed on a group simply
because one of its members commit
ted it. The desire to kill is no more
explainable in a society that should
know better than is the desire to
rape. Both were, at one point, rooted
in the characters of all members of
society and the fact that they appear
and are acted upon some of those
members is a problem for the whole
society to consider.
Inaction, as Hanrahan suggests, is
just as bad as approval. It is each
person's responsibility to try to
create an atmosphere in which the
attitudes which might foster the
emergence of rape, murder and
other violent instincts in a person
cannot flourish. This is not to suggest
that everyone should go out and do
volunteer work for the police depart
ment. On the contrary, that would
not even be the kind of help that is
most desperately needed. The prob
lem is in people's attitudes. When

someone tries to make a casual joke
about rape (or any violent crime)
you should stop and think about all
the fear and pain and anger involved
in the actual act. Is that really some
thing you condone? Is it something
you can let go unmentioned? Could
you still make jokes about it if it
happened to someone you loved? A
girlfriend? A sister? A mother?
Perhaps some of Hanrahan's
words will make a bit more sense in
a different context.
"Give us unrestricted freedom to
breathe, live and walk upon this earth
unharrowed by your collective ter
rorism and without constant
reminders of the price far too many
of us have paid for your . . . power."

I'm glad that I don't live in the
narrow world of Noel Hanrahan. If
so, I too would miss out on what the
male half of the human race has to
offer.
One might argue that the reason I
don't share Hanrahan's world view is
that my experiences are different
from hers. I know no rapists. Yet this
does not cause me to generalize, as
she does when she says that she does
"not draw distinctions between good
men and rapists." Even though I
don't know any, I know that rapists
exist. But I also know many good
men who have no intention of ever
raping or abusing a woman.
It's not surprising that someone
who thinks that all males are evil
fails to see that all females aren't
always good. Hanrahan must never
have seen the woman I know who
used to lift her dress and flash
anywhere from the dorm to White
Plaza. She must not have gone to
many large parties recently if she
doesn't see that half of the litter on
the lawns after them is left by
women. And she would probably be
shocked to hear that the two rudest
acts of destruction in our dorm this
year were committed by females in a

drunken stupor.
In all of these cases, I call on the
people who commit such acts to take
responsibility. This applies equally to
rape as to damaging a dorm. I don't
blame innocent men for rapes they
have nothing to do with and I don't
expect them to blame me for some
thing another female has done.
Some of the kindest and gentlest
people I know are male. Hanrahan
knows some of these same men. For
her to accuse them of being power
hungry when they kindly offer to
walk us home at night is to deny
them the dignity that they deserve as
much as we do.
Hiding in bed with her lover will
never solve Hanrahan's problem.
What she really needs is to accept
men who sincerely want the best for
her.

First of all, it should be said that
Noel Hanrahan's viewpoint ad
dressed some valid points. The limits
that the fear of rape puts on a
woman's freedom are unjust. I agree.
The fact that one out of four women
will be raped in her lifetime is tragic
and criminal. Once again, I agree.
Complacency and a "boys will be
boys" attitude toward rape and
sexual harassment are as wrong as
the acts themselves. This is clear.
However, I feel that the remainder
of the assertions and implications are
untrue and unfair to both men and
women.
The statement "All men per
petuate the conditions of women's
oppression through their passive and
active complicity" is a gross and
misleading generalization. There are
men who are active feminists, just as
there are women who are rabid
anti-feminists.
The piece goes on to discuss "...
men's bigotry, men's drunkenness
and men's routine pre-adolescent
behavior." So much of my experi
ence shows that open-mindedness,
sobriety and maturity have no rela-

tion to a person's sex.
The suggestion that women are
singled out financially, to pay for the
theft and vandalism that all men
(and only men) commit is also false.
Students of both sexes are billed for
the childish antics of a relatively
small part of the student body.
By not drawing a distinction be
tween good men and rapists, Han
rahan is as narrow-minded and as
sexist as any frat boy ever could be.
The gross misrepresentation of all
men as cruel, callous and boorish not
only would attempt to deny the
existence of heterosexual feminists,
but also acts as a liability to the
entire feminist movement by creating
even more animosity among men.
One harsh reality that we must
deal with is that if we are at least to
continue as a species, men and
women cannot exist independently of
one another. If we accept this as
true, then the goal of the feminist
movement should be toward equal
coexistence. Hanrahan would seem
to prefer secession.
Historically, movements seeking
social change have been hindered
rather than helped by their radical
elements. Speaking of harsh realities,
for such a movement to succeed, it
must find a certain degree of accep
tance in the mind of the average
citizen.
In this sense, the viewpoint did
much more harm than good. The net
effect of an article such as the one
printed Monday is to cause a great
many people (of both sexes), who
would otherwise support the feminist
movement, to dismiss it as just an
other group of extremists. Hanrahan
is not a feminist so much as she is
simply a misanthrope. She is at
tempting to use the feminist move
ment to give her personal prejudices
more weight than they warrant and
more credibility than they would
otherwise ever have. It is by doing
this that she has done all of us, men
and women, an injustice.

or a Dan White and stop him before
he kills. In the same way there is no
way that men as a group could stop a
potential rapist. The blame for an act
cannot be placed on a group simply
because one of its members commit
ted it. The desire to kill is no more
explainable in a society that should
know better than is the desire to
rape. Both were, at one point, rooted
in the characters of all members of
society and the fact that they appear
and are acted upon some of those
members is a problem for the whole
society to consider.
Inaction, as Hanrahan suggests, is
just as bad as approval. It is each
person's responsibility to try to
create an atmosphere in which the
attitudes which might foster the
emergence of rape, murder and
other violent instincts in a person
cannot flourish. This is not to suggest
that everyone should go out and do
volunteer work for the police depart
ment. On the contrary, that would
not even be the kind of help that is
most desperately needed. The prob
lem is in people's attitudes. When

someone tries to make a casual joke
about rape (or any violent crime)
you should stop and think about all
the fear and pain and anger involved
in the actual act. Is that really some
thing you condone? Is it something
you can let go unmentioned? Could
you still make jokes about it if it
happened to someone you loved? A
girlfriend? A sister? A mother?
Perhaps some of Hanrahan's
words will make a bit more sense in
a different context.

I'm glad that I don't live in the
narrow world of Noel Hanrahan. If
so, I too would miss out on what the
male half of the human race has to
offer.
One might argue that the reason I
don't share Hanrahan's world view is
that my experiences are different
from hers. I know no rapists. Yet this
does not cause me to generalize, as
she does when she says that she does
"not draw distinctions between good
men and rapists." Even though I
don't know any, I know that rapists
exist. But I also know many good
men who have no intention of ever
raping or abusing a woman.
It's not surprising that someone
who thinks that all males are evil
fails to see that all females aren't
always good. Hanrahan must never
have seen the woman I know who
used to lift her dress and flash
anywhere from the dorm to White
Plaza. She must not have gone to
many large parties recently if she
doesn't see that half of the litter on
the lawns after them is left by
women. And she would probably be
shocked to hear that the two rudest
acts of destruction in our dorm this
year were committed by females in a

drunken stupor.
In all of these cases, I call on the
people who commit such acts to take
responsibility. This applies equally to
rape as to damaging a dorm. I don't
blame innocent men for rapes they
have nothing to do with and I don't
expect them to blame me for some
thing another female has done.
Some of the kindest and gentlest
people I know are male. Hanrahan
knows some of these same men. For
her to accuse them of being power
hungry when they kindly offer to
walk us home at night is to deny
them the dignity that they deserve as
much as we do.
Hiding in bed with her lover will
never solve Hanrahan's problem.
What she really needs is to accept
men who sincerely want the best for
her.

First of all, it should be said that
Noel Hanrahan's viewpoint ad
dressed some valid points. The limits
that the fear of rape puts on a
woman's freedom are unjust. I agree.
The fact that one out of four women
will be raped in her lifetime is tragic
and criminal. Once again, I agree.
Complacency and a "boys will be
boys" attitude toward rape and
sexual harassment are as wrong as
the acts themselves. This is clear.
However, I feel that the remainder
of the assertions and implications are
untrue and unfair to both men and
women.
The statement "All men per
petuate the conditions of women's
oppression through their passive and
active complicity" is a gross and
misleading generalization. There are
men who are active feminists, just as
there are women who are rabid
anti-feminists.
The piece goes on to discuss "...
men's bigotry, men's drunkenness
and men's routine pre-adolescent
behavior." So much of my experi
ence shows that open-mindedness,
sobriety and maturity have no rela-

tion to a person's sex.
The suggestion that women are
singled out financially, to pay for the
theft and vandalism that all men
(and only men) commit is also false.
Students of both sexes are billed for
the childish antics of a relatively
small part of the student body.
By not drawing a distinction be
tween good men and rapists, Han
rahan is as narrow-minded and as
sexist as any frat boy ever could be.
The gross misrepresentation of all
men as cruel, callous and boorish not
only would attempt to deny the
existence of heterosexual feminists,
but also acts as a liability to the
entire feminist movement by creating
even more animosity among men.
One harsh reality that we must
deal with is that if we are at least to
continue as a species, men and
women cannot exist independently of
one another. If we accept this as
true, then the goal of the feminist
movement should be toward equal
coexistence. Hanrahan would seem
to prefer secession.
Historically, movements seeking
social change have been hindered
rather than helped by their radical
elements. Speaking of harsh realities,
for such a movement to succeed, it
must find a certain degree of accep
tance in the mind of the average
citizen.
In this sense, the viewpoint did
much more harm than good. The net
effect of an article such as the one
printed Monday is to cause a great
many people (of both sexes), who
would otherwise support the feminist
movement, to dismiss it as just an
other group of extremists. Hanrahan
is not a feminist so much as she is
simply a misanthrope. She is at
tempting to use the feminist move
ment to give her personal prejudices
more weight than they warrant and
more credibility than they would
otherwise ever have. It is by doing
this that she has done all of us, men
and women, an injustice.

Good men and rape
I do not wish to take issue with
Noel Hanrahan (The Daily, Jan. 14)
on the wrongness of rape, flashing or
pornography, but to extend the
blame for the acts to the population
in general. While 1 will never
pretend to be able to understand the
fear and anger a woman might feel, I
do not believe that the cause of those
feelings can or should be associated
only with the male population. Her
message about rape and attitudes
toward rape was unfortunately hid
den from many people by her attack
upon men.
Rape is a gender-specific crime.
Murder is specific only to the human
race. If I say that I do not draw the
distinction between good people and
murderers, I am extrapolating the
blame for the deaths of thousands of
men and women to the whole popu
lation. However, there is no way that
society can identify a John Hinckley
or a Dan White and stop him before
he kills. In the same way there is no
