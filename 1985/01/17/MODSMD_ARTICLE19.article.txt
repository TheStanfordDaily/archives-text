## Bowl and local business: boom or bust? 
### BRYN LLOYD 
A new line of Super Bowl items at
the bookstore, crews working around
the stadium and an increase in traffic
along Palm Drive are just a few of the
many harbingers of Sunday's big
event. However, the Stanford campus
is not the only spot which is being af
fected by the Super Bowl.
Local businesses in Palo Alto have
been eagerly awaiting Super Sunday
for months. Most are anticipating big
crowds and even bigger profits.
Preparation for the event is as
varied as the many stores and restau
rants. Some businesses have hired ex
tra staff and decorated their display
windows. But others just think it will
be business as usual.

Scott Goodman, manager of the
Town and Country Pharmacy, said he
was excited about the Super Bowl
and even more optimistic about the
profits. "We are expecting lots of
people. It is already overshadowing
anything else we've ever had in Palo
Alto. We're expecting all weekend to
be crazy," Goodman said.
Stickney's Fine Pastries manager.
Tom Stewart, shared in Goodman's
enthusiasm, and said he is ready to
work hard to earn extra money. "We
are anticipating a lot more customers.
Any football game at Stanford
generates a lot more business, but this
will probably be the biggest one be
cause it's nationwide," he said.
"We hope to be able to handle the

business," Goodman continued. "I
know we will. We'll work our fannies
off if we have to."
The Stanford Track House and
Sports Shop has hired extra people to
keep the projected increase in busi
ness under control, according to
manager John Jensen. "I normally
staff two people at the store. Now, I
have 20 people. I've increased my
staff by 10 times," he said.
Many of the entrepreneurs in the
area have stocked their shelves with
fast-selling Super Bowl items. "We're
selling Super Bowl shirts, trash cans,
scarves, post cards, beer mugs, coffee
mugs and books — everything thai I
can get my hands on that is an NFL
licensed product," Goodman said.

still, other ousinesses are not so
confident about the dramatic change
in profits.
\ldo Costello. sales manager of
( oors West Distributers, said he
hopes the game will have an effect on
business. "We will have to rely on the
retailers I he\ aren't allowing people
to bring alcohol into the game, and at
the game they're selling Budweiser
and Miller." he said.
"We definitely hope for an in
crease; all accounts are buying extra.
All the parties, restaurants and cock
tail lounge business will definitely
help." Costello said.
I lie effect the Super Bowl has on
local hotel business is already clear —
hotel rooms in the area have been

reserved for months. "We've been
booked up for four months — all 80
rooms. " said Jim Perkins, manager
of the Stanford Terrace Inn.
The Holiday Inn of Palo Alto has
also had all 200 rooms booked for a
month.
As they wait for the expected flood
of people, both hotels have beefed up
their security staffs.
"We are not hiring extra staff but
we will have more security." Perkins
said. "There will be more drinking
and activity than usual. People are
coming here to party and play. We
are in a vulnerable position and it is a
smart idea to protect ourselves."
Although the Super Bowl has
generated lots of work for the corn

munity, the majority of businesses are
glad the game is at Stanford. "I think
it is good for the area for people to
come." Perkins said. "I just hope that
everybody gives a good impression.
Most people are pretty excited and
curious to see how much commotion
the Super Bowl will produce."
Jensen said he is also anxious for
this weekend to arrive. "There is a lot
of anticipation — we are all excited to
see what will happen," he said.
There is also overwhelming sup
port among local businesses for the
San Francisco 49ers. Lisa Riedmiller,
manager of Gelato Classico, summed
up local sentiment with a yell of "Go
Niners!"



The relationship between local businesses here and the influx of people in town for the Super Bowl is one of
give and take. It seems that Palo Alto is ready to give visitors great service — and they are expecting great
profits in return. Hotels such as the Holiday Inn and the Stanford Terrace Inn have been booked for Super

Bowl weekend for weeks. Stores such as the Town and Country Pharmacy and the Stanford Bookstore have
stocked up on Bowl paraphenalia so visitors can prove that they were really at Super Bowl XIX. And after all
of their preparation, the businesses are ready for the big weekend to finally arrive.
