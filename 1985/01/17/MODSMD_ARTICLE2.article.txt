# Students welcome freer breathing
## Smoking ban praised 
### ANDY BISSELLE 
On Jan. 1. 1985. the Stanford University
smoking policy officially went into effect. The
new regulation prohibits cigarette, cigar and
pipe smoking in open-air offices, classrooms and
public areas including lobbies, restrooms, hall
ways and stairwells.
Reaction by smoking and non-smoking stu
dents has been varied. Random interviews by
The Daily revealed that most non-smokers are
satisfied with the policy, and many smokers,
while sympathetic to non-smokers health con
cerns. are bitter about the inconvenience caused
them.
Still, there have been few conflicts caused by
the new policy. Special Assistant to the Presi
dent Marlene Wine said that administrators and
staff members have commended the action
toward a "smoke-free environment."
Furthermore. Wine said, some smokers have
recognized this as an ideal opportunity to "kick
the habit." Thus, the program is aiding the
smoker as well as non-smoker. Wine said.
Robert Freelen. vice-president for public af
fairs. said he thought the policy was put into ef
fect at an appropriate time and thus has met with
few if any conflicts.
"The trainers of the policy were very sensitive
to all views when creating it. Freelen said.
Non-smoking student Larry Galka said he
feels it is his right to be able to take in tresh air.
Galka said those who choose not to smoke
should not be subjected to the harmful cigarette
fumes.
Another non-smoking student. Drew Erick
son, said "smokers can argue that they have the
right to smoke, but non-smokers also have rights

that must be considered."
Students Karin Elliot and Matt Bruck offered
strong support for the policy. Elliot said she felt
that smoke is a complete nuisance and that no
non-smoker should have to be exposed to it.
"As it has become increasingly apparent that
smoking endangers non-smokers as well as
smokers, it seems appropriate to remove this
danger," said Bruck. a non-smoker.
Smokers were divided in their reaction to the
new ban on smoking. Some were sympathetic
toward the non-smokers' view, while others
were bitter about the inconvenience that having
to go to a designated smoking area causes them.
"Smokers have no right to infringe upon non
smokers' right to breathe tresh air. said Dan
Delaney. a smoker.
John Brooks, a smoker, echoed these
remarks: "I totally respect the non-smokers
right to breathe fresh air."
Another smoker, who asked not to be identi
fied. said she felt that to prohibit smoking in
restrooms. stairwells and hallways was unfair.
Her reasoning was that the smoker is usually not
situated in these specific areas for a long period
of time.
She did. however, agree that smoking should
be banned in lounges and open-air offices where
an individual could spend a large part ot his or
her day.
Viola Pease, a secretary here, said she feels
very inconvenienced and singled out by the
policy. She said she is forced to leave her
workplace and go outside it she wishes to smoke.
This, she said, causes her to lose working time in
her office.
