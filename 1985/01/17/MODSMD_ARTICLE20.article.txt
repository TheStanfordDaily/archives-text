# Study of foreign language increases here
## 
### MARK LAWRENCE 
Dawn breaks and another day of
classes begins at Stanford. That inevi
table moment arrives, and students

pack their knapsacks with piles of
books for a day oi engineering, biol
ogy, political sciei and foreign
language.
Foreign language?
Yes, foreign language. Consistant
with a nationwide trend, language
study has increased dramatically here
at Stanford over the last few years,
and more students than ever are en

rolled in the University's language
programs.
Between fall 1980 and fall 1984.
enrollment in nearly every language
increased significantly. Russian
showed the greatest increase, up
94 percent over that four year period.
Japanese enrollment increased by
73 percent, Italian by 52 percent,
Portuguese by 46 percent and
Spanish by 22 percent. French, Ger
man and many more exotic languages
such as Arabic, Hungarian and
American Sign Language (offered by
the linguistics department when there
is sufficient interest) have also shown
increased student interest.
Only Chinese, down 3 percent,
has decreased in enrollment.
According to USA Today, be
tween 1980 and 1984 the total num
ber of students studying foreign lan
guages nationally increased by 4.5
percent, including a 40.2 percent rise
in Japanese and 26.7 percent rise in
Russian. Spanish, French, and Ger
man — the traditional Romance lan
guages— remained the most popular.
According to Stanford Japanese
Prof. Hiroshi Sakamoto, after years
of neglect in the 1960s and early

1970s — years during which students
were more interested in "the
humanities and ideas" than the ability
to express them — colleges began
reinstituting foreign language re
quirements in the mid 19705.
Stanford added a foreign language
requirement two years ago. Students
now must have completed three years
of high school foreign language, take

three quarters of college level lang
uage or pass a written examination to
demonstrate comparable proficiency.
In addition to the University's re
quirement, departments including an
thropology, history, art, international
relations and linguistics now have re
quirements of their own for their
majors.
However, Russian Prof. Richard
Schupbach believes the requirements
have little to do with recent interest in
languages. Indeed, reasons for taking

a language course are as varied as the
languages themselves.
For some, fluency in a language
may be invaluable in business-related
careers. Senior Claudia Schug. a resi
dent of the French House who has
taken German. Spanish and French,
forsees an international career in
wine importing and exporting.
On a less pragmatic level, she said

that she feels it is important, espe
cially for Americans, to be able to
talk to foreigners in their own lang
uage to study their culture.
"Otherwise you can't see things from
their point of view. Americans have
the cocky attitude that everyone
speaks English," Schug said.
Freshman Hadley Brown, who
began Russian last fall, is aware of the
reasons for studying a language.
"Language in general is really impor
tant as far as international relations
goes. I think a lot of Americans tend
to be really ethnocentric; they think
everyone knows English," she said.
Though interested in political sci
ence, Brown said she also studies
Russian "just because I enjoy it —
that's why a lot of people take it."

Schuphach believes much of the
recent interest in Russian is a result of
the increasing tensions between the
United States and the Soviet Union.
"The colder the Cold War gets, the
scarier and scarier the level of
brinkmanship, the greater the inter
est. he said. Many of his students are
interested in or plan careers in
politics.
In Japanese, the motivation is often
business opportunities. "Japan is
nouveau riche." Sakamoto said.
"Many students want to study more
pragmatic subjects. Japan's economy
is recovering, and they make the as
sociation."
Over the last 10 years of teaching
at Stanford, he has noticed the
growing number of business, engi
neering and law students among
those interested in Japanese.
However. Sakamoto asserts
beneath those interested in its
"pragmatic" applications is a "core"
of students who study language
purely out of interest in the culture
and in language in general.
Senior Peter Tarczy-Hornoch. a
resident of the French House, is typi
cal of this sort of language student.
He said of his French study. "It al
lows you to experience different cul
tural perspectives, read literature in
the original as opposed to translation
and it gives good perspective on
foreign issues."
Junior Mike Sheffels, a resident of
the German house, said he finds it
"really, really nice to be able to speak
the language when you travel to
Europe."
Since it is becoming necessary to
know foreign languages if one is to
succeed in politics, business, technol
ogy or law (all popular paths of study
here), the dramatic increases in
foreign language enrollment are
hardly surprising.
Richard Brod, director of the na
tional Modern Language Association,
told USA Today that the
"reawakening of interest occured be
cause of the need for foreign lang
uage experts by business and the gov
ernment. Plus, there was a desire on
the part of parents and students for a
traditional, quality education." Both
of these reasons are important ex
planations for the trend at Stanford.
