## Jason Cole Bowl relief, please 
### 
The way I figure it, in about a
week I'm going to be a much hap
pier and healthier person.
But not because I'm feeling so
terrible. I'm a bit under the
weather, but not so ill as led up.
Fed up with the Super Bowl, the
49ers, the Dolphins and every
thing else having to do with this
weekend.
Why? You'd think I'd be
waiting with bated breath for this
event. This is one of the biggest (if
not the biggest) events in sports,
and I should be more excited than
an eight-year-old on Christmas
morning.
Unfortunately, it's hard to get
excited about something that's

been so over-hyped, over-played,
over-covered, over-overed, over
and over again. I've seen so many
photographs of Joe Montana that I
know how deep his dimples are
and how big his nose is.
It's not just the sports section of
the local papers either. It's the
front sections of every paper. Day
after day, there are color pictures
on the front pages of the nation's
dailies.
Then there are the stories.
Stories about stories. Yesterday, I
read one report on a press confer
ence. It wasn't an interview, it was
a report about what was going on
at the conference. It went into
semi-meticulous detail about
where and how each player was
seated.
In newspaper lingo, this kind of
story is call a color story. I think
this one was colored gray.
Then there's all the useless ma
terial like "Super Bowl Diary." In

these stories, a player from the
49ers chronicles day-to-day occur
rences. Exciting things like how
lucky these players feel to be
playing football.
I call this stuff "Super Bowl
Trash." This stuff is useless drivel.
It's as if no other news in the world
is going on for the Bay Area
papers.
This is especially true of the
sports sections, in-which 99 percent
of the stories are about this game.
There are features about guys who
will play, guys who won't play,
guys who are retired and guys who
are dead.
The news is endless and usually
useless. I just think that this game

should be put into its proper per
spective.
Yes, this game is very impor
tant. But only as far as football is
concerned. Think about it, George
Shultz is negotiating the future of
the world, but if Joe Montana's
fiancee has a hangnail, that gets
put at the top of the page.
Yes, that's a bit of an exaggera
tion, but not by much. Some of
these papers are running predic
tions about who will win the game.
Problem is that most of these
people have little or no expertise
in football. Please stop this.
Now maybe I'm being a little
too hard on the other papers in the
area. I mean it's not every day that
the Super Bowl is played, not
every day that the 49ers are in it
and not every day that the game is
played in the Bay Area.
Maybe I'm being a little too
hard. Then again, maybe not.

Super Bowl hype has reached the point where we know Joe Mon
tana has a big nose and how deep his dimples are.
