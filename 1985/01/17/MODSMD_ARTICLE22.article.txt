# Card women hoping to fix basketball scoring troubles
## 
### JOHN LIS Daily staff 
After Saturday's 66-51 loss to
Fullerton State University, the Stan
ford women's basketball team knows
what its problem is: offense. The
Cardinal is hoping to solve its diffi
culty in scoring today when the Uni
versity of Arizona visits Maples
Pavilion in a 5 p.m. start.
Last year, Stanford beat the
Wildcats at Maples, 60-57, for its
only Western Collegiate Athletic As
sociation victory.
•"We've been watching film, and
they're a team like Fullerton — a
team we can beat - - but they're not
as good," guard Virginia Sourlis said.
Arizona, like Stanford 5-8 overall
and 0-1 in the WCAA, might be one
of the best opportunies the Cardinal
will have this season to win a confer
ence game. "It's a really important
league game for us," Head Coach
Dotty McCrea said. "We're the two
teams in the conference not consid
ered the race horses.
"They're where we are. We both
have to play good games to win —
perfect games against some of the
teams. We're evenly matched.
"It's important for us to beat them
at home. They're tough to beat on the
road."
Sourlis said, "We're pretty
psyched. We really need to win one."
McCrea said the Cardinal — whose
offense against Fullerton moved
about as fast as the lines at the Stan
ford post office — is working to cor

rect its offensive sluggishness. Doing
so would complement a defense that
played well Saturday.

"We've spent the past three days
on offensive fundamentals — moving
without the ball, pivoting artd pass

ing." McCrea said. "We're coming
along."
Sourlis said. "We have to try to
move without the ball. We have to do
what we didn't do against Fullerton
— screen and move without the ball.
The main focus is on the offense. The
defense and boxing out is OK — we
have to work on our offense and
scoring.
"We need to play instinctively, not
just run the offense. We have to think
about scoring. We're looking too
much for organization and structure,
and basketball just isn't that kind of
game. You've got to be instinctive
and take what the defense is giving
you."
McCrea said she will change her
starting lineup for today's game. For
ward Mary Bradach and guard Charli
Turner will play instead of Kim Mer
cer and Erica Mueser. McCrea said
she wanted a different combination
today, saying Bradach has played well
in her last few games and Turner
should be a shooter who can help
Sourlis bring the ball upcourt.
Everyone on the Stanford bench,
however, could see playing time. The
Cardinal has but nine healthy players
with the loss of center Barb Hunt,
who was diagnosed as having a bulg
ing disc in her back. That is the same
injury that has forced center Sarah
Evans to redshirt this season.
"1 guess I've been hanging around
Sarah too much," Hunt joked. She is
out for at least three weeks and might
miss the rest of the season.
