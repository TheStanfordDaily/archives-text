The Stanford women's gymnastics team will
open its season today at the University of Okla
homa.
Following the competition against the Sooners,
the Cardinal women, who were ranked 15th na
tionally last season, will compete on Saturday in the
Golden Gopher Invitational at Minneapolis, Minn.
Stanford Head Coach Homer Sardina said
today's meet against 18th-ranked Oklahoma will
be a fairly relaxed and easy competition. However,
Saturday's meet will bring together .three of the top
10 teams in the country. At Minneapolis, the Card
inal women will face eighth-ranked University of

Illinois, seventh-ranked University of Minnesota,
and fourth-ranked University of Georgia.
"My strategy for starting out the season away
from our region is so that we can have a good com
petition without being judged by the judges we will
be seeing all season in our region," Sardina said.
"The later into the season our judges see us, the
better we will be and the better impression we will
make.
"By competing in the Gopher Invitational, we
will also be able to see where some of the top
ranked teams stand in relation to us," he said.
The Cardinal women are starting out the season

later than usual, and a hit more reserv ed in terms of
difficulty. Sardina said hy starting the competing
season late, he hopes to maintain more intensity
this season. Sardina also said the lower difficulty
level of routines is because he doesn't want to
chance injury so early in the season. A few of the
Stanford gymnasts are already nursing injuries.
"What we are looking for is consistency," Sar
dina said. "We are hoping to start out the season
with a lower level of difficulty that will build consis
tency. The earlier we get consistent in the season
the better."
As of yesterday, it was unknown which gymnasts
would compete in the all-around.
