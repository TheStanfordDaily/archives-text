# Dolphins kicker hoping slump finished
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) â€” Per
haps only a good Super Bowl perfor
mance will salvage what has been an
off year for Uwe von Schamann of
the Miami Dolphins.
Von Schamann's season-long
slump has been a hot topic this week
as the Dolphins and the 49ers
prepare for Super Bowl XIX Sunday.
Von Schamann, a sixth-year pro,
was successful on nine of 19 field goal
attempts during the regular season.

He said with a shrug that he has no
explanation for his decline as one of
the National Football League's most
dependable kickers.
Von Schamann has watched him
self on film and consulted with others,
but said he never gets an answer.
"It seems to be a thing of dis
tance," said von Schamann, who was
seven for seven inside 30 yards but
zero for seven from beyond 40. "I
look at myself and see the same swing

I've always had."
This week, he hopes to change the
trend.
"I'm extremely confident going
into the game," said von Schamann, a
.708 career field goal kicker in his
first five NFL seasons.
"I don't have any problems with
self doubt or that kind of thing. I feel
as good as I've always felt," he said.
"As far as the season is concerned, it's
in the past. I don't think about it too

much."
He is two for five in postseason
play, but still has the support of Dol
phins Coach Don Shula.
"Uwe's had a real struggle, hut he's
faced the situation," Shula said. "It's
been tough. When you look around
the league, though, a lot of kickers
have had problems. "He's kicked the
ball well in practice and we're hoping
he's got it together and can help us if
he's called on Sunday."
