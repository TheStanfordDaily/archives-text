## Fields' beautiful but incomplete

Roland Joffe was a documentary filmmaker, .in well as a
stage and television director, before making hi* feature

summately. bv the Khmer Rouge * hen it has over
thrown l.on Nol, Jofte exposes the tighclv packed avers of
destruction and desolation in beautiful, agonized imagery
that may be the best of its kind ever realized in a movie. A
man in shorts wanders through the debris after a bombing,
searching vaguely for something or someone, scores of
workers in coolie hats till the land in hillside rows under
the watchful eyes of Khmer Rouge soldiers, their motions
stately and burdened with the weight of ritual or the inex
orable tyranny of a dream, then dritt toward the steaming
pots of meager lunch in the fine rain. A shot of bloody
bodies on a wharf or of the main Cambodian character,
Dith Pran (Dr. Haing S. Ngor). slipping into a pocket of
filthy water crammed with skeletons, recalls the end ot lng
mar Bergman's great anti-war picture. "Shame the
boat with Liv Ullmann in it trying to push away from
shore through a corpse-choked bay.
As the superlative cinematographer Chris Menges (who
worked with Bill Forsyth on "Local Hero' and "Comfort
and Joy") shoots the country, the dust from shells and
gunsmoke covers every thing — you can taste it — and the
colors of the landscape are tainted: A white-hot mist
fades the blue in the sky and the growing greens have a
sickly yellowish tinge. Only when Dith Pran escapes from
the fields where the Khmer Rouge enslaves him. and
where he is in constant danger of being exposed as that in
tolerable menace, an educated man, does Menges
brighten his palette, and then the colors are so exotically
rich, so Edenic. that they dazzle our eyes.
"The Killing Fields" is a powerfully and disturbingly
sensuous experience because Jofte thinks in terms of
movement, not tableaux. He places his camera so close to
the action in the confused crowd scenes (the first half of
the film feels like a series of evacuations and aimless,
pointless motion) that we collide with thighs and
shoulders, catch a glimpse of scarlet as a corpse passes on
a stretcher, bump up against the chaos. It's a daring way to

film scenes in which so much is happening, but as image
after startling image rushes past us. the unceasing stream
of horrors creates a unique tension. In the film's most
remarkable passage, the American Embassy in Phnom
Penh boards American citizens and their "dependents"
(Cambodians with whom they have formed close ties,
marital or otherwise) onto helicopters while Sydney
Schanberg (Sam Waterston), a New York Times corre
spondent whose professional relationship with Pran (a
combination journalist's guide/liaison man) has
blossomed into friendship, waits for Pran's family to
arrive. The sequence, which is almost silent except for the
whirring of the 'copter propellers and the indistin
guishable drone of voices beneath, is unbearably
suspenseful without ever resorting to the platitudes of an
eleventh-hour rescue scene. The restless camera and Jim
Clark's editing establish the panic we can't hear in the
voices of Schanberg, Pran and the other characters.
The friendship between Schanberg and Pran, and
Pran's eventual escape from Cambodia after Schanberg
proved unable to smuggle him out during the last evacua
tion (from the French Embassy in 1975, when the Khmer
Rouge took over the government and expelled all remain
ing Westerners), formed the basis of Schanberg's mov
ing piece in The New York Times Magazine on Jan. 20.
1980, "The Death and Life of Dith Pran." It is officially
the story of the film, too, but unlike Joffe's pictorial depic
tion of how a corrupt government and then a totalitarian
one broke the back of a country long bent under the whip
of invaders and oppressors, it has no real power. Joffe
must bear some of the blame for this, but most of it lies
with the screenwriter. Bruce Robinson, and with Sam
Waterston, who plays Schanberg. Robinson hasn't pro
vided scenes that allow Waterston and Haing Ngor to play
off each other in a way that will illuminate their
friendship. What we mostly see in their working time to
gether is Schanberg's bad-tempered impatience and
generalized indignation (prompted at different times by
the carnage, the lies of the American military, and the in
efficiency of wartime press communications systems), an
swered by Pran's stoic sufferance of everything Schanberg
hands out. The Times Magazine article talked least
briefly about the social relationship these two men
enjoyed (Schanberg mentions the first time he persuaded
Pran to smoke pot with him), but in the film we only see
them working together, and that they do with unwavering

solemnity. So when Pran calls Schanberg "mv brother."
we're a little bewildered about the origin of this filial
devotion, and when he sheds tears at their separation, we
don't feel the loss that would make the scene work on
anything higher than a superficial, sentimental level.
Haing Ngor. a non-professional actor, is tar from inept
in the role of Pran. and during the sequence in "the killing
fields" (the fields where the Khmer Rouge force the Cam
bodians to work, torturing and murdering men and
women at the smallest provocation) he does accomplish
something quote remarkable: He makes his intelligent
face a perfect blank so that his overseers, calling in French
for the educated among the workers to come forward to
the aid of the party, will perceive him as an untutored
peasant (and pass him over when, as he intuited, they
mark for execution all who have studied or taught). But
there is nothing in Ngor's performance to suggest the
stamina and shrewdness that secure his survival in circum
stances that appear to doom him to certain death. He's
not bad — just (in most of the film) uninspired.
But Sam Waterston. with his eyes set permanently at
self-righteous fury, is inadequate. You feel that he must
have overprepared for the role somehow, because none of
his angry or frustrated or frightened moments seems
legitimately triggered by the situations the character finds
himself in. (One exception: When he, Pran and two other
journalists are detained by the Khmer Rouge and forced
to observe a series of apparently random executions, we
can see Waterston's terror as he grapples with the possi
bility that he and his companions may be the next vic
tims.) Waterston has a thin, ineffectual voice that renders
him pretty much incapable of taking convincing command
in a crisis; he always sounds as if he were repressing a sob
or trying to get his voice to stop shaking. He doesn't use
this defect to comic effect, either, because he's not a comic
actor — though the only performance I've ever liked of
his, as the stoned half-Indian in "Rancho Deluxe," was
funny, in a loopy way. He's blandly, academically profes
sional, and in a role that Bruce Robinson has written only,
the contours of, he's the wrong actor to fill in the depths
that might explain this character or make him interesting.
Late in the picture, an argument between Schanberg
and freelance photographer Al Rockoff (who, along with
an Englishman named Jon Swain, tried unsuccessfully to
produce a phony passport picture for Pran to smuggle him
out of the French Embassy to safety) on the night Schan

berg wins a journalism award (intended, presumably, to
stand in for the Pulitzer Prize Schanberg won in fact) ad
dresses the issue the movie probably thought it was grap
pling with all along. When Americans were given the op
portunity to leave Phnom Penh, Schanberg opted to stay
on, and Pran. who could have fled with his wife and
children, remained with him. Schanberg dedicates the
award to the Cambodian people and accepts it on behalf
of Pran as well as himself, but Rockoff (John Malkovich),
unimpressed with Schanberg s words, accuses him of risk
ing Pran's life for career reasons — because he wanted to
win a prize for his reporting. The question of how much
truth is contained in Rockoff s charge, of how large a role
his love for Schanberg played in Pran's decision to stay in
Cambodia and how much Pran's self-image (his pride in
his position as a journalist making valuable contributions
to American coverage of the war) dictated his actions, is
such a provocative and highly charged one that when
Rockoff touches on it. we feel for a moment that the film
is caught in the grip of something immense. Our emo
tional response may also be due to the rather perfunctory
nature of the previous scene, in which Schanberg receives
the award, as well as to John Malkovich's intensity; he
gives a splendid performance. (The other fine actors in the
cast have much smaller roles — Julian Sands as Swain, Bill
Paterson and Athol Fugard as doctors, and Craig T. Nel
son as a military attache.)
But this confrontation is finally misleading, because the
script cheats on substance. The central relationship falls so
far short of carrying the film that the scenes of Pran's
escape, which rely on our identification with the character
(and with Schanberg), are slower than anything that has
preceded them, when anyone hearing a summary of the
narrative would assume they were the most exciting in the
picture. The movie wouldn't have any substance if Joffe,
Menges and Clark hadn't supplied such a profoundly
moving panorama behind the plot; the reason for the
decreased tension in the last half hour is the movie's per
manent shift from background (the plight of the Cam
bodians) to foreground (the plight of the Cambodian
protagonist), when there's no one on the screen but Pran
— and Mike Oldfield's insensitively aggressive musical
score, which accompanies him on his travels. "The Killing
Fields" would be a great movie if it didn't have a huge
hole in the center.
