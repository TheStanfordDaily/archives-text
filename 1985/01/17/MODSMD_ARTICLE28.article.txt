# Powerful potential lost in 'Translations'

The American Conservatory
Theatre production of Brian Friel's
lovely play, "Translations," opened
last week at the Geary Theatre in San
Francisco. Despite some good acting
by the cast and quite nice staging by
director Lawrence Hecht, the contin
ued failure of the actors to success
fully negotiate the British and Irish
accents (the major plot device in the
show) made the production disap
pointing and left the potentially pow
erful impact of the play to the
viewer's imagination.

"Translations" is set in a small
Gaelic-speaking Irish community in
1833. The British government is in
the process of a land survey of Ireland
which will better allow it to tax and
control the populace. As part of this
survey, the traditional Irish place
names are being Anglicized. The En
glish soldiers are nearly incapable of
communicating with the locals; there
are few people who can speak both
English and Irish (Gaelic). The play is
largely about various difficult at
tempts to communicate between the
cultures, or, as one character puts it,

"to interpret between privacies."
The action takes place in a tradi
tional "hedge-school," in which an
aging drunken schoolmaster (Dakin
Matthews) attempts to educate a
group of locals in Irish, Latin, Greek,
mathematics and geography. After
we witness the preparation for and
teaching of one of his lessons, the rel
ative quiet of the traditional class
room is broken by the master's oldest
son, Owen (Geoffrey Elliott) who has
been to Dublin, and now returns in
the employ of the British Army; he is
assisting in the creation of the new

place names.
Owen brings with him his pompous
commander (Ray Reinhardt) and his
friend Lieutenant Yolland (Mark
Murphey), a young Englishman in
charge of the place naming. The
lieutenant falls in love with an Irish
girl, Maire (Jane Jones), who was ap
parently almost engaged to Owen's
crippled younger brother, Manus
(Bruce Williams). The conflicts
arising out of the British imposition
of their language on Irish places and
of the love between the soldier and
the Irish girl make up the center of

the play.
A major device of the play is that
while all the actors speak English, we
are to believe that the Irish characters
are speaking Gaelic and cannot un
derstand or be understood by the En
glish. This is supposed to be accom
plished (one assumes) with carefully
delineated accents so that it is clear
when a character is speaking Gaelic.
This ought to result in the funny and
poignant situation that everyone on
stage is heard to speak English, yet
they don't understand each other at
all.

Unfortunately, no one in the cast
makes the distinction very clear. The
Irish accents waver in and out and the
upper-class British (which is the rep
resentation of spoken English) is used
inconsistently. As a result, much of
the heart of the play appears to be
lost, especially when the bilingual
characters are speaking and it is un
clear which language they are using.
The actors help this somewhat by
being uniformly clear about when
their character doesn't understand
