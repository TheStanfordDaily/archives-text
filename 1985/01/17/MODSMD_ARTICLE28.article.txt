# Powerful potential lost in 'Translations'
## 
### MARC FAJER 
The American Conservatory
Theatre production of Brian Friel's
lovely play, "Translations," opened
last week at the Geary Theatre in San
Francisco. Despite some good acting
by the cast and quite nice staging by
director Lawrence Hecht, the contin
ued failure of the actors to success
fully negotiate the British and Irish
accents (the major plot device in the
show) made the production disap
pointing and left the potentially pow
erful impact of the play to the
viewer's imagination.

"Translations" is set in a small
Gaelic-speaking Irish community in
1833. The British government is in
the process of a land survey of Ireland
which will better allow it to tax and
control the populace. As part of this
survey, the traditional Irish place
names are being Anglicized. The En
glish soldiers are nearly incapable of
communicating with the locals; there
are few people who can speak both
English and Irish (Gaelic). The play is
largely about various difficult at
tempts to communicate between the
cultures, or, as one character puts it,

"to interpret between privacies."
The action takes place in a tradi
tional "hedge-school," in which an
aging drunken schoolmaster (Dakin
Matthews) attempts to educate a
group of locals in Irish, Latin, Greek,
mathematics and geography. After
we witness the preparation for and
teaching of one of his lessons, the rel
ative quiet of the traditional class
room is broken by the master's oldest
son, Owen (Geoffrey Elliott) who has
been to Dublin, and now returns in
the employ of the British Army; he is
assisting in the creation of the new

place names.
Owen brings with him his pompous
commander (Ray Reinhardt) and his
friend Lieutenant Yolland (Mark
Murphey), a young Englishman in
charge of the place naming. The
lieutenant falls in love with an Irish
girl, Maire (Jane Jones), who was ap
parently almost engaged to Owen's
crippled younger brother, Manus
(Bruce Williams). The conflicts
arising out of the British imposition
of their language on Irish places and
of the love between the soldier and
the Irish girl make up the center of

the play.
A major device of the play is that
while all the actors speak English, we
are to believe that the Irish characters
are speaking Gaelic and cannot un
derstand or be understood by the En
glish. This is supposed to be accom
plished (one assumes) with carefully
delineated accents so that it is clear
when a character is speaking Gaelic.
This ought to result in the funny and
poignant situation that everyone on
stage is heard to speak English, yet
they don't understand each other at
all.

Unfortunately, no one in the cast
makes the distinction very clear. The
Irish accents waver in and out and the
upper-class British (which is the rep
resentation of spoken English) is used
inconsistently. As a result, much of
the heart of the play appears to be
lost, especially when the bilingual
characters are speaking and it is un
clear which language they are using.
The actors help this somewhat by
being uniformly clear about when
their character doesn't understand
someone else, hut it seems to me that
much of the potential richness of the
play is gone.
Accents aside, the performances
are quite good. Williams perfectly
captures the frustration and deter
mination of the lame Manus who is
forced to live off his father's leavings,
and also gets correct his exuberance
when he succeeds in getting a job and
in getting a mute girl to speak. The
character is not unfamiliar, but is
played absolutely convincingly. Jill
Fine as Sarah, the mute girl he
teaches, is equally good. Her
struggles to speak, and the triumph
that she displays upon vocalizing suc
cessfully are heartwarming. The
agony she undergoes later in the play
as things begin to go wrong for Manus
and she loses her ability to talk is
beautifully communicated; it is diffi
cult to watch the pain that she is
feeling.
Jane Jones and Mark Murphey as
the star-crossed lovers are both in
consistent. In the first and last acts,
while she is just with her own people,
there is something awkward about
Jones' Maire that doesn't really ring
true. His portrayal of the soldier, on
the other hand, is perhaps a bit too
polished. His romantic desire to settle
down permanently in the small town
often seems more like that of a
petulant and spoiled child who is
bored with life rather than that of a
thinking man dissatisfied with British
culture.
However, he gets better as he goes
on; as he gets drunk in the first scene
of the second act, he gets more realis
tic and more appealing and when he
reaches his love scene with Maire, he
is at his best. This love scene between
the British soldier and the Irish farm
girl is the best part of the play.

Though each can understand almost
nothing the other says, they manage
to communicate. One of the author's
funny and touching conceits is that
they often are saying exactly the same
things to each other and do not know
it.
The best sequence in the show
comes after she runs away from him
after reciting a line of English verse
which she has memorized, afraid she
has said something wrong. To get her
attention back, he starts calling out
the original Irish names of places he
has encountered in his work. She
begins to say other place names and
they approach slowly, seducing each
other with the sound and depth of the
names of the Irish countryside. This
scene alone is probably worth the
price of admission.
Dakin Matthews is very funny as
the erudite old teacher, especially
when he is in full classroom mode,
barking out the names of pupils ex
pecting the Latin root of the word he
just used or calling for a declension or
a times table. Sydney Walker is won
derful (though perhaps not very Irish)
as the oldest student in the school,
Jimmy Jack, a dirty old contemporary
of the master himself. He is ab
solutely in love with his learning, and
sits reading Homer and chuckling
over the events of the Odyssey as
though they were local gossip. He is
at his best describing his half-joking
love for the goddess Athena herself,
which is symbolic of the love that the
Irish have for learning and lore for its
own sake, which is apparently so
foreign to the British.
Geoffrey Elliott is fine as the
confused Owen who wants to be free
of the chains of the past but becomes
increasingly distraught at the cavalier
way in which his superiors treat his
people. Though he seems a bit
awkward at first, the growing confu
sion within himself is well demon
strated. The drunk scene with Mur

phey is also well done and very ap
pealing. Rosemarie Smith is mar
velously alive and appealing as
Bridget, one of the young women in
the school, full of gossip and giggles.
On the other hand, the other village
character, the class clown, Doalty (J.
Steven White), doesn't ring true in
much of what he says, and is almost
distracting at times.
Hecht seems particularly good at
creating the right atmosphere with a
group of people. For all the individual
Haws in the actors, the schoolhouse
sequences with all the local characters
present always have the right feel to
them: a mixture of familiarity, con
viviality and playfulness that is very
appealing. Similarly, the one-on-one
confrontations (between the lovers,
between Sarah and Manus, between
Owen and his friend, and Owen and
his father) are the best moments in
the show.
The moments of individual focus,
however, especially the climactic ex
plosions of Owen and Maire in the
third act, are not all they should be
and weaken what would otherwise be
a very tight show (aside from the ac
cent problem).
Friel's play is a marvelous thing to
listen to, even with significant aspects
of it missing or slightly inadequate,
and it is to the credit of the cast that
the beauty of the underlying work
shines out in many places. The com
plex thoughts about the lack of possi
bility of real communication between
cultures are well worth pondering,
and just absorbing the rich Irish use
of language interspersed with the
erudite bits and pieces of classical
learning that flavor the play is worth
your time. All in all, "Translations" is
an intriguing evening of theater, al
though this production will certainly
leave you with only a sense of how
good the play is, and an unsatisfied
yearning to see it done absolutely
right.

The American Conservatory
Theatre production of Brian Friel's
lovely play, "Translations," opened
last week at the Geary Theatre in San
Francisco. Despite some good acting
by the cast and quite nice staging by
director Lawrence Hecht, the contin
ued failure of the actors to success
fully negotiate the British and Irish
accents (the major plot device in the
show) made the production disap
pointing and left the potentially pow
erful impact of the play to the
viewer's imagination.

"Translations" is set in a small
Gaelic-speaking Irish community in
1833. The British government is in
the process of a land survey of Ireland
which will better allow it to tax and
control the populace. As part of this
survey, the traditional Irish place
names are being Anglicized. The En
glish soldiers are nearly incapable of
communicating with the locals; there
are few people who can speak both
English and Irish (Gaelic). The play is
largely about various difficult at
tempts to communicate between the
cultures, or, as one character puts it,

"to interpret between privacies."
The action takes place in a tradi
tional "hedge-school," in which an
aging drunken schoolmaster (Dakin
Matthews) attempts to educate a
group of locals in Irish, Latin, Greek,
mathematics and geography. After
we witness the preparation for and
teaching of one of his lessons, the rel
ative quiet of the traditional class
room is broken by the master's oldest
son, Owen (Geoffrey Elliott) who has
been to Dublin, and now returns in
the employ of the British Army; he is
assisting in the creation of the new

place names.
Owen brings with him his pompous
commander (Ray Reinhardt) and his
friend Lieutenant Yolland (Mark
Murphey), a young Englishman in
charge of the place naming. The
lieutenant falls in love with an Irish
girl, Maire (Jane Jones), who was ap
parently almost engaged to Owen's
crippled younger brother, Manus
(Bruce Williams). The conflicts
arising out of the British imposition
of their language on Irish places and
of the love between the soldier and
the Irish girl make up the center of

the play.
A major device of the play is that
while all the actors speak English, we
are to believe that the Irish characters
are speaking Gaelic and cannot un
derstand or be understood by the En
glish. This is supposed to be accom
plished (one assumes) with carefully
delineated accents so that it is clear
when a character is speaking Gaelic.
This ought to result in the funny and
poignant situation that everyone on
stage is heard to speak English, yet
they don't understand each other at
all.

Unfortunately, no one in the cast
makes the distinction very clear. The
Irish accents waver in and out and the
upper-class British (which is the rep
resentation of spoken English) is used
inconsistently. As a result, much of
the heart of the play appears to be
lost, especially when the bilingual
characters are speaking and it is un
clear which language they are using.
The actors help this somewhat by
being uniformly clear about when
their character doesn't understand
someone else, hut it seems to me that
much of the potential richness of the
play is gone.
Accents aside, the performances
are quite good. Williams perfectly
captures the frustration and deter
mination of the lame Manus who is
forced to live off his father's leavings,
and also gets correct his exuberance
when he succeeds in getting a job and
in getting a mute girl to speak. The
character is not unfamiliar, but is
played absolutely convincingly. Jill
Fine as Sarah, the mute girl he
teaches, is equally good. Her
struggles to speak, and the triumph
that she displays upon vocalizing suc
cessfully are heartwarming. The
agony she undergoes later in the play
as things begin to go wrong for Manus
and she loses her ability to talk is
beautifully communicated; it is diffi
cult to watch the pain that she is
feeling.
Jane Jones and Mark Murphey as
the star-crossed lovers are both in
consistent. In the first and last acts,
while she is just with her own people,
there is something awkward about
Jones' Maire that doesn't really ring
true. His portrayal of the soldier, on
the other hand, is perhaps a bit too
polished. His romantic desire to settle
down permanently in the small town
often seems more like that of a
petulant and spoiled child who is
bored with life rather than that of a
thinking man dissatisfied with British
culture.
However, he gets better as he goes
on; as he gets drunk in the first scene
of the second act, he gets more realis
tic and more appealing and when he
reaches his love scene with Maire, he
is at his best. This love scene between
the British soldier and the Irish farm
girl is the best part of the play.

Though each can understand almost
nothing the other says, they manage
to communicate. One of the author's
funny and touching conceits is that
they often are saying exactly the same
things to each other and do not know
it.
The best sequence in the show
comes after she runs away from him
after reciting a line of English verse
which she has memorized, afraid she
has said something wrong. To get her
attention back, he starts calling out
the original Irish names of places he
has encountered in his work. She
begins to say other place names and
they approach slowly, seducing each
other with the sound and depth of the
names of the Irish countryside. This
scene alone is probably worth the
price of admission.
Dakin Matthews is very funny as
the erudite old teacher, especially
when he is in full classroom mode,
barking out the names of pupils ex
pecting the Latin root of the word he
just used or calling for a declension or
a times table. Sydney Walker is won
derful (though perhaps not very Irish)
as the oldest student in the school,
Jimmy Jack, a dirty old contemporary
of the master himself. He is ab
solutely in love with his learning, and
sits reading Homer and chuckling
over the events of the Odyssey as
though they were local gossip. He is
at his best describing his half-joking
love for the goddess Athena herself,
which is symbolic of the love that the
Irish have for learning and lore for its
own sake, which is apparently so
foreign to the British.
Geoffrey Elliott is fine as the
confused Owen who wants to be free
of the chains of the past but becomes
increasingly distraught at the cavalier
way in which his superiors treat his
people. Though he seems a bit
awkward at first, the growing confu
sion within himself is well demon
strated. The drunk scene with Mur

phey is also well done and very ap
pealing. Rosemarie Smith is mar
velously alive and appealing as
Bridget, one of the young women in
the school, full of gossip and giggles.

character, the class clown, Doalty (J.

on; as he gets drunk in the first scene
of the second act, he gets more realis
tic and more appealing and when he
reaches his love scene with Maire, he
is at his best. This love scene between
the British soldier and the Irish farm
girl is the best part of the play.

Though each can understand almost
nothing the other says, they manage
to communicate. One of the author's
funny and touching conceits is that
they often are saying exactly the same
things to each other and do not know
it.
The best sequence in the show
comes after she runs away from him
after reciting a line of English verse
which she has memorized, afraid she
has said something wrong. To get her
attention back, he starts calling out
the original Irish names of places he
has encountered in his work. She
begins to say other place names and
they approach slowly, seducing each
other with the sound and depth of the
names of the Irish countryside. This
scene alone is probably worth the
price of admission.
Dakin Matthews is very funny as
the erudite old teacher, especially
when he is in full classroom mode,
barking out the names of pupils ex
pecting the Latin root of the word he
just used or calling for a declension or
a times table. Sydney Walker is won
derful (though perhaps not very Irish)
as the oldest student in the school,
Jimmy Jack, a dirty old contemporary
of the master himself. He is ab
solutely in love with his learning, and
sits reading Homer and chuckling
over the events of the Odyssey as
though they were local gossip. He is
at his best describing his half-joking
love for the goddess Athena herself,
which is symbolic of the love that the
Irish have for learning and lore for its
own sake, which is apparently so
foreign to the British.
Geoffrey Elliott is fine as the
confused Owen who wants to be free
of the chains of the past but becomes
increasingly distraught at the cavalier
way in which his superiors treat his
people. Though he seems a bit
awkward at first, the growing confu
sion within himself is well demon
strated. The drunk scene with Mur

phey is also well done and very ap
pealing. Rosemarie Smith is mar
velously alive and appealing as
Bridget, one of the young women in
the school, full of gossip and giggles.
On the other hand, the other village
character, the class clown, Doalty (J.
Steven White), doesn't ring true in
much of what he says, and is almost
distracting at times.
Hecht seems particularly good at
creating the right atmosphere with a
group of people. For all the individual
Haws in the actors, the schoolhouse
sequences with all the local characters
present always have the right feel to
them: a mixture of familiarity, con
viviality and playfulness that is very
appealing. Similarly, the one-on-one
confrontations (between the lovers,
between Sarah and Manus, between
Owen and his friend, and Owen and
his father) are the best moments in
the show.
The moments of individual focus,
however, especially the climactic ex
plosions of Owen and Maire in the
third act, are not all they should be
and weaken what would otherwise be
a very tight show (aside from the ac
cent problem).
Friel's play is a marvelous thing to
listen to, even with significant aspects
of it missing or slightly inadequate,
and it is to the credit of the cast that
the beauty of the underlying work
shines out in many places. The com
plex thoughts about the lack of possi
bility of real communication between
cultures are well worth pondering,
and just absorbing the rich Irish use
of language interspersed with the
erudite bits and pieces of classical
learning that flavor the play is worth
your time. All in all, "Translations" is
an intriguing evening of theater, al
though this production will certainly
leave you with only a sense of how
good the play is, and an unsatisfied
yearning to see it done absolutely
right.
