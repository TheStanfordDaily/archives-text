## Key officers quit jobs 
### CLINT HIGHFILL Senior staff writer 
Resignations were the main theme
of the first winter quarter meeting of
the ASSU Senate last night.
Council of Presidents (COP) mem
ber Alice Wells announced that she is
resigning her post, and Senate Chair
Eric Berg told the senate that
Senators Bob Slater and George
Ramos, as well as a senate associate,
have also resigned.
In a brief announcement. Wells
told the senate she is quitting her po
sition in the executive branch of stu
dent government "due to academic
reasons."
Graduate Senator James McGrath
said this is the first time a COP mem
ber has resigned since the council sys
tem was established in 1973.
Slater, best known for his efforts to
establish a Stanford-to-San Francisco
shuttle-bus service, was not present at
the meeting, but told The Daily in an
earlier interview he resigned because
"I recalculated my time schedule . . .
there was not enough time to give it
(the senate) the effort it deserves."
Ramos quit because he is stopping
out of school.
In other senate action. Provost
James Rosse addressed the group,
saying he expects additional dormi-

Tories to he built and existing dormi
tories improved in the near future.
"It now appears that sometime in
the next couple of years we will he
ahle to build more dormitory space."
Rosse said.
The University would also like to
involve more undergraduates in re
search here and huild a new center
for the LOTS computer system.
Rosse said.
Research is what makes Stanford
great, explained Rosse. and "We
don't think enough of that gets into
our undergraduate programs."
The new structure will be built in
the open space on the street between
CERAS and Meyer Library and will
house, in addition to the LOTS sys
tem, some offices currently in Old
Union.
The three remaining COP mem
bers caused a stir in the senate when
they announced their intention to
personally take up the slack caused
by the departure of Wells rather than
appoint a new COP member.
McGrath pointed out that five
months — nearly one-half of Wells'
term of office — remain, and only
three COP members "may not be
able to cover all the bases" since the

Citing "academic reasons," senior Alice Wells announced at last night's ASSU Senate
meeting that she will resign her seat on the Council of Presidents. Wells' term on the
council would normally have ended in June.
most difficult time period for the
ASSU is coming in the next few
weeks as the funding process for stu
dent groups gets underway and prep
aration for spring elections begins.
However, the COP members said
they had discussed their options and
concluded the most efficient way for
them to complete their business
would be without another member.
Said COP member Todd Kerr,
"The primary issue is finding a person

who will do an adequate job without
taxing our time more than it actually
is."
In addition, should the workload
become overwhelming, the remaining
COP members could still appoint a
fourth member at a later date, COP
member David Porter said.
In other business, the senate com
pleted the process of ratification of
constitutional amendments passed
last fall, made slight modifications to
the by-laws governing the actions of
the nominations commission and
passed a measure requiring the elec
tion commission to report more duti
fully to the senate when verifying

petitions.
More controversial pieces of legis
lation regarding the guest professor
ship bureau and the funding of stu
dent groups were referred to commit
tee.
Senate Chair Berg also revealed
that he has received replies to two
senate resolutions passed at the final
meeting of last quarter.
Marvin Herrington, director of the
University's Department of Public
Safety, said he reviewed the "post
game problems at the 1984 Big
Game" in response to a senate
resolution calling for an investigation.
Herrington said he concluded that "a

potentially violent clash' almost oc
curred because of a lapse in commu
nication. He proposed preventing
such situations in the future through
an "information program" similar to
that used before the Big Game rally
in San Francisco.
Assistant Dean of Humanities and
Sciences Carolyn Lougee responded
negatively to a senate call for a delay
in the final decision on ex
tradepartmental programs. Lougee
said the decision had to be made in
early January because of promises
made to the staffs of the five pro
grams under review.
