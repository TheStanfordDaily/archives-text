Resignations were the main theme
of the first winter quarter meeting of
the ASSU Senate last night.
Council of Presidents (COP) mem
ber Alice Wells announced that she is
resigning her post, and Senate Chair
Eric Berg told the senate that
Senators Bob Slater and George
Ramos, as well as a senate associate,
have also resigned.
In a brief announcement. Wells
told the senate she is quitting her po
sition in the executive branch of stu
dent government "due to academic
reasons."
Graduate Senator James McGrath
said this is the first time a COP mem
ber has resigned since the council sys
tem was established in 1973.
Slater, best known for his efforts to

the meeting, but told The Daily in an
earlier interview he resigned because
"I recalculated my time schedule . . .
there was not enough time to give it
(the senate) the effort it deserves."
Ramos quit because he is stopping

James Rosse addressed the group,
saying he expects additional dormi-

Tories to he built and existing dormi
tories improved in the near future.

our undergraduate programs."

the open space on the street between
CERAS and Meyer Library and will
house, in addition to the LOTS sys
tem, some offices currently in Old
Union.
The three remaining COP mem
bers caused a stir in the senate when
they announced their intention to
personally take up the slack caused
by the departure of Wells rather than
appoint a new COP member.
McGrath pointed out that five
