### JOHN WALLIN TELFORD WORK 
K/.SU will air the most promising tracks from these albums tonight at 6
The rating scale is one to five stars.

Malcolm McLaren — Fans ★ ★ ★
Malcolm McLaren has spent his
eight or so years in music pioneer
ing new concepts, and though none
of his work is very professionally
executed, all of it has been influen
tial: His work with the Sex Pistols
introduced punk to the music scene
in 1976-77 and his first solo album.
"Duck Rock" and its obnoxious
single "Buffalo Gals." are respon
sible for most of the scratching,
breaking and plastic clothing inun
dating shopping centers
nationwide. "Fans," and its current
single "Madam Butterfly," rock
izes movements from operas like
"Carmen," "Madam Butterfly"
and "Turandot," as well as moder

nizing some of the lyrics. Dance
oriented material, synths and
electronic drumming are combined
deftly with well-trained sopranos
and tenors, and rounded out by
Malcolm's very own narrating to
help explain the story so far to us
opera illiterates.

McLaren's idea of merging two
genres as totally different as these is
laudable: hut the final product here
feels somewhat stretched (even for
a six-song, thirty minute album)
and occasionally even boring. One
gets the impression that however
worthy the album's concept might
have been, there was only enough
substance for a few songs. Still.
McLaren is one of the only true ex
perimenters in pop music today,
and the scene needs all the help it
can get. We hope "Fans" will help
stimulate renewed interest in musi
cal experimentation and style
fusion; considering McLaren's past
experience fomenting musical revo
lution. that may not be all that
unlikelv.

Eurvthmics — 1984 (For the
Love of Big Brother) ★ ★
Vi
First of all, "1984" is almost all
background music. Second of all,
background music is easy to make,
and easy to sell. Name recognition,
rather than musical quality, sells
soundtracks, and groups often put
less than a total effort into their
production. Yep, you guessed it.
Only a few tracks are danceable
enough for hit status, and these are
butchered relentlessly by indis
criminate overdubbing. The
melodies are simple, the lyrics are
repetitive and the album's overall
feel is bland and uninspired. Con
sidering the creative possibilities of
a theme like " 1984," this album is a

substantial failure. The slow,
moody tracks fade from memory
almost immediately, and the poten
tial hits have almost nothing to do
with the theme of the music.
(Apparently the producers of the
film had a similar reaction upon
hearing the soundtrack.)
Eurythmics have a reputation for
putting minimal effort into their
music — their first album was
reportedly written, arranged, and
recorded in one day — but this col
lection of half-expressed ideas and
two-note melodies is truly disap
pointing. With a little more effort,
they might have brought more in
tensity and potency to a story that is
probably the most depressing of
any of the literature of this century.

Not that there's nothing to this ef
fort at all — some of the tracks arc
OK, and the group does manage to
convey some of the movie's inten
sity. But the soundtrack as a crea
tive entity simply doesn't cut it.and
Eurythmics could have done much
better.

Los Lobos — How Will the Wolf
Survive? ★ ★ ★ '/2
Everybody from the Rolling
Stone mainstreamists to under
ground rock critics is embracing
Los Lobos as God's regalo to pop
music. But however catchy their
songs, however refreshing their

style, however comforting it is to be
able to like an American band
again, Los Lobos ultimately fail to
deliver the all-around excellence
that everyone is attributing to
them. Their music is definitely fun
to listen to, it doesn't all sound the
same and it's not nearly as con
trived as most of the uninspired
trash that most of us dance to
anyway. Their styles range from hip
mariachi to nouveau R & B, the
lyrics are pretty evenly divided be
tween Spanish and English, and no
songs are so weak that they're un
pleasant to listen to. But there just
isn't anything that ties the whole
thing together and shoves it down
our critical throats.
"How Will the Wolf Survive"
remains a record full of good songs,
rather than a creative breakthrough

or a fully realized concept. Still, the
music is a pleasant return to roots
rock, with all its roughness and raw
inspiration, after the British Invas
ion of the last few years put sterile,
mechanized bands on the radio and
left American bands in the garage.
The recent resurgence of American
acts and an almost across-the
board weakness in British efforts is
clearing the way for a healthier
mixture of the two in the future.
Los Lobos are definitely young and
this is only their second effort; their
future growth as a band, a creative
force and a barrier-breaker will
ensure them a more prominent po
sition in tomorrow's pop music.

opera illiterates.

McLaren's idea of merging two
genres as totally different as these is
laudable: hut the final product here
feels somewhat stretched (even for
a six-song, thirty minute album)
and occasionally even boring. One
gets the impression that however
worthy the album's concept might
have been, there was only enough
substance for a few songs. Still.
McLaren is one of the only true ex
perimenters in pop music today,
and the scene needs all the help it
can get. We hope "Fans" will help
stimulate renewed interest in musi
cal experimentation and style
fusion; considering McLaren's past
experience fomenting musical revo
lution. that may not be all that
unlikelv.

Eurvthmics — 1984 (For the
Love of Big Brother) ★ ★
Vi
First of all, "1984" is almost all
background music. Second of all,
background music is easy to make,
and easy to sell. Name recognition,
rather than musical quality, sells
soundtracks, and groups often put
less than a total effort into their
production. Yep, you guessed it.
Only a few tracks are danceable
enough for hit status, and these are
butchered relentlessly by indis
criminate overdubbing. The
melodies are simple, the lyrics are
repetitive and the album's overall
feel is bland and uninspired. Con
sidering the creative possibilities of
a theme like " 1984," this album is a

substantial failure. The slow,
moody tracks fade from memory
almost immediately, and the poten
tial hits have almost nothing to do
with the theme of the music.
(Apparently the producers of the
film had a similar reaction upon
hearing the soundtrack.)
Eurythmics have a reputation for
putting minimal effort into their
music — their first album was
reportedly written, arranged, and
recorded in one day — but this col
lection of half-expressed ideas and
two-note melodies is truly disap
pointing. With a little more effort,
they might have brought more in
tensity and potency to a story that is
probably the most depressing of
any of the literature of this century.

Not that there's nothing to this ef
fort at all — some of the tracks arc
OK, and the group does manage to
convey some of the movie's inten
sity. But the soundtrack as a crea
tive entity simply doesn't cut it.and
Eurythmics could have done much
better.

Los Lobos — How Will the Wolf
Survive? ★ ★ ★ '/2
Everybody from the Rolling
Stone mainstreamists to under
ground rock critics is embracing
Los Lobos as God's regalo to pop
music. But however catchy their
songs, however refreshing their

style, however comforting it is to be
able to like an American band
again, Los Lobos ultimately fail to
deliver the all-around excellence
that everyone is attributing to
them. Their music is definitely fun
to listen to, it doesn't all sound the
same and it's not nearly as con
trived as most of the uninspired
trash that most of us dance to
anyway. Their styles range from hip
mariachi to nouveau R & B, the
lyrics are pretty evenly divided be
tween Spanish and English, and no
songs are so weak that they're un
pleasant to listen to. But there just
isn't anything that ties the whole
thing together and shoves it down
our critical throats.
"How Will the Wolf Survive"
remains a record full of good songs,
rather than a creative breakthrough

or a fully realized concept. Still, the
music is a pleasant return to roots
rock, with all its roughness and raw
inspiration, after the British Invas
ion of the last few years put sterile,
mechanized bands on the radio and
left American bands in the garage.
The recent resurgence of American
acts and an almost across-the
board weakness in British efforts is
clearing the way for a healthier
mixture of the two in the future.
Los Lobos are definitely young and
this is only their second effort; their
future growth as a band, a creative
force and a barrier-breaker will
ensure them a more prominent po
sition in tomorrow's pop music.

Malcolm McLaren — Fans ★ ★ ★
Malcolm McLaren has spent his
eight or so years in music pioneer
ing new concepts, and though none
of his work is very professionally
executed, all of it has been influen
tial: His work with the Sex Pistols
introduced punk to the music scene
in 1976-77 and his first solo album.
"Duck Rock" and its obnoxious
single "Buffalo Gals." are respon
