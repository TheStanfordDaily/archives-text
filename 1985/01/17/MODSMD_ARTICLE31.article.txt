The United States needs President Reagan's Strategic
Defense Initiative ' like we need a hole in the head."
retired Brig. Gen. Homer Boushey asserted last night at a
panel discussion on arms control and deterrence at Ter
man Auditorium.
Boushey said the United States should approach the
problem as former President Kennedy did in 1963 with
the Limited Test Ban Treaty, saying, in Boushey's words,
"we won't test in the atmosphere if you don't."
"We should do the same with anti-satellites today."
Boushey said. "Both (the United States and the Soviet
Union) can benefit by not putting weapons in space. We
have nothing to lose by say ing that we won't test or deploy
if they don't. It has worked in the past: it can work today."
Boushey, a former U.S. Air Force general, was joined
by Gloria Duffy, the former director of Ploughshares;
Alex Forman. founder of Californians for a Bilateral Nu
clear Weapons Freeze: Ed Woolery. a representative
from Livermore Laboratories; and History Prof. Barton
Bernstein, the moderator.
Bernstein, introducing the panelists, reminded the audi
ence of 1 00 people that "we meet amid a sense of peril, at
a talk titled "arms control' and not 'disarmament.' "
Boushey. a Stanford graduate in engineering who said
he made his career in the Air Force because he found that
he "liked flying a biplane and wearing a long white scarf
and leather jacket better than pushing a slide rule and was
better at it." began the discussion.
"I won't pretend to be a technological smart guy. I
think that common sense is all you need to face the prob
lem," Boushey said.
Boushey also expressed strong opposition to the Strate
gic Defense Initiative, commonly known as "Star Wars,"
on the basis of cost.
Boushey said he hoped that progress in arms control
can be made so that the "one-half trillion to one trillion
dollar expense (for Star Wars) that we don't need," can be
avoided. "The idea that we can spend the Soviets into the
Ice Age is foolish. I think this is a critical time in history
where I hope we can be smart enough, for once, not to
move warfare into another dimension," he said.
Woolery. the second speaker, began his talk with the
thought that "the issues we are facing are political, not
technical." He said the U.S. doesn't understand the
Soviets' goals and they don't understand ours.
"Imagine playing chess with someone who played by
different rules. International relations is like an anarchical
chess game." he said. "If we could understand each other,
we could come together."
Woolery's conception of nuclear weapons policy dif

fered from Boushey's in that he cited the Strategic
Defense Initiative as our "most important opportunity to
turn nuclear policy around."
Later, in a question-answer period. Woolery was asked
how he could justfiy large expenditures on Star Wars
"while there are famines in Ethiopia."
Woolery said that a rationale, not a defense, for nuclear
weapons is: "if \ou're going to have nuclear weapons as a
part of your defense, it is the cheapest way to go."
Woolery made two other significant points. He claimed
that the nuclear doctrine ot deterrence "is either in
operative or soon will be." But he also pointed out that
"in the short term — five to 15 to 20 years — deterrence
needs to be operative."
The next speaker. Gloria Duffy, began her speech by
refuting Woolery.
"Obviously, deterrence is operative." she said, imply ing
that if deterrence weren't operative there already would
have been a major conflict between the Soviet Union and
the United States.
"There is no consensus that deterrence is not operative.
There's plenty going on to save us from vulnerability." she
said, citing "the numbers and diversity of our forces" as
safeguards.
Duffy spoke next on the recent resumption of arms
negotiations in Geneva. "I see two major problems in the
new negotiations. One is internal in the U.S. and one is
external, between the U.S. and the Soviet Union." she
said.
Duffy said that, internally, there are "those concerned
with nuclear war and productive negotiations and those,
like (U.S. Secretary of Defense Caspar) Weinberger, who
are skeptical of talks." She said that those who are skepti
cal might use verification as a way of frustrating the
negotiations. "The direction of technological develop
ment and its exploitation make arms control difficult to
verify," she said.
"These new negotiations will be a productive step,"
Duffy said. Like Boushey and Woolery she pointed out
that arms control would be "a long process."
Forman, the final panelist, also began his talk by chal
lenging the information Woolery presented on deter
rence, saying that the United States is not vulnerable to a
first strike by the Soviet Union.
Forman said Woolery's deterrence argument is the type
used "to coerce American people into voting more money
into building more weapons."
Forman said the term "deterrence" is under attack by
two factions — one, "the victory-is-possible faction" and
the other, "the neo-deterrence faction."
