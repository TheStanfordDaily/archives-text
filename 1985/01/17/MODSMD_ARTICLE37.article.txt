# Big names won't be big factor
## 
### JASON COLE Daily staff 
The stories after Super Bowl XIX
will all say that guys named Marino,
Montana, Duper, Clayton, Tyler,
Clark or Solomon were the reasons
why one team won.
The quarterbacks, receivers and
running backs will get all the press
and all the attention. Maybe a defen
sive back like Ronnie Lott will get an
interception and get a big mention.
Or some linebacker will get a game
saving tackle and the press will
swarm.
But the people who win or lose this
game will go basically unnoticed.
They will beat on each other and
come away bloodied and bruised.
They won't score any points and
they'll probably only get mentioned if
they do something wrong.
They're named Stephenson,
Foster, Dean, Carter,' Cross,
Fahnhorst, Baumhower and Betters,
to name but a few. In fact, they may
mean more to this game than they
have in any game during the season.
These guys play offensive and de
fensive line for the Miami Dolphins
and San Francisco 49ers. On Sunday
in Stanford Stadium, the National
Football League championship will
come down to which line can outplay
the other.
The primary matchup among these
will be the San Francisco defensive
line against the Miami offensive line.
The 49ers will be faced with a task
that no other team has been able to
fulfill: They must get to Dolphin
quarterback Dan Marino.
Marino has been an elusive target
all season. During the regular season
he was sacked less than 20 times total
and the most by any one team was
three by the Los Angeles Raiders.
This elusiveness is despite the fact
that Marino (along with namesake
San Diego quarterback Dan Fouts) is
probably the classic drop-back pas
ser. Dangerous Dan just sits back in
the pocket while his line gives him
more time than it takes to read "War
and Peace."
It also helps that Marino has what
every football analyst calls the quick
est release ever. He can deliver the
ball with an unbelievable combina
tion of speed and accuracy.
The best example of this was in
Miami's season-ending game against
the Dallas Cowboys. On third down
in the fourth quarter of tie game,
Marino was taking the snap out of the
shotgun and the Cowboys were blitz
ing both a safety and a linebacker.

Marino, naturally, called a quick
out to wide receiver Mark Clayton.
Dallas cornerback Dexter Cltnksdale
anticipated the play perfectly and was
doing a fine impersonation of
Clayton's shadow.
Marino had only one place
to throw the ball (high and to
Clayton's right) and only a moment
to throw. He made it look like he was
playing catch with his dad and
Clayton scored easily.
But much of the credit must go to
the Dolphin's offensive line of guards
Roy Foster, All-Pro Ed Newman,
tackles Cleveland Green, Jon Giesler
and All-Pro center Dwight Stephen
son.
Critics like to say that the success
of pass-blocking offensive lines is due
to thefecent rule changes that allow
much more pushing, shoving and
even holding. That doesn't really ap
ply to the Dolphins since they have
refined blocking to the point that they
were the least penalized team in the
NFL.
San Francisco will counter with a
defensive line that features Dwaine
Board (10 sacks in the regular season,
1.5 in the playoffs), Gary "Big
Hands" Johnson (5.5, 2) and the
return to form of "Designated
Sacker" Fred Dean (4,3).
Toward the end of the season, the
49er's pass rush was starting to come
into its own, including eight sacks in
the National Football Conference
championship against the Chicago
Bears.
But the Dophins present different
problems for a pass rush. They have
been able to protect against any kind
of rush, be it three man or all-out
blitz. Even the weakest link of the
line, Green, was able to defray the
power of NFL sack champion Mark
Gastineau in the two meetings with
the New York Jets.
Besides having to vary its defense
constantly, San Francisco may have
to play Dean for most of the game.
Dean is usually used in obvious pass
ing downs. Since Miami's offense is
obviously passing. Dean will see a lot
of action, which may make him
weary.
If Marino has the time, he'll shoot
down anybody. It doesn't make a dif
ference if the opposition is all
nothing, all-pro or all-time. His 1984
statistics speak for themselves: 48
regular-season touchdown passes
(seven more in two playoff games),
5,082 yards passing (685 in the
playoffs), a 64.2 completion
percentage and a 108.9 rating. But

that's just the beginning.
The reason for much of Marino's
success also belongs to the Mark ll
combination of Clayton (73 recep
tions, including a NFL record 18 for
TDs in the regular season) and Mark
Duper (71 receptions, eight TDs) at
wide receivers.
If the 49ers don't contain (bump)
these two at the line, they will get
open eventually and usually earlier
than a defensive back can handle.
All-Pro Dwight Hicks, All-Pro Lott,
should be All-Pro Eric Wright and
Carlton Williamson may be the best
combination in the NFL, but it may
not matter.
For the Dolphins' defensive line
the problem is different, but nonethe
less complex. San Francisco quarter
back Joe Montana is the other side of
Marino: Mobile, improvisational and
has possibly the best arm in the NFL
on the run.
The 49ers' attack is also very
balanced, averaging 4.6 yards per
carry and 154.1 yards per game. It is
not, however, a power, straight
ahead, style like the Pittsburgh
Steelers used effectively in the Amer
ican Football Conference champion
ship game.
San Francisco uses a finess running
game. Lots of slashes, cuts and
sweeps, which is fine by Miami which
can handle a finesse (which it proved
against Dallas) style but not the
straight up game.
The only way that the 49ers will be
able to run on the Dolphins is if they
can set it up with the pass and catch
them off guard. Thing is, that is very
possible.
The Miami pass defense is, well,
porous. No matter what anybody tells
you, Don McNeal at cornerback is
beatable (albeit fast) and William
Judson and Paul Lankford, the other
two corners for Miami, are weak. The
Blackwood brothers (Lyle and Glen)
are hard hitters, too bad it takes a
while for them to get there.
Thus, the responsibility is on the
defensive line. Not only must Kim
Bokamper, Bob Baumhower and
Doug Betters get to Montana, they
must contain him.

Rest assured that these attacking
B's will get reinforcement from fellow
Killer linebackers Bob Brudzinski,
Mark Brown, Charles Bowser, A.J.
Duhe and Jay Brophy in the form of
blitzes.
Montana is just as adept as Marino
at handling the blitz, although in a
much different way. He can role,

duck, scramble and then find some
body somewhere. It is almost as if he
knows where every player is on the
field.
This is not to say that the 49ers" of
fensive line isn't proficient at what it
does, it is different however. The line
features two All-Pro starters in guard


Jill Gilbert/Daily
Freddie Solomon is the 49ers' deep threat with 10 touchdown receptions
during the regular season.


Adam Grossman/Daily
Miami wide receiver Mark Duper will keep any defense off balance if allowed to roam free in the secondary. Duper
scored two touchdowns in the AFC championship game against Pittsburgh.


Jill Gilbert/Daily
San Francisco wide receiver Dwight Clark is one of the NFL's finest possession
receivers averaging 16.9 yards per catch.
Randy Cross and center Fred Ouil
lan, along with Pro Bowl reserve
tackle Keith Fahnhorst, guard John
Ayers and tackle William "Bubba"
Paris.
If the Killer B's can't sting, then
Montana will have a field day. Wide
receivers Dwight Clark (52 recep
tions, 6 touchdowns) and Freddie
Solomon (40 receptions, 10 touch
downs) may not be the deep threats
that Pittsburgh's John Stallworth and
Louis Lipps are, but they are fine
receivers.
San Francisco's leading receiver
was running back Roger Craig (71
receptions, 3 touchdown, 9.5 yards
per catch) and will be Montana's con
stant safety valve. Pro Bowl selection
Wendell Tyler will key the ground
game. He led the 49ers with a team
record 1 262 yards in the regular
season, averaging 5.1 yards per carry.
As far a special teams and coaches
are concerned, it's a tie. In punting,
Miami's Reggie Roby may be the
only punter who could be called ex
citing.
San Francisco's Ray Wersching is a
far superior kicker to Uwe von
Schamann. Wersching didn't miss an
extra point and was 25-35 on field
goals. Von Schamann has a great leg
but no confidence, he can't hit a thing
outside of 40 yards.

But much of the credit must go to
the Dolphin's offensive line of guards
Roy Foster, All-Pro Ed Newman,
tackles Cleveland Green, Jon Giesler
and All-Pro center Dwight Stephen
son.
Critics like to say that the success
of pass-blocking offensive lines is due
to thefecent rule changes that allow
much more pushing, shoving and
even holding. That doesn't really ap
ply to the Dolphins since they have
refined blocking to the point that they
were the least penalized team in the
NFL.
San Francisco will counter with a
defensive line that features Dwaine
Board (10 sacks in the regular season,
1.5 in the playoffs), Gary "Big
Hands" Johnson (5.5, 2) and the
return to form of "Designated
Sacker" Fred Dean (4,3).
Toward the end of the season, the
49er's pass rush was starting to come
into its own, including eight sacks in
the National Football Conference
championship against the Chicago
Bears.
But the Dophins present different
problems for a pass rush. They have
been able to protect against any kind
of rush, be it three man or all-out
blitz. Even the weakest link of the
line, Green, was able to defray the
power of NFL sack champion Mark
Gastineau in the two meetings with
the New York Jets.
Besides having to vary its defense
constantly, San Francisco may have
to play Dean for most of the game.
Dean is usually used in obvious pass
ing downs. Since Miami's offense is
obviously passing. Dean will see a lot
of action, which may make him
weary.
If Marino has the time, he'll shoot
down anybody. It doesn't make a dif
ference if the opposition is all
nothing, all-pro or all-time. His 1984
statistics speak for themselves: 48
regular-season touchdown passes
(seven more in two playoff games),
5,082 yards passing (685 in the
playoffs), a 64.2 completion
percentage and a 108.9 rating. But

that's just the beginning.
The reason for much of Marino's
success also belongs to the Mark ll
combination of Clayton (73 recep
tions, including a NFL record 18 for
TDs in the regular season) and Mark
Duper (71 receptions, eight TDs) at
wide receivers.
If the 49ers don't contain (bump)
these two at the line, they will get
open eventually and usually earlier
than a defensive back can handle.
All-Pro Dwight Hicks, All-Pro Lott,
should be All-Pro Eric Wright and
Carlton Williamson may be the best
combination in the NFL, but it may
not matter.
For the Dolphins' defensive line
the problem is different, but nonethe
less complex. San Francisco quarter
back Joe Montana is the other side of
Marino: Mobile, improvisational and
has possibly the best arm in the NFL
on the run.
The 49ers' attack is also very
balanced, averaging 4.6 yards per
carry and 154.1 yards per game. It is
not, however, a power, straight
ahead, style like the Pittsburgh
Steelers used effectively in the Amer
ican Football Conference champion
ship game.
San Francisco uses a finess running
game. Lots of slashes, cuts and
sweeps, which is fine by Miami which
can handle a finesse (which it proved
against Dallas) style but not the
straight up game.
The only way that the 49ers will be
able to run on the Dolphins is if they
can set it up with the pass and catch
them off guard. Thing is, that is very
possible.
The Miami pass defense is, well,
porous. No matter what anybody tells
you, Don McNeal at cornerback is
beatable (albeit fast) and William
Judson and Paul Lankford, the other
two corners for Miami, are weak. The
Blackwood brothers (Lyle and Glen)
are hard hitters, too bad it takes a
while for them to get there.
Thus, the responsibility is on the
defensive line. Not only must Kim
Bokamper, Bob Baumhower and
Doug Betters get to Montana, they
must contain him.

Rest assured that these attacking
B's will get reinforcement from fellow
Killer linebackers Bob Brudzinski,
Mark Brown, Charles Bowser, A.J.
Duhe and Jay Brophy in the form of
blitzes.
Montana is just as adept as Marino
at handling the blitz, although in a
much different way. He can role,

duck, scramble and then find some
body somewhere. It is almost as if he
knows where every player is on the
field.
This is not to say that the 49ers" of
fensive line isn't proficient at what it
does, it is different however. The line
features two All-Pro starters in guard


Jill Gilbert/Daily
Freddie Solomon is the 49ers' deep threat with 10 touchdown receptions
during the regular season.


Adam Grossman/Daily
Miami wide receiver Mark Duper will keep any defense off balance if allowed to roam free in the secondary. Duper
scored two touchdowns in the AFC championship game against Pittsburgh.


Jill Gilbert/Daily
San Francisco wide receiver Dwight Clark is one of the NFL's finest possession
receivers averaging 16.9 yards per catch.
Randy Cross and center Fred Ouil
lan, along with Pro Bowl reserve
tackle Keith Fahnhorst, guard John
Ayers and tackle William "Bubba"
Paris.
If the Killer B's can't sting, then
Montana will have a field day. Wide
receivers Dwight Clark (52 recep
tions, 6 touchdowns) and Freddie
Solomon (40 receptions, 10 touch
downs) may not be the deep threats
that Pittsburgh's John Stallworth and
Louis Lipps are, but they are fine
receivers.
San Francisco's leading receiver
was running back Roger Craig (71
receptions, 3 touchdown, 9.5 yards
per catch) and will be Montana's con
stant safety valve. Pro Bowl selection
Wendell Tyler will key the ground
game. He led the 49ers with a team
record 1 262 yards in the regular
season, averaging 5.1 yards per carry.
As far a special teams and coaches
are concerned, it's a tie. In punting,
Miami's Reggie Roby may be the
only punter who could be called ex
citing.
San Francisco's Ray Wersching is a
far superior kicker to Uwe von
Schamann. Wersching didn't miss an
extra point and was 25-35 on field
goals. Von Schamann has a great leg
but no confidence, he can't hit a thing
outside of 40 yards.

Super Bowl XIX will probably come down to which line can outplay the other.
The Miami offensive line has been spectacular all year in protecting Dan
Marino.


Jill Gilbert/Daily
San Francisco running back Wendell Tyler set a team record with 1262 yards
rushing during the regular season. The Dolphin's defense may, however, give
Tyler some problems.
The stories after Super Bowl XIX
will all say that guys named Marino,
Montana, Duper, Clayton, Tyler,
Clark or Solomon were the reasons
why one team won.
The quarterbacks, receivers and
running backs will get all the press
and all the attention. Maybe a defen
sive back like Ronnie Lott will get an
interception and get a big mention.
Or some linebacker will get a game
saving tackle and the press will
swarm.
But the people who win or lose this
game will go basically unnoticed.
They will beat on each other and
come away bloodied and bruised.
They won't score any points and
they'll probably only get mentioned if
they do something wrong.
They're named Stephenson,
Foster, Dean, Carter,' Cross,
Fahnhorst, Baumhower and Betters,
to name but a few. In fact, they may
mean more to this game than they
have in any game during the season.
These guys play offensive and de
fensive line for the Miami Dolphins
and San Francisco 49ers. On Sunday
in Stanford Stadium, the National
Football League championship will
come down to which line can outplay
the other.
The primary matchup among these
will be the San Francisco defensive
line against the Miami offensive line.
The 49ers will be faced with a task
that no other team has been able to
fulfill: They must get to Dolphin
quarterback Dan Marino.
Marino has been an elusive target
all season. During the regular season
he was sacked less than 20 times total
and the most by any one team was
three by the Los Angeles Raiders.
This elusiveness is despite the fact
that Marino (along with namesake
San Diego quarterback Dan Fouts) is
probably the classic drop-back pas
ser. Dangerous Dan just sits back in
the pocket while his line gives him
more time than it takes to read "War
and Peace."
It also helps that Marino has what
every football analyst calls the quick
est release ever. He can deliver the
ball with an unbelievable combina
tion of speed and accuracy.
The best example of this was in
Miami's season-ending game against
the Dallas Cowboys. On third down
in the fourth quarter of tie game,
Marino was taking the snap out of the
shotgun and the Cowboys were blitz
ing both a safety and a linebacker.

Marino, naturally, called a quick
out to wide receiver Mark Clayton.
Dallas cornerback Dexter Cltnksdale
anticipated the play perfectly and was
doing a fine impersonation of
Clayton's shadow.
Marino had only one place
to throw the ball (high and to
Clayton's right) and only a moment
to throw. He made it look like he was
playing catch with his dad and
Clayton scored easily.
But much of the credit must go to
the Dolphin's offensive line of guards
Roy Foster, All-Pro Ed Newman,
tackles Cleveland Green, Jon Giesler
and All-Pro center Dwight Stephen

not matter.
For the Dolphins' defensive line
the problem is different, but nonethe
less complex. San Francisco quarter
back Joe Montana is the other side of
Marino: Mobile, improvisational and
has possibly the best arm in the NFL
on the run.
The 49ers' attack is also very
balanced, averaging 4.6 yards per
carry and 154.1 yards per game. It is
not, however, a power, straight
ahead, style like the Pittsburgh
Steelers used effectively in the Amer
ican Football Conference champion
ship game.
San Francisco uses a finess running
game. Lots of slashes, cuts and
sweeps, which is fine by Miami which
can handle a finesse (which it proved
against Dallas) style but not the
straight up game.
The only way that the 49ers will be
able to run on the Dolphins is if they
can set it up with the pass and catch
them off guard. Thing is, that is very
possible.
The Miami pass defense is, well,
porous. No matter what anybody tells
you, Don McNeal at cornerback is
beatable (albeit fast) and William
Judson and Paul Lankford, the other
two corners for Miami, are weak. The
Blackwood brothers (Lyle and Glen)
are hard hitters, too bad it takes a
while for them to get there.
Thus, the responsibility is on the
defensive line. Not only must Kim
Bokamper, Bob Baumhower and
Doug Betters get to Montana, they
must contain him.

Rest assured that these attacking
B's will get reinforcement from fellow
Killer linebackers Bob Brudzinski,
Mark Brown, Charles Bowser, A.J.
Duhe and Jay Brophy in the form of
blitzes.
Montana is just as adept as Marino
at handling the blitz, although in a
much different way. He can role,

duck, scramble and then find some
body somewhere. It is almost as if he
knows where every player is on the
field.
This is not to say that the 49ers" of
fensive line isn't proficient at what it
does, it is different however. The line
features two All-Pro starters in guard


Jill Gilbert/Daily
Freddie Solomon is the 49ers' deep threat with 10 touchdown receptions
during the regular season.


Adam Grossman/Daily
Miami wide receiver Mark Duper will keep any defense off balance if allowed to roam free in the secondary. Duper
scored two touchdowns in the AFC championship game against Pittsburgh.


Jill Gilbert/Daily
San Francisco wide receiver Dwight Clark is one of the NFL's finest possession
receivers averaging 16.9 yards per catch.
Randy Cross and center Fred Ouil
lan, along with Pro Bowl reserve
tackle Keith Fahnhorst, guard John
Ayers and tackle William "Bubba"
Paris.
If the Killer B's can't sting, then
Montana will have a field day. Wide
receivers Dwight Clark (52 recep
tions, 6 touchdowns) and Freddie
Solomon (40 receptions, 10 touch
downs) may not be the deep threats
that Pittsburgh's John Stallworth and
Louis Lipps are, but they are fine
receivers.
San Francisco's leading receiver
was running back Roger Craig (71
receptions, 3 touchdown, 9.5 yards
per catch) and will be Montana's con
stant safety valve. Pro Bowl selection
Wendell Tyler will key the ground
game. He led the 49ers with a team
record 1 262 yards in the regular
season, averaging 5.1 yards per carry.
As far a special teams and coaches
are concerned, it's a tie. In punting,
Miami's Reggie Roby may be the
only punter who could be called ex
citing.
San Francisco's Ray Wersching is a
far superior kicker to Uwe von
Schamann. Wersching didn't miss an
extra point and was 25-35 on field
goals. Von Schamann has a great leg
but no confidence, he can't hit a thing
outside of 40 yards.

Super Bowl XIX will probably come down to which line can outplay the other.
The Miami offensive line has been spectacular all year in protecting Dan
Marino.


Jill Gilbert/Daily
San Francisco running back Wendell Tyler set a team record with 1262 yards
rushing during the regular season. The Dolphin's defense may, however, give
Tyler some problems.
The stories after Super Bowl XIX
will all say that guys named Marino,
Montana, Duper, Clayton, Tyler,
Clark or Solomon were the reasons
why one team won.
The quarterbacks, receivers and
running backs will get all the press
and all the attention. Maybe a defen
sive back like Ronnie Lott will get an
interception and get a big mention.
Or some linebacker will get a game
saving tackle and the press will
swarm.
But the people who win or lose this
game will go basically unnoticed.
They will beat on each other and
come away bloodied and bruised.
They won't score any points and
they'll probably only get mentioned if
they do something wrong.
They're named Stephenson,
Foster, Dean, Carter,' Cross,
Fahnhorst, Baumhower and Betters,
to name but a few. In fact, they may
mean more to this game than they
have in any game during the season.
These guys play offensive and de
fensive line for the Miami Dolphins
and San Francisco 49ers. On Sunday
in Stanford Stadium, the National
Football League championship will
come down to which line can outplay
the other.
The primary matchup among these
will be the San Francisco defensive
line against the Miami offensive line.
The 49ers will be faced with a task
that no other team has been able to
fulfill: They must get to Dolphin
quarterback Dan Marino.
Marino has been an elusive target
all season. During the regular season
he was sacked less than 20 times total
and the most by any one team was
three by the Los Angeles Raiders.
This elusiveness is despite the fact
that Marino (along with namesake
San Diego quarterback Dan Fouts) is
probably the classic drop-back pas
ser. Dangerous Dan just sits back in
the pocket while his line gives him
more time than it takes to read "War
and Peace."
It also helps that Marino has what
every football analyst calls the quick
est release ever. He can deliver the
ball with an unbelievable combina
tion of speed and accuracy.
The best example of this was in
Miami's season-ending game against
the Dallas Cowboys. On third down
in the fourth quarter of tie game,
Marino was taking the snap out of the
shotgun and the Cowboys were blitz
ing both a safety and a linebacker.

Marino, naturally, called a quick
out to wide receiver Mark Clayton.
Dallas cornerback Dexter Cltnksdale
anticipated the play perfectly and was
doing a fine impersonation of
Clayton's shadow.
Marino had only one place
to throw the ball (high and to
Clayton's right) and only a moment
to throw. He made it look like he was
playing catch with his dad and
Clayton scored easily.
But much of the credit must go to
the Dolphin's offensive line of guards
Roy Foster, All-Pro Ed Newman,
tackles Cleveland Green, Jon Giesler
and All-Pro center Dwight Stephen
son.
Critics like to say that the success
of pass-blocking offensive lines is due
to thefecent rule changes that allow
much more pushing, shoving and
even holding. That doesn't really ap
ply to the Dolphins since they have
refined blocking to the point that they
were the least penalized team in the
NFL.
San Francisco will counter with a
defensive line that features Dwaine
Board (10 sacks in the regular season,
1.5 in the playoffs), Gary "Big
Hands" Johnson (5.5, 2) and the
return to form of "Designated
Sacker" Fred Dean (4,3).
Toward the end of the season, the
49er's pass rush was starting to come
into its own, including eight sacks in
the National Football Conference
championship against the Chicago
Bears.
But the Dophins present different
problems for a pass rush. They have
been able to protect against any kind
of rush, be it three man or all-out
blitz. Even the weakest link of the
line, Green, was able to defray the
power of NFL sack champion Mark
Gastineau in the two meetings with
the New York Jets.
Besides having to vary its defense
constantly, San Francisco may have
to play Dean for most of the game.
Dean is usually used in obvious pass
ing downs. Since Miami's offense is
obviously passing. Dean will see a lot
of action, which may make him
weary.
If Marino has the time, he'll shoot
down anybody. It doesn't make a dif
ference if the opposition is all
nothing, all-pro or all-time. His 1984
statistics speak for themselves: 48
regular-season touchdown passes
(seven more in two playoff games),
5,082 yards passing (685 in the
playoffs), a 64.2 completion
percentage and a 108.9 rating. But

that's just the beginning.
The reason for much of Marino's
success also belongs to the Mark ll
combination of Clayton (73 recep
tions, including a NFL record 18 for
TDs in the regular season) and Mark
Duper (71 receptions, eight TDs) at
wide receivers.
If the 49ers don't contain (bump)
these two at the line, they will get
open eventually and usually earlier
than a defensive back can handle.
All-Pro Dwight Hicks, All-Pro Lott,
should be All-Pro Eric Wright and
Carlton Williamson may be the best
combination in the NFL, but it may
not matter.
For the Dolphins' defensive line
the problem is different, but nonethe
less complex. San Francisco quarter
back Joe Montana is the other side of
Marino: Mobile, improvisational and
