# QBs key for different reasons
## 
### DAVE DUTCHER Daily staff 
Many have said and written that
the teams in Super Bowl XIX Sunday
are the best in the National Football
League. In other words. Team Cin
derella didn't come to this ball, and

the teams that deserve to be in uni
form at Stanford Stadium are here.
If this widely held contention is
taken for truth, and if one looks for
the best reason why the San Francisco
49ers and the Miami Dolphins are
representing the National Football

Conference and the American Foot
ball Conference, respectively, one
needn't look too far.
It is the position of quarterback
that serves as the hub around which
the Dolphins and the 49ers operate.
However, while both Sunday's start
ing quarterbacks are irreplaceable,
the 49ers Joe Montana and the Dol
phins Dan Marino are for different
reasons.
Montana directs what has been
called — and sometimes sharply
criticized — a finesse offense. He
relies on improvisation and instinct
when plays break down, as evidenced
by the renowned 'The Play," which
defeated Dallas in the NFC champi
onship game in 1982 and preceded
San Francisco's victory in Super Bowl
XVI.
Montana relies less on raw physical
talent than does his counterpart, but
in the 49ers' controlled, short passing
game, execution is primary. In fact,
Montana is quick to admit a physical
inferiority, if you will, to Marino.
At a* press conference Monday
evening, Montana was asked if he
ever yearned to be the quarterback in
the Dolphins' long-bail offense. "I
don't know. I might wear my arm out
real fast," he said. "It's not that
strong to begin with.
"We're two different styles," Mon
tana told the San Francisco
Chronicle. "He (Marino) is much
more the pure passer, where we're
the ball-control type. He's going to
throw the ball down the field a lot.
That's not our intention with this
whole offense."
According to San Francisco Coach
Bill Walsh, Montana also possesses
qualities that separate quarterbacks
from good athletes.
"Joe had great poise, a great calm

Joe Montana is one of the most mobile and improvisational quarterbacks in the
NFL, making him the best suited player to run the 49er's offense.

Miami's Dan Marino may be the prototypical stand-back-and-shoot quarter
back, but he rarely gets shot down.
about him for a young quarterback,"
Walsh told the Chicago Tribune. "It
wasn't that he was a 'smart' quarter
back in any intellectual sense, but he
could think on his feet. And his physi
cal skills were more than adequate, or
at least we thought so."
Along with poise goes confidence,
like Montana exhibited in the touch
down drive in the aforementioned
victory over Dallas.
"Joe just came into the huddle and
called the plays," tackle Keith
Fahnhorst said. "That's Joe. He
doesn't say a lot, but he gives off a lot
of confidence in the huddle."
Montana, a third-round draft
choice in 1979, has come under fire
late in the season and in the playoffs
for unspectacular play. In his past
three games — two in the playoffs
against the New York Giants and
Chicago and the 49ers' final regular
season game against the Los Angeles
Rams — Montana has thrown five in
terceptions.
But Montana's critics haven't con
vinced him. Asked if he needed to
improve his game, he said, "I don't
think so. (I had) maybe one bad pass
down in the endzone against the
Bears. But other than that, I don't
think it's anything to worry about.
"If I was in a bad slump ... I don't

think we'd be this far. You look
around the league, and guys have
played like I've played in the last
couple of weeks all year long, so I
don't feel like I'm in a slump."
Few, if any, have said Marino is
slumping. Most, in fact, have said the
opposite. And with good reason.
There must be something right if
you're a second-year quarterback and
people are saying you have a chance
to become the greatest quarterback
ever. A Wayne Gretzky of profes
sional football, if you will.
Now the statistics and the honors.
Marino has passed for 5,084 yards
and 48 touchdowns — no, not in his
career, during this regular season —
and that doesn't include two produc
tive playoff games against Seattle and
Pittsburgh. Both figures are records.
Marino's awards include being named
the NFL's most valuable player by
the Pro Football Writers Association,
and more, probably will follow for
Marino, who will play in the Pro Bowl
next Saturday.
"You don't break all the records
Dan Marino has broken this season
without doing something right,"
Miami Coach Don Shula told Sports
Illustrated magazine. "Teams have
tried all kinds of schemes against him
' — drop eight men and rush only
three, or blitz everybody, or combin
ations. Pittsburgh tried the combina
tions (in the AFC championship
game). Dan had the answers."

Running back Roger Craig was hardly a pass catcher while at the University of Nebraska, but in only his second season
with the 49ers he has become their top receiver with 71 receptions during the regular season.
Like Montana and almost every
successful quarterback, Marino has
had the benefit of passing and direct
ing his offense from behind a top
notch offensive line. Marino has been
sacked only 13 times in 18 games this
season.
Dolphins guard Roy Foster told the
Peninsula Times Tribune of a chal
lenge he and other linemen face be
cause of Marino's success.
"Defensive lines are hungry to sack
Marino, so they can go back to their
families and say, '1 got him.' There's
no doubt Marino's a marked man in
the NFL, so we take great pride in
keeping them off him."
Another similarity between Marino
and Montana is that their prowess
must include mention of their
receivers. Montana throws to Freddie
Solomon, a former 49er, his favorite
receiver and close friend Dwight
Clark, speedster Renaldo Nehemiah
and his backfield, which includes
Wendell Tyler and underrated Roger
Craig.
Marino's receiving corps is at least
as gifted. His deep threats are the
Marks, Clayton and Duper and veter
ans Nat Moore and Jimmy Cefalo.
Their talents and the Dolphins' pass
ing attack have formed the ideal sys
tem for Marino's arm and release.

Fred Dean is one of the most feared pass rushers in the NFL and the Dolphins
will have to stop him as he stalks Dan Marino.

The second half of the Mark II receiving corps, Mark Clayton, was the Dol
phin's leading receiver with 73 receptions, including a NFL record 18 touch
down catches.
