# QBs key for different reasons
## 
### DAVE DUTCHER Daily staff 
Many have said and written that
the teams in Super Bowl XIX Sunday
are the best in the National Football
League. In other words. Team Cin
derella didn't come to this ball, and

the teams that deserve to be in uni
form at Stanford Stadium are here.
If this widely held contention is
taken for truth, and if one looks for
the best reason why the San Francisco
49ers and the Miami Dolphins are
representing the National Football

Conference and the American Foot
ball Conference, respectively, one
needn't look too far.
It is the position of quarterback
that serves as the hub around which
the Dolphins and the 49ers operate.
However, while both Sunday's start
ing quarterbacks are irreplaceable,
the 49ers Joe Montana and the Dol
phins Dan Marino are for different
reasons.
Montana directs what has been
called — and sometimes sharply
criticized — a finesse offense. He
relies on improvisation and instinct
when plays break down, as evidenced
by the renowned 'The Play," which
defeated Dallas in the NFC champi
onship game in 1982 and preceded
San Francisco's victory in Super Bowl
XVI.
Montana relies less on raw physical
talent than does his counterpart, but
in the 49ers' controlled, short passing
game, execution is primary. In fact,
Montana is quick to admit a physical
inferiority, if you will, to Marino.
At a* press conference Monday
evening, Montana was asked if he
ever yearned to be the quarterback in
the Dolphins' long-bail offense. "I
don't know. I might wear my arm out
real fast," he said. "It's not that
strong to begin with.
"We're two different styles," Mon
tana told the San Francisco
Chronicle. "He (Marino) is much
more the pure passer, where we're
the ball-control type. He's going to
throw the ball down the field a lot.
That's not our intention with this
whole offense."
According to San Francisco Coach
Bill Walsh, Montana also possesses
qualities that separate quarterbacks
from good athletes.

Joe Montana is one of the most mobile and improvisational quarterbacks in the
NFL, making him the best suited player to run the 49er's offense.

Miami's Dan Marino may be the prototypical stand-back-and-shoot quarter
back, but he rarely gets shot down.
