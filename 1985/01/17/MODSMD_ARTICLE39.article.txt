# Coming back not all that important for Walsh
## 
### JOHN LIS Daily staff 
Not only is Sunday's game at Stan
ford Stadium considered a home
game for the San Francisco 49ers, it is
a homecoming of sorts for their head
coach. Bill Walsh. Prior to being
hired by the 49ers on Jan. 9, 1979,
Walsh coached two seasons on the
Farm.
This week, however, Walsh isn't
giving much thought to his ties to
Stanford. "It'll be great if we win and
walking out of the stadium 1 can take
a look around at the campus, but
before that there's no room for sen
timentality," Walsh said at a news
conference Monday. "I won't have
time out there on the field to think
about it. All that matters is that
there's a well-marked field."
Walsh also isn't giving much weight
to a home-field advantage that has
prompted Nevada linesmakers to
make the 49ers three-point favorites,
the margin the home-field is consid
ered to be worth.
"There isn't room to think about
returning to Stanford Stadium or the
game being played in California.
Whether it's at Stanford or in Albe
querque, the field's marked and the
game's the same and you just have to
go out and win it,"he said.
Walsh's two years at the helm of
the then-Cardinals saw him compile a
17-7 record. In 1977 Stanford went
9-3 and defeated Louisiana State in

the Sun Bowl, 24-14, while in 1978
the Cardinals were 8-4, including a
25-22 victory over Georgia in the
Bluebonnet Bowl.
In the six seasons since Walsh left
the Farm, Stanford teams have
posted only one winning season, a 6-5
mark under Paul Wiggin in 1980. The
Cardinal has also not been to a bowl
game since 1978, though a Hall of
Fame Bowl bid in 1982 was lost when
a five-lateral kickoff return resulted
in a 20-19 victory over the University
of California, Berkeley becoming a
25-20 loss and left Stanford at 5-6
that year.
Walsh took over the 49ers with two
years left on his Stanford contract.
Stanford moved quickly to replace
him with his receivers coach, Rod
Dowhower, who went 5-5-1 in 1979
before leaving to become head coach
of the Denver Broncos.
Before joining the 49ers, Walsh
was believed to have been considered
for the head posts with the New York
Giants and the Oakland Raiders, and
the year before that for openings in
Detroit, St. Louis, Buffalo, Chicago
and the Los Angeles Rams. The Oak
land job became available only five
days before he signed with San Fran
cisco when John Madden retired, and
Walsh had been an assistant in Oak
land in 1966.
The now-defunct Palo Alto Times
reported that 49ers owner Edward
De√üartolo Jr. offered Walsh a con

tract for as much as $200,000 a year
and "virtually total authority over the
football operation".
In a 1978 interview with the San
Jose Mercury News, Walsh said, "I'm
not in the process of searching (for a
pro job), but if someone wants to
make you wealthy, what do you do?"
What Walsh did was take over a
team that had gone 2-14 the year
before and lead it to a 26-21 Super-
Bowl victory over the Cincinnati
Bengals in just three years.
Walsh began his coaching career as
a graduate assistant at San Jose State,
from which he graduated in 1954. Tn
1957 he took a Washington Union
High School, Fremont, team that had
gone 1-26 in the three years prior and
led it to a 9-1 mark in just his second
season.
Walsh became defensive coordina
tor at Cal in 1960 and moved across
the Bay to Stanford in 1963 as
recruiting coordinator. He got his
first professional experience with the
Raiders, then joined the newly
formed Cincinnati Bengals, where he
spent eight years as a quarterbacks
and receivers coach. In 1976 he
became offensive coordinator of the
San Diego Chargers, before coming
to Stanford in 1977.
Walsh took a team that hadn't been
to a bowl game in five years and
promptly took the Cardinal to bowls
in both his seasons on the Farm.

San Francisco Coach Bill Walsh will lead "the 49ers into their second Super
Bowl in four years. Walsh's innovative offensive schemes have earned him the
accolade of genius from many critics.
