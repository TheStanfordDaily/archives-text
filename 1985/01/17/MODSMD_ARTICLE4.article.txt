# IRIS attacks computer fears
## 
### MARC PEYSER 
As interest in computers increases here,
the Instruction and Research Information
Systems (IRIS) is working to provide stu
dents and faculty in the humanities with
advice about computer purchase and use.
"We help hundreds of students a week
with advice about buying computers," said
IRIS Director Michael Carter. IRIS
advises students about the best computer
for their needs and continues to provide
technical advice after the purchase.
"We provide both pre- and post
ordering advice," Carter said.
IRIS is also active in helping students
with software. Working with a group called
the Stanford Macintosh Users Group
(SMUG). IRIS is currently placing a distri
bution center in the new LOTS 2 facility,
located in the former bowling alley in
Tresidder Union.
"We're trying to help provide some sup

port to circulate as much 'freeway'
software (software without copyright
limitations) as possible," Carter said. The
plan is to set up a system whereby students
can go to LOTS 2 and copy from a large
collection of software stored on the LOTS
system and onto personal Macintosh disk
ettes.
But IRIS's activities are not limited to
assisting students. The group is currently
working on a program called SMILE
(Stanford Microdisc Instructional Labora
tory Experiment) which would have a spe
cial classroom outfitted with personal com
puters. In such an arrangement, professors
would use the computers as a supplemen
tary teaching method.
"Now, students have to go to Meyer Li
brary and check out a disk," Carter said.
"They don't really have a classroom situa
tion where they are introduced to
software."
A scaled-down version of the program is

currently in use in Green Library for
librarians who are learning how to com
plete a database search. Carter said that
the program has been "conceptually ap
proved" by the board of trustees and
hopes that the project will be in use as
early as the summer of 1986.
"There are still a lot of hoops to jump
through," Carter said.
Aside from programs geared to stu
dents, IRIS has also worked closely with
several groups to bring computer knowl
edge to humanities professors. One of the
most successful of these programs is Tiro, a
two-year joint study sponsored by IBM in
which 160 humanities professors were
given personal computers. An ethnog
rapher will study the effects of the com
puters on the professors' teaching meth
ods.
Closely related to Tiro is the Faculty
Authorship Development Program

(FAD). Created in order to help encour
age faculty members to take advantage of
the personal computer, the program pro
vides consultants to professors who ex
press an interest in developing software for
classroom use.
As a result of a pilot program imple
mented last summer, FAD was instrumen
tal in helping incorporate the computer to
instruct on subjects ranging from France
during the times of Louis XIV to Russian
language drills.
"The feeling is that we want to provide
the faculty with good ideas and a concept
of how to put them into action," said Prof.
Alexander Fetter, chairman of the Com
mittee for Academic Computing and In
formation Systems. "Ideally, when some
one comes up with an idea, we provide a
programmer to design a specific program.
It's cost intensive, but Stanford thinks it's
important."
