# Motto of Super Bowl: Be prepared

### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
Like a troop of Boy Scouts em
barking on their first overnighter.
Stanford planners have approached
Super Bowl XIX with one motto in
mind: Be prepared.
Stanford police beefed up its nor
mally button-down force with more
than 500 people to prepare for any
security encroachments. The Univer
sity spent $2.3 million to prepare the
press box, locker facilities and ticket
booths at Stanford Stadium. The Uni
versity news service prepared a 32-
page press guide to the big game.
Athletic Department officials
prepared more than 8,000 entries for
a student lottery of 100 tickets. And
students have been preparing all
week — preparing to rent our their
rooms, preparing pre-game parties
and preparing to get the hell out of
town for what some consider a raid
rivaled only by Univeristy of Califor
nia, Berkeiey's claiming of The Axe
after a questionable five-lateral kick
off return in 1982.
"We've planned and anticipated
for all the various details and contin
gencies," said Alan Cummings, asso
ciate athletic director and director of
Super Bowl preparations at Stanford.
"The planning is certainly going very
smoothly. I think the NFL (National
Football League) is pleased."
This week, as the two teams,
85,000 ticket-holders and 100 million
television viewers gear up for the
Sunday's kickoff, few will recall that
tht\ actual planning for Stanford's
SupW Bowl began nearly four years
ago. That's when Quentin Kopp, San
Francisco supervisor and now chair
man of the Bay Area Super Bowl
Task Force, first entertained the
prospect of hosting an event that he
claims will pump $80 million to $100
million into the local economv.

Kopp approached Andy Geiger,
director of Stanford's Athletic De
partment, about using Stanford
Stadium — the only facility in the Bay
Area that meets NFL specifications
— as the site for the game. After
nearly two years of negotiations and
lobbying with Stanford and the NFL,
Kopp and the Bay Area were
awarded Super Bowl XIX in Decem
ber, 1983.
Stadium renovations
As a contingency, the NFL re
quested that Stanford make improve
ments to the stadium totaling $1.8
million, of which the league pitched
in $500,000. The University set
about the task of raising the addi
tional $1.3 million: in little more than
a year, donors had contributed $ 1.6
million. Six months later, just in time
for the nine Olympic soccer games
played in Stanford Stadium, $2.3 mil
lion in stadium improvements were
completed.
The permanent improvements in
clude a $500,000 locker room at the
open end of the stadium; a $400,000
complex housing a permanent ticket
office, concession stand and ex
panded restroom facilities; and a
renovated press box.
Some of the temporary additions
brought on by the Super Bowl include
stanchions of lights trained on the
game and the surrounding parking
lots, a new "single-point-of-source"
sound system, two Diamond Vision
instant replay screens, numerous
directional signs pointing the best
route to the stadium. Highway 101,
and Interstate 280 and a general
sprucing up of the areas in and
around the stadium and along the
streets of Palo Alto.

No, the field at Stanford Stadium will have human obstacles on it on Sunday and won't be littered with trucks and
equipment. The stadium has undergone a tremendous amount of renovation for both the Olympics soccer matches and
the Super Bowl.
