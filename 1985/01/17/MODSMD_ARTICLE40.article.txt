# Motto of Super Bowl: Be prepared
## 
### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
Like a troop of Boy Scouts em
barking on their first overnighter.
Stanford planners have approached
Super Bowl XIX with one motto in
mind: Be prepared.
Stanford police beefed up its nor
mally button-down force with more
than 500 people to prepare for any
security encroachments. The Univer
sity spent $2.3 million to prepare the
press box, locker facilities and ticket
booths at Stanford Stadium. The Uni
versity news service prepared a 32-
page press guide to the big game.
Athletic Department officials
prepared more than 8,000 entries for
a student lottery of 100 tickets. And
students have been preparing all
week — preparing to rent our their
rooms, preparing pre-game parties
and preparing to get the hell out of
town for what some consider a raid
rivaled only by Univeristy of Califor
nia, Berkeiey's claiming of The Axe
after a questionable five-lateral kick
off return in 1982.
"We've planned and anticipated
for all the various details and contin
gencies," said Alan Cummings, asso
ciate athletic director and director of
Super Bowl preparations at Stanford.
"The planning is certainly going very
smoothly. I think the NFL (National
Football League) is pleased."
This week, as the two teams,
85,000 ticket-holders and 100 million
television viewers gear up for the
Sunday's kickoff, few will recall that
tht\ actual planning for Stanford's
SupW Bowl began nearly four years
ago. That's when Quentin Kopp, San
Francisco supervisor and now chair
man of the Bay Area Super Bowl
Task Force, first entertained the
prospect of hosting an event that he
claims will pump $80 million to $100
million into the local economv.

Kopp approached Andy Geiger,
director of Stanford's Athletic De
partment, about using Stanford
Stadium — the only facility in the Bay
Area that meets NFL specifications
— as the site for the game. After
nearly two years of negotiations and
lobbying with Stanford and the NFL,
Kopp and the Bay Area were
awarded Super Bowl XIX in Decem
ber, 1983.
Stadium renovations
As a contingency, the NFL re
quested that Stanford make improve
ments to the stadium totaling $1.8
million, of which the league pitched
in $500,000. The University set
about the task of raising the addi
tional $1.3 million: in little more than
a year, donors had contributed $ 1.6
million. Six months later, just in time
for the nine Olympic soccer games
played in Stanford Stadium, $2.3 mil
lion in stadium improvements were
completed.
The permanent improvements in
clude a $500,000 locker room at the
open end of the stadium; a $400,000
complex housing a permanent ticket
office, concession stand and ex
panded restroom facilities; and a
renovated press box.
Some of the temporary additions
brought on by the Super Bowl include
stanchions of lights trained on the
game and the surrounding parking
lots, a new "single-point-of-source"
sound system, two Diamond Vision
instant replay screens, numerous
directional signs pointing the best
route to the stadium. Highway 101,
and Interstate 280 and a general
sprucing up of the areas in and
around the stadium and along the
streets of Palo Alto.

No, the field at Stanford Stadium will have human obstacles on it on Sunday and won't be littered with trucks and
equipment. The stadium has undergone a tremendous amount of renovation for both the Olympics soccer matches and
the Super Bowl.
Benefits to Stanford
Stanford officials say the decision
to host the Super Bowl was basically a
public relations gesture. Cummings
noted that the University will benefit
in a number of ways, both palpable
and intangible, from the glut of media
coverage.
"Stanford University, well known
both nationally and internationally, is
certainly better known because
'dateline Stanford University' is being
talked about across the country," he
said.
University President Donald Ken

nedy, responding to questions in a
recent Faculty Senate meeting, asked,
"What would we look like if we acted
as a dog in the manger when we were
holding on to the only facility in
which this event could he held and
we're surrounded by communities in
the Bay Area that want to bring that
event here for a variety of purposes?"
Nevertheless, despite overtures of
altruism on the part of the University
administration, Stanford will accrue
some economic benefit from hosting
the game. In addition to the stadium
renovations — some of which would
not have happened without the NFL
money, others which occurred years
earlier than expected — the Univer
sity could earn $200,000 to $250,000
from a percentage of concession sales
and the space it rents out for tailgater
parties, according to Cummings.
Palo Alto stands to make approxi
mately $30,000 on the game. Offi

cials there estimate the city will take
in approximately $130,000 from
hotel and sales tax revenue, but will
spend $100,000 in police, fire, traffic,
cleaning and public relations costs.
Taiigater parties
While traditional tailgating
conjures up images of sandwiches and
beer from the back of the family sta
tion wagon, Super Bowl XIX will
feature pre-game parties in tents as
large as football fields, with guest lists
up to 2,000 people and meals catered
by San Francisco's best restaurants.
Each of the 26 corporations spon
soring hospitality parties will pay
Stanford $2,000 to $3,000 for the
right to party on University property.
Some of the largest bashes will be
sponsored by Ford Motor Co., Apple
Computer, Sports Illustrated, Pepsi
Cola and the NFL.

For those fans who don't drink
enough at these pre-game parties,
beer and wine will be available inside
Stanford Stadium for only the second
time in the stadium's history. NFL of
ficials will not permit fans to bring in
their own liquor — a common
practice at college football games —
and instead will sell the spirits from
stadium concessions.
The NFL had wanted to allow
strolling beer vendors to "hawk" the
product throughout the stands, but
the California Department of the Al
coholic Beverage Control (ABC)
ruled last week that liquor conces
sions must be stationary.
"We don't feel it's in the best
public interest to stimulate the sale of
beer," according to an ABC spokes
man.
The NFL expects each Super Bowl
attendee to spend approximately $16
at the souvenir and concession stands.

Tickets
Despite the fact that Super Bowl
XIX is being played in Stanford's
backyard, the best — and in most
cases the only — place for Stanford
students, faculty and staff to see the
contest will be in their living rooms.
The NFL sold the University 1,500
tickets at the $60 face value; the Uni
versity in turn allocated 200 of these
to a student and faculty/staff draw.
About half of those students who
won tickets through this draw indi
cated they would consider scalping
the prize if the price was right, ac
cording to a Daily poll.
Of the remaining 1,300 University
tickets, 1,000 were sold to major
donors to Stanford and the rest were
split among the University's, public
affairs, development and athletic
offices, according to Kennedy.

prospect of hosting an event that he
claims will pump $80 million to $100
million into the local economv.

Kopp approached Andy Geiger,
director of Stanford's Athletic De
partment, about using Stanford
Stadium — the only facility in the Bay
Area that meets NFL specifications
— as the site for the game. After
nearly two years of negotiations and
lobbying with Stanford and the NFL,
Kopp and the Bay Area were
awarded Super Bowl XIX in Decem
ber, 1983.
Stadium renovations
As a contingency, the NFL re
quested that Stanford make improve
ments to the stadium totaling $1.8
million, of which the league pitched
in $500,000. The University set
about the task of raising the addi
tional $1.3 million: in little more than
a year, donors had contributed $ 1.6
million. Six months later, just in time
for the nine Olympic soccer games
played in Stanford Stadium, $2.3 mil
lion in stadium improvements were
completed.
The permanent improvements in
clude a $500,000 locker room at the
open end of the stadium; a $400,000
complex housing a permanent ticket
office, concession stand and ex
panded restroom facilities; and a
renovated press box.
Some of the temporary additions
brought on by the Super Bowl include
stanchions of lights trained on the
game and the surrounding parking
lots, a new "single-point-of-source"
sound system, two Diamond Vision
instant replay screens, numerous
directional signs pointing the best
route to the stadium. Highway 101,
and Interstate 280 and a general
sprucing up of the areas in and
around the stadium and along the
streets of Palo Alto.

No, the field at Stanford Stadium will have human obstacles on it on Sunday and won't be littered with trucks and
equipment. The stadium has undergone a tremendous amount of renovation for both the Olympics soccer matches and
the Super Bowl.
Benefits to Stanford
Stanford officials say the decision
to host the Super Bowl was basically a
public relations gesture. Cummings
noted that the University will benefit
in a number of ways, both palpable
and intangible, from the glut of media
coverage.
"Stanford University, well known
both nationally and internationally, is
certainly better known because
'dateline Stanford University' is being
talked about across the country," he
said.
University President Donald Ken

nedy, responding to questions in a
recent Faculty Senate meeting, asked,
"What would we look like if we acted
as a dog in the manger when we were
holding on to the only facility in
which this event could he held and
we're surrounded by communities in
the Bay Area that want to bring that
event here for a variety of purposes?"
Nevertheless, despite overtures of
altruism on the part of the University
administration, Stanford will accrue
some economic benefit from hosting
the game. In addition to the stadium
renovations — some of which would
not have happened without the NFL
money, others which occurred years
earlier than expected — the Univer
sity could earn $200,000 to $250,000
from a percentage of concession sales
and the space it rents out for tailgater
parties, according to Cummings.
Palo Alto stands to make approxi
mately $30,000 on the game. Offi

cials there estimate the city will take
in approximately $130,000 from
hotel and sales tax revenue, but will
spend $100,000 in police, fire, traffic,
cleaning and public relations costs.
Taiigater parties
While traditional tailgating
conjures up images of sandwiches and
beer from the back of the family sta
tion wagon, Super Bowl XIX will
feature pre-game parties in tents as
large as football fields, with guest lists
up to 2,000 people and meals catered
by San Francisco's best restaurants.
Each of the 26 corporations spon
soring hospitality parties will pay
Stanford $2,000 to $3,000 for the
right to party on University property.
Some of the largest bashes will be
sponsored by Ford Motor Co., Apple
Computer, Sports Illustrated, Pepsi
Cola and the NFL.

For those fans who don't drink
enough at these pre-game parties,
beer and wine will be available inside
Stanford Stadium for only the second
time in the stadium's history. NFL of
ficials will not permit fans to bring in
their own liquor — a common
practice at college football games —
and instead will sell the spirits from
stadium concessions.
The NFL had wanted to allow
strolling beer vendors to "hawk" the
product throughout the stands, but
the California Department of the Al
coholic Beverage Control (ABC)
ruled last week that liquor conces
sions must be stationary.
"We don't feel it's in the best
public interest to stimulate the sale of
beer," according to an ABC spokes
man.
The NFL expects each Super Bowl
attendee to spend approximately $16
at the souvenir and concession stands.

Tickets
Despite the fact that Super Bowl
XIX is being played in Stanford's
backyard, the best — and in most
cases the only — place for Stanford
students, faculty and staff to see the
contest will be in their living rooms.
The NFL sold the University 1,500
tickets at the $60 face value; the Uni
versity in turn allocated 200 of these
to a student and faculty/staff draw.
About half of those students who
won tickets through this draw indi
cated they would consider scalping
the prize if the price was right, ac
cording to a Daily poll.
Of the remaining 1,300 University
tickets, 1,000 were sold to major
donors to Stanford and the rest were
split among the University's, public
affairs, development and athletic
offices, according to Kennedy.
Like a troop of Boy Scouts em
barking on their first overnighter.
Stanford planners have approached
Super Bowl XIX with one motto in
mind: Be prepared.
Stanford police beefed up its nor
mally button-down force with more
than 500 people to prepare for any
security encroachments. The Univer
sity spent $2.3 million to prepare the
press box, locker facilities and ticket
booths at Stanford Stadium. The Uni
versity news service prepared a 32-
page press guide to the big game.
Athletic Department officials
prepared more than 8,000 entries for
a student lottery of 100 tickets. And
students have been preparing all
week — preparing to rent our their
rooms, preparing pre-game parties
and preparing to get the hell out of
town for what some consider a raid
rivaled only by Univeristy of Califor
nia, Berkeiey's claiming of The Axe
after a questionable five-lateral kick
off return in 1982.
"We've planned and anticipated
for all the various details and contin
gencies," said Alan Cummings, asso
ciate athletic director and director of
Super Bowl preparations at Stanford.
"The planning is certainly going very
smoothly. I think the NFL (National
Football League) is pleased."
This week, as the two teams,
85,000 ticket-holders and 100 million
television viewers gear up for the
Sunday's kickoff, few will recall that
tht\ actual planning for Stanford's
SupW Bowl began nearly four years
ago. That's when Quentin Kopp, San
Francisco supervisor and now chair
man of the Bay Area Super Bowl
Task Force, first entertained the
prospect of hosting an event that he
claims will pump $80 million to $100
million into the local economv.
