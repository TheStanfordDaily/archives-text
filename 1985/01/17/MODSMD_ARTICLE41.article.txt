# A 						short lesson on the history of Stanford
## 
### 
When David Starr Jordan arrived
at Stanford in the summer of 1891 to
be the University's first president, he
found the countryside enthralling:
"The Santa Clara Valley," he
wrote in his autobiography, "extends
southward 50 miles and more from
near the head of San Francisco Bay.
Bounding it on the southwest rises . . .
the Sierra de la Santa Cruz — 'a misty
camp of mountains pitched tumultu
ously' ....
"Immediately behind the Univer
sity estate and forming its higher
background is the wooded Sierra
Morena, its cloak of redwood, oaTc
and madrono diversified by thickets
of chemisal ....
"On the east, opposing the green
ridges of the Holy Cross, stretches the
long, relatively barren and treeless
Sierra del Monte Diablo."
In this sheltered area 30 miles
south of San Francisco, its favorable
climate assured by its situation bet'
ween bay and ocean, its meadows
patterned with ancient oaks, Senator
and Mrs. Leland Stanford established
their university on the site of their
suburban home, Palo Alto.

The first parcel, bought in 1876,
consisted of 650 acres along San
Francisquito Creek, and subsequent
purchases ran the total to 8250 acres.
The whole of the Stanfords' land
was given to the University in the
1885 Grant of Endowment with the
stipulation that it should never be
sold.
To this land. Senator Stanford
brought Francis Walker, president of
Massachusetts Institute of Technol
ogy and the prominent landscape ar
chitect, Frederick Law Olmsted, in
the summer of 1886.
They gave serious thought to
locating the campus in the foothills of
the ranch, so as to take advantage of
the magnificent view of the bay, but
they finally decided to drive in a stake
in the grainfields below, at a point
that marks one corner of the Inner
Quadrangle. The senator felt the flat
site was more practical for later ex
pansion.
Olmsted worked out the general
concept for the grounds and the
buildings, but it remained for the
young Boston architect, Charles Al
lerton Coolidge, to develop this con
cept in the style of his late mentor.

Henry Hobbs Richardson, considered
the most eminent architect of his
time.
The style is called Richardsonian
Romanesque, and it follows the
European Romanesque, which is
characterized by rectilinear stone
buildings joined by covered arcasdes
formed of successive half-circle
arches supported by short columns
with decorated capitals.
The inner quad of 12 classroom
buildings— with the central place re
served for the future Memorial
Church — and three engineering
buildings, Encina Hall for men and
Roble Hall for women were ready for
the University's opening on October
1, 1891.
"These long corridors with their
stately pillars," Dr. Jordan said at the
dedication, "will have their part in the
students' training. Each stone in the
quadrangle shall teach its lesson of
grace and genuiness."
President Andrew D. White of
Cornell pronounced the Stanford
buildings the most beautiful college
architecture in America.
But just before five on the morning


Jane Stanford became the dominant force behind the university after
the death of her husband, Leland Sr., in 1893. She died in 1905 in
Hawaii, but the cause of her death was never discovered.
of April 18, 1906, the ground be
neath Stanford's new buildings shook
for 45 seconds. The great earthquake
killed two men on campus and caused
millions of dollars of damage.
The ponderous church tower, with
its clocks, chimes and spire, crashed
into the chancel of Memorial Church,
and the concussion blew out the front
wall. The rose window and the huge
Venetian mosaic of the Sermon on
the Mount that had graced the facade
lay as rubble in the inner quad.
Memorial Arch, the central struc
ture of the outer quad — 100 feet
high and decorated with a frieze de
picting the march of civilization —
was damaged beyond repair. So were
a library and gymnasium that were

just short of completion. None of
these was replaced.
Reconstruction cost more than $2
million. Classes were dismissed until
the fall. Seniors in what has come to
be known as "The Earthquake Class"
were voted their degrees in May.
It was a setback, but only a tem
porary one, for the young university
quickly rebuilt, pursuing a construc
tion project that was begun in 1886
and that has been intermittently con
tinued up to the present.
The construction has taken place
on approximately 5000 acres re
served by the Board of Trustees for
educational uses. This is the heartland
of the Stanford land, comprised for
the most part of the central portion
running from El Camino Real to the
back boundary in the foothills.
The areas designated for light lie in
open land, including the arboretum,
golf course and the foothill lands used


The Earthquake of 1906 did severe damage to the relatively new Stanford campus. These demolished
structures were part of the entry way on Palm Drive and have since been reconstructed.
for space-probing antennae and re
search in nuclear physics and biologi
cal sciences.
The inner and outer quads occupy
17 acres at the heart of the academic
area. The inner quad's 12 classroom
buildings, two of which are now used
by the president and his staff, date
from the time the University opened
in 1891, while the outer quad was
completed in 1903, the same year
that Memorial Church was dedicated.
Buildings in the outer quad are
being brought up to earthquake
proof standards by an "inside-out"
process of construction to preserve
the sandstone exterior,
The church represents the Stan
fords' deep religious faith, though
they were followers of no particular
denomination. In the Founding
Grant, they directed the trustees "to

have taught in the University the im
mortality of the soul, the existence of
an all-wise and benevolent Creator,
and that obedience to His laws is the
highest duty of man."
To serve the widest needs of the
campus community, they decreed that
the church and the University were to
be nonsectarian and at no time tied to
any particular denomination.
In the original plans, the central
site now occupied by the church was
reserved for it, though construction
was deferred. When Senator Stanford
died in 1893, his widow determined
that the church would be built as a
memorial to him.
Mrs. Stanford chose the final de
signs for windows and mosaics,
traveling to Italy to approve the
mosaic sketches, and obtaining papal
permission to copy the Roselli fresco
of the "Last Supper" in the Sistine
Chapel.
The Venetian mosaics which cover
the interior walls are largely Old
Testament, depicting the history of
redemption. The larges mosaic, how
ever, occupies most of the facade of
the church and, with 47 figures, de
picts the Sermon on the Mount.
After the earthquake of 1906, the
structure was completely dismantled
and rebuilt around a steel framework.
Another set of mosaics was brought
from Venice, but the 80-foot spire,
housing clocks and chimes, was never
rebuilt.
The campus landmark, 285-foot
Hoover Tower, was dedicated at the
University's 50th anniversary in
1941. The tower and the adjoining
Lou Henry Hoover Building (opened
in 1967) house the vast documentary
collections of the Hoover Institution
on War, Revolution and Peace —
millions of items that include books,

documents, files, manuscripts, diaries,
pamphlets, posters, maps and photos.
The Herbert Hoover Memorial
Building, completed in 1978, honors
the former president's humanitarian
works.
Across from Hoover Tower sits
Memorial Hall (Auditorium), dedi
cated in 1937. Built primarily through
student contributions as a memorial
to Stanford students and faculty slain
in World War I, the auditorium also
contains in the foyer plaques honor
ing the Stanford dead of World War
11. The main auditorium seats 1,700
and the Little Theater seats 200.
Just south of the quad is White
Memorial Plaza, a 200,000 square
foot landscaped area donated to the
University by Mr. and Mrs. Raymond
White in memory of their sons. The
focal point of the plaza is a tall,
free-form fountain executed in
bronze by San Francisco sculptor
Aristides Demetrios.

When David Starr Jordan arrived
at Stanford in the summer of 1891 to

Morena, its cloak of redwood, oaTc
and madrono diversified by thickets
of chemisal ....
"On the east, opposing the green
ridges of the Holy Cross, stretches the
long, relatively barren and treeless
Sierra del Monte Diablo."
In this sheltered area 30 miles
south of San Francisco, its favorable
climate assured by its situation bet'
ween bay and ocean, its meadows
patterned with ancient oaks, Senator
and Mrs. Leland Stanford established
their university on the site of their
suburban home, Palo Alto.

The first parcel, bought in 1876,
consisted of 650 acres along San
Francisquito Creek, and subsequent
purchases ran the total to 8250 acres.
The whole of the Stanfords' land

They gave serious thought to
locating the campus in the foothills of
the ranch, so as to take advantage of
the magnificent view of the bay, but
they finally decided to drive in a stake
in the grainfields below, at a point
that marks one corner of the Inner
Quadrangle. The senator felt the flat
site was more practical for later ex

ture of the outer quad — 100 feet
high and decorated with a frieze de
picting the march of civilization —
was damaged beyond repair. So were
a library and gymnasium that were

just short of completion. None of
these was replaced.
Reconstruction cost more than $2
million. Classes were dismissed until
the fall. Seniors in what has come to
be known as "The Earthquake Class"
were voted their degrees in May.
It was a setback, but only a tem
porary one, for the young university
quickly rebuilt, pursuing a construc
tion project that was begun in 1886
and that has been intermittently con
tinued up to the present.
The construction has taken place
on approximately 5000 acres re
served by the Board of Trustees for
educational uses. This is the heartland
of the Stanford land, comprised for
the most part of the central portion
running from El Camino Real to the
back boundary in the foothills.
The areas designated for light lie in
open land, including the arboretum,
golf course and the foothill lands used


The Earthquake of 1906 did severe damage to the relatively new Stanford campus. These demolished
structures were part of the entry way on Palm Drive and have since been reconstructed.

The inner and outer quads occupy
17 acres at the heart of the academic
area. The inner quad's 12 classroom
buildings, two of which are now used
by the president and his staff, date
from the time the University opened
in 1891, while the outer quad was
completed in 1903, the same year
that Memorial Church was dedicated.
Buildings in the outer quad are
being brought up to earthquake
proof standards by an "inside-out"
process of construction to preserve
the sandstone exterior,
The church represents the Stan
fords' deep religious faith, though
they were followers of no particular
denomination. In the Founding
Grant, they directed the trustees "to

have taught in the University the im
mortality of the soul, the existence of
an all-wise and benevolent Creator,
and that obedience to His laws is the
highest duty of man."
To serve the widest needs of the
campus community, they decreed that
the church and the University were to
be nonsectarian and at no time tied to
any particular denomination.
In the original plans, the central
site now occupied by the church was
reserved for it, though construction
was deferred. When Senator Stanford
died in 1893, his widow determined
that the church would be built as a
memorial to him.
Mrs. Stanford chose the final de
signs for windows and mosaics,
traveling to Italy to approve the
mosaic sketches, and obtaining papal
permission to copy the Roselli fresco
of the "Last Supper" in the Sistine
Chapel.
The Venetian mosaics which cover
the interior walls are largely Old
Testament, depicting the history of
redemption. The larges mosaic, how
ever, occupies most of the facade of
the church and, with 47 figures, de
picts the Sermon on the Mount.
After the earthquake of 1906, the
structure was completely dismantled
and rebuilt around a steel framework.
Another set of mosaics was brought
from Venice, but the 80-foot spire,
housing clocks and chimes, was never
rebuilt.
The campus landmark, 285-foot
Hoover Tower, was dedicated at the
University's 50th anniversary in
1941. The tower and the adjoining
Lou Henry Hoover Building (opened
in 1967) house the vast documentary
collections of the Hoover Institution
on War, Revolution and Peace —
millions of items that include books,

documents, files, manuscripts, diaries,
pamphlets, posters, maps and photos.
The Herbert Hoover Memorial
Building, completed in 1978, honors
the former president's humanitarian
works.
Across from Hoover Tower sits
Memorial Hall (Auditorium), dedi
cated in 1937. Built primarily through
student contributions as a memorial
to Stanford students and faculty slain
in World War I, the auditorium also
contains in the foyer plaques honor
ing the Stanford dead of World War
11. The main auditorium seats 1,700
and the Little Theater seats 200.
Just south of the quad is White
Memorial Plaza, a 200,000 square
foot landscaped area donated to the
University by Mr. and Mrs. Raymond
White in memory of their sons. The
focal point of the plaza is a tall,
free-form fountain executed in
bronze by San Francisco sculptor
Aristides Demetrios.
