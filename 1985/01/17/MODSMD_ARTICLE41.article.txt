						short lesson on the history of Stanford
## 
### 
When David Starr Jordan arrived
at Stanford in the summer of 1891 to
be the University's first president, he
found the countryside enthralling:
"The Santa Clara Valley," he
wrote in his autobiography, "extends
southward 50 miles and more from
near the head of San Francisco Bay.
Bounding it on the southwest rises . . .
the Sierra de la Santa Cruz — 'a misty
camp of mountains pitched tumultu
ously' ....
"Immediately behind the Univer
sity estate and forming its higher
background is the wooded Sierra
Morena, its cloak of redwood, oaTc
and madrono diversified by thickets
of chemisal ....
"On the east, opposing the green
ridges of the Holy Cross, stretches the
long, relatively barren and treeless
Sierra del Monte Diablo."
In this sheltered area 30 miles
south of San Francisco, its favorable
climate assured by its situation bet'
ween bay and ocean, its meadows
patterned with ancient oaks, Senator
and Mrs. Leland Stanford established
their university on the site of their
suburban home, Palo Alto.

The first parcel, bought in 1876,
consisted of 650 acres along San
Francisquito Creek, and subsequent
purchases ran the total to 8250 acres.
The whole of the Stanfords' land
was given to the University in the
1885 Grant of Endowment with the
stipulation that it should never be
sold.
To this land. Senator Stanford
brought Francis Walker, president of
Massachusetts Institute of Technol
ogy and the prominent landscape ar
chitect, Frederick Law Olmsted, in
the summer of 1886.
They gave serious thought to
locating the campus in the foothills of
the ranch, so as to take advantage of
the magnificent view of the bay, but
they finally decided to drive in a stake
in the grainfields below, at a point
that marks one corner of the Inner
Quadrangle. The senator felt the flat
site was more practical for later ex
pansion.
Olmsted worked out the general
concept for the grounds and the
buildings, but it remained for the
young Boston architect, Charles Al
lerton Coolidge, to develop this con
cept in the style of his late mentor.

Henry Hobbs Richardson, considered
the most eminent architect of his
time.
The style is called Richardsonian
Romanesque, and it follows the
European Romanesque, which is
characterized by rectilinear stone
buildings joined by covered arcasdes
formed of successive half-circle
arches supported by short columns
with decorated capitals.
The inner quad of 12 classroom
buildings— with the central place re
served for the future Memorial
Church — and three engineering
buildings, Encina Hall for men and
Roble Hall for women were ready for
the University's opening on October
1, 1891.
"These long corridors with their
stately pillars," Dr. Jordan said at the
dedication, "will have their part in the
students' training. Each stone in the
quadrangle shall teach its lesson of
grace and genuiness."
President Andrew D. White of
Cornell pronounced the Stanford
buildings the most beautiful college
architecture in America.
But just before five on the morning


Jane Stanford became the dominant force behind the university after
the death of her husband, Leland Sr., in 1893. She died in 1905 in
Hawaii, but the cause of her death was never discovered.
