A visit to the Bay Area is incomplete
without visiting some of the more
popular tourist spots in the City.
Listed below are San Francisco's most
famous attractions
Just remember: No matter how
warm it is here, it's probably con
siderably cooler in San Francisco, so
dress warmly.
And take a camera.
Alcatraz — Known as "The Rock,"
Alcatraz claims most of its fame from
the time that it was a Devil Island
style federal penitentiary which
housed such notable criminals as The
Bird Man and A 1 Capone. The island
also has been used as a fortification, a
U.S. military prison, an Army dis
ciplinary barracks and a Native
American stronghold. The National
Park Service conducts two-hour tours
from the waterfront, but be warned
that this is one of the City's most
popular attractions and reservations
are hard to Sfecure.
Cable Cars — Back in operation
after an 18-month hiatus. To many
San Franciscans, the cars are more
than a means of transportation:
They're a way of life.
Bank of America World
Headquarters — The Bank of
America complex occupies an entire
downtown block, complete with a
formal plaza dominated by a black
granite sculpture know locally as
"The Banker's Heart." completed in
1969, thousand of movie-goers wit
nessed an early demise of the Bank of
America building in the movie. The
Towering Inferno.
California Palace of the Legion of
Honor — The Palace, perched close
to Land's End in the western part of
the City, houses an extensive collec
tion of Rodin bronzes including The
Thinker.
The Cannery — A defunct Del
Monte cannery transformed into a
galleria of shops and restaurants. The
Cannery continues the Ghirardelli
tradition of urban redevelopment.
Mimes and musicians perform regu
larly in the complex's square.

Chinatown — A long-time resident
erf Hong Kong once said that San
Francisco's Chinatown reminded him
of home — the rush-hour traffic jams
on the main thoroughfare , Grant
Avenue, rivaled any bicycle or auto
mobile tie-up a Chinese city could
muster. But Grant Avenue also offers
a kaleidoscope of Asian delights —
dim sum bars, restaurants, phar

macies displaying pickled snake,
people inspecting the Chinese
cabbage in front of grocery stores
while pressed ducks hang in the win
dows. The streets radiating out from
Grant Avenue house one of the larg
est Chinese populations outside of
China and afford plenty of opportuni
ties for exploring.
Civic Center — After the 1906

earthquake and fire, the city planners
wanted to remake the town into a
modern Athens. The Civic Center is
only a small part of the elaborate
complex planned. San Franciscans
boast that City Hall, with its orna
mented dome, gargoyled finials and
marble balustrade, is the finest exam
ple of French Romanesque architec
ture outside of Europe. The elaborate

federal and state office buildings.
Civic Auditorium, Brooks Exhibit
Hall, Public Library and Performing
Art Center echo this traditional
theme. The glass and concrete Louise
M. Davies Symphony Hall is a
modern departure.
Coit Tower/Telegraph Hill — The
Bohemian section of San Francisco,

me in San Francisco" fame, lead thousand in celebrating the return of
the City's cable cars this summer.
the circuitous streets and cliffhanging
houses of Telegraph Hill, has been in
habited by successive generations of
flower children, artists and literati.
The upper area around Coit Tower, a
monument to the city's early volun
teer firefighters, has developed into a
patchwork of posh apartments.
Ferry building — In the days
before rush-hour traffic clogged the
Bay and Golden Gate Bridges, the
ferry building annually processed
more than 50 million commuters
from the East Bay and Marin County.
Today, a Bay Bridge approach
obscures this monument at the foot of
Market Street. Although the Golden
Gate Ferry operates out of its south
side, most of the building is now used
as office space.
Fisherman's Wharf — Salty fisher
men, seagulls and the pungent smell
of freshly cleaned fish once
dominated San Francisco's wharf. Al
though the nearby slips still berth
trawlers, the surrounding wharf area
has been taken over by wax
museaums, carnival-type rides and
tourist shops. Yet the 19th century
old days, and some of the City's best
restaurants are sitll to be found along
"The Wharf."
Fort Point — This three-tiered
brick fort at one time held vigil over

the Golden GAte Hgainst invaders.
Now dwarfed by the Golden Gate
Bridge, the building has been made a
national historic site. Tours are con
ducted between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m.
49 Mile Drive — This half-day tour
is a planned drive through the most
famous landmarks of the City. An ex
cellent introduction to San Francisco,
the route starts on Van Ness Avenue
at the Civic Center and is clearly
marked by blue and white seagull
signs.
George R. Moscone Convention
Center — A $126 million affirmation
that San Francisco is indeed a tourist
town. The site for this summer's
Democratic National Convention,
Moscone Center houses an exhibit
hall, 41 meeting rooms, a ballroom
and a special events theater. The
facility is named after the late mayor
of San Francisco, who was assas
sinated.
Ghirardelli Square — Here is
where 19th-century laborers once
made chocolate, packaged spices and
wove fine woolens. Twentieth
century visitors to Ghirardelli Square
now browne in the Mustard Building,
watch streeet performers in the plaza
next to the Woolen Building and buy
Ghirardelli (pronounced Gear-ar
dely) chocolate in the old Chocolate
Building. The brick buildings of the
old factory were restored in 1962,
setting an example for urban
reclamation all over the world.
Golden Gate Bridge — Visitors are

often disappointed to discover the
bridge is not so-named because it is
painted gold but because the sun sets
in the Golden Gate . .. but not al
ways. At night, the light that il
luminate the bridge are gold (yellow)
in color. The Gate is often "socked
in" by fog, to the dismay of tourists
dressed for California sun.
Japan Town/Center — Japan Cen
ter and the revitalized Japan Town
join to create a mecca for the
thousands of Japanese businessmen
and tourests who visit San Francisco
each year. The complex of hotels,
theaters, shops and restaurants offer
some of the best saimen noodles and
electronic goods this side of the
Pacific.
Lombard Street — This twister
descends Russian Hill from Hyde
Street, with 10 hairpin turns in a
single block. Constructed, some say,
by a mischievous city planner, the
street now terrifies student drivers all
over the city.
Mission Delores — Father Junipero
Serra founded this mission in 1776 as
part of Spain's colonization effort in
the New World. During his lifetime,
this Franciscan missionary started a
whole chain of missions stretching
along El Camino Real — "The King's
Highway" — all they to Baja, Cali
fornia.
Nob Hill — The exclusive Com
monwealth Club, the lavish Fairmont
Hotel, the Huntington Hotel, four-

star restaurant Alexis and apartment
with rents as spectacular as their
views. All these attract San Fran
cisco's glitterati to Nob Hill, one of
the City's most elegant spots.
Old Mint — Though it was phased
out of operation in 1937, the Old
Mint was revamped and reopened as
a museum in 1973.1ts exhibits include
period rooms, a pyramid of gold bars.
Old West artifacts, the mint's Special
Coins and Metals Division and mone
tary treasures of all kinds.
The Palace of Fine Arts — Created
as the diadem of the 1915 Pacific Ex
position, a central rotunda embracing
a Corinthian colonnade ornamented
with friezes and statuary constitute
the Palace. By the 19505, these
original plaster structures had been
reduced to ruins by the winds sweep

ing through the Golden Gate. During
the '60s, a sentimental movement
mobilized to have the monument
restored in pre-cast concrete. The
supporting buildings now house the
Exploratorium, a "hands-on" science
museum.
Pier 39 — Pier 39 surrounds its
mall of shops and restaurants with the
trappings of a turn-of-the-century
street scene.
Polk Street — In the presuper
market era, this avenue once sup
ported a posh shopping district cater
ing to the well-to-do residents of
Russian Hill and Nob Hill. Bath
houses and gay activists have since
supplanted the fur-coated housewives
and chic shops. Though the shops
have changed with local tastes and
demands, many fashionable
boutiques and gourmet restaurants
still line Polk Street.
Twin Peaks — A cliche necking
and drinking hangout Friday and Sat
urday nights. Twin Peaks offers an
intoxicating vista of the Bay Area

from the Marin headlands to the
Santa Clara Valley. During the day, a
drive around the figure-eight road
that collars the peaks is an excellent
way to get your bearing on a first trip.
Union Square — This is San Fran
cisco's Fifth Avenue. Some of the
City's most swank shops and hotels —
I. Magnin's (complete with a marble
paneled, gold- fixtured bathroom),
Saks Fifth Avenue, the Hotel St.
Francis, Elizabeth Arden's — front
the square of the nearby streets.
Washington Square — Schoolgirls
coming out of a confession in the ad
jacent Church of Saints Peter and
Paul, grandfathers feeding the
pigeons and hucksters from the red
light district on nearby Broadway all
circulate through the piazza of San
Francisco's "Little Italy," the North
Beach district. After gorging on pasta
in one of the excellent are cafes, visit
Washington Square to digest your
meal and soak up some of the local
color.

Park Service conducts two-hour tours
from the waterfront, but be warned
that this is one of the City's most
popular attractions and reservations

Cable Cars — Back in operation
after an 18-month hiatus. To many
San Franciscans, the cars are more
than a means of transportation:
They're a way of life.
Bank of America World
Headquarters — The Bank of
America complex occupies an entire
downtown block, complete with a
formal plaza dominated by a black
granite sculpture know locally as

Chinatown — A long-time resident
erf Hong Kong once said that San
Francisco's Chinatown reminded him
of home — the rush-hour traffic jams
on the main thoroughfare , Grant
Avenue, rivaled any bicycle or auto
mobile tie-up a Chinese city could
muster. But Grant Avenue also offers
a kaleidoscope of Asian delights —
dim sum bars, restaurants, phar

macies displaying pickled snake,
people inspecting the Chinese
cabbage in front of grocery stores
while pressed ducks hang in the win
dows. The streets radiating out from
Grant Avenue house one of the larg
est Chinese populations outside of
China and afford plenty of opportuni
ties for exploring.
Civic Center — After the 1906

earthquake and fire, the city planners
wanted to remake the town into a
modern Athens. The Civic Center is
only a small part of the elaborate
complex planned. San Franciscans
boast that City Hall, with its orna
mented dome, gargoyled finials and
marble balustrade, is the finest exam
ple of French Romanesque architec
ture outside of Europe. The elaborate

federal and state office buildings.
Civic Auditorium, Brooks Exhibit

houses of Telegraph Hill, has been in
habited by successive generations of
flower children, artists and literati.
The upper area around Coit Tower, a
monument to the city's early volun
teer firefighters, has developed into a
patchwork of posh apartments.
Ferry building — In the days
before rush-hour traffic clogged the
Bay and Golden Gate Bridges, the
ferry building annually processed
more than 50 million commuters
from the East Bay and Marin County.
Today, a Bay Bridge approach
obscures this monument at the foot of
Market Street. Although the Golden
Gate Ferry operates out of its south
side, most of the building is now used
as office space.
Fisherman's Wharf — Salty fisher
men, seagulls and the pungent smell
of freshly cleaned fish once
dominated San Francisco's wharf. Al
though the nearby slips still berth
trawlers, the surrounding wharf area
has been taken over by wax
museaums, carnival-type rides and
tourist shops. Yet the 19th century
old days, and some of the City's best
restaurants are sitll to be found along
"The Wharf."
Fort Point — This three-tiered
brick fort at one time held vigil over

facility is named after the late mayor
of San Francisco, who was assas
sinated.
Ghirardelli Square — Here is
where 19th-century laborers once
made chocolate, packaged spices and
wove fine woolens. Twentieth
century visitors to Ghirardelli Square
now browne in the Mustard Building,
watch streeet performers in the plaza
next to the Woolen Building and buy
Ghirardelli (pronounced Gear-ar
dely) chocolate in the old Chocolate
Building. The brick buildings of the
old factory were restored in 1962,
setting an example for urban
reclamation all over the world.
Golden Gate Bridge — Visitors are

often disappointed to discover the
bridge is not so-named because it is
painted gold but because the sun sets
in the Golden Gate . .. but not al
ways. At night, the light that il
luminate the bridge are gold (yellow)
in color. The Gate is often "socked
in" by fog, to the dismay of tourists
dressed for California sun.
Japan Town/Center — Japan Cen
ter and the revitalized Japan Town
join to create a mecca for the
thousands of Japanese businessmen
and tourests who visit San Francisco
each year. The complex of hotels,
theaters, shops and restaurants offer
some of the best saimen noodles and
electronic goods this side of the
Pacific.
Lombard Street — This twister
descends Russian Hill from Hyde
Street, with 10 hairpin turns in a
single block. Constructed, some say,
by a mischievous city planner, the
street now terrifies student drivers all
over the city.
Mission Delores — Father Junipero
Serra founded this mission in 1776 as

Mint was revamped and reopened as
a museum in 1973.1ts exhibits include
period rooms, a pyramid of gold bars.
Old West artifacts, the mint's Special
Coins and Metals Division and mone
tary treasures of all kinds.
The Palace of Fine Arts — Created
as the diadem of the 1915 Pacific Ex
position, a central rotunda embracing
a Corinthian colonnade ornamented
with friezes and statuary constitute
the Palace. By the 19505, these
original plaster structures had been
reduced to ruins by the winds sweep

ing through the Golden Gate. During
the '60s, a sentimental movement
mobilized to have the monument
restored in pre-cast concrete. The
supporting buildings now house the
Exploratorium, a "hands-on" science
museum.
Pier 39 — Pier 39 surrounds its
mall of shops and restaurants with the
trappings of a turn-of-the-century
street scene.
Polk Street — In the presuper
market era, this avenue once sup
ported a posh shopping district cater

Russian Hill and Nob Hill. Bath
houses and gay activists have since
supplanted the fur-coated housewives
and chic shops. Though the shops
have changed with local tastes and
demands, many fashionable
boutiques and gourmet restaurants
still line Polk Street.
Twin Peaks — A cliche necking
and drinking hangout Friday and Sat
urday nights. Twin Peaks offers an
intoxicating vista of the Bay Area

from the Marin headlands to the
Santa Clara Valley. During the day, a
drive around the figure-eight road
that collars the peaks is an excellent
way to get your bearing on a first trip.
Union Square — This is San Fran
cisco's Fifth Avenue. Some of the
City's most swank shops and hotels —
I. Magnin's (complete with a marble
paneled, gold- fixtured bathroom),
Saks Fifth Avenue, the Hotel St.
Francis, Elizabeth Arden's — front
the square of the nearby streets.
Washington Square — Schoolgirls
coming out of a confession in the ad
jacent Church of Saints Peter and
Paul, grandfathers feeding the
pigeons and hucksters from the red
light district on nearby Broadway all
circulate through the piazza of San
Francisco's "Little Italy," the North
Beach district. After gorging on pasta
in one of the excellent are cafes, visit
Washington Square to digest your
meal and soak up some of the local
color.

Alcatraz — Known as "The Rock,"
Alcatraz claims most of its fame from
the time that it was a Devil Island
style federal penitentiary which
housed such notable criminals as The
Bird Man and A 1 Capone. The island
also has been used as a fortification, a
U.S. military prison, an Army dis

to Land's End in the western part of
the City, houses an extensive collec
tion of Rodin bronzes including The
Thinker.
The Cannery — A defunct Del
Monte cannery transformed into a
galleria of shops and restaurants. The
Cannery continues the Ghirardelli
tradition of urban redevelopment.
Mimes and musicians perform regu
larly in the complex's square.

Chinatown — A long-time resident
erf Hong Kong once said that San
Francisco's Chinatown reminded him
of home — the rush-hour traffic jams
on the main thoroughfare , Grant
Avenue, rivaled any bicycle or auto
mobile tie-up a Chinese city could
muster. But Grant Avenue also offers
a kaleidoscope of Asian delights —
dim sum bars, restaurants, phar

macies displaying pickled snake,
people inspecting the Chinese
cabbage in front of grocery stores
while pressed ducks hang in the win
dows. The streets radiating out from
Grant Avenue house one of the larg
est Chinese populations outside of
China and afford plenty of opportuni
ties for exploring.
Civic Center — After the 1906

earthquake and fire, the city planners
wanted to remake the town into a
modern Athens. The Civic Center is
only a small part of the elaborate
complex planned. San Franciscans
boast that City Hall, with its orna
mented dome, gargoyled finials and
marble balustrade, is the finest exam
ple of French Romanesque architec
ture outside of Europe. The elaborate

federal and state office buildings.
Civic Auditorium, Brooks Exhibit
Hall, Public Library and Performing
Art Center echo this traditional
theme. The glass and concrete Louise
M. Davies Symphony Hall is a
modern departure.
Coit Tower/Telegraph Hill — The

me in San Francisco" fame, lead thousand in celebrating the return of
the City's cable cars this summer.
the circuitous streets and cliffhanging
houses of Telegraph Hill, has been in
habited by successive generations of
flower children, artists and literati.
The upper area around Coit Tower, a
monument to the city's early volun
teer firefighters, has developed into a
patchwork of posh apartments.
Ferry building — In the days
before rush-hour traffic clogged the
Bay and Golden Gate Bridges, the
ferry building annually processed
more than 50 million commuters
from the East Bay and Marin County.
Today, a Bay Bridge approach
obscures this monument at the foot of
Market Street. Although the Golden
Gate Ferry operates out of its south
side, most of the building is now used
as office space.
Fisherman's Wharf — Salty fisher
men, seagulls and the pungent smell
of freshly cleaned fish once
dominated San Francisco's wharf. Al
though the nearby slips still berth
trawlers, the surrounding wharf area
has been taken over by wax
museaums, carnival-type rides and
tourist shops. Yet the 19th century
old days, and some of the City's best
restaurants are sitll to be found along
"The Wharf."
Fort Point — This three-tiered
brick fort at one time held vigil over

the Golden GAte Hgainst invaders.
Now dwarfed by the Golden Gate
Bridge, the building has been made a
national historic site. Tours are con
ducted between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m.

and a special events theater. The
facility is named after the late mayor
of San Francisco, who was assas
sinated.
Ghirardelli Square — Here is
where 19th-century laborers once
made chocolate, packaged spices and
wove fine woolens. Twentieth
century visitors to Ghirardelli Square
now browne in the Mustard Building,
watch streeet performers in the plaza
next to the Woolen Building and buy
Ghirardelli (pronounced Gear-ar
dely) chocolate in the old Chocolate
Building. The brick buildings of the
old factory were restored in 1962,
setting an example for urban
reclamation all over the world.
Golden Gate Bridge — Visitors are

often disappointed to discover the
bridge is not so-named because it is
painted gold but because the sun sets
in the Golden Gate . .. but not al
ways. At night, the light that il
luminate the bridge are gold (yellow)
in color. The Gate is often "socked
in" by fog, to the dismay of tourists
dressed for California sun.
Japan Town/Center — Japan Cen
ter and the revitalized Japan Town
join to create a mecca for the
thousands of Japanese businessmen
and tourests who visit San Francisco
each year. The complex of hotels,
theaters, shops and restaurants offer
some of the best saimen noodles and
electronic goods this side of the
Pacific.
Lombard Street — This twister
descends Russian Hill from Hyde
Street, with 10 hairpin turns in a
single block. Constructed, some say,
by a mischievous city planner, the
street now terrifies student drivers all
over the city.
Mission Delores — Father Junipero
Serra founded this mission in 1776 as
part of Spain's colonization effort in
the New World. During his lifetime,

views. All these attract San Fran
cisco's glitterati to Nob Hill, one of
the City's most elegant spots.
Old Mint — Though it was phased
out of operation in 1937, the Old
Mint was revamped and reopened as
a museum in 1973.1ts exhibits include
period rooms, a pyramid of gold bars.
Old West artifacts, the mint's Special
Coins and Metals Division and mone
tary treasures of all kinds.
The Palace of Fine Arts — Created
as the diadem of the 1915 Pacific Ex
position, a central rotunda embracing
a Corinthian colonnade ornamented
with friezes and statuary constitute
the Palace. By the 19505, these
original plaster structures had been
reduced to ruins by the winds sweep

ing through the Golden Gate. During
the '60s, a sentimental movement
mobilized to have the monument
restored in pre-cast concrete. The
supporting buildings now house the
Exploratorium, a "hands-on" science
museum.
Pier 39 — Pier 39 surrounds its
mall of shops and restaurants with the
trappings of a turn-of-the-century
street scene.
Polk Street — In the presuper
market era, this avenue once sup
ported a posh shopping district cater
ing to the well-to-do residents of
Russian Hill and Nob Hill. Bath
houses and gay activists have since
supplanted the fur-coated housewives
and chic shops. Though the shops
have changed with local tastes and
demands, many fashionable
boutiques and gourmet restaurants
still line Polk Street.
Twin Peaks — A cliche necking
and drinking hangout Friday and Sat
urday nights. Twin Peaks offers an
intoxicating vista of the Bay Area

from the Marin headlands to the
Santa Clara Valley. During the day, a
drive around the figure-eight road
that collars the peaks is an excellent
way to get your bearing on a first trip.
Union Square — This is San Fran
cisco's Fifth Avenue. Some of the
City's most swank shops and hotels —
I. Magnin's (complete with a marble
paneled, gold- fixtured bathroom),
Saks Fifth Avenue, the Hotel St.
Francis, Elizabeth Arden's — front
the square of the nearby streets.
Washington Square — Schoolgirls
coming out of a confession in the ad
jacent Church of Saints Peter and
Paul, grandfathers feeding the
pigeons and hucksters from the red
light district on nearby Broadway all
circulate through the piazza of San
Francisco's "Little Italy," the North
Beach district. After gorging on pasta
in one of the excellent are cafes, visit
Washington Square to digest your
meal and soak up some of the local
color.
A visit to the Bay Area is incomplete
without visiting some of the more
popular tourist spots in the City.
Listed below are San Francisco's most
famous attractions
Just remember: No matter how
warm it is here, it's probably con
siderably cooler in San Francisco, so
dress warmly.
And take a camera.
Alcatraz — Known as "The Rock,"
Alcatraz claims most of its fame from
the time that it was a Devil Island
style federal penitentiary which
housed such notable criminals as The
Bird Man and A 1 Capone. The island
also has been used as a fortification, a
U.S. military prison, an Army dis
ciplinary barracks and a Native
American stronghold. The National
Park Service conducts two-hour tours
from the waterfront, but be warned
that this is one of the City's most
popular attractions and reservations
are hard to Sfecure.
Cable Cars — Back in operation
after an 18-month hiatus. To many
San Franciscans, the cars are more
than a means of transportation:
They're a way of life.
Bank of America World
Headquarters — The Bank of
America complex occupies an entire
downtown block, complete with a
formal plaza dominated by a black
granite sculpture know locally as
"The Banker's Heart." completed in
1969, thousand of movie-goers wit
