A visit to the Bay Area is incomplete
without visiting some of the more
popular tourist spots in the City.
Listed below are San Francisco's most
famous attractions
Just remember: No matter how
warm it is here, it's probably con
siderably cooler in San Francisco, so
dress warmly.
And take a camera.
Alcatraz — Known as "The Rock,"
Alcatraz claims most of its fame from
the time that it was a Devil Island
style federal penitentiary which
housed such notable criminals as The
Bird Man and A 1 Capone. The island
also has been used as a fortification, a
U.S. military prison, an Army dis
ciplinary barracks and a Native
American stronghold. The National
Park Service conducts two-hour tours
from the waterfront, but be warned
that this is one of the City's most
popular attractions and reservations
are hard to Sfecure.
Cable Cars — Back in operation
after an 18-month hiatus. To many
San Franciscans, the cars are more
than a means of transportation:
They're a way of life.
Bank of America World
Headquarters — The Bank of
America complex occupies an entire
downtown block, complete with a
formal plaza dominated by a black
granite sculpture know locally as
"The Banker's Heart." completed in
1969, thousand of movie-goers wit
nessed an early demise of the Bank of
America building in the movie. The
Towering Inferno.
California Palace of the Legion of
Honor — The Palace, perched close
to Land's End in the western part of
the City, houses an extensive collec
tion of Rodin bronzes including The
Thinker.
The Cannery — A defunct Del
Monte cannery transformed into a
galleria of shops and restaurants. The
Cannery continues the Ghirardelli
tradition of urban redevelopment.
Mimes and musicians perform regu
larly in the complex's square.

Chinatown — A long-time resident
erf Hong Kong once said that San
Francisco's Chinatown reminded him
of home — the rush-hour traffic jams
on the main thoroughfare , Grant
Avenue, rivaled any bicycle or auto
mobile tie-up a Chinese city could
muster. But Grant Avenue also offers
a kaleidoscope of Asian delights —
dim sum bars, restaurants, phar

macies displaying pickled snake,
people inspecting the Chinese
cabbage in front of grocery stores
while pressed ducks hang in the win
dows. The streets radiating out from
Grant Avenue house one of the larg
est Chinese populations outside of
China and afford plenty of opportuni
ties for exploring.
Civic Center — After the 1906

earthquake and fire, the city planners
wanted to remake the town into a
modern Athens. The Civic Center is
only a small part of the elaborate
complex planned. San Franciscans
boast that City Hall, with its orna
mented dome, gargoyled finials and
marble balustrade, is the finest exam
ple of French Romanesque architec
ture outside of Europe. The elaborate

federal and state office buildings.
Civic Auditorium, Brooks Exhibit
Hall, Public Library and Performing
Art Center echo this traditional
theme. The glass and concrete Louise
M. Davies Symphony Hall is a
modern departure.
Coit Tower/Telegraph Hill — The
Bohemian section of San Francisco,


Balladeer Tony Bennett, of "I Left My Heart in San Francisco" tame
and San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein, of "Walter Mondale left

Rod Searcey/Daily file
me in San Francisco" fame, lead thousand in celebrating the return of
the City's cable cars this summer.
