# Dining in the Palo Alto style
## 
### 
Breakfast. Morning eaters are lucky
here — Palo Alto and Menlo Park
have a plethora of good restaurants
that specialize in breakfast and lunch.
First among equals is Late for the
Train (8561 Oak Grove Ave., Menlo
Park, near the train station), a folksy
place that makes great omelettes,
divine blintzes and fruit pancakes,
and the usual salads and sandwiches,
plus ever-changing desserts. If you go
on a weekend, particularly a Sunday,

expect at least a 45-minute wait; it's
best, if you can, to go for an early or
late weekday lunch, when you can of
ten be seated immediately. Modeled
along much the same lines is Hohee's
Haven (4224 El Camino Real, Palo
Alto, and Town and Country Vil
lage), a family operation with more
branches down the peninsula.
Hobee's follows more traditional
American breakfast lines — sausage,
eggs, ham — but isn't lacking for
fresh-squeezed juices, fruit, and other
California trimmings, and it has a
truly addictive coffee cake that comes
with most of the breakfasts. The

Farmer's Market (448 California
Ave., Palo Alto) has a small menu,
spotty service (semi-cafeteria style)
and the ambiance of a butcher shop,
but it serves great breakfasts (try the
apple pancakes or a ham-swiss-apple
omelette) at amazingly low prices.
(The latter isn't always true on
weekends, when you may find your
self ordering a "brunch" at inflated
prices). Finally, there's the favorite
morning meeting spot of Stanford
sororities: Dinah's Poolside Coffee
Shop (4269 El Camino Real, Palo
Alto; not to be confused with Dinah's
Shack, a mediocre restaurant next
door), which many people feel has
the best omelettes in the area.
Where the Cardinal flocks. Stanford
hangouts change from year to year, of
course, and I'm sure the newest ones
have escaped my attention, but there
are old standards. Half the people in
Ramona's on any given weekend
night will be from Stanford; the Stan
ford crush is particularly intense
before and after basketball games.
Most of them will be eating the
second-best pizza in the area,
while those who want to be
different chew on Calzone or decent
hamburgers. The once-great
Ramona's salad bar maintains only a
shade of its former glory. Down the
street at the Good Earth Restaurant
(185 University Ave., Palo Alto)
you'll find a different, slightly older,
Stanford crowd eating chic health
food. Of course, hangouts in the true
Stanford sense of the word are places
you go to swill beer, and there are a
couple of those: The Dutch Goose
(3567 Alameda de las Pulgas, Menlo
Park), a functional sort of place
where there's standing room only on
Senior Pub Nights, and The Oasis
Beer Garden (241 El Camino Real,
Menlo Park), a downright ugly place
that has been witness to untold
decades of Stanford history. Two
things you have to know: refer to
them as "the Goose" and"the O,"
respectively; and rest assured that
you will be carded at both establish

merits. If you like your nightlife a bit
rowdier, try St. James Infirmary (390
Moffet Blvd., Mountain View) or
Antonio's Nut House (321 California
Ave., Palo Alto), places where you
can get into a fight if you try hard
enough. In recent years an attempt
has been made to turn The Lan
cashire Tavern (547 Emerson St.,
Palo Alto) into a Stanford hangout of
the pub night variety, but it doesn't
seem to have fully caught on. A
morning alternative: the brunch
crowd at Hobee's. And don't forget
The New Varsity, especially when the
theater is showing Woody Allen
movies.
Why don't we pick the kind of food we
want? It's the familiar refrain: How
about Chinese? How about Mexican?
And it's easy to fall into around here,
because there are more ethnic restau
rants than you can shake a burrito or
a potsticker at. Most of them are bad
as you'd expect; here are a few of the
good ones.
Generations of Stanfordites have fal
len in love with the mu shu pork at
Chef Chu's (1067 North San Antonio
Road at El Camino Real, Los Altos).
This always crowded Mandarin res
taurant prepares perfectly solid, un
exciting dishes — it's the ideal place
for large groups with diverse tastes.
The food's more exciting at China
First (675 el Camino Real, Palo
Alto), another place with a large
reputation. The cuisine here is Szech
wan/Hunan, albeit not that spicy, and
there are great dishes on the menu; if
you go in looking like students, you
may have to put up with the waiter
sniffing at you.
On a more modest scale, there are
two worthwhile Chinese places in
Menlo Park; Yuen Yung (639 Santa
Cruz Ave.) and Su Hong (1039 El
Camino Real). Both are eclectic, but
primarily Cantonese/Mandarin. Su
Hong has better food, Yuen Yung
more interesting decor —it looks like
a cross between a Chinese restaurant
and a fern bar.
Palo Alto lost its only really good

Mexican restaurant when Andes
Mexican Restaurant, a Whiskey
Gulch anomaly, folded earlier this
year. Now a trip to Menlo Park or
Los Altos is required. Estrellita (971
North San Antonio Rd., Los Altos)
isn't what it used to be, but it still has
great chimichangas. There are two
passable family-type Mexican joints,
La Luna Mexican Cafe (1137
Chestnut St.) and Calela (1143 D
Crane St.). If you don't mind a drive,
the best Latin restaurant around is
probably El Calderon (699 El Cal
deron Ave., Mountain View), which
is hidden away in a small shopping
center and has a Mexican/Salvadoran
menu.
Places worth going to for French food.
Without going into too much detail,
there are two local French restaurants
that come close to meeting the bistro
ideal (good food, relatively low
prices): Le Pot au Feu (1149 El
Camino Real, Menlo Park) and A La
Carte Restaurant Francois (2310 El
Camino Real, Palo Alto). Somewhat
more formal, but still affordable, are
Pear Williams Restaurant Francais
(150 Middlefield Road, Menlo Park)
and Chez Louis (4170 El Camino

Real, Palo Alto). Most of the other
nearby French restaurants suffer
from some combination of preten
tiousness, over-pricing, bad service
and just plain poor food.
A place to go to for German food. The
only German restaurant I've dis
covered anywhere near campus is
the Black Forest Inn (376 First Street,
Los Altos). Meals are prepared
rather indifferently, but if you just
have to have some weinershnitzel
with red cabbage and potato
pancakes, this is the place to go.
Real burritos. Rosita's Taqueria
(171 A sth Ave., Redwood City) oc
cupies a storefront in an uninviting
part of Redwood City (a town know
for its uninviting parts) and makes the
only authentic burritos-to-go in the
area. These are big sloppy things that
can't be eaten while driving a car, and
they come in a wide selection, includ
ing pork and beef in several sauces,
steak, chicken, sausage and tongue.
Rosita's also has a good selection of
Mexican beers and soft drinks (you
haven't lived until you've had a Boing
soda).
Remember quiche? After fondue and
before pesto, there was quiche. The
Perfect Recipe (76 Stanford Shopping
Center) still serves this forgotten vic
tim of the gourmet wars, along with
cutesy sandwiches and good coffee; a
different quiche is served every day,
and you can count on a flakey crust
and perfect consistency. They don't
serve white wine, but you can still dig
your clogs out of the closet and
pretend Stanford is a shoo-in for a
bowl game (which last happened at
about the height of the quiche craze).
The best pizza within a half-hour of
Stanford. Frankie, Johnnie & Luigi,
Too (939 El Camino Real, Mountain
View) has no peer in pizza; what it
does have are 15-minute-to-an-hour
waits on weekends, which can fly by if
enough of you go and you drink
