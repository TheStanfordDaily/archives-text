# Dining in the Palo Alto style
## 
### 
Breakfast. Morning eaters are lucky
here — Palo Alto and Menlo Park
have a plethora of good restaurants
that specialize in breakfast and lunch.
First among equals is Late for the
Train (8561 Oak Grove Ave., Menlo
Park, near the train station), a folksy
place that makes great omelettes,
divine blintzes and fruit pancakes,
and the usual salads and sandwiches,
plus ever-changing desserts. If you go
on a weekend, particularly a Sunday,

expect at least a 45-minute wait; it's
best, if you can, to go for an early or
late weekday lunch, when you can of
ten be seated immediately. Modeled
along much the same lines is Hohee's
Haven (4224 El Camino Real, Palo
Alto, and Town and Country Vil
lage), a family operation with more
branches down the peninsula.
Hobee's follows more traditional
American breakfast lines — sausage,
eggs, ham — but isn't lacking for
fresh-squeezed juices, fruit, and other
California trimmings, and it has a
truly addictive coffee cake that comes
with most of the breakfasts. The

Farmer's Market (448 California
Ave., Palo Alto) has a small menu,
spotty service (semi-cafeteria style)
and the ambiance of a butcher shop,
but it serves great breakfasts (try the
apple pancakes or a ham-swiss-apple
omelette) at amazingly low prices.
(The latter isn't always true on
weekends, when you may find your
self ordering a "brunch" at inflated
prices). Finally, there's the favorite
morning meeting spot of Stanford
sororities: Dinah's Poolside Coffee
Shop (4269 El Camino Real, Palo
Alto; not to be confused with Dinah's
Shack, a mediocre restaurant next
door), which many people feel has
the best omelettes in the area.
Where the Cardinal flocks. Stanford
hangouts change from year to year, of
course, and I'm sure the newest ones
have escaped my attention, but there
are old standards. Half the people in
Ramona's on any given weekend
night will be from Stanford; the Stan
ford crush is particularly intense
before and after basketball games.
Most of them will be eating the
second-best pizza in the area,
while those who want to be
different chew on Calzone or decent
hamburgers. The once-great
Ramona's salad bar maintains only a
shade of its former glory. Down the
street at the Good Earth Restaurant
(185 University Ave., Palo Alto)
you'll find a different, slightly older,
Stanford crowd eating chic health
food. Of course, hangouts in the true
Stanford sense of the word are places
you go to swill beer, and there are a
couple of those: The Dutch Goose
(3567 Alameda de las Pulgas, Menlo
Park), a functional sort of place
where there's standing room only on
Senior Pub Nights, and The Oasis
Beer Garden (241 El Camino Real,
Menlo Park), a downright ugly place
that has been witness to untold
decades of Stanford history. Two
things you have to know: refer to
them as "the Goose" and"the O,"
respectively; and rest assured that
you will be carded at both establish

merits. If you like your nightlife a bit
rowdier, try St. James Infirmary (390
Moffet Blvd., Mountain View) or
Antonio's Nut House (321 California
Ave., Palo Alto), places where you
can get into a fight if you try hard
enough. In recent years an attempt
has been made to turn The Lan
cashire Tavern (547 Emerson St.,
Palo Alto) into a Stanford hangout of
the pub night variety, but it doesn't
seem to have fully caught on. A
morning alternative: the brunch
crowd at Hobee's. And don't forget
The New Varsity, especially when the
theater is showing Woody Allen
movies.
Why don't we pick the kind of food we
want? It's the familiar refrain: How
about Chinese? How about Mexican?
And it's easy to fall into around here,
because there are more ethnic restau
rants than you can shake a burrito or
a potsticker at. Most of them are bad
as you'd expect; here are a few of the
good ones.
Generations of Stanfordites have fal
len in love with the mu shu pork at
Chef Chu's (1067 North San Antonio
Road at El Camino Real, Los Altos).
This always crowded Mandarin res
taurant prepares perfectly solid, un
exciting dishes — it's the ideal place
for large groups with diverse tastes.
The food's more exciting at China
First (675 el Camino Real, Palo
Alto), another place with a large
reputation. The cuisine here is Szech
wan/Hunan, albeit not that spicy, and
there are great dishes on the menu; if
you go in looking like students, you
may have to put up with the waiter
sniffing at you.
On a more modest scale, there are
two worthwhile Chinese places in
Menlo Park; Yuen Yung (639 Santa
Cruz Ave.) and Su Hong (1039 El
Camino Real). Both are eclectic, but
primarily Cantonese/Mandarin. Su
Hong has better food, Yuen Yung
more interesting decor —it looks like
a cross between a Chinese restaurant
and a fern bar.
Palo Alto lost its only really good

Mexican restaurant when Andes
Mexican Restaurant, a Whiskey
Gulch anomaly, folded earlier this
year. Now a trip to Menlo Park or
Los Altos is required. Estrellita (971
North San Antonio Rd., Los Altos)
isn't what it used to be, but it still has
great chimichangas. There are two
passable family-type Mexican joints,
La Luna Mexican Cafe (1137
Chestnut St.) and Calela (1143 D
Crane St.). If you don't mind a drive,
the best Latin restaurant around is
probably El Calderon (699 El Cal
deron Ave., Mountain View), which
is hidden away in a small shopping
center and has a Mexican/Salvadoran
menu.
Places worth going to for French food.
Without going into too much detail,
there are two local French restaurants
that come close to meeting the bistro
ideal (good food, relatively low
prices): Le Pot au Feu (1149 El
Camino Real, Menlo Park) and A La
Carte Restaurant Francois (2310 El
Camino Real, Palo Alto). Somewhat
more formal, but still affordable, are
Pear Williams Restaurant Francais
(150 Middlefield Road, Menlo Park)
and Chez Louis (4170 El Camino

Real, Palo Alto). Most of the other
nearby French restaurants suffer
from some combination of preten
tiousness, over-pricing, bad service
and just plain poor food.
A place to go to for German food. The
only German restaurant I've dis
covered anywhere near campus is
the Black Forest Inn (376 First Street,
Los Altos). Meals are prepared
rather indifferently, but if you just
have to have some weinershnitzel
with red cabbage and potato
pancakes, this is the place to go.
Real burritos. Rosita's Taqueria
(171 A sth Ave., Redwood City) oc
cupies a storefront in an uninviting
part of Redwood City (a town know
for its uninviting parts) and makes the
only authentic burritos-to-go in the
area. These are big sloppy things that
can't be eaten while driving a car, and
they come in a wide selection, includ
ing pork and beef in several sauces,
steak, chicken, sausage and tongue.
Rosita's also has a good selection of
Mexican beers and soft drinks (you
haven't lived until you've had a Boing
soda).
Remember quiche? After fondue and
before pesto, there was quiche. The
Perfect Recipe (76 Stanford Shopping
Center) still serves this forgotten vic
tim of the gourmet wars, along with
cutesy sandwiches and good coffee; a
different quiche is served every day,
and you can count on a flakey crust
and perfect consistency. They don't
serve white wine, but you can still dig
your clogs out of the closet and
pretend Stanford is a shoo-in for a
bowl game (which last happened at
about the height of the quiche craze).
The best pizza within a half-hour of
Stanford. Frankie, Johnnie & Luigi,
Too (939 El Camino Real, Mountain
View) has no peer in pizza; what it
does have are 15-minute-to-an-hour
waits on weekends, which can fly by if
enough of you go and you drink


enough while waiting (if you look 21,
you'll be accosted by a roving cocktail
waitress the minute you sign in). Try
the fresh-tomato-and-garlic pizza, a
house specialty, and avoid the Italian
dinners, which are often dreadful. A
distant second to FJ&L is Ramona's
Restaurant (541 Ramona St., Palo
Alto), which has decent New York
style (i.e., heavy and spicy) pizza and
slightly shorter waits; it's 15 minutes
closer to campus. Honorable men
tion goes to pizza with barbecue
sauce (ladled on in place of tomato
sauce) at Jose's (2275 El Caniino
Real, Palo Alto).

It's 2 a.m. and I'm hungry and noth
ing's open. There used to be a wealth
of places you could go at 2 a.m. (or 4
a.m., or 6 a.m.) with the gang and be
obnoxious, or with a loved one to for
tify yourself for an emotional crisis,
or by yourself to study and grab a
burger. But Stickney's Flamingo first
cut back to midnight, and then
became a trendy Yuppie restaurant;
Luv's went to 24 hours on weekends
only, then became a singles dance
spot, and is now Atherton Joe's,
which is God only knows what. In the
old days, going to Denny's or Lyon's
didn't even cross your mind; now
they're all that's left. Closer (by about
a hundred yards) and friendlier is
Denny's (4256 El Camino Real, Palo
Alto), which is 10 minutes away at
two in the morning. Denny's is also
cheaper than Lyon's, it has tackier
vinyl (bright orange), and it has Ova,
the current all-star late-night
waitress. So why go to Lyon's (4298
El Camino Real, Los Altos) at all?
Because sometimes you need a
change. Lyon's is darker, the
waitresses are younger, and the meals
are bigger; if you're determined to
eat a lot of food at 4 and make your

self really sick, there's nothing like a
Mighty Lyon Burger.
The only competition left for these
corporate monsters is the University
Creamery (209 University Ave., Palo
Alto), which sensed the vacuum and
went to a 24-hour policy last spring.
The Creamery has pretty mediocre
greasy-spoon food, but the
milkshakes are great (they use Bud's
ice cream) and it's a lot closer to
campus (it's even within fairly easy
bicycle range).

Ice cream. We all love ice cream, but
no one can deny that the Stanford
area is drowning in the stuff. Within a
quick drive of campus are a Haagen-
Dazs (Stanford Barn, 700 Welch
Road), two Bud's (125 University
Ave., Palo Alto and 3590 Alameda
de las Pulgas, Menlo Park) and
various Swensen's and Baskin-
Robbins outlets, as well as the Italian

ice cream shops: Gelalo La
Romanina (1700 EI Camino Real,
Menlo Park), Tempo Gelato (2245 El
Camino Real, Palo Alto), Gelalo
Classico (Emerson St., downtown
Palo Alto), Bravo Fono (99Stanford
Shopping Center), et al. Two or three
more have probably opened since you
started reading this. If ice cream to
you means a soda fountain, try Edy's
(73 Town & Country Village, El-
Camino and Ambarcadero, Palo
Alto), or one of the downtown
creameries: Peninsula Creamery
(Hamilton Avenue and Emerson St.,
Palo Alto) and University Creamery
(209 University Ave., Palo Alto).
Spirits in the night. There are as
many different kinds of bars as there
are drinkers, and the most popular
ones — the Goose, the O, 42nd
Street, the BBC — are treated else
where in the article. I'm concerned
here with the bar as a comfortable en
vironment in which to drink, as
opposed to a supportive environment
in which to get drunk (or find your
soulmate).
The Gatehouse (265 Lytton Ave.,
Palo Alto) is a snitzy restaurant by
day and a snitzy bar by night, and one
of the nicest places to sit around in Palo
Alto. The bar at Mama's (379 Stan
ford Shopping Center) is a bit out of
the way, but it has a certain hushed
elegance that makes it attractive.
Henry's (482 University Ave., Palo
Alto) is hot and crowded once the
dinner customers clear out, but
there's no one on the make; just lots
of successful young Palo Altans hang
ing out in one of their favorite bars.
Another bar that has a "scene," but
isn't quite a singles bar, is that of the
New Varsity (456 University Ave.,
Palo Alto). Videos play above the
bar, musicians play in the courtyard,
and lots of Palo Alto High School
blondes and assorted Palo Alto punks
hang around out front. It's noisy and
crowded and uncomfortable on the
weekends, but the people-watching is

great. If you're looking for something
a little more staid, try the bar at the
rear of the London House (630
Ramona St., Palo Alto), a loving re
creation of an English pub where you
can get most any British beer you
want, pub snacks and a game of darts.

The singles scene. I've seen more than
my share of students (MBA and
otherwise) in these places. 42nd
Street (518 Bryant St. Palo Alto, in
the alley between Bryant and
Ramona) is either a dream come true
or a nightmare made real, depending
on your point of view. It's an ex
pensively tacky meat market with
great sight lines, where you'll find a
variety of hunters: tables of
frightened-looking Stanford students,
Palo Alto nouveau riche and lots of
secretaries. The action is much more
serious at the British Bankers Club
(1090 El Camino Real, Menlo Bowl),
which draws an older, richer crowd (it
goes in and out of fashion as a busi
ness school hangout) to its fake Ed
wardian digs. Coming on strong in
recent years has been Mac Arthur
Park (27 University Ave., Palo Alto,
next to the Palo Alto train station), a

favorite of young professional types,
which leads right into:
Where to go to feel like a Yuppie.
style is everything in a Yuppie hang
out, and Mac Arthur Park one of
the approved styles: big, open, white-

paneled spaces, wood floor, railings
everywhere. The food ranges from
mediocre to bad (be sure to
order something from the grill),
but what does it matter when you can
get potato skins and eight wines by
the glass? Another style is represen
ted by Waverley Place (560 Waverley
St., Palo Alto), new to downtown
Palo Alto, which is all glass and
bleached wood and expensive (but
surprisingly good) pastas and seafood
dishes. Along with these upstarts, a
couple of established Palo Alto res
taurants have swung with the times:
The Gatehouse (265 Lytton Ave.),
one of Palo Alto's prettiest places to
eat and drink, is taken over by the
young after the dinner hour, and
Henry's (482 University Ave.) is a fa
vorite with the local advertis
ing/design community that lives off
Silicon Valley.


Silliest wine list in town. At the
above-mentioned Waverley Place,
you can get a young Rothschild
or Chateau Petrus, hut there won't be
anything worth drinking for under
$20.
True romance. Everyone has his own
idea of the perfect surroundings in
which to let love flower, but each of
the following is romantic in its own
way. Bella Vista (13451 Skyline
Blvd., Woodside) has a gorgeous
view; it nestles in the redwoods atop
the Skyline ridge, and if you're lucky
you'll get a candlelit table by the win
dow that looks out over the bay.
Tuxedoed waiters and picturesque lo
cals in Jaguars complete the picture.
St. Michael's Alley (800 Emerson St.,
Palo Alto) is a little crowded and a
little noisy, but it has an air of sophis
tication unusual in Palo Alto, to go
with its eclectic continental menu
(you'll eat as well here as anywhere in
town). Sundance Mine Company
(1921 El Camino Real, Palo Alto)
isn't to everyone's taste; it has a
boring steak-and-seafood menu, it's
overpriced, and it takes itself awfully
seriously. But we're talking atmo
sphere here, and if you're in the right
feeling-like-an-adult mood, Sun
dance, with its state-of-the-art
green/brown wood/cut-glass interior,
has it to burn. And many a Stanford
couple holds fond memories of Flea
Street Cafe (3607 Alameda de las
Pulgas, Menlo Park, two doors from
the Dutch Goose), a low-key little
place with excellent avant-veggie
food.
Seafood. The Fish Market (3150 El
Camino Real, Palo Alto) has long
been Palo Alto's most popular spot
for seafood, and it generally deserves

to be. It was way ahead of the
mesquite-grill, fresh-special game,
and the high school kids who do the
grilling get it right most of the time.
There's also friendly, informal service
from an army of T-shirt-clad young
waitresses. The lines can be long on
weekends, but there's an outdoor
patio, drinks while you wait, and an
oyster/seafood cocktail bar to help
pass the time. Scott's Seafood Grill eft
Bar (2300 East Bayshore at Embar
cadero, Palo Alto) has given The Fish
Market a run for its money since
opening four years ago, but it's at
tractive mainly as a place to be seen;
the fish is overcooked about half the
time, the service can be shoddy, and
the prices are way out of line.
Places to get "California Cuisine."
There are no restaurants in the
vicinity of campus that could be
called innovative, but there are some
with Berkeley-gourmet trappings.
Fresco (3398 El Camino Real, Palo
Alto) is a corporate version of the the
California ideal (it's run by the
Mac Arthur Park/Prego/Ciao
combine), serving pastas and grilled
fish cooked with various combination
of sundried tomatos, basil and red
peppers, along with composed salads
and the obligatory grilled meats
(lamb and steak). It's a pleasant, rea
sonably priced place with perfectly
well-prepared, but boring, food.
Smaller and chicer is Theo's (546
University Ave., Palo Alto), which
has a more conservative, steakhouse
type of menu but a better wine list
(wine being all-important in this type
of restaurant).
Hamburgers. Kirk's (361 California
Ave., Palo Alto) has great

hamburgers, but they're not for the
faint-hearted. Ask for your
steakburger well-done if you don't
want it raw. The burgers at Kirk's are
cooked over a charcoal grill while you
wait; there's nothing else to eat but
potato chips and some packaged
salads, but this is a small point when
you're getting one of the last of the
real hamburgers. A close second in
the hamburger derby is the Alpine
Beer Garden (3915 Alpine road, Por
tola Valley), also known as the
Alpine Inn or as Rosotti's or, most
commonly, as Zott's. This is an old
time roadhouse where bikers and the
local Ford truck crowd mingle freely
with the Mercedes/BMW set, all
drinking pitchers of Henry's and
Anchor Steam at picnic tables in the
vast, dusty patio out back. The
burgers here are cooked on an
electric grill, but they're good-sized
and the trimmings are excellent:
sourdough French rolls, fresh lettuce
and-tomato setups. A hamburger and
beer on the patio at Zott's on a sunny
(but not too hot) day is what Califor
nia is all about.
Where to go with your bank card.
Some of the most expensive restau
rants around are: The Village Pub
(2967 Woodside Road, Woodside),
La Tour (525 University Ave., Palo
Alto), Maddalena's (544 emerson St.,
Palo Alto), Chantilly (530 Ramona
St., Palo Alto) and Hugo's Market
(4219 El Camino Real, Palo Alto, at
Rickey's Hyatt). Several of these
places have truly bad food, but your
pocketbook won't know the differ
ence.
Places to hear music. There are a few
places nearby where you can catch a

band while sitting down. Just a few.
The New Varsity (45b University
Ave., Palo Alto), a restaurant/art
house movie theater/bar/Palo Alto
High hangout, has live music in its
front courtyard most nights. Among
the regulars are Tuck and Patti, an
extremely popular local jazz
guitar/vocalist duo, and some of the
second-rank Windham Hill artists,
particularly Michael Hedges. Be
warned: On the weekends the
alienated teens of Palo Alto descend
on the New Varsity and hang out on
the sidewalk in front; you'll have to
walk their gauntlet to get in, espe
cially if something like
"Ouadrophenia" is playing as the
midnight show. St. Michael's Alley
has an adjoining cafe where music,
often folk, is performed on
weekends; the cafe, called St. Mi
chael's Waiting Room, has some of
the best pastries in town along with
wines and sherries by the glass, beer,
and all other things liquid. Adlai Al
exander, an ex-stalwart of several
campus bands, plays The Gatehouse
on Wednesday and Saturday
evenings; Alexander is an accom
plished jazz guitarist and a sometimes
amazing singer. If you like your music
with more of a participatory edge, try
the piano bar at Chez Louis, where
Roger Cowger might let you take
microphone in hand and wow the
crowd with your own impassioned
version of "The Impossible Dream."
And finally, check the weekly listings
for the Keystone Palo Alto (260 Cali
fornia Ave.), a disastrously uncom
fortable, hot, smoky, loud nightclub
with overpriced, watered-down
drinks where in the course of the last
four years you could have caught Neil
Young, Warren Zevon, The Band,
Jackson Browne, Bruce Springsteen

jumping up on stage with Clarence
demons and the Red Bank Rockers
Avoid at all costs. Sometime while
you're here someone will suggest
going to one of these restaurants.
Politely tell him/her you'd rather un
dergo root canal work.

Dinah's Shack (4269 EI Camino
Real) is one of those inexplicably
popular restaurants — I can see why
little old ladies go there, but why in
God's name would anyone else want
to spend $10 for a lousy buffet and
the chance to hear "Feelings" played
on the harp? Ecco Ristorante (4290
El Camino Real, Palo Alto) right
across the street in the Hyatt Palo
Alto, may be the worst Italian restau
rant I've ever encountered, and the
green carpet doesn't help. King Chuan
(75 Town and Country Village, Palo
Alto) had, at last count, three differ
ent laudatory Stanford Daily reviews
posted in its window. Don't believe a
word of them.

Breakfast. Morning eaters are lucky

Rosita's also has a good selection of
Mexican beers and soft drinks (you
haven't lived until you've had a Boing
soda).
Remember quiche? After fondue and
before pesto, there was quiche. The
Perfect Recipe (76 Stanford Shopping
Center) still serves this forgotten vic
tim of the gourmet wars, along with
cutesy sandwiches and good coffee; a
different quiche is served every day,
and you can count on a flakey crust
and perfect consistency. They don't
serve white wine, but you can still dig
your clogs out of the closet and
pretend Stanford is a shoo-in for a
bowl game (which last happened at
about the height of the quiche craze).
The best pizza within a half-hour of
Stanford. Frankie, Johnnie & Luigi,
Too (939 El Camino Real, Mountain
View) has no peer in pizza; what it
does have are 15-minute-to-an-hour
waits on weekends, which can fly by if
enough of you go and you drink


enough while waiting (if you look 21,
you'll be accosted by a roving cocktail
waitress the minute you sign in). Try
the fresh-tomato-and-garlic pizza, a
house specialty, and avoid the Italian
dinners, which are often dreadful. A
distant second to FJ&L is Ramona's
Restaurant (541 Ramona St., Palo
Alto), which has decent New York
style (i.e., heavy and spicy) pizza and
slightly shorter waits; it's 15 minutes
closer to campus. Honorable men
tion goes to pizza with barbecue
sauce (ladled on in place of tomato
sauce) at Jose's (2275 El Caniino
Real, Palo Alto).

It's 2 a.m. and I'm hungry and noth
ing's open. There used to be a wealth
of places you could go at 2 a.m. (or 4
a.m., or 6 a.m.) with the gang and be
obnoxious, or with a loved one to for
tify yourself for an emotional crisis,
or by yourself to study and grab a
burger. But Stickney's Flamingo first
cut back to midnight, and then
became a trendy Yuppie restaurant;
Luv's went to 24 hours on weekends
only, then became a singles dance
spot, and is now Atherton Joe's,
which is God only knows what. In the
old days, going to Denny's or Lyon's
didn't even cross your mind; now
they're all that's left. Closer (by about
a hundred yards) and friendlier is
Denny's (4256 El Camino Real, Palo
Alto), which is 10 minutes away at
two in the morning. Denny's is also
cheaper than Lyon's, it has tackier
vinyl (bright orange), and it has Ova,
the current all-star late-night
waitress. So why go to Lyon's (4298
El Camino Real, Los Altos) at all?
Because sometimes you need a
change. Lyon's is darker, the
waitresses are younger, and the meals
are bigger; if you're determined to
eat a lot of food at 4 and make your

self really sick, there's nothing like a
Mighty Lyon Burger.
The only competition left for these
corporate monsters is the University
Creamery (209 University Ave., Palo
Alto), which sensed the vacuum and
went to a 24-hour policy last spring.
The Creamery has pretty mediocre
greasy-spoon food, but the
milkshakes are great (they use Bud's
ice cream) and it's a lot closer to
campus (it's even within fairly easy
bicycle range).

Ice cream. We all love ice cream, but
no one can deny that the Stanford
area is drowning in the stuff. Within a
quick drive of campus are a Haagen-
Dazs (Stanford Barn, 700 Welch
Road), two Bud's (125 University
Ave., Palo Alto and 3590 Alameda
de las Pulgas, Menlo Park) and
various Swensen's and Baskin-
Robbins outlets, as well as the Italian

ice cream shops: Gelalo La
Romanina (1700 EI Camino Real,
Menlo Park), Tempo Gelato (2245 El
Camino Real, Palo Alto), Gelalo
Classico (Emerson St., downtown
Palo Alto), Bravo Fono (99Stanford
Shopping Center), et al. Two or three
more have probably opened since you
started reading this. If ice cream to
you means a soda fountain, try Edy's
(73 Town & Country Village, El-
Camino and Ambarcadero, Palo
Alto), or one of the downtown
creameries: Peninsula Creamery
(Hamilton Avenue and Emerson St.,
Palo Alto) and University Creamery
(209 University Ave., Palo Alto).
Spirits in the night. There are as
many different kinds of bars as there
are drinkers, and the most popular
ones — the Goose, the O, 42nd
Street, the BBC — are treated else
where in the article. I'm concerned
here with the bar as a comfortable en
vironment in which to drink, as
opposed to a supportive environment
in which to get drunk (or find your
soulmate).
The Gatehouse (265 Lytton Ave.,
Palo Alto) is a snitzy restaurant by
day and a snitzy bar by night, and one
of the nicest places to sit around in Palo
Alto. The bar at Mama's (379 Stan
ford Shopping Center) is a bit out of
the way, but it has a certain hushed
elegance that makes it attractive.
Henry's (482 University Ave., Palo
Alto) is hot and crowded once the
dinner customers clear out, but
there's no one on the make; just lots
of successful young Palo Altans hang
ing out in one of their favorite bars.
Another bar that has a "scene," but
isn't quite a singles bar, is that of the
New Varsity (456 University Ave.,
Palo Alto). Videos play above the
bar, musicians play in the courtyard,
and lots of Palo Alto High School
blondes and assorted Palo Alto punks
hang around out front. It's noisy and
crowded and uncomfortable on the
weekends, but the people-watching is

great. If you're looking for something
a little more staid, try the bar at the
rear of the London House (630
Ramona St., Palo Alto), a loving re
creation of an English pub where you
can get most any British beer you
want, pub snacks and a game of darts.

The singles scene. I've seen more than
my share of students (MBA and
otherwise) in these places. 42nd
Street (518 Bryant St. Palo Alto, in
the alley between Bryant and
Ramona) is either a dream come true
or a nightmare made real, depending
on your point of view. It's an ex
pensively tacky meat market with
great sight lines, where you'll find a
variety of hunters: tables of
frightened-looking Stanford students,
Palo Alto nouveau riche and lots of
secretaries. The action is much more
serious at the British Bankers Club
(1090 El Camino Real, Menlo Bowl),
which draws an older, richer crowd (it
goes in and out of fashion as a busi
ness school hangout) to its fake Ed
wardian digs. Coming on strong in
recent years has been Mac Arthur
Park (27 University Ave., Palo Alto,
next to the Palo Alto train station), a

favorite of young professional types,
which leads right into:
Where to go to feel like a Yuppie.
style is everything in a Yuppie hang
out, and Mac Arthur Park one of
the approved styles: big, open, white-

paneled spaces, wood floor, railings
everywhere. The food ranges from
mediocre to bad (be sure to
order something from the grill),
but what does it matter when you can
get potato skins and eight wines by
the glass? Another style is represen
ted by Waverley Place (560 Waverley
St., Palo Alto), new to downtown
Palo Alto, which is all glass and
bleached wood and expensive (but
surprisingly good) pastas and seafood
dishes. Along with these upstarts, a
couple of established Palo Alto res
taurants have swung with the times:
The Gatehouse (265 Lytton Ave.),
one of Palo Alto's prettiest places to
eat and drink, is taken over by the
young after the dinner hour, and
Henry's (482 University Ave.) is a fa
vorite with the local advertis
ing/design community that lives off
Silicon Valley.


Silliest wine list in town. At the
above-mentioned Waverley Place,
you can get a young Rothschild
or Chateau Petrus, hut there won't be
anything worth drinking for under
$20.
True romance. Everyone has his own
idea of the perfect surroundings in
which to let love flower, but each of
the following is romantic in its own
way. Bella Vista (13451 Skyline
Blvd., Woodside) has a gorgeous
view; it nestles in the redwoods atop
the Skyline ridge, and if you're lucky
you'll get a candlelit table by the win
dow that looks out over the bay.
Tuxedoed waiters and picturesque lo
cals in Jaguars complete the picture.
St. Michael's Alley (800 Emerson St.,
Palo Alto) is a little crowded and a
little noisy, but it has an air of sophis
tication unusual in Palo Alto, to go
with its eclectic continental menu
(you'll eat as well here as anywhere in
town). Sundance Mine Company
(1921 El Camino Real, Palo Alto)
isn't to everyone's taste; it has a
boring steak-and-seafood menu, it's
overpriced, and it takes itself awfully
seriously. But we're talking atmo
sphere here, and if you're in the right
feeling-like-an-adult mood, Sun
dance, with its state-of-the-art
green/brown wood/cut-glass interior,
has it to burn. And many a Stanford
couple holds fond memories of Flea
Street Cafe (3607 Alameda de las
Pulgas, Menlo Park, two doors from
the Dutch Goose), a low-key little
place with excellent avant-veggie
food.
Seafood. The Fish Market (3150 El
Camino Real, Palo Alto) has long
been Palo Alto's most popular spot
for seafood, and it generally deserves

to be. It was way ahead of the
mesquite-grill, fresh-special game,
and the high school kids who do the
grilling get it right most of the time.
There's also friendly, informal service
from an army of T-shirt-clad young
waitresses. The lines can be long on
weekends, but there's an outdoor
patio, drinks while you wait, and an
oyster/seafood cocktail bar to help
pass the time. Scott's Seafood Grill eft
Bar (2300 East Bayshore at Embar
cadero, Palo Alto) has given The Fish
Market a run for its money since
opening four years ago, but it's at
tractive mainly as a place to be seen;
the fish is overcooked about half the
time, the service can be shoddy, and
the prices are way out of line.
Places to get "California Cuisine."
There are no restaurants in the
vicinity of campus that could be
called innovative, but there are some
with Berkeley-gourmet trappings.
Fresco (3398 El Camino Real, Palo
Alto) is a corporate version of the the
California ideal (it's run by the
Mac Arthur Park/Prego/Ciao
combine), serving pastas and grilled
fish cooked with various combination
of sundried tomatos, basil and red
peppers, along with composed salads
and the obligatory grilled meats
(lamb and steak). It's a pleasant, rea
sonably priced place with perfectly
well-prepared, but boring, food.
Smaller and chicer is Theo's (546
University Ave., Palo Alto), which
has a more conservative, steakhouse
type of menu but a better wine list
(wine being all-important in this type
of restaurant).
Hamburgers. Kirk's (361 California
Ave., Palo Alto) has great

hamburgers, but they're not for the
faint-hearted. Ask for your
steakburger well-done if you don't
want it raw. The burgers at Kirk's are
cooked over a charcoal grill while you
wait; there's nothing else to eat but
potato chips and some packaged
salads, but this is a small point when
you're getting one of the last of the
real hamburgers. A close second in
the hamburger derby is the Alpine
Beer Garden (3915 Alpine road, Por
tola Valley), also known as the
Alpine Inn or as Rosotti's or, most
commonly, as Zott's. This is an old
time roadhouse where bikers and the
local Ford truck crowd mingle freely
with the Mercedes/BMW set, all
drinking pitchers of Henry's and
Anchor Steam at picnic tables in the
vast, dusty patio out back. The
burgers here are cooked on an
electric grill, but they're good-sized
and the trimmings are excellent:
sourdough French rolls, fresh lettuce
and-tomato setups. A hamburger and
beer on the patio at Zott's on a sunny
(but not too hot) day is what Califor
nia is all about.
Where to go with your bank card.
Some of the most expensive restau
rants around are: The Village Pub
(2967 Woodside Road, Woodside),
La Tour (525 University Ave., Palo
Alto), Maddalena's (544 emerson St.,
Palo Alto), Chantilly (530 Ramona
St., Palo Alto) and Hugo's Market
(4219 El Camino Real, Palo Alto, at
Rickey's Hyatt). Several of these
places have truly bad food, but your
pocketbook won't know the differ
ence.
Places to hear music. There are a few
places nearby where you can catch a

band while sitting down. Just a few.
The New Varsity (45b University
Ave., Palo Alto), a restaurant/art
house movie theater/bar/Palo Alto
High hangout, has live music in its
front courtyard most nights. Among
the regulars are Tuck and Patti, an
extremely popular local jazz
guitar/vocalist duo, and some of the
second-rank Windham Hill artists,
particularly Michael Hedges. Be
warned: On the weekends the
alienated teens of Palo Alto descend
on the New Varsity and hang out on
the sidewalk in front; you'll have to
walk their gauntlet to get in, espe
cially if something like
"Ouadrophenia" is playing as the
midnight show. St. Michael's Alley
has an adjoining cafe where music,
often folk, is performed on
weekends; the cafe, called St. Mi
chael's Waiting Room, has some of
the best pastries in town along with
wines and sherries by the glass, beer,
and all other things liquid. Adlai Al
exander, an ex-stalwart of several
campus bands, plays The Gatehouse
on Wednesday and Saturday
evenings; Alexander is an accom
plished jazz guitarist and a sometimes
amazing singer. If you like your music
with more of a participatory edge, try
the piano bar at Chez Louis, where
Roger Cowger might let you take
microphone in hand and wow the
crowd with your own impassioned
version of "The Impossible Dream."
And finally, check the weekly listings
for the Keystone Palo Alto (260 Cali
fornia Ave.), a disastrously uncom
fortable, hot, smoky, loud nightclub
with overpriced, watered-down
drinks where in the course of the last
four years you could have caught Neil
Young, Warren Zevon, The Band,
Jackson Browne, Bruce Springsteen

jumping up on stage with Clarence
demons and the Red Bank Rockers
Avoid at all costs. Sometime while
you're here someone will suggest
going to one of these restaurants.
Politely tell him/her you'd rather un
dergo root canal work.

Dinah's Shack (4269 EI Camino
Real) is one of those inexplicably
popular restaurants — I can see why
little old ladies go there, but why in
God's name would anyone else want
to spend $10 for a lousy buffet and
the chance to hear "Feelings" played
on the harp? Ecco Ristorante (4290
El Camino Real, Palo Alto) right
across the street in the Hyatt Palo
Alto, may be the worst Italian restau
rant I've ever encountered, and the
green carpet doesn't help. King Chuan
(75 Town and Country Village, Palo
Alto) had, at last count, three differ
ent laudatory Stanford Daily reviews
posted in its window. Don't believe a
word of them.

Breakfast. Morning eaters are lucky
here — Palo Alto and Menlo Park
have a plethora of good restaurants
that specialize in breakfast and lunch.
First among equals is Late for the
Train (8561 Oak Grove Ave., Menlo
Park, near the train station), a folksy
place that makes great omelettes,
divine blintzes and fruit pancakes,
and the usual salads and sandwiches,
plus ever-changing desserts. If you go
on a weekend, particularly a Sunday,

expect at least a 45-minute wait; it's
best, if you can, to go for an early or
late weekday lunch, when you can of
ten be seated immediately. Modeled
along much the same lines is Hohee's
Haven (4224 El Camino Real, Palo
Alto, and Town and Country Vil
lage), a family operation with more
branches down the peninsula.
Hobee's follows more traditional
American breakfast lines — sausage,
eggs, ham — but isn't lacking for
fresh-squeezed juices, fruit, and other
California trimmings, and it has a
truly addictive coffee cake that comes
with most of the breakfasts. The

Farmer's Market (448 California
Ave., Palo Alto) has a small menu,
spotty service (semi-cafeteria style)
and the ambiance of a butcher shop,
but it serves great breakfasts (try the
apple pancakes or a ham-swiss-apple
omelette) at amazingly low prices.
(The latter isn't always true on
weekends, when you may find your
self ordering a "brunch" at inflated
prices). Finally, there's the favorite
morning meeting spot of Stanford
sororities: Dinah's Poolside Coffee
Shop (4269 El Camino Real, Palo
Alto; not to be confused with Dinah's
Shack, a mediocre restaurant next
door), which many people feel has
the best omelettes in the area.
Where the Cardinal flocks. Stanford
hangouts change from year to year, of
course, and I'm sure the newest ones
have escaped my attention, but there
are old standards. Half the people in
Ramona's on any given weekend
night will be from Stanford; the Stan
ford crush is particularly intense
before and after basketball games.
Most of them will be eating the
second-best pizza in the area,
while those who want to be
different chew on Calzone or decent
hamburgers. The once-great
Ramona's salad bar maintains only a
shade of its former glory. Down the
street at the Good Earth Restaurant
(185 University Ave., Palo Alto)
you'll find a different, slightly older,
Stanford crowd eating chic health
food. Of course, hangouts in the true
Stanford sense of the word are places
you go to swill beer, and there are a
couple of those: The Dutch Goose
(3567 Alameda de las Pulgas, Menlo
Park), a functional sort of place
where there's standing room only on
Senior Pub Nights, and The Oasis
Beer Garden (241 El Camino Real,
Menlo Park), a downright ugly place
that has been witness to untold
decades of Stanford history. Two
things you have to know: refer to
them as "the Goose" and"the O,"
respectively; and rest assured that
you will be carded at both establish

merits. If you like your nightlife a bit
rowdier, try St. James Infirmary (390
Moffet Blvd., Mountain View) or
Antonio's Nut House (321 California
Ave., Palo Alto), places where you
can get into a fight if you try hard
enough. In recent years an attempt
has been made to turn The Lan
cashire Tavern (547 Emerson St.,
Palo Alto) into a Stanford hangout of
the pub night variety, but it doesn't
seem to have fully caught on. A
morning alternative: the brunch
crowd at Hobee's. And don't forget
The New Varsity, especially when the
theater is showing Woody Allen
movies.
Why don't we pick the kind of food we
want? It's the familiar refrain: How
about Chinese? How about Mexican?
And it's easy to fall into around here,
because there are more ethnic restau
rants than you can shake a burrito or
a potsticker at. Most of them are bad
as you'd expect; here are a few of the
good ones.
Generations of Stanfordites have fal
len in love with the mu shu pork at
Chef Chu's (1067 North San Antonio
Road at El Camino Real, Los Altos).
This always crowded Mandarin res
taurant prepares perfectly solid, un
exciting dishes — it's the ideal place
for large groups with diverse tastes.
The food's more exciting at China
First (675 el Camino Real, Palo
Alto), another place with a large
reputation. The cuisine here is Szech
wan/Hunan, albeit not that spicy, and
there are great dishes on the menu; if
you go in looking like students, you
may have to put up with the waiter
sniffing at you.
On a more modest scale, there are
two worthwhile Chinese places in
Menlo Park; Yuen Yung (639 Santa
Cruz Ave.) and Su Hong (1039 El
Camino Real). Both are eclectic, but
primarily Cantonese/Mandarin. Su
Hong has better food, Yuen Yung
more interesting decor —it looks like
a cross between a Chinese restaurant
and a fern bar.
Palo Alto lost its only really good

Mexican restaurant when Andes
Mexican Restaurant, a Whiskey
Gulch anomaly, folded earlier this
year. Now a trip to Menlo Park or
Los Altos is required. Estrellita (971
North San Antonio Rd., Los Altos)
isn't what it used to be, but it still has
great chimichangas. There are two
passable family-type Mexican joints,
La Luna Mexican Cafe (1137
Chestnut St.) and Calela (1143 D
Crane St.). If you don't mind a drive,
the best Latin restaurant around is
probably El Calderon (699 El Cal
deron Ave., Mountain View), which
is hidden away in a small shopping
center and has a Mexican/Salvadoran
menu.
Places worth going to for French food.
Without going into too much detail,
there are two local French restaurants
that come close to meeting the bistro
ideal (good food, relatively low
prices): Le Pot au Feu (1149 El
Camino Real, Menlo Park) and A La
Carte Restaurant Francois (2310 El
Camino Real, Palo Alto). Somewhat
more formal, but still affordable, are
Pear Williams Restaurant Francais
(150 Middlefield Road, Menlo Park)
and Chez Louis (4170 El Camino

Real, Palo Alto). Most of the other
nearby French restaurants suffer
from some combination of preten
tiousness, over-pricing, bad service
and just plain poor food.
A place to go to for German food. The
only German restaurant I've dis
covered anywhere near campus is
the Black Forest Inn (376 First Street,
Los Altos). Meals are prepared
rather indifferently, but if you just
have to have some weinershnitzel
with red cabbage and potato
pancakes, this is the place to go.
Real burritos. Rosita's Taqueria
(171 A sth Ave., Redwood City) oc
cupies a storefront in an uninviting
part of Redwood City (a town know
for its uninviting parts) and makes the
only authentic burritos-to-go in the
area. These are big sloppy things that
can't be eaten while driving a car, and
they come in a wide selection, includ
ing pork and beef in several sauces,
steak, chicken, sausage and tongue.
Rosita's also has a good selection of
Mexican beers and soft drinks (you
haven't lived until you've had a Boing
soda).
Remember quiche? After fondue and
before pesto, there was quiche. The
Perfect Recipe (76 Stanford Shopping
Center) still serves this forgotten vic
tim of the gourmet wars, along with
cutesy sandwiches and good coffee; a
different quiche is served every day,
and you can count on a flakey crust
and perfect consistency. They don't
serve white wine, but you can still dig
your clogs out of the closet and
pretend Stanford is a shoo-in for a
bowl game (which last happened at
about the height of the quiche craze).
The best pizza within a half-hour of
Stanford. Frankie, Johnnie & Luigi,
Too (939 El Camino Real, Mountain
View) has no peer in pizza; what it
does have are 15-minute-to-an-hour
waits on weekends, which can fly by if

waitresses are younger, and the meals
are bigger; if you're determined to
eat a lot of food at 4 and make your

self really sick, there's nothing like a

style is everything in a Yuppie hang
out, and Mac Arthur Park one of
the approved styles: big, open, white-

paneled spaces, wood floor, railings
everywhere. The food ranges from
mediocre to bad (be sure to
order something from the grill),
but what does it matter when you can
get potato skins and eight wines by
the glass? Another style is represen
ted by Waverley Place (560 Waverley
St., Palo Alto), new to downtown
Palo Alto, which is all glass and
bleached wood and expensive (but
surprisingly good) pastas and seafood
dishes. Along with these upstarts, a
couple of established Palo Alto res
taurants have swung with the times:
The Gatehouse (265 Lytton Ave.),
one of Palo Alto's prettiest places to
eat and drink, is taken over by the
young after the dinner hour, and
Henry's (482 University Ave.) is a fa
vorite with the local advertis
ing/design community that lives off
Silicon Valley.


Silliest wine list in town. At the
above-mentioned Waverley Place,
you can get a young Rothschild
or Chateau Petrus, hut there won't be
anything worth drinking for under
$20.
True romance. Everyone has his own
idea of the perfect surroundings in
which to let love flower, but each of
the following is romantic in its own
way. Bella Vista (13451 Skyline
Blvd., Woodside) has a gorgeous
view; it nestles in the redwoods atop
the Skyline ridge, and if you're lucky
you'll get a candlelit table by the win
dow that looks out over the bay.
Tuxedoed waiters and picturesque lo
cals in Jaguars complete the picture.
St. Michael's Alley (800 Emerson St.,
Palo Alto) is a little crowded and a
little noisy, but it has an air of sophis
tication unusual in Palo Alto, to go
with its eclectic continental menu
(you'll eat as well here as anywhere in
town). Sundance Mine Company
(1921 El Camino Real, Palo Alto)
isn't to everyone's taste; it has a
boring steak-and-seafood menu, it's
overpriced, and it takes itself awfully
seriously. But we're talking atmo
sphere here, and if you're in the right
feeling-like-an-adult mood, Sun
dance, with its state-of-the-art
green/brown wood/cut-glass interior,
has it to burn. And many a Stanford
couple holds fond memories of Flea
Street Cafe (3607 Alameda de las
Pulgas, Menlo Park, two doors from
the Dutch Goose), a low-key little
place with excellent avant-veggie
food.
Seafood. The Fish Market (3150 El
Camino Real, Palo Alto) has long
been Palo Alto's most popular spot
for seafood, and it generally deserves

to be. It was way ahead of the
mesquite-grill, fresh-special game,
and the high school kids who do the
grilling get it right most of the time.
There's also friendly, informal service
from an army of T-shirt-clad young
waitresses. The lines can be long on
weekends, but there's an outdoor
patio, drinks while you wait, and an
oyster/seafood cocktail bar to help
pass the time. Scott's Seafood Grill eft
Bar (2300 East Bayshore at Embar
cadero, Palo Alto) has given The Fish
Market a run for its money since
opening four years ago, but it's at
tractive mainly as a place to be seen;
the fish is overcooked about half the
time, the service can be shoddy, and
the prices are way out of line.
Places to get "California Cuisine."
There are no restaurants in the
vicinity of campus that could be
called innovative, but there are some
with Berkeley-gourmet trappings.
Fresco (3398 El Camino Real, Palo
Alto) is a corporate version of the the
California ideal (it's run by the
Mac Arthur Park/Prego/Ciao
combine), serving pastas and grilled
fish cooked with various combination
of sundried tomatos, basil and red
peppers, along with composed salads
and the obligatory grilled meats
(lamb and steak). It's a pleasant, rea
sonably priced place with perfectly
well-prepared, but boring, food.
Smaller and chicer is Theo's (546
University Ave., Palo Alto), which
has a more conservative, steakhouse
type of menu but a better wine list
(wine being all-important in this type
of restaurant).
Hamburgers. Kirk's (361 California
Ave., Palo Alto) has great

hamburgers, but they're not for the
faint-hearted. Ask for your
steakburger well-done if you don't
want it raw. The burgers at Kirk's are
cooked over a charcoal grill while you
wait; there's nothing else to eat but
potato chips and some packaged
salads, but this is a small point when
you're getting one of the last of the
real hamburgers. A close second in
the hamburger derby is the Alpine
Beer Garden (3915 Alpine road, Por
tola Valley), also known as the
Alpine Inn or as Rosotti's or, most
commonly, as Zott's. This is an old
time roadhouse where bikers and the
local Ford truck crowd mingle freely
with the Mercedes/BMW set, all
drinking pitchers of Henry's and
Anchor Steam at picnic tables in the
vast, dusty patio out back. The
burgers here are cooked on an
electric grill, but they're good-sized
and the trimmings are excellent:
sourdough French rolls, fresh lettuce
and-tomato setups. A hamburger and
beer on the patio at Zott's on a sunny
(but not too hot) day is what Califor
nia is all about.
Where to go with your bank card.
Some of the most expensive restau
rants around are: The Village Pub
(2967 Woodside Road, Woodside),
La Tour (525 University Ave., Palo
Alto), Maddalena's (544 emerson St.,
Palo Alto), Chantilly (530 Ramona
St., Palo Alto) and Hugo's Market
(4219 El Camino Real, Palo Alto, at
Rickey's Hyatt). Several of these
places have truly bad food, but your
pocketbook won't know the differ
ence.
Places to hear music. There are a few
places nearby where you can catch a

band while sitting down. Just a few.
The New Varsity (45b University
Ave., Palo Alto), a restaurant/art
house movie theater/bar/Palo Alto
High hangout, has live music in its
front courtyard most nights. Among
the regulars are Tuck and Patti, an
extremely popular local jazz
guitar/vocalist duo, and some of the
second-rank Windham Hill artists,
particularly Michael Hedges. Be
warned: On the weekends the
alienated teens of Palo Alto descend
on the New Varsity and hang out on
the sidewalk in front; you'll have to
walk their gauntlet to get in, espe
cially if something like
"Ouadrophenia" is playing as the
midnight show. St. Michael's Alley
has an adjoining cafe where music,
often folk, is performed on
weekends; the cafe, called St. Mi
chael's Waiting Room, has some of
the best pastries in town along with
wines and sherries by the glass, beer,
and all other things liquid. Adlai Al
exander, an ex-stalwart of several
campus bands, plays The Gatehouse
on Wednesday and Saturday
evenings; Alexander is an accom
plished jazz guitarist and a sometimes
amazing singer. If you like your music
with more of a participatory edge, try
the piano bar at Chez Louis, where
Roger Cowger might let you take
microphone in hand and wow the
crowd with your own impassioned
version of "The Impossible Dream."
And finally, check the weekly listings
for the Keystone Palo Alto (260 Cali
fornia Ave.), a disastrously uncom
fortable, hot, smoky, loud nightclub
with overpriced, watered-down
drinks where in the course of the last
four years you could have caught Neil
Young, Warren Zevon, The Band,
Jackson Browne, Bruce Springsteen

jumping up on stage with Clarence
demons and the Red Bank Rockers
Avoid at all costs. Sometime while
you're here someone will suggest
going to one of these restaurants.
Politely tell him/her you'd rather un
dergo root canal work.

Dinah's Shack (4269 EI Camino
Real) is one of those inexplicably
popular restaurants — I can see why
little old ladies go there, but why in
God's name would anyone else want
to spend $10 for a lousy buffet and
the chance to hear "Feelings" played
on the harp? Ecco Ristorante (4290
El Camino Real, Palo Alto) right
across the street in the Hyatt Palo
Alto, may be the worst Italian restau
rant I've ever encountered, and the
green carpet doesn't help. King Chuan
(75 Town and Country Village, Palo
Alto) had, at last count, three differ
ent laudatory Stanford Daily reviews
posted in its window. Don't believe a
word of them.

Breakfast. Morning eaters are lucky
here — Palo Alto and Menlo Park
have a plethora of good restaurants
that specialize in breakfast and lunch.
First among equals is Late for the
Train (8561 Oak Grove Ave., Menlo
Park, near the train station), a folksy
place that makes great omelettes,
divine blintzes and fruit pancakes,
and the usual salads and sandwiches,
plus ever-changing desserts. If you go
on a weekend, particularly a Sunday,

expect at least a 45-minute wait; it's
best, if you can, to go for an early or
late weekday lunch, when you can of
ten be seated immediately. Modeled
along much the same lines is Hohee's
Haven (4224 El Camino Real, Palo
Alto, and Town and Country Vil
lage), a family operation with more
branches down the peninsula.
Hobee's follows more traditional
American breakfast lines — sausage,
eggs, ham — but isn't lacking for
fresh-squeezed juices, fruit, and other
California trimmings, and it has a
truly addictive coffee cake that comes
with most of the breakfasts. The

Farmer's Market (448 California
Ave., Palo Alto) has a small menu,
spotty service (semi-cafeteria style)
and the ambiance of a butcher shop,
but it serves great breakfasts (try the
apple pancakes or a ham-swiss-apple
omelette) at amazingly low prices.
(The latter isn't always true on
weekends, when you may find your
self ordering a "brunch" at inflated
prices). Finally, there's the favorite
morning meeting spot of Stanford
sororities: Dinah's Poolside Coffee
Shop (4269 El Camino Real, Palo
Alto; not to be confused with Dinah's
Shack, a mediocre restaurant next
door), which many people feel has
the best omelettes in the area.
Where the Cardinal flocks. Stanford
hangouts change from year to year, of
course, and I'm sure the newest ones
have escaped my attention, but there
are old standards. Half the people in
Ramona's on any given weekend
night will be from Stanford; the Stan
ford crush is particularly intense
before and after basketball games.
Most of them will be eating the
second-best pizza in the area,
while those who want to be
different chew on Calzone or decent
hamburgers. The once-great
Ramona's salad bar maintains only a
shade of its former glory. Down the
street at the Good Earth Restaurant
(185 University Ave., Palo Alto)
you'll find a different, slightly older,
Stanford crowd eating chic health
food. Of course, hangouts in the true
Stanford sense of the word are places
you go to swill beer, and there are a
couple of those: The Dutch Goose
(3567 Alameda de las Pulgas, Menlo
Park), a functional sort of place
where there's standing room only on
Senior Pub Nights, and The Oasis
Beer Garden (241 El Camino Real,
Menlo Park), a downright ugly place
that has been witness to untold
decades of Stanford history. Two
things you have to know: refer to
them as "the Goose" and"the O,"
respectively; and rest assured that
you will be carded at both establish

merits. If you like your nightlife a bit
rowdier, try St. James Infirmary (390
Moffet Blvd., Mountain View) or
Antonio's Nut House (321 California
Ave., Palo Alto), places where you
can get into a fight if you try hard
enough. In recent years an attempt
has been made to turn The Lan
cashire Tavern (547 Emerson St.,
Palo Alto) into a Stanford hangout of
the pub night variety, but it doesn't
seem to have fully caught on. A
morning alternative: the brunch
crowd at Hobee's. And don't forget
The New Varsity, especially when the
theater is showing Woody Allen
movies.
Why don't we pick the kind of food we
want? It's the familiar refrain: How
about Chinese? How about Mexican?
And it's easy to fall into around here,
because there are more ethnic restau
rants than you can shake a burrito or
a potsticker at. Most of them are bad
as you'd expect; here are a few of the
good ones.
Generations of Stanfordites have fal
len in love with the mu shu pork at
Chef Chu's (1067 North San Antonio
Road at El Camino Real, Los Altos).
This always crowded Mandarin res
taurant prepares perfectly solid, un
exciting dishes — it's the ideal place
for large groups with diverse tastes.
The food's more exciting at China
First (675 el Camino Real, Palo
Alto), another place with a large
reputation. The cuisine here is Szech
wan/Hunan, albeit not that spicy, and
there are great dishes on the menu; if
you go in looking like students, you
may have to put up with the waiter
sniffing at you.
On a more modest scale, there are
two worthwhile Chinese places in
Menlo Park; Yuen Yung (639 Santa
Cruz Ave.) and Su Hong (1039 El
Camino Real). Both are eclectic, but
primarily Cantonese/Mandarin. Su
Hong has better food, Yuen Yung
more interesting decor —it looks like
a cross between a Chinese restaurant
and a fern bar.
Palo Alto lost its only really good

Mexican restaurant when Andes
Mexican Restaurant, a Whiskey
Gulch anomaly, folded earlier this
year. Now a trip to Menlo Park or
Los Altos is required. Estrellita (971
North San Antonio Rd., Los Altos)
isn't what it used to be, but it still has
great chimichangas. There are two
passable family-type Mexican joints,
La Luna Mexican Cafe (1137
Chestnut St.) and Calela (1143 D
Crane St.). If you don't mind a drive,
the best Latin restaurant around is
probably El Calderon (699 El Cal
deron Ave., Mountain View), which
is hidden away in a small shopping
center and has a Mexican/Salvadoran
menu.
Places worth going to for French food.
Without going into too much detail,
there are two local French restaurants
that come close to meeting the bistro
ideal (good food, relatively low
prices): Le Pot au Feu (1149 El
Camino Real, Menlo Park) and A La
Carte Restaurant Francois (2310 El
Camino Real, Palo Alto). Somewhat
more formal, but still affordable, are
Pear Williams Restaurant Francais
(150 Middlefield Road, Menlo Park)
and Chez Louis (4170 El Camino

Real, Palo Alto). Most of the other
nearby French restaurants suffer
from some combination of preten
tiousness, over-pricing, bad service
and just plain poor food.
A place to go to for German food. The
only German restaurant I've dis
covered anywhere near campus is
the Black Forest Inn (376 First Street,
Los Altos). Meals are prepared
rather indifferently, but if you just
have to have some weinershnitzel
with red cabbage and potato
pancakes, this is the place to go.
Real burritos. Rosita's Taqueria
(171 A sth Ave., Redwood City) oc
cupies a storefront in an uninviting
part of Redwood City (a town know
for its uninviting parts) and makes the
only authentic burritos-to-go in the
area. These are big sloppy things that
can't be eaten while driving a car, and
they come in a wide selection, includ
ing pork and beef in several sauces,
steak, chicken, sausage and tongue.
Rosita's also has a good selection of
Mexican beers and soft drinks (you
haven't lived until you've had a Boing
soda).
Remember quiche? After fondue and
before pesto, there was quiche. The
Perfect Recipe (76 Stanford Shopping
Center) still serves this forgotten vic
tim of the gourmet wars, along with
cutesy sandwiches and good coffee; a
different quiche is served every day,
and you can count on a flakey crust
and perfect consistency. They don't
serve white wine, but you can still dig
your clogs out of the closet and
pretend Stanford is a shoo-in for a
bowl game (which last happened at
about the height of the quiche craze).
The best pizza within a half-hour of
Stanford. Frankie, Johnnie & Luigi,
Too (939 El Camino Real, Mountain
View) has no peer in pizza; what it
does have are 15-minute-to-an-hour
waits on weekends, which can fly by if
enough of you go and you drink


enough while waiting (if you look 21,
you'll be accosted by a roving cocktail
waitress the minute you sign in). Try
the fresh-tomato-and-garlic pizza, a
house specialty, and avoid the Italian
dinners, which are often dreadful. A
distant second to FJ&L is Ramona's
Restaurant (541 Ramona St., Palo
Alto), which has decent New York
style (i.e., heavy and spicy) pizza and
slightly shorter waits; it's 15 minutes
closer to campus. Honorable men
tion goes to pizza with barbecue
sauce (ladled on in place of tomato
sauce) at Jose's (2275 El Caniino
Real, Palo Alto).

It's 2 a.m. and I'm hungry and noth
ing's open. There used to be a wealth
of places you could go at 2 a.m. (or 4
a.m., or 6 a.m.) with the gang and be
obnoxious, or with a loved one to for
tify yourself for an emotional crisis,
or by yourself to study and grab a
burger. But Stickney's Flamingo first
cut back to midnight, and then
became a trendy Yuppie restaurant;
Luv's went to 24 hours on weekends
only, then became a singles dance
spot, and is now Atherton Joe's,
which is God only knows what. In the
old days, going to Denny's or Lyon's
didn't even cross your mind; now
they're all that's left. Closer (by about
a hundred yards) and friendlier is
Denny's (4256 El Camino Real, Palo
Alto), which is 10 minutes away at
two in the morning. Denny's is also
cheaper than Lyon's, it has tackier
vinyl (bright orange), and it has Ova,
the current all-star late-night
waitress. So why go to Lyon's (4298
El Camino Real, Los Altos) at all?
Because sometimes you need a
change. Lyon's is darker, the
waitresses are younger, and the meals
are bigger; if you're determined to
eat a lot of food at 4 and make your

self really sick, there's nothing like a
Mighty Lyon Burger.
The only competition left for these
corporate monsters is the University
Creamery (209 University Ave., Palo
Alto), which sensed the vacuum and
went to a 24-hour policy last spring.
The Creamery has pretty mediocre
greasy-spoon food, but the
milkshakes are great (they use Bud's
ice cream) and it's a lot closer to
campus (it's even within fairly easy
bicycle range).

Ice cream. We all love ice cream, but
no one can deny that the Stanford
area is drowning in the stuff. Within a
quick drive of campus are a Haagen-
Dazs (Stanford Barn, 700 Welch
Road), two Bud's (125 University
Ave., Palo Alto and 3590 Alameda
de las Pulgas, Menlo Park) and
various Swensen's and Baskin-
Robbins outlets, as well as the Italian

ice cream shops: Gelalo La
Romanina (1700 EI Camino Real,
Menlo Park), Tempo Gelato (2245 El
Camino Real, Palo Alto), Gelalo
Classico (Emerson St., downtown
Palo Alto), Bravo Fono (99Stanford
Shopping Center), et al. Two or three
more have probably opened since you
started reading this. If ice cream to
you means a soda fountain, try Edy's
(73 Town & Country Village, El-
Camino and Ambarcadero, Palo
Alto), or one of the downtown
creameries: Peninsula Creamery
(Hamilton Avenue and Emerson St.,
Palo Alto) and University Creamery
(209 University Ave., Palo Alto).
Spirits in the night. There are as
many different kinds of bars as there
are drinkers, and the most popular
ones — the Goose, the O, 42nd
Street, the BBC — are treated else
where in the article. I'm concerned
here with the bar as a comfortable en
vironment in which to drink, as
opposed to a supportive environment
in which to get drunk (or find your
soulmate).
The Gatehouse (265 Lytton Ave.,
Palo Alto) is a snitzy restaurant by
day and a snitzy bar by night, and one
of the nicest places to sit around in Palo
Alto. The bar at Mama's (379 Stan
ford Shopping Center) is a bit out of
the way, but it has a certain hushed
elegance that makes it attractive.
Henry's (482 University Ave., Palo
Alto) is hot and crowded once the
dinner customers clear out, but
there's no one on the make; just lots
of successful young Palo Altans hang
ing out in one of their favorite bars.
Another bar that has a "scene," but
isn't quite a singles bar, is that of the
New Varsity (456 University Ave.,
Palo Alto). Videos play above the
bar, musicians play in the courtyard,
and lots of Palo Alto High School
blondes and assorted Palo Alto punks
hang around out front. It's noisy and
crowded and uncomfortable on the
weekends, but the people-watching is

great. If you're looking for something
a little more staid, try the bar at the
rear of the London House (630
Ramona St., Palo Alto), a loving re
creation of an English pub where you
can get most any British beer you
want, pub snacks and a game of darts.

The singles scene. I've seen more than
my share of students (MBA and
otherwise) in these places. 42nd
Street (518 Bryant St. Palo Alto, in
the alley between Bryant and
Ramona) is either a dream come true
or a nightmare made real, depending
on your point of view. It's an ex
pensively tacky meat market with
great sight lines, where you'll find a
variety of hunters: tables of
frightened-looking Stanford students,
Palo Alto nouveau riche and lots of
secretaries. The action is much more
serious at the British Bankers Club
(1090 El Camino Real, Menlo Bowl),
which draws an older, richer crowd (it
goes in and out of fashion as a busi
ness school hangout) to its fake Ed
wardian digs. Coming on strong in
recent years has been Mac Arthur
Park (27 University Ave., Palo Alto,
next to the Palo Alto train station), a

favorite of young professional types,
which leads right into:
Where to go to feel like a Yuppie.

Dinah's Shack (4269 EI Camino
Real) is one of those inexplicably
popular restaurants — I can see why
little old ladies go there, but why in
God's name would anyone else want
to spend $10 for a lousy buffet and
the chance to hear "Feelings" played
on the harp? Ecco Ristorante (4290
El Camino Real, Palo Alto) right
across the street in the Hyatt Palo
Alto, may be the worst Italian restau
rant I've ever encountered, and the
green carpet doesn't help. King Chuan
(75 Town and Country Village, Palo
Alto) had, at last count, three differ
ent laudatory Stanford Daily reviews
posted in its window. Don't believe a
word of them.

Breakfast. Morning eaters are lucky
here — Palo Alto and Menlo Park
have a plethora of good restaurants
that specialize in breakfast and lunch.
First among equals is Late for the
Train (8561 Oak Grove Ave., Menlo
Park, near the train station), a folksy
place that makes great omelettes,
divine blintzes and fruit pancakes,
and the usual salads and sandwiches,
plus ever-changing desserts. If you go
on a weekend, particularly a Sunday,

expect at least a 45-minute wait; it's
best, if you can, to go for an early or
late weekday lunch, when you can of
ten be seated immediately. Modeled
along much the same lines is Hohee's
Haven (4224 El Camino Real, Palo
Alto, and Town and Country Vil
lage), a family operation with more
branches down the peninsula.
Hobee's follows more traditional
American breakfast lines — sausage,
eggs, ham — but isn't lacking for
fresh-squeezed juices, fruit, and other
California trimmings, and it has a
truly addictive coffee cake that comes
with most of the breakfasts. The

Farmer's Market (448 California
Ave., Palo Alto) has a small menu,
spotty service (semi-cafeteria style)
and the ambiance of a butcher shop,
but it serves great breakfasts (try the
apple pancakes or a ham-swiss-apple
omelette) at amazingly low prices.
(The latter isn't always true on
weekends, when you may find your
self ordering a "brunch" at inflated
prices). Finally, there's the favorite
morning meeting spot of Stanford
sororities: Dinah's Poolside Coffee
Shop (4269 El Camino Real, Palo
Alto; not to be confused with Dinah's
Shack, a mediocre restaurant next
door), which many people feel has
the best omelettes in the area.
Where the Cardinal flocks. Stanford
hangouts change from year to year, of
course, and I'm sure the newest ones
have escaped my attention, but there
are old standards. Half the people in
Ramona's on any given weekend
night will be from Stanford; the Stan
ford crush is particularly intense
before and after basketball games.
Most of them will be eating the
second-best pizza in the area,
while those who want to be
different chew on Calzone or decent
hamburgers. The once-great
Ramona's salad bar maintains only a
shade of its former glory. Down the
street at the Good Earth Restaurant
(185 University Ave., Palo Alto)
you'll find a different, slightly older,
Stanford crowd eating chic health
food. Of course, hangouts in the true
Stanford sense of the word are places
you go to swill beer, and there are a
couple of those: The Dutch Goose
(3567 Alameda de las Pulgas, Menlo
Park), a functional sort of place
where there's standing room only on
Senior Pub Nights, and The Oasis
Beer Garden (241 El Camino Real,
Menlo Park), a downright ugly place
that has been witness to untold
decades of Stanford history. Two
things you have to know: refer to
them as "the Goose" and"the O,"
respectively; and rest assured that
you will be carded at both establish

merits. If you like your nightlife a bit
rowdier, try St. James Infirmary (390
Moffet Blvd., Mountain View) or
Antonio's Nut House (321 California
Ave., Palo Alto), places where you
can get into a fight if you try hard
enough. In recent years an attempt
has been made to turn The Lan
cashire Tavern (547 Emerson St.,
Palo Alto) into a Stanford hangout of
the pub night variety, but it doesn't
seem to have fully caught on. A
morning alternative: the brunch
crowd at Hobee's. And don't forget
The New Varsity, especially when the
theater is showing Woody Allen
movies.
Why don't we pick the kind of food we
want? It's the familiar refrain: How
about Chinese? How about Mexican?
And it's easy to fall into around here,
because there are more ethnic restau
rants than you can shake a burrito or
a potsticker at. Most of them are bad
as you'd expect; here are a few of the
good ones.
Generations of Stanfordites have fal
len in love with the mu shu pork at
Chef Chu's (1067 North San Antonio
Road at El Camino Real, Los Altos).
This always crowded Mandarin res
taurant prepares perfectly solid, un
exciting dishes — it's the ideal place
for large groups with diverse tastes.
The food's more exciting at China
First (675 el Camino Real, Palo
Alto), another place with a large
reputation. The cuisine here is Szech
wan/Hunan, albeit not that spicy, and
there are great dishes on the menu; if
you go in looking like students, you
may have to put up with the waiter
sniffing at you.
On a more modest scale, there are
two worthwhile Chinese places in
Menlo Park; Yuen Yung (639 Santa
Cruz Ave.) and Su Hong (1039 El
Camino Real). Both are eclectic, but
primarily Cantonese/Mandarin. Su
Hong has better food, Yuen Yung
more interesting decor —it looks like
a cross between a Chinese restaurant
and a fern bar.
Palo Alto lost its only really good

Mexican restaurant when Andes
Mexican Restaurant, a Whiskey
Gulch anomaly, folded earlier this
year. Now a trip to Menlo Park or
Los Altos is required. Estrellita (971
North San Antonio Rd., Los Altos)
isn't what it used to be, but it still has
great chimichangas. There are two
passable family-type Mexican joints,
La Luna Mexican Cafe (1137
Chestnut St.) and Calela (1143 D
Crane St.). If you don't mind a drive,
the best Latin restaurant around is
probably El Calderon (699 El Cal
deron Ave., Mountain View), which
is hidden away in a small shopping
center and has a Mexican/Salvadoran
menu.
Places worth going to for French food.
Without going into too much detail,
there are two local French restaurants
that come close to meeting the bistro
ideal (good food, relatively low
prices): Le Pot au Feu (1149 El
Camino Real, Menlo Park) and A La
Carte Restaurant Francois (2310 El
Camino Real, Palo Alto). Somewhat
more formal, but still affordable, are
Pear Williams Restaurant Francais
(150 Middlefield Road, Menlo Park)
and Chez Louis (4170 El Camino

Real, Palo Alto). Most of the other
nearby French restaurants suffer
from some combination of preten
tiousness, over-pricing, bad service
and just plain poor food.
A place to go to for German food. The
only German restaurant I've dis
covered anywhere near campus is
the Black Forest Inn (376 First Street,
Los Altos). Meals are prepared
rather indifferently, but if you just
have to have some weinershnitzel
with red cabbage and potato
pancakes, this is the place to go.
Real burritos. Rosita's Taqueria
(171 A sth Ave., Redwood City) oc
cupies a storefront in an uninviting
part of Redwood City (a town know
for its uninviting parts) and makes the
only authentic burritos-to-go in the
area. These are big sloppy things that
can't be eaten while driving a car, and
they come in a wide selection, includ
ing pork and beef in several sauces,
steak, chicken, sausage and tongue.
Rosita's also has a good selection of
Mexican beers and soft drinks (you
haven't lived until you've had a Boing
soda).
Remember quiche? After fondue and
before pesto, there was quiche. The
Perfect Recipe (76 Stanford Shopping
Center) still serves this forgotten vic
tim of the gourmet wars, along with
cutesy sandwiches and good coffee; a
different quiche is served every day,
and you can count on a flakey crust
and perfect consistency. They don't
serve white wine, but you can still dig
your clogs out of the closet and
pretend Stanford is a shoo-in for a
bowl game (which last happened at
about the height of the quiche craze).
The best pizza within a half-hour of
Stanford. Frankie, Johnnie & Luigi,
Too (939 El Camino Real, Mountain
View) has no peer in pizza; what it
does have are 15-minute-to-an-hour
waits on weekends, which can fly by if
enough of you go and you drink


enough while waiting (if you look 21,
you'll be accosted by a roving cocktail
waitress the minute you sign in). Try
the fresh-tomato-and-garlic pizza, a
house specialty, and avoid the Italian
dinners, which are often dreadful. A
distant second to FJ&L is Ramona's
Restaurant (541 Ramona St., Palo
Alto), which has decent New York
style (i.e., heavy and spicy) pizza and
slightly shorter waits; it's 15 minutes
closer to campus. Honorable men
tion goes to pizza with barbecue
sauce (ladled on in place of tomato
sauce) at Jose's (2275 El Caniino
Real, Palo Alto).

It's 2 a.m. and I'm hungry and noth
ing's open. There used to be a wealth
of places you could go at 2 a.m. (or 4
a.m., or 6 a.m.) with the gang and be
obnoxious, or with a loved one to for
tify yourself for an emotional crisis,
or by yourself to study and grab a
burger. But Stickney's Flamingo first
cut back to midnight, and then
became a trendy Yuppie restaurant;
Luv's went to 24 hours on weekends
only, then became a singles dance
spot, and is now Atherton Joe's,
which is God only knows what. In the
old days, going to Denny's or Lyon's
didn't even cross your mind; now
they're all that's left. Closer (by about
a hundred yards) and friendlier is
Denny's (4256 El Camino Real, Palo
Alto), which is 10 minutes away at
two in the morning. Denny's is also
cheaper than Lyon's, it has tackier
vinyl (bright orange), and it has Ova,
the current all-star late-night
waitress. So why go to Lyon's (4298
El Camino Real, Los Altos) at all?
Because sometimes you need a
change. Lyon's is darker, the
waitresses are younger, and the meals
are bigger; if you're determined to
eat a lot of food at 4 and make your

self really sick, there's nothing like a
Mighty Lyon Burger.
The only competition left for these
corporate monsters is the University
Creamery (209 University Ave., Palo
Alto), which sensed the vacuum and
went to a 24-hour policy last spring.
The Creamery has pretty mediocre
greasy-spoon food, but the
milkshakes are great (they use Bud's
ice cream) and it's a lot closer to
campus (it's even within fairly easy
bicycle range).

Ice cream. We all love ice cream, but
no one can deny that the Stanford
area is drowning in the stuff. Within a
quick drive of campus are a Haagen-
Dazs (Stanford Barn, 700 Welch
Road), two Bud's (125 University
Ave., Palo Alto and 3590 Alameda
de las Pulgas, Menlo Park) and
various Swensen's and Baskin-
Robbins outlets, as well as the Italian

ice cream shops: Gelalo La
Romanina (1700 EI Camino Real,
Menlo Park), Tempo Gelato (2245 El
Camino Real, Palo Alto), Gelalo
Classico (Emerson St., downtown
Palo Alto), Bravo Fono (99Stanford
Shopping Center), et al. Two or three
more have probably opened since you
started reading this. If ice cream to
you means a soda fountain, try Edy's
(73 Town & Country Village, El-
Camino and Ambarcadero, Palo
Alto), or one of the downtown
creameries: Peninsula Creamery
(Hamilton Avenue and Emerson St.,
Palo Alto) and University Creamery
(209 University Ave., Palo Alto).
Spirits in the night. There are as
many different kinds of bars as there
are drinkers, and the most popular
ones — the Goose, the O, 42nd
Street, the BBC — are treated else
where in the article. I'm concerned
here with the bar as a comfortable en
vironment in which to drink, as
opposed to a supportive environment
in which to get drunk (or find your
soulmate).
The Gatehouse (265 Lytton Ave.,
Palo Alto) is a snitzy restaurant by
day and a snitzy bar by night, and one
of the nicest places to sit around in Palo
Alto. The bar at Mama's (379 Stan
ford Shopping Center) is a bit out of
the way, but it has a certain hushed
elegance that makes it attractive.
Henry's (482 University Ave., Palo
Alto) is hot and crowded once the
dinner customers clear out, but
there's no one on the make; just lots
of successful young Palo Altans hang
ing out in one of their favorite bars.
Another bar that has a "scene," but
isn't quite a singles bar, is that of the
New Varsity (456 University Ave.,
Palo Alto). Videos play above the
bar, musicians play in the courtyard,
and lots of Palo Alto High School
blondes and assorted Palo Alto punks
hang around out front. It's noisy and
crowded and uncomfortable on the
weekends, but the people-watching is

great. If you're looking for something
a little more staid, try the bar at the
rear of the London House (630
Ramona St., Palo Alto), a loving re
creation of an English pub where you
can get most any British beer you
want, pub snacks and a game of darts.

The singles scene. I've seen more than
my share of students (MBA and
otherwise) in these places. 42nd
Street (518 Bryant St. Palo Alto, in
the alley between Bryant and
Ramona) is either a dream come true
or a nightmare made real, depending
on your point of view. It's an ex
pensively tacky meat market with
great sight lines, where you'll find a
variety of hunters: tables of
frightened-looking Stanford students,
Palo Alto nouveau riche and lots of
secretaries. The action is much more
serious at the British Bankers Club
(1090 El Camino Real, Menlo Bowl),
which draws an older, richer crowd (it
goes in and out of fashion as a busi
ness school hangout) to its fake Ed
wardian digs. Coming on strong in
recent years has been Mac Arthur
Park (27 University Ave., Palo Alto,
next to the Palo Alto train station), a

favorite of young professional types,
which leads right into:
Where to go to feel like a Yuppie.
style is everything in a Yuppie hang
out, and Mac Arthur Park one of
the approved styles: big, open, white-

paneled spaces, wood floor, railings
everywhere. The food ranges from
mediocre to bad (be sure to
order something from the grill),
but what does it matter when you can
get potato skins and eight wines by
the glass? Another style is represen
ted by Waverley Place (560 Waverley
St., Palo Alto), new to downtown
Palo Alto, which is all glass and
bleached wood and expensive (but
surprisingly good) pastas and seafood
dishes. Along with these upstarts, a
couple of established Palo Alto res
taurants have swung with the times:
The Gatehouse (265 Lytton Ave.),
one of Palo Alto's prettiest places to
eat and drink, is taken over by the
young after the dinner hour, and
Henry's (482 University Ave.) is a fa
vorite with the local advertis
ing/design community that lives off
Silicon Valley.


Silliest wine list in town. At the
above-mentioned Waverley Place,
you can get a young Rothschild
or Chateau Petrus, hut there won't be
anything worth drinking for under
$20.
True romance. Everyone has his own
idea of the perfect surroundings in
which to let love flower, but each of
the following is romantic in its own
way. Bella Vista (13451 Skyline
Blvd., Woodside) has a gorgeous
view; it nestles in the redwoods atop
the Skyline ridge, and if you're lucky
you'll get a candlelit table by the win
dow that looks out over the bay.
Tuxedoed waiters and picturesque lo
cals in Jaguars complete the picture.
St. Michael's Alley (800 Emerson St.,
Palo Alto) is a little crowded and a
little noisy, but it has an air of sophis
tication unusual in Palo Alto, to go
with its eclectic continental menu
(you'll eat as well here as anywhere in
town). Sundance Mine Company
(1921 El Camino Real, Palo Alto)
isn't to everyone's taste; it has a
boring steak-and-seafood menu, it's
overpriced, and it takes itself awfully
seriously. But we're talking atmo
sphere here, and if you're in the right
feeling-like-an-adult mood, Sun
dance, with its state-of-the-art
green/brown wood/cut-glass interior,
has it to burn. And many a Stanford
couple holds fond memories of Flea
Street Cafe (3607 Alameda de las
Pulgas, Menlo Park, two doors from
the Dutch Goose), a low-key little
place with excellent avant-veggie
food.
Seafood. The Fish Market (3150 El
Camino Real, Palo Alto) has long
been Palo Alto's most popular spot
for seafood, and it generally deserves

to be. It was way ahead of the
mesquite-grill, fresh-special game,
and the high school kids who do the
grilling get it right most of the time.
There's also friendly, informal service
from an army of T-shirt-clad young
waitresses. The lines can be long on
weekends, but there's an outdoor
patio, drinks while you wait, and an
oyster/seafood cocktail bar to help
pass the time. Scott's Seafood Grill eft
Bar (2300 East Bayshore at Embar
cadero, Palo Alto) has given The Fish
Market a run for its money since
opening four years ago, but it's at
tractive mainly as a place to be seen;
the fish is overcooked about half the
time, the service can be shoddy, and
the prices are way out of line.
Places to get "California Cuisine."
There are no restaurants in the
vicinity of campus that could be
called innovative, but there are some
with Berkeley-gourmet trappings.
Fresco (3398 El Camino Real, Palo
Alto) is a corporate version of the the
California ideal (it's run by the
Mac Arthur Park/Prego/Ciao
combine), serving pastas and grilled
fish cooked with various combination
of sundried tomatos, basil and red
peppers, along with composed salads
and the obligatory grilled meats
(lamb and steak). It's a pleasant, rea
sonably priced place with perfectly
well-prepared, but boring, food.
Smaller and chicer is Theo's (546
University Ave., Palo Alto), which
has a more conservative, steakhouse
type of menu but a better wine list
(wine being all-important in this type
of restaurant).
Hamburgers. Kirk's (361 California
Ave., Palo Alto) has great

hamburgers, but they're not for the
faint-hearted. Ask for your
steakburger well-done if you don't
want it raw. The burgers at Kirk's are
cooked over a charcoal grill while you
wait; there's nothing else to eat but
potato chips and some packaged
salads, but this is a small point when
you're getting one of the last of the
real hamburgers. A close second in
the hamburger derby is the Alpine
Beer Garden (3915 Alpine road, Por
tola Valley), also known as the
Alpine Inn or as Rosotti's or, most
commonly, as Zott's. This is an old
time roadhouse where bikers and the
local Ford truck crowd mingle freely
with the Mercedes/BMW set, all
drinking pitchers of Henry's and
Anchor Steam at picnic tables in the
vast, dusty patio out back. The
burgers here are cooked on an
electric grill, but they're good-sized
and the trimmings are excellent:
sourdough French rolls, fresh lettuce
and-tomato setups. A hamburger and
beer on the patio at Zott's on a sunny
(but not too hot) day is what Califor
nia is all about.
Where to go with your bank card.
Some of the most expensive restau
rants around are: The Village Pub
(2967 Woodside Road, Woodside),
La Tour (525 University Ave., Palo
Alto), Maddalena's (544 emerson St.,
Palo Alto), Chantilly (530 Ramona
St., Palo Alto) and Hugo's Market
(4219 El Camino Real, Palo Alto, at
Rickey's Hyatt). Several of these
places have truly bad food, but your
pocketbook won't know the differ
ence.
Places to hear music. There are a few
places nearby where you can catch a

band while sitting down. Just a few.
The New Varsity (45b University
Ave., Palo Alto), a restaurant/art
house movie theater/bar/Palo Alto
High hangout, has live music in its
front courtyard most nights. Among
the regulars are Tuck and Patti, an
extremely popular local jazz
guitar/vocalist duo, and some of the
second-rank Windham Hill artists,
particularly Michael Hedges. Be
warned: On the weekends the
alienated teens of Palo Alto descend
on the New Varsity and hang out on
the sidewalk in front; you'll have to
walk their gauntlet to get in, espe
cially if something like
"Ouadrophenia" is playing as the
midnight show. St. Michael's Alley
has an adjoining cafe where music,
often folk, is performed on
weekends; the cafe, called St. Mi
chael's Waiting Room, has some of
the best pastries in town along with
wines and sherries by the glass, beer,
and all other things liquid. Adlai Al
exander, an ex-stalwart of several
campus bands, plays The Gatehouse
on Wednesday and Saturday
evenings; Alexander is an accom
plished jazz guitarist and a sometimes
amazing singer. If you like your music
with more of a participatory edge, try
the piano bar at Chez Louis, where
Roger Cowger might let you take
microphone in hand and wow the
crowd with your own impassioned
version of "The Impossible Dream."
And finally, check the weekly listings
for the Keystone Palo Alto (260 Cali
fornia Ave.), a disastrously uncom
fortable, hot, smoky, loud nightclub
with overpriced, watered-down
drinks where in the course of the last
four years you could have caught Neil
Young, Warren Zevon, The Band,
Jackson Browne, Bruce Springsteen

is hidden away in a small shopping
center and has a Mexican/Salvadoran
menu.
Places worth going to for French food.
Without going into too much detail,
there are two local French restaurants
that come close to meeting the bistro
ideal (good food, relatively low
prices): Le Pot au Feu (1149 El
Camino Real, Menlo Park) and A La
Carte Restaurant Francois (2310 El
Camino Real, Palo Alto). Somewhat
more formal, but still affordable, are
Pear Williams Restaurant Francais
(150 Middlefield Road, Menlo Park)
and Chez Louis (4170 El Camino

Real, Palo Alto). Most of the other
nearby French restaurants suffer
from some combination of preten
tiousness, over-pricing, bad service
and just plain poor food.
A place to go to for German food. The
only German restaurant I've dis
covered anywhere near campus is
the Black Forest Inn (376 First Street,
Los Altos). Meals are prepared
rather indifferently, but if you just
have to have some weinershnitzel
with red cabbage and potato
pancakes, this is the place to go.
Real burritos. Rosita's Taqueria
(171 A sth Ave., Redwood City) oc
cupies a storefront in an uninviting
part of Redwood City (a town know
for its uninviting parts) and makes the
only authentic burritos-to-go in the
area. These are big sloppy things that
can't be eaten while driving a car, and
they come in a wide selection, includ
ing pork and beef in several sauces,
steak, chicken, sausage and tongue.
Rosita's also has a good selection of
Mexican beers and soft drinks (you
haven't lived until you've had a Boing
soda).
Remember quiche? After fondue and
before pesto, there was quiche. The
Perfect Recipe (76 Stanford Shopping
Center) still serves this forgotten vic
tim of the gourmet wars, along with
cutesy sandwiches and good coffee; a
different quiche is served every day,
and you can count on a flakey crust
and perfect consistency. They don't
serve white wine, but you can still dig
your clogs out of the closet and
pretend Stanford is a shoo-in for a
bowl game (which last happened at
about the height of the quiche craze).
The best pizza within a half-hour of
Stanford. Frankie, Johnnie & Luigi,
Too (939 El Camino Real, Mountain
View) has no peer in pizza; what it
does have are 15-minute-to-an-hour
waits on weekends, which can fly by if
enough of you go and you drink


enough while waiting (if you look 21,
you'll be accosted by a roving cocktail
waitress the minute you sign in). Try
the fresh-tomato-and-garlic pizza, a
house specialty, and avoid the Italian
dinners, which are often dreadful. A
distant second to FJ&L is Ramona's
Restaurant (541 Ramona St., Palo
Alto), which has decent New York
style (i.e., heavy and spicy) pizza and
slightly shorter waits; it's 15 minutes
closer to campus. Honorable men
tion goes to pizza with barbecue
sauce (ladled on in place of tomato
sauce) at Jose's (2275 El Caniino
Real, Palo Alto).

It's 2 a.m. and I'm hungry and noth
ing's open. There used to be a wealth
of places you could go at 2 a.m. (or 4
a.m., or 6 a.m.) with the gang and be
obnoxious, or with a loved one to for
tify yourself for an emotional crisis,
or by yourself to study and grab a
burger. But Stickney's Flamingo first
cut back to midnight, and then
became a trendy Yuppie restaurant;
Luv's went to 24 hours on weekends
only, then became a singles dance
spot, and is now Atherton Joe's,
which is God only knows what. In the
old days, going to Denny's or Lyon's
didn't even cross your mind; now
they're all that's left. Closer (by about
a hundred yards) and friendlier is
Denny's (4256 El Camino Real, Palo
Alto), which is 10 minutes away at
two in the morning. Denny's is also
cheaper than Lyon's, it has tackier
vinyl (bright orange), and it has Ova,
the current all-star late-night
waitress. So why go to Lyon's (4298
El Camino Real, Los Altos) at all?
Because sometimes you need a
change. Lyon's is darker, the
waitresses are younger, and the meals
are bigger; if you're determined to
eat a lot of food at 4 and make your

self really sick, there's nothing like a
Mighty Lyon Burger.
The only competition left for these
corporate monsters is the University
Creamery (209 University Ave., Palo
Alto), which sensed the vacuum and
went to a 24-hour policy last spring.
The Creamery has pretty mediocre
greasy-spoon food, but the
milkshakes are great (they use Bud's
ice cream) and it's a lot closer to
campus (it's even within fairly easy
bicycle range).

Ice cream. We all love ice cream, but
no one can deny that the Stanford
area is drowning in the stuff. Within a
quick drive of campus are a Haagen-
Dazs (Stanford Barn, 700 Welch
Road), two Bud's (125 University
Ave., Palo Alto and 3590 Alameda
de las Pulgas, Menlo Park) and
various Swensen's and Baskin-
Robbins outlets, as well as the Italian

ice cream shops: Gelalo La
Romanina (1700 EI Camino Real,
Menlo Park), Tempo Gelato (2245 El
Camino Real, Palo Alto), Gelalo
Classico (Emerson St., downtown
Palo Alto), Bravo Fono (99Stanford
Shopping Center), et al. Two or three
more have probably opened since you
started reading this. If ice cream to
you means a soda fountain, try Edy's
(73 Town & Country Village, El-
Camino and Ambarcadero, Palo
Alto), or one of the downtown
creameries: Peninsula Creamery
(Hamilton Avenue and Emerson St.,
Palo Alto) and University Creamery
(209 University Ave., Palo Alto).
Spirits in the night. There are as
many different kinds of bars as there
are drinkers, and the most popular
ones — the Goose, the O, 42nd
Street, the BBC — are treated else
where in the article. I'm concerned
here with the bar as a comfortable en
vironment in which to drink, as
opposed to a supportive environment
in which to get drunk (or find your
soulmate).
The Gatehouse (265 Lytton Ave.,
Palo Alto) is a snitzy restaurant by
day and a snitzy bar by night, and one
of the nicest places to sit around in Palo
Alto. The bar at Mama's (379 Stan
ford Shopping Center) is a bit out of
the way, but it has a certain hushed
elegance that makes it attractive.
Henry's (482 University Ave., Palo
Alto) is hot and crowded once the
dinner customers clear out, but
there's no one on the make; just lots
of successful young Palo Altans hang
ing out in one of their favorite bars.
Another bar that has a "scene," but
isn't quite a singles bar, is that of the
New Varsity (456 University Ave.,
Palo Alto). Videos play above the
bar, musicians play in the courtyard,
and lots of Palo Alto High School
blondes and assorted Palo Alto punks
hang around out front. It's noisy and
crowded and uncomfortable on the
weekends, but the people-watching is

great. If you're looking for something
a little more staid, try the bar at the
rear of the London House (630
Ramona St., Palo Alto), a loving re
creation of an English pub where you
can get most any British beer you
want, pub snacks and a game of darts.

The singles scene. I've seen more than
my share of students (MBA and
otherwise) in these places. 42nd
Street (518 Bryant St. Palo Alto, in
the alley between Bryant and
Ramona) is either a dream come true
or a nightmare made real, depending
on your point of view. It's an ex
pensively tacky meat market with
great sight lines, where you'll find a
variety of hunters: tables of
frightened-looking Stanford students,
Palo Alto nouveau riche and lots of
secretaries. The action is much more
serious at the British Bankers Club
(1090 El Camino Real, Menlo Bowl),
which draws an older, richer crowd (it
goes in and out of fashion as a busi
ness school hangout) to its fake Ed
wardian digs. Coming on strong in
recent years has been Mac Arthur
Park (27 University Ave., Palo Alto,
next to the Palo Alto train station), a

favorite of young professional types,
which leads right into:
Where to go to feel like a Yuppie.
style is everything in a Yuppie hang
out, and Mac Arthur Park one of
the approved styles: big, open, white-

paneled spaces, wood floor, railings
everywhere. The food ranges from
mediocre to bad (be sure to
order something from the grill),
but what does it matter when you can
get potato skins and eight wines by
the glass? Another style is represen
ted by Waverley Place (560 Waverley
St., Palo Alto), new to downtown
Palo Alto, which is all glass and
bleached wood and expensive (but
surprisingly good) pastas and seafood
dishes. Along with these upstarts, a
couple of established Palo Alto res
taurants have swung with the times:
The Gatehouse (265 Lytton Ave.),
one of Palo Alto's prettiest places to
eat and drink, is taken over by the
young after the dinner hour, and
Henry's (482 University Ave.) is a fa
vorite with the local advertis
ing/design community that lives off
Silicon Valley.


Silliest wine list in town. At the
above-mentioned Waverley Place,
you can get a young Rothschild
or Chateau Petrus, hut there won't be
anything worth drinking for under
$20.
True romance. Everyone has his own
idea of the perfect surroundings in
which to let love flower, but each of
the following is romantic in its own
way. Bella Vista (13451 Skyline
Blvd., Woodside) has a gorgeous
view; it nestles in the redwoods atop
the Skyline ridge, and if you're lucky
you'll get a candlelit table by the win
dow that looks out over the bay.
Tuxedoed waiters and picturesque lo
cals in Jaguars complete the picture.
St. Michael's Alley (800 Emerson St.,
Palo Alto) is a little crowded and a
little noisy, but it has an air of sophis
tication unusual in Palo Alto, to go
with its eclectic continental menu
(you'll eat as well here as anywhere in
town). Sundance Mine Company
(1921 El Camino Real, Palo Alto)
isn't to everyone's taste; it has a
boring steak-and-seafood menu, it's
overpriced, and it takes itself awfully
seriously. But we're talking atmo
sphere here, and if you're in the right
feeling-like-an-adult mood, Sun
dance, with its state-of-the-art
green/brown wood/cut-glass interior,
has it to burn. And many a Stanford
couple holds fond memories of Flea
Street Cafe (3607 Alameda de las
Pulgas, Menlo Park, two doors from
the Dutch Goose), a low-key little
place with excellent avant-veggie
food.
Seafood. The Fish Market (3150 El
Camino Real, Palo Alto) has long
been Palo Alto's most popular spot
for seafood, and it generally deserves

to be. It was way ahead of the
mesquite-grill, fresh-special game,
and the high school kids who do the
grilling get it right most of the time.
There's also friendly, informal service
from an army of T-shirt-clad young
waitresses. The lines can be long on
weekends, but there's an outdoor
patio, drinks while you wait, and an
oyster/seafood cocktail bar to help
pass the time. Scott's Seafood Grill eft
Bar (2300 East Bayshore at Embar
cadero, Palo Alto) has given The Fish
Market a run for its money since
opening four years ago, but it's at
tractive mainly as a place to be seen;
the fish is overcooked about half the
time, the service can be shoddy, and
the prices are way out of line.
Places to get "California Cuisine."
There are no restaurants in the
vicinity of campus that could be
called innovative, but there are some
with Berkeley-gourmet trappings.
Fresco (3398 El Camino Real, Palo
Alto) is a corporate version of the the
California ideal (it's run by the
Mac Arthur Park/Prego/Ciao
combine), serving pastas and grilled
fish cooked with various combination
of sundried tomatos, basil and red
peppers, along with composed salads
and the obligatory grilled meats
(lamb and steak). It's a pleasant, rea
sonably priced place with perfectly
well-prepared, but boring, food.
Smaller and chicer is Theo's (546
University Ave., Palo Alto), which
has a more conservative, steakhouse
type of menu but a better wine list
(wine being all-important in this type
of restaurant).
Hamburgers. Kirk's (361 California
Ave., Palo Alto) has great

hamburgers, but they're not for the
faint-hearted. Ask for your
steakburger well-done if you don't
want it raw. The burgers at Kirk's are
cooked over a charcoal grill while you
wait; there's nothing else to eat but
potato chips and some packaged
salads, but this is a small point when
you're getting one of the last of the
real hamburgers. A close second in
the hamburger derby is the Alpine
Beer Garden (3915 Alpine road, Por
tola Valley), also known as the
Alpine Inn or as Rosotti's or, most
commonly, as Zott's. This is an old
time roadhouse where bikers and the
local Ford truck crowd mingle freely
with the Mercedes/BMW set, all
drinking pitchers of Henry's and
Anchor Steam at picnic tables in the
vast, dusty patio out back. The
burgers here are cooked on an
electric grill, but they're good-sized
and the trimmings are excellent:
sourdough French rolls, fresh lettuce
and-tomato setups. A hamburger and
beer on the patio at Zott's on a sunny
(but not too hot) day is what Califor
nia is all about.
Where to go with your bank card.
Some of the most expensive restau
rants around are: The Village Pub
(2967 Woodside Road, Woodside),
La Tour (525 University Ave., Palo
Alto), Maddalena's (544 emerson St.,
Palo Alto), Chantilly (530 Ramona
St., Palo Alto) and Hugo's Market
(4219 El Camino Real, Palo Alto, at
Rickey's Hyatt). Several of these
places have truly bad food, but your
pocketbook won't know the differ
ence.
Places to hear music. There are a few
places nearby where you can catch a

band while sitting down. Just a few.
The New Varsity (45b University
Ave., Palo Alto), a restaurant/art
house movie theater/bar/Palo Alto
High hangout, has live music in its
front courtyard most nights. Among
the regulars are Tuck and Patti, an
extremely popular local jazz
guitar/vocalist duo, and some of the
second-rank Windham Hill artists,
particularly Michael Hedges. Be
warned: On the weekends the
alienated teens of Palo Alto descend
on the New Varsity and hang out on
the sidewalk in front; you'll have to
walk their gauntlet to get in, espe
cially if something like
"Ouadrophenia" is playing as the
midnight show. St. Michael's Alley
has an adjoining cafe where music,
often folk, is performed on
weekends; the cafe, called St. Mi
chael's Waiting Room, has some of
the best pastries in town along with
wines and sherries by the glass, beer,
and all other things liquid. Adlai Al
exander, an ex-stalwart of several
campus bands, plays The Gatehouse
on Wednesday and Saturday
evenings; Alexander is an accom
plished jazz guitarist and a sometimes
amazing singer. If you like your music
with more of a participatory edge, try
the piano bar at Chez Louis, where
Roger Cowger might let you take
microphone in hand and wow the
crowd with your own impassioned
version of "The Impossible Dream."
And finally, check the weekly listings
for the Keystone Palo Alto (260 Cali
fornia Ave.), a disastrously uncom
fortable, hot, smoky, loud nightclub
with overpriced, watered-down
drinks where in the course of the last
four years you could have caught Neil
Young, Warren Zevon, The Band,
Jackson Browne, Bruce Springsteen

jumping up on stage with Clarence
demons and the Red Bank Rockers
Avoid at all costs. Sometime while
you're here someone will suggest
going to one of these restaurants.
Politely tell him/her you'd rather un
dergo root canal work.

Dinah's Shack (4269 EI Camino
Real) is one of those inexplicably
popular restaurants — I can see why
little old ladies go there, but why in
God's name would anyone else want
to spend $10 for a lousy buffet and
the chance to hear "Feelings" played
on the harp? Ecco Ristorante (4290
El Camino Real, Palo Alto) right
across the street in the Hyatt Palo
Alto, may be the worst Italian restau
rant I've ever encountered, and the
green carpet doesn't help. King Chuan
(75 Town and Country Village, Palo
Alto) had, at last count, three differ
ent laudatory Stanford Daily reviews
posted in its window. Don't believe a
word of them.

Breakfast. Morning eaters are lucky
here — Palo Alto and Menlo Park
have a plethora of good restaurants
that specialize in breakfast and lunch.
First among equals is Late for the
Train (8561 Oak Grove Ave., Menlo
Park, near the train station), a folksy
place that makes great omelettes,
divine blintzes and fruit pancakes,
and the usual salads and sandwiches,
plus ever-changing desserts. If you go
on a weekend, particularly a Sunday,

expect at least a 45-minute wait; it's
best, if you can, to go for an early or
late weekday lunch, when you can of
ten be seated immediately. Modeled
along much the same lines is Hohee's
Haven (4224 El Camino Real, Palo
Alto, and Town and Country Vil
lage), a family operation with more
branches down the peninsula.
Hobee's follows more traditional
American breakfast lines — sausage,
eggs, ham — but isn't lacking for
fresh-squeezed juices, fruit, and other
California trimmings, and it has a
truly addictive coffee cake that comes
with most of the breakfasts. The

Farmer's Market (448 California
Ave., Palo Alto) has a small menu,
spotty service (semi-cafeteria style)
and the ambiance of a butcher shop,
but it serves great breakfasts (try the
apple pancakes or a ham-swiss-apple
omelette) at amazingly low prices.
(The latter isn't always true on
weekends, when you may find your
self ordering a "brunch" at inflated
prices). Finally, there's the favorite
morning meeting spot of Stanford
sororities: Dinah's Poolside Coffee
Shop (4269 El Camino Real, Palo
Alto; not to be confused with Dinah's
Shack, a mediocre restaurant next
door), which many people feel has
the best omelettes in the area.
Where the Cardinal flocks. Stanford
hangouts change from year to year, of
course, and I'm sure the newest ones
have escaped my attention, but there
are old standards. Half the people in
Ramona's on any given weekend
night will be from Stanford; the Stan
ford crush is particularly intense
before and after basketball games.
Most of them will be eating the
second-best pizza in the area,
while those who want to be
different chew on Calzone or decent
hamburgers. The once-great
Ramona's salad bar maintains only a
shade of its former glory. Down the
street at the Good Earth Restaurant
(185 University Ave., Palo Alto)
you'll find a different, slightly older,
Stanford crowd eating chic health
food. Of course, hangouts in the true
Stanford sense of the word are places
you go to swill beer, and there are a
couple of those: The Dutch Goose
(3567 Alameda de las Pulgas, Menlo
Park), a functional sort of place
where there's standing room only on
Senior Pub Nights, and The Oasis
Beer Garden (241 El Camino Real,
Menlo Park), a downright ugly place
that has been witness to untold
decades of Stanford history. Two
things you have to know: refer to
them as "the Goose" and"the O,"
respectively; and rest assured that
you will be carded at both establish

merits. If you like your nightlife a bit
rowdier, try St. James Infirmary (390
Moffet Blvd., Mountain View) or
Antonio's Nut House (321 California
Ave., Palo Alto), places where you
can get into a fight if you try hard
enough. In recent years an attempt
has been made to turn The Lan
cashire Tavern (547 Emerson St.,
Palo Alto) into a Stanford hangout of
the pub night variety, but it doesn't
seem to have fully caught on. A
morning alternative: the brunch
crowd at Hobee's. And don't forget
The New Varsity, especially when the
theater is showing Woody Allen
movies.
Why don't we pick the kind of food we
want? It's the familiar refrain: How
about Chinese? How about Mexican?
And it's easy to fall into around here,
because there are more ethnic restau
rants than you can shake a burrito or
a potsticker at. Most of them are bad
as you'd expect; here are a few of the
good ones.
Generations of Stanfordites have fal
len in love with the mu shu pork at
Chef Chu's (1067 North San Antonio
Road at El Camino Real, Los Altos).
This always crowded Mandarin res
taurant prepares perfectly solid, un
exciting dishes — it's the ideal place
for large groups with diverse tastes.
The food's more exciting at China
First (675 el Camino Real, Palo
Alto), another place with a large
reputation. The cuisine here is Szech
wan/Hunan, albeit not that spicy, and
there are great dishes on the menu; if
you go in looking like students, you
may have to put up with the waiter
sniffing at you.
On a more modest scale, there are
two worthwhile Chinese places in
Menlo Park; Yuen Yung (639 Santa
Cruz Ave.) and Su Hong (1039 El
Camino Real). Both are eclectic, but
primarily Cantonese/Mandarin. Su
Hong has better food, Yuen Yung
more interesting decor —it looks like
a cross between a Chinese restaurant
and a fern bar.
Palo Alto lost its only really good

Mexican restaurant when Andes
Mexican Restaurant, a Whiskey
Gulch anomaly, folded earlier this
year. Now a trip to Menlo Park or
Los Altos is required. Estrellita (971
North San Antonio Rd., Los Altos)
isn't what it used to be, but it still has
great chimichangas. There are two
passable family-type Mexican joints,
La Luna Mexican Cafe (1137
Chestnut St.) and Calela (1143 D
Crane St.). If you don't mind a drive,
the best Latin restaurant around is
probably El Calderon (699 El Cal
deron Ave., Mountain View), which
is hidden away in a small shopping
center and has a Mexican/Salvadoran
menu.
Places worth going to for French food.
Without going into too much detail,
there are two local French restaurants
that come close to meeting the bistro
ideal (good food, relatively low
prices): Le Pot au Feu (1149 El

(150 Middlefield Road, Menlo Park)
and Chez Louis (4170 El Camino

nearby French restaurants suffer
from some combination of preten
tiousness, over-pricing, bad service
and just plain poor food.
A place to go to for German food. The
only German restaurant I've dis
covered anywhere near campus is
the Black Forest Inn (376 First Street,

Palo Alto). Videos play above the
bar, musicians play in the courtyard,
and lots of Palo Alto High School
blondes and assorted Palo Alto punks
hang around out front. It's noisy and
crowded and uncomfortable on the
weekends, but the people-watching is

great. If you're looking for something
a little more staid, try the bar at the
rear of the London House (630
Ramona St., Palo Alto), a loving re
creation of an English pub where you
can get most any British beer you
want, pub snacks and a game of darts.

The singles scene. I've seen more than
my share of students (MBA and
otherwise) in these places. 42nd
Street (518 Bryant St. Palo Alto, in
the alley between Bryant and
Ramona) is either a dream come true
or a nightmare made real, depending
on your point of view. It's an ex
pensively tacky meat market with
great sight lines, where you'll find a
variety of hunters: tables of
frightened-looking Stanford students,
Palo Alto nouveau riche and lots of
secretaries. The action is much more
serious at the British Bankers Club
(1090 El Camino Real, Menlo Bowl),
which draws an older, richer crowd (it
goes in and out of fashion as a busi
ness school hangout) to its fake Ed
wardian digs. Coming on strong in
recent years has been Mac Arthur
Park (27 University Ave., Palo Alto,
next to the Palo Alto train station), a

favorite of young professional types,
which leads right into:
Where to go to feel like a Yuppie.
style is everything in a Yuppie hang
out, and Mac Arthur Park one of
the approved styles: big, open, white-

paneled spaces, wood floor, railings
everywhere. The food ranges from
mediocre to bad (be sure to
order something from the grill),
but what does it matter when you can
get potato skins and eight wines by
the glass? Another style is represen
ted by Waverley Place (560 Waverley
St., Palo Alto), new to downtown
Palo Alto, which is all glass and
bleached wood and expensive (but
surprisingly good) pastas and seafood
dishes. Along with these upstarts, a
couple of established Palo Alto res
taurants have swung with the times:
The Gatehouse (265 Lytton Ave.),
one of Palo Alto's prettiest places to
eat and drink, is taken over by the
young after the dinner hour, and
Henry's (482 University Ave.) is a fa
vorite with the local advertis
ing/design community that lives off
Silicon Valley.


Silliest wine list in town. At the
above-mentioned Waverley Place,
you can get a young Rothschild
or Chateau Petrus, hut there won't be
anything worth drinking for under
$20.
True romance. Everyone has his own
idea of the perfect surroundings in
which to let love flower, but each of
the following is romantic in its own
way. Bella Vista (13451 Skyline
Blvd., Woodside) has a gorgeous
view; it nestles in the redwoods atop
the Skyline ridge, and if you're lucky
you'll get a candlelit table by the win
dow that looks out over the bay.
Tuxedoed waiters and picturesque lo
cals in Jaguars complete the picture.
St. Michael's Alley (800 Emerson St.,
Palo Alto) is a little crowded and a
little noisy, but it has an air of sophis
tication unusual in Palo Alto, to go
with its eclectic continental menu
(you'll eat as well here as anywhere in
town). Sundance Mine Company
(1921 El Camino Real, Palo Alto)
isn't to everyone's taste; it has a
boring steak-and-seafood menu, it's
overpriced, and it takes itself awfully
seriously. But we're talking atmo
sphere here, and if you're in the right
feeling-like-an-adult mood, Sun
dance, with its state-of-the-art
green/brown wood/cut-glass interior,
has it to burn. And many a Stanford
couple holds fond memories of Flea
Street Cafe (3607 Alameda de las
Pulgas, Menlo Park, two doors from
the Dutch Goose), a low-key little
place with excellent avant-veggie
food.
Seafood. The Fish Market (3150 El
Camino Real, Palo Alto) has long
been Palo Alto's most popular spot
for seafood, and it generally deserves

to be. It was way ahead of the
mesquite-grill, fresh-special game,
and the high school kids who do the
grilling get it right most of the time.
There's also friendly, informal service
from an army of T-shirt-clad young
waitresses. The lines can be long on
weekends, but there's an outdoor
patio, drinks while you wait, and an
oyster/seafood cocktail bar to help
pass the time. Scott's Seafood Grill eft
Bar (2300 East Bayshore at Embar
cadero, Palo Alto) has given The Fish
Market a run for its money since
opening four years ago, but it's at
tractive mainly as a place to be seen;
the fish is overcooked about half the
time, the service can be shoddy, and
the prices are way out of line.
Places to get "California Cuisine."
There are no restaurants in the
vicinity of campus that could be
called innovative, but there are some
with Berkeley-gourmet trappings.
Fresco (3398 El Camino Real, Palo
Alto) is a corporate version of the the
California ideal (it's run by the
Mac Arthur Park/Prego/Ciao
combine), serving pastas and grilled
fish cooked with various combination
of sundried tomatos, basil and red
peppers, along with composed salads
and the obligatory grilled meats
(lamb and steak). It's a pleasant, rea
sonably priced place with perfectly
well-prepared, but boring, food.
Smaller and chicer is Theo's (546
University Ave., Palo Alto), which
has a more conservative, steakhouse
type of menu but a better wine list
(wine being all-important in this type
of restaurant).
Hamburgers. Kirk's (361 California
Ave., Palo Alto) has great

hamburgers, but they're not for the
faint-hearted. Ask for your
steakburger well-done if you don't
want it raw. The burgers at Kirk's are
cooked over a charcoal grill while you
wait; there's nothing else to eat but
potato chips and some packaged
salads, but this is a small point when
you're getting one of the last of the
real hamburgers. A close second in
the hamburger derby is the Alpine
Beer Garden (3915 Alpine road, Por
tola Valley), also known as the
Alpine Inn or as Rosotti's or, most
commonly, as Zott's. This is an old
time roadhouse where bikers and the
local Ford truck crowd mingle freely
with the Mercedes/BMW set, all
drinking pitchers of Henry's and
Anchor Steam at picnic tables in the
vast, dusty patio out back. The
burgers here are cooked on an
electric grill, but they're good-sized
and the trimmings are excellent:
sourdough French rolls, fresh lettuce
and-tomato setups. A hamburger and
beer on the patio at Zott's on a sunny
(but not too hot) day is what Califor
nia is all about.
Where to go with your bank card.
Some of the most expensive restau
rants around are: The Village Pub
(2967 Woodside Road, Woodside),
La Tour (525 University Ave., Palo
Alto), Maddalena's (544 emerson St.,
Palo Alto), Chantilly (530 Ramona
St., Palo Alto) and Hugo's Market
(4219 El Camino Real, Palo Alto, at
Rickey's Hyatt). Several of these
places have truly bad food, but your
pocketbook won't know the differ
ence.
Places to hear music. There are a few
places nearby where you can catch a

band while sitting down. Just a few.
The New Varsity (45b University
Ave., Palo Alto), a restaurant/art
house movie theater/bar/Palo Alto
High hangout, has live music in its
front courtyard most nights. Among
the regulars are Tuck and Patti, an
extremely popular local jazz
guitar/vocalist duo, and some of the
second-rank Windham Hill artists,
particularly Michael Hedges. Be
warned: On the weekends the
alienated teens of Palo Alto descend
on the New Varsity and hang out on
the sidewalk in front; you'll have to
walk their gauntlet to get in, espe
cially if something like
"Ouadrophenia" is playing as the
midnight show. St. Michael's Alley
has an adjoining cafe where music,
often folk, is performed on
weekends; the cafe, called St. Mi
chael's Waiting Room, has some of
the best pastries in town along with
wines and sherries by the glass, beer,
and all other things liquid. Adlai Al
exander, an ex-stalwart of several
campus bands, plays The Gatehouse
on Wednesday and Saturday
evenings; Alexander is an accom
plished jazz guitarist and a sometimes
amazing singer. If you like your music
with more of a participatory edge, try
the piano bar at Chez Louis, where
Roger Cowger might let you take
microphone in hand and wow the
crowd with your own impassioned
version of "The Impossible Dream."
And finally, check the weekly listings
for the Keystone Palo Alto (260 Cali
fornia Ave.), a disastrously uncom
fortable, hot, smoky, loud nightclub
with overpriced, watered-down
drinks where in the course of the last
four years you could have caught Neil
Young, Warren Zevon, The Band,
Jackson Browne, Bruce Springsteen

jumping up on stage with Clarence
demons and the Red Bank Rockers
Avoid at all costs. Sometime while
you're here someone will suggest
going to one of these restaurants.
Politely tell him/her you'd rather un
dergo root canal work.

Dinah's Shack (4269 EI Camino
Real) is one of those inexplicably
popular restaurants — I can see why
little old ladies go there, but why in
God's name would anyone else want
to spend $10 for a lousy buffet and
the chance to hear "Feelings" played
on the harp? Ecco Ristorante (4290
El Camino Real, Palo Alto) right
across the street in the Hyatt Palo
Alto, may be the worst Italian restau
rant I've ever encountered, and the
green carpet doesn't help. King Chuan
(75 Town and Country Village, Palo
Alto) had, at last count, three differ
ent laudatory Stanford Daily reviews
posted in its window. Don't believe a
word of them.

Breakfast. Morning eaters are lucky
here — Palo Alto and Menlo Park
have a plethora of good restaurants
that specialize in breakfast and lunch.
First among equals is Late for the
Train (8561 Oak Grove Ave., Menlo
Park, near the train station), a folksy
place that makes great omelettes,
divine blintzes and fruit pancakes,
and the usual salads and sandwiches,
plus ever-changing desserts. If you go
on a weekend, particularly a Sunday,

expect at least a 45-minute wait; it's
best, if you can, to go for an early or
late weekday lunch, when you can of
ten be seated immediately. Modeled
along much the same lines is Hohee's
Haven (4224 El Camino Real, Palo
Alto, and Town and Country Vil
lage), a family operation with more
branches down the peninsula.
Hobee's follows more traditional
American breakfast lines — sausage,
eggs, ham — but isn't lacking for
fresh-squeezed juices, fruit, and other
California trimmings, and it has a
truly addictive coffee cake that comes
with most of the breakfasts. The

Farmer's Market (448 California
Ave., Palo Alto) has a small menu,
spotty service (semi-cafeteria style)
and the ambiance of a butcher shop,
but it serves great breakfasts (try the
apple pancakes or a ham-swiss-apple
omelette) at amazingly low prices.
(The latter isn't always true on
weekends, when you may find your
self ordering a "brunch" at inflated
prices). Finally, there's the favorite
morning meeting spot of Stanford
sororities: Dinah's Poolside Coffee
Shop (4269 El Camino Real, Palo
Alto; not to be confused with Dinah's
Shack, a mediocre restaurant next
door), which many people feel has
the best omelettes in the area.
Where the Cardinal flocks. Stanford
hangouts change from year to year, of
course, and I'm sure the newest ones
have escaped my attention, but there
are old standards. Half the people in
Ramona's on any given weekend
night will be from Stanford; the Stan
ford crush is particularly intense
before and after basketball games.
Most of them will be eating the
second-best pizza in the area,
while those who want to be
different chew on Calzone or decent
hamburgers. The once-great
Ramona's salad bar maintains only a
shade of its former glory. Down the
street at the Good Earth Restaurant
(185 University Ave., Palo Alto)
you'll find a different, slightly older,
Stanford crowd eating chic health
food. Of course, hangouts in the true
Stanford sense of the word are places
you go to swill beer, and there are a
couple of those: The Dutch Goose
(3567 Alameda de las Pulgas, Menlo
Park), a functional sort of place
where there's standing room only on
Senior Pub Nights, and The Oasis
Beer Garden (241 El Camino Real,
Menlo Park), a downright ugly place
that has been witness to untold
decades of Stanford history. Two
things you have to know: refer to
them as "the Goose" and"the O,"
respectively; and rest assured that
you will be carded at both establish

merits. If you like your nightlife a bit
rowdier, try St. James Infirmary (390
Moffet Blvd., Mountain View) or
Antonio's Nut House (321 California
Ave., Palo Alto), places where you
can get into a fight if you try hard
enough. In recent years an attempt
has been made to turn The Lan
cashire Tavern (547 Emerson St.,
Palo Alto) into a Stanford hangout of
the pub night variety, but it doesn't
seem to have fully caught on. A
morning alternative: the brunch
crowd at Hobee's. And don't forget
The New Varsity, especially when the
theater is showing Woody Allen
movies.
Why don't we pick the kind of food we
want? It's the familiar refrain: How
about Chinese? How about Mexican?
And it's easy to fall into around here,
because there are more ethnic restau
rants than you can shake a burrito or
a potsticker at. Most of them are bad
as you'd expect; here are a few of the
good ones.
Generations of Stanfordites have fal
len in love with the mu shu pork at
Chef Chu's (1067 North San Antonio
Road at El Camino Real, Los Altos).
This always crowded Mandarin res
taurant prepares perfectly solid, un
exciting dishes — it's the ideal place
for large groups with diverse tastes.
The food's more exciting at China
First (675 el Camino Real, Palo
Alto), another place with a large
reputation. The cuisine here is Szech
wan/Hunan, albeit not that spicy, and
there are great dishes on the menu; if
you go in looking like students, you
may have to put up with the waiter
sniffing at you.
On a more modest scale, there are
two worthwhile Chinese places in
Menlo Park; Yuen Yung (639 Santa
Cruz Ave.) and Su Hong (1039 El
Camino Real). Both are eclectic, but
primarily Cantonese/Mandarin. Su
Hong has better food, Yuen Yung
more interesting decor —it looks like
a cross between a Chinese restaurant
and a fern bar.
Palo Alto lost its only really good

Mexican restaurant when Andes
Mexican Restaurant, a Whiskey
Gulch anomaly, folded earlier this
year. Now a trip to Menlo Park or
Los Altos is required. Estrellita (971
North San Antonio Rd., Los Altos)
isn't what it used to be, but it still has
great chimichangas. There are two
passable family-type Mexican joints,
La Luna Mexican Cafe (1137
Chestnut St.) and Calela (1143 D
Crane St.). If you don't mind a drive,
the best Latin restaurant around is
probably El Calderon (699 El Cal
deron Ave., Mountain View), which
is hidden away in a small shopping
center and has a Mexican/Salvadoran
menu.
Places worth going to for French food.
Without going into too much detail,
there are two local French restaurants
that come close to meeting the bistro
ideal (good food, relatively low
prices): Le Pot au Feu (1149 El
Camino Real, Menlo Park) and A La
Carte Restaurant Francois (2310 El
Camino Real, Palo Alto). Somewhat
more formal, but still affordable, are
Pear Williams Restaurant Francais
(150 Middlefield Road, Menlo Park)
and Chez Louis (4170 El Camino

Real, Palo Alto). Most of the other
nearby French restaurants suffer
from some combination of preten
tiousness, over-pricing, bad service
and just plain poor food.
A place to go to for German food. The
only German restaurant I've dis
covered anywhere near campus is
the Black Forest Inn (376 First Street,
Los Altos). Meals are prepared
rather indifferently, but if you just
have to have some weinershnitzel
with red cabbage and potato
pancakes, this is the place to go.
Real burritos. Rosita's Taqueria
(171 A sth Ave., Redwood City) oc
cupies a storefront in an uninviting
part of Redwood City (a town know
for its uninviting parts) and makes the
only authentic burritos-to-go in the
area. These are big sloppy things that
can't be eaten while driving a car, and
they come in a wide selection, includ
ing pork and beef in several sauces,
steak, chicken, sausage and tongue.
Rosita's also has a good selection of
Mexican beers and soft drinks (you
haven't lived until you've had a Boing
soda).
Remember quiche? After fondue and
before pesto, there was quiche. The
Perfect Recipe (76 Stanford Shopping
Center) still serves this forgotten vic
tim of the gourmet wars, along with
cutesy sandwiches and good coffee; a
different quiche is served every day,
and you can count on a flakey crust
and perfect consistency. They don't
serve white wine, but you can still dig
your clogs out of the closet and
pretend Stanford is a shoo-in for a
bowl game (which last happened at
about the height of the quiche craze).
The best pizza within a half-hour of
Stanford. Frankie, Johnnie & Luigi,
Too (939 El Camino Real, Mountain
View) has no peer in pizza; what it
does have are 15-minute-to-an-hour
waits on weekends, which can fly by if
enough of you go and you drink


enough while waiting (if you look 21,
you'll be accosted by a roving cocktail
waitress the minute you sign in). Try
the fresh-tomato-and-garlic pizza, a
house specialty, and avoid the Italian
dinners, which are often dreadful. A
distant second to FJ&L is Ramona's
Restaurant (541 Ramona St., Palo
Alto), which has decent New York
style (i.e., heavy and spicy) pizza and
slightly shorter waits; it's 15 minutes
closer to campus. Honorable men
tion goes to pizza with barbecue
sauce (ladled on in place of tomato
sauce) at Jose's (2275 El Caniino
Real, Palo Alto).

It's 2 a.m. and I'm hungry and noth
ing's open. There used to be a wealth
of places you could go at 2 a.m. (or 4
a.m., or 6 a.m.) with the gang and be
obnoxious, or with a loved one to for
tify yourself for an emotional crisis,
or by yourself to study and grab a
burger. But Stickney's Flamingo first
cut back to midnight, and then
became a trendy Yuppie restaurant;
Luv's went to 24 hours on weekends
only, then became a singles dance
spot, and is now Atherton Joe's,
which is God only knows what. In the
old days, going to Denny's or Lyon's
didn't even cross your mind; now
they're all that's left. Closer (by about
a hundred yards) and friendlier is
Denny's (4256 El Camino Real, Palo
Alto), which is 10 minutes away at
two in the morning. Denny's is also
cheaper than Lyon's, it has tackier
vinyl (bright orange), and it has Ova,
the current all-star late-night
waitress. So why go to Lyon's (4298
El Camino Real, Los Altos) at all?
Because sometimes you need a
change. Lyon's is darker, the
waitresses are younger, and the meals
are bigger; if you're determined to
eat a lot of food at 4 and make your

self really sick, there's nothing like a
Mighty Lyon Burger.
The only competition left for these
corporate monsters is the University
Creamery (209 University Ave., Palo
Alto), which sensed the vacuum and
went to a 24-hour policy last spring.
The Creamery has pretty mediocre
greasy-spoon food, but the
milkshakes are great (they use Bud's
ice cream) and it's a lot closer to
campus (it's even within fairly easy
bicycle range).

Ice cream. We all love ice cream, but
no one can deny that the Stanford
area is drowning in the stuff. Within a
quick drive of campus are a Haagen-
Dazs (Stanford Barn, 700 Welch
Road), two Bud's (125 University
Ave., Palo Alto and 3590 Alameda
de las Pulgas, Menlo Park) and
various Swensen's and Baskin-
Robbins outlets, as well as the Italian

ice cream shops: Gelalo La
Romanina (1700 EI Camino Real,
Menlo Park), Tempo Gelato (2245 El
Camino Real, Palo Alto), Gelalo
Classico (Emerson St., downtown
Palo Alto), Bravo Fono (99Stanford
Shopping Center), et al. Two or three
more have probably opened since you
started reading this. If ice cream to
you means a soda fountain, try Edy's
(73 Town & Country Village, El-
Camino and Ambarcadero, Palo
Alto), or one of the downtown
creameries: Peninsula Creamery
(Hamilton Avenue and Emerson St.,
Palo Alto) and University Creamery
(209 University Ave., Palo Alto).
Spirits in the night. There are as
many different kinds of bars as there
are drinkers, and the most popular
ones — the Goose, the O, 42nd
Street, the BBC — are treated else
where in the article. I'm concerned
here with the bar as a comfortable en
vironment in which to drink, as
opposed to a supportive environment
in which to get drunk (or find your
soulmate).
The Gatehouse (265 Lytton Ave.,
Palo Alto) is a snitzy restaurant by
day and a snitzy bar by night, and one
of the nicest places to sit around in Palo
Alto. The bar at Mama's (379 Stan
ford Shopping Center) is a bit out of
the way, but it has a certain hushed
elegance that makes it attractive.
Henry's (482 University Ave., Palo
Alto) is hot and crowded once the
dinner customers clear out, but
there's no one on the make; just lots
of successful young Palo Altans hang
ing out in one of their favorite bars.
Another bar that has a "scene," but
isn't quite a singles bar, is that of the
New Varsity (456 University Ave.,
Palo Alto). Videos play above the
bar, musicians play in the courtyard,
and lots of Palo Alto High School
blondes and assorted Palo Alto punks
hang around out front. It's noisy and
crowded and uncomfortable on the
weekends, but the people-watching is

great. If you're looking for something
a little more staid, try the bar at the
rear of the London House (630
Ramona St., Palo Alto), a loving re
creation of an English pub where you
can get most any British beer you
want, pub snacks and a game of darts.

The singles scene. I've seen more than
my share of students (MBA and
otherwise) in these places. 42nd
Street (518 Bryant St. Palo Alto, in
the alley between Bryant and
Ramona) is either a dream come true
or a nightmare made real, depending
on your point of view. It's an ex
pensively tacky meat market with
great sight lines, where you'll find a
variety of hunters: tables of
frightened-looking Stanford students,
Palo Alto nouveau riche and lots of
secretaries. The action is much more
serious at the British Bankers Club
(1090 El Camino Real, Menlo Bowl),
which draws an older, richer crowd (it
goes in and out of fashion as a busi
ness school hangout) to its fake Ed
wardian digs. Coming on strong in
recent years has been Mac Arthur

next to the Palo Alto train station), a

La Tour (525 University Ave., Palo
Alto), Maddalena's (544 emerson St.,
Palo Alto), Chantilly (530 Ramona
St., Palo Alto) and Hugo's Market
(4219 El Camino Real, Palo Alto, at
Rickey's Hyatt). Several of these
places have truly bad food, but your
pocketbook won't know the differ
ence.
Places to hear music. There are a few
places nearby where you can catch a

band while sitting down. Just a few.
The New Varsity (45b University
Ave., Palo Alto), a restaurant/art
house movie theater/bar/Palo Alto
High hangout, has live music in its
front courtyard most nights. Among
the regulars are Tuck and Patti, an
extremely popular local jazz
guitar/vocalist duo, and some of the
second-rank Windham Hill artists,
particularly Michael Hedges. Be
warned: On the weekends the
alienated teens of Palo Alto descend
on the New Varsity and hang out on
the sidewalk in front; you'll have to
walk their gauntlet to get in, espe
cially if something like
"Ouadrophenia" is playing as the
midnight show. St. Michael's Alley
has an adjoining cafe where music,
often folk, is performed on
weekends; the cafe, called St. Mi
chael's Waiting Room, has some of
the best pastries in town along with
wines and sherries by the glass, beer,
and all other things liquid. Adlai Al
exander, an ex-stalwart of several
campus bands, plays The Gatehouse
on Wednesday and Saturday
evenings; Alexander is an accom
plished jazz guitarist and a sometimes
amazing singer. If you like your music
with more of a participatory edge, try
the piano bar at Chez Louis, where
Roger Cowger might let you take
microphone in hand and wow the
crowd with your own impassioned
version of "The Impossible Dream."
And finally, check the weekly listings
for the Keystone Palo Alto (260 Cali
fornia Ave.), a disastrously uncom
fortable, hot, smoky, loud nightclub
with overpriced, watered-down
drinks where in the course of the last
four years you could have caught Neil
Young, Warren Zevon, The Band,
Jackson Browne, Bruce Springsteen

jumping up on stage with Clarence
demons and the Red Bank Rockers
Avoid at all costs. Sometime while
you're here someone will suggest
going to one of these restaurants.
Politely tell him/her you'd rather un
dergo root canal work.

Dinah's Shack (4269 EI Camino
Real) is one of those inexplicably
popular restaurants — I can see why
little old ladies go there, but why in
God's name would anyone else want
to spend $10 for a lousy buffet and
the chance to hear "Feelings" played
on the harp? Ecco Ristorante (4290
El Camino Real, Palo Alto) right
across the street in the Hyatt Palo
Alto, may be the worst Italian restau
rant I've ever encountered, and the
green carpet doesn't help. King Chuan
(75 Town and Country Village, Palo
Alto) had, at last count, three differ
ent laudatory Stanford Daily reviews
posted in its window. Don't believe a
word of them.
