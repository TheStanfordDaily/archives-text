# Museums, galleries abound in Bay Area but difficult to find

### 
Keeping track of Bay Area art —
what is being done, and what is being
exhibited — is the hardest job of all
for the culture bound. Outside of a
few major museums, art is the least
publicized aspect of the local cultural
life. Adding to the problem is the
number of small galleries, especially
in San Francisco, many of which stage
consistently important exhibits that
last a month or less and that you
won't know about unless you seek
them out. Because of the vast number
of places in the area which exhibit art,
the following account is destined to
be highly arbitrary, covering but a
few of the more important venues.
The Stanford Art Department
maintains both the Stanford Museum
of Art and the Stanford Art Gallery.
The museum's permanent collection
is a marvelous resource for students;
all periods of European art are
represented, and there are rooms
devoted to Greek and Roman, Asian
and Oceanic art as well. There is a
large gallery devoted to Stanford
family memorabilia. The museum's
main claim to fame is its Rodin Col
lection, which is housed in a special
rotunda within the museum and in an
outdoor sculpture garden nexi to the
museum (as well as in various out
door spots on campus). The
museum's upstairs balconies, and the
Meidel room, hold special exhibits.
The Stanford Gallery, amidst the

Business School, Hoover Tower, and
the Art and History buildings, holds
rotating exhibits throughout the year,
including the annual show of work by
candidates for the Master of Fine
Arts degree. The Gallery building
also houses the Gallery Bookshop,
which sells art books, cards and
posters.
A number of other places on
campus hang exhibits more or less
regularly. STARTS (Student Arts at
Stanford) puts on monthly exhibits in
the Coffee House, mainly of student
photography and in the upstairs
lobby of Tresidder Union. The Be
chtel International Center puts on ex
hibits with international, often Third
World, themes.
San Francisco is home to four
major museums, three of which are
under common management. These
three, the "Fine Arts Museums of
San Francisco," are the M.H. de
Young Memorial Museum and the
Asian Art Museum (both in the same
building in Golden Gate Park) and
the California Palace of the Legion of
Honor (Lincoln Park). The de
Young's collection, which encom
passes Western art from the Greeks
and Romans to early 20th-century
Euopean and American, isn't particu
larly noteworthy (i.e., one visit is
enough), but the museum plays host
to many of the top national traveling

shows — in recent years San Fran
cisco money has brought the Tut, An
thony, Alexander, etc. — to the de
Young. The Asian Art Museum has
one of the best permanent national
collections in its field; unfortunately,
there isn't enough room on the walls
for more than a fraction of it. The col
lection is constantly rotated. The
Palace of the Legion of Honor collec
tion comprises entirely French art,
from medieval tapestries to a room of
impressionists and post
impressionists. In the basement of the
Legion is the museum's Graphic Arts
department, which puts up rotating
exhibits of prints and drawings. The
Legion also draws big-name tempo
rary exhibits — the Phillips collection
and the Bresden exhibit have been
there in recent years.
The fourth of San Francisco's big
museums is the rather small Museum
of Modern Art (Van Ness and McAl
lister, in the Civic Center). The
MOMA can't pretend to be a
catalogue of 20th-century art, like its
namesake in New York; in fact, its
permanent collection is surprisingly
meager. It has its strengths, however,
especially its vast photography hold
ings (too little of which are ever
hung) and a room of monumental
paintings by local abstract expres
sionist Clyfford Still. MOMA, like
the Fine Arts Museums, draws big
traveling exhibits all the time (San
Francisco probably draws more of
these than any other American city).
Across the bay, the Oakland
Museum (1000 Oak St., near Lake

Merritt and the Lake Merritt BART
station) is worth a visit if only for the
building itself and an award-winning
concrete pile designed by Kevin
Roche. The museum is officially The
Museum of California and has
galleries devoted to California art,
history and natural sciences.
Also worth seeing is the University
Art Museum at the University of Cal
ifornia at Berkeley (2626 Bancroft
Way). The museum owes its exis
tence, and a large part of its collection
and initial funding, to German

painter Hans Hoffman. Hoffman
spent the Second World War as a
refugee at the Berkeley campus, and
as a show of gratitude gave a group of
his canvases and a large sum of
money to the university so that it
could build a museum. His large
abstract paintings are still the
museum's centerpiece.
By far the liveliest part of San
Francisco's art world is the scads of
galleries scattered around town. The
good ones may be hard to find (if you
can tell from the street that some
thing is a gallery, it probably isn't
worth seeing), but a little searching
pays off.

Stanford students quickly adopted this modern piece of outdoor entitled "Mozart II" as a jungle gym, thus
giving it a new name "Memorial Jungle Gym."
