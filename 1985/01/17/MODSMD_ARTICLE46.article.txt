# Museums, galleries abound in Bay Area but difficult to find
## 
### 
Keeping track of Bay Area art —
what is being done, and what is being
exhibited — is the hardest job of all
for the culture bound. Outside of a
few major museums, art is the least
publicized aspect of the local cultural
life. Adding to the problem is the
number of small galleries, especially
in San Francisco, many of which stage
consistently important exhibits that
last a month or less and that you
won't know about unless you seek
them out. Because of the vast number
of places in the area which exhibit art,
the following account is destined to
be highly arbitrary, covering but a
few of the more important venues.
The Stanford Art Department
maintains both the Stanford Museum
of Art and the Stanford Art Gallery.
The museum's permanent collection
is a marvelous resource for students;
all periods of European art are
represented, and there are rooms
devoted to Greek and Roman, Asian
and Oceanic art as well. There is a
large gallery devoted to Stanford
family memorabilia. The museum's
main claim to fame is its Rodin Col
lection, which is housed in a special
rotunda within the museum and in an
outdoor sculpture garden nexi to the
museum (as well as in various out
door spots on campus). The
museum's upstairs balconies, and the
Meidel room, hold special exhibits.
The Stanford Gallery, amidst the

Business School, Hoover Tower, and
the Art and History buildings, holds
rotating exhibits throughout the year,
including the annual show of work by
candidates for the Master of Fine
Arts degree. The Gallery building
also houses the Gallery Bookshop,
which sells art books, cards and
posters.
A number of other places on
campus hang exhibits more or less
regularly. STARTS (Student Arts at
Stanford) puts on monthly exhibits in
the Coffee House, mainly of student
photography and in the upstairs
lobby of Tresidder Union. The Be
chtel International Center puts on ex
hibits with international, often Third
World, themes.
San Francisco is home to four
major museums, three of which are
under common management. These
three, the "Fine Arts Museums of
San Francisco," are the M.H. de
Young Memorial Museum and the
Asian Art Museum (both in the same
building in Golden Gate Park) and
the California Palace of the Legion of
Honor (Lincoln Park). The de
Young's collection, which encom
passes Western art from the Greeks
and Romans to early 20th-century
Euopean and American, isn't particu
larly noteworthy (i.e., one visit is
enough), but the museum plays host
to many of the top national traveling

Four statues of the Burghers of Calais stand in the Quad on the Stanford campus. There is also an extensive
collection of other Rodin work in the Stanford Museum of Art.
