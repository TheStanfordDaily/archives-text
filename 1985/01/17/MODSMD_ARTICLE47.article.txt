# Finding the best cinema seat
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG 
The Stanford area caters happily to
a moviegoing community. Palo Alto,
Menlo Park, Mountain View and
nearby neighborhoods boast so many
first-run moviehouses that even
aficionados find it unnecessary to
make many trips to San Francisco.
Revival theaters are not, unfortun
ately, in such great supply, though
downtown Palo Alto does have two
(around the corner from each other).
Visiting movie addicts will find their
needs tended to in the following loca
tions:
New Varsity: Located on Univer
sity Avenue between Waverly and
Cowper Streets, the New Varsity is a
fairly good, if erratic, repertory
cinema. Double bills (and occasion
ally triple bills) change every day or
two, and they offer not only recent
films (often hot off the first-run
screens) — but also American and
foreign classics, some not often
revived. If a relatively unpublicized
movie opens in San Francisco and
fails to show up first-run in Palo Alto,
chances are it will surface at the New
Varsity within six or eight months.
The seats are slightly rickety and un
comfortable, but the Varsity's pa
trons don't seem to mind very much.
The building also houses an indoor
outdoor cafe-restaurant where locals
often gather in the evening for coffee,
dessert and live music in the court
yard. Warning: On Friday nights the
Varsity is a hangout for teenagers —
a responsive but perhaps overly vocal
audience for the movies the manage
ment has provided to cater to high
school kids.
Festival: Just behind the Varsity,

on Hamilton Avenue just west of
Cowper Street, is the Festival
Theatre, which shows one double bill
a week. (The movies change on
Thursday.) It's much smaller than the
Varsity — intimate, but very cozy,
with overstuffed seats and enormous
pillows on the floor just in front of the
screen. Almost all the features are
Hollywood movies from the 1930s
and '40s (there's a British double bill
every six weeks or so), which are a
treat to see again on a big screen even
if you've already caught them on TV.
Aquarius: The Aquarius, on Emer
son between University and Lytton,
has two small cinemas that show
mostly foreign films, with the oc
casional "small" American feature
like Chilly Scenes of Winter or Angelo
My Love. Since it is one of Palo
Alto's major claims to culture, it is
nearly always crowded on Friday and
Saturday nights; the Palo Alto
moviegoing crowd tends to adopt cer
tain movies that open at the Aquarius
— El Norte or Carmen — and keep
them playing there for months. It's
your basic (essential) university
theater, and though its films are (of
course) of highly variable quality, the
management has never compromised
its decision to show only arthouse se
lections.
Bijou: For years the Aquarius
Cinemas owned the Bijou — a small
cinema just down the street, on
Emerson between Hamilton and For
est — but in December 1983 new
owners converted it into a revival
house dedicated (we were repeatedly
told) to showing unusual movies,
domestic and foreign, that don't often
appear on local screens. And the first

schedule contained dozens of such
films — it was a movie buff's
paradise, until the management
decided it couldn't make money that
way. Each subsequent schedule
became less interesting than the last,
and once a week or so the owners

turned it into a nightclub, giving over
its space to a stand-up comic. At
present it seems to be a cross between
a first-run and a second-run theater,
showing very odd triple and quad
ruple bills.
Fine Arts: On California Avenue,

just east of El Camino — in the midst
of the alternative commercial area in
Palo Alto — the Fine Arts is a fairly
nice theater, known in the past for
grabbing hold of movies it could show
for months and months, like An Offi
cer and a Gentleman or Gandhi.
Lately the turnover has been more
rapid. The management of the
theater, it should be noted, is not es
pecially nice; chances are that some
one will snap at you on your way in.
Palo Alto Square: These twin
theaters take up the bottom floor of a
very bland-looking office building at
the corner of El Camino and Page
Mill Road. They draw mostly high
school kids, because they tend to
show boffo films like Footloose and
Indiana Jones and the Temple of
Doom. But they are undeniably com
fortable and convenient.
Guild, Park: These are Menlo
Park's two movie theaters. They are
located a few blocks from each other
on El Camino. Each offers first-run
movies of all kinds, including "art
house" films like This Is Spinal Tap.
They are pleasant theaters, and pretty
reliable with regard to programming
— generally speaking, at least one of
them offers a film worth seeing at any
given time.
Old Mill 6: The bane of a
moviegoer's existence — you can't
avoid seeing films here: Since there
are six screens, two or three new
pictures arrive each week. Besides,
the bargain-price twilight shows are
very seductive, though the bargain
show policy changes every couple of
months. But the screens are tiny, the
theater is always crowded, and you

move from line to line until you feel
you're being processed. Furthermore,
it's an offensively ugly environment
in which to see movies — the theater
looks vaguely like a video arcade. But

if you must, you must. Located in the
Old Mill Shopping Mall on San An
tonio Road, near the San Antonio
Shopping Center.
U.A. Redwood 6: Another six
screen theater, the U.A. is located in

one of the most unattractive areas in
Redwood City (which is saying a lot),
and the theater is even more
claustrophobic than the Old Mill. But
it's not as popular, and all matinees
(except Sundays and holidays) are of
fered at bargain prices.
Mann 6: Fashion Island Shopping
Mall, located in San Mateo just off

Route 92 (heading toward the San
Mateo Bridge), is amazing. The shop
ping center is enormous, and you
drive around it for what seems like
hours before you can park outside the
Mann 6 theaters. Inside sits every

junk food shop you've ever craved
(or avoided). Before slipping in to see
a movie on one of the six small
screens, you can sit and lick your
Haagen-Dazs chocolate-chocolate
chip cone or bite into your corn dog
while watching kids ice skate on the
rink that separates the fast food
stands from the movies. FAshion Is
land is also big on bargain matinees,
and if you pick an unconventional
time to go (like 5:00 in the after
noon), you can see even a block
buster like Indiana Jones without a
wait. Besides, it's a pop cultural ex
perience you won't want to miss.
Belmont: Sometimes a movie you
want to see disappears from every
other theater within a 20-minute
drive except for the Belmont, and so
if you're persistent, you hunt down
this suburban house (located north of
Ralston Avenue on El Camino —
there's a Ralston Ave. exit off both
101 and 280), where there's never a
line and tickets are $2.50 a head even
on Saturday nights. A charmingly
rundown theater.
Any local paper will tell you what's
playing at each of the above theaters
except those north of Menlo Park —
you'll need a San Francisco Chronicle
or Examinerr for that information.
The bills usually change on Fridays
(except foir the revival cinemas, of
course). The best overall guide to the
movies is the "Arts and Entertain
ment" section of the Sunday Ex
aminer & Chronicle, affectionately
known as the "pink section." A num
ber of local theaters advertise in The
Daily, as do the on-campus film se
ries. A selective list of movies (mostly
revivals) appears in the
"Cinemascope" section of The Daily
every Friday.

time to go (like 5:00 in the after
noon), you can see even a block
buster like Indiana Jones without a
wait. Besides, it's a pop cultural ex
perience you won't want to miss.
Belmont: Sometimes a movie you
want to see disappears from every
other theater within a 20-minute
drive except for the Belmont, and so
if you're persistent, you hunt down
this suburban house (located north of
Ralston Avenue on El Camino —
there's a Ralston Ave. exit off both
101 and 280), where there's never a
line and tickets are $2.50 a head even
on Saturday nights. A charmingly
rundown theater.
Any local paper will tell you what's
playing at each of the above theaters
except those north of Menlo Park —
you'll need a San Francisco Chronicle
or Examinerr for that information.
The bills usually change on Fridays
(except foir the revival cinemas, of
course). The best overall guide to the
movies is the "Arts and Entertain
ment" section of the Sunday Ex
aminer & Chronicle, affectionately
known as the "pink section." A num
ber of local theaters advertise in The
Daily, as do the on-campus film se
ries. A selective list of movies (mostly
revivals) appears in the
"Cinemascope" section of The Daily
every Friday.
The Stanford area caters happily to
a moviegoing community. Palo Alto,
Menlo Park, Mountain View and
nearby neighborhoods boast so many
first-run moviehouses that even
aficionados find it unnecessary to
make many trips to San Francisco.
Revival theaters are not, unfortun
ately, in such great supply, though
downtown Palo Alto does have two
(around the corner from each other).
Visiting movie addicts will find their
needs tended to in the following loca
tions:
New Varsity: Located on Univer
sity Avenue between Waverly and
Cowper Streets, the New Varsity is a
fairly good, if erratic, repertory
cinema. Double bills (and occasion
ally triple bills) change every day or
two, and they offer not only recent
films (often hot off the first-run
screens) — but also American and
foreign classics, some not often
revived. If a relatively unpublicized
movie opens in San Francisco and
fails to show up first-run in Palo Alto,
chances are it will surface at the New
Varsity within six or eight months.
The seats are slightly rickety and un
comfortable, but the Varsity's pa
trons don't seem to mind very much.
The building also houses an indoor
outdoor cafe-restaurant where locals
often gather in the evening for coffee,
dessert and live music in the court
yard. Warning: On Friday nights the
Varsity is a hangout for teenagers —
a responsive but perhaps overly vocal
audience for the movies the manage
ment has provided to cater to high
school kids.
Festival: Just behind the Varsity,

on Hamilton Avenue just west of
Cowper Street, is the Festival
Theatre, which shows one double bill
a week. (The movies change on
Thursday.) It's much smaller than the
Varsity — intimate, but very cozy,
with overstuffed seats and enormous
pillows on the floor just in front of the
screen. Almost all the features are
Hollywood movies from the 1930s
and '40s (there's a British double bill
every six weeks or so), which are a
treat to see again on a big screen even
if you've already caught them on TV.
Aquarius: The Aquarius, on Emer
son between University and Lytton,
has two small cinemas that show
mostly foreign films, with the oc
casional "small" American feature
like Chilly Scenes of Winter or Angelo
My Love. Since it is one of Palo
Alto's major claims to culture, it is
nearly always crowded on Friday and
Saturday nights; the Palo Alto
moviegoing crowd tends to adopt cer
tain movies that open at the Aquarius
— El Norte or Carmen — and keep
them playing there for months. It's
your basic (essential) university
theater, and though its films are (of
course) of highly variable quality, the
management has never compromised
its decision to show only arthouse se
lections.
Bijou: For years the Aquarius
Cinemas owned the Bijou — a small
cinema just down the street, on
Emerson between Hamilton and For
est — but in December 1983 new
owners converted it into a revival
house dedicated (we were repeatedly
told) to showing unusual movies,
domestic and foreign, that don't often
appear on local screens. And the first

schedule contained dozens of such
films — it was a movie buff's
paradise, until the management
decided it couldn't make money that
way. Each subsequent schedule
became less interesting than the last,
and once a week or so the owners

turned it into a nightclub, giving over
its space to a stand-up comic. At
present it seems to be a cross between
a first-run and a second-run theater,
showing very odd triple and quad
ruple bills.
Fine Arts: On California Avenue,

just east of El Camino — in the midst
of the alternative commercial area in
Palo Alto — the Fine Arts is a fairly
nice theater, known in the past for
grabbing hold of movies it could show
for months and months, like An Offi
cer and a Gentleman or Gandhi.
Lately the turnover has been more
rapid. The management of the
theater, it should be noted, is not es
pecially nice; chances are that some
one will snap at you on your way in.
Palo Alto Square: These twin
theaters take up the bottom floor of a
very bland-looking office building at
the corner of El Camino and Page
Mill Road. They draw mostly high
school kids, because they tend to
show boffo films like Footloose and
Indiana Jones and the Temple of
Doom. But they are undeniably com
fortable and convenient.
Guild, Park: These are Menlo
Park's two movie theaters. They are
located a few blocks from each other
on El Camino. Each offers first-run
movies of all kinds, including "art
house" films like This Is Spinal Tap.
They are pleasant theaters, and pretty
reliable with regard to programming
— generally speaking, at least one of
them offers a film worth seeing at any
given time.
Old Mill 6: The bane of a
moviegoer's existence — you can't
avoid seeing films here: Since there
are six screens, two or three new
pictures arrive each week. Besides,
the bargain-price twilight shows are
very seductive, though the bargain
show policy changes every couple of
months. But the screens are tiny, the
theater is always crowded, and you

move from line to line until you feel
you're being processed. Furthermore,
it's an offensively ugly environment
in which to see movies — the theater
looks vaguely like a video arcade. But

if you must, you must. Located in the
Old Mill Shopping Mall on San An
tonio Road, near the San Antonio
Shopping Center.
U.A. Redwood 6: Another six
screen theater, the U.A. is located in

one of the most unattractive areas in
Redwood City (which is saying a lot),
and the theater is even more
claustrophobic than the Old Mill. But
it's not as popular, and all matinees
(except Sundays and holidays) are of
fered at bargain prices.
Mann 6: Fashion Island Shopping
Mall, located in San Mateo just off

Route 92 (heading toward the San
Mateo Bridge), is amazing. The shop
ping center is enormous, and you
drive around it for what seems like
hours before you can park outside the
Mann 6 theaters. Inside sits every

junk food shop you've ever craved
(or avoided). Before slipping in to see
a movie on one of the six small
screens, you can sit and lick your
Haagen-Dazs chocolate-chocolate
chip cone or bite into your corn dog
while watching kids ice skate on the
rink that separates the fast food
stands from the movies. FAshion Is
land is also big on bargain matinees,
and if you pick an unconventional
time to go (like 5:00 in the after
noon), you can see even a block

the screens are tiny, the theater is
always crowded, and you move
from line to line until you feel
you're being processed.

if you must, you must. Located in the
Old Mill Shopping Mall on San An
tonio Road, near the San Antonio
Shopping Center.
U.A. Redwood 6: Another six
screen theater, the U.A. is located in

one of the most unattractive areas in
Redwood City (which is saying a lot),
and the theater is even more
claustrophobic than the Old Mill. But
it's not as popular, and all matinees
(except Sundays and holidays) are of
fered at bargain prices.
Mann 6: Fashion Island Shopping
Mall, located in San Mateo just off

Route 92 (heading toward the San
Mateo Bridge), is amazing. The shop
ping center is enormous, and you
drive around it for what seems like
hours before you can park outside the
Mann 6 theaters. Inside sits every

junk food shop you've ever craved
(or avoided). Before slipping in to see
a movie on one of the six small
screens, you can sit and lick your
Haagen-Dazs chocolate-chocolate
chip cone or bite into your corn dog
while watching kids ice skate on the
rink that separates the fast food
stands from the movies. FAshion Is
land is also big on bargain matinees,
and if you pick an unconventional
time to go (like 5:00 in the after
noon), you can see even a block
buster like Indiana Jones without a
wait. Besides, it's a pop cultural ex
perience you won't want to miss.
Belmont: Sometimes a movie you
want to see disappears from every
other theater within a 20-minute
drive except for the Belmont, and so
if you're persistent, you hunt down
this suburban house (located north of
Ralston Avenue on El Camino —
there's a Ralston Ave. exit off both
101 and 280), where there's never a
line and tickets are $2.50 a head even
on Saturday nights. A charmingly
rundown theater.
Any local paper will tell you what's
playing at each of the above theaters
except those north of Menlo Park —
you'll need a San Francisco Chronicle
or Examinerr for that information.
The bills usually change on Fridays
(except foir the revival cinemas, of
course). The best overall guide to the
movies is the "Arts and Entertain
ment" section of the Sunday Ex
aminer & Chronicle, affectionately
known as the "pink section." A num
ber of local theaters advertise in The
Daily, as do the on-campus film se
ries. A selective list of movies (mostly
revivals) appears in the
"Cinemascope" section of The Daily
every Friday.
