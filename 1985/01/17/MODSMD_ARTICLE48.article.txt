# How to get there without your car
## 
### 
If you feel your desire to travel
north stifled by your lack of a car,
you'll be happy to know that there
are other inexpensive and convenient
ways to get there.
The most easily accessible trans
portation to the City is the SamTrans
bus which departs from the El
Camino Real bus stop across from the
Stanford Shopping Center. From
there, the 7F bus line follows High
way 101
Buses begin the hourly trip to San
Francisco at 5:17 a.m. on weekdays
and at 7:07 a.m. on weekends. After
8:37 a.m. buses run every half hour
until the 3:37 p.m., when they return
to hourly departures with the last bus
leaving at 12 :44 a.m.
The travel time by bus is nearly
twice that of driving, but the hour and
one-half passes more quickly if
shared with a book, Walkman or
friend. Be prepared to stand if you
ride during commuter hours.
When you arrive at the downtown
stops, Eighth and Mission (near the
Civic Center) or First and Mission,
the City aura hits you and the image
of the long bus ride quickly fades.
Don't forget that the last bus back to
Palo Alto leaves First and Mission at
12:49 a.m. and that the south-bound
buses leave from Seventh and Mis
sion instead of Eighth.
Earlier, the homewardbound 7F
buses leave every 10-15 minutes until
5:45 p.m. when they start leaving
once an hour.
If you really want to "get into" the

Bay Area commuting scene, you may
want to consider taking BART (Bay
Area Rapid Transit) into the City.
But since the closest BART station to
Stanford is in Daly City, using BART
first entails finding transportation to
Daly City — about 20 miles north of
campus on Interstate 280.
The 5L SamTrans bus line regu
larly leaves the Palo Alto Southern
Pacific railway station from 6:00 a.m.
until 6:30 p.m. and stops at the Daly
City BART station. The trip costs less
than a dollar, but the stop-and-go
route takes about an hour and a half.
But if buses make you sick and you
think BART is too robotic, there is
always the train. The CalTrain leaves
from the Southern Pacific Depot off
University Avenue: a short bike ride
from campus. Don't forget to lock
your bike securely before abandoning
it for the day, or you may end up
walking home.
The train is more expensive than
the other methods of transport, with a
one-way ticket costing $3.20 and a
round trip $4.80, but it tends to be
more comfortable and roomy than
the bus.
The combined network of cable
cars, the mini metro and regular
buses make up the City's transporta
tion system — better known as
MUNI.
