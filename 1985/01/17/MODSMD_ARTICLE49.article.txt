Aside from its reputation as one
of the best universities in the
nation, Stanford also can
boast of being one of the most
scenic and beautiful campuses, too.
From the foothills to the bay, as we
say, the sprawling campus gets
enough sightseers and tourists in its
own right to rival many of San Fran
cisco's most famous attractions.

'People assume that because he
(Herbert Hoover) has a tower
everybody likes him,' said Mar
tinez, even though the most
thought many students have given
to the depression era president last
surfaced in high school American
history classes.

Because of this, the university of
fers student tour guides who escort
visitors around the main areas of
campus, offering historical and in
formative anecdotes about Jane ,and
Leland Stanford's gift to California.
What follows are the musings of

some of the people who guide those
tours. Some of the misconceptions
they chronicle may surprise you —
others you may find you shared.
Okay, 'fess up! When you were
looking at Stanford senior year, did
you ask your tour guide his SAT
score? If you didn't, you're in the
minority.
According to senior Rich Martinez,

who is already going down in guide
service history for his record-setting
750-plus hours of work, most people
ask what the University looks for in
an applicant. Martinez said his stan
dard response is, "Nobody will tell
you."

High school students do, in fact,
make up one of the biggest groups of
tourists to the Stanford campus. Tour
guides like Lisa Brown, another vete
ran, describes this group as one, the
members of which are usually "dres
sed up, nervous and quiet." She ag
reed that most high school students
ask for personal grade point average
information in contrast with older
visitors who are interested primarily
in Memorial Church and with alumns
who are curious about newly
constructed buildings.
Some of the most commonly held
misconceptions, Martinez explained,
relate to President Herbert Hoover, a
member of the first class which
graduated in 1895.
"People assume that because he
has a tower everybody likes him,"
said Martinez, even though the most
thought many students have given to
the depression era president last sur
faced in high school American history
classes.
While Hoover Tower, affection
ately referred to by many as
"Hoover's last erection," may have
failed to immortalize the former
president as a historical figure, the
structure itself has gained a somewhat
infamous legend about it as a suicide
jump-off point. Martinez noted that
visitors often ask about committing
suicide from the top of the tower, al
though this is virtually impossible
unless one is extremely thin, as the
narrow rails fence in the 250-foot
high observation platform.
Most questions, however, are not
out of the ordinary. "They're afraid

to ask questions in a large group,"
said Martinez.
As a guide myself, I have con
cluded, too, that most visitors stick to
"socially acceptable" questions like,
"Where is the Bookstore?" "Is there
going to be another earthquake while
I am in the top of the tower?" (fol
lowed by nervous laughter, even
when assured that the only major
quake so far was in 1906), "Is food
service as bad as they say?" and
""What is that tree over there?" (To
this last question, I ignorantly say that
it is a "palo alto" (tall tree) whether it
is a bush or a redwood.)
Guests also ask if Stanford includes
a junior college when they see the
I.eland Stanford, Jr. sweatshirts. The
answer is no, of course, as the univer
sity was named in memory of Leland
and Jane Stanford's son, Leland, Jr.
And there will always be someone
like junior Celeste Kruzic, who asked
her guide, "Where do you go for an
ice cream cone?"
Martinez observed that "not
enough Stanford students go to the
top of the tower," just as many New
Yorkers have not been to the top of
the Empire State Building. Most
guides agree that the majority of vis
itors to the last erection fall into the
"paid admission" category —they are
mainly foreign visitors and high
school students, even though a trip to
the campus landmark—or eye-sore,
it's up to you —is free for students and
University personnel. Even alumns
must pay a 50-cent admission fee.
Now aren't you dying to go on a
tour? If you can't make the free 45-

minute walking tours which leave
from the visitor information cell in
front of the quadrangle at 11:00 a.m.
and 2:15 p.m. Monday through
Saturday, here's a somewhat edited
version you can safely read at your
desk, without dodging cyclists or
being pegged by passersby as a
tourist:
The University is privately sup
ported and nondenominational. It
opened in 1891. Senator Leland
Stanford and his wife, Jane, dedicated
the then 8800-acre (now 8200-acre)
education center to their son, Leland,
who died of typhoid fever at 16. They
sought to "educate the children of
California."
About 465 students—including
Herbert Hoover—entered the first
class. About 13,000 students, slightly
over half of these undergraduate, now
attend the university. Stanford has
been coeducational since it opened.
Memorial Church was completed in
1903, destroyed in the 1906 ear
thquake and reopened in 1915. The
church houses services each Sunday
at 11 a.m.
Now you've got the basics—satisfy
your own curiosity on your own if
you'd like; most departments or
museums or libraries or even the
Bookstore can provide you with more
information on the subject of your
choice.
And do take a tour if you're so in
clined, but remember, we tour guides
don't know it all either as I found out
one day in Memorial Church, when a
little child looked up at me and asked,
"Is God here?"
