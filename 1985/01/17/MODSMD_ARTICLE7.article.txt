Airline faces possible fine
WASHINGTON — The Federal Aviation Administration has pro
posed a $375,000 civil penalty against American Airlines, the nation's
second largest, for using a plastic rather than a required metal part in
McDonnell Douglas DC-10s even after the plastic part failed on two oc
casions.
The proposal arose from an FAA investigation after a slat on the right
wing of an American Airlines DC-10 fell off as the jumbo jet was land
ing at Dallas-Fort Worth airport last Sept. 14, the FAA said.
Slats are curved metal plates that are extended from the front of the
wing. There are eight on each wing of a DC-10. They are used during
takeoffs and landings when planes move at slower speeds and need extra
lift to gain altitude or to remain under control while descending.
The loss of a slat is not unknown and does not necessarily endanger
flight, aviation experts said yesterday. However, the loss of slats on one
wing was blamed by the National Transportation Safety Board for the
nation's worst aviation accident, the takeoff crash of an American
Airlines DC-10 that killed 273 people in Chicago in May 1979.
In the Dallas-Fort Worth incident, investigators found that a phenolic,
or plastic, pulley instead of a stronger aluminum pulley was carrying the
slat retraction cable.
The plane involved there and two others cited in the FAA penalty let
ter to American made at least 1,165 flights with the wrong pulleys, and
thus were in "an unairworthy condition" on those flights, the FAA said.
On two occasions — including the Dallas-Fort Worth incident — the
plastic pulley failed, the FAA said.
"What concerns us is that this happened, they had a warning, and it
wasn't caught," a federal source said.
Reagan told to clarify arms stand
WASHINGTON — The Reagan administration must clarify the
seeming contradictions in its positions on the "Star Wars" space defense
proposal and on arms control if it wants congressional support for those
programs. Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.), the new chairman of the House
Armed Services Committee, warned yesterday.
Until now, "the administration has been able to have it both ways,"
complained Aspin, who addressed the arms control and defense budget
issues for the first time since he unseated octogenarian Rep. Melvin
Price (D-III.) for the key job. For example, he noted, the administration
argues that "Star Wars" and the MX missile could be bargaining chips in
upcoming arms control negotiations with the Soviets, while at the same
time it declares "we aren't going to give them up."
But if the administration wants Congress to fund its weapons requests
and support its arms control negotiating positions, "it is going to have to
spell out its positions with considerably more clarity," Aspin said in a
speech at the Carnegie Endowment for World Peace.
In particular, he indicated that the ambiguity surrounding the $26 bil
lion "Star Wars" program, also known as the Strategic Defense Initia
tive (SDI), must be cleared up. And he signaled that funding for weap
ons such as those contained in "Star Wars" will be closely scrutinized —
and perhaps held hostage to acceptable administration bargaining posi
tions at the arms talks.
Aspin accepted the adminstration argument that Congress should not
eliminate U.S. weapons systems that could otherwise be bargained for
cuts in Soviet weapons. But he also warned that Congress will not
"rubber stamp" administration arms requests just because arms talks are
under way.
Urban League head makes plea
WASHINGTON — The president of the National Urban League
called on President Reagan yesterday to "take a handful of small steps
that could begin to heal the breach between his administration and black
people."
John Jacob, in issuing the league's 10th annual report on "the state of
black America," said blacks "have been sliding backward in the 1980s"
after making important gains in the two previous decades. To help
"reverse that trend," Jacob urged that Reagan:
• Support a civil rights bill to overturn the Supreme Court's so-called
Grove City College decision, which sharply limited the scope of an anti
sex discrimination law and, some fear, could lead to similar court
imposed restrictions on laws banning racial bias.
• End the U.S. policy of "constructive engagement," or quiet diplomacy,
toward South Africa's racially separatist regime.
• Halt "ill-tempered attacks" by administration officials on black organ
izations and on "important principles such as affirmative action and
desegregation."
• Strongly support the administration's own proposal for enterprise
zones, which involves giving tax breaks to businesses that locate in
blighted areas.
• Stop pushing for cuts in social programs that help the poor.
• "Open the channel of communication between the White House and
black America."
U.S. delegation talks to Soviets
MOSCOW — A U.S. congressional delegation told Soviet officials
yesterday that progress on arms control is linked to improvement in
Moscow's record on human rights and emigration.
Soviet officials rejected any such "linkage" and expressed resentment
that the American lawmakers even raised the issue, leaders of the U.S.
group said at a news conference.
Despite the confrontation, however, the 10 visiting members of the
House of Representatives said they received a warmer welcome than
they had anticipated.
Rep. E. Thomas Coleman (R-Mo.) attributed the positive tone to a
mood of cooperation growing out of U.S.-Soviet arms control talks in
Geneva, Switzerland, last week. "I think they are looking for an oppor
tunity to walk down a new road toward better relations with the United
States," he said.
Rep. Tom Lantos (D-Calif.) said that the delegation he led reflected
the mood of Congress when it pressed the human rights issue.
"We did not come here to have phony euphoria or get the key to the
Kremlin." he said. "This issue will not go away.
"The (negotiating) climate will be poisoned if their human rights
record is as bad as it is now," said Lantos, co-chairman of the human
rights caucus in the House. "There's some feeling the Soviet Union is
ready to move toward detente without a human face, and we don't think
we have to buy improvement in the overall situation at the expense of
human rights."
Donovan trial remains in New York
A federal judge held yesterday that the criminal charges against Labor
Secretary Raymond Donovan "in no way pertain" to his official duties,
and rejected Donovan's petition to have his case moved into federal
court.
U.S. District Court Judge Lloyd MacMahon of New York ruled that
the indictment should be prosecuted in state court in the Bronx where it
was brought in September. The indictment accuses Donovan and 11
other defendants of grand larceny, falsifying business records and filing
false documents in connection with a 6-year-old New York City subway
project.
Donovan and his lawyers had sought to sever his case from that of the
others and have it tried separately in federal court under a so-called
"removal statute" dating back to 1815. The law was enacted to protect
federal officials from being tried in state courts for acts committed
"undercolor" of their government positions.
Widespread gains for stocks
NEW YORK — The stock market posted widespread gains yesterday,
although the blue-chip issues represented by the Dow Jones industrial
average lagged behind for the second straight session.
Dow Jones's average of 30 big-name industrials slipped .11 to
1,230.68.
But most other, broader market measures chalked up gains. Advances
outpaced declines by more than 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Ex
change.

argues that "Star Wars" and the MX missile could be bargaining chips in
upcoming arms control negotiations with the Soviets, while at the same
time it declares "we aren't going to give them up."
But if the administration wants Congress to fund its weapons requests
and support its arms control negotiating positions, "it is going to have to
spell out its positions with considerably more clarity," Aspin said in a
speech at the Carnegie Endowment for World Peace.
In particular, he indicated that the ambiguity surrounding the $26 bil
lion "Star Wars" program, also known as the Strategic Defense Initia
tive (SDI), must be cleared up. And he signaled that funding for weap
ons such as those contained in "Star Wars" will be closely scrutinized —
and perhaps held hostage to acceptable administration bargaining posi
tions at the arms talks.
Aspin accepted the adminstration argument that Congress should not
eliminate U.S. weapons systems that could otherwise be bargained for
cuts in Soviet weapons. But he also warned that Congress will not
"rubber stamp" administration arms requests just because arms talks are
under way.
Urban League head makes plea
WASHINGTON — The president of the National Urban League
called on President Reagan yesterday to "take a handful of small steps
that could begin to heal the breach between his administration and black
people."
John Jacob, in issuing the league's 10th annual report on "the state of
black America," said blacks "have been sliding backward in the 1980s"
after making important gains in the two previous decades. To help
"reverse that trend," Jacob urged that Reagan:
• Support a civil rights bill to overturn the Supreme Court's so-called
Grove City College decision, which sharply limited the scope of an anti
sex discrimination law and, some fear, could lead to similar court
imposed restrictions on laws banning racial bias.
• End the U.S. policy of "constructive engagement," or quiet diplomacy,
toward South Africa's racially separatist regime.
• Halt "ill-tempered attacks" by administration officials on black organ
izations and on "important principles such as affirmative action and
desegregation."
• Strongly support the administration's own proposal for enterprise
zones, which involves giving tax breaks to businesses that locate in
blighted areas.
• Stop pushing for cuts in social programs that help the poor.
• "Open the channel of communication between the White House and
black America."
U.S. delegation talks to Soviets
MOSCOW — A U.S. congressional delegation told Soviet officials
yesterday that progress on arms control is linked to improvement in
Moscow's record on human rights and emigration.
Soviet officials rejected any such "linkage" and expressed resentment
that the American lawmakers even raised the issue, leaders of the U.S.
group said at a news conference.
Despite the confrontation, however, the 10 visiting members of the
House of Representatives said they received a warmer welcome than
they had anticipated.
Rep. E. Thomas Coleman (R-Mo.) attributed the positive tone to a
mood of cooperation growing out of U.S.-Soviet arms control talks in
Geneva, Switzerland, last week. "I think they are looking for an oppor
tunity to walk down a new road toward better relations with the United
States," he said.
Rep. Tom Lantos (D-Calif.) said that the delegation he led reflected
the mood of Congress when it pressed the human rights issue.
"We did not come here to have phony euphoria or get the key to the
Kremlin." he said. "This issue will not go away.
"The (negotiating) climate will be poisoned if their human rights
record is as bad as it is now," said Lantos, co-chairman of the human
rights caucus in the House. "There's some feeling the Soviet Union is
ready to move toward detente without a human face, and we don't think
we have to buy improvement in the overall situation at the expense of
human rights."
Donovan trial remains in New York
A federal judge held yesterday that the criminal charges against Labor
Secretary Raymond Donovan "in no way pertain" to his official duties,
and rejected Donovan's petition to have his case moved into federal
court.
U.S. District Court Judge Lloyd MacMahon of New York ruled that
the indictment should be prosecuted in state court in the Bronx where it
was brought in September. The indictment accuses Donovan and 11
other defendants of grand larceny, falsifying business records and filing
false documents in connection with a 6-year-old New York City subway
project.
Donovan and his lawyers had sought to sever his case from that of the
others and have it tried separately in federal court under a so-called
"removal statute" dating back to 1815. The law was enacted to protect
federal officials from being tried in state courts for acts committed
"undercolor" of their government positions.
Widespread gains for stocks
NEW YORK — The stock market posted widespread gains yesterday,
although the blue-chip issues represented by the Dow Jones industrial
average lagged behind for the second straight session.
Dow Jones's average of 30 big-name industrials slipped .11 to
1,230.68.
But most other, broader market measures chalked up gains. Advances
outpaced declines by more than 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Ex
change.

Airline faces possible fine
WASHINGTON — The Federal Aviation Administration has pro
posed a $375,000 civil penalty against American Airlines, the nation's
second largest, for using a plastic rather than a required metal part in
McDonnell Douglas DC-10s even after the plastic part failed on two oc
casions.
The proposal arose from an FAA investigation after a slat on the right
wing of an American Airlines DC-10 fell off as the jumbo jet was land
ing at Dallas-Fort Worth airport last Sept. 14, the FAA said.
Slats are curved metal plates that are extended from the front of the
wing. There are eight on each wing of a DC-10. They are used during
takeoffs and landings when planes move at slower speeds and need extra
lift to gain altitude or to remain under control while descending.
The loss of a slat is not unknown and does not necessarily endanger
flight, aviation experts said yesterday. However, the loss of slats on one
wing was blamed by the National Transportation Safety Board for the
nation's worst aviation accident, the takeoff crash of an American
Airlines DC-10 that killed 273 people in Chicago in May 1979.
In the Dallas-Fort Worth incident, investigators found that a phenolic,
or plastic, pulley instead of a stronger aluminum pulley was carrying the
slat retraction cable.
The plane involved there and two others cited in the FAA penalty let
ter to American made at least 1,165 flights with the wrong pulleys, and
thus were in "an unairworthy condition" on those flights, the FAA said.
On two occasions — including the Dallas-Fort Worth incident — the
plastic pulley failed, the FAA said.
"What concerns us is that this happened, they had a warning, and it
wasn't caught," a federal source said.
Reagan told to clarify arms stand
WASHINGTON — The Reagan administration must clarify the
seeming contradictions in its positions on the "Star Wars" space defense
proposal and on arms control if it wants congressional support for those
programs. Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.), the new chairman of the House
Armed Services Committee, warned yesterday.
Until now, "the administration has been able to have it both ways,"
complained Aspin, who addressed the arms control and defense budget
issues for the first time since he unseated octogenarian Rep. Melvin
Price (D-III.) for the key job. For example, he noted, the administration
argues that "Star Wars" and the MX missile could be bargaining chips in
upcoming arms control negotiations with the Soviets, while at the same
