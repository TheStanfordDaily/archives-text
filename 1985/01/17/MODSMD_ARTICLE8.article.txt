# Sharon wins first round of suit
## 
### 
NEW YORK â€” Former Israeli
Defense Minister Ariel Sharon won
the first step in his $50 million libel
suit against Time magazine yesterday
when a jury ruled that a 1983 Time
magazine cover story about Sharon
was defamatory.
After about 14 hours of delibera
tions, the panel decided that the Time
paragraph at issue in the case said, in
effect, that Sharon "consciously in
tended to permit" Christian
Lebanese militia to massacre inno
cent Palestinians in West Beirut
refugee camps in September 1982.
The jury then resumed delibera
tions on other issues to determine
whether Sharon was libeled.
Upon hearing the partial verdict,
Sharon looked defiantly around the
courtroom, breaking a faint smile
only when he looked at his wife, Lili,
beside him.
Following the verdict. Time issued
a statement saying that "the jury
completely misread what Time said."
Time magazine Managing Editor
Ray Cave also said, "There is still a

long way to go" before the case is
decided.
Sharon in response told reporters,
"I m pleased that we won on this
point. 1 am sorry that Time magazine
is charging that the jury does not un
derstand plain English."
Yesterday's ruling was just the first
in a four-stage test Sharon must pass
to win his libel suit. The jury must
now decide whether the defamatory
paragraph is untrue, and whether
Time printed it with malice or with
reckless disregard for the truth.
Then, if necessary, in a second part
of the trial, the jury must hear tes
timony and rule whether the para
graph has actually damaged Sharon's
reputation. Only if such damage is
determined would libel be estab
lished. In that case, the jury could
next determine how much compensa
tion Sharon deserved.
In the paragraph at issue. Time re
ported that Sharon "discussed the
need for revenge" with Lebanese
lenders the day before he allowed

them to enter the Sabra and Shatilla
refugee camps, where hundreds of
refugees were massacred.
The jury yesterday decided that,
"The paragraph in context states that,
in permitting the Phalangists (the
Lebanese militia) to enter Sabra and
Shatilla, Minister Sharon consciously
intended to permit the Phalangists to
take acts of revenge extending to the
deliberate killing of noncombatants
in the camps."
The jury, however, said the para
graph did not suggest that Sharon
"actively encouraged" the massacre,
something Sharon's attorneys had
also alleged the paragraph implied.
In the original paragraph. Time
also reported that details of Sharon's
alleged conversation were contained
in a secret Appendix B of an Israeli
government report on the massacre,
an allegation Time now concedes was
incorrect.
In its partial verdict, the jury ruled
that "the defamatory effect of the
paragraph was aggravated by Time's

statement that details of the alleged
conversation were contained in Ap
pendix B. . . ."
If the jury finds the paragraph was
false, it could now find that Time
committed libel if it decides that Time
fabricated the element about Appen
dix B. Time already has admitted it
"inferred" this element.
Cave told reporters after the partial
verdict that Time still stood by every
element of its story and would not
even want to rephrase any of it were
it doing the story now, except for its
allegation about Appendix B.
Sharon attorney Milton Gould
said. "It's one down and two to go."
Time attorney Thomas Barr told
reporters that even if the jury finds
that Time libeled Sharon, the maga
zine technically would still win the
case if the jury found that Sharon's
reputation was not damaged by the
libel and refused to award him dama
ges.
