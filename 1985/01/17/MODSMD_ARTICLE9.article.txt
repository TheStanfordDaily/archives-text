# Agree to contribute $900 million
## W. Germans join space project 
### 
BONN, West Germany — The West German
government agreed yesterday to contribute $900
million over the next decade to participate in an
American-led program to set up a permanently
manned space station.
The decision came in response to President
Reagan's appeal, made a year ago, for Europe,
Japan and Canada to join the United States in
building and funding the $8 billion Columbus
space-station project. Italy, France and Britain are
expected to announce their intentions by the end of
the month.
If all goes according to plan, the manned labora
tory and observation craft would be launched into
space in 1992, the 500 th anniversary of Christo
pher Columbus discovery of America.
Heinz Riesenhuber, West Germany's minister
for research and technology, said that the planned
cooperation in space between Europe and the
United States carried great political and economic
significance for transatlantic relations.
He said that during a review phase over the next
two years, precise and detailed contracts must be
negotiated with the United States to ensure that
European countries in the program earn a fair
return on their investments.
The Bonn government sees its participation in
the venture as an important way of gaining access

to space-based technology as well as experience in
developing orbiting stations that could reap com
mercial benefits.
U.S. restrictions on the transfer of technology,
ostensibly to prevent the Soviet Union from acquir
ing sensitive goods or information from third
countries, have increasingly irked the European
allies, who fear that such limits are hindering devel
opment of their own high-technology sectors.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government sees the
prospect of close cooperation on the space station
as a way to obligate the United States to share com
plete access to important space research data.
West German and Italian companies are plan
ning to develop a special laboratory module that
would plug into the main body of the U.S.-built
spacecraft. It would be used by scientists to conduct
experiments in the zero gravity and vacuum condi
tions of space. Several drug and manufacturing
companies here have expressed keen interest in
such experiments.
Besides the potential economic dividends, the
Kohl government sees the project as a way to for
tify bonds within the Western alliance.
Nonetheless, the venture has evoked some con
troversy. Some scientists are skeptical about the
need for a manned space probe and contend that
robots could conduct more efficiently the kind of

work envisioned in the space station.
In addition, Europe's previous involvement in a
U.S. space project was seen as less than successful.
European countries spent $750 million in 1973 to
underwrite Spacelah. yet failed to win much in the
way of research benefits.
Another argument against European coopera
tion with the U.S. program is that it exhausts pre
cious money that some politicians say should he
earmarked exclusively for projects that foster
Europe's own capabilities in space.
Riesenhuber said yesterday that Bonn would
contribute nearly $500 million to development of a
more powerful and versatile Ariane rocket, built
mainly by France, to make Europe more indepen
dent in space travel by the 1 9905. But Riensehuber
admitted that West Germany would not be able to
afford a major investment in the French space
shuttle project known as "Hermes."
He said the concept of a European space shuttle
was "very interesting" but that Bonn's involvement
in the space station and an upgraded Ariane rocket
precluded participation in a third costly space pro
gram.
