# A 						super 11th-hour flurry
## 'Everything that needs to be done needs to be done so quickly...' 
### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
Kickoff was still 72 hours away, but you never
would have known it from the scene outside Stan
ford Stadium yesterday afternoon, where workers,
performers, concessionaires, security guards and
journalists gathered in throngs to face llth-hour
preparations for what one local television station is
simply calling "you know what."
As the last-minute hammering, drilling and
painting rendered Super Bowl XIX a reality, offi-

SUPERBOWL

cials in Stanford's Super Bowl trailer conceded that
yesterday was the busiest in more than a week of
12-hour work days.
Meg Donovan, an Athletic Department official
Working in the trailer, apologized for not having
time yesterday to answer questions.
"Everything that needs to be done needs to be
done so quickly that we don't have any time to tell
people what it is that needs to be done," Donovan
said.
Donovan and her co-workers in the trailer are
spending most of their time answering questions via
phone, walkie-talkie or in person. They explain
why the stadium is closed for tours, where fans can
park on game day and how the fleet of buses and
trucks should make their deliveries.
Sue Robichek, another worker in the trailer, said
the crowd around Gate Two yesterday afternoon
— numbering more than 2,000 by some estimates
— included many just hoping to get a glimpse of
the final Super Bowl preparations.
"People want to see what the stadium looks
like," said Robichek. "They want to buy souvenirs.
They all want to get in."

"I just wanted to see a part of history," explained
one Stanford student who stopped by the stadium.
Others came to see whatever they could of the
Air Force's top-secret halftime show. Performers in
both the halftime and pre-game show staged dress
rehearsals inside the stadium yesterday.
The 650 U.S. Air Force volunteers, some out
fitted in baggy nylon clown suits, some wearing
blue sequined costumes with white-tipped canes and
top hats, marched into the stadium around 4:30
p.m. to practice a 12-minute show that has "a nice
patriotic flair," according to an Air Force spokes
man.
One Air Force official, dressed in a pastel clown
suit and propeller beanie, solemnly directed the
crew down the ramp to the stadium as he barked
orders into his walkie-talkie.
Also on hand were more than 100 dancers and
cheerleaders from area high schools who will per
form in the pre-game show. After the rehearsal,
participants crowded the Gate Two souvenir stand
where official Super Bowl XIX posters cost $6, hats
go for $15 and sweatshirts run anywhere from $28
to $36.
Concessionaires said 3 to 5 p.m. yesterday were
"the two busiest hours" of the week.
One worker said several customers bought more
than $200 worth of merchandise, and "most of the
kids are spending $60 to $70 each."
Elsewhere in the Gate Two area, a crowd of 50
or more watched one hapless television reporter
deliver a 10-second stand-up news commentary —
again and again. The group cheered when the
reporter finally finished his segment and coiled his
microphone, to which he responded, "Is this the
funnest thing you guys have to do?"
At Angell Field, several hundred yards west of
the stadium, a dozen workers put the finishing
touches on the huge tent that will house the Ford
Motor Co. tailgater. Meanwhile, joggers circled the
outside track, seemingly oblivious to the heavy ma
chinery and trucks that crossed their path.

One man who was doing sit-ups in the infield
looked up long enough to shrug his shoulders and
shout over the din, "We pretend it's not here."
Meanwhile, ABC prepared for its first Super
Bowl by asking a group of fraternity brothers from
the Theta Delta Chi house to don football shirts
and participate in a scrimmage. Today, they'll
repeat the process inside the stadium so ABC can
coordinate its 22-camera coverage.
The mock game, complete with uniforms bearing
numbers corresponding to real players on each
team, will cost the network approximately
$400,000 for two hours. The action starts at 3:15
p.m. as ABC attempts to replicate the exact game
conditions.
"The whole gist of this thing is a practice run for
the cameras," said Alan Brown, a senior in the
Theta Delt house. "They don't want to be guessing
on Sunday."
"We did a few simulated field goals, punt
returns, kickoffs," said Brown.
Brown said today's mock game will also feature
seven Pacific-10 Conference referees, ballboys and
a chain marker for measuring first downs.
Meanwhile, the action at the Bay Area Super
Bowl Task Force offices in San Francisco was
equally frenetic yesterday. Delia Schletter, execu
tive director of the Task Force, said she was hand
ling queries from ticket-holding fans and members
of the national press.
"It's absolutely wild around here," Schletter
said. "We're getting calls from Anchorage, Alaska,
Miami, Cincinnati, all across the country, asking,
'Where can we get housing, cars, parking?' "
Schletter said she fielded calls from the British
Broadcasting Corporation and a Japanese media
group just before talking to The Daily yesterday.
But she said that despite the hectic pace, the
planning is going even smoother than she expected
— so far.

One of the hundreds of participants in the Air Force's Super Bowl
halftime show clowns around Stanford Stadium yesterday as prepara
tions for the game reached a frenzy.
"We planned for the worst. At
times. I've been charged with over
planning. But the worst that can hap
pen is you're prepared for the worst,
and we were."
Elsewhere in San Francisco, mem
bers of the national press were doing
the same things they had done earlier
in the week — looking for the unique
storv and going to the city's best bars
and restaurants.
Marc Fisher, a reporter with The
Miami Herald who arrived in the Bay
Area Sunday, said the party circuit is
keeping the press busy. On Wednes
day, Fisher went to a Super Bowl

Task Force hash. Last night was Gov.
Deukmejian's Oakland party, and
Saturday night belongs to Pete
Rozelle. commissioner of the NFI..
