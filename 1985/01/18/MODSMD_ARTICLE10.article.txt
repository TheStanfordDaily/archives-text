## Students depart as Bowl arrives 
### CAMERON KALLER Staff writer 
When the most famous football game in the
country comes to campus Sunday, few students will
be on hand to see it.
"Everybody is getting out of here," said senior
Margo Friedland. "I think it's a really great idea
that Stanford has the Super Bowl here, but by the
same token, it's a big inconvenience. There's no
way you'll be able to get on or around campus this
weekend unless you have a bicycle, which I happen
not to," Friedland said.
Sophomore Jennifer Grant said of her plans,
"I'm going to Napa, San Francisco and Carmel. I
decided to do everything just so I could avoid being
here this weekend."
Because students have a three-day weekend —
on Monday the University commemorates the birth
of Martin Luther King, Jr. — many are taking the
opportunity to go skiing, visit local areas or just
"get away from it all."
Many Stanford student-athletes, however, are
donating their time for pre-game and first-quarter
activities such as ushering, greeting corporate buses
and taking tickets in exchange for a chance to
watch the rest of the game free of charge.

Senior Jen Bleakley said, "Supposedly we can
see the game after we're done helping out, hut it all
depends on where one gets placed. If you're inside
the stadium at the 50-yard line showing people to
their seats, you've certainly got the best opportu
nity."
"It seems that they've given priority to the var
sity athletes for the best jobs, like ushering, she
said. "All the athletes are pretty excited about it.
The events organizer from the NFL came and gave
us all instructions and a pep talk. . . . It's going to
be pretty neat to get in."
Many students who are unable to gain entrance
to the game have organized parties in front of their
television screens instead.
According to Sigma Alpha Epsilon President Jon
Peterson, "A bunch of the guys are getting some
beer on tap and having our cook make up a big buf
fet and they'll all watch the game on a big screen
TV, then maybe walk around the stadium later
on."
Peterson said he entered the Stanford lottery for
tickets to the game and didn't win, but that he
"probably wouldn't have gone to the game
anyway."
"I'm not really a big football fan — even though

the 49ers are playing and 1 am from San Fran
cisco."
Many Stanford football players were offered the
chance to serve as security guards in and around
the game, hut not all of them took up the offer.
Said defensive lineman Bob Jansen, "I had the
opportunity to be a guard, but chose to get away
. . . anyplace."
Cardinal wide receiver Emile Harry plans to
spend Friday and Saturday nights "tailgaiting in the
City with a bunch of close friends with enough beer
and sandwiches to knock an elephant off its feet.
Harry said that he'll then "hold a motor home
which will be strategically parked ahead of time
and sit in the stands game day with a Corona beer,
my 35mm camera with zoom lense, and view the
game with my binoculars and my 49ers
memorabilia."
Junior Laurie Onderdonk summed up the
weekend,,saying, "Sure, all the preparation and in
convenience is a drag, but when hundreds of mil
lions of people are actually zeroing in on the
campus and the game, it'll be great. I think it's
really good for Stanford to have the Super Bowl
here. After all, Cal has never had a Super Bowl."
