# Eyes of the world to be on game

Super Bowl Sunday.
The day America stands still.
But what of the rest of the world?
Does anyone else care?
Apparently so. In one form or an
other, by one means or another, more
than 30 countries will view the spec
tacle, according to a National Foot
ball League spokesperson.
The NFL hired Trans World Inter
national to arrange television
coverage around the world, except in
North America. That, of course, is
ABC's domain.
Nancy Behar, assistant to NFL
Director of Broadcasting Val

Pinchbeck, said determining the exact
number of foreign lands slated to
receive this game of games is virtually
impossible, because some are getting
it live, some on tape, some on cable
and still others on closed-circuit tele
vision. Some even get it in several
forms.
But she was able to say that Great
Britain, Japan, Italy, Canada and
Mexico will have their own commen
tators at the stadium. All other
countries will make do with adding
their commentary to the video images
sent to them.
Behar said Britain, Australia, Italy,
Japan, France, Chile and the

Dominican Republic will get live
broadcasts from Trans World Inter
national. ABC will provide the game
live to Canada, Mexico, the Virgin Is
lands and Puerto Rico.
Members of the American armed
forces abroad will also view the game
live if they have the good fortune to
be stationed in Italy, Spain, the
Philippines, Samoa, Guam, Cuba,
Puerto Rico, Panama, Iceland,
Korea, Greenland, Newfoundland,
West Germany, Belgium or the
Azores, Portugal.
But that's not all. Foreign countries
getting the Super Bowl on tape in
clude Saudi Arabia, Thailand, Hong

Kong, Lebanon, South Africa, West
Germany, Belgium and Israel.
If you'll be in Singapore or Paris
this Sunday, watch the game on cable
television.
And fans in Costa Rica, El Sal
vador, Nicaragua, Guatemala and
Honduras will watch the game as
well.
Britain, Netherlands, Sweden, Fin
land, Norway, West Germany,
Austria and Switzerland will also
pick up the game, via a "sky chan
nel."
"Don't even ask me what that
means," Behar said.
We didn't.
