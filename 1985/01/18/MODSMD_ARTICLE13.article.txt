## The
						Stanford Daily Start of something Super 
### 
Fun. Put simply, that's the most important rea
son people come to Stanford.
And so they should: The Farm's got football,
volleyball, swimming, golf, tennis, sailing and
windsurfing, and all of it under that bright Cali
fornia sun. Nearly half of the students here come
from within the state. No surprise there: Why
leave paradise? And the other half, the out-of
staters, just want a piece of the action.
But as if this idyllic, country-club atmosphere
weren't enough, the University recently has
begun to provide us even more entertainment
value for our tuition dollar.
Last summer, we had the soccer Olympics: nine
games of international pageantry. And this
weekend, Stanford plays host to the biggest event
in American sports, the Super Bowl.
This makes for a good start. If we play our
cards right, Stanford Stadium could be the next
site of the Battle of the Network Stars. But we
should remember that there is more to Stanford
than its stadium.
Lake Lagunita, for instance. This sun
drenched expanse of blue could be used for the

National Speedboat Championships, public para
sailing and a site for our very own regatta: Leland
Jr.'s Cup.
The hills around the Dish would be perfect for
the Western Regional Moto-cross Finals, and
with only a little remodeling. Maples Pavilion
could host both roller derby and all-star wres
tling.
But if we're truly going to become the new en
tertainment capital of the world, we can't restrict
ourselves to sporting events: a gaming room in
Meyer, slot machines in Tresidder, top-name en
tertainers in Dink, rodeos in Sunken Diamond:
The possibilities are endless.
Ringling Bros, and Barnum and Bailey could
set up a tent in the Oval. And we could give free
circus tickets to alumni who help pay for campus
improvements. We could even host a World's
Fair, with every dorm serving as a pavilion for an
exhibiting country.
Stanford would become a household word, and
within 10 years, every kid in America — maybe
even the world — will want to come here. And
isn't that what we want?
