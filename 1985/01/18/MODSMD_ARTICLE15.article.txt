Segal spectacle
On my way to the noon rally on
Tuesday commemorating the birth of
Martin Luther King, Jr.. 1 was
profoundly saddened to see several
men mocking the George Segal
sculpture that celebrates gay libera
tion. As four men posed in the
original positions of the sculpture, a
few other men stood around them
with hammers, no doubt re-enacting
last winter's brutal assault on the
sculpture.
Martin Luther King, Jr. was a
person who struggled ardently and
nonviolently for the rights, freedom,
dignity and equality of black people
in particular and for all oppressed
members of society in general. How
ironic that some Stanford students
took the occasion of his birthday to
flaunt their ignorance, fear and
hatred of homosexuals, yet another
group suffering from discrimination
and oppression in this grossly violent
society.
The biases that people hold
against others for their sexual
preferences are just as the harmful as
the prejudices against blacks that
King worked to eradicate (but which
still persist). If these prejudices are
allowed to stand unchallenged, they
perpetuate, among other things,
economic inequalities and psycholog
ical alienation. And they ultimately
lead to violence. Violence: the assas
sination of Dr. Martin Luther King.
Violence: the slaying of gay San
Francisco Supervisor Harvey Milk.
Violence: the hammering of Segal's
Gay Liberation sculpture.
The only hope for an end to this

kind of violence is if people do not
complacently rely on fixed roles and
stereotypes to justify violence and
discrimination against any other
group or individual. I do not know
why those men were mocking Segal's
sculpture, but I hope that they begin
to question their actions. I hope, too,
that those people who walked by
them laughing in endorsement of
their actions also begin to challenge
why they would laugh at this repre
sentation of violence against
homosexuals.

Guilt by gender
I've heard of guilt by association,
but guilt by gender? Rape is cer
tainly an evil thing some individual
men do, but does Noel Hanrahan
(The Daily, Jan. 14) honestly mean to
indict every male on the planet for
the sins of some? That's a nasty
obsession she's got going.
She "call[s] on men to change the
atmosphere of fear and terrorism
that male power feeds upon." How,
precisely, does she propose we do
that? Convene a conference of all
human males and pass a resolution?
Now that she has perfected her
rationalization for the ultimate
sexism, she might consider applying
her reasoning — virtually unchanged
— to rationalizing racism. The Ku
Klux Klan could use a Stanford
trained theoretician with her gift for
blanket generalization.
