## Nuclear freeze: the time has passed 
### 
The easy part is over! The United States and the
Soviet Union have agreed to resume arms-control
talks. The real challenge for the United States is
now to develop overall objectives and a negotiating
position that can lead to positive results. Many sug
gestions have been put forth from within and
outside the administration. The intent here is not to

VIEWPOINT

add to this list, but rather to subtract one outdated
proposal; namely, the call to adopt "as an immedi
ate strategic arms objective ... a mutual and
verifiable freeze on the testing, production and
future deployment of nuclear warheads, missiles
and other delivery systems."
Freeze proponents claim this proposal still en
joys widespread bipartisan support. The reason for
this is simple but deceptive. As it has evolved, the
freeze has become all things to all people. It has al
most as many definitions as it does advocates. Part
of the problem stems from the proposal's attempt
to serve two purposes. On one hand, it represents a
symbol of international concern over the arms race.
On the other, it proposes a solution to the problem.
To its credit, the movement has served as a rally
ing cry to send American and Soviet leaders a
strong message that the time for progress on arms
control is clearly at hand. Unfortunately, the freeze
proposal does not provide a blueprint for achieving
the safer world that its proponents, and all other
Americans, desire. As is the case with most emo
tional slogans, its flaws become all too apparent
when held up to the light of today's strategic
realities.
A freeze in the testing and deployment of new
delivery systems would leave the United States at a
disadvantage over time, if not immediately. The
overwhelming majority of the Soviet's strategic sys
tems (some 90 percent) are less than 10 years old;

about half of these have been introduced in the last
five years. By contrast, only about 15 percent of
U.S. systems are under 10 years old; the majority
have been in the field for 15 to 20 years or longer.
The age disparity is too great not to recognize. One
can argue that a particular system may be poten
tially destabilizing or otherwise undesirable. But to
rule out all modernization is dangerous and self
defeating. That is why many arms-control advo
cates prefer instead a concept that would reduce
rather than freeze the number of weapons while
still permitting modernization of aging systems.
Freeze advocates share the desire to see the size
of both sides' nuclear arsenals reduced. The catch

ization is dangerous and

is, the United States will only reduce its numbers if
it is confident about the quality and survivability of
those that remain. Security does not derive from
the size of the force per se, but from its ability to
deter war. A smaller but modernized force can pro
vide greater security than a large outmoded one.
The freeze, by preventing qualitative improve
ments, makes force reductions less desirable if not
dangerously destabilizing.
The call for a halt to all forms of production
represents another flaw in the freeze concept.
Much has been said about "national technical
means" of verification. But, satellites cannot see
inside buildings any more than they can see inside
crates aboard Soviet ships bound for Nicaragua.

There are many areas, particularly though not ex
clusively relating to production, where "national
technical means" cannot provide assurance of com
pliance. Arms control proposals with Moscow must
only cover those aspects that are mutually
verifiable; a production freeze is not.
In the past, the administration has been accused
of trying to undermine the arms control process by
making proposals it knew in advance were unnc-<
ceptable to the Soviets. The president, wViWe ac
knowledging that the Soviets found his earlier offers
less than desirable, has stated that reaching an arms
control agreement is now his No. 1 priority. The
proposals he puts forth in the coming months will
show the world how serious this pledge is or is not.
Meanwhile, freeze proponents, by insisting on a
proposal they know the administration finds unac
ceptable, appear guilty of the same tactic they
accuse the president of following. To them the
freeze has become an all-or-nothing proposition.
They claim that the only alternative to the freeze is
"a continued and escalating arms race and possibly
a nuclear war."
The freeze is not an end in itself. The goal is to
determine how best to reduce the risk of nuclear
war. The freeze merely represents one possible
means (and a decidedly flawed one at that) toward
this end. While it may have been useful as a symbol
ot concern, it does not provide the only, or even the
best, road map toward future progress on arms
control. The time has come to put the call for a nu
clear freeze behind us and to demand instead that
our national leaders put forth some meaningful
realistic proposals aimed at reversing the arms
race; proposals which permit selective moderniza
tion where it is needed but which also work to
decrease force levels and increase the chances for
peace.

Much has been said about "national technical

crates aboard Soviet ships bound for Nicaragua.

There are many areas, particularly though not ex

only cover those aspects that are mutually

In the past, the administration has been accused
of trying to undermine the arms control process by
making proposals it knew in advance were unnc-<
ceptable to the Soviets. The president, wViWe ac
knowledging that the Soviets found his earlier offers
less than desirable, has stated that reaching an arms
control agreement is now his No. 1 priority. The
proposals he puts forth in the coming months will
show the world how serious this pledge is or is not.
Meanwhile, freeze proponents, by insisting on a
proposal they know the administration finds unac
ceptable, appear guilty of the same tactic they
accuse the president of following. To them the
freeze has become an all-or-nothing proposition.
They claim that the only alternative to the freeze is
"a continued and escalating arms race and possibly
a nuclear war."
The freeze is not an end in itself. The goal is to
determine how best to reduce the risk of nuclear
war. The freeze merely represents one possible
means (and a decidedly flawed one at that) toward
this end. While it may have been useful as a symbol
ot concern, it does not provide the only, or even the
best, road map toward future progress on arms
control. The time has come to put the call for a nu
clear freeze behind us and to demand instead that
our national leaders put forth some meaningful
realistic proposals aimed at reversing the arms
race; proposals which permit selective moderniza
tion where it is needed but which also work to
decrease force levels and increase the chances for
peace.

The easy part is over! The United States and the
Soviet Union have agreed to resume arms-control
talks. The real challenge for the United States is
now to develop overall objectives and a negotiating
position that can lead to positive results. Many sug
gestions have been put forth from within and
outside the administration. The intent here is not to

add to this list, but rather to subtract one outdated
proposal; namely, the call to adopt "as an immedi
ate strategic arms objective ... a mutual and
verifiable freeze on the testing, production and
future deployment of nuclear warheads, missiles
and other delivery systems."
Freeze proponents claim this proposal still en
joys widespread bipartisan support. The reason for
this is simple but deceptive. As it has evolved, the
freeze has become all things to all people. It has al
most as many definitions as it does advocates. Part
of the problem stems from the proposal's attempt
to serve two purposes. On one hand, it represents a
symbol of international concern over the arms race.
On the other, it proposes a solution to the problem.
To its credit, the movement has served as a rally
ing cry to send American and Soviet leaders a
strong message that the time for progress on arms
control is clearly at hand. Unfortunately, the freeze
proposal does not provide a blueprint for achieving
the safer world that its proponents, and all other
Americans, desire. As is the case with most emo
tional slogans, its flaws become all too apparent
when held up to the light of today's strategic
realities.
A freeze in the testing and deployment of new
delivery systems would leave the United States at a
disadvantage over time, if not immediately. The
overwhelming majority of the Soviet's strategic sys
tems (some 90 percent) are less than 10 years old;

about half of these have been introduced in the last
five years. By contrast, only about 15 percent of
U.S. systems are under 10 years old; the majority
have been in the field for 15 to 20 years or longer.
The age disparity is too great not to recognize. One
can argue that a particular system may be poten
tially destabilizing or otherwise undesirable. But to
rule out all modernization is dangerous and self
defeating. That is why many arms-control advo
cates prefer instead a concept that would reduce
rather than freeze the number of weapons while
still permitting modernization of aging systems.
Freeze advocates share the desire to see the size
of both sides' nuclear arsenals reduced. The catch

is, the United States will only reduce its numbers if
it is confident about the quality and survivability of
those that remain. Security does not derive from
the size of the force per se, but from its ability to
deter war. A smaller but modernized force can pro
vide greater security than a large outmoded one.
