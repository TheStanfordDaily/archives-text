## Everything to lose and save 
### 
Talks to talk about future talks will
produce nothing hut talk. So
describes the Andrei Gromyko-
George Shultz meeting last week. Al
though we all welcome the great
•"thaw" in United States-Soviet rela
tions, we doubt that it will lead to any
significant, positive change in the
arms race. What is required for any
arms control or disarmament attempt
to be taken seriously is a new, practi
cal policy that reduces the risk of
human extinction and satisfies both
superpowers — a pareto optimo
resolution that leaves no one worse
off and some one (the entire species
in fact) better off.
In his book. "The Abolition." Joh
nathan Schell proposes such a practi
cal policy: the mutual agreement for
gradually increasing our nuclear
holocaust "lead time" that would in
clude the "abolition" of nuclear
weapons. The acceptance of this
policy would be dependent on the
U.S. and Soviet leaders' making
human survival a top priority —
something which will. I hope,
become easier as the risk of surviving
becomes greater. However, the
workability of this policy would be
guaranteed by a modified version of
our current mutual assured destruc
tion system of deterrence. Schell's
idea is a practical, safer direction for
arms control and disarmament that
merits and even compels our consid
eration.

Lead time is the amount of time
from any given moment until nuclear
holocaust. Today our lead time is a
frightening seven minutes. It is
frightening because there is virtually
no time for correction of some human
or computer miscalculation or for
reconsideration once decision makers
have sent out that fatal command. It
follows that increasing lead time is
pushing a nuclear nightmare further
away from actually occurring. A lead
time until nuclear holocaust will al
ways exist since nuclear knowledge
will always exist. (E will always equal
mc ; and we could therefore always
repeat the armament history of the
last 40 years). However, we can cer
tainly improve our current lead time
of a scant seven minutes.
The seven minutes could be im
proved to a safer lead time of seven
weeks if there is a mutual abolition of
the actual possession and production
of nuclear weapons. This abolition
would be one of the last steps in a
gradual increase of our lead time. The
first step would be a mutual freeze on
the manufacturing and deployment
(not on research and developement)
of nuclear weapons. This would, per
haps, be followed by a mutual agree
ment to partially dismantle nuclear
weapons within their silos, with on
site verification. And a gradual
percentage reduction in the total
number of nuclear weapons could
ensue. This reduction process is pos

sible because it would occur within
the system of deterrence.
Deterrence, based on a "safety
through-terror" contradiction, will'
only work if a potential aggressor
believes a retaliatory threat is real.
Deterrence was losing its effective
ness in the late 19705; Jimmy Carter
would probably not have retaliated a
full Soviet nuclear attack. However,
President Reagan's administration
put the beef back into deterrence by
not only threatening mutual assured
destruction, but also by hurling the
arms race into space. The Soviets may
now be more effectively deterred by
this addition to the arms race, but our
species is now more effectively en
dangered also. The Soviets would
have been more than sufficiently
deterred had Reagan only threatened
to start an arms race in space, without
actually starting one.
Similar mutual threats of advancing
the arms race would also suffice in
deterring a potential aggressor during
the arms reduction process of increas
ing our nuclear holocaust lead time.
The threats would be given credibility
by continued nuclear weapon re
search and developement; thus ex
plains why the freeze would not cover
R & D It would be like two people
removing some of the many knives
pointed at each other while
simutaneously threatening to point
guns if one person tries "to pull a fast
one."

Once the possession and produc
tion of nuclear weapons were
abolished, deterrence would still
remain in effect; only now a potential
aggressor would be deterred by
threats of increasingly efficient
production plans for nuclear weapons
and delivery systems. The results of
the arms race would be moved from
the silos to the chalkboards. Whereas
today we count nuclear warheads and
plan attack stratagies, under abolition
we would count nuclear plants and
plan production stratagies.
Abolition is admittedly not the ul
timate solution. Despite on-site
verification, cheating could occur; but
the uncertainty of cheaters would in
crease the effectiveness of deter
rence. Additionally, the level of
cheating that could occur would not
threaten human survival as much as it
is threatened today. Abolition would
be an exponential increase in our lead
time and it could be accomplished
within our life time.
This is the challenge of our
generation. Since we are risking the
survival of the species, nothing could
be more collectively important to us
than to confront our nuclear predica
ment. The ideas of "The Aboliton"
compel our consideration. We have
everything to lose and everything to
save.
