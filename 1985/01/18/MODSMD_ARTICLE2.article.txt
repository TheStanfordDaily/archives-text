# Noon rally decries apartheid
## 
### FRANK LESTER Staff writer 
A recent decision by the Commission on Investment
Responsibility to recommend that the University divest
from Motorola Corporation will be only a first step in rid
ding South Africa of "the abomination of apartheid," said
speakers at a noon White Plaza rally yesterday.
The rally was held by a coalition of student groups to
condemn racism and oppression the world over, but spe
cifically in South Africa.
A number of leading campus and community activists
spoke to a crowd of about 100 people at the rally. A
leading theme of the speeches was the precedent-setting
C-1R decision, which was hailed as a step in the right di
rection by many of the speakers.
C-1R voted unanimously Tuesday to recommend
divestment of Stanford's shares of Motorola is the com
pany resumes sales of equipment to the South African
military or police.
The co-authors of a student apartheid referendum that
eventually led to C-lß's decision had words of praise for
the decision but urged the University to take furthei ac
tion.
"Stanford expects its students to observe the highest
ethical and moral standards. Stanford students expect the
board of trustees to abide by exactly these same stand
ards," said co-author Jon Adelstein.
"We'll see to it that they tread with care, not over the
broken and starving bodies of the people of South
Africa," said co-author Mark Landesmann. adding, "We
shouldn't relent until the University shows the responsi
bility to draw the line and set up guidelines saying, as we
have, that certain corporate behavior is unacceptable and

incompatible with our values."
East Palo Alto activist Elenya Bekks said that the
struggle that protest engenders is valuable and must
proceed forward. "Next time you see an article discount
ing the effectiveness of protest, remember that silence is
consent.
"Remember that the blood of South African men,
women and children is on the diamonds and Krugerrands
and other riches that flow into this country. Remember
that through investments in the South African regime, this
country is supplying tanks and planes and riot gear for
Pretoria. Remember that investment makes misery in
Soweto. Remember that we can make a difference."
Dean Robert Hamerton-Kelly of Memorial Church
called for student support for the efforts of Johannes
burg Bishop Desmond Tutu. "We should, if we at
all are concerned about the irrationality of violence, sup
port Tutu. After all. we have the benefit of hindsight now.
We have Gandhi and Martin Luther King to remember
and learn from."
The suggestion to look closer to home for inspiration to
change South African conditions came from Cynthia
Moore, a Black Student Union member who called the
presence of blacks in Stanford classrooms merely a sym
bol of "cosmetic changes in America's social climate.
She said one need only look at the skin color of the grass
cutters, janitors and cooks working at Stanford to see
evidence of racial oppression still at large in the United
States.
Covering up "won't work" here or in South Africa, ac
cording to Moore, "because blacks in South Africa are

tired, they're mad and they're hungry
for freedom."
After the rally, about 40 students
staged a peaceful sit-in in the lobby of
Encina Hall to present a sheaf of peti
tions to William Massy, Stanford's
vice president for business and
finance. The petitions called for
divestment of University funds from
companies involved in perpetuating
apartheid in South Africa. They were
presented to Massy in his capacity as
liaison between the University and
the board of trustees.
Massy accepted the petitions and
promised to do his best to "involve
himself" in recommending the pur
suit of responsible divestment
policies. He said, though, that the

University, as a public trust, could not
espouse political causes, regardless of
the morality of its aim.
"Let me give you an extreme ex
ample, and I mean this as an example,
not an analogue," Massy said to the
demonstrators. "If a trustee, or a vice
president, or a student or a faculty
member believes strongly in a good
cause — let's call it the Boy Scouts or
the Girl Scouts — they have no rights
to University assets to further that
cause, no matter how good it is.
"Likewise, there are strict limits in
law against a public trust lobbying in
the political arena, other than in nar
rowly defined areas that affect us di
rectly.
He called the C-IR decision to rec
ommend divestment a placebo.
"You'll have to wonder whether it's
just a symbolic act that makes no dif
ference other than perhaps make us
feel a little better for a time/'

A recent decision by the Commission on Investment
Responsibility to recommend that the University divest
from Motorola Corporation will be only a first step in rid
ding South Africa of "the abomination of apartheid," said
speakers at a noon White Plaza rally yesterday.
The rally was held by a coalition of student groups to
condemn racism and oppression the world over, but spe
cifically in South Africa.
A number of leading campus and community activists
spoke to a crowd of about 100 people at the rally. A
leading theme of the speeches was the precedent-setting
C-1R decision, which was hailed as a step in the right di
rection by many of the speakers.
C-1R voted unanimously Tuesday to recommend
divestment of Stanford's shares of Motorola is the com
pany resumes sales of equipment to the South African
military or police.
The co-authors of a student apartheid referendum that
eventually led to C-lß's decision had words of praise for
the decision but urged the University to take furthei ac
tion.
"Stanford expects its students to observe the highest
ethical and moral standards. Stanford students expect the
board of trustees to abide by exactly these same stand
ards," said co-author Jon Adelstein.
"We'll see to it that they tread with care, not over the
broken and starving bodies of the people of South
Africa," said co-author Mark Landesmann. adding, "We
shouldn't relent until the University shows the responsi
bility to draw the line and set up guidelines saying, as we
have, that certain corporate behavior is unacceptable and

incompatible with our values."
East Palo Alto activist Elenya Bekks said that the
struggle that protest engenders is valuable and must
proceed forward. "Next time you see an article discount
ing the effectiveness of protest, remember that silence is
consent.
"Remember that the blood of South African men,
women and children is on the diamonds and Krugerrands
and other riches that flow into this country. Remember
that through investments in the South African regime, this
country is supplying tanks and planes and riot gear for
Pretoria. Remember that investment makes misery in
Soweto. Remember that we can make a difference."
Dean Robert Hamerton-Kelly of Memorial Church
called for student support for the efforts of Johannes
burg Bishop Desmond Tutu. "We should, if we at
all are concerned about the irrationality of violence, sup
port Tutu. After all. we have the benefit of hindsight now.
We have Gandhi and Martin Luther King to remember
and learn from."
The suggestion to look closer to home for inspiration to
change South African conditions came from Cynthia
Moore, a Black Student Union member who called the
presence of blacks in Stanford classrooms merely a sym
bol of "cosmetic changes in America's social climate.
She said one need only look at the skin color of the grass
cutters, janitors and cooks working at Stanford to see
evidence of racial oppression still at large in the United
States.
Covering up "won't work" here or in South Africa, ac
cording to Moore, "because blacks in South Africa are

tired, they're mad and they're hungry
for freedom."
After the rally, about 40 students
staged a peaceful sit-in in the lobby of
Encina Hall to present a sheaf of peti
tions to William Massy, Stanford's
vice president for business and
finance. The petitions called for
divestment of University funds from
companies involved in perpetuating
apartheid in South Africa. They were
presented to Massy in his capacity as
liaison between the University and
the board of trustees.
Massy accepted the petitions and
promised to do his best to "involve
himself" in recommending the pur
suit of responsible divestment
policies. He said, though, that the

University, as a public trust, could not
espouse political causes, regardless of
the morality of its aim.
"Let me give you an extreme ex
ample, and I mean this as an example,
not an analogue," Massy said to the
demonstrators. "If a trustee, or a vice
president, or a student or a faculty
member believes strongly in a good
cause — let's call it the Boy Scouts or
the Girl Scouts — they have no rights
to University assets to further that
cause, no matter how good it is.
"Likewise, there are strict limits in
law against a public trust lobbying in
the political arena, other than in nar
rowly defined areas that affect us di
