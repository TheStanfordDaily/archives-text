## Stanford looks for second Pac-10 victory Card to play injured Bears at Cal 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior spores writer 
You almost have to feel sorry tor
University of California at Berkeley
basketball Coach Dick Kuchen. He
recruits top-notch players, they come
to Cal and then they get hurt.
Last year, it was 6-foot-1 l Michael
Pitts. He was supposed to bolster the
Bears' front court. Then he injured
his knee, was out for the season, and
Cal finished ninth in the Pacific 10
Conference with a 5-13 record.
This season, Pitts and his injured
knees were gone, and Kuchen
thought it was finally his year. Sure,
the Bears were a bit thin up front, but
6-9 junior Dave Butler and 6-8 fresh
man sensation Leonard Taylor could
handle the inside play. And besides, a
season-ending injury to a big man
wouldn't happen again.
It did.
Kuchen and his Bears were in the
midst of their best start in recent
years, an 8-1 record, when they
received the bad news. Butler was out
for at least six weeks and probably
the season with not one, but two
stress fractures. One in each leg. just
below the knee.

"He means a great deal to our bas
ketball team," Kuchen said of Butler,
whose brother. Greg, is a freshman
forward at Stanford. "We're a much
better team with him — he was our
leading scorer and second-leading
rebounder when he went out. We also
miss his leadership."
After the 8-1 start, Cal has
dropped five straight games, includ
ing its first four in Pac-lO play. And
after last night's 72-54 drubbing by
the University of Washington, host
Berkeley has to be calling basket
ball's version of the Big Game tomor
row night at 7:30 a must win.
To bring Cal's situation to
nightmarish proportions, 6-1 starting
guard Kevin Johnson suffered a hip
pointer in last Saturday's loss to
Arizona State University when he
collided with Sun Devil forward Jim
Deines, who is 6-10.
Johnson didn't make the trip to
Washington and is listed as question
able for tomorrow's contest. That
leaves the Bears with an expected
starting line-up of a freshman
(Taylor), three sophomores (guard
Chris Washington and lorwards Jim
Beatie and Eddie Jarvis) and a senior

(guard Jeff Thilgen).
Though Kuchen. who is in the final
year of a two-year contract extension,
could easily make excuses for the 0-4
start, he isn't. "We're not pleased
with the tact that we've not won a
conference game yet." he said. "I just
can't be satisfied with not winning."
Stanford Coach Tom Davis prob
ably would be echoing Kuchen's com
ments had the Cardinal not pulled off
a 55-51 upset over the University of
Arizona last Saturday at Maples
Pavilion. Stanford improved to 9-5
overall and 1 -3 in the Pac-10 with the
victory, and now takes its 1-5 road
record on a three-game road trip.
Though there is extra incentive to
beat rival Cal, most of the talk at
Stanford's basketball press confer
ence last Monday centered around
winning a Pac-10 game after opening
conference play with three defeats.
Stanford lost its first six straight last
year before finally winning.
When asked how much of a relief it
was to record Pac-10 victory number
one. Cardinal forward Earl Koberlein
broke out a big smile and said, "A big
relief. We couldn't help but think
about last year and our 0-6 start. We

were starting to lose our confidence.
Howard Charles Hunt, who came
off the bench against Arizona to score
nine points, agreed with Koberlein.
••We just got in the locker room
before the Arizona game and said.
We're going to win." It starts getting
ridiculous when those losses come in
a string like that."
If Stanford is going to do what it did
last year after it won its first Pac-10
i>ame — win six straight — it will have
to shoot better. In the victory over
Arizona, the Cardinal shot 34 percent
from the floor, the worst in the 73
games Davis has coached at Stanford.
And the poor shooting hasn't been
confined to one game. In conference
games. Stanford is shooting 41.3 per
cent, 10th in the Pac-10. This is the
same Stanford that was among the
nation's leaders in field-goal
percentage at times last season.
But in the Bears, Stanford has the
conference's worst defensive team,
statistically speaking. Cal's Pac-10
opponents are shooting 57.5 percent
from the floor and scoring 77.3 points
per game.
Davis said he plans to go with the
same starting lineup that worked so
well against Arizona — John Paye
and Keith Ramee at guard, Andy
Fischer and Earl Koberlein at forward
and Kent Seymour at center.
However, Davis admitted he'll prob
ably substitute more tomorrow than
he did last Saturday since it is not a
televised game, which has more
and longer time-outs.
Although both teams average more
than 70 points a game, no team has
scored more than 66 points in the last
three meetings. The Bears had won
five straight Big Games before the
Cardinal ended that streak with a 62-
51 victory at Cal last year.

Forward Earl Koberlein has been playing with tremendous back pain lately. Despite the pain, Koberlein was
the Cardinal's leading scorer in its last game with 13 points.


Jill Gilbert/Daily
Guard Novian Whitsitt will come off the bench again tonight as sopho
more John Paye keeps the starting spot. Whitsitt is the Cardinal's
leading scorer.
