### ERIK ESELIUS Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford men's and women's fencing teams will
play in a seven-team tournament this weekend hosted
by Northwestern University, which will mark the first
time that a West Coast team will have fenced a Big 10
Conference opponent.
During tournament play, Stanford will meet North
western, Ohio State University, the University of Wis
consin, the University of Illinois and the University of
Minnesota. The University of Chicago will be the only
non-Big 10 team besides Stanford in the tournament.
Cardinal Head Coach Buzz Hurst said that not only
would a strong Stanford performance solidify its
reputation but "it would help the whole Western
Region."
"The East thinks nothing exists on this side past the
Mississippi," Hurst said. "If we do a number out there,
we strengthen our argument that we're legitimate out
here. Stanford has established a reputation for itself,
though."
Hurst felt strongly about the Cardinal men's chances
of winning the tournament, especially since they per
formed so well against Santa Cruz, the fourth-ranked
team in club sports ratings.
"Frankly, I believe we have a good chance on the
men's side to beat all opponents," Hurst said. "It will

be tough against Wisconsin and Illinois. ... I'm very
bullish about our chances."
According to Hurst, "the nucleus of strategy" for the
Cardinal men will revolve around the sabre team,
which Hurst hopes will take some pressure off the foil
and epec teams.
As for the the Cardinal women's team. Hurst felt
that they would have "a tougher go," pointing out the
strength of Ohio State and Northwestern.
"Ohio State is perennially very strong," Hurst said.
"They have a legitimate No. 5 ranking. Northwestern
is just a little weaker."
The Cardinal women will have some special in
centive when they fence Wisconsin. The Badgers
knocked Stanford out of the National Collegiate Ath
letic Association tournament last year, prompting
Hurst to say wryly, "We owe them one."
On Friday, the Cardinal will fence Northwestern,
who boasts the 1 Oth and 13th nationally-ranked men's
and women's teams, followed by the Buckeyes of Ohio
State whose men's and women's teams are ranked 2()th
and 15th, respectively.
The Cardinal will then face Illinois, ranked seventh
in men's play, Minnesota, Wisconsin, ranked 1 Oth in
the men s division and 14th in the women's division,
and finally Chicago.
