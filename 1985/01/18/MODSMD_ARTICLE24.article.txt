# Card evens WCAA record
## Women down Arizona 
### JOHN LIS Staff sportswriter 
After spending all week working
on offensive fundamentals, the Stan
ford women's basketball team relied
on a solid defensive effort to defeat
the University of Arizona, 63-52, last
night at Maples Pavilion.
The victory evened Stanford's
record at 1-1 in the Western Col
legiate Athletic Association and put it
at 6-8 overall. The six victories
exceeds last season's total, when the
Cardinal was 5-23.
"It was a great win for us," Head
Coach Dotty McCrea said.
"We just put everything together
and played well," forward Mary
Bradach said.
Guard Virginia Sourlis said, "The
personnel we had on the floor did
great. (Freshman guard) Charli
Turner did a great job. We moved the
ball better tonight."
On defense Stanford switched be
tween a 3-2 zone and a man-to-man
to shut down the Wildcats. Arizona
shot only 28 percent in the first half
and 42 percent for the game. The 52-
point total is deceiving — with four
minutes to go Arizona trailed 46-36,
and then the two team traded baskets
down the stretch.
"With the 3-2, if they don't put
someone in the corners, we can cover
the wings," McCrea said, explaining
the effectiveness of the zone.
On offense the Cardinal went up
against a 2-3 zone after having had
problems with man-to-man defenses

earlier in the year. The zone allowed
Stanford's outside shooters to get
their shots off without pressure, and
they took advantage of it. Sourlis
scored 20 points to lead the Cardinal,
and forward Kami Anderson added
13 from the wing.
"I'd prefer to play against a zone, if
I had a choice," Sourlis said. "In a
man-to-man you always have to work
hard to get open, there's always
someone in your face. In a zone
there's not always someone there."
Bradach said, "They were in a 2-3
zone and sagged into the post. Our
outside shooters were really on.
When they got out of it (the 2-3), we
were able to get it inside."' Bradach
finished with 13 points and had eight
rebounds to lead thv. Cardinal.
"We worked a lot on pivoting and
passing," she continued. "It helped us
cut down on turnovers and in getting
the ball into people."
Stanford was also helped by the
fact the officials were calling a close
game. Arizona is a much more physi
cal team than Stanford, and was
called for 28 fouls. Three Wildcats
fouled out, and two others finished
with four fouls. Stanford capitalized
by hitting 25 of 30 free throws for 83
percent.
McCrea went with her starters
most of the game. All played more
than 30 minutes, and they scored 58
of the 63 points.
"We basically got to a point where
people were working well together,"
McCrea explained. "They weren't

tired. We had a good combination out
there. You get a gut feeling about
these things."
Sourlis said, "There was a flow out
there tonight. We were doing well. I
felt good — I didn't feel exhausted."
Arizona guard Kirsten Smith
scored 21 points to lead all scorers.
With the loss the Wildcats fell to 0-2
in the WCAA, 5-9 overall.
Card notes
Last season, the only conference
victory for the Cardinal came at
Maples Pavilion against Arizona. 60-

57. The Wildcats' onlv WCAA triumph
was a 58-49 decision over Stanford in
Tucson.
With her 2()-point effort yesterday.
Sourlis went over the 900-point mark
in career scoring. The senior guard
now has scored 910 points in two
t d-a-half seasons.
At halftime the women's golf team
defeated the women's tennis team in
a challenge basketball game. Tennis
Head Coach Frank Brennan refused
to release the final score. "We're
going to have to recruit some two
sport athletes," Brennan said.

night at Maples Pavilion.
The victory evened Stanford's
record at 1-1 in the Western Col
legiate Athletic Association and put it
at 6-8 overall. The six victories
exceeds last season's total, when the
Cardinal was 5-23.
"It was a great win for us," Head
Coach Dotty McCrea said.
"We just put everything together
and played well," forward Mary
Bradach said.
Guard Virginia Sourlis said, "The
personnel we had on the floor did
great. (Freshman guard) Charli
Turner did a great job. We moved the
ball better tonight."
On defense Stanford switched be
tween a 3-2 zone and a man-to-man
to shut down the Wildcats. Arizona
shot only 28 percent in the first half
and 42 percent for the game. The 52-
point total is deceiving — with four
minutes to go Arizona trailed 46-36,
and then the two team traded baskets
down the stretch.
"With the 3-2, if they don't put
someone in the corners, we can cover
the wings," McCrea said, explaining
the effectiveness of the zone.
On offense the Cardinal went up
against a 2-3 zone after having had
problems with man-to-man defenses

earlier in the year. The zone allowed
Stanford's outside shooters to get
their shots off without pressure, and
they took advantage of it. Sourlis
scored 20 points to lead the Cardinal,
and forward Kami Anderson added
13 from the wing.
"I'd prefer to play against a zone, if
I had a choice," Sourlis said. "In a
man-to-man you always have to work
hard to get open, there's always
someone in your face. In a zone
there's not always someone there."
Bradach said, "They were in a 2-3
zone and sagged into the post. Our
outside shooters were really on.
When they got out of it (the 2-3), we
were able to get it inside."' Bradach
finished with 13 points and had eight
rebounds to lead thv. Cardinal.
"We worked a lot on pivoting and
passing," she continued. "It helped us
cut down on turnovers and in getting
the ball into people."
Stanford was also helped by the
fact the officials were calling a close
game. Arizona is a much more physi
cal team than Stanford, and was
called for 28 fouls. Three Wildcats
fouled out, and two others finished
with four fouls. Stanford capitalized
by hitting 25 of 30 free throws for 83
percent.
McCrea went with her starters
most of the game. All played more
than 30 minutes, and they scored 58
of the 63 points.
"We basically got to a point where
people were working well together,"
McCrea explained. "They weren't

tired. We had a good combination out
there. You get a gut feeling about
these things."
Sourlis said, "There was a flow out
there tonight. We were doing well. I
felt good — I didn't feel exhausted."
Arizona guard Kirsten Smith
scored 21 points to lead all scorers.
With the loss the Wildcats fell to 0-2
in the WCAA, 5-9 overall.

At halftime the women's golf team
defeated the women's tennis team in
a challenge basketball game. Tennis

going to have to recruit some two
sport athletes," Brennan said.
