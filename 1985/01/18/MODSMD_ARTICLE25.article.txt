## 
### JOHN LIS Staff sportswriter 
■ After last night's 63-52 victory over the Univer
sity of Arizona, the Stanford women's basketball
team will try to put together back-to-back confer
ence triumphs Monday night when Arizona State
University comes to Maples Pavilion.
I
! Stanford hasn't won two in a row in the Western
Collegiate Athletic Association since February
1983, when it defeated Cal State Fullerton and San
Diego State University in the same week.
The Sun Devils will be a more difficult challenge
than Arizona was. ASU is 7-6 this season atter a
7S-65 loss to San Diego State in its conference

opener. Arizona State plays tomorrow in Berkeley
against the University of California.
Among their seven wins, the Sun Devils count a
76-75 triumph over No. 14-ranked Rutgers Uni
versity. That is the same Rutgers team that crushed
Stanford, K2-53, in the consolation game of the
Buckeye Classic in Columbus, Ohio.
"They've been an up-and-down team all year,"
Stanford Head Coach Dotty McCrea said.
"They're a team we can beat at home. Sure, they
beat Rutgers, but in their next game they lost to St.
Peter's, 104-62. They've had some up and some
down games."
Forward Mary Bradach said, "I think Arizona

State would be a good win for us. They're a little
tougher than Arizona, though. . . .
"If we can maintain the intensity on defense, and
the offense comes around, we can win "
The Sun Devils' leading scorer is 5-foot-7 junior
guard Jodi Rathhun, who is averaging 16 points per
game. Sherry Poole, a 6-0-sophomore forward, is
next at 12.3 ppg.
After Monday's game, the Cardinal has a pair of
non-conference games. Stanford will be in Stock
ton Wednesday to face the University of the Pacific
and in Moraga a week from today for a game with
St. Mary's College. The Cardinal's next WCAA
game is Feb. 1 at UCLA. Stanford returns to
Maples Feb. 9 to face San Diego State.
