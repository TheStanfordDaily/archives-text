# Home is super place for McColl
## 
### JOHN LIS Staff sportswriter 
San Francisco 49ers linebacker Milt McColl didn't ex
pect to walk onto the field at Stanford Stadium in uniform
ever again after he finished his Stanford career in 1980. " I
never thought I'd play there again," McColl said at an in
formal news conference yesterday."I could see my kids
playing there, not myself."
Come Sunday, though. McColl will again take to the
field that he called home during fou. >ears on the Farm
when the 49ers face the Miami Dolphins in Super Bowl
XIX here.
"I'm excited about it."he said. "It's been a long time
since I've played at Stanford."
More than four years, in fact. A two-time Academic
All-American. McColl was named second team All-
Pacific 10 and was an honorable mention All-America
choice by The Sporting News in his senior year at Stan
ford .
In spite of these honors, McColl wasn't drafted after his
senior season. "After not getting drafted, I had to decide
whether I'd try out somewhere," he said. "I knew the
odds were long, but I figured I'd give it a shot and go to
med school if I didn't make it."
McColl received calls from three or four teams inter
ested in having him try out. Having gone to school in the
Bay Area, San Francisco was a logical cnoice. He didn't
look at the other Bay Area team because "Oakland didn't
come after me hard. The Niners did."
There was also another factor — 49ers Head Coach Bill
Walsh, under whom McColl had played his first two years
at Stanford.
"I'd played with Walsh and some of the other (49er)
coaches at Stanford, so they knew who I was," he said. "I
had an advantage because they knew what I could do."
In his rookie season McColl found himself playing in
Super Bowl XVI against the Cincinnati Bengals in
Detroit. In that game McColl recovered a fumble on a
kickoff that set up a Ray Wersching field goal at the end
of the first half. The 49ers won 26-21.
"As a rookie I kind of got caught up in everything," he
said. "That really was exciting to me because after not
being drafted, I didn't think I'd even be playing in the
NFL. Then we start winning, and we get to the Super
Howl, and it was like a domino effect, a dream-like situa
tion.
"This is my fourth season now. I play more, and now
being in the Super Bowl doesn't quite have the halo effect.

I'm trying to prepare for this game as if it were any other,
keeping a low profile and just trying to play as well as I
can."
In his four years with San Francisco. McColl has played
mostly in a backup role and on special teams. This year he
had 32 tackles and four sacks during the regular season
and si\ tackles and one sack in playoff victories over the
New York Giants and Chicago Bears.
Although Sunday will be the first time McColl plays in
Stanford Stadium since he graduated, it's not as if he
hasn't been on campus lately. A human biology major as
an undergraduate. McColl takes classes at the Stanford
Medical School in the off-season.
"I'm around there a lot. so it's familiar ground," he
said. "Playing in front of a packed stadium will be a spe
cial feeling."
McColl currently lives in Menlo Park "about a half
block off campus." He was raised in Covina, in Southern
California, and grew up a Los Angeles Rams fan "back
when they had Roman Gabriel and Merlin Olsen."
His family, though, was thoroughly Stanford. His par
ents both graduated from here, as did his brother, Dun
can. His father. Bill, played here and was an All-America
end in 1950 and '51, while Duncan was an All-America
defensive end in 1976. Bill played eight years with the
Bears, and Duncan had a brief stint with the Washington
Redskins.
"My dad never was on a championship team," McColl
said. "He's even more excited than I am. And then to play
in one in your home territory — it's very exciting. ... I'm
more excited about the game than whefe it's being
played."
McColl is the only San Francisco player who played un
der Walsh in college. He contrasted the roles Walsh has
had to play at Stanford and with the 49ers.
"College is a little different because the coaches have to
recruit," he said. "In the pros it's just your job. You can
be more professional. There's not as much interest in you
as an individual because you don't have to help recruit the
next class. In the professional ranks a coach can devote
himself to coaching."
That's what Walsh plans to do. Earlier this week he
said, "It'll be great if we win and walking out of the
stadium 1 can take a look around at the campus, but
before that there's no room for sentamentality."
And as for McColl?
"It'll be great to win one more in Stanford Stadium," he
said.

Former Cardinal and current 49er Milt McColl no longer wears number 80 (he's 53 now) but the turf at
Stanford Stadium will be familiar to him when he takes the field on Sunday.
