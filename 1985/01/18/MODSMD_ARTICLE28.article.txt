# Rough road ahead for wrestling team
## 
### PETER CASTILLO Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford wrestling team has
a tough weekend ahead as it faces
Southern Oregon University and
San Francisco State Univerity in
San Francisco today, and then
travels to Cal Poly San Luis
Obispo tomorrow to compete
against one of the strongest West
ern schools.
"All three meets are going to be
close like the Oregon meet. We
have been competitive with all our
opponents this season, and to
come out on top we need to win
the close matches since we are not
dominating in all the weight
classes," Stanford Coach Chris
Horpel said.
The Cardinal wrestling squad
has won four dual meets and suf
fered only one defeat, against
Oregon State University, 20-18.
The team has made steady prog
ress throughout the season and
this weekend will be i hard test for
the athletes' conditioning and a
good indicator of their progress.
The team will be without the
services of heavyweight Frank
Lyles. Lyles does not have
mononucleosis as feared, but is
still too sick to compete. Kurt Kas
sulke, who usually wrestles at 190
pounds, will wrestle at
heavyweight, but Horpel may for

feit that match if the team victory
is locked up. If Kassulke wrestles
at heavyweight, Terry Mclntyre
will compete at 190 pounds.
Jeff Hazard (142 pounds) also
will not compete due to an illness
and a continuing problem of
making his weight. Mark Alex will
fill in for Hazard. Hazard may
switch with Scott Wiggen at 150
pounds if he feels that he cannot
compete at 142 pounds.
Dave Lee (167 pounds) will he
put to the test today as both his
opponents are stars of their
respective teams. Lee has the most
victories on the team with a 19-6
record. One of the victories was a
one point defeat of his Cal-Poly
SLO competitor.
Wiggen, 16-11, suffered a slight
shoulder separation in practice
this week competing against Hor
pel, but should be OK. He lost
earlier in the season to his Cal-
Poly SLO opponent. At 177
pounds, Tom Mullen, 14-7, will
face the best wrestler on the West
coast at this weight against South
ern Oregon.
Jeff Bradley (134 pounds) will
have a tough match on Saturday as
he looks to improve his 16-6-1
record. Pete Rogers (158 pounds),
11-10-1, beat his San Francisco
State opponent by a point earlier
in the season.
