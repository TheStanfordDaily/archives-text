### INGRID SEYER Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford men's swimming team will attempt
to "get the ball rolling", this weekend as it travels
with the women's team to Arizona to play Arizona
State University and the University of Arizona this
weekend.
Both teams will be competing against ASU today
at 1 p.m. and Arizona tomorrow at the same time.
"Both of these meets are important to us because
they are conference meets," men's Swimming
Coach Skip Kenney said. " We will be trying to start
the ball rolling toward the NCAAs (National Col
legiate Athletic Association Championships)."
Kenney feels Arizona State will present the tough
est competition for the men's team this weekend.

"Arizona State is a pretty strong team this year and
should be in the top five of this year's NCAAs," he
said. "It has a very strong freestyle squad, led by
Mike Orn, who won the NCAA 200-yard freestyle
two years ago."
Although Kenney does not feel Arizona will be
as strong as Arizona State, he feels it has one of its
best teams in the last 10 years. The key events in
the Arizona meet should be the face-off between
Cardinal Olympian Jeff Kostoff and Arizona's
George DiCarlo in the 1,000- and 500-yard
freestyle events. DiCarlo was an Olympic gold
medalist in the 400-meter freestyle in 1984 and
won the 500-yard freestyle in last years NCAA
Championships.
Women's Swimming Coach George Haines also
feels Arizona State will be the toughest competi

tion of the weekend. "Arizona State is 100 percent
better than it was last year and should prove to he a
very strong contender." he said. "It is really going
to present a big test for us."
Arizona State is expected to be strong in the
breaststroke events, led by Terry Baxter. Baxter
placed third in the 100- and 200-meter
breaststroke events in the 1954 Olympic trials.
ASU also has a very strong butterfly squad and
medley relay team.
Although Arizona has some good individual
competitors. Haines does not expect it to be as
strong on Saturday as Arizona State.
"We won't be taking Arizona lightly, but they
probably won t be as fast overall at our competition
on Friday." Haines said.
