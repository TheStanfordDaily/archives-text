# Panel cites alcohol use

### BRYAN WALSER Staff writer 
Stanford's fraternities have acted
irresponsibly when dealing with alco
hol recently, Stanford Police Chief
Marvin Herrington said last night.
"prats this year have been headed
down a road that may be difficult for
them. They must either clean up or
ride into the sunset," Herrington said
in a panel discussion hosted by Resi
dential Education.
In the presentation, titled "R.A.
and R.F. Responsibility for and
Liability Under the University's Al
cohol Policy," Herrington joined
Norm Robinson, associate dean of
Student Affairs, and Jasper Williams,
associate staff counsel for the Univer
sity Legal Office, in discussing alco
hol problems on campus, ranging
from underage drinking to the extent
of potential legal liability for serving
alcohol at a large party.
Williams explained the current
state of California civil liability in al
cohol cases by pointing out that

courts have recently held that an indi
vidual injured while intoxicated is re
sponsible for that injury because he
allowed himself to become drunk in
the first place.
Even in a recent case where a
licensed vendor of alcohol sold to a
minor and the minor was subse
quently injured, the court held that
the vendor was not legally liable for
the injury. This is not to say that there
are no legal penalties in California for
alcohol servers: Rather, serving alco
hol to someone under 21 or to some
one visibly intoxicated is a mis
demeanor.
Robinson emphasized that the Res
Ed system is not rule-oriented, but
instead "tries to give enough infor
mation to enable students to make a
wise decision."
Robinson said drinking was a prob
lem on campus, and noted that Res
Ed had spent a great deal of money
on alcohol education in recent years,
said Robinson, "I feel that students
ought to learn to take responsibility

(for drinking), and take the conse
quences of their choices."
In response to questions about ap
parent disregard of underage drink
ing on campus, Herrington defended
the police department's policies by
citing the huge numbers involved.
Herrington said some minors have
been arrested for drinking on
campus, but said the major problem
here is area high school students who
come to Stanford's fraternity parties
to drink.
Finally, Herrington noted that
campus-wide alcohol consumption
has risen steadily for the last four or
five years. "Having beer companies
driving in a truck is quite different
from a couple of students chipping in
for a keg. We've definitely got a
problem." While acknowledging that
fraternites have played a role in the
growth of campus alcohol consump
tion, both Herrington and Robinson
applauded the new Interfraternity
Council alcohol guidelines as a
"positive step."
