## Climber gives unique view of U.S.-Soviet relations 
### PATRICK LIN 
While the United States and the
Soviet Union have recently garnered
massive press attention by renewing
arms talks in Geneva, a former mem
ber of the Stanford Alpine Club has
been quietly working toward peace
through a different channel — rock
climbing.
Michael Wharburton. environmen
talist. photojournalist and expert
rock-climber, gave a slide show yes
terda) at the Bechtel International
Center entitled. "Roped to a Rus
sian: Building Trust on Mountain
Walls."
Wharburton's presentation has
been shown at a number of places
worldwide, and is part of a personal
campaign to promote trust and
friendship between the people of the
United States and the Soviet Union.
During the past 10 years, Whar
burton has been actively involved in
an exchange program between the
American Alpine Club and the Rus
sian Mountaineering Federation. The
program has sponsored joint climbing
expeditions in the United States and
the Soviet Union.
Wharburton's adventures with
Soviets have enabled him to
develop some personal friendships,
and as a result he has gained a unique
perspective on U.S.-Soviet relations.

As he sees it.the Soviets and the
Americans are like two climbers
strung out on the face of a mountain.
"In extreme rock-climbing . . . you
must trust another person with your
life." Wharburton said as he tried to
re-create the feeling of being alone
on a mountain wall, hanging only by a
rope tied tit a Soviet above him. He
said the feeling was scar\ at times but
also very exhilirating — especially
when he and the Soviets, speaking
no common language, could work
pertectK together to achieve a com
mon goal.
Sergei Bershov. the Soviet speed
climbing champion, became a partic
ularly good friend of Wharburton.
Bersho\ spoke only two English
words — "Santa C laus and
"Superman" — when he first met
Wharburton. And yet they immedi
ately developed a close bond. Whar
burton attributed this to the tact that
during rock climbing, one tends to
meet people as they are. The sport is
so physically demanding that one has
little energy left over to make
pretenses. The Soviets that Whar
burton got to know — even Anatoly
the KGB agent — were warm,
friendly and generous, he said.
On one occasion, Wharburton
