## Nature enthusiasts flock to Monterey Bay 
### CATHY JANUS 
With the recent opening of the
Monterey Bay Aquarium, the towns
of Pacific Grove and Monterey have
yet another attraction to offer locals
and tourists. Especially on weekends
and holidays, the crowds are enor
mous. People line up for blocks,
waiting patiently to inspect the mar
vels of bay area marine life pre
sented with spectacular explanations
and exhibits.
The recent weather has been ideal
for visiting the area. In addition to the
aquarium, Monterey County is fa
mous for Cannery Row, Fisherman's
Wharf, Stanford's Hopkins Marine
Station, beautiful golf courses and the
coastal shorelines. The myriad of nat
ural and man-made experiences
awaiting visitors is a wonder to be
hold.
Passing Fort Ord as one drives
toward Monterey and Carmel
beyond, the scenery changes from
rolling dunes of sand and the blue bay
to lush green forests surrounding the
ocean. To reach Pacific Grove and
Monterey, an ideal route is Highway
68, which winds down to the ocean
and follows the coastline to Ocean
View Boulevard. Once you reach the
coastline you will be drawn to the
crashing waves and gulls and seals
sunning on the rocks. Parking along
the road is an option, but it becomes
somewhat of a problem on sunny af

ternoons when picnickers and hikers
all head for the beaches. However,
once you find parking, everything is
within walking distance, so you won't
have to search anymore.
If you haven't visited the area pre
viously, you may want to drive down
Highway 17 before going to the
Aquarium and Cannery Row. Fa
mous around the world, the highway
winds through the forests and offers
breathtaking views of the coastline,
occasional glimpses of deer and other
wildlife, some of the most beautiful
golf courses in the world and both
contemporary and historic architec
tural masterpieces nestled in the hills
and along the coast.
Back at Ocean View Boulevard,
there are a number of things to do.
Cannery Row is crowded with a vari
ety of malls offering a range of
goods, including antiques, clothing,
hand-carved furniture and art work,
and a number of restaurants and
delis. There are also a couple of wine
tasting rooms offering samples of
wines produced in Monterey. And if
you want more than a sip, you can
buy a bottle and then stop by the
bakery for some fresh bread and a
deli for the other makings of a picnic.
Then take the path back through
town and continue along it as it edges
the coast. Numerous benches and
even a park with picnic tables provide

the perfect setting for a picnic.
As darkness descends on the town,
the streets empty quickly as the
weather turns crisp and cold. Once
the shops and other attractions close,
there is little to do except perhaps go
out to dinner and a movie. However,
the variety of restaurants are such
that one can make an evening of
simply choosing which one to try.
Having spent the day appreciating the
marine life of the bay area, it seems
only appropriate to select a restau
rant serving fresh seafood, and what
better one than the Whaling Station
Inn Restaurant? Located one block
above Ocean View Boulevard at 763
Wave Street, this cozy timbered inn is
a perfect choice.
Upon entering the dimly lit restau
rant through the bar area, the maitre
d' exclaimed his delight at an addi
tional two guests. Though we arrived
at 7 p.m., the restaurant did not fill up
until 9 and we were informed that the
busy season begins in February.
However, it was also a Sunday even
ing, and reservations are recom
mended on Friday and Saturdays.
The number to call is (408) 373-
3778.
In the middle of our table sat a
Castroville artichoke with a special
mayonnaise vinaigrette sauce. This
delicious appetizer accompanies all
meals and was a special treat. Also in

eluded with dinners are daily made
soups, local fresh seasonal vegetables,
salads and bread and butter. Wines
are served by the bottle, half bottle
and glass.
Evening specials are featured in
addition to the regular menu. That
evening the fresh fish included sal
mon, kahala and swordfish barbecued
over mesquite charcoal. Fresh
abalone was also on the menu that
evening and was in competition with
live Maine lobster as the most ex
pensive item on the menu at $24.95.
The waiter was enthusiastic about
both of these entrees, and judging by
the number of customers wearing
bibs with lobsters decorating them,
the lobster certainly seemed a
popular selection.
The specialty soup of the house is a
spicy chicken curry with sprinkles of

coconut on top. The other choice was
conventional chicken soup — a good
choice if one doesn't like curry. The
waiter took our order and informed
us that salads would be served follow
ing the entrees. In addition to fresh
fish and seafood, pasta, lamb, venison
and steaks are also prepared.
We ordered the abalone and
lobster; our mouths fell open when
the waiter presented the lobster. It
was a bright red, enormous being —
extremely tender and succulent. The
abalone paled in comparison, al
though it was also delicious. Both
were surrounded by fresh spinach,
cauliflower and carrots.
The waiter returned twice with
clean plates to collect the body of the
lobster. After the entree a salad or
dessert hardly seemed necessary. The

salads, we were told, are not the ordi
nary greens. This evening's choice
was a spinach salad with sesame
dressing or a Chinese cabbage salad.
Dinner was not over yet, however.
The waiter returned to our table with
the dessert tray, which displayed an
assortment of cheese cakes, a custard
eclair. Bavarian pudding, white
chocolate mousse, a rum chocolate
truffle or cannoli. All desserts,
prepared fresh daily, cost $3.50. The
selection and preparation of the
meals, as well as the attentive and
friendly service, are flawless at the
Whaling Station Inn. An evening
spent at this restaurant is a perfect
way to end an enjoyable day explor
ing Monterey.
