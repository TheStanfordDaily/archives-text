# Green Gables Inn: tops in taste and comfort
## 
### CATHY JANUS 
Driving along the coast in Pacific
Grove, you uill assuredly notice a
number of old mansions which have
been renovated and reopened as
bed-and-breakfast inns. One of these
iv the Green Gables Inn. located on
the corner ot Ocean View Boulevard
,md Fifth Street. If you plan to stay
the weekend in Monterey, this cozy,
exquisitely decorated inn is ideal. Not
only is it more personable and com
fortable than a hotel in the area, the
cost is more reasonable.
112 he Green Gables is directly across
the street from the bay and offers a
magnificent view of the water and
shoreline from its cut
glass windows. The shoreline trail for
longing or strolling to the newly
opened Monterey Bay Aquarium or
shops on Cannery Row is only a few
yards outside the door.
In the afternoon, guests gather in

the parlor or the dining room to drink
hot eider, wine or sherry provided by
the host and hostess. A cheery fire is
lit in the fireplace and people wander
around admiring the lovely collection
of antique furnishings and stuffed
hears which can be purchased. For
those desiring a bite to eat before
going out to dinner, an assortment of
fresh fruits, cheeses and crackers and
home-made pastries are served. One
is reminded that Castroville, famous
for artichokes, is only a short distance
away when the hostess brings in deli
cious artichoke hors d'oeuvres.
The guest accommodations include
five upstairs bedrooms, each dis
tinctly different, and one two-room
suite downstairs. Outside is the car
riage house, where an additional four
bedrooms with fireplaces and private
baths are located. All of the rooms
are tastefully decorated in soft colors.

That special thought is paid to each
guest's comfort is obvious by the little
touches found throughout the room:
Special soaps and bubble baths,
flowers and fresh fruit, stationery and
magazines are all provided.
At 8 p.m. the beds are turned down
and a little poem and chocolates are
placed on the pillows. The next morn
ing breakfast is served in the dining
room, which has a panoramic view of
the bay.
The facade of Green Gables is as
exquisite as the interior. Built in
1888. this Queen Anne-style man
sion is half-timbered, and the gables
seem to reach to the sky. For more in
formation on the inn or to make
reservations, call (408) 375-2095.

Even in winter, the gardens at Green Cables Inn and the grassy lawns next to the coastline display a variety
of colorful wildflowers and lush greenery.
