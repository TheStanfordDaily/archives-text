### 
Broadway Melody of 1938 (1938)
Castro, San Francisco
In the heyday of the musical film,
when Busby Berkeley worked for
Warner Brothers, Astaire and Rogers
for R-K-O, and Bing Crosby for
Paramount, M-G-M had a box-office
success with the "Broadway Melody"
series — one in 1936, another in 1938,
and the last in 1940. (The title was a
tribute to M-G-M's 1929 Oscar winner
"Broadway Melody," the first of the
backstage musicals.) The 1938 edition is
the most famous, because it featured 16-
year-old Judy Garland, just one year
before "The Wizard of Oz," singing the
irresistible "Dear Mr. Gable (You Made
Me Love You)." She plays Sophie
Tucker's daughter — the mind boggles
— a talented teenager who auditions for
the biggest producer on Broadway
(Robert Taylor). So does just about
everyone else in the movie: Eleanor
Powell, George Murphy, Buddy Ebsen,
etc. The script (Jack McGowan and Sid
Silvers) is second-rate, the direction
(Roy Del Ruth) a little flat, and you may
cringe every time Eleanor Powell
crinkles up her nose in an effort to act
cute. But Tucker reprises her trademark
song, "Some of These Days," Garland
leads the big "Everybody Sing" number
in Taylor's office, and that lanky, folksy
comic dancer Buddy Ebsen is always a
delight. The songs by Arthur Freed and
Nacio Herb Brown include "Follow in
My Footsteps," "Yours and Mine,"
"Feelin' Like a Million"and "Your
Broadway Is My Broadway."
Plays today with "Naughty Marietta."
Stripes (1981)
Memorial Auditorium
Bill Murray joins the army. Not a
good movie, God knows, but a fairly
consistently funny one, though the
screenwriters (Dan Goldberg, Len Blum
and Murray's co-star, Harold Ramis)
fwould have been smarter to leave Mur
ray and the boys at home in the United
States — once they get to Europe, the
plot goes haywire and the script runs out
of comic invention. Bill Murray is price
less, as usual, and John Candy gives him
able support. Also-starring the late War
ren Oates; directed by Ivan Reitman,
who made Murray's first picture,.
"Meatballs."
Plays Sunday evening at 9:30.
Dodes-ka'den (1970)
Cubberley Auditorium
Akira Kurosawa set this serene, lyrical
film among the poor in an unnamed city:
Paralyzed or muted by their own fear

and hardships, they are reminiscent of
the pipe dreamers in O'Neill's "The
Iceman Cometh," but the delicate
melancholy with which he portrays them
suggests Hans Christian Andersen, and
so do the fairy-tale, finger-painted art
direction and The
dramatis personae includes a cuckold
who plays father to all his whore-wife's
kids, a girl who constructs paper flowers
until she collapses from exhaustion, a
thief, an old sage, and — most
memorably — a dreamer and his beggar
son, who live in the carcass of an ancient
abandoned car. Beautifully acted and di
rected. / ' j. V
Plays Tuesday evening at 8.
After the Thin Man (1936)
Kresge Auditorium ,
Frances Goodrich and Albert Hack
ctt, the authors of the original "Thin Man"
script, worked oh this sequel, too, but
it's rather heavy-handed and it seems

awfully long. The colorful cast includes
Elissa Landi, displaying her 1920s
drawing-room melodrama style; Jessie
Ralph as a tyrannical matriarch; Joseph
Calleia as a beady-eyed gangster; Alan
Marshall as an alcoholic; Teddy Hart as
a lawyer; Sam Levene as a cop; and
Jimmy Stewart, giving arguably his worst
performance (at least until Hitchcock's
"Rope"). Nick and Nora Charles, the
highball-slinging sleuths, are played
once again by William Powell and
Myrna Loy, and Asia's still around, too,
trying to keep a new dog in town away
from his canine wife. Directed by
W.S.Van Dyke.
Plays tonight at 9.
Strangers on a Train (1951)
Cedar, San Francisco
Alfred Hitchcock's movie has a tan
talizingly clever premise: on a train, Guy
(Farley Granger) meets Bruno (Robert
Walker), who promises to eliminate

Guy's troublesome wife if, in return,
Guy will kill Bruno's father. (Bruno calls
this strategy "criss-cross murders.")
Working from Patricia Highsmith's
novel. Raymond Chandler and Czenzi
Ormonde provided Hitchcock with a
witty, beautifully calculated screenplay,
and Robert Walker's malignantly
charming Bruno is among the two or
three best performances Hitchcock ever
directed. It's a marvelous movie, as
sembled with true mastery. Hitchcock
puts the two most suspenseful sequences
back to back: the tennis match and the
merry-go-round clim'ax. With Ruth
Roman, Leo G. Carroll. Patricia
Hitchcock, Marion Lome. Howard St.
John and Laura Elliott.
Plays today and tomorrow with Orson
Welles' "The Stranger."
The Wild Child (1970)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
A triumph of humanistic filmmaking.

In this tender, impassioned film, Fran
cois Truffaut returned to the world of
childhood, which he had last visited in
"The 400 Blows ": The screenplay by
Truffaut and Jean Gruault is based on an
account by Dr. Jean Jtard of a boy dis
covered in the forest of Aveyron. France
in 1798 — a boy of about 12 years who
had grown up among the beasts of the
forest and whose behavior bore little
resemblance to that of other human*,
hard attempted to educate the boy and
to determine whether his conduct was
the result of brain damage or just of en
vironmental influences. The character of
Itard (played by Truffaut himself), who
attempts with infinite patience to bridge
the gap between Victor and the civilized
world of the end of the 18th century,
suggests the humanitarians in Dickens'
novels who rescue mistreated youngsters
(Brownlow in "Oliver Twist," for exam
ple).
Plays Wednesday and Thursday with
"The Last Metro."

Private Lives (1931)
Castro, San Francisco
Sidney Franklin, normally a heavy
handed director M-G-M hauled out for
its most expensive properties — and
nothing was ever heavier than an M-G-
M prestige picture — did a surprisingly
good job putting Noel Coward's play on
screen (with an adaptation by Hans
Kraly and Richard Schayer). Even more
surprising is Norma Shearer's perfor
mance as Amanda: She's no Maggie
Smith, but she's not bad at all. and
Robert Montgomery is excellent as
Elyot. Their respective spouses are
played by Reginald Denny and Una
Me'rkel.
Plays tomorrow with "Dinner at
Eight."
The Pirate (1948)
Castro, San Francisco
This Vincente Minnelli musical is low
on invention (even the Cole Porter score
totters; he must have expended all his
energy that year on his Broadway hit.
"Kiss Me. Kate") yet high-spirited and
amiable. The source is a play by S.N.
Behrman about the romance of a young
woman in the Caribbean and an actor
who plays the role of the pirate she fan
tasizes about. Mack the Black. Luckily.
Judy Garland and Gene Kelly are the
principals, and though the supporting
cast (Walter Slezak. Reginald Owen.
Gladys Cooper) is a bit stiff, the amazing
athletic dancers, the Nicholas Brothers,
make an appearance. The hit song (and
best number). "Be a Clown." bear a
strong thematic and musical
resemblance to the great "Make Em
Laugh" number in "Singin' in the Rain"
(which came four years later).
Plays Sunday with "Singin' in the
Rain."
The Last Metro (1981) .
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Francois Truffaut and his co-writer
Suzanne Schiffman have chosen a
fabulous setting — the theater world in
Paris during the Occupation — but they
stay determinedly on the surface. The
tone of the film, with its roster of social
atrocities perpetrated during the reign of
the Nazis, is amused, lightly wry; this
movie seems to be telling us that it
would be a mistake to take all of this po
litical intrigue too seriously. "The Last
Metro" is a pleasant, polished diversion,
full of talented actors, but it isn't really
about anything.
Plays Wednesday and Thursday with
"The Wild Child."

nothing was ever heavier than an M-G-

Broadway Melody of 1938 (1938)
Castro, San Francisco
In the heyday of the musical film,

series — one in 1936, another in 1938,
and the last in 1940. (The title was a
tribute to M-G-M's 1929 Oscar winner
"Broadway Melody," the first of the
backstage musicals.) The 1938 edition is
the most famous, because it featured 16-
year-old Judy Garland, just one year
before "The Wizard of Oz," singing the
irresistible "Dear Mr. Gable (You Made
Me Love You)." She plays Sophie
Tucker's daughter — the mind boggles
— a talented teenager who auditions for
the biggest producer on Broadway
(Robert Taylor). So does just about
everyone else in the movie: Eleanor
Powell, George Murphy, Buddy Ebsen,
etc. The script (Jack McGowan and Sid
Silvers) is second-rate, the direction
(Roy Del Ruth) a little flat, and you may
cringe every time Eleanor Powell
crinkles up her nose in an effort to act
cute. But Tucker reprises her trademark
song, "Some of These Days," Garland
leads the big "Everybody Sing" number
in Taylor's office, and that lanky, folksy
comic dancer Buddy Ebsen is always a

this strategy "criss-cross murders.")
Working from Patricia Highsmith's
novel. Raymond Chandler and Czenzi
Ormonde provided Hitchcock with a
witty, beautifully calculated screenplay,
and Robert Walker's malignantly
charming Bruno is among the two or
three best performances Hitchcock ever

film among the poor in an unnamed city:
Paralyzed or muted by their own fear

and hardships, they are reminiscent of
the pipe dreamers in O'Neill's "The
Iceman Cometh," but the delicate
melancholy with which he portrays them
suggests Hans Christian Andersen, and
so do the fairy-tale, finger-painted art
direction and The
dramatis personae includes a cuckold
who plays father to all his whore-wife's
kids, a girl who constructs paper flowers
until she collapses from exhaustion, a
thief, an old sage, and — most
memorably — a dreamer and his beggar
son, who live in the carcass of an ancient
abandoned car. Beautifully acted and di
rected. / ' j. V
Plays Tuesday evening at 8.
After the Thin Man (1936)
Kresge Auditorium ,
Frances Goodrich and Albert Hack
ctt, the authors of the original "Thin Man"
script, worked oh this sequel, too, but
it's rather heavy-handed and it seems

awfully long. The colorful cast includes
Elissa Landi, displaying her 1920s
drawing-room melodrama style; Jessie
Ralph as a tyrannical matriarch; Joseph
Calleia as a beady-eyed gangster; Alan
Marshall as an alcoholic; Teddy Hart as
a lawyer; Sam Levene as a cop; and
Jimmy Stewart, giving arguably his worst
performance (at least until Hitchcock's
"Rope"). Nick and Nora Charles, the
highball-slinging sleuths, are played
once again by William Powell and
Myrna Loy, and Asia's still around, too,
trying to keep a new dog in town away
from his canine wife. Directed by
W.S.Van Dyke.
Plays tonight at 9.
Strangers on a Train (1951)
Cedar, San Francisco
Alfred Hitchcock's movie has a tan
talizingly clever premise: on a train, Guy
(Farley Granger) meets Bruno (Robert
Walker), who promises to eliminate

Guy's troublesome wife if, in return,
Guy will kill Bruno's father. (Bruno calls
this strategy "criss-cross murders.")
Working from Patricia Highsmith's
novel. Raymond Chandler and Czenzi
Ormonde provided Hitchcock with a
witty, beautifully calculated screenplay,
and Robert Walker's malignantly
charming Bruno is among the two or
three best performances Hitchcock ever
directed. It's a marvelous movie, as
sembled with true mastery. Hitchcock
puts the two most suspenseful sequences
back to back: the tennis match and the
merry-go-round clim'ax. With Ruth
Roman, Leo G. Carroll. Patricia
Hitchcock, Marion Lome. Howard St.
John and Laura Elliott.
Plays today and tomorrow with Orson
Welles' "The Stranger."
The Wild Child (1970)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
A triumph of humanistic filmmaking.

In this tender, impassioned film, Fran
cois Truffaut returned to the world of
childhood, which he had last visited in
"The 400 Blows ": The screenplay by
Truffaut and Jean Gruault is based on an
account by Dr. Jean Jtard of a boy dis
covered in the forest of Aveyron. France
in 1798 — a boy of about 12 years who
had grown up among the beasts of the
forest and whose behavior bore little
resemblance to that of other human*,
hard attempted to educate the boy and
to determine whether his conduct was
the result of brain damage or just of en
vironmental influences. The character of
Itard (played by Truffaut himself), who
attempts with infinite patience to bridge
the gap between Victor and the civilized
world of the end of the 18th century,
suggests the humanitarians in Dickens'
novels who rescue mistreated youngsters
(Brownlow in "Oliver Twist," for exam
ple).
Plays Wednesday and Thursday with
"The Last Metro."

Private Lives (1931)
Castro, San Francisco
Sidney Franklin, normally a heavy
handed director M-G-M hauled out for
its most expensive properties — and
nothing was ever heavier than an M-G-
M prestige picture — did a surprisingly
good job putting Noel Coward's play on
screen (with an adaptation by Hans
Kraly and Richard Schayer). Even more
surprising is Norma Shearer's perfor
mance as Amanda: She's no Maggie
Smith, but she's not bad at all. and
Robert Montgomery is excellent as
Elyot. Their respective spouses are
played by Reginald Denny and Una
Me'rkel.
Plays tomorrow with "Dinner at
Eight."
The Pirate (1948)
Castro, San Francisco
This Vincente Minnelli musical is low
on invention (even the Cole Porter score
totters; he must have expended all his
energy that year on his Broadway hit.
"Kiss Me. Kate") yet high-spirited and
amiable. The source is a play by S.N.
Behrman about the romance of a young
woman in the Caribbean and an actor
who plays the role of the pirate she fan
tasizes about. Mack the Black. Luckily.
Judy Garland and Gene Kelly are the
principals, and though the supporting
cast (Walter Slezak. Reginald Owen.
Gladys Cooper) is a bit stiff, the amazing
athletic dancers, the Nicholas Brothers,
make an appearance. The hit song (and
best number). "Be a Clown." bear a
strong thematic and musical
resemblance to the great "Make Em
Laugh" number in "Singin' in the Rain"
(which came four years later).
Plays Sunday with "Singin' in the
Rain."
The Last Metro (1981) .
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Francois Truffaut and his co-writer
Suzanne Schiffman have chosen a
fabulous setting — the theater world in
Paris during the Occupation — but they
stay determinedly on the surface. The
tone of the film, with its roster of social
atrocities perpetrated during the reign of
the Nazis, is amused, lightly wry; this
movie seems to be telling us that it
would be a mistake to take all of this po
litical intrigue too seriously. "The Last
Metro" is a pleasant, polished diversion,
full of talented actors, but it isn't really
about anything.
Plays Wednesday and Thursday with
"The Wild Child."
