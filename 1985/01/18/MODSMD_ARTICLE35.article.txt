# Trancos woman chases stranger from bathroom
## 
### MARY YUH Staff writer 
A resident of Wilbur Hall's
Trancos dormitory said she was
startled in the shower by a male
stranger shortly after 11 yesterday
morning.
Freshman Kim Coleman said she
was showering in Trancos' third-floor
bathroom when she noticed that a
man was looking in. He ran as soon as
she saw him, she said.
Coleman said she put on her towel
and ran after him. "I yelled at him,
What do you think you're doing?'
while he was running away from me,"
she said. "I wasn't scared, I was really
mad."
Coleman said she was aided in the
chase by Trancos residents Craig Ash
er, Mahlon Meyer and Erik Hage
stad. They were able to obtain the
man's license plate number before he
drove away, she said.
Coleman later called the police to
report the incident. "They were really
helpful and understanding," she said.

"They were doing.everything they
could."
She described the intruder, whom
she said she saw only from the hack,
as short and chubby with very thick
black hair. He was wearing a green
and-blue-striped short-sleeved shirt
and blue jeans, she said.
A man answering that description
was seen earlier yesterday morning
by Jim Canales, also a resident of
Trancos. Canales said he was walking
to the shower around 9:30 when he
saw a man wash his hands on the
men's side of the same third-floor
bathroom and then leave. Some 20
minutes later, he again saw the man
in the bathroom washing his hands,
Canales said.
"The man was seen around the
bathroom," Coleman said. "The guy
was waiting for a girl to use the
shower. It was definitely intentional.
There was no way it was accidental.
"I'm very angry that my privacy
has been violated," she said. "He had
no business being in the girls
shower."
