# Approval delayed on apartment plan
## 
### 
Plans to build 108 apartment units
and a 42-unit "hometel" near the
Stanford Medical Center struck a
snag at the Palo Alto City Council
meeting earlier this week when a new
city requirement for 16 additional
parking places for guests on the site
could not be met.
After huddling with city staff mem
bers. Stanford project manager Niel
Davidson agreed that the proposal
should be postponed until a later
meeting. In the meantime, efforts will
be made to resolve the problem.
The guest parking requirement was
adopted by the city after the design of
the complex was completed. The city
staff had thought the new require
ment did not pertain to projects that
had begun the city's review process,
but found Monday that such was not
the case. The 1100 Welch Rd. com
plex had been approved by the Ar
chitectural Review Board in October
and the Planning Commission on
Dec. 19.
Davidson told the council that the
requirement presented "a very major
problem; I only hope that we can
resolve it." There is no room on the
4.1-acre site for the spaces, he said,
and a variety of alternatives — some
of thom very costly and probably not

feasible — will have to be inves
tigated.
Finding room on the site for the 16
spaces could mean the loss of 10 to 15
units or an expensive addition to an
underground parking garage, David
son said.
"Redesign of the project to trim 15
units would be a disaster," he added.
The units are to be built at the cor
ner of Pasteur Drive and Welch
Road. A total of 234 parking places
was planned. Under the city or
dinance, guest parking must be pro
vided for 10 percent of the total num
ber of units in a multifamily residen
tial project, plus one space.
The complex is to consist of seven
buildings, each four stories tall. Six of
them will contain 18 units to be
rented primarily to medical center
employees. The seventh will contain
42 "hometel" units designed for
short-term use by outpatients at the
center and their families. The
"hometel" units will be provided at
reduced rates under a subsidy pro
gram sponsored by the Santa Clara
County Assistance League.
Davidson said he hopes the project
can return to the council agenda as
soon as possible after the parking
issue is resolved.
