Bangladesh police kill 6 in riot
DHAKA, Bangladesh — Police opened fire on protesting workers
near the Bangladesh capital, killing six people and wounding 200, labor
union officials claimed yesterday.
A police spokesman said 20 policemen were injured in Wednesday's
clashes near the university town of Savar, about 22 miles north of
Dhaka.
The trouble began when about 500 textile workers beseiged a local
garment factory to press their claim for a pay raise. Police were called in
and used tear gas to drive the workers away and free executives trapped
inside the building.
Workers from a nearby textile mill then joined the melee, hurling
missiles, sticks and acid bottles at police, who fired into the crowd, kill
ing six people, witnesses said. Fifty demonstrators were arrested.
Riot police were brought in from the capital as violence spread
through the town of 20,000. The authorities later clamped an indefinite
ban on all gatherings.
Networks agree on exit polls
WASHINGTON — The three major television networks yesterday
agreed not to use exit polls to project the probable winner of a presiden
tial election in any state until the polls have closed in that state.
The agreement opens the way to a possible uniform poll-closing time
for presidential elections in the lower 48 states, according to two con
gressmen who have worked with the networks to prevent early election
calls from influencing the election in states where the polls have not
closed.
The network agreement follows public criticism and pressure that
grew from early projections of the 1980 and 1984 presidential election
winners based on poll data.
In 1984, the networks projected Ronald Reagan as the winner at
about 8:30 p.m. EST, several hours before the polls had closed in about
half the states, including New York. Reagan had won a majority in the
Electoral College, based on network projections.
In 1980, networks made a similarly early projection of Reagan as the
winner. Jimmy Carter also raised the ire of West Coast Democrats by
conceding several hours before the polls closed in the western states.
Democrats complained that these early calls of the presidential races
may have cost them several seats in the House and in state legislatures
because many Democratic voters concluded that there was no point in
going to the polls.
The networks' agreement was the result of negotiations with Reps. A 1
Swift (D-Wash.), chairman of the House Task Force on Elections, and
William Thomas (R-Bakersfield), its ranking minority member. In a
joint news conference to announce the agreement, Swift and Thomas
emphasized that they preferred a voluntary agreement.
"We have always believed that a voluntary approach by the networks
toward participating in a solution was far preferable to any effort by
Congress to legislate what they could or could not do," the two said in a
statement.
They indicated that both the networks' agreement and a uniform
closing law would be required to eliminate the early projection of a pres
idential winner because in many elections, the winner won a majority of
electors before the polls closed on the West Coast.
U.S. decries Ethiopian ship capture
WASHINGTON — Ethiopia has seized an Australian cargo ship car
rying food to rebel-held areas in an "unconscionable" act that is
"destructive" to efforts to aid the drought-stricken African nation, a
State Department official said yesterday.
Calling on the United Nations to investigate the matter, M. Peter
McPherson, administrator of the Agency for International Develop
ment, said the U.S. government was "upset" by Ethiopia's action.
McPherson's comments, echoed by other officials, came during a Sen
are Foreign Relations Committee hearing on the worsening African
famine. The session was called to hear testimony on the Reagan admin
istration's request for an additional $235 million to aid millions of
people in a number of sub-Sahara countries threatened by starvation,
but it turned into a forum for criticism of the Ethiopian regime.
Amid the public's unprecedented response to the Ethiopian famine,
U.S. government officials had set aside their political differences with
the Marxist nation, seeking to thaw relations enough to allow free move
ment of food, clothing and medical and other supplies into the country.
But Ethiopia's seizure several days ago of the Australian ship Golden
Venture at the Red Sea port of Assab has created new tensions. The ves
sel was loaded with 6,000 tons of food bound for the provinces of Eritrea
and Tigre, where separatists are battling Ethiopian government troops.
In addition, the seizure brought to the surface the simmering anger
among many U.S. officials, who believe the United States and other na
tions are trying to help a country that is not trying to help itself— a na
tion that, in fact, makes it difficult for others to help.
Return of killers demanded
SAN FRANCISCO — A California congressman urged President
Reagan yesterday to demand the return of two Taiwanese men accused
of killing Chinese-American journalist Henry Liu.
"The response by federal authorities in the prosecution of the Henry
Liu case has been outrageous," said Rep. Norman Mineta (D-San Jose).
"How can Chinese-Americans feel safe when the president remains
silent over this terrorism and the Justice Department has to be dragged
kicking and screaming to the investigation of the case?
"The president should demand that the Taiwan government return
the two suspects in Mr. Liu's killing, if only to assure all of us as U.S.
citizens that Taiwan will not become a sanctuary for terrorism here in
the United States."
Liu, 52, a political writer for the San Francisco Journal, was gunned
down Oct. 15 in the garage of his home in Daly City, located just south
of San Francisco.
Sen. Hart meets with Gromyko
MOSCOW — Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko, in his first
meeting with an American official since the talks in Geneva, told Sen.
Gary Hart (D-Colo.) yesterday that he hopes U.S. negotiators will move
directly to "concrete proposals" when the two sides resume arms
negotiations.
In a brief interview outside the Kremlin, where he spent two hours
with Gromyko, Hart said the Soviet foreign minister stressed that the
arms talks should begin "sooner better than later . . . but not if sooner
leads to generalities."
Hart, who unsuccessfully sought the 1984 Democratic presidential
nomination, reportedly is positioning himself for another try in 1988.
His reception here by Gromyko and other Soviet officials indicates that
the Soviets are interested in his future prospects.
A Hart aide described the atmosphere at yesterday's meeting as
"frank, businesslike and friendly." He said the meeting had been ex
pected to last 30 to 45 minutes.
Hart, a member of the Armed Services Committee, said much of his
conversation with Gromyko centered on the coming arms negotiations
agreed upon by Gromyko and Secretary of State George Shultz in
Geneva earlier this month.
Hart said Gromyko reiterated the Soviet position "in terms virtually
identical" to statements made in an interview on Soviet television Sun
day.
The Soviets have made clear that their top priority in the talks is to
halt the U.S. development of space-based weapons. According to Hart,
Gromyko did not repeat his statement made on Soviet television that an
American failure to negotiate in good faith over the space weapons issue
would "blow up" the talks.
Stocks finish mixed
NEW YORK — Airline issues sold off sharply in an otherwise mixed
and drifting stock-market session yesterday.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down about 7 points at its
midday low, closed with a loss of 1.99 at 1,228.69.

"We have always believed that a voluntary approach by the networks
toward participating in a solution was far preferable to any effort by
Congress to legislate what they could or could not do," the two said in a
statement.
They indicated that both the networks' agreement and a uniform
closing law would be required to eliminate the early projection of a pres
idential winner because in many elections, the winner won a majority of
electors before the polls closed on the West Coast.
U.S. decries Ethiopian ship capture
WASHINGTON — Ethiopia has seized an Australian cargo ship car
rying food to rebel-held areas in an "unconscionable" act that is
"destructive" to efforts to aid the drought-stricken African nation, a
State Department official said yesterday.
Calling on the United Nations to investigate the matter, M. Peter
McPherson, administrator of the Agency for International Develop
ment, said the U.S. government was "upset" by Ethiopia's action.
McPherson's comments, echoed by other officials, came during a Sen
are Foreign Relations Committee hearing on the worsening African
famine. The session was called to hear testimony on the Reagan admin
istration's request for an additional $235 million to aid millions of
people in a number of sub-Sahara countries threatened by starvation,
but it turned into a forum for criticism of the Ethiopian regime.
Amid the public's unprecedented response to the Ethiopian famine,
U.S. government officials had set aside their political differences with
the Marxist nation, seeking to thaw relations enough to allow free move
ment of food, clothing and medical and other supplies into the country.
But Ethiopia's seizure several days ago of the Australian ship Golden
Venture at the Red Sea port of Assab has created new tensions. The ves
sel was loaded with 6,000 tons of food bound for the provinces of Eritrea
and Tigre, where separatists are battling Ethiopian government troops.
In addition, the seizure brought to the surface the simmering anger
among many U.S. officials, who believe the United States and other na
tions are trying to help a country that is not trying to help itself— a na
tion that, in fact, makes it difficult for others to help.
Return of killers demanded
SAN FRANCISCO — A California congressman urged President
Reagan yesterday to demand the return of two Taiwanese men accused
of killing Chinese-American journalist Henry Liu.
"The response by federal authorities in the prosecution of the Henry
Liu case has been outrageous," said Rep. Norman Mineta (D-San Jose).
"How can Chinese-Americans feel safe when the president remains
silent over this terrorism and the Justice Department has to be dragged
kicking and screaming to the investigation of the case?
"The president should demand that the Taiwan government return
the two suspects in Mr. Liu's killing, if only to assure all of us as U.S.
citizens that Taiwan will not become a sanctuary for terrorism here in
the United States."
Liu, 52, a political writer for the San Francisco Journal, was gunned
down Oct. 15 in the garage of his home in Daly City, located just south
of San Francisco.
Sen. Hart meets with Gromyko
MOSCOW — Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko, in his first
meeting with an American official since the talks in Geneva, told Sen.
Gary Hart (D-Colo.) yesterday that he hopes U.S. negotiators will move
directly to "concrete proposals" when the two sides resume arms
negotiations.
In a brief interview outside the Kremlin, where he spent two hours
with Gromyko, Hart said the Soviet foreign minister stressed that the
arms talks should begin "sooner better than later . . . but not if sooner
leads to generalities."
Hart, who unsuccessfully sought the 1984 Democratic presidential
nomination, reportedly is positioning himself for another try in 1988.
His reception here by Gromyko and other Soviet officials indicates that
the Soviets are interested in his future prospects.
A Hart aide described the atmosphere at yesterday's meeting as
"frank, businesslike and friendly." He said the meeting had been ex
pected to last 30 to 45 minutes.
Hart, a member of the Armed Services Committee, said much of his
conversation with Gromyko centered on the coming arms negotiations
agreed upon by Gromyko and Secretary of State George Shultz in
Geneva earlier this month.
Hart said Gromyko reiterated the Soviet position "in terms virtually
identical" to statements made in an interview on Soviet television Sun
day.
The Soviets have made clear that their top priority in the talks is to
halt the U.S. development of space-based weapons. According to Hart,
Gromyko did not repeat his statement made on Soviet television that an
American failure to negotiate in good faith over the space weapons issue
would "blow up" the talks.

Bangladesh police kill 6 in riot
DHAKA, Bangladesh — Police opened fire on protesting workers
near the Bangladesh capital, killing six people and wounding 200, labor
union officials claimed yesterday.
A police spokesman said 20 policemen were injured in Wednesday's
clashes near the university town of Savar, about 22 miles north of
Dhaka.
The trouble began when about 500 textile workers beseiged a local
garment factory to press their claim for a pay raise. Police were called in
and used tear gas to drive the workers away and free executives trapped
inside the building.
Workers from a nearby textile mill then joined the melee, hurling
missiles, sticks and acid bottles at police, who fired into the crowd, kill
ing six people, witnesses said. Fifty demonstrators were arrested.
Riot police were brought in from the capital as violence spread
through the town of 20,000. The authorities later clamped an indefinite
ban on all gatherings.
Networks agree on exit polls
WASHINGTON — The three major television networks yesterday
agreed not to use exit polls to project the probable winner of a presiden
tial election in any state until the polls have closed in that state.
The agreement opens the way to a possible uniform poll-closing time
for presidential elections in the lower 48 states, according to two con
gressmen who have worked with the networks to prevent early election
calls from influencing the election in states where the polls have not
closed.
The network agreement follows public criticism and pressure that
grew from early projections of the 1980 and 1984 presidential election
winners based on poll data.
In 1984, the networks projected Ronald Reagan as the winner at
about 8:30 p.m. EST, several hours before the polls had closed in about
half the states, including New York. Reagan had won a majority in the
Electoral College, based on network projections.
In 1980, networks made a similarly early projection of Reagan as the
winner. Jimmy Carter also raised the ire of West Coast Democrats by
conceding several hours before the polls closed in the western states.
Democrats complained that these early calls of the presidential races
may have cost them several seats in the House and in state legislatures
because many Democratic voters concluded that there was no point in
going to the polls.
The networks' agreement was the result of negotiations with Reps. A 1
Swift (D-Wash.), chairman of the House Task Force on Elections, and
William Thomas (R-Bakersfield), its ranking minority member. In a
joint news conference to announce the agreement, Swift and Thomas
emphasized that they preferred a voluntary agreement.

toward participating in a solution was far preferable to any effort by
