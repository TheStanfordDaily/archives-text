# Times: Reagan to test 'Star Wars'
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES â€” President
Reagan will certify that condi
tions Congress set on tests of a new
anti-satellite defense system have
been met. then direct the Air Force to
test the weapon against an object in
space, according to a published
report.
"There'll be a certification, and
we'll proceed with the testing," the
Los Angeles Times quoted an uni
dentified White House official as
saying.

Reagan is expected to issue the Air
Force directive around March 1, with
the first weapon test expected in late
spring or early summer, the Times
said in today's editions, quoting an
unidentified Air Force official.
Congressional guidelines issued
last spring blocked the Reagan ad
ministration from conducting the
tests until after March 1 and required
the president to certify that condi
tions dealing with arms Control
negotiations had been met.

Many legislators hoped to slow the
experimentation process by restrain
ing the number of tests so U.S. and
Soviet arms negotiators could have
time to work on limiting development
of anti-satellite systems.
Such weaponry is intended to
destroy enemy satellites that could
carry information from the battlefield
back to opposing commanders.
In its guidelines. Congress
demanded that Reagan certify the
weapons testing is in accordance with

the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of
1972, is in the interest of national se
curity and wouldn't hinder the possi
bility of negotiating a cap on such
weapons.
Up to now, weapons testing has
been aimed at points in space rather
than specific objects. The Air Force
has so far conducted two tests involv
ing the launch of a missile from an F
-15 jet, the Times said.
