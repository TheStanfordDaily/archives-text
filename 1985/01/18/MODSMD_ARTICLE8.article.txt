# GOP warns of military cuts
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — House Republican leaders
came away from a two-hour meeting yesterday
with Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger warn
ing that they support cuts in President Reagan's
military buildup, possibly including curtailment of
some weapons systems.
It was the second day in a row that key GOP fig
ures in Congress have suggested that weapons may
have to be cut or canceled as part of the Pentagon's
contribution to a deficit-reduction package. A
similar suggestion was made Wednesday by Assis
tant Senate Majority Leader Alan Simpson (R-
Wyo.)
Weinberger, while acquiescing in some budget
cuts, has zealously guarded weapon systems. The
meeting with the lawmakers was closed, but Mi
chael Burch, the chief Defense Department
spokesman, said Weinberger had planned to tell
the Republican legislators that "any talk" of a
defense-budget freeze or cuts "could have an im
pact on the willingness of the Soviets to negotiate
seriously" on arms control.
"The budget contains the smallest defense ex
penditure that the president can recommend while
still living up to his constitutional authority as

Commander-in-chief," Burch said Weinberger had
planned to say.
But in comments after the session. House
Minority Leader Robert Michel, (R-III.) indicated
the Pentagon may face critical losses in Congress,
such as defeat for the MX missile, unless a compro
mise is reached on defense spending.
Republicans will propose spending cuts "if we
find that strictly adhering to a Weinberger line will
cause us in the end to lose several very important
votes," Michel said in answer to a question about
the MX missile, which faces what could be a life-or
death vote early this spring.
"I've got enough of a reading to sense there is a
view on our (the Republican) side that we can
make some reductions from [Weinberger's] re
quest," Michel added.
Weinberger has agreed to what congressional
leaders regard as modest cuts in the administra
tion's planned spending for defense over the next
three years. Including the cutbacks, this would
leave a military spending increase for the next fiscal
year of 5.7 percent after accounting for inflation,
Weinberger said yesterday. Some congressional
sources have computed the increase to be larger.

Earlier this week. Michel suggested a bipartisan
trade-off under which Democrats would support
the MX in exchange for trimming the increase to 4
percent after inflation.
But Senate Republicans are considering more
drastic steps, including a one-year, across-the
board freeze under which the Defense Department
would get no more new spending authority than it
has this year.
Counting the freeze on spending authority, ac
tual defense outlays for next year are expected to
rise by about $20 billion, largely because the cost of
previously approved weapons is spread over
several years.
This has prompted serious talk among
Republicans of canceling weapons programs for the
first time since Reagan began his military buildup
four years ago. Simpson spoke Wednesday ot
breaking procurement contracts if necessary to
bring down costs.
While Michel did not go that far, he reminded
Weinberger that the administration is pushing for
curtailment or elimination of many domestic pro
grams and added:
