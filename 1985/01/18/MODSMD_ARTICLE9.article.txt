# Capital gears up for inaugural
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Awash in
limousines, minks and champagne,
the nation's capital launches a four
day extravaganza today to celebrate
the second inaugural of President
Ronald Wilson Reagan — the 50th
presidential inauguration since
George Washington took the oath of
office in 1789.
Official inaugural planners, hoping
to hold costs to about two-thirds of
the $15.5 million spent on Reagan's
first inaugural in 1981, had called for
a celebration that would be "subdued
by some standards of the past." But
in keeping with official Washington's

love for pageantry, this year's fes
tivities will lack none of the splendor
and gaiety traditionally associated
with presidential inaugurals.
"What you've got here is a celebra
tion of the successes of the past four
years, the success of the re-election
effort and the successes we expect the
administration to have over the next
four years," said Tucker Eskew, a
spokesman for the Committee for the
50th American Presidential In
augural.
The official program includes eight
black-tie balls plus a special youth
ball, two galas featuring such big

name entertainers as Frank Sinatra
and the Beach Boys, two fireworks
displays and, of course, the tradi
tional Inauguration Day parade down
Pennsylvania Avenue.
In addition, there is a staggering ar
ray of official and unofficial art ex
hibits, concerts, pageants, cocktail
parties, receptions and dinners. One
of the most glittering affairs will be
the Conservative Alliance's "Salute
to President Reagan" Sunday, hosted
by entertainer Sammy Davis Jr.
Guests will enter the dining room
amid a display of laser lights and
video-screen effects and will feast on

caviar, salmon and saddle of lamb
with sauce Pascal.
This year's inaugural also features
two swearing-in ceremonies. Because
Jan. 20, the constitutionally
mandated date for the inauguration,
falls on a Sunday — and a Super Bowl
Sunday at that — the president will
be sworn in at a quiet White House
ceremony on that day. On Monday,
he will repeat the oath of office, this
time at the Capitol before 140,000
guests.
