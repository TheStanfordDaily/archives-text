# Crowd maintains order

The largest Super Bowl ever to be held on
a college campus came and went this
weekend, and the University avoided many
of the major problems — from unruly
crowds to terrorist attacks — that sometimes
accompany such large sports and media
events.
"It went real well," said Stanford Police
Chief Marvin Herrington . "It was an easier
crowd to control than Big Game.
Traffic was directed on and off campus
without major tie-ups and the crowd of
84,059 in the stadium remained
manageable. There were only 34 arrests
Sunday.
Traffic was not much worse than at Stan
ford football games. Herrington estimated it
took about an hour to get off campus. Many
fans heeded earlier warnings about potential

traffic problems and took buses and trains to
the stadium.
Of the arrests made at Stanford, 11 were
for fence-jumping, 10 for public drunken
ness, five for ticket scalping, three for purse
snatching and pickpocketing, two for dis
turbing the peace, one for driving under the
influence and one for a fake concession pass.
Four of those arrested were also cited on
drug charges. Two were juveniles.
There were 64 vehicles towed for illegal
parking.
The counterfeit ticket scam uncovered
late last week did not cause many problems.
Although 105 bogus tickets were believed to
be circulating, ticket takers only caught
eight people attempting to enter with fake
tickets.
Stanford crew Coach Jim Harwell, whose
team members worked as ticket-takers, said
fans offered bribes from $1,000 to a free

vacation in the Bahamas for entry into the
stadium. He also said a pimp offered one
ticket-taker the services of one of his pros
titutes in exchange for admission.
There were no problems with San Fran
cisco fans attempting to run onto the field to
celebrate the 49ers' 38-16 victory over
Miami. Although the chain-link fence that
usually surrounds the field had been
removed to allow better visibility, student
volunteers lined the edge of the field to
prevent such a celebration.
One of the few problems resulted when a
stalled car between Gates Three and Four
blocked pedestrian traffic for several
minutes .just before 2:30 p.m. One
policeman estimated that XO.OOO were
caught in the tie-up.


At least some of the 84,059 fans who piled into Stanford
Stadium for Sunday's Super Bowl left a whole lot of litter, but

officials say they encountered no major problems over the
weekend.
