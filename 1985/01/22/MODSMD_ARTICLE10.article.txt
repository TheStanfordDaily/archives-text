3 arms delegates named
WASHINGTON — President Reagan on Friday
named Washington lawyer Max Kampelman, a conserva
tive Democrat, as overall chief of the new U.S. negotiat
ing team at the arms-control talks with the Soviet Union
that are expected to begin in March.
In additon to his leading role, Kampelman also will
oversee specific negotiations on space weapons, one of the
three sets of talks under the broader negotiating umbrella,
Secretary of State George Shultz announced.
Former Sen. John Tower (R-Tex.), a moderate conser
vative, will be in charge of the intermediate-range talks,
;Shultz said.
In a surprise move, Shultz announced that retired Gen.
Edward Rowny, who led the previous U.S. strategic arms
team, will leave to become a special adviser to Shultz on
armaments — "promoted up and probably out," one ex
pert observed.
The Soviets reaction to the new delegation will prob
ably be more positive than negative, said Dmitri Simes of
the Carnegie Endowment for World Peace. But Helmut
Sonnenfeldt, a senior national security official said he
believes the choices "will keep Moscow guessing about
how serious U.S. intentions are for the talks."
Kampelman, 64, is the most controversial member of
the new team. Once an aide to Minnesota Sen. Hubert
Humphrey, Kampelman has had virtually no experience
with arms issues. He led the U.S. delegation to a 1982-83
follow-up meeting in Madrid, Spain, to the Helsinki Con
ference on Security and Cooperation in Europe.
However, Kampelman was favored — one official said
he was "the only candidate" — by both Shultz and na
tional security adviser Robert McFarlane. Asked about
Kampelman's credentials, Shultz told reporters: "He's
smart. He's a good negotiator. He's experienced, and he
did an outstanding job in Madrid."
But some experts, speaking privately, said the appoint
ment could be taken as a sign that the administration does
not intend to negotiate seriously on "Star Wars" and
other space weapons issues.
Nonetheless, the Soviets know and probably respect
Kampelman as a serious negotiator from the Madrid
meeting, Simes said. "Certainly, there is not the personal
animosity toward Kampelman that the Soviets have
toward Rowny," he said.
Sharon wins 2nd round
NEW YORK — Former Israeli Defense Minister Ariel
Sharon won a second round in his $50 million libel suit
against Time, Inc. Friday when Time's report that he dis
cussed revenge against Palestinians with Lebanese Chris
tian leaders was found false by jurors.
The jurors then returned immediately to deliberate a

third issue necessary to determine if Sharon was libeled:
whether Time acted with malice.
Marshals kept the packed courtroom locked while the
jury's verdict on the second issue, that Time defamed
Sharon in reporting that he had "discussed" revenge with
Lebanese Falangists at a meeting the day after President
elect Bashir Gemayel, a Falangist leader, was assassinated
in September 1982. The massacre of hundreds of Pales
tinians by Lebanese Christian militiamen at two refugee
camps in Israeli-controlled West Beirut began the follow
ing day.
To award Sharon a libel verdict, the jury still must find
Time guilty of malice — that it published the report either
knowing it was false or with reckless disregard of whether
it was true or false. Sharon also must show damage to his
reputation.
Time had conceded during the trial that a secret report
did not in fact contain the material that its report, part of a
Feb. 21, 1983, cover story, had alleged. The magazine
printed a correction in last week's issue.
Milton Gould, Sharon's attorney, described the jury as
"six ordinary human beings" who proved "this is an out
rageous lie."
"I'm glad that after that long struggle, we learned that
it's a long way to arrive at the truth, but a rewarding one,"
Sharon said on the courthouse steps shortly after the
jury's decision was read.
"Of course, the trial is still going on and there are other
issues to be discussed and decided upon. But the most im
portant thing has been proved: that Time magazine lied,"

said Sharon, now his nation's minister of industry and
commerce.
U.S. quits World Court
WASHINGTON — The United States Friday walked
out of World Court hearings on charges that Washington
is trying to overthrow the Nicaraguan government.
Nicaragua immediately branded America an "outlaw gov
ernment."
"With great reluctance the United States has decided
not to participate in further proceedings in this case," ac
cording to a statement released by the U.S. Information
Service through the U.S. Embassy in The Hague.
The case was brought before the court April 9 by
Nicaragua, which charged that the United States was
using force to topple the pro-Cuban Sandinista govern
ment through its mining of Nicaraguan harbors and back
ing of anti-Sandinista guerrillas.
Legal experts at the court said it was the first time in 15
years that a nation had quit the court while proceedings
were in progress.
"The United States has consistently taken the position
that the proceedings initiated by Nicaragua in the Interna
tional Court of Justice are a misuse of the court for politi
cal purposes and that the court lacks jurisdiction and com
petence over such a case," the U.S. statement said.
"The court's decision of Nov. 26, 1984, finding that it
had jurisdiction is contrary to law and fact," it added.
Carlos 'Arguello, Nicaraguan ambassador to the Neth
erlands and the chief lawyer for the Nicaraguan side, im
mediately denounced the U.S. move.

"My conclusion is that the new government which is
going to be inaugurated ... is an outlaw government," he
said.
"The first public decision of the new government is to
reaffirm the policy of the Reagan Administration of
violating international law. making the government of the
United States an international delinquent."
Legal experts said that from the U.N.-constituted
court's point of view, the pullout would have little practi
cal effect on the proceedings because they will go ahead
whether or not the United States defends itself.
In Washington. State Department spokesman Alan
Romberg said the Nicaraguan case "presents political
questions that are not susceptible to resolution by any
court and that under the United Nations charter are spe
cifically not intended for the World Court."
"The broad political security problems of Central
America will be solved only by political and diplomatic
means— not through a judicial tribunal."
Disposable income jumps
WASHINGTON — Americans' income, after subtract
ing taxes and inflation, rose a strong 6.8 percent last year,
the biggest increase in two decades, the government said
Friday.
The Commerce Department said the increase in dis
posable income — the amount of money available after
paying taxes — almost doubled the 3.5 percent gain in
1983 and was the largest since a 7.1 percent rise in 1964.
Americans not only had more disposable income in
1984, but they chose to spend more of it. Consumer
spending, after discounting inflation, rose 5.3 percent, the
best showing in eight years.
Since consumer spending makes up two-thirds of the
overall economy, the surge was a key factor in keeping the
recovery going last year, analysts said.
They credited the big gains in disposable income to
hefty increases in employment and the final phase of the
Reagan Administration tax cuts that gave Americans
more money to spend. Also helping was the continuing
low inflation rate.
Before taking out the effects of inflation, personal
incomes rose 9.8 percent in 1984, the best increase since a
12.2 percent rise in 1981 when the inflation rate was
much higher. Personal incomes before discounting infla
tion were up 6.2 percent in 1983. 1
"Last year was an extraordinary year in terms of good
performance in real income and sustained low inflation,"
said Allen Sinai, chief economist for Shearson Lehman-
American Express.
Sinai and other economists noted that 1984 also ended
on a strong note, providing momentum that should ensure
continued growth into 1985.
