## The
						Stanford Daily A
						choice worth keeping 
### 
Tomorrow, a decision will be made on whether
or not to close a co-op or co-ops at Stanford.
The problem is that the co-ops are not filling,
and with the shortage of housing on campus. Res
idential Education finds it difficult to justify
maintaining an unpopular living option.
However, the biggest obstacles to filling the co
ops are not the co-ops themselves — which have
evolved with the campus since their founding in
the 1960s — but an uninformed student body.
Many students hesitate to put a co-op on their
Draw card because they are scared of the people
who live in co-ops. Students are afraid they'll be
living with people they just can't relate to —
hippies, granola people or Zen Buddhists.
Some of the people in co-ops are like this, but
many other kinds of people also live in co-ops.
They house hippies and preppies, Buddhists and
Baptists, vegetarians and devout carnivores.
They attract varsity athletes and BMW owners as
well as granola people. Co-op residents are as
varied as the student body itself and can't be ac
curately described by generalizations.
Other students are afraid of the work expected
of co-op members. They fear they would not
have enough time to study and have fun by the

time they finish their house jobs at a co-op.
In reality, doing one's share of the work in a
co-op does not require very much time: maybe
three to five hours per week — only a small dent
in a student's week. In addition, house jobs are
often more like study breaks than a waste of
one's valuable time. Cooking dinner tor the
house on a Friday afternoon in a kitchen filled
with music and about four of your friends is more
like a party than a tiresome task that has to be
endured. Working together with the people one
lives with also builds a sense of camaraderie an
solidarity that is not found in a dorm.
Another benefit to living in a co-op is the cost.
Students don't pay for University Food Service or
housekeeping service, so the cost of room an
board is about two-thirds that incurred by or
mitory residents.
Co-ops need to take a more active role in
promoting their houses if the system is to thrive.
Conversely, if students would take the time to
visit co-ops and talk with residents before filling
out their Draw cards, co-ops would have no trou
ble finding enough residents, and a system which
contributes to diversity at Stanford would be
preserved.
