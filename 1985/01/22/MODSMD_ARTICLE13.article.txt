## Reagan diplomacy not reforming apartheid 
### 
Apartheid is on the American conscience.
The demonstrations of civil disobedience
which have taken place outside the South
African embassy in Washington, D.C. and at mis
sions in other cities have helped to bring the
politics of apartheid into the American public
eye. The timing of these demonstrations is
significant. Following the November elec
tions, the Reagan administration vowed to
continue with the policy it calls "constructive
engagement" toward South Africa. President

VIEWPOINT

Reagan stated that the use of gentle persua
sion in dealing with the apartheid government
had rendered significant reforms.
After having spent five months in southern
Africa, it seems clear to me that Reagan could
hardly have picked a more inappropriate time
to make such a claim. Whi/e I was in South
Africa, the country was suffering its worst in
terna/ conflict since the 1976 youth uprising
in which some 600 people were killed and
4,000 were injured. The anti-apartheid move
ment in the United States has sought to
expose the hypocrisy of "constructive engage
ment" by bringing attention to the realities of
South Africa's enforced racial separation and
the need for change.
South African President P.W. Botha would
like the world to believe that his government
is embarking on a "new deal" of reformism.
His main selling point to the West was a new
constitutional arrangement which would al
low Indians and "Coloreds" an ostensible but
not real role in government. Before initiating
the new constitution, Botha made an overseas
trip to visit Western leaders in an effort to
stem the growing international condemnation
and isolation of his government. Six months
later it seems implausible that even those who
were then optimistically supportive of Botha's

new-deal rhetoric could still have much faith.
While I was in South Africa in October and
November, the state of the country's race re
lations reached a new low. For the first time
ever, the military was sent into black
townships to "restore order." The raids by the
South African Defense Force on the
townships of Sebokeng and Tembisa resulted
in thousands of arrests and detentions and
marked a new phase in South Africa's escalat
ing racial conflict. Leading up to this massive
state crackdown on dissent were numerous
disturbing events. In late September the first
legal strike ever by one of the country's black
trade unions brought bloodshed as 23 mem
bers of the National Union of Mineworkers
were shot dead. General strikes called by
workers in the black townships to protest rent
hikes led to greater violence, and school
boycotts brought black education to a virtual
halt.
The cause of the unrest, artd,.conflict in
South Africa is celatedno rentirtcreases, in
creases in the price of frap/e foods, growing
unemployment and' other economic
hardships. But disillusionment with the gov
ernment's political initiatives must also be
seen as fueling tensions. South Africa's new
constitution did not grant any political
concessions to blacks, who constitute 74 per
cent of the country's population. In fact, if
Botha's government is able to carry out the
"homelands" policy to its logical conclusion,
there will be no black South Africans. When
we consider that the homelands program aims
to fulfill the aspiratfons of the country's 24
million blacks by granting them political inde
pendence in 13 percent of the country's most
impoverished land, we begin to understand
why the new constitution, rather than offering
hope to blacks, is viewed as another step in
the state's genocidal program toward them.
An examination of the economic depravity of

these reserve areas helps one to comprehend
why people living in them have been referred
to as South Africa's "surplus people" or
"displaced people." The homelands policy is
enforced by the state's draconian influx
control legislation, or "pass laws," which
prevent blacks from legally entering "white"
South Africa unless their labor is needed.
The very groups that the government was
trying to co-opt also rejected the new consti
tutional arrangement on the grounds that it

relations reached a new low.

further entrenches apartheidv When it came
to a vote in September, less than 20 percent of
all Coloreds and Indians eligible to vote gave
their support to the new constitution. The
government conveniently ignored this and
moved ahead as planned. The internal conflict
which has rocked South Africa since Septem
ber can only be called disastrous.
The Reagan administration continues to
hold to the line that warm ties to Pretoria, i.e.
"constructive engagement," will allow for
greater leverage in bringing about change in
South Africa. But it has nothing to show
inside South Africa after four years of such
engagement. In terms of regional diplomatic
initiatives, the Reagan administration vowed
that an early achievement of its policies would
be to end South Africa's illegal occupation of
Namibia. In fact, South Africa's military pres
ence in Namibia has grown. The United
States was quick to point to the non

aggression pact signed between South Africa
and Mozambique as a major breakthrough in
southern African diplomacy. However, South
Africa has broken the main pledge it made in
signing the Nkomati accords by continuing to
provide support to the rebels attempting to
overthrow the Mozambican government.
While I was in the Mozambican capital
Maputo in mid-November, the South
African-backed Mozambican National Resis
tance forces launched savage attacks on

villages in Maputo province. I heard
numerous reports of South Africa delivering
arms shipments to rebel forces in the Gaza
province just north of the capital following
the signing of the non-aggression pact.
As the elections in the United States were
approaching, it was apparent that the Botha
government feared what would happen if
Democratic candidate Walter Mondale were
given the chance to carry out his pledge of im
posing economic sanctions against South
Africa. Their concern over American disin
vestment initiatives, anti-apartheid campaigns
and legislated economic controls affecting
business with South Africa is extreme. The
South African press paid daily attention to
such initiatives in the United States. A huge
sigh of relief was sounded by the Afrikaaners
when Reagan was re-elected. They an
ticipated four more years of American acqui
escence allowing them to push ahead with

brutal enforcement of the "homelands" pro
gram and aggression toward neighboring
countries. But Americans are waking up to
the vast difference between the rhetoric and
the reality of what this administration's south
ern African policy has achieved. Grassroots
anti-apartheid activity has stirred public
awareness and placed tremendous pressure
on our government to toughen its stand
against apartheid. In an open letter sent to the
South African ambassador a few weeks ago,
35 conservative House Republicans
threatened to support economic sanctions
against Pretoria unless it moved "aggressively
toward real human rights reforms."
The recent violence and crackdown on dis
senters in South Africa clearly signals the fail
ure of American quiet diplomacy to reform
the apartheid system. The white regime's
police-state crackdown on dissenters is the
worst in almost a decade. The South African
military has assumed a larger role than ever in
crushing domestic dissent. Those being
detained and arrested are mainly advocates of
non-violent change. The Botha government
seems set on destroying the United Demo
cratic Front (UDF), a multiracial coalition ur
ging non-violent change. Of course this will
only force the UDF to go underground and
adopt more extreme measures to bring about
a more just society in South Africa. If the
United States is to support real change in
South Africa — the abandonment of the
genocidal "homelands policy" and the incor
poration of blacks into an acceptable political
dispensation — than it must move toward in
voking economic sanctions and political pres
sure on the apartheid strategists.

Africa, it seems clear to me that Reagan could
hardly have picked a more inappropriate time
to make such a claim. Whi/e I was in South
Africa, the country was suffering its worst in
terna/ conflict since the 1976 youth uprising
in which some 600 people were killed and
4,000 were injured. The anti-apartheid move
ment in the United States has sought to
expose the hypocrisy of "constructive engage
ment" by bringing attention to the realities of
South Africa's enforced racial separation and
the need for change.
South African President P.W. Botha would
like the world to believe that his government
is embarking on a "new deal" of reformism.
His main selling point to the West was a new
constitutional arrangement which would al
low Indians and "Coloreds" an ostensible but
not real role in government. Before initiating
the new constitution, Botha made an overseas
trip to visit Western leaders in an effort to
stem the growing international condemnation
and isolation of his government. Six months
later it seems implausible that even those who
were then optimistically supportive of Botha's

new-deal rhetoric could still have much faith.
While I was in South Africa in October and
November, the state of the country's race re
lations reached a new low. For the first time
ever, the military was sent into black
townships to "restore order." The raids by the
South African Defense Force on the
townships of Sebokeng and Tembisa resulted
in thousands of arrests and detentions and
marked a new phase in South Africa's escalat
ing racial conflict. Leading up to this massive
state crackdown on dissent were numerous
disturbing events. In late September the first
legal strike ever by one of the country's black
trade unions brought bloodshed as 23 mem
bers of the National Union of Mineworkers
were shot dead. General strikes called by
workers in the black townships to protest rent
hikes led to greater violence, and school
boycotts brought black education to a virtual
halt.
The cause of the unrest, artd,.conflict in
South Africa is celatedno rentirtcreases, in

seen as fueling tensions. South Africa's new
constitution did not grant any political
concessions to blacks, who constitute 74 per
cent of the country's population. In fact, if
Botha's government is able to carry out the
"homelands" policy to its logical conclusion,
there will be no black South Africans. When
we consider that the homelands program aims
to fulfill the aspiratfons of the country's 24
million blacks by granting them political inde
pendence in 13 percent of the country's most
impoverished land, we begin to understand
why the new constitution, rather than offering
hope to blacks, is viewed as another step in
the state's genocidal program toward them.
An examination of the economic depravity of

these reserve areas helps one to comprehend
why people living in them have been referred

"displaced people." The homelands policy is
enforced by the state's draconian influx

prevent blacks from legally entering "white"

to a vote in September, less than 20 percent of
all Coloreds and Indians eligible to vote gave
their support to the new constitution. The
government conveniently ignored this and
moved ahead as planned. The internal conflict
which has rocked South Africa since Septem
ber can only be called disastrous.
The Reagan administration continues to
hold to the line that warm ties to Pretoria, i.e.
"constructive engagement," will allow for
greater leverage in bringing about change in
South Africa. But it has nothing to show
inside South Africa after four years of such
engagement. In terms of regional diplomatic
initiatives, the Reagan administration vowed
that an early achievement of its policies would
be to end South Africa's illegal occupation of
Namibia. In fact, South Africa's military pres
ence in Namibia has grown. The United
States was quick to point to the non

aggression pact signed between South Africa
and Mozambique as a major breakthrough in
southern African diplomacy. However, South
Africa has broken the main pledge it made in
signing the Nkomati accords by continuing to
provide support to the rebels attempting to
overthrow the Mozambican government.
While I was in the Mozambican capital
Maputo in mid-November, the South
African-backed Mozambican National Resis
tance forces launched savage attacks on

villages in Maputo province. I heard
numerous reports of South Africa delivering
arms shipments to rebel forces in the Gaza
province just north of the capital following
the signing of the non-aggression pact.
As the elections in the United States were
approaching, it was apparent that the Botha
government feared what would happen if
Democratic candidate Walter Mondale were
given the chance to carry out his pledge of im
posing economic sanctions against South
Africa. Their concern over American disin
vestment initiatives, anti-apartheid campaigns
and legislated economic controls affecting
business with South Africa is extreme. The
South African press paid daily attention to
such initiatives in the United States. A huge
sigh of relief was sounded by the Afrikaaners
when Reagan was re-elected. They an
ticipated four more years of American acqui
escence allowing them to push ahead with

brutal enforcement of the "homelands" pro
gram and aggression toward neighboring
countries. But Americans are waking up to
the vast difference between the rhetoric and
the reality of what this administration's south
ern African policy has achieved. Grassroots
anti-apartheid activity has stirred public
awareness and placed tremendous pressure
on our government to toughen its stand
against apartheid. In an open letter sent to the
South African ambassador a few weeks ago,
35 conservative House Republicans
threatened to support economic sanctions
against Pretoria unless it moved "aggressively
toward real human rights reforms."
The recent violence and crackdown on dis
senters in South Africa clearly signals the fail
ure of American quiet diplomacy to reform
the apartheid system. The white regime's
police-state crackdown on dissenters is the
worst in almost a decade. The South African
military has assumed a larger role than ever in
crushing domestic dissent. Those being
detained and arrested are mainly advocates of
non-violent change. The Botha government
seems set on destroying the United Demo
cratic Front (UDF), a multiracial coalition ur
ging non-violent change. Of course this will
only force the UDF to go underground and
adopt more extreme measures to bring about
a more just society in South Africa. If the
United States is to support real change in
South Africa — the abandonment of the
genocidal "homelands policy" and the incor
poration of blacks into an acceptable political
dispensation — than it must move toward in
voking economic sanctions and political pres
sure on the apartheid strategists.
