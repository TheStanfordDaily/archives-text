## A 						golden age of arms control 
### 
No one can be sure what shall transpire in those
smoke-filled rooms in Geneva when George
Schultz and Andrei Gromyko meet again to talk
arms control. But the mere fact that they are
talking in earnest represents yet another
philosophical victory for those who prefer the con
servative approach to arms control. Even as those
in the Mondale camp were sorrowfully shaking
their heads, lambasting President Reagan for being
anti-arms control, administration officials were ar
ranging the Geneva discussions. Naturally, the
Soviets had to be assured that no announcement
would be made prior to the election. Fortunately,
Reagan needed neither their help nor their en
dorsement.
We may be witnessing a return to the golden age
of arms control that has been fading into the misty
past since the Kissinger-Nixon SALT agreement.
That pact, which limited ABMs (anti-ballistic
missiles), is the only substantive agreement still in
effect today. Notably, it was wrought by an icy-cold
warrior president: Richard Nixon. Though Nixon's
•handling of Watergate was disastrous, few political
■observers can help bufconcede that he had an un
paralleled grasp of world politics. It wasn't until
Nixon pushed funding for an ABM system through
Congress that the Soviets mysteriously reversed
.their position by agreeing to negotiate on their
Already-constructed ABM defense. Only after they
realized that the American Congress had the will to
go through with ABM construction did they agree
to discuss such systems. Why should they make
■•concessions at a negotiating table when peace
•groups or congressional pressure could achieve the
-same results for free? Incentive is the name of the
■game.
True to his idealistic rhetoric. Carter returned to
"a policy of appeasement. Unilaterally scrapping the
B-l bomber as a "good will" gesture elicited no
corresponding demonstration of solidarity from the
Kremlin. SALT II is typical of the kind of arms
control agreement concluded in such an environ
ment. We had little to give away, and the Soviets
had an incentive to wait for mounting public pres
sure to inspire more acts of American restraint.
The limiting levels set in SALT 1 1 were so high that
no strategic missiles needed to be dismantled on
either side. The faulty premise underlying SALT II
was that a meaningless agreement was better than
no agreement whatsoever. Perhaps the illusion ot

arms control would help Jimmy in his re-election
bid.
Finally, Reagan has convinced the Kremlin by
word and deed that stalling will reap no more
rewards. The White House push for the D-5
missile, the B-lb bomber and for research and de
velopment on ASATs (anti-satellite weapons), SDI
(Strategic Defense Initiative) and other sundry
"Star Wars" schemes has provided the United
States with some bargaining leverage.
Last June, the Department of Defense con
ducted its first successful space ABM test, hitting
"a bullet with a bullet." The next day, Chernenko
suggested discussing such weapons. Not until after

are talking in earnest
represents yet another
philosophical victory for
those who prefer the
conservative approach to
arms control.

the election did they accept Reagan's insistence on
broadening the scope of such a discussion to in
clude a wide range of nuclear goodies.
That which tipped the scale and brought Kremlin
leaders to Geneva was the specter of SDI. Last
summer in Political Science 138 A, Sidney Drell told
me that erecting an impregnable space-based ABM
defense would be prohibitively expensive, tech
nologically impossible and in violation of SALT I.
A few well-placed nuclear blasts could blind or dis
arm tracking satellites, blinding the system. No
need for more Soviet ICBMs to overwhelm it
either; cheap decoy warheads could saturate any
reasonable system. By Newton's Second law, shiny
decoys look to satellite eyes just like real missiles.
With obstacles such as these, Reagan's goal of ren
dering nuclear weapons and obsolete"

through SDI seems a starry-eyed dream (no pun in
tended). From this perspective, the DoD "victory"
this past June of hitting a bullet with a bullet is as
much a success as a hunter shooting a caged turkey.
As we say back in North Dakota, "there's still a
long row to hoe."
Ironically, the SDI vision is apparently the issue
about which the Soviet leaders are most concerned.
What can we make of this? My uninformed con
jecture in the dark is this: A limited SDI to protect
a missile field or an NCA (National Command Au
thority) is both economically feasible and tech
nologically possible. This would undermine the
first-strike capability which Moscow seeks. West
ern technological prowess could frustrate Soviet
hopes to win a Star Wars defense arms race.
Adding to Moscow's bargaining incentive are
other aspects of the Star Wars program, such as
ASAT weaponry. Though the Soviet's Cosmos kil
ler satellite performed the world's first successful
satellite murder, America's more versatile 18-foot
ASAT missile is faster and can be launched from an
F-15. Still, ASAT technology is in its infancy. More
crucial satellites, such as those mediating communi
cations between submarines and command centers,
are not yet imperiled. But since ASA Is can be
small and easily concealed, it is best to limit themin
the testing stages, before they threaten high-orbit
satellites. In the next few years, we shall probably
witness some sort of ASAT testing agreement.
Depending upon how serious the Kremlin is
about stopping the arms race, historians will refer
to Reagan's second term as the best of times or as
the worst of times. But the time is now ripe for
agreement. Moscow is surprised and intimidated by
Reagan's staying power. It is convinced that neither
public pressure nor congressional pressure will
bring it free, unilateral concessions. Placement of
the Pershing 2s were sufficient proof of that.
Despite his characteristic rhetoric, I believe that
Reagan will agree to negotiate on SDI if the Soviets
show some flexibility on issues which concern us,
such as their powerful, highly MIRVed (i.e., lots of
warheads per missile) land-based missiles. Regard
ing a final pact-, only one thing is certain: With
Reagan at the helm, there will either be a sub
stantive agreement or there will be no agreement at
all.

That which tipped the scale and brought Kremlin

this past June of hitting a bullet with a bullet is as
much a success as a hunter shooting a caged turkey.
As we say back in North Dakota, "there's still a
long row to hoe."
Ironically, the SDI vision is apparently the issue
about which the Soviet leaders are most concerned.
What can we make of this? My uninformed con
jecture in the dark is this: A limited SDI to protect
a missile field or an NCA (National Command Au
thority) is both economically feasible and tech
nologically possible. This would undermine the
first-strike capability which Moscow seeks. West
ern technological prowess could frustrate Soviet
hopes to win a Star Wars defense arms race.
Adding to Moscow's bargaining incentive are
other aspects of the Star Wars program, such as
ASAT weaponry. Though the Soviet's Cosmos kil
ler satellite performed the world's first successful
satellite murder, America's more versatile 18-foot
ASAT missile is faster and can be launched from an
F-15. Still, ASAT technology is in its infancy. More
crucial satellites, such as those mediating communi
cations between submarines and command centers,
are not yet imperiled. But since ASA Is can be
small and easily concealed, it is best to limit themin
the testing stages, before they threaten high-orbit
satellites. In the next few years, we shall probably
witness some sort of ASAT testing agreement.
Depending upon how serious the Kremlin is
about stopping the arms race, historians will refer
to Reagan's second term as the best of times or as
the worst of times. But the time is now ripe for
agreement. Moscow is surprised and intimidated by
Reagan's staying power. It is convinced that neither
public pressure nor congressional pressure will
bring it free, unilateral concessions. Placement of
the Pershing 2s were sufficient proof of that.
Despite his characteristic rhetoric, I believe that
Reagan will agree to negotiate on SDI if the Soviets
show some flexibility on issues which concern us,
such as their powerful, highly MIRVed (i.e., lots of
warheads per missile) land-based missiles. Regard
ing a final pact-, only one thing is certain: With
Reagan at the helm, there will either be a sub
stantive agreement or there will be no agreement at
all.

No one can be sure what shall transpire in those
smoke-filled rooms in Geneva when George
Schultz and Andrei Gromyko meet again to talk
arms control. But the mere fact that they are
talking in earnest represents yet another
philosophical victory for those who prefer the con
servative approach to arms control. Even as those
in the Mondale camp were sorrowfully shaking
their heads, lambasting President Reagan for being
anti-arms control, administration officials were ar
ranging the Geneva discussions. Naturally, the
Soviets had to be assured that no announcement
would be made prior to the election. Fortunately,
Reagan needed neither their help nor their en
dorsement.
We may be witnessing a return to the golden age
of arms control that has been fading into the misty
past since the Kissinger-Nixon SALT agreement.
That pact, which limited ABMs (anti-ballistic
missiles), is the only substantive agreement still in
effect today. Notably, it was wrought by an icy-cold
warrior president: Richard Nixon. Though Nixon's
•handling of Watergate was disastrous, few political
■observers can help bufconcede that he had an un
paralleled grasp of world politics. It wasn't until
Nixon pushed funding for an ABM system through
Congress that the Soviets mysteriously reversed
