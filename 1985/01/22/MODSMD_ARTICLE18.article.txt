Fans of all kinds at the scene of Sunday's Super Bowl at
Stanford Stadium tried to cash in on the flow of tourism
and trade in and around the celebrated sports event.
Some Stanford students, for example, spent much of
Sunday trying to separate visitors from the money in their
pocketbooks. A pair of students, for example, dressed up
as the star quarterbacks — Joe Montana and Dan Marino
— of the opposing teams. They set up a station in the
stadium parking lot and charged fans $2 to have their
pictures taken with the star player of the 49ers and the
Dolphins.
Another student money-making venture didn't work
out quite as its organizers had expected, however. A
group of University student tour guides set up a table in
front of the clock tower and offered tours of the campus,
but the turnout was far below their expectations.
"It was a joke. There weren't very many people on

campus, and they just weren't interested in seeing Stan
ford," said junior Janelle London, one of the guides. "We
didn't plan on the people having such a Super Bowl men
tality.
The guides showed a combined total of about 15 people
around campus in the span of three hours. According to
London, the five guides made about $5 each, "after ex
penses." The Department of Public Services sanctioned
the tours, but did not deem them official Super Bowl Uni
versity tours.
Back at the stadium, other aficionados cashed in on the
media's overzealousness in getting photos of every aspect
of the event. One fan caught a photographer snapping a
picture of him and snapped back, "That'll cost you $5."
There was another kind of money-maker at the
stadium: the recycling buff. At least one man was spotted
walking around the stadium during the game, depositing
empty beer cans into a huge plastic trash bag slung over
his shoulder.
