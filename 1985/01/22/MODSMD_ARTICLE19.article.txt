## Super Bowl holds no magic 
### SUSAN HARRINGTON 
A double row of tour buses ringed
the Oval. Overhead, the blimps sailed
past, obscuring the sky-written ads
for Lite Beer.
At Stanford Stadium, thousands
watched as modern-day gladiators
slugged it out at the Super Bowl. Mil
lions watched the show on television.
Everybody, it seemed, was con
centrating on the showdown.
Still, there were other forms of life
on campus. There were 48 bicycles
parked outside Green Library and 30
around Meyer.
"My parents visited this weekend
and I didn't get much work done,"
said one harried student as he leapt
on his bicycle. "I'm going to watch
TV now," he said as he sped away.
"I follow college football," said an
other, a business student. "I'm doing
my cost accounting."
At the post office, another
graduate student explained earnestly
that her first love is soccer. "I haven't
been paying much attention to the
game. But I can see the excitement
around me," she continued. "It's very
nice when the world comes to you."
A handful of people strolled across
White Plaza, where a lone
cameraman stood hunched against
the cold with his camera trained on
the Claw.
"I've been here since six o'clock,"
the cameraman said, disgustedly.
"The only shot they showed was
about 15 seconds." That scene aired
at 1:15 p.m. Atmosphere shots
weren't high on ABC's list of
priorities.
At Tresidder, a half-dozen or so
students huddled over their books.
Three young women sat at a booth
near the Corner Pocket, where a TV,
tuned to the game, blared.

"We're not watching because we
don't understand football," one of
them laughed. "We're from another
country."
They were from Denmark, Sweden
and Belgium. "If we knew what was
going on, we would be watching,"
one continued. "Do you know the
score?"
Nearby, a middle-aged couple sat
with a scattered Sunday newspaper
before them. "I'm not interested in
football," said the man. "I was
reading a funny article by someone
here about Nobel prize winners," he
said, shuffling the newspaper. "I was
pleased to find that none of them is
interested either."
But the couple said they had driven
from Los Gatos to be on campus
during the game. "So we can be
around campus and be in the big
crowd," the woman said. "Lots of
people, lots of fun."
Two students sat at computer ter
minals in the Center for Education
and Research at Stanford building.
One was reading a novel. "Not that
I have anything against football â€”
I'm just not interested in it,"he said.
"I get all excited about things that
other people couldn't care less about.
I watched the figure skating nation
als."
Back at Tresidder, five video-game
diehards chased electronic critters in
the arcade.
Iwo students scanned the listings
on the Tresidder information board.
"Its halftime," one explained.
Outside, tule fog was already
beginning to rise from the patch of
seeded lawn near the Claw. Away
from the generators, away from the
lights and circling dirigibles, it was
quiet.
The cameraman still sat, waiting.
