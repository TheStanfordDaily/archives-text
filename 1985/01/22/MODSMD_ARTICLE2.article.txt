## Stanford debates future Bowl bids 
### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
As ecstatic fans turned to the streets to
celebrate the 49ers' victory Sunday, Stanford
administrators turned their thoughts to a ques
tion that, for many, looms larger than mere
football: Will Stanford host another Super
Bowl?
"We're going to have to take a long look at it
before we decide it's something we ought to

repeat," University President Donald Kennedy
said after the game.
Like a football coach, Kennedy joked that he
wouldn't know "until I've looked at the films."
Kennedy, echoing the criticisms of those who
have questioned Stanford's role in a non
academic venture of this size, voiced concern
over how Super Bowl XIX drained University
personnel and resources.
"You've got to ask yourself how often an in
stitution, whose chief business is something else,
can afford that kind of diversion of talent and
energy," Kennedy said in a statement. "What
nobody can understand is how much time and
effort it took on the part of our key people."
San Francisco is among 14 cities that are
being considered for the 1989 and 1990 Super
Bowl games, according to Delia Schletter, exec
utive director of the Bay Area Super Bowl Task
Force. If the game is awarded to San Francisco,
it will be played at Stanford Stadium.
Schletter said last week that a team of repre
sentatives from the Bay Area — including Andy
Geiger, Stanford director of athletics, Quentin
Kopp, San Francisco supervisor and chairman
of the Super Bowl Task Force, and George
Kirkland, director of San Francisco's Conven
tion and Visitors Bureau — flew to Washington,
D C. last May to submit a bid for a future Super
Bowl.
"Geiger stated willingness to go in for an-,
other one," Schletter said.

But Geiger maintains that Stanford has made
no commitment to a future game.
"They (the NFL) have the option to come
back under the same terms if we all agree," he
said before the game. "And if everything goes
well, we would be interested in having them
back."
Geiger said Sunday he expects to "talk to the
NFL" about the prospects of Stanford hosting
another game.
The NFL Owners Association will meet in
March to decide which cities will host the event
in 1989 and 1990 — Super Bowls XXIII and
XXIV. New Orleans, San Diego and Pasadena
will host the 1986, 1987 and 1988 Super Bowls,
respectively.
If Kennedy and Geiger give the green light,
Stanford would be in the running for the 1989
and 1990 games. But Geiger said because the
game is already scheduled to be played twice in
California before then, the Super Bowl prob
ably will not return to Northern California until
1991 at the earliest.
"We would prefer 1991," he said last week.
"It's our centennial year."
Schletter agreed that Stanford's 100 th an
niversary "might be another excuse for a Super
Bowl."
Both Geiger and Alan Cummings, associate
athletic director and Stanford's chief planner for
Super Bowl XIX, said the event went quite
smoothly from an organizational standpoint.
"From all reports, most everything went
well," Geiger said on Sunday.
Cummings, like Kennedy, said he wants to
study the impact of the game before judging
whether Stanford should host another one.
Whatever his conclusions, "the decision rests
with Kennedy and Geiger," he said.
And if Super Bowl XXV should be awarded
to Stanford?
"If the opportunity comes again, I think we
can do an even better job," Cummings said.
The idea of playing a Super Bowl in the same
place more than once isn't new. Miami has
hosted the game five times, and so has New Or
leans. In the Los Angeles area, teams have
fought it out in Memorial Collesium and the
Rose Bowl half a dozen times.
Still, Rice University in Houston, site of the
1974 Super Bowl, is the only other university to
host the big game.
