# Pregame: It's a war out there
## 
### TIM GRIEVE Daily staff 
As a squadron of helicopters circled overhead in
a haze of clouds, fog and barbecue smoke, a cold
and harried Super Bowl fan grumbled, "Jesus, this
looks like 'Apocalypse Now.' "
Stanford Stadium was a war zone Sunday morn
ing. Limousine chauffeurs vied with bus, cab and
car drivers to deploy their charges closest to the ac
tion. Corporations battled one another over who
could provide the most extravagant white-tent tail
gater. And the infantrymen of the operation, the
85,000 or so fans who had managed to get tickets,
climbed over limousines, dodged golf carts and
fought to stay connected with their friends and
family as they struggled as long as 35 minutes to
cover the 200 yards between stadium gates.
The advance troops who had arrived Saturday
night to camp out in their Winnebagos wandered
around the stadium Sunday morning, bleary-eyed
and stumbling, looking for some way to keep warm
and express their football feelings at the same time.
One group of unshaven revelers hoisted a dirty
stuffed dolphin on a pitchfork and waved it
precariously through the crowds. Another one of
the 49er faithful carried a sign: "Save the Whales.
Who Cares about the Dolphins?"
One group of fans who traveled to Stanford from
Florida certainly cared about the visiting team.
When one was asked if he thought the Dolphins
would win the game, he responded "It's like
knowing the sun will come up in the morning."
That the sun hadn't managed to peek through
the fog yet Sunday didn't seem to bother him.

But it did bother Tom Heffold, a physician who
came all the way from Ft. Lauderdale. "We
were guaranteed sunshine," he complained. "The
Super Bowl should be held in Miami, in the sun
shine, where God intended it to be."
Nevertheless, the Lord's self-appointed represen
tatives did manage to find their way to Palo Alto.
"Jesus saves sinners from Hell," said a sign near El
Camino Real as a bearded man shouted sermons
through a megaphone to an unresponsive crowd.
Shouting was the order of the day Sunday morn
ing. Wives shouting for their husbands lost in the
crowds. A man shouting about the steep price of
fresh-squeezed orange juice. Policemen shouting at
drivers headed the wrong way. Drunken fans
shouting "Go Niners." And hundreds of teenagers
shouting "souvenir programs."
The $5 glossy "Super Bowl by the Bay" pro
grams were hot items, but not for one mother, who
told her begging son, "There's so much stuff in the
newspapers . . . you can't read it all."
Inside the tailgaters— a far cry from the typical
six-pack and hoagie in the trunk of the Pontiac —
life was a little more sedate. In the Ford Motor Co.
tent, Gladys Knight and the Pips doo-wopped to
the crowd's delight. At the Arthur Anderson party,
the Stanford Band belted out, "White Punks on
Dope" for a crowd well-heeled and old enough that
it was probably better they didn't understand the
song they were hearing. And near the Franklin
Funds shindig, a few people were entertained by
the wheezing tones from a pipe organ mounted on
a paint-peeling antique Seagraves fire engine.
Inside the Nissan tent, well-dressed football fans

ambled through a forest of shipped-in trees and
twinkle-lights. And at the National Football
League bash behind Maples Pavilion, guests were
handed a cocktail as they walked in the door.
The hired help managed to get into the fun, too.
In Chuck Taylor Grove, a group of chefs watched
the pre-game show on a portable TV plugged into
the cigarette lighter in an aquamarine Jaguar
coupe.
Meanwhile, on the other side of Angell Field,
four fans grumbled that they never found their
proper tailgater on Welch Road. They figured their
friends had parked illegally, and the whole party
had been towed away. "They're probably having
the tailgater at the police department," said Ernie
Bloomfield as he ate bagels and lox from a par
course balance beam his group used as a makeshift
buffet table.
Hundreds of students joined the throngs around
the stadium Sunday; most didn't have tickets, but
came to watch the crowds and sneak into tailgaters
anyway.
Senior Kevin Rosenstein said he went to the
stadium "to study the sociological question of why
these people come for a football game."
Communication Prof. Marion Lewenstein was
more frank. "I'm just here rubbernecking," she
said.
But the real answer probably came from a group
of Stanford-sweatshirt-clad students. "We wanted
to say 'hi' to Mom on TV," one of them said. "And
it's not working."

friends had parked illegally, and the whole party
had been towed away. "They're probably having
the tailgater at the police department," said Ernie
Bloomfield as he ate bagels and lox from a par
course balance beam his group used as a makeshift
buffet table.
Hundreds of students joined the throngs around
the stadium Sunday; most didn't have tickets, but
came to watch the crowds and sneak into tailgaters
anyway.
Senior Kevin Rosenstein said he went to the
stadium "to study the sociological question of why
these people come for a football game."
Communication Prof. Marion Lewenstein was
more frank. "I'm just here rubbernecking," she
said.
But the real answer probably came from a group
of Stanford-sweatshirt-clad students. "We wanted
to say 'hi' to Mom on TV," one of them said. "And
it's not working."

As a squadron of helicopters circled overhead in
a haze of clouds, fog and barbecue smoke, a cold
and harried Super Bowl fan grumbled, "Jesus, this
looks like 'Apocalypse Now.' "
Stanford Stadium was a war zone Sunday morn
ing. Limousine chauffeurs vied with bus, cab and
car drivers to deploy their charges closest to the ac
tion. Corporations battled one another over who
could provide the most extravagant white-tent tail
gater. And the infantrymen of the operation, the
85,000 or so fans who had managed to get tickets,
climbed over limousines, dodged golf carts and
fought to stay connected with their friends and
family as they struggled as long as 35 minutes to
cover the 200 yards between stadium gates.
The advance troops who had arrived Saturday
night to camp out in their Winnebagos wandered
around the stadium Sunday morning, bleary-eyed
and stumbling, looking for some way to keep warm
and express their football feelings at the same time.
One group of unshaven revelers hoisted a dirty
stuffed dolphin on a pitchfork and waved it
precariously through the crowds. Another one of
the 49er faithful carried a sign: "Save the Whales.
Who Cares about the Dolphins?"
One group of fans who traveled to Stanford from
Florida certainly cared about the visiting team.
When one was asked if he thought the Dolphins
would win the game, he responded "It's like
knowing the sun will come up in the morning."
That the sun hadn't managed to peek through
the fog yet Sunday didn't seem to bother him.

But it did bother Tom Heffold, a physician who
came all the way from Ft. Lauderdale. "We
were guaranteed sunshine," he complained. "The
Super Bowl should be held in Miami, in the sun
shine, where God intended it to be."
Nevertheless, the Lord's self-appointed represen
tatives did manage to find their way to Palo Alto.
"Jesus saves sinners from Hell," said a sign near El
Camino Real as a bearded man shouted sermons
through a megaphone to an unresponsive crowd.
Shouting was the order of the day Sunday morn
ing. Wives shouting for their husbands lost in the
crowds. A man shouting about the steep price of
fresh-squeezed orange juice. Policemen shouting at
drivers headed the wrong way. Drunken fans
shouting "Go Niners." And hundreds of teenagers
shouting "souvenir programs."
The $5 glossy "Super Bowl by the Bay" pro
grams were hot items, but not for one mother, who
told her begging son, "There's so much stuff in the
newspapers . . . you can't read it all."
Inside the tailgaters— a far cry from the typical
six-pack and hoagie in the trunk of the Pontiac —
life was a little more sedate. In the Ford Motor Co.
tent, Gladys Knight and the Pips doo-wopped to
the crowd's delight. At the Arthur Anderson party,
the Stanford Band belted out, "White Punks on
Dope" for a crowd well-heeled and old enough that
it was probably better they didn't understand the
song they were hearing. And near the Franklin
Funds shindig, a few people were entertained by
the wheezing tones from a pipe organ mounted on
a paint-peeling antique Seagraves fire engine.
Inside the Nissan tent, well-dressed football fans

ambled through a forest of shipped-in trees and
twinkle-lights. And at the National Football
League bash behind Maples Pavilion, guests were
handed a cocktail as they walked in the door.
The hired help managed to get into the fun, too.
In Chuck Taylor Grove, a group of chefs watched
the pre-game show on a portable TV plugged into
the cigarette lighter in an aquamarine Jaguar
coupe.
Meanwhile, on the other side of Angell Field,
four fans grumbled that they never found their
proper tailgater on Welch Road. They figured their
friends had parked illegally, and the whole party
had been towed away. "They're probably having
the tailgater at the police department," said Ernie
Bloomfield as he ate bagels and lox from a par
course balance beam his group used as a makeshift
buffet table.
