# Students work at Bowl for fun, profit

### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
While most Stanford students
watched the Super Bowl on televison
from the confines of a dorm living
room, a few students managed to
watch at least part of the game in per
son while working at the stadium as
paid staff or volunteers.
Senior Derek Passarelli, working as
a special events patrol officer for the
Stanford Police Department, said
that although he was busy during
much of the game "the spectacle
made it all worthwhile."
"If you had the opportunity to go,
you couldn't miss it because, simply
because it is the Super Bowl," he
said.

Passarelli worked outside the
stadium before the game, directing
people who had been pickpocketed to
the NFL office outside the stadium.
Fans could buy a replacement ticket
for the $60 face value from the NFL
if they had the numbers of the stolen
or lost tickets, he said.
Passarelli also worked inside the
stadium "almost like free-lance se
curity. It allowed me to go all over the
stadium and go wherever they needed
me."
Senior Caryl Lazzaro also worked
for the police, checking credentials of
writers and broadcasters as they en
tered the press box. "I got to see the
announcers and 1 talked with Tom
Landry and Edwin Moses," she said.

adding that Moses was particularly
nice.
Lazzaro said she "got to see pretty
much of the game," noting that the
fans were "generally well-behaved."
Lazzaro also attended a party
thrown after the game by the Athletic
Department in Maples Pavilion,
featuring music, sandwiches and beer.
"It was nice of them to make the ef
fort," she said. "They didn't have to
do it."
Sophomore John Latting was one
of 70 members of the men's and
women's crew teams who worked the
game as part of a deal arranged be
tween the Athletic Department and
the crew team. He said each team was
paid $1,000.

Latting worked as a ticket-taker at
the stadium and managed to see only
"about 10 plays of the game."
He said other students got to see as
much as three quarters of the game.
"You could see it if you really wanted
to. I just didn't really try to much," he
said.
For Latting the events and people
surrounding the Super Bowl proved
to be more of an attraction than the
game itself. "The party was fun, and I
got to see a lot of famous people," he
said.
Like all student volunteers, Latting
also received a nylon Adidas
windbreaker, bearing the Super Bowl
logo on the back and the word "staff'
on the front.
