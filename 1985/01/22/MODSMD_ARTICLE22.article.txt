Fans leaving Stanford Stadium
after Sunday's Super Bowl may not
have had booze on their breath, but
some had a few things to say about
the University's alcohol policy and
the spirit of the game in general.
"It was a very nice crowd," accord
ing to Redwood City resident Don
Wilkes, an eight-year San Francisco
49ers season ticket holder.
"It wasn't out of hand, although
the stadium seats are narrow. It's
good that they didn't have alcohol.
Unlike Candlestick (Park), with these
narrow seats there would be prob
lems in here."
Bill Riach, a fan who flew in from
Phoenix, said almost the same thing.
"I had a great time," Riach said. " I
thought [the crowd] behaved. . . .

Keeping liquor out of the stadium
was the big difference."
Other boosters, like John and Lee
Arib of Ft. Lauderdale, Fla. stressed
the intra-stadium civility between
champions of both teams.
"There was no rowdiness and 9 Ipt
of camaraderie. People were qoftr
gratulating each other whether they
won or lost."
And while Dolphins fans wgre
compelled to offer their congratula
tions over the roar of their San Fran
cisco counterparts, they kept on
cheering. M
"We (Miami) are very vocal fans
and we're used to a lot of noise in the
Orange Bowl," Lee Arbib said.
But to others, the very fact that
Dolphins fans would come all the way
across a continent to cheer their team
was exciting.
