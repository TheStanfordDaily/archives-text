The real thing was just a few yards — and a ticket — away


Dean of Residential Education Norm Robinson
was ready to greet guests as they entered the
stadium.


Like many Stanford students, Erin Martin from the Women's Crew Team took tick
ets at the gate, and got to keep a Super Bowl jacket for her trouble.


A Hoover Tower-based ABC camera crew shot Hurlburt residents Jon Mann, Lome Needle, Gregg Dierke, Eileen Van
dewetering, Joe Alzpuru and John Van Loben Sets into national prominence.


California Governor George Deukmejian may have had 50-yard-line seats, but he might never have found
them without Stanford quarterback Fred Buckley (left) and Golf Team captain Cole Thompson, who served
as ushers during the game.


To 49ers coach Bill Walsh, winning the Vince Lombardi trophy was the only- thing) to do on Sunday afternoon


It was the fifth-largest Super Bowl crowd ever, and the largest evei'outside of Los Angeles.


Some people sold their tickets for $1500, but he wouldn't trade his for
the world.


These dancers may not have been F-15s, but they did their best to go on with the half time show
— and to cheer their team on to victory.


Sigma Chis were on hand to welcome an estimated 60 million television viewers to the Farm


By Saturday, everybody wanted a glimpse at the goings-on in
Stanford Stadium.


Nobody wanted the goal posts anyway


For some 49ers fans, a good time meant sitting atop a pickup truck in downtown San Francisco during the post
game rally.
