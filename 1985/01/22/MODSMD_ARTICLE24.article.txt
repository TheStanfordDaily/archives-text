## No Super exposure 
### 
1:30 p.m.. Super Bowl Sunday.
And where am I? Rushing to beat
the traffic I anticipated, but found
didn't exist, en route to Stanford
Stadium for the NFL's event of the
year (read. The Big Hype).
1 park between Toyon and
Branner and start running toward
the stadium, knowing the crowd
I'd encounter would be worse than
the teenager section at a Van
Halen concert. By the time 1 make
it to the parking lot across the
street from Maples Pavilion, the
crush of humanity either hasn't
arrived or has beaten me to its col
lective detachable cushion inside
the stadium.
Then I saw one of the large,
white tents that housed one of the
corporate tailgaters and its guests.
My immediate, cynical thought
was how ironic it was that the
Stanford basketball team, which
inhabits Maples Pavilion for home
games through the winter, doesn't
get that kind of attention — and
the tents were but a few feet from
the pavilion.
I eventually got to the game —
after finding a mob scene large
enough to confirm my previous
expectations — but I'm not going
to regurgitate what the other local
publications have undoubtedly
saturated you with since San Fran
cisco soundly defeated Miami
Sunday.
In fact, let's talk a little basket
ball — but we won't forget about
the Super Bowl just yet.
With a glance at the Stanford
men's basketball team's schedule,
you'd think Coach Tom Davis and
the Cardinal intelligent to get out
of Dodge by sundown before the
weekend. Hey, people are pop
ping onto campus from the City,
Miami, and all points in between
to watch what was supposed to be
the Super Bowl's greatest
matchup. The fatcats were worried
not about a ball bouncing in a
gymnasium, but about point
spreads and the over-under.
Sure enough, Stanford played
on the road against the University
of California at Berkeley Saturday
after defeating the University of
Arizona Jan. 12 and not having to
play during the all-important
Super Bowl Hype Week.
But, believe it or not, the Card
inal's plan, which seemed sensible
and obvious at first, previously

had a different — no. opposite —
flavor. Something along the lines
of "Get a Piece of the Action,"
Davis style.
Davis originally wanted to ar
range Stanford's schedule so the
Cardinal would play host to Cal.
"See, we wanted to play here,"
Davis said. "We worked really
hard to try and get a TV game —
to get CBS or somebody to put
this on national television — on
Saturday, the day before the Super
Bowl because it's been done.
"There will be a game on Super
Bowl Sunday and Super Bowl Sat
urday," Davis said after his team's
55-51 victory over Arizona. "But
we weren't good enough (to be a
team in a nationally televised
matchup). We didn't have enough
good returning players, and they
were really trying to pick just key
national matchups. We're prob
ably a year away.
"So, we did try to schedule a TV
game
Davis said Geiger led the effort
to get the television cameras into
Maples Pavilion as well as at Stan
ford Stadium this weekend.
"Well, Andy — uh Mr. Geiger
— is outstanding. ... He just
finished this whole football
negotiation with the Big Ten
(Conference, which joined the
Pacific 10 Conference in a net
work television football deal ex
clusive to the teams of those con
ferences). ... He researched it
and did a very good job."
That Stanford — its stadium and
its basketball team — was not on
the tube in connection with two
sports during the Super weekend
was probably better in the end, ac
cording to Davis. In other words,
the networks were correct in their
judgment of the Cardinal.
"You know, we'll know when
it's time. We're not ready yet for a
confrontation (against a
recognized, powerful team).
Hopefully it's not too far away."

Notes and quotes from the ABC
Sports compound, where the
Super Bowl coverage was devised
and executed — well, judging by
the reactions I've heard:
Donna DeVarona, after the
game Sunday night, regarding her
important role — interviewing
celebrities at the game: "I just
wanted to make it fun."
