## Niners take a Super victory Verdict in early for 49ers 
### JASON COLE Daily staff 
At the end of the third quarter of
the Super Bowl, the literally
hundreds upon thousands of media
representatives were kindly asked to
gather at the southern end of the
press box if they wanted to go to the
lockerrooms for interviews.
Such procedure is normal in order
to get the reporters to the locker
rooms before the crowd starts to
leave and creates a giant traffic jam.
But on Sunday, that procedure was
more of a telling moment than a
move of convenience. By the time the
announcement was made, the game
was over.
The simple truth is that the San
Francisco 49ers dominated the Miami

Dolphins and the final score, 38-16,
is only a small indicator of how thor
ough that domination was.
As the final minutes of the fourth
quarter started to wind down, the
interview-hungry reporters began to
demand the prescence of Joe Mon
tana, the game's most valuable
player. The cries of "Let Matt
(Cavanaugh, the 49ers' backup quar
terback) finish," were hardly jests,
but real hopes of getting Montana in
for the interview as soon as possible.
The cries started with almost 10
minutes left in the game, despite Dan
Marino, the Miami quarterback who
has the ability to chop up defenses
faster than a moulinex.
The Dolphins' machine-like of
fense was missing a few nuts and bolts
Sunday. More appropriately, the
49ers' defense had tightened the
screws on its machine, allowing only
16 points to a team that had averaged
more than 30 a game and had led the
NFL in scoring with 513 in the regu
lar season.
San Francisco solved what could
have been the greatest puzzle in Na
tional Football League history, "How
do you stop Marino?"
All year, head coaches and defen
sive coordinators had been pouring
over films and chalkboards in an ef
fort to devise some scheme of blitzes
or multiple defensive-back forma
tions that would stop Marino from
gunning them down.
What the 49ers did was a little bit
of everything and a lot of the basics.
Slowly but surely they got closer and
closer to Marino until finally they got
him. Defensive end Dwaine Board
broke through on third down and 11
during the Dolphins' first possession
of the second half.
From then on the rush was on. On
Miami's next possession, nose tackle
Manu Tuiasosopo and Board got to
Marino on consecutive downs to
force a punt. In all, the 49ers got to
Marino four times for 29 yards.
One key to San Francisco's rush
was the ability to wear down the
Miami offensive line. The 49ers did
this by using nine different linemen
and rotating them often.
Another key was the coverage by
the 49er secondary. Simply put, it was
magnificent. Marino was consistently
checking off one receiver and many
times a second, only to find each of
them just a white blur obfuscated by a
bright jersey.
Miami's Marks brothers combo
(Duper and Clayton) went bananas
trying to deal with San Francisco's
defensive manifesto. As *9er corner
back Ronnie Lott explained, "I
thought a couple of times they got
open, but our rush was able to get to
Marino or he just didn't see them."
Lott actually has a tremendous gift
for understatement. His own play was
impeccable, exemplified by a
touchdown-saving defense at the end
of the first half.
On third down and 11 from the
49ers' 13-yard line, there were 20
seconds remaining in the half and the
Dolphins had no timeouts left.
Marino had no choice but to go into
the end zone or else not get any score
at all.
The call was a timing pattern to
Clayton. Marino lobbed to the cor
ner, but Lott had Clayton covered
perfectly as the ball bounced off his
head. "If he can catch one through

my head, he can have it," Lott said
afterward.
For the game, four Miami wide
receivers combined for only 10 recep
tions and 134 yards out of Marino's
29 completions (out of 50 attempt)
and 318 yards. Going into the game,
the wide receivers had been Marino's
favorite targets.
As tough a time as Miami had
throwing the ball, it had an even
tougher time running. Dolphin run
ning backs combined for nine carries
and a paltry 25 total yards gained.
Miami wasn't supposed to be knock
ing any linemen down on the ground,
but it should have done better than
that.
And while Miami was seemingly
running in place, 49er quarterback
Joe Montana was running the Dol
phins into the ground and his team to
perfection.
Montana wouldn't call his perfor
mance perfect when asked to make
his own evaluation, but he admitted it
was probably as close anybody could
come. "I made a couple of mistakes
on those deep patterns to Renaldo
(Nehemiah). On the first one they
said Dwight (Clark) was open and I
didn't see him. On the second one,
Renaldo said I only missed him by a
yard," Montana said.
But even Montana's self
proclaimed mistakes probably
worked to his benefit. Both plays
came on San Francisco's first posses
sion of the second quarter. Both were
deep patterns that kept the Miami de
fensive backs from creeping in to
cheat on the short patterns.

San Francisco was forced to punt,
but it scored easily on its next three
opportunities and made what had
looked to be a back-and-forth, lead
changing hands-with-every
possession type of game, into a 28-10
blowout to be.
Until that time, Miami's defensive
plan was seemingly to buzz but not to
break and hope that Marino could
keep it in the game. But Montana's
performance may have changed the
Killer B's species to Bumble.
On each of San Francisco's first
half touchdowns, Montana broke the
Dolphin's defense with his ability to
scramble and make broken plays into
big gains. In the first quarter, on third
down and seven, he gained 15 after
rolling to the right away from defen
sive tackle Doug Better's rush.
Montana then scored the 49ers'
third touchdown when he decided to
forego a pass to Clark and run nearly
unscathed for six yards.
For his efforts, which included 24
completions in 35 attempts, a
Bowl-record 331 yards passing artd
59 yards rushing on five attempts,
Montana was named the game's
MVP.
In the press tent by the locker
rooms, the press was instructed to
wait in two different spots for inter
views. One was where the coacjh
would speak and the other was where
, the MVP would speak.
The reporters were told this well in
advance of Montana getting the
honor, but in keeping with the style of
i the game the reporters said, "So
bring in Montana now."

The Super Bowl's two MVPs, most valuable player Joe Montana and most valuable pocketbook Eddie
De√üartolo Jr., the owner of the 49ers, met on the sidelines in celebratiop as the final outcome became clear.


Miami quarterback Dan Marino hadn't been in this position very often
during the season, but San Francisco changed that situation on Sunday.

Rod Searcey/Daily
Gary "Big Hands" Johnson, who got one of the four 49er sacks, ap
plied the pressure here just as Marino released.


Rod Searcey/Daily
It was nothing but anger and frustration for Glenn Blackwood ana
teammates on the Dolphin's defense, which couldn't stop the fast
moving 49ers' offense.
