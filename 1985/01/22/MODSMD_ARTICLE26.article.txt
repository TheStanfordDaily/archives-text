# Men drop into last-place tie
## Card shoots itself down 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
' Basketball's version of the Big
; Game, played on the eve of Super
; Bowl XIX, seemed more like a
rehearsal for the National Football
League's title game than a matchup
between traditional rivals.
As the host team, the University of
California at Berkeley played the role
of the San Francisco 49ers while the
visitors, Stanford in this case, got
Miami's script. Both teams played
their roles to perfection before a near
sellout crowd in 6,656-seat Harmon
Gymnasium. Cal won big and, like
Miami, Stanford took a beating. The
final score was 87-72.
"We were outplayed," said Stan
ford Coach Tom Davis, whose
postgame comments were similar to
Miami Coach Don Shula's after the
Super Bowl. "They just outplayed us
very, very clearly. I thought they
played about as well as you can ask a
team to play."
Cardinal guard Keith Ramee, who
led Stanford with 19 points, simply
shook his head and said, "I'm just
baffled. I don't know what happened.
They took it to us."
As far as the rest of the Pacific 10
Conference was concerned, though,
Saturday's Big Game was anything
but that. The outcome left both Stan
ford and Cal at 9-6 overall, 1-4 in the
conference and tied for last place.

It was a game both teams needed to
win desperately, but maybe the Bears
a little more desperately than the
Cardinal. "We've always played
teams that had better players and tal
ent," Ramee said. "But tonight they
had desire, too. I think they wanted it
more."
Now Stanford takes its 1-6 road
record south to UCLA, where it
hasn't won since 1951, and to second
place University of Southern Califor
nia. Had the Cardinal defeated its
rival, a split against the Los Angeles
schools would have put it back in the
Pac-1() race. Instead, a split might not
even get it out of the conference cel
lar.
Not only was the game big, it also
was long. Although it wasn't
televised, it lasted upwards of two
and-one-half hours, thanks to a total
of 73 fouls and 86 free throws that
made it drag on like a bad opera.
As Cal Coach Dick Kuchen said,
"If a guy ordered out for a pizza with
three minutes to go, it would have
been cold when he picked it up. I
thought we'd be here until halftime of
the Super Bowl (the next day)."
Statistically, Stanford's problems
against Cal were no different than in
its other three Pac-10 losses, also all
double-figure defeats. The Cardinal
shot poorly. Period.
For the second straight game, Stan
ford shot under 34 percent from the

floor. And its 33.8 percent figure (23-
for-68) Saturday night moved it un
der 40 percent in Pac-10 games —
the worst in the league. The Cardinal
was just as had from the free throw
line, especially in the second half,
when it was 13-of-23 (56.5 percent).
Cal, meanwhile, seemingly couldn't
miss. The Bears took 27 fewer shots
than Stanford and made one more,
shooting 58.5 percent (24-for-41).
They also shot 83 percent (39-for-46)
from the line, setting a school record
for most free throws made in a game.
About the only statistical category
that told a different story than the
scoreboard was rebounding. Some
how, Stanford outrebounded the
Bears 44-32 overall and an almost in
comprehensible 31-10 on the offen
sive boards. But the Cardinal's shoot
ing woes, even from short range, ef
fectively eliminated its lopsided
rebounding advantage.
Like Miami in Sunday's Super
Bowl, Stanford did have its chances.
Midway through the second half,
Ramee out of the blue took control of
the game for a few minutes and
scored seven straight points to cut a
13-point Cal lead to 56-49 with 7
minutes and 55 seconds remaining.
Stanford then proceeded to miss
three straight free throws, the latter
two front ends of one-and-ones, that
would have brought it even closer to
the Bears. Finally, the Bears were

able to hold onto the ball and regain
hold of the game.
After Jeff Thilgen, one of only two
seniors on Cal's roster, hit a pair of
tree throws, it was freshman Leonard
Taylor's turn to take over the game.
Taylor, who scored all 16 of his points
in the second half, tallied Cal's next
six to put the Bears' lead back in
double figures, where it stayed.
"We made a couple of good runs at
them as is the mark of this team,"
Davis said. "But those comebacks al
ways take so much out of you. We
just weren't able to get over the
hump."
The game initially slipped away
from Stanford with 13 minutes left in
the first half. Ahead 9-8, Kuchen
decided to hold the ball and pull the
Cardinal out of its packed-in zone
defense. The spread offense worked,
as the Bears scored 18 of the next 26
points en route to a 37-25 halftime
lead.
"I did not expect them to hold the
ball," Davis said. "I thought they'd
keep attacking us with their speed.
But you can't criticize a strategy that
works."
Cardinal guard John Paye, who
played 33 minutes and scored 13
points, agreed with his coach. "It was
a smart strategy move to pull it out
when they were only up by one," he
said. "It took us out of our game.
When they got ahead, they had two
quick guards that we had to play
man-to-man. And they're good one
on-one players. They would get by
the, player on the top and then get the
foul."
Those two quick guards were
Kevin Johnson and Chris Washing
ton, a high school teammate of
Ramee's. Together, Cal's presidential
backcourt combined for 36 points, 20
of them from the free-throw line.
However, Johnson alone would have
been enough. The sophomore hit 5-

of-7 shots and 13-of-15 free throws
to score a career-high 23 points. He
also had five assists, four steals and a
career-high 14 rebounds.
This was the same Johnson that
didn't even make the trip to the Uni
versity of Washington last Thursday
after suffering a hip pointer against
Arizona State University the previous
Saturday. Asked if his hip bothered
him at all, Johnson replied, "I don't
know. I didn't even think about it."
One player that was bothered by an
injury was Cardinal forward Earl
Koberlein, who has been suffering all

season from a chronic back problerti.
It was so bad Saturday night that be
couldn't sit on the bench when he
came out of the game, which was of
ten.
"Once it tightens up, I can't do
anything about it," said Koberlein.
who had just six points and three
rebounds Saturday before fouling out
with 12:07 remaining in the game.
"Sitting kills it. 1 need rest, but
there's no time to rest. I practice
when I can. My game is a lot of hustle
— I'm not a flashy talent — so it's
frustrating."

Try as he may, Stanford's senior center Kent Seymour couldn't add the necessary inspiration to lead the
Cardinal to victory as Cal won 87-72.


Jill Gilbert/Daily
Freshman Eric Reveno, like most of the Stanford team, had his trouble
shooting against the Bears, going 2-for-8 from the field. The Cardinal's
combined front line hit only seven of 25 shots Saturday night.
