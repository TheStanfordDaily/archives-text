Guard Virginia Sourlis hit a pair of free throws with 14
seconds remaining as the Stanford women's basketball
team played possibly its best game of the season and
defeated Arizona State University, 68-67, last night at
Maples Pavilion.
S.ourlis had earlier given the Cardinal a 66-64 lead on a
driving layup with 33 seconds remaining. The Sun Devils'
Robin Connolly then drew a foul and went to the line with
16 seconds left, but missed her second shot. ASU's Sherry
Poole then fouled Sourlis, who put the game away after
two Sun Devil timeouts. A layup by Poole accounted for
the final points.
"I figured I'd make them when Charli (Turner) came
up to me and said that if I made them, we'd be in first
place," Sourlis said.
Stanford is actually tied for second place in the Western
Collegiate Athletic Association with a 2-1 record. Last
season the Cardinal was 1-13 in the WCAA.
Sourlis was the star of the second half, scoring 17 of her
22 points in the last 20 minutes. The 5-foot-2 guard also
led the Cardinal in rebounding with nine.
Freshman forward Kami Anderson dominated the first
half, hitting nine of 12 shots for 18 points. She also
finished with 22.
"At first they were playing a box-and-one, with the one
on me," Sourlis explained. "In the second half they played
a man-to-man. They had gotten out of the box. When

Kami hit her shots they realized that we have more than
one player they have to stop. We forced them out of it.
"We were setting good screens. It just so happened that
I got my shots," Sourlis said.
Anderson commented on her first-half shooting, "I was
open, and I love taking those shots. It makes the game fun
for me."
The statistics showed that Stanford played an excellent
game. The Cardinal shot 57 percent from the field, out
rebounded ASU, 31-27, and committed only 11 turn
overs, only two of those in the first half. The Cardinal led
at halftime, 37-32.
The most encouraging sign may have been the 15 as
sists, after having had only five last week against Fullerton
State. Sourlis had six and guard Charli Turner had five.
Stanford also used its fast-break offense, which at times
has seemed absent from the Cardinal's game plan. "We
ran the break all the way through," forward Mary
Bradach said. Bradach finished with 12 points.
"More than anything, we were doing what we should
have done all along," she continued. "We haven't run the
ball as well as we did tonight."
After the shouting in the locker room had died down,
there were still smiles among the players and coaches.
"The overall team effort was great," Head Coach Dotty
McCrea said. "We've worked for this so long. Now
it's happening, it's gratifying."
"We've had a couple of close games now. I think it's all
coming together," Sourlis said.
