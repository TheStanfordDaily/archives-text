### ERIK ESELIUS Staff sportswriter 
Representing the first West
Coast team to fence Big Ten Con
ference opponents, the Stanford
men's and women's fencing teams
finished the round-robin series at
Northwestern University with 5-1
and 4-1 records, respectively.
In its first of six dual meets, the
Stanford men's team came away
with a 19-8 victory over North
western. The Cardinal women
completed the sweep of the
Wildcats by winning the decisive
tie-breaker in a 8-8 match.
The Cardinal teams closed the
first day of the two-day round
robin by sweeping past Ohio State
University. The Cardinal women
notched an impressive 11-5 vic
tory over the National Collegiate
Athletic Association's fifth
ranked Buckeyes while the Card
inal men won 16-11.
On the final day of competition,
the Stanford men's team beat the
University of Illinois, 14-13, in a
contest that, according to Stanford
Head Coach Buzz Hurst, "went
neck and neck." The Illini, which
offers scholarships to its fencers, is
one of the toughest teams in the
Big 10 Conference, Hurst said.
The Cardinal women resumed
play against the University of Min
nesota, posting a 14-2 victory. The
Stanford men continued to roll as
well, winning 23-4 over the
Golden Gophers who compete on
the club level.
Against the University of Wis
consin, the Stanford's winning
streaks were halted. The Badger
men's team, first in the Big Ten,
managed to hold off a late Stan
ford rally to win 14-13 in a dual
meet that went down to the last
touch.

"They caught us off-balance."
Hurst said. "They went up ten to
five, then eleven to six. We had a
dramatic comeback â€” couldn't
quite pull it off."
Though hoping to avenge last
year's playoff loss, the Cardinal
women were defeated by the
Badgers 11-5. Afterward. Hurst ac
knowledged that the Wisconsin
women's squad is "a very good
team and beat Stanford fair and
square."
Both teams finished strongly in
their last dual meet against the
University of Chicago. The Stan
ford men's squad won 21-6, and
the Cardinal women's team re
corded a 16-0 shutout.
Hurst came away from the Big
Ten road trip "very satisfied" with
both teams' overall performances
and with the respect gained from
the Midwestern schools.
"The Midwest and the East get
smug about the West Coast
teams," Hurst said. "When we
came they acted a little indul
gently. They're not really as indul
gent now."
Hurst was especially pleased
with the performance of the men's
epee team which recorded 5-4 vic
tories over the highly-regarded
epee squads of Illinois, Ohio State
and Wisconsin. Moreover, Hurst
praised the efforts of Larry Murk
who finished 14-2 in the epee
competition.
"Larry has good experience. He
has a tendency to be inconsistent,"
Hurst said. "He really brought it
together though and caught fire."
The Stanford men's and
women's teams, now 9-1 and 8-1,
respectively, will prepare for a
home match against the Air Force
Academy and Fullerton State.
