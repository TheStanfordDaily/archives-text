Although the Stanford wrestling team suffered
two losses while getting one victory over the
weekend. Cardinal Coach Chris Horpel said that
considering the caliber of the three opponents, he
was pleased with the team's performance.
Stanford first met San Francisco State University
Friday in San Francisco and came away with a 33-
11 rout. The team then suffered a psychological
drop as Southern Oregon Universitv defeated the
Cardinal 20-13 immediately afterward. Southern
Oregon is a small-school power that can compete
head-to-head against most National Collegiate
Athletic Association Division I teams
"Because we did so well against San Fransisco. it
hurt us psychologically versus Southern Oregon as
we let up after the victory. We wrestled pretty well,
but Southern Oregon was more ready to compete
than us," Horpel said.
Against Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, ranked in the
top 15 nationally, Stanford had its best meet in
more than a decade according to Horpel, yet
still came out on the short end, 28-15. After seven

matches Stanford had a slim lead but couldn't hold
on.
With the one win and two losses, the Cardinal's
dual meet record dropped to 5-3.
Four wrestlers got through the weekend unde
feated against some of the toughest competition
thev will face all season. At 126 pounds, Neil
Wartnik began with an 8-1 blitz of San Francisco's
Cliff Lentz. He then drew against Mike Ritchey
from Southern Oregon 7-7 and the next day won 8-
4 over Wayne Nishiura of Cal Poly SLO.
"This is a shot in the arm for Neil for he needed
this type of weekend to boost his self-confidence."
Horpel said. "He has had many borderline matches,
but it doesn't matter if you lose for it causes a loss
of self-confidence."
Jeff Bradley (134 pounds) has come on as a con
sistent wrestler, and as co-captain his leadership is
helping the team. He started with a victory. 7-2.
over Rich Ellingsen (SF State) and then beat Kim
Satre (Southern Oregon), 6-3. Bradley pinned Erni
Geronimo (Cal Poly SLO) 44 seconds into the
second period.

The other co-captain, Pete Rogers (158 pounds),
routed his first opponent. Don Moseman, 18-4 ,(SF
State). Moseman gave Rogers a difficult match ear
lier in the season, hut was no match Friday. Rogers
edged out Greg Burrington (Southern Oregon), 3-
1. and then defeated Todd Barnes (Cal Poly SLO),
8-2.
Rogers and Bradley, who are roommates, have
been helping to bring each other along, according
to Horpel.
Freshman Dave Lee (167 pounds) to
be a consistent and polished wrestler despite his
youth. He had three extremely tough opponents
and came away with two victories and a draw.
Against Andrew Steffen (SF State) Lee had a one
point advantage before Steffen was disqualified for
stalling with 21 seconds left in the match. He next
tied Steve Tekander (Southern Oregon), 5-5, and
Saturday defeated Eric Osborne (Cal Poly SLO), 9-
3.
The Cardinal has another tough weekend ahead
as it faces Humboldt State and Fullerton State
Friday at home and then travels to San Francisco
the next day for the All-California Invitational.


Card wrestling had a tough time this weekend as it won its first match
easily, but got a little overconfident and lost its second match. In its

fort in many years but couldn't defeat Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.
