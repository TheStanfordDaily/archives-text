### INGRIDSEYER Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford men's and women's swimming and diving
teams not only defeated Arizona State and the University
of Arizona this weekend, but they also had 11 NCAA
qualifying times during the two days of competition.
Swimmers must meet cut-off times set for each event by
the NCAA before they can compete in the National Col
legiate Athletic Association championships in that event.
The men's team defeated Arizona State 79-34 and
Arizona 69-44 while also meeting six qualifying times.
The women's team followed suit with a 71-42 victory of
Arizona State and a 65-48 victory over Arizona. The
women's team had five qualifying times.
According to men's Coach Skip Kenney, his team swam

exceptionally well and set several pool records at Arizona
State.
"These were our first real conference dual meets and
the guys were really eager to get off the blocks and start
swimming," Kenney said. "It was a very competitive yet
relaxing weekend of competition."
In the meet against Arizona State on Friday the men
had four qualifying times. The 400-yard medley relay
team of Dave Bottom, Tim Moffett, Pablo Morales and
Dave Louden took first place with a time of 3 mioptes,
20.90 seconds. Morales won the 200-yard individual med
ley (1:50.7) and the 200-yard butterfly (1:47.94). Bottom
won the 100-yard backstroke (50.56).
In the victory over Arizona, the Cardinal won six of 11
races — sweeping four — and went one-two in both diving

events.
Sophomore Jeff Kostoff performed very well in the
Arizona meet, according to Kenney. Kostoff placed
second behind Arizona Olympian George DiCarlo in the
1,000-yard freestyle but came back to defeat DiCarlo in
the 500-yard freestyle with a time of 9:04.44.
"Jeff had one heck of a swim," Kenney said. "I was
really proud of him."
In the same meet, Cardinal freshman Matt Nance
qualifyed for the NCA As in the 400-yard individual med
ley (3:56.64) and classmate Sean Murphy did likewise in
the 200-yard backstroke (1:49.91).
Although women's coach George Haines was happy
with both of his team's victories, he was more pleased with
the team's performance against Arizona State on Friday.

"The women really swam super on Friday and Had
some great times," Haines said. "I switched the line Ops
around on Saturday and the team just didn't perform as
well."
The Cardinal women had four of their five qualifying
times on Friday at Arizona State. Meeting the cut-off
times were Jennifer Pokluda, Kathy Smith, Diana Zock
and Beth Washut of the 200-yard medley relay team,
Mary Beth Linzmeier in the 200-yard freestyle, Kathy
Smith in the 200-yard breaststrokc and Patty Gavin in |he
400-yard individual medley and 200-yard backstroke. j
