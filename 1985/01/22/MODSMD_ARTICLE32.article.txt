### CAROLYN TARKINGTON 
The Stanford women s gymnastics team opened its
season with a second-place finish Thursday against the
University of Oklahoma and the University of Texas at
Norman, Okla.
Competing in the all-around for the Cardinal were
freshman Alison McGann and seniors Angie Barnes and
Merilyn Chapman. Oklahoma, ranked Bth nationally, put
in strong performances for a team total of 181.65 and first
place. Stanford finished with a total of 174.55, and Texas
finished third with 140.1.
"Oklahoma looked really strong," Head Coach Homer
Sardina said. "We had 16 major breaks, however. For our
first competition, that's not too bad."
In the individual events, Sophomore Nanci Goldsmith
placed third on bars with a 9.30, freshman Beth Pope and
Chapman tied for third on floor with an 8.95, and sopho
more Cindy Boyde and Pope tied for second on vault with
an 8.85.
On Saturday, the Cardinal competed in the Gopher In
vitational in Minneapolis hosted by the University of Min
nesota. Also competing was 18th-ranked University of Il
linois. University of Georgia, ranked 4th nationally, was

not present because of a missed plane flight.
Placing first in the team competition was Minnesota
with a 179.05. Stanford finished second again with 174.50
and Illinois was third with a 162.85.
In the individual events, Angie Barnes placed first on
bars with a 9.20, Chapman placed second on floor with a
9.15 and tied for third on vault with McGann with a 9.20.
"I think the team did a great job this past week. We lost
to one team and beat one team in each meet," Sardina
said. "I feel good about where we are at in relation to
some of the top teams in the country, and I forsee that we
have a strong season ahead of us."
Because of poor conditions, both Stanford and Illinois
will be writing a complaint to Minnesota's athletic director
requesting that the invitational be held in different
facilities, according to Sardina.
"All in all it was a very poorly run competition and we
were very disappointed," Sardina said. "The equipment
set-up was very unsafe, there were not enough mats to go
around and the gym was very cold. We felt it was an ac
complishment just getting through the meet injury-free,
and I was very proud of the team for sticking it out."
