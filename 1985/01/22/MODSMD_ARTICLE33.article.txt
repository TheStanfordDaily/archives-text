# Card spikers open season
## 
### JASON COLE Daily staff 
The Stanford men's volleyball team
opens its 1985 season tonight as it
hosts Chico State in Maples Pavilion.
Last season, the Cardinal finished
13-15 overall but was 6-12, finishing
sixth in the very competitive Califor
nia Intercollegiate Volleyball Associ
ation. The CIVA featured such top
-10 teams as Pepperdine University,
UCLA, the University of California
at Santa Barbara and USC.
If Stanford expects to improve in
1985, several things must occur. First,
the Cardinal must avoid injuries
since, according to Co-Coach Don
Shaw, the team lacks depth.
Second, the Cardinal must win con
sistently. Shaw has said that Stanford
has the height and athletic ability to
deal with anybody in the CIVA.
"Stanford has scored some pretty im
pressive victories over top teams in
the country in recent years, but we
haven't been able to win on a consis
tent basis," he said.
"I believe we have the talent to do
well in the conference which is the
toughest in the nation," Shaw said.
And for the first time in some years,

the team has experience.
Nine of Stanford's top players
return. There's good size and quick
ness along the front line. UCLA,
USC and Pepperdine will again be
the top three contenders for the Na
tional Collegiate Athletic Association
championship, but the Cardinal will
be in contention for a post-season
spot in the playoffs.
Stanford should be strongest at
middle blocker and setter where it
returns Jon Root and Craig Lauch
ner, respectively. Root, who was a
second-team Ail-American and All-
CIVA as a junior last season, was the
Cardinal's leading hitter.
Root, according to the coaching
staff, has improved his game from an
©motional standpoint. He would
sometimes let mistakes frustrate him
last year. He can also play outside hit
ter if needed.
Lauchner, who is one of only two
seniors on the team, will be the Card
inal's setter in its 5-1 offense. Lauch
ner was an honorable mention All-
CIVA and will obviously be the key
to Stanford's success.
The match will begin at 7:30 p.m.
