## Corner Pocket managers turn pizza into profit 
### STEPHANIE TEAL 
True or false: Domino s is the only way to get pizza
without leaving the campus." According to the 1,000 or
so people who frequent Tresidder's Corner Pocket each
day, the answer is definitively "false."
John Loya, one of the Corner Pocket's three student
managers, said that pizza is the most popular item on the
menu. "We do have our frozen yogurt addicts, but they
are far outweighed by the pizza fiends." Besides pizza and
fro-yo, the Corner Pocket also offers soup, salad, drinks
and calzone.
Kim Kelly, another manager, explained that the restau
rant had expanded a great deal in its three years of exis
tence. "We've grown every year. We used to sell just
cookies and stuff, but we're always looking for new things,
like the calzone.' Kelly is an expert on the Corner Pocket,
having worked there since its opening, "day one, fresh
man year."
Kelly moved up to manager this year along with Loya
and Randy Vogel. The trio of juniors achieved their posi
tions following applications and interviews, during which
they were asked about their goals and proposals for the
restaurant.
According to Kelly, it was not that difficult to develop
ideas. "I knew how the place worked, and I had a bunch
of ideas for improving it. For instance, we're trying to give
it a more cohesive aura. We're going to be moving into
uniforms soon, like T-shirts and visors."
As managers, Loya, Vogel and Kelly are responsible for
all aspects of running the Corner Pocket. Loya explained.

"Mostly we work on financing, operating and advertis
ing."
Loya estimated that the managers work about 30 hours
every week, though they are trying to reduce it to 25.
Kelly added, "This past week or two has been really hectic.
It should normalize soon."
The managers are not the only students working at the
Corner Pocket. According to Loya, the restaurant
employs approximately 35 students, and retains one or
two non-student employees who work the morning and
other hard-to-schedule shifts. Valerie Waken, a junior,
said, "I love working here. The managers are really easy
going and understand the needs of students. We can work
as much or little as we want."
Easy-going managers or not, the Corner Pocket has
shown a profit ever since it opened. "We do better every
year," said Kelly. "It's really profitable."
Why do three students devote so much time to this en
terprise? Motioning to the cup near her hand, Kelly
divulged her motivation: "I'm addicted to frozen yogurt.
And I've worked here so long, it's like a second home to
me. I take pride in the place and like my job. Besides, the
money is good."
Loya said that he goes home from work and finds him
self thinking about the store. "I'm always trying to in
novate and to expand. It's like a baby; you want to bring it
up right. I don't want to sound all philosophical, but this is
good exposure to life. It's a microcosm of what's going on
out there."
"And,"he added, "it's fun "
