"There is going to be nonviolence or nonexis
tence."
Ira Sandperl of the Nonviolence Education
Program used this quotation from Martin Luther
King, Jr. as a theme for a speech last night en
titled "Personal Recollections of Martin Luther
King, Jr."
Speaking to an audience of about 40 members
of the Stanford community in Madera Lounge,
Sandperl expounded on his policy of nonviolent
activism. Sandperl, who graduated from Stanford
in the mid-19405, said his philosophy was based
on the writings of the well-known pacifist
Mohandas Gandhi.
Sandperl said the catalyst of his transformation
from personal pacifism to direct political action
was Gandhi's autobiography, "My Experiments
with Truth."
Since his transition, Sandperl has worked with
numerous organizations in the Bay Area and
across the United States, including the Commit
tee for Justice, the Peninsula Peace Center,
Peninsula School, the Committee for Nonviolent
Action, the Stanford Peace Group and the In
stitute for the Study of Nonviolence. Currently,
he and his wife Molly conduct the Nonviolence
Education Program for Humanitas International,

founded by Joan Baez.
In addition to his memories of King, Sandperl
included among his discussion topics nonviolent
activism, minority oppression and war. He inter
spersed these topics with humorous anecdotes
about King, other members of the civil rights
movement and about his own work.
As the basis for both his own as well as King's
commitment to nonviolence, Sandperl cites
Gandhi's work in India. He credits Gandhi with
the discovery of nonviolence.
"Nonviolence socially and politically is in in
fancy. It began in 1906 with Gandhi," he said. In
contrast, organized violence is thousands of years
old, he said. Despite this discouraging fact, he
and King believe nonviolence will endure and is
the only way society will continue to exist.
"Transformation of relationships. That's the
end goal of nonviolence. So that finally there's no
oppressor and no oppressed," Sandperl said.
In his discussion of minority oppression,
Sandperl cited the Granada, Miss, incident in
which nine black children were brutally beaten
on their way to integrate a white school. Sandperl
and Baez were among the whites who went to
Granada to walk the children to school.
"They knew more about the white community
than the white community will ever know about
the black community," Sandperl said of the

children, whom he got to know very well. This
knowlege of the oppressive group is universal to
all minority groups, including Catholics in Bel
fast, Jews outside of Israel and blacks, he said.
In addition, Sandperl maintained that op
pressed minority groups also share the same
humor. These groups mock themselves before
"they" have a chance to mock them, he said.
"Gandhi once said 'Civilization should be
judged by its treatment of its minorities,' well,
obviously, there has therefore been no civiliza
tion," Sandperl jokingly observed.
Finally, Sandperl spoke on war from a
pacifist's viewpoint. He, like Gandhi and King,
sees war as a sophisticated form of pre-meditated
murder. He feels war has attained an honored
position in modern society and is an entrenched
part of everyday life.
Sandperl rejects the notion that the United
States and the Soviet Union have avoided war.
He believes instead that the two powers are cur
rently engaged in war through their respective
"client states."
In summation of the current state of relations
between the superpowers, Sandperl stressed the
similarity of their positions:
"If there is a third world war, it won't come out
of disagreement, it will come out of the agree
ment that it's okay to kill."
