# Bowl briefs: cold, crowds, a coin toss
## 
### 
Stanford football fans wouldn't have
recognized their own stadium Sunday. In ad
dition to the National Football League sym
bol painted at midfield and the two teams'
logos striped in opposite end zones, Stanford
Stadium was stuffed to the 80th row, some
thing that usually happens just once every two
years, when the California Golden Bears visit
for Big Game. The 84,059 fans comprised the
fifth-largest Super Bowl crowd ever.
Adding to the stadium's new look were two
Diamondvision video scoreboards, 85,000
Apple Computer seat cushions and a number
of fur coats, the latter a testament to the cold
weather and financial state of many of the
fans. How easy was it to forget where you
were? Even Hoover Tower — "the symbol of
Stanford," according to an ABC television
commentator — was shrouded from the fans'
view by the heavy fog.
• • •
If the lines winding outside the
restrooms were any indication, beer sales
Sunday topped off rather nicely. In fact,
though fans purchased progressively less ice
cream, orange juice and soft drinks as their
hands began to turn blue, folks kept on troop
ing off to the beer stands throughout the
game. And that should make Stanford ad

ministrators happy; the University will
reportedly receive 27 percent of concessions
sales revenue,in exchange for "rent-free"' use
of the stadium.
• • •
The signs outside the stadium said:
"No bottles, cans, coolers, umbrellas, ban
ners, horns or fireworks allowed in the
stadium."
Nevertheless, a quick tour of the stands
showed that at least some fans failed to see
these clearly posted warnings. Some managed
to hide cans of beer and flasks of brandy in
their purses and pockets as they waltzed past
security. Blaring horns and unfurling banners
were an integral part of rowdy cheering sec
tions.
As for the controversial rain shields: While
most fans probably left their umbrellas in the
car, all 1,300 dancers in the pre-game pro
gram showed up with red, white or blue
models. When opened, the parasols helped
form a huge American flag.

The hype surrounding President
Reagan's cross-country, via-satellite tossing
of the game coin was met with jeers by some

tans at the stadium. Dolphins' Center Dwight
Stephenson called heads, and when the silver
dollar came up tails, one 49er faithful com
mented. "That's the first thing he's done right
in four years." Then, when the president
wished that "everyone does their best," an
other fan chided his urammatical error. Still.
Reagan got the last laugh: His second in
auguration occurred earlier that day.
• • •
As a 49ers' victory became apparent
midway throught the third quarter, the highly
partisan crowd. man\ of whom began party
ing Thursday and still have not stopped, came
alive. Cheers of "Go Niners!" erupted
throughout the stadium, and concessionaires
reported a surge in sales of 49ers pennants,
shirts and hats after halftime.
Jim O'Brien displayed his team pride by
stripping down to a pair of red warm-up
pants, covering his entire upper body — in
cluding his moustache and the inside of his
ears — with red paint and donning a red bath
ing cap. He painted the number 49 on his
chest and back. Clutching a beer with a red
rim, the result of contact with his red lips, he
maintained he wasn't cold despite tempera
tures that ranged from the mid 30s to 50
degrees during the game.

• • •
Super Bowl fans may go in for useless
souvenirs and corny halftime shows, but they
apparently find the latest stadium trend too
bourgeois. One enthusiastic spectator was
laughed out of his section when he tried to
start "The Wave." Said one fan: "We don't
do that stuff here in San Francisco."
• • •
Mike Ditka. head coach of the Chicago
Bears, wore a longing look from his perch in
the press box. The Bears were beaten by the
49ers just one game shy of the Super Bowl,
and Ditka certainly would have rather been
on the field calling the plays instead of up in
the stands watching them. Between plays.
Ditka spent his time talking with reporters,
signing autographs, smoking a cigar and
chewing gum with the same vigorous inten
sity he displays on the sidelines.
• • •
Despite the addition of some
restroom facilities, the long bathroom lines
one usually finds at Stanford football games
were even longer at Super Bowl XIX. Some

men reported waiting 20 minutes, which,
given the offensive fireworks of Joe Montana,
meant they might have left their seats with the
49ers down 10-7 and returned to find them
ahead 21-10.
Outside one women's restroom, folks at the
back of the line cried out, "OK girls, let's
speed it up there." One women reported that
only four of 10 stalls were functional in th&t
bathroom.
• • •
Lots of people have criticized Stanford for
hosting the Super Bowl, but few could back
up their complaints with the kind of hard facts
that many hungry Stanford students dis
covered Sunday night. Neither Domino's nor
Ramona's pizza would deliver to campus on
Sunday, claiming it was impossible to cross El
Camino Real and still deliver a hot product.

bitious fans strapped a huge 49ers" helmet to

the stands watching them. Between plays.
Ditka spent his time talking with reporters,
signing autographs, smoking a cigar and
chewing gum with the same vigorous inten
sity he displays on the sidelines.

Despite the addition of some
restroom facilities, the long bathroom lines
one usually finds at Stanford football games
were even longer at Super Bowl XIX. Some

men reported waiting 20 minutes, which,
given the offensive fireworks of Joe Montana,
meant they might have left their seats with the
49ers down 10-7 and returned to find them
ahead 21-10.
Outside one women's restroom, folks at the
back of the line cried out, "OK girls, let's
speed it up there." One women reported that
only four of 10 stalls were functional in th&t
bathroom.

Lots of people have criticized Stanford for
hosting the Super Bowl, but few could back
up their complaints with the kind of hard facts
that many hungry Stanford students dis
covered Sunday night. Neither Domino's nor
Ramona's pizza would deliver to campus on
Sunday, claiming it was impossible to cross El
Camino Real and still deliver a hot product.

Stanford football fans wouldn't have
recognized their own stadium Sunday. In ad
dition to the National Football League sym
bol painted at midfield and the two teams'
logos striped in opposite end zones, Stanford
Stadium was stuffed to the 80th row, some
thing that usually happens just once every two
years, when the California Golden Bears visit
for Big Game. The 84,059 fans comprised the
fifth-largest Super Bowl crowd ever.
Adding to the stadium's new look were two
Diamondvision video scoreboards, 85,000
Apple Computer seat cushions and a number
of fur coats, the latter a testament to the cold
weather and financial state of many of the
fans. How easy was it to forget where you
were? Even Hoover Tower — "the symbol of
Stanford," according to an ABC television
commentator — was shrouded from the fans'
view by the heavy fog.

If the lines winding outside the
restrooms were any indication, beer sales
Sunday topped off rather nicely. In fact,
though fans purchased progressively less ice
cream, orange juice and soft drinks as their
hands began to turn blue, folks kept on troop
ing off to the beer stands throughout the
game. And that should make Stanford ad

ministrators happy; the University will
reportedly receive 27 percent of concessions
sales revenue,in exchange for "rent-free"' use
of the stadium.

The signs outside the stadium said:
"No bottles, cans, coolers, umbrellas, ban
ners, horns or fireworks allowed in the
stadium."
Nevertheless, a quick tour of the stands
showed that at least some fans failed to see
these clearly posted warnings. Some managed
to hide cans of beer and flasks of brandy in
their purses and pockets as they waltzed past
security. Blaring horns and unfurling banners
were an integral part of rowdy cheering sec
tions.
As for the controversial rain shields: While
most fans probably left their umbrellas in the
car, all 1,300 dancers in the pre-game pro
gram showed up with red, white or blue
models. When opened, the parasols helped
form a huge American flag.

The hype surrounding President
Reagan's cross-country, via-satellite tossing
of the game coin was met with jeers by some

tans at the stadium. Dolphins' Center Dwight
Stephenson called heads, and when the silver
dollar came up tails, one 49er faithful com
mented. "That's the first thing he's done right
in four years." Then, when the president
wished that "everyone does their best," an
other fan chided his urammatical error. Still.
Reagan got the last laugh: His second in
auguration occurred earlier that day.

As a 49ers' victory became apparent
midway throught the third quarter, the highly
partisan crowd. man\ of whom began party
ing Thursday and still have not stopped, came
alive. Cheers of "Go Niners!" erupted
throughout the stadium, and concessionaires
reported a surge in sales of 49ers pennants,
shirts and hats after halftime.
Jim O'Brien displayed his team pride by
stripping down to a pair of red warm-up
pants, covering his entire upper body — in
cluding his moustache and the inside of his
ears — with red paint and donning a red bath
ing cap. He painted the number 49 on his
chest and back. Clutching a beer with a red
rim, the result of contact with his red lips, he
maintained he wasn't cold despite tempera
tures that ranged from the mid 30s to 50
degrees during the game.

Super Bowl fans may go in for useless
souvenirs and corny halftime shows, but they
apparently find the latest stadium trend too
bourgeois. One enthusiastic spectator was
laughed out of his section when he tried to
start "The Wave." Said one fan: "We don't
do that stuff here in San Francisco."
• • •
Mike Ditka. head coach of the Chicago
Bears, wore a longing look from his perch in
the press box. The Bears were beaten by the
49ers just one game shy of the Super Bowl,
and Ditka certainly would have rather been
on the field calling the plays instead of up in
the stands watching them. Between plays.
Ditka spent his time talking with reporters,
signing autographs, smoking a cigar and
chewing gum with the same vigorous inten
