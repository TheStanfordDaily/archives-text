## 
### MARK BEYREIS Staff writer 
Eugene Farber, the chairman of the medical center's
Dermatology Department, pleaded not guilty to a charge
of sexual battery when he was arraigned Friday.
Tom Nolan. Farber's attorney, said after the hearing
that it will be shown that his client is "totally and ab
solutely innocent."
The prosecution did not do "anywhere near the type of
investigation it should have done"' before charging Far
ber, Nolan said. Nolan has filed a motion of discovery
which will entitle him to the findings of the investigations
conducted before Farber was charged.
Nolan said this information, which he will obtain Jan.
15. will be useful in getting to the bottom of the accusa
tion against Farber.
Farber has received "hundreds and hundreds of letters
of support" from patients, fellow doctors, friends and
people he has never met, Nolan said.
Nolan said it has been "difficult" for Farber since his
arrest on Jan. 3, but "he's not letting it get him down.
Farber was arrested after a patient reported to the
police that he gave her a pelvic examination and later at
tempted to "grab her and kiss her' when she went to have
Farber treat her for psoriasis of the feet, said Lynne
Johnson, coordinator of the Palo Alto Police Depart
ment's Investigative Services Division.
Johnson said the pelvic exam was considered signifi
cant. "Based on our information, it is not a normal exam
performed for psoriasis of the feet."' she said.
Farber "did nothing improper." Nolan said.
Nolan said the police report — which failed to note that
another doctor, Richard Noodleman, a third-year resident
in dermatology, was in the room during the examination
— was incomplete.
By design there is always a second staff member in the
room during examinations, Nolan said.
Johnson said the victim's statements were substantiated
by a phone call between the woman and Farber which
police taped.
In that phone conversation Farber implicitly admitted
that he had conducted a pelvic exam and that he had been
alone with the patient, Johnson said.
Johnson also said the phone call did "substantiate that
he had tried to kiss her and that he grabbed her.
Farber currently plans to see
patients with another staff member
present during examinations, said Mi
chael Goodkind, director of the
Medical Center News Bureau.
The University considers Farber
innocent until proven guilty, Good
kind said.
"Dr. Farber continues his good
work at the hospital," Nolan said.
