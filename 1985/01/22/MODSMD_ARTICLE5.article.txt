# Niven's to close
## University, store reach agreement 
### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
Officials confirmed yesterday that Niven's In
ternational Market in the Stanford Shopping
Center will close in March as a result of a legal
settlement between the University and the 30-
year tenant.
The pact apparently ends more than six
months of bitter feuding, both in and out of
court, between Stanford and storeowner John
Niven. The University, as Niven's landlord, will
assume control over the 23.000-square-foot
structure and probably rent it out to a store or
group of stores.
Although both parties declined to elaborate
upon the details of the settlement. Niven said
last night that the deal was "fair and equitable."
"They made me an offer that I simply thought
was reasonable," he said. "I think both parties

are happy."
"It seemed to both of us that we were never
going to be happy together," he said. "It's sort
of like getting divorced. You realize it's not
going to work and you both go on your ways."
University attorney John Schwartz would
only say: "It's a business agreement that was
obviously mutually advantageous."
The University announced the deal on
Friday, but Niven at that time dismissed it as a
rumor.
The dispute stemmed from Niven's desire to
sublease sections of his store to a Mrs. Fields
cookie shop and a Cone-a-Copia ice cream ven
dor. I he University filed suit against Niven last
July, claiming such subleasing was a violation of
his lease.

Market at the Stanford Shopping Center to the University in March.
