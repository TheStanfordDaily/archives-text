# Niven's to close
## University, store reach agreement 
### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
Officials confirmed yesterday that Niven's In
ternational Market in the Stanford Shopping
Center will close in March as a result of a legal
settlement between the University and the 30-
year tenant.
The pact apparently ends more than six
months of bitter feuding, both in and out of
court, between Stanford and storeowner John
Niven. The University, as Niven's landlord, will
assume control over the 23.000-square-foot
structure and probably rent it out to a store or
group of stores.
Although both parties declined to elaborate
upon the details of the settlement. Niven said
last night that the deal was "fair and equitable."
"They made me an offer that I simply thought
was reasonable," he said. "I think both parties

are happy."
"It seemed to both of us that we were never
going to be happy together," he said. "It's sort
of like getting divorced. You realize it's not
going to work and you both go on your ways."
University attorney John Schwartz would
only say: "It's a business agreement that was
obviously mutually advantageous."
The University announced the deal on
Friday, but Niven at that time dismissed it as a
rumor.
The dispute stemmed from Niven's desire to
sublease sections of his store to a Mrs. Fields
cookie shop and a Cone-a-Copia ice cream ven
dor. I he University filed suit against Niven last
July, claiming such subleasing was a violation of
his lease.

In the wake of a long and sometimes bitter lawsuit, John Niven will sell his International
Market at the Stanford Shopping Center to the University in March.
During August, the University
sought a temporary restraining order
and a preliminary injunction to
prevent Niven from moving ahead
with his plans while the lawsuit was
pending. While judges denied both
motions, University attorneys even
tually succeeded in stalling the plan
by objecting to the proposed location
for the two concessionaires.
On Oct. 9, Eugene Premo, the
Santa Clara County Superior Court
judge who heard the case, recom
mended that the dispute be resolved
by an independent arbitrator. Niven
agreed, but Stanford attornies
rejected the suggestion.
In late December, Premo, address
ing the narrow issue of location, ruled
that Niven could lease space in the
front window of his store, as he had
requested. The larger question of
whether the subleasing would be a
violation of Niven's contract had yet
to be heard.
That, apparently, is when both par
ties began seriously considering ter
minating the lease, which was sched
uled to run until the year 2006.

"This whole deal just sort of
dropped in my lap," Niven said. "I
hadn't the faintest notion of selling
that store. It was the furthest thing
from my mind."
Niven said his tangle with Stanford
"was more than just a dispute over
Mrs. Fields cookies and Cone-a-
Copia." He declined to elaborate on
the other elements of discord.
Despite the months of legal battles,
Niven said the settlement was
amiable.
"I don't think there's any bitter
ness, no 'I got you' or 'You got me,' "
he said. "It (the deal) met both of our
needs."
As part of the agreement, the
delicatessen currently inside Niven's
will be relocated to another part of
the shopping center. Approximately
40 store employees will lose jobs as a
result of the closure.
Niven, who began working as a bag
boy when the store opened in 1955
and earned a masters in business ad
ministration from Stanford in 1965,
said he plans to "relax for a little bit"
before looking for more work. He
said he would consider opening an
other grocery store.
