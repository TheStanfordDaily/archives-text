# Official report clears onlookers

Students at a Nov. 8 fraternity
party who reportedly laughed while
an assailant tore the clothes off four
women will not be charged with mis
conduct, according to a University
report.
"I think it is reasonable to give the
benefit of the doubt to those
bystanders who did not try to help;
they were slow-witted, perhaps, but
not malicious," said Judicial Affairs
Officer Sally Cole in her five-page
report.
The University launched a major
investigation after five women who
had attended the Nov. 8 Beta Theta
Pi fraternity party filed battery
charges against 20-year-old sopho
more David Keane. Students charged
that onlookers laughed and cheered
Keane on as he attacked the women
but did not come to the victims' aid.
Cole investigated the bystander al
legation to determine whether stu
dents violated the Fundamental Stan
dard, the University's official code of
behavior. She concluded, after inter
viewing more than 20 students who
attended the Beta party, that on
lookers did not know what was hap
pening and did not laugh at the
women when Keane grabbed them.
"Have I identified bystanders who
were amused by the women's distress
and chose not to come to their aid?
The answer is no. Do I believe that
such bystanders exist and that I have
simply failed to identify them? The
answer is that 1 am not entirely sure.
If I had to choose a more definite
response, then I would say no."
Freshmen Charlotte Lowson and
Cathy Zerboni, two of the women
who filed charges against Keane. said
yesterday that they are dissatisfied
with Cole's findings. "The report
negates everything that happened,"
Lowson said.
Cole's report does negate much of

what the two women say occurred,
but Cole said she feels the women re
ported their perceptions honestly.
"I do not doubt for a moment the
sincerity of their reports," she wrote.
"They do not, however, square with
the observations of at least a dozen
other students who were on the stairs
or on the periphery of the dance
floor" at the Beta house.
Lowson and Zerboni said Keane
had grabbed Lowson, tried to rip her
shirt off and struggled with her for at
least five minutes. But Cole con
cluded that Keane had grabbed hold

of Lowson while falling, that "he was
not . . . attempting to remove her
clothing" and that the entire event
took "two minutes or less."
"In a state of perceived peril, one
experiences time as passing very, very
slowly," Cole said.
Lowson and Zerboni said on
lookers laughed and cheered as Low
son struggled with Keane. Cole con
cluded, however, that "there was
laughing and perhaps even cheering"
but that it was "directed at a drunken
