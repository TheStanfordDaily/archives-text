# Official report clears onlookers

### CHARLIE GOFEN Daily staff 
Students at a Nov. 8 fraternity
party who reportedly laughed while
an assailant tore the clothes off four
women will not be charged with mis
conduct, according to a University
report.
"I think it is reasonable to give the
benefit of the doubt to those
bystanders who did not try to help;
they were slow-witted, perhaps, but
not malicious," said Judicial Affairs
Officer Sally Cole in her five-page
report.
The University launched a major
investigation after five women who
had attended the Nov. 8 Beta Theta
Pi fraternity party filed battery
charges against 20-year-old sopho
more David Keane. Students charged
that onlookers laughed and cheered
Keane on as he attacked the women
but did not come to the victims' aid.
Cole investigated the bystander al
legation to determine whether stu
dents violated the Fundamental Stan
dard, the University's official code of
behavior. She concluded, after inter
viewing more than 20 students who
attended the Beta party, that on
lookers did not know what was hap
pening and did not laugh at the
women when Keane grabbed them.
"Have I identified bystanders who
were amused by the women's distress
and chose not to come to their aid?
The answer is no. Do I believe that
such bystanders exist and that I have
simply failed to identify them? The
answer is that 1 am not entirely sure.
If I had to choose a more definite
response, then I would say no."
Freshmen Charlotte Lowson and
Cathy Zerboni, two of the women
who filed charges against Keane. said
yesterday that they are dissatisfied
with Cole's findings. "The report
negates everything that happened,"
Lowson said.
Cole's report does negate much of

what the two women say occurred,
but Cole said she feels the women re
ported their perceptions honestly.
"I do not doubt for a moment the
sincerity of their reports," she wrote.
"They do not, however, square with
the observations of at least a dozen
other students who were on the stairs
or on the periphery of the dance
floor" at the Beta house.
Lowson and Zerboni said Keane
had grabbed Lowson, tried to rip her
shirt off and struggled with her for at
least five minutes. But Cole con
cluded that Keane had grabbed hold

of Lowson while falling, that "he was
not . . . attempting to remove her
clothing" and that the entire event
took "two minutes or less."
"In a state of perceived peril, one
experiences time as passing very, very
slowly," Cole said.
Lowson and Zerboni said on
lookers laughed and cheered as Low
son struggled with Keane. Cole con
cluded, however, that "there was
laughing and perhaps even cheering"
but that it was "directed at a drunken


Sally Cole
student (Keane) who was making a
fool of himself, not at the plight of the
woman (Lowson)."
Lowson called the report "an un
necessary derogation of our words,"
saying that Cole "took other people's
testimony over ours. To a fairly large
extent, she seemed to be saying about
us, 'They didn't know they were lying,
but they were lying.' "
Lowson and Zerboni said they met
with Cole last Monday to express
their dissatisfaction with the report.

noting what they perceived as incon
sistencies in Cole's conclusions. Low
son said she was unhappy with both
the facts and the tone of the report.
Zerboni said she was more con
cerned that Cole seemed to vindicate
the bystanders without raising impor
tant ethical questions. "What really
upsets me is that she doesn't say
strongly enough that this is a sad and
awful thing, an event that exposes a
sad phenomenon of the human per
sonality," Zerboni said of the report.
Cole said yesterday that she did not
plan to alter her report despite com
plaints from some of the students she
interviewed. She said she hoped her
report would spur discussion and

"educational knowledge."
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said Cole had put together "a
very good report." In a page of intro
ductory comments he wrote to "put a
context around" Cole's report, Lyons
said:
"Students must recognize and
respond to abusive or threatening be
havior; this obligation is especially
compelling when the victims are fel
low students. Cole's report notes that
it may be difficult in certain circum
stances for students to intervene
safely and effectively. If that is the
case, then these circumstances need
to be discussed and sensible solutions
need to be found."

Lyons, like Cole, warned of the
danger in denying the reality of the
victims' perceptions:
"Several women students were
grabbed and pawed at a Stanford fra
ternity party; each of them was
unable to escape; each of them was
terrified. Some bystanders, at least,
dismissed these events as drunken but
harmless 'fooling around.' That
response, however, also dismisses as
irrelevant half of the social reality of
the situation — the effect of this be
havior on the unwilling recipients.
What they felt at the time was the ter
ror of physical helplessness and their
memories of these moments will not
be easily erased."

Lowson said she has encountered a
great deal of resentment from people
who believe she should not have told
the police or The Daily about the
Beta party. She said she has been
harassed to the extent that she does
not go to parties outside her own
dorm anymore, adding that a girl
identifying herself as "Claudia, David
Keane's girlfriend" had called her a
"bitch" at the only party she had at
tended since November.
The University has completed its
confidential investigation of Keane's
behavior — conducted separately by
Lyons — and Cole is "taking appro
priate actions on behalf of the Uni
versity. That process is confidential."

fool of himself, not at the plight of the
woman (Lowson)."
Lowson called the report "an un
necessary derogation of our words,"
saying that Cole "took other people's
testimony over ours. To a fairly large
extent, she seemed to be saying about
us, 'They didn't know they were lying,
but they were lying.' "
Lowson and Zerboni said they met
with Cole last Monday to express
their dissatisfaction with the report.

noting what they perceived as incon
sistencies in Cole's conclusions. Low
son said she was unhappy with both
the facts and the tone of the report.
Zerboni said she was more con
cerned that Cole seemed to vindicate
the bystanders without raising impor
tant ethical questions. "What really
upsets me is that she doesn't say
strongly enough that this is a sad and
awful thing, an event that exposes a
sad phenomenon of the human per
sonality," Zerboni said of the report.
Cole said yesterday that she did not
plan to alter her report despite com
plaints from some of the students she
interviewed. She said she hoped her
report would spur discussion and

"educational knowledge."
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said Cole had put together "a
very good report." In a page of intro
ductory comments he wrote to "put a
context around" Cole's report, Lyons
said:
"Students must recognize and
respond to abusive or threatening be
havior; this obligation is especially
compelling when the victims are fel
low students. Cole's report notes that
it may be difficult in certain circum
stances for students to intervene
safely and effectively. If that is the
case, then these circumstances need
to be discussed and sensible solutions
need to be found."

Lyons, like Cole, warned of the
danger in denying the reality of the
victims' perceptions:
"Several women students were
grabbed and pawed at a Stanford fra
ternity party; each of them was
unable to escape; each of them was
terrified. Some bystanders, at least,
dismissed these events as drunken but
harmless 'fooling around.' That
response, however, also dismisses as
irrelevant half of the social reality of
the situation — the effect of this be
havior on the unwilling recipients.
What they felt at the time was the ter
ror of physical helplessness and their
memories of these moments will not
be easily erased."

Lowson said she has encountered a
great deal of resentment from people
who believe she should not have told
the police or The Daily about the
Beta party. She said she has been
harassed to the extent that she does
not go to parties outside her own
dorm anymore, adding that a girl
identifying herself as "Claudia, David
Keane's girlfriend" had called her a
"bitch" at the only party she had at
tended since November.
The University has completed its
confidential investigation of Keane's
behavior — conducted separately by
Lyons — and Cole is "taking appro
priate actions on behalf of the Uni
versity. That process is confidential."
Students at a Nov. 8 fraternity
party who reportedly laughed while
an assailant tore the clothes off four
women will not be charged with mis
conduct, according to a University
report.
"I think it is reasonable to give the
benefit of the doubt to those
bystanders who did not try to help;
they were slow-witted, perhaps, but
not malicious," said Judicial Affairs
Officer Sally Cole in her five-page
report.
The University launched a major
investigation after five women who
had attended the Nov. 8 Beta Theta
Pi fraternity party filed battery
charges against 20-year-old sopho
more David Keane. Students charged
that onlookers laughed and cheered
Keane on as he attacked the women
but did not come to the victims' aid.
Cole investigated the bystander al
legation to determine whether stu
dents violated the Fundamental Stan
dard, the University's official code of
behavior. She concluded, after inter
viewing more than 20 students who
attended the Beta party, that on
lookers did not know what was hap
pening and did not laugh at the
women when Keane grabbed them.
"Have I identified bystanders who
were amused by the women's distress
and chose not to come to their aid?
The answer is no. Do I believe that
such bystanders exist and that I have
simply failed to identify them? The
answer is that 1 am not entirely sure.
If I had to choose a more definite
response, then I would say no."
Freshmen Charlotte Lowson and
Cathy Zerboni, two of the women
who filed charges against Keane. said
yesterday that they are dissatisfied
with Cole's findings. "The report
negates everything that happened,"
Lowson said.
Cole's report does negate much of

what the two women say occurred,
but Cole said she feels the women re
ported their perceptions honestly.
"I do not doubt for a moment the
sincerity of their reports," she wrote.
"They do not, however, square with
the observations of at least a dozen
other students who were on the stairs
or on the periphery of the dance
floor" at the Beta house.
Lowson and Zerboni said Keane
had grabbed Lowson, tried to rip her
shirt off and struggled with her for at
least five minutes. But Cole con
cluded that Keane had grabbed hold

of Lowson while falling, that "he was
not . . . attempting to remove her
clothing" and that the entire event
took "two minutes or less."
"In a state of perceived peril, one
experiences time as passing very, very
slowly," Cole said.
Lowson and Zerboni said on
lookers laughed and cheered as Low
son struggled with Keane. Cole con
cluded, however, that "there was
laughing and perhaps even cheering"
but that it was "directed at a drunken

student (Keane) who was making a
fool of himself, not at the plight of the

Lowson called the report "an un
