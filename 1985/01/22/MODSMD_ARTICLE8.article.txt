64 die in Reno airplane crash
RENO, Nev. — A chartered turboprop carrying people home from a
gambling junket crashed and burned just after takeoff yesterday as the
pilot tried to return to the airport because of vibrations, killing 64 people
on board. Three passengers survived.
Galaxy Airlines Flight 203, a four-engine Lockheed Electra 188,
crashed in a field and slid onto a four-lane highway after narrowly mis
sing motels and apartment buildings. The plane had taken off at 1:05
a.m. PST bound for Minneapolis on a charter by Caesars Tahoe Resort-
Hotel of Stateline, a subsidiary of Caesars World Inc.
The plane was the same one that had been used by both the Rev. Jesse
Jackson and Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio) during their unsuccessful cam
paigns for the presidency. Jackson said the plane had once been ordered
grounded at Dallas after flying through a storm.
The Galaxy crash was the worst in the United States since a Pan
American World Airways jet crashed in Kenner, La., on July 9, 1982,
killing 153 people, including eight people on the ground.
"If somebody hadn't told me that it was an airplane, I wouldn't have
known what it was. You can't recognize any part of the wreckage," Gov.
Richard Bryan said after flying over the crash site near Reno Cannon In
ternational Airport.
Four people on the ground suffered minor injuries, said Washoe
County Sheriff Vince Swinney. The cause of their injuries was not imme
diately known.
Two other Electras used as cargo planes have crashed in the past year,
killing a total of seven people.
At least one Minnesota couple decided not to take the flight at the last
minute.
Bruce Laxalt, an attorney representing the airline said there were 67
people aboard the plane, five of them crew members. In all, 64 people
died, including the entire crew, and three passengers survived, he said.
Violence reported in S.F. parade
SAN FRANCISCO — Jamming sidewalks and perching on
skyscraper window sills, more than 500,000 fans of the San Francisco
49ers cheered their Super Bowl champions yesterday during a joyful
parade through the City.
Although the size of the crowd was similar to the one that gathered for
the parade three years ago after the 49ers Super Bowl XVI victory,
there was little of the rowdiness or clashes with police that marred that
day.
Officials this time abandoned the City Hall ceremony where most of
the problems occurred in 1982. Several thousand fans went there
anyway in anticipation of a ceremony and were sent away by police.
There were a few isolated incidents of violence and robbery, and
about a dozen arrests, according to police spokeswoman Carri Lucas.
About six people were arrested for strong-armed robbery, she said, and
most of the others were arrested for public drunkenness.
About 20 people pounced on two parked cars near City Hall, smash
ing windows and breaking roofs about an hour after the parade ended.
There were no arrests at those incidents.
A man was arrested for attempted murder after he stabbed four
people in front of City Hall. Officer Lucas said the suspect, Joseph
Armstrong, 46, stabbed a man in the back whom he thought was wearing
his stolen 49ers hat, then stabbed three other men who intervened.
Three of the stabbing victims were admitted to San Francisco General
Hospital, where they were listed in good condition. The fourth victim
was released after treatment.
A television cameraman also was slightly injured. Paul Stojanovich,
28, was hit in the head, police said, when his $20,000 KRON-TV
camera and video pack were stolen outside City Hall.
Icy cold grips half of U.S.
The death toll blamed on arctic weather reached 76 as subzero tem
peratures and icy winds gripped the eastern half of the nation from
Texas to New England again yesterday, making it the coldest day on the
books in more than 20 cities.
In New Orleans, power was briefly cut to 70,000 homes and busi
nesses when generators froze. In Florida, where temperatures dropped
into the teens, citrus growers irrigated their groves through the night for
protection but officials said thousands of trees may have been lost. And
in the nation's capital, inaugural celebrations were forced indoors by the
cold for only the second time in history.
"All I can say is 'Brrrr,'" said Bob Gager of the National Weather
Service in Pomona, N.J.
More than 80 records were set in the Southeast and East for the
coldest temperature for the date. Twenty-three of those records were
the coldest temperatures ever recorded including 4 below zero in
Athens, Ga., and 16 below zero in Asheville, N.C.
Weather-related deaths — including those from traffic accidents on
icy roads, exposure and fires blamed on makeshift heaters — were re
ported in 15 states since Friday, when the storms began.
The death toll rose yesterday, as two men were found frozen to death
outdoors in Buffalo, N.Y., while two others were found dead in an un
heated building on New York City's Lower East Side. Other deaths re
ported yesterday included two people dead of hypothermia in the Tulsa,
Okla., area; an elderly Jacksonville, Fla., couple who died in a fire
started by an electric heater placed too close to their beds; and two
people discovered dead of apparent hypothermia in their Milton, Fla.,
homes.
80 injured in train collision
GARY, Ind. — A South Shore Line train packed with commuters
slammed into another commuter train during the rush hour yesterday,
injuring at least 80 people, authorities said.
The injured from both South Shore Line trains were taken to three
hospitals after the 6:52 p.m. crash between stops in Gary, officials said.
One of the trains left Chicago at 5:58 p.m. with eight cars "full of pas
sengers," and was scheduled to terminate in Michigan City, Ind., said
Jeannie Sobkowiak, a spokeswoman for the South Shore Line.
That train hit a three-car Chicago-bound train, said Clyde Forbes, a
spokesman for the commuter line.
About 50 people were taken to Methodist Hospital in Gary, said
spokeswoman Pam Roth. "To be honest, we're inundated," she said.
At St. Mary Medical Center, 27 people were being treated, said
Jimmie Seay, and none was badly hurt.
Court protects scenic rivers
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court, rejecting pleas from water
agencies and agricultural groups, yesterday let stand a ruling allowing
major portions of five undeveloped rivers in Northern California to
remain protected under federal wild and scenic rivers laws.
The justices, in a brief order, refused to disturb a decision issued last
May by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals approving inclusion of
1,250 miles of the Eel, Trinity, American, Klamath and Smith rivers in
the federal system and thus protecting them from commercial develop
ment.
Former Secretary of the Interior Cecil Andrus, acting at the request of
former California Gov. Edmund Brown Jr.. had designated the rivers for
the national system in the final hours of the Carter administration in Jan
uary 1981.
Andrus" action was challenged by a group of Northern California
counties, farm and business groups and water agencies. A federal district
judge set aside the designation on the ground it failed to allow for suffi
cient time for public comment. But the appeals court reversed, finding any
rule violations were only "insignificant" and "trivial."
The Association of California Water Agencies and other foes of inclu
sion took the case to the Supreme Court (Association of California
Water Agencies vs. U.S., 84-544), contending that action was done im
properly and would effectively shift more than 30 percent of California's
natural water supply to federal control. The action would severely
hamper future water projects that could serve California's agricultural,
hydroelectric and other economic needs, they said.

American World Airways jet crashed in Kenner, La., on July 9, 1982,
killing 153 people, including eight people on the ground.
"If somebody hadn't told me that it was an airplane, I wouldn't have
known what it was. You can't recognize any part of the wreckage," Gov.
Richard Bryan said after flying over the crash site near Reno Cannon In
ternational Airport.
Four people on the ground suffered minor injuries, said Washoe
County Sheriff Vince Swinney. The cause of their injuries was not imme
diately known.
Two other Electras used as cargo planes have crashed in the past year,
killing a total of seven people.
At least one Minnesota couple decided not to take the flight at the last
minute.
Bruce Laxalt, an attorney representing the airline said there were 67
people aboard the plane, five of them crew members. In all, 64 people
died, including the entire crew, and three passengers survived, he said.
Violence reported in S.F. parade
SAN FRANCISCO — Jamming sidewalks and perching on
skyscraper window sills, more than 500,000 fans of the San Francisco
49ers cheered their Super Bowl champions yesterday during a joyful
parade through the City.
Although the size of the crowd was similar to the one that gathered for
the parade three years ago after the 49ers Super Bowl XVI victory,
there was little of the rowdiness or clashes with police that marred that
day.
Officials this time abandoned the City Hall ceremony where most of
the problems occurred in 1982. Several thousand fans went there
anyway in anticipation of a ceremony and were sent away by police.
There were a few isolated incidents of violence and robbery, and
about a dozen arrests, according to police spokeswoman Carri Lucas.
About six people were arrested for strong-armed robbery, she said, and
most of the others were arrested for public drunkenness.
About 20 people pounced on two parked cars near City Hall, smash
ing windows and breaking roofs about an hour after the parade ended.
There were no arrests at those incidents.
A man was arrested for attempted murder after he stabbed four
people in front of City Hall. Officer Lucas said the suspect, Joseph
Armstrong, 46, stabbed a man in the back whom he thought was wearing
his stolen 49ers hat, then stabbed three other men who intervened.
Three of the stabbing victims were admitted to San Francisco General
Hospital, where they were listed in good condition. The fourth victim
was released after treatment.
A television cameraman also was slightly injured. Paul Stojanovich,
28, was hit in the head, police said, when his $20,000 KRON-TV
camera and video pack were stolen outside City Hall.
Icy cold grips half of U.S.
The death toll blamed on arctic weather reached 76 as subzero tem
peratures and icy winds gripped the eastern half of the nation from
Texas to New England again yesterday, making it the coldest day on the
books in more than 20 cities.
In New Orleans, power was briefly cut to 70,000 homes and busi
nesses when generators froze. In Florida, where temperatures dropped
into the teens, citrus growers irrigated their groves through the night for
protection but officials said thousands of trees may have been lost. And
in the nation's capital, inaugural celebrations were forced indoors by the
cold for only the second time in history.
"All I can say is 'Brrrr,'" said Bob Gager of the National Weather
Service in Pomona, N.J.
More than 80 records were set in the Southeast and East for the
coldest temperature for the date. Twenty-three of those records were
the coldest temperatures ever recorded including 4 below zero in
Athens, Ga., and 16 below zero in Asheville, N.C.
Weather-related deaths — including those from traffic accidents on
icy roads, exposure and fires blamed on makeshift heaters — were re
ported in 15 states since Friday, when the storms began.
The death toll rose yesterday, as two men were found frozen to death
outdoors in Buffalo, N.Y., while two others were found dead in an un
heated building on New York City's Lower East Side. Other deaths re
ported yesterday included two people dead of hypothermia in the Tulsa,
Okla., area; an elderly Jacksonville, Fla., couple who died in a fire
started by an electric heater placed too close to their beds; and two
people discovered dead of apparent hypothermia in their Milton, Fla.,
homes.
80 injured in train collision
GARY, Ind. — A South Shore Line train packed with commuters
slammed into another commuter train during the rush hour yesterday,
injuring at least 80 people, authorities said.
The injured from both South Shore Line trains were taken to three
hospitals after the 6:52 p.m. crash between stops in Gary, officials said.
One of the trains left Chicago at 5:58 p.m. with eight cars "full of pas
sengers," and was scheduled to terminate in Michigan City, Ind., said
Jeannie Sobkowiak, a spokeswoman for the South Shore Line.
That train hit a three-car Chicago-bound train, said Clyde Forbes, a
spokesman for the commuter line.
About 50 people were taken to Methodist Hospital in Gary, said
spokeswoman Pam Roth. "To be honest, we're inundated," she said.
At St. Mary Medical Center, 27 people were being treated, said
Jimmie Seay, and none was badly hurt.
Court protects scenic rivers
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court, rejecting pleas from water
agencies and agricultural groups, yesterday let stand a ruling allowing
major portions of five undeveloped rivers in Northern California to
remain protected under federal wild and scenic rivers laws.
The justices, in a brief order, refused to disturb a decision issued last
May by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals approving inclusion of
1,250 miles of the Eel, Trinity, American, Klamath and Smith rivers in
the federal system and thus protecting them from commercial develop
ment.
Former Secretary of the Interior Cecil Andrus, acting at the request of
former California Gov. Edmund Brown Jr.. had designated the rivers for
the national system in the final hours of the Carter administration in Jan
uary 1981.
Andrus" action was challenged by a group of Northern California
counties, farm and business groups and water agencies. A federal district
judge set aside the designation on the ground it failed to allow for suffi
cient time for public comment. But the appeals court reversed, finding any
rule violations were only "insignificant" and "trivial."
The Association of California Water Agencies and other foes of inclu
sion took the case to the Supreme Court (Association of California
Water Agencies vs. U.S., 84-544), contending that action was done im
properly and would effectively shift more than 30 percent of California's
natural water supply to federal control. The action would severely
hamper future water projects that could serve California's agricultural,
hydroelectric and other economic needs, they said.

64 die in Reno airplane crash
RENO, Nev. — A chartered turboprop carrying people home from a
gambling junket crashed and burned just after takeoff yesterday as the
pilot tried to return to the airport because of vibrations, killing 64 people
on board. Three passengers survived.
Galaxy Airlines Flight 203, a four-engine Lockheed Electra 188,
crashed in a field and slid onto a four-lane highway after narrowly mis
sing motels and apartment buildings. The plane had taken off at 1:05
a.m. PST bound for Minneapolis on a charter by Caesars Tahoe Resort-
Hotel of Stateline, a subsidiary of Caesars World Inc.
The plane was the same one that had been used by both the Rev. Jesse
Jackson and Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio) during their unsuccessful cam
paigns for the presidency. Jackson said the plane had once been ordered
grounded at Dallas after flying through a storm.
