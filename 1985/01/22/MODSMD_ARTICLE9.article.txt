# Reagan returns to past themes

### 
WASHINGTON — President
Reagan returned yesterday to the
images and ideology of his political
past as he presented a vision of a
peaceful and prosperous future in
which the United States remains the
"last, best hope of man on Earth."
This description of America,
originally Abraham Lincoln's, was
first used by Reagan in 1964 in the
closing passage of the speech that
made him famous — his nationally
televised appeal in behalf of Republi
can presidential candidate Barr\
Goldwater.
Many of Reagan's phrases in his
second and last inaugural addreas
echoed the speeches for which he is
best remembered. Speaking of the
need for "hard decisions" and who
should make them. Reagan repeated
words he wrote for his inauguration
as governor of California in 1967: " II
not us, who? If not now, when?"
And in calling upon his
countrymen to "challenge the limits
of growth," Reagan returned to the
theme of everyday Americans as
heroes that provided the focus of his
first presidential inaugural speech
four years ago.
"We must think anew and move
with a new boldness, so every Ameri
can who seeks work can find work; so
the least among us shall have an equal
chance to achieve the greatest things
— to be heroes who heal our sick,
feed the hungry, protect peace among
nations and leave this world a better
place," Reagan said.
But the speech Reagan gave yes
terday was in other respects vastly
different from that of the first In
auguration.
"There's a considerable difference
in being president for a few minutes
and for four years," said Ben Elliott,
chief of the speech-writing team who
prepared drafts for Reagan that were
reworked in longhand by the presi
dent.
Reagan's speech, which was inter
rupted 11 times by applause, united
the rhetoric of free enterprise he has
been using since the early 1950s
when he was a touring speaker for

General Electric with the favorite
programs of his presidency: limits on
domestic government spending, con
tinuance of a strong defense and con
stitutional amendments banning
abortion and mandating a balanced
federal budget.
\rms-control message
On the eve of arms-control
negotiations with the Soviets that he
claimed offered the promise of total
elimination of nuclear weapons,
Reagan was unrelenting, though
careful in his rhetoric, in his view of
the rival superpower.
"There are those in this world who
scorn our vision of human dignity and
freedom," he said. "One nation, the
Soviet Union, has conducted the
greatest military buildup in the his
tory of man, building arsenals of
awesome, offensive weapons."
Reagan was equally unrelenting in
making the case for the futuristic and
much-criticized proposal to protect
the United States by "a security
shield . . . that will destroy nuclear
missiles before they reach their tar
get."
This idea, formally known as the
Strategic Defense Initiative, and of
ten called "Star Wars," has cap
tivated Reagan, and aides said he in
sisted on including a central reference
to it in his inaugural speech.
People must "follow dreams"
Apart from these specifics,
Reagan's speech yesterday was a
recapitulation of the basic ideas of in
dividualistic freedom from which he
has rarely deviated in 20 years of
public life.
The economy should be "freed
from government's grip." People
must be "free to follow their
dreams." The United States "must
remain freedom's staunchest friend
for freedom is our best ally and it is
the world's only hope to conquer
poverty and preserve peace."
The speech was woven throughout
with the inspirational phrases de-

signed to identify Reagan with the
aspirations and values of an America,
which Reagan said has "lighted the
world with our inventions, gone to
the aid of . . . mankind wherever in
the world there was a cry for help,
journeyed to the moon and safely
returned."
Other evocative Reaganisms sprin
kled throughout the speech included
depictions of America as "a rising na
tion," "poised for greatness," and a
country on the verge of "a new
American emancipation."
"Let history say of us, these were
golden years when the American
revolution was reborn, when freedom
gained new life and America reached
for its best," Reagan said.
Reagan yesterday was preoccupied
with American history as well as his
own.
"History is a ribbon, always unfurl
ing; history is a journey," he said.
"And as we continue our journey, we

think of those who traveled before
us."
The next passage of the speech,
originally scheduled for delivery on
the West Front of the Capitol, called
for Reagan to say that "we stand
again at the steps of this symbol of
our democracy."
Reagan read this line, became
aware of what he had said and made a
typically impromptu revision, adding
with a smile, "or we would have been
standing at the steps if it hadn't got
ten so cold. Now we're standing
inside this symbol of our democracy."
In a quiet ceremony attended only
by family and friends at the White
House on Saturday, Reagan and Vice
President George Bush took the con
stitutional oath to begin their second
term of office. The simple ceremony
lasted only one minute and was per
formed in order to meet the Jan. 20
inaugural date specified by law.

ing; history is a journey," he said.
"And as we continue our journey, we

think of those who traveled before
us."
The next passage of the speech,
originally scheduled for delivery on
the West Front of the Capitol, called
for Reagan to say that "we stand
again at the steps of this symbol of
our democracy."
Reagan read this line, became
aware of what he had said and made a
typically impromptu revision, adding
with a smile, "or we would have been
standing at the steps if it hadn't got
ten so cold. Now we're standing
inside this symbol of our democracy."
In a quiet ceremony attended only
by family and friends at the White
House on Saturday, Reagan and Vice
President George Bush took the con
stitutional oath to begin their second
term of office. The simple ceremony
lasted only one minute and was per
formed in order to meet the Jan. 20
inaugural date specified by law.

WASHINGTON — President
Reagan returned yesterday to the
images and ideology of his political
past as he presented a vision of a
peaceful and prosperous future in
which the United States remains the
"last, best hope of man on Earth."
This description of America,
originally Abraham Lincoln's, was
first used by Reagan in 1964 in the
closing passage of the speech that
made him famous — his nationally
televised appeal in behalf of Republi
can presidential candidate Barr\
Goldwater.
Many of Reagan's phrases in his
second and last inaugural addreas
echoed the speeches for which he is
best remembered. Speaking of the
need for "hard decisions" and who
should make them. Reagan repeated
words he wrote for his inauguration
as governor of California in 1967: " II
not us, who? If not now, when?"
And in calling upon his
countrymen to "challenge the limits
of growth," Reagan returned to the
theme of everyday Americans as
heroes that provided the focus of his
first presidential inaugural speech
four years ago.
"We must think anew and move
with a new boldness, so every Ameri
can who seeks work can find work; so
the least among us shall have an equal
chance to achieve the greatest things
— to be heroes who heal our sick,
feed the hungry, protect peace among
nations and leave this world a better
place," Reagan said.
But the speech Reagan gave yes
terday was in other respects vastly
different from that of the first In
auguration.
"There's a considerable difference
in being president for a few minutes
and for four years," said Ben Elliott,
chief of the speech-writing team who
prepared drafts for Reagan that were
reworked in longhand by the presi
dent.
Reagan's speech, which was inter
rupted 11 times by applause, united
the rhetoric of free enterprise he has
been using since the early 1950s
when he was a touring speaker for

General Electric with the favorite
programs of his presidency: limits on
domestic government spending, con
tinuance of a strong defense and con
stitutional amendments banning
abortion and mandating a balanced
federal budget.
\rms-control message
On the eve of arms-control
negotiations with the Soviets that he
claimed offered the promise of total
elimination of nuclear weapons,
Reagan was unrelenting, though
careful in his rhetoric, in his view of
the rival superpower.
"There are those in this world who
scorn our vision of human dignity and
freedom," he said. "One nation, the
Soviet Union, has conducted the
greatest military buildup in the his
tory of man, building arsenals of
awesome, offensive weapons."
Reagan was equally unrelenting in
making the case for the futuristic and
much-criticized proposal to protect
the United States by "a security
shield . . . that will destroy nuclear
missiles before they reach their tar
get."
This idea, formally known as the
Strategic Defense Initiative, and of
ten called "Star Wars," has cap
tivated Reagan, and aides said he in
sisted on including a central reference
to it in his inaugural speech.
People must "follow dreams"
Apart from these specifics,
Reagan's speech yesterday was a
recapitulation of the basic ideas of in
dividualistic freedom from which he
has rarely deviated in 20 years of
public life.
The economy should be "freed
from government's grip." People
must be "free to follow their
dreams." The United States "must
remain freedom's staunchest friend
for freedom is our best ally and it is
the world's only hope to conquer
poverty and preserve peace."
The speech was woven throughout
with the inspirational phrases de-

signed to identify Reagan with the
aspirations and values of an America,
which Reagan said has "lighted the
world with our inventions, gone to
the aid of . . . mankind wherever in
the world there was a cry for help,
journeyed to the moon and safely
returned."
Other evocative Reaganisms sprin
kled throughout the speech included
depictions of America as "a rising na
tion," "poised for greatness," and a
country on the verge of "a new
American emancipation."
"Let history say of us, these were
golden years when the American
revolution was reborn, when freedom
gained new life and America reached
for its best," Reagan said.
Reagan yesterday was preoccupied
with American history as well as his
own.
"History is a ribbon, always unfurl
ing; history is a journey," he said.
"And as we continue our journey, we

think of those who traveled before
us."
