# Co-ops rally for support
## 
### BAIE NETZER Senior staff writer 
Expecting a decision this week
from the Office of Residential Educa
tion on whether to close one or more
of six University co-ops, students
rallied in White Plaza yesterday after
noon to gain support for maintaining
cooperative living on campus.
Residents of the six campus co-ops
— Terra, Columbae, Theta Chi,
Synergy, Phi Psi and Hammarskjold
— gathered in White Plaza yesterday
to "show the University that co-ops
are a really important part of Resi
dential Education," according to
Synergy resident Laurie Wedemeyer.
Following musical performances by
co-op residents Gary Worsham,
Helen Casabona and Steve Whitney,
three brief speeches were given and
students attending the rally were
invited to help paint a mural in sup
port of cooperative living.
John Hackmann, a former resident
assistant at Synergy, spoke at the
rally, praising the co-ops for
"attempting the most herculean of
tasks."
"They integrate decision making,
self-reliance, different political values
and a celebration of life," Hackmann
said.
Responding to Res Ed's concern
that co-ops tend not to fill in the first
round of the Draw, Hackmann told
those at the rally that living in co-ops
is so different from the dorm experi
ence, "Sometimes people feel it's too
different for them."
"But there's really every type in a
co-op," he said.

Lee Altenberg, an eating associate
at Synergy and Columbae. also spoke
at the rally, citing one reason for
living in a co-op as the amount of
money that could be saved.
"There seems to be an idea floating
around that co-ops are some sort of
experiment that idealistic people are
willing to put themselves through
while in college," Altenberg said.
According to Altenberg, living in a
co-op is 30-percent less expensive
than living in a so-called "self-op,"
which hires a cook.
"Living in a co-op is like having a
part-time job that pays nine dollars
an hour," Altenberg said. "It's much
cheaper than living in a dorm."
In order to encourage other stu
dents to explore the option of living
in a co-op, Wedemeyer and others
passed out coupons yesterday after
noon for free meals at any of the six
co-ops.
"The co-ops add definite diversity
to the University," Wedemeyer said.
"And for some people, they would
only be happy in a co-op."
Wedemeyer said the co-ops were
particularly attractive to vegetarians,
because, he said. University Food
Service expects students to pay for
more expensive foods, such as meat,
even if they eat only vegetarian
meals.
Senior Amy Hecht, a resident of
Columbae, said she thought co-ops
do not have as much trouble gaining
residents as some theme houses.
"We didn't have as hard a time this
