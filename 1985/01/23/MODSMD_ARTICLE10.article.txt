## Wanderings Merrily, merrily, Marilyn joins crew 
### MARILYN WANN 
With 49er fever spreading plague
like across the land and student spec
tators lining up before TV screens
and mounds of diet -destroying
Doritos last week, it was high time for
this football apathist to find an
equally attractive Super Bowl substi
tute.
I was avoiding both the temptation
to buy tacky souvenirs for all my
second cousins and the urge to un
earth the piles of homework under
my latest Daily assignment — "Do
women's crew."
It seemed like a good solution —
greet the sun with a few rousing
morning workouts and take a pleas
ant cruise of an evening, right?
Wrong.
Coach John Davis described his
sport as "committing athletic
suicide."
Junior Jeff Urdan of the men's
crew used the phrase "medieval
torture."
I found the word "aaargh" quite
fitting, to which I added a list of quite
louder exclamations when my alarm
clock started ringing at hours in the
single digits. (Did you know it's still
dark out at 6 a.m.? That constitutes
nighttime, doesn't it?)
The 19-member crew (17 rowers
and two coxswains) bounced through
a warm-up that left me beached on
the floor of Encina Gym, ostensibly
scribbling quotes in my notebook.
They went on to log an hour of
weightlifting.
According to Davis, women have
to spend more time in the weight
room than men to get "bulky-type
strong."
By that comparison, I'd have to live
there in that room in order to catch
up.
Davis spoke with a coach's usual
gusto for his sport, saying, "You're
pulling a tug of war 36 times a minute
in a race. Afterward, if a doctor
could take your carbon dioxide level,
you should probably be dead.
"You can't see. You can't hear.
Your face goes numb. It's a real sense
of power," he said. "A rowing shell is
the fastest thing on water besides a
motor boat."
Davis then explained the terms
used in crew, leaving me disentan
gling definitions like a tourist in
Tijuana looking for a bathroom.
A boat, or rather, a shell, is
propelled by sweeps, not oars.
Sweeps are also a racing configura
tion in which each oarsman (at least
they don't call themselves
sweepsmen) uses only one sweep.

Sculling is another form using two
sweeps per person, requiring more
finesse than the power of sweeps.
After this not-too-convincing tes
timony, I needed Davis' encourage
ment that crew is the perfect sport for
walk-ons. I also wanted to experience
the phenomenon of "swing" that
takes over a boat when all the rowers'
motions are in unison and the shell
lifts up in the water and flies at 12 or
1 3 mph.
"It's like John Paye throwing 400
hits in a row," said Davis, searching
for a proper equivalent. "It's like
searching for nirvana."
I approached the Stanford crew
boathouse in Redwood City with a
picture of myself tossing a football to
a Zen master sitting in a lotus. My
idea of the coxswain's job, which I
would soon be asked to try, was not
very complete.
While waiting for the crew mem
bers, I toured the corrugated metal
building that houses rows of shells
along its walls like an aquarium for

dormant sharks of varying sizes —
pirhana-like doubles, sleek fours and
killer-whale eights.
There are long whites, made of the
carbon-fiber sandwich used in Boeing
767 wings and the kevlar in bullet

I saw my chance for sports glory — the first coxswain to
have a crew mutiny and be forced to swim back to the
dock.

proof vests, and feral brown ones like
the Valkyrie, the collection's center
piece eight-man shell, with its
Nigerian Tiger Wood hull, butternut
seats and American ash timbers.
Crew is an "equipment intensive"
sport, with eights costing more than
$10,000, and care for them is part of
the discipline of the athletes, accord

ing to Davis.
When four crew members arrived
to take the boat down, one joked
about using the "Samsonite method,"
but after 10 minutes of careful
maneuvering they eased it into the

water without any gorilla paw marks.
Davis reinforced this respect for
equipment as I was stepping shakily
into my stern position as coxswain,
saying, "Be sure not to put your
weight on the inside walls of the shell;
they're only an eighth of an inch thick
and your foot will break through and
sink the boat."

I almost left then, but I wanted to
see if I could learn the mystical con
trol a good coxswain must have over
the oarsmen.
The idea of having a coxswain is for
steering, since the rowers sit back-

ward in the shell, and for giving clear
commands to keep all the actions
coordinated.
I saw this as my chance for sports
glory — the first coxswain to have a
crew mutiny and be forced to swim
back to the dock.
Actually, I was pretty safe until
Davis explained the two steering

ropes. Then I started to practice
"writing my name with the wake," a
trait frowned on for coxswains be
cause it is usually faster to row a
straight line than a crooked one.
My commands were firm enough
because crew captain Barbara
Holdran dictated them to me from
her seat at the "stroke" position
facing me.
Maybe it's because of the two-part
motion of the oars, but crew com
mands seem to come in two-word
groupings. The strangest example of
this is how "stop" is translated to
"way enough."
If you think that looks funny in
print, you should try shouting it in a
deserted estuary loudly enough to be
heard by four straining athletes and
several sleepy birds.
After about 30 minutes of freezing
my hands in the wind-chill factor, I
felt that even the best E-ticket ride at
Disneyland must end sometime.
My heroic return to firm land was
made possible by a few strategic
nudges from Davis' motor-powered
boat after I overshot the dock.
The Creek, as crew members
sometimes call the practice site, is no
Lake Casitas (at one time crew mem
bers had to get gammaglobulin shots
before going on the water), but my
next phase of training was drastically
less scenic.
I returned to Encina Gym to ride
the ergometer, a machine which sim
ulates the rowing motion and was
once called the er-vomiter by a
novice rower.
The idea, I think, is to get the effect
of two hours of aerobics in 15
minutes.
Urdan coached me on how to ap
proach his "torture device."
Compress into fetal position at the
start and drive hard with legs, con
tinuing to pull with the arms, collaps
ing back, letting the handle pull you
forward.
"See if you can get to 35 mph," he
urged. When I reached that level for a
grand total of about six strokes and
was picturing the enjoyment a
chiropractor would get watching me
wrench my vertebrae around, Urdan
chortled through an evil grin and said,
"Now try 40."
At that instant my journalistic
desire for thorough reporting gave
out, along with the major muscles in
all my limbs.
I went murmuring "way enough"
all the way back to my dorm, and I
think I hibernated through the Super
Bowl.
So who won anyway?

and two coxswains) bounced through
a warm-up that left me beached on
the floor of Encina Gym, ostensibly
scribbling quotes in my notebook.
They went on to log an hour of
weightlifting.
According to Davis, women have
to spend more time in the weight
room than men to get "bulky-type
strong."
By that comparison, I'd have to live
there in that room in order to catch
up.
Davis spoke with a coach's usual
gusto for his sport, saying, "You're
pulling a tug of war 36 times a minute
in a race. Afterward, if a doctor
could take your carbon dioxide level,
you should probably be dead.
"You can't see. You can't hear.
Your face goes numb. It's a real sense
of power," he said. "A rowing shell is
the fastest thing on water besides a
motor boat."
Davis then explained the terms
used in crew, leaving me disentan
gling definitions like a tourist in
Tijuana looking for a bathroom.
A boat, or rather, a shell, is
propelled by sweeps, not oars.
Sweeps are also a racing configura
tion in which each oarsman (at least
they don't call themselves
sweepsmen) uses only one sweep.

Sculling is another form using two
sweeps per person, requiring more
finesse than the power of sweeps.
After this not-too-convincing tes
timony, I needed Davis' encourage
ment that crew is the perfect sport for
walk-ons. I also wanted to experience
the phenomenon of "swing" that
takes over a boat when all the rowers'
motions are in unison and the shell
lifts up in the water and flies at 12 or
1 3 mph.
"It's like John Paye throwing 400
hits in a row," said Davis, searching
for a proper equivalent. "It's like
searching for nirvana."
I approached the Stanford crew
boathouse in Redwood City with a
picture of myself tossing a football to
a Zen master sitting in a lotus. My
idea of the coxswain's job, which I
would soon be asked to try, was not
very complete.
While waiting for the crew mem
bers, I toured the corrugated metal
building that houses rows of shells
along its walls like an aquarium for

dormant sharks of varying sizes —
pirhana-like doubles, sleek fours and
killer-whale eights.
There are long whites, made of the
carbon-fiber sandwich used in Boeing
767 wings and the kevlar in bullet

I saw my chance for sports glory — the first coxswain to
have a crew mutiny and be forced to swim back to the
dock.

proof vests, and feral brown ones like
the Valkyrie, the collection's center
piece eight-man shell, with its
Nigerian Tiger Wood hull, butternut
seats and American ash timbers.
Crew is an "equipment intensive"
sport, with eights costing more than
$10,000, and care for them is part of
the discipline of the athletes, accord

ing to Davis.
When four crew members arrived
to take the boat down, one joked
about using the "Samsonite method,"
but after 10 minutes of careful
maneuvering they eased it into the

water without any gorilla paw marks.
Davis reinforced this respect for
equipment as I was stepping shakily
into my stern position as coxswain,
saying, "Be sure not to put your
weight on the inside walls of the shell;
they're only an eighth of an inch thick
and your foot will break through and
sink the boat."

I almost left then, but I wanted to
see if I could learn the mystical con
trol a good coxswain must have over
the oarsmen.
The idea of having a coxswain is for
steering, since the rowers sit back-

ward in the shell, and for giving clear
commands to keep all the actions
coordinated.
I saw this as my chance for sports
glory — the first coxswain to have a
crew mutiny and be forced to swim
back to the dock.
Actually, I was pretty safe until
Davis explained the two steering

ropes. Then I started to practice
"writing my name with the wake," a
trait frowned on for coxswains be
cause it is usually faster to row a
straight line than a crooked one.
My commands were firm enough
because crew captain Barbara
Holdran dictated them to me from
her seat at the "stroke" position
facing me.
Maybe it's because of the two-part
motion of the oars, but crew com
mands seem to come in two-word
groupings. The strangest example of
this is how "stop" is translated to
"way enough."
If you think that looks funny in
print, you should try shouting it in a
deserted estuary loudly enough to be
heard by four straining athletes and
several sleepy birds.
After about 30 minutes of freezing
my hands in the wind-chill factor, I
felt that even the best E-ticket ride at
Disneyland must end sometime.
My heroic return to firm land was
made possible by a few strategic
nudges from Davis' motor-powered
boat after I overshot the dock.
The Creek, as crew members
sometimes call the practice site, is no
Lake Casitas (at one time crew mem
bers had to get gammaglobulin shots
before going on the water), but my
next phase of training was drastically
less scenic.
I returned to Encina Gym to ride
the ergometer, a machine which sim
ulates the rowing motion and was
once called the er-vomiter by a
novice rower.
The idea, I think, is to get the effect
of two hours of aerobics in 15
minutes.
Urdan coached me on how to ap
proach his "torture device."
Compress into fetal position at the
start and drive hard with legs, con
tinuing to pull with the arms, collaps
ing back, letting the handle pull you
forward.
"See if you can get to 35 mph," he
urged. When I reached that level for a
grand total of about six strokes and
was picturing the enjoyment a
chiropractor would get watching me
wrench my vertebrae around, Urdan
chortled through an evil grin and said,
"Now try 40."
At that instant my journalistic
desire for thorough reporting gave
out, along with the major muscles in
all my limbs.
I went murmuring "way enough"
all the way back to my dorm, and I
think I hibernated through the Super
Bowl.
So who won anyway?

With 49er fever spreading plague
like across the land and student spec
tators lining up before TV screens
and mounds of diet -destroying
Doritos last week, it was high time for
this football apathist to find an
equally attractive Super Bowl substi
tute.
I was avoiding both the temptation
to buy tacky souvenirs for all my
second cousins and the urge to un
earth the piles of homework under
my latest Daily assignment — "Do
women's crew."
It seemed like a good solution —
greet the sun with a few rousing
morning workouts and take a pleas
ant cruise of an evening, right?
Wrong.
Coach John Davis described his
sport as "committing athletic
suicide."
Junior Jeff Urdan of the men's
crew used the phrase "medieval
torture."
I found the word "aaargh" quite
fitting, to which I added a list of quite
louder exclamations when my alarm
clock started ringing at hours in the
single digits. (Did you know it's still
dark out at 6 a.m.? That constitutes
nighttime, doesn't it?)
