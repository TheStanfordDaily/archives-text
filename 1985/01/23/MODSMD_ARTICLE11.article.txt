## The 						Stanford Daily Very little humor 
### 
There are harmless pranks and there are harm
ful pranks. Upon examination it is evident that
one fraternity stunt performed last week falls
neatly into the latter category.
Pledges from the Sigma Alpha Epsilon frater
nity brought a unique show to White Plaza last
Tuesday, powdering their faces and clothes with
flour and mocking the George Segal "Gay
Liberation" sculpture in what participants called
"Art Appreciation Day." One pledge wielded a
hammer, imitating the vandal who bludgeoned
"Gay Liberation" last year.
In short, this demonstration of idiocy is down
right offensive and most certainly not funny.
Other fraternities managed to think up some
hilarious stunts last week without insulting
anyone. Students engaging in synchronized swim
ming in the Claw, carrying life-size dummies
with them to classes and playing air guitar on the
bookstore steps provided amusement that was
not at the expense of specific groups.
In direct contrast to these innocuous stunts,
however, the SAE travesty elicited laughter at
the expense of Stanford's gay community. Public

derision is a poor context for humor, and the gay
community a poor object for derision.
The line between good and bad taste may be
fuzzy at times, but a homophobic public display
that tacitly condones violence is crass and inex
cusable.
SAE President John Peterson called the stunt a
"harmless imitation of a statue" and said it was
performed with "no malicious intent." He
apologized to those offended, saying that the
SAEs would not have carried through with the
prank had they known it was offensive.
But when insensitivity takes the form of public
ridicule, it matters little whether there was
"malicious intent."
Ironically, some passers-by associated the SAE
prank with a rally commemorating Martin L uther
King, Jr. that took place at the same time Tues
day in White Plaza. King struggled to rid the
world of prejudice, to create a world of love and
understanding. The values expressed by the sad
SAE stunt are clearly antithetical to those for
which King stood.
