Co-op diversity
Res Ed's decision on the fate of
co-op houses draws near. This deci
sion should reflect both the ideals
and goals of the University and the
opinions and needs of the students.
After living in Terra for a year and
managing it for two quarters, I have
ideas that should be considered
before reaching a final judgement.
Stanford University boasts that
one of its greatest qualities lies in its
diversity. It claims to have a hetero
geneous student body — students
from all states, varying lifestyles and
many differing ethnic backgrounds.
To maintain its diversity, Stanford
imposes a wide-ranging set of distri
bution requirements upon its stu
dents. Students have the option of
many differing majors. In addition,
Stanford offers a wide variety of
on-campus housing. This ranges
from dormitories and fraternities to
theme houses and student
cooperatives. Each provides a living
situation as unique as the student
body.
The University sees housing as a
very integral part of education. Per
haps a student can gain something
from his living experience besides a
room. If Stanford eliminates co-ops,
what effect does that have on
"supposed" diversity within the
University housing system? Is Stan
ford, by eliminating a co-op. saying
something negative about the unique
interests of the co-op residents? Is it
so awful that someone has to live in
a different situation? Stanford seems
to think forcing distribution require
ments is important. Why not a new
living arrangement? Perhaps the
experience will enlighten the student.
Perhaps good, perhaps bad, but the
student gains a new experience and
true knowledge of a new subject.
Co-ops. in themselves, are diverse
places. In Terra, the students differ
more than any other living situation I
have encountered. The house resi
dents include 10 graduate students
from different departments, 43 un
dergraduates and 15 eating as
sociates who participate in cooking
and social events. These eating as-

sociates add an "outside" element to
the house because they live else
where. This is not found in most
living arrangements. In addition to
its residents, the co-op offers a 24-
hour, fully open kitchen for those who
cannot fit meal times into their
schedules. The house manages itself
in finances, meals, cooking and
social programs. Cooperative living
forces people to work together for a
common goal. This can provide a
rare sense of community and unity
not found in most housing.
I entered a co-op as a result of a
very disappointing Draw number,
rather than by choice. However,
after expecting so little I was seren
dipitously delighted by the new living
arrangement. People's political
views, musical tastes, religious
beliefs, academic goals and hobbies
differed as much as I have ever
encountered. However, everyone
manages to get dinner prepared
every night and the bathrooms
cleaned every week. Another thing I
notice is how people who move out
of a co-op seem to return. Whether
they have graduated or moved across
campus, they return for a dinner or a
late-night bread. This behavior is not
common to most dorms. The sense
of community seems to grow each
year.
Stanford should let the student
body broaden itself by encouraging
students to live in co-ops just as it
encourages students to take classes,
outside their majors. Co-ops
broaden the minds of Stanford stu
dents as much or more than other
living situations. For the sake of
diversity at Stanford, keep the co
ops.

Not vigilantism
It was refreshing to hear San Fran
cisco Supervisor Carol Ruth Silver's
attitude toward the New York sub
way incident in which four muggers
were shot. Stating this takes courage.
Although several of her colleagues
came out against her, she still held
her position. She noted that obser-

vers immediately cried "vigilantism,"
meaning the taking of law into one's
own hands. We cannot, however, use
our favorite stock phrases to describe
every situation. If we do, we can
force any event to fit one of these
standard molds. We could be wrong,
though, if we only have a limited
number of them, say one or two. Life
isn't that simple. Perhaps if we con
sider that the man acted partially in
self-defense, as well as in vigilantism,
we might more clearly describe the
situation.
The arguments claiming that the
victim of the mugging was acting out
a fantasy to wipe out all thieves
seems reasonable. We could stop
here, but let's go on. Didn't it seem
like the man, in response to being
attacked, defended himself? It's true,
he may have been looking for trou
ble, but it is hard to believe that he
deliberately provoked, then at
tacked, the criminals. The action of
arming himself for protection against
harm could be considered as vigilan
tism. It could also be called self
defense. Policemen routinely
purchase weapons in anticipation of
being forced to defend themselves. Is
this reasonable? They do frequent
fairly tough neighborhoods. A
bicyclist often considers wearing a
helmet and gloves in case he has an
accident. It seems more open
minded to have the choice whether
to call these actions premeditation,
self-defense or both.
One may question, as San Fran
cisco Police Chief Con Murphy does,
the need to carry and use a weapon
for self-defense. A soldier, police
officer or secret agent keeps one, but
how about the ordinary person? As
noted by Supervisor Silver,
sometimes the streets are not safe.
Sometimes the police must wait for a
backup unit before even entering
the neighborhood. Sometimes they
are too late. The popular liberal
sentiment today is to give more
responsibilities (and rights) to the
government. We live in a civilized
world, and individuals shouldn't be
concerned about having to defend
themselves as they did in the Old
West or the Mother Lode. They

should pay attention to philosophy,
digital hardware design, statesman
ship and other "higher" pursuits.
Ideally, government will take up the
slack. Unfortunately, it has a hard
time and is often unsuccessful.
If parents are unable to care for
their children properly, the authori
ties often send the children to a
foster home. Even though it is or
dinarily more desirable for the
children's natural parents to care for
them, a different home may provide
better care. The same is true for the
government. Self-protection is not
vigilantism; it is simply provision of a
need from another source. Someone
has to take care of the children.

Why new weapons
In the modern military lexicon,
"force modernization" means
"continuation of the arms race."
Beware of doubletalk: disarmament
through more weapons.
Ralph Cossa (The Daily, Jan. 18)
argues against a freeze and for
modernization. His three main argu
ments are faulty. First, while it is
true that a freeze would stop moder
nization, it would not halt replace
ment of aging weapons by new ones
of the same type; it would introduce
no new instability. Modernization,
on the other hand, means deploying
highly accurate counterforce missiles.
These tempt the possessor to strike
first to at least partly disarm the
opponent, while tempting the op
ponent to strike first to prevent this
from happening. The new weaponry,
not the freeze, is destabilizing.
As for verification, a freeze is the
most verifiable agreement possible:
Any weapon test, any transportation
of bomb materials to or from the few
production sites that exist and any
transport of finished weapons to
deployment sites would be a viola
tion. Under any other agreement,
verification is more difficult, since
one must distinguish between
actions that are allowed and those
which are not. Testing of new

weaponry is relatively easy to detect;
allowing modernization through the
introduction of new weapons
foolishly throws away this means of
verification. A final point is that the
new cruise missile, part of the ad
ministration's modernization pro
gram, poses special problems for
verification due to its small size and
portability. The case for moderniza
tion on grounds of ease of verifica
tion is very weak.
Cossa's third argument is that we
should trust the president: Reagan
has once again pledged to make arms
control his No. 1 priority. We keep
hearing talk about arms control as
Reagan's No. 1 priority. But it is
merely talk; look at the actions:
failure to revive nuclear test ban and
other talks, nuclear war-fighjing
plans and ever more weapons sys
tems: MX, Pershing 2, cruise missile,
Trident D-5 missile, anti-satellite
weapons, B-l bomber. Stealth
bomber. . . . The Reagan administra
tion's consistent position amounts to
this: making a show of attempting to
talk while continuing to develop and
deploy new weapons and to insist
that they cannot be bargained away
in talks. Cossa's idea of trusting in
the benevolent leaders that got us
into this mess seems ridiculous to
me. Reagan wouldn't even bother to
negotiate or to clothe his war plans
in peace rhetoric if the freeze move
ment and the general public hadn't
forced him to. The freeze is still a
viable idea, and still supported by a
sizable majority of the population.
This the administration "finds unac
ceptable," but this is a democracy,
isn't it?
Modernization, not the freeze, is
"dangerous and self-defeating." The
Soviet Union will modernize, increas
ing our vulnerability. It will follow
the U.S. lead as it has done in the
past. The arms race is not primarily
driven by defense needs, but rather
by bureaucratic and economic power
elites within the United States and
the Soviet Union, and the danger
ously simplistic demonologies these
actively foster. Let's wise up.

hour, fully open kitchen for those who
cannot fit meal times into their
schedules. The house manages itself
in finances, meals, cooking and
social programs. Cooperative living
forces people to work together for a
common goal. This can provide a
rare sense of community and unity
not found in most housing.
I entered a co-op as a result of a
very disappointing Draw number,
rather than by choice. However,
after expecting so little I was seren
dipitously delighted by the new living
arrangement. People's political
views, musical tastes, religious
beliefs, academic goals and hobbies
differed as much as I have ever
encountered. However, everyone
manages to get dinner prepared
every night and the bathrooms
cleaned every week. Another thing I
notice is how people who move out
of a co-op seem to return. Whether
they have graduated or moved across
campus, they return for a dinner or a
late-night bread. This behavior is not
common to most dorms. The sense
of community seems to grow each
year.
Stanford should let the student
body broaden itself by encouraging
students to live in co-ops just as it
encourages students to take classes,
outside their majors. Co-ops
broaden the minds of Stanford stu
dents as much or more than other
living situations. For the sake of
diversity at Stanford, keep the co
ops.

Not vigilantism
It was refreshing to hear San Fran
cisco Supervisor Carol Ruth Silver's
attitude toward the New York sub
way incident in which four muggers
were shot. Stating this takes courage.
Although several of her colleagues
came out against her, she still held
her position. She noted that obser-

vers immediately cried "vigilantism,"
meaning the taking of law into one's
own hands. We cannot, however, use
our favorite stock phrases to describe
every situation. If we do, we can
force any event to fit one of these
standard molds. We could be wrong,
though, if we only have a limited
number of them, say one or two. Life
isn't that simple. Perhaps if we con
sider that the man acted partially in
self-defense, as well as in vigilantism,
we might more clearly describe the
situation.
The arguments claiming that the
victim of the mugging was acting out
a fantasy to wipe out all thieves
seems reasonable. We could stop
here, but let's go on. Didn't it seem
like the man, in response to being
attacked, defended himself? It's true,
he may have been looking for trou
ble, but it is hard to believe that he
deliberately provoked, then at
tacked, the criminals. The action of
arming himself for protection against
harm could be considered as vigilan
tism. It could also be called self
defense. Policemen routinely
purchase weapons in anticipation of
being forced to defend themselves. Is
this reasonable? They do frequent
fairly tough neighborhoods. A
bicyclist often considers wearing a
helmet and gloves in case he has an
accident. It seems more open
minded to have the choice whether
to call these actions premeditation,
self-defense or both.
One may question, as San Fran
cisco Police Chief Con Murphy does,
the need to carry and use a weapon
for self-defense. A soldier, police
officer or secret agent keeps one, but
how about the ordinary person? As
noted by Supervisor Silver,
sometimes the streets are not safe.
Sometimes the police must wait for a
backup unit before even entering
the neighborhood. Sometimes they
are too late. The popular liberal
sentiment today is to give more
responsibilities (and rights) to the
government. We live in a civilized
world, and individuals shouldn't be
concerned about having to defend
themselves as they did in the Old
West or the Mother Lode. They

should pay attention to philosophy,
digital hardware design, statesman
ship and other "higher" pursuits.
Ideally, government will take up the
slack. Unfortunately, it has a hard
time and is often unsuccessful.
If parents are unable to care for
their children properly, the authori
ties often send the children to a
foster home. Even though it is or
dinarily more desirable for the
children's natural parents to care for
them, a different home may provide
better care. The same is true for the
government. Self-protection is not
vigilantism; it is simply provision of a
need from another source. Someone
has to take care of the children.

Why new weapons
In the modern military lexicon,
"force modernization" means
"continuation of the arms race."
Beware of doubletalk: disarmament
through more weapons.
Ralph Cossa (The Daily, Jan. 18)
argues against a freeze and for
modernization. His three main argu
ments are faulty. First, while it is
true that a freeze would stop moder
nization, it would not halt replace
ment of aging weapons by new ones
of the same type; it would introduce
no new instability. Modernization,
on the other hand, means deploying
highly accurate counterforce missiles.
These tempt the possessor to strike
first to at least partly disarm the
opponent, while tempting the op
ponent to strike first to prevent this
from happening. The new weaponry,
not the freeze, is destabilizing.
As for verification, a freeze is the
most verifiable agreement possible:
Any weapon test, any transportation
of bomb materials to or from the few
production sites that exist and any
transport of finished weapons to
deployment sites would be a viola
tion. Under any other agreement,
verification is more difficult, since
one must distinguish between
actions that are allowed and those
which are not. Testing of new

weaponry is relatively easy to detect;
allowing modernization through the
introduction of new weapons
foolishly throws away this means of
verification. A final point is that the
new cruise missile, part of the ad
ministration's modernization pro
gram, poses special problems for
verification due to its small size and
portability. The case for moderniza
tion on grounds of ease of verifica
tion is very weak.
Cossa's third argument is that we
should trust the president: Reagan
has once again pledged to make arms
control his No. 1 priority. We keep
hearing talk about arms control as
Reagan's No. 1 priority. But it is
merely talk; look at the actions:
failure to revive nuclear test ban and
other talks, nuclear war-fighjing
plans and ever more weapons sys
tems: MX, Pershing 2, cruise missile,
Trident D-5 missile, anti-satellite
weapons, B-l bomber. Stealth
bomber. . . . The Reagan administra
tion's consistent position amounts to
this: making a show of attempting to
talk while continuing to develop and
deploy new weapons and to insist
that they cannot be bargained away
in talks. Cossa's idea of trusting in
the benevolent leaders that got us
into this mess seems ridiculous to
me. Reagan wouldn't even bother to
negotiate or to clothe his war plans
in peace rhetoric if the freeze move
ment and the general public hadn't
forced him to. The freeze is still a
viable idea, and still supported by a
sizable majority of the population.
This the administration "finds unac
ceptable," but this is a democracy,
isn't it?
Modernization, not the freeze, is
"dangerous and self-defeating." The
Soviet Union will modernize, increas
ing our vulnerability. It will follow
the U.S. lead as it has done in the
past. The arms race is not primarily
driven by defense needs, but rather
by bureaucratic and economic power
elites within the United States and
the Soviet Union, and the danger
ously simplistic demonologies these
actively foster. Let's wise up.

Co-op diversity
Res Ed's decision on the fate of
co-op houses draws near. This deci
sion should reflect both the ideals
and goals of the University and the
opinions and needs of the students.
After living in Terra for a year and
managing it for two quarters, I have
ideas that should be considered
before reaching a final judgement.
Stanford University boasts that
one of its greatest qualities lies in its
diversity. It claims to have a hetero
geneous student body — students
from all states, varying lifestyles and
many differing ethnic backgrounds.
To maintain its diversity, Stanford
imposes a wide-ranging set of distri
bution requirements upon its stu
dents. Students have the option of
many differing majors. In addition,
Stanford offers a wide variety of
on-campus housing. This ranges
from dormitories and fraternities to
theme houses and student
cooperatives. Each provides a living
situation as unique as the student
body.
The University sees housing as a
very integral part of education. Per
haps a student can gain something
from his living experience besides a
room. If Stanford eliminates co-ops,
what effect does that have on
"supposed" diversity within the
University housing system? Is Stan
ford, by eliminating a co-op. saying
something negative about the unique
interests of the co-op residents? Is it
so awful that someone has to live in
a different situation? Stanford seems
to think forcing distribution require
ments is important. Why not a new
living arrangement? Perhaps the
experience will enlighten the student.
Perhaps good, perhaps bad, but the
student gains a new experience and
true knowledge of a new subject.
Co-ops. in themselves, are diverse
places. In Terra, the students differ
more than any other living situation I
have encountered. The house resi
dents include 10 graduate students
from different departments, 43 un
dergraduates and 15 eating as
sociates who participate in cooking
and social events. These eating as-

sociates add an "outside" element to
the house because they live else
where. This is not found in most
living arrangements. In addition to
its residents, the co-op offers a 24-
hour, fully open kitchen for those who
cannot fit meal times into their
schedules. The house manages itself
in finances, meals, cooking and
social programs. Cooperative living

self-defense, as well as in vigilantism,
we might more clearly describe the
situation.
The arguments claiming that the
victim of the mugging was acting out
a fantasy to wipe out all thieves
seems reasonable. We could stop
here, but let's go on. Didn't it seem
like the man, in response to being
attacked, defended himself? It's true,
he may have been looking for trou
ble, but it is hard to believe that he
deliberately provoked, then at
tacked, the criminals. The action of
arming himself for protection against
harm could be considered as vigilan
tism. It could also be called self
defense. Policemen routinely
purchase weapons in anticipation of
being forced to defend themselves. Is
this reasonable? They do frequent
fairly tough neighborhoods. A
bicyclist often considers wearing a
helmet and gloves in case he has an
accident. It seems more open
minded to have the choice whether
to call these actions premeditation,
self-defense or both.
One may question, as San Fran
cisco Police Chief Con Murphy does,
the need to carry and use a weapon
for self-defense. A soldier, police
officer or secret agent keeps one, but
how about the ordinary person? As
noted by Supervisor Silver,
sometimes the streets are not safe.
Sometimes the police must wait for a
backup unit before even entering
the neighborhood. Sometimes they
are too late. The popular liberal
sentiment today is to give more
responsibilities (and rights) to the
government. We live in a civilized
world, and individuals shouldn't be
concerned about having to defend
themselves as they did in the Old
West or the Mother Lode. They

should pay attention to philosophy,
digital hardware design, statesman
ship and other "higher" pursuits.
Ideally, government will take up the
slack. Unfortunately, it has a hard
time and is often unsuccessful.
If parents are unable to care for
their children properly, the authori
ties often send the children to a
foster home. Even though it is or
dinarily more desirable for the
children's natural parents to care for
them, a different home may provide
better care. The same is true for the
government. Self-protection is not
vigilantism; it is simply provision of a
need from another source. Someone
has to take care of the children.

Why new weapons
In the modern military lexicon,
"force modernization" means
"continuation of the arms race."
Beware of doubletalk: disarmament
through more weapons.
Ralph Cossa (The Daily, Jan. 18)
argues against a freeze and for
modernization. His three main argu
ments are faulty. First, while it is
true that a freeze would stop moder
nization, it would not halt replace
ment of aging weapons by new ones
of the same type; it would introduce
no new instability. Modernization,
on the other hand, means deploying
highly accurate counterforce missiles.
These tempt the possessor to strike
first to at least partly disarm the
opponent, while tempting the op
ponent to strike first to prevent this
from happening. The new weaponry,
not the freeze, is destabilizing.
As for verification, a freeze is the
most verifiable agreement possible:
Any weapon test, any transportation
of bomb materials to or from the few
production sites that exist and any
transport of finished weapons to
deployment sites would be a viola
tion. Under any other agreement,
verification is more difficult, since
one must distinguish between
actions that are allowed and those
which are not. Testing of new

weaponry is relatively easy to detect;
allowing modernization through the
introduction of new weapons
foolishly throws away this means of
verification. A final point is that the
new cruise missile, part of the ad
ministration's modernization pro
gram, poses special problems for
verification due to its small size and
portability. The case for moderniza
tion on grounds of ease of verifica
tion is very weak.
Cossa's third argument is that we
should trust the president: Reagan
has once again pledged to make arms
control his No. 1 priority. We keep
hearing talk about arms control as
Reagan's No. 1 priority. But it is
merely talk; look at the actions:
failure to revive nuclear test ban and
other talks, nuclear war-fighjing
plans and ever more weapons sys
tems: MX, Pershing 2, cruise missile,
Trident D-5 missile, anti-satellite
weapons, B-l bomber. Stealth
bomber. . . . The Reagan administra
tion's consistent position amounts to
this: making a show of attempting to
talk while continuing to develop and
deploy new weapons and to insist
that they cannot be bargained away
in talks. Cossa's idea of trusting in
the benevolent leaders that got us
into this mess seems ridiculous to
me. Reagan wouldn't even bother to
negotiate or to clothe his war plans
in peace rhetoric if the freeze move
ment and the general public hadn't
forced him to. The freeze is still a
viable idea, and still supported by a
sizable majority of the population.
This the administration "finds unac
ceptable," but this is a democracy,
isn't it?
Modernization, not the freeze, is
"dangerous and self-defeating." The
Soviet Union will modernize, increas
ing our vulnerability. It will follow
the U.S. lead as it has done in the
past. The arms race is not primarily
driven by defense needs, but rather
by bureaucratic and economic power
elites within the United States and
the Soviet Union, and the danger
ously simplistic demonologies these
actively foster. Let's wise up.

Co-op diversity
Res Ed's decision on the fate of
co-op houses draws near. This deci
sion should reflect both the ideals
and goals of the University and the
opinions and needs of the students.
After living in Terra for a year and
managing it for two quarters, I have
ideas that should be considered
before reaching a final judgement.
Stanford University boasts that
one of its greatest qualities lies in its
diversity. It claims to have a hetero
geneous student body — students
from all states, varying lifestyles and
many differing ethnic backgrounds.
To maintain its diversity, Stanford
imposes a wide-ranging set of distri
bution requirements upon its stu
dents. Students have the option of
many differing majors. In addition,
Stanford offers a wide variety of
on-campus housing. This ranges
from dormitories and fraternities to
theme houses and student
cooperatives. Each provides a living
situation as unique as the student
body.
The University sees housing as a
very integral part of education. Per
haps a student can gain something
from his living experience besides a
room. If Stanford eliminates co-ops,
what effect does that have on
"supposed" diversity within the
University housing system? Is Stan
ford, by eliminating a co-op. saying
something negative about the unique
interests of the co-op residents? Is it
so awful that someone has to live in
a different situation? Stanford seems
to think forcing distribution require
ments is important. Why not a new
living arrangement? Perhaps the
experience will enlighten the student.
Perhaps good, perhaps bad, but the
student gains a new experience and
true knowledge of a new subject.
Co-ops. in themselves, are diverse
places. In Terra, the students differ
more than any other living situation I
have encountered. The house resi
dents include 10 graduate students
from different departments, 43 un
dergraduates and 15 eating as
sociates who participate in cooking
and social events. These eating as-

sociates add an "outside" element to
the house because they live else
where. This is not found in most
living arrangements. In addition to
its residents, the co-op offers a 24-
hour, fully open kitchen for those who
cannot fit meal times into their
schedules. The house manages itself
in finances, meals, cooking and
social programs. Cooperative living
forces people to work together for a
common goal. This can provide a
rare sense of community and unity
not found in most housing.
I entered a co-op as a result of a
very disappointing Draw number,
rather than by choice. However,
after expecting so little I was seren
dipitously delighted by the new living
arrangement. People's political
views, musical tastes, religious
beliefs, academic goals and hobbies
differed as much as I have ever
encountered. However, everyone
manages to get dinner prepared
every night and the bathrooms
cleaned every week. Another thing I
notice is how people who move out
of a co-op seem to return. Whether
they have graduated or moved across
campus, they return for a dinner or a
late-night bread. This behavior is not
common to most dorms. The sense
of community seems to grow each
year.
Stanford should let the student
body broaden itself by encouraging
students to live in co-ops just as it
encourages students to take classes,
outside their majors. Co-ops
broaden the minds of Stanford stu
dents as much or more than other
living situations. For the sake of
diversity at Stanford, keep the co
ops.

Not vigilantism
It was refreshing to hear San Fran
cisco Supervisor Carol Ruth Silver's
attitude toward the New York sub
way incident in which four muggers
were shot. Stating this takes courage.
Although several of her colleagues
came out against her, she still held
her position. She noted that obser-

vers immediately cried "vigilantism,"
meaning the taking of law into one's
own hands. We cannot, however, use
our favorite stock phrases to describe
every situation. If we do, we can
force any event to fit one of these
standard molds. We could be wrong,
though, if we only have a limited
number of them, say one or two. Life
isn't that simple. Perhaps if we con
sider that the man acted partially in
self-defense, as well as in vigilantism,
we might more clearly describe the
situation.
The arguments claiming that the
victim of the mugging was acting out
