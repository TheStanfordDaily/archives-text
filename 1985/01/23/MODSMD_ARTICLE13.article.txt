## The 						red, white and blues 
### 
Somewhere in California, a balding old folk
singer steps up to a microphone. The audience quiets
down. He strums his guitar once and frowns; it is out
of tune. He fiddles with a tuning peg for a moment.
He glances at a cameraman - this performance is
being broadcast over HBO - and, in a soft voice,
starts to sing:
Thus land is your land
This land is my land
From Three Mile Island
To Love Canal
From the local Taco Bell
To the Galleria
This land was made for you and me.
There is a graph. I think, that can. and probably
should, be drawn. What this graph would show is
that the deeper this country sinks into corruption
and hypocrisy, the more patriotic and self
righteous we become. What's that called? An in
verse proportion or something, right? Well, that's
what we have.
Sorta complex, isn't it? But that's OK; patriots
have this amazing knack of ignoring contradictions.
Then you get funny stuff. Stuff like right-to-lifers
for the death penalty. Anti-Christs for school
prayer. Yeah, and by the way, two plus two equals
five now. You know what I mean.
Thousands of miles away, in a hole-in-the-wall on
the Lower East Side, a 16-year-old core steps up to
a microphone. The audience pays no attention. He
strums his guitar once and smiles; it is out of tune.
He glances at a stage diver - a girl with a mohawk
has just launched herself into the audience - and
waits to make sure she's all right. Satisfied, he starts
to scream:
Traded in my blue suede shoes
For a pair of combat boots

Now I fight Ortega's troops
I've got those red, white and blues.
A patriot is easy to spot. You can always see
him at the movies. A patriot's idea of fun is watch
ing Goldie Hawn have multiple orgasms as she
recites the Declaration of Independence in
"Protocol." A patriot's idea of art is when Robin
Williams and a host of yellow, black and red people
do the same thing — only this time on the Fourth of
July with lots of red, white and blue fireworks
thrown in for good measure — in "Moscow on the
Hudson."
Only in 1984 could those movies not get laughed
off the screen. And only in 1984 could Steve
Vineberg write of "The Atomic Cafe" (which is
nothing but a collection of American film shorts
from the 1950s and '60s about the atom bomb): "Is
there still an audience for this type of wholesale
put-down of America?" Questions that don't need
to be asked, volume one. No, there isn't. And that's
kind of sad.
The folk singer's audience is clapping along now.
He lets go of his guitar and does the next verse a cap
pella:
This land is your land
This land is my land
From Nicaragua
To Honduras
Not to mention Grenada
And assorted bits of Panama
Maybe not Cuba
But that's OK
Cuz we'll get that one back someday.
I got in a fight with a Frenchman once. He didn't
like me because I was an American. I thought that
was a pretty dumb reason not to like someone. He
thought I elected President Reagan. I tried to tell
him it wasn't my fault, but he couldn't speak En

glish and I couldn't speak French. So he hit me.
Stupid Frog.
The little core has finished his first song. He's also
blown out his amp, so he yells the next number with
out accompaniment, as it were. The girl with the
mohawk is back on stage, slamming into him
whenever he tries to sing. Still, he manages to get out
the following:
This land is my land
It is not your land
So please move your ass
Before I shoot you dead
Then sue your trespassing
And deport you back to wherever the hell you
emigrated from in the first place
This land was made for me not you.
I'll tell you right now: This country sucks. Sorry.
But I cringe every time I hear some idiot pat us on
our collective back. And if the rest of the world is
gonna hold me responsible for what America does,
then America had better start acting the way I'd
like. I'm serious. And the first step is to realize that
the only reason we give a damn about the U.S.A. is
that we were born here instead of somewhere else.
That's no big deal. Agreed?
As if by magic, the core and the folk singer get
caught up in a synchronistic web. (This is getting
downright cute.) On opposite ends of the coast, at
the same time, they each open their mouths and sing
the same thing:
Apple pie and Chevrolets
Uncle Sam and the PTA
FBI and the Green Berets
We've got to fight for the American way
Let's hear it for the American way
(One more time)
I would die for the American way.
