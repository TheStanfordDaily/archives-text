## Men's volleyball Stanford wins season's 1st over Wildcats 
### ROB GRAHAM Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford men's volleyball team experienced few
first-match jitters yesterday as it opened its 1985 season
with a straight-set victory over ChL- State University, 15-
8, 15-3, 15-4.
The Cardinal, ranked sixth nationally in pre-season
polls, used its height advantage and consistent serving of
pre-season All-American Jon Root to defeat the
Wildcats, who fell to 3-1.
After a somewhat shaky start, Stanford proceeded to
dismantle its opponent. The Cardinal broke open a 6-4
first game with seven straight points. Root, a junior, led
Stanford with his overpowering serves. For the match, he
had six aces and, coupled with his eight kills and .316 hit
ting percentage, did little to damage his reputation.
The Cardinal was able to maintain its first-game inten
sity through the second and third games, and Co-Coach
Don Shaw was pleased with his team's play.
"We played pretty well. I was surprised at our execu
tion," he said. "We had no scrimmages, and this was our
first game with strange faces on the other side of the net.
"Execution will be a key for us all thoughout the year.
Tonight we didn't have people running into one another,"
Shaw added. "Volleyball is a weird game. It's really a
team game, and fine individual performances don't always
win games."
Even though individuals might not win games, last
night's marked the debut of freshman Scott Fortune. In
his first collegiate game. Fortune turned in a strong effort.
His nine kills and .400 hitting percentage suggest that his
contribution will be meaningful. Shaw said Fortune, this
season's top recruit, "did not act like a freshman."
Cardinal sophomore Stephen Blue dislocated a finger.
He should be healthy, though, for this weekend's mara
thon tournament in Santa Barbara.
Junior Brett Monello led the Cardinal with 14 kills and
a .267 hitting percentage. And senior Craig Lauchner
chipped in with efficient direction of the offense. "He
made the hitters' job a lot easier," Shaw said.
More generally, Shaw said, "We have a fairly young
team and we'll keep improving. We have the talent to play
with anybody."
Unfortunately for Stanford, though, anybody who is
anybody plays in its conference, the California Intercol
legiate Volleyball Association. Seven of the country's top
10 teams are in the CIVA. With that sort of competition,
the men could face a tough test as this season progresses.
