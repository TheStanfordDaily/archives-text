# Scientists oppose Reagan's proposed research cuts
## 
### 
Stanford scientists are voicing
strong criticism of a Reagan ad
ministration proposal to reduce
federal support for biomedical re
search this year below the levels
authorized by Congress.
"President Reagan is betting on
the wrong war," Paul Berg, a
Nobel Prize winner and professor
of biochemistry, said yesterday.
"He is increasing defense
budget spending at the expense of
war on disease. I think the reduc
tion in proposed grant support is
outrageous and it will prove ex
traordinarily costly in the long
run."
"It is a very calamitous deci
sion," said Arthur Kornberg, also
a Nobel prize winning biochemist
known for his work on the genetic
code.
Kornberg said the cuts would
have "profound and harmful" ef
fects for research, with serious
consequences for the nation's ef
forts to improve the diagnosis,
treatment and prevention of
disease.
"The proposed cuts are drastic,
Kornberg said. "They would affect
the activities of some 25 percent of
the nation's most productive
biomedical scientists, young and
old, as well as the entire spectrum
of research on diseases and basic
science.
"The cuts would not only
destroy a large segment of our sci
entific talent, but they would send
a message to our younger scien
tists that they cannot be assured of
support even if they have done
distinguished work and spent
years in specialized training."
The Reagan administration has
proposed to reduce the number of
competitive grants awarded by the
National Institutes this year by 23
percent: from 6,500 to 5,000. The
cutbacks will affect the full range
of research, including the studies
of cancer, heart disease, arthritis,

immunology, cell biology,
molecular genetics, neurological
disorders and stroke.
Administration officials, quoted
in news articles, have said the cuts
will save $280 million in the cur
rent fiscal year and at least that
amount in each of the next two
years. Congress has appropriated
$5.1 billion for the National In
stitute of Health in fiscal 1985.
But medical school administra
tors throughout the country have
criticized the impounding of funds
already authorized by Congress as
arbitrary.
David Korn, dean of the Stan
ford Medical School, said the deci
sion by Congress to increase the
NIH budget at levels substantially
higher than those requested by the
administration reflected two im
portant facts:
"One was the current state of
progress in biochemical research,"
Korn said, and another was "the
recognition that research funding
had failed to keep pace with
developments coming from some
of our best biochemical research
institutions," he said.
The 6,500 research grants ear
marked for 1985, the dean ex
plained, represented a highly
desirable step to redress this
serious imbalance.
The decision of the Office of
Management and Budget to
"manipulate funding already au
thorized represents a contraven
tion of the will of Congress," Korn
said. "It freezes biochemical re
search and contract support at a
level already shown to be grossly
inadequate."
"I am particularly concerned
about the effect of the cuts on
young scientists who will essen
tially be without funds," said
Robert Lehman, professor of
biochemistry.
He said the cuts were coming at
the wrong time.
