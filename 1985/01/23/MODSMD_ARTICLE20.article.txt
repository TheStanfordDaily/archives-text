# Cardinal trying for 3rd straight victory tonight
## 
### JOHN LIS Staff sportswriter 
Coming off a 68-67 conference vic
tory over Arizona State University
Monday, the Stanford women's bas
ketball team goes after its third con
secutive victory tonight in Stockton
against the University of the Pacific.
Stanford, now 2-1 in the Western
Collegiate Athletic Association and
7-8 overall, hasn't won three in a row
in two years.
Stanford's offense, which has
stalled for much of the season, was
running at full throttle Monday. "We
had great ball movement last night,"
Asst. Coach Mike Kehoe said yester
day. "We had the most success when
we got uncontested, open shots."
The Cardinal also ran its controlled
break possibly as well as it has all year
against ASU and hopes to do the
same tonight. "We're going to try to
go up-tempo against UOP," Kehoe
said.
"In our organized break, we look
at defensive patterns against the
transition game. Even if they stifle
the break, we can still get into our of
fense and run it from anywhere on
the floor. If we have good ball move
ment, we're going to take a team slow
in its transition and take advantage of
that."
Guard Virginia Sourlis said,
"We've had a couple of close games;
now it's all coming together. We've
now got two non-conference games
to prepare for UCLA. If we can get
two wins this week, we'll have a win
ning record at 9-8."
UOP is struggling this season
despite having an experienced front
court. The Lady Tigers are 5-14 over
all this year, 1-4 in the Pacific Coast
Athletic Association. They are only
1-8 at home, though.

Janet Whitney, a 6-foot-1 junior
forward, leads UOP in scoring,
averaging 18.4 points and 6.9
rebounds per game. She was averag
ing near 20 ppg before spraining her
ankle last week against the University
of California at Berkeley and playing
only 14 minutes in two games against
the University of Hawaii. Whitney,
the leading scorer in the PCAA, is ex
pected to be healthy tonight.
The Tigers' Jane Geiger, a 6-2
senior forward, is averaging 13.2 ppg
and 9.7 rpg, and 6-1 junior forward
Janet Otto leads the PCAA in
rebounding with 1 1 rpg and is
scoring 11.9 ppg Geiger and Whit
ney are ranked Nos. 2 and 3 in
rebounding in the conference.
"They've got experience," Kehoe
said. "Those kids have been playing
together for a long time."
They have also been playing for a
long time each game. Part of the rea
son the Tiger forwards have impres
sive statistics is that Head Coach Julie
Hickey has used her bench sparingly.
She hasn't had much choice at times,
and the Tigers have only seven
players for tonight's game. An injury
and ineligibility have cut their roster
from nine.
Stanford has been doing the same
thing of late. Head Coach Dotty
McCrea only used seven players
against ASU, and four starters played
more than 37 minutes each.
Kehoe said he didn't know whether
the Cardinal would bring people off
the bench more tonight. "We're
going to have to see how different
combos are doing. We'll have to see
how things are going."
After tonight's game, Stanford will
play at St. Mary's College Friday
before returning to conference play at
UCLA Feb. 1.
