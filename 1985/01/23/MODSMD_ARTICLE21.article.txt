## Los Lobos: The Wolf triumphs 
### TONY TRAN 
The first song that Los Lobos
played at the Keystone Saturday
night was "Will the Wolf Survive?"
the title track from their newest al
bum. The remainder of the concert
erased all doubts as to the outcome of
that question. By the end of the show,
the wolf seemed capable of attaining
immortality. Indeed, the answer to
the question may have been super
fluous. For how can you not survive
and triumph, with such beautiful rock
'n' roll on your side?
The Chicano quartet from East Los
Angeles ("Los Lobos" means "The
Wolves" in Spanish), along with their
saxophone player/producer Steve
Berlin (also of Blaster fame), rocked
the joint for close to two hours, and
affected the crowd in different ways.
The believers, including me, were
either elated or euphoric; the non
believers were converted into
believers. All departed with the
feeling that any rock music that felt
this good was capable of solving all
the problems in the world — or at
least of breaking some barriers, par
ticularly the racial, cultural and musi
cal ones.
I am not ashamed to say that I love
Los Lobos. I love their music; I love
everything they represent; 1 love
everything that they are striving to
accomplish.
First of all, the music. Here's a
band that has stuck to its roots. They
play a fresh, diverse mixture of rock
'n' roll whose origins include traces of
country and western, 1950s Ameri
can New Orleans rock (e.g. Fats
Domino), '50s urban blues (e.g. Bo
Diddley) and, of course, a heavy dose
of Mexican mariachi folk music.
These styles seem to have been so ob
viously made to be combined with
each other that it is surprising that no
one had thought of doing it before.
The results are certainly exciting to
hear, with lots of funky accordion,
sinewy slide guitar, raucous sax,
sprightly banjo and (I must not forget
this) a powerhouse rhythm section.
Despite the age of the styles,

however, it all sounds new. Perhaps
Los Lobos had an unfair advantage
— good rock never becomes ob
solete. Did you ever tire of hearing
Chuck Berry, the Drifters or the early
Stones?
The band made sure that every
thing else would complement the
"homey," "down-to-earth" aura of
its root music. There is no flash or
glitter in the show. The light-show
aspect is unaccentuated to the point
of nonexistence. The stage lights were
left turned on (all of them) for
the duration of the show, and
only changed once, dimming for
the achingly beautiful ballad "A Mat
ter of Time," one of my favorites
from the new LP. Dressed in simple,
almost "plebian" flannel shirts, jeans
and boots, the Hispanic band mem
bers — David Hidalgo and Cesar
Rosas on lead vocals, guitars and
other assorted instruments, Conrad
Lozano on bass and Louie Perez on
drums — looked like your neighbor
hood friends, or local corner boys
from your hometown (especially if
your hometown happened to be a
former Mexican town, or Spanish
mission in California). And I think
that this no-frills approach is the only
possible way to present their brand of
roots rock 'n' roll, which is robust and
undeniable in its simplicity, honesty
and driving recklessness. The band
played all seven of the great upbeat
numbers from the new album, as well
as some crowd-pleasing rave-ups
from the 1983 EP " . . . And a Time
to Dance," such as "Let's Go," "The
Walking Song" and "Why Don't You
Do." The most enthusiastic applause,
however, broke out when the band
performed its rowdy renditions of
the classic tunes "Farmer John" and
"La Bamba," the latter as an encore.
To me, what's more impressive
about Los Lobos, beyond the musical
standpoint, is what the band stands
for. Being an ardent believer in the
world-saving capabilities of
pluralism, I admire the band for its
courage in representing through
music a cultural and social force that

— although deeply rooted in the
painful historic experience of the dis
possessed Chicano in American soci
ety — can appeal to everyone,
whether you are in another ethnic
minority in the United States, an im
migrant to America, a social outcast
or all or none of these. The world,
and especially the "melting pot" of
America, needs more ethnic rock
bands like Los Lobos, if only for the
promotion of better understanding
and relations between the races. I
believe that good music can do this,
because 1 saw it happen with the
crowd attending the Los Lobos con
cert. It was the most racially and cul
turally mixed concert crowd I've ever
been part of, and we all felt as if we
belonged. It didn't matter whether
you were black, white, Hispanic, na
tive American — or even if you were a
punk rocker like me. What mattered
was that we were all grooving, getting
off together to the music, smiling at
each other, giving high fives to each
other. The world in those two hours
felt so right, in all the right ways.
I can't end this review without first
talking about the anthemic master
piece, "Will the Wolf Survive?"
which is their best and most signifi
cant song to date. It's a short song (a
little more than three minutes), but in
it, the band is able to encapsulate the
whole experience of what being a
Chicano in the United States — and
especially California — has meant for
the last two centuries, as well as to ar
ticulate the group's ideal and philoso
phy. What is most remarkable,
however, is that the band is able to
use subtle imagery and metaphors to
get this message through. The song,
driven by a breathtaking guitar riff
much like Bruce Springsteen's "No
Surrender," is outwardly about a lone
wolf struggling to survive in the forest
and provide for his family:
"Standing in the pouring rain.
All alone in a world that's changed.
Running scared now, forced to hide,
In a land where he once stood with
pride . . .

But he'll find his way, before the
morning light ..."
If you listen carefully and think
about the words, however, the sym
bolic significance of this gorgeous
song will soon become apparent. The
"wolf' symbolizes not only the band
itself and its type of music, but can
also be applied to the entire Hispanic

community in America, as well as all
other ethnic minorities in America —
indeed, all who have ever felt ostra
cized and persecuted in America or
the world. The song "Will the Wolf
Survive?" is to me one of the greatest
rock songs ever on this theme of
struggle, perseverance and eventual
triumph, on a par with other sublime
classics such as Graham Parker's

"Fool's Gold," Jimmy Cliffs "Many
Rivers to Cross" and the Clash's "I'm
Not Down." Through their music, Los
Lobos gives hope to all of us, and
makes us feel as if we all belong to the
same world community. Final piece
of advice: go buy the album, and go
see Los Lobos the next time they're
around. You'll feel a lot better about
life — and about the world.
