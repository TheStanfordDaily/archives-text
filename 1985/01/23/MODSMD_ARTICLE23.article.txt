# Winter One Acts a rare opportunity
## 
### NANCY HENRY 
Each year, playwrights at Stanford
have one major opportunity to see
their works in production. Often the
three short plays selected by Ram's
Head and presented in one evening
under the title Original Winter One
Acts are the work of writers who have
never written for the theater or have
never had their work treated in the
serious and professional manner of
Winter One Acts. This unique event,
not surprisingly, sparks much interest
in the Stanford community about
what young artists are thinking and
creating.

This year's show, which played for
three consecutive nights last week,
presented very different plays in in
novative forms, which reflected some
common concerns of students today.
All three seemed a bit rough, and
though the scripts and the acting were
far from shabby, both would have
benefited from — and the works
deserve — a bit more polish.
The first play, and the one that suf
fered most from very loose direction
and a disunited script, was "A Sense
of Timing" by Elyce Melmon. It
began with the promising premise of
an eccentric woman who lives in the

past, yet is content. She holds a cock
tail party for 50 imaginary friends,
and the action is generated by the in
teraction of various real people with
the woman and her dream world.
Nancy Beagle gave a performance
that was occasionally brilliant, but
like every other character, she
became bogged down in ceaselessly
rambling and cliched dialogue that
touched at least once on almost every
philosophical, social, political,
moral and religious question im
aginable. Some of the conversation
sounded as though it had been
abstracted from a Western Culture
discussion section, and the stream of
contrived situations seemed endless.
There were definitely important
themes that can be culled from this
play, particularly that of the meeting
of two generations, a grandmother
and her grandson, and their
respective means of escaping life's
problems: one fantasy, the other
drugs. Somehow, however, the script
was just not under control, and with
some major editing, will be much
more effective. That is, after all, what
a first production reveals. Melmon,
along with both other playwrights,
demonstrated a definite talent for
comic dialogue; and played with im
pressive timing by Karen Mary
Davalos, Jamie Smeltz and Terry
Weissman, the play had many
redeeming moments of humor.
The second in the series was the
most focused in theme, the most
tightly directed and the most
precisely acted. Perhaps it stemmed
from its subject matter — so close to
many Stanford students. "Pas de
Deux" by Gwen Orel is set in an
American high school and deals with
the problems of social pressure, spe
cifically the disease anorexia nervosa.
Winter Wright II gave a performance
that was chilling in its controlled
rigidity and heartlessness. Melmon
uses an innovative dramatic tech
nique to personify intense social
criticism and judgment when it is in
ternalized by a young, conscientious,
talented, but insecure young woman.

Becky Kuchar is painfully believable
as the victim of Wright's vicious
tauntings. Wright is her shadow, her
conscience, her tormentor — both so
ciety and herself. The play builds to a
dramatic climax, but its ending offers
little reason for hope to this pathetic
and very relevant situation, leaving
Wright and Kuchar dancing a "pas de
deux" of death.
The last play, "An Unhappy End
ing" by Reid Sherline, is simultane
ously the most humorous and most
tragic. Much of the credit for the
comic dimension goes to Mitch
Rudominer, who plays the role of a
college student who wants life to be
predictable, but is continually con

fronted with the unpredictable, with
illusions that to him are real. He is es
sentially the only "real person" in the
play. He is an unwilling participant in
a great theatrical production, and the
only one conscious of a world outside
of the stage. Sherline has experi
mented with some creative dramatic
devices; he introduces characters
from Shakespeare and from "Our
Town" into his play. Seemingly out of
context, these characters call on
Rudominer s Peter to act with them;
they fill a gap in his unstable personal
life, then, as he is sucked into their
world, they disappear, leaving him
frustrated, confused, enraged, ulti
mately insane.

The common theme in each of
these plays seems to be the
difficulty, the apparent impossibility,
but ultimately the necessity of "facing
reality." All three create essentially
tragic scenarios, relieve the drama
with humor, but return to a pessimis
tic conclusion. The Winter One Acts
are important for the rare opportu
nity they provide for artistic explora
tion and cultivation at Stanford, as
well as for their individual and col
lective social commentaries.They
should remain a major, if not the
major, event of Stanford's theatrical
season. If they serve their purpose,
we will be hearing from these young
playwrights again.


"Pas de Deux/' by Cwen Orel, dealt with the issues of peer pressure
and anorexia nervosa.
