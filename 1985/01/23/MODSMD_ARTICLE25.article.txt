# Anderson's 'U.S.' album captivating
## 
### ANDREW CROWELL 
The theater lights dim. A spotlight
marks the curtain, front stage center.
The curtain opens revealing a rather
short woman with spiked hair. She is
dressed entirely in black. She is hold
ing a white violin. She begins to play.
Suddenly, you notice she is standing
on something. Is that? No, it couldn't
be! It is. She is wearing ice skates, the
blades of which are embedded in a
block of ice. She continues to play,
apparently oblivious to the ice or the
fact that she can't move her feet. On
she plays as a puddle of water grows
around her. The woman concludes
her solo just as the last remnants of
ice melt. Her feet now free, she walks
off stage.
A talent show? A joke?
Far from it. The woman is perfor
mance artist Laurie Anderson, and in
the 1970s this was a common perfor
mance for her. While for obvious
reasons she never achieved much
commercial success, she did elicit
some support among music critics and
"artsy" individuals — especially in
New York, Anderson's home town.
With the onset of the '80s,
however, Anderson's performances
have become much more varied both
in medium and content. Anderson
now fuses elaborate video presenta
tions with dance, music and poetry to
present humorous yet thought
provoking shows covering almost
everything from religion and politics
to fear and isolation.
Anderson's work culminated in a
five-and-a-half-hour multimedia
show entitled "United States I-IV."
Divided into four sections corre
sponding to the four U.S. time zones,

the presentation took tour nights to
perform and as a result, was only pre
sented in its entirety in New York,
London and Zurich. A condensed
show was performed, however, in
other more commercial cities like Los
Angeles and San Francisco. Many
Anderson fans feared they would
never get to see the complete show.
Well, I..A. enthusiasts, relax. Your
troubles are partially over.
"United States Live," a five-record
boxed set of albums, was released late
last year and provides a viable, yet
not quite perfect, alternative to those
not lucky enough to see one of the

full-length shows. The production of
the album is excellent. Each record
sleeve contains pictures, drawings
and explanatory notes relevant to
that portion of the show. The prob
lem, though, quickly becomes appar
ent. For instance, one entire track is
of nothing except thumping noises
with the audience's laughter. The ex
planatory notes inform the listener
that Anderson is using a "reverb"
consisting of a pair of glasses with a
contact microphone hooked to the
bridge. When worn, the glasses turn
Anderson's head into a "resonant
drum." The sounds obviously are An
derson thumping her head, but unfor
tunately this three-dimensional piece

loses something in the two
dimensional album translation. This
fact is also reinforced in many of the
longer instrumentals which have
sounds that leave the listener won
dering what the song is really about.
The visual component which is so
fundamental to an Anderson show is
reduced to a few pictures and
drawings.
Make no mistake, however, there
are highlights too numerous to men
tion, though I will attempt to pick out
a few. "Language Is a Virus From
Outer Space" is a superb pseudo
rock piece based on the not-so
famous quote from William
Burroughs. "I Dreamed I Had to
Take a Test" effectively uses An
derson's tape-bow violin consisting of
a strip of audio tape mounted to a
violin bow which is then played on a
violin having a recorder playback
head rather than strings. "Walk the
Dog" and"It Was Up in the Moun
tains" reveal the danger inherent in
expectations, while "False Docu
ments" reiterates the appearance
versus-reality theme that forms one
of the unifying elements in the work.
Perhaps the most thought-provoking
piece is "Song for Two Jims," which
paints a dark and ominous picture of
American values and progress.
Without a doubt, "United States
Live" is a captivating album from
start to finish. Although a videotape
may have been a more effective
means of presentation, the recording,
for the most part, has enough sub
stance so that it can stand on its own.
This is material you won't hear on
"American Top 40," so get your copy
while supplies last.

blades of which are embedded in a
block of ice. She continues to play,
apparently oblivious to the ice or the
fact that she can't move her feet. On
she plays as a puddle of water grows
around her. The woman concludes
her solo just as the last remnants of
ice melt. Her feet now free, she walks
off stage.
A talent show? A joke?
Far from it. The woman is perfor
mance artist Laurie Anderson, and in
the 1970s this was a common perfor
mance for her. While for obvious
reasons she never achieved much
commercial success, she did elicit
some support among music critics and
"artsy" individuals — especially in
New York, Anderson's home town.
With the onset of the '80s,
however, Anderson's performances
have become much more varied both
in medium and content. Anderson
now fuses elaborate video presenta
tions with dance, music and poetry to
present humorous yet thought
provoking shows covering almost
everything from religion and politics
to fear and isolation.
Anderson's work culminated in a
five-and-a-half-hour multimedia
show entitled "United States I-IV."
Divided into four sections corre
sponding to the four U.S. time zones,

the presentation took tour nights to
perform and as a result, was only pre
sented in its entirety in New York,
London and Zurich. A condensed
show was performed, however, in
other more commercial cities like Los
Angeles and San Francisco. Many
Anderson fans feared they would
never get to see the complete show.
Well, I..A. enthusiasts, relax. Your
troubles are partially over.
"United States Live," a five-record
boxed set of albums, was released late
last year and provides a viable, yet
not quite perfect, alternative to those
not lucky enough to see one of the

full-length shows. The production of
the album is excellent. Each record
sleeve contains pictures, drawings
and explanatory notes relevant to
that portion of the show. The prob
lem, though, quickly becomes appar
ent. For instance, one entire track is
of nothing except thumping noises
with the audience's laughter. The ex
planatory notes inform the listener
that Anderson is using a "reverb"
consisting of a pair of glasses with a
contact microphone hooked to the
bridge. When worn, the glasses turn
Anderson's head into a "resonant
drum." The sounds obviously are An
derson thumping her head, but unfor
tunately this three-dimensional piece

loses something in the two
dimensional album translation. This
fact is also reinforced in many of the
longer instrumentals which have
sounds that leave the listener won
dering what the song is really about.
The visual component which is so
fundamental to an Anderson show is
reduced to a few pictures and
drawings.
Make no mistake, however, there
are highlights too numerous to men
tion, though I will attempt to pick out
a few. "Language Is a Virus From
Outer Space" is a superb pseudo
rock piece based on the not-so
famous quote from William
Burroughs. "I Dreamed I Had to
Take a Test" effectively uses An
derson's tape-bow violin consisting of
a strip of audio tape mounted to a
violin bow which is then played on a
violin having a recorder playback
head rather than strings. "Walk the
Dog" and"It Was Up in the Moun
tains" reveal the danger inherent in
expectations, while "False Docu
ments" reiterates the appearance
versus-reality theme that forms one
of the unifying elements in the work.
Perhaps the most thought-provoking
piece is "Song for Two Jims," which
paints a dark and ominous picture of
American values and progress.
Without a doubt, "United States
Live" is a captivating album from
start to finish. Although a videotape
may have been a more effective
means of presentation, the recording,
for the most part, has enough sub
stance so that it can stand on its own.
This is material you won't hear on
"American Top 40," so get your copy
while supplies last.
