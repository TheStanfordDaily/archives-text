New microsurgery lab
Stanford's plastic and reconstructive surgery division
has been able to update and expand its microsurgery labo
ratory thanks to the generosity of a former patient, said
division head Dr. Lars Vistnes.
The new lab, equipped with about $75,000 raised
through the efforts of Beverley HilN resident Bernice
Gershon, was dedicated during a small ceremony
Thursday.
"We now have the most modern microsurgery labora
tory available," Vistnes said.
The advent of microsurgery — techniques with which
surgeons can cut and splice vessels, nerves, muscle, ten
dons and more with minuscule tools they maneuver while
peering through a microscope — is considered one of the
most dramatic in years, Vistnes said. It has allowed sur
geons to transfer parts of the body — a toe to the hand,
for example — and to re-attach severed parts that in the
past would have been lost.
The funding enabled the division to purchase a new
operating microscope that allows two surgeons to partici
pate in the operation. An attached video camera records
the procedure and a viewing screen allows others to ob
serve without interfering. The procedures can be played
back at other times for critiquing as well as for teaching
purposes.
Stanford's division includes seven full-time faculty
members and 18 residents training to be plastic and
reconstructive surgeons in the six-year-long program.
With the funds the division also purchased sets of
microsurgery tools — forceps, scissors and clamps with
tips thinner than one strand of human hair — to lend to
physicians-in-training and to use in the lab.
Gershon was referred to Vistnes about two years ago
for reconstructive surgery following a bout with cancer.
Upon her recovery, Vistnes said, she told him she'd like to
help him financially. He suggested the need for updated
equipment for his lab.
Red Cross conference
"We must have an international focus," said Richard
Schubert, president of the American Red Cross, at a con
ference yesterday titled "The Developing Role of Red
Cross in a Changing World."
"This means aiding not only suffering Americans, but
those in foreign lands such as Africa, also," Schubert said.
Jean-Jacques Surbeck, a delegate of the International

Committee of Red Cross and the committee's liaison to
the United Nations, stressed the very basic Red Cross
truth that "whatever their political creed, their uniforms,
their race, their religious beliefs, victims are all equal in
hardship and pain."
Jacques Moreillon, a member of Directorate Affairs for
the International Committee of Red Cross in Geneva,
defined humanitarian law as "precisely the distinction be
tween those who may be attacked in the course of the con
flict and those who should be respected and protected."
Lindau elected fellow
Ingolf Lindau, professor of electrical engineering at
Stanford and an associate director of the Stanford
Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL), has been
elected a fellow of the American Physical Society.
Lindau was honored "for his contributions to improved
understanding of the electronic properties of solids, par
ticularly through the application of synchrotron radiation
to photo-emission studies of surfaces and photo
ionization studies of ionization cross sections."
A native of Sweden, Lindau did his undergraduate and
graduate work at the Chalmers University of Technology
in Gothenburg. He later worked at Varian Associates and
at Linkoping University, Sweden, before coming to Stan
ford in 1972.
At Stanford he participated in the original plans to use
the synchrotron radiation from the Stanford Positron
Electron Asymmetric Ring as a light source. He designed
and performed a high-resolution X-ray photo-emission ex
periment as the first and pioneering project using
synchrotron radiation at Stanford and has since been in
strumental in the development of SSRL as a nationally
recognized facility.
Norris professorship
The Kenneth T. and Eileen L. Norris Foundation of
Long Beach has pledged $3 million to Stanford for
a research endowment, facilities improvement and
endowed professorship for the director of the Stanford
Mental Health Clinical Research Center.
Dr. Philip Berger was appointed the first Kenneth T.
Norris, Jr. Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral
Sciences at the School of Medicine by the Stanford Board
of Trustees at its Dec. 11 meeting.
