# Frosh housing increase discussed
## 
### R. TAEZA PIERCE Staff writer 
The Office of Residential Education is currently
considering plans to allot more all-freshman
housing, following a recommendation from the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies (C-US) that
more all-freshman dormitories be created here.
While awaiting this decision, the Committee on
Services to Students-Residences (COSS-R) has of
fered two suggestions for ways to increase the
amount of all-freshman housing.
According to Tim Hesterberg, a student member
of COSS-R, if Res Ed decides to create more all
freshman dorms, "Cedro and Burbank will prob
ably be converted to all-freshman housing." Hes
terberg said that if the University made this change,
it would then probably convert the Florence Moore
four-class houses to three-class houses or reduce
the percentage of freshmen living in the four-class
houses in Wilbur, Stern, Toyon and Flo Mo.
"There are two separate decisions," Hesterberg

said, explaining that the first concerns whether to
increase the amount of all-freshman housing and
the second concerns how to do so. "We'll be more
involved in the second," he said of COSS-R's role
in the decision making.
Dean of Res Ed Norm Robinson said the first
decision "is still in the discussion process." Res Ed
is responsible for making the final verdict on any
changes in freshman housing, he said.
The dean said he did not know which houses
would be affected if Res Ed decides to follow the
C-US recommendation. "I don't even know if
we're going to do it,"he said. "We'll . . . know in
the next few weeks."
Rob Robinson, resident fellow in West Lagunita
Court, said he has known for a while that Res Ed is
considering increasing the number of all-freshman
dorms, and said he does not like the idea.
A C-US subcommittee recommendation that all
freshmen live in all-freshman housing was a contri
buting factor to the push for more all-freshman

housing, he said.
He cited many reasons for the subcommittee re
commendation. More entering freshmen
"requested all-freshman dorms than could possibly
be accommodated in all-freshman dorms," he said.
There was also a belief that all-freshman houses of
fer more centrally organized academic advising and
the possibility for better in-house seminars and
courses, he noted.
Assistant History Prof. Stephen Ferruolo, who
has served as a resident fellow in both all-freshman
and upperclass residences, said he is strongly in fa
vor of the proposed creation of more all-freshman
houses. "For educational reasons, and for reasons
of advising, creating more all-freshman housing is a
good idea," Ferruolo said.
Lagunita's Robinson disagreed. In response to
the statement that more people want to live in all
freshman houses than can be accommodated, he
