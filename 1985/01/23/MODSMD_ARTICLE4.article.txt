# Ombudsman to step down
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
John Goheen, a member of the
Stanford faculty since 1950, will step
down from the position of University
ombudsman at the end of August.
A philosophy professor and one of
the founders of the University's pro
gram in Structured Liberal Educa
tion, Goheen assumed the position of
ombudsman here in 1974. He called
the position "a fascinating job. In
fact, it's been a fascinating second
career for me."
"It opens up a side of the Univer
sity which is new from the point of
view of a person who has been a pro
fessor," he said.
The ombudsman, according to
Goheen, is "charged with receiving
complaints and problems and resolv
ing them as far as that is possible for
students, faculty and staff."
A committee headed by Chemistry
Prof. Eric Hutchinson has been es
tablished to find a replacement for
Goheen. The eight-member commit
tee, composed of faculty, staff and a
single undergraduate student, met for
the first time last Friday, according to
Bob Hamrdla, committee vice chair
and assistant to the president.
Hamrdla said University President
Donald Kennedy has asked the com

mittee to find a nominee for the posi
tion by early spring.
Goheen elaborated on the prob
lems that the ombudsman deals with,
calling the most common complaints
"bureaucratic problems," including
grades, food service, teachers and
housing.
According to the annual report
from the ombudsman for the school
year 1983-84, the office handled 541
cases, including 281 from students,
with the most frequent complaints in
the area of academics.
"One of the most pervasive aspects
of complaints from the academic and
non-academic staff is expressed in
terms of lack of appreciation or being
treated as inferior by a supervisor," 1
the report said.
"The Stanford community needs to
be aware that negative attitudes
towards academic and non-academic
staff are demoralizing to those who
are subject to them," the report said.
"There is sufficient evidence of this in
the day-to-day operations of this of
fice to justify bringing the matter
once again to public attention."
Goheen attended Pomona College
as an undergraduate and continued
his studies at a number of universities
including Harvard, where he taught
before coming to Stanford.
