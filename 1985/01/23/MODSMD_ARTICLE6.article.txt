O'Neill will not obstruct budget
WASHINGTON — House Speaker Thomas ( l ip) O'Neill (I)-Mass.)
told President Reagan yesterday that he will not obstruct Ins budget in
the House but insisted that spending cuts to achieve deficit reductions
must come from defense as well as domestic programs.
O'Neill also said for the first time that Social Security was "on the
table" for bargaining over deficit cuts, but he told Reagan that the
Democrats will not take the lead in proposing cuts in any part of the
budget, including Social Security benefits.
In an extraordinarily conciliatory statement after a post-inaugural
meeting between Reagan and leaders of both parties in Congress.
O'Neill said he told the president that "in my 50 years of public life I've
never seen a man more popular than you are with the American
people," and added:
"We're not going in any way to thwart the will of the American
people, we're not going to be obstructionist in any manner."
But O'Neill also made it clear that Reagan and Senate Republicans
would have to take the lead in proposing controversial spending cuts to
reduce $200 billion annual deficits and thereby take the political conse
quences for the results.
GNP grows 6.8 percent in 1984
WASHINGTON — The U.S. economy grew at a healthy rate of b.H
percent during the 1984, closing out the fastest year of business expan
sion since 1951 and signaling another good performance for 1985. the
Department of Commerce reported yesterday.
Steady growth and low inflation should characterize the economy this
year, most analvsts believe, although the pace will not be as brisk as in
1984.
At the White House, President Reagan said in a statement "I am
delighted" with the news. "We are succeeding in building strong and las
ting economic growth without inflation." Reagan declared. "And I
believe these results demonstrate once again that our economic pro
gram, given a chance to work, has worked beautifully in spite of the
naysayers."
The administration had worked hard to maximize the favorable
publicity from the statistical reports, with Reagan providing a sneak
preview at an inaugural ball Monday night when he told a happy crowd
that the government would be announcing some of the best economic
news in three decades.
Shuttle mission delayed by cold
CAPE CANAVERAL. Fla. — A second night of freezing tempera
tures caused a 24-hour delay in the scheduled liftoff of the space shuttle
Discovery on its first military mission, NASA announced late yesterday.
Shortly before midnight, the National Aeronautics and Space Admin
istration announced that "extreme weather conditions in the area are
projected to cause icing conditions on the external tank" and said the
launch would be rescheduled for tomorrow afternoon.
At the time, the temperature was near freezing and dropping.
Officials worry that chunks of ice on the shuttle's huge external tank
could drop off and damage the shuttle on its climb into orbit.
The countdown had gotten behind because of ice on the launch pad
and frozen valves.
Temperatures were forecast in the mid-50s today.
Ver charged with Aquino murder
MANILA, Philippines — A government prosecutor charged armed
forces chief Gen. Fabian Ver, two other generals and 23 other men early
today in the double murder of opposition leader Benigno Aquino and
the man the army had claimed was his assassin.
Brig. Gen. Luther Custodio, chief of aviation security, and 16 other
soldiers were charged with direct participation in a military conspiracy to
kill Aquino as he stepped off a plane Aug. 2 1, 1983, after three years of
voluntary exile in the United States.
Ver, Maj. Gen. Prospero Olivas and six other soldiers were accused of
being accessories in a military attempt to cover up the assassinastion and
blame it on alleged communist agent Rolando Galman. A civilian
businessman, Hermilo Gosuico. was accused of being an accomplice to
the conspiracy.
Justice Bernardo Fernandez, government ombudsman, essentially fol
lowed the recommendations of the majority report of a panel appointed
by President Ferdinand Marcos. The panel conducted a 10-month inves
tigation of the case.
"The real work is about to begin." Fernandez told a news conference
two hours after formal murder charges were filed before a special court
organized by Marcos to try cases against government officials.
Peace talks seem to be at impasse
SAN SALVADOR. El Salvador— President Jose Napoleon Duarte's
peace talks with the Salvadoran rebel movement appear to have reached
a dangerous impasse, with months of delay likely before any new discus
sions.
Duarte, who raised broad hopes among Salvadorans as he began a
dialogue with the guerrillas in October, said in an interview Monday
night that he is seeking a sign of good faith from rebel leaders before
agreeing to the next round of negotiations.
"I don't want to fool around with the hopes of the people," he said.
"The answer is simple. They only have to come out and say. 'We don't
believe that violence is the way to seize power.' "
Insurgent leaders, at a briefing for foreign correspondents in Mexico
City yesterday, called on Duarte to respond to their request for a third
session of talks before the end of this month, which they said was for
warded to his government on Jan. 11.
Ruben Zamora of the Democratic Revolutionary Front, the insur
gents' political wing, said the rebels suspect that, because of pressure
from the right. Duarte is unable to hold any more talks until after the
March 17 legislative elections. If Duarte's Democratic Party does poorly
in the vote, the peace talks could be delayed "six or eight months or even
a year." Zamora told Washington Post special correspondent William
Orme Jr. in Mexico City.
Taiwan to battle China arms sale
lAIPEI. laiwan — Taiwan served notice yesterday that it is worried
about the possibility that the United States will agree to sell naval equip
ment to China, and said its supporters will seek to block any such deal in
the U.S. Congress.
In an interview with The Times. Raymond Hoo, chairman of Taiwan's
Coordination Council for North American Affairs, said recent reports
that the United States will help modernize the Chinese navy are "very
serious." If this modernization is carried out, he said, "the military bal
ance we have now (between China and Taiwan) will be disrupted."
Hoo pointed out that under U.S. law, any major weapons sales
negotiated by the Executive Branch must still be approved by Congress.
Asked whether a sale of naval equipment to China could be stopped in
Congress, he replied. "Yes. I think so."
"I can say frankly, we have many friends in the Congress, both in the
Democratic and Republican parties." said Hoo. whose council has been
in charge of all dealings with the United States since 1979, when Wash
ington broke diplomatic relations with Taiwan in order to normalize
them with China. "They have the consensus that selling any weapons to
communist countries should be examined very, very carefully."
Stock market records gains
NEW YORK — The stock market recorded some broadly-based
gains today although one closely-watched measure of its blue-chip issues
retreated.
Trading was especially heavy, as the market rapidly extended the pre
vious session's robust advance in the early going.
But the rally faded, however, in what several market analysts attrib
uted to a bout of profit-taking.
Today's weather
Today will be sunny with morning low clouds and fog clearing by early
afternoon. Highs will be from the mid 4()s to the upper 50s.

MANILA, Philippines — A government prosecutor charged armed
forces chief Gen. Fabian Ver, two other generals and 23 other men early
today in the double murder of opposition leader Benigno Aquino and
the man the army had claimed was his assassin.
Brig. Gen. Luther Custodio, chief of aviation security, and 16 other
soldiers were charged with direct participation in a military conspiracy to
kill Aquino as he stepped off a plane Aug. 2 1, 1983, after three years of
voluntary exile in the United States.
Ver, Maj. Gen. Prospero Olivas and six other soldiers were accused of
being accessories in a military attempt to cover up the assassinastion and
blame it on alleged communist agent Rolando Galman. A civilian
businessman, Hermilo Gosuico. was accused of being an accomplice to
the conspiracy.
Justice Bernardo Fernandez, government ombudsman, essentially fol
lowed the recommendations of the majority report of a panel appointed
by President Ferdinand Marcos. The panel conducted a 10-month inves
tigation of the case.
"The real work is about to begin." Fernandez told a news conference
two hours after formal murder charges were filed before a special court
organized by Marcos to try cases against government officials.
Peace talks seem to be at impasse
SAN SALVADOR. El Salvador— President Jose Napoleon Duarte's
peace talks with the Salvadoran rebel movement appear to have reached
a dangerous impasse, with months of delay likely before any new discus
sions.
Duarte, who raised broad hopes among Salvadorans as he began a
dialogue with the guerrillas in October, said in an interview Monday
night that he is seeking a sign of good faith from rebel leaders before
agreeing to the next round of negotiations.
"I don't want to fool around with the hopes of the people," he said.
"The answer is simple. They only have to come out and say. 'We don't
believe that violence is the way to seize power.' "
Insurgent leaders, at a briefing for foreign correspondents in Mexico
City yesterday, called on Duarte to respond to their request for a third
session of talks before the end of this month, which they said was for
warded to his government on Jan. 11.
Ruben Zamora of the Democratic Revolutionary Front, the insur
gents' political wing, said the rebels suspect that, because of pressure
from the right. Duarte is unable to hold any more talks until after the
March 17 legislative elections. If Duarte's Democratic Party does poorly
in the vote, the peace talks could be delayed "six or eight months or even
a year." Zamora told Washington Post special correspondent William
Orme Jr. in Mexico City.
Taiwan to battle China arms sale
lAIPEI. laiwan — Taiwan served notice yesterday that it is worried
about the possibility that the United States will agree to sell naval equip
ment to China, and said its supporters will seek to block any such deal in
the U.S. Congress.
In an interview with The Times. Raymond Hoo, chairman of Taiwan's
Coordination Council for North American Affairs, said recent reports
that the United States will help modernize the Chinese navy are "very
serious." If this modernization is carried out, he said, "the military bal
ance we have now (between China and Taiwan) will be disrupted."
Hoo pointed out that under U.S. law, any major weapons sales
negotiated by the Executive Branch must still be approved by Congress.
Asked whether a sale of naval equipment to China could be stopped in
Congress, he replied. "Yes. I think so."
"I can say frankly, we have many friends in the Congress, both in the
Democratic and Republican parties." said Hoo. whose council has been
in charge of all dealings with the United States since 1979, when Wash
ington broke diplomatic relations with Taiwan in order to normalize
them with China. "They have the consensus that selling any weapons to
communist countries should be examined very, very carefully."
Stock market records gains
NEW YORK — The stock market recorded some broadly-based
gains today although one closely-watched measure of its blue-chip issues
retreated.
Trading was especially heavy, as the market rapidly extended the pre
vious session's robust advance in the early going.
But the rally faded, however, in what several market analysts attrib
uted to a bout of profit-taking.

O'Neill will not obstruct budget
WASHINGTON — House Speaker Thomas ( l ip) O'Neill (I)-Mass.)
told President Reagan yesterday that he will not obstruct Ins budget in
the House but insisted that spending cuts to achieve deficit reductions
must come from defense as well as domestic programs.
O'Neill also said for the first time that Social Security was "on the
table" for bargaining over deficit cuts, but he told Reagan that the
Democrats will not take the lead in proposing cuts in any part of the
budget, including Social Security benefits.
In an extraordinarily conciliatory statement after a post-inaugural
meeting between Reagan and leaders of both parties in Congress.
O'Neill said he told the president that "in my 50 years of public life I've
never seen a man more popular than you are with the American
people," and added:
"We're not going in any way to thwart the will of the American
people, we're not going to be obstructionist in any manner."
But O'Neill also made it clear that Reagan and Senate Republicans
would have to take the lead in proposing controversial spending cuts to
reduce $200 billion annual deficits and thereby take the political conse
quences for the results.
GNP grows 6.8 percent in 1984
WASHINGTON — The U.S. economy grew at a healthy rate of b.H
percent during the 1984, closing out the fastest year of business expan
sion since 1951 and signaling another good performance for 1985. the
Department of Commerce reported yesterday.
Steady growth and low inflation should characterize the economy this
year, most analvsts believe, although the pace will not be as brisk as in
1984.
At the White House, President Reagan said in a statement "I am
delighted" with the news. "We are succeeding in building strong and las
ting economic growth without inflation." Reagan declared. "And I
believe these results demonstrate once again that our economic pro
gram, given a chance to work, has worked beautifully in spite of the
naysayers."
The administration had worked hard to maximize the favorable
publicity from the statistical reports, with Reagan providing a sneak
preview at an inaugural ball Monday night when he told a happy crowd
that the government would be announcing some of the best economic
news in three decades.
Shuttle mission delayed by cold
CAPE CANAVERAL. Fla. — A second night of freezing tempera
tures caused a 24-hour delay in the scheduled liftoff of the space shuttle
Discovery on its first military mission, NASA announced late yesterday.
Shortly before midnight, the National Aeronautics and Space Admin
istration announced that "extreme weather conditions in the area are
projected to cause icing conditions on the external tank" and said the
launch would be rescheduled for tomorrow afternoon.
At the time, the temperature was near freezing and dropping.
Officials worry that chunks of ice on the shuttle's huge external tank
could drop off and damage the shuttle on its climb into orbit.
The countdown had gotten behind because of ice on the launch pad
and frozen valves.
Temperatures were forecast in the mid-50s today.
