## Reagan supports anti-abortionists 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” President Reagan delivered
a pep talk to 70.000 shivering anti-abortion march
ers yesterday and called for a constitutional
amendment to protect the unborn, but both he and
"pro-life" leaders also emphatically denounced the
bombings of abortion clinics.
In his first public act following his inauguration
Monday, Reagan spoke by telephone from the
Oval Office to the demonstrators of all ages stand
ing in subfreezing temperatures on the Ellipse, a
quarter mile from the White House.
The protesters, who were marking the 12th an
niversary of the Supreme Court decision legalizing
most abortions, then marched two miles to the
court, where 29 were arrested as thev knelt in

prayer on the steps. Several demonstrators left a
tiny, black-draped mock casket on the court steps
as a symbol of their protest.
Reagan, who regards his signing of an abortion
liberalization bill as his biggest mistake as Califor
nia's governor, never before had addressed Wash
ington's annual "Right to Life March." although he
regularly had been asked to.
While the president's staunch anti-abortion posi
tion appeals politically to the avid "pro-life" ac
tivists, there is continuing evidence in public
opinion polls that the majority of Americans dis
agree with him.
Reagan, in his comments to the demonstrators,
recalled that in his State of the Union address last

year he urged Americans "to rise above bitterness
and reproach and seek a greater understanding of
this issue." He said that such understanding
"begins with the recognition of the reality of life
before birth and the reality of death by abortion."
Reagan told the marchers that "I feel these days,
as never before, the momentum is with us. .. .
There are already signs that we've changed the
public attitude on abortion. The number performed
each year is finally leveling off. The general feeling
that abortion is just a small, harmless medical pro
cedure that's simply a matter of choice has almost
disappeared. We're making progress."
