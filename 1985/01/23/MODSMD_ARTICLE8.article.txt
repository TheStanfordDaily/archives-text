# U.S. rejects Honduran proposal

TEGUCIGALPA. Honduras —
The Honduran government, increas
ingly worried about the consequences
of close military cooperation with the
United States, has gotten a cold
response from U.S. officials to
demands for a special defense treaty.
Honduran and U.S. sources say.
Honduras pressed the demand for
a defense pact during a visit here last
week by Robert McFarlane, Presi
dent Reagan's national security ad
viser. but got a negative response, of
ficials from both sides said.
"The Hondurans made it clear they
wanted something in writing. We
made it clear that such a treaty was
not in the cards," said a U.S. official
here.
Besides chafing at the image of
being the gringo's Central American
lackey, Honduras frets that its neigh
bors — Nicaragua, El Salvador and
Guatemala are arming at a threaten
ing rate. Because of that. Honduras is
asking for more U.S. military and
economic aid. as well as a defense
treaty.
The United States, though, main
tains that Honduras is already
protected under the 1947
hemisphere-wide Rio Treaty, and
that that Honduran concerns about
being left defenseless are exaggerated.
"It's a Honduran fantasy," said one.
And even though U.S. officials
promised to seek increased aid for
Honduras, for the last few years con
sidered a lynchpin to U.S. policy in
Central America, domestic budget
tightening seems a much bigger con
cern to Washington.
"Even if we don't sign a treaty,"
said a U.S. official, "where else can
the Hondurans go?"
It is not clear what steps Honduras
could take if left dissatisfied. Last fall,
the U.S. and Honduras established
government commissions to negotiate
their differences, and officials say no
threats have been made so far.

Still, the casual U.S. attitude is
making Honduras increasingly rest
less. Honduran officials have begun
expressing misgivings about all the
cooperation they have given the
United States in its twin efforts to ex
ert military pressure on Marxist
Nicaragua and to aid El Salvador
against a leftist insurgency.
Such cooperation has included:
• Playing host to CIA-backed
Nicaraguan rebels who operate near
the Honduras-Nicaragua border.
• Conducting joint training and exer
cises with U.S. troops.
• Giving the the United States use of
a major air base at Palmerola in
central Honduras.
• Until recently permitting troops
from El Salvador, a traditional mili
tary rival, to train on its soil.
Second thoughts about all that ac
tivity began to emerge in March, after
the ouster of U.S. friend Gen. Gus
tavo Alvarez as army strongman.
Since then, decisions have been sub
ject to heavy wrangling within the
powerful councils of the armed
forces.
Both the military and the civilian
government of President Roberto
Suazo Cordova now place greater
emphasis on Honduras' own needs in
its relations with the U.S.
"Honduras is not here just to take
orders from the U. 5.," said a govern
ment minister close the president.
Honduran Foreign Minister
Edgardo Paz Barnica told a press
conference yesterday, "We told Mr.
McFarlane that the government and
people of Honduras hope the United
States would be as understanding
with us as we have with the U.S."
However, the Hondurans came
away from the meeting only with a
verbal promise that "the government
of President Reagan will never aban
don its friends in Central America,"
Paz Barnica said.

Honduran officials contend that
the Rio Treaty is inadequate because
implementation depends on difticult
to-reach agreement among members
of the Organization of American
States. Besides. Honduras, like many
Latin states, considers the Rio Treaty
moot because the United States sup
ported Britain rather than Argentina
during the Falklands War.
The Hondurans also point to un
steady U.S. policies in Central
America as proof of a need tor new
assurances. Foremost among these is
the apparent end to U.S. funding for

Nicaraguan rebels who have operated
in Honduras. Although the Reagan
administration promises to fight in
Congress for renewed aid. chances
for further funding are considered
slim.
The specter of thousands of im
poverished, armed rebels fleeing
Nicaragua into Honduras disturbs the
Honduran government.
"What are we going to do with an
other army here?" asked one military
official.
