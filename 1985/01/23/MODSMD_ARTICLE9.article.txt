TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras â€”
Fog and stormy weather during
the night forced U.S. officials to
interrupt the search for a U.S. Air
Force plane carrying 21
Americans that went down in the
Caribbean about 500 yards off
Honduras' coast, a U.S. Embassy
spokesman said.
Robert Callahan, the embassy's
press attache, said the C-130A
transport was on its way to the
Honduran coastal town of Trujillo
from Howard Air Force Base in
Panama when it splashed into the
water about 11 a.m. EST yester
day.
The embassy spokesman said
the first reports of the plane going
down came from Honduran fisher
men, although no wreckage was
sighted by searchers.
He said the search was
suspended after several hours be
cause of a combination of rain,
fog, wind and high seas. The
search was expected to be

resumed today, as soon as weather
permitted.
Callahan said the five crew
members and 16 passengers were
"all U.S. personnel, that's our un
derstanding."
The plane was assigned to the
440 th Tactical Airlift Wing, an Air
Force reserve unit based at Billy
Mitchell Field in Milwaukee, he
said.
"No hostile action was indicated
in the mishap," according to a
statement issued by U.S. military
officials at Palmerola Air Base, 90
miles northwest of Tegucigalpa,
the Honduran capital.
The Americans were at the
Honduran base for training exer
cises.
Trujillo is about 240 miles north
of Tegucigalpa and is near a
regional military training center
for Honduran and Salvadoran
troops.
