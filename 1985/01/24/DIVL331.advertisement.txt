DO YOU
BELIEVE
.. .today's technology represents only
a preview of the possible?
We do too! So, join us in probing the frontiers of science and
technology with basic and applied research at sophisticated levels.
We are not probing just a few frontiers. Consider these: laser optics,
infrared electro-optical systems and fiber optics; microelectronics,
semiconductors and semicustom IC/hybrid circuits; advanced control
concents, signal and image processing, robotics, CAD/CAM; gas
turbine technology, fluid dynamics, combustion, aeroacoustics;
materials science; V/STOL technology, aeromechanics, applied
mechanics; automotive technology; building systems technology;
manufacturing technology, NDE, industrial lasers; computer science,
software engineering, artificial intelligence, digital applications and
operating systems.
During the remainder of this decade United Technologies plans to
spend an average of $1 billion annually on R&D. Few other U.S.
corporations make such substantial investments in their future.
Think about it!
