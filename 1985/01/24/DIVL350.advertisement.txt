I SYSTEMS DESIGN PROGRAMMERS
Microsoft Corporation develops the leading edge in microcomputer systems
software Our BASIC is world renowned. Our XENIX and MS-DOS operating systems
have computer companies and others chomping at the bit. We design state-of-the
art systems software.
We need programmers to work on Operating Systems, Compilers (FORTRAN, COBOL
Pascal, BASIC, C), Data Base Management Systems, Word Processing, Interactive
Systems, Graphics and more.
Our OEM customer base is a Who's Who of the hardware business (IBM, Apple, Radio
Shack Intel, Tektronix). As new systems like the IBM PC and new processors, like the
68000 are developed, Microsoft's programmers get their hands on the machines
before they go into production. So your hardware suggestions and software
innovations during R&D become part of the computers of the future.
Microsoft provides the best systems programming work environment
• all the high-level hardware (DEC-20, PDP 11, VAX, SUN 68000 machines) and
software development tools you'll need, in a
• small company with lots of interaction and sharing of ideas and methods where
• you can develop your full potential.
And to make a good thing better, Microsoft is located in the Great Pacific Northwest
with
• mountains, skiing, ocean, desert, rain forest, rivers and lakes all within easy reach
• major cultural sports, social and commercial activities fifteen minutes away in
Seattle.
We are looking for exceptional software design programmers — those with
intelligence, drive, and a commitment to excellence.
We want programmers who will create Microsoft High Performance Software.
Microsoft offers an excellent compensation and benefits package. Jo Ann Rahal,
Technical Recruiter, Dept. WZ, MICROSOFT CORPORATION, 10700 Northup Way, Box
97200, Bellevue, Washington 98009. We are an equal opportunity employer.
