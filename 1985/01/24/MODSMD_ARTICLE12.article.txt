## The
						Stanford Daily A
						humanitarian issue 
### 
The debate over Stanford's South African in
vestments took a hopeful turn last week when the
Commission on Investment Responsibility (C
-IR) voted unanimously to recommend condi
tional divestiture of the University's shares in
Motorola Corporation.
But before that recommendation reaches the
board of trustee's Subcommittee on Investment
Responsibility, it's time to set something straight:
Is divestiture a political question on which the
University ought not to take a stand, or are we
dealing with a humanitarian issue that demands
our official attention and support?
After last week's South African solidarity rally
in White Plaza, William Massy, vice president for
business and finance and liaison between the
University and the board of trustees, promised to
do his best to "involve himself' in recommending
responsible divestment policies.
But Massy hit a nerve when he said that as a
public trust, the University could not espouse po
litical causes regardless of the morality of its aim.
"Let me give you an extreme example, not an
analogue," Massy said. "If a trustee, or a vice
president, or a student or a faculty member
believes strongly in a good cause — let's call it the
Boy Scouts or the Girl Scouts — [he has] no

rights to University assets to further that cause,
no matter how good it is."
Massy's pledge commands respect, and his
concerns underscore the need to stress the
humanitarian imperative — not the political sig
nificance — of divestiture as the hoard prepares
to act at this crucial stage. One person's "cause"
is another's necessity, but it can he tough to fuse
the two perspectives.
There are some outstanding exceptions. In the
early 19705, classified experiments at the Stan
ford Research Institute (SRI) took on enormous
humanitarian and political import. Stanford as a
public trust took action, severing ties and even
changing SRl's name so the "S" would no longer
be associated with the University.
Whether the trustees will view divestiture
through a political or humanitarian prism has an
awful lot to do with how the Stanford community
argues the case.
Apartheid is a political system. It also crushes
the opportunity for developing human potential:
potential that is the very soul of any university.
And at this critical stage, we would do well to
stress that without a soul, even the best intentions
of a great university are meaningless.
