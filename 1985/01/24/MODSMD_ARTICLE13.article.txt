## Freeze alive and well 
### 
The nuclear freeze, Ralph Cossa
tells us in a provocative opinion
piece (The Daily, Jan. 18), is an
"outdated" idea which is obstructing
real progress in arms control. In an
article marked by half-truths, distor
tions and plain old-fashioned ignor
ance, Cossa tells us that the freeze
concept is too vague, that a freeze
would be impossible to verify and
that it would leave the United States
at a military disadvantage. Let's
scrutinize these claims one by one.
First, the claim that the freeze is a
vague concept having "almost as

VIEWPOINT

many definitions as it has advocates."
In her original "Call to Halt the Arms
Race," Randall Forsberg, originator
of the freeze, suggested a "mutual,
verifiable freeze on the testing, pro
duction and deployment of nuclear
weapons and their delivery systems."
The idea is as precise as it is simple
and economical: We'll stop building
nuclear weapons if they do.
Compare this with such
grotesquely complicated documents
as SALT I, SALT II and the ABM
Treaty. Here even the expert reader
gets lost in mazes of subordinate
clauses, so it's no wonder the Ameri
can and Soviet governments cannot
agree whether or not the treaties have
been violated. In the case of a freeze,
on the other hand, if either side
develops a single new nuclear
weapon, they would clearly have vio
lated the agreement. No ambiguity in
that!
Now to more serious allegations.
Cossa claims that a freeze on the pro
duction of nuclear weapons would
not be verifiable since our satellites
"cannot see inside buildings any more
than they can see inside crates aboard
Soviet ships bound for Nicaragua."
This is a misleading statement for two
reasons.
First, it is not a matter of "seeing
inside" buildings: We know the loca
tions of all the Soviet nuclear weap
ons factories, and our infra-red
detectors can tell us when their power

supply is in use and when radioactive
materials are being processed. The
factories could not be used without
our knowledge. This has led such for
midable intelligence experts as
William Colby (former President
Nixon's CIA director) to testify that a
freeze could be verified by national
technical means.
Second, since he discusses only
verification by technical means,
Cossa omits to mention the main
issue: In 1980, the Soviets agreed for
the first time to the principle of on
site inspection. This great
breakthrough at the negotiating table
would make a freeze even easier to
verify, since it would allow American
officials to inspect Soviet factories
and silos in person.
Finally, Cossa tells us that a freeze
would leave America at a technologi
cal disadvantage since a much greater
percentage of Soviet than American
strategic delivery systems were built
in the last 10 years. This argument is
dishonest for two reasons.
First, it focuses on delivery systems
(i.e. missiles) instead of what really
matters — the warheads. While the
Soviets spent the 1970s building
entire new missiles, we just put new
warheads and improved guidance sys
tems onto our old missiles. Most of
our Minuteman missiles are now
equipped with Mark 12A warheads,
which have an accuracy of 250
meters. The most accurate Soviet
strategic missile, the SS-18, has an ac
curacy of only 350 meters. The Mark
12A warhead makes our old
Minuteman missiles more threatening
than anything the Soviets have.
Cossa's second trick is to count
weapons in percentages rather than
absolute numbers. Ten years ago the
Soviets found themselves lagging far
behind in the arms race: They had
only half as many nuclear weapons as
the United.States and they set out to
close the gap. Expressed in
percentage terms this makes their
building program seem much greater
than ours, but in reality we have built
4,600 new nuclear weapons against
their 5,300 since SALT I was signed

in 1972. (This, by the way, puts us
2,000 strategic warheads ahead of the
Soviet Union today.)
Cossa is right about one thing,
however: A freeze would prevent
modernization of the two super
powers' arsenals. Indeed, that is
precisely what it was designed to do.
and for good reason. Modernization
sounds like a stabilizing, desirable
phenomenon, but it is actually the
reverse. It would mean building new
weapons such as the cruise, Pershing
2, Trident, MX and Stealth
which are more accurate and harder
to detect. The accuracy and undetec
tability of these weapons would give
the United States a credible first
strike capability for the first time.
That is why President Reagan wants
the weapons and opposes the freeze.
He hopes to "win" the arms race, and
the freeze stands in his way.
The main purpose of the freeze is
not to stop the quantitative escalation
of the arms race but to stop its
qualitative escalation, since the latter
is more destabilizing to the strategic
balance. If the new generation of
weapons is built by both sides it will
move us away from the current situa
tion of mutual deterrence to a new
situation in which both sides are under
pressure in a crisis to use their weap
ons first or risk losing them.
Freeze supporters say that, since
both sides have massive overkill and,
for the first time, rough parity, this is
a good time to give up the arms race.
It is a moderate, sensible proposal,
and opinion polls show it enjoys the
support of 75 percent of the Ameri
can people. Cossa accuses the freeze
movement of obstructionism for in
sisting on getting its own way. He for
gets that, in a democracy, you do not
accuse the majority of being
obstructive. Reagan is the obstructive
one for refusing to give three quarters
of his people what they want.

supply is in use and when radioactive
materials are being processed. The
factories could not be used without
our knowledge. This has led such for
midable intelligence experts as
William Colby (former President
Nixon's CIA director) to testify that a
freeze could be verified by national
technical means.
Second, since he discusses only
verification by technical means,
Cossa omits to mention the main
issue: In 1980, the Soviets agreed for
the first time to the principle of on
site inspection. This great
breakthrough at the negotiating table
would make a freeze even easier to
verify, since it would allow American
officials to inspect Soviet factories
and silos in person.
Finally, Cossa tells us that a freeze
would leave America at a technologi
cal disadvantage since a much greater
percentage of Soviet than American
strategic delivery systems were built
in the last 10 years. This argument is
dishonest for two reasons.
First, it focuses on delivery systems
(i.e. missiles) instead of what really
matters — the warheads. While the
Soviets spent the 1970s building
entire new missiles, we just put new
warheads and improved guidance sys
tems onto our old missiles. Most of
our Minuteman missiles are now
equipped with Mark 12A warheads,
which have an accuracy of 250
meters. The most accurate Soviet
strategic missile, the SS-18, has an ac
curacy of only 350 meters. The Mark
12A warhead makes our old
Minuteman missiles more threatening
than anything the Soviets have.
Cossa's second trick is to count
weapons in percentages rather than
absolute numbers. Ten years ago the
Soviets found themselves lagging far
behind in the arms race: They had
only half as many nuclear weapons as
the United.States and they set out to
close the gap. Expressed in
percentage terms this makes their
building program seem much greater
than ours, but in reality we have built
4,600 new nuclear weapons against
their 5,300 since SALT I was signed

in 1972. (This, by the way, puts us
2,000 strategic warheads ahead of the
Soviet Union today.)
Cossa is right about one thing,
however: A freeze would prevent
modernization of the two super
powers' arsenals. Indeed, that is
precisely what it was designed to do.
and for good reason. Modernization
sounds like a stabilizing, desirable
phenomenon, but it is actually the
reverse. It would mean building new
weapons such as the cruise, Pershing
2, Trident, MX and Stealth
which are more accurate and harder
to detect. The accuracy and undetec
tability of these weapons would give
the United States a credible first
strike capability for the first time.
That is why President Reagan wants
the weapons and opposes the freeze.
He hopes to "win" the arms race, and
the freeze stands in his way.
The main purpose of the freeze is
not to stop the quantitative escalation
of the arms race but to stop its
qualitative escalation, since the latter
is more destabilizing to the strategic
balance. If the new generation of
weapons is built by both sides it will
move us away from the current situa
tion of mutual deterrence to a new
situation in which both sides are under
pressure in a crisis to use their weap
ons first or risk losing them.
Freeze supporters say that, since
both sides have massive overkill and,
for the first time, rough parity, this is
a good time to give up the arms race.
It is a moderate, sensible proposal,
and opinion polls show it enjoys the
support of 75 percent of the Ameri
can people. Cossa accuses the freeze
movement of obstructionism for in
sisting on getting its own way. He for
gets that, in a democracy, you do not
accuse the majority of being
obstructive. Reagan is the obstructive
one for refusing to give three quarters
of his people what they want.

The nuclear freeze, Ralph Cossa
tells us in a provocative opinion
piece (The Daily, Jan. 18), is an
"outdated" idea which is obstructing
real progress in arms control. In an
article marked by half-truths, distor
tions and plain old-fashioned ignor
ance, Cossa tells us that the freeze
concept is too vague, that a freeze
would be impossible to verify and
that it would leave the United States
at a military disadvantage. Let's
scrutinize these claims one by one.
First, the claim that the freeze is a
vague concept having "almost as

VIEWPOINT

many definitions as it has advocates."
In her original "Call to Halt the Arms
Race," Randall Forsberg, originator
of the freeze, suggested a "mutual,
verifiable freeze on the testing, pro
duction and deployment of nuclear
weapons and their delivery systems."
The idea is as precise as it is simple
and economical: We'll stop building
nuclear weapons if they do.
Compare this with such
grotesquely complicated documents
as SALT I, SALT II and the ABM
Treaty. Here even the expert reader
gets lost in mazes of subordinate
clauses, so it's no wonder the Ameri
can and Soviet governments cannot
agree whether or not the treaties have
been violated. In the case of a freeze,
on the other hand, if either side
develops a single new nuclear
weapon, they would clearly have vio
lated the agreement. No ambiguity in
that!
Now to more serious allegations.
Cossa claims that a freeze on the pro
duction of nuclear weapons would
not be verifiable since our satellites
"cannot see inside buildings any more
than they can see inside crates aboard
Soviet ships bound for Nicaragua."
This is a misleading statement for two
reasons.
First, it is not a matter of "seeing
inside" buildings: We know the loca
tions of all the Soviet nuclear weap
ons factories, and our infra-red
detectors can tell us when their power

supply is in use and when radioactive
materials are being processed. The
factories could not be used without
our knowledge. This has led such for
midable intelligence experts as
William Colby (former President
Nixon's CIA director) to testify that a
freeze could be verified by national
