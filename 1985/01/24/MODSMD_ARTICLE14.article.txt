Classical appeal
In a recent article (The Daily. Jan.
17) an increase in numbers of those
studying foreign languages at Stan
ford was reported. The text of this
and the accompanying diagram made
plain the underlying assumption that
"foreign language" and "modern
foreign language" are the same
thing. I should like to point out that
the existence of a flourishing Depart
ment of Classics, the offerings of
which are recognized in the Univer
sity's foreign language requirements,
contradicts that assumption. The
article devoted most of its space to
pragmatic applications of modern
foreign languages, and on this side
we have our contribution to make
(e.g. we offer a course of Greek and
Latin Words in Medical Terminol
ogy): some may have noticed a
report in a December issue of Time

which pointed out that Spanish
speaking schoolchildren who take
courses in Latin often find them the
most relevant of all to themselves. It
is true that The Daily article also
gave fair space to the cultural
reasons for learning foreign lan
guages, and no department can
better satisfy such instincts than ours,
since we take as our province not
only the languages and literature of
Greece and Rome but also their
history, philosophy, science, religion
and art. Stop by Building 20 and
sample our offerings yourself.

Freshman credibility
I am amazed and appalled by the
recent report (The Daily, Jan. 22) on
the alleged assault that occurred at
the Beta Theta Pi party. In the

report. Judicial Affairs Officer Sally
Cole concluded, after talking to a
dozen or so onlookers, that Keane
had merely grabbed hold of Char
iotte Lowson while falling down the
stairs and that "he was not trying to
remove her clothing" or presumably
holding onto her for any length of
time at all. This raises several ques
tions in my mind: If Keane was
merely tripping down the stairs, how
does one explain the four other
assault charges filed by four other
women? Is the testimony of on
lookers who were implicated in the
incident, several of whom were
probably fraternity members in
danger of losing their house, more
reliable than the testimony of a
woman who had nothing to gain by
her report aside from the hostility of
several members of the Stanford
community? If the incident lasted
only two minutes, why did Lowson's

male friend have to pull Keane off
her?
I can understand that the differing
testimony could raise doubts about
the true events of that evening. What
I cannot understand is how respon
sible adults such as Cole and
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons can take that doubt and
change it into a certainty that the
situation was entirely misperceived
by Lowson.
It seems that the report did not do
any more than smooth over a poten
tially sticky situation. If Cole had
concluded that the Betas or the party
goers were in some way to blame for
the incident. Student Affairs might
have had to take some action. That
would have been infinitely more
problematic than writing off the
stories of a couple of freshmen.
