## Now is the time

At dinner one night last week, someone asked me an in
teresting question, namely: "What should students do
before they graduate?" I'm a resident assistant, see. so I
guess he expected me to know about what happens
around Stanford. Nevertheless, the question caught me
off guard. At first, I responded by telling him some of the
things that I had done during my nearly five years at Stan
ford. I told him that he should go to the beach at least
once in the course of his Stanford career and preferably
once a quarter. I told him that he should go to the Ex
ploratorium in San Francisco. Once I thought of San
Francisco, I got on a roll. "Go to see a play at the A.C.T.
See "A Christmas Carol" at least once. Go to the ballet.
Go to the Museum of Modern Art. Go to the ballet again.
Go see a stand-up at a comedy club. Go shopping in
Chinatown," I advised him.
After I ran out of immediate responses, I paused to
reconsider the question. The person who asked the ques-

We can keep all of the
values our parents gave us,
we can keep some and
throw others out or we can
create an entirely new set of
values.

tion was not looking simply for a list of fun things to do in
and around the Bay Area. He could watch "Evening Mag
azine" or "Entertainment Tonight" if he wanted to know
what's happening in the Bay Area.
The question can best be understood from the vantage
point of education, and could be rephrased, "What should
I do during my college years to make my education com
plete?" Clearly, education does not end in the classroom,
and actually, I would say that it does not even begin there.
One learns much more out of the classroom than in it.
Education assumes many forms during our stay at Stan
ford because we as people are broadening our views of the
world. As we enter Stanford, most of us are leaving the
shelter of our parents for the first time. We can stay out all
night, we can drink as much as we want whenever we
want, we can do virtually whatever we want. We get to ex
periment and create our own values. We can keep all of
the values our parents gave us, we can keep some and
throw others out or we can create an entirely new set of
values. So, to complete an education, one should explore
new activities, new relationships, new living situations and
new ideas, so that one can make the most informed deci

sions about what values to believe.
Stanford, with all of its diversity, money and students,
gives us all an unparalleled opportunity to explore our
lives and values. At no other time in our lives will we live
with so many people our age and who share our interests.
At no other time in our lives will we have so many cultural
opportunities. At no other time in our lives will we have
the opportunity to learn about almost anything we want
to.
At no other time in your life will you have as many op
portunities to see so much great art so cheaply. For exam
ple, Stanford has at least two art galleries right here on
campus. We have one of the largest collections of Rodins
in the entire world. This is all free. There are at least two
dozen dramatic performances on campus each year aod
more than half of them are free. Stanford attracts a large
number of musicians; nearly every weekend, there is a
concert at Dinkelspiel Auditorium. There are always
speakers on almost any issue you can imagine from U.S.
out of Central America, to South African apartheid, to
why we should build the High Frontier defense system.
And if there are no speakers speaking on a topic you
would like to know more about, you can probably find an
expert on campus who would love to come and talk. We
have one of the greatest faculty in the world; we might as
well get everything we can out of them.
Our college years are also the time to become educated
emotionally. We have the opportunity to enter into a
number of different kinds of emotional relationships, to
learn of the delights of love, the sadness of love and the
rewards of friendship. To learn of. love and friendship
demands that one take risks. You must risk rejection in
asking an interesting woman from class to meet you at the
Coffee House; one must risk embarrassment when asking
a man to a Sunday Flick. Though that person may say no,
and though that person may turn out to be a jerk or a dull
ard, that person might also turn out to be exciting and fun.
Either way, you gained some maturity.
In short, before one graduates from Stanford, one
should explore everything that this school and this area
have to offer. One should date as many people as possible,
one should go snow camping in the Sierras with some
friends in your house or with Stanford Outdoor Ad
ventures and Recreation, one should go to Point Reyes,
one should go to Napa with a beautiful woman or man,
one should see the Rodin sculptures, one should take a
poetry class and write a poem to a friend, one should go to
Owens House and volunteer, one should live in a co-op or
self-op and learn to take care of oneself, one should or
ganize a fire party at the end of the year and burn all of
one's notes from the entire year, one should go to a
workshop at the Bridge, one should go to a resume writing
workshop at the Career Placement and Planning Center,
one should go the Rare Books Collection at Green Li
brary and one should have a lot of fun whenever possible.
Most important, one shouldn't wait for one's R.A. or
someone else to show one what to do: one should take re
sponsibility for one's own education.
