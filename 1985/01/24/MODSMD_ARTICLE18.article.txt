## Jason Cole Another Super Bowl? Thank you, no. 
### 
For approximately the past week
and a half, I've been trying to
decide whether or not the Super
Bowl was or is something Stanford
University should be involved in.
At nights, 1 toss and turn trying
to resolve this question of social
significance. I've lost countless
hours of sleep rolling this question
over in my mind.
Well, not really. But it has
bugged me a little and, after seeing
the game in person on Sunday, I
was leaning toward the negative
side of the issue. To be absolutely
honest, the spectacle that was
Super Bowl XIX left me feeling a
bit embarrassed.
Why? Well, it wasn't the game it
self certainly. The game ended up
being four hours of boredom, not
embarrassment. What really both
ered me were the peripheral forms
of entertainment. Specifically, the
pre-game and halftime shows and
the televised appearances by Presi
dent Reagan.
The pre-game show, which those
of you who were viewing on televi
sion didn't see, featured dancing
girls and caricatures of the National
Football League's 28 teams. The
blatant stupidity of it all didn't
bother me until one of the final mu
sical numbers began.
The refrain of this number was,
"You've got to be a football hero to
get along with a beautiful girl."
Score a point for misguided values.
The halftime show, which was
televised by ABC, was so jingoistic
that I thought I was going to be ill. I
don't remember the exact words to
it, but it went something like,
"Ideas can only exist in a country
where freedom is the highest
ideal."
Then, on top of all of this,
Reagan becomes part of this com
mercial wonderama by flipping the
coin before the game and then con
gratulating the 49ers via satellite
afterward. Now I know it's tradi
tion for the president to throw out
the first ball in baseball and to call
in his congratulations, but making
the president such an integral part of
the telecast is overstepping the
bounds of good taste.
Stanford can always say it wasn't
responsible for what was said or
done during the Super Bowl. The
fact is, it didn't write or approve
any of it. The Air Force was in
charge of the halftime show, which
explains the jingoism.

But the image projected to the
approximately 100 million viewers
was a product associated with Stan
ford. It is something Stanford
represents regardless of its degree
of involvement.
Add to all these factors the no
tion that this university (or any uni
versity, for that matter) is not
supposed to be in the entertain
ment business in the first place, and
I was down on the idea of Stanford
getting involved in another Super
Bowl. But I decided to mull over
the whole idea a little longer.
On Tuesday, I talked to Stanford
Athletic Director Andy Geiger,
who is advocating another Super
Bowl at Stanford. After a short
conversation with him, I was ab
solutely convinced.
Stanford should never even
consider hosting another Super
Bowl.
Geiger had several interesting
things to say after I told him that I
wasn't sure about whether Stanford
should host another big game.
"How do you expect me to get
$2.5 million worth of renovations
for the stadium," Geiger said.
I've got to give it to him there.
The stadium does have some much
needed changes thanks to dona
tions and revenues resulting from
the Super Bowl. According to As
soc. Athletic Director Alan Cum
mings, Stanford also stands to make
between $150,000 and $200,000
from its share of everything from
concessions to novelties to the fees
for corporate tailgaters. Not a bad
piece of change.
But then, I think, Geiger got a
little off the track. He said, "You
expect us to put out winning teams
and criticize us if we don't. . . .
Then when we do something to im
prove, you sit back and criticize it
because you don't think it fits the
University's image."
He finished his argument with,
"How do you expect us to recruit if
we don't have the Super Bowl?"
I didn't argue with him, I merely
restated my original point and then
got off the phone. But then 1
thought about what he had to say
and it occurred to me he was
wrong.
The premise of Geiger's state
ments is that the Super Bowl is
somehow integral to Stanford's ath
letic success. I understand that one
of the big reasons Stanford hosted

the game was for some exposure,
hut I don't think we should try to
predicate our teams' futures on
whether we have an event like the
Super Bowl.
That, however, is just what
Geiger is trying to do. In fact, he is
saying Stanford is somehow differ
ent from other schools and can't
compete with them unless it has the
advantage of a Super Bowl.
I expect Stanford to have
winning athletic teams, as does
everyone involved with this univer
sity. But 1 don't want Stanford to be
a winner because it has an unfair
advantage over everyone else.
That's exactly what the Super
Bowl is. The fact of the matter is
that no other university in the
country is capable of hosting a
Super Bowl besides Stanford. No
other school has a big enough
stadium in a big enough city with
the proper climate.
Schools like the University of
Southern California, UCLA, the
University of Nebraska, the Uni
versity of Michigan and George
town University don't get to host
the Super Bowl but still produce
winning athletic teams.
They can't offer potential
recruits Super Bowl tickets as an in
centive to sign a letter of intent to
attend, which is what Stanford
tried to do. Fortunately, the Na
tional Collegiate Athletic Associa
tion shot that attempt down, citing
that it was an unfair recruiting ad
vantage.
I realize that these schools don't
have the academic standards of
Stanford, but that's a poor excuse
for not being successful. In the past,
Stanford has been able to produce
bowl teams in football, not to men
tion championship-caliber teams in
tennis, water polo and swimming.
So to say Stanford should use the
Super Bowl as a recruiting tool is
both self-deprecating and unfair to
other schools.
Which is what has pushed my
opinion to the negative point of
view. If Geiger wants to be able to
say to potential recruits, "Hey,
come to Stanford and you can see
the Super Bowl," I don't want to be
associated with the Stanford Ath
letic Department.
The next person to make a deci
sion on this issue will be University
President Donald Kennedy. 1 only
hope that his decision will be an
emphatic "No."
