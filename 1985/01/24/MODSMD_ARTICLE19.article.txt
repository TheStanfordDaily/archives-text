## 
### JOHN LIS Staff sportswriter 
Forward Kami Anderson scored a
career-high 30 points and guard Vir
ginia Sourlis added a career-high 29
to lead the Stanford women's basket
ball team to an 81-77 victory over the
University of the Pacific last night in
Stockton.
Anderson shot 12 of 19 from the
field and six of nine from the foul line
and became the first Cardinal in more
than two years to score 30 points.
Jeanne Ruark-Hoff, the top scorer in
Stanford history, was the last to do so.
She scored 32 against Delta State
University in the first game of the
1982-83 season.
Anderson also led Stanford in
rebounding with nine.
Sourlis shot 11 of 14 from the field
and seven of 12 from the line to bet
ter her previous career best of 25, set
last year against Florida State Uni
versity. Sourlis played the entire
game.
"We were once again effective be
cause of our ball movement," Asst.
Coach Mike Kehoe said. "Moving the
ball quickly enables us to get the open
shots. Kami and Virginia played great
games, but you don't win with just
two people. It was a team effort all
the way."
That was apparent in the statistics,
which showed Stanford with 19 as
sists on 33 field goals. Sourlis and
guard Charli Turner had six each.
"They played us mostly in a man
to-man," Kehoe said. "They started
in a 2-3 zone, but we moved the ball
for some excellent shots. We got ex
cellent ball movement and shots on
the wing from 15 to 18 feet out
against the man, and we buried
them."
The Cardinal came out firing in the
first half, making 20 of its 26 shots
from the field — a 77 percent effort.
Seventeen of those 20 baskets were
from 15 feet out or more. Sourlis had
20 poin'.s ariu Anderson had 15 as
Stanford opened a 49-36 lead at the
intermission.
Stanford led by as much as 20 when
Karen Goedewaagen hit a layup to
make it 60-40 with 15:58 remaining,
but the Lady Tigers began a slow
comeback. With 13 seconds left,
Stanford led, 80-77, and Sourlis hit
the front end of a one-and-one for
the final point.
Stanford evened its overall record
at 9-9, and UOP fell to 5-15. The tri
umph gave the Cardinal a three-game
winning streak for the first time in ex
actly two years. Stanford goes for its
fourth straight tomorrow night in
Moraga against St. Mary's College.
