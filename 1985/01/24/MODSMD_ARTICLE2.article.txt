# Senior wins Marshall award

### KATHLEEN O'ROURKE 
Last quarter Janet Feigenbaum, a
senior here, received a phone call
from Sir George of the British Coun
cil congratulating her on becoming
Stanford's 25th recipient of the Mar
shall Scholarship.
Feigenbaum, a psychobiology
major, plans to use the scholarship to
study biochemistry at either Oxford
or Sussex University. A final decision
on which university she will attend
will be made by the British Council
this week.
In addition to two years' tuition, a
stipend for books, room and board,
fees, two round-trip airline tickets
and 300 British pounds per month for
expenses, Feigenbaum will be put in a
position of much prestige for the
duration of her stay in England.
"The interviewers seemed to be
checking how I would represent
American youth. They were testing

my reactions to certain events that
might happen," she said. In the weeks
before the interview, Feigenbaum
versed herself in the world's recent
affairs by reading every newspaper
and magazine she could find.
The interview turned out much dif
ferently. "It was just like a tea
party. . . . There was a fireplace; it
was very comfortable," she said.
Feigenbaum's triumph is the fruit
of many long hours spent over appli
cations and in interview preparations.
The process began last May after she
was elected Phi Beta Kappa. She col
lected five recommendations and a
crucial endorsement from Stanford
and was subsequently recommended
to the British Council as a Marshall
candidate.
A major part of the application is a
very long personal essay. Feiganbaum
said, "Essays about myself took all
summer. I must have had 10 people

read them, and I made constant
changes. It's so hard to write why you
do things and what you are. At the
same time you can't come off false.
As a researcher it's easy for me to
come off sounding like I want to save
the world." One line of her essay
reads, "I don't want to conjure up the
image of a lone scientist in a sterile
lab." She said, "1 think I came up
with that one at about 1 a.m."
Feigenbaum is by no means a lone
scientist. She is also a member of the
Stanford administrative panel on lab
oratory animal care and belongs to
Ram's Head, where she has "done
just about everything," including
producing, directing and technical
work. She is also a singer with
Savoyards and the University chorus.
Feigenbaum's major is an
independently-designed program.
She transferred from Harvard after
her freshman year and . . knew

precisely what I wanted to do and
knew why already available majors
couldn't accommodate me." Her pro
gram uses the Human Biology De
partment's neurobiology division in
conjunction with the Psychology De
partment's division in psychobiology.
Feigenbaum is currently working
on her senior thesis on essential cir
cuit memory in rabbits with Richard
Thompson, professor of human biol
ogy and psychology and founder of
the Human Biology Department.
"My research is a few pieces in the
puzzle of building biochemical and
neurobiological models of the brain."
The hope is to figure out the anatomi
cal features of memory, because
memory is a function of learning.
Feigenbaum said, "the assumption is
that animals think in the same way as
humans, but on a more simplistic
level. Someday we may be able to im
prove human learning." Feigen
baum's interest in this field began
years ago at a seminar where she was
exposed to the idea that the super
ego, ego and id could be linked to
anatomical structures in the brain.
She said she plans on researching
learning in invertebrates and then ob
taining a Doctorate in neurobiology.
She added, "I want to be a professor.
I've always wanted to be one and I
like seven-year sabbaticals."
The Marshall Scholarship was es
tablished in 1953 by the British gov

eminent in appreciation of the aid
provided by the United States
through the Marshall Plan after
World War 11.
Competition for the scholarship is
regional with the Pacific and New En
gland areas the most competitive. In
the Pacific region, 300 people ap
plied. 16 received British council in
terviews and four were named
recipients ol the Marshall Scholar
ship.

candidate.
A major part of the application is a
very long personal essay. Feiganbaum
said, "Essays about myself took all
summer. I must have had 10 people

read them, and I made constant
changes. It's so hard to write why you
do things and what you are. At the
same time you can't come off false.
As a researcher it's easy for me to
come off sounding like I want to save
the world." One line of her essay
reads, "I don't want to conjure up the
image of a lone scientist in a sterile
lab." She said, "1 think I came up
with that one at about 1 a.m."
Feigenbaum is by no means a lone
scientist. She is also a member of the
Stanford administrative panel on lab
oratory animal care and belongs to
Ram's Head, where she has "done
just about everything," including
producing, directing and technical
work. She is also a singer with
Savoyards and the University chorus.
Feigenbaum's major is an
independently-designed program.
She transferred from Harvard after
her freshman year and . . knew

precisely what I wanted to do and
knew why already available majors
couldn't accommodate me." Her pro
gram uses the Human Biology De
partment's neurobiology division in
conjunction with the Psychology De
partment's division in psychobiology.
Feigenbaum is currently working
on her senior thesis on essential cir
cuit memory in rabbits with Richard
Thompson, professor of human biol
ogy and psychology and founder of
the Human Biology Department.
"My research is a few pieces in the
puzzle of building biochemical and
neurobiological models of the brain."
The hope is to figure out the anatomi
cal features of memory, because
memory is a function of learning.
Feigenbaum said, "the assumption is
that animals think in the same way as
humans, but on a more simplistic
level. Someday we may be able to im
prove human learning." Feigen
baum's interest in this field began
years ago at a seminar where she was
exposed to the idea that the super
ego, ego and id could be linked to
anatomical structures in the brain.
She said she plans on researching
learning in invertebrates and then ob
taining a Doctorate in neurobiology.
She added, "I want to be a professor.
I've always wanted to be one and I
like seven-year sabbaticals."
The Marshall Scholarship was es
tablished in 1953 by the British gov

eminent in appreciation of the aid
provided by the United States
through the Marshall Plan after
World War 11.
Competition for the scholarship is
regional with the Pacific and New En
gland areas the most competitive. In
the Pacific region, 300 people ap
plied. 16 received British council in
terviews and four were named
recipients ol the Marshall Scholar
ship.
