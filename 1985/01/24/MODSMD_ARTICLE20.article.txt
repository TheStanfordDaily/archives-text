## Dillon powerful; rapport redeems' Flamingo Kid' 
### STEVE VINEBERG Daily staff 
The rite-of-passage comedy "The Flamingo Kid," set in
1963, is far from great, but the rapport between Hector
Elizondo as a Brooklyn plumber and Matt Dillon as Jef
frey Willis, the teenage son in quiet rebellion against him,
is so good that the picture expands in your mind after
you've seen it. Jeffrey's friends belong to Jewish nouveaux
riches families who spend their summers at a beach club;
his landing a job there as a parking attendant (quickly
rising to the highly tipped position of cabana boy) disap
points his father, who sees the work as demeaning and
whose ego is bruised when Jeffrey chooses this employ
ment over the office job he himself obtained for the boy.
And at the club, Jeffrey falls under the influence of Phil
Brody (Richard Crenna), a wealthy, ostentatious
cardsharp whose Willy Loman-like values begin to infect
him. Soon he is ready to abandon the idea of college and
go to work selling cars for Brody.
Though Garry and Neil Marshall's script includes a
romance between Jeffrey and Phil's visiting niece (Janet
Jones), the emotional center of the picture is the relation
ship between father and son — the struggle between their
different kinds of pride. And though Garry Marshall, who
also directed, betrays his television origins in his quick
finish reproduction of the period and in the labored
caricaturing of some of the other characters (like Brody's
snobbish wife, played by Jessica Walter), he's smart

enough to handle the scenes between Dillon and Elizondo
with enough delicacy to allow a fairly complex domestic
drama to emerge. Neither of these actors has ever been
better. Elizondo (whose work generally tends to be more
flamboyant and less truthful) shows us a man who has
raised his children to respect the potential of education to
raise their position in life, who has a firm set of values
about honesty and work, and whose sensitivity to his son
does not include an understanding of the seductive appeal
of other men's values. Dillon plays Jeffrey as a boy who
rebels as much against the aggressiveness of his father's
presentation of his values as against the values themselves;
Dillon matches Elizondo's strength with a quiet persis
tence, pulling his head in and lowering his eyes while he
fights back, so that we sense both the depth of his respect
for his father and his difficulty in opposing him.
"The Flamingo Kid" would work better if Phil Brodv
weren't such an obvious phony; we spot him long before
Jeffrey does. (Richard Crenna is miscast in this role,
anyway, though his presence does give Marshall a chance
for a funny in-joke: When Brody flips the channels on his
TV, we catch a few lines from a rerun of "The Real
McCoys," the show that gave Crenna his start.) But Dil
lon overcomes this obstacle — he plays the scene in which
he reveals to Brody that he (finally) sees through him so
beautifully that it redeems all of the Marshalls' mistakes.
Dillon is no longer just a camera "natural" and a powerful
screen presence; he's become a hell of an actor, too.
