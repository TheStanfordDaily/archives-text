# 'Passage to India' not compelling

### STEVE VINEBERG Daily staff 
The opening of David Lean's "A
Passage to India" — credits printed
with unimaginative good taste on a
background of primitive Indian
drawings, while the Royal Philhar
monic plays Maurice Jarre's Broad
way overture music — leads you to
expect one of those deadly "Gandhi"
experiences. It's not, though. At his
best (that is, not in " Doctor Zhivago"
and emphatically not in "Ryan's
Daughter") Lean is an intelligent
director who considers all aspects of a
production with the care of an old
fashioned craftsman, and no one, I
think, except for Noel Annan in his
peremptory attack on the film in last
week's New York Review of Books,
would deny that Lean has read
E.M. Forster's novel carefully and un
derstood it thoroughly. (The only
person connected with the film who
seems to have no idea what the book
was about is Maurice Jarre.)

Lean cast well and structured
the first hour of the picture (which he
also scripted) imj ably: Everything
falls unobtrusively o place. When
Adela Quested (Judy Davis), the
"intended" of the Chief Magistrate in
C'handrapore, Ronny Heaslop (Nigel
Havers), and his mother, Mrs. Moore
(Peggy Ashcroft), have been shown
the local sights on their first day in In
dia, they wind up in his court just in
time to hear him pronounce sentence
on an Indian; Lean gives the scene an
aura of artifice, of display, as if the
pomp and circumstance had been ar
ranged especially to impress the
visitors — as part of their tour. At
the club where the British congregate
to commiserate about the wretched
natives and pretend bravely that
they're still back home, amateurs per
form a scene from a recent musical
comedy with painful meticulousness,
and the ritual playing of "God Save
the King" stops everyone in his
tracks, including the billiard players

in their shirtsleeves, who hold their
cues stiffly at their sides until the an
them has ended. A "bridge" party
(allegedly to bridge the gap between
East and West) in honor of the visit
ing ladies features, as entertainment,
a band made up of Indians in ab
surdly bright costumes playing "Tea
for Two." And the scenes in which
the nervously kind Dr. Aziz (Victor
Banerjee) and his friends discuss the
English contain Forster's combina
tion of distanced astuteness and
humorous muddle.
For those of us who love the book,
Lean's taste, integrity and clever
ness ought to be reason for rejoicing,
especially considering the assaults
less judicious filmmakers have made
recently on other literary works. Yet I
found "A Passage to India" less than
compelling, and (except for a few
spots) 1 was unmoved by it. Perhaps
the problem is that Lean's intelli
gence is too penetrating: He has
everything in the book doped out. He

is so sure that what happens in the
Marabar Caves, which Forster leaves
slyly ambiguous, is a case of a
sexually repressed woman hallucinat
ing that he sets it up several scenes
before with a scene (which he in
vented) in which Adela rides up to a
deserted temple on her bicycle and is
so appalled and terrified by the
openly sexual has relief (of Siva and
Parvati) on the facade, and by the
symbolic wild monkeys squawking at
her, that she runs away. Almost im
mediately afterward, we hear Mrs.
Moore telling Adela that India forces
one to come face to face with oneself,
and we think, "Aha! The wild
monkeys are the dark sexual part of
Adela, which she is afraid to con
front."
Then, moments before she enters
the cave on the expedition Aziz has
organized as a diversion for the
ladies, she asks Aziz (who is alone
with her, Mrs. Moore having
remained below) about his marital
state, and instead of conveying the
sense of a faux pas on Adela's part
that infuriates Aziz (as Forster did).
Lean stages her question as a
tentative sexual advance. By the time
Adela is standing in the cave, looking
out woozily at Aziz's figure in the
pathway, we realize not only that
Aziz is not guilty of Adela's subse
quent charge of attempted rape, but
that no one is.
When Louis Malle made his great
epic exploration "Phantom India" —
the "Let Us Now Praise Famous
Men" of documentary films — in the
early 19705, he prefaced it with a dis
claimer stating that after all the
months he had spent in India, he still
couldn't pretend to understand it, and
that therefore the movie was a
chronicle of his ignorance as well as
his experiences. I think what I missed
in "A Passage to India" — except for
one spectacular shot of an elephant
bathing in a stream — was a sense of
mystery, which is certainly present in
the novel but doesn't marry well with
Lean's big and shiny style of
moviemaking. (The friend who ac
companied me to the film said he felt
he'd seen something from another era
of film production, and though there
are undeniably pleasures to be had
from a good four-square roadshow
picture like "Hawaii" or "Fiddler on
the Roof" that a smaller scale film
can't offer, I'm not sure that an
adaptation of E.M. Forster is the ideal
home for them.)
I missed Forster's egalitarian wit,
too, in the second half; in the picture,
once Aziz is arrested and put on trial,
he and the other Indians cease to be
as much the targets of Forster's
bull's-eye satire as the English pukka

sahibs are. Surely Lean, with his
clear-eyed reading of the novel, un
derstood that the outraged departure
from the court of Aziz's friend and le
gal counsel, Mahmoud Ali (Art
Malik, Hari Kumar in television's
"The Jewel in the Crown"), the fer
vent but utterly irrelevant cry of
"Mrs. Moore!" from the Indian
crowds outside the courtroom, and
Aziz's confusion about which lady his
English friend Fielding (James Fox)
has married are meant to be funny.
Only a few members of the large
cast give any cause for complaint.
James Fox is inordinately stiff, espe
cially in the last hour, and Michael
Culver (as the chief of police,
Mcßryde) too self-conscious — he
seems awfully proud of the Scottish
brogue he worked up for the part.
And although it's highly amusing to
see Alec Guinness done up in turban
and tan make-up as the old Hindu,
Professor Godbole, popping his head

out of a tonga at the railroad crossing
like a cuckoo in a clock (when he and
Fielding arrive a moment too late to
take the train up to Marabar with
Aziz and the two women), there is
something too endearing about his
hamminess here; he's like Gale Son
dergaard or Judith Anderson in drag.
But Judy Davis has exactly the right
magnetic unattractiveness and neu
rotic. sharp-eyed querulousness for
Adela, (and she plays every step of
this character's development with ad
mirable clarity). Nigel Havers is
humorously callow as Ronny, and the
various officiating geese of the Raj
are smartly caricatured. As Aziz. Vic
tor Banerjee gives a charming perfor
mance for three-quarters of the
movie, but in the last scenes he (or
Lean) loses sight of how ridiculous
this man becomes in the wake of his
unexpected triumph in court, and he
handles the transition too forcefully
