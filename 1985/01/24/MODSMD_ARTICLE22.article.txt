I he Stranglers — Aural Sculpture
★ ★
This latest effort by the Euro
rock group that so impressed us in
the past is such a complete disap
pointment that it hasn't even hit us
yet that we had to pay nine bucks
for the thing. Aside from the two
singles that are currently being
overplayed, "No Mercy" and "Skip
Deep," nothing else even comes
close to the quality and inventive
ness of which the group is capable.
The eloquent style and chordal
structures that made earlier
Stranglers' songs special are cither
gone or cliched, and some of the
gaudy gimmicks the group uses to
hold attention are boring; a few are

hokev and irritating; and only the
few worthy songs even suggest that
any effort at all was put into this
recording.
Perhaps this is a contractual obli
gation album to help the group get
away from their label — if so. we
sure wish they could have tipped us
off beforehand. It's a shame that
new listeners attracted to the
strength of the singles will be
turned off by the rest of the album;
earlier releases such as "Feline,"
their previous effort, will prove
much more satisfying to people in
trigued by the group's curious
blend of synth, monotonal vocals
and romantic lyrics. At any rate, as
pretentious a title as "Aural

Sculpture" certainly was unneces
sary. The Stranglers' unique sound
is worthwhile listening when prop
erly executed, but "Aural
Sculpture" is enough of a universal
disaster to almost justify vandalism.

The Nylons— One Size Fits All
★ ★ ★
We hate to admit that we're not
the most adept at reviewing
esoteric musical genres, but we're
also totally dedicated to quality
criticism with seamless style, so we
called in resident expert and Fleet
Streeter Carl Gabrielson (to whom
this review is dedicated). Our resul
tant learning experience revealed
that The Nylons, a quasi-capella
quartet accompanied by Synsonics
drums, are a fairly solid group, al
though definitely not without
weaknesses. Their arrangements
are basically good, though they lack

dynamic contrast and suffer from a
relatively poorly blended bass part.
But the greatest detraction is the
repetitive electronic drumming

that pervades each song. "Even
the Mendicants don't use electronic
percussion," said Gabrielson bit
terly.
But seriously, a capella style is an
appealing addition to one's musical
perspective, and if nothing else.
The Nylons' unique approach is in
teresting and at least temporarily
novel. The cheery, upbeat melodies
and happy-go-lucky (translation:
shallow, stupid, meaningless) lyrics
can be a refreshing change from the
realist attitudes of more conven
tional music, though after a while
many of the arrangements tend to
become overused and predictable,
and the overall style tired.

The Waterboys — A Pagan Place
★ ★
The Waterboys are a new entry
into the Big Country Alarm
Echo/Bunnymen clique; the group
of bands relies on a guitar-oriented,
somewhat rough sound and poetic.

inspiring lyrics. This approach was
initiated by U2, who still make
music head and shoulders above
the rest, and probably always will.
Fans of this anti-tech British style
will probably appreciate The
Waterboys as much as the rest of
the bands: nothing is radically dif
ferent in their style, apart from the
use of more diverse instrumenta
tion to fill out the music. The saxes
and horns remove some of the
tedium that so often plagues this
type of music, leading to a smooth
er, more professional sound. But
nothing really stands out in the
music, and ultimately, nothing dis
tinguishes "A Pagan Place" from
the rest of the ever-expanding li
brary of forgettable modern music

available.
And where instrumental diver
sity is one of the group's assets, its
greatest liability is the coarse, ir
ritating vocals of lead singer Mike
Scott. Scott's voice is not much bet
ter than that of Alarmist Mike
Peters — often strained and out of
tune. Contrary to popular belief,
terrible vocals are not proof of mu
sical integrity or sincerity, only
proof of inexperience and
manufactured identity. The Water
boys definitely hold future promise,
if they can adopt an even more
original style and write better, more
memorable songs.
