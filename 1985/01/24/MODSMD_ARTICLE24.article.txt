# Menlo Players offer good rendition of 'Billy Budd'
## 
### KARY ANTHOLIS 
The tale of misconduct at sea has been a favorite sub
ject of many British and American authors. The hist< ,
importance of maritime supremacy and the romantic ma
chismo of seamanship has played on the imaginations of
the readers of "Mutiny on the Bounty," "Lord Jim" and
"The Caine Mutiny." These tales offer the ship as a
microcosm and the trial as a process by which society at
tempts to understand and deal with the misconduct of in
dividuals. Herman Melville's "Billy Budd" fits into this
genre of literature. Melville's novel has been adapted for
the stage by Louis Coxe and Robert Chapman, and the
Menlo Players Guild is currently presenting a production
of the play.
The story is simple. Billy Budd. an ingenuous, athletic
and "handsome" sailor, is drafted from a merchant ship
onto a British naval frigate during the Napoleonic wars.
Budd's considerable abilities as a sailor, his boyish good
looks and his good-natured character make him a popular
figure among the ship's crew. However, the crew super
visor, Claggert, resent's Billy's apparent perfection and
seeks to destroy him.
In the presence of Billy and the ship's commander.
Captain Vere, Claggert falsely accuses Billy of conspiring
to mutiny. Billy, who stammers when nervous, becomes
frustrated by his inability to vocalize a denial, and vents
his rage by dealing Claggert a fatal blow to the brow. A
court martial ensues in which all of the officers are aware
that Billy was slandered. The officers want to acquit Billy;
however, they also realize that they must perform their
duty to the "King's law."
The tale's simplicity and the vividness of its characters
are its major strengths. Coxe and Chapman successfully

transfer these qualities to the dramatic torrri. It is refresh
ing to see a play that has characters about whom we can
care and whose fates are determined with all important
facts disclosed. Coxe and Chapman are also prudent in
downplaying the allegory which Melville used extensively
in the novel. This makes the dramatization more engag
ing. .. ...
The Menlo Players' production does a tine job in ren
dering the excellent material at its disposal. Under Frank
Dowse"s direction, the production presents Claggert
(Rand Earl) as a sadistic task master who is obsessed with
destroying Billy's beauty. Earl, who is costumed in black
and carries a riding crop, emphasizes ( laggert s
suppressed homosexuality. The result is generally success
ful, though on occasion he overdoes it a bit.
Russel Sanderson is somewhat self-conscious as the
naive Billy Budd. Nevertheless, his performance is ade
quate as it renders Billy's innocent charisma.
Rodney Vaughan's depiction of Captain Vere is quite
good. He seems genuinely sensitive to the moral dilemma
which the captain faces in choosing between duty and
compassion.
Dennis Gibson gives an endearing performance as
O'Daniel, the jolly, sarcastic crew member. His amusing
wisecracks and stories are sprinkled throughout the play
and provide comic relief.
Coxe and Chapman's adaptation holds much potential
for comic and tragic entertainment. The Menlo Players
have taken advantage of this, and the result is a good pro
duction of an excellent play.
"Billy Budd" plays Thurs.-Sat. at 8:30 p.m. at the
Burgess Theatre in the Menlo Park Civic Center.


A scuffle takes place before Billy comes aboard in Menlo Players' "Billy Budd."
