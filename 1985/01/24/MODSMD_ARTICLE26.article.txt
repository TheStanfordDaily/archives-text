# ‘Swann in Love' a non-entertaining folly
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG Daily staff 
Casting Jeremy Irons as Charles Swann in "Swann in
Love" is an act of such astonishing folly that it may have
earned its place in film history, alongside such casting
choices as Gregory Peck as Captain Ahab in John Hus
ton's 1956 "Moby Dick" and Julie Andrews as stage star
Gertrude Lawrence in the 1968 "Star!" Reading Proust's
description of Swann's passion for Odette, one thinks ot
the late Gerard Philippe, perhaps, or the young Oskar
Werner of "Jules and Jim" — but Jeremy Irons? He
belongs to the chilled Harold Pinter school of English act
ing; every word he speaks, every step he takes comments
on the high polish of his acting skills. He can be amusing
(as he was in the Victorian sections of "The French
Lieutenant's Woman"); he's certainly intelligent. But not
a moment of Swann's fervor and agony — his foolish and
touching (and funny) surrender to every lover's whim
even as it contradicts his own revelations about Odette —
is persuasively conveyed in his performance. As Odette,
Ornella Muti gives Swann enough provocation for flying
to amorous extremes — she has the right tantalizing
whorishness for the part (though she is not an accom
plished actress). Extremes are simply out of Jeremy Irons'
range.
Actually, Volker Schlondorffs entire film, which in
cludes contributions from Peter Brook and Jean-Claude
Carriere among others, is a folly — though not a very en

tertaining one. Schlondorff solves the problem ot translat
ing the extraordinarily intricate interplay of emotional
textures in Proust's prose to the screen by homogenizing
them; though in Proust the rhythm may shift subtly from
one sentence to the next, the film has no discernible
rhythm at all. (Perhaps that explains the reaction of sonn
viewers who say "Swann in Love teels like a-softcore
porno film. It's rarely erotic, but it seems to have no othe>
purpose either, and it drips sleepily from sequence to se
quence.) As Baron Charlus. the still dashing Alain Delon
brings his own rhythm into his scenes, and he's ver\
amusing — especially when, striding up a staircase with
Swann just behind him. he surveys from top to toe even
young footman in attendance. But he s not around often
enough, and in any case the screenplay tails to integrate
him successfully.
Schlondorff banalizes Proust's theory of memory into
an unceremonious series of flashbacks, and his magic en
dowment of objects with evocative power becomes a
blank fixation on decor. In one scene, Swann removes
evening clothes from an impressive lacquered cabinet in
his bedroom, and the camera lingers on it after he s leli
the room and we see his butler close it slowly. Since the
movie offers no explanation ol this preoccupation with
furniture (none of it is linked in any significant way with
Swann himself), its only effect is to add weight. Swann in
Love" is a lumbering white elephant ot a picture.
