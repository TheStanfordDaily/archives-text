# Elevator problems spur angry threats
## 
### LYNN MARCUS Staff writer 
A rock-thrown threat protesting elevator ser
vice at Ouiilen House in Escondido Village has
sparked an investigation by the Stanford Police.
A worker at the maintenance office in Escon
dido Village discovered a large rock inside the of
fice Tuesday at approximately 7 a.m. with a type
written note attached that read, "Fix the elevator
in Quillen or the next one will ignite," according
to Ed Scoles, University director of housing and
food services.
Ouiilen is a 12-story building for graduate stu
dents and their spouses that houses 110 married
couples.
Scoles said one of the two Ouiilen elevators
has had intermittent electrical problems for six to
eight weeks and has been repaired several times.
He said the problem kept recurring because
maintenance contractors have had difficulty pin
pointing the source.

The written threat was preceded by a verbal
one to the same office on Friday afternoon, when
an unidentified male caller told maintenance sec
retary Terry Horning to "get the elevator fixed or
maintenance is going to suffer."' Scoles said.
The broken window through which the rock
was thrown was noticed Monday by a worker
outside the building, which was closed for a Uni
versity holiday.
Scoles said the elevator was fixed again Mon
day.
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Herrington said
he had heard mention of someone or "some
people verbally abusing the elevator repair
people," but that there were no other leads in the
case.
"It's probably not likely that we'll find out un
less somebody comes forward." Herrington said.
Scoles said he is sending a notice to each Quil
len apartment notifying residents of the incident.
