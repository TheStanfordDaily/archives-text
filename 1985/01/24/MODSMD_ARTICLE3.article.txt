# Journalist decries TV threat

### TIM GRIEVE Daily staff 
Flashing television images ignite "instant mass
emotions, mass opinions and then mass pressures,"
forcing policy-makers to act quickly and danger
ously and threatening the future of civilization, a
former editor of one of the nation's largest
newspapers said here last night.
Michael O'Neill, the editor of the New York
Daily News from 1975 to 1982, told about 100
people in Jordan Hall last night that a new sort of
journalism, one that would prevent disaster instead
of only reacting to it. is needed to preserve the
democratic process in the United States.
O'Neill said that "highly emotionalized TV ex
periences" have "dramatically increased the
public's involvement in the daily affairs of the
country," robbing policy-makers of the time and
freedom to make rational decisions.
"In the case of television, movement, sound and
color rush actual experiences directly to the senses,
producing instant emotional reactions, as we saw
after the bombing of the Marine barracks in
Beirut," O'Neill explained. "There is no need for
verbal translation or rational interpretation. I he
process moves from image to impression to emo
tional impulse and then to action. Sensation and
emotion dominate, and reasoning, which verbal
communication demands, is by-passed."
Another related danger is that the public begins
to believe it knows more than it does about world
events, giving it a dangerous false sense of confi
dence.
"Because they see the world every night on the
nightly news, they feel they are up-to-the-minute
on what's going on in the world," O'Neill said.
"They are beguiled into believing they are wiser
than they are. They unconsciously substitute their

own TV impressions for other more studied views.
"In foreign affairs, for instance, intellectual
equipment and specialized knowledge are given
less importance when elected officials and the
voters quickly form their own opinions from TV
newscasts. . . . The mystery of foreign affairs is dis
sipated. Advice is ignored and ambassadors are by-

passed, as in the case of Iran. Personal diplomacy
becomes the statesmen's sport and the role of the
State Department is reduced."
O'Neill said the amazing amount of information
and emotion television presents to the public also
offers the national media a power they never had
before.

"The networks and national press now set the
agendas in Washington, deciding what the focus of
government should be, reporting and magnifying
controversy, agonizing and nagging for instant so
lutions, and creating public pressures that become
almost irresistible," O'Neill said.
At times, O'Neill said, television has a
"disruptive effect, amassing emotions and generat
ing demands for action that frequently run ahead of
a government's ability to respond."
When public opinion, driven ever more quickly
by the spurs of television pictures, races ahead of
the government's ability to act, "there is a danger
that we are failing the ultimate test of civilization,"
O'Neill said, "because our culture and our institu
tions are adapting too slowly to the momentous
changes now reshaping society.
"We may also be failing because television has
badly corroded the deliberative process, consensus
politics and the other conditions necessary to effec
tive democratic government."
O'Neill said education holds the greatest hope
for regaining the wisdom we have lost in the age of
instant communication. It is the only way, he said,
to "combat TV-dinner values" and restore reason
and reflection to their former positions of impor
tance.
There is reason to believe that change is possible.
O'Neill said, citing the Los Angeles Times and The
New York Times as two newspapers that have done
"some really terrific work along the lines" of what
he calls "preventive journalism."
He said, however, that this sort of journalism
must overcome a number of obstacles — especially
the time and expense it requires — before it can
become more widespread. "If we can at least talk

about it, and we make some moves in
this direction, then we can do some of
this" preventive reporting even while
the rat-a-tat approach of the current
style predominates.
O'Neill's speech. "Lost Wisdom:
Pou'pr nnrl the Dancers of

Mass Information." was the 1985 an
nual Carlos McClatchy Memorial
Lecture.
Before joining the Daily News as a
Washington correspondent in 1956,
O'Neill worked as a foreign corre
spondent and Washington overnight
editor for United Press International.
He is a former president of the Amer
ican Society of Newspaper Editors.
