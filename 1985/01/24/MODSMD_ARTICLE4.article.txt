# No decision yet
## Fate of co-ops remains uncertain 
### TODD RAMMING Staff writer 
A University committee yesterday postponed
a decision on the future of co-ops and shelved
plans to terminate the French House program
here.
The Committee on Services to Students-
Residences (COSS-R) was scheduled to release
its decision on whether to close one or more of
the co-ops, but delayed its official recommenda
tion until Feb. 22, according to COSS-R mem
ber Tim Hesterberg.
"We decided to keep the French House pro
gram. The house has improved greatly in the
last couple of years, and I expect that to show
up in the Draw results this spring." Hesterburg
told The Daily last night.
Hesterberg attributed the two-week
postponement of the decision to a recent influx
of new information.
Most significant is a survey of students on
campus submitted by the co-op council, an un
official group of representatives from the six
University co-ops, to COSS-R only hours
before yesterday's meeting. COSS-R also
recently obtained a detailed report on the Draw
and enrollment in co-op houses from the Office
of Residential Education.
Terra resident Eileen McManus said she is
surprised that COSS-R postponed its decision
on co-ops. She said co-op members believed
they "were working against a big wall."
'"I felt a decision had already been made,"
she said. "I don't know if ultimately we changed
the decision, but we had an impact," McManus
said.
Hesterburg said he "prefers to see co-ops.

They teach people to become more self
sufficient."
Nevertheless, co-ops have consistently failed
to fill in the regular Draw, Hesterberg said.
Even if there remains some doubt as to the abil
ity of co-ops to fill, "I personally would give
them the benefit of the doubt," he said.
However, COSS-R must "make the
availability of spaces (for co-ops) more closely
match the demand," he said. "The co-ops Theta
Chi, Phi Psi, and Hammarskjold are in no dan
ger (of being disbanded)."
The survey submitted by the co-op council
reveals a general ignorance about co-ops here,
Hesterburg said. In that survey, students un
familiar with co-ops said they believed living in
cooperative rather than University housing
would save $200 a quarter. The real savings is
$600.
The council report contained six pages of sug
gestions for publicizing the co-ops and drawing
more students into them.
With a two-week grace period before COSS-
R convenes again to try to reach a final decision,
co-op officials say they are continuing to
prepare recommendations aimed at improving
co-op performance in the Draw.
Synergy resident Jose Giner mentioned the
possibility of "all-campus parties, invitations to
dorms for lunch at the co-ops and a bread
mobile to distribute bread to students [to] give
them a taste of co-op living."
The co-op council will meet as soon as possi
ble to make final plans for the two weeks before
the next COSS-R meeting, McManus said.
