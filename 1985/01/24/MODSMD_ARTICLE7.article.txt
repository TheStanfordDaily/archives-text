Reagan to promote Kirkpatrick
WASHINGTON — President Reagan plans to offer U.N. Ambassa
dor Jeane Kirkpatrick the post of administrator of the Agency for Inter
national Development and will emphasize his personal desire to keep
her as a policy adviser, well-placed administration sources said yester
day.
While these sources were optimistic that Kirkpatrick would accept the
offer, sources close to the U.N. ambassador said it was unlikely that she
would. They acknowledged, however, that Kirkpatrick is under heavy
pressure from conservatives in and outside the administration to accept
any post Reagan might offer that would keep her close to the foreign
policy decision-making process.
Reagan said yesterday in an interview with Helen Thomas of United
Press International that he intends to offer Kirkpatrick a high-level
foreign policy position, but he would not specify one.
"It is a department of the executive branch that I'm not free to talk
about yet that I think she would be very good at," the president said.
Administration officials said Reagan will meet with Kirkpatrick at the
White House next Wednesday to discuss her future. They last met on
Dec. 10 and later announced that they would get together again after the
president's inauguration.
Asked about the report that Reagan will offer her the AID post,
Kirkpatrick said yesterday through a spokesman: "As I said after my
Dec. 10 meeting with the president, I will have no further comment
about my future until we meet again."
U.S. urged to cut Filipino aid
WASHING TON — Philippine opposition leader Aquilino Pimentel
Jr. urged the Reagan administration yesterday to reduce its political and
economic support for President Ferdinand Marcos' government, and
thus give the opposition a chance to win power once Marcos is removed
from the scene by death or health-related resignation.
"We would like the United States to lay off the Philippines," said
Pimentel, a one-time vice presidential running mate of assassinated op
position leader Benigno Aquino, Jr. "We in the opposition are not asking
Uncle Sam to fight the dictatorship — but when he is backing the dic
tatorship. the task becomes doubly difficult."
He called for reduced U.S. military aid to the Marcos government and
suggested that U.S. economic aid be channeled through private organi
zations instead of government agencies.
Pimentel, one of 1 1 candidates an opposition coordinating committee
is considering supporting for president, said he had appointments to
meet State Department and National Security Council officials during
the Washington segment of a two-month speaking tour of the United
States. However, his comments during a breakfast meeting with
reporters left little doubt that he will have a difficult time selling his pro
gram to the administration.
Soviet high-tech list discovered
BONN, West Germany — The Soviet Union has compiled a secret
27-chapter "shopping list" identifying high-technology equipment that
its spies in the West are instructed to acquire. Interior Ministry sources
say.
The book, as thick as a city telephone directory, is part of the Krem
lin's campaign "to catch up with Western technology" through
espionage, according to a ministry report compiled for internal use.
"It's called the Red Book' and it's the wish list — or shopping list —
for Soviet secret service officers abroad." the four-page report said. A
copy of the report was made available to The Associated Press.
The report said Soviet agents abroad are expected to obtain four items
from the book a year, and added that those who acquire high-technology
equipment would earn prestige.
Items in the book range from sophisticated equipment used in guiding
long-range missiles to technology that could help military vehicles start
in cold weather.
A ministry source who spoke on condition of anonymity said the So
viet book "has come to the attention of our secret services," but did not
elaborate.
The ministry report said copies of the "Red Book" have been issued
to a limited number of Soviet embassies and trade delegations in the
West.
Shuttle ready for launch today
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — As ice that delayed the launch
ol the space shuttle Discovery by 24 hours melted away yesterday, all
systems tied to the craft and its launching gear were said by National
Aeronautics and Space Administration officials to be ready for the
postponed liftoff today.
I he overnight low temperatures last night were not expected to
hamper — as they did Tuesday night — the launch system's firefighting
equipment or to pose a threat to the orbiter's heat-shielding tiles that
protect it from the searing temperatures generated by its entry into the
atmosphere as it returns to earth.
By the three-hour launch period today (1:15 p.m. to 4:15 EST), the
deep freeze is expected to be a thing of the past and temperatures could
reach the low 60s.
Charles Redmond, a space agency spokesman, said that technicians
yesterday repaired valves, pipes and nozzles broken or damaged by ice
in the tirelighting system on launch pad 39A. He said no damage was
discovered to the shuttle itself as a result of the subfreezing temperature
Tuesday night.
I he crew — Navy Cmdr. Thomas Mattingly, Air Force Lt. Col. Loren
Shriver, Air Force Maj. Ellison Onizuka, Marine Corps Lt. Col. James
Buehli. and Air Force Maj. Gary Payton — had a relaxed schedule,
space agency officials said.
Air Force Lt. Col. John Booth said that the Pentagon was limiting to a
nine-minute warning its advance announcement that the actual liftoff is
imminent to avoid giving the Soviet Union "adequate time to track" or
take steps against the release of the spaceship's super-sensitive cargo.
I his is to be the first flight of the shuttle devoted exclusively to a military
mission.
Health risks to workers cited
\\ ASHING I ON — I he Public Citizen Health Research Group yes
terday disclosed the names of 249 work places in 42 states where the
government has identified — but never notified — some 250,000
workers who face an increased risk of cancer, heart disease and other
illnesses because of their working conditions.
Federal health officials have been debating whether the government is
obligated to notify workers who may be in danger of contracting diseases
from substances in work places studied by the National Institute for Oc
cupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) over the past 15 years. The con
sumer group obtained the data through a Freedom of Information Act
request.
"We have more than 200.000 workers at severely increased risk, and
the government does not want to notify them," said Dr. Sidney Wolfe,
director of the group, which was founded by Ralph Nader. "And so the
chemical companies win out over the people they employ. . . . The gov
ernment is nodding to the industry and ignoring the public."
The Health and Human Services Department rejected a $4 million
budget request from NIOSH to begin a "worker notification" program
in the current fiscal year, citing the substantial cost, the confusion in
some industries about whether the medical evidence justifies a govern
ment warning and the fear that notification will unduly alarm communi
ties.
Stock market posts strong gain
NEW YORK — The stock market rang up another strong gain yester
day. maintaining the momentum of its recent rally.
Analysts said the economic statistics continued to paint a positive
picture of growth in business activity with continuing low inflation rates.

Aeronautics and Space Administration officials to be ready for the
postponed liftoff today.
I he overnight low temperatures last night were not expected to
hamper — as they did Tuesday night — the launch system's firefighting
equipment or to pose a threat to the orbiter's heat-shielding tiles that
protect it from the searing temperatures generated by its entry into the
atmosphere as it returns to earth.
By the three-hour launch period today (1:15 p.m. to 4:15 EST), the
deep freeze is expected to be a thing of the past and temperatures could
reach the low 60s.
Charles Redmond, a space agency spokesman, said that technicians
yesterday repaired valves, pipes and nozzles broken or damaged by ice
in the tirelighting system on launch pad 39A. He said no damage was
discovered to the shuttle itself as a result of the subfreezing temperature
Tuesday night.
I he crew — Navy Cmdr. Thomas Mattingly, Air Force Lt. Col. Loren

Buehli. and Air Force Maj. Gary Payton — had a relaxed schedule,
space agency officials said.
Air Force Lt. Col. John Booth said that the Pentagon was limiting to a
nine-minute warning its advance announcement that the actual liftoff is
imminent to avoid giving the Soviet Union "adequate time to track" or
take steps against the release of the spaceship's super-sensitive cargo.

Health risks to workers cited
\\ ASHING I ON — I he Public Citizen Health Research Group yes
terday disclosed the names of 249 work places in 42 states where the
government has identified — but never notified — some 250,000
workers who face an increased risk of cancer, heart disease and other
illnesses because of their working conditions.
Federal health officials have been debating whether the government is
obligated to notify workers who may be in danger of contracting diseases
from substances in work places studied by the National Institute for Oc
cupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) over the past 15 years. The con
sumer group obtained the data through a Freedom of Information Act
request.
"We have more than 200.000 workers at severely increased risk, and
the government does not want to notify them," said Dr. Sidney Wolfe,
director of the group, which was founded by Ralph Nader. "And so the
chemical companies win out over the people they employ. . . . The gov
ernment is nodding to the industry and ignoring the public."
The Health and Human Services Department rejected a $4 million
budget request from NIOSH to begin a "worker notification" program
in the current fiscal year, citing the substantial cost, the confusion in
some industries about whether the medical evidence justifies a govern
ment warning and the fear that notification will unduly alarm communi
ties.

Reagan to promote Kirkpatrick
WASHINGTON — President Reagan plans to offer U.N. Ambassa
dor Jeane Kirkpatrick the post of administrator of the Agency for Inter
national Development and will emphasize his personal desire to keep
her as a policy adviser, well-placed administration sources said yester
day.
While these sources were optimistic that Kirkpatrick would accept the
offer, sources close to the U.N. ambassador said it was unlikely that she
would. They acknowledged, however, that Kirkpatrick is under heavy
pressure from conservatives in and outside the administration to accept
any post Reagan might offer that would keep her close to the foreign
policy decision-making process.
Reagan said yesterday in an interview with Helen Thomas of United
Press International that he intends to offer Kirkpatrick a high-level
foreign policy position, but he would not specify one.
"It is a department of the executive branch that I'm not free to talk
about yet that I think she would be very good at," the president said.
Administration officials said Reagan will meet with Kirkpatrick at the
White House next Wednesday to discuss her future. They last met on
Dec. 10 and later announced that they would get together again after the
president's inauguration.
Asked about the report that Reagan will offer her the AID post,
Kirkpatrick said yesterday through a spokesman: "As I said after my
Dec. 10 meeting with the president, I will have no further comment
about my future until we meet again."
U.S. urged to cut Filipino aid
WASHING TON — Philippine opposition leader Aquilino Pimentel
Jr. urged the Reagan administration yesterday to reduce its political and
economic support for President Ferdinand Marcos' government, and
thus give the opposition a chance to win power once Marcos is removed
from the scene by death or health-related resignation.
"We would like the United States to lay off the Philippines," said
Pimentel, a one-time vice presidential running mate of assassinated op
position leader Benigno Aquino, Jr. "We in the opposition are not asking
Uncle Sam to fight the dictatorship — but when he is backing the dic
tatorship. the task becomes doubly difficult."
He called for reduced U.S. military aid to the Marcos government and
suggested that U.S. economic aid be channeled through private organi
zations instead of government agencies.
Pimentel, one of 1 1 candidates an opposition coordinating committee
is considering supporting for president, said he had appointments to
meet State Department and National Security Council officials during
the Washington segment of a two-month speaking tour of the United
States. However, his comments during a breakfast meeting with
reporters left little doubt that he will have a difficult time selling his pro
gram to the administration.
Soviet high-tech list discovered
BONN, West Germany — The Soviet Union has compiled a secret
27-chapter "shopping list" identifying high-technology equipment that
its spies in the West are instructed to acquire. Interior Ministry sources
say.
The book, as thick as a city telephone directory, is part of the Krem
lin's campaign "to catch up with Western technology" through
espionage, according to a ministry report compiled for internal use.
"It's called the Red Book' and it's the wish list — or shopping list —
for Soviet secret service officers abroad." the four-page report said. A
copy of the report was made available to The Associated Press.
The report said Soviet agents abroad are expected to obtain four items
from the book a year, and added that those who acquire high-technology
equipment would earn prestige.
Items in the book range from sophisticated equipment used in guiding
long-range missiles to technology that could help military vehicles start
in cold weather.
A ministry source who spoke on condition of anonymity said the So
viet book "has come to the attention of our secret services," but did not
elaborate.
The ministry report said copies of the "Red Book" have been issued
to a limited number of Soviet embassies and trade delegations in the
West.
