# Baker gets committee's approval

### 
WASHINGTON — The Senate
Finance Committee yesterday unani
mously approved the nomination of
White House Chief of Staff James
Baker 111 to he secretary of the Trea
sury, clearing the way for Baker's
confirmation by the full Senate ne\t
week.
In the two-and-one-half-hour con
firmation hearing. Baker told the
panel that President Reagan wants
his tax simplification proposal to he
acted on this year. But he said the
Department of the Treasury report
prepared last year under Secretar\
Donald Regan, who is swapping jobs
with Baker, was "simply a starting
point" for an administration tax plan
that would not be completed for
several months.
Baker did not back away from an\
specific feature of the Treasury's tax
proposal, which calls for lower tax
rates along with the elimination of

dozens of personal and business tax
deduetions — but he cautioned that
he would not hesitate to make
changes in the plan in order to avoid
any "detrimental effect on savings,
investment and capital formation."
Baker, the only witness, encoun
tered overwhelmingly friendly ques
tioning from the 17 senators who at
tended the hearing. But nearly all of
them criticized different aspects of
the Treasury tax proposal they
claimed would harm certain indus
tries, states and charitable organiza
tions.
Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.),
chairman of the Finance Committee,
told reporters after the hearing that
the White House was having "some
second thoughts about some provi
sions" of the Treasury proposal.
Packwood, whose committee has
jurisdiction over all tax legislation in
the Senate, reiterated his objections

to the Treasury's suggestion that
fringe benefits, such as employee
paid health insurance, should be
taxed if they exceed certain amounts.
In response to questions. Baker
said Reagan would give "equal
priority" on "separate tracks" to the
tax revision proposal and to spending
cuts aimed at reducing next year's
deficit by about $50 billion.
"It will not be unlike 1981. when
we had a major budget initiative and
a major tax initiative," he said.
He added that Reagan would insist
that tax revision not be used to mask
a tax increase and would object to
any effort to include tax proposals as
part of the deficit reduction package.
Sen. Majority Leader Robert Dole
(R-Kan.) said he would not rush
Baker's confirmation through the
Senate this week because some
senators wanted time to read the
transcript before voting on the move.

The other half of the administra
tion job switch, Regan's appointment
as White House chief of staff, does
not require approval by the Senate,
but it is being delayed pending action
on Baker's nomination.
Baker, 54, joined the White House
in 19K1. at the beginning of Reagan's
first term, after running the political
campaigns ol two ol Reagan's Re
publican rivals — Gerald Ford in
]97(i and George Bush in 1980. He
was instrumental in maneuvering
Reagan's program through Congress,
but lie aroused the ire of some right
wing conservatives for his pragmatic
influence on White House policies.
A wealthy lawyer from Houston,
Baker became a Republican in 1970
to help Bush, currently vice presi
dent. in his unsuccessful bid to win a
Senate seat in Texas.
