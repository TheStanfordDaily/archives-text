# Lugar says contra aid to dry up

### 
WASHINGTON â€” Sen. Richard Lugar (R-
Ind.), new chairman of the Foreign Relations Com
mittee, said yesterday that Congress likely will
deny further aid to the anti-government "contra"
guerrillas in Nicaragua.
Lugar, who has supported the aid. said the pro
gram no longer is "viable."
Lugar's assessment is the latest of a series of sig
nals to the Reagan administration from Republican
and Democratic lawmakers that an expected re
quest for new aid faces difficult if not insur
mountable obstacles in the 99th Congress.
But Lugar's warning was especially significant in
light of his previous support for the aid and his gen
eral record as an administration loyalist.
Speaking of the once-covert program that has
become one of the most highly publicized foreign
policy issues in Congress, Lugar told the National
Press Club: "Aid to the contras is not viable be
cause it is no longer covert and because Congress
will probably not continue to fund it."
An earlier Senate Republican blow to the pro
gram came late last year when Sen. David
Durenberger (R-Minn.), new chairman of the Sen
ate Select Committee on Intelligence, came out
against further funding of covert activities, al
though he left the door open to overt aid.
Lugar went further yesterday in indicating oppo-

sition to overt assistance. "That would be very
close to declaring war, and there's no consensus in
the (American) public for that," said Lugar.
Instead of such aid. Lugar said, the United States
should find new ways to keep pressure on the leftist
Nicaraguan government to make peace with El Sal
vador and other neighbors and to resist the es
tablishment of Soviet bases within its borders.
In an interview with The Associated Press yes
terday, President Reagan said there would be
"great difficulties" in openly aiding the contras
"because in the world of international law you find
that you changed the situation completely, and you
then find yourself having to weigh what are then
considered acts of war."
Although the Republican-controlled Senate gen
erally has supported financial aid for the rebels, it
joined the Democratic House late last year in
voting to suspend aid until another vote is taken
after Feb. 28.
The administration repeatedly has indicated that
it will ask that the ban be lifted. The Central Intelli
gence Agency then could use $14 million to aid the
contras during the fiscal year ending Sept. 30.
On other issues, Lugar said the Reagan adminis
tration should find ways to pressure the white
South African government to share power with the
country's majority black population.

While declining to say whether he would support
sanctions against South Africa that Sen. Edward
Kennedy (D-Mass.) and others are expected to
push, Lugar said the issue will he debated seriously
in the Senate.
In a blunt warning to South Africa's minority
white government, Lugar said its officials will be
making an "awesome mistake if they do not reform
and do not reform quickly.
"It is apparent they are headed for a bloody civil
war which would be a disaster for the Western
world," he added.
But Lugar said he had misgivings about sanctions
because it is not clear whether they would lead to
improved conditions for blacks or deeper troubles
for them.
While parting company with the administration
on policy toward Nicaragua, Lugar came out
strongly for the administration's "Star Wars" space
defense program and for a continued military
buildup while arms-control negotiations proceed.
He said the space-weapons initiative was respon
sible for bringing the Soviets to the bargaining
table, and added, "We should be prepared for the
fact that this research effort is here to stay and that
its consequences will be great."
