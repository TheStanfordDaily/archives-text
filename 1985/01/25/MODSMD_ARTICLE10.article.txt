## Local arms control key, activist says 
### KEN STEVENS 
The most effective solution to the threat posed
by nuclear buildup lies in increased awareness and
activity at the local level, said Michael Shuman, an
arms-control activist and an advocate of innovative
solutions to the problems of war.
"Local governments have special experience in
non-violent conflict resolution," Shuman told an
audience of approximately 75 people yesterday at
the Bechtel International Center. He noted that
frequently national governments are more inclined
to use force rather than mediation.
Shuman, a 1982 graduate of the Stanford Law
School and co-founder of Stanford's Arms Control
and Disarmament Forum, said recent efforts to
resolve the nuclear arms dilemma have met with
little success because national leaders are elected to
protect national sovereignty and therefore refuse to
reduce their country's defense system. He also
added that attempts by non-governmental agencies

to pressure the superpowers to disarm have been
ineffective because these agencies lack both money
and legitimacy.
The only alternative, Shuman said, is the local
government, which he believes can combine the in
dependence of a non-federal governmental body
with the necessary authority and financial status.
Shuman said these local governments, or
"municipal state departments," would be more ac
cessible to people interested in arms control than
the federal government. "Very few people feel they
are a part of foreign policy now," he said. "The
most disempowering factor in foreign policy is the
belief that we (citizens) have no voice in foreign
policy. We just hope that the president does a good
job."
With the addition of more people working in
local communities around the world to urge nuclear
disarmament, the municipal state departments
would gain more lobbying power, according to
Shuman. These worldwide municipal groups could

eventually ally and form international loyalties, he
said.
••We must begin to think of ourselves as world
citizens first and then national citizens," he said.
Shuman said that a global union of municipal
state departments might eventually be as powerful
as the United Nations; furthermore, it would be
more effective because its efforts would not be
hampered by the federal bureaucracy that now sur
rounds the United Nations.
Shuman is currently working with 250 mayors
and city council members in the United .States in an
attempt to establish these municipal state depart
ments. Among his goals is to establish nuclear-free
zones in these areas.
If for no other reason, local governments should
be eager to reduce nuclear arms for purely eco
nomic reasons, he said. Shuman cited unemploy
ment and inflation as the chief victims of military
spending.
