# Middle East expert calls for improved Soviet scholarship

### SCOTT DUBIN 
American scholarship on the
Soviet Union has reached a state
of shambles and must be changed
before relations between the two
countries can be improved, a
former Soviet diplomat asserted
last night in a speech at the World
Affairs Council in San Francisco.
Vladimir Sakharov, an expert
on Middle Eastern Affairs, said
that American experts on the So
viet Union view their subject
through linguistic and ideological
filters and that many view the So
viet "as an evil empire because
that's where the money is."
Sakharov, who received a doc
torate in international relations
from the University of Southern
California and has spent the last two
years at the Hoover Institution,
said current events between the
two superpowers demand a new
American approach both in schol
arship and foreign policy.
"Americans have a great fixa
tion to patch things up fast," he
remarked.

The Soviets, said Sakharov,
"view the world as a continuous
crisis: Some .problems will be
solved and some problems will
never be solved.
"We cannot destroy the Soviet
Union and they cannot destroy
us," said Sakharov.
Although there are no quick
fixes, Sakharov suggested that
Americans could influence the So
viet Union simply by increased
contact with the Soviet people.
He noted that quite a few Soviet
youths of the post-World War II
era were spoiled by exposure to
Western goods during detente and
long for a return to those times.
In the same vein, Sakharov
remarked that boycotting the
1980 Olympics in Moscow was a
big mistake of the Carter adminis
tration. "The Russians would have
seen Americans as flamboyant,
marvelous people," Sakharov
said. And any such contacts are
"good for Soviet-American rela
tions."
