### 
The Mac Arthur Foundation's new
three-year $25 million program in in
ternational security will transform
this field of scholarship from the con
cern of a few academic centers to an
international discipline, Stanford
scholars predicted today.
Stanford, the University of Califor
nia at Berkeley, Harvard University,
Columbia University and the Massa
chusetts Institute of Technology each
will receive $750,000.
More than 20 other institutions
also will benefit, including:
• $6.2 million for pre- and postdoc
toral research fellowships adminis
tered by the Social Science Research
Council;
• $1.5 million for the Brookings In
stitution to stimulate an expanding
network of scholarly research; and
• $250,000 for each of three years
among approximately 10 institutions
in Canada, Latin America, Europe
and Asia.
Political Science Prof. John Lewis,
co-director of the Center for Interna
tional Security and Arms Control,
said that only an international effort
"can create the synergism that will
lead to new research, new ideas and a
job market to sustain young people.
"We're delighted the foundation is

giving money to more than just a few
centers and has committed its re
sources for a long-term effort," he
added.
Three years ago, Lewis estimated
the combined budgets of five leading
university centers in this field at less
than $1 million annually. The Ford
Foundation provided support to
Stanford and several others. The Car
negie Corporation, under the leader
ship of former Stanford Psychiatry
Prof. David Hamburg, has been in
strumental in focusing foundation
leaders' attention on international se
curity studies.
Prof. Sidney Drell, co-director of
the Stanford center, said the Mac A
rthur program was of "immeasurable
importance" in strengthening re
search, training and outreach pro
grams. "This provides a really solid
base of support in a field whose im
portance is second to none."
Coit Blacker, associate director of
the center, praised the Mac Arthur
Foundation for "a very ambitious
strategy" which will "revitalize the
field."
Through the grant, Stanford will
provide $100,000 annually in
graduate student fellowships and
$150,000 annually in research.
