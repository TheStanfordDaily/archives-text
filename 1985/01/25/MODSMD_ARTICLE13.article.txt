# Focus on investment relations
## Mexico conference 
### BRYAN WALSER Staff writer 
In an effort to address the growing
interdependence between the United
States and Mexico, the Food Re
search Institute and the Mexican gov
ernment are hosting a conference on
investment relations between the two
countries.
Conference speakers, including
Mexican Finance Minister Jesus
Silva-Herzog and University of Texas
at Austin Prof. Walt Rostow, will
deliver lectures at Fairchild
Auditorium and the CERAS Build
ing through tomorrow.
Silva-Herzog will give a special
presentation today.
In one of the opening speeches yes
terday, Rostow, who was chairman of
the State Department policy-planning
council during the Kennedy and
Johnson administrations, suggested
that the industrial-academic com
munities of developed and develop
ing nations should work together.
Such cooperation, Rostow said, could

bring international prosperity in the
way that similar industrial-academic
ties turned Silicon Valley. Cambridge
and Austin into high-tech boom
towns.
Said Clark Reynolds, coordinator
of the conference, "The question is
how we can conceptually approach
the idea of interdependence, where
things can no longer be approached in
terms of domestic or international
(affairs), but where scientific, cultural
and economic issues work across both
sides of the border."
The Project on United States-
Mexico Relations is staging the con
ference in conjunction with the Uni
versity's Latin American Studies Pro
gram, the Center for Economic Policy
Research and the Law School.
The Project was organized in 1979
because, said Reynolds, it has
become apparent that neither nation
clearly understands the other and that
relations between the two countries
are going to become more impor
tant.
