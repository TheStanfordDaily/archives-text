## The 						Stanford Daily One question at a time 
### 
In 1983, 84 members of the faculty and 1,500
students signed a petition questioning the Uni
versity's ties with the allegedly partisan Hoover
Institution. One year later, 101 faculty members
asked that an independent visiting committee be
formed to investigate the relationship. The
response they have received is unacceptable.
The most recent development is a report from
a committee — appointed by University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy and chaired by Political
Science Prof. Robert Ward — criticizing the Poli
tical Science Department and calling for in
creased relations between that department and
Hoover. Political Science Prof. John Manley, a
leader of the petition drive, best questioned the
committee's analysis: "The problem with all of
this is that it presupposes all of the questions
about Hoover's alleged political activities."
Indeed, the committee assumed from the outset
that the University needs to strengthen the rela
tionship between its departments and Hoover.
Working from that questionable assumption,
the Ward committee then blasted members of the
Political Science Department for, in effect, trying
to maintain their sovereignty from what some

regard as an illegitimate, partisan resarch institu
tion.
Judging by the composition of the Ward com
mittee, it is not surprising that it both
presupposed the value of Hoover and came to
critical conclusions. Four of the six committee
members have Hoover positions. Two are full
time Hoover senior fellows.
The appointment of the Ward committee fol
lows the establishment of a committee of four
board of trustees members including Kenned)
and Board President William Kimball. This com
mittee was formed, in large part, because of
public pressure. But more than a year and one
half after its creation, the committee has yet to
make a public statement.
We do not question the validity of joint ap
pointments between Hoover and Stanford, but
we are still waiting for a report addressing the
propriety of the current relationship between
Hoover and Stanford. If an independent, distin
guished committee is not developed, as many
here wish, we can at least hope that the board of
trustees group will address the proper issue with
out the presuppositions and counterproductive
attacks made by a stacked Ward committee.
