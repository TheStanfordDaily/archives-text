## Sanctuary: necessary price for failed policy 
### 
Anyone who has studied history knows that
one of the principal reasons for learning about
the past is to avoid repeating its mistakes.
David Wyman, a professor of history at the
University of Massachusetts at Amherst, has
recently written a book ("The Abandonment
of the Jews") that documents the appalling in-

VIEWPOINT

difference with which the governments and
peoples of the West — particularly the United
States — regarded the plight of hundreds of
thousands of Jews trying to escape the Nazi
death camps during World War 11.
According to Wyman. President
Roosevelt's administration claimed that ship
ping capacity limitations and security prob
lems prevented the United States from
bringing Jewish refugees to this country, yet
the government still managed to bring over
400,000 prisoners of war and 100,000 non-
Jewish refugees to the United States, while
supply ships continued to return empty from
Europe.
As I read a review of Wyman's book in the
New York Times Book Review (Dec. 16,

1984), 1 wondered what lesson we can learn
— if any — from this dark period of our
recent past. Certainly, any American with the
least amount of compassion should wince in
shame to learn of such reprehensible behavior
on the part of his own country at a time when
its shelter was desperately needed by so many
victims of persecution. What, then, does this
teach us? To my mind, the obvious lesson is
that the United States should never close its
doors to refugees from other countries who
are forced to seek sanctuary from torture,
rape, arbitrary imprisonment or wanton ex
ecution by their own governments.
Like the Jews of Eastern Europe during
World War 11, refugees from El Salvador and
Guatemala are risking their lives to escape
from their countries and to seek safety in the
"land of the free." Once in the United States,
however, they encounter a government which
shows little sympathy for their distress. In El
Salvador and Guatemala, government troops
have used American weapons to torture and
kill tens of thousands of their own people, yet
the Reagan administration insists that those
fleeing these countries are simply "economic
refugees" looking for better jobs. Girded by

this justification, the United States Immigra
tion and Naturalization Service (INS) has
recently stepped up its efforts to track down
and deport Central Americans who are here
illegally. These operations reached a fever
pitch earlier this month when INS officials
staged raids on several churches which have
joined what has become known as the
"Sanctuary Movement." More than 200
churches across the United States — in New
York. Pittsburgh. Chicago, Corpus Christi.
Tucson. San Diego, Los Angeles, San Fran
cisco, Seattle and many other cities — have
formed an underground railway system to
help bring the victims of political repression in
Central America (the vast majority are from
El Salvador and Guatemala) to the United
States and to provide refuge for them, in
defiance of immigration law. At least 16
people — including a Protestant minister, two
Roman Catholic priests and three nuns —
now face trial and the possibility of stiff prison
sentences for their actions, considered a
felony under U.S. law. More than 60 other
sanctuary workers have been arrested.
Why does the-U.S. government refuse to
admit that the people from these countries are

fleeing for their lives, rather than simply
looking for better economic conditions? It
certainly cannot be for lack of evidence — ac
cording to Amnesty International, more than
40,000 Salvadorans have been murdered by
government troops over the past five years.
Could it be that we simply have no more room
in this country to accommodate these new im
migrants?
In the first place, the richest nation in the
world would have a tough time convincing the
rest of the world of this — assuming it even
cared to try. Second, this premise is not sup
ported by recent statistics: In a recent 18-
month period, the United States granted
citizenship to 13,000 people from Eastern
Europe and 700 from Central America
(mostly from Cuba).
It seems that the United States will accept
the tired, the poor and the hungry with open
arms — provided they are running from a
"communist" country. It is difficult to avoid
the conclusion that the reason why the U.S.
government refuses to accommodate Sal
vadoran and Guatemalan refugees is that to
do so would be an admission of a failed
foreign policy in Central America.

It would he unrealistic to demand that the
Reagan administration admit that it is largeK
responsible for perpetuating the violence
from which these people are fleeing. Instead,
spokesmen for the Sanctuary Movement —
including three Roman Catholic bishops —
have requested that the U.S. government
grant "extended departure status" to refugees
from Guatemala and El Salvador until the
violence in their countries subsides.
By instituting such a policy, the U.S. gov
ernment would merely be enforcing its own
laws. The 1980 Congressional Refugee Act
requires that victims of political persecution
in other countries be offered asylum in the
United States.
Forty years ago, this country turned a deal
ear to the voices of Eastern Europeans who
cried out from beneath the Nazi cleaver.
Today, the victims of government brutality in
Central America knock weakly on the gates
of our nation. The government of the United
States must recognize that it is our moral duty
as a free and compassionate society to let
them in.
