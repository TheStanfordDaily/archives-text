French house blame
As one of Stanford's more enthu
siastic Francophiles, I would cer
tainly oppose any attempt to close
the French House; at the same time,
I must take exception to one of the
explanations for the failure of the
house to attract residents offered bv
Resident Assistant Claude Millman
(The Daily, Jan. 14): that the
"inaccurate" reputation of the house
for having gay residents has dis
couraged potential applicants.
One wishes that Millman had
placed the blame in this instance
precisely where it lies: not with the
"reputation" of the French House,
nor with past or current residents
who are members of the gay commu
nity. but rather with those anti-gay
individuals who are unwilling to
share University housing with open
gay men and lesbians. Perhaps one

should remind such individuals of
some of the great figures in French
culture they would have felt con
strained to snub for the same reason
Andre Gide, Marcel Proust, Colette,
Jean Cocteau. Michel Foucault,
Roland Barthes. . . .
One should also point out that
French culture — unlike American
— is distinctly noH-homophobic.
Virtually the only group in France
currently advancing blatantly anti
gay ideology is the neo-Vichyite
National Front Party of Jean-Marie
Le Pen, which is regarded by the
majority of the French as an embar
rassing band of fascist cranks.
Supposed Francophiles who avoid
the French House because of its gay
reputation would do well to take
note of this fact and consider that
few among the French would have
any difficulty seeing their anti-gay
sentiments for exactly what they are.

Clearly, if the French House has a
problem in this regard, it is a homop
hobia problem, not a homosexual
problem. Admittedly, it is often
easier to blame the victim, but only
at the expense of reason and justice.
I trust that genuine enthusiasts of
French culture, with its tradition of
critical clarity, will not want part of
such thinking.

ARLO appeal
ARI.O is a nationally unique
program that arranges faculty
supervised research projects for
approximately 600 students annually
with local non-profit organizations.
We read in a news release this
morning that Carolyn Lougee has
stated the importance of under
graduates being involved in research.
Research "engrosses a person in a

different way from what classes do.
(sic) It throws the student on his/her
independent faculties in a way 110
other experience can. It also opens
new avenues for communication and
collaboration with the faculty." The
students are already involved in
research in collaboration with the
faculty. University President Donald
Kennedy's fondest aspirations for
public service involvement are being
realized through the Action Re
search Liaison Office program.
ARLO is the largest undergraduate
program in the University, outside of
departments. The ARLO program
has been terminated without expla
nation. The rights of students to a
voice in their own education have
been violated in this dissolution.
In a recent review, no fault was
found in ARL.O's function or perfor
mance. We are confused by repeated
public statements of encouragement

for students to participate in commu
nity service and to perform research
at the undergraduate level and the
dissolution of what has been cited by
The New York Times as an out
standing public service program
nationally. We demand that ARLO
continue in its current form. Your
student voice can make a difference.
Donald Kennedy will listen.

ARLO hoard student co-chairs
Co-ops will stay
As a member of the Committee on
Services to Students-Residences, the
University committee wherein a
decision will be made on whether or
not to close a co-op or co-ops at
Stanford, I would like briefly to
respond to the editorial (The Daily,

Jan. 22) regarding this topic.
The Daily editorial appears to
have been written under the assump
tion that the question before the
committee is about the desirability of
the co-op housing option at Stanford
and that the very survival of this
option lives or dies depending upon
the committee's recommendation to
Residential Education. This is not
the case. The question before the
committee is whether or not one or
possibly two existing co-op programs
ought to be discontinued and alter
nate operational structures (e.g.
U-ops, such as Yost, self-ops, etc.)
be reinstituted in these houses so as
better to accord numbers of housing
options with student desires and
demands. Co-ops as an institution at
Stanford are not in question.

ARLO hoard student co-chairs
Co-ops will stay
As a member of the Committee on
Services to Students-Residences, the
University committee wherein a
decision will be made on whether or
not to close a co-op or co-ops at
Stanford, I would like briefly to
respond to the editorial (The Daily,

Jan. 22) regarding this topic.
The Daily editorial appears to
have been written under the assump
tion that the question before the
committee is about the desirability of
the co-op housing option at Stanford
and that the very survival of this
option lives or dies depending upon
the committee's recommendation to
Residential Education. This is not
the case. The question before the
committee is whether or not one or
possibly two existing co-op programs
ought to be discontinued and alter
nate operational structures (e.g.
U-ops, such as Yost, self-ops, etc.)
be reinstituted in these houses so as
better to accord numbers of housing
options with student desires and
demands. Co-ops as an institution at
Stanford are not in question.

French house blame
As one of Stanford's more enthu
siastic Francophiles, I would cer
tainly oppose any attempt to close
the French House; at the same time,
I must take exception to one of the
explanations for the failure of the
house to attract residents offered bv
Resident Assistant Claude Millman
(The Daily, Jan. 14): that the
"inaccurate" reputation of the house
for having gay residents has dis
couraged potential applicants.
One wishes that Millman had
placed the blame in this instance
precisely where it lies: not with the
"reputation" of the French House,
nor with past or current residents
who are members of the gay commu
nity. but rather with those anti-gay
individuals who are unwilling to
share University housing with open
gay men and lesbians. Perhaps one

should remind such individuals of
some of the great figures in French
culture they would have felt con
strained to snub for the same reason
Andre Gide, Marcel Proust, Colette,
Jean Cocteau. Michel Foucault,
Roland Barthes. . . .
One should also point out that
French culture — unlike American
— is distinctly noH-homophobic.
Virtually the only group in France
currently advancing blatantly anti
gay ideology is the neo-Vichyite
National Front Party of Jean-Marie
Le Pen, which is regarded by the
majority of the French as an embar
rassing band of fascist cranks.
Supposed Francophiles who avoid
the French House because of its gay
reputation would do well to take
note of this fact and consider that
few among the French would have
any difficulty seeing their anti-gay
sentiments for exactly what they are.

Clearly, if the French House has a
problem in this regard, it is a homop
hobia problem, not a homosexual
problem. Admittedly, it is often
easier to blame the victim, but only
at the expense of reason and justice.
I trust that genuine enthusiasts of
French culture, with its tradition of
critical clarity, will not want part of
such thinking.

ARLO appeal
ARI.O is a nationally unique
program that arranges faculty
supervised research projects for
approximately 600 students annually
with local non-profit organizations.
We read in a news release this
morning that Carolyn Lougee has
stated the importance of under
graduates being involved in research.
Research "engrosses a person in a

different way from what classes do.
(sic) It throws the student on his/her
independent faculties in a way 110
other experience can. It also opens
new avenues for communication and
collaboration with the faculty." The
students are already involved in
research in collaboration with the
faculty. University President Donald
Kennedy's fondest aspirations for
public service involvement are being
realized through the Action Re
search Liaison Office program.
ARLO is the largest undergraduate
program in the University, outside of
departments. The ARLO program
has been terminated without expla
nation. The rights of students to a
voice in their own education have
been violated in this dissolution.
In a recent review, no fault was
found in ARL.O's function or perfor
mance. We are confused by repeated
public statements of encouragement

for students to participate in commu
nity service and to perform research
at the undergraduate level and the
dissolution of what has been cited by
The New York Times as an out
standing public service program
nationally. We demand that ARLO
continue in its current form. Your
student voice can make a difference.
Donald Kennedy will listen.
