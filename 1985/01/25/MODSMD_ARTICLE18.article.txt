## Mending our Indochina legacy 
### 
As the dry season returns to Indochina. Indoc
hina returns to the news. The Vietnamese are
taking advantage of the weather to consolidate
their occupation of Kampuchea by moving against
resistance forces based along the Thailand border.
Vietnam is portrayed as the bad guy in this con
flict. which is somewhat remarkable, considering
that it invaded in l l >7S to remove Pol Pot's Khmer
Rouge, widely considered to be genocidal and
psychopathic. It is constantly stressed in the Ameri
can press that Vietnam is fighting the
"noncommunist" resistance — a largely meaning
less qualifier, as the three guerrilla groups — the
Khmer Rouge included — combined forces in
l c )7y. putting aside whatever differences might ex
ist between them in the interest of getting Vietnam
out.
Why is it that Prince Sihanouk and others like
him. who share none of Pol Pot's ideological goals,
arc willing to join with him to free their country ? A
believable answer to this question can only be
found if one clears awav some of the common wis
dom about Kampuchea.
As Noam Chomsky and Edward Herman amply
document in "Alter the Cataclysm," their book on
post-war Indochina, sloppy journalism and a
hunger for communist horror stories have created a
distorted picture of the Kampuchean situation.
I his is the image, for example, that one gets from
the recent film. " I'he Killing Fields": Khmer
Rouge leaders are portrayed as random killers who
enslaved the entire population through sheer ter
ror.
(" I lie Killing Fields" is bound to he important in
shaping attitudes about Kampuchea. To comple
ment its questionable history, it offers a I onto-like
Kampuchean hero, a vicious depiction of all Asians
lacking the courtesy to speak Fnglish, and an os
tentatious show of smug liberal handwashing. To

give the film credit, it does demonstrate the Ameri
can role in the horrors it presents — with Tricky
Dick explaining that "Cambodia is the Nixon
doctrine in its purest form.")
It's true that the Khmer Rouge's human rights
record was terrible. But the evidence Chomsky and
Herman present does not support allegations of a
Kampuchean holocaust, and it is probable that
some Khmer Rouge policies — such as the forced
evacuation of Phnom Penh — prevented the deaths
of many who would have otherwise starved.
More to the point, the Khmer Rouge seems to
have had extensive support among the peasantry,
who constitute the vast majority of Kampuchea —
a disturbing idea, but the only way one can explain
the resistance the Vietnamese invasion faced and
the inclusion of the Khmer Rouge in the united
front against Vietnam.
But it is not a hidden sympathy for agrarian com
munism, certainly, that leads the United States to
what is undoubtedly one of the most blatant exam
ples of moral bankruptcy in the modern era: CIA
funding of Pol Pot's guerrilla war. In our regime's
eyes, the methods or ultimate goals o! our pawns
are irrelevant. What is important is that the CIA
has found a new way to harass the Vietnamese,
who committed the unpardonable sin of leaving the
U.S. empire.
There was a lot of talk a few years ago about get
ting over the "Vietnam Syndrome." a supposed na
tional neurosis that inhibited us from wielding our
manliness in a totally unrestrained way. After
Nicaragua. Lebanon and Grenada, it's clear that
we've been cured, all right.
The real Vietnam Syndrome is the delusion that
we have the right to use whatever overt or covert
violence is necessary to protect our "national inter
ests." This is what allows lis to fund Pol Pot. to sup
port Marcos, to murder coffee pickers in

Nicaragua, all in the name of "democracy." And
we won't be cured of that until we acknowledge the
debt that we owe to the Vietnamese people for our
occupation of their country.
It's difficult to estimate casualties in a war as
bloody as the one in Vietnam, but a rough guess is
that the American military killed upwards of two
million people in Vietnam — a third of the number
of Jews killed by Hitler.
The U.S. government recently published its
opinion on the Vietnamese occupation of Kampuc
hea — the gist was that no country has the right to
try to determine the government of any other
country. A nation which has had four-and-a-half
million tons of bombs dropped on it. as a
demonstration of respect for self-determination,
will not fail to see the irony.
The United States — government and citizens
alike — tries to use the problems of Indochina
today as an excuse for our having subjected it for
20 years to bombings, massacres, assassinations,
defoliation, concentration camps and subversion.
After destroying its societies, we justify the
destruction on the grounds that these countries, a
decade into rebuilding, do not meet our standards
of justice and material comfort.
America should declare a moratorium on moral
condemnation, at least until the Agent Orange with
which we poisoned Vietnam has washed its way out
of the soil. If we want to do something constructive,
we might stay out of the current Indochinese con
flict. and pressure our client Thailand and our ally
China to do the same. Then we might offer Viet
nam reconstruction aid as an inducement for
leasing Kampuchea — the aid that we promised
them under the 1973 peace treaty, that any moral
nation would have given it long ago.
