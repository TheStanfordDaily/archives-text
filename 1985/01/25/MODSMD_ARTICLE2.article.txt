# Drop in Law applications noted
## 
### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Staff writer 
The slight decline in Law School applications
over the past few years has not detracted from Law
School Dean John Ely's optimism, as evidenced by
his report at yesterday's Faculty Senate meeting.
In other senate business. Geology Prof. Irwin
Remson, former chairman of the Committee on
Academic Achievement and Appraisal (C-AAA),
addressed the value of teacher evaluation forms
and the need to improve teaching and exam
scheduling at Stanford.
Faculty members also discussed their reactions to
the Super Bowl.
In his report, Ely commented that he would not
be surprised if this year's incoming law class is a
little less qualified than previous classes. Ely said

that the acceptance policy at the Law School has
been changed to stress originality and character.
For example, 21 students out of a possible 170 of
this year's first-year law students are over 30, and
28 have already acquired other advanced degrees.
Ely discussed both the small number of blacks
and the high percentage of women enrolled at the
Law School. Only six blacks are enrolled in this year's
first-year class. Ely attributes this to Stanford's
geographical location and the tendency for blacks
to go to Harvard, where there are more blacks en
rolled. There are 19 Hispanics in the class.
Forty-nine percent of the students are women,
an unusually high percentage when compared with
the 33 to 40 percent enrolled at similar institutions.
Ely said that an even larger percentage of women
may be accepted this year.

Ely, however, believes that Stanford would not
be rated number one if a poll were conducted. It
takes longer for reputation to catch up with
realism, he said. Ely said both Harvard and Yale
would rank Stanford second after themselves.
Ely commented that it is currently "a good per
iod for Stanford Law School." We are "all feeling
pretty smug about the place."
He commented on the enormous interest in cor
porate law. Between 94 and 97 percent of all
graduates in recent years have entered law firms,
as opposed to public-interest law or government.
This percentage is significantly higher than that of
similar institutions.
