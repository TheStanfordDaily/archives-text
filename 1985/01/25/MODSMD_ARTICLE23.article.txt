## World-class art in our own backyard 
### FRANK LESTER Staff writer 
One of the most imposing pieces of
art Stanford Museum has acquired in
recent memory is Auguste Rodin's
"The Gates of Hell." Still, the sight of
that shattering masterpiece should
not prevent you from walking into the
museum and surveying the B. Gerald
Cantor Collection, which, taken as a
full statement of the sculptural vir
tuosity of Rodin, is an experience in
and of itself.
Stanford Museum has the second
largest Rodin collection in the world.
Most of the nearly 100 sculptures are
Icopies of original Rodins cast from
Imolds the artist willed to the French
Jgovernment shortly before his death
5n 1917.
[ This does not lessen their
originality; most of the clay originals
•Rodin fashioned with his hands were
generally destroyed in translation to
terra cotta, plaster and bronze. After
Rodin died, the Musee Rodin, estab
lished by the French government to
£tore his works, authorized the
Replication of the artist's work of up
tii 12 copies, then destroyed the
itiolds from which they were cast.
tThese copies are some of what the
Stanford Museum began acquiring in
J974.
You get a sense of the function
Rodin served as a bridge between
classical and modern art when you
compare other sculptures scattered
about the museum and the campus
with the Rodin collection itself.
Rodin strikes an intriguing balance
between the potent rationality and
precision of form displayed in the
Classical statues adorning the
ijiuseum's entranceway and the often
SJespairing starkness of design dis
played in such statuary works as Ar
naldo Pomodoro's "Cube" and
fceorge Segal's "Gay Liberation."
- The centerpiece of the Cantor Col
lection exemplifies this sense of
bridging in a most striking way. The
"Age of Bronze" is a life-size statue
$112 a young male nude in pain. At least
it seems as if he is pain; one of
Rodin's gifts of nuance is fixing the
laces of his human figures in states of
ambiguous emotion that reveal only
Che truth of emotion itself, not neces
sarily any particular condition of
feeling. One of the figure's hands is in
gis hair, as if pulling hair out of his
scalp will somehow balance out the
f'ain tightening the entirety of his
orm.
One of Rodin's most deeply held
aesthetic principles was that art had
to have character. "Whatever is false,
Whatever is artificial, whatever seeks
to be pretty rather than expressive,
whatever is capricious and affected,
whatever smiles without motive,
Sends or struts without cause, is man
nered without reason; all that is with

out soul and without truth; all that is
only a parade of beauty and grace;
all. in short, that lies, is ugliness in
art." he once said.
Not only is this reflected in "The
Age of Bronze." perhaps the most
classically beautiful of his sculptures,
but in pieces like "The Burghers of
Calais," which reflect the sense of
character Rodin sought to infuse in
his art. "The Burghers" in Stanford
Museum are composed of 1 1 in
dividual studies Rodin did for a
monument he was commissioned to
sculpt by the city of Calais in 1884.
The monument commemorates a
1347 incident in which six leaders of
the city offered themselves and the
keys of the city to the King of En
gland in order to spare Calais from
total destruction.
What makes "The Burghers of
Calais" a masterpiece is its schism
with artistic convention in almost
every way. The leaders of Calais who
commissioned Rodin to fashion the
monument did not expect him to
sculpt six gaunt, agonized, fearful fig
ures in a state of wretched disarray.
You know they are the burghers of
history when you see the keys of the
city in one of the figure's hands; but
beyond that, the figures defy every bit
of conventional heroism usually lent
such figures in monumental
sculpture. A traditional sculptor
would have had the burghers striding
to their doom with confidence and
zeal. This is out of character, in
Rodin's estimation.
"1 did not hesitate to make them as
thin and weak as possible," Rodin
said of the figures later. "If, in order
to respect some academic convention
or other, 1 had tried to show bodies
that were still agreeable to look at. I
would have betrayed my subject.
These people, having passed through
the privations of a long siege, no
longer have anything but skin on their
bones. The more frightful my repre
sentation of them, the more people
should praise me for knowing how to
show the truth of history."
It seems that Rodin thought that
the harmony of classical art instituted
specific truths and left others out. A
classical representation of a rock, for
example, would preserve all the natu
ral harmony of the rock's color, con
tour and perhaps even its shape. But
it would fail to represent the rock's
true identity and characteristics. It is
what classical art left out that Rodin
sought to instill in his art forms.
The Stanford Museum is open for
viewings of the Cantor Collection
every day except Monday. Its hours
are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesdays
through Fridays, and 1-5 p.m. on
weekends. Guided tours of the Rodin
sculptures are given on Wednesday
and Saturday afternoons at 2.
