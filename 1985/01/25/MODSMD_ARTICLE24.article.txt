As the Air Force's jets flew their practice runs Saturday
in anticipation of the next day's Super Bowl halftime fes
tivities, another celebration was in progress as yet another
restaurant opened its doors. However, Compadres is no
ordinary restaurant, nor was this an ordinary grand
opening.
A year ago, Compadres Mexican Restaurant began op
eration in Hawaii. To ensure its success, the restaurant
was blessed by a Hawaiian reverend. Whether due to this
christening, the excellent margaritas or tender barbecued
ribs and variety of Mexican appetizers and tempting
entrees, Compadres was a hit. Consequently, manage
ment decided to expand and chose as their mainland loca
tion Palo Alto, one mile south of Stanford on El Camino
Real.
Large picture windows front the street and the view
from the sidewalk looking into the restaurant is much
more appealing than the view for those looking out.
Tables are set at comfortable distances from one another,
and the wicker chairs and decor are intended to provide a
relaxed, cozy setting. The restaurant is light and airy. In
addition to indoor dining facilities, Compadres is distin
guished by a wonderful and spacious outdoor patio com
plete with heaters, a white adobe fireplace and quick

footed waiters and waitreses prepared to satisfy even the
most demanding client.
If the employees of Compadres could survive the grand
opening, any other evening will seem relaxed in compari
son. We arrived shortly after 3:30 on Saturday afternoon
to witness the "traditional" blessing performed by the
Rev. Abraham Akaka. The crowd was so thick we
couldn't hear a word until someone shouted "Who here is
ready for a margarita?" Everyone loudly cheered ap
proval and then began to file slowly inside. As parties
seated themselves, the employees rushed around bearing
large trays of Mexican "aperitivos" including taquitos,
barbecue ribs and fajitas sticks, which are garlic-marinated
skirt steak or chicken breasts, skewered and quickly
grilled. Other employees carrying large pitchers 0/
magaritas in both hands could not seem to replenish
empty glasses quickly enough.
Meanwhile, outside on the patio, mariachi band memr
bers strummed their guitars and sang. Barbecues were
manned b\ bartenders and cooks alike; the activity wa*
extremely frenzied. The atmosphere was festive . . .
easily could have been a post-Super Bowl 4Mer celebra
tion. The opening of Compadres is nothing less than
auspicious, and as we left we couldn't doubt that this res*
taurant will soon be a popular Stanford hang out.
