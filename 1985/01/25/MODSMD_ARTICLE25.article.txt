## Cardinal tries to break 35-year streak 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
The last time the Stanford men's
basketball team beat UCLA in Los
Angeles, no one on the current team
was close to being born. Asst. Coach
Bruce Pearl wasn't born either, and
Head Coach Tom Davis wasn't even
a teenager.
That was in 1952, when Stanford
beat the Bruins 73-71. Little did
anyone know that Stanford, which
plays at UCLA tomorrow night at
7:30, would lose its next 35 straight
to UCLA in Los Angeles. That in
cludes all 19 of its games in 12,800-
seat Pauley Pavilion, the Bruins'
home since 1965.
But this was supposed to be the
season when all the Bruin streaks
ended. When things like Stanford
beating UCLA at Pauley or the Uni
versity of California at Berkeley
beating UCLA anywhere (Cal has
lost 51 straight to the Bruins) would
happen.
UCLA's top three players from last
year's disappointing 17-11 team —
the first in 18 years not to win 20
games — had graduated to the pros,
including one (center Stuart Gray)
with a year of eligibility remaining.
Critics were saying the last remants of
the dynasty created by a fellow
named John Wooden were gone. The
dynasty was finally, officially over,
they said.
And when UCLA lost six of its first
eight games this season, the critics
loved every minute of it.
A short month later, those who so
vocally ripped the Bruins in Decem
ber are suddenly silent. UCLA has
won six of its last eight, including an
80-69 victory over Cal last night. The
Bruins have raised their record to 8-7
overall and 5-2 in the Pacific-10 Con
ference. They are 6-1 at Pauley, and
undefeated there after losing their
home opener to Santa Clara Univer
sity. The two Pac-10 losses were both
on the road, one hy a point, the other
by two.
In a word, the Bruins are back.
"You look at their schedule in the
early going," Pearl said, "and they're
on the road at DePaul, at Memphis
State, at Brigham Young and at St.
John's. Those are games you just
can't count on winning.
"People also forget that they've got
three McDonald's All-Americans
playing on their team," he continued,
referring to the annual team of the
nation's top 25 prep players selected
by the McDonald's of hamburger

fame. "They've got the talent to be at
the top of this league again."
And after Larry Farmer was fired
last year, they've got the coach, too.
Rookie Coach Walt Hazzard not only
played for Wooden in the early

19605, he coaches like him. Long,
grueling practices, a disciplined of
fense and an aggressive defense.
"He's got them playing tough man
to-man defense," Pearl said.
"They're just playing harder in all

areas. And then you combine that
with their talent and you've got one
of the better teams in the Pac-10."
All of which is bad news to Stan
ford, 9-6 overall but only 1-4 in the
rugged Pac-10. The Cardinal is 1-6

away from home — 0-5 in road
games and 1-1 at neutral sites — and
all four of its conference defeats have
been of the double figure variety.
Last Saturday's 15-point loss to rival
Cal, the Bears' first victory in the

Pac-10 this season, was the most
recent, not to mention disheartening.
"When Stanford plays Stanford's
game, we can beat any team on our
schedule." Pearl said. "But when we
get away from that we're going to
Fose. So what we've been trying to do
in practice this week is to play
smarter. It's in the transition from of
fense to defense that we have our
problems."
Another problem has been shoot
ing. both inside and outside. In Pac
-10 games, Stanford is shooting a
miserable 39.5 percent from the
floor, worst in the conference. The
next worst shooting team is Washing
ton State University at 44 percent.
Compounding the Cardinal's
shooting (or lack thereof) will be the
Bruins' aggressive man-to-man
defense. UCLA is ranked first in
field-goal-percentage defense and
second in scoring defense, as its op
ponents are shooting 39.1 percent
and scoring 55.2 points per game.
Davis will most likely go with the
starting lineup he's used for the past
two games— Keith Ramee and John
Paye at guard. Earl Koberlein and
Andy Fischer at forward and Kent
Seymour at center. Freshman Greg
Butler, who had a team-high I I
rebounds against Cal, probably will
see considerable playing time off the
bench, especially considering Kober
lein's back problems.
For UCLA, Hazzard has for the
most part stuck with the starting
lineup he announced on the first day
of practice. Brad Wright, a 6-foot-11
center averaging 15 points and a
league-leading nine rebounds, for
ward Gary Maloncon and 6-6 guard
Nigel Miguel have started all 15
games. Reggie Miller, the brother of
all-everything Cheryl Miller, should
get the call at the other forward and
either Corey Gaines or Montel
Hatcher at the other guard.
If Stanford's losing streak against
UCLA in Los Angeles is extended to
36 and its streak of defeats in Pauley
to 20, the Cardinal will have to look
for conference win number two Mon
day night at the University of South
ern California, 10-4 overall and in
second place in the Pac-10 with a 4-1
record.
"But if we can get a win against one
of these teams, we jump a few
notches (in the Pac-10 race)," Pearl
said. A split against the Los Angeles
schools could jump the Cardinal from
eighth to as high as sixth place. "Then
we're back in it."

rejuvenation of the Bruins by leading the Pac-10 in rebounding,
averaging nine a game along with scoring 14 a game.

lineup he announced on the first day
of practice. Brad Wright, a 6-foot-11
center averaging 15 points and a
league-leading nine rebounds, for
ward Gary Maloncon and 6-6 guard
Nigel Miguel have started all 15
games. Reggie Miller, the brother of
all-everything Cheryl Miller, should
get the call at the other forward and
either Corey Gaines or Montel
Hatcher at the other guard.
If Stanford's losing streak against
UCLA in Los Angeles is extended to
36 and its streak of defeats in Pauley
to 20, the Cardinal will have to look
for conference win number two Mon
day night at the University of South
ern California, 10-4 overall and in
second place in the Pac-10 with a 4-1
record.
"But if we can get a win against one
of these teams, we jump a few
notches (in the Pac-10 race)," Pearl
said. A split against the Los Angeles
schools could jump the Cardinal from
eighth to as high as sixth place. "Then
we're back in it."

Conference forward Kenney Fields. Wright, however, is helping the
rejuvenation of the Bruins by leading the Pac-10 in rebounding,
averaging nine a game along with scoring 14 a game.
The last time the Stanford men's
basketball team beat UCLA in Los
Angeles, no one on the current team
was close to being born. Asst. Coach
Bruce Pearl wasn't born either, and
Head Coach Tom Davis wasn't even
a teenager.
That was in 1952, when Stanford
beat the Bruins 73-71. Little did
anyone know that Stanford, which
plays at UCLA tomorrow night at
7:30, would lose its next 35 straight
to UCLA in Los Angeles. That in
cludes all 19 of its games in 12,800-
seat Pauley Pavilion, the Bruins'
home since 1965.
But this was supposed to be the
season when all the Bruin streaks
ended. When things like Stanford
beating UCLA at Pauley or the Uni
versity of California at Berkeley
beating UCLA anywhere (Cal has
lost 51 straight to the Bruins) would
happen.
UCLA's top three players from last
year's disappointing 17-11 team —
the first in 18 years not to win 20
games — had graduated to the pros,
including one (center Stuart Gray)
with a year of eligibility remaining.
Critics were saying the last remants of
the dynasty created by a fellow
named John Wooden were gone. The
dynasty was finally, officially over,
they said.
And when UCLA lost six of its first
eight games this season, the critics
loved every minute of it.
A short month later, those who so
vocally ripped the Bruins in Decem
ber are suddenly silent. UCLA has
won six of its last eight, including an
80-69 victory over Cal last night. The
Bruins have raised their record to 8-7
overall and 5-2 in the Pacific-10 Con
ference. They are 6-1 at Pauley, and
undefeated there after losing their
home opener to Santa Clara Univer
sity. The two Pac-10 losses were both
on the road, one hy a point, the other
by two.
In a word, the Bruins are back.
"You look at their schedule in the
early going," Pearl said, "and they're
on the road at DePaul, at Memphis
State, at Brigham Young and at St.
John's. Those are games you just
can't count on winning.
"People also forget that they've got
three McDonald's All-Americans
playing on their team," he continued,
referring to the annual team of the
nation's top 25 prep players selected
by the McDonald's of hamburger

fame. "They've got the talent to be at
the top of this league again."
And after Larry Farmer was fired
last year, they've got the coach, too.
Rookie Coach Walt Hazzard not only
played for Wooden in the early

19605, he coaches like him. Long,
grueling practices, a disciplined of
fense and an aggressive defense.
"He's got them playing tough man
to-man defense," Pearl said.
"They're just playing harder in all

areas. And then you combine that
with their talent and you've got one
of the better teams in the Pac-10."
All of which is bad news to Stan
ford, 9-6 overall but only 1-4 in the
rugged Pac-10. The Cardinal is 1-6

away from home — 0-5 in road
games and 1-1 at neutral sites — and
all four of its conference defeats have
been of the double figure variety.
Last Saturday's 15-point loss to rival
Cal, the Bears' first victory in the

Pac-10 this season, was the most
recent, not to mention disheartening.
"When Stanford plays Stanford's
game, we can beat any team on our
schedule." Pearl said. "But when we
get away from that we're going to
Fose. So what we've been trying to do
in practice this week is to play
smarter. It's in the transition from of
fense to defense that we have our
problems."
Another problem has been shoot
ing. both inside and outside. In Pac
-10 games, Stanford is shooting a
miserable 39.5 percent from the
floor, worst in the conference. The
next worst shooting team is Washing
ton State University at 44 percent.
Compounding the Cardinal's
shooting (or lack thereof) will be the
Bruins' aggressive man-to-man
defense. UCLA is ranked first in
field-goal-percentage defense and
second in scoring defense, as its op
ponents are shooting 39.1 percent
and scoring 55.2 points per game.
Davis will most likely go with the
starting lineup he's used for the past
two games— Keith Ramee and John
Paye at guard. Earl Koberlein and
Andy Fischer at forward and Kent
Seymour at center. Freshman Greg
Butler, who had a team-high I I
rebounds against Cal, probably will
see considerable playing time off the
bench, especially considering Kober
lein's back problems.
For UCLA, Hazzard has for the
most part stuck with the starting
lineup he announced on the first day
