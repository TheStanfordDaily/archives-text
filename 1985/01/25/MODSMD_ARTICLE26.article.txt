## 
### 
Academy Award winner Timo
thy Hutton plays a very new
kind of hero in "Turk 182!" As
the fighting mad, hip and re
sourceful Jimmy Lynch, he
sets out to prove you can battle
City Hall to right a wrong. His
older brother, a firefighter, is
injured while saving a child
from a burning tenement. But
since he was off-duty and hav
ing a drink in the local bar, an

uncaring city bureaucracy has
refused him a pension.
Crusader Excites City
When the mayor is too busy
running for re-election to hear
his case, Jimmy Lynch takes
matters into his own hands.
Using only his wits, Jimmy sets
out to prove that you can fight
City Hall, and the entire city
rallies behind the mysterious
crusader known as Turk 182.
Hutton proves riveting as
Jimmy Lynch, a budding artist
pushed into action to fight for
his brother's life —and justice.
Recently starring with Sean
Penn and Lori Singer in "The
Falcon and the Snowman",
Hutton has followed his Oscar
winning debut in "Ordinary
People" with extraordinary

performances in films such as
"Taps", "Daniel" and "Iceman".
Joining Hutton in this exciting
urban adventure are Robert
Urich, Kim Cattrall, Robert
Culp, Darren McGavin and
Peter Boyle.

New Wave David who brings a
crooked Goliath of a mayor to
his knees. New York thrills to
