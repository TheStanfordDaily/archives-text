# FEBRUARY MEANS "MISCHIEF" FOR MOVIEGOERS
## 
### 
Doug McKeon is burning up—
he's getting dangerously close
to college without hitting a
"home run" with any girl,
much less Kelly Presfon, the
cutest one in the class. Let's
face it—it's the 1950'5, and
Doug would settle for a "sin
gle". That is. until big city bud
dy (and screen newcomer) Chris
Nash arrives at school and bets

that he can help Doug hit a
grand slam.
A winning cast
The cast of "Mischief" is
particularly hip. Doug Mc-
Keon is best known as the
"suck-face" kid in "On Gold
en Pond". Kelly Preston, soon
to be seen in the upcoming
"Secret Admirer", played the

luscious damsel in distress in
"Metal Storm". Catherine
Mary Stewart, who plays Chris
Nash's girlfriend, was a smash
hit as the lead in both "Night
of the Comet" and "The Last
Starfighter".
Major league mischief
Together, Doug, Kelly, Chris
and Catherine stir up more
rowdy "mischief" than little
Nelsonville, Ohio can take in
one year. We're talking major
league tomfoolery here: motor
cycles on sidewalks, cars on
fire hydrants, parents on the
warpath, romance on the sly.
In short, all the things that
make life worth living before
college.
The cars may have changed,
but the action in the back seat
has not!
