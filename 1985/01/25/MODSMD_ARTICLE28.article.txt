# Basketball team takes on St. Mary's
## Women look to go over even mark tonight 
### JOHN LIS Staff sportswriter 
Two-thirds of the way through the
1984-85 season, the Stanford
women's basketball team is on track
toward its preseason goal of a .500
record. Stanford evened its record at
9-9 Wednesday night with an 8 1-77
victory over the University of the
Pacific.
Tonight the Cardinal will try to
make that a winning record when it
travels to Moraga to face St. Mary's
College in a non-conference game.
Stanford will also be going after its
fourth straight victory.
"We're going to play with the idea
of gaining momentum for going down
to LA. We want to play in the league
with this behind us," Stanford Head
Coach Dotty McCrea said. McCrea's
team will resume play in the Western
Collegiate Athletic Association next
Friday in Los Angeles against UCLA.
"Playing on the road is always
hard," McCrea said. "We've seen St.
Mary's. They're well-coached, and
they play together well. They gave
Cal (the University of California at
Berkeley) a heckuva game, and they
almost beat San Jose State."
The Gaels are led by returning let
ter m en Patricia Neeley and Ann
Cooper, who are part of a unit of four
juniors and a senior who lost only one
home game last year in going 24-6.
Stanford won the meeting last year,
75-55, at Maples Pavilion.
St. Mary's is a member of the Na
tional Association of Intercollegiate
Athletics, an organization of smaller
colleges roughly corresponding to the

National Collegiate Athletic Associa
tion's Division 111.
The Cardinal's recent success is
largely due to an outside shooting
game that has come on in the past few
games, especially Wednesday's vic
tory over UOP. Forward Kami An
derson scored 30 points and guard
Virginia Sourlis had 29 in that game.
The Cardinal has been getting that
shooting against man-to-man
defenses, against which Stanford had
had problems earlier in the season.
Asst. Coach Mike Kehoe last night
attributed that to better ball move
ment in the offense.
Anderson agreed. Asked whether
the offense was designed to set
screens, she replied, "I think we were
just moving the ball. We were more
patient on offense â€” we didn't
panic."
She commented on the outside
shooting being effective against man
to-man defenses. "It really was last
night. I don't think it will be in other
games. I don't think we'll be able to
shoot this well against man-to-man
defenses all the time. I'm not sure. St.
Mary's will be a good test to see if
we've gotten better or if [Wednesday]
night was a nuke."
Sourlis shot 79 percent from the
field, and Anderson hit 63 percent of
her shots in that game.
McCrea said she expects St. Mary's
to play man-to-man tonight, and she
agreed with Anderson that outstand
ing outside shooting alone cannot be
expected to carry the team.
Tonight's game begins at 7:30 at
McKeon Pavilion.
