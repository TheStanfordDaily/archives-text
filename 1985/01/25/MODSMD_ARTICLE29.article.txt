## 
### ROB GRAHAM Staff sportswriter 
I he Stanford men's volleyball team, ranked sixth na
tionally in pre-season polls, travels to the Santa Bar
bara/Michelob Light Collegiate Invitational today for a
two-day, marathon event.
I he Cardinal expects to face what Co-coach Don Shaw
termed "a very strong field." Of the 20 schools that will
compete, Shaw said that "10 of them are really good
teams." The University of California at Santa Barbara will
host the event that will also include the likes of UCLA,
the University of Southern California, the University of
Hawaii and Long Beach State. Manitoba, a team that
features a number of Canadian Olympians, could also
challenge for honors.

In all, six of the United States' top 10 teams will he on
hand for the tournament. Shaw looked forward to ti
portunity to "scout six teams from our conference ani.
an idea of the sort of competition we will face this year."
Because Stanford will likely play eight games in two
days, endurance will he critical for the team's success.
"Conditioning will he a real factor," Shaw said.
Furthermore, because the Cardinal lacks the depth to
freely substitute players, it could have a problem with
fatigue. "Our problem," Shaw said, "is going to be we
only have 'X' number of guys we can use. After that, there
is a dropoff.
"We're going to play as long as we can as well as we can,
and get some experience. We need the game time and the
experience," Shaw continued. "Our players are chomping

at the bit waiting for some competition."
Vednesday's injury to sophomore Stephen Blue could
. ii', further into Stanford's bench. Blue's dislocated finger
was X-rayed yesterday, but it was unclear whether he
could make the trip south. The team desperately hopes to
avoid a recurrence of last year's debacle, when a fine
season was disrupted by a rash of injuries.
Shaw felt that another key for success, besides condi
tioning, would be the team's ability to adapt to different
styles of play. Stanford's performance could be contingent
upon "being able to adjust to what other teams are
doing," he said. "We haven't seen many of these teams
before."
Last year's scouting reports, too, might be largely irrel

evant because volleyball is a game of constantly changing
strategies.
Shaw welcomes the chance to refine a new offense he
installed in the off-season. To take advantage of senior
Craig Lauchner's uncanny ability to deliver sets to the hit
ters, the Cardinal is going with a single setter offense.
With this strategy, the effectiveness ot the offense rests
largely upon the shoulders of Lauchner. a pre-season
Second Team All-American. This new look offers, in the
words of Shaw, "a more diversified attack."
The Cardinal, which finished sixth here last year, hopes
to use the Santa Barbara invitational as a catapault into
California Intercollegiate Volleyball Association plav.
which begins next week.
