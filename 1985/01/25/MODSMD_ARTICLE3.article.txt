# Chrysler regains prominence
## 
### FRANK MARX 
The Chrysler Corporation faced
certain bankruptcy in 1979, but
through a complete financial reorgan
ization initiated by corporation Presi
dent Lee lacocca, it has regained its
prominence as one of the world's
finest automobile manufacturers, ac
cording to a senior official in the
Chrysler Corporation.
In an address to an overflow crowd
of about 60 people at the Graduate
School of Business, Robert Miller,
executive vice president of finance of
the Chrysler Corporation, described
in intimate detail the story of the
Chrysler redevelopment.
"In 1979, Lee lacocca invited me
to share in a redevelopment program
that potentially could have been the
largest financial reorganization in the
history of American business. It in
volved consolidating more than $4
billion of loans from nbarly 400 banks
worldwide. Miller said he then
returned to Caracas, Venezuela,
where he had been living, "packed
my bags, and reported to work Mon
day morning in Detroit."
Working seven days a week, 10 to
12 hours a day. tor six months. Miller
began to get the Chrysler Corpora
tion back on its feet. He called a con
ference in New York City to arrange
an agreement with the nearly 400
banks that held outstanding loans
against the corporation. Interest rates
fluctuating between 12 and 20 per
cent within a year's time had stran
gled the company, and some action
had to be taken. After two days, the
conference had not succeeded in
completing an agreement between
Chrysler and the banks. Chrysler was
in a desperate situation, according to

Miller. "It got so had that the local
delicatessen that was catering the af
fair demanded cash up front when
they found out they were serving the
Chrysler Corporation."
Miller, knowing that lack of an
agreement would plunge the company
into bankruptcy, adopted a new strat
egy. He went into the board room and
told the bankers that if no agreement
were reached soon, "half a million
Chrysler workers would lose their
jobs." An agreement was reached less
than two hours later, and the company
was well on its way to recovery.
Since then, Chrysler has enjoyed a
great surge in productivity. Miller
noted that Chrysler made more
money in the last fiscal year than in
all its previous years of operation
combined. In 1980, Chrysler cleared
its inventory five times; in 1984, it
cleared its inventory a total of 14
times. "We have cut our product
defect ratio by one-half in the last
four years," noting that that figure
was a particularly impressive ac
complishment. He credits the turn
around in profitability to progressive
management techniques, including
naming United Auto Workers Presi
dent Douglas Frazier to the Chrysler
board of directors.
However, two long-term problems
still face the company and must be
solved in order for the company to
enjoy long-lasting success:
The trade quotas that currently ex
ist on Japanese auto imports must be
extended in order for the American
automobile companies to be able to
compete against the imports' lower
prices. Miller said. The cost of labor
in United States and export subsidies
that the Japanese government grants

its auto manufacturers are the major
reasons for the lower prices on
Japanese imports, according to Mil
ler. The quotas allow only a certain
number of cars to be imported into
the United States. For the Japanese
auto makers to sell more cars in the
United States, they will have to build
plants in the United States, and hire
American workers to make them.
Also, the value of the Japanese yen
is so high compared to the dollar that
American cars in Japanese
showrooms are at an inherent disad
vantage. Washington, Miller com
plains, has not been too effective at
handling the situation. "The high
flying dollar will come crashing down
when the world realizes we're (the
United States) a banana republic.
We've lost our marbles."
Continued success with the United
Auto Workers Union and the current
boon in car sales are the promising
features in Chrysler's immediate
future. "Undoing 30 years of bad re
lations with the UAW was a primary
goal for us when we started to reor
ganize the corporation." Miller as
sesses his success as a corporate offi
cer by the reports of car sales each
week. "In business school, you
receive your grades each quarter. In
life, I receive my- grades each week. I
give myself an A in real-world
finance."
Miller is a graduate of Stanford and
of Harvard Law School. His com
ments were part of a presentation
titled "Living at the Edge of a Cliff:
The Financial Restructuring of
Chrysler," sponsored by the Stanford
Business School Finance Club.

The Chrysler Corporation faced
certain bankruptcy in 1979, but
through a complete financial reorgan
ization initiated by corporation Presi
dent Lee lacocca, it has regained its
prominence as one of the world's
finest automobile manufacturers, ac
cording to a senior official in the
Chrysler Corporation.
In an address to an overflow crowd
of about 60 people at the Graduate
School of Business, Robert Miller,
executive vice president of finance of
the Chrysler Corporation, described
in intimate detail the story of the
Chrysler redevelopment.
"In 1979, Lee lacocca invited me
to share in a redevelopment program
that potentially could have been the
largest financial reorganization in the
history of American business. It in
volved consolidating more than $4
billion of loans from nbarly 400 banks
worldwide. Miller said he then
returned to Caracas, Venezuela,
where he had been living, "packed
my bags, and reported to work Mon
day morning in Detroit."
Working seven days a week, 10 to
12 hours a day. tor six months. Miller
began to get the Chrysler Corpora
tion back on its feet. He called a con
ference in New York City to arrange
an agreement with the nearly 400
banks that held outstanding loans
against the corporation. Interest rates
fluctuating between 12 and 20 per
cent within a year's time had stran
gled the company, and some action
had to be taken. After two days, the
conference had not succeeded in
completing an agreement between
Chrysler and the banks. Chrysler was
in a desperate situation, according to

Miller. "It got so had that the local
delicatessen that was catering the af
fair demanded cash up front when
they found out they were serving the
Chrysler Corporation."
Miller, knowing that lack of an
agreement would plunge the company
into bankruptcy, adopted a new strat
egy. He went into the board room and
told the bankers that if no agreement
were reached soon, "half a million
Chrysler workers would lose their
jobs." An agreement was reached less
than two hours later, and the company
was well on its way to recovery.
Since then, Chrysler has enjoyed a
great surge in productivity. Miller
noted that Chrysler made more
money in the last fiscal year than in
all its previous years of operation
combined. In 1980, Chrysler cleared
its inventory five times; in 1984, it
cleared its inventory a total of 14
times. "We have cut our product
defect ratio by one-half in the last
four years," noting that that figure
was a particularly impressive ac
complishment. He credits the turn
around in profitability to progressive
management techniques, including
naming United Auto Workers Presi
dent Douglas Frazier to the Chrysler
board of directors.
However, two long-term problems
still face the company and must be
solved in order for the company to
enjoy long-lasting success:
The trade quotas that currently ex
ist on Japanese auto imports must be
extended in order for the American
automobile companies to be able to
compete against the imports' lower
prices. Miller said. The cost of labor
in United States and export subsidies
that the Japanese government grants

its auto manufacturers are the major
reasons for the lower prices on
Japanese imports, according to Mil
ler. The quotas allow only a certain
number of cars to be imported into
the United States. For the Japanese
auto makers to sell more cars in the
United States, they will have to build
plants in the United States, and hire
American workers to make them.
Also, the value of the Japanese yen
is so high compared to the dollar that
American cars in Japanese
showrooms are at an inherent disad
vantage. Washington, Miller com
plains, has not been too effective at
handling the situation. "The high
flying dollar will come crashing down
when the world realizes we're (the
United States) a banana republic.
We've lost our marbles."
