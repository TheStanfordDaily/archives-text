# Tough weekend ahead for wrestlers
## 
### PETER CASTILLO Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford wrestling team has
another tough weekend as it faces
Humboldt State and Fullerton State
tonight at Maples Pavilion at 5 p.m.
The next day the team competes in
the All-California Invitational in San
Francisco, which features 16 teams
vying for the state championship.
"1 expect a victory over Fullerton,
hut Humboldt should be a battle, for
they're strong where we are," Stan
ford Coach Chris Horpel said. "In the
All-Cal Invitational our best placing
ever has been fourth. It is time for the
team to move up. I believe the team is
in the top three within the state."
The top teams in the tournament

will be Fresno State, San Jose State
and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. Fresno
State is ranked in the top 10 in the
nation.
But Horpel noted that Cardinal
wrestlers have beaten some competi
tors who have victories over the Bull
dogs this season. Stanford wrestles
have also had some success against
San Jose State and Cal Poly SLO op
ponents.
Stanford has a 5-3 dual meet
record, including a loss to Cal Poly
SLO Saturday 28-15.
The middle part of the Cardinal
squad will be severely tested tonight.
At 134 pounds, Jeff Bradley beat
Humboldt's Ron Hughes in the Doc
Peterson Invitational Jan. 5, 10-1. In

the same tournament Pete Rogers
(158 pounds) scored a narrow victory
over Jerry Savers of Humboldt 3-2.
There has been a switch in the line
up as Scott Wiggen has dropped to
142 pounds and Jeff Hazard up to
150 pounds. B.G. Porter (118
pounds) is questionable with rib
problems and heavyweight Frank
Lyles still is not 100 percent after a
lengthy sickness.
The Cardinal has had an extremelv

tough January with a hectic schedule
in highly competitive tournaments,
facing some of the toughest wres
tling schools on the West Coast.
The team has shown major prog
ress this season and the amount of
progress has mildly surprised Horpel.
"This is the type of thing one al
ways hopes for at the beginning of the
season, but not really expects. There
has been a lot of momentum from
within the team and I did not consider

this. The team members are supply
ing mutual encouragement and
motivating l l h other to work
harder.
"There is a small price to pay to
make the difference between winning
and losing and the wrestlers are doing
these extra things," Horpel said.
There will be plenty of wrestling
for fans, as on an adjoining mat there
will be another meet taking place.
The first meet features Stanford

versus Humboldt State, and in the
other mat it will be Biola University
against the University of California at
Davis. Around 6:30 p.m., the Card
inal will face Fullerton State and
Humboldt State will take on Biola.
Admission will be charged at
tonight's meet, unlike most. I he cost
is $3 for adults and $1 for non-
Stanford students, while Stanford stu
dents will be admitted free with stu
dent identification.


The Stanford wrestling team will try to turn in its best performance
ever at the All-Cal Invitatio ekend. The Cardinal's previous

Todd Sitrin/Daily
best was fourth, but Coach Chris Horpel feels that the team is good
enough to take at least third this year.
