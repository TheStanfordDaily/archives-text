LOS ANGELES (AP) â€” Pitcher
Dave Stewart of the Texas Rangers
was arrested hy Los Angeles police
for allegedly engaging in lewd con
duct with a man posing as a woman,
police and the team said yesterday.
Stewart, formerly with the Los An
geles Dodgers, was taken into cus
tody early Wednesday after he was
observed by a vice squad officer in ci
vilian clothes engaging in a sex act
with a man posing as a woman "in
public view," Los Angeles Police De
partment spokesman Cmdr. William
Booth said.
The incident occurred in an
eastside downtown Skid Row alley at
1:30 a.m. Wednesday.
The crime is a misdemeanor that
carries a maximum penalty of six
months in jail, a $1,000 fine or both,
but Booth said, "First offenses for
these kinds of misdemeanors get
nowhere near that harsh a sentence."
Stewart was released shortly after
his arrest without being booked but

was issued a citation to appear in
municipal court on Feb. 6.
Booth would only say that the man
arrested was a Dave Stewart, 27, of
Grand Prairie, Texas. Jim Small, as
sistant public relations director of the
Rangers, confirmed it was the Texas
right-hander who was arrested.
Booth said Stewart was unaware
that the prostitute was a man. Ar
rested along with Stewart was Elson
Tyler, 27, of Los Angeles. Booth said
Tyler is also known as Lucille.
Small said that sometime in the
near future. Rangers General
Manager Tom Grieve will sit down
with Stewart to find out what hap
pened. Grieve has no plans to go to
Los Angeles, Small said, adding he
assumed the meeting would be in
Texas.
Stewart, a native of Oakland, had
more recently made his home in the
Los Angeles suburb of Claremont.
Stewart is married and has two
children.
