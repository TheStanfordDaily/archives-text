# Fencers face Air Force, Fullerton in dual meet
## 
### ERIK ESELIUS Staff sportswriter 
Though both the Stanford men's and women's fencing
teams have compiled impressive 9-1 and 8-1 records,
respectively. Cardinal Head Coach Buzz Hurst is still
looking for a little more consistency going into today's
home dual meet against the Air Force Academy and
Fullerton State at Rohle Gym.
" We have to work on our consistency. We' re having too
many problems with our top fencers being up one bout
then down in the next," Hurst said. "We're losing too
many bouts that technically we should win.
"Our major problem is that we're starting too slow. It
takes us one full round of bouts to get our rhythm.
Against Wisconsin, we started off slow. By the time we
gathered speed, it was too late to catch up."
Hurst hopes that the Cardinal will "start hard and fast
against Fullerton State and Air Force, whose men's team is
currently ranked 15th in the National Collegiate Athletic-
Association.
Air Force, who beat the Cardinal men last year 16-1 1.
is a perennially ranked team that has lots of depth, and ac
cording to Hurst, "always fights hard."
"I anticipate a contest in its entirety," Hurst said. Air
Force's foil team is its strongest, though not as difficult as Illi

nois, Wisconsin or San Jose State, he added.
For the Cardinal women, who won rather handily last
year 12-4. Hurst feels confident as well as cautious, fearing
a possible letdown in concentration.
"I don't anticipate trouble as far as our technical ability.
They are so scrappy. If we take them lightly, then that
would cause some concern. Proper attitude â€” we
shouldn't have any concerns."
Hurst feels even better about the Cardinal chances
against Fullerton State, which was hit hard by graduation
last year, losing the NCAA men's foil champion. In the
dual meet last season, the Cardinal men won 18-9 while
the Stanford women recorded a 16-0 shutout.
"Fullerton State is a well-balanced and well-coached
team. They tend to be an upset kind of team," Hurst said.
"If we keep our concentration. I wouldn't expect a close
match."
As has been the case all year, the Cardinal women foil
team will be led by Jennifer Yu. 32-2. and Holly Tailor,
who is 24-9. Andy Goorno. who according to Hurst has
fenced especially well, will lead the men's sabre team with
his 22-3 record. Chris McConnell and Larry Murk are the
top epee fencers with 24-9 and 20-4 records, respectively.
Elliot Cheu heads the foil attack with a 20-7 record.
