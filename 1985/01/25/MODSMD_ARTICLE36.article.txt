### INGRID SEYER Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford women's swim
ming team may he top-ranked na
tionally, hut according to Coach
George Haines, this fact doesn't
give the team any reason to take
this weekend's competition lightly.
The Cardinal will host UCLA at
1 p.m. today and 4th-ranked Uni
versity of Southern California to
morrow at the same time.
"USC will really he giving us
some stiff competition on Satur
day," Haines said. "The Trojans
have strong swimmers in every
area and have extreme depth."
USC, 6-0 in dual meets this
season, has some very strong
swimmers and there will be several
important matchups in tomorrow's
meet. Trojan freshman and Olym
pic gold medal winner Anne Ot
tenbrite (Canada) is expected to
challenge Stanford junior Kathy
Smith in the breaststroke events.
Ottenbrite currently is the fast
est breaststroker in the United
States, leading collegiate swim
mers in the 100- (1 minute, 3.02
seconds) and 200-yard (2:17.54)
events.
USC's Karen Laßerge, a 1980
U.S. Olympic team member, is ex
pected to face off with Stanford's
Patty Gavin in the individual med
ley events, while Sue Habernigg,
the national leader in the 200-yard
freestyle (1:48.93), will be chal
lenging Stanford's Mary Beth
Linzmeier in much of the freestyle
competition.
Today's meet against UCLA is
expected to be slightly easier for
the Cardinal than the USC meet,
although Haines is not taking the
Bruins, 2-1. lightly.

"The UCLA meet should be a
very, very interesting one.
Haines said. "They are much
stronger than they have been in
previous years and have a lot of
experienced swimmers returning
from last year."
The Bruins top swimmers in
clude Julie Williams and Diane
Graner and Swedish Olympians
Suzanne Nillson and Sofia Kraft. Nil-
Ison and Graner both swim
freestyle, Kraft swims the back
stroke and individual medley
events and Graner swims back
stroke.
Although Haines feels positive
about this weekend's meets, he
admits that the Cardinal women's
squad is lacking depth this year.
"The loss of Sue Rapp
(recovering from knee surgery)
and Libby kinkead has really hurt
our depth this year." Haines said.
"The whole team is pulling to
gether but the absence of those
two makes it rough at times. This
weekend will be another big test
for us."
A select group of the Stanford
men's team will be competing this
weekend in the Dallas Morning
News Classic. Dave Bottom, Dave
Louden, Dave Lundberg, Matt
Nance, Jon Denny and U.S.
Olympians Jeff Kostoff, Pablo
Morales and John Moftet will be
competing today and tomorrow at
Southern Methodist University.
The top six teams in the nation are
expected to compete.
Although there were no definite
critera for participating in the
Classic, all of the Cardinal
entrants were chosen because of
their ability to swim or score in at
least four individual events.
