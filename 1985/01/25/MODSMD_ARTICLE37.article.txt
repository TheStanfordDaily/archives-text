gymnastics teams, as both will be
competing in three-way meets
this Saturday. The women will meet
C'hico State and Washington State
University in Chico. while the men
sta\ home to face San Jose State and
Fullerton State.
"We have already met San Jose,"
men's Head Coach Sadao Hamada
said. "And they really won't be much
competition. But Fullerton is going to
be tough. We are about even as far as
this season's meet scores and national
ranking go."
The Cardinal men are currently
ranked 16th in the nation, while
Fullerton State is ranked 15th.
The Stanford men will be compet
ing at lull strength this Saturday.
Freshman Chuck Gerardo is expected
to compete in the all-around and will
be a valuable addition to the overall
team score. Due to an elbow injury.
Gerardo was only able to compete in
two of the six events in the meet
against Japan.
Howevfer, Hamada is concerned
about the development of minor in
juries hindering several of his gym
nasts.
"We should be able to beat Fuller
ton as long as these minor injuries
don't present problems for us"
Hamada said. "In workouts we have
been concentrating on consistency in
hitting routines and have really been
coming along in that respect."
In Chico, the women will face
Chico State, a National Collegiate
Athletic Association Division II
school. Women's Coach Homer Sar
dina predicts it will be a tough com

petition despite the fact that Chico
State is in a lower division that Stan
ford. Chico State has qualified for the
Division II Nationals the past three
years, and finished sixth last year.
"We will be bringing in a different
lineup of all-arounders and some
gymnasts who did not compete in the
last meet," Sardina said. The lineup
will consist of Laura Putnam, Cindy

Boyd, Vicky Warden, Lisa
Weinstock, Nanci Goldsmith and
Robin Close.
"1 feel it is important to get every
one on the team involved in the
lineup because it keeps everyone
working hard and working together,"
Sardina said. "I also believe that
anyone who works out hard should
get to compete."

Leading all-arounders Merilyn
Chapman, Angic Barnes and Alison
McGann will he taking a rest this
weekend.
Sardina reported that the Chico
meet will he a good chance to
strengthen the depth of the team. "By
giving everyone a chance to compete,
substitutions in lineup throughout the
season will he easier," Sardina said.
