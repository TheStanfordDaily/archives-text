## 'Jitterbug Perfume' has the smell of success

"Jitterbug Perfume"

Bantam Books, 342 pp., $15.95
Most serious books about aging
and death make for pretty dry
reading. There wouldn't seem to he
much profit in taking such an un
cheerful subject as the topic for a
comic novel aimed at a wide audi
ence. But while death may be nothing
to joke about, the ways in which we
all avoid confronting the issue ol per
sonal mortality are often hilariously
funny. Woody Allen immediately
comes to mind as an entertainer v\ho
has exploited the comic potential of
necrophobia largely through
scrutinizing his own obsession with
dying. Tom Robbins, author of the
new novel "Jitterbug Perfume." con
ducts his investigation of the same
topic with just as much humor as Al-

len, but with a touch less command
over his material.
The novel's central character, a
Germanic barbarian king called
Alobar, manages to elude death for
almost two millennia through a com
bination of hot baths, Odyssean cun
ning, mystic lore, the power of beets
and a lot of sex. It's not fear of death
that spurs Alobar's quest for immor
tality: His fierce desire not to be
deprived of the joys of living as long
as they're still worth experiencing
sustains Alobar even after his
beloved wife, kudra, denutterwili/os
in 17th-century Paris. Despite per
secution, isolation and a succession of
menial janitorial jobs, Alobar
survives well into the 2()th century,
motivated bv his desire to retrieve

Kudra from the dimension into which
she has mistakenly and prematurely
passed, l.ove keeps A lobar going
even when sexual desire, the staff of
life, fails him; but the random, imper
sonal forces of modern American life,
as represented by legal and scientific
authority, conspire to rob this noble
savage of his innate drive for immor
tality.
Ingeniously interwoven with the
stor\ of Alobar we find three other
continuing sagas of people apparently
unconnected but lor the fact that each
of them is besieged by an onslaught of
beets, which mysteriously appear on
three doorsteps in two continents.
With ease and virtuosity, Robbins
moves the reader from Seattle, home
of the waitress-scientist Priscilla Par
tido, to Paris, peopled by a pair of
odd perfumers, and on to New Or
leans, the fragrant citadel of Madame

Devalier'and her eccentric assistant
V'lu. Robbins does a particularly fine
job of capturing New Orleans by re
vealing the small details that make an
actual place somehow more alive in
fiction, without resorting to the myth
ic inflation John Kennedy Toole
employed in the recent "A Con
federacy of Dunces."
Gradually, the connections be
tween the various narrative threads
become clear, l hey are unified by the
flamboyant figure of Wiggs Dan
nyboy, an ex-Harvard academic dis
missed from hjs post for
experimenting with psychedelic
drugs, who bears more than a passing
resemblance to Timothy Leary. For
merly a prison cellmate of Alobar,
and privy to that near-immortal's

knowledge and history, Dannyboy
distributes the beets, hoping, for
Alobar's sake and for the good of all
humanity, that one of the perfumery
experts will recreate the formula for
k-23, the aromatic jasmine-beet po
tion which precipitated Kudra's inad
vertent departure. This search for the
elixir of life leads Robbins' characters
into some truly bizarre situations, cul
minating in a tumultuous M;irdi Gras
celebration.
What Robbins expects the reader
to extract from all this delightful
madness is difficult to say. Within the
novel, good triumphs over evil, as sci
ence is pressed into the service of
beauty and usual social conventions
are easily overthrown; Robbins thus
inverts what he perceives as the ac
tual conditions of 20th-century life
for satiric effect. But it's not always
clear what he's satirizing: The atti
tudes expressed by the characters that
Robbins seems to endorse often seem
as laughable and ridiculous as any
thing else in the book.
While the implausibility of the
novel may bother some readers, these
periodic, sometimes schizophrenic
shifts in Robbins' tone pose an even
larger problem. Robbins meets with
most success when he contents him
self with playing the storyteller's role.
When he ventures into slapstick, for
example, he often overplays the
humor or relies on too many cliches.
In another vein, the all-too-frequent
attempts at heavy philosophizing, as
filtered through the medium of Wiggs
Dannyboy, are not sufficiently
unified or convincing â€” at his worst,
Robbins sounds like just another
two-bit pop psychologist or philoso
pher, but without a framework for his
borrowed insights. Moreover, "turn
on, tune in, drop out," and the other
bywords from the 1960s that Robbins
implicitly advances, are not only out
of date but more than a little suspect
as viable approaches to living modern
life. Robbins writes a>> an advocate of
much that American culture, for bet
ter or for worse, has repudiated in the
past two decades. His slightly
anachronistic perspective is not in
and of itself a flaw; what one wishes is
that he'd either been better able to
juggle all the grapefruit or that he
hadn't picked up so many in the first
place.
However unsatisfying and uneven
"Jitterbug Perfume" can be at times,
it's also funny, fairly well-written and
ultimately benign. Faulting a novel
which includes "some sadness, some
gaiety and much optimism," as Rob
bins describes it, would do an in
justice to the good-humored spirit in
which it is written. Its successes ade
quately compensate for its failures.
