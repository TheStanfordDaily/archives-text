# Applications hit new high
## Up 11.3 percent over 1984 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Daily staff 
Applicants to Stanford's Class of
1989 will face the stiffest competition
ever, according to 1985 admissions
figures.
As of Jan. 15, the University had
received 17,376 applications for ad
mission — up from 15,614 last year
— according to Dean of Undergradu
ate Admissions Jean Fetter.
"It's quite a dramatic increase,"
Fetter said of the 11.3 percent jump.
Last year's total was also a record
high, 1,092 more than the number of
applicants in 1983.
Provost James Rosse credited good
publicity as a reason for Stanford's
rising popularity. "The world is dis
covering . . . that we really do have a
very strong undergraduate program
here," Rosse said. "We do an in
creasingly good job of getting out the
information that people need to make
good decisions."
Fetter called the task of reading all
the applications "an intellectual and
physical marathon." On Tuesday, ad
missions staff members read appli
cant folders from 8 a.m. until mid
night, she noted.
Hesitant to specify a definite date,
Fetter said the admissions office plans
to mail its thick and thin letters to ap
plicants sometime in early April. She
expects to accept slightly more than
2,400 students, about 14 percent of
the applicants, predicting that 61 to
64 percent of those accepted will
matriculate here in the fall.
Fetter, in her first year as dean of
admissions, said the job has been
"loads of fun" so far and praised the
applicants whose files she has
reviewed. "It's a very impressive pool
of students," she said. "It makes one
humble reading the applications."
Few of the nation's most competi
tive universities report increases in
applications for admission over last
year's totals.
"The count's not done, but it looks
like it will be very close to last year's
total (of 13,237)," a Harvard admis
sions spokesman said of his school's
1985 applicant pool. He noted that as
of yesterday, the Harvard admissions

office had received about l()() fewer
applications than at the same time
last year.
Yale admissions officers predicted
a total slightly lower than last year's
all-time high of 12,035."1 don't think
it'll hit that number this year," a
spokesman there said. "That was an
all-time high, though. We didn't ex
pect to reach it again."
An official from the University of
California at Berkeley said the uni
versity's November priority enroll
ment total indicates a slight decrease
in applicants. This year's total for
priority enrollment at Berkeley was
11,1 29, down from 11.313 last year.
A Princeton admissions spokesman
said he expects the number of appli-

cations there roughly to equal last
year's total of 12,718.
Admissions officials at Tufts and
Wesleyan also said they expected
about the same numbers as last year.
Brown admissions boasted of re
ceiving about 13,600 total applica
tions this year, J.OOO more than in
1984. Last year, Brown was the only
Ivy League school to suffer a drop
(4.6 percent) in its applicant total.
The drop came after a decade of
steady increase there.
The University of Pennsylvania
said the 12,099 applications it had
received as of Jan. 17 constituted*6oo
more than the total there last year on
the same date.
