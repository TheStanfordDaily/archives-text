"kerouac and Friends"
Fdited by Fred McDarrah
Morrow, 338 pp., $17.95
Vanity Fair has an article on the
Beat Generation in this month's
issue. There's some good gossip
about William Burroughs. There's a
large fuzzy photograph of Gregory
Corso and Allen Ginsberg bare
naked. And there's one of Jack
kerouac, author of "On the Road,"
looking ornery, fat and blitzed.
I'm always interested in what
William Burroughs has to say. no
matter how paranoid. Every year or
so the author of "Naked Lunch"

Every year or so the author of "Naked
Lunch' writes a sick letter to The
Village Voice, warning its readers to
buy as much ammunition as possible.

writes a sick letter to The Village
Voice, warning its readers to buy as
much ammunition as possible — but
the guy works, and book after book
shows a bewilderinglv fertile variety
of fictional devices and range of ma
terial. The oldest member of the Beat
Generation is impossible to
pigeonhole.
The Corso-Ginsberg photograph?
Frankly, their bodies were kind of
cuddly back in the late 19505, which
was when the photo was taken.
Thank goodness for that, because not
even Annie Leibovitz could frame a
suitable nude of those guys today.
Corso is a toothless and spent al
coholic who hasn't written an engag
ing poem in 15 years. Ginsberg looks
like a queer, old scholar — which he
is. (Don't think I'm being harsh.
These guys agree with me.)

In a feeble attempt to become hip.
the magazine published a dopey
Ginsberg poem — on Caspar
Weinberger's defense budget.
And Kerouac? He dead, so
Vanity Fair couldn't get any of his
more recent work.
What interests me about this maga
zine article is its assertion, which has
become routine of late, that the chief
creation of the writers of the Beat
Generation was not their books, but
the years in which the\ wrote them,
say about 1948-1965. To be sure, the
time must have seemed magical, but
no matter how much I have loved
their books, this endless marketing of

the two-decade-old aroma of
bohemia is pathetic.
A couple of years ago I reviewed a
biography of Jack Kerouac in these
pages and said that the best thing
about it was its exhaustiveness. I
figured that, since nothing else could
possibly be said about the author's
too-often lurid or silly life, critical at
tention would now be directed at his
wonderful books — "Tristessa,"
"Mexico City Blues," "Visions of
Cody" and "Doctor Sax." My hope
that such biographical nostalgia
would wane was futile, however.
Local poet Tom Clark, who bombed
the Kerouac biography in the "San
Francisco Chronicle," in strikingly
bad faith published his own
biography a few months ago.
Now there is another book out,
called "Kerouac and Friends," edited

by Village Voice photographer Fred
McDarrah. Surprisingly, this is an ex
cellent, useful book — despite its
desultory yearnings for days gone by.
McDarrah has combined his huge
collection of photographs of virtually
every single above- or underground
literary figure of the Beat era at the
dozens of cafes, readings and parties
of Greenwich Village. Despite the
fact that his "Rent-a-Beatnik"
venture in 1960 did little to guarantee
that his favorite writers would receive
serious examination from the New
ork cultural establishment, the arti
cles that McDarrah has assembled
here present an admirably full picture
of the public's reception of the artists,
writers and hangers-on of that time.
In hiN freewheeling approach to his
subject. McDarrah actually reprints
several articles that are dismissive of
or bellicose toward the likes of
kerouac, Ginsberg and Ferlinghetti
We get the sniveling John Ciardi's
"Epitaph for the Dead Beats" 1 and
Norman Podhoretz' insanely vicious
"Where is the Beat Generation
Going?" Alongside them are kinder
ones, such as kenneth Rexroth's just
about-hip "Jazz and Poetry" and Art
Buchwald's "The Upbeat Beatnik."
Various hard-to-locate magazine ar
ticles by kerouac himself can also be
found here.
The Mad Magazine parody of a
Beatnik magazine also appears, so we
get to meet the likes of Gerald Zenn,
"Poet and Push-Cart Peddler," and
Sam Osszefogva, who writes a
column on "Brand New Beard
Styles." For people who want to use
this book as a classroom text — for
which, weirdly enough, it could be
ideal — the book's long section of bi
ographical sketches and its exhaustive
bibliography are invaluable.
The subtitle to this volume is "A
Beat Generation Album." The
photographs are all in black-and
white — which is a good thing, be
cause black-and-white photography
makes its subjects look as though
they lived in "another time," i.e., not
in this one, which is the moral of (at
least part of) the story.

Voice, warning its readers to buy as
much ammunition as possible — but
the guy works, and book after book
shows a bewilderinglv fertile variety
of fictional devices and range of ma

Generation is impossible to
pigeonhole.
The Corso-Ginsberg photograph?
Frankly, their bodies were kind of
cuddly back in the late 19505, which
was when the photo was taken.
Thank goodness for that, because not
even Annie Leibovitz could frame a
suitable nude of those guys today.
Corso is a toothless and spent al
coholic who hasn't written an engag
ing poem in 15 years. Ginsberg looks
like a queer, old scholar — which he
is. (Don't think I'm being harsh.
These guys agree with me.)

In a feeble attempt to become hip.
the magazine published a dopey
Ginsberg poem — on Caspar
Weinberger's defense budget.
And Kerouac? He dead, so
Vanity Fair couldn't get any of his
more recent work.
What interests me about this maga
zine article is its assertion, which has
become routine of late, that the chief
creation of the writers of the Beat
Generation was not their books, but
the years in which the\ wrote them,
say about 1948-1965. To be sure, the
time must have seemed magical, but
no matter how much I have loved
their books, this endless marketing of

the two-decade-old aroma of
bohemia is pathetic.
A couple of years ago I reviewed a
biography of Jack Kerouac in these
pages and said that the best thing
about it was its exhaustiveness. I
figured that, since nothing else could
possibly be said about the author's
too-often lurid or silly life, critical at
tention would now be directed at his
wonderful books — "Tristessa,"
"Mexico City Blues," "Visions of
Cody" and "Doctor Sax." My hope
that such biographical nostalgia
would wane was futile, however.
Local poet Tom Clark, who bombed
the Kerouac biography in the "San
Francisco Chronicle," in strikingly
bad faith published his own
biography a few months ago.
Now there is another book out,
called "Kerouac and Friends," edited

by Village Voice photographer Fred
McDarrah. Surprisingly, this is an ex
cellent, useful book — despite its
desultory yearnings for days gone by.
McDarrah has combined his huge
collection of photographs of virtually
every single above- or underground
literary figure of the Beat era at the
dozens of cafes, readings and parties
of Greenwich Village. Despite the
fact that his "Rent-a-Beatnik"
venture in 1960 did little to guarantee
that his favorite writers would receive
serious examination from the New
ork cultural establishment, the arti
cles that McDarrah has assembled
here present an admirably full picture
of the public's reception of the artists,
writers and hangers-on of that time.
In hiN freewheeling approach to his
subject. McDarrah actually reprints
several articles that are dismissive of
or bellicose toward the likes of
kerouac, Ginsberg and Ferlinghetti
We get the sniveling John Ciardi's
"Epitaph for the Dead Beats" 1 and
Norman Podhoretz' insanely vicious
"Where is the Beat Generation
Going?" Alongside them are kinder
ones, such as kenneth Rexroth's just
about-hip "Jazz and Poetry" and Art
Buchwald's "The Upbeat Beatnik."
Various hard-to-locate magazine ar
ticles by kerouac himself can also be
found here.
The Mad Magazine parody of a
Beatnik magazine also appears, so we
get to meet the likes of Gerald Zenn,
"Poet and Push-Cart Peddler," and
Sam Osszefogva, who writes a
column on "Brand New Beard
Styles." For people who want to use
this book as a classroom text — for
which, weirdly enough, it could be
ideal — the book's long section of bi
ographical sketches and its exhaustive
bibliography are invaluable.
The subtitle to this volume is "A
Beat Generation Album." The
photographs are all in black-and
white — which is a good thing, be
cause black-and-white photography
makes its subjects look as though
they lived in "another time," i.e., not
in this one, which is the moral of (at
least part of) the story.

"kerouac and Friends"
Fdited by Fred McDarrah
Morrow, 338 pp., $17.95
Vanity Fair has an article on the
Beat Generation in this month's
issue. There's some good gossip
about William Burroughs. There's a
large fuzzy photograph of Gregory
Corso and Allen Ginsberg bare
naked. And there's one of Jack
kerouac, author of "On the Road,"
looking ornery, fat and blitzed.
