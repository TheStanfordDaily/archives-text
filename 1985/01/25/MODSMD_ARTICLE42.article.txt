The Wind (1928)
Castro, San Francisco
One of the silent masterworks, forgot
ten for many years and only recently ac
corded the praise it deserves. Victor
Sjostrom, the Swedish emigre Lillian
Gish had hand-picked to direct her in
the (magnificent) film version of "The
Scarlet Letter" — and, incidentally, the
old man in Bergman's " Wild Straw
berries" — made this film about a young
woman who ventures out into the Mid
west, to an unhappy marriage and the
unwelcome advances of a rake. Lillian
Gish's performance is a startlingly
modern study of neurosis produced by
environment. Lars Hanson and Mon
tagu Love co-star.
Plays today with "Camille."
Stroszek (1977)
Cubberley Auditorium
The first half of this curious Werner
Herzog film is a variation on "Porgy and
Bess": Bruno (Bruno S.) is a street
musician who offers shelter to Eva (Eva
Mattes), a prostitute, after her pimp
lover drives her away, but in this version
it's Porgy who takes Bess to New York
— or rather, Wisconsin, where their
landlord, Scheitz (Clemens Scheitz), has
promised Eva a waitressing job. Bruno
S., who made this movie after starring in
Herzog's "Mystery of Kaspar Hauser,"
comes across like a slightly drunken,
slightly unbalanced hanger-on in a local
bar might — he reads his lines stiltedly
and doesn't focus his eyes on the people
he speaks to — but he has a peculiar
charm; and plump, overripe Eva Mattes
has an appealing animal sensuousness.
Once they get to America, though, Her
zog shifts gears: He seems to want to
make a movie about the alienation of
immigrants, but he's chosen characters
who are so remote from the mainstream
of European-American lifestyles that
they're alienated by definition.
Plays Tuesday evening at 8.
Star Trek III: The Search for Spock
(1984)
Memorial Auditorium
This picture squeaks by for the first
half hour on the good will "Star Trek II:
The Wrath of Khan" built up, but that
fades when you realize that no one with
either wit or taste exerted any control

over the project. Leonard Nimoy offers
his typical out-of-whack performance,
only this time from the director's chair:
If you tried to recount the story, it would
make more sense than it does while
you're watching it, because you would
naturally supply the dramatic accents
Nimoy leaves off. Harve Bennett's script
sets up one big scene after another, but
you get the feeling Nimoy hasn't
grasped the logic or the llow of the story
— that he's still waiting for someone to
walk him through it. About two-thirds
of the way through, when the Planet
Genesis (where Spock's body is buried)
disintegrates, you begin to enjoy the
dumb picture for its colossal ineptitude.
With William Shatner and all the
regulars, as well as Dame Judith Ander
son as the Vulcan high priestess; it's
amazing to hear that richly cadenced
voice wrapped around artificial lan
guage that might have clunked happily
through any Maria Montez film. Plays
Sunday evening at 7 and 9:30.
Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949)
Festival. Palo Alto
This ingenious but unstressed black
comedy is one of the earliest — and best
— of the golden age of English comic
films. Dennis Price plays a young man of
insurmountable ambition who murders
his way through a whole family so that
he can inherit a fortune. The kicker is
that the entire famly D'Ascoigne is im
personated by one man — Alec Guin
ness, whose performance seems to grow
better and more richly enjoyable with
each of his eight incarnations. (His
make-up is terrific, too.) Robert Hamer
did the witty direction and co-authored
the script, with John Dighton, and the
impeccable cast features Joan Green
wood (of the honeyed voice), Valerie
Hobson, Miles Malleson and Arthur
Lowe.
Plays through Wednesday with "The
Man in the White Suit."

Touch of Evil (1958)
Cedar, San Francisco
Nearly two decades after "Citizen
Kane," Orson Welles made this breath
taking baroque thriller based on a Whit
Masterson story. He and his photog
rapher, Russell Metty, shot the tilm in
Venice. Calif, but it seems to have been
made in hell, and no one who has seen it
can drive through Venice without think
ing he is in hell. The peculiarly effective
cast includes Welles himself, Marlene
Dietrich, Charlton Heston, Akim
Tamiroff, Joseph Cotten, Zsa Zsa
Gabor, Mercedes McCambridge and
Janet Leigh, who has an extremely un
pleasant pre-"Psycho" encounter in a
motel.
Plays Sunday and Monday with " I he
Burglar"
Scarlet Street (1946)
Cedar, San Francisco
Fritz Lang's American remake of
Renoir's "La Chienne," with Edward G.
Robinson as the henpecked painter who
falls in love with a tart (Joan Bennett)
and gets taken by her and her glib,
sneaky boy friend (Dan Duryea). The
auteur critics have found something to
praise in all of Lang's Hollywood
pictures, but this one is pretty much un
redeemed; it may contain Robinson's
least appealing performance. Dudley
Nichols wrote the script.
Plays Tuesday through Thursday with
"The Woman in the Window."
Home of the Brave (1949)
Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley
Arthur Laurents' 194H play dealt with
anti-semitism in the army during World
War II; by the time it got to Hollywood,
the Jewish soldier stricken with psycho
logical paralysis had become a black
man, and the dialogue had been con
siderably (and dismayingly) cleaned up.
The film is gripping, despite the atro
cious music (by Dimitri Tiomkin) and

the tidy, sermonizing ending. The direc
tor. Mark Robson. and the fresh young
cast give a persuasive account of men
living together under extreme duress.
And the script (adapted by Carl
Foreman) contains some unusual com
plexities and surprise touches, like the
decent, anxious young major (Douglas
Dick) who doesn't want a black man
along on the climactic mission. James
Fdwards plays Moss, the black soldier;
his performance is erratic. But Lloyd
Bridges, Steve Brodie and Frank
Love joy (in the best written role) do
fine, naturalistic work, and Jetl Corey
makes a striking impression as the army
psychiatrist (though he's stuck deliver
ing the curtain speech). Photographed
by Robert de Grasse.
Plays Monday with "The New Klan
and "Champion."
D.O. A. (1949)
Cedar, San Francisco
This thriller, directed by the cele
brated photographer Rudolph Mate,
begins with Edmond O'Brien staggering
into a police station to report his own
murder: He's been given a slow-acting
"luminous poison." The rest of the
movie is a flashback explaining how he
found out he had been poisoned and
how he located his murderer. Actually,
this plot synopsis makes the film sound
better than it is — the script (by Russell
Rouse and Clarence Greene) provides
only the bare minimum, and Mate
doesn't know how to make its tawdri
ness work to the picture's advantage. He
doesn't seem to know much about
directing actors, either: Except for Lut
her Adler as a hood with a gypsy accent,
the cast is fairly colorless. (Pamela Brit
ton, William Ching, Beverly Campbell
and Neville Brand, who overacts
amateurishly, are in it.) There are some
neat on-location shots of the San Fran
cisco of the late 19405, though.
Plays today and tomorrow with
"Detour."

Winterset (1936)
Pacific Film Archive. Berkeley
Written in 1935. Maxwell Anderson's
play was considered by many highly in
telligent people to he the apex of Amer
ican dramatic literature up to that time
because of its unprecedented mixture of
recent political history (the Sacco-
Vanzetti case), an American genre (the
gangster melodrama) and (what Ander
son intended to be) high tragic verse —
a mixture that seems bizarre and even
ludicrous today. (The play is never
revived.) The RKO film version,
adapted by Anthony Veiller and di
rected by Alfred Santell, is badly staged
and contains a kind of prologue to
dispose of most of the expository ma
terial. but it's probably a fairly accurate
depiction of what theater-goers ap
plauded in the Broadway production.
Eduardo Ciannelli, Margo. Paul Guil
foyle, John Carradine. Edward Ellis,
Mischa Auer and others chew the fake
looking scenery, but the remarkable
young Burgess Meredith, recreating the
stage role that made him a star, manages
to act with passion yet without affecta
tion.
Plays Sunday with "'The Animal
Kingdom."
The Return of Martin Guerre
(1983)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Jean de Coras, one of the justices in
the case, originally set down this
resonant tale of the man who left his
home in mid-16th-century France to
fight in the wars, returned to general
rejoicing eight years later, and then was
accused of impersonating the real
prodigal. Daniel Vigne's film version,
with a script by Vigne and Jean-Claude
Carriere, concentrates on making the
man claiming to be Martin Guerre as at
tractive as possible, and by casting the
most appealing (and most sen
suous and instinctual) of
French actors, Gerard

Depardieu. in the title role. Vigne has
ensured that the narrative mechanism
will indeed work. It's a very ordinary
movie, though. With Nathalie Bave as
Martin's wife. Bertrande.
Plavs Wednesday at K.
Strangers on a I rain (1951)
New Varsity. Palo Alto
Alfred Hitchcock's movie has a tan
talizingly clever premise: on a train. Guy
(Farley Granger) meets Bruno (Robert
Walker), who promises to eliminate
Guy's troublesome wife if. in return,
Guy will kill Bruno's father. (Bruno
calls this strategy "criss-cross mur
ders.") Working from Patricia
Highsmith's novel. Raymond Chandler
and Czenzi Ormonde provided
Hitchcock with a witty, beautifully cal
culated screenplay, and Robert
Walker's malignantly charming Bruno is
among the two or three best perfor
mances Hitchcock evtjr directed. Its a
marvelous movie, assembled with true
mastery. Hitchcock puts the two most
suspenseful sequences back to back: the
tennis match and the merry-go-round
climax. With Ruth Roman. Leo G. Car
roll. Patricia Hitchcock. Marion Lome.
Howard St. John and Laura Elliott.
Plays Tuesday and Wednesday with
"North by Northwest."
