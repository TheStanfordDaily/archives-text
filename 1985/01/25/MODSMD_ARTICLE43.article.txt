## 
### 
Norman Parlee, professor emeritus
of extractive metallurgy in the De
partment of Mineral Engineering,
died Tuesday at his Los
Altos Hills home following a lengthy
illness. He was 69 years old.
Parlee joined the Stanford faculty
in 1962, teaching fundamentals of
metallurgy and physical chemistry of
metals, after 10 years at Purdue. He
retired in 1982. Parlee wrote
more than 70 articles and 50 indus
trial reports and held at least eight
patents.
In 1969 he co-developed with
Robert Anderson a high-temperature
metallurgical process by which nu
clear "garbage" could be compacted
and recycled with minimum environ
mental impact. The tin nitride process
results in a 30-fold reduction of nu
clear waste volume, compared to con
ventional waste-disposal methods.
Parlee earned his bachelor's degree
in chemistry at Dalhousie University
in 1935 and a master's degree there
in physical chemistry in 1937. He
earned his doctorate at McGill Uni
versity in 1939.
Parlee is survived by his wife,
Eileen, of Los Altos Hills; daughter,
Sherie Clay, of Portland, Ore.; son,

Alan, of Los Angeles; sister, Anna
Armstrong, of Nova Scotia; and three
grandchildren.
Services will be held at 2 p.m.
today, at Union Presbyterian Church,
858 University Ave., Los Altos.
The family prefers donations to the
Hospice South Bay Home Help
Agency, 20863 Stevens Creek Blvd.,
Cupertino, CA 95014.
