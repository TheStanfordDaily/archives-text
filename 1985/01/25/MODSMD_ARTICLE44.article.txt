# Chaparral suspects Daily in heinous hammer heist

### TRACEY BANKS 
A silver-plated sledge hammer, the symbol of the
Chaparral's Hammer and Coffin Society, has been stolen
from its model coffin in the magazine's office, according
to Chaparral staff members.
The handle of the full-sized hammer is engraved with
the names of all the members of the society since 1906.
The names include members of the Chaparral staff who
have served the magazine for at least one year.
Because it has been with the Chappie since the turn of
the century, the hammer has tremendous sentimental
value, staffers there said. It is, as former Chaparral Editor
Ron Fernandez puts it, "a symbol of continuity" between
past and current staffs.
The hammer's absence was first noticed last Tuesday,
Chaparral Business Manager Karen Easterbrook said.
Because other more obvious valuables were left un
touched and Daily staff members reacted with little
surprise when the theft was reported, the Chappie staff
believes the hammer was taken by a Daily staff member as

part of the traditional rivalry between the two publica
tions. Easterbrook said.
But Daily Editor Shirish Date said he had no knowl
edge of the hammer's whereabouts. "It's a shame that it
(the hammer) is missing." he said.
On Tuesday a typewritten note was found in the
Chaparral office, saying: "We have the hammer, expect
[sic] contact tomorrow, or the day after, we're not who
you think i am." The note was signed, "the corporation.
The note has caused a bit of confusion. Chappie staffers
said. They said they still suspect The Daily played a role in
the theft. Hammer and Coffin members said they hope
the note is an indicaton that the hammer will be returned
in the near future.
Despite pressure from alumni, the Chaparral is reluc
tant to involve the police. Because the hammer is
reportedly valued at more than $600. the culprit could be
charged with grand theft, according to Stanford Police."
However, Fernandez said he sees no alternative to report
ing the theft if the hammer does not surface within a few
days.
