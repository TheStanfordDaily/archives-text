# Faith and science reconciled

Religious faith and scientific reason in combination
may provide the most satisfying picture of the universe,
said a Harvard historian of science who spoke to an
overflow crowd in Terman Auditorium yesterday.
Owen Gingerich, an astrophysicist at the Smith
sonian Observatory in Cambridge. MaÂ»s., said that sci
ence asks the question "How?" while the Bible asks
the question "Who?" and that the two questions repre
sent different world views that are ultimately unsatisfy
ing when considered individually.
Because science has a mechanistic orientation, it is
unable to say anything about the designer, while the
Bible, with its answer of "God did it," cloaks our knowl
edge with a simplistic solution, according to Gingerich.
"The scientific picture of the universe is far more
satisfying with the inclusion of a supernatural desig
ner." he said.
Gingerich gave a panoramic view of scientific in
quiry into the origins and nature of the universe,
touching on Galileo and the heliocentric model of the
universe, the Big Bang theory and the expanding uni
verse theory.
Likening science to "a beautiful tapestry," he called
attention to "the hypothetical structures of science

[which are] knit together into a coherent picture" of
the universe and its natural laws.
Science has a "provisional nature" and is "always
subject to question and doubt." said Gingerich.
"Science is not ultimate truth."
Science is unable to provide proof in support of its
major theories, such as the movement of the earth. It
can only arrive at increasingly higher levels of the
probability of the theory's validity, he said.
As a scientist, Gingerich said he rejects the literal in
terpretation of the Biblical creation story and believes
in the coherent picture presented by science to explain
the universe. He said he rejects creationism and all "ad
hoc explanations that simply do not fit into the
coherency of science," he said.
But Gingerich. a Christian, said he has faith in the
presence of God, and is "personally persuaded that the
universe as revealed by science is impossible without a
supernatural designer."
"The message of Genesis 1 is to show God's im
mense creative power and that He placed a divine cre
ative spark in man as well," he said. The most impor
tant sentence in the chapter, he said, is "God created
man in his own image." because it conveys the message
that "there is within each of us. man and woman, a
touch of infinity."
