Reagan asserts Iran-Nicaragua link
WASHINGTON — President Reagan, pushing for renewed U.S. sup
port of Nicaraguan rebels, claimed yesterday that Iran has joined other
radical forces supporting Nicaragua's leftist government in a campaign
of armed subversion in Central America.
In a speech to legislators from Western Hemisphere countries,
Reagan said. "A new danger we see in Central America is the support
being given to the Sandinistas by Col. (Moammar) Khadafy's Libya, the
PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization) and most recently, the Ayatol
lah Khomeini's Iran."
He said Nicaragua's ruling Sandinistas "have been attacking their
neighbors through armed subversion since 1979," and added. "The sub
version we are talking about violates international law."
"Countering this by supporting Nicaraguan freedom fighters is essen
tially acting in self-defense," the president said, using his preferred term
for the so-called "contras" seeking the overthrow of the Sandinista
regime.
Congress suspended aid to the Nicaraguan rebels last year, and Sen.
Richard Lugar (R-lnd.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, said Wednesday that he suspects its resumption "is not a
viable proposition."
White House spokesman Larry Speakes, asked about Lugar's remark,
said, "We intend to ask for full funding for the entire Central American
program; we will just have to see how the legislative ballgame goes."
"We think we have a strong case to present to the American people
and the president will do so, today being an example." Speakes said.
But after meeting yesterday with Secretary of State George Shultz,
Lugar repeated his view that Senate support no longer exists for the ad
ministration's $14 million covert-aid request.
Lugar said Shultz is taking the initiative on the search for a new way to
compel Nicaragua to enter serious negotiations. At the moment, with
the covert-aid program collapsing, "they see no need to talk," he said.
Shuttle launched with spy satellite
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — The space shuttle Discovery rode into
orbit yesterday, bearing a $300 million secret military spy satellite built
to eavesdrop on the Soviet Union from the heavens.
The reusable spaceship, carrying five military astronauts on its third
flight, rose majestically off launch pad 39A at 2:50 p.m. PST, piercing a
nearly cloudless sky.
Although the satellite is reportedly capable of tracking Soviet missile
tests and listening in on military and diplomatic communications, details
of the mission to launch it are shrouded in their own set of clouds.
In an attempt to thwart efforts by the Soviet Union to determine the
shuttle's specific goal. Pentagon and National Aeronautics and Space
Administration officials refused to give any details about the cargo, or
specifics about the flight.
Officials fear that such information could make it easier for the Soviet
Union to adjust its own flow of intelligence data to make it less suscepti
ble to the United States' interception in the skies.
So, although NASA officials said there were no abnormalities to the
liftoff, they refused to say whether it occurred precisely on schedule.
"If that [were] known, that would be an indication for the Soviet
Union about the mission and the type of payload we have boosted," said
Air Force Lt. Col. John Booth. "It could tell them who, what, when,
where and why."
The space agency is operating under orders from its Air Force custom
ers. who are paying $31.2 million of the mission's approximately $100
million price tag.
Dole bleak about tax reform
WASHINGTON — Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-Kan.)
said yesterday there is only a scant possibility that tax reform legislation
will be approved by the Senate this year, insisting that Congress instead
must concentrate its efforts on deficit reduction.
At a breakfast speech to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Dole was
wholly bleak on the prospects for tax simplification. But several houa.
later he backtracked on his pessimistic comments, declaring tax reform Is
"very much alive" and quipping that he had spoken "before I had my
coffee this morning."
Nevertheless, Dole made it clear throughout the day that efforts to
achieve a spending freeze to reduce the federal budget deficit should be
the overriding mission on Capitol Hill. "We're going to attack spending
first," he vowed.
After his morning speech, Dole told reporters, "I'm not trying to
shoot it (tax reform) down — I'm just trying to be realistic and can
did. ... I don't think we'll see it this year."
His statements contradicted the claim Wednesday by Treasury
Secretary-designate James Baker 111 that deficit reduction and tax
reform will receive "equal priority" from the Reagan administration.
Nazi released despite protests
ROME — A former Nazi SS major serving a reduced life sentence as
the sole war criminal in a remote Norman fortress south of Rome was
freed yesterday and flown to Austria over the protests of villagers who
said that he killed 1,830 of their kinsmen and fellow citizens.
Former SS Guard Maj. Walter Reder, who is suffering from what his
priest called "not just one sickness but several," was released without
prior announcement, flown directly to his native Austria and taken to an
Austrian military hospital at his request.
Politicial sources in Rome said the "humanitarian" release was ap
proved by the government of Prime Minister Bettino Craxi as a gesture
of conciliation to the Austrians, with whom Italy has had long standing
territorial differences over the ethnically Austrian South Tyrol. Austria
had repeatedly sought Reder's release on grounds of illness.
But in the village of Marzabotto, south of Bologna, where Reder's
16th battalion of the Reichsfuhrer SS 16th Panzer Grenedier Division
was accused of a 1944 massacre, there were immediate protests.
"The sorrow caused to the relatives of the victims has been ignored,"
complained Socialist Deputy Mayor Romano Stefanelli, who said that
14 members of his family died in the wartime reprisal killings. "The
people here can never pardon him because they would have to do so in
the name of the dead."
Dante Cruicci, the Communist mayor who has twice conducted village
referendums that overwhelmingly rejected the idea of clemency for
Reder. said, "What saddens us is that the decision to free him was made
without taking into account the victims and families of the victims."
Reder was sentenced to life imprisonment by an Italian military court
in 1951 for murders of civilian men. women and children, including in
fants in raids on several villages in the area south of Bologna conducted
in reprisals for partisan attacks against German military units.
State Senate honors Stanford, USC
SACRAMENTO — The state Senate adopted resolutions yesterday
honoring Ted Tollner. football coach at the University of Southern Cali
fornia. and the 100 th anniversary of the founding of Stanford Univer
sity.
The Tollner resolution took only a few minutes, including his brief
"thank you" remarks from the podium. He was also honored in the As
sembly.
The Stanford resolution took a lot longer because it was the first mea
sure taken up on the Senate floor by Sen. Becky Morgan (R-Los Altos).
It's a tradition to haze a new senator by asking a lot of ridiculous ques
tions at the first opportunity.
Sen. Morgan, a former Santa Clara County supervisor, was un
abashed. When Sen. Lerov Greene (D-Sacramento) asked if her con
stituents had sent her to Sacramento to sponsor such trivia, she replied:
"Please be assured this is only the beginning."
