# Final verdict goes to Time
## 
### 
NEW YORK — Former Israeli
Defense Minister Ariel Sharon lost
his two-year, $50 million libel suit
against Time magazine yesterday
when a jury found insufficent
evidence to prove Time acted with
malice in publishing an inaccurate
1983 cover story about Sharon's role
in the massacre of Palestinians in
West Beirut.
In the first two parts of its verdict
last week, the panel of four women
and two men ruled that a paragraph
in the story was both defamatory and
erroneous, prompting Sharon to
claim victory in his political objective
for bringing the suit — proving Time
wrong.
Legally, however, the case ended in
Time's favor on the 11th day of

deliberations when jury foreman R.
Peter Zug read aloud the jury's fin
ding that Sharon had failed to prove
that anyone at Time who was
"responsible for either reporting,
writing, editing or publishing" the
story knew that it "was false or had
serious doubts as to its truth."
Sharon, dressed as ever in a grey
pinstripe suit, betrayed no emotion
when the verdict was read but quickly
vanished with his wife, Lili, and se
curity agents into his private chamber
behind courtroom 1 10 of the U.S.
District Courthouse here, the same
courtroom where the trials of the
Rosenbergs, Alger Hiss and Nixon
aide Maurice Stans were held.
Although the jury found in Time's
favor, it made an extraordinary re

quest to couple its verdict with an ad
monition of the victor:
"We find that certain Time
employees, particularly correspon
dent David Halevy (who was chiefly
responsible for the one paragraph
disputed in the suit), acted
negligently and carelessly in reporting
and verifying the information which
ultimately found its way into the pub
lished paragraph of interest in this
case."
Following the verdict, lime issued
a statement saying that "this libel suit
is over, and Time has won it.
But outside the courtroom lime
managing editor Ray Cave admitted
to reporters that the case has done
Time damage. "There is no doubt in
my mind that in the very short term

the case "will raise questions in the
public's mind about our practices and
about how careful we are." Those
questions will fade. Cave predicted,
when readers recall Time's
longstanding record. "In the long
term, I think the adverse effects will
be neglible."
Sharon, however, insisted that he
was satisfied with the result despite
his legal defeat.
"We came to this country to prove
that Time lied, and we managed to
prove that Time lied, and we
managed to prove that there was a
clear defamation."
