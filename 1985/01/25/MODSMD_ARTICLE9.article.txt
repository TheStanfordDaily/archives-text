# Carbide knew of possible leak

WASHINGTON â€” Union Carbide Corp. knew
of the possibility of a "runaway reaction - ' of methyl
isocyanate at its pesticide plant in West Virginia
less than three months before at least 2,000 people
were killed by a massive leak of the chemical from
its sister plant in Bhopal, India, according to an in
ternal memo released yesterday.
The memo, prepared by a Union Carbide safety
inspection team and received by the manager of the
Institute, W. Va., plant Sept. 19, warned of two
"major" concerns about toxic chemicals at the
facility.
The team cited "the possibility of a runaway re
action in the MIC unit storage tanks" and said cor
porate rules required a corrective "action plan" to
be developed within 60 days.
The safety team concluded that "a real potential
for a serious incident exists" at the MIC unit and
questioned whether response to one would be
"timely or effective enough to prevent catastrophic
failure of the (MIC storage) tank."
But the team added that it did not consider the

problems "imminent hazards requiring immediate
correction."
On Dec. 3, an estimated 45 tons of MIC escaped
from the Bhopal facility, which Union Carbide offi
cials have said has the same safety and operating
procedures as the West Virginia plant.
After the Bhopal tragedy. Union Carbide closed
the India plant and the MIC-producing portion of
its Institute facility. Yesterday, the company began
neutralizing 3,000 pounds of the gas still remaining
in Institute.
The internal document was released by Rep.
Henry Waxman (D-Los Angeles), who said he did
not know whether corrective action was taken in
West Virginia or whether the team's findings were
even made known to plant officials in Bhopal.
"They're warning about the exact same thing
that happened in Bhopal," Waxman told a news
conference. "It looks like there's a possibility
Bhopal could have been avoided. If nothing was
done, 1 find this a very distressing situation."
There was no immediate word from Union

Carbide about what action may have been taken to
address the memo's concerns. Dick Henderson, a
spokesman at the Institute plant, said the safety
team plays "a devil's advocate. I hey take the
worst-case scenario."
The safety memo surfaced a day after the Envi
ronmental Protection Agency released a report
saying that 28 MIC spills had occurred since 1%()
at Institute, which even chemical industry critics
describe as one of the best-operated U.S. plants.
Waxman, a frequent EPA critic who chairs the
House Energy and Commerce Committee's health
and environment subcommittee, said such spills are
only part of the problem in West Virginia.
He said his staff found Union Carbide reports in
state files showing that 12 pounds of MIC are
routinely released into the air each hour in the
manufacture of the deadly chemical.
