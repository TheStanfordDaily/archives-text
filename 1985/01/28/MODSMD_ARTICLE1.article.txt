(In the first of a two-part series, The Daily hikes a look at
Stanford research into the causes and treatment of acquired
immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Tomorrow: How
people deal with AIDS.)

Researchers at Stanford Medical Center are investigat
ing the causes, treatment and characteristics of acquired
immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in hopes of devel
oping effective methods for the cure and prevention of the
disease.
Thomas Merigan, professor of infectious diseases,
wrote in a Nov. 15, 1984, editorial in the New England
Journal of Medicine that the discovery of,HTLV-111 as a
virus related to AIDS has changed the epidemic from an
open-ended enigma into a defined medical problem that
can he investigated with the support of the knowledge of
other viral diseases.
Harold Burger and Barbara Weiser, post-doctoral fel
lows here, and William Robinson, professor of infectious
diseases, are studying the basic traits of HTLV-111 —
human T-cell lymphotropic retrovirus — the virus most
closely associated with the cause of AIDS. "Our goal is to
develop a vaccine against AIDS," Robinson said.
Vaccines are commonly developed by growing the virus
in tissue culture and eliminating its infectious ability or
through genetic engineering by producing the important
viral antigens — proteins that alert the body's immune
system to the presence of invaders — with clones of the
viral DNA inserted into bacteria, Robinson said.
The recombinant DNA method is the one more likely
to be used, since the use of a weakened virus is risky, said
Merigan in his editorial.
"Vaccine development with retroviruses is really just
beginning and it will take a lot of time and research to
produce something effective. Vaccines against
retroviruses are not common. The only one 1 know of is
for feline leukemia," Robinson said. Retroviruses differ
from viruses in that their genetic information is coded in
RNA rather than DNA. They use an enzyme called
reverse transcriptase to produce a DNA copy. This makes
genetic engineering more difficult, according to experts.
A potential problem in vaccine development is that
viruses may produce different antigens in different
people, Robinson said. This occurs through mutations in
the viral DNA that change the structure of its antigens.
For example, rhinoviruses, which cause the common cold,
mutate often and there are more than 100 different vari
eties, each with its own specific antigens, precluding the
development of an effective vaccine.
For some viruses, however, a change
in antigen structure would he lethal.
The question is how much antigen
variation there is tor HTLV-111, and
the answer is crucial in the develop
ment of an effective vaccine, said
Robinson.
Burger and Weiser have developed
a DNA clone of the genetic material
of HTLV-111, and are in the process
of determining the diagnostic useful
ness of a hybridization probe made
with the clone DNA, Robinson said.
The probe would detect the presence
of the virus in blood and tissue, he
said.
About a year ago they started a
clinical study of patients at high risk
of AIDS in order to determine the
degree of correlation between the
presence of the virus and the devel
opment of AIDS, Robinson said.
These people have signs of lym
phadenopathy, characterized by
swollen lymph glands and malaise.
AIDS is usually preceded by such
symptoms, but these symptoms are
not always followed by the disease.
A person can have the virus for
many months, even years, before de
veloping the disease, according to the
Center for Disease Control in At
lanta. For this reason, clinical studies
such as that being conducted by
Burger and Weiser need several years
before enough data can be accum
ulated to provide definite answers
about the role of HTLV-111 in AIDS,
Robinson said.
"The data they are getting certainly
implicate this virus and confirm that
the disease can be transmitted by
sexual contact," Robinson said.
In his editorial, Merigan wrote that
the HTLV-111 virus may not be the
only cause of AIDS, and that it may
work in conjunction with other
viruses or infectious agents.

When exposed to a virus, people
produce antibodies against that virus,
even when they do not have the
disease, according to Ld Hngleman,
assistant professor of pathology.
"There are individuals who don't
have AIDS and have anitibodies
against HTLV-111, and not everyone
who is infected gets AIDS, " he said.
Hngleman is conducting research
on the immune system and AIDS.
"We are trying to produce large
quantities of antibodies in vitro (in a
culture dish)," he said.
"We want to isolate the cell that
produces these antibodies, and make
it produce," said Engleman.
He is also working to determine
how HTLV-111 gets into cells and
why some cells are more susceptible
than others. Helper cells, a class of T
lymphocytes — a kind of white blood
cell — are known to be especially vul
nerable to attack by the virus.
"We have been studying the basics
of the immune system, the T-cells,"
Hngleman said.
Helper cells recognize antigens and
activate production of antibodies, and
another class of T-lymphocytes,
supressor cells, stops production of
antibodies. The usual ratio of helper
cells to supressor cells is 2:1; in
people with AIDS, that ratio
becomes as low as 1:10 because of an
absolute decrease of helper cells.
That decrease can precede symptoms
of disease by a year or more,
Engleman said.
There is a molecule on the surface
of the helper cell that binds to the
virus, and it is believed to be a pri
mary reason for the cell's vul
nerability, he said. That same
molecule is essential to the function
of the cell in activating the body's
defense against disease.
"It is the immune system on which
we must depend to fight disease, and
it is the immune system which is being
attacked by AIDS," Engleman said.

He said that immune enhancing
drugs, such as interleukin-2, are
probably not effective cures because
they "only boost the system but they
cannot heal it."
In the past, patients with ex
plainable immune deficiencies,
caused by radiation chemotherapy for

deficiency, according to the Center
lor Disease Control. "We're working
on it," Engleman said.
Be cause of such deficiencies in im
munity. AIDS is characterized by the
occurence of opportunistic infections,
infections which attack with greater
than usual severity or are very rare.

fc lt is the immune system on which we
must depend to fight disease, and it is
the immune system that is being at
tacked by AIDS. 1

cancer or by immune suppressive
drugs that facilitate organ transplants,
have displayed the same array of
symptoms and illnesses found in
people with AIDS. The number of
such cases, however, are rare and
with AIDS, which has reached
epidemic proportions, there is no
clear explanation behind the immune

Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and
Kaposi's sarcoma, an unusual cancer
of the tissue beneath the skin, are
most often associated with AIDS.
Toxoplasmosis encephalitis, an in
fection characterized by brain lesions,
has also become associated with
AIDS, according to Jack Remington,
professor of infectious diseases.

This form of encephalitis is caused
by a protozoan parasite, toxoplas
mosis gondii. The parasite is übiqui
tous and 30 to 50 percent of the U.S.
population is infected with it. Once
infected, a person is infected for life,
the parasite lying dormant in cyst
form. However, toxoplasmosis is a
relatively uncommon cause ot
disease. Remington said.
When the cysts are activated, they
can produce massive lesions in the
brain, which holds many more cysts
than other tissues in the body, he
said.
Toxoplasmosis encephalitis is very
rare, and has been previously found
in immunologically-deficient
patients. It is now the most common
form of encephalitis in the United
States, occuring more often than the
viral and fungal forms, and is
epidemic all over the world among
people with AIDS, he said.
In the United States. 10 to 20 per
cent of the people with AIDS who ;<re
also infected with the parasite will
develop the encephalitis, and 6 per
cent of all those with AIDS will
develop the disease, he said.
"At this time, the only common
denominator is AIDS," Remington
said.
Remington conducts his investiga
tions at the Research Institute of Palo
Alto Medical Foundation, where he is
working on diagnostic and
therapeutic methods for the disease
and the characteristics of the parasite.
Blood tests can be used to diagnose
toxoplasmosis encephalitis, but this
method does not work in people with
AIDS. Brain biopsies to determine
the presence of the parasite in the
tissue are currently the only method
of diagnosis, he said.
However, the parasite is often un
detectable by conventional methods
of tissue staining. Remington has
developed the immunoperoxidase
technique that allows identification of

the organism even when these meth
ods tail, he said. I lie tissue is exposed
to antibodies that attach to the an
tigens on the organism. When treated
by a particular enzyme. this an
tibody antigen complex turns brown,
revealing the presence of toxoplas
mosis.
In order to develop other methods
of diagnosis, he is working on the
identification and purification of the
antigens of toxoplasmosis and is
trying to clarify the importance ol
these antigens in the development ol
encephalitis, he said. I lie detectionyl
antigens in spinal fluid is a possible
method of diagnosis, and he is
working on its improvement.
The current method ol treating the
disease is administration of a sill
fanimide drug in combination with
pyrimethamine, a drug used for
malaria. This treatment is not very el
fective for people with AIDS because
they often have severe allergic reac
tions to sulfa drugs. Remington said.
He is screening new antibodies and
agents active against organisms
similar to toxoplasmosis in search of
alternative treatment. As vet he
had no significant findings, he said.
Merigan wrote in his editorial that
the next several years will see the du-.
velopment of a diagnostic test to
detect the presence of the AIDS
causative agent in blood, and that
testing of anti-viral agents and ex
perimental vaccines is likely to be un
der way in people who have thy
disease or are in a high-risk categorj.
In the United States. 72 pereent»»f
the people with AIDS are gay men.
14 percent are intravenous drug
users, 5 percent are Haitian im
migrants, 1 percent are hemophiliacs
and other recipients of blood transfu
sion products, and the remaining 6
percent fall into none of these high
risk categories, according to a report
by the Center for Disease Control.
