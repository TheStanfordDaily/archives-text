(In the first of a two-part series, The Daily hikes a look at
Stanford research into the causes and treatment of acquired
immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Tomorrow: How
people deal with AIDS.)

Researchers at Stanford Medical Center are investigat
ing the causes, treatment and characteristics of acquired
immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in hopes of devel
oping effective methods for the cure and prevention of the
disease.
Thomas Merigan, professor of infectious diseases,
wrote in a Nov. 15, 1984, editorial in the New England
Journal of Medicine that the discovery of,HTLV-111 as a
virus related to AIDS has changed the epidemic from an
open-ended enigma into a defined medical problem that
can he investigated with the support of the knowledge of
other viral diseases.
Harold Burger and Barbara Weiser, post-doctoral fel
lows here, and William Robinson, professor of infectious
diseases, are studying the basic traits of HTLV-111 —
human T-cell lymphotropic retrovirus — the virus most
closely associated with the cause of AIDS. "Our goal is to
develop a vaccine against AIDS," Robinson said.
Vaccines are commonly developed by growing the virus
in tissue culture and eliminating its infectious ability or
through genetic engineering by producing the important
viral antigens — proteins that alert the body's immune
system to the presence of invaders — with clones of the
viral DNA inserted into bacteria, Robinson said.
The recombinant DNA method is the one more likely
to be used, since the use of a weakened virus is risky, said
Merigan in his editorial.
"Vaccine development with retroviruses is really just
beginning and it will take a lot of time and research to
produce something effective. Vaccines against
retroviruses are not common. The only one 1 know of is
for feline leukemia," Robinson said. Retroviruses differ
from viruses in that their genetic information is coded in
RNA rather than DNA. They use an enzyme called
reverse transcriptase to produce a DNA copy. This makes
genetic engineering more difficult, according to experts.
A potential problem in vaccine development is that
viruses may produce different antigens in different
people, Robinson said. This occurs through mutations in
the viral DNA that change the structure of its antigens.
For example, rhinoviruses, which cause the common cold,
mutate often and there are more than 100 different vari
eties, each with its own specific antigens, precluding the
