## Mysterious shuttle flight ends 
### 
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — The space shuttle
Discovery glided back to Earth yesterday alter suc
cessfully firing a once-failed rocket system and. ap
parently. turning loose in space a supersensitive sp\
satellite.
The flight — the 15th by a reusable U.S. shuttle
spacecraft and the third by Discovery — ended in
the same shroud of mystery that enveloped its
launch. The mission marked a major step in the
United States' use of the heavens for military
operations.
"The crew has been welcomed home and Mis
sion 51-C has come to a successful conclusion."
said mission control after the shuttle rolled to a
stop.
The shuttle touched down at the Kennedy Space
Center's 15,000-foot landing strip at 4:23 p.m.
ES T. three days, one hour and 33 minutes after it
had blasted off from the launching pad last
Thursday afternoon. The craft arrived one day ear
lier than had been expected, apparently brought
home out of concern that the clear, dr\, spring-like
weather of yesterday might give wa\ to wind and
rain — poor landing conditions — today.
However, virtually all operational'letails of the
tlight were kept secret, including its intended dura
tion. The landing time was announced 16 hours
before it occurred.
When Discovery and its five crew members
returned to Earth, they completed the shortest mis
sion of a shuttle craft since the program's four test
flights were completed and regular operations

began in November I^S2.
Discovery began its descent about 150 miles
southwest of Australia, slicing through the upper
limits of the atmosphere on a downward glide from
the other side of the globe. It crossed over central
Florida, signaled its arrival with twin sonic booms
about 40.00(1 feet above the space center and
began a long, sweeping 270-degree turn that
brought it down to the runway.
I he Air Force, which is paying the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration $31.2 mil
lion tor the approximately $125 million flight,
proclaimed the operation a success but had little to
say beyond that.
It would not confirm that a satellite had been
carried aloft by the shuttle, let alone that it was
launched from the cargo bav and had moved into
position to help monitor radar, radio and other
electronic transmissions from the western Soviet
Union. According to a published report, such sur
veillance could help alert the United States to So
viet preparations for a nuclear war.
The customary post-flight news conference In
space agency officials was skipped. Even details of
the spacecraft's passage over the United States
were withheld, out of concern that any information
could tip off the Soviets to the operations of the
satellite.

I he Air Force, which is paying the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration $31.2 mil
lion tor the approximately $125 million flight,
proclaimed the operation a success but had little to
say beyond that.
It would not confirm that a satellite had been
carried aloft by the shuttle, let alone that it was
launched from the cargo bav and had moved into
position to help monitor radar, radio and other
electronic transmissions from the western Soviet
Union. According to a published report, such sur
veillance could help alert the United States to So
viet preparations for a nuclear war.
The customary post-flight news conference In
space agency officials was skipped. Even details of
the spacecraft's passage over the United States
were withheld, out of concern that any information
could tip off the Soviets to the operations of the
satellite.

Operating under tight restrictions imposed by

it did that with apparent ease, encountering nont
of the problems that hampered the first use of the
device aboard the shuttle in April 1983. At that
time, a nozzle steering mechanism overheated
leading it to send a tracking and data relay satellite
tumbling uselessly into a wrong orbit that was only
corrected when separate, tiny rockets were fired to
nudge it back into position.
The booster rocket was crucial to the current
mission and will be equally important to the next
shuttle flight. On Feb. 20. NASA is scheduled to
send the shuttle Challenger aloft to launch a second
tracking and data-relay satellite. On that mission.
Sen. Jake Ciam (K Utah) is scheduled to be the
first politician on a shuttle flight.
