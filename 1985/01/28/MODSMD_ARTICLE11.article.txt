# Post-ABC poll shows 2 to 1 in favor
## Most people back Treasury plan 
### 
WASHINGTON — Americans
support the Treasury Department's
income-tax simplification and revi
sion plan by 2 to 1, according to a
nationwide Washington Post-ABC
News public opinion poll.
The poll suggests that much of the
support comes from people who have
little or not understanding of Treas
ury's modified flat-tax plan, but who
think that the tax system is so unjust
that they would accept any changes
aimed at making it more fair.
Dissatisfaction with the income-tax
system is so strong that, while a
majority of the people interviewed
say they think "taxes are just too
high," four of every five say they
would not complain about the
amount they must pay if they thought
the wealthy were paying their share.
Almost all the opposition to the
plan, announced by Treasury Secre
tary Donald Regan in November,
comes from people who say they
think they would pay more in income
taxes under it. But even among that
group, one-third support the pro ;
posal.
Among people who say they think
that they would pay less or the same
amount in taxes, eight of every nine

back the proposal.
Just over half the 1,505 people in
terviewed by the Post and ABC News
said they had heard or read of the
Treasury proposal. Among them, 63
percent favored it and 27 percent
opposed it.
Of all those interviewed, including
those unfamiliar with the proposal,
53 percent said they favor it, 26 per
cent said they opposed it and 2 1 per
cent expressed no opinion.
A minority, whether or not they
had heard of the plan, said they think
that it will be enacted by Congress
without substantial changes.
The Treasury proposal would
replace the current 14 tax rates with
three, of 15 percent, 25 percent and
35 percent, depending on income.
According to Regan, 80 percent of all
taxpayers would pay less or the same
amount in taxes.
Overall, the program would yield
the same revenues as would current
law. Regan said.
The main change would be tin.
elimination of most deductions and
exemptions, on the grounds that
people of equal means should pay
about the same amount in taxes and
that investments by individuals and

businesses should be made because
they are considered worthwhile
rather than because they would lead
to tax reductions.
Regan's proposal would nominally
lower the tax rate for corporations
but in reality shift some of the burden
from individuals to corporations.
Interest groups ranging from the
real-estate industry to charitable or
ganizations have attacked aspects of
the plan as harmful to them. The pro
posal, however, also has drawn praise
from some tax specialists and citizens'
groups, among others.
Congressional leaders, while agree
ing that something should be done
about tax equity, generally have been
lukewarm about the plan. Senate
Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-
Kan.), said Thursday that the chance
for action on tax simplification this
year "is not so good."
As an eventual proposition, Dole
said, it is "very much alive."
In the Post-ABC News poll, con
ducted Jan. 1 1 to Jan. In, 34 percent
of the people interviewed who had
heard or read about the Treasury
proposal said they think that they
would pay more taxes if it were
enacted, 14 percent said they would

pay less and 44 percent said they
would pay about the same amount,
with S percent expressing no opinion.
About 40 percent of those inter
viewed with incomes of $20,000 a
year or less said they think that they
would have to pay more in taxes, al
though the Regan proposal calls for
elimination of income taxes for
people below the poverty level, and
for tax increases for about 10 to 15
percent of families with incomes ot
$20,000 or less.
This shows that many people who
have heard of the Treasury tax pro
posal seem to be unfamiliar with its
content. Other findings suggesl
strongly that the core of support for
the Regan plan comes from public
distaste for the current tax system.
Asked whether they agree or dis
agree that "the present tax system
benefits the rich and is unfaii to the
ordinary working man or woman," 72
percent said they agree.
On "whether nearly everyone who
has the chance cheats somewhat on
income taxes," 52 perceni said the\
agree.

plan, announced by Treasury Secre
tary Donald Regan in November,
comes from people who say they
think they would pay more in income
taxes under it. But even among that
group, one-third support the pro ;
posal.
Among people who say they think
that they would pay less or the same
amount in taxes, eight of every nine

back the proposal.
Just over half the 1,505 people in
terviewed by the Post and ABC News
said they had heard or read of the
Treasury proposal. Among them, 63
percent favored it and 27 percent
opposed it.
Of all those interviewed, including
those unfamiliar with the proposal,
53 percent said they favor it, 26 per
cent said they opposed it and 2 1 per
cent expressed no opinion.
A minority, whether or not they
had heard of the plan, said they think
that it will be enacted by Congress
without substantial changes.
The Treasury proposal would
replace the current 14 tax rates with
three, of 15 percent, 25 percent and
35 percent, depending on income.
According to Regan, 80 percent of all
taxpayers would pay less or the same
amount in taxes.
Overall, the program would yield
the same revenues as would current
law. Regan said.
The main change would be tin.
elimination of most deductions and
exemptions, on the grounds that
people of equal means should pay
about the same amount in taxes and
that investments by individuals and

businesses should be made because
they are considered worthwhile
rather than because they would lead
to tax reductions.
Regan's proposal would nominally
lower the tax rate for corporations
but in reality shift some of the burden
from individuals to corporations.
Interest groups ranging from the
real-estate industry to charitable or
ganizations have attacked aspects of
the plan as harmful to them. The pro
posal, however, also has drawn praise
from some tax specialists and citizens'
groups, among others.
Congressional leaders, while agree
ing that something should be done
about tax equity, generally have been
lukewarm about the plan. Senate
Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-
Kan.), said Thursday that the chance
for action on tax simplification this
year "is not so good."
As an eventual proposition, Dole
said, it is "very much alive."
In the Post-ABC News poll, con
ducted Jan. 1 1 to Jan. In, 34 percent
of the people interviewed who had
heard or read about the Treasury
proposal said they think that they
would pay more taxes if it were
enacted, 14 percent said they would

pay less and 44 percent said they
would pay about the same amount,
with S percent expressing no opinion.
About 40 percent of those inter
viewed with incomes of $20,000 a
year or less said they think that they
would have to pay more in taxes, al
though the Regan proposal calls for
elimination of income taxes for
people below the poverty level, and
for tax increases for about 10 to 15
percent of families with incomes ot
$20,000 or less.
This shows that many people who
have heard of the Treasury tax pro
posal seem to be unfamiliar with its
content. Other findings suggesl
strongly that the core of support for
the Regan plan comes from public
distaste for the current tax system.
Asked whether they agree or dis
agree that "the present tax system
benefits the rich and is unfaii to the
ordinary working man or woman," 72
percent said they agree.
On "whether nearly everyone who
has the chance cheats somewhat on
income taxes," 52 perceni said the\
agree.
