New arms talks set
WASHINGTON — The United States and the Soviet
Union announced Saturday that a new round of negotia
tions on nuclear and space arms will begin in Geneva,
Switzerland, on March 12, ending a 13-month suspension
on arms-control talks.
President Reagan said he hopes for an arms-control
agreement during his second term but cannot guarantee it
"because I know how long some negotiations have
taken."
Simultaneous announcements by the White House and
the Kremlin said the Soviet negotiating team will be
headed by V.P. Karpov, a 55-year-old career diplomat
who also headed the Soviet delegation at the previous
round of talks aimed at curbing long-range nuclear
missiles. Those talks broke down in the Swiss city in late
1983.
I he talks will cover long-range bombers, missiles and
submarines; intermediate-range missiles deployed in
Europe; and spaced-based defense measures, including
Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, known as "Star
Wars."
I he principal U.S. goal is a sharp reduction in offensive
weapons. The Soviets, who walked out of the talks in late
1 983, are aiming to block U.S. moves to create the Star
Wars defense against missiles, arguing it would spark the
militarization of outer space.
Also on the Soviet team will be Yuri Kvitsinsky, the
chief Soviet negotiator for medium-range missiles in the
previous talks and one of the architects of a tentative ac
cord which failed to reach fruition.
The other Soviet negotiator will be Alexei Obukhov,
deputy chief of the U.S. desk at the Soviet foreign mini
stry, who also took part in the previous long-range missile
negotiations.
The U.S. delegation, which was announced Jan. 18, will
be headed by Max Kampelman, a lawyer who has most
recently been Reagan's representative in talks aimed at
reducing East-West tensions.
Other members are John Tower, former chairman of
the Senate Armed Services Committee, who will be re
sponsible for dealing with long-range missiles; and
Maynard Glitman, a career diplomat who was on the U.S.
delegation in the intermediate-range missile talks. Reagan
met with the three men last week to discuss the U.S.
posture for the upcoming talks.
Goetz gets lesser charge
NEW YORK — Finding that his action was justified, a
grand jury here refused Friday to indict so-called vigilante
gunman Bernhard Goetz for attempted murder or lesser
assault charges for his shooting of four teen-agers who ac
costed him for $5 in a subway last month.
The grand jury did indict Goetz for illegal possession of
the .38 caliber pistol he used to shoot the four, as well as
illegal possession of two other unlicensed guns in his
apartment. The first charge is a felony and the other two
are misdemeanors.
But the grand jury's action on the more serious charges,

in effect an exoneration of Goetz for the shooting in the
highly controversial and internationally publicized case,
came as a surprise to prosecutors and defense lawyers, as
well as to the thin, shy 37-year-old electronics expert him
self. Goetz had confessed to police in a videotaped state
ment after he surrendered on Dec. 31, nine days after the
shooting.
Robert Morgenthau, Manhattan District Attorney, told
a crowded press conference that the 23-member grand
jury had viewed the videotape and heard evidence from
more than a dozen witnesses. He said the jurors
deliberated only an hour and 10 minutes before deciding
that Goetz was justified because he believed he was being
attacked by the youths.
"This grand jury believed he used reasonable force,"
Morgenthau said. He added, "They heard all the facts and
they did not believe he committed a crime in the shoot
ings."
Goetz's lawyer, Joseph Kelner, expressed delight at the
news but cautioned that the case should not be seen as an
endorsement of vigilantism. "It cannot be a blueprint for
anyone to take the law into | his | own hands," Kelner said
at a separate news conference. "That would be a horrible,
horrible consequence."
Kelner called the case a "tribute to the grand jury sys
tem," and speculated that the grand jurors had "mixed
their own common sense and feelings" in their delibera
tions. "Everyone's been touched by crime or knows some
one touched by crime," he said. He said the jurors "acted
on the facts."
Asked how Goetz had reacted, Kelner said, "He's not
gloating. He's humble. He's humbly grateful."
Dole warns Weinberger
WASHINGTON — Senate Majority Leader Robert
Dole (R-Kan.), in a blunt warning to Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger, said Friday that Republican efforts to
reduce federal deficits are in "real trouble" unless the
growth in defense spending is held down.
Weinberger rejected Dole's comments, according to a
spokesman who said the defense secretary feels that those
who seek to lower the military budget want to weaken
"the security of the country."
In a breakfast speech to a public relations group. Dole
said President Reagan risks losing the domestic spending
cuts he wants unless the Pentagon is willing to compro
mise on defense.
"I can tell you that unless we do more on the defense
side we aren't going to do much on Medicare, Medicaid or
anything else," Dole said.
Dole, spearheading the drive for massive deficit reduc
tions in Congress, skirted the edge of sarcasm when he
noted that the Pentagon has received huge increases in the
past few years and"the rest of the country has to survive
too."
Michael Burch, Weinberger's chief spokesman, said
Weinberger not only will not back down but also will
"take his case to the people" with a nationwide television
speech tonight.
Reagan Saturday rejected Dole's demands, saying it

would be "very risky" and "we've squeezed that apple
pretty good."
In a half-hour White House interview with seven radio
correspondents, Reagan appeared to signal that he is un
willing to make additional concessions on military spend
ing as part of a possible compromise with Senate
Republicans on the fiscal 1986 budget. But Reagan has in
the past agreed to such a compromise after initially taking
a rigid stance.
Reagan said the "shading" and "inflection" of Dole's
remarks had been wrongly reported by "the printed
media," and that the senator really was "calling attention
to what could be a fact within the Congress," that "when
they've needed money for some other program, they have
thought, 'Well, defense is the place we can get it.' "
Reagan said "what's being ignored" by congressional
critics are "the cuts that the Defense Department has
already made" in internal deliberations with the White
House and the Office of Management and Budget.
"Now, to go beyond that and just simply say, on a mat
ter of dollars, 'We're going to take more dollars regard
less,' is very risky, because the Defense Department —
that's the budget, the one budget that is dictated by
people outside the United States," Reagan said.
Pope calls for council
VATICAN CITY — In a surprising move. Pope John
Paul II called Friday for an extraordinary general synod of

Roman Catholic bishops to meet next fall and discuss the
Second Vatican Council which led to major reforms in the
church 20 years ago.
Speaking from the same altar at the Basilica of St.
Paul's Outside the Walls where the late Pope John Will
first summoned the modernizing council exactly 26 years
before. John Paul called for the synod to meet from Nov.
25 to Dec. N this year.
Although the conservative. Polish-born pontiff has
hinted in the past that he is not comfortable with all of the
results of the second council, it was uncertain Friday
whether he intends to seek a rethinking of any of the
council's changes at the fall synod.
The surprise announcement at the conclusion of a Mass,
ending a week of prayer for Christian unity came late;
Friday evening, hours after Vatican offices were closed!
and most churchmen were unavailable for comment or;
guidance concerning the pope's intentions.
However, one long-time Vatican observer pointed out*
that the short time allowed for the Synod, only two weeks.«
did not suggest a major move against the reforms of!
Vatican 11. as the council is often called, but rather aS
relatively brief review of their rekvance today and in the,'
coming years. J
In announcing the synod, only the second called by aj
pope since 1967. the pontiff said. "The church of today*
desires to proceed on the way to the third millenium of*
history . . .. following the way traced by the Second*
Vatican Council and always listening to what the spirit*
says to the churches." J
He also said that he called the meeting "above all to re-»
live in some way the extraordinary atmosphere" of*
Vatican II and "to exchange and discuss in greater depth!
experiences and news as to the application of the council*
at the level of the universal church and of particular
churches; to encourage the further study and the constant*
inclusion of Vatican II in the life of the church and in tho
light of new demands."
S. African reform pledged
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — President Pietcif
Botha said Friday that the South African government wilF
soon undertake further political reforms to give the
country's black majority a significant voice for the first
time in national decision-making.
Constitutional provisions will be made. Botha told thti
opening session of the South African Parliament in Cape
Town, so that urban blacks "can themselves decide theiC
own affairs up to the highest level" and participate it;
broader national decisions.
He also announced that black tribal homelands in rural
areas will be granted greater autonomy and. at the same
time, be brought into decisions made on national issues.
Botha gave no details of the planned reforms but they
apparently would end the exclusion of South Africa's 24
million blacks, 73 percent of the population, from na--
tional politics. Some black community leaders spoke
cautiously Friday of a possible breakthrough.

the Senate Armed Services Committee, who will be re
sponsible for dealing with long-range missiles; and
Maynard Glitman, a career diplomat who was on the U.S.
delegation in the intermediate-range missile talks. Reagan
met with the three men last week to discuss the U.S.
posture for the upcoming talks.
Goetz gets lesser charge
NEW YORK — Finding that his action was justified, a
grand jury here refused Friday to indict so-called vigilante
gunman Bernhard Goetz for attempted murder or lesser
assault charges for his shooting of four teen-agers who ac
costed him for $5 in a subway last month.
The grand jury did indict Goetz for illegal possession of
the .38 caliber pistol he used to shoot the four, as well as
illegal possession of two other unlicensed guns in his
apartment. The first charge is a felony and the other two
are misdemeanors.
But the grand jury's action on the more serious charges,

in effect an exoneration of Goetz for the shooting in the
highly controversial and internationally publicized case,
came as a surprise to prosecutors and defense lawyers, as
well as to the thin, shy 37-year-old electronics expert him
self. Goetz had confessed to police in a videotaped state
ment after he surrendered on Dec. 31, nine days after the
shooting.
Robert Morgenthau, Manhattan District Attorney, told
a crowded press conference that the 23-member grand
jury had viewed the videotape and heard evidence from
more than a dozen witnesses. He said the jurors
deliberated only an hour and 10 minutes before deciding
that Goetz was justified because he believed he was being
attacked by the youths.
"This grand jury believed he used reasonable force,"
Morgenthau said. He added, "They heard all the facts and
they did not believe he committed a crime in the shoot
ings."
Goetz's lawyer, Joseph Kelner, expressed delight at the
news but cautioned that the case should not be seen as an
endorsement of vigilantism. "It cannot be a blueprint for
anyone to take the law into | his | own hands," Kelner said
at a separate news conference. "That would be a horrible,
horrible consequence."
Kelner called the case a "tribute to the grand jury sys
tem," and speculated that the grand jurors had "mixed
their own common sense and feelings" in their delibera
tions. "Everyone's been touched by crime or knows some
one touched by crime," he said. He said the jurors "acted
on the facts."
Asked how Goetz had reacted, Kelner said, "He's not
gloating. He's humble. He's humbly grateful."
Dole warns Weinberger
WASHINGTON — Senate Majority Leader Robert
Dole (R-Kan.), in a blunt warning to Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger, said Friday that Republican efforts to
reduce federal deficits are in "real trouble" unless the
growth in defense spending is held down.
Weinberger rejected Dole's comments, according to a
spokesman who said the defense secretary feels that those
who seek to lower the military budget want to weaken
"the security of the country."
In a breakfast speech to a public relations group. Dole
said President Reagan risks losing the domestic spending
cuts he wants unless the Pentagon is willing to compro
mise on defense.
"I can tell you that unless we do more on the defense
side we aren't going to do much on Medicare, Medicaid or
anything else," Dole said.
Dole, spearheading the drive for massive deficit reduc
tions in Congress, skirted the edge of sarcasm when he
noted that the Pentagon has received huge increases in the
past few years and"the rest of the country has to survive
too."
Michael Burch, Weinberger's chief spokesman, said
Weinberger not only will not back down but also will
"take his case to the people" with a nationwide television
speech tonight.
Reagan Saturday rejected Dole's demands, saying it

would be "very risky" and "we've squeezed that apple
pretty good."
In a half-hour White House interview with seven radio
correspondents, Reagan appeared to signal that he is un
willing to make additional concessions on military spend
ing as part of a possible compromise with Senate
Republicans on the fiscal 1986 budget. But Reagan has in
the past agreed to such a compromise after initially taking
a rigid stance.
Reagan said the "shading" and "inflection" of Dole's
remarks had been wrongly reported by "the printed
media," and that the senator really was "calling attention
to what could be a fact within the Congress," that "when
they've needed money for some other program, they have
thought, 'Well, defense is the place we can get it.' "
Reagan said "what's being ignored" by congressional
critics are "the cuts that the Defense Department has
already made" in internal deliberations with the White
House and the Office of Management and Budget.
"Now, to go beyond that and just simply say, on a mat
ter of dollars, 'We're going to take more dollars regard
less,' is very risky, because the Defense Department —
that's the budget, the one budget that is dictated by
people outside the United States," Reagan said.
Pope calls for council
VATICAN CITY — In a surprising move. Pope John
Paul II called Friday for an extraordinary general synod of

Roman Catholic bishops to meet next fall and discuss the
Second Vatican Council which led to major reforms in the
church 20 years ago.
Speaking from the same altar at the Basilica of St.
Paul's Outside the Walls where the late Pope John Will
first summoned the modernizing council exactly 26 years
before. John Paul called for the synod to meet from Nov.
25 to Dec. N this year.
Although the conservative. Polish-born pontiff has
hinted in the past that he is not comfortable with all of the
results of the second council, it was uncertain Friday
whether he intends to seek a rethinking of any of the
council's changes at the fall synod.
The surprise announcement at the conclusion of a Mass,
ending a week of prayer for Christian unity came late;
Friday evening, hours after Vatican offices were closed!
and most churchmen were unavailable for comment or;
guidance concerning the pope's intentions.
However, one long-time Vatican observer pointed out*
that the short time allowed for the Synod, only two weeks.«
did not suggest a major move against the reforms of!
Vatican 11. as the council is often called, but rather aS
relatively brief review of their rekvance today and in the,'
coming years. J
In announcing the synod, only the second called by aj
pope since 1967. the pontiff said. "The church of today*
desires to proceed on the way to the third millenium of*
history . . .. following the way traced by the Second*
Vatican Council and always listening to what the spirit*
says to the churches." J
He also said that he called the meeting "above all to re-»
live in some way the extraordinary atmosphere" of*
Vatican II and "to exchange and discuss in greater depth!
experiences and news as to the application of the council*
at the level of the universal church and of particular
churches; to encourage the further study and the constant*
inclusion of Vatican II in the life of the church and in tho
light of new demands."
S. African reform pledged
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — President Pietcif
Botha said Friday that the South African government wilF
soon undertake further political reforms to give the
country's black majority a significant voice for the first
time in national decision-making.
Constitutional provisions will be made. Botha told thti
opening session of the South African Parliament in Cape
Town, so that urban blacks "can themselves decide theiC
own affairs up to the highest level" and participate it;
broader national decisions.
He also announced that black tribal homelands in rural
areas will be granted greater autonomy and. at the same
time, be brought into decisions made on national issues.
Botha gave no details of the planned reforms but they
apparently would end the exclusion of South Africa's 24
million blacks, 73 percent of the population, from na--
tional politics. Some black community leaders spoke
cautiously Friday of a possible breakthrough.

New arms talks set
WASHINGTON — The United States and the Soviet
Union announced Saturday that a new round of negotia
tions on nuclear and space arms will begin in Geneva,
Switzerland, on March 12, ending a 13-month suspension
on arms-control talks.
President Reagan said he hopes for an arms-control
agreement during his second term but cannot guarantee it
"because I know how long some negotiations have
taken."
Simultaneous announcements by the White House and
the Kremlin said the Soviet negotiating team will be
headed by V.P. Karpov, a 55-year-old career diplomat
who also headed the Soviet delegation at the previous
round of talks aimed at curbing long-range nuclear
missiles. Those talks broke down in the Swiss city in late
1983.
I he talks will cover long-range bombers, missiles and
submarines; intermediate-range missiles deployed in
Europe; and spaced-based defense measures, including
Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, known as "Star
Wars."
I he principal U.S. goal is a sharp reduction in offensive
weapons. The Soviets, who walked out of the talks in late
1 983, are aiming to block U.S. moves to create the Star
Wars defense against missiles, arguing it would spark the
militarization of outer space.
Also on the Soviet team will be Yuri Kvitsinsky, the
chief Soviet negotiator for medium-range missiles in the
previous talks and one of the architects of a tentative ac
cord which failed to reach fruition.
The other Soviet negotiator will be Alexei Obukhov,
deputy chief of the U.S. desk at the Soviet foreign mini
stry, who also took part in the previous long-range missile
negotiations.
The U.S. delegation, which was announced Jan. 18, will
be headed by Max Kampelman, a lawyer who has most
recently been Reagan's representative in talks aimed at
reducing East-West tensions.
Other members are John Tower, former chairman of
the Senate Armed Services Committee, who will be re

anyone to take the law into | his | own hands," Kelner said
at a separate news conference. "That would be a horrible,
horrible consequence."
Kelner called the case a "tribute to the grand jury sys
tem," and speculated that the grand jurors had "mixed
their own common sense and feelings" in their delibera
tions. "Everyone's been touched by crime or knows some
one touched by crime," he said. He said the jurors "acted
on the facts."
Asked how Goetz had reacted, Kelner said, "He's not
gloating. He's humble. He's humbly grateful."
Dole warns Weinberger
WASHINGTON — Senate Majority Leader Robert
Dole (R-Kan.), in a blunt warning to Defense Secretary
Caspar Weinberger, said Friday that Republican efforts to
reduce federal deficits are in "real trouble" unless the
growth in defense spending is held down.
Weinberger rejected Dole's comments, according to a
spokesman who said the defense secretary feels that those
who seek to lower the military budget want to weaken
"the security of the country."
In a breakfast speech to a public relations group. Dole
said President Reagan risks losing the domestic spending
cuts he wants unless the Pentagon is willing to compro
mise on defense.
"I can tell you that unless we do more on the defense
side we aren't going to do much on Medicare, Medicaid or
anything else," Dole said.
Dole, spearheading the drive for massive deficit reduc
tions in Congress, skirted the edge of sarcasm when he
noted that the Pentagon has received huge increases in the
past few years and"the rest of the country has to survive
too."
Michael Burch, Weinberger's chief spokesman, said
Weinberger not only will not back down but also will
"take his case to the people" with a nationwide television
speech tonight.
Reagan Saturday rejected Dole's demands, saying it

would be "very risky" and "we've squeezed that apple
pretty good."
In a half-hour White House interview with seven radio
correspondents, Reagan appeared to signal that he is un
willing to make additional concessions on military spend
ing as part of a possible compromise with Senate
Republicans on the fiscal 1986 budget. But Reagan has in
the past agreed to such a compromise after initially taking
a rigid stance.
Reagan said the "shading" and "inflection" of Dole's
remarks had been wrongly reported by "the printed
media," and that the senator really was "calling attention
to what could be a fact within the Congress," that "when
they've needed money for some other program, they have
thought, 'Well, defense is the place we can get it.' "
Reagan said "what's being ignored" by congressional
critics are "the cuts that the Defense Department has
already made" in internal deliberations with the White
House and the Office of Management and Budget.
"Now, to go beyond that and just simply say, on a mat
ter of dollars, 'We're going to take more dollars regard
less,' is very risky, because the Defense Department —
that's the budget, the one budget that is dictated by
people outside the United States," Reagan said.
Pope calls for council
VATICAN CITY — In a surprising move. Pope John
Paul II called Friday for an extraordinary general synod of

Roman Catholic bishops to meet next fall and discuss the
Second Vatican Council which led to major reforms in the
church 20 years ago.
Speaking from the same altar at the Basilica of St.
Paul's Outside the Walls where the late Pope John Will
first summoned the modernizing council exactly 26 years
before. John Paul called for the synod to meet from Nov.
25 to Dec. N this year.
Although the conservative. Polish-born pontiff has
hinted in the past that he is not comfortable with all of the
results of the second council, it was uncertain Friday
whether he intends to seek a rethinking of any of the
council's changes at the fall synod.
The surprise announcement at the conclusion of a Mass,
ending a week of prayer for Christian unity came late;
Friday evening, hours after Vatican offices were closed!
and most churchmen were unavailable for comment or;
guidance concerning the pope's intentions.
However, one long-time Vatican observer pointed out*
that the short time allowed for the Synod, only two weeks.«
did not suggest a major move against the reforms of!
Vatican 11. as the council is often called, but rather aS
relatively brief review of their rekvance today and in the,'
coming years. J
In announcing the synod, only the second called by aj
pope since 1967. the pontiff said. "The church of today*
desires to proceed on the way to the third millenium of*
history . . .. following the way traced by the Second*
Vatican Council and always listening to what the spirit*
says to the churches." J
He also said that he called the meeting "above all to re-»
live in some way the extraordinary atmosphere" of*
Vatican II and "to exchange and discuss in greater depth!
experiences and news as to the application of the council*
at the level of the universal church and of particular
churches; to encourage the further study and the constant*
inclusion of Vatican II in the life of the church and in tho
light of new demands."
S. African reform pledged
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — President Pietcif
Botha said Friday that the South African government wilF
soon undertake further political reforms to give the
country's black majority a significant voice for the first
time in national decision-making.
Constitutional provisions will be made. Botha told thti
opening session of the South African Parliament in Cape
Town, so that urban blacks "can themselves decide theiC
own affairs up to the highest level" and participate it;
broader national decisions.
He also announced that black tribal homelands in rural
areas will be granted greater autonomy and. at the same
time, be brought into decisions made on national issues.
Botha gave no details of the planned reforms but they
apparently would end the exclusion of South Africa's 24
million blacks, 73 percent of the population, from na--
tional politics. Some black community leaders spoke
cautiously Friday of a possible breakthrough.

New arms talks set
WASHINGTON — The United States and the Soviet
Union announced Saturday that a new round of negotia
tions on nuclear and space arms will begin in Geneva,
Switzerland, on March 12, ending a 13-month suspension
on arms-control talks.
President Reagan said he hopes for an arms-control
agreement during his second term but cannot guarantee it
"because I know how long some negotiations have
taken."
Simultaneous announcements by the White House and
the Kremlin said the Soviet negotiating team will be
headed by V.P. Karpov, a 55-year-old career diplomat
who also headed the Soviet delegation at the previous
round of talks aimed at curbing long-range nuclear
missiles. Those talks broke down in the Swiss city in late
1983.
I he talks will cover long-range bombers, missiles and
submarines; intermediate-range missiles deployed in
Europe; and spaced-based defense measures, including
Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, known as "Star
Wars."
I he principal U.S. goal is a sharp reduction in offensive
weapons. The Soviets, who walked out of the talks in late
1 983, are aiming to block U.S. moves to create the Star
Wars defense against missiles, arguing it would spark the
militarization of outer space.
Also on the Soviet team will be Yuri Kvitsinsky, the
chief Soviet negotiator for medium-range missiles in the
previous talks and one of the architects of a tentative ac
cord which failed to reach fruition.
The other Soviet negotiator will be Alexei Obukhov,
deputy chief of the U.S. desk at the Soviet foreign mini
stry, who also took part in the previous long-range missile
negotiations.
The U.S. delegation, which was announced Jan. 18, will
be headed by Max Kampelman, a lawyer who has most
recently been Reagan's representative in talks aimed at
reducing East-West tensions.
Other members are John Tower, former chairman of
the Senate Armed Services Committee, who will be re
sponsible for dealing with long-range missiles; and
Maynard Glitman, a career diplomat who was on the U.S.
delegation in the intermediate-range missile talks. Reagan
met with the three men last week to discuss the U.S.
posture for the upcoming talks.
Goetz gets lesser charge
NEW YORK — Finding that his action was justified, a
grand jury here refused Friday to indict so-called vigilante
gunman Bernhard Goetz for attempted murder or lesser
assault charges for his shooting of four teen-agers who ac
costed him for $5 in a subway last month.
The grand jury did indict Goetz for illegal possession of
the .38 caliber pistol he used to shoot the four, as well as
illegal possession of two other unlicensed guns in his
apartment. The first charge is a felony and the other two
are misdemeanors.
But the grand jury's action on the more serious charges,

in effect an exoneration of Goetz for the shooting in the
highly controversial and internationally publicized case,
came as a surprise to prosecutors and defense lawyers, as
well as to the thin, shy 37-year-old electronics expert him
self. Goetz had confessed to police in a videotaped state
ment after he surrendered on Dec. 31, nine days after the
shooting.
Robert Morgenthau, Manhattan District Attorney, told
a crowded press conference that the 23-member grand
jury had viewed the videotape and heard evidence from
more than a dozen witnesses. He said the jurors
deliberated only an hour and 10 minutes before deciding
that Goetz was justified because he believed he was being
attacked by the youths.
"This grand jury believed he used reasonable force,"
Morgenthau said. He added, "They heard all the facts and
they did not believe he committed a crime in the shoot
ings."
Goetz's lawyer, Joseph Kelner, expressed delight at the
news but cautioned that the case should not be seen as an
endorsement of vigilantism. "It cannot be a blueprint for
anyone to take the law into | his | own hands," Kelner said
at a separate news conference. "That would be a horrible,
horrible consequence."
Kelner called the case a "tribute to the grand jury sys
tem," and speculated that the grand jurors had "mixed
their own common sense and feelings" in their delibera
tions. "Everyone's been touched by crime or knows some
one touched by crime," he said. He said the jurors "acted
