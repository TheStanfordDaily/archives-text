## The 						Stanford Daily View of reality distorted 
### 
Last week the National Urban League issued
its annual report on the "State of Black
America." The report indicted the Reagan ad
ministration for increasing the misery of black
Americans through cuts in social service pro
grams, opposition to the principles of affirmative
action and failure to enforce civil rights legisla
tion.
At the same time, President Reagan said that
black leaders were misrepresenting the record of
his administration. He said that some mainstream
black leaders "are protecting some rather good
positions that they have, and they can protect
them better if they can keep their constituency
aggrieved and believing that they have a
legitimate complaint. If [blacl:s] ever become
aware of the opportunities that are improving,
they might wonder whether they need some of
those organizations."
We have suspected for quite a while that the
president has at best only a minimal grasp of
reality. This confirms it. Reagan believes that by
saying something is so, he can make it so.
In 1980, he stood in the Bronx listening to a
poor black man ask if there was anything left to

hope for. Reagan responded in the affirmative.
Four years later, 36 percent of all black people
live in poverty. That's their highest poverty rate
in 20 years. One out of two black children lives in
poverty. The black unemployment rate is 16 per
cent, compared with 6 percent for whites. The
teen-age unemployment rate for blacks is in the
40 to 60 percent range. Long-term unemploy
ment for blacks is up 70 percent.
And yet the president says that opportunities
are improving. Is he lying? Does he just not un
derstand? Does he not care? What causes
Reagan to be so distanced from the real world?
We should not really be surprised at the presi
dent's remarks. After all, this is the same man
who opposed the Civil Rights Act, the Voting
Rights Act and Fair Housing. Is it any wonder
that 94 percent of the black vote went against
him last year? The masses of black people know
that their lives have gotten worse under Reagan.
They experience reality every day. Now if we
could only get the president to see that beneath
his "shining city on a hill" is a valley of despair
filled with people of all races suffering under the
burden of oppression that is Reaganism.
