## Four-class housing best for freshmen 
### 
Unfortunately, from your Jan. 23 article on
â€¢the proposed creation of more all-freshman
dorms. I can scarcely make out my own
opinion. In the article, i seem at the beginning
to he for all-frosh dorms, while at the end I
appear to he against them. Since the latter is
unequivocally my viewpoint, 1 would like to

VIEWPOINT

present it a Dit more clearly than your
reporter has done.
To the extent to which 1 understand the
reasoning behind this suggested change, there
are two main arguments for it:
1. At present we cannot accommodate in
all-frosh dorms all those who request them.
2. In some four-class dorms at present,
there are not enough freshmen to meet the
"'critical mass" required for full advising pro
grams. in-house Western Culture classes and
the like.
. Both of these facts are true. In response to
"the first. I would like to remind everyone that
the requesters are in fact high school seniors,
and that their choice of all-frosh dorms over
'four-class dorms is probably not very well
informed. To the extent to which they have
specific reasons, I suspect they have to do
U i th some expectation of a wilder social life in
all-frosh dorms, or with a fear of mixing with
Mpperclassmen. 1 don't think Stanford should

cater to either reason. I also think it would he
interesting to find out what freshmen think
after they have had a chance to observe hoth
types of living here at Stanford, say at the end
of their freshman year.
As for the second point, it is true that some
four-class dorms have too small a number of
freshmen for in-house classes or complete
advising programs. It should he noted,
however, that most four-class dorms do have
this kind of critical mass, either because of
sheer size (Roble or Toyon, for example), or
because several smaller houses have been
combined for the purposes of such freshman
programs (West Lagunita, for example, con
sists of three houses with shared freshman ad
visers and shared in-house classes). Alt
four-class houses could achieve a critical mass
of freshmen if the latter approach were tried
more often, or indeed, if all-frosh houses were
eliminated and their freshmen distributed
among four-class dorms.
Although 1 am not pushing for this second
solution, 1 feel it is much the better direction
to go. 1 think I speak for most resident fellows
when I say that four-class dorms do a better
job than frosh dorms of integrating freshmen
into the Stanford community, of discouraging
childish and destructive behavior and even of
establishing a meaningful intellectual
dialogue between people of different back
grounds and interests.

I don't want to be anecdotal about this, but
1 haven't seen any hard data on either side of
the issue. So, prose rather than charts:
Within a few weeks of arrival at Stanford,
one would be hard put to distinguish between
frosh and upperclassmen in four-class houses.
They are very comfortable getting around

range a class schedule, declare a major, etc.
(not from their advisers, either). While they
have a firm base in their house, they begin
joining campus organizations their upperclass
friends have pointed out to them and in gen
eral start participating in the public life of the
University.
Frosh in all-frosh houses have two groups
of upperclassmen available to them, resident

assistants and advising associates. They prob
ably only get to know one A A very well,
theirs, and maybe a couple of RAs. Their
community is formed by other people in the
same boat they are. freaking out at the same
time, taking Chemistry 31 midterms at the
same time and in general incapable of giving
them a different perspective on the Univer
sity. The RA becomes incredibly important to
these people, and in many cases all-frosh RAs
perform in an almost superhuman way, but
when it comes right down to it, the RA is one
person with a single perspective.
Linked to the isolation from the rest of the
University, and especially from (somewhat)
older and wiser minds, all-frosh dorms
sometimes take on the aspect of a fifth year of
high school away from parental constraints. I
think no one will dispute the assertion that
all-frosh dorms have more behavioral prob
lems of many kinds than do other dorms with
freshmen: more alcohol problems, more dam
ages to dorm fixtures, more loud and ob
noxious behavior.
I agree that programs centered around
Western Culture and other freshman classes
can lead to a great deal of interesting discus
sion at the dinner table and in dorm hallways.
But one should not forget that by this time, all
Stanford students have had to take these
classes, and that they did not stop thinking
about the issues raised by them when they

finished their freshman year. In many cases,
students go on to take classes in related areas,
thereby becoming potential sources of insight
and inspiration to those just now taking the
first classes. In my dorm I have seen many
such discussions between upperclassmen and
freshmen, and I would hate to think that they
will be reduced to discussions between
neophyte and neophyte. For under what other
circumstances will people from different
classes discuss these topics which the Com
mittee on Undergraduate Studies has decided
are central to education at Stanford? The rea
son the discussions go on in four-class dorms
is that the topics are of immediate interest to
one of the interlocutors; in a three-class dorm
that would not be the case.
Which brings me to my final point abot
the creation of more all-frosh dorms. If you
take freshmen away from four-class dorms, it
cannot but weaken those dorms. Freshmen
are the backbone of four-class dorms in many
ways. Theirs is the enthusiasm, the willingness
to experiment and question, which is capable
of galvanizing upperclassmen out of a poten
tial withdrawal into familiar interests and
familiar friends. I love being the resident lel
low of a four-class dorm. I would rather not
be one in a three-class dorm. And don't even
bother asking about all-frosh dorms.
