A call for action
• I he editorial criticizing the
vprank" of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon
pledges in White Plaza on Jan. 15
(The Daily, Jan. 23) is commendable
because it expresses the right senti
ments. but it does not call for an
action — by the administration —
v»!liich would acknowledge that the
Ijjsie has passed for viewing such
.behavior as merely a "stunt." If. as
i ik editorial rightly states, the SAE
'"stunt" is "inexcusable," then there
moral obligation not to let
jieStures of disapproval replace the
•serious judicial punishments meted

out in the past to fraternity "stunts'
with even less outrageous implica
tions.
Wielding a hammer at a mock-up
of George Segal's "Gay Liberation"
sculpture was far from being the
"harmless imitation of a statue"
which SAE President John Peterson
called it. If the members of SAE
were not conscious of a "malicious
intent," that very fact demonstrates
how easy it remains to perpetuate
and act out the worst kind of anti
gay prejudice. Surely their moral
sense has been numbed — not only
by a history of gay-bashing but also
by a continued complacency in the

liberal community that saves both
straights and gays from insisting that
"gay" rights are human rights. It is
still too easy for people like the SAE
pranksters to see their behavior as a
joke which will meet with nothing
more than a slap on the hand.
The irony of staging the "prank"
on the anniversary of the birth of
Martin Luther King, Jr. and within
sight of a rally commemorating that
great man's attack on prejudice did
not reside only in the perceptions of
"some passers-by." It was an irony
ingrained in the landscape of White
Plaza and its two symbolic events —
one celebrating an acceptance of

dbersity and the other willfully
mocking it, willfully becoming
assured of a tacitly approving audi
ence.
The appropriate response to this
outrage is more than a stronger
editorial. It is a response by the
office of Residential Education,
which should consider the enormity
of the insult, and the threat, to gay
people and determine the action
which answers to the gravity of the
offense.
