What?
I'm talking about listening. That's the most im-
Dortant part of communication — hearing what
someone else has to say. It seems so simple, and yet
so few people are willing to do it. We refuse to take
the time to pay attention to and try to understand
gnu another, so wrapped up in our own lives and
our o\\ n God-forbid-there's-another-side-to-it
viewpoints. And for our trouble (or lack thereof)
we get misperceptions. misunderstandings, frustra
tion. anger, hostility and hatred.
Close-minded folks attack Planned Parenthood
clinics, so ready to pin the "e\ils" of abortion on
them that they won't see past their mental blinders
and accept the true purpose of the program. It's
easier than listening. Nine-tenths of the student

happy to parade their intolerance for others' desire
to exercise their human rights instead of honestly
thinking. To understand requires mental effort, and
w ho's got the openness to spare?
Maybe it's me who doesn't understand. Maybe
we should all live by ignoring others and assuming
that we're right. But what is so wrong with listening
jug to a person until he's done speaking, without
shutting him out or passing holy judgement on his

opinions halfway? Where is the harm in opening
the mind to other ideas and really thinking about
them? Unless of course it might actually show me
that I've made a mistake. In "To Kill A Mock
ingbird." Atticus Finch tells his daughter Scout that
she can't condemn a person until she "climbs into
their shoes and walks around for a while." With

four billion other pairs of shoes out there, is it fair
to stick your feet in quick-drying mental concrete?
I know. I'm wandering. It's just so painful to
think about all the failures and disasters that might
be averted if we take the time to consider what we
see and hear. The famine in Ethiopia has been
building for years, and yet we refused to hear the
signals until the press forced the reality of starva
tion upon us. The superpowers trade rhetoric back

and forth, so smothered in prefabricated words and
ideologies that neither side tries to see from the
other's spot. Yes, there is common ground: We're
all human, and Americans turn to ash as easily as
Soviets in a nuclear explosion. So why can't we at
tempt to understand them?
The problem has deep roots. Busy with studies,
working hard to earn a living or just engrossed in
day-to-day activities, we find it tough to spare an
car for someone to talk into. Caught up in our reli
gion's interpretation of the world, we block out the
doctrines of another faith. Shorter attention spans,
brought on by TV screens and symphonic beats,
prevent us from focusing our thoughts for an ex
tended period of time. Great Truths of Life are
delivered in three-frame comic strips; the one you
read tomorrow will erase your memory of today's.
People learn to hear for only a minute at a time,
and what they've heard slips quietly away in a few
moments, hours or days. Just keep trotting ahead,
and let the garbage you heard yesterday trail off
behind, dead weight in the way of tomorrow's en
tertainment. If the president can forget, why can't
you?
Arc you still with me? Good. We need to hear
each other. We need to start listening before it's
too late. Maybe it's easier to shut out what we don't
want to hear in the short run. but in time those
things will come back, and they'll be worse. Eight
hundred million people in this world live in abso
lute poverty, and the number will keep growing un
less we see and help. Until we try to understand the
Soviets, we'll live in danger of mass genocide. Our
problems and differences can't be ignored forever.
That's all. Thanks for listening.
