## Bruins lay waste to Cardinal, 100-71 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
LOS ANGELES — For Stanford,
the best thing about Saturday night's
basketball game against UCLA was
that it ended.
And not a moment too soon.
The final score was 100-71, but it
could have been worse. Had the
turnover-laden crew of UCLA
reserves not seen considerable
playing time, it would have been.
Believe it or not, it was actually a
game for the first 20 minutes, and
Stanford went into the lockerroom at
halftime behind by only 10, 40-30.
But after the Bruins outscored the
Cardinal, 36-8, to open the second
half, the only excitement left was
whether they would score 100 points.
They did, with two second to spare,
when Kevin Butler turned a Cardinal
bad pass into a layup. After Butler
followed in a missed shot with 1:23
remaining to give 96 points, UCLA
students held up four fingers and
began chanting "four more."
When reserve Jeff Dunlap scored
to give them 98 they held up two fin
gers and after Butler's last-second
heroics, the near-capacity crowd of
11,178, most of whom opted to watch
the massacre than beat the traffic,
gave the Bruins a raucous standing
ovation.
UCLA, which avenged last
season's 75-64 loss to Stanford, im
proved its record to 9-7 overall and
6-2 in the Pacific 10 Conference,
good for a three-way tie for first
place.
Stanford, meanwhile, fell to 9-7
overall and 1-5 in the Pac-10. The
Cardinal will try to stay out of the
conference cellar tonight at 8 p.m. by
beating the University of Southern
California — no easy task. USC is 11 -

4 overall, 5-1 in the Pac-10 and can
take over sole possession of first place
with a victory tonight.
So what does Stanford, which has
lost its five conference games by an
average of 18 points, do now? For
getting Saturday night's game was
ever played isn't a bad start.
"I told them not to be too critical of
themselves," Cardinal Coach Tom
Davis said of the 29-point beating,
the worst in his three years at Stan
ford and the Cardinal's 36th straight
loss to UCLA here. "You can't
belabor it too much.
"1 didn't worry about keeping the
spread close," Davis continued. "If
you are going to lose, it doesn't mat
ter what you lose by, whether it's 30
or 15 points."
The loss overshadowed a brilliant
second-half performance by forward
Charles Hunt. Hunt, a senior seeing
the first meaningful playing time of
his career, scored 17 points, including
a Stanford record-setting 11-for-11
from the free throw iine. And all this
in 10 minutes of second-half play.
While Davis could sing the praises
of only one player, UCLA Coach
Walt Hazzard could and did for his
entire team, especially after what he
felt was a lackadaisical effort against
the University of California at
Berkeley two nights earlier.
Although UCLA beat Cal, 80-69,
Hazzard chewed out the Bruins for
not playing hard enough. When cen
ter Brad Wright was asked what Haz
zard said after Thursday's victory,
Wright replied, "No comment."
But on Saturday night, Hazzard
walked into the interview room, sat
down, tipped his chair against the
wall and said, "No complaints
tonight."
"It was something I hoped our

team would pull off," he continued.
"As time progresses, we're getting
the team I'd like to have. The Death
March is paying its dividends."
The "Death March" is what Haz
zard called his. to say the least, rather
difficult pre-Pac-10 schedule. Road
games against St. John's University,
Memphis State University, DePaul
University and Brigham Young Uni
versity left the Bruins with a lot of ex
perience, but only a 3-5 record
entering conference play.
On the other hand, Stanford's com
paratively easy preseason schedule —
one with only one true road game and
two on a neutral court — may not
have prepared it to play teams like
UCLA in arenas like Pauley Pavilion,
where it is 0-20.
When the game began slipping
away from Stanford early in the
second half, the Cardinal simply lost
control. After the Bruins scored 1 3 of
the first 17 second-half points, Davis
called a timeout.
"They were totally in a fog, totally
disrupted." Davis said of his players.
"I just told them to play their game
and not worry about the score. If you
try to make up 20 points in a minute,
all of a sudden you're down by 30.
You just have to stay in your game."
UCLA was able to take leads of 20,

HI and then nearly 40 points with ex
cellent outside shooting over a Card
inal zone. Guard Nigel Miguel and
forwards Reggie Miller and Gary
Maloncon combined for 57 points
while shooting 65.S percent (25-for
vS) from the floor, almost all from
long range. The trio scored 18 of
UCLA's first 20 points and 22 of its
lirst 25 in the second half.
UCLA, which took one fewer shot
hut made 14 more than Stanford,
shot 55. y percent from the floor as a
team. Stanford shot 34.8 percent, its
third straight game under 35 percent.
"We could slow the ball down, take
better shots and raise our field goal
percentage," Davis said of the Card
inal. the worst shooting team in the
conference. "But I want to try to play
the same style we're going to play
when we're good."
Other than field goal percentage,
the team statistics were surprisingly
equal. The Bruins outrebounded the
Cardinal, 43-38, but Stanford shot
better from the free throw line (76.7
to (iK.fi percent) and had more steals
(13-1 1).
"We can be competitive some
nights." Davis said. "But everything
has to fall into place for that to hap
pen."

try to make up 20 points in a minute,
all of a sudden you're down by 30.
You just have to stay in your game."
UCLA was able to take leads of 20,

HI and then nearly 40 points with ex
cellent outside shooting over a Card
inal zone. Guard Nigel Miguel and
forwards Reggie Miller and Gary
Maloncon combined for 57 points
while shooting 65.S percent (25-for
vS) from the floor, almost all from
long range. The trio scored 18 of
UCLA's first 20 points and 22 of its
lirst 25 in the second half.
UCLA, which took one fewer shot
hut made 14 more than Stanford,
shot 55. y percent from the floor as a
team. Stanford shot 34.8 percent, its
third straight game under 35 percent.
"We could slow the ball down, take
better shots and raise our field goal
percentage," Davis said of the Card
inal. the worst shooting team in the
conference. "But I want to try to play
the same style we're going to play
when we're good."
Other than field goal percentage,
the team statistics were surprisingly
equal. The Bruins outrebounded the
Cardinal, 43-38, but Stanford shot
better from the free throw line (76.7
to (iK.fi percent) and had more steals
(13-1 1).
"We can be competitive some
nights." Davis said. "But everything
has to fall into place for that to hap
pen."

LOS ANGELES — For Stanford,
the best thing about Saturday night's
basketball game against UCLA was
that it ended.
And not a moment too soon.
The final score was 100-71, but it
could have been worse. Had the
turnover-laden crew of UCLA
reserves not seen considerable
playing time, it would have been.
Believe it or not, it was actually a
game for the first 20 minutes, and
Stanford went into the lockerroom at
halftime behind by only 10, 40-30.
But after the Bruins outscored the
Cardinal, 36-8, to open the second
half, the only excitement left was
whether they would score 100 points.
They did, with two second to spare,
when Kevin Butler turned a Cardinal
bad pass into a layup. After Butler
followed in a missed shot with 1:23
remaining to give 96 points, UCLA
students held up four fingers and
began chanting "four more."
When reserve Jeff Dunlap scored
to give them 98 they held up two fin
gers and after Butler's last-second
heroics, the near-capacity crowd of
11,178, most of whom opted to watch
the massacre than beat the traffic,
gave the Bruins a raucous standing
ovation.
UCLA, which avenged last
season's 75-64 loss to Stanford, im
proved its record to 9-7 overall and
6-2 in the Pacific 10 Conference,
good for a three-way tie for first
place.
Stanford, meanwhile, fell to 9-7
overall and 1-5 in the Pac-10. The
Cardinal will try to stay out of the
conference cellar tonight at 8 p.m. by
beating the University of Southern
California — no easy task. USC is 11 -

4 overall, 5-1 in the Pac-10 and can
take over sole possession of first place
with a victory tonight.
So what does Stanford, which has
lost its five conference games by an
average of 18 points, do now? For
getting Saturday night's game was
ever played isn't a bad start.
"I told them not to be too critical of
themselves," Cardinal Coach Tom
Davis said of the 29-point beating,
the worst in his three years at Stan
ford and the Cardinal's 36th straight
loss to UCLA here. "You can't
belabor it too much.
"1 didn't worry about keeping the
spread close," Davis continued. "If
you are going to lose, it doesn't mat
ter what you lose by, whether it's 30
or 15 points."
The loss overshadowed a brilliant
second-half performance by forward
Charles Hunt. Hunt, a senior seeing
the first meaningful playing time of
his career, scored 17 points, including
a Stanford record-setting 11-for-11
from the free throw iine. And all this
in 10 minutes of second-half play.
While Davis could sing the praises
of only one player, UCLA Coach
Walt Hazzard could and did for his
entire team, especially after what he
felt was a lackadaisical effort against
the University of California at
Berkeley two nights earlier.
Although UCLA beat Cal, 80-69,
Hazzard chewed out the Bruins for
not playing hard enough. When cen
ter Brad Wright was asked what Haz
zard said after Thursday's victory,
Wright replied, "No comment."
But on Saturday night, Hazzard
walked into the interview room, sat
down, tipped his chair against the
wall and said, "No complaints
tonight."
"It was something I hoped our

team would pull off," he continued.
"As time progresses, we're getting
the team I'd like to have. The Death
March is paying its dividends."
The "Death March" is what Haz
zard called his. to say the least, rather
difficult pre-Pac-10 schedule. Road
games against St. John's University,
Memphis State University, DePaul
University and Brigham Young Uni
versity left the Bruins with a lot of ex
perience, but only a 3-5 record
entering conference play.
On the other hand, Stanford's com
paratively easy preseason schedule —
one with only one true road game and
two on a neutral court — may not
have prepared it to play teams like
UCLA in arenas like Pauley Pavilion,
where it is 0-20.
When the game began slipping
away from Stanford early in the
second half, the Cardinal simply lost
control. After the Bruins scored 1 3 of
the first 17 second-half points, Davis
called a timeout.
"They were totally in a fog, totally
disrupted." Davis said of his players.
"I just told them to play their game
and not worry about the score. If you
try to make up 20 points in a minute,
all of a sudden you're down by 30.
You just have to stay in your game."
