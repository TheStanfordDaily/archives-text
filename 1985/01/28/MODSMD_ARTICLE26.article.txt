## cellar for Card 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
LOS ANGELES — Late in the
second half of USC's basketball
game here against the University of
California at Berkeley Saturday af
ternoon, the Trojans were cruising
toward their fifth Pacific 10 Confer

ence victory in six tries with a
seemingly insurmountable 12-point
lead.
Suddenly, CaJ made a last-gasp
run and cut the University of South
ern California's lead to 77-75 with
45 seconds remaining. Time out,
use.

A year ago, the Trojans — who
play host to Stanford tonight at 8 —
might have lost that game. But this
is the 1984-85 season at USC, and
last year's 11-20 overall and 6-12
Pac-10 records are only bad
memories.
Instead of folding against Cal Sat
urday, USC returned to the court
following Coach Stan Morrison's
timeout and calmly executed a full
court inbounds play that resulted in
a two-handed slam dunk by forward
Derrick Dowell. The Trojans also
made five of six free throws down
the stretch, and point guard Larry
Friend added a lay-in at the buzzer
to give USC an 86-80 victory.
The only difference between the
Trojans of this season and the
Trojans of last season is their
record. With one-third of the Pac
-10 schedule complete, USC is> 11-4
overall and in a three-way .tiejfof
first place in the Pac-10 with a ?>-l
conference record. At this time last
year, it was 8-11 and 2-4.
One thing that hasn't changed,
for the most part, is the personnel.
The Trojans lost one letterman —
Cedric Bailey — from last season's
team and added a pair of freshmen
and a junior college transfer. Other
than that, 13 players returned for
this season.
"I think just being a year older
and everyone playing a more com
plete game is the biggest differ
ence," said 6-foot-8 forward Wayne
Carlander, who averages 15.9
points and 7.2 rebounds per game.
"I also think that this year we're
more of a five-man offensive team,"
Carlander said. "We don't look for
just one or two players, so teams
can't pack it (defense) in against us
and concentrate on one or two
guys."

Saturday's game was a case in
point. Carlander, 19 points short of
becoming USC's No. 3 all-time
scorer, was held to two points in the
first half and 1 1 for the game. In his
place. Dowell picked up the slack —
he scored a career-high 28 points
and had 13 rebounds.
"I'm never satisfied," the unas
suming Dowell said after the game,
"because I always try to do better."
His performance isn't the only
thing on which Dowell casts a skepti
cal shadow. "We're struggling as a
team." he said. "We can't play 40
minutes of basketball. We're
playing about 25 or 30 minutes per
game and letting other teams back
in the game."
Stanford, meanwhile, seems to be
having problems playing well for
even a few minutes. After Satur
day's* IUO-71 loss to UCLA
chopped jts. record to 9-7 overall
and 1-5 in the Pac-10, the Cardinal
will be trying to regain respect
ability against a Trojan team it
hasn't defeated in Los Angeles since
1976.
Although Stanford has problems
such as shooting, its biggest task
tonight might be staying in the game
and not getting blown out again.
USC, which has used the same start
ing five (Carlander, Dowell, Friend,
Ron Holmes and Clayton Olivier),
is a steady, experienced team with
an offense potentially as explosive
as UCLA's was Saturday night.
Still. Morrison is not taking the
Cardinal lightly. "As I told the
team," he said Saturday, "we beat
Cal by six, and they beat Stanford
by 15. Therefore, we should beat
Stanford by 21 Monday.
"And if you believe that, I've got
some swampland in Florida I want
to show you."
