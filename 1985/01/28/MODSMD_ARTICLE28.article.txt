## Defense paces win over Gaels 
### JOHN LIS Staff sportswriter 
MORAGA — The Stanford
women's basketball team won its
fourth consecutive game Friday
night the way it has won most of
the time this year — with defense.
The Cardinal allowed only 14
points in the first half and coasted
to a victory, 61-54, over St. Mary's
College at McKeon Pavilion here.
"Our 3-2 defense matched up
with their 1-3-1 offense," Coach
Dotty McCrea said. "Even if they
got the ball to the corners, we had
it covered. They made some good
adjustments to it at halftime.
"Our man-to-man was great.
We do a good job on the defensive
boards. If we keep people from
getting second shots, we do well."
"We didn't do anything differ
ent," Cardinal forward Mary
Bradach said. "We just gave them
one shot, and they weren't hot the
first half,"
How good was the Stanford
defense? In a 10-and-a-half
minute stretch of the first half, it
allowed St. Mary's only one bas
ket. Two points in one-fourth of
the game. And from the 10 min
ute, 51 second mark to the 4:21
mark of the half, the Gaels did not
score.
As a result, Stanford opened a
31-14 lead at halftime. The Card
inal held St. Mary's to 21 percent
shooting from the field, and the
Gaels made only three shots
outside of five feet in the half.
Stanford took its biggest lead of
the night with 5:59 left in the
game at 52-33. McCrea then went
to her bench, and the Gaels began
to close the gap but couldn't catch
up.
"In the first half we moved the
ball and set screens," Bradach
said. "In the second half the
movement stopped. We didn't run
through the break. We forgot the
little things. We got choppy — we
didn't stay with what we were
doing."
"The last five minutes we were
basically disorganized," McCrea

said. "We had people there who
hadn't had a lot of game experi
ence this year. We have to stay or
ganized — they panicked. Now
they know. It was a good learning
experience. We had this team
beat. You win by seven or you win
by 20 — and everyone got to
play."
Forward Kami Anderson led
Stanford in scoring with 20 points,
getting most of her points on 15-
to 18-foot jump shots from the left
side. Bradach was the only other
player in double figures, with 12.
Bradach also pulled down 12
rebounds to pace Stanford, which
outrebounded St. Mary's 48-41.
Anderson had nine rebounds, and
center Karen Goedewaagen
finished with seven.
Stanford was playing its third
game in five days. Usually,
the Cardinal plays twice a week. "I
think we were a little tired,"
McCrea said. "Our shooting was
off. For being tired, I think we
played well."
Guard Virginia Sourlis led Stan
ford with five assists, but she had a
sub-par scoring night, finishing
with six points after having scored
a career-high 29 Wednesday at the
University of the Pacific.
Sourlis summed up the way the
Cardinal has been playing over the
last four games: "Our offense has
looked good the last couple of
games," she said. "We have the
potential to score 65 points a
night. It's all coming together.
We're moving the ball, taking the
right shot, waiting for the shot.
"The defense has been consis
tent. We're boxing out in
rebounding. Holding a team to
one shot a possession lets us fast
break. We're getting better in the
running game, and we're being
selective in our shots. I think that's
the difference."
Stanford, now 9-8 overall,
returns to Western Collegiate
Athletic Association play Friday
in Los Angeles against UCLA.
The Cardinal's next home game is
Feb. 9 against San Diego State.
