## Stanford wins UCSB invite for first time 
### ROB GRAHAM Stuff sportswriter 
In what Co-Coach Don Shaw
called "the biggest men's college
tournament anywhere," the Stanford
men's volleyball team defied both
tradition and the pollsters yesterday
when it swept to victory in the Santa
Barbara/Michelob Light Collegiate
Invitational.
On its way to victory, the men, who
last week were ranked sixth nation
ally in preseason polls, won seven of
eight games. In the process, the Card
inal defeated four teams that were
ranked ahead of it. The University of
Hawaii, the University of California
at Santa Barbara, the University of
Southern California and UCLA were
all victims of Stanford's surpris
ing march to the championship.
On Friday, the men placed second
in their bracket behind the University
of Manitoba (Canada) and so were
able to advance to Saturday's play
still entertaining hopes of victory. It
was on Friday that the Card suffered
its lone set-back of the tournament, a
two-set loss at the hands of Manitoba.
But Stanford saved its best for Sat
urday, a day Shaw called the
"greatest in Stanford men's volleyball
history." In the morning the men
downed UCSB, the host school, 16-
14, 15-2, to get into the champion
ship semifinals. Once in the semifinal
round, the Cardinal edged USC in a
three-set thriller. In that "tight
match" against the Trojans, Stanford

pulled out the win with a 16-14 third
set effort.
After besting USC, the men con
fronted UCLA in the final. History
was against the Cardinal. The Bruins
had won the Santa Barbara Invite the
last seven years and are four-time
defending national champions.
What's more, the Cardinal had never
before finished better than sixth in
the tourney.
But after years of anonymous
struggle, the underdog Cardinal fi
nally came out on top. After splitting
the first two sets in the best-of-five
set match, the men rallied to take the
final two sets and the tournament,
15-10, 2-15, 15-5, 15-9.
Shaw hopes the victory previews a
new, successful era for Stanford vol
leyball. "More than anything," he
said, "this gives us confidence — we
know now that we can beat anybody,
that we have the talent."
Stanford had to overcome what
Shaw felt was his team's most serious
weakness, a lack of depth.
"Endurance was a factor; we really
went with basically seven guys. They
proved they were in pretty good
shape."
Standout performances were
handed in by preseason Ail-
American Jon Root, second team
Ail-American Craig Lauchner and
freshmen Scott Fortune; each gar
nered All-Tournament team honors.
In addition. Root was named the
Invite's Most Valuable Player.
