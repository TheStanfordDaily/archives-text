# Doctors save heart
## 
### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER Senior staff writer 
Because of the kindness of cardiac surgeons
at the Stanford Medical Center and some quick
fund raising by the Polish Assistance League in
California, Piotr Sternik has a properly func
tioning heart.
The six-year-old received part of a donor's
heart in a five-hour operation at the medical
center on Friday. Sternik was suffering from a
congenital heart defect that prevents much of
the body's blood from reaching the lungs.
Hospital officials asked for $25,000 before
conducting the surgery, and the league provided
the money by soliciting donations.
The Medical Center News Bureau reported
yesterday that Sternik was in stable, but critical
condition after undergoing a second operation.
The two-hoUr operation was needed to stop

some internal arterial bleeding.
"An artery had a little leak. . . . One of his
valves was faulty," said Shirley Kraus of the
news bureau.
Sternik was responding to nurses with
gestures and was groggy yesterday afternoon.
Kraus said it is uncertain when he will he fully
awake. Sternik's vital signs were stable.
His mother. Helina Sternik, was at the medi
cal center Sunday waiting for her son to awaken
from the anesthesia. Neither Peter nor his
mother speaks English.
His father, Michal, a former member of the
Polish Solidarity Labor Union, has been a taxi
driver since he lost his job in 1981.
Sternik had undergone surgery in the past to
allow him to survive the first six years
of his life, but doctors decided he
would need a donated part to correct
the defect, an unusual combination of
a hole in the heart and misplaced ar
teries.
Sternik's first operation here was
performed by a group headed by
Norman Shumway, chairman of car
diovascular surgery.
When Sternik had to return to the
operating table on Sunday, John
Macoviak, a cardiac surgeon, was in
charge.
"Shumway has done quite a few

(operations like the one performed
on Sternik), but I'm not sure if it
would be called routine," Kraus said.
Sternik and his mother have been
in the area since the end of last
month. His father has been getting
updates by phone.
If all goes as expected, Sternik may
be able to return to Poland next
month. The open-heart operations
should enable him to lead a normal
life. He is currently not on medica
tion.
In addition to the Polish Assistance
League donation, the United Food
and Commercial Workers Union in
San Francisco promised up to $5,000,
and composer Burt Bacharach has
pledged $1,000, the Times Tribune
reported Friday.
