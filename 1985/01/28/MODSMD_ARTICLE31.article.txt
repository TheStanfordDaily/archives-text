### PETER CASTILLO Staff sportswriter 
At the end of Friday's competition, Stanford
wrestling Coach Chris Horpel looked dejected by
his team's performance as it first tied Humboldt
State University 22-22 and then lost to Fullerton
State Univerity 24-19. The next day the pendulum
swung the other way as the Cardinal had its best
placing in the All-California Invitational by taking
second.
•'I expected a battle against Humboldt and you
cannot get much closer than that," Homel said.
"We are a much better team than Fullerton, but we
let them beat us. I am not taking anything away
from Fullerton, for they wrestled well. There is no
excuse for why we lost. Our upper weights did a
great job of playing catch up, but we needed more
from the other guys."
•Stanford ended the tournament with 84.25
points, behind Cal State Bakersfield with 88.75
points and Fullerton was a distant third with 57
points. Jeff Bradley (134 pounds) won his division
and was named the tournament's outstanding
wrestler. Bakersfield had one more wrestler than
Stanford in the finals and that made the difference.
The Cardinal began each meet with a 6-0 deficit
because B.G. Porter (118 pounds) had to forfeit

with a rib injury. At 12ft pounds, Neil Wartnik suf
fered two defeats, to Nick Perez of Humboldt, 8-2.
and to Fullerton State's Louie Mecado, 14-3.
Stanford's Jeff Bradley suffered a rare loss, to
Humboldt's Steve Meckel. 12-4. This loss was a
shock to Bradley because he beat Meckel, 10-1. in
the Doc Peterson Invitational Jan. 5 in Chico. I he
loss, though, might have inspired him for his next
match — he pinned Rob Simpson with 10 seconds
remaining in the match.
Against Humboldt's Ron Hughes. Cardinal Scott
Wiggen (142 pounds) suffered a 9-3 defeat. He
also rebounded. 10-2, over Dan Hatano. That vic
tory tied the Cardinal with Fullerton. 10-10, but
that was as close as Stanford got.
Stanford's Jeff Hazard (150 pounds) was
defeated by Fullerton's Mitch Pagano. 21-ft, after
beating Eric Lessley. 8-3. Cardinal Pete Rogers
(158 pounds) overpowered his Humboldt op
ponent. Jerry Savers, for a 6-3 victory. Rogers
nearly scored an escape for a tie at the buzzer
against Darren Lindsey, but lost 5-4.
The most consistent wrestler for Stanford was
167-pounder Dave Lee, but Coach Horpel still saw
room for improvement.
"For Lee. the question is how long is it going to
take him to believe in himself. He does not beat

people as badl\ as he can," he said. "He needs to
heat them badiv. for when he wrestles a tough op
ponent he can go hard and avoid a close match in
which a fluke can cause him to lose."
Lee scored a technical pin against Brant Butter,
16-1, then heat Brent Bieshaar 12-3. At 177
pounds, Tom Mullen took a 8-0 victory over Hum
boldt's Ramh Valley and beat Dan Coates. 10-4.
and was the onl> other Cardinal double winner.
Kurt Kassulke (190 pounds) came out inspired
against Dan Wolf of Humboldt and went on to 19-
2 technical pin. which gave Stanford a 22-16 lead
over Humboldt. At that point, heavyweight Terry
Mclntyre onl\ needed to avoid a bad loss or a pin
for a Cardinal victory.
Mclntyre staved close for two periods and trailed
Rad Vrnjak 9-4. Mclntyre might have wrestled too
aggressiveh in going for a victory instead of avoid
ing a pin, and Vrnjak scored a pin 44 seconds into
the final period for six points and a tie between the
teams.
Against Fullerton. Kassulke lost to Dan Coates,
5-1. and Mclntyre tied Rocky Flint. 5-5, in a match
in which Mclntyre almost scored a two-point
takedown at the buzzer.
