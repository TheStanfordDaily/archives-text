# Men fencers sweep two; women settle for split
## 
### ERIK ESELIUS Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford men's fencing team improved its record to
11-1 by sweeping past Fullerton State University and the
Air Force Academy while the women now have a 9-2
record after splitting their two dual meets, heating Fuller
ton State and narrowly losing to Air Force.
Against Fullerton State, both teams recorded impres
sive scores with Stanford men notching a 22-5 rout, and
the women posting an 11 -5 victory, aided by four forfeited
bouts by the Titans who only suited three fencers.
With its victory over the Titans however, the Cardinal
women lost their No. 2 starter. Holly Taylor, to a pulled
hamstring. Alyson Yarus, the No. 5 fencer, came in and
was credited for three victories against one loss. Captain
Jennifer Yu rolled along winning all four of her bouts.
Chris Gillen and Russell Houlston both recorded three
iclories, paving the way to a 9-0 shutout in the men's foil
competition. In his three bouts, Houlston gave up only
one touch in what Stanford Head Coach Buzz Hurst
would liken to "shooting a hole in one in golf — a little bit
luck, but you're still rolling."
The Cardinal men's sabre team finished 7-2 while the
epee team wound up 6-3. Hurst was pleased with the
overall impressiveness of the Cardinal men's victory over
the Titans.
"We were definitely up for it psychologically. . . . We
thumped them. It wasn't because Fullerton was weak, we
were just quite strong."
The Cardinal men maintained their momentum against
Air Force, ranked 15th in the Fencing News Coaches Poll,
to win 18-9, the largest margin of victory ever recorded by
Stanford against a Falcon team.

Led hy Elliot Cheu's three victories, the Cardinal men
came away 6-3 in the foil, the Falcon's most talented unit
according to Hurst.
The epee squad fell victim to what Hurst called "the
slow-start syndrome" and lost 4-5. The sabre team, led hy
Steve Levitan and Craig Miott who posted three victories
apiece, ended up 8-1. Levitan, who also won three houts
against Fullerton State, highlighted the meet by overcom
ing a chipped tooth to win an inconsequential bout.
"Steve had a hell of a night," Hurst said. "He went on a
roll — fenced very well. When he chipped his tooth, I was
trying to get him to forfeit and take it easy, but he insisted
to fence. Courageous performance."
With the loss of Taylor, the Cardinal women also
needed some gutsy performances, but instead fell just
short of Air Force 9-7.
"I needed the third and fourth fencers to perform over
their heads — didn't quite get that," Hurst said.
"Psycologically, we were thrown off by not having Holly."
"Technically, they're not an awe-inspiring team." Hurst
said. "But all four girls started last year so they had a lot
of experience."
Yu once again recorded four victories and Meagan
Levitan, in what Hurst called "her best performance thus
far," won two bouts.
According to Hurst, the Cardinal fencing teams have
"passed the real peak of the season" and should do quite
well with the remaining opponents on the schedule. The
Cardinal will face the University of San Fransico and the
University of Texas, San Antonio this Saturday on the
road.

Stanford's Jennifer Yu went 8-0 in the two fencing matches this weekend, but it wasn't enough to make up
for the loss of sophomore Holly Taylor to an injury as the Cardinal lost one of the two matches.
