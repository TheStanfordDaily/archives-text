## Men and women both win 
### CAROLYN TARKINGTON 
It was a successful Saturday for
the Stanford men's gymnastics
team, hut the Cardinal women
didn't have the same fortune, ac
cording to their coach, even though
they had the same result.
In their competition at Maples
Pavilion, the Stanford men's indi
vidual performances were the key
to their second-place finish to
Fullerton State University.
The Cardinal women were not as
successful in Chico Saturday. "We
had a lot of misses," women's Head
Coach Homer Sardina said, "and
ended up finishing in second place
to a team we could have beaten."
The Cardinal women scored
161.00 points, and Chico State
University had 162.70. Eastern
Washington University scored
152.45.
In the men's meet, Stanford
scored 271 points, and Fullerton
had 273.40. San Jose State Univer
sity was third with 237.60 points.
Cardinal junior Jon Levy was the
highlight of the evening. His strong
and consistent performances gained
a first-place finish in the all-around,
in which he compiled a score of

56.60, one tenth of a point from his
personal best.
"I was on tonight," Levy said. "I
felt good physically." Levy joked
that his performances could be at
tributed to having eaten a meal
about an hour before the meet. He
also said his teammates have been
progressing well in workouts and
were supportive throughout the
competition.
"Jon has the potential to score
even higher on all of the events,"
Head Coach Sadeo Hamada said.
Hamada also commented on the
small audience. "I am really
ashamed that the student body isn't
more supportive of our team. Many
of our gymnasts' routines are of
Olympic caliber. Stanford men's
gymnastics is the best it ever has
been,"he said.
In the individual events. Levy
placed first in the floor, rings and
high-bar events with scores of 9.40,
9.65 and 9.K, respectively, and tied
for first on the vault with Stanford
junior Gary Smith at 9.5. Levy also
placed third on parallel bars with a
9.2. Cardinal sophomore Randy
Besosa also had good perfor
mances, placing first in the parallel

bars and second on the high bar
with a 9.55 and a 9.65. Stanford
gymnasts took first place in all
events except the pommel horse.
â€¢'1 was very proud of the team,"
Hamada said, "and especially im
pressed with Mark Arnold, Mike
Matzek, Chuck Gerardo and
Randy Besosa for hitting their
routines so well despite the minor
injuries that have been hindering
their workouts."
For the Cardinal women, finish
ing second in the all-around were
Laura Putnam and Cindy Boyd,
with 32.90 scores. In the individual
events, Putnam was second in the
floor exercise with an 8.7, Boyd
placed second on vault and bars
with an 8.55 and an 8.25, Nanci
Goldsmith was first on the beam
and third on the bars with 8.60 and
8.15 and Robin Close placed first
on vault with an 8.80.
"1 was very proud of Laura Put
nam," Sardina said. "She displayed
a great deal of aggressiveness and
has potential to do very well this
season."
Sardina said the women's team
needs to work on approaching
routines more aggressively.
