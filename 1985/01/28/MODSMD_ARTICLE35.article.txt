## Tau Beta Pi honors society celebrates 100th anniversary By GREGORY WEINGARTEN Staff writer 
### 
The traditional Tau Beta Pi yell:
Ammeter, Indicator, Wye Level U'vc.
Slide Rule, Dynamo, Tan Beta I'i!
Although most Tau Beta Pi members aren't able to re
member their "traditional yell." they could probably ex
pand upon the short-circuit admittance parameters for a
two-part network.
Tau Beta Pi is the national honors society for engineers.
The organization was founded in 1 SSS by Dr. Edward
Williams at Lehigh University in Pennsylvania. Williams
wanted to give recognition to outstanding engineering stu
dents in a way similar to the recognition afforded b\ Phi
Beta Kappa in the liberal arts and sciences.
Tau Beta Pi now includes collegiate chapters at ISM in
stitutions and a total initiated membership of more than
2N4.000. The Stanford Chapter (California Gamma) cele
brated its 50th anniver. ary last Fnday night by throwing a
Party at Terman Auditorium. They also purchased three
picnic tables to be placed on the patio of Nuts and Mud.
Terman Engineering Center's snack bar. Each table is
hand-stenciled with the logos representing the different
engineering divisions.
Members of the organization are drawn from the top
one-eighth of the junior engineering class and the top fifth
of the senior engineering class. Students in this category
gain membership through a short initiation ceremony
which takes place in the winter and spring. In the cere
mony. the students read a secret pledge which is later col-

lected. This year, there are about 100 Tau Beta Pi mem
bers. hut about 30 more are expected to join during spring
initiation.
The benefits Tau Beta Pi members mention include ex
panded job opportunities.
• Some companies like to recruit Tau Beta Pi members.
We have a resume book with all the Tau Beta Pi members
in Northern California which many companies buy," said
Matt Gordon, the Stanford chapter's secretary of initia
tion.
Gordon added that the best engineers don't stay en
gineers. "After 10 years, they go on to become
managers." he said.
Because of the organization's name, many think it is a
fraternity. Gordon said.
"Very often when we reserve rooms, we have to
reassure the hotel we're an honors society and not a fra
ternity," Gordon said.
According to Stanford's chapter president, Gigi Wang,
the organization stresses service above all. Every year, the
group conducts three student service projects — a course
guide for engineers, a tutoring center at Terman and an
award given for undergraduate excellence in teaching.
This year, an initiation project is planned to bring San
Jose high school students to visit Stanford.
And. of course, as any Tau Beta Pi member will tell
you, there is the "little Big Game" between the Stanford
and Berkeley Tau Beta Pi chapters around Big Game
time. Although Stanford lost to Berkeley this year, 6-0,

the Stanford Chapter managed to steal the "engineering
axe" from Berkeley's team.
" They still don't know we have [the axe]," said Wang,
who is sending Berkeley's team a photograph of the
coveted possession.

Gordon conceded that members of the society are often
stereotyped as "nerds" with "slide rules hanging on to
their pant loops."
"People think [Phi Beta Tau members] are brains, but
they're reallv a lot of fun," he added.
