# Gavilan house sponsors two children
## 
### CARL LEE 
Instead of using all their dorm
money to buy potato chips and beer,
members of Gavilan house, in
Florence Moore Hall, have decided
to put their purchasing power to a
more constructive use.
For the past few months the resi
dents of Gavilan have been sponsor
ing two underprivileged children
overseas. Under the direction of
freshman house member Michael In.
Gavilan has been trying to better the
lives of these children by sending
them money and other forms of aid.
The idea began when residents of
Gavilan began thinking about the
world problems of starvation and the
lack of education faced by many
people overseas. These topics hit the
group hard when a house member,
angered after seeing an advertise
ment for Cabbage Patch Kids
remarked that "people could spend
much less mone\ by sponsoring a real
human being."
From these ideas, Lu. who had
sponsored children before, decided to
initiate a dorm sponsorship of a child.
The Save the Children organization
was contacted in San Francisco, and
their legitimacy was examined. After
receiving information from the or
ganization, I.u brought up the matter
in a dorm meeting. The proposal to
sponsor a child was well received and
unanimously approved. The next step

was to contact the Save the Children
offices to get more specific informa
tion on the children that could be
sponsored.
■'Everyone was really enthusiastic
about the idea of trying to help create
a future for some unfortunate child,"
said Lu "Each person was really in
terested in getting involved. We felt
that it w as sort of a responsibility," he
added.
In fact, Gavilan felt it enough of a
responsibility to sponsor two children
from overseas. They decided to spon
sor a child from both Nepal and Sri
Lanka: one boy, and one girl.
"This type of sponsorship is very
easy for a large group of people to
become involved in." said Lu. "It
costs very little and can do so much."
Sponsoring a child costs $16 a
month per child. This results in each
person in the 45-member house
having to pay about 67 cents per
month in order to sponsor two
children. Of the money that is sent
overseas. SO percent goes directly to
the children. Another 10 percent is
used by the Save the Children offices
in each country to help raise food for
the people and to show them ways of
growing their own food. The final 10
percent is used to improve the educa
onal facilities of the towns.
I he Save the Children organization
is more personal than manv other

sponsorship programs, according to
I.u. The members of Gavilan get
pictures of their children and a
pamphlet about the country and its
people. "In our program, we get

pictures, a personal story and we can
even write to the children and they'll
write us back," said Lu.
The Gavilan children are a four
year-old Sinhala boy named Lasantha
and a 10-year-old Nepalese girl
named Santa. Lasantha has a family

of seven. His nourishment consists of
one daily meal of rice with a smaller
meal later in the day. Food and water
are very scarce. There are many
problems in Lasantha's village of

Watareka. However, the funds that
are being distributed by the Save the
Children organization are helping to
improve the quality of life in the vil
lage.
Santa lives in a little village called
Takukot located 150 miles from

Nepal's capital, Kathmandu. She and
her parents live in a mud plank house
and eat only two meals a day. Santa's
father and mother work very hard on
their farm while Santa helps to take

care of the house. She has not had an
opportunity to attend school. In
Takutot money from sponsorships is
used to improve health-care and
agricultural techniques.
Members of Gavilan seem to feel
fulfilled by their sponsorship. They

are happy to have given money to
help the two children have a
future. "Every person in the dorm
gave their support to the project,"
said Lu. "It was a group effort from
the start."
In fact, the project seems to be so
well-suited to a group environment
such as a dorm that many other
residences have decided to sponsor
children. Three other houses in
Florence Moore have begun spon
sorships as well as money other
dorms around campus.
Other people in Gavilan also
believed that the sponsorship was
easily accomplished in a dorm envi
ronment. "It was very easily done and
it united us in a common project,"
said Molly Brown, a Gavilan resident.
"We all feel good about improving
these children's lives."
Another Gavilan resident stressed
the practicality of the situation. "We
have the opportunity to help Third
World nations as private citizens
rather than through government
funding," said Lee Rawitscher. "We
have a chance to help these kids and
also to learn about what goes on in
their society."
The predominant feeling of the res
idents of Gavilan was expressed by
Scott Bornstein who said, "It was an
easy choice for all of us. You could
buy a beer, or you could help save a
life."

sponsor a child was well received and
unanimously approved. The next step

was to contact the Save the Children
offices to get more specific informa
tion on the children that could be
sponsored.
■'Everyone was really enthusiastic
about the idea of trying to help create
a future for some unfortunate child,"
said Lu "Each person was really in
terested in getting involved. We felt
that it w as sort of a responsibility," he
added.
In fact, Gavilan felt it enough of a
responsibility to sponsor two children
from overseas. They decided to spon
sor a child from both Nepal and Sri
Lanka: one boy, and one girl.
"This type of sponsorship is very
easy for a large group of people to
become involved in." said Lu. "It
costs very little and can do so much."
Sponsoring a child costs $16 a
month per child. This results in each
person in the 45-member house
having to pay about 67 cents per
month in order to sponsor two
children. Of the money that is sent
overseas. SO percent goes directly to
the children. Another 10 percent is
used by the Save the Children offices
in each country to help raise food for
the people and to show them ways of
growing their own food. The final 10
percent is used to improve the educa
onal facilities of the towns.
I he Save the Children organization
is more personal than manv other

sponsorship programs, according to
I.u. The members of Gavilan get
pictures of their children and a
pamphlet about the country and its
people. "In our program, we get

pictures, a personal story and we can
even write to the children and they'll
write us back," said Lu.
The Gavilan children are a four
year-old Sinhala boy named Lasantha
and a 10-year-old Nepalese girl
named Santa. Lasantha has a family

of seven. His nourishment consists of
one daily meal of rice with a smaller
meal later in the day. Food and water
are very scarce. There are many
problems in Lasantha's village of

Watareka. However, the funds that
are being distributed by the Save the
Children organization are helping to
improve the quality of life in the vil
lage.
Santa lives in a little village called
Takukot located 150 miles from

Nepal's capital, Kathmandu. She and
her parents live in a mud plank house
and eat only two meals a day. Santa's
father and mother work very hard on
their farm while Santa helps to take

care of the house. She has not had an
opportunity to attend school. In
Takutot money from sponsorships is
used to improve health-care and
agricultural techniques.
Members of Gavilan seem to feel
fulfilled by their sponsorship. They

are happy to have given money to
help the two children have a
future. "Every person in the dorm
gave their support to the project,"
said Lu. "It was a group effort from
the start."
In fact, the project seems to be so
well-suited to a group environment
such as a dorm that many other
residences have decided to sponsor
children. Three other houses in
Florence Moore have begun spon
sorships as well as money other
dorms around campus.
Other people in Gavilan also
believed that the sponsorship was
easily accomplished in a dorm envi
ronment. "It was very easily done and
it united us in a common project,"
said Molly Brown, a Gavilan resident.
"We all feel good about improving
these children's lives."
Another Gavilan resident stressed
the practicality of the situation. "We
have the opportunity to help Third
World nations as private citizens
rather than through government
funding," said Lee Rawitscher. "We
have a chance to help these kids and
also to learn about what goes on in
their society."
The predominant feeling of the res
idents of Gavilan was expressed by
Scott Bornstein who said, "It was an
easy choice for all of us. You could
buy a beer, or you could help save a
life."

Instead of using all their dorm
money to buy potato chips and beer,
members of Gavilan house, in
Florence Moore Hall, have decided
to put their purchasing power to a
more constructive use.
For the past few months the resi
dents of Gavilan have been sponsor
ing two underprivileged children
overseas. Under the direction of
freshman house member Michael In.
Gavilan has been trying to better the
lives of these children by sending
them money and other forms of aid.
The idea began when residents of
Gavilan began thinking about the
world problems of starvation and the
lack of education faced by many
people overseas. These topics hit the
group hard when a house member,
angered after seeing an advertise
ment for Cabbage Patch Kids
remarked that "people could spend
much less mone\ by sponsoring a real
human being."
From these ideas, Lu. who had
sponsored children before, decided to
initiate a dorm sponsorship of a child.
The Save the Children organization
was contacted in San Francisco, and
their legitimacy was examined. After
receiving information from the or
ganization, I.u brought up the matter
in a dorm meeting. The proposal to
sponsor a child was well received and
unanimously approved. The next step

was to contact the Save the Children
offices to get more specific informa
tion on the children that could be
