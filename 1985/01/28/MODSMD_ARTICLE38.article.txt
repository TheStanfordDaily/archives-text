# Groups apply for ASSU fees
## Requests for money down from last year 
### TROY EID Daily staff 
The ASSU Senate has received 16
special fee applications for considera
tion on the spring ballot. Senate
Chair Eric Berg said last night.
Of the applicants. Berg said the
Chaparral, Stanford Axe Committee
and ASSU Shuttle Service are sub
mitting applications for the first time,
and three groups that did not win fee
assessments last spring — Stanford
in-Government. the Tuesday Great
Directors Film Series and the
Women's Center — will make an
other try.
k/.SU's application "asks for much
more money this year," and the
ASSU Speaker's Bureau "may also
ask for more," according to Berg.
The Rape Education Project, The
Daily and the Band have asked for
assessments, but "for less money than
last year," Berg said. Three other
groups — the Guest Professor
Bureau, Concert Network and Stan

ford Arms Control and Disarmament
Forum — aren't requesting assess
ments this year.
The other groups are: ASSU Legal
Counseling; the Black Student
Union; Club Sports; the Graduate
Student Association; and Stanford
United for Rape Elimination. In ad
dition, the ASSU Course Guide "may
submit a request," Berg said.
Berg, who did not elaborate on the
individual proposals, said the re
quests total about $472.000. or about
$60,000 less than last year. He noted
that of the $533,000 in requests on
last spring's ballot, $441,000 was ac
tually collected.
The ASSU Senate Appropriations
Committee will interview representa
tives of the groups filing special fee
applications this week. Berg said.
That committee is slated to deliver its
recommendations to the senate Feb.
12.
Most groups must then submit peti
tions in support of their fee assess

ment proposals to the senate. If the
senate votes to support a particular
group's fee assessment, that group
would be required to obtain the
signatures of 10 percent of the stu
dent body — both undergraduates
and graduates — to make the ballot,
he said.
If the senate does not approve a
given proposal, that group could still
make the ballot by submitting peti
tions with the backing of 20 percent
of the student body.
But there is an exception. Groups
that received more than a 60 percent
vote of the student body in last year's
or in the most recent fee assessment
and are asking for "substantially the
same amount" this year will not need
to submit petitions if the Senate
decides to place them on the ballot,
Berg said.
"Substantially the same amount" is
adjusted for inflation plus 10 percent,
he said.
