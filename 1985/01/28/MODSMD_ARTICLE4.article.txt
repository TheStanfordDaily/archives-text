# Suspended
## Phi Delts put on probation 
### JEFF BIDDULPH Staff writer 
Alleging that the Phi Delta Theta
fraternity pressured its pledges "to
drink large amounts of alcohol in a
short time span" during the first week
of winter quarter, the University put
the fraternity on probation Friday.
"Such an activity clearly falls
within the definition of hazing,"
Norm Robinson, associate dean of
student affairs and director of Resi
dential Education, wrote to Ed
Bendy, the Phi Delts' president, on
Friday.
The fraternity will now be
restricted from having any parties or
social gatherings, whether open to
fraternity members or the entire
campus. Bendy said that he has met
with Robinson and that the fraternity
may be allowed to hold parties where
alcohol is not served.
Robinson also hinted that stricter
action may be taken against the Phi
Delts. "The alleged incident raises
the question of whether the house at
680 Lomita Drive should be reas
signed next year or whether Phi Delta
Theta should be allowed to continue
to occupy that facility, and if so, un
der what conditions," Robinson
wrote to Bendy.
Phi Delta Theta is the third frater
nity to be placed on probation at
Stanford this academic year.
Steve Leonhardt, the resident as
sistant at the Phi Delt house, said the
alleged incident took place during a
drinking game at the fraternity.
"Pledges were told that they didn't
have to participate and some didn't
participate," Leonhardt said.
When asked how University offi
cials found out about the alleged inci
dent, Leonhardt said, "That's a very
good question. I think everybody in
the Phi Delts is wondering about that
right now. There were many people
in the fraternity talking about pledge
activities, and apparently somebody

on campus picked that up and told
the University."
Bendy said the University's action
against the Phi Delts is an overreac
tion.
"They heard it second-hand. We're
being used as an example," Bendy
said. "Other fraternities may have
done things that are 10 times worse
than what we do, but because Norm
(Robinson) hasn't heard of it.he
can't act on it."
Bendy said he was concerned be
cause the University was putting the
fraternity on probation before the In
terfraternity Council (IFC) had inves
tigated the matter.
"We haven't been [proven] guilty
of anything yet," he said.
Bendy declined to comment when
asked whether the fraternity had ac
tually committed the alleged viola
tions.
"The University is adopting a
shoot-first, ask-questions-later
policy," Bendy said. "The fraternity
feels that the IFC investigation will
show that the matter is not as serious
as the University perceives it to be."
However, Robinson wrote to
Bendy that "the severity of this
response should not come as a
surprise to you."
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said in a meeting with frater
nity presidents Nov. 15 that "hazing
in any form would not be tolerated,
and that if we had reason to believe
that a group had engaged in it,
suspension of privileges would
precede, not follow, fact finding and
discussion," Robinson reminded
Bendy.
Rick Hoskins, the president of the
IFC, said in a letter written to Robin
son over the weekend that the Uni
versity's "decision to place Phi Delta
Theta on social probation stems from
highly ambiguous circumstances, and
with little regard to the efforts that
the Interfraternity Council has made
to deal with the issues of drinking and
controlled behavior."
Hoskins said that "giving Dean
Lyons' discussion from Nov. 15,
1984, as a justification for such a rash
decision is very questionable."
University officials did not elabo
rate on how pledges were pressured
into drinking the alcohol.
Diana Conklin, assistant dean of
student affairs and director of the
Row, said only that there "was some
group pressure to consume a lot of al
cohol very quickly."
"Hazing is viewed by the Univer
sity as being extremely serious," Con
klin said. "We're trying to get the
message across that it won't be
tolerated. Not in any form and not by
any group."
Hazing is prohibited by California
state law and University policy. The
Stanford Fraternity guide, distributed
annually to each fraternity, says that
"pressuring anyone to consume alco
hol or drugs" is considered hazing.
The action against the Phi Delts
follows a number of University inves
tigations of other fraternities here.
The University put Beta Theta Pi on
probation Nov. 14 after five women
complained that a drunken party goer
there grabbed at their clothes.

The University planned similar ac
tion against Delta Kappa Epsilon as a
result of a different incident there
Nov. 9, but this was put "in
abeyance" after the IFC adopted
guidelines calling for monitoring of
parties. The University subsequently
lifted Beta Theta Pi's probation.
Delta Upsilon placed itself on
probation, with the approval of the
IFC, following a party-related flood
ing incident there Dec. 1 that caused
damage estimated at $10,000. The
IFCs investigation of that case is ex
pected to be completed Feb. 20.
Robinson met with Bendy and
Hoskins Friday and asked the IFC to
investigate the allegations, recom
mend what action should be taken if
the allegations prove true and
"develop a mechanism to assure
against any form of hazing on the part
of any fraternal group in the future."
