### ROB REID 
"We are now living in a very historic time he
cause we have the chance to create a situation
for sustained economic growth . .. and to put
together a major arms control agreement that
can perhaps achieve some substantial reduc
tions," Rep. Ed Zschau said here Friday night.
Zschau, the second-term Republican con
gressman from Stanford's district, spoke to
about 150 people in Branner Hall, concentrat
ing on the economic and arms control chal
lenges facing the 99th Congress.
Federal budget deficits present the country s
biggest economic problem. Zschau said. "We
have the foundation for long-term economic
grow th, with one exception. . .. I he challenge
as 1 see it is the enormous federal budget
deficits.
"Our forecasted budget deficits tor a tour
year period including 1985 are about 900 bil
lion dollars under pretty rosy economic
forecasts."
Zschau said that the problem with the up
coming presidential budget proposal "is that
[President Reagan J will pretty much exempt
restraint in defense spending, and he will ex-

empt Social Security.
"Frankly, the budget that the president will
be proposing . . . won't get the job done, it
won't get the deficit down in 1988 below $140
or $ 150 billion. That's still way too large."
Zschau said one way the Senate might try to
bring the military budget down would be by
freezing increases in U.S. contributions to
NATO, an action which he says would save a
total of $98 billion by 1988. He also said the
Senate might propose a freeze in the cost-of
living adjustments in Social Security for people
above the poverty level.
"I am working as hard as I can to get support
for this concept because I believe that if we
don't take action in the next three to five
months on the budget deficit ... it may be
unlikely that we'll be able to do anything at all,"
he said.
• Right now we have all the pieces to the
growth puzzle in place except for these budget
deficits. And if we in Congress can excercise The
leadership and restraint to make the tough
choices once, right now. in such a way that the\

ripple through in the future, we have
a chance to bring the deficits under
control, and get back to a balanced
budget by 1990."
Zschau said he is "optimistic" by
what he saw happen at the Geneva
talks with the Soviets in early Janu
ary. "The message has become clear
to the Soviet Union that one, there's
an advantage to arms-control agree
ments, and two, that in order to get

such agreements, we're going to have
to actually negotiate, and that bully
ing. or threatening or stonewalling is
not going to do anything."
Zschau said he does not support a
full-scale "Star Wars" weapons re
search program. "Perhaps a billion to
$2 billion a year of research could be
spent very effectively, but a $26 bil
lion program over five years when we
haven't thought it through seems to
be putting the cart before the horse."
Zschau said one problem with U.S.
defense is that researchers often try
to copy the projects of the Soviets. "It
may be that a greater emphasis on
submarine-based missiles as opposed
to ICBMs is the way that we should
go, because we have the advantage of
open ports. . . . We shouldn't just try
to mirror image their ICBM capabil
ity."
Ed Zschau was first elected to
Congress in 1980, replacing Republi
can Pete McClosky, who vacated his
seat to run for the Senate. He serves
on the House Foreign Relations
Committee and was elected 1982
Freshman Congressman of the Year.
