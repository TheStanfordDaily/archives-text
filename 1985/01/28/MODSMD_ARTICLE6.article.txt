### GEORGE LEMAITRE 
A dedication ceremony yester
day in Green Library marked the
contribution of the Barchas scien
tific book collection to the library's
Special Collections wing.
The Barchas collection is
composed of almost 5,000 volumes
of first-edition scientific texts. The
authors of these books range from
Archimedes to Albert Einstein and
Galileo to Charles Darwin. Others
include Sigmund Freud, Johannes
Kepler, Louis Pasteur, Rene Des
cartes, Marie Curie and Isaac New
ton.
Michael Ryan, curator of special
collections, put the value of the col
lection at "somewhere between $5
and $10 million." The collection
has been appraised but Ryan
declined to give the exact value.
Ryan said the aquisition of the
books was " two-thirds gift and one
third purchase." He would not.
however, say how much the Uni
versity had paid.
Previously, the Barchas collec
tion had been located at the
Barchas family r.inch in Sonoita,
Ariz.
The collection began as a hobby
for James Barchas and his wife,
Cecile, but it soon turned into an
obsession.
In a speech during the dedication
ceremony. James Barchas des
cribed himself as not being a typi
cally wealthy collector. The value
of the books in his collection
"multiplied by 100-fold, sometimes
500-fold." he said, and the collec
tion grew to the point where it
became a securit\ problem to own
books of such value.
In 1966 he began searching for a
place to put them. The many inter

ested parties included Rockefeller
University, Amherst College and
the Smithsonian Institution. The
Barchas family finally decided that
Stanford would be the ideal setting
for their books. "The collection is
almost like our ninth child,"
Barchas, father of eight, said. "One
wishes the best for one's child and I
think this marriage of the collection
to Stanford University is good for
our child."
The ceremony, which attracted
almost 200 people, lasted close to
an hour and included speeches
from James and Cecile Barchas,
Provost James Rosse and several
Stanford professors.
Almost 20 members of the
Barchas family were in attendence.
The importance of the collec
tion's addition to the existing one is
immense, Ryan said. "It puts Stan
ford on the map as far as being a
repository for major works in the
history of science; because of the
rarity and uniqueness of collections
such as the Barchas", something
like this (donation) happens only
once or twice in the history of an in
stitution." Ryan said.
The Barchas collection is
"probably the last sizeable private
collection of history-of-science
books," Ryan said.
"Stanford can now support a
program in the history of science
which previously it couldn't," ac
cording to Ryan. He said the ac
quisition of the collection was "part
of a much larger vision" that in
cluded hiring Wilbur knorr, associ
ate professor of philosophy and
classics, and Asst. Philosophy Prof.
Peter Galison for instruction in the
history of science.
