The chairman of the hoard of Scientific American
magazine yesterday praised the addition of the Barchas
collection of rare scientific texts to Stanford, saying "in
a university so distinguished by the work of its scien
tists, it is fitting there should he such a shrine."
In a speech following a dedication ceremony at
Green Library, Gerard Piel told a large crowd in Cub
berley Auditorium that through countless repetitions

Piel believes that in the forward
march of science, publishing is vital.
"Not until it is published has it hap

thus openly in public, science imposes
a kind of nobility on the community."
Piel bought and rejuvenated the
then-failing Scientific American in
1948 and was its president and pub
lisher until 1984. He is also the
president-elect of the American As
sociation for the Advancement of Sci

The Barchas Collection, presented

to the University by Samuel and
Cecile Barchas, consists of more than
5,000 rare books and pamphlets
dating from the 15th to the 20th cen
turies, and is expected to strenghten
Stanford's growing History of Science
Program.
The collection includes such books
as Galileo's "Dialogo" and Newton's

"Principia," and is conservatively
valued at $5 million. It is one of the
finest private collections remaining in
the United States recording the his
tory of scientific thought. Of the 130
titles listed in the Grolier Club ex
hibition catalog (called "One
Hundred Books Famous in Sci
ence"), the Barchas collection con
tains 107.
