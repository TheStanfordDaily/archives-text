U.S. ponders new Nicaragua policy
WASHINGTON — The Reagan administration and members of
Congress in both parties, seeking to break the apparent policy deadlock
over Nicaragua, are considering new approaches, including
"humanitarian aid" to the rebels' families and expanded economic sanc
tions.
Both sides agree that the Democrats appear to have blocked further
covert military aid through the Central Intelligence Agency to rebels
fighting the leftist Sandinista government in Nicaragua.
But the Democrats, no less than the Republicans, still want to main
tain pressure for political change there and are casting about for accep
table alternatives that can win public support.
Many Democrats are uneasy over recent developments that appear to
indicate growing political and economic repression in Nicaragua. They
want to help halt that trend but have not found a coherent alternative
policy.
Administration officials fear that the rebel-aid program is dead but
continue to push for it — in various forms — because they have made it
their policy keystone and have no backup positions.
The latest idea from the administration would replace the nominally
covert program of aid to the rebels, called contras, with overt
humanitarian aid to families of the rebel fighters, and to Nicaraguan
refugees living in Honduras, according to Senate Republican sources.
The assistance would total about $14 million, the same as the adminis
tration earmarked for the contras. in hopes that it can win a congres
sional vote scheduled sometime in March.
Pope calls for religion in schools
MARACAIBO, Venezuela — Bouyed by an uninhibited Latin
welcome to this oil capital of petroleum-rich Venezuela. Pope John Paul
II conducted his second heavily-attended papal Mass of the day here
yesterday, calling for religious education in secular as well as church
schools.
At a twilight Mass for hundreds of thousands in Maracaibo. he said.
"Evangelical education should not only be taught in religious schools, it
should be taught in all schools without distinction."
At an earlier Mass for an estimated million worshippers in the
Venezuelan capital city of Caracas* the pope dwelt on another of his fa
vorite themes, what the church views as sins of human sexuality.
To'a nation that legalized divorce in the 19th century and which now
has substantial numbers of unmarried couples, children born out of wed
lock and illegal abortions, the Roman pontiff spoke forcefully and with
visible emotion.
"Fight against the plague of divorce, which ruins families and so
negatively affects the education of children," John Paul said.
"Remember that never is it right to snuff out a human life with abortion
or euthanasia."
He also warned that "contraception and sterilization for contraceptive
ends are always gravely wrong."
Earlier in the day, the Poland-born Pope appeared beaming like a
beardless, white-robed Santa Claus at a meeting with members of the
Venezuelan Polish community in a huge modern theater in Caracas, tap
ping his feet to some of their songs and singing along with them the stir
ring anthem "Mary Queen of Poland."
Meanwhile, officials accompanying the pope hinted that the pontiff
may visit Communist-led Cuba at some point in the future. A leading
Vatican churchman who asked not to be identified said, "I could foresee
the pope making a stopover in Havana during some future trip" to Latin
America. He and other members of the papal entourage were respond
ing to questions raised by a report that American Bishop James Malone,
president of the U.S. Episcopal Conference, returned from Havana last
week to say that Cuban leader Fidel Castro had issued an invitation to
the pope.
Chernenko ill, may resign
LONDON — British newspapers reported yesterday that Soviet Pres
ident Konstantin Chernenko is being treated in the intensive care unit of
a private Kremlin hospital, and may relinquish power because of
deteriorating health.
Western diplomats contacted by The Associated Press in Moscow said
they had not heard any such reports, although most said they believe the
73-year-old Chernenko is ailing.
The Sunday Times quoted "unofficial reports" as saying Chernenko,
who has not been seen in public since Dec. 27. will become the first So
viet leader to step down voluntarily.
Another newspaper. The Express, carried a report that said Cher
nenko "has become so ill he may be forced to resign." The newspapers
did not say what their sources were, or how they obtained their informa
tion.
The Sunday Times said the ruling Politburo already has approved a
plan to replace Chernenko with 53-year-old Mikhail Gorbachev, widely
believed to rank second in the Kremlin hierarchy.
"Under this plan, Gorbachev would take over the post of general sec
retary of the Communist Party, but would not necessarily assume the
presidency — a mainly ceremonial title. Indeed some sources say Cher
nenko could continue to hold this job while stepping down as effective
leader," the newspaper said.
It said any such decision would be made at a meeting of the Commu
nist Party Central Committee next month.
A senior Western diplomat in Moscow told the AP on Friday that So
viet officials acknowledged that Chernenko has been ailing during the
past four weeks.
Repeat offenders prone to skip bail
WASHINGTON — About 10 percent of all criminal defendants and
more than a third of those with serious criminal records who are condi
tionally released by federal courts before their trials get into new trouble
before their cases are heard, according to a Department of Justice study
made public yesterday.
The report showed that about 35 percent of defendants with records
of three or more felony convictions and one or more previous instances
of failure to appear in court had been arrested for a new crime or failed
to appear for trial within 120 days after their release on bail. About 20
percent of offenders with fewer than three felony convictions were ar
rested for new crimes or nonappearance within the 120-day bail period,
the report said, while only 8 percent of first offenders similarly violated
the conditions of their bail.
The report found that the likelihood of misconduct while on bail in
creases in proportion to the time defendants are free, with a 10 percent
probability for defendants on bail for 90 days and a 17-percent probabil
ity if the bail runs to nine months.
The data, compiled by the Bureau of Justice Statistics from 1979
records in 13 of the nation's busiest federal court districts, give statistical
support to the administration's case in advocating enactment of bail
reform legislation last year by the 98th Congress. Attorney General
William French Smith said in a statement.
"There is unconscionable looseness in the system, which manifests it
self in countless preventable murders, rapes and muggings," Smith said.
Noting that the bail reform statute establishes a hearing procedure per
mitting judges to forbid pretrial release of federal defendants if their
release would present a danger to the public. Smith said the report
"makes it clear that many defendants posing just such a threat have been
routinely released to prey on the community."
New Israel-Egypt friction arises
BEERSHLBA. Israel — Israel and Egypt reopened long-stalled
negotiations over a disputed sliver of Red Sea beachfront here yester
day. with both saying they hoped the talks would lead to a broader thaw
in the "cold peace" between them but with minor signs of friction crop
ping up almost immediately.
In his opening statement, chief Egyptian delegate Abdel Halim
Badawi accused the Israelis of violating "the spirit and the letter" of an
earlier agreement calling for arbitration of the border dispute.
Yesterday's opening session broke up an hour earlier than scheduled
and the starting hour of today's morning session was put back an hour.
Today's weather
Slight chance of showers today. The high will be in the mid-50s.
