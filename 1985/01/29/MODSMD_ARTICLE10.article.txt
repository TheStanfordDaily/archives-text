# Report may delay Meese hearings
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — An Office of Government
Ethics staff report concluding that Attorney
General-designate Edwin Meese 111 twice violated
federal ethics rules yesterday threatened to prolong
what had been expected to be speedy confirmation
hearings in the Senate.
The report by two staff lawyers was overruled by
ethics office director David Martin after he dis
cussed its findings with Meese's lawyers and White
House counsel Fred Fielding. Martin refused yes
terday to make the report public.
But Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.), chairman of the
Senate Judiciary Committee, quickly summoned
Martin and the two lawyers to testify about the
report when Meese's confirmation hearings open
today. And Thurmond arranged to obtain the
document for the committee's private inspection
after three panel Democrats, led by Delaware Sen.
Joseph Biden Jr., asked him to subpoena it.
Meese's attorneys minimized the report's impor
tance, saying that Martin reversed his staff attor
neys "in the ordinary course" of his duties. And
odds still appeared to favor strongly Meese's even
tual confirmation by the Senate.
But his chief Democratic opponent on the
Judiciary Committee called it a turning point in ef
forts to derail the nomination. "This report inde

pendently confirms that Mr. Meese violated ethical
standards and is a crucial new development." Sen.
( Howard Met/enbaum (D-Ohio) said.
In the report, disclosed yesterday by the Wall
Street Journal, the two attorneys concluded that
two of Meese's transactions violated federal stand
ards of conduct regulations that bar employees
from any action that "might result in. or create the
appearance of. using public office for private gain;
giving preferential treatment to any person and
losing complete independence or impartiality. . . ."
The attorneys in their report, which is said to run
at least 16 pages, cited as one of the transactions
the arrangement of a $40,000 loan in 1981 by San
Francisco accountant John McKean for Meese,
who was then hard-pressed financially. With the
support of Meese, counselor to the president.
McKean later was named to the U.S. Postal Board
of Governors, but Meese did not disclose his finan
cial relationship with McKean.
The other transaction involved assistance given
Meese in selling his California home by Thomas
Barrack, who was appointed to a Department of
the Interior post.
Leonard Garment, one of Meese's attorneys,
said that after he presented a detailed memoran
dum to Martin on the issues, Martin decided that

"a tactual analysis indicated Moose's relationship
with Mckean did not impair his independent judg
ment with the presidential personnel board" that
approved Mckean's appointment.
On the Barrack question. Garment said. Martin
concluded that his staff "had misread" the report
on the matter by Jacob Stein, the independent
counsel who in September found no basis for crimi
nal charges against Moose. The staff finding was
based on the assertion that Meese knew Barrack
had helped in the sale of his house at the time Bar
rack received the Department of the Interior ap
pointment.
The Stein report said that Meese knew Barrack
had found a buyer for his property, had negotiated
the initial price and other terms with Meese and
had negotiated the final sales price and the loan
used in the purchase.
But Stein said that he found no evidence that
Meese knew at the time of the Barrack appoint
ment that Barrack himself had found a second
buyer and financed his participation in the deal.
As described by Garment, the turnaround of the
staff report took place in two davs — Jan. 17 and
18.
