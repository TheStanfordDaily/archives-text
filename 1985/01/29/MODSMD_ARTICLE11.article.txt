## Insights into the future: a class notebook 
### MARK SHERMAN Dear Craig ARIANA GRAFF 
The 21st century is just around the corner, although its arrival does
not cross most peoples' minds on an average day.
But according to Jack Chin, a graduate student in communication, the
future must he dealt with before it becomes the present. Fall quarter.
Chin led a SWOPSI (Stanford Workshops on Political and Social Issues)
class entitled "Approaching the Twenty-first Century: Insight into
Futures." In this class, students here discussed whether or not current
ways of life will still be workable in the early 21st century.
Chin's chief objective for the class was for each student to develop a
working personal philosophy to cope with possible futures, since he said
that he feels the direction of future events is dependent on the action of
individuals.
In the class, students discussed such topics as energy, technology, eco
nomy, communication and education in relation to the future. As they
explored the possibilities for these topics in the future, they questioned
practices of the present day.
Members of the class wrote about their insights into the future. The
written pieces present examples of the problems that must be thought
about before they can be dealt with in the future. The "Future Insights
Notebook" shows how students have probed into the future, and treated
the unknown as a subject worth serious considerat : on.

lo'duy was nothing too exciting - made my plane reservations for Christmas
break, mailed a few letters, sat through four hours of boring lectures, met with
my freshman advisees and played the first four holes at Pebble Reach. / never
left home. . . .
Even today such a scenario is possible. And with the current force behind
the home computer and its growing range of applications, it is likely that such
a scenario will be probably by the year 2020.
With the home computer has come a very real opportunity to conduct
many day-to-day errands on a keyboard, at your desktop, in the home. With
the revolution in interactive viewdata systems, we can now make plane
reservations from our dens.
With computer networks, letters can be sent via electronic mail and we can
access taped lectures stored in a video "library." Current technology also
enables us to "teleconference" (or even to videoconference) with a group of
others.
We can even play golf (with real golfballs and real clubs) right in our living
rooms. Just tee up and drive the ball toward a large screen, on which is
projected any hole of any one of a number of selected golf courses.
Computerized scanning beams calculate where your ball will land, and
from there your approach shot is then displayed on the screen. Hit a seven
iron to the green and the screen displays the 25-foot putt you must make for
a birdie.
Such a scenario is, no doubt, exciting. In fact, the efficiency and
convenience associated with the communications revolution and the home
computer in particular, is certainly something for which we should be
thankful.
In many respects life has become easier; with the growing potential to do
so many things from within the home, we are no longer faced with the
time-consuming tasks of getting ourselves from one place to another.
However, we must not become overly obsessed with efficiency and
convenience, for if we do, we may do so at the expense of not only our
economy, but also at the expense of face-to-face communication and genuine
human interaction.
With respect to the economy, an obsession with efficiency and convenience
poses a serious threat to many customer-oriented jobs. In using the term
customer-oriented, I am referring to such jobs as bank teller, librarian, ticket
booth salesperson, gas station worker, etc. — jobs which are largely occupied
by non-skilled labor.
With an unthoughtful rush toward efficiency and convenience and, in turn,
toward a home-centered lifestyle, many of these jobs will become obsolete.
The demand for customer-oriented workers will decline as the demand for
skilled, high-tech engineers rises to meet the growing demand for home
computers. The customer-oriented workers will lose jobs. This phenomenon
can be illustrated by referring back to the scenario at the article's beginning.
Let's examine the impact of one aspect of the home computer, electronic
mail, on the employment structure. First, fewer postal workers will be needed
as more mail is sent electronically. With fewer postal workers employed and

with fewer actual, physical letters being sent, the economy will witness a
decline in the amount of transportation services employed by the postal
service — less gasoline consumed, fewer tuneups required, fewer air mail
nights, etc.
A decline in the demand for these services will ultimately result in the loss
of customer-oriented jobs in the transportation industry as well.
While customer-oriented jobs decline in many sectors and as the demand
for efficiency continues, it follows that the demand for skilled, high-tech
workers will, by necessity, increase.
No problem, right? The increased demand for skilled technicians will offset
the decreased demand for non-skilled, customer-oriented workers; the
displaced workers will simply move into these newly created positions.
Wrong.
The decline in customer-oriented jobs will not be offset by the increased
demand in the high-tech market; customer-oriented workers simply do not
have the necessary skills to jump right into the high-tech industry. They are
not engineers; as a result, they will be unemployed. The end result, then, will
be a shift away from equilibrium in the job market — a shift toward higher
unemployment.
Not only will the job sector be shaken by a blind rush toward efficiency
and convenience, but face-to-face communication may be affected as well.
Given the opportunity to make plane reservations, "attend" classes and even
play golf at home, people will simply spend less time out in "the market
place," interacting with others.
This idea has particularly scary implications with respect to growing up as a
child and, in turn, with respect to gaining a practical education — an
education that teaches interaction and human dynamics.
With the advent of the computer and video technology, today's kids are
not out creating their own fun; they are not out playing hide-and-seek or
whiffleball baseball. Rather, they are sitting in front of video machines,
playing PacMan or Space Invaders: instant gratification for a quarter.
Certainly, they are being denied a vital form of education — the education
that comes from face-to-face communication, human interaction,
give-and-take situations — real conflict and real problem solving.
What are the implications of this situation? Will the children of the
PacMan Generation be able to handle the dynamics of group projects when
they hit high school? Will these kids even have an actual, physical high school
to attend, or will they simply attend classes from their high school terminals?
To what limits will we allow the quest for efficiency and convenience to take
us?
No one really knows the answer. No one really knows what effects the
communications revolution and the computer will have on today's children.
No one really knows the effects it will have on the economy and the job
sector. What we do know, however, is that the communications revolution
carries with it a potential to have very far-reaching effects on our lives.
We must not rush head-first into a quest for efficiency and convenience;
rather, we must proceed slowly and cautiously, looking closely at where
we've been and at where we are going, examining our decisions as we make
them.

"If an unfriendly foreign power had attempted to impose on America the
mediocre educational performance that exists today, we might well ha\e
viewed it as an act of war. . . . For the first time in the history of our country,
the educational skills of one generation will not surpass, will not equal, w ill
not even approach, those of their parents."
So began the National Commission on Excellence in Education's recent
report to the nation. The report details what has become increasingly
apparent: The United States will have to re-evaluate and affirm its
commitment to provide personally fulfilling education for its citizens.
The United States is unique in its provision of a free education to its
citizens, believing that an educated citizenry is crucial to continuing informed
democracy. Unfortunately, the educational system of the United States has
been unable to address severe structural problems in the purpose of schools
— most important of which is the setting of priorities. , t
Forced to deal with far-reaching societal problems, the schools are unable*
to maintain a concern about individuals' potentials in the midst of such broad
pressures. Students, sensing the overload on the school's structure, become
understandably frustrated in trying to receive an education. Fewer teachers.'
larger classes and fewer resources give the impression that the students'
needs are not merely being lost in the shuffle, but were never considered to
begin with. Many often give up hope at the chance of furthering their
education.
In his book "Megatrends," author John Naisbitt reports some alarming
statistics. In the state of California, the dropout rate increased S3 percent
during the 1970s and now is three times the national average. Boston, New
York, Cleveland. Washington, Baltimore and New Orleans report chronic
absenteeism — which usually leads to high dropout rates.
In Wisconsin, the dropout rate increased 50 percent during the 19705.
Governor Lee Dreyfus, "shocked" at the dropout data, told the Milwaukee
Journal, "These people make up a city approximately the size of Madison
and they will have to be supported by the rest of the state."
It is not merely a numbers game, but a personal tragedy that the estimates
for functional illiterates in the United States range between IS and 64 million
people. Not only does this threaten the basis for our political system, but it
threatens the very idea of progress for our society if the talent and energy of
a whole generation is inexorably being ground into the dust.
How can we alleviate the overload on our schools and place a greater
emphasis on fulfilling the individual's personal educational needs? To begin
with, policy implementations have been discussed, such as increased pay for
teachers, merit pay, "master teachers," longer school hours and more
homework.
However, these do not address the fundamental problem in the educational
system of today: educating the individual so that the individual will be able to
continue to educate himself.
In order to achieve this, a new curriculum should be adopted. As we
approach the 21st century, it will become increasingly important to
emphasize the flexibility of life-long learning. An individual with this
capability will be in a better position and able to adapt to the increasingly
faster pace of life which is sure to accompany the progress of the future.
The current curriculum in schools does not help the individual achieve this
flexibility in his education, and as a result, has been criticized as a "holdover
from the past."
One solution to the problem has already been proposed which would
emphasize the individual, help the individual by allowing him to adapt to new
environments and help the individual (and the school system) meet the
difficult social problems that adolescents face these days.
A group of 27 scholars, educators and policymakers, including Emeritus
Prof. Paul De Hart Hurd of the Stanford School of Education, has
proposed in their statement " Developing Character: Transmitting
Knowledge" that "Education researchers and policymakers should give
greater attention to . . . character development and the long-term rise in
youth disorder. It is urgent for us to increase our understanding of this
remarkable and distressing phenomenon."
According to the report, "Students, at all grade levels, should more
frequently be assigned group responsibilities for academic and school-related
activities."
In the end, the priority of our school system must put the individual's
personal educational development above all else, as well as offer him a
chance to contribute to the lives of others. As Jim Marshall, assistant director
of the STEP (Stanford Teacher Education Program), said, "Education is
intended to restore connections among people" and "to fulfill human needs
.. .to grow for one's own sake."
