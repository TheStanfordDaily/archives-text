## The 						Stanford Daily A 						gun for each of you 
### 
Last week Bernard Goetz was charged with il
legally carrying a weapon in the December shoot
ing of four teenagers on a New York subway
train. The shooting again brings to the fore a pas
sionately argued topic in America: gun control.
Again the pragmatic argument of saving lives is'
thrown against the constitutional right to bear
arms. And again there is a stalemate as friends
and foes of gun control wind up shouting slogans
and not speaking to each other.
Chicago columnist Mike Royko once suggested
that a solution to the debate lay in legalizing not
only handguns, but all types of weaponry. A bur
glar, after all. would be more hesitant to enter a
home he suspected had anti-personnel mines
planted in the doorway. And an armed robber
would think twice before holding up a bank with
a high-tech. "Star Wars" particle-beam defense
system.
But Royko's plan, unfortunately, has a flaw:
The deregulation of the weapons sector would
result in a massive and irreversible arms race.
There would be successive runs on machine guns,
bazookas, heavy artillery, Sidewinder missiles,
amphibious landing-crafts, ICBMs and Trident
submarines. Lockheed and Boeing would no
doubt be happy, but the rest of the American
economy would crumble.

And what of arms talks? There isn't a table in
America big enough to accommodate all the
burglars, fiends, mercenaries, muggers, NRA
members and the other assorted psychopaths
who like weapons of destruction.
It becomes obvious we're looking at the prob
lem from the wrong perspective. The pro-gun
lobby has a point; guns don't kill people, people
kill people. People are to blame for murders, rob
beries and other acts of violence.
The problem with weapons is not their in
herent danger, but rather that they are kept out
of sight until just before use, thus negating
whatever deterrence value they may have had.
Look at the Goetz case. Had the youths seen
Goetz toting around his revolver, they probably
would have steered clear of him from the outset.
The problem wasn't Goetz's gun, it was his
concealed gun.
And therein is the solution to our dilemma.
The Constitution guarantees the right to bear
arms, but it doesn't say anything about the right
to wear clothes. After all, people don't conceal
guns, clothes conceal guns.
Instead of outlawing guns, we should — and
we're sure the gun lobby will agree — outlaw
clothes. That way. only outlaws would wear
clothes, making them so much easier to spot. Any
lesser solution simply doesn't make sense.
