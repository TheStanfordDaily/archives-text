## Divestment: if not now, then when? 
### 
I sat behind him as he spoke smilingly and
soothingly about Stanford's moral and practi
cal concerns with respect to investment in
South Africa. He lamented the nature of
public trusts and the restrictions on their poli
tical behavior. Posturing about fairness and
cautioning against across-the-board action, he

VIEWPOINT

insisted on a case-by-case analysis of corpor
ate behavior in South Africa. As he warmly
gestured around the room, he explained his
role of corporate cog in the decision-making
process.
But through it all ran the common thread
that the trustees of Stanford University are
principally concerned with maximizing profit.
Although they would claim that they do it in
the students' interest. William Massy, Univer
sity vice president for business and finance,
liaison to the titans of educational industry
and representative by proxy for these
"enlightened" men, through his condescend
ing words gave the students assembled in En
cina Hall a very different and disturbing
message. Students and their pointed questions
are merely a necessary evil which legitimizes
the existence of LSJU Inc. and morality is an
economic inconvenience.
Before the student body becomes lulled by
the Commission on Investment Responsibility
(C-1R) report into thinking that the Univer
sity is a moral activist, it is important to un
derstand the report's content, relative
significance and cynical by-products. The
report only addresses Motorola Corp. (and

not the multitude of other corporations in
which Stanford invests) and simply states that
divestment of Motorola stock will take place
if Motorola continues to sell weapons to the
police of the South African government. This
statement, while a giant step for Stanford's
monolithic investment policy, is extraor
dinarily weak. At best. Motorola will respond
by not selling weapons directly to the South
African government. However, it will prob
ably funnel these implements of oppression to
another company which will ultimately sell
them to the government in question.
Therefore, Motorola looks better and contin
ues to profit from the sale of these invest
ments while at the same time creating the
illusion of responsiveness to student and
moral imperatives.
Clearly the C-1R is a reactionary assembly,
and not a very effective one at that. Either
that, or mentally retarded, as it has taken
eight years (the C-IR was established in 1977
after 300 students and faculty members
staged a sit-in in Old Union against Stanford's
investment policies and were arrested) to
make even a weak move. It should not require
a popular referendum to induce moral behav
ior. And clearly, such a referendum (83 per
cent of students voted for divestment) was not
enough to shake self-proclaimed liberals like
Political Science Prof. Richard Brody
(chairman of C-IR) et al. out of their moral
stupor. For if it were enough, they would call
for complete divestment. Just as the influx of
foreign capital into America bolsters the U.S.
economy and the status of its elected officials
and their policies, American corporate invest

ment in South Africa supports that abomina
ble nation's legal and social systems.
The C-IR's current stance is designed to
pacify socially conscious members of the
Stanford community. Yet it is quite mistaken,
for we will not be pacified by empty gestures.
Nor shall we accept the fallacious arguments
that have been put forward in support of the
status quo: 1) divestment will hurt blacks; 2)
public trusts cannot make political state
ments; 3) divestment will hurt the University;
4) our divestiture is only a symbolic act.
Total divestment does not significantly
injure the vast majority of blacks in South
Africa who earn less money in two days than
U.S. minimum-wage workers earn in an hour.
Certainly it might injure in the short run the
lifestyles of the few black elites who because
of great oppression chose to work with the
system and now are the heads of the Bantus
taans. However, arguments that presume that
blacks are better off vi/ith apartheid strongly
resemble those posited by white, Southern
American racists prior to the Civil War: "If
we take slavery away, these people will be
worse off."
Public trusts, by definition, make political s
statements, for every economic transaction is
a political act. When you buy a product you
are supporting that company and its workers.
When you invest in a corporation your effect
is greater and your statement more forceful
for you are nov : t the same position as the
corporation W> t profits, so do you; when
it loses mone*, so do you. Stanford Univer
sity, by inventing in corporations that do busi
ness in South Africa, has made the decision to

tie a portion of its economic fate to that of
these corporations. Since these corporations
play a pivotal role in maintaining the apar
theid system and in fact benefit from it as it
supplies cheap labor, Stanford, as an investor
in these companies, by extension also benefits
from apartheid and, in addition, supports this
system actively. Divestment is a political act,
yet investment is one as well. The University
and its trustees should not try to hide
hypocritically behind the illusion of maintain
ing a public trust's political neutrality, for our
investments are not politically neutral.
Some University officials have implicitly
asserted that divestment would hurt the en
dowment and thus the students. Assuming
that their concern for the students is
paramount, they should respect our over
whelming rejection of oppression-tainted
money and find other less-offensive corpora
tions* in which they might invest.
Finally, it makes me question the nature of
my education. If my educators profit from the
exploitation of others, it is quite likely that
they will try to transmit those same values to
me. Certainly, many if not most of the faculty
are politically liberal or progressive, and do
not espouse the values of oppression.
However, which courses are allowed to be
taught and which are not and why not? Is it
merely a coincidence that SWOPSI (Student
Workshops on Political and Social Issues),
one of the last academic outposts free from
curricular control, is being "consolidated"
into a program under far more stringent Uni
versity control? Is it merely a coincidence that
the Western Culture program only chronicles

the achievements of white males and ignores
ancient African contributions as well as those
of modern blacks, other ethnic groups and
women? I cannot answer these questions with
absolute assurance, however the total divest
ment of University stock in corporations that
operate in South Africa would show the Stan
ford community that the board of trustees
works in good faith with those it purports to
be concerned about.
Certainly, many other institutions and com
panies are heavily entrenched in South Africa
and have invested billions of dollars there, but
they too are reconsidering their role. Al
though Stanford's investments are only a
small fraction of the total amount, do not fall
into the trap that Massy did and try to
trivialize the important act of Stanford's
divestiture as symbolic.
Nevertheless, one need not look to large in
stitutions to find culpability. Many wealthy
students own stock and should consult their
personal investment portfolios as well as
those of their parents. All of us need to exam
ine our lifestyles and note room for change,
even if that change is not necessarily in our
short-term best interests, for the fate of the
world hangs in the balance.
A wise sage once said:
If I am not for myself who will be for me? If
I am only for myself what am I? but if not
now, when?
When, Mr. Massy? When, trustees? When,
fellow students? When?
