## Crutch, comfort and faith 
### 
In the United States. 40 percent of the popula
tion regularly attends either a church or a
synagogue, a fact which has remained constant for
the past four decades. We express more confidence
in our religious institutions than in any of our sys
tems. including Congress, the Supreme Court and
banks. But why do we commit ourselves so fer
vently to our faith? Why do we deign to explain an
infinitely unfathomable being? What has religion
offered unto us?
It is obvious that we have not progressed morally
beyond the stages of the caveman's Gregorian
grunts: Our history is diseased with war and religi
ous death. Our ancestors worshipped the stars and
the sea. We prayed to Apollo. Aurora and
Neptune. We sacrificed goats' hearts and human
beings, hoping to appease the almighty. We
crusaded against the infidel, hunted witches in
Salem, rooted out and extirpated lowly heathen
during the Inquisition. In Northern Ireland today,
we fight, guised in self-righteous Protestantism or
Catholicism. We battle in the Middle Hast for
Judaism or Islam. We commit suicide because Rev -
erend Jones commands us to. We pay evangelists to
wash away our dirty sins, and we predict the end of
the world. We claw and kill: all for the glory of an
all-lov ing, all-understanding god.
We are honored by those lew such as Bishop
Desmond Tutu and Mother Teresa who strive for
humanity, compassion and charity, but are their ef
forts religious? Hveryone tries to uphold moral
ideals to the best of his ability. regardless of religi
ous conviction. When we are asked to love and
reSpect each other, are these not innate, immutable
twjths?
Religion is not a textbook course which we can
learn or preach. We cannot memorize the code of
infinity. We can attempt to do what we believe is
correct, bounded within the izuidelines of social

reason. But faith is a painful and personal search. It
is an attempt to explain that which we do not know
or understand, an attempt to place ourselves into a
vastly insignificant world, an attempt to comfort
ourselves, an attempt to make physical that which
we cannot touch. We can just as easily divine stars,
palms and hen scratchings as intrepret the Koran or

the Bible. If we admit that we are finite, which we
are. we can never explain or understand an infinite
wisdom. Even to attempt to reduce god to words
and prayers is childish and narrow. So look at man.
at our insignificance in comparison to the immen
sity of any god which we propose. And whether it is
Muslim. Jewish. Christian. Buddhist or something
entirely foreign to our minute grasps, does it really
matter?

When I ask my friends why they believe as they
do, thcv offer weak babble which touches their
truth as smoke touches a star. Their arguments
revolve around the whining saw: "I believe because
I believe. Just because." And no one can defeat
their opinion or faith, as fragile as it may be, be
cause it is personal belief, not fact.
Possibility and tolerance open new dimensions to
religious thought, if only we could all agree upon it.
It is possible that the Christian god is true, but it is
just as likely that Buddha, Allah. Thor or a tree
rules our fate. We are in all likelihood wrong about
our conceptions, and we should therefore tolerate
each others' opinions. We should admit in all
humility that we do not know who or what Ciod is,
or if a god exists. Our faiths will create the hope for
something greater than ourselves. It is only human.
And most of us will sleep better if we cling to that
faith. But there are many who will not allow
anyone to replace their crutch. They do not want to
admit that they may be wrong. Their personal
beliefs are \ ital to their existence, and they will not
permit doubt to creep into their dogma.
We all want comfort. But no matter how strong
our faith is, our faith is weak because we may be
wrong. We cannot advocate disenfranchising broth
erhood. love and equality. We cannot dismiss the
contributions to art of institutionalized religion
such as African reliquary figures, pre-Columbian
sacrificial vessels. Madonnas. Gregorian chants and
tribal dances. We merely should not attach to a sin
gular. defined entity which might bring about bar
riers to peace, understanding and community.
Religions bloody their faith in war and ignorance.
Why will we not let go of our pacifiers, even when
we fight for their sake? Comfort? Some comfort.
