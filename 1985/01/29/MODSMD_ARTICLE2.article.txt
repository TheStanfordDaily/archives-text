# Reagan plans GSL cuts
## 
### FRANK LESTER Staff writer 
Stanford officials say they are hesitant to
speculate on the effect of several federal fin
ancial aid cuts proposed by the Reagan ad
ministration.
The proposals, leaked to The New York
Times by an anonymous administration
source on Saturday, call tor ceilings to be
plated on specific components of the federal
financial aid system. These limitations
would limit both the number of students eli
gible for federal aid and the amount of fin
ancial aid students could receive.
One proposal would deny Guaranteed
Student Loans (GSL) to students whose
parents make more than $32,500 a year.
The original proposed ceiling was $30,000,
as reported by The Daily on Jan. 10. Patricia
Smith, director of legislative analysis for the
American Council on Education, told I he

Times that the original plan would disqualify
about 500,000 students from receiving
GSLs and reckoned the new proposal would
only "reduce that 500,000 by 30,000 or
40,000 at most."
An equally significant proposal would
deny Pell Grants to students whose family
incomes exceed $25,000 a year. And
regardless of family income, the amount of
federal aid any one student could receive
each year would be reduced to $4,000.
Graduate students are now allowed to bor
row $5,000 a year from the federal govern
ment; undergraduates can borrow up to
$7,000.
David Stockman, the director of the Of
fice of Management and Budget, recently
said of the cuts, "In the first term, we
cleaned up the low-income programs. Now
we have to go after the middle-income pro

grams.
University officials appear wary of the
president's proposed cuts. "They're very
ominous," said Financial Aids Director
Robert Huff. "We're very concerned about
them."
Huff added that the reports his office has
seen from Washington are "not any differ
ent'' from the ones he had access to when in
terviewed two weeks ago. At that time Huff
said the cuts under proposal would have a
"disastrous" impact on Stanford students.
He said the proposed cuts would "put pres
sure on the University" and have a consider
able impact on the University's commitment
to meet undergraduate students' demon
strated financial needs.
Dean of Graduate Students Gerald
Lieberman said last night that the cuts, if im-
plemented, would have "a serious ef
fect" on graduate students, although
he said he was hesitant to speculate
on the specific effects the cuts would
have because of the anonymity of the
source who first leaked the news to
The Times. "We don't have all the in
formation," Lieberman said.
He added that graduate students
who are independent of their parents
would probably be hardest hit by the
cuts under consideration.

Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons, echoing an earlier statement
by Huff, said, "Tremendous pressure
on Congress from all sides" makes it
hard to tell whether legislators will be
as defensive of higher education aid
programs as they have been in the
past. He said there is a "national con
sensus that we are living beyond our
means," and indicated that the net ef
fect of that consensus will be an un
willingness on the part of Congress to
be automatically supportive of
keeping any social program, including
student aid. intact from budget cut
ting.

Lyons added. "This strategy the
Reagan administration has of budget
cutting is not very student-centered.
It tends to be discriminatory to low
income and middle-income stu
dents." He said that an ideal budget
cutting strategy would take into ac
count the fact that many middle
income students are from families
with "crucial expenses" belied by the
five digits in their annual income
statements.
The president will send his
proposals for cuts in federal student
aid to Congress Monday with his an
nual budget.
