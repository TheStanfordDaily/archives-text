# Reagan plans GSL cuts

### FRANK LESTER Staff writer 
Stanford officials say they are hesitant to
speculate on the effect of several federal fin
ancial aid cuts proposed by the Reagan ad
ministration.
The proposals, leaked to The New York
Times by an anonymous administration
source on Saturday, call tor ceilings to be
plated on specific components of the federal
financial aid system. These limitations
would limit both the number of students eli
gible for federal aid and the amount of fin
ancial aid students could receive.
One proposal would deny Guaranteed
Student Loans (GSL) to students whose
parents make more than $32,500 a year.
The original proposed ceiling was $30,000,
as reported by The Daily on Jan. 10. Patricia
Smith, director of legislative analysis for the
American Council on Education, told I he

Times that the original plan would disqualify
about 500,000 students from receiving
GSLs and reckoned the new proposal would
only "reduce that 500,000 by 30,000 or
40,000 at most."
An equally significant proposal would
deny Pell Grants to students whose family
incomes exceed $25,000 a year. And
regardless of family income, the amount of
federal aid any one student could receive
each year would be reduced to $4,000.
Graduate students are now allowed to bor
row $5,000 a year from the federal govern
ment; undergraduates can borrow up to
$7,000.
David Stockman, the director of the Of
fice of Management and Budget, recently
said of the cuts, "In the first term, we
cleaned up the low-income programs. Now
we have to go after the middle-income pro

grams.
University officials appear wary of the
president's proposed cuts. "They're very
ominous," said Financial Aids Director
Robert Huff. "We're very concerned about
them."
Huff added that the reports his office has
seen from Washington are "not any differ
ent'' from the ones he had access to when in
terviewed two weeks ago. At that time Huff
said the cuts under proposal would have a
"disastrous" impact on Stanford students.
He said the proposed cuts would "put pres
sure on the University" and have a consider
able impact on the University's commitment
to meet undergraduate students' demon
strated financial needs.
Dean of Graduate Students Gerald
Lieberman said last night that the cuts, if im-
