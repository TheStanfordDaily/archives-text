### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportsWriter 
The Stanford men's tennis team,
ranked No. 2 in the country in the
Intercollegiate Tennis
'Coaches Association preseason
poll, will play its first home match
this afternoon against Cal State
Hayward.
Stanford is second in the na
tional poll behind UCLA. Cal
State Hayward is not ranked, but
has finished first in the Northern
California Athletic Conference for
the past nine years.
According to Stanford Coach
Dick Gould, the match against Cal
State Hayward is a warmup for the
Cardinal. The men will be playing
in the National Team Indoor
Championship, tomorrow through
Sunday in Louisville, ky. Partici
pants in that tournament include
the top teams from each of the na
tion's eight regions.
Leading Stanford this season in
the ITCA preseason singles poll is
No. 2-ranked junior Dan Goldie.
As a sophomore he was ranked
No. 23 in the same preseason poll.
Gould said Goldie is a much im
proved doubles player who will

help Stanford in that area.
"Damn's volley is much hotter
this \ear. He and Derrick
(Rostagno) both have a better feel
for movement on the court,
they're learning to control the
tempo instead of just blasting the
ball." Gould said.
Rostagno. a sophomore, will
team up in doubles play with
freshman Patrick McEnroe, who
was ranked No. 1 in the 1984 Na
tional Junior Doubles Rankings.
Goldie will play with Scott Moody
in the No. 1 doubles match.
Rolf Wiedenmeyer and Brian
Mehmeddasich will play for Cal
Stat'. Hayward in the No. 1 and
No. 2 singles matches. They are
also the No. 1 ranked doubles
team in Division 11. Last year they
became the first Cal State
Hayward players to ever win a Na
tional Collegiate Athletic Associa
tion Division I playoff match.
Stanford's next home matches
are Feb. 12 against the University
of California at Santa Barbara and
Feb. 14 against eighth-ranked
Louisiana State University. Both
matches begin at 1:30 p.m. at the
Varsity Tennis Courts.
