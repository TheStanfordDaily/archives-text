## Stanford stays out of cellar with victory Card breaks losing streak 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
I OS ANGELES — Fresh off an
embarrassing loss to UCLA Saturday
night, the Stanford men's basketball
could have easily succumbed to the
graces of Pacific I" Conference co
leader University of Southern Cali
fornia last night at the l.os Angeles
Sports Arena.
It didn't.
Stanford not only staved in the
game against the Trojans, it beat
them 60-54. That's not a misprint.
The Cardinal, desperately in need
of a respectable show ing, not to men
tion a victory, used a mixture of
clutch free-throw shooting and guts
to win only its second Pac-10 game in
seven tries this season. The victory
was Stanford's first Pac-10 road tri
umph after seven straight losses,
dating back to last season. It was also
the Cardinal's first victory over USC
or UCLA here since 1976.
"I told the players that there is no
way that they could have played
harder." a hoarse Cardinal Coach
Tom Davis said. "That was un
matched as far as pure, unadulterated
effort goes. We beat a very fine bas
ketball team tonight."
While Stanford. 10-7 overall and
2-5 in the Pac-10, moved out of the
conference cellar, USC fell out of a
three-way tie for the Pac-10 lead.
The Trojans dropped to 1 1-5 overall
and 5-2 in league play.
Were the Trojans, who host rival
UCLA here Friday night, looking
past the Cardinal, especially after the
100-71 drubbing Saturday night?
"No, we did not look past them in
anticipation of UCLA," USC Coach
Stan Morrison said. "Give credit to
Stanford. They came out and kicked
our butts.
"I'm just very impressed with Stan
ford. and hats off to them."
The 3,773 at the Sports Aien.i
however, weren't tipping their hats tu
the number of missed shots and fouls.
A total of six players, four of them
Trojans, fouled out, and the teams
shot a combined 35.6 percent (36-
for-101) from the floor. Conse
quently. neither team was able to gain
any momentum and lead by more
than seven points.
The Trojans jumped to an early
10-3 lead, but Stanford refused to let
what happened against UCLA hap
pen again. Instead, the Cardinal out
scored USC 18-7 over the next nine
minutes and took a 27-25 halftime
lead.
It was a lead Stanford would relin
quish only once — for an entire 10

seconds early in the second half.
USC\ however. did tie it at 44-44
with 7:15 remaining.
It was then that Stanford went into
its delax game, called "The Roll."
Ouarterhacked bx point guard Keith
Ramee. the Cardinal ran nearly three
minutes ott the clock before freshman
I-ric Reveno was fouled and went to
the free-throw line to shoot a one
and-one. USC called a timeout to

make Reveno think about it.
The timeout worked, and Reveno
missed the free throw. But forward
Andy Fischer grabbed the long
rebound and seconds later Reveno
got the ball inside and muscled in a
reverse lax up to i»ix e Stanford the
lead.
A free throw bx Trojan forward
Derrick Dowell cut the lead to one.
USC had a chance to take the lead

with 2:28 to go. hut senior center
Clayton Olivier missed, the front end
of a one-and-one.
Stanford's senior center, Kent
Seymour, grabbed the rebound, was
fouled, and began the Cardinal's
near-perfect down-the-stretch free
throw shooting. In the final 2:28.
Stanford hit 16-of-1 V free throws and
left USC with no chance to come
back.
"The players did about everything
they could do as far as key rebounds
and free throws were concerned,"
Davis said of his team's performance
in the closing minutes.
The player who accounted for
many of those key plays was forward
Earl koberlein. who did not start for
only the second time this season.
Koberlein scored a game-high 17
points, including 14 in the first half.
He was 6-for-y from the floor and 5-
for-6 from the line, while pulling
down five rebounds.
Despite shooting below 40 percent
as a team again. Stanford was able to
beat the Trojans the same way it has
defeated other teams this season —
with its press.
"I thought their press hurt us a
lot." Morrison said. "Their press took
its toll after 40 minutes of play. They
got us out of our game."
Stanford now has the hulk of its
road games behind it. Seven of its
final 11 games are at home, including
contests Thursday against the Uni
versity of Oregon and Saturday
against Oregon State University.
