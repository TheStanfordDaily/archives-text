## Talking with Paul Wiggin 
### 
' his Friday marks the fifth an
niversary of a historical event, hut
you d have to he very seriously
into trivia to know why. A
gentleman I spoke to Monday
didn't know ahout it. lie, if
anyone, should have — it was Feb.
1, 19X0 when Paul Wiggin ac
cepted Stanford's head football
coaching position.
l-ess than four years later, a
couple of days before his team lost
here to the University of Califor
nia at Berkeley, the 10th loss of an
I 1 -game season, his firing was an
nounced.
When I telephoned Wiggin Sat
urday, I expected some reticence
from him about giving an inter
view because the problems of the
Cardinal s 1-10 season were
analyzed by the media endlessly as
the losses mounted, and the solu
tion was always the same. Wiggin
had to go, said his critics.
I got what I expected, and after
assuring him I wasn't interested in
an all-revealing expose, Wiggin
agreed to talk. I began our con
versation yesterday by asking him
about his position as an envoy at
last summer's Olympics, and, per
haps not surprisingly, the subject
changed.
"I'm not saying this in an embit
tered way. I'm just saying when
you leave a place like Stanford,
and there's a sense of not getting
the job done from the won-loss
standpoint — I'm happy with
every other area of what I did — it
was nice to be able to have a major
role in something and walk away
feeling like you really did a good
job."
From there on, Wiggin spoke
his mind as I had hoped for. Here
are excerpts from our 45-minute
conversation.
On his four seasons as head
football coach here: "I've always
felt like I've done my best. You
can't look back and say, 'If Paul
Wiggin was not playing golf all the

time or whatever, he'd have done
a lot better." I was always commit
ted to what I was doing. I've never
felt any sense of dissatisfaction
over my commitment to what I
was trying to do."
On what, if anything, he would
do differently, given the chance:
"First of all. I think I would really
question whether I would take the
job at Stanford. And that's real
easy to say when it wasn't as suc
cessful as you would like. What I
thought was going to be a neat roll
of the dice was a very heavy roll of
the dice."
On Coach Jack Elway: "He un
derstands what it takes. He partic
ularly understands what it takes at
Stanford because he had a son
[who| went there. In putting to
gether his package — and I won't
call them demands, but maybe
they were demands — he said.
' This is what I need to do with
recruiting, because for us to com
pete in the Pac-10 (Pacific 10
Conference), we're going to have
to have it.' And these were things
that weren't there previously. I
pretty much know for a fact that
that's what happened."
On the news media: "I would go
to different press meetings. In my
third year, when we were having a
difficult start early in the year. I'd
go to press things. We were
playing, I think, Oregon State.
And you know what? Up until
about three-fourths of the way
through the press conference,
Oregon State didn't even come
up. . . . They wanted to know,
'What is your relationship with
your athletic director? Has he said
anything to you?' "
On his future: "I'm debating on
some things — whether I want to
go back into coaching and be an
assistant coach at the pro level.
There are good, logical reasons for
that, retirement factors and so
forth. ... I just need to make a
decision."
