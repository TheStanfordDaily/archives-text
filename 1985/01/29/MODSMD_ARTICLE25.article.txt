### TOM SENF 
If it's January, it must be time lor
baseball. The Stanford baseball team
begins its quest for a 21 st consecutive
winning season today at 2 p.m. as it
hosts St. Mary's College.
The Cardinal, ranked ninth in the
nation in the Collegiate Baseball
preseason poll, is looking to
recapture the Pacific 10 Conference
Southern Division (Six-Pac) champi
onship it won outright in 1983.
Last season. Coach Mark
Marquess's squad posted a 38-26-1
record. Arizona State University won
the division last season, but lost its
title when it was placed on probation
in December. Thus, Stanford became
co-champion with the University of
Southern California.
In the Six-Pac. the Cardinal's 18-
1 2 mark was good for a second-place
tie with USC. Stanford was also able
to earn a birth in the National Col
legiate Athletic Association Western
Regionals, where the team won two
games before being eliminated by
ASU.
Marquess is optimistic about his
team's prospects. "We feel we are a
competitive team with goals of
making the NCAA playoffs for a fifth
straight year. We have a strong
enough team with several key starters
returning," he said.
In 1984, Stanford had the lowest
team batting average in the Six-Pac.

I his year. Marquess hopes that in
creased production from his returning
players will improve the team's
scoring punch.
"Last year, we slipped offensively,
hut we're hoping with a year of ex
perience that we'll he able to produce
more runs." Marquess said. His
hopes should he realized, as nine of
the top 10 hitters return this year.
The Cardinal will be very strong up
the middle. In senior All-America
candidates John Verducci and Pete
Stanicek. Stanford has one of the best
double-play combinations in the
country. Verducci. an All Six-Pac se
lection last year, is one of the finest
defensive shortstops in collegiate
baseball. Stanicek, who received
honorable mention in the All Six-Pac
voting, batted .307 and stole 43 bases
in 1 984.
Stanford's other All-America can
didate is senior pitcher Jeff Ballard.
The left-hander compiled an 8-5
record and a 4.42 earned run average
last season.
St.Mary's is coming off a 28-31
season in which it also finished
second in the Northern California
Baseball Association. Because the
NCBA disbanded this year, the Gaels
now play in the West Coast Athletic
Conference.
It is likely that senior Bryan Smith,
who had a 6-2 record with a stingy
3.11 ERA. will oppose Ballard.

Senior pitcher Jeff Ballard, who will start today, is the Cardinal's top
returning pitcher this season. His 23 career wins make him the sixth
best in Stanford baseball history.
