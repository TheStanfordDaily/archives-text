### PETER CASTILLO Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford wrestling team had its best placing
in the All-California Invitational Saturday and
hopes to carry that momentum against highly
touted Fresno State University tonight at 7 p.m. in
Maples Pavilion.
The Bulldogs did not compete in the All-Cal
Tournament in which the Cardinal captured
second, but some individual wrestlers have squared
off in previous tournaments. The Cardinal will face
an uphill battle as its most consistent wrestlers have
not fared well against Bulldog opponents. In dual
meets Stanford has a 5-4-1 record.
"Fresno has to be considered a heavy favorite.

but now is the time to do anything against them for
the team is physically and mentally ready as ever,"
Stanford Coach Chris Horpel said.
At 126 pounds, Neil Wartnik lost to Cliff Gosse
7-4 in the Doc Peterson Invitational Jan. 5. In the
All-Cal Invitational, Wartnik captured fourth. Pete
Rogers (158 pounds) lost twice to Doug Carnation
in the Cal Poly San Luis Obispo Collegiate in No
vember, but in the Doc Peterson Invitational
Rogers registered a 6-3 overtime victory over
Carnation. Rogers had a successful tournament by
taking second.
Bulldogs Allen Richburg (150 pounds) and Sam
Perez (142 pounds) both have victories against the

Cardinal, but it should be interesting to see what
difference the switch in weight classes by Jeff Haz
ard, to 150 pounds, and Scott Wiggen, to 1.42
pounds, will make.
In the All-Cal. Hazard captured fourth and Wig
gen second. In tjie recent collegiate national
rankings. Wiggen was 11th at his old weight of 150
pounds.
Jeff Bradley (134 pounds), who was named the
most outstanding wrestler in the All-Cal. has suf
fered two defeats to Joe Ifmay this season. Ifmay
won 7-6 in the Cal Poly SLO Collegiate and pinned
Bradley on the first move of the match in the Doc
Peterson Invitational.
