sy drome.)

AIDS is a life-threatening disease that attacks the
immune system ot otherwise healthy individuals, lea\ing
them prey to opportunistic infections and illnesses.
Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) tirst
appeared in the laje 1970s and has now reached epidemic
proportions around the world, with 6,000 to 7.000 known
cases in the United States alone, according to the Center
for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta.
The disease is also found in Central Africa. Haiti and
parts of Europe. It has not been found in Asia. The
United States is the only area in which the majority of the
people afflicted are gay men. In France, for example, halt
of the people with AIDS are heterosexual.
In the United States. 72 percent of the people with
AIDS are gay men. 14 percent are intravenous drug users,
5 percent are Haitian immigrants, 1 percent are hemo
philiacs and other recipients ot blood transtusion prod
ucts. and the remaining 6 percent fall into none of these
high risk categories, according to the C DC.

United States, the homophobic feelings ot the general
population have been amplified and discrimination and
violence against nav men have radically increased.

"There is a tremendous amount of discrimination
against people with AIDS, and also against gay men. with
AIDS used as an excuse." said Leonard Graff, legal direc
