# AIDS doesn't discriminate
## 
### MARY YUH Staff writer 
(In the second of u two-part series, The Daily takes a look
at how people deal with acquired immune deficiency
sy drome.)

AIDS is a life-threatening disease that attacks the
immune system ot otherwise healthy individuals, lea\ing
them prey to opportunistic infections and illnesses.
Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) tirst
appeared in the laje 1970s and has now reached epidemic
proportions around the world, with 6,000 to 7.000 known
cases in the United States alone, according to the Center
for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta.
The disease is also found in Central Africa. Haiti and
parts of Europe. It has not been found in Asia. The
United States is the only area in which the majority of the
people afflicted are gay men. In France, for example, halt
of the people with AIDS are heterosexual.
In the United States. 72 percent of the people with
AIDS are gay men. 14 percent are intravenous drug users,
5 percent are Haitian immigrants, 1 percent are hemo
philiacs and other recipients ot blood transtusion prod
ucts. and the remaining 6 percent fall into none of these
high risk categories, according to the C DC.
"Everyone is at risk for it. It is not a gay disease." said
John Lorenzini. director ot People With AIDS-San 112 ran
cisco. "The mainstream media were very selective in their
coverage, and they helped to set up the attitudes tit hostil
ity. anger and fear in the straight community. As late as
1981 they were calling it GRID for gay related immune
disease."
Since AIDS first appeared and was publicized in the
United States, the homophobic feelings ot the general
population have been amplified and discrimination and
violence against nav men have radically increased.
Lorenzini said.
"There is a tremendous amount of discrimination
against people with AIDS, and also against gay men. with
AIDS used as an excuse." said Leonard Graff, legal direc
tor of the National Gay Rights Advocates based in San
Francisco.
I lousing and employment discrimi
nation are common, he said. AIDS
has been used to justify sodomy
statutes in I exas and Georgia on the
premise that such laws will help con
trol the spread of the disease. In New
York a doctor was forced to vacate
his offices for doing research on
AIDS. 1 here is a case of a divorced
mother refusing to allow her gay ex
husband the right to visit their
children because he was in a high-risk
group for contracting AIDS.
Because of this discrimination,
confidentiality is a big issue. "People
are starting to stop participating in re
search projects because confiden
tiality is not fully ensured for the sub
jects." said Dennis McShane, presi
dent of Bay Area Physicians for
Human Rights (BAPHR) and associ
ate professor of clinical immunology
at Stanford Medical School.
BAPHR has issued statements to
the state legislature and Congress, ur
ging the enactment of legislation that
would allow Assurances of Confiden
tiality to be granted for AIDS re
search. Currently in use is a Certifi
cate of Confidentiality that allows a
researcher to protect his data and the
names of research subjects, but it
does not require him to protect the
patient from subpoena. An As
surance would provide such protec
tion and also prohibit researchers
from disclosing identifiable data.
The confidentiality issue is cur
rently centered around the blood test
that detects HTLV-111 antibodies in
the blood. This test will soon be used
in blood banks across the nation to
screen donors and thus protect
recipients of blood. The names of
those who turn up positive will be
number-coded and put on a comput
erized list along with those of

Hepatitis B, and there will be no
identification as to which disease is
the reason for the person's presence
on the list, according to J. Lawrence
Naiman. director of American Red
C ross blood services in the central
California region.
But confidentiality regarding the
results of the test is insufficient,
McShane said. There is the possibility
that a register will be formed of those
who screen positive, and fears that
the list will be used for discrimination
are not unjustified, he added. " The
concentration camps used for the
Japanese internment during World
War II are still functional, and some
of them are here in California."
The occurence of AIDS has pro
vided an opportunity for moralizing
and another excuse for discrimina
tion, said Donald Abrams, a 1977
graduate of Stanford Medical School
and currently assistant director of the
AIDS clinic at San Francisco General
Hospital.
"It appeared to reinforce the myths
about disease and its relationship to
supposed immorality and social out
casts,'" said Gerard Koskovich, a
graduate student in art history here
and a long-time gay activist.
"AIDS has become a moral issue,"
Lorenzini said. For a gay person who
is diagnosed with AIDS, "one of the
first feelings is one of being a sexual
criminal. For a non-gay person, there
is a certain element of feeling libeled,
dirty, that you're dirty because you
have AIDS," he said.
"The stigma attached to AIDS is
totally unjustified. It makes me very
angry," said Jim Rulon, a volunteer
at Shanti Project, a community or
ganization in San Francisco that pro
vides services for people with AIDS.
"It is not a gay disease. It is not a drug
abuser's disease. It just happens that
in the United States, they got it first."

AIDS is not a disease confined by
its nature to any particular group. It is
a disease that can afflict anyone, and
is most likely transmitted through
bodily fluids such as blood.
"There are members of the Stan
ford community who have AIDS, and
some have died," McShane said.
The task of telling friends and fam
ily about having the diseasi is compli
cated by the stigma, Rulon said,
causing unnecessary stress and emo
tional conflict.

"People get depressed. The abnor
mal thing is if they don't get de
pressed. It is very important to
validate their feelings of anger and
depression. These are perfectly nor
mal feelings," Rulon said.
"With a life-threatening disease,
one's perspective is totally changed.
The uncertainty is a major problem.

particularly with AIDS, where a per
son has unpredictable cycles of being
well and being ill. The up and down
nature of the disease makes it difficult
to plan anything in advance." he said.
Most people with AIDS have an
expectation of being able to improve
their immune systems, and not all
view it as a fatal illness, he said.
"They are fighting for their lives."
" There is a spectrum of reaction
among people with AIDS, from those
who feel life is over and proceed to
die or even commit suicide, to the

fighters who still demand a full,
quality life, and every reaction in be
tween," Lorenzini said.
"We don't feel that we should give
up our lives. We may not have quan
tity, but we can certainly demand and
expect quality in our lives. We can be
productive," he said. "Our goal is to
empower people to reclaim life."

At San Francisco General Hospi
tal, the doctors and nurses in the
AIDS ward make genuine efforts to
create a positive atmosphere for the
patients. Abrams said.
Working with AIDS is a challenge
and a source of frustration, according
to Abrams. "We can treat the indi
vidual infections, but not the underly
ing problem of the disease itself. Our
therapy is not perfect, not even 50
percent effective. They (the patients)
slowly wither away during the final
stages of the disease. They look like
concentration camp victims," he said.
"At this time AIDS is 100 percent
fatal," he said. Once afflicted with the
disease, a person has only a few more
years of life. The average age of the
patients is 35, close to that of the
health-care personnel.
"There is a lot of empathy among
the doctors and nurses with the AIDS
patients." Abrams said. "It is difficult
to take care of peers who are going to
die. What keeps us going is the hope
that within our lifetime the disease
will be conquered.".
"The support and care have been
wonderful," said a patient. "They do
a fantastic job."
"AIDS is the first disease that doc
tors have had absolutely no success in
treating," Lorenzini said. "The na
ture of the disease has forced a
patient-doctor dialogue. We demand
full honesty from the doctor regard
ing all aspects of our care and prog
nosis. We just want patients to be full
participants in their own health care."
"I find it refreshing that patients
choose to take part in their care."
Abrams said.
"The majority of the people with
AIDS have asked that extraordinary
life-saving measures not be taken
when the disease enters the final
stages," Lorenzini said.
"These people are pointing the way

to the rest of society about dying with
dignity." said McShane. who has a
private practice specializing in gay
men's health care. "I will not go
beyond extraordinary means to
prolong life. The patient's wishes
come first. There is a positive lesson
in these changes in medical care."
"We are hoping that these changes
will be extended to other patients."
said Lorenzini.
"We are the first collection of
patients who have banded together so
closely and on such a large scale for
education and support." he said.
People With AIDS and Shanti
Project are examples of such organi
zations. Shanti provides counseling
and emotional support to people with
AIDS and their family and friends. It
also provides practical support, such
as providing rides to medical appoint
ments. doing housekeeping chores
and cooking meals. Shanti has si\
residence houses that offer perman
ent homes to people who have been
unable to find housing or employ
ment to afford housing because of
discriminatin against their illness.
People With AIDS is staffed with
people who have the disease, and
provides counseling, support groups,
information and practical help to
people with AIDS in dealing with the
complications that arise in their lives
because of their disease and other
people's reactions.
Lorenzini stressed that the services
and support are available to everyone
who has the disease or has a friend or
relative with the disease. "We have
no desire to reciprocate discrimina
tion. We are geared to serve people
with AIDS, not only gays. It would be
a tragedy if the straight community
were to try to duplicate all these
services which are already in place.
We are prepared to work with the
heterosexual community."

proportions around the world, with 6,000 to 7.000 known
cases in the United States alone, according to the Center
for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta.
The disease is also found in Central Africa. Haiti and
parts of Europe. It has not been found in Asia. The
United States is the only area in which the majority of the
people afflicted are gay men. In France, for example, halt
of the people with AIDS are heterosexual.
In the United States. 72 percent of the people with
AIDS are gay men. 14 percent are intravenous drug users,
5 percent are Haitian immigrants, 1 percent are hemo
philiacs and other recipients ot blood transtusion prod
ucts. and the remaining 6 percent fall into none of these
high risk categories, according to the C DC.
"Everyone is at risk for it. It is not a gay disease." said
John Lorenzini. director ot People With AIDS-San 112 ran
cisco. "The mainstream media were very selective in their
coverage, and they helped to set up the attitudes tit hostil
ity. anger and fear in the straight community. As late as
1981 they were calling it GRID for gay related immune
disease."
Since AIDS first appeared and was publicized in the
United States, the homophobic feelings ot the general
population have been amplified and discrimination and
violence against nav men have radically increased.
Lorenzini said.
"There is a tremendous amount of discrimination
against people with AIDS, and also against gay men. with
AIDS used as an excuse." said Leonard Graff, legal direc
tor of the National Gay Rights Advocates based in San
Francisco.
I lousing and employment discrimi
nation are common, he said. AIDS
has been used to justify sodomy
statutes in I exas and Georgia on the
premise that such laws will help con
trol the spread of the disease. In New
York a doctor was forced to vacate
his offices for doing research on
AIDS. 1 here is a case of a divorced
mother refusing to allow her gay ex
husband the right to visit their
children because he was in a high-risk
group for contracting AIDS.
Because of this discrimination,
confidentiality is a big issue. "People
are starting to stop participating in re
search projects because confiden
tiality is not fully ensured for the sub
jects." said Dennis McShane, presi
dent of Bay Area Physicians for
Human Rights (BAPHR) and associ
ate professor of clinical immunology
at Stanford Medical School.
BAPHR has issued statements to
the state legislature and Congress, ur
ging the enactment of legislation that
would allow Assurances of Confiden
tiality to be granted for AIDS re
search. Currently in use is a Certifi
cate of Confidentiality that allows a
researcher to protect his data and the
names of research subjects, but it
does not require him to protect the
patient from subpoena. An As
surance would provide such protec
tion and also prohibit researchers
from disclosing identifiable data.
The confidentiality issue is cur
rently centered around the blood test
that detects HTLV-111 antibodies in
the blood. This test will soon be used
in blood banks across the nation to
screen donors and thus protect
recipients of blood. The names of
those who turn up positive will be
number-coded and put on a comput
erized list along with those of

Hepatitis B, and there will be no
identification as to which disease is
the reason for the person's presence
on the list, according to J. Lawrence
Naiman. director of American Red
C ross blood services in the central
California region.
But confidentiality regarding the
results of the test is insufficient,
McShane said. There is the possibility
that a register will be formed of those
who screen positive, and fears that
the list will be used for discrimination
are not unjustified, he added. " The
concentration camps used for the
Japanese internment during World
War II are still functional, and some
of them are here in California."
The occurence of AIDS has pro
vided an opportunity for moralizing
and another excuse for discrimina
tion, said Donald Abrams, a 1977
graduate of Stanford Medical School
and currently assistant director of the
AIDS clinic at San Francisco General
Hospital.
"It appeared to reinforce the myths
about disease and its relationship to
supposed immorality and social out
casts,'" said Gerard Koskovich, a
graduate student in art history here
and a long-time gay activist.
"AIDS has become a moral issue,"
Lorenzini said. For a gay person who
is diagnosed with AIDS, "one of the
first feelings is one of being a sexual
criminal. For a non-gay person, there
is a certain element of feeling libeled,
dirty, that you're dirty because you
have AIDS," he said.
"The stigma attached to AIDS is
totally unjustified. It makes me very
angry," said Jim Rulon, a volunteer
at Shanti Project, a community or
ganization in San Francisco that pro
vides services for people with AIDS.
"It is not a gay disease. It is not a drug
abuser's disease. It just happens that
in the United States, they got it first."

AIDS is not a disease confined by
its nature to any particular group. It is
a disease that can afflict anyone, and
is most likely transmitted through
bodily fluids such as blood.
"There are members of the Stan
ford community who have AIDS, and
some have died," McShane said.
The task of telling friends and fam
ily about having the diseasi is compli
cated by the stigma, Rulon said,
causing unnecessary stress and emo
tional conflict.

"People get depressed. The abnor
mal thing is if they don't get de
pressed. It is very important to
validate their feelings of anger and
depression. These are perfectly nor
mal feelings," Rulon said.
"With a life-threatening disease,
one's perspective is totally changed.
The uncertainty is a major problem.

particularly with AIDS, where a per
son has unpredictable cycles of being
well and being ill. The up and down
nature of the disease makes it difficult
to plan anything in advance." he said.
Most people with AIDS have an
expectation of being able to improve
their immune systems, and not all
view it as a fatal illness, he said.
"They are fighting for their lives."
" There is a spectrum of reaction
among people with AIDS, from those
who feel life is over and proceed to
die or even commit suicide, to the

fighters who still demand a full,
quality life, and every reaction in be
tween," Lorenzini said.
"We don't feel that we should give
up our lives. We may not have quan
tity, but we can certainly demand and
expect quality in our lives. We can be
productive," he said. "Our goal is to
empower people to reclaim life."

At San Francisco General Hospi
tal, the doctors and nurses in the
AIDS ward make genuine efforts to
create a positive atmosphere for the
patients. Abrams said.
Working with AIDS is a challenge
and a source of frustration, according
to Abrams. "We can treat the indi
vidual infections, but not the underly
ing problem of the disease itself. Our
therapy is not perfect, not even 50
percent effective. They (the patients)
slowly wither away during the final
stages of the disease. They look like
concentration camp victims," he said.
"At this time AIDS is 100 percent
fatal," he said. Once afflicted with the
disease, a person has only a few more
years of life. The average age of the
patients is 35, close to that of the
health-care personnel.
"There is a lot of empathy among
the doctors and nurses with the AIDS
patients." Abrams said. "It is difficult
to take care of peers who are going to
die. What keeps us going is the hope
that within our lifetime the disease
will be conquered.".
"The support and care have been
wonderful," said a patient. "They do
a fantastic job."
"AIDS is the first disease that doc
tors have had absolutely no success in
treating," Lorenzini said. "The na
ture of the disease has forced a
patient-doctor dialogue. We demand
full honesty from the doctor regard
ing all aspects of our care and prog
nosis. We just want patients to be full
participants in their own health care."
"I find it refreshing that patients
choose to take part in their care."
Abrams said.
"The majority of the people with
AIDS have asked that extraordinary
life-saving measures not be taken
when the disease enters the final
stages," Lorenzini said.
"These people are pointing the way

to the rest of society about dying with
dignity." said McShane. who has a
private practice specializing in gay
men's health care. "I will not go
beyond extraordinary means to
prolong life. The patient's wishes
come first. There is a positive lesson
in these changes in medical care."
"We are hoping that these changes
will be extended to other patients."
said Lorenzini.
"We are the first collection of
patients who have banded together so
closely and on such a large scale for
education and support." he said.
People With AIDS and Shanti
Project are examples of such organi
zations. Shanti provides counseling
and emotional support to people with
AIDS and their family and friends. It
also provides practical support, such
as providing rides to medical appoint
ments. doing housekeeping chores
and cooking meals. Shanti has si\
residence houses that offer perman
ent homes to people who have been
unable to find housing or employ
ment to afford housing because of
discriminatin against their illness.
People With AIDS is staffed with
people who have the disease, and
provides counseling, support groups,
information and practical help to
people with AIDS in dealing with the
complications that arise in their lives
because of their disease and other
people's reactions.
Lorenzini stressed that the services
and support are available to everyone
who has the disease or has a friend or
relative with the disease. "We have
no desire to reciprocate discrimina
tion. We are geared to serve people
with AIDS, not only gays. It would be
a tragedy if the straight community
were to try to duplicate all these
services which are already in place.
We are prepared to work with the
heterosexual community."

people afflicted are gay men. In France, for example, halt
of the people with AIDS are heterosexual.
In the United States. 72 percent of the people with
AIDS are gay men. 14 percent are intravenous drug users,
5 percent are Haitian immigrants, 1 percent are hemo
philiacs and other recipients ot blood transtusion prod
ucts. and the remaining 6 percent fall into none of these
high risk categories, according to the C DC.
"Everyone is at risk for it. It is not a gay disease." said
John Lorenzini. director ot People With AIDS-San 112 ran
cisco. "The mainstream media were very selective in their
coverage, and they helped to set up the attitudes tit hostil
ity. anger and fear in the straight community. As late as
1981 they were calling it GRID for gay related immune
disease."
Since AIDS first appeared and was publicized in the
United States, the homophobic feelings ot the general
population have been amplified and discrimination and
violence against nav men have radically increased.
Lorenzini said.
"There is a tremendous amount of discrimination
against people with AIDS, and also against gay men. with
AIDS used as an excuse." said Leonard Graff, legal direc
tor of the National Gay Rights Advocates based in San
Francisco.
I lousing and employment discrimi
nation are common, he said. AIDS
has been used to justify sodomy
statutes in I exas and Georgia on the
premise that such laws will help con
trol the spread of the disease. In New
York a doctor was forced to vacate
his offices for doing research on
AIDS. 1 here is a case of a divorced
mother refusing to allow her gay ex
husband the right to visit their
children because he was in a high-risk
group for contracting AIDS.
Because of this discrimination,
confidentiality is a big issue. "People
are starting to stop participating in re
search projects because confiden
tiality is not fully ensured for the sub
jects." said Dennis McShane, presi
dent of Bay Area Physicians for
Human Rights (BAPHR) and associ
ate professor of clinical immunology
at Stanford Medical School.
BAPHR has issued statements to
the state legislature and Congress, ur
ging the enactment of legislation that
would allow Assurances of Confiden
tiality to be granted for AIDS re
search. Currently in use is a Certifi
cate of Confidentiality that allows a
researcher to protect his data and the
names of research subjects, but it
does not require him to protect the
patient from subpoena. An As
surance would provide such protec
tion and also prohibit researchers
from disclosing identifiable data.
The confidentiality issue is cur
rently centered around the blood test
that detects HTLV-111 antibodies in
the blood. This test will soon be used
in blood banks across the nation to
screen donors and thus protect
recipients of blood. The names of
those who turn up positive will be
number-coded and put on a comput
erized list along with those of

Hepatitis B, and there will be no
identification as to which disease is
the reason for the person's presence
on the list, according to J. Lawrence
Naiman. director of American Red
C ross blood services in the central
California region.
But confidentiality regarding the
results of the test is insufficient,
McShane said. There is the possibility
that a register will be formed of those
who screen positive, and fears that
the list will be used for discrimination
are not unjustified, he added. " The
concentration camps used for the
Japanese internment during World
War II are still functional, and some
of them are here in California."
The occurence of AIDS has pro
vided an opportunity for moralizing
and another excuse for discrimina
tion, said Donald Abrams, a 1977
graduate of Stanford Medical School
and currently assistant director of the
AIDS clinic at San Francisco General
Hospital.
"It appeared to reinforce the myths
about disease and its relationship to
supposed immorality and social out
casts,'" said Gerard Koskovich, a
graduate student in art history here
and a long-time gay activist.
"AIDS has become a moral issue,"
Lorenzini said. For a gay person who
is diagnosed with AIDS, "one of the
first feelings is one of being a sexual
criminal. For a non-gay person, there
is a certain element of feeling libeled,
dirty, that you're dirty because you
have AIDS," he said.
"The stigma attached to AIDS is
totally unjustified. It makes me very
angry," said Jim Rulon, a volunteer
at Shanti Project, a community or
ganization in San Francisco that pro
vides services for people with AIDS.
"It is not a gay disease. It is not a drug
abuser's disease. It just happens that
in the United States, they got it first."

AIDS is not a disease confined by
its nature to any particular group. It is
a disease that can afflict anyone, and
is most likely transmitted through
bodily fluids such as blood.
"There are members of the Stan
ford community who have AIDS, and
some have died," McShane said.
The task of telling friends and fam
ily about having the diseasi is compli
cated by the stigma, Rulon said,
causing unnecessary stress and emo
tional conflict.

"People get depressed. The abnor
mal thing is if they don't get de
pressed. It is very important to
validate their feelings of anger and
depression. These are perfectly nor
mal feelings," Rulon said.
"With a life-threatening disease,
one's perspective is totally changed.
The uncertainty is a major problem.

particularly with AIDS, where a per
son has unpredictable cycles of being
well and being ill. The up and down
nature of the disease makes it difficult
to plan anything in advance." he said.
Most people with AIDS have an
expectation of being able to improve
their immune systems, and not all
view it as a fatal illness, he said.
"They are fighting for their lives."
" There is a spectrum of reaction
among people with AIDS, from those
who feel life is over and proceed to
die or even commit suicide, to the

fighters who still demand a full,
quality life, and every reaction in be
tween," Lorenzini said.
"We don't feel that we should give
up our lives. We may not have quan
tity, but we can certainly demand and
expect quality in our lives. We can be
productive," he said. "Our goal is to
empower people to reclaim life."

At San Francisco General Hospi
tal, the doctors and nurses in the
AIDS ward make genuine efforts to
create a positive atmosphere for the
patients. Abrams said.
Working with AIDS is a challenge
and a source of frustration, according
to Abrams. "We can treat the indi
vidual infections, but not the underly
ing problem of the disease itself. Our
therapy is not perfect, not even 50
percent effective. They (the patients)
slowly wither away during the final
stages of the disease. They look like
concentration camp victims," he said.
"At this time AIDS is 100 percent
fatal," he said. Once afflicted with the
disease, a person has only a few more
years of life. The average age of the
patients is 35, close to that of the
health-care personnel.
"There is a lot of empathy among
the doctors and nurses with the AIDS
patients." Abrams said. "It is difficult
to take care of peers who are going to
die. What keeps us going is the hope
that within our lifetime the disease
will be conquered.".
"The support and care have been
wonderful," said a patient. "They do
a fantastic job."
"AIDS is the first disease that doc
tors have had absolutely no success in
treating," Lorenzini said. "The na
ture of the disease has forced a
patient-doctor dialogue. We demand
full honesty from the doctor regard
ing all aspects of our care and prog
nosis. We just want patients to be full
participants in their own health care."
"I find it refreshing that patients
choose to take part in their care."
Abrams said.
"The majority of the people with
AIDS have asked that extraordinary
life-saving measures not be taken
when the disease enters the final
stages," Lorenzini said.
"These people are pointing the way

to the rest of society about dying with
dignity." said McShane. who has a
private practice specializing in gay
men's health care. "I will not go
beyond extraordinary means to
prolong life. The patient's wishes
come first. There is a positive lesson
in these changes in medical care."
"We are hoping that these changes
will be extended to other patients."
said Lorenzini.
"We are the first collection of
patients who have banded together so
closely and on such a large scale for
education and support." he said.
People With AIDS and Shanti
Project are examples of such organi
zations. Shanti provides counseling
and emotional support to people with
AIDS and their family and friends. It
also provides practical support, such
as providing rides to medical appoint
ments. doing housekeeping chores
and cooking meals. Shanti has si\
residence houses that offer perman
ent homes to people who have been
unable to find housing or employ
ment to afford housing because of
discriminatin against their illness.
People With AIDS is staffed with
people who have the disease, and
provides counseling, support groups,
information and practical help to
people with AIDS in dealing with the
complications that arise in their lives
because of their disease and other
people's reactions.
Lorenzini stressed that the services
and support are available to everyone
who has the disease or has a friend or
relative with the disease. "We have
no desire to reciprocate discrimina
tion. We are geared to serve people
with AIDS, not only gays. It would be
a tragedy if the straight community
were to try to duplicate all these
services which are already in place.
We are prepared to work with the
heterosexual community."

(In the second of u two-part series, The Daily takes a look
at how people deal with acquired immune deficiency
sy drome.)

AIDS is a life-threatening disease that attacks the
immune system ot otherwise healthy individuals, lea\ing
them prey to opportunistic infections and illnesses.
Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) tirst
appeared in the laje 1970s and has now reached epidemic
proportions around the world, with 6,000 to 7.000 known
cases in the United States alone, according to the Center
for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta.
The disease is also found in Central Africa. Haiti and
parts of Europe. It has not been found in Asia. The
United States is the only area in which the majority of the
people afflicted are gay men. In France, for example, halt
of the people with AIDS are heterosexual.
