# Edit. Board Grill Session
## 
### 
There appear to be 12 candidates for the three
at-large Vol. 187 Editorial Board positions. All
candidates will be on hand tomorrow at noon for
what is called, in more polite circles, a question-and
answer period with Daily staff members. Only Daily
staffers who attend the Grill Session will be allowed
to vote in the Editorial Board election, so be sure to
be there. Lunch will be served.
