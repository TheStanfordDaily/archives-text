# Hunger workshop
## SIDO to address Third World problems 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Staff Writer 
Student members of the Stanford International Devel
opment Organization (SIDO) are helping to organize a
workshop aimed at increasing awareness of the causes and
problems of Third World hunger.
The hunger workshop, a register-only course open to
undergraduates and graduate students, is designed to help
students understand the complex nutritional, social and
political consequences of hunger throughout the world,
say SIDO members. It is being coordinated by SIDO
member Nazir Ahmad, a graduate student at the Food
Research Institute and co-founder of the Overseas Devel
opment Network (ODN), an umbrella organization
linking various student groups concerned with Third
World issues at colleges and universities across the
country.
•"About a year ago, a group of Stanford and Harvard
students, collectively interested in the hunger problem,
decided to form a common organization to voice our in
terest," Ahmad said.
"Interest in this is usually unrepresented, and there
were certain gains that could be made by working to
gether." There are currently 30 campus chapters of ODN
in the United States, he said.
•'The network goals," Ahmad said, "are to help stu
dents create resources that will help future students, ad

dressing the issue in a serious and competent manner.
The key to the SIDO effort will be the development ot
an informational booklet produced by the Stanford
workshop, to be distributed to various campus depart
ments and ODN branches at other universities.
"The workshop i-> aimed at students and othei
lay people." Ahmad said. "We will create resources thai
don't just stay at Stanford, but will go beyond."
Several SIDO members are also assisting in the plan
ning of a Universitv -sponsored public service conference
on domestic and international hunger that will be held
here April 8-13.
"We're going to try to create a community of concerned
and thoughtful people and help them explore ways in
which they can be involved," Ahmad said.
Ahmad pointed out some of the difficulties in assessing
the problem.
" I lunger is not a simple thing — whether it is a problem
of availability. political reasons or some combination ot
factors. Even so. we also want to point out some ot the
success stories. We're concerned that the interest going on
right now might be a media event that w ill soon go away.
Ahmad realizes that the problem will not be easily
solved.
"Ours is a modest but sustained effort, he said. "Its a
tough issue, but in this age of knowledge, it can be han
dled."
