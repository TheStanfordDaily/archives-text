I hc Barchas scientific book collec
tion dedicated tin Sunday was
donated by Samuel — not James —
Barchas and his wife. Ceeile. It con
tains nearly 2.000 volumes of first
edition texts. The Daily regrets the
error.
The headline "Suspended: Phi
Delts put 011 probation" used with
yesterday's article on the Phi Delta
Theta fraternity referred to the
suspension of privileges commen
surate with probation. It was not
meant to imply that the fraternity has
been officially suspended by the Uni
versity.
