### ALLISON HARTWELL 
The root of the Arab-Israel conflict is the
Arabian refusal to recognize Israel, which is a
"a symptom of a more basic attitude . . . which
negates the very right for an Israel to exist." a
former member of the Israeli Military Govern
ment said here last night.
Menachem Milson. a professor of Arabic
literature at Hebrew University in Jerusalem,
told about 120 people in Terman Auditorium
that this ostracization of Israel is a preparation
for the "destruction of Israel" that is "tar more
dangerous than the accumulation of military
hardware." This view inhibits negotiations for
both Israel and the Palestinians, in addition to
being a "useful instrument for ruling elites to
maintain power."
In order to solve the conflict, those involved

must examine the issues "dispassionately and
rationally" because "the public is used to the
perpetuity of the problem, but not used to sol
ving it." Milson said.
As a case in point, he said the late Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat "had the courage to
change his political behavior and the political
behavior of his country" in order to work
toward peace.
Israel has the potential to bring vast "socio
economic changes" to the West Bank, which is
the home for the majority of the Palestinian
constituency. The political leadership in the
area i-< "toeing the line" of the Palestinian
Liberation Organization (Pl.O). and although

Arab capitals economically, lie said.
Milson said he hopes Israel will
able to end such patronage money hy

with no strings attached. Although it
would take massive financing, such

According to Milson. the course Is

promises within the tactions ot the Is
raeli government.
In addition, both sides must put an
end to terrorism, according to Milson.
Outside the auditorium, members
of the Committee lor Justice in the

here, passed out copies of articles
condemning Milson and his policies
while chief of the civil administration
of Judea and Samaria, calling his ad
