## Firm to interview students again 
### JULIE RYAN Daily staff 
A vice president of investment hank
Goldman Sachs offered yesterday to re
interview all students who were interviewed by
Sachs' employee Michael Werner after students
complained they were asked questions about re
ligion. sex and abortion.
Werner, who graduated from Stanford two
years ago with a masters in industrial engineer
ing. is now an associate at Goldman Sachs and
was interviewing students at the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center last week for a two
year analyst job.
A senior woman, who asked that her name
be withheld, said. "•[Werner] asked me if I
would have an abortion to save my job." She
said that this question and several others led her
to complain to the head of recruiting at the
CPPC.
"When I walked out of the interview I was
terribly angry," she said.
CPPC Director Christopher Shinkman said
four or five students complained that Werner
asked inappropriate questions and had an
abrasive manner during the interviews. Al
though the legality of several questions is un
clear, Shinkman said "the questions that people
repeated to me were questionable enough that I
decided to take action by contacting Goldman
Sachs."
Another woman, speaking on the condition
she not be named, said that during an interview
Werner asked her whether she was religious.
She said he told her he was just trying to figure
out it she was a "good girl" or a "partier" and
did not care what her religion was.
Werner said yesterday it was possible that he
may have raised religious questions during the
interview, but said "that's different than asking
what their religion is. It was in the context of a
style. I talked about people and tried to find out
what kind of person they were.
"Goldman Sachs hires every kind of person in
the world," he added.
Shinkman said he has only second-hand
knowledge of the questions, but said some al
legedly related to religion, sexual preference,
drugs and abortion.
Shinkman reached Werner, who is now in
New York, by telephone yesterday morning. "I
talked to Werner and told him about our very
great concern over his inapporopriate behavior
and manner in the interview," Shinkman said.
"He expressed regret and said he hoped his ac
tion would not jeopardize relations between the
company and the University."
"1 think he (Werner) is a sober young man
right now and very aware of the seriousness of
the situation," Shinkman added. "He was just

way out of bounds."
Shinkman said the students' beliet was that
Werner "was not being malicious and was
not trying 'to get' someone, but that he simply
didn't know what he was doing."
Shinkman also talked to Don Cornwell.
Werner's supervisor in charge of recruiting at
the undergraduate level. "Cornwell said he
would be willing to come back out here and
conduct interviews with people who had inter
views with Werner." Shinkman said. "I think
that action is appropriate, but I'm not sure it
people will be interested in a new interview."
Shinkman said he is contacting the students
involved by telephone and mail to determine in
terest.
The woman who told The Daily that she was
asked about abortion said. "I don't want an
other interview with them (Goldman Sachs).
After everything that's happened, I'm just not
interested."
Early yesterday. Werner said, "My interview
ing was a little different and somewhat experi
mental. What I was trying to do was | to | create a
charged situation in which a person was made to
think. I wanted to see if the person could think,
is ambitious and can handle pressure."
Werner denied he asked any woman whether
she would have an abortion. He said he asked
the interviewee only "a hypothetical case that
had nothing to do with her."
He did say he asked at least one woman
whether she would advise a friend who had an
important project that would take 10 months to
complete and was pregnant to have an abortion.
"It was not a question about abortion." he
said. "1 told them, I don't care about your
views on abortion." " Instead, he said he wanted
to find out if a prospective employee "would go
to the end of the world to be a professional."
The woman who said he asked her about
abortion said the question came up alter
Werner asked her if "1 considered myself a pro
fessional woman, and whether 1 wanted to have
a career and a family." She said she replied that
the question was a bit unfair because he
"wouldn't ask the same question it it were a
man sitting here.
"The next thing he asked me was whethei !
would have an abortion to save my job." she
said.
Werner said he asked both men and women
about abortion. He said he gave a man the
hypothetical situation of a "virtual stranger'
coming to him for advice on abortion and asked
him to "discuss what issues he would help that
person think about."
"I wanted to see if people have an open mind
and sec if they'd consider the issues."
he said. "I agree that to ask someone
their thoughts or values on abortion is
out of line. And no decisions on
hiring were based on anything the\
said about that."
Other people interviewed by
Werner expressed more concern re
garding his manner than on specific
questions. "Basically he used a tactic
to put a lot of pressure on you. which
I think is fine." said Thomas Battat. a
senior majoring in industrial engi
neering. "It's one thing to put on
pressure hut there's got to be some
interviewing ethics.
"With me. what he tried to do was
yell and swear at me to put on pres
sure. I wan t devastated by it or any
thing. I took it as a challenge."
Battat said Werner called items 011
his resume "total bullshit," and
referred to professors Battat said he
liked by saying. "That guy's a total
asshole."
Battat also said that during a dis
cussion of managerial style in which
Battat supported Hewlett-Packard's
"no firing policy." Werner said. "No.
you just don't have any balls to fire
anybody."
When informed about Goldman
Sachs offer to re-interview people.
Battat said he though it was appropri
ate. "I think it would be too bad if
people thought this one person
represented Goldman Sachs policy."
Cornwell said, "The substance of
some of the questions is not the way
Goldman Sachs interviews and that's
not our style!
"I think he was trying to draw out a
response from people." he explained.
"He has a tendency to get a little
overzealous." He said this may have
to do with the fact that Werner
graduated from Stanford just two
years ago and did not realize "that
when you have on a recruiter's hat,
you have a very different role to

play ."
Cornwell said he thinks it was ap
propriate for people to file a com
plaint. "The thing to do is speak up.
There's nothing wrong with that." lie
said.
"We're working hard to have a
good relationship with Stanford. . . .
We really don't want people angry
with lis and would like to make
amends. We will come back if re
quested."
Werner said Stanford is the first
school he has had to interview,
though he has conducted some inter
views at the New York offices. He
said his interviewing method was
"more my own style" than that ol
Goldman Sachs. He said he was not
trained extensively by the firm before
being sent 011 the recruiting trip.
Shinkman said firms generally send
recruiters with more experience. "It
they're not professional personnel
people, then they're usually managers
who have gone through a training
program."
"It seems obvious that that hasn't
happened here." he said.
Edward Wheeler, a senior major
ing in economics, was one of the stu
dents who went to CPPC officials to
express his discomfort with his inter
view. After talking with four other
students about their interviews, he
wrote a letter to Goldman Sachs in
"an effort to [protest formally I what
many Stanford seniors felt were
highly unethical, non-objective and
possibly illegal interviewing tactics
which were displayed by at least one
of your interviewers during the closed
interview schedule."
Later in the letter Wheeler said.
"How do you suppose one applicant
felt, when upon greeting Mr. Werner
with a 'nice to meet you." he
responded with how can you say that
before you've met me?"
Wheeler ended the letter by saying,
"I cannot responsibly condemn your
entire company for the rude and un
called for behavior of one person."

A vice president of investment hank
Goldman Sachs offered yesterday to re
interview all students who were interviewed by
Sachs' employee Michael Werner after students
complained they were asked questions about re
ligion. sex and abortion.
Werner, who graduated from Stanford two
years ago with a masters in industrial engineer
ing. is now an associate at Goldman Sachs and
was interviewing students at the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center last week for a two
year analyst job.
A senior woman, who asked that her name
be withheld, said. "•[Werner] asked me if I
would have an abortion to save my job." She
said that this question and several others led her
to complain to the head of recruiting at the
CPPC.
"When I walked out of the interview I was
terribly angry," she said.
CPPC Director Christopher Shinkman said
four or five students complained that Werner
asked inappropriate questions and had an
abrasive manner during the interviews. Al
though the legality of several questions is un
clear, Shinkman said "the questions that people
repeated to me were questionable enough that I
decided to take action by contacting Goldman
Sachs."
Another woman, speaking on the condition
she not be named, said that during an interview
Werner asked her whether she was religious.
She said he told her he was just trying to figure
out it she was a "good girl" or a "partier" and
did not care what her religion was.
Werner said yesterday it was possible that he
may have raised religious questions during the
interview, but said "that's different than asking
what their religion is. It was in the context of a
style. I talked about people and tried to find out
what kind of person they were.
"Goldman Sachs hires every kind of person in
the world," he added.
Shinkman said he has only second-hand
knowledge of the questions, but said some al
legedly related to religion, sexual preference,
drugs and abortion.
Shinkman reached Werner, who is now in
New York, by telephone yesterday morning. "I
talked to Werner and told him about our very
great concern over his inapporopriate behavior
and manner in the interview," Shinkman said.
"He expressed regret and said he hoped his ac
tion would not jeopardize relations between the
company and the University."
"1 think he (Werner) is a sober young man
right now and very aware of the seriousness of
the situation," Shinkman added. "He was just

way out of bounds."
Shinkman said the students' beliet was that
Werner "was not being malicious and was
not trying 'to get' someone, but that he simply
didn't know what he was doing."
Shinkman also talked to Don Cornwell.
Werner's supervisor in charge of recruiting at
the undergraduate level. "Cornwell said he
would be willing to come back out here and
conduct interviews with people who had inter
views with Werner." Shinkman said. "I think
that action is appropriate, but I'm not sure it
people will be interested in a new interview."
Shinkman said he is contacting the students
involved by telephone and mail to determine in
terest.
The woman who told The Daily that she was
asked about abortion said. "I don't want an
other interview with them (Goldman Sachs).
After everything that's happened, I'm just not
interested."
Early yesterday. Werner said, "My interview
ing was a little different and somewhat experi
mental. What I was trying to do was | to | create a
charged situation in which a person was made to
think. I wanted to see if the person could think,
is ambitious and can handle pressure."
Werner denied he asked any woman whether
she would have an abortion. He said he asked
the interviewee only "a hypothetical case that
had nothing to do with her."
He did say he asked at least one woman
whether she would advise a friend who had an
important project that would take 10 months to
complete and was pregnant to have an abortion.
"It was not a question about abortion." he
said. "1 told them, I don't care about your
views on abortion." " Instead, he said he wanted
to find out if a prospective employee "would go
to the end of the world to be a professional."
The woman who said he asked her about
abortion said the question came up alter
Werner asked her if "1 considered myself a pro
fessional woman, and whether 1 wanted to have
a career and a family." She said she replied that
the question was a bit unfair because he
"wouldn't ask the same question it it were a
man sitting here.
"The next thing he asked me was whethei !
would have an abortion to save my job." she
said.
Werner said he asked both men and women
about abortion. He said he gave a man the
hypothetical situation of a "virtual stranger'
coming to him for advice on abortion and asked
him to "discuss what issues he would help that
person think about."
"I wanted to see if people have an open mind
and sec if they'd consider the issues."
he said. "I agree that to ask someone
their thoughts or values on abortion is
out of line. And no decisions on
hiring were based on anything the\
said about that."
Other people interviewed by
Werner expressed more concern re
garding his manner than on specific
questions. "Basically he used a tactic
to put a lot of pressure on you. which
I think is fine." said Thomas Battat. a
senior majoring in industrial engi
neering. "It's one thing to put on
pressure hut there's got to be some
interviewing ethics.
"With me. what he tried to do was
yell and swear at me to put on pres
sure. I wan t devastated by it or any
thing. I took it as a challenge."
Battat said Werner called items 011
his resume "total bullshit," and
referred to professors Battat said he
liked by saying. "That guy's a total
asshole."
Battat also said that during a dis
cussion of managerial style in which
Battat supported Hewlett-Packard's
"no firing policy." Werner said. "No.
you just don't have any balls to fire
anybody."

He did say he asked at least one woman
whether she would advise a friend who had an
important project that would take 10 months to
complete and was pregnant to have an abortion.
"It was not a question about abortion." he
said. "1 told them, I don't care about your
views on abortion." " Instead, he said he wanted
to find out if a prospective employee "would go
to the end of the world to be a professional."
The woman who said he asked her about
abortion said the question came up alter
Werner asked her if "1 considered myself a pro
fessional woman, and whether 1 wanted to have
a career and a family." She said she replied that
the question was a bit unfair because he
"wouldn't ask the same question it it were a
man sitting here.
"The next thing he asked me was whethei !
would have an abortion to save my job." she
said.
Werner said he asked both men and women
about abortion. He said he gave a man the
hypothetical situation of a "virtual stranger'
coming to him for advice on abortion and asked
him to "discuss what issues he would help that
person think about."
"I wanted to see if people have an open mind
and sec if they'd consider the issues."
he said. "I agree that to ask someone
their thoughts or values on abortion is
out of line. And no decisions on
hiring were based on anything the\
said about that."
Other people interviewed by
Werner expressed more concern re
garding his manner than on specific
questions. "Basically he used a tactic
to put a lot of pressure on you. which
I think is fine." said Thomas Battat. a
senior majoring in industrial engi
neering. "It's one thing to put on
pressure hut there's got to be some
interviewing ethics.
"With me. what he tried to do was
yell and swear at me to put on pres
sure. I wan t devastated by it or any
thing. I took it as a challenge."
Battat said Werner called items 011
his resume "total bullshit," and
referred to professors Battat said he
liked by saying. "That guy's a total
asshole."
Battat also said that during a dis
cussion of managerial style in which
Battat supported Hewlett-Packard's
"no firing policy." Werner said. "No.
you just don't have any balls to fire
anybody."
When informed about Goldman
Sachs offer to re-interview people.
Battat said he though it was appropri
ate. "I think it would be too bad if
people thought this one person
represented Goldman Sachs policy."
Cornwell said, "The substance of
some of the questions is not the way
Goldman Sachs interviews and that's
not our style!
"I think he was trying to draw out a
response from people." he explained.
"He has a tendency to get a little
overzealous." He said this may have
to do with the fact that Werner
graduated from Stanford just two
years ago and did not realize "that
when you have on a recruiter's hat,
you have a very different role to

play ."
Cornwell said he thinks it was ap
propriate for people to file a com
plaint. "The thing to do is speak up.
There's nothing wrong with that." lie
said.
"We're working hard to have a
good relationship with Stanford. . . .
We really don't want people angry
with lis and would like to make
amends. We will come back if re
quested."
Werner said Stanford is the first
school he has had to interview,
though he has conducted some inter
views at the New York offices. He
said his interviewing method was
"more my own style" than that ol
Goldman Sachs. He said he was not
trained extensively by the firm before
being sent 011 the recruiting trip.
Shinkman said firms generally send
recruiters with more experience. "It
they're not professional personnel
people, then they're usually managers
who have gone through a training
program."
"It seems obvious that that hasn't
happened here." he said.
Edward Wheeler, a senior major
ing in economics, was one of the stu
dents who went to CPPC officials to
express his discomfort with his inter
view. After talking with four other
students about their interviews, he
wrote a letter to Goldman Sachs in
"an effort to [protest formally I what
many Stanford seniors felt were
highly unethical, non-objective and
possibly illegal interviewing tactics
which were displayed by at least one
of your interviewers during the closed
interview schedule."
Later in the letter Wheeler said.
"How do you suppose one applicant
felt, when upon greeting Mr. Werner
with a 'nice to meet you." he
responded with how can you say that
before you've met me?"
Wheeler ended the letter by saying,
"I cannot responsibly condemn your
entire company for the rude and un
called for behavior of one person."
