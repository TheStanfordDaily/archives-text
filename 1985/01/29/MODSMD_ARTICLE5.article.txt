## Firm to interview students again 
### JULIE RYAN Daily staff 
A vice president of investment hank
Goldman Sachs offered yesterday to re
interview all students who were interviewed by
Sachs' employee Michael Werner after students
complained they were asked questions about re
ligion. sex and abortion.
Werner, who graduated from Stanford two
years ago with a masters in industrial engineer
ing. is now an associate at Goldman Sachs and
was interviewing students at the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center last week for a two
year analyst job.
A senior woman, who asked that her name
be withheld, said. "â€¢[Werner] asked me if I
would have an abortion to save my job." She
said that this question and several others led her
to complain to the head of recruiting at the
CPPC.
"When I walked out of the interview I was
terribly angry," she said.
CPPC Director Christopher Shinkman said
four or five students complained that Werner
asked inappropriate questions and had an
abrasive manner during the interviews. Al
though the legality of several questions is un
clear, Shinkman said "the questions that people
repeated to me were questionable enough that I
decided to take action by contacting Goldman
Sachs."
Another woman, speaking on the condition
she not be named, said that during an interview
Werner asked her whether she was religious.
She said he told her he was just trying to figure
out it she was a "good girl" or a "partier" and
did not care what her religion was.
Werner said yesterday it was possible that he
may have raised religious questions during the
interview, but said "that's different than asking
what their religion is. It was in the context of a
style. I talked about people and tried to find out
what kind of person they were.
"Goldman Sachs hires every kind of person in
the world," he added.
Shinkman said he has only second-hand
knowledge of the questions, but said some al
legedly related to religion, sexual preference,
drugs and abortion.
Shinkman reached Werner, who is now in
New York, by telephone yesterday morning. "I
talked to Werner and told him about our very
great concern over his inapporopriate behavior
and manner in the interview," Shinkman said.
"He expressed regret and said he hoped his ac
tion would not jeopardize relations between the
company and the University."
"1 think he (Werner) is a sober young man
right now and very aware of the seriousness of
the situation," Shinkman added. "He was just

way out of bounds."
Shinkman said the students' beliet was that
Werner "was not being malicious and was
not trying 'to get' someone, but that he simply
didn't know what he was doing."
Shinkman also talked to Don Cornwell.
Werner's supervisor in charge of recruiting at
the undergraduate level. "Cornwell said he
would be willing to come back out here and
conduct interviews with people who had inter
views with Werner." Shinkman said. "I think
that action is appropriate, but I'm not sure it
people will be interested in a new interview."
Shinkman said he is contacting the students
involved by telephone and mail to determine in
terest.
The woman who told The Daily that she was
asked about abortion said. "I don't want an
other interview with them (Goldman Sachs).
After everything that's happened, I'm just not
interested."
Early yesterday. Werner said, "My interview
ing was a little different and somewhat experi
mental. What I was trying to do was | to | create a
charged situation in which a person was made to
think. I wanted to see if the person could think,
is ambitious and can handle pressure."
Werner denied he asked any woman whether
she would have an abortion. He said he asked
the interviewee only "a hypothetical case that
had nothing to do with her."
He did say he asked at least one woman
whether she would advise a friend who had an
important project that would take 10 months to
complete and was pregnant to have an abortion.
"It was not a question about abortion." he
said. "1 told them, I don't care about your
views on abortion." " Instead, he said he wanted
to find out if a prospective employee "would go
to the end of the world to be a professional."
The woman who said he asked her about
abortion said the question came up alter
Werner asked her if "1 considered myself a pro
fessional woman, and whether 1 wanted to have
a career and a family." She said she replied that
the question was a bit unfair because he
"wouldn't ask the same question it it were a
man sitting here.
"The next thing he asked me was whethei !
would have an abortion to save my job." she
said.
Werner said he asked both men and women
about abortion. He said he gave a man the
hypothetical situation of a "virtual stranger'
coming to him for advice on abortion and asked
him to "discuss what issues he would help that
person think about."
"I wanted to see if people have an open mind
