# VD study to test interferon cure
## 
### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER Senior staff writer 
Researchers from Stanford's de
partment of gynecology and
obstetrics are looking for 90 females
to test a prospective cure for a
venereal disease that affects more
than one million people in the United
States.
The disease, technically known as
condylomata acuminata, is character
ized by warts in the genital region.
The new treatment will be a surface
ointment containing interferon, a
virus-fighting protein produced
naturally by the body.
Interferon, given as an injection,
has been used effectively in the treat
ment of AIDS (acquired immune
deficiency syndrome) and other
sexually transmitted diseases, accord
ing to Barbara Story, one of the main
researchers working on the project.
The disease is particularly danger
ous because people may not notice
the warts untii they get large. Story
said.
"It is very epidemic and very hard
to treat," Story said. "It's not normal,
it needs to be taken care of."
The Stanford study is being headed
by Drs. Nelson Teng and Thomas
Merigan. Teng is an assistant profes
sor of gynecology and obstetrics and
Merigan is head of the infectious
diseases division at the Stanford
Medical Center.
The researchers are also concerned
about treating affected women be
cause the warts have been associated
with cervical cancer in rare cases.

Story said that women may not find
out they are infected until they have a
routine pap smear during a
gynecological exam.
One study showed that for every
woman with venereal warts, there are
two men affected by the disease, ac
cording to Story.
"There is a serious and extensive
problem in the gay community,"
Story said.
Although thousands of men are af
fected by the disease each year, the
researchers have decided to treat only
women because the interferon they
have produced attacks specifically the
mucus that women develop. The
chemical composition of the male dis
charge is different and would not be
killed by the form of interferon the
Stanford researchers plan to use in
their study.
"We want a uniform study," Story
said.
The participants in the project will
be instructed to use the medication
three times per day for four weeks.
Asked if the condition would be
cleared up within a month if a cure is
found. Story responded. "Yes, ab
solutely."
The subjects will be followed for
six additional months to ensure that
the disease has not returned.
Asked about the possibility of side
effects from the ointment. Story said,
"We're not expecting any. ... I really
doubt it."
The researchers have mailed letters
to 300 private physicians and clinics
to advertise the study.
