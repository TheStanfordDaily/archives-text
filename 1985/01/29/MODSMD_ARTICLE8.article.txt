Extremists attack NATO ships
1 ISBON. Portugal — Three mortar rounds were fired at NATO war
ships anchored in l.isbon harbor early yesterday hut tell into the water
100 yards short of their target, police said, and left-wing extremists later
claimed responsibility for the attack.
It was the fourth attempted attack against North Adantic Treaty Or
ganization or U.S. installations here in three months and followed a se
ries ot terrorist raids on alliance bases in Europe.
Police bomb-squad officials said the shells were launched at 3 a.m.
local time from terraced gardens that overlook the harbor on the River
I agus estuary here where six frigates of NATO's standing Atlantic force
were docked. A shadowy extremist group, the Popular Forces of April
25. telephoned news agencies later to claim responsibility for the attack.
I he attempted strike against the NATO vessels came after U.S. em
bassies in Europe were placed on special alert this weekend in anticipa
tion of terrorist attacks expected on official installations belonging to the
alliance or member nations.
Block addresses farm problems
WASHINGTON — Agriculture Secretary John Block said yesterday
that lie plans to brief President Reagan, perhaps this week, on the
deteriorating economy of the Farm Belt, but he warned that there is "no
new grandiose scheme to save the day."
The secretary, responding to farm-state complaints that the adminis
tration has turned its back on thousands of farmers so strapped they may
not be able to get loans for spring planting, agreed there is a "serious
problem" in the agricultural economy but said rural America should not
look entirely to Washington for solutions.
Block added that the farm financial situation ' has heated up" since he
last briefed Reagan about a month ago. Some banks are in trouble as
well as farmers. But. Block continued, "I don't want farmers to think all
of the answers are here in Washington. ... It is a big problem and every
one has to work on it."
Meanwhile yesterday, an official of the Independent Bankers Associa
tion of America, which represents about 4,100 country banks, said an
expanded federal loan guarantee program would be the quickest and
easiest way to deal with the growing credit crisis in the Farm Belt.
"In the final analysis," Weldon Barton said, "it is a question of
whether the Republican senators who represent those areas, particularly
those who face re-election in 19N6, become committed to taking signifi
cant action to alleviate this situation. That's basically where the initiative
is going to have to come from."
Army plans Honduran exercises
WASHINGTON — The Pentagon announced yesterday that it will
begin another large-scale exercise in Honduras next month, sending
tanks there for the first time and deploying as many as 4,500 U.S. troops
at once in that Central American country.
The exercise. Big Pine 3, is the fourth large maneuver the two nations
have conducted in two years. Pentagon officials said it will last about
three months, unusually long for a military maneuver.
Reagan administration officials have said that the Big Pine exercises
are intended to holster the Honduran military and intimidate the Sandi
nista government of neighboring Nicaragua, which U.S. officials have
accused of having designs on Honduras. The Hondurans agreed to Big
Pine 3 despite earlier reports that some Honduran officers were eager to
diminish the U.S. military presence in their country unless the United
States guaranteed more aid and a security pact. About 1,500 U.S. mili
tary personnel are now stationed in Honduras between exercises.

Rajiv Gandhi in his debut at an international forum, also drafted a

dira Gandhi to encourage arms talks among nuclear powers, brought to

Miguel de la Madrid of Mexico and Julius Nyerere of Tanzania, and

ment between the United States and the Soviet Union to resume
negotiations cm arms control.
Pope urges faith in doctrine
MFRIDA. Venezuela — Speaking against a spectacular Andes moun
tain backdrop to 300.000 people gathered here on a mile-high hillside.
Pope John Paul II issued a stern call for "docility" in accepting the
teachings of the Roman Catholic leadership, some of which are in
dispute bv liberal priests and theologians.
"To be faithful to the church is also to live in intimate communion
with the pastors placed by the Holy Spirit to govern the people of God; it
is to accept with docility its magisterium," the gold-robed pontiff said at
a morning Mass in this city at the northern end of the Andes.
"To be faithful to the church is to not let one's self be taken in by
doctrines or ideologies contrary to Catholic dogma, as certain groups of
materialistic inspiration or doubtful religious content would wish." he
told them.
Ending the third day of his 12-day journey to Venezuela, Ecuador,
Peru and Trinidad-Tobago, the pontitf flew from here to the capital city
of Caracas where, for the second time in his brief stay in Venezuela, he
lamented the wide gap between rich and poor in the oil-endowed
oountry.
Cabinet nominee makes pledge
WASHINGTON — William Bennett. President Reagan's nominee to
replace I. II Bell as secretary of education, yesterday defended the ad
ministration's efforts to reduce the federal role in education but told
senators at his confirmation hearing that "you can count on me to be a
vigorous proponent for the cause of education."
Bennett, whose nomination to head the $17.9 billion department is
expected to be approved easily, told members ot the Senate Labor and
Human Resources Committee that he "will fight for programs that need
more money" but "will be truthful and will resist growth ot programs
just because they're there."
Under questioning from senators who expressed fear that Reagan
would attempt to dismantle the department — as he had promised
during the I 9NO campaign — Bennett declared he had received no indi
cation from administration officials that this would happen.
"I am not going in to abolish the department." he said. "Nor was I
asked to. Nor was I winked at when I was not asked to. I was asked to do
a study." Upon Bennett's nomination to the post. Reagan asked him to
conduct a study on the effectiveness of the department and its role in
education.
The committee, which ended its hearings tin the nomination after one
day. is expected to vote by next week on Bennett. 41. who has been
director of the National Endowment for the Humanities since 1981. If
approved, the nomination then will go before the full Senate.
