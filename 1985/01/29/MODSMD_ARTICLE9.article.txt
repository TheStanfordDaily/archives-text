# Reagan's plan will fall short
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — President
Reagan, rallying support for a budget
proposal that many say faces certain
death in Congress, acknowledged
yesterday that the spending blueprint
he will present formally next week
would fall $40 billion short of his goal
of cutting the deficit to $100 billion
by 1988.
Meeting privately with savings and
loan, home building and realty execu
tives. Reagan received assurances ot
what one termed "a grass-roots
groundswell" behind the budget plan.
He told the executives that the plan
would cut $51 billion from the deficit
that had been forecast for next year.
It would leave a $140 billion deficit in
confirming earlier reports that
the administration would not reach its
target.
"I don't know that it's realistic to
expect any more." John /ellars,
chairman of the U.S. League of
Savings Institutions, said as he
emerged from the session with
Reagan, /ellars and others who at
tended the meeting said that the ad
ministration predicted that interest
rates could fall bv as much as 2.5

percentage points if its proposals
were accepted.
But Bob Packwood (R-Ore.).
chairman of the Senate finance com
mittee. coming out of one of two sub
sequent meetings between Reagan
and congressional Republicans at the
White House, said that GOP senators
were still dissatisfied with the f».4 per
cent increase in military spending that
Reagan has said he will recommend.
Moreover. Packwood said, it could
doom overall efforts toward signifi
cant deficit reduction.
Packwood said the message to
Reagan is: "We have one of two
choices. Either we can have the mili
tary spending cuts you want — and in
that case, we cannot get a spending
cut program — or the military has to
take what is perceived to be a fair
share of cuts."
Senate Republicans, led by
Majority Leader Robert Dole (R
-kan.) are trying to draft their own
budget that would meet the target of
reducing the deficit to $100 billion
within three years, but their efforts
have been bogged down in disagree
ments over the Pentagon budget.
Rep. Trent Lott (R-Miss.),

however, dismissed suggestions that
the president's budget will he "dead
on arrival" when it is presented to
Congress next Monday. Instead, he
described it as "a starting point."
"When all is said and done, we're
going to end up not far from where
the administration's proposals are."
I.ott predicted.
Packwood said there is wide agree
ment that Congress cannot turn its at
tention to tax simplification —
proposals for which have been ad
vanced separately In the Department
of the Treasury, congressional
Republicans and congressional
Democrats — until it has finished
making a cut in the deficit.
"Many of the allies we need to help
us on spending cuts are going to be
enemies on tax reform" because it
eliminates a wide range of popular
deductions. Packwood said. Proceed
ing with both, he explained, mas
"drain off' support for spending cuts.
While Reagan was trying to mar
shal his forces behind his budget,
several leading Democrats lashed out
at his spending priorities. giving an
indication that their party is not going

to remain in the background ot the
budget debate much longer.
Sen. Gary Hart (D-Colo.) warned
that unless the president's defense
spending proposals were cut back, the
nation faced deficits ot $300 billion to
$350 billion in the late 1980s.
Hart told reporters that the financ
ing of such big-ticket defense items as
the M\ missile. B-l bomber and two
aircraft carriers with task forces, to
gether with the purchase of F-IN jet
fighters and major weapons acquisi
tions. would mean "a procurement
bulge" in a few years that w ill have "a
monumental impact."
The administration, he declared, is
building up economic and political
constituencies of labor unions, cham
bers of commerce, defense contrac
tors. community representatives and
conservative organizations to support
its defense spending requests. He said
he had been told that the so-called
"Star Wars" research and develop
ment program, for example, had been
spread among 15 to 20 defense con
tractors.

Packwood said there is wide agree
ment that Congress cannot turn its at
tention to tax simplification —
proposals for which have been ad
vanced separately In the Department
of the Treasury, congressional
Republicans and congressional
Democrats — until it has finished

Sen. Gary Hart (D-Colo.) warned
that unless the president's defense
spending proposals were cut back, the
nation faced deficits ot $300 billion to
$350 billion in the late 1980s.
Hart told reporters that the financ
ing of such big-ticket defense items as
the M\ missile. B-l bomber and two
aircraft carriers with task forces, to
gether with the purchase of F-IN jet
fighters and major weapons acquisi
tions. would mean "a procurement
bulge" in a few years that w ill have "a

building up economic and political
constituencies of labor unions, cham
bers of commerce, defense contrac
tors. community representatives and
conservative organizations to support
its defense spending requests. He said
he had been told that the so-called
"Star Wars" research and develop
ment program, for example, had been
spread among 15 to 20 defense con
tractors.
