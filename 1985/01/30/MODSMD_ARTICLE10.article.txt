# GOP leaders boast of enough support
## Defense budget may be frozen 
### 
WASHINGTON — Senate Re
publican leaders, frustrated and angry
over their inability to negotiate
deeper defense spending cuts with the
White House, said yesterday they
have gathered the support they need
to freeze the Pentagon's budget.
Tension had mounted as Secretary
of Defense Caspar Weinberger met
with the Republicans — part of a
campaign to build support for the 6.4
percent defense spending increase
that President Reagan is expected to
present to Congress next Monday as
part of his overall budget package.
But Weinberger appeared only to
have deepened the rift between the
White House and Reagan's party in
the Senate.
Weinberger showed "no give,"
Mark Hatfield (R-Ore.), chairman of

the Senate Appropriations Commit
tee, complained after the closed
meeting. Hatfield insisted: "There is
far more concern for the deficit here
on [Capitol] Hill than I've heard
enunciated by any representative of
the administration downtown."
He also warned, "The votes are
here for a total military freeze. If we
don't do that, we might as well face
an inevitable tax increase — a very
substantial tax increase — in the very
near future."
The threat was a serious one in
light of Reagan's pledge to raise taxes
only as a "last resort" — a corner
stone of his re-election campaign.
Sen. Alan Simpson (R-Wyo.), the as
sistant majority leader, agreed with
Hatfield that there is "very clear un
animity that the defense budget will

be frozen in a way that produces
bucks.. .. You finally have to quit
talking and start walking."
Freezing the defense budget au
thorization would provide more than
$20 billion toward the Senate
Republicans' goal of cutting $50 bil
lion from the projected fiscal '1986
deficit. But Weinberger reportedly
argued that too tight a curb on
defense spending growth would en
courage the Democratic-controlled
House to go even further, cutting
spending to a level that would
endanger national security.
While the Senate leadership ap
pears to be moving toward a clear
break with the White House,
Weinberger still has some powerful
allies among the Republicans, most
notably Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.),

armed services committee chairman,
and Ted Stevens (R-Alaska),
chairman of the defense appropria
tions subcommittee.
Stevens, told of Hatfield's warning
after the meeting yesterday, said: "If
it meant the difference between
protecting our national security and
raising taxes, I'd raise taxes."
Weinberger also has taken his case
to the public during the last few days,
trying to build pressure on Congress
through two network television ap
pearances and interviews with major
wire services.
Asked whether any more television
appearances were scheduled for
Weinberger, Pentagon spokesman
Michael Burch quipped, "Yes, if you
have any podium."
