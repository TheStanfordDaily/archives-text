## The 						Stanford Daily A 						riddle of malaise 
### 
Riddle: When is a "budget cut" not a "budget
cut"? Answer: when it's made by the Reagan ad
ministration in an effort to circumvent congres
sional desire to fund medical research. The ad
ministration has found a new sleight ot hand that
will allow it to cut congressionally approved
grants to the National Institute of Health (NIH),
Respite a 1974 law requiring presidents to comply
with Congress budget appropriations.
£
: It all goes back to the early 70s when the
■Nixon administration, frustrated by the
■ Democrats' unwillingness to cut spending, simply
•impounded funds which had been appropriated
by Congress. The Democrats responded by pass
ing the congressional Budget and Impoundment
Act, which curtails the president's ability
to delay or cancel the spending of money ap
propriated by Congress.
But the Reagan administration has found an
"end run around the act. Rather than fund 6,500
NIH one-year grants as Congress intended, they
will use some of this money to fund three-year
grants. That way, all of the budgeted money is
"obligated" in the current fiscal year, as required
by the 1974 act, even though some of it will not

he spent for one or two more years. Administra
tion officials estimate that this tactic could save
$280 million out of the total NIH budget of $5.1
billion.
But the real bottom line will be felt in terms of
research cutbacks into cancer and many other
health-related areas. True, medical research must
share in across-the-board cuts if the federal
budget is to be balanced. And the cries of protest
from members of the Stanford faculty over the
NIH cuts may be exaggerated: Philanthropic sup
port of research is at an all-time high and rising.
We suspect that the most energetic and
meritorious research proposals will continue to
be funded even with the proposed NIH cuts.
Still, the statutory loophole being exploited by
the Reagan administration to squeeze NIH
reflects a more widespread malaise in the federal
fiscal nightmare for which Congress must share
the blame: Rather than reduce expenditures on
politically sensitive entitlements programs which
cause most of the bloat in federal spending,
Congress and the president lop off programs like
NIH, which have a relatively tiny political con
stituency but which neverless represent some of
the finest fruits of the federal dollar.
