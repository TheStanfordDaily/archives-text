## Groucho Marx running around the clouds 
### 
The Daily will select a new crop ol
columnists for the next volume, this will be
t&fc last opportunity for readers to wade
tkfough my rather turgid prose or to remark
upon how the artist's sketch above makes me
appear as a Grecian god. While some who
kjrow me say that 1 often think 1 am God.
there is a virtual consensus that 1 am not
Grecian. Having written on many topics near
;md dear to my heart over the past months, 1
svqs somewhat surprised to find that a large
lumber of readers — particularly female stu
dents— enjoyed my commentary on relations
liHween the sexes. Like Sylvester Stallone, I
c<Hild not resist the urge to write a sequel.
* Seemingly in anticipation of certain moonlit
rituals practiced by senior males in the Ouad,
Groucho Marx, in the 1927 film "The
Coconuts," attempted to woo a wealthy
Floridian widow — played as always by the
sjaiely Margaret Dumont — by wistfully
spying. "While the moon is running around
the*'douds, I'll be running around you. I can
see it now — you and the moon." He then
pHiused and, flouting the stylized images of
niodern romance, added, "You wear a
necktie so I'll know you."
T.S. Eliot once wrote: "Human kind cannot
bear very much reality." He was correct in
using a gender-neutral noun as it would ap
pear that many Stanford students of both
sexes cannot bear much reality either. Nearly
all of us — except the most precocious — en
ter college life with many seemingly secure il
lusions which eventually give way to more
durable beliefs. Sometime during the fabled
four years, perhaps while we work alone in

LOTS at 3 a.m. or as we are about to doze off
in one of those incredible mushy chairs at
Green Library, we sit up and ask (amending a
lyric from the 1960s): Where has all the
romance gone?
In a recent history discussion hour, the sec
tion leader asked the students to consider the
feminist implications of the work being
studied. Oddly, a moment of silence des-

cended as several students — both male and
female — adjusted themselves in their chairs
while others' eyes darted about the room (a
telltale sign of psychological unease, as the
job interviewers from Morgan-Stanley would
note). The scene reminded me of a recent car
toon in which a dejected little boy remarks:
"It's not that I don't like girls. It's just that
I'm afraid I'll say something sexist." Why

should the relationship of men and women —
a relationship essential, among other things,
to the continued existence' of life on earth —
promote a response? Why should a sub
ject of concern, if not interest, to all Stanford
students promote hesitation and discomfort?
When people of our parents' generation at
tended Stanford, the living quarters for men
and women were geographically separated.

Just try walking from Encina Hall to Lagunita
today. To the shock of many Stanford men of
the 1980s, undergraduate females — unlike
Sue Ellen Ewing — do not wake up with their
hair perfectly combed and their eyelids per
fectly shaded. Rather, these same women
seek (or so they claim) to be judged by more
progressive criteria: intellect, integrity and
personality. Men and women may meet on

the dance floor of the Viennese Ball once a
year (// they can get tickets), but they com
pete day in and day out in the classroom. Is
this intellectually invigorating? Yes. Socially
desirable? Probably. Romantic in the tradi
tional sense? Certainly not.
Like civilization for Freud, the deroman
ticization of student life has produced its own
"discontents." While they surely would not
admit it, all too many "Stanford women"
yearn for a man with incredible cheekbones
and unusually high earning potential. All too
many "Stanford men" desire a woman with a
gorgeous face and preferably (to borrow a
not-so-subtle Monty Python euphemism)
"huge tracts of land." Situated along Campus
Drive are several venerable institutions that
cater precisely to this scheme of values. Like
denture adhesive and beer, however, they
rarely live up to their promotional claims.
The consequences of these illusions fall
most tragically on the coeducational residence
system designed, in part, to promote a less
stylized view of relations between the sexes. I
have more than once remarked to a row
house kitchen manager that he should con
sider laying down newspaper beneath two
coeds ogling over a fraternity specimen.
Regrettably, the search for illusion often leads
similarly inclined women to ignore the many
appealing male residents around them, per
haps even next door. But. I suppose, it is not
terribly "romantic" to pass someone in the
hallway who has tousled hair, bleary eyes and
foul breath in the morning (as if Mel Gibson
does not).
In this example at least, relations between

men and women are not a one-way street.
This same group of male residents frequently
departs to survey the female populace of
Branner Hall. Upon their return, one
gentleman unable to make the trip would ask:
"Was there anything I should know about?"
Yes, there is something he should know
about: We may wish otherwise, but life simply
is not like "All My Children" or "Brideshead
Revisited."
Not unlike the United States and the Soviet
Union in Geneva, men and women of the
1980s have at last addressed the need to deal
with each other without illusions. Not unlike
the process of arms control, the process of
reconciling new conceptions of femininity and
masculinity will not be automatic; it will not
be without setbacks and emotional discom
fort. What the process surely cannot tolerate
is a cavalier disregard of its existence. The So
viet Union will not simply disappear and nei
ther will the modern women's movement.
Romantic imagery alone, like a nuclear
freeze, cannot substitute for the sober, sincere
and secure terms that lie at the heart of any
lasting relationship. For that matter, what
good is a candlelight dinner without the
sharing of ideas, disappointments, hopes and
dreams?
With only a handful of full moons left on
the academic calendar, countless students of
both genders remain "Stanford neuters."
While so many others are "running around
the clouds" in search of their own images of
perfection, we will be wearing neckties.
