## Positive alternative vision of America 
### 
Inhere is something missing from American
poHtics and American life. Perhaps you have felt
frustrated at the choice between the currently as
cetjfaant Reaganism and timid, confused and defen
sive liberalism. For while the right projects a
corent vision of an America built on the military,
private enterprise, religion and "traditional

values, the left otten appears able to do little more
thiHi say "no."
What is missing is a positive alternative vision ot
America and of the world.
What is missing, we will try to convince you, is
democratic socialism.
It may seem strange to present socialism as a
positive alternative. We tend to associate it with
profoundly undemocratic systems. It conjures up
Images of massive, coercive central governments,
the gulag and terror.
This is not the vision of democratic socialism. We
seek to extend democracy rather than curtail it.
empower people rather than enslave them. I his vi
sion of extended democracy naturally encompasses
a broad range:
1) Politics must be made more democratic.
Decision-making should he decentralized where
possible. Centralized power must be made public
and accountable rather than secret and unac
countable. The right has in fact consistently fought
to expand precisely these noxious characteristics ot
centralized power by declaring more and more
things secret, by expanding the police powers ot the
central government and by limiting people's ability
to seek redress against the government through the
courts.
Economic power is a form of power: it too
should be decentralized where possible and made
public and accountable otherwise. The meaning of
private ("free") enterprise is precisely that decl

sions with enormous public consequences
(eliminating the livelihood of thousands of people;
polluting the water; building unsafe cars) are made
"privately." This is freedom for those making the
decision:,; it is not freedom for the rest of us. This
leads to the second point.
2) The workplace must be made democratic.
Businesses are run on the feudal principle: The
boss commands, you obey. They should be run on
the democratic principle: Those who are affected
by decisions control the decisions. For example,
important decisions in a business could be put to a
vote; bosses could be elected and rotated.
Wouldn't this hurt efficiency? The evidence indi
cates that, if anything, more democratic businesses

matter of laws or ma
terial things; it is a mat
ter of dignity.

are more productive. Furthermore, democracy
would be right even if it were inefficient.
Would people invest their money in such a busi
ness? Would they get a fair reward if they did?
Changing the business itself would make little dif
ference in this respect. A democratic business, just
like any other, would have to make a deal with in
vestors if it needed money. It is not fair that some
people have a lot of money to invest and most have
little, but that's another matter.
3) Society must be made more democratic, assur
ing the equality and dignity of all persons regard
less of race. sex. sexual orientation or income.
Obviously this is a very broad goal. It includes

equality before the law but does not stop there.
Material inequality should be reduced and poverty
eliminated. But equality is more than a matter of
laws or material things; it is a matter of dignity.
People, in their diversity, should all be treated with
respect by each other. Violence, directed at ran
dom strangers or those in the wrong group — or
even against friends and lovers — is a recurrent
reminder of how far we have to go.
4) The economy as a whole must be more demo
cratic. This involves recognizing individual eco
nomic rights (which really stem from the third point
above): the right to a decent living and decent
work, whether that work is paid or not (i.e.,
housework, childcare). But it also involves the abil
ity to reach public decisions about such things as
how many hours a week people should work. The
current "free" economy actually enslaves all to a
rat race. The purpose of the economy should be to
meet human needs — not to "beat" the Japanese.
This list is at once very general and incomplete.
But it shows several things. Democratic socialism is
about most of life, not just economics. It is con
cerned with changes that extend beyond govern
ment policy and laws. Although it encompasses
many specific issues these concerns grow from a
broader vision. Its impulse is to open up a broader
range of issues for effective public discussion. By ef
fective we mean that it should he possible not only
to say "it's crazy that so many would be forced to
work 60-hour weeks while others can't find a job,"
but that there should be a way of doing something
about it.
We will develop these ideas further. We do not
expect to have convinced you of much in this short
space. We hope we have dispelled some preconcep
tions and piqued your curiosity.
