# No easy road to success
## Panel pushes public service 
### FRANK LESTER Staff writer 
If you value "experience," and everything the word
connotes, including long periods of time making no
money, then public service may be worth considering, ac
cording to several speakers at a panel on government
careers yesterday at Tresidder Union.
The five-member panel was part of a yveek-long series
of presentations during the Career Planning and Place
ment Center's annual Career Week.
"Don't be afraid to get involved," said Clinton Killian,
the campaign manager for Wilson Riles, an Oakland
councilman currently running for the mayorship of that
city. "There are so many student organizations that would
appreciate more than anything else just to have your
time."
Killian said he knew nothing about politics when he
came to Stanford from North Carolina in the mid-19705.

He described how he got involved with service organiza
tions on campus, graduated in 1979, went to law school
and tried to get jobs at prestigious law firms whose "old
boy" cliques excluded him from their "frat brother" work
circle.
He eventually worked himself up to his current job by
working in voluntary positions. "Don't be afraid to do
something that's not going to be financially rewarding,"
he advised. "There's more to life than making money."
University President Donald Kennedy, mediator of the
discussion, had some comments of his own about public
service. "There are very few occupational niches in this
society in which young and able people are apt to be given
opportunities as quickly as they are in public service to
make a difference and to engage in activities that really
matter," he said.
Kennedy emphasized that students
should act as their own "opportunity
brokers" in the government job mar
ket, looking for every choice oppor
tunity that comes along with an eye
for finding a job where their skills
would be useful. "Get yourself into a
situation where there's a good match
between your skills and something
that needs to be done."
