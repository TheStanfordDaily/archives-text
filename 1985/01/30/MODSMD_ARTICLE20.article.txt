## Card wins baseball opener 
### TOM SENF Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford baseball team used
overpowering pitching and scrappy,
it not overpowering, offense yester
day for a 5-1 victory over St. Mary's
College in the season opener for
both teams.
Ruben Amaro led Stanford's at
tack by going 3-for-3 with a walk
and a stolen base. His three hits
were half of the Cardinal's total.
First baseman Rick Lundblade,
whom the Cardinal is counting on to
provide power, had an eighth
inning home run.
However, Cardinal coach Mark
Marquess was not happy with his
team's offensive display. "It
I hitting) is always a concern of ours.
We weren't good offensively last
\ear," he said. "Lundblade hit one
out today, but we need a couple of
other guys who can do it too."
Marquess, though, was pleased
with the performance of his pitching
staff. "We pitched well today. I was
\erv happy with everyone who
pitched," he said.
St. Mary's took a 1-0 lead in the
second inning against winning
pitcher Jeff Ballard, but the Car
dinal scored an unearned run off
starter Steve Wood in both the
second and third innings to give its
pitchers all the runs they would
need.
The middle innings were
dominated by Cardinal freshman
Jack McDowell. McDowell, a 6-
foot-5 righthander from Van Nuys,
allowed only two hits in his four
shutout innings, struck out four and
had no walks.
Marquess was impressed with,
though not surprised by, McDowell.
"McDowell was outstanding. He's
got a lot of poise for a freshman.
Once he gets his feet wet, we expect

him to pitch well at this level. Today
he showed he can."
The Cardinal extended its lead in
the seventh inning when Amaro
drove in third baseman Ken Green
with a triple to right-center. After
Lundblade's homer in the eighth.
Toi Cook closed the scoring by
drawing a walk, stealing second and
third and scoring on a passed ball.
Rick Dietz took over for
McDowell in the eighth and became
the third Cardinal to pitch effec
tively, with two hitless innings en
route to a save. Together, the three
Stanford pitchers combined for 10

strikeouts and allowed five hits and
two walks.
After this weekend. Marquess
will have a better idea of how far his
team has progressed during fall
practice. Stanford travels south for a
three-game series with Fullerton
State University, the defending Na
tional Collegiate Athletic Associa
tion champion.
Marquess said the Titans'
strength is their balance. "They
have three or four quick runners.
Their pitchers throw the ball over
the plate. They've got power â€” two
or three guys who can hit it out on
you. That's why they're so tough,"

he said.
Stanford might need balance to
beat Fullerton, which won two of
three from the Cardinal last season.
"We have to continue to pitch well
and play good defense, but we also
have to score runs," Marquess said.
"We have to hit better than we did
today."
Marquess said he welcomes the
chance to play a high-caliber op
ponent early in the season. "They
pressure you, much like we try to
do," he said. "It (the series) will be
a good test for us early in the
season."

Although it looks like senior shortstop John Verducci will get a hit, he was hitless in three at-bats yester
day against St. Mary's. The Cardinal's five runs came on only six hits.
