## Cardinal facing UO Ducks next 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
Respectability was what the Stan
ford men's basketball team needed
Monday night against the University
of Southern California. It got that and
a victory to boot, a 60-54 decision
that knocked the Trojans out of a tie
for the Pacific 10 Conference lead
and brought Stanford out of the con
ference cellar.
But Cardinal Coach Tom Davis
and his staff have less time than usual
to celebrate what might have been
the biggest road victory in Davis'
three years at Stanford. The Univer
sity of Oregon is in town tomorrow
night at 7:30, and nationally-ranked
Oregon State University visits Maples
Pavilion Saturday afternoon.
Although Davis should know what
to expect from Oregon State — noth
ing less than fundamental, by-the
book basketball — Oregon is a differ
ent story. The Ducks, 9-11 overall
and 2-5 in the Pac-10, have been the
team with the highest expectations,
most experience and. so far. the most
inconsistency.
Oregon began the season still high
off last year's 19-16 record and Na
tional Invitational Tournament berth,
its first winning season since 1978
and first post-season tournament ap
pearance since 1977. Two-time All-
Pac-10 center Blair Rasmussen was
back, along with seniors Chris Harper
and Greg Trapp.
But the Ducks, thanks to a very de
manding schedule, weren't able to get
off to a quick start like they did last
year, when they won six of their first
eight. Instead, inconsistency was the
rule. In the Far West Classic, for ex
ample, they lost to the University of

California at Berkeley one night and
upset Fresno State University the
next.
Oregon, which entered Pac-10 play
with a 7-6 record, continued to have
problems in conference games. It lost
four of its first five and suddenly
found itself tied for last place. A split
at home with the Arizona schools last
week helped, hut Oregon — now in a
three-way tie for seventh place with
Stanford and Washington State Uni
versity — is still in the Pac-10's bot
tom half after being picked to finish
fourth in some preseason polls.
"The thing that always concerns
me is the chemistry." second-year
Coach Don Monson said before the
season. But after the Ducks' most
recent losing slide, playing on the
road has been Monson's biggest con
cern. When the Ducks took the
McArthur Court floor last Thursday
night against Arizona State Univer
sity. it was only the Ducks' sixth
home game of the season and their
first in 40 days.
Tomorrow night's game is espe
cially important for both teams be
cause a victory would move the win
ner into at least sixth place in the Pac
-10. And if Arizona State loses to
Washington State tomorrow, the
Stanford-Oregon winner will move
into a fifth-place tie with the Sun
Devils.
"The Oregon game Thursday night
is crucial for us now." Davis said after
the USC victory. "I think we really
have a chance against them."
Large crowds are expected for both
tomorrow's and Saturday's games.
However, general admission tickets
will be available at the door.
