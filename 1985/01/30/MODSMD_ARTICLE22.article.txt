## Stanford beats Hayward, 9-0 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford men's tennis team
played what Coach Dick Gould called
a "solid" first match yesterday, losing
one set in a 9-0 victory over Hayward
State University.
Gould said the match was a good
warmup for the competition the
Cardinal might face >in the National
Team Indoor Championship tomor
row through Sunday in Louisville,
Ky.
Hayward is ranked No. 1 in the
Northern California Athletic Confer
ence and has finished first in its
region the past nine years. The
Pioneers doubles team of Rolf
Wiedenmeyer and Brian Memed
basich, who are ranked No. 1 in Divi
sion 11, won one set from Stanford's
Patrick McEnroe and Derrick Ros
tagno.
McEnroe and Rostagno said their
play was inconsistent. "We were
pretty shaky. We both played well,
but at different times," Rostagno
said. After losing the second set, 6-4,
McEnroe said he and Rostagno
began to serve better. They won the
third game 6-2.
In the No. 2 doubles match, Stan
ford's Dan Goldie and Scott Moody
defeated Mark Pitcher and Chuck
Herfurth. 6-3, 6-4. Cal State
Hayward's serves were a dominating
factor in the match.
"We had a lot of trouble returning.
Those guys had tough serves,"
Moody said, "Coach Gould told us to
try and change the pace by staying
back on the first couple of serves (in
each game), and it worked."
Stanford won its six singles matches

in straight sets.
The Cardinal, ranked second na
tionally, travels to Louisville today as
the No. 2 seed in the NTIC tourna
ment. Participants include the top
teams from each of the nation's eight
regions and eight other nationally
ranked teams.
Stanford's first-round match will be
against Texas A&M University,

which is ranked No. 11. If it wins, the
Cardinal could face UCLA or the
University of Southern California,
both of which Gould expects to be
strong.
"The next couple of weeks, until
Feb. 14, should tell us a lot more
about where we stand," Gould said.
"In that time, we will play five of the
top 10 nationally ranked teams."
