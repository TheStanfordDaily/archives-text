The Fresno State University
wrestling team entered Maples
Pavilion a favorite, but it ran into
an inspired Cardinal team that
gave it plenty of trouble. Although
Fresno won, 22-17, Stanford
scored a moral victory, according
to Coach Chris Horpel.
"I feel like we won although we
lost," Horpel said. "My guys could
not have done much better. I am
really encouraged because if I am
going to lose, this is the type of
loss [I prefer] because everyone
wrestled to his potential."
After trailing 6-2 in the first
period, Stanford's Scott Wiggen
(142 pounds) turned around his
match for a 15-7 victory over Dur
bin Lloren. In the match, Wiggen
demonstrated physical and mental
stamina while Lloren seemed
unable to wrestle seven hard
fought minutes.

At 158 pounds, Stanford's Pete
Rogers and Fresno State's Doug
Carnation had an intense physical
battle. Rogers scored a two-point
takedown with a minute left in the
match and fought off Carnation
for a 3-2 triumph. Stanford had a
15-14 lead when Tom Mullen
(177 pounds) scored five un
answered points in the final period
against Scott Bilyeu and got a 7-2
victory. Cardinal Kurt Kassulke
(190 pounds) tied Todd Young, 4-
4, to maintain Stanford's 17-16
lead.
Horpel said he considered for
feiting the heavyweight match, but
Terry Mclntyre wanted to com
pete against Chris Mast, 100
pounds heavier than he is.
Mclntyre threw Mast to his back
and scored a three-point near fall
for a 5-0 lead. However, Mast got
Mclntyre on his back and pinned
him with 16 seconds left in the first
period.
