The Stanford men's volleyball team
travels to Berkeley tonight to con
clude its preseason schedule with a
best-of-five-set match against the
Golden Bears, beginning at 7:30 p.m.
in Harmon Gym.
Although the Berkeley squad is a
club team. Cardinal Co-Coach Fred
Sturm called it "very spirited and
competitive. They're not as big as we

are, hut maybe quicker."
The Cardinal is looking to maintain
the high level of play it reached last
weekend in Santa Barbara. There,
the Stanford men won the tourna
ment against a field of 20 teams that
included defending national cham
pion UCLA.
"We have to guard against a let
down," Sturm said, "and we've got to
make the effort to execute within the
game plan."
