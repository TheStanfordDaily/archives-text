# Audience hops, swings with Asleep at the Wheel music

### TONY TRAN 
• Western Swing Ain't Dead — It's
Asleep at the Wheel. .
The preceding words make up the
official concert T-shirt and bumper
sticker slogan from the Asleep at the
Wheel show 1 attended last Thursday
night at the Great American Music
Hall in San Francisco. Don't worry if
you have never heard of either the
group or Western Swing — the mar
ginal country-rock subgenre of which
it is the leading proponent. You
are among the vast majority, but it's
OK . .. now you have. From the
name, you can probably deduce that
Western Swing is a cross between
country/western and "swing" jazz. It
also has a decidedly rockish feel, of
ten featuring a mean sax and pound
ing piano. The most distinctive ele
ment of Western Swing is, not
surprisingly, a precise, light-handed,
"jazzy" rhythm section which gives
the music its instantly recognizable
relaxed, freewheeling, "airy" sound.
The 12-year-old group Asleep at
the Wheel has never made the charts
with its records; its following
consists mainly of critics, country
diehards, jazz fanatics and pluralist
music fans. Its reputation is exten
sive enough, however, to guarantee
sold»out crowds at clubs in all the
major cities in the United States.
Such was the case last Thursday .
Anyone entering the Great Ameri
can Music Hall on O'Farrell Street
for the first time will be overwhelmed
by the extraordinarily ornate archi
tecture of the place: There is an
abundance of chandeliers, gold em
bellishments and classical
Gjeek/Baroque motifs. For me, the
effect was doubly unnerving, as it was
so drastically different from the stark,
bare environment of the usual rock
ajidpunk clubs I'm used to.
The audience, too, looked different
oti this particular night. It was
predominantly middle/upper-class,
including a large proportion of
yuppies; cowboy hats and boots were
omnipresent, and there were a few
persons under 25 years of age. (No
mohawks or skinheads.) My friend
and I had no problem fitting in,
however. The friendly and com
fortable atmosphere of the hall made
us.feel welcome, and the two country
types who sat at our table even shared
their bottle of red wine with us.
Funny thing — it turned out that they
graduated from Berkeley. I guess you
ne*er can tell.
The rollicking "Miles and Miles of
Texas" came out of the speakers a
few minutes after Asleep at the
Wheel took over the stage. It is a

large band, including a sax player, an
upright bass player, a drummer, a
violinist (Texas' favorite fiddler for
the last 13 years), a slide guitarist, a
pianist and two vocalist/rhythm
guitarists. Extremely competent
musicians are something the group cer
tainly does not lack, especially with
regard to the two lead singers. Vet
eran bandleader (and joke-cracker)
"Brother Ray" Benson demonstrated
remarkable depth with his confident,
husky, alternatively smooth and
rough vocals. Chris O'Connell — per
sonally, my favorite female country
singer — enthralled all of us with her
magically clear and cutting voice.
Their songs cover much of the
usual country territory, telling tales of
drinkirg, romancing, traveling and
getting in dutch. Many of the songs
during the concert were played ac
cording to two general categories, the
(in Ray Benson's words) "Health and
Happiness Part of the Show" and"The
Sickness and Sadness/Tragedy and
Destruction Part of the Show." The
crowd evidently approved of the
songs selected for performance, as we
whooped it up and clapped our hands
to the beat of such outstanding num
bers as "Let Me Go Home, Whis
key," "The Letter that Johnny
Walker Read." "Take Me Back to
Tulsa," "Choo Choo Boogie," and
"Am I High."

The show also featured several
evocative, taut and totally effective
instrumentals, each memorable for
the spotlighted solos from each
musician. This was not unexpected,
because instrumentals have always
been one of Asleep at the Wheel's
(and Western Swing's) most dis
tinctive trademarks. I was rather dis
appointed that the band did not per
form my favorite songs — its
rockabilly-influenced "My Baby
Thinks She's a Train," and the
sweepingly radiant "Texas, Me and
You." The group redeemed itself,
however, by including the two oldies
"Route 66" and Fats Domino's "I'm
Gonna Be a Big Wheel Someday."
And the crowd danced. And how
they danced! It was a huge hoe-down
party. Everyone was swinging his
partner every which way, having the
time of his life. Although I wasn't
sure whether this kind of dancing was
as fun or fulfilling as slam-dancing
under the stage, I knew for sure that I
had a smile on my face. I realized that
maybe I should try to go see Asleep
at the Wheel more often, or indeed,
any Western Swing concert that may
come my way. Perhaps we all should.
It will definitely be a good break, a
worthwhile change of pace, from
whatever concerns we may be tied up
with at the moment, be it musical or
otherwise. Who knows? We may
even have some fun.
