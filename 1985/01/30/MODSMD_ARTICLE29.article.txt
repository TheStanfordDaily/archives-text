### JOHN WALLIN TELFORD WORK 
KZSU will air the most promising tracks from these albums tomorrow at 6 p.m
The ratine scale is one to five stars.

Julian Lennon — Valotte

Julian Lennon is the owner of the
spookiest voice in the world.
Everyone's first comment upon
hearing his music is, "Is this (gulp)
John Lennon or what?" Well, it
isn't. But the fact is that without his
blood and his name, Julian's only
chance would be with all the other
look- and sing-alikes in
"Beatlemania." But daddy aside,
Julian's music is pleasant, fairly
serious pop which is worth listening
to once or twice, but it's nothing
heavyweight or ultimately signifi
cant. The singles get tiring and the
hype seems a bit unjustified, no
matter how striking the
resemblence between father and
son. It's hard to imagine that there
will be another Julian Lennon al
bum in the future; unless his style
changes, his future work will have
to survive a lifetime of unfair com
parisons.
Kim Wilde — Teases and Dares
★ ★
Flashdance meets Madonna and
Goes to Hollywood. That's all you
need to know. At least Kim Wilde
is better than she was before: Her
conventional voice and conven
tional arrangements of conven
tional new wave have improved
somewhat, and more than one track
is worthy of radio airplay. Past the
first few hits, though, the album
comes across as regular old new
wave with no punches or surprises.
Nothing really distinguishes this
from the rest of latter day progres
sive, with its simple chords, sci-fi
overtones and overreliance on ma
chinery. Kim Wilde is destined to
be lost in the mass of bands that
just came late to the British Inva
sion. Unless she can somehow find
a sound that's somewhat unique,
her songs will only be background

music at dance clubs. Get a style,
Kim.
I oto — Isolation it
All we really want to know is
who's responsible for this stuff.
Never before have such accom
plished musicians released 40
minutes of such completely worth
less material. Fergie Fredrickson's
vocals are whiny, trite and
repetitive; none of the instrumental
parts even begin to challenge the
skills of the players. No Grammies
this year, guys. No contrived-to-be
catchy Rosannas. no pseudo
sensitive Africas. Toto's taken a
more rock-and-roll approach to
its music, and it utterly fails. The
group has obviously decided that
its music's only virtue is its
profitabily; and that's a shame con
sidering the musicians are among
the best in the business, and their
proficiencies have contributed a
good deal to other artists' efforts.
With "Isolation." Toto has simply
given up even trying to be a serious
group.
Daryl Hall and John Gates —
Bigttamßoom ★ ★ 1 :

Hall and Oates are to music what
McDonald's is to the restaurant in
dustry: mass-produced, incredibly
profitable, nutritionally bankrupt,
unadventurous fluff. People have
suggested that we review commer
cial, mass-appeal records once in a
while. OK. Here goes. We know
it doesn't say anything about the
music but, hey, neither does the
music itself. It's AM-car-radio
music, clock-radio music, teen
section-of-large-department-store
music. You hear it, you forget it,
but it doesn't matter because you
hear it again in 15 minutes anyway.
Hall and Oates have found the per
fect recipe for never-great, never
bad music — a pinch of trademark
vocals here, a dash of cute-synthing
there, a tap-a-long beat
everywhere. Stir with MTV, leave

on Billboard charts for two weeks,
let simmer until platinum. Remix to
taste.
Frank Zappa — Thingfish
★ 1 :

For someone like Frank Zappa,
with loyal fans who buy his material
on name alone, to put out such
worthless material is bad enough.
To put out a triple record set and
not put any information on the
outer sleeve is too much. Though
some of the songs contain some
good ideas, none are adequately
thought out or properly executed.
"Thingfish" is a half-conceived ex
ercise in self-indulgence which only
leaves the listener feeling ripped off
and resentful. Zappa is a very
talented individual whose works
are much like those of Monty Pyt
hon: When they come off right,
they're hilarious, but when they
don't, they're painful and boring.
John Fogerty — Centerfield
★★ ★ ★
The chief strength of this album
is that it is one of the few solo ef
forts by 1960s rock veterans that
hasn't sucked. Most '60s stars are
content to rest on their laurels and
only re-enter the rock arena for fin
ancial reasons. Others (like Neil
Young) find themselves out of their
medium when they try to adapt to a
new. often fundamentally different
environment. Fogerty has treated
past and future fans to a pleasant
surprise: an inspired, consistent al
bum that resists both trendiness
and carbon-copy Creedence. On
the whole, though, "Centerfield" is
an exceptional album, proving that
with enough inspiration and effort,
an artist's talent can survive the test
of time.
