# Symposium looks at African hunger

Appealing to humanitarian feelings
is not enough to solve Africa's prob
lems; we need to search for strategic
long-term solutions, said Joseph
Rugumyaheto, president of Stanford
African Students Association
(SASA), in his keynote address at a
CERAS symposium last night.
The symposium centered on struc
tural causes of the food crisis in
Africa and possible strategies for
combating the problems there. It
featured Agricultural Economics
Prof. Alain De Janvry of the Univer
sity of California at Berkeley, Eco
nomics Prof. Tetteh Kofi of the Uni
versity of San Francisco and the Rev.
Cecil Williams of San Francisco's
Glide Memorial Church.
"This symposium tries to go
beyond the publicity, the attention
and the kind of response that has
been given to the problem of
famine," Rugumyaheto said.

De Janvry, who has studied ex
tensively the agrarian question in
Latin America, India and Africa, said
that the drought just triggered the ef
fects of long-range economic mis
management in Africa. In agrarian
countries, he said, agriculture is the
"poor brother in resource alloca
tion."
He said that even when agriculture
was developed it improperly stressed
cash crops, like coffee and cocoa,
rather than food crops. Income from
the cash crops was not used to buy
food, but was spent on military and
luxury goods.
He suggested making agricultural
investment more profitable and
promoting grass-roots initiatives to
counter the rule of the elites looking
out for only their own interests.
On international relations, he said
foreign aid must be more thoughtful
