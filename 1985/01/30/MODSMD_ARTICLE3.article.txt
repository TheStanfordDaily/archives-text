# Symposium looks at African hunger

Appealing to humanitarian feelings
is not enough to solve Africa's prob
lems; we need to search for strategic
long-term solutions, said Joseph
Rugumyaheto, president of Stanford
African Students Association
(SASA), in his keynote address at a
CERAS symposium last night.
The symposium centered on struc
tural causes of the food crisis in
Africa and possible strategies for
combating the problems there. It
featured Agricultural Economics
Prof. Alain De Janvry of the Univer
sity of California at Berkeley, Eco
nomics Prof. Tetteh Kofi of the Uni
versity of San Francisco and the Rev.
Cecil Williams of San Francisco's
Glide Memorial Church.
"This symposium tries to go
beyond the publicity, the attention
and the kind of response that has
been given to the problem of
famine," Rugumyaheto said.

De Janvry, who has studied ex
tensively the agrarian question in
Latin America, India and Africa, said
that the drought just triggered the ef
fects of long-range economic mis
management in Africa. In agrarian
countries, he said, agriculture is the
"poor brother in resource alloca
tion."
He said that even when agriculture
was developed it improperly stressed
cash crops, like coffee and cocoa,
rather than food crops. Income from
the cash crops was not used to buy
food, but was spent on military and
luxury goods.
He suggested making agricultural
investment more profitable and
promoting grass-roots initiatives to
counter the rule of the elites looking
out for only their own interests.
On international relations, he said
foreign aid must be more thoughtful

and must have a long-term orienta
tion. He also said that Africa needs
"political space" to experiment freely
in government.
Kofi contested the conventional
explanation that a smaller food
supply by itself causes famine. He
said that only a mild decline in food
production has caused serious prob
lems in some areas of Africa.
He explained that Africa had trou
ble converting from a pre-capitalist to
a capitalist production economy, and
that it is still suffering from capitalist
expansionism. He said long-range so
lutions will be effected when African
goods have an equal exchange value
on the international market and the
whole African economy is
strengthened.
Williams addressed more human
aspects of combating the crisis.

Before any lasting changes occur,
there must be a change in the world's
perception of Africans, Williams said.
He said that because of Western
countries' low opinion of Africans,
we are making decisions they should
be making themselves. Exploitative
"multi-corporations" are forces
against change, too. "Africa will
change when multi-corporations want
it to change," he said.
