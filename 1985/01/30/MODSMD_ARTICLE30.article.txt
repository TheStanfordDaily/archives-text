# Underplayed albums deserve respect
## 
### ANDREW CROWELL 
Before the cover of the 1 984 yearbook is
closed, it is mandatory that a few extremely
underplayed albums get the respect that is
due them. Yes, 1 9K4 was a big year in the
music industry. It was Prince's year. It was
Huey's year. It was Madonna's year. It was
Bruce's year. It was Michael's year (again). It
was even Twisted Sister's year. But that's not
all. As usual, there were a number of albums
that received little or no airplay and as a result
didn't get the exposure they deserved.
For good reason, you might contend.
Could be. Following are five albums that
were overlooked in 1984. Different? Yes,
they are. Commercial? No, not really. Enjoy
able? Yes, extremely. This is music with in
tegrity that uplifts and inspires.
"Three of a Perfect Pair"— King Crimson
The last in a series of three studio albums.

"Perfect Pair" re-establishes King Crimson as
a leader among contemporary, thinking
bands. Side one (Left Side) contains mostly
upbeat, danceable tunes whereas side two
(Right Side) showcases the more technical,
complex style of the group. Clearly more dif
ficult, though extremely rewarding listening,
the Right Side consists of industrial, grating,
knife-edge sounds best portrayed on
"Industry" and "Dig Me." Clearly the high
point of the album (it's hard to select only
one) is "Larks Tongues in Aspic III" which
without any doubt is one of Crimson's best to
date.
The Unforgettable Fire— U2
Many people wondered how U2 could fol
low up a spirited, banner-waving protest al
bum like "War." Well, friends, this quartet
has. While "War" was largely about putting

one's faith and feelings on the line. "Fire"
presents some of the consequences (conflicts
and changes) which result when one does.
This is Christian rock for a distracted and mis
guided society. The textured, ethereal
synthesizer sounds (largely a result of the
Eno/Lanois production) reflect the album's
spiritual nature, though "Indian Summer
Sky" and "Wire" remain aggressive rockers
in the U2, tradition. "Pride (In the Name of
Love)" and "MLK" pay tribute to Martin
Luther King Jr. — a man who effectively
demonstrated faith in love.
Bewitched — Robert F ripp and Andy Sum
mers
It's hard to imagine a sequel that could
come close to their debut album, "I Advance
Masked," yet these two have done it. Like
"Masked." all the tracks are instrumentals.

but unlike the former, side one of
"Bewitched" incorporates the guitar mastery
of these two into upbeat dance tunes. I he sar
castically humorous "What Kind of Man
Reads Playboy?" contrasts perfectly with the
aural serenity created in cuts like "Train" and
"Manquillage" to establish a well-balanced
yet cohesive work.
Declaration — The Alarm
In the U2 tradition, the Alarm presents ac
cessible "Christian" rock to a pagan 20th
century society. This concept album
encourages people to band together and fight
unrighteousness and inequality (social and
economic). Admittedly, it is a little hard to
discover whether these Englishmen are advo
cating Christianity or not. since most of the
lyrics are in an ambiguous, symbolic form.
"The Stand (Prophecy)" might convince you

that they are. while "We Are the Ligjfrt"-'.
might cause you to doubt. In any case, inspir
ing songs like "Marching On' and "Where
Were You Hiding When the Storm Broke'
encourage all listeners to light against
mediocrity, ultimately giving the record a cer
tain missionary zeal.

Reckoning — R.E.M.
Fantastic. This Georgia-based group pli|ys
pop-rock-country-folk-jazz music that Is
uplifting and thought-provoking. Similar to
their "Chronic Town" HP. most of the lyriOs
on • Reckoning" are decipherable, which
presents a distinct change from their
"Murmur" debut. From the dreamy fairy title
of "7 chineSe bros." to the toe-tapping
"(don't Go back TO) ROCKVILLE," this al
bum uplifts and invigorates. Don't miss this
one!

bum like "War." Well, friends, this quartet
has. While "War" was largely about putting

one's faith and feelings on the line. "Fire"
presents some of the consequences (conflicts
and changes) which result when one does.
This is Christian rock for a distracted and mis
guided society. The textured, ethereal
synthesizer sounds (largely a result of the
Eno/Lanois production) reflect the album's
spiritual nature, though "Indian Summer
Sky" and "Wire" remain aggressive rockers
in the U2, tradition. "Pride (In the Name of
Love)" and "MLK" pay tribute to Martin
Luther King Jr. — a man who effectively
demonstrated faith in love.
Bewitched — Robert F ripp and Andy Sum
mers
It's hard to imagine a sequel that could
come close to their debut album, "I Advance
Masked," yet these two have done it. Like
"Masked." all the tracks are instrumentals.

but unlike the former, side one of
"Bewitched" incorporates the guitar mastery
of these two into upbeat dance tunes. I he sar
castically humorous "What Kind of Man
Reads Playboy?" contrasts perfectly with the
aural serenity created in cuts like "Train" and
"Manquillage" to establish a well-balanced
yet cohesive work.
Declaration — The Alarm
In the U2 tradition, the Alarm presents ac
cessible "Christian" rock to a pagan 20th
century society. This concept album
encourages people to band together and fight
unrighteousness and inequality (social and
economic). Admittedly, it is a little hard to
discover whether these Englishmen are advo
cating Christianity or not. since most of the
lyrics are in an ambiguous, symbolic form.
"The Stand (Prophecy)" might convince you

that they are. while "We Are the Ligjfrt"-'.
might cause you to doubt. In any case, inspir
ing songs like "Marching On' and "Where
Were You Hiding When the Storm Broke'
encourage all listeners to light against
mediocrity, ultimately giving the record a cer
tain missionary zeal.

Reckoning — R.E.M.
Fantastic. This Georgia-based group pli|ys
pop-rock-country-folk-jazz music that Is
uplifting and thought-provoking. Similar to
their "Chronic Town" HP. most of the lyriOs
on • Reckoning" are decipherable, which
presents a distinct change from their
"Murmur" debut. From the dreamy fairy title
of "7 chineSe bros." to the toe-tapping
"(don't Go back TO) ROCKVILLE," this al
bum uplifts and invigorates. Don't miss this
one!
