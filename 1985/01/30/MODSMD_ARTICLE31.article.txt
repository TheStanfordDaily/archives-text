# 'War Horses' spoon-feeds message

### KARY ANTHOLIS 
Beware of a play that uses its playbill either to explain a
dramatic problem or to emphasize social relevance. In the
first case the playbill writer is probably trying to com
pensate for the production's awkward moments. In the
second instance, the audience usually is being given a
message which will be delivered without subtlety by the
play. "War Horses," a new play by Adele Ed'ing Shank at
the Magic Theater, suffers from both of these problems.
"War Horses" is set in 19th-century New York and
London. The play focuses on the careers of English actor
William Macready and American actor Edwin Forrest.
These men meet after one of Forrest's performances of
"King Lear," and though they are cordial, they immedi
ately express their opposing views of acting. Macready is
intellectual and scholarly in his approach. By contrast,
Forrest is the prototype of the Method actor. Their differ
ence of opinion escalates into a bitter public rivalry. The
emotion that this rivalry stirs in the public becomes a
tool in the class struggle between the anti-English im
migrants and the industrial magnates of New York City.
In the playbill. Shank explains: "Both men were con
summate actors, although their styles would seem
melodramatic now." This seems to be a plea to take the
play on its own terms. Fair enough. The performances of
various Shakespearean monologues by Macready (Will
Huddleston) and Forrest (David Parr) make the point
that these men acted awkwardly by modern standards.
Forrest's passion seems a bit contrived, while Macready's
approach is somewhat lifeless. This would be an asset to
the play if we were to get a clear psychological picture of
these men when they are off stage. Unfortunately, direc

tor Theodore Shank seems to have instructed his cast to
carry the melodrama into the characters' lives.
Parr plays Forrest as a hrash, inarticulate brute. There
seems to be a sensitive side to this character which allows
him to enter his dramatic roles. Yet neither the script nor
Parr develops this idea successfully.
Similarly, Huddleston's rigorous scholarly approach to
his acting is transferred to his family life. He plans even
his sex life thoroughly. The result is a cute and unsatisfy
ing portrait of Macready.
A second problem with Shank's script is that it
sometimes sounds more like a moralistic history lecture
than a play. In the playbill she writes: "Insignificant trivial
incidents were made to symbolize larger issues bv am
bitious manipulators. The play uses a historical subject,
but the implications are, I believe, contemporary." Shank
uses a Bowery Boy (Beth Sweeny) to explain these impli
cations. The boy narrates the events of a riot which takes
place outside the theater in which Macready is perform
ing. In the boy's speech the audience is spoon-fed the
message that "violence is senseless."
"War Horses" has a few entertaining moments. For in
stance, there is a delightful scene in which Macready is
playing Macbeth as the riots begin outside the theater.
The stage manager comes on stage and tells Macready
that he should stop his performance and take cover, to
which Macready responds, "Stop Macbeth? You'll have
to kill me first." The stage manager exits and returns with
a sword, and he and Macready act out a hilarious parody
of the duel between Macbeth and Macduff. Unfortun
ately, moments like this are few and far between in this
production.
