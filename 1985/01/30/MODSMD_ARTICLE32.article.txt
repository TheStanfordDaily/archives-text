Academic med center study planned
A major study of the future of the academic medical
center will be conducted in the next three years under the
direction of Dr. Lawrence Crowley, professor of surger\
and vice president for medical affairs at Stanford Medical
Center.
The study, made possible by a $650,000 grant from the
Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation to the University,
"will examine how academic medical centers can adapt to
a competitive medical practice environment," according
to Dr. Alvin Tarlov, president of the Menlo Park-based
foundation.
"Stanford Medical Center," he said, "is now function
ing in a competitive environment that may become the
norm throughout the country in a few years.
"The choices Stanford makes will be influential in
shaping the future organization of academic medicine in
the U.S."
Planned as a cooperative effort of the University, the
medical school and the University hospital, the research
will be guided by an internal steering committee, aug
mented by an advisory board representing business
leaders, the medical community, the public sector and
other academic health centers.
Smaller task groups will be convened to study and make
recommendations on specific trends that affect the mis
sions of the medical center in patient care, research and
education.
Latin America Studies receives award
Recent awards from the Tinker Foundation and the
Andrew W. Mellon Foundation will strengthen the schol
arly programs of the Center for Latin American Studies,
according to Anthropology Prof. George Collier, director
of the center.

An award of $15,000 from the Tinker Foundation will
the center's support for student field research in

Latin America. Approximately 20 to 25 awards will be
made in 1985 to enable students at various stages of
graduate study to learn about Latin America through
first-hand experience and research.
Winners will have an opportunity to develop intimate
knowledge of the language, terrain and culture ot Latin
America and to develop contacts with scholars and insti
tutions in their fields.
The Mellon Foundation has pledged up to $350,000 to
the center from 1985 to 1989 in a challenge grant coupled
to a University commitment to raise a three-fold matching
endowment for Latin Americanist scholarship.
The Mellon Foundation award continues and con
solidates a variety of Latin American Center programs
begun with Mellon Foundation assistance five years ago.
These programs include faculty and student research in
Latin America, the strengthening ot teaching and curricu
lum and scholarly conferences and workshops concerning
the region.
