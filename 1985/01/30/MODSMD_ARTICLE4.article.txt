# Med center develops a gonorrhea vaccine

### LYNN MARCUS Staff writer 
Stanford researchers have discovered a potential
vaccine for gonorrhea, a contagious venereal disease that
affects an estimated two to three million new victims in
the United States every year.
The potential vaccine, produced after 10 years of study
at the Stanford* Medical School, has successfully
prevented gonococcal bacteria from infecting human cells
in laboratory experiments. The next stage in the research
will be studies on human volunteers.
"We hope the vaccine will be appropriate for people at
high risk of contracting the gonorrhea," said Asst. Prof, of
â– Medicine and Medical Microbiology Gary Schoolnik, who
led the research.
Schoolnik cited as prime candidates for vaccination in
habitants of "certain areas of the Third World where the
disease is epidemic, the American military and adolescent
girls beginning sexual activity, which in the United States
is [at] age 14 or so."
The potential vaccine consists of a bioengineered
protein fragment that appears to protect against gonococ
cal infection by stimulating the immune system to seek out
and inactivate specialized hair-like appendages called pili
that latch onto cells lining the urogenital tract at the onset
of infection.
Gonorrhea is the most common communicable disease
for which records are kept in the United States, and it has
reached epidemic proportions in Southeast Asia and
western Africa. The disease is easily spread through
sexual contact and can produce severe complications, in
cluding infertility in women.
Schoolnik said the exact number of cases in the United
States is unavailable because many people are unaware
that they have contracted the disease until their condition
is severe; others delay seeking medical help because of so
cial stigma, lack of education or lack of access to medical
care.

He estimated the number of new cases contracted an
nually at two to three million and said the number of men
and women with the disease is approximately equal.
Because many people with gonorrhea are initially
asymptomatic, the disease passes rapidly between sexual
partners. In many cases. Schoolnik said, the delayed
symptoms allow the disease to progress and cause serious
complications. One of the most severe complications in
women is pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which can
cause chronic pain, complications in pregnancy and infer
tility.
Schoolnik said that in parts of Africa affected by an
epidemic of gonorrhea, one-fourth of the women are in
fertile by age 25.
Gonorrhea can be treated with antibiotics, but many
strains of the bacterium causing the disease have become
resistant to most drugs. The new vaccine candidate is
unique because it appears to be effective in blocking in
fection from a broad range of gonococcal strains.
Schoolnik and four other researchers made the poten
tial vaccine by synthesizing pieces of pilin protein until
they found parts that didn't vary from strain to strain. The
protein fragments were then injected into rabbits whose
immune systems reacted by producing the antibodies used
to make the vaccine.
Because animals are not subject to gonorrhea, the re
searchers said their next step is to test the vaccine on
human subjects in a two-part process. First, healthy vol
unteers will take the vaccine to establish its safety. If
found safe, the vaccine will then be given to volunteers
who will subsequently be exposed to gonococcal bacteria.
Schoolnik said he foresees "problems of acceptibility"
which could hinder administration of the vaccine even if it
is proven effective. "One of the paradoxes of the situation
is that the people who need it (vaccination) the most are
those for whom it is strategically difficult to give it to," he
said, referring to inhabitants of Third World countries and
also teenagers whose parents are reluctant to have them
vaccinated against sexually transmitted disease.
