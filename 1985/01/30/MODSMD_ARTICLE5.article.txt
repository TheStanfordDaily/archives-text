# ASSU told to axe GPB
## 
### JOYA WESLEY Staff writer 
I he ASSU Senate received a re
■ commendation last night to terminate
W ? Guest Professorship Bureau from
the Special Legislative Committee on
Association Bureaus (SLC-AB)
during its meeting at the Law School.
In other key issues, the senate
voted down a bill to redistribute the
remaining salary of resigned Presi
dent Alice Wells among the remain
ing three Council of Presidents
members, and it passed a bill setting
targets for general fund allocations
and association fee increases.
The SLC-AB recommended ter
minating the Guest Professorship
Bureau (GPB) no later than the end
of spring quarter, 1985, and expand
ing the Speakers Bureau in format
and content. In addition, the commit
tee recommended that the senate in
crease supervision over the Speakers
Bureau, and that remaining GPB
funds be transferred to the bureau
until it increases its special fee.
These recommendations were
prompted by the general view that

the GPB is not active enough and not
cost effective because of low student
enrollment in guest-taught courses.
These problems, according to Senator
Mark Soble, are not adequate reasons
tor eliminating the GPB. He feels
they can be repaired if the GPB does
a better job of selecting guest profes
sors and courses that better reflect
student interest.
"I feel it would be a serious
mistake to eliminate the GPB," Soble
said.
COP member David Porter
disagreed, highlighting the adminis
trative liabilities of the GPB. Accord
ing to him, the GPB is a good idea
that the ASSU doesn't have the capa
bilities to handle. Therefore, he advo
cates that it be eliminated rather
than "dragged along."
COP member Todd Kerr and
Senator Sheila Castilla echoed
Porters opinion. The senate did not
take action but plans to do so in a
future meeting.
The rationale offered for splitting
Wells' salary among the remaining
three COP members was that the

remaining three presidents should be
further compensated because they
have assumed Wells' responsibilities.
Soble said he opposed the proposal
because of the COP's failure to fill
the vacancy with the election of a new
president.
"The Council of Presidents has put
themselves in a position for giving
themselves a raise," he argued. He
suggested that the decision not to fill
the vacancy was consciously in
fluenced by the desire for additional
salary.
Porter assured the senate that the
salary issue arose long after the deci
sion not to elect a fourth president.
Graduate Senator Suzanne Uhland
opposed the bill for different reasons
than Soble did. She argued that the
COP salaries were designed not to
compensate for time worked, but to
avoid the exclusion of students who
would be financially disadvantaged
by a commitment to the COP. Uh
land also pointed out that presidents
already devote all of their available
time to the ASSU, so they could not
possibly devote any more, despite the
extra administrative duties they must
now perform.
"I just don't think that we're going
to be getting 4,000 extra dollars
worth of the COP for the rest of the
year," Uhland said.
The final issue of major importance
was a bill to set a target, limited to the
projected rate of inflation, for the in
crease of the association fee between
the 1984-85 and 1985-86 school
years.
' This implies that new programs
get funded only by funding old pro
grams less," said Senate Chair Eric
Berg. He was not completely accurate
since the bill does not preclude re
quests for additional funding, accord
ing to Senator Carey White.
