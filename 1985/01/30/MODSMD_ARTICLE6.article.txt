# journalist says media overlook Afghan trouble
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
Afghanistan is "one of the most
overlooked subjects in the news
media today," a photo-journalist
from National Geographic magazine
told a crowd of approximately 40 at
the Bechtel International Center last
night.
Steve Raymer. a Knight Fellow in
the Department of Communication,
recently completed an assignment in
Afghanistan, nearly five years after
Soviet troops invaded the strategi
cally situated Asian nation.
While a " 'we've seen it all before"
approach seems to summarize the
media's approach to Afghanistan,"
Raymer said events in that country
justify continuing media coverage.

Despite "vicious and costly
(military) campaigns" by the Soviet
Union to gain complete control of
Afghanistan, Raymer said "rag-tag
armies of Mujahedeen rebels" con
tinue to battle Soviet and Afghani
army forces.
He said a "nightly show" of mili
tary confrontations take place in the
country's capital. Kabul, beginning
around 10 p.m. with the shelling of
Soviet controlled power plants by the
Mujahedeen.
Soviet forces are quick to respond
with a search-light sweep of the
mountains surrounding the city,
looking for rebel outposts, Raymer
said. Soviet forces retaliate and skir
mishes last until " 1 or 2 in the morn
in 8-'
During the day, Soviet MI-8 and
MI-24 helicopters fly over Kabul and
the surrounding hills and countryside,
Raymer said. The city's airport
amounts to "an enormous Soviet air
base," with "no Afghan citizens in
sight."
Although it's "verv dangerous to

generalize about Afghanistan from a
five-day trip," Raymer said the
"Soviets appear to be in Afghanistan
for a very long time."
Raymer said the Soviets "clearly
have superior firepower" and con
tinue to send a steady stream of "raw
recruits" into the country, seemingly
to gain first-hand training.
"We'd be deceiving ourselves to
say resistance could go on in
definitely," Raymer said, calling the
amount of aid to rebels "a pittance"
compared to Soviet spending.
