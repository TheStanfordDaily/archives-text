Congressmen seek tax compromise
WASHING! ON — The Republican and Democratic sponsors of two
major tax simplification bills have agreed to a bipartisan approach that
they hope will lead to an early compromise on overhauling the federal
income tax system, the chief sponsor of the GOP measure said yester
day.
Rep. Jack Kemp (R-N.Y.), speaking at a breakfast session with
reporters, said he and Sen. Bob Kasten (R-Wis.) will hold a news confer
ence today with Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.) and Rep. Richard Gephardt
(D-Mo.) to announce that they will revive their respective bills — both
variations on the idea of a "flat tax."
Kemp said that in seeking a compromise the sponsors of the measures
not only will consider consolidating their bills but also will incorporate
parts of the Department of the Treasury's tax simplification proposal
now being considered by the White House. All three tax reform
proposals would enable the government to continue collecting the same
amount of revenues but would lower the tax rates for both individuals
and corporations by eliminating some popular deductions.
The sponsors of the two congressional bills already are "very, very
close" to resolving their differences and all that remains is "some dotting
of Is and crossing of Ts," Kemp said. He added that he has stayed in
touch with Bradley on the matter on a weekly basis.
However, spokesmen for both Bradley and Gephardt said that while
the Democrats were interested in reaching a compromise, neither has
been involved in actual negotiations with Kemp toward that end.
"There have been no negotiations at all, but if Kemp is saying we are
that close to agreement it's good news, because any movement has been
unilateral on his part," Gephardt's spokesman said.
Governor names lottery heads
SACRAMENTO — Gov. George Deukmejian appointed the Comp
ton city manager, a former district attorney, a retired school superin
tendent, a restaurateur and an accountant as commissioners of the
state's new billion-dollar lottery yesterday.
The commissioners are:
• William Johnston, 58, of Los Angeles, a Republican who was superin
tendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District — one of the nation's
largest school systems — from 1971 to 1981. Johnston served as a
Southern California Gas Co. spokesman from 1981 to 1984.
• Laverta Montgomery, 48, a Republican who has been Compton's city
manager since 1982. She went to work for the city in 1971 and became
its controller in 1977.
• John Price, 65, of Mendocino, a Democrat who served as Sacramento
County district attorney from 1959 to 1979. Price fulfills the voter
approved lottery initiative's requirement that at least one commissioner
have more than five years of law enforcement experience.
• Howard Varner, 59, of Pacific Palisades, a Republican who is chair
man and former president of Host International Inc. of Santa Monica.
Varner went to work in 1949 for the restaurant chain, which now earns
$500 million annually from food and gift outlets in airports.
• Kennard "Ken" Webster, 64, of the Palm Springs suburb of Bermuda
Dunes, a Democrat who is a former partner in the accounting firm of
Deloitte Haskins & Sells. Webster fulfills the requirement that one com
missioner be a certified public accountant.
The action came nearly eight weeks past the constitutional deadline
for appointments in the lottery initiative that voters approved Nov. 6,
probably giving new commissioners too little time to begin the games by
the initiative's March 22 deadline.
FDA approves herpes treatment
WASHINGTON — The Food and Drug Administration announced
yesterday that it has approved the first pill to treat and prevent out
breaks of genital herpes, an incurable, sexually transmitted disease that
may afflict as many as 20 million Americans.
-- The drug is not a cure for herpes but can provide effective, long-term
relief from symptoms and significantly reduce the chances of spreading
the virus, the agency said. It will be available by prescription starting
Feb. 11 under the trade name Zovirax and is an oral form of acyclovir,
already marketed as an ointment and used intravenously in hospitals.
The pills can "dramatically benefit" both those who experience only
occasional outbreaks and want to lessen the symptoms, as well as those
who suffer frequent attacks and want to prevent them entirely, according
to Dr. Ronald Keeney, a medical adviser at Burroughs Wellcome Co. of
Research Triangle Park, N.C., manufacturer of the pills. The drug has
been approved for use during periods of up to six months.
The FDA said genital herpes "has become almost epidemic," with
300,000 new cases reported each year — second only to gonorrhea,
which strikes 1 million Americans annually. Gonorrhea, which is caused
by bacteria, can be treated and cured with antibiotics.
Another Galaxy plane has trouble
WASHINGTON — A Galaxy Airlines plane identical to the one that
crashed last week in Reno experienced trouble with its landing gear yes
terday and was forced to make an emergency landing in Georgia, federal
aviation officials said.
The National Transportation Safety Board said the right wheel would
not lower on the four-engine Lockheed Electra cargo plane, carrying
auto parts and chemicals but no passengers, but the plane landed safely
on a foam-covered runway at Dobbins Air Force Base. Because of its
potentially hazardous cargo, the turboprop plane was diverted from
Hartsfield International Airport at Atlanta to the nearby air base, board
spokesman Robert Buckhorn said.
Buckhorn said the three-member crew escaped without injury. The
flight had originated in Philadelphia.
The incident prompted the board to order an immediate inspection of
the cargo plane's maintenance records at Galaxy headquarters in Ft.
Lauderdale, Fla., where board inspectors already were examining logs in
connection with the Reno crash.
At Reno, where 68 persons were killed, the pilot had radioed for
permission to return to Cannon International Airport because of
"vibrations" shortly after takeoff. The plane plunged into a recreational
vehicle lot along U.S. Route 395. The cause of the crash is still under in
vestigation.
Tourist intruded on inauguration
WASHINGTON — Despite extraordinarily tight security, a tourist
from Denver carrying an overnight bag walked into the White House
with the Marine Corps orchestra on President Reagan's inauguration
day and wandered freely until he reached the First Family dining room.
There, a member of the White House usher's staff noticed something
strange about the man — he was not wearing a uniform, let alone carry
ing a musical instrument — and called a Secret Service agent.
The tourist, Robert Latta, 45, a water-meter reader, was arrested on a
charge of unlawful entry and held five days for psychiatric observation
until he was released Friday on $1,000 bail. "I really think that the
penalty was a little unjustified." he told the Associated Press yesterday.
"I just wanted to see the ceremony. ... I'm kind of patriotic."
The president returned about the same time Latta was being inter
rogated at an outside guard post and. upon re-entering the White House,
walked within a few feet of where the Marines had laid down their in
strument cases and Latta had placed his unchecked overnight bag. The
bag, after being tracked down by a dog team, was found to contain only
some clothing and a book.
Market continues advance
NEW YORK — The stock market withstood an afternoon wave of
to post a small gain yesterday extending the broad advance of the
past three weeks.
Stocks responding to individual earnings reports showed some of the
widest swings in a session of brisk activity.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials edged up 1.77 to 1,277.83, a
little less than 10 points below its record closing high of 1,287.20 set on
Nov. 29, 1983.
