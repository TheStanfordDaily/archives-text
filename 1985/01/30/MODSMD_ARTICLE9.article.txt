WASHINGTON — Attorney General-designate
Edwin Meese 111. declaring that he has developed
"a much higher level of sensitivity" to ethical ques
tions than when he came to Washington in 1981.
promised yesterday to "go overboard to avoid any
appearance" that could be misinterpreted as im
proper.
At the same time. Meese. who was testifying as
the Senate Judiciary Committee opened a second
round of confirmation hearings on his nomination,
said that he interpreted a report by an independent
counsel that found no basis for criminal charges
against him as clearing him on ethical grounds as
well.
"I have conducted myself in accordance with the
ethical as well as the legal standards of behavior for
public officials," Meese asserted.
But Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D-Ohio), the
only committee member to state in advance that he
will vote against confirmation, said that the facts
uncovered by independent counsel Jacob Stein
show that Meese "lacks the integrity ot character,
the evenhandedness of purpose and the sensitivity
to ethical values required of the attorney general."
Saying he did not dispute Stein's conclusion that
Meese had not committed an indictable offense,
Metzenbaum asked: "But since when is not being

indicted a qualification tor ( , .

Meese is scheduled to return tor more question

the Office of Government Ethics, who reversed a
finding by two of his staff attorneys that Meese had
violated federal ethics standards in two matters.
The attorneys. F. Gary Davis and Nancy Feathers,
who Martin claims are satisfied with the reversa
also are expected to testify today.
Meese defended as "normal" steps taken tn
Leonard Garment and other of his lawyers to per
suade Martin to reverse the conclusion reached by
the ethics office attorneys. Martin made no men
tion of the staff report when he certified to the
committee last Thursday that Meese had complied
with conflict-of-interest laws and regulations.
Martin made public the staff attorneys 17-page

lawyers contended that the report had ignored the
independent counsel's finding that there was no
evidence that Meese had known that Barrack h id
located one buyer for his house and had financed
the buyer's participation.
But the ethics office lawyers concluded that
Meese had "an appearance problem" in the Bar

sisted him in the sale of the house in other ways!
