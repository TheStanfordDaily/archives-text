Indeed, that's a fraternity.
Right?
Wrong. The fraternity ol Alpha
Sigma, 5K5 Uowell I ane. has 50
residents 24 of whom are
women is tilled randomly by
the Draw each year and plays a
rather infrequent role in the a 1 1-
:ampus party scene.
Innovation, however, is hardly
i new concept to Alpha Sigma.
At one ol the lew campus-wide
\lpha Sig events last year, the
wotie Frolic Mall, pa i tier s
iirived "wearing everything Irom
i-strings to flasher outfits to
iprons to fish-net stockings." said
ormer Alpha Sig resident Dave
Jaszucki. I he more than 300
evelcrs boozed and boogied
lirough the night, with an
leva ted "go-go" cage as the
a nee floor. Maszucki said.
Maszucki called the 1 \otic
i otic " the wildest part , I've
ecu on campus. I very tiling is out
if control."
I lie forward-looking Alpha
igma fraternity here was also
tnong the first ol all the local

chapters ot the national Alpha
Sigma Phi organization to admit a
Jew and to admit a black. "The
(Stanford) chapter led the na
tional chapter to change its
bylaws," said I 9N4 Alpha Sig
President Ann Fisher.
111 1 973, Alpha Sig (at that
time, official!) a lan chapter
o! Alpha Sigma Phi) began to
admit women. "It wasn't a matter
ol choice." said 112 isher. "I he
house couldn't till itself."' It was a
matter of going coed or losing
the house, she said.
Upon accepting women. Alpha
Sig lost its official standing as a
fraternity with the University.
And. according to University reg
ulations. this loss of official stand
ing placed Alpha Sig into the
Draw. No longer able to select its
members In the traditional rush.
Alpha Sig had to contend with
tr\ing to build cohesion among
residents placed there largely at
random.
I or eight years, the national
council turned a blind eye to the
Stanford \lpha Sigma situation,
regarding the women residents as
"boarders." l isher said.
111 1 1 ><N I . however. Day na
(ioklline. then president of Alpha
Sig. attended the fraternity's na
tional convention, where she in
troduced a resolution that would
have given each local chapter the
option ol going coed.
It met a resounding defeat."
(ioklline s;iill • When I intro

Stanford chapter. 1 remember

said.'Sureh I must not be well.
I he national was "forced to
recognize the women here." I ish
er said. In response, the Stan
lord chapter was placed on six
month probation for failure to
comply with the minimum stand
ards of the national council,
standards which demand all-male
membership, lisher said.

After two sears on probation,
the residents ot Alpha Sig voted
unanimously to renounce their
national charter and reincor
porate as a local fraternity, lisher
said.
"We were tired of taking it
faking that we're OK. that we're
following the rules." said Leon
Hilton, fraternity president in
1953. the year of the break.
According to Milton, the na
tional council insisted that the
Stanford chapter perform a
selective male rush. The council
also granted residency to women
but refused them full voting
rights.
"After nine years of women
being an equal part of everything
we do. we couldn't go back on
that, nor would we want to." Hil
ton said.
In retrospect. Fisher consid
ered it a "more positive move to
break with the national than to
wait until the national kicked us
out."
Alumni reaction was immedi
ate and divided. Some letters

were "openly hostile, while
others were "very, very touch
ing." Fisher said.
One letter was addressed to
"Mr. Mrs. Mv I.eon Hilton." An
other Alpha Sin alumnus, in contrast,
praised the members for their ac
tion and lamented that he had
lacked the courage to lead a
break with the national when the
council insisted the Stanford
chapter not admit Jews.
Despite the divided alumni re
action. residents of the house
have remained 100 percent be
hind the break of two years ago.
Senior Melissa Hoel considered
the split with national "the most
logical thing we could do."
"We weren't doing things their
way anyway, so why did we need
this tie at all." she said.
Senior Howard Kaplan called
the two years of probation "an
amusing situation." Although
each fraternity member was
paying $50 in dues to the na
tional. Kaplan remarked. "We
were not getting anything in

return except their condemna
tion."
With such support. Hilton af
firmed in an official statement.
"We are not just dropping the na
tional. hut more important!), es
tablishing a local fruternit\ in
which a diverse group of men and
women can carr\ 011 the traditions
and ideals of Tau Chapter."
Having relinquished its na
tional charter. Tau Chapter of Al
pha Sigma Phi reincorporated as
the local Irate? nit \ Alpha Sigma.
Have the members of Alpha
Sigma been able to carry
on the traditions and ideals
of Tau Chapter?
Alpha Sig provides "the best til
both worlds between a dorm and
a fraternity," Fisher said. "You
don't gi\c up anything: you gain a
coed atmosphere." current Al
pha Siu President Jon Kini:
added.
"Coed living played a large
role in my decision (to join Alpha

Sig), said first-year resident
Andy Seesel.
"If we stand for anything, we
stand for the idea that a randomly
selected group of people can es
tablish a sense of camaraderie,"
Fisher said.
Seeing women at 7:30 every
morning, causes men to "lose
their illusions about the opposite
sex," Fisher said. Alpha Sig
fosters friendship between the
sexes in a healthier way."
Compared to an all-male,
selective fraternity, A\lpha Sig "is
more like the real world," King
said. The conditions at Alpha Sig
help to break down the "us and
them attitude between men and
women, he said.
Despite the significant ways in
which Alpha Sig differs from the
norm, the residents take their
"fraternity-ness" very seriously,
said Scott Ludeke, resident assis
tant there.
Alpha Sig enjoys "a lot of fam
ily cohesion," and "a really social
atmosphere," according to resi
dent Phil Giordano.
Because of University housing
rules and the chance of the Draw,
Alpha Sig lacks the continuity of
the selective fraternities on
campus. There were 38 new resi
dents this year. Fisher said
To encourage the spirit of fra
ternity among the resides of Al
pha Sig, the house hold-, an in
tense initiation, a "four-night af
fair," said Fisher.
Initiating so many new mem
bers each year is a herculean task,
Fisher said. "We rely very heavily
on alumni." Yes, alumni return
each year to aid the initiation
process. One alumnus from about
1970 returns year after year,
Fisher said.
The party life typical of frater
nities exists at Alpha Sig. "We
have weekly parties but they are

not publicized," King said. "Most
fraternities host bar nights to get
girls. We don't have to do that,"
he said.
Alpha Sig does not remove it
self entirely from the all-campus
party scene. Each spring, the Ex
otic Erotic Ball, in addition to
providing an exhilirating evening,
stirs interest in living at Alpha Sig
as the Draw approaches. King
said.
But there are indeed differ
ences between Alpha Sig
and the traditional all-male,
selective frat. Ludeke occupies a
position that allows him to com
pare Alpha Sig and the traditional
fraternity in a knowledgeable
manner. He resides at Alpha
Sigma as RA but maintains his
status as a member of Theta
Delta Chi, an all-male, selective
fraternity.
I here is a whole spectrum of
life that you get by living with
women on a day-to-day basis that
you just don't get in an all-male
frat," he said.
At an all-male frat, "sexist atti
tudes are easily kindled," Ludeke
said. "It is very important for a
member to maintain his perspec
tive on the world around him.
And it is sometimes difficult."
"Sexual innuendo is alive and
well at Alpha Sig," he said, "but
it is not sexist.
"I stopped residing at the
Iheta Delts because I was tired of
the attitudes and the system,"
Ludeke said.
Nevertheless, he said that "all
male fraternities have their place.
The (all-male) fraternity experi
ence is a unique experience. It
provides people an intensity of
relationship that can't really be
had in any other situation.
"Men living there value their
all-male environment," an envi
ronment which is "unnatural but
enjoyable," Ludeke said.
On the issue of filling Alpha Sig
by the Draw in contrast to the
selective processes of the all-male

frats, Ludeke saw both strengths
and weaknesses. Obviously, Al
pha Sig enjoys more diversity, he
noted.
In terms of bonds between
men. the random method by
which Alpha Sig is filled
"definitely weakens them." Inter
action with women for members
of all-male fraternities, though,
occurs on a "more shallow, more
social level" than at Alpha Sig.
"Alpha Sig is a frat, but a very
unique frat," Ludeke concludes.
Jeff Gelles, president of Alpha
Delta Phi, an a 11-male,
selective fraternity, regards
Alpha Sig as "a different kind of
organization."
Gianni Ferruzzi, president
of Delta Kappa Epsilon, high
lights that "frats that are
recognized have an element of
selectivity that adds to a more
cohesive group." Houses that are
filled by the Draw "tend to be
more cliquish than a fraternity,"

he said.
Alpha Sig is fortunate in that
it's "not associated with any
wrongdoing like a (standard) fra
ternity might he,"he said.
In regard to the benefits and
drawbacks of accepting female
members into fraternities, Theta
Xi President Seth Glick said of
the Alpha Sig members, "'They
probably miss something, and we
miss something too."
Delta Kappa Epsilon tries to
overcome the difficulties of its all
male population, while still main
taining the traditional fraternity
structure, through the little
sister program, Ferruzzi said. In
this program, members of the
DKE house have secret santas,
hold a special day for their little
sisters and invite them over to the
house on an informal basis, he
suid.
"The University demands that
we're all-male," Gelles noted.
According to University regula
tions, a fraternity stands to lose its

official standing and be placed
into the Draw if it admits women.
"There is a sentiment among
some frat members that they
would like to admit women." It is,
however, "certainly not a
majority," he said.
" That's a flaw in the Univer
sity's approach," Gelles said. "It
is not discriminatory (for a stu
dent) to choose to live in all-male
housing," he said. "For them to
say that you have to be all-male is
discriminatory."
"We don't have any model that
we want to push everyone into,"
said Director of the Row Diana
Conklin. "We want every student
living group to be the best version
of what it is," she said.
The University regulation
prohibiting women in fraternities
remains in the books from years
past when a fraternity was gener
ally accepted only as a strictly all
male organization, Conklin said.

Sig), said first-year resident
Andy Seesel.
"If we stand for anything, we
stand for the idea that a randomly
selected group of people can es
tablish a sense of camaraderie,"
Fisher said.
Seeing women at 7:30 every
morning, causes men to "lose
their illusions about the opposite
sex," Fisher said. Alpha Sig
fosters friendship between the
sexes in a healthier way."
Compared to an all-male,
selective fraternity, A\lpha Sig "is
more like the real world," King
said. The conditions at Alpha Sig
help to break down the "us and
them attitude between men and
women, he said.
Despite the significant ways in
which Alpha Sig differs from the
norm, the residents take their
"fraternity-ness" very seriously,
said Scott Ludeke, resident assis
tant there.
Alpha Sig enjoys "a lot of fam
ily cohesion," and "a really social
atmosphere," according to resi
dent Phil Giordano.
Because of University housing
rules and the chance of the Draw,
Alpha Sig lacks the continuity of
the selective fraternities on
campus. There were 38 new resi
dents this year. Fisher said
To encourage the spirit of fra
ternity among the resides of Al
pha Sig, the house hold-, an in
tense initiation, a "four-night af
fair," said Fisher.
Initiating so many new mem
bers each year is a herculean task,
Fisher said. "We rely very heavily
on alumni." Yes, alumni return
each year to aid the initiation
process. One alumnus from about
1970 returns year after year,
Fisher said.
The party life typical of frater
nities exists at Alpha Sig. "We
have weekly parties but they are

not publicized," King said. "Most
fraternities host bar nights to get
girls. We don't have to do that,"
he said.
Alpha Sig does not remove it
self entirely from the all-campus
party scene. Each spring, the Ex
otic Erotic Ball, in addition to
providing an exhilirating evening,
stirs interest in living at Alpha Sig
as the Draw approaches. King
said.
But there are indeed differ
ences between Alpha Sig
and the traditional all-male,
selective frat. Ludeke occupies a
position that allows him to com
pare Alpha Sig and the traditional
fraternity in a knowledgeable
manner. He resides at Alpha
Sigma as RA but maintains his
status as a member of Theta
Delta Chi, an all-male, selective
fraternity.
I here is a whole spectrum of
life that you get by living with
women on a day-to-day basis that
you just don't get in an all-male
frat," he said.
At an all-male frat, "sexist atti
tudes are easily kindled," Ludeke
said. "It is very important for a
member to maintain his perspec
tive on the world around him.
And it is sometimes difficult."
"Sexual innuendo is alive and
well at Alpha Sig," he said, "but
it is not sexist.
"I stopped residing at the
Iheta Delts because I was tired of
the attitudes and the system,"
Ludeke said.
Nevertheless, he said that "all
male fraternities have their place.
The (all-male) fraternity experi
ence is a unique experience. It
provides people an intensity of
relationship that can't really be
had in any other situation.
"Men living there value their
all-male environment," an envi
ronment which is "unnatural but
enjoyable," Ludeke said.
On the issue of filling Alpha Sig
by the Draw in contrast to the
selective processes of the all-male

frats, Ludeke saw both strengths
and weaknesses. Obviously, Al
pha Sig enjoys more diversity, he
noted.
In terms of bonds between
men. the random method by
which Alpha Sig is filled
"definitely weakens them." Inter
action with women for members
of all-male fraternities, though,
occurs on a "more shallow, more
social level" than at Alpha Sig.
"Alpha Sig is a frat, but a very
unique frat," Ludeke concludes.
Jeff Gelles, president of Alpha
Delta Phi, an a 11-male,
selective fraternity, regards
Alpha Sig as "a different kind of
organization."
Gianni Ferruzzi, president
of Delta Kappa Epsilon, high
lights that "frats that are
recognized have an element of
selectivity that adds to a more
cohesive group." Houses that are
filled by the Draw "tend to be
more cliquish than a fraternity,"

he said.
Alpha Sig is fortunate in that
it's "not associated with any
wrongdoing like a (standard) fra
ternity might he,"he said.
In regard to the benefits and
drawbacks of accepting female
members into fraternities, Theta
Xi President Seth Glick said of
the Alpha Sig members, "'They
probably miss something, and we
miss something too."
Delta Kappa Epsilon tries to
overcome the difficulties of its all
male population, while still main
taining the traditional fraternity
structure, through the little
sister program, Ferruzzi said. In
this program, members of the
DKE house have secret santas,
hold a special day for their little
sisters and invite them over to the
house on an informal basis, he
suid.
"The University demands that
we're all-male," Gelles noted.
According to University regula
tions, a fraternity stands to lose its

official standing and be placed
into the Draw if it admits women.
"There is a sentiment among
some frat members that they
would like to admit women." It is,
however, "certainly not a
majority," he said.
" That's a flaw in the Univer
sity's approach," Gelles said. "It
is not discriminatory (for a stu
dent) to choose to live in all-male
housing," he said. "For them to
say that you have to be all-male is
discriminatory."
"We don't have any model that
we want to push everyone into,"
said Director of the Row Diana
Conklin. "We want every student
living group to be the best version
of what it is," she said.
The University regulation
prohibiting women in fraternities
remains in the books from years
past when a fraternity was gener
ally accepted only as a strictly all
male organization, Conklin said.

Indeed, that's a fraternity.
Right?
Wrong. The fraternity ol Alpha

residents 24 of whom are
women is tilled randomly by
the Draw each year and plays a
rather infrequent role in the a 1 1-

I lie forward-looking Alpha
igma fraternity here was also
tnong the first ol all the local

chapters ot the national Alpha
Sigma Phi organization to admit a
Jew and to admit a black. "The
(Stanford) chapter led the na
tional chapter to change its
bylaws," said I 9N4 Alpha Sig
President Ann Fisher.
111 1 973, Alpha Sig (at that
time, official!) a lan chapter
o! Alpha Sigma Phi) began to
admit women. "It wasn't a matter
ol choice." said 112 isher. "I he
house couldn't till itself."' It was a
matter of going coed or losing
the house, she said.
Upon accepting women. Alpha
Sig lost its official standing as a
fraternity with the University.
And. according to University reg
ulations. this loss of official stand
ing placed Alpha Sig into the
Draw. No longer able to select its
members In the traditional rush.
Alpha Sig had to contend with
tr\ing to build cohesion among
residents placed there largely at
random.
I or eight years, the national
council turned a blind eye to the
Stanford \lpha Sigma situation,
regarding the women residents as
"boarders." l isher said.

standards which demand all-male
membership, lisher said.

After two sears on probation,
the residents ot Alpha Sig voted
unanimously to renounce their
national charter and reincor

said.
"We were tired of taking it
faking that we're OK. that we're
following the rules." said Leon
Hilton, fraternity president in
1953. the year of the break.
According to Milton, the na
tional council insisted that the
Stanford chapter perform a
selective male rush. The council
also granted residency to women
but refused them full voting
rights.
"After nine years of women
being an equal part of everything
we do. we couldn't go back on
that, nor would we want to." Hil
ton said.
In retrospect. Fisher consid
ered it a "more positive move to
break with the national than to
wait until the national kicked us
out."
Alumni reaction was immedi
ate and divided. Some letters

were "openly hostile, while
others were "very, very touch
ing." Fisher said.
One letter was addressed to
"Mr. Mrs. Mv I.eon Hilton." An
other Alpha Sin alumnus, in contrast,
praised the members for their ac
tion and lamented that he had
lacked the courage to lead a
break with the national when the
council insisted the Stanford
chapter not admit Jews.
Despite the divided alumni re
action. residents of the house
have remained 100 percent be
hind the break of two years ago.
Senior Melissa Hoel considered
the split with national "the most
logical thing we could do."
"We weren't doing things their
way anyway, so why did we need
this tie at all." she said.
Senior Howard Kaplan called
the two years of probation "an
amusing situation." Although
each fraternity member was
paying $50 in dues to the na
tional. Kaplan remarked. "We
were not getting anything in

return except their condemna
tion."
With such support. Hilton af

sisters and invite them over to the
house on an informal basis, he
suid.
"The University demands that
we're all-male," Gelles noted.
According to University regula
tions, a fraternity stands to lose its

official standing and be placed
into the Draw if it admits women.
"There is a sentiment among
some frat members that they
would like to admit women." It is,
however, "certainly not a
majority," he said.
" That's a flaw in the Univer
sity's approach," Gelles said. "It
is not discriminatory (for a stu
dent) to choose to live in all-male
housing," he said. "For them to
say that you have to be all-male is
discriminatory."
"We don't have any model that
we want to push everyone into,"
said Director of the Row Diana
Conklin. "We want every student
living group to be the best version
of what it is," she said.
The University regulation
prohibiting women in fraternities
remains in the books from years
past when a fraternity was gener

male organization, Conklin said.

bylaws," said I 9N4 Alpha Sig
President Ann Fisher.
111 1 973, Alpha Sig (at that
time, official!) a lan chapter

admit women. "It wasn't a matter
ol choice." said 112 isher. "I he
house couldn't till itself."' It was a
matter of going coed or losing
the house, she said.
Upon accepting women. Alpha
Sig lost its official standing as a
fraternity with the University.
And. according to University reg

ing placed Alpha Sig into the

standards which demand all-male
membership, lisher said.

After two sears on probation,
the residents ot Alpha Sig voted
unanimously to renounce their
national charter and reincor
porate as a local fraternity, lisher
said.
"We were tired of taking it
faking that we're OK. that we're
following the rules." said Leon
Hilton, fraternity president in
1953. the year of the break.
According to Milton, the na
tional council insisted that the
Stanford chapter perform a
selective male rush. The council
also granted residency to women
but refused them full voting
rights.
"After nine years of women
being an equal part of everything
we do. we couldn't go back on
that, nor would we want to." Hil
ton said.
In retrospect. Fisher consid
ered it a "more positive move to
break with the national than to
wait until the national kicked us
out."
Alumni reaction was immedi
ate and divided. Some letters

were "openly hostile, while
others were "very, very touch
ing." Fisher said.
One letter was addressed to
"Mr. Mrs. Mv I.eon Hilton." An
other Alpha Sin alumnus, in contrast,
praised the members for their ac
tion and lamented that he had
lacked the courage to lead a
break with the national when the
council insisted the Stanford
chapter not admit Jews.
Despite the divided alumni re
action. residents of the house
have remained 100 percent be
hind the break of two years ago.
Senior Melissa Hoel considered
the split with national "the most
logical thing we could do."
"We weren't doing things their
way anyway, so why did we need
this tie at all." she said.
Senior Howard Kaplan called
the two years of probation "an
amusing situation." Although
each fraternity member was
paying $50 in dues to the na
tional. Kaplan remarked. "We
were not getting anything in

return except their condemna
tion."
With such support. Hilton af
firmed in an official statement.
"We are not just dropping the na
tional. hut more important!), es
tablishing a local fruternit\ in
which a diverse group of men and
women can carr\ 011 the traditions

Having relinquished its na

Have the members of Alpha
Sigma been able to carry
on the traditions and ideals
of Tau Chapter?
Alpha Sig provides "the best til
both worlds between a dorm and
a fraternity," Fisher said. "You
don't gi\c up anything: you gain a
coed atmosphere." current Al

Sig), said first-year resident
Andy Seesel.
"If we stand for anything, we
stand for the idea that a randomly
selected group of people can es
tablish a sense of camaraderie,"
Fisher said.
Seeing women at 7:30 every
morning, causes men to "lose
their illusions about the opposite
sex," Fisher said. Alpha Sig
fosters friendship between the
sexes in a healthier way."
Compared to an all-male,
selective fraternity, A\lpha Sig "is
more like the real world," King
said. The conditions at Alpha Sig
help to break down the "us and
them attitude between men and
women, he said.
Despite the significant ways in
which Alpha Sig differs from the
norm, the residents take their
"fraternity-ness" very seriously,
said Scott Ludeke, resident assis
tant there.
Alpha Sig enjoys "a lot of fam
ily cohesion," and "a really social
atmosphere," according to resi
dent Phil Giordano.
Because of University housing
rules and the chance of the Draw,
Alpha Sig lacks the continuity of
the selective fraternities on
campus. There were 38 new resi
dents this year. Fisher said
To encourage the spirit of fra
ternity among the resides of Al
pha Sig, the house hold-, an in
tense initiation, a "four-night af
fair," said Fisher.
Initiating so many new mem
bers each year is a herculean task,
Fisher said. "We rely very heavily
on alumni." Yes, alumni return
each year to aid the initiation
process. One alumnus from about
1970 returns year after year,
Fisher said.
The party life typical of frater
nities exists at Alpha Sig. "We
have weekly parties but they are

not publicized," King said. "Most
fraternities host bar nights to get
girls. We don't have to do that,"
he said.
Alpha Sig does not remove it
self entirely from the all-campus
party scene. Each spring, the Ex
otic Erotic Ball, in addition to
providing an exhilirating evening,
stirs interest in living at Alpha Sig
as the Draw approaches. King
said.
But there are indeed differ
ences between Alpha Sig
and the traditional all-male,
selective frat. Ludeke occupies a
position that allows him to com
pare Alpha Sig and the traditional
fraternity in a knowledgeable
manner. He resides at Alpha
Sigma as RA but maintains his
status as a member of Theta
Delta Chi, an all-male, selective
fraternity.
I here is a whole spectrum of
life that you get by living with
women on a day-to-day basis that
you just don't get in an all-male
frat," he said.
At an all-male frat, "sexist atti
tudes are easily kindled," Ludeke
said. "It is very important for a
member to maintain his perspec
tive on the world around him.
And it is sometimes difficult."
"Sexual innuendo is alive and
well at Alpha Sig," he said, "but
it is not sexist.
"I stopped residing at the
Iheta Delts because I was tired of
the attitudes and the system,"
Ludeke said.
Nevertheless, he said that "all
male fraternities have their place.
The (all-male) fraternity experi
ence is a unique experience. It
provides people an intensity of
relationship that can't really be
had in any other situation.
"Men living there value their
all-male environment," an envi
ronment which is "unnatural but
enjoyable," Ludeke said.
On the issue of filling Alpha Sig
by the Draw in contrast to the
selective processes of the all-male

frats, Ludeke saw both strengths
and weaknesses. Obviously, Al
pha Sig enjoys more diversity, he
noted.
In terms of bonds between
men. the random method by
which Alpha Sig is filled
"definitely weakens them." Inter
action with women for members
of all-male fraternities, though,
occurs on a "more shallow, more
social level" than at Alpha Sig.
"Alpha Sig is a frat, but a very
unique frat," Ludeke concludes.
Jeff Gelles, president of Alpha
Delta Phi, an a 11-male,
selective fraternity, regards
Alpha Sig as "a different kind of
organization."
Gianni Ferruzzi, president
of Delta Kappa Epsilon, high
lights that "frats that are
recognized have an element of
selectivity that adds to a more
cohesive group." Houses that are
filled by the Draw "tend to be
more cliquish than a fraternity,"

he said.
Alpha Sig is fortunate in that
it's "not associated with any
wrongdoing like a (standard) fra
ternity might he,"he said.
In regard to the benefits and
drawbacks of accepting female
members into fraternities, Theta
Xi President Seth Glick said of
the Alpha Sig members, "'They
probably miss something, and we
miss something too."
Delta Kappa Epsilon tries to
overcome the difficulties of its all
male population, while still main
taining the traditional fraternity
structure, through the little
sister program, Ferruzzi said. In
this program, members of the
DKE house have secret santas,
hold a special day for their little
sisters and invite them over to the
house on an informal basis, he
suid.
"The University demands that

wait until the national kicked us
out."
Alumni reaction was immedi
ate and divided. Some letters

were "openly hostile, while
others were "very, very touch
ing." Fisher said.
One letter was addressed to
"Mr. Mrs. Mv I.eon Hilton." An
other Alpha Sin alumnus, in contrast,
praised the members for their ac
tion and lamented that he had
lacked the courage to lead a
break with the national when the
council insisted the Stanford
chapter not admit Jews.
Despite the divided alumni re
action. residents of the house
have remained 100 percent be
hind the break of two years ago.
Senior Melissa Hoel considered
the split with national "the most
logical thing we could do."
"We weren't doing things their
way anyway, so why did we need
this tie at all." she said.
Senior Howard Kaplan called
the two years of probation "an
amusing situation." Although
each fraternity member was
paying $50 in dues to the na
tional. Kaplan remarked. "We
were not getting anything in

return except their condemna
tion."
With such support. Hilton af

Alpha Sig provides "the best til
both worlds between a dorm and
a fraternity," Fisher said. "You
don't gi\c up anything: you gain a
coed atmosphere." current Al
pha Siu President Jon Kini:

Sig), said first-year resident
Andy Seesel.
"If we stand for anything, we
stand for the idea that a randomly
selected group of people can es
tablish a sense of camaraderie,"
Fisher said.
Seeing women at 7:30 every
morning, causes men to "lose
their illusions about the opposite
sex," Fisher said. Alpha Sig
fosters friendship between the
sexes in a healthier way."
Compared to an all-male,
selective fraternity, A\lpha Sig "is
more like the real world," King
said. The conditions at Alpha Sig
help to break down the "us and
them attitude between men and
women, he said.
Despite the significant ways in
which Alpha Sig differs from the
norm, the residents take their
"fraternity-ness" very seriously,
said Scott Ludeke, resident assis
tant there.
Alpha Sig enjoys "a lot of fam
ily cohesion," and "a really social
atmosphere," according to resi
dent Phil Giordano.
Because of University housing
rules and the chance of the Draw,
Alpha Sig lacks the continuity of
the selective fraternities on
campus. There were 38 new resi
dents this year. Fisher said
To encourage the spirit of fra
ternity among the resides of Al
pha Sig, the house hold-, an in
tense initiation, a "four-night af
fair," said Fisher.
Initiating so many new mem
bers each year is a herculean task,
Fisher said. "We rely very heavily
on alumni." Yes, alumni return
each year to aid the initiation
process. One alumnus from about
1970 returns year after year,
Fisher said.
The party life typical of frater
nities exists at Alpha Sig. "We
have weekly parties but they are

not publicized," King said. "Most
fraternities host bar nights to get
girls. We don't have to do that,"
he said.
Alpha Sig does not remove it
self entirely from the all-campus
party scene. Each spring, the Ex
otic Erotic Ball, in addition to
providing an exhilirating evening,
stirs interest in living at Alpha Sig
as the Draw approaches. King
said.
But there are indeed differ
ences between Alpha Sig
and the traditional all-male,
selective frat. Ludeke occupies a
position that allows him to com
pare Alpha Sig and the traditional
fraternity in a knowledgeable
manner. He resides at Alpha
Sigma as RA but maintains his
status as a member of Theta
Delta Chi, an all-male, selective
fraternity.
I here is a whole spectrum of
life that you get by living with
women on a day-to-day basis that
you just don't get in an all-male
frat," he said.
At an all-male frat, "sexist atti
tudes are easily kindled," Ludeke
said. "It is very important for a
member to maintain his perspec
tive on the world around him.
And it is sometimes difficult."
"Sexual innuendo is alive and
well at Alpha Sig," he said, "but
it is not sexist.
"I stopped residing at the
Iheta Delts because I was tired of
the attitudes and the system,"
Ludeke said.
Nevertheless, he said that "all
male fraternities have their place.
The (all-male) fraternity experi
ence is a unique experience. It
provides people an intensity of
relationship that can't really be
had in any other situation.
"Men living there value their
all-male environment," an envi
ronment which is "unnatural but
enjoyable," Ludeke said.
On the issue of filling Alpha Sig
by the Draw in contrast to the
selective processes of the all-male

frats, Ludeke saw both strengths
and weaknesses. Obviously, Al
pha Sig enjoys more diversity, he
noted.
In terms of bonds between
men. the random method by
which Alpha Sig is filled
"definitely weakens them." Inter
action with women for members
of all-male fraternities, though,
occurs on a "more shallow, more
social level" than at Alpha Sig.
"Alpha Sig is a frat, but a very
unique frat," Ludeke concludes.
Jeff Gelles, president of Alpha
Delta Phi, an a 11-male,
selective fraternity, regards
Alpha Sig as "a different kind of
organization."
Gianni Ferruzzi, president
of Delta Kappa Epsilon, high
lights that "frats that are
recognized have an element of
selectivity that adds to a more
cohesive group." Houses that are
filled by the Draw "tend to be
more cliquish than a fraternity,"

he said.
Alpha Sig is fortunate in that
it's "not associated with any
wrongdoing like a (standard) fra
ternity might he,"he said.
In regard to the benefits and
drawbacks of accepting female
members into fraternities, Theta
Xi President Seth Glick said of
the Alpha Sig members, "'They
probably miss something, and we
miss something too."
Delta Kappa Epsilon tries to
overcome the difficulties of its all
male population, while still main
taining the traditional fraternity
structure, through the little
sister program, Ferruzzi said. In
this program, members of the
DKE house have secret santas,
hold a special day for their little
sisters and invite them over to the
house on an informal basis, he
suid.
"The University demands that
we're all-male," Gelles noted.
According to University regula
tions, a fraternity stands to lose its

official standing and be placed
into the Draw if it admits women.
"There is a sentiment among
some frat members that they
would like to admit women." It is,
however, "certainly not a
majority," he said.
" That's a flaw in the Univer
sity's approach," Gelles said. "It
is not discriminatory (for a stu
dent) to choose to live in all-male
housing," he said. "For them to
say that you have to be all-male is
discriminatory."
"We don't have any model that
we want to push everyone into,"
said Director of the Row Diana
Conklin. "We want every student
living group to be the best version
of what it is," she said.
The University regulation
prohibiting women in fraternities
remains in the books from years
past when a fraternity was gener
ally accepted only as a strictly all
male organization, Conklin said.
