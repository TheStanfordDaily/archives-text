# 'Sexual innuendo is alive and well at Alpha Sig'
## It's a fraternity, but with a big difference

lefines "fraternity" as follows: "a
"evidential organization where
men, and only men, selected by
the exacting scrutiny of Rush, are
privileged to live, and where only
the most daring of women

venture for an occasional social
engagement — see Decd/cmcn
Indeed, that's a fraternity.
Right?
Wrong. The fraternity ol Alpha
Sigma, 5K5 Uowell I ane. has 50
residents 24 of whom are
women is tilled randomly by
the Draw each year and plays a
rather infrequent role in the a 1 1-
:ampus party scene.
Innovation, however, is hardly
i new concept to Alpha Sigma.
At one ol the lew campus-wide
\lpha Sig events last year, the
wotie Frolic Mall, pa i tier s
iirived "wearing everything Irom
i-strings to flasher outfits to
iprons to fish-net stockings." said
ormer Alpha Sig resident Dave
Jaszucki. I he more than 300
evelcrs boozed and boogied
lirough the night, with an
leva ted "go-go" cage as the
a nee floor. Maszucki said.
Maszucki called the 1 \otic
i otic " the wildest part , I've
ecu on campus. I very tiling is out
if control."
I lie forward-looking Alpha
igma fraternity here was also
tnong the first ol all the local

chapters ot the national Alpha
Sigma Phi organization to admit a
Jew and to admit a black. "The
(Stanford) chapter led the na
tional chapter to change its
bylaws," said I 9N4 Alpha Sig
President Ann Fisher.
111 1 973, Alpha Sig (at that
time, official!) a lan chapter
o! Alpha Sigma Phi) began to
admit women. "It wasn't a matter
ol choice." said 112 isher. "I he
house couldn't till itself."' It was a
matter of going coed or losing
the house, she said.
Upon accepting women. Alpha
Sig lost its official standing as a
fraternity with the University.
And. according to University reg
ulations. this loss of official stand
ing placed Alpha Sig into the
Draw. No longer able to select its
members In the traditional rush.
Alpha Sig had to contend with
tr\ing to build cohesion among
residents placed there largely at
random.
I or eight years, the national
council turned a blind eye to the
Stanford \lpha Sigma situation,
regarding the women residents as
"boarders." l isher said.
111 1 1 ><N I . however. Day na
(ioklline. then president of Alpha
Sig. attended the fraternity's na
tional convention, where she in
troduced a resolution that would
have given each local chapter the
option ol going coed.
It met a resounding defeat."
(ioklline s;iill • When I intro
duced mysell as president ol the
Stanford chapter. 1 remember
one gu\ from the North Carolina
chapter |usi looked at me and
said.'Sureh I must not be well.
I he national was "forced to
recognize the women here." I ish
er said. In response, the Stan
lord chapter was placed on six
month probation for failure to
comply with the minimum stand
ards of the national council,
standards which demand all-male
membership, lisher said.

After two sears on probation,
the residents ot Alpha Sig voted
unanimously to renounce their
national charter and reincor
porate as a local fraternity, lisher
said.
"We were tired of taking it
faking that we're OK. that we're
following the rules." said Leon
Hilton, fraternity president in
1953. the year of the break.
According to Milton, the na
tional council insisted that the
Stanford chapter perform a
selective male rush. The council
also granted residency to women
but refused them full voting
rights.
"After nine years of women
being an equal part of everything
we do. we couldn't go back on
that, nor would we want to." Hil
ton said.
In retrospect. Fisher consid
ered it a "more positive move to
break with the national than to
wait until the national kicked us
out."
Alumni reaction was immedi
ate and divided. Some letters

were "openly hostile, while
others were "very, very touch
ing." Fisher said.
One letter was addressed to
"Mr. Mrs. Mv I.eon Hilton." An
other Alpha Sin alumnus, in contrast,
praised the members for their ac
tion and lamented that he had
lacked the courage to lead a
break with the national when the
council insisted the Stanford
chapter not admit Jews.
Despite the divided alumni re
action. residents of the house
have remained 100 percent be
hind the break of two years ago.
Senior Melissa Hoel considered
the split with national "the most
logical thing we could do."
"We weren't doing things their
way anyway, so why did we need
this tie at all." she said.
Senior Howard Kaplan called
the two years of probation "an
amusing situation." Although
each fraternity member was
paying $50 in dues to the na
tional. Kaplan remarked. "We
were not getting anything in

return except their condemna
tion."
With such support. Hilton af
firmed in an official statement.
"We are not just dropping the na
tional. hut more important!), es
tablishing a local fruternit\ in
which a diverse group of men and
women can carr\ 011 the traditions
and ideals of Tau Chapter."
Having relinquished its na
tional charter. Tau Chapter of Al
pha Sigma Phi reincorporated as
the local Irate? nit \ Alpha Sigma.
Have the members of Alpha
Sigma been able to carry
on the traditions and ideals
of Tau Chapter?
Alpha Sig provides "the best til
both worlds between a dorm and
a fraternity," Fisher said. "You
don't gi\c up anything: you gain a
coed atmosphere." current Al
pha Siu President Jon Kini:

role in my decision (to join Alpha
