# Greek parties
## They aren't just for togas any more 
### Debbie Rubenstein Staff writer 
Partying at Stanford is an exis
tence in itself.
And though many claim to
have no interest in attending the
hashes thrown by fraternities and
sororities throughout the school
year, almost every party seems to
attract hundreds of students

The Stanford student who
takes advantage of the average
bar night or weekend fraternity
party often fails to reali/e the in
genuity, creativity and cost in
volved; fraternities often run into
the thousands of dollars before
the last palm frond and waterfall
are in place.
The recent I ntorf ratcrnitx

Council crackdown on fraternity
parties has caused some major
changes in fraternity party policy,
though. The II C' issued a set of
guidelines which require two IFC
monitors to be present at each
party, and it has become standard
practice at most fraternities to
check guests' IDs or dorm kc\s or
to have a host traternitx member

vouch tor invidual guests in order
to keep high school students
it
Main fraternities have also in
stituted their own policies to
prevent parties from getting out
of hand. The Deke House, tor ex
ample. has two members that try
to guard against any misconduct:
former Deke President Ciianni
Ferruzzi explained. "We try to
keep on our toes."
Mike I.lerandi. president of
Sigma Chi. said that in the past he
and a residential adviser (RA)
have kept watch over parties to
guard against any problems.
He said the Sigma Chis are
trving to get across to Stanford
students the idea that "even
though parties are called "open
parties.' they are coming as guests
ot the fraternities." When a situa
tion uets out of hand the host fra
ternity usually gets the blame,
I.lerandi said, "but the responsi
bility should fall on the heads of
the guests themselves."
Kappa Sigma John Kelly said
that the Kappa Sigs ask belliger
ent guests to leave the fraternity's
parties, and if they refuse, they
can be charged with trespassing:
calling the police is a more attrac
tive alternative than assuming the
risks involved in trying to throw
out guests without police help. he
said.
Kappa Alpha President Bret
Sherman said he refuses to allow
anyone who is noticably in
ebriated or carrying alcohol to
enter his fraternity during parties.
And like Llerandi and Kelly,
Sherman said he would call in the
police if necessary â€” but only un
der extreme circumstances.
"But we would do it,"he said.
Non-Stanford students, espe
cially high school students, are
strongly discouraged from attend
ing fraternity parties.
Kelly -said the host fraternity is
responsible for guests' safety and
can be sued, and that as a result,
all members of his fraternity have
been told to keep high school stu
dents out of parties there.
Andy Messing said he agrees
and tries to keep open Phi Delt
parties restricted to Stanford stu
dents.

Uerandi said that generally he
has been able to identify hinh
school students "by the wa\ thc\
hung out."
They "have no place at Stan
ford parties in general." he said.
Delta lau Delta follows less
stringent policies, according to
Dolt President Jonathan /.ierck.
He s.iid that it the University
forbade the entrance ol hinh
school students to parties, he
would enforce it. but as Univer
sity pnlic\ currently stands. "We
keep our eyes out and keep
(them) away from the alcohol."
Ihe Delts "basically just open
the door and s;iy "C rnon. let's
have a good time." " he said.
Fraternities are not as strict
about college students from insti
tutions other than Stanford
showing up at open parties. Many
fraternity presidents said they of
ten invite students from other
schools down for the weekend
and do not mind students from
visiting schools attending their
parties
Uerandi said he does not think
that the flyers advertising the par
ties were responsible "for
drawing the randoms from off
camp. He said that it is pretty
comn \ for these people to
"crui campus" and listen for
noisi. . music.
M.m\ parties are centered
around themes. The Phi
Delts. for example, hold
an annual Pirate Party. The party
stints in the late afternoon, ac
cording to Messing, and everyone
comes dressed in a costume.
1 he house is transformed into a
pirate ship, lie s;ii<.l. The inside is
covered with palm fronds and
flowers and a moat is built outside
with a bridge over it which must t
be crossed before entering the J
house.
Messing said the party starts
out as a treasure hunt and the
partiers must travel from room to j
room to find clues. In each room, 1
different drinks and horsj
d'oeuvres are served, and thea
house's bar is decorated tofl
resemble a ship.
When the treasure hunt ends,
the members and their guests
feast on a tremendous meal, said
Messing.
"The decorations really are
pretty nice," he said.
The Pirate Party is by invitation
only. But the Phi Delts also hold
an open "Kamikaze" party each
year. Headbands with Japanese
letters on them are distributed to
all those willing to down a
Kamika/e, a potent mixture ot
vodka, triple sec and lime juice.
I his year's tropical island
party, hosted by Sigma Chi
pledges, provided an appropriate
beach theme to the Stanford
campus. Sigma Chi President
I.lerandi said the tropical island
party was this year's version ol
the party pledges put on lor
actives each fall. Every year, the
pledges choose a theme and then

kick the actives out of the house
tor 24 hours to get things ready.
At this year's party, the actives,
dressed in appropriate costumes,
were required to enter the top of
the house, which was supposed to
he at an altitude of around 30,000
feet.
"It was cold up there with fake
snow on the ground," I.lerandi
said. Each person was given a
cold drink, such as "volcano
punch."
A convenient mattress pro
vided ;i quick slide downstairs to
the island level, which w;is
decorated with sand and
surlhoards. I lie living room was a
thatch hut.
"They made a mess of the
place, hut it was fun." I.lerandi
said.
At the bottom of the hist set of
stairs, the active found himself in
an underwater simulation.
"It was all simulated as though
you were underwater." I.lerandi
said, lo enter the room where a

band played, the revelers passed
through the a mock-up of a
shark's mouth.
I heme parties are those which
seem to be the least controversial
at Stanford.
"It is a way for fraternity mem
bers to invite three or four of
their closest friends.'" said senior
Michael Riley, a Phi Delt who has
been disassociated from the fra
ternity system for three years.
Riley also said he believes fra
ternities are "'very image
conscious."
"One of the many reasons a
person joins a fraternity is to be
identified with a definite
group. . . . The main vehicle for
maintaining this image is the par
tics they throw." he said.
Freshman Firesides are an
other type of invitational
part\ in which some frater
nity men indulge. For these par
tics. freshman women are invited
to traternities as dates of frater
nity members. But these parties
arc far from universally popular.
Deke President Ferru/zi said
he ti ntls it "particularly revolting"
to invite freshman women to a
special party based on their
Froshbook pictures.
Ihe Dckes have instead a
"little sister" program which they
believe to be a more positive ap
proach than firesides. The "little
sisters" join the Dckes for dinner
occasionally and participate with
them in a Secret Santa exchange.
Formals are a way for fraterni
ties and sororities to come to

gether. The Kappa Alpha Thetas.
;t campus sorority better known
as the Thetas. have a formal at
the end of each quarter, said Al
lison Lutz. Theta president. Last
year the Pi Beta Phis, or Pi Phis,
held their -sprint! formal at the
Mark Hopkins Hotel in San Fran
cisco. said Pi Phi President
Carolyn Benson.
I he formals ;tre either separate
or co-operative efforts with other
sororities or fraternities. Since
sororities do not have Universitv
residences, formals ;ire the main
extravaganza in which sororities
participate.
Ihe Delta Gammas also have
occassional happy hours and
brunches, said Cindy Peabodv.
DG president. They hire disc
jockeys or bands, or pla\ party
tapes.
Some sororities, such its the
Delta Sigma Thetas. are not so
cial sororities; they apply their
energy to fund-raising activities
and community service. President
leresa Fields of the Delta Sigma
I hetas said her sorority holds no
formals or big social events.
Theme and formal parties are
not the only forms of enter
tainment at fraternities.
Weekly bar nights play an inte
gral role in campus social life. The
Beta lheta Pi fraternity is
notorious for its Thursday bar
nights, the Kappa Sigmas. the Al
pha Delts and SAFs for their
Wednesday parties.
Bar nights are open and tend to
provide a more informal and

casual atmosphere. Many also
center around a theme to add to
the festivities. Ihe Kappa Sigs.
tor example. already have had
Boxer Shorts. South of the Bor
der and Caddy shack themes.
By having themes, the KAs try
to "de-emphasize the fact that
you are having just a drink." their
president explained.
Kappa Alpha Psi. an unhoused
black fraternity, does not gear its
parties toward alcohol, explained
lerry Jackson, the fraternity's
president.
"I don't have anything against
having alcohol. ... I don't think
the theme should be alcohol." he
said. Other fraternities tend to
center their parties around alco
hol. and when the bar runs drv
people generally become less in
terested. he said.
Kappa Alpha Psi tries to "stay
away from that stereotype." Jack
son said.
Just before the Super Bowl, the
Kappas had a Kappa Kick-off
party at which they invited "all
people within our age group"
from the Bay Area. Jackson said.
I he party included students from
both the University of California
at Berkeley and San Jose State.
The party centered around
music. "The Control Crew." a
group of disc jockeys, provided
the entertainment. Jackson said
his fraternity provides "good
music, good people and we're
there to have a good time."
Fraternities such as the Dekes

and I heta \i also emphasize dan
cing as a way to get students in
volved in something other than
alcohol. Messing emphasized that
much of the money spent on Phi
Delt parties goes to accommodate
those who do not go just to drink:
Disc jockeys, bands, food and
non-alcoholic beverages make up
a large part ot the Phi Delts" par
ties.
Fraternity parties get mixed
reviews from students here.
"I really don't go to fra
ternitv parties that often." said

senior Robert Netting. "I really
don't find them that interesting."
"The people I wind up talking
to are people I know anyway. he
said. But. he said, fraternities are
a necessars part ot Stanford s so
cial life and a lot of people enjo>
going to them.
"The older you get the less of
ten you go to parties, said senior
Susan McKay. "Party talk gets
boring after a while."
"Open parties are way too
crowded, said Riley, who is an
RA at Roble.
'The big open parties are at
tractive. especially to the fresh
men and sophomores. . . . I hey
are fun. a great place to drop in
and have a drink, but it gets really
old by the time you're a sopho
more or junior." he said.
Riley and McKay both agreed
that fraternities have a very im
portant social value at Stanford.
Other students also expressed
their lack of approval or enjoy
ment of fraternity parties, but
declined to be quoted because
they did not want to offend their
fraternity friends.
Seth Glick, president of Theta
\i, said fraternities are, overall,
"a valuable asset to the Stanford
community." He said he enjoyed
going to parties at other fraterni
ties in addition to his own.
