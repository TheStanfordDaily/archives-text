# Greek parties
## They aren't just for togas any more 
### Debbie Rubenstein Staff writer 
Partying at Stanford is an exis
tence in itself.
And though many claim to
have no interest in attending the
hashes thrown by fraternities and
sororities throughout the school
year, almost every party seems to
attract hundreds of students

The Stanford student who
takes advantage of the average
bar night or weekend fraternity
party often fails to reali/e the in
genuity, creativity and cost in
volved; fraternities often run into
the thousands of dollars before
the last palm frond and waterfall
are in place.
The recent I ntorf ratcrnitx

Council crackdown on fraternity
parties has caused some major
changes in fraternity party policy,
though. The II C' issued a set of
guidelines which require two IFC
monitors to be present at each
party, and it has become standard
practice at most fraternities to
check guests' IDs or dorm kc\s or
to have a host traternitx member

vouch tor invidual guests in order
to keep high school students
it
Main fraternities have also in
stituted their own policies to
prevent parties from getting out
of hand. The Deke House, tor ex
ample. has two members that try
to guard against any misconduct:
former Deke President Ciianni
Ferruzzi explained. "We try to
keep on our toes."
Mike I.lerandi. president of
Sigma Chi. said that in the past he
and a residential adviser (RA)
have kept watch over parties to
guard against any problems.
He said the Sigma Chis are
trving to get across to Stanford
students the idea that "even
though parties are called "open
parties.' they are coming as guests
ot the fraternities." When a situa
tion uets out of hand the host fra
ternity usually gets the blame,
I.lerandi said, "but the responsi
bility should fall on the heads of
the guests themselves."
Kappa Sigma John Kelly said
that the Kappa Sigs ask belliger
ent guests to leave the fraternity's
parties, and if they refuse, they
can be charged with trespassing:
calling the police is a more attrac
tive alternative than assuming the
risks involved in trying to throw
out guests without police help. he
said.
Kappa Alpha President Bret
Sherman said he refuses to allow
anyone who is noticably in
ebriated or carrying alcohol to
enter his fraternity during parties.
And like Llerandi and Kelly,
Sherman said he would call in the
police if necessary â€” but only un
der extreme circumstances.
"But we would do it,"he said.
Non-Stanford students, espe
cially high school students, are
strongly discouraged from attend
ing fraternity parties.
Kelly -said the host fraternity is
responsible for guests' safety and
can be sued, and that as a result,
all members of his fraternity have
been told to keep high school stu
dents out of parties there.
Andy Messing said he agrees
and tries to keep open Phi Delt
parties restricted to Stanford stu
dents.

Uerandi said that generally he
has been able to identify hinh
school students "by the wa\ thc\
hung out."
They "have no place at Stan
ford parties in general." he said.
Delta lau Delta follows less
stringent policies, according to
Dolt President Jonathan /.ierck.
He s.iid that it the University
forbade the entrance ol hinh
school students to parties, he
would enforce it. but as Univer
sity pnlic\ currently stands. "We
keep our eyes out and keep
(them) away from the alcohol."
Ihe Delts "basically just open
the door and s;iy "C rnon. let's
have a good time." " he said.
Fraternities are not as strict
about college students from insti
tutions other than Stanford
showing up at open parties. Many
fraternity presidents said they of
ten invite students from other
schools down for the weekend
and do not mind students from
visiting schools attending their
parties
Uerandi said he does not think
that the flyers advertising the par
ties were responsible "for
drawing the randoms from off
camp. He said that it is pretty
comn \ for these people to
"crui campus" and listen for
noisi. . music.
M.m\ parties are centered
around themes. The Phi
Delts. for example, hold
an annual Pirate Party. The party
stints in the late afternoon, ac
cording to Messing, and everyone
comes dressed in a costume.
1 he house is transformed into a
pirate ship, lie s;ii<.l. The inside is
covered with palm fronds and
flowers and a moat is built outside
with a bridge over it which must t
be crossed before entering the J
house.
Messing said the party starts
out as a treasure hunt and the
partiers must travel from room to j
room to find clues. In each room, 1
different drinks and horsj
d'oeuvres are served, and thea
house's bar is decorated tofl
resemble a ship.
