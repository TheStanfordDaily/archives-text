## 
### Clay Calvert Senior staff writer 
On most Friday and Saturday nights at Stan
lord. students flock to parties hosted b\ fraterni
ties and dormitories on campus. I hey consume a
lot of beer, chips and perhaps some equally -
attractive-non-alcoholic alternatives, often dan
cing to the sound of a live band. Little thought is
given by the revelers to the cost of such bashes or
the source of money for them.
Chances are the fraternity party you went to
last Saturday night, il it featured a band and
seemingly endless quantities of beer, was thrown
to the the tune of $bOO to $XOO. Not a small sum
for one night of carousing.
I he budgets for these parties are determined
by each house and are not regulated In the I di
versity. "We never ask to see them. " said Row
I)ireetor Diana ( onklin.
(ireek funding for such parties gencrallv comes
from social dues required of all fiaternitv mem
bers In their houses.
Dues range from $50 to $100 per quarter,
depending on the numbei of house residents and
the extent to which a fiaternitv goes to attract
hicis during Rush. In addition, at least one frater
nity supplements its social dues with a special
lund allocated strictly lor Rush.
Sctli (ilick. president of lheta \i. said Ins Ira
ternity has social clues of $75 a quarter, assessed
to each of M brothels. Rush is the "major func
tion" on which money is spent, he said, adding
that I hcta \i holds two pai tics and one bar night
during Rush.
I hcta \i is not alone in its financial emphasis
on Rush. Delta lau Delta, for instance, spends
around $1,500 of its social budget on the annual
spring event, while I'hi Delta l heta tops that fig
ure with expenditures of approximately $3,000.
Hands for such parties cost between $400 and
$500. with alcohol purchases frequently totalling
more than $300 for each party.
( dick said most ol the money for social events
comes from current house residents, adding that
alumni are "not that active." with the exception
of special drives for house projects. I his is not

the case at all fraternities, however, according to
Delta Kappa I psilon President Gianni Ferruz/i.
Ferru/./i said the Dekes have a "really good
alumni network" which is "extremely helpful"
during Rush it funds run low.
I he Dekes' 30 house residents pay social dues
ranging from $N0 to $100 a quarter, according to
l erru//i. I le noted that spring quarter. with three
Rush parties and two other campus hashes, is the
period of heaviest spending, with social costs run
ning "close to $2,000."
In addition to parties. Ferruz/i said social dues
also cover a Thanksgiving dinner for a senior
citizens' group in Palo Alto and a "Fittle Sister"
dinner, lie added that the national meeting of
DKI was held in San Francisco after Christmas,
with money from social dues going toward
financing part of the event.
Phi Delta Ihcta. according to President Ed
Mciuh. spends approximately $7,000 during
spring quarter on Rush parties, campus parties
before and after. Rush and a private party for
bids. Bendy estimated roughly $3,000 is spent
solelv on Rush.
Jonathan /icrk. president ol Delta I an Delta,
said his fraternity charges its 42 residents "about
$60" a quarter in social dues. During the three
nights of Rush parties, the fraternity spends ap
proximately $ 1.500.
/icrk s;nd that sum is probably somewhat less
than must fraternities spend''because Delta Tau
Delta is "probably a lot different from other fra
ternities. . We don't actively rush people,"
adding that the fraternity will "welcome
anybody' who wants to join.
The cost of parties at non-Greek row houses
tend to be somewhat less than those thrown by
fraternities.
According to Derek Paserelli. resident assis
tant at the American Studies House, social dues
are $25 a quarter for each of the 50 house resi
dents I lie house throws an average of three open
parties a quarter, costing approximately $125 a

I hcta \i is not alone in its financial emphasis
on Rush. Delta lau Delta, for instance, spends
around $1,500 of its social budget on the annual
spring event, while I'hi Delta l heta tops that fig
ure with expenditures of approximately $3,000.

of special drives for house projects. I his is not

the case at all fraternities, however, according to
Delta Kappa I psilon President Gianni Ferruz/i.

alumni network" which is "extremely helpful"
during Rush it funds run low.

said his fraternity charges its 42 residents "about
$60" a quarter in social dues. During the three
nights of Rush parties, the fraternity spends ap
proximately $ 1.500.

than must fraternities spend''because Delta Tau
Delta is "probably a lot different from other fra
ternities. . We don't actively rush people,"
adding that the fraternity will "welcome
anybody' who wants to join.
The cost of parties at non-Greek row houses
