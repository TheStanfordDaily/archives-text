# A 						view from the world of men
## Frat residents enjoy stable environment 
### Lawrence Green 
Lawrence Green is a member of
Theta Delta Chi. He wrote this es
say to correct what he sees as mis
conceptions about fraternity life.

Living arrangements in a fra
ternity are pretty much the same
as those in other campus
residences.
You wake up in the morning,
shower, eat breakfast, get to class.
But as Sigma Chi president Mike
Llerandi says,"The atmosphere
is definitely different at
mealtime." In a dorm it's easy to
live with neighbors for an entire
year and never really get to know
them.
It's harder to do that in a frat.
The social atmosphere is "a lot
more relaxed because you know
the guys a lot more," Llerandi
says.
Around lunchtime, house
members pass the time chatting,
eating and reading the
newspapers or participating in a
favorite lunchtime diversion of
many Theta Delts — watching the
ABC-TV soap opera "All My
Children."
Just for the record, Theta Delts
aren't the only fraternal ad
herents to daytime drama. Phi
Delta Theta President Ed Bendy,
not to be outdone, confesses that
"several guys up here (the Phi
Delt house) watch 'All My
Children' at lunchtime too.' "
Try finding that kind of togeth
erness in a dorm.
As classes end, the day is only
just beginning at Theta Delta Chi.
Some members work, others head
for the library; varsity athletes go
to practice. There's usually a
game of basketball or volleyball
in the afternoon.
After dinner it's back to the li
brary or the privacy of one's room
for studying. "It's pretty quiet in
the evening," when most Phi
Delts are hitting the books,
Bendy says. Like other members
of the Stanford community, fra
ternity members came here to
pass courses first and have fun
later. While a few fraternity
people prefer to think of their or
ganizations as non-academic
living quarters, scratching the

surface reveals a group of hard
working students. It could be that
fraternity members are more in
tense in their studies than other
students because many prefer to
have schoolwork out of the way in
order to open up free time for so
cial activities.
After studying is done —
usually around 11 or midnight —
the houses may liven up a bit.
"Most of the guys congregate
in the kitchen after studying . . .
some guys go to the (Dutch)
Goose," says Bendy.
One of the most enjoyable
parts of the fraternal lifestyle are
the "informal late-night rap ses
sions" that occur after study.
Nothing is arranged, it just hap
pens — the informal get
togethers in the den, or the spon
taneous trips to the Goose.
Typical day in a fraternity? It's
the same in many respects to
dorm living except that dorm life
misses out on the closeness that
only fraternities can cultivate.
But to really appreciate and
understand fraternities, the
stereotypes that plague the
system must be broken down
completely. As a start, it's time to
do away with the "fraternities
are-a-macho-realm myth."
Llerandi understands this.
"I've worked with blue-collar
workers, and whenever a large
group of guys get together,
whether it's a fraternity [or group
of construction workers] they're
going to tend to talk about
women in a derogatory manner."
He adds that most of the time
this talk about women is artic
ulated in a "light or funny man
ner" and that "in almost every
case these men wouldn't talk that
way with a woman present."
In other words, fraternities
ought to be compared with any
group of men because all men
have the same human tendencies.
So it's unfair to single out the
fraternal system as a bastion of
sexism.
Part of the reason for this
misperception lies directly within
the makeup of the houses, ac
cording to Sigma Chi's Llerandi.
He says living in a fraternity
means, obviously, that everyone

is male, "So when we see a girl
walking in our halls naturally we
react" in a way that may seem ag
gressive or perhaps sexist to the
particular woman "because we're
not used to seeing her" in the
house on a daily basis.
A woman walking into a frater
nity will not neccessarily receive
cold stares and snide remarks, but
she may not receive a red-carpet
treatment either. The fraternity
as a macho realm is an image that
was built around fraternities be
cause men as a group may
sometimes act apparently sexist.
A fraternity house is merely a
group of men under one roof, so
making that analogy is easy.
The other myth that continu
ally plagues fraternities deals with
alcohol.
Many people would like to
believe that fraternities are

campus reincarnations of the clas
sic beer garden. Beer or any type
of alcohol may be a prevalent fac
tor in fraternity parties, but
not in fraternity life.
It's true that many fraternities
here have tap systems that are
more or less full of beer any day
of the week, but that doesn't nec
cessarily imply constant con
sumption.
Bendy says that at the Phi Delt
house alcohol is virtually
"nonexistent until after study
ing." Even then it is kept in con
trol. House members do not flock
to the bar at midnight and go on
drinking binges that last well into
the morning every night.
In the final analysis, fraternities
have fallen prey to an image that
is usually misleading or
downgrading. But it is easy to
criticize the entire fraternal sys

tern when a few isolated incidents
are extrapolated out of context.
As Bendy says, a fraternity's
image can easily be distorted by a
few individuals who "have strong
personalities and make them
selves known on campus. Other
students draw conclusions" from
these individuals. Often, those
conclusions aren't the most flat
tering.
To outsiders, fraternities seem
to be places of misconduct and
recklessness. To really understand
the Greek way of life you've
really got to be a Greek; other
wise there will always be an ele
ment of mystery. After all, the
original American college frater
nities were wholly secret brother
hoods.
Perhaps fraternities are content
to retain some of that flavor
today.
