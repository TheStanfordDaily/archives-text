## 
### Cameron kaller Staff writer 
ou mas think \ou know what
Stanford's sororities are like, but
then again, maybe sou don't.
"Sororities are nothing like the
stereotype would lead sou to
believe." said senior Mars Hoss
field. a member of Kappa Alpha
Theta.
"For most girls, sororities can
offer an added dimension to their
Stanford education — without
dominating it. It is just another
i.tisits alongside their other aca
demic and social commitments."
she said.
Senior Sarah Allen, also a
member of Kappa Alpha Theta.
said she feels that "Unless some
one has been in a sorority. they
have no basis for cutting them
down It's the same was people
cut down co-ops without really
knowing anything about them, by
saying that all they do is bake
earth-bread, and that all we do is
put on makeup."
.cording to Debbie Widrow,
nidations chairman for Delta
Gamma, there is more to
sororities than meets the eye.
"There's a lot more to
>rorities than partying. Last year
\se raised Sl.OOO for the Office of
Student Services so they could
buy a machine that magnifies

reading material for disabled stu
dents. We also help bs reading
stories to blind children, as well as
donating money to our national
philanthropy."
Senior Megan Talbott. a mem
ber of Pi Beta Phi. and lnter
sorority Council rush chairman
tor 1 1 >S5. said that "sororities
here otter a lot more for people
who happened not to get every
thing they ssanted out of Residen
tial Education."
Said Widrow. "Some people
are definitely in them just tor the
social aspects, and some girls rush
simply to meet other girls. It's
scry easy to meet guss around
here. but forming close
friendships with giils is a lot
harder, especially at this age. for
some reason. Still others join
sororities because they're inter
ested in the communits service
possibilities. Most communis,
though, people do it for a combi
nation of the three."
All of the sororities generally
hold a sveekly meeting of one
kind or another, during which
they can plan for future events, or
just share each others' company.
The meetings are usually led by
the sorority's president, and all of
the other officers present infor
mal reports on their particular
concerns.

Often, the social chairman or
ganizes a formal and several
casual get-togethers with other
groups, which am member may
attend. No sorority function is
mandatory, with the exception of
Rush activities in the spring.
Allen said. "You get out of .1
sorority essentially what you put
in to it."
What distinguishes Stanford's
sororities from systems 011 most
other campuses is simply that
they exist unhoused.
"Most sorority members at
Stanford don't want housing."
Hossfeld said.
"Most of the girls don't iust
circulate within their sorority.
Rather, their sorority provides an
additional and not an exclusive
circle of friends. This is the main
difference between our system
and those at other schools. It is in
this fashion that we are able to
maintain our low-key status."
The desire not for housing,
but for a sort of "Sorority
Lodge" on campus, is fre
quently discussed among the
members ol the different
sororities, and more recency
amonu the Row directors.

"It would be really nice to have
a place on campus for meetings or
storage or whatever, just as any
club or organization likes to have
its own headquarters." Hossfeld
said.
Also differentiating Stanford
sororities from those on other
campuses in the Rush system.
According to Allen. Rush is
"obviously the worst part ol
sororities, although, from what
I've beard, it's as low kc\ as pos
sible compared to most other col
leges and universities."
"We have probably the best
system ot any school 1 know of. in
terms of pressure, and in terms ol
formality. Stanford is hardk .1
cut-throat system compared to
any big state school." lalbott
said.
Allen emphasized that "girls at
use and UCLA are suicidal
when it comes to Rush. "Widrow
added. "You live or die depend
ing on whether you get into a cer
tain sorority at many schools, es
peciallv ones where the alterna
tive housing situations are nil."
"II there were any better way
to conduct Rush, we'd do it. but
the hest aspect is that mOsi
atnone who wants to he in .

sorority can he in one," Hossfelt
said.
Talhott s;iid, "The supply ant
demand here seems to he mort
equitable than it is in most othei
systems. Obviously, there arc
going to he girls who don't gel
everything they want, hut it's easy
to make 2(1 unhapp\ girls seem
like 200."
"It is very hard during Rush to
realize what you personally want
to get out of a sorority." Talhott
said. "It's difficult to he really
adult about it."
There are definitely variations
within and between the different
sororities, though some people
have dubbed them "arbitrary sis
terhoods."
As for competition among
the different sororities
themselves, it is s;iiJ to be
minimal. "Since we don't live to
gether. the sororities don't
develop as distinct personalities
as they do on other campuses,"
I'albott explained.
Hossfeld added. "It's .1 kind of
family ;it school, and anothei
form of continuity in an otherwise
chaotic period of our lives."

stories to blind children, as well as
donating money to our national
philanthropy."
Senior Megan Talbott. a mem
ber of Pi Beta Phi. and lnter
sorority Council rush chairman
tor 1 1 >S5. said that "sororities
here otter a lot more for people
who happened not to get every
thing they ssanted out of Residen
tial Education."
Said Widrow. "Some people
are definitely in them just tor the
social aspects, and some girls rush
simply to meet other girls. It's
scry easy to meet guss around
here. but forming close
friendships with giils is a lot
harder, especially at this age. for
some reason. Still others join
sororities because they're inter
ested in the communits service
possibilities. Most communis,
though, people do it for a combi
nation of the three."
All of the sororities generally
hold a sveekly meeting of one
kind or another, during which
they can plan for future events, or
just share each others' company.
The meetings are usually led by
the sorority's president, and all of
the other officers present infor
mal reports on their particular
concerns.

Often, the social chairman or
ganizes a formal and several
casual get-togethers with other
groups, which am member may
attend. No sorority function is
mandatory, with the exception of
Rush activities in the spring.
Allen said. "You get out of .1
sorority essentially what you put
in to it."
What distinguishes Stanford's
sororities from systems 011 most
other campuses is simply that
they exist unhoused.
"Most sorority members at
Stanford don't want housing."
Hossfeld said.
"Most of the girls don't iust
circulate within their sorority.
Rather, their sorority provides an
additional and not an exclusive
circle of friends. This is the main
difference between our system
and those at other schools. It is in
this fashion that we are able to
maintain our low-key status."
The desire not for housing,
but for a sort of "Sorority
Lodge" on campus, is fre
quently discussed among the
members ol the different
sororities, and more recency
amonu the Row directors.

"It would be really nice to have
a place on campus for meetings or
storage or whatever, just as any
club or organization likes to have
its own headquarters." Hossfeld
said.
Also differentiating Stanford
sororities from those on other
campuses in the Rush system.
According to Allen. Rush is
"obviously the worst part ol
sororities, although, from what
I've beard, it's as low kc\ as pos
sible compared to most other col
leges and universities."
"We have probably the best
system ot any school 1 know of. in
terms of pressure, and in terms ol
formality. Stanford is hardk .1
cut-throat system compared to
any big state school." lalbott
said.
Allen emphasized that "girls at
use and UCLA are suicidal
when it comes to Rush. "Widrow
added. "You live or die depend
ing on whether you get into a cer
tain sorority at many schools, es
peciallv ones where the alterna
tive housing situations are nil."
"II there were any better way
to conduct Rush, we'd do it. but
the hest aspect is that mOsi
atnone who wants to he in .

sorority can he in one," Hossfelt
said.
Talhott s;iid, "The supply ant
demand here seems to he mort
equitable than it is in most othei
systems. Obviously, there arc
going to he girls who don't gel
everything they want, hut it's easy
to make 2(1 unhapp\ girls seem
like 200."
"It is very hard during Rush to
realize what you personally want
to get out of a sorority." Talhott
said. "It's difficult to he really
adult about it."
There are definitely variations
within and between the different
sororities, though some people
have dubbed them "arbitrary sis
terhoods."
As for competition among
the different sororities
themselves, it is s;iiJ to be
minimal. "Since we don't live to
gether. the sororities don't
develop as distinct personalities
as they do on other campuses,"
I'albott explained.
Hossfeld added. "It's .1 kind of
family ;it school, and anothei
form of continuity in an otherwise
chaotic period of our lives."
