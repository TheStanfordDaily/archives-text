# Greek image: strong views from all sides

### Baie Netzer Senior staff writer 
"Sometimes I think it's just the
image that's had. / mean, someone
says they're in a fraternity and
people immediately stereotype
them. . . . It shouldn't he that way."
-Jon Payne, freshman.
Image. What Webster's New
International Dictionary defines
simply as an "impression" and,
more precisely, as "the memory
of a perception in psychology that
is modified hy subsequent experi
ence and that contains both intel
lectual and emotional elements."'
With fraternities' and
sororities' repeated appearances
in campus news this year, the in
tellectual and emotional elements
relating to the image o! these
groups have come to the fore.
Many people have voiced then
opinions on what the image ol a
Stanford fraternity or sorority
could be, should be 01 is.
Participating in this debate are
people both in fraternities and
sororities and outside those
groups. Faculty, stall members
and students all seem to lake an
active interest in the (neck sys
tem at Stanford, and their
opinions range from full-hearted
support to active opposition.
Some have formulated their
opinions since coming here, and
some come with their views
already fixed. Some have re
thought their stances, and some
will change their views depending
on the future.
I he news has covered a long
list ol events, among them a task
force investigation ol the (neck
system at Stanford, the formula
tion ol I ntci 11 a tcrnity Council
parts guidelines and the placing
on probation ol three housed or
ganizations.
I veil the eovcraee of these

events is now a part of the debate
over the image of fraterni
ties and sororities.
Diana C'onklin. the assistant
dean of student affairs and direc
tor of the Row. said the image ol
the Greek system at Stanford is
probably shaped hy the particular
houses which most often appear
in the news.
"I think there's a problem
faced by the fraternities who
don't get on to the Iront page ol
The Dailv." Conklin said. " Those
Irats who don't may not have
some of their good points shown,
and that can be frustrating."
Senior Muck Melton agreed
with Conklin and said the media
often concentrate on the "bad
parts" ol fraternities "because its
easier to sensationalize."
Ihose who publish and dis
tribute the news are also taking
an active part in the image
debate, and then impressions ol
the Greek system have appeared
intermittently in the past lew
years.
After an incident occuring at
the beta I heta Pi house earlier
this year, the I lines Tribune pub
lished an editorial criticizing em
phasis on alcohol consumption at
Stanford Iraternity parties.
In the midst ol task force activ
itv and an investigation of frater
nities and sororities, a Daily edi
torial in Mav 1 1 >N4 called lor fra
ternities to be filled through the
Draw, and reflected The Daily
editorial board's negative image
ol the housed fraternities on
campus. At the beginning ol this
school vear, a Daily editorial
surprised many people when it
called tor maintenance of the
status quo.
In earlier editorials, the Daily
criticized the self-selection
process ol fraternities. According
to the editorials. "Stanford

should not recognize any residen
tial organi/ation which uses only
social criteria to determine its
membership" and "each and
every student should share the
same right to live in any on
campus 1 esidenee."
In the wake of what some term
"had press" hy local and
campus publications, certain
members of fraternities and
sororities feel that the image
people have of their organizations
has less to do with the way they
behave than with the precon
ceived stereotypes others hold.
According to Kappa Alpha fra

ternity President Bret Sherman,
there are many people outside the
Greek system at Stanford who do
not attend fraternity functions
and yet hold stereotyped views of
fraternities.
"Even when people do go to a
party, they come with an attitude
and that skews your viewpoint,"
Sherman said. "The image we
project is not just what we try to
show, but what people think of us
stereotypically."
The president of the Sigma Al
pha Mu fraternity, Ethan Or
linsky, said he feels people apply
views based on a few fraternities
to all fraternities and sororities.
" Ull fort unately, people's
stereotypes are based on what
they hear about specific groups,"
Orlinsky said. "Not everyone
hears about the good aspects of
the majority of the fraternities."
A negative image of Stanford
fraternities and sororities may be
caused more by the actions of in
dividuals than of specific groups,
according to Kappa Alpha Psi
fraternity President Terry Jack
son. Jackson said the leaders of a
housed fraternity often do not
give individuals a strong sense of
responsibility to the fraternity.
"Some fail to realize that it
only takes one person to screw up
the name of an organization."
Jackson said.
Others feel that the living situa
tion in housed fraternities creates
attitudes and behavior that can
easily contribute to a negative
image.
Aurora Editor Karie
Youngdahl said the "artificial at
mosphere" that a housed frater
nity creates makes it very easy for
fraternity members to slip into a
"boys will be boys" way of acting.
" The world is not a group of
white, upper-middle-class boys
living together in a house and
having fun." Youngdahl said.
"That gives them a stilted view of
reality and a pervasive sense of
protection."
Youngdahl said the attitudes of
fraternity members toward
women can be "really degrad
ing." and degrading remarks are
often brushed off as jokes.
"But they obviously wouldn't
joke about Jews or blacks that
way." Youngdahl said.
Youngdahl said she considered
sororities and fraternities sepa
rately because " Irats have a lot
more influence and they are a lot
more visible."
While sophomore Steve I rout
said he supports fraternities for

the campus-wide parties they
throw, he expressed doubts aboil
certain attitudes that may appeal
within the fraternity system.
"Being in a fraternity atmoj
sphere may keep some of thus®
attitudes," Trout said.
But there are those who sa»
membership in a fraternity oj
sorority is a necessary prerc'
quisite to really appreciating all
the positive aspects of belonging
to the Greek system.
Pi Beta Phi sorority member
Katie 1 azar said her sorority is "J
group of friends that I can
turn to and trust."
"But I think maybe that peop le
who haven't experienced what it s
like have the wrong image," she
said.
Junior Andy Cohen, a member
of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity,
said people seem to like to gener
alize about Stanford fraternities
without appreciating the diversity
within them.
"If you took a cross-section of
people from fraternities, you'd
find a group of very diverse
people," Cohen said. " I here s a
lot more to fraternities than
meets the eye, and I don't think
you realize that until you're actu
ally in one."
Contrary to what some
believe, however, those
who support fraternities or
sororities are not only the mem
bers of those organizations.
Similarly, those who oppose fra
ternities or soi verities are not only
those who were rejected or
denied bids in the rush process.
The Task Force to Studv Frater
nities and Sororities at Stanlord is
composed of administrators, lac
ulty and students. Almost none o!
the recommendations issued H\
that task force last year receiveid
unanimous approval.
One of the most controversial
of those recommendations
claimed that residence in a frater
nity could not be determine;.!

Keith Light, associate director
(il admissions and adviser tor the
Stanford Sigma Chi chapter, said
maintaining the Greek system at
Stanford is a valid idea because of
the needs of Stanford students.
■•People come to Stanford with
different overall needs, not the
least of which arc simple human
relations." Light said.
Organizations pursuing a
ilieinc of camaraderie should he
encouraged and should he viewed
with that in mind, according to
Light.
l oo often people see fraterni
ties and sororities as mere social
eluhs." Light said. "At least at
Stanford. I see them as Uieme
houses with the theme being fra
ternity with a small ' F."
I lie social aspect of the frater
nities and sororities can be the
overriding impression that one
receives. One sorority member
who depledged at the beginning
o! this \ear and wishes to remain
anonvmous said that socializing
seems to be the biggest concern
for those in the groups.
"The problem I have with them
is that they all seem to have one
particular way of thinking." she
said. "Either they are like the
others or. if they're not. they will
try to conform. It's like this
•Group' is a being in itself."
Freshman Dave Harden said he
supports the Greek system at
Stanford and said the existence of
a Greek system here was one of
his considerations when choosing
a college.
••I think that fraternities play
just as important a role as other
student organizations, and I don't
see why they're constantly put
down." Harden said.
While fraternities and
sororities are obviously options
that some students want, it is not
clear that those groups pursue the
goals of Residential Education,
according to James Cadena,
director of Governors' Corner
and former assistant director of
the Row.
Cadena said his concern is
primarily with the housed frater
nities and "their lack of interest in
the goals of Res Ed," as shown by
recent behavior problems.
"Because they're associated
with a tradition of ritual and in
itiation. they limit themselves to
behavior that can be anti-social
and dangerous," Cadena said.
"We don't need that on a college
campus."
Cadena emphasized that as in
dividuals, fraternity members are
"a great bunch."
"But I feel the bad things that
happen outweigh their individual
good qualities," he said.
There is vet another contin
gent in the image debate,
composed of people who
refuse to argue over image at all
and say it's the individuals in a
house that matter.

Sophomore Meg Richman. a
"little sister for the Delta Kappa
Lpsilon fraternity, said her deci
sion to become a little sister was
not based on the image of the or
ganization.
"I'm a little sister at the Dekes
basically because I like the people
there." she said, "i wasn't really
sure about trats w hen I first came
here, but then I realized they
weren't the bad monsters that
people s;iid they were."
Donna Anderson, a former
Rush hostess for the Beta Theta Pi
fraternity, said people too often
apply their images of a group to
the individuals in that group.
"I don't support fraternities. I
don't oppose them. I attend the
fraternity functions because I
have friends in those groups." she
said.
Beta President Dennis Furlong
said the question of projecting a
particular image really does not
concern members of his group.
"We're not living to cast a
negative image, but we're not
reallv trving to east a positive
image either." Furlong said. "We
think we're a viable housing al
ternative for some people."
The issue of access to housing
on Iv compounds the problems
that fraternities present, accord
ing to art history graduate student
and gay activist Gerard Kos
kovich.
"Most fraternities foster among
their members an attitude of cal
lous indifference to gay men and
lesbians," Koskovieh said. He
called a fraternity's recent im
mitation of the George Segal
"Gay Liberation" sculpture in
White Plaza an example ot such
attitudes.
"It is inappropriate for organi
zations with such values to con
trol access to any part of the
scarce housing resources at Stan
ford." Koskovieh said.
The appeal of a different
housing situation can be one of
the more important considera
tions for some considering joining
a fraternity. Junior Ashwin
Adarkar did not join the Phi
Delta Theta fraternity until the
end of his sophomore year.
"I lived in the dorms for two
years, and I felt 1 had done every
thing you could do in the dorms."
Adarkar said. "I was looking for
new experiences, and I thought I
would be a little more indepen
dent in a frat."
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz
said the growing number of
recognized fraternities and
sororities, with only some of
those groups having access to
housing, creates a "gross in
justice."
Rebholz said there is 110 clear
rationale for deciding which
groups should have housing and
that the University does not have
the resources to house all the
recognized groups. Access to
housing should be available to

everyone, he said.
Rebholz s;iid he opposes frater
nities and sororities because ot in
itiation procedures which are ol
ten "mindless and dangerous."
" The very nature of fraternities
tends to reduce the diversity of
membership and outreach which
is deemed so important in the
University." Rehhol/ said.
For Delta Upsilon member
Ken Kolderup. the decision to
join a fraternity stemmed from
getting to know the members ot
the house.
"When you see it and you're a
freshman, your image is only of
the parties, and that's fine." Kol
derup said, "lint when you get
into Rush you see that they're a
great bunch of guys."
If the image of fraternities and
sororities at Stanford is linked
for some to the image of fra
ternities and sororities
everywhere, there arc also those
who draw both positive and
negative distinctions.
Kappa Kappa (iamma sorority
President Melinda Myers said she
supports the differences between
Stanford sororities and those at
other schools.
"I think some people come
here expecting a system like IJSC
and finding out that it's not."
M\ers said. "I personally am glad
that we can enjoy coed living and
yet also belong to a women's
group."
Norm Robinson, the associate
dean of student affairs. s;nd the
image of fraternities and
sororities varies with each group
because "each has its own reputa
tion and its own way ol doing
things."
"One thing is that here, less
than ;it other schools, it tends to
work less ;is ;i svstcm. Robinson
said. Mut this is starting to im
prove vv itli the involvement ol the
lIC. he said.
In a report issued last October.
Dean of Student Affairs .lames
l.vons mentioned an "unforeseen
development'" in the (ireek sys
tem at Stanford.
I Ins. according to the report,
was "the emergence ot groups
that have been predominantly

black and Jewish."
Steve Phillips, the chairman of
the Black Student Union, said he
believes the predominantly white
residential I vale mi ties ate in
tolerant of •'non-mainstream
people."
"There are problems in the sys
tem m that fraternities tend to be
sexist, and I don't think they tend
to promote very progressive
values." Phillips said.
The percentage of blacks
within the predominantly white
fraternities has been historically
low. according to Phillips.
"The black fraternities and
sororities provide an alternative
for the social life of the black
community, and they're also in
volved in public service, particu
larly the black sororities." Phillips
said.
Sophomore Melanie Wilt/,
president of the Alpha Kappa Al
pha sorority, said the image of all
sororities as "elitist" is not accu
rate.
"I think the image that most
people have now is more socially
oriented than service-oriented,
which isn't necessarily true." she
said.
Wilt/ said all fraternities and
sororities should aim at portray
ing an image ol public service.
For Pi Beta Phi President
Carolvn Benson, the image of a
sorority should not make the
decision to rush seem automatic.
"At Stanford, we've got a very
cohesive group, and we've got a
strong group, but it's not the only
social scene. Benson said. "It's
not obligators and I think that's
important."
Senior I rancesca I lynn said
her images of fraternities and
sororities are "quite different."
I lynn attributed the interest in
sororities to a need for women to
get together with other women.
"But I think that within frater
nities. there have been incidents
of behavior that encourage objec
tilicatioii ol and violence against
women." she said.
I lie question ol attitudes di
rected against minorities has been
a concern ol many involved in the
fraternity and sorority issue for
some time. In a 1953 policy

review of fraternities and
sororities at Stanford, the Office
of Student Affairs quoted
responses from various members
ol minority groups to questions
eo ncern ing fra te rllit ie s.
"In order to be accepted into a
fraternity, it appears necessary
for a minority to be acceptable by
Anglo standards — to be 'white
011 the inside' despite one's out
ward physical appearance. I do
not like the selective, exclusionist
attitude which the (ireek system
tends to promote." one Asian
American student was quoted as
saying.
But according to lIC President
Rick Hoskins. the (ireek system
provides opportunities for people
to become part of a closely knit
group and "just to make a lot of
friends."
"If I had to do it all over again.
I'd join a fraternity," Hoskins
said. "I've met some of the best
friends I've made in my life in a
fraternity."
Obviously, there are many
questions: Should fraternities and
sororities be recognized at Stan
ford? Should they have access to
campus housing? Should they be
filled through the Draw? Should
they place more emphasis on
public service or on the fraternal
theme?
However one feels about fra
ternities and sororities, it is likely
that the discussion on the future
of their role here will continue.
I he discussion is complex and in
volves more than just the issue of
whether fraternities and sororities
are "good" or "bad.
It is obvious too that this dis
cussion goes beyond abstract
ideologic;*! arguments and may
have a very real effect on people
at this campus. Many involved in
the discussion are fearful of let
ting the fraternity and sorority
issue become a judgment of indi
viduals in those groups rather
than of the groups as a whole. It is
at this point that those
"intellectual and emotional ele
ments" pinpointed by Webster
come into play and will continue
to act in future debates.

Donna Anderson, a former
Rush hostess for the Beta Theta Pi
fraternity, said people too often
apply their images of a group to
the individuals in that group.
"I don't support fraternities. I
don't oppose them. I attend the
fraternity functions because I
have friends in those groups." she
said.
Beta President Dennis Furlong
said the question of projecting a
particular image really does not
concern members of his group.
"We're not living to cast a
negative image, but we're not
reallv trving to east a positive
image either." Furlong said. "We
think we're a viable housing al
ternative for some people."
The issue of access to housing
on Iv compounds the problems
that fraternities present, accord
ing to art history graduate student
and gay activist Gerard Kos
kovich.
"Most fraternities foster among
their members an attitude of cal
lous indifference to gay men and
lesbians," Koskovieh said. He
called a fraternity's recent im
mitation of the George Segal
"Gay Liberation" sculpture in
White Plaza an example ot such
attitudes.
"It is inappropriate for organi
zations with such values to con
trol access to any part of the
scarce housing resources at Stan
ford." Koskovieh said.
The appeal of a different
housing situation can be one of
the more important considera
tions for some considering joining
a fraternity. Junior Ashwin
Adarkar did not join the Phi
Delta Theta fraternity until the
end of his sophomore year.
"I lived in the dorms for two
years, and I felt 1 had done every
thing you could do in the dorms."
Adarkar said. "I was looking for
new experiences, and I thought I
would be a little more indepen
dent in a frat."
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz
said the growing number of
recognized fraternities and
sororities, with only some of
those groups having access to
housing, creates a "gross in
justice."
Rebholz said there is 110 clear
rationale for deciding which
groups should have housing and
that the University does not have
the resources to house all the
recognized groups. Access to
housing should be available to

everyone, he said.
Rebholz s;iid he opposes frater
nities and sororities because ot in
itiation procedures which are ol
ten "mindless and dangerous."
" The very nature of fraternities
tends to reduce the diversity of
membership and outreach which
is deemed so important in the
University." Rehhol/ said.
For Delta Upsilon member
Ken Kolderup. the decision to
join a fraternity stemmed from
getting to know the members ot
the house.
"When you see it and you're a
freshman, your image is only of
the parties, and that's fine." Kol
derup said, "lint when you get
into Rush you see that they're a
great bunch of guys."
If the image of fraternities and
sororities at Stanford is linked
for some to the image of fra
ternities and sororities
everywhere, there arc also those
who draw both positive and
negative distinctions.
Kappa Kappa (iamma sorority
President Melinda Myers said she
supports the differences between
Stanford sororities and those at
other schools.
"I think some people come
here expecting a system like IJSC
and finding out that it's not."
M\ers said. "I personally am glad
that we can enjoy coed living and
yet also belong to a women's
group."
Norm Robinson, the associate
dean of student affairs. s;nd the
image of fraternities and
sororities varies with each group
because "each has its own reputa
tion and its own way ol doing
things."
"One thing is that here, less
than ;it other schools, it tends to
work less ;is ;i svstcm. Robinson
said. Mut this is starting to im
prove vv itli the involvement ol the
lIC. he said.
In a report issued last October.
Dean of Student Affairs .lames
l.vons mentioned an "unforeseen
development'" in the (ireek sys
tem at Stanford.
I Ins. according to the report,
was "the emergence ot groups
that have been predominantly

black and Jewish."
Steve Phillips, the chairman of
the Black Student Union, said he
believes the predominantly white
residential I vale mi ties ate in
tolerant of •'non-mainstream
people."
"There are problems in the sys
tem m that fraternities tend to be
sexist, and I don't think they tend
to promote very progressive
values." Phillips said.
The percentage of blacks
within the predominantly white
fraternities has been historically
low. according to Phillips.
"The black fraternities and
sororities provide an alternative
for the social life of the black
community, and they're also in
volved in public service, particu
larly the black sororities." Phillips
said.
Sophomore Melanie Wilt/,
president of the Alpha Kappa Al
pha sorority, said the image of all
sororities as "elitist" is not accu
rate.
"I think the image that most
people have now is more socially
oriented than service-oriented,
which isn't necessarily true." she
said.
Wilt/ said all fraternities and
sororities should aim at portray
ing an image ol public service.
For Pi Beta Phi President
Carolvn Benson, the image of a
sorority should not make the
decision to rush seem automatic.
"At Stanford, we've got a very
cohesive group, and we've got a
strong group, but it's not the only
social scene. Benson said. "It's
not obligators and I think that's
important."
Senior I rancesca I lynn said
her images of fraternities and
sororities are "quite different."
I lynn attributed the interest in
sororities to a need for women to
get together with other women.
"But I think that within frater
nities. there have been incidents
of behavior that encourage objec
tilicatioii ol and violence against
women." she said.
I lie question ol attitudes di
rected against minorities has been
a concern ol many involved in the
fraternity and sorority issue for
some time. In a 1953 policy

review of fraternities and
sororities at Stanford, the Office
of Student Affairs quoted
responses from various members
ol minority groups to questions
eo ncern ing fra te rllit ie s.
"In order to be accepted into a
fraternity, it appears necessary
for a minority to be acceptable by
Anglo standards — to be 'white
011 the inside' despite one's out
ward physical appearance. I do
not like the selective, exclusionist
attitude which the (ireek system
tends to promote." one Asian
American student was quoted as
saying.
But according to lIC President
Rick Hoskins. the (ireek system
provides opportunities for people
to become part of a closely knit
group and "just to make a lot of
friends."
"If I had to do it all over again.
I'd join a fraternity," Hoskins
said. "I've met some of the best
friends I've made in my life in a
fraternity."
Obviously, there are many
questions: Should fraternities and
sororities be recognized at Stan
ford? Should they have access to
campus housing? Should they be
filled through the Draw? Should
they place more emphasis on
public service or on the fraternal
theme?
However one feels about fra
ternities and sororities, it is likely
that the discussion on the future
of their role here will continue.
I he discussion is complex and in
volves more than just the issue of
whether fraternities and sororities
are "good" or "bad.
It is obvious too that this dis
cussion goes beyond abstract
ideologic;*! arguments and may
have a very real effect on people
at this campus. Many involved in
the discussion are fearful of let
ting the fraternity and sorority
issue become a judgment of indi
viduals in those groups rather
than of the groups as a whole. It is
at this point that those
"intellectual and emotional ele
ments" pinpointed by Webster
come into play and will continue
to act in future debates.

"Sometimes I think it's just the
image that's had. / mean, someone
says they're in a fraternity and
people immediately stereotype
them. . . . It shouldn't he that way."
-Jon Payne, freshman.
Image. What Webster's New
International Dictionary defines
simply as an "impression" and,
more precisely, as "the memory
of a perception in psychology that
is modified hy subsequent experi
ence and that contains both intel
lectual and emotional elements."'
With fraternities' and
sororities' repeated appearances
in campus news this year, the in
tellectual and emotional elements
relating to the image o! these
groups have come to the fore.
Many people have voiced then
opinions on what the image ol a
Stanford fraternity or sorority
could be, should be 01 is.
Participating in this debate are
people both in fraternities and
sororities and outside those
groups. Faculty, stall members
and students all seem to lake an
active interest in the (neck sys
tem at Stanford, and their
opinions range from full-hearted
support to active opposition.
Some have formulated their
opinions since coming here, and
some come with their views
already fixed. Some have re
thought their stances, and some
will change their views depending
on the future.
I he news has covered a long
list ol events, among them a task
force investigation ol the (neck
system at Stanford, the formula
tion ol I ntci 11 a tcrnity Council
parts guidelines and the placing
on probation ol three housed or
ganizations.
I veil the eovcraee of these

events is now a part of the debate
over the image of fraterni
ties and sororities.
Diana C'onklin. the assistant
dean of student affairs and direc
tor of the Row. said the image ol
the Greek system at Stanford is
probably shaped hy the particular
houses which most often appear
in the news.
"I think there's a problem
faced by the fraternities who
don't get on to the Iront page ol
The Dailv." Conklin said. " Those
Irats who don't may not have
some of their good points shown,
and that can be frustrating."
Senior Muck Melton agreed
with Conklin and said the media
often concentrate on the "bad
parts" ol fraternities "because its
easier to sensationalize."
Ihose who publish and dis
tribute the news are also taking
an active part in the image
debate, and then impressions ol
the Greek system have appeared
intermittently in the past lew
years.
After an incident occuring at
the beta I heta Pi house earlier
this year, the I lines Tribune pub
lished an editorial criticizing em
phasis on alcohol consumption at
Stanford Iraternity parties.
In the midst ol task force activ
itv and an investigation of frater
nities and sororities, a Daily edi
torial in Mav 1 1 >N4 called lor fra
ternities to be filled through the
Draw, and reflected The Daily
editorial board's negative image
ol the housed fraternities on
campus. At the beginning ol this
school vear, a Daily editorial
surprised many people when it
called tor maintenance of the
status quo.
In earlier editorials, the Daily
criticized the self-selection
process ol fraternities. According
to the editorials. "Stanford

should not recognize any residen
tial organi/ation which uses only
social criteria to determine its
membership" and "each and
every student should share the
same right to live in any on
campus 1 esidenee."
In the wake of what some term
"had press" hy local and
campus publications, certain
members of fraternities and
sororities feel that the image
people have of their organizations
has less to do with the way they
behave than with the precon
ceived stereotypes others hold.
According to Kappa Alpha fra

ternity President Bret Sherman,
there are many people outside the
Greek system at Stanford who do
not attend fraternity functions
and yet hold stereotyped views of
fraternities.
"Even when people do go to a
party, they come with an attitude
and that skews your viewpoint,"
Sherman said. "The image we
project is not just what we try to
show, but what people think of us
stereotypically."
The president of the Sigma Al
pha Mu fraternity, Ethan Or
linsky, said he feels people apply
views based on a few fraternities
to all fraternities and sororities.
" Ull fort unately, people's
stereotypes are based on what
they hear about specific groups,"
Orlinsky said. "Not everyone
hears about the good aspects of
the majority of the fraternities."
A negative image of Stanford
fraternities and sororities may be
caused more by the actions of in
dividuals than of specific groups,
according to Kappa Alpha Psi
fraternity President Terry Jack
son. Jackson said the leaders of a
housed fraternity often do not
give individuals a strong sense of
responsibility to the fraternity.
"Some fail to realize that it
only takes one person to screw up
the name of an organization."
Jackson said.
Others feel that the living situa
tion in housed fraternities creates
attitudes and behavior that can
easily contribute to a negative
image.
Aurora Editor Karie
Youngdahl said the "artificial at
mosphere" that a housed frater
nity creates makes it very easy for
fraternity members to slip into a
"boys will be boys" way of acting.
" The world is not a group of
white, upper-middle-class boys
living together in a house and
having fun." Youngdahl said.
"That gives them a stilted view of
reality and a pervasive sense of
protection."
Youngdahl said the attitudes of
fraternity members toward
women can be "really degrad
ing." and degrading remarks are
often brushed off as jokes.
"But they obviously wouldn't
joke about Jews or blacks that
way." Youngdahl said.
Youngdahl said she considered
sororities and fraternities sepa
rately because " Irats have a lot
more influence and they are a lot
more visible."
While sophomore Steve I rout
said he supports fraternities for

the campus-wide parties they
throw, he expressed doubts aboil
certain attitudes that may appeal
within the fraternity system.
"Being in a fraternity atmoj
sphere may keep some of thus®
attitudes," Trout said.
But there are those who sa»
membership in a fraternity oj
sorority is a necessary prerc'
quisite to really appreciating all
the positive aspects of belonging
to the Greek system.
Pi Beta Phi sorority member
Katie 1 azar said her sorority is "J
group of friends that I can
turn to and trust."
"But I think maybe that peop le
who haven't experienced what it s
like have the wrong image," she
said.
Junior Andy Cohen, a member
of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity,
said people seem to like to gener
alize about Stanford fraternities
without appreciating the diversity
within them.
"If you took a cross-section of
people from fraternities, you'd
find a group of very diverse
people," Cohen said. " I here s a
lot more to fraternities than
meets the eye, and I don't think
you realize that until you're actu
ally in one."
Contrary to what some
believe, however, those
who support fraternities or
sororities are not only the mem
bers of those organizations.
Similarly, those who oppose fra
ternities or soi verities are not only
those who were rejected or
denied bids in the rush process.
The Task Force to Studv Frater
nities and Sororities at Stanlord is
composed of administrators, lac
ulty and students. Almost none o!
the recommendations issued H\
that task force last year receiveid
unanimous approval.

Keith Light, associate director
(il admissions and adviser tor the
Stanford Sigma Chi chapter, said
maintaining the Greek system at
Stanford is a valid idea because of
the needs of Stanford students.
■•People come to Stanford with
different overall needs, not the
least of which arc simple human
relations." Light said.
Organizations pursuing a
ilieinc of camaraderie should he
encouraged and should he viewed
with that in mind, according to
Light.
l oo often people see fraterni
ties and sororities as mere social
eluhs." Light said. "At least at
Stanford. I see them as Uieme
houses with the theme being fra
ternity with a small ' F."
I lie social aspect of the frater
nities and sororities can be the
overriding impression that one
receives. One sorority member
who depledged at the beginning
o! this \ear and wishes to remain
anonvmous said that socializing
seems to be the biggest concern
for those in the groups.
"The problem I have with them
is that they all seem to have one
particular way of thinking." she
said. "Either they are like the
others or. if they're not. they will
try to conform. It's like this
•Group' is a being in itself."
Freshman Dave Harden said he
supports the Greek system at
Stanford and said the existence of
a Greek system here was one of
his considerations when choosing
a college.
••I think that fraternities play
just as important a role as other
student organizations, and I don't
see why they're constantly put
down." Harden said.
While fraternities and
sororities are obviously options
that some students want, it is not
clear that those groups pursue the
goals of Residential Education,
according to James Cadena,
director of Governors' Corner
and former assistant director of
the Row.
Cadena said his concern is
primarily with the housed frater
nities and "their lack of interest in
the goals of Res Ed," as shown by
recent behavior problems.
"Because they're associated
with a tradition of ritual and in
itiation. they limit themselves to
behavior that can be anti-social
and dangerous," Cadena said.
"We don't need that on a college
campus."
Cadena emphasized that as in
dividuals, fraternity members are
"a great bunch."
"But I feel the bad things that
happen outweigh their individual
good qualities," he said.
There is vet another contin
gent in the image debate,
composed of people who
refuse to argue over image at all
and say it's the individuals in a
house that matter.

Sophomore Meg Richman. a
"little sister for the Delta Kappa
Lpsilon fraternity, said her deci
sion to become a little sister was
not based on the image of the or
ganization.
"I'm a little sister at the Dekes
basically because I like the people
there." she said, "i wasn't really
sure about trats w hen I first came
here, but then I realized they
weren't the bad monsters that
people s;iid they were."
Donna Anderson, a former
Rush hostess for the Beta Theta Pi
fraternity, said people too often
apply their images of a group to
the individuals in that group.
"I don't support fraternities. I
don't oppose them. I attend the
fraternity functions because I
have friends in those groups." she
said.

campus. At the beginning ol this
school vear, a Daily editorial
surprised many people when it
called tor maintenance of the
status quo.
In earlier editorials, the Daily
criticized the self-selection
process ol fraternities. According
to the editorials. "Stanford

should not recognize any residen
tial organi/ation which uses only
social criteria to determine its
membership" and "each and
every student should share the
same right to live in any on
campus 1 esidenee."
In the wake of what some term
"had press" hy local and
campus publications, certain
members of fraternities and
sororities feel that the image
people have of their organizations
has less to do with the way they
behave than with the precon
ceived stereotypes others hold.
According to Kappa Alpha fra

ternity President Bret Sherman,
there are many people outside the
Greek system at Stanford who do
not attend fraternity functions
and yet hold stereotyped views of
fraternities.
"Even when people do go to a
party, they come with an attitude
and that skews your viewpoint,"
Sherman said. "The image we
project is not just what we try to
show, but what people think of us
stereotypically."
The president of the Sigma Al
pha Mu fraternity, Ethan Or
linsky, said he feels people apply
views based on a few fraternities
to all fraternities and sororities.
" Ull fort unately, people's
stereotypes are based on what
they hear about specific groups,"
Orlinsky said. "Not everyone
hears about the good aspects of
the majority of the fraternities."
A negative image of Stanford
fraternities and sororities may be
caused more by the actions of in
dividuals than of specific groups,
according to Kappa Alpha Psi
fraternity President Terry Jack
son. Jackson said the leaders of a
housed fraternity often do not
give individuals a strong sense of
responsibility to the fraternity.
"Some fail to realize that it
only takes one person to screw up
the name of an organization."
Jackson said.
Others feel that the living situa
tion in housed fraternities creates
attitudes and behavior that can
easily contribute to a negative
image.
Aurora Editor Karie
Youngdahl said the "artificial at
mosphere" that a housed frater
nity creates makes it very easy for
fraternity members to slip into a
"boys will be boys" way of acting.
" The world is not a group of
white, upper-middle-class boys
living together in a house and
having fun." Youngdahl said.
"That gives them a stilted view of
reality and a pervasive sense of
protection."
Youngdahl said the attitudes of
fraternity members toward
women can be "really degrad
ing." and degrading remarks are
often brushed off as jokes.
"But they obviously wouldn't
joke about Jews or blacks that
way." Youngdahl said.
Youngdahl said she considered
sororities and fraternities sepa
rately because " Irats have a lot
more influence and they are a lot
more visible."
While sophomore Steve I rout
said he supports fraternities for

the campus-wide parties they
throw, he expressed doubts aboil
certain attitudes that may appeal
within the fraternity system.
"Being in a fraternity atmoj
sphere may keep some of thus®
attitudes," Trout said.
But there are those who sa»
membership in a fraternity oj
sorority is a necessary prerc'
quisite to really appreciating all
the positive aspects of belonging
to the Greek system.
Pi Beta Phi sorority member
Katie 1 azar said her sorority is "J
group of friends that I can
turn to and trust."
"But I think maybe that peop le
who haven't experienced what it s
like have the wrong image," she
said.
Junior Andy Cohen, a member
of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity,
said people seem to like to gener
alize about Stanford fraternities
without appreciating the diversity
within them.
"If you took a cross-section of
people from fraternities, you'd
find a group of very diverse
people," Cohen said. " I here s a
lot more to fraternities than
meets the eye, and I don't think
you realize that until you're actu
ally in one."
Contrary to what some
believe, however, those
who support fraternities or
sororities are not only the mem
bers of those organizations.
Similarly, those who oppose fra
ternities or soi verities are not only
those who were rejected or
denied bids in the rush process.
The Task Force to Studv Frater

composed of administrators, lac

Keith Light, associate director
(il admissions and adviser tor the
Stanford Sigma Chi chapter, said
maintaining the Greek system at
Stanford is a valid idea because of
the needs of Stanford students.
■•People come to Stanford with
different overall needs, not the
least of which arc simple human
relations." Light said.
Organizations pursuing a
ilieinc of camaraderie should he
encouraged and should he viewed
with that in mind, according to
Light.
l oo often people see fraterni
ties and sororities as mere social
eluhs." Light said. "At least at
Stanford. I see them as Uieme
houses with the theme being fra
ternity with a small ' F."
I lie social aspect of the frater
nities and sororities can be the
overriding impression that one
receives. One sorority member
who depledged at the beginning
o! this \ear and wishes to remain
anonvmous said that socializing
seems to be the biggest concern
for those in the groups.
"The problem I have with them
is that they all seem to have one
particular way of thinking." she
said. "Either they are like the
others or. if they're not. they will
try to conform. It's like this
•Group' is a being in itself."
Freshman Dave Harden said he
supports the Greek system at
Stanford and said the existence of
a Greek system here was one of
his considerations when choosing
a college.
••I think that fraternities play
just as important a role as other
student organizations, and I don't
see why they're constantly put
down." Harden said.
While fraternities and
sororities are obviously options
that some students want, it is not
clear that those groups pursue the
goals of Residential Education,
according to James Cadena,
director of Governors' Corner
and former assistant director of
the Row.
Cadena said his concern is
primarily with the housed frater
nities and "their lack of interest in
the goals of Res Ed," as shown by
recent behavior problems.
"Because they're associated
with a tradition of ritual and in
itiation. they limit themselves to
behavior that can be anti-social
and dangerous," Cadena said.
"We don't need that on a college
campus."
Cadena emphasized that as in
dividuals, fraternity members are
"a great bunch."
"But I feel the bad things that
happen outweigh their individual
good qualities," he said.
There is vet another contin
gent in the image debate,
composed of people who
refuse to argue over image at all
and say it's the individuals in a
house that matter.

Sophomore Meg Richman. a
"little sister for the Delta Kappa
Lpsilon fraternity, said her deci
sion to become a little sister was
not based on the image of the or
ganization.
"I'm a little sister at the Dekes
basically because I like the people
there." she said, "i wasn't really
sure about trats w hen I first came
here, but then I realized they
weren't the bad monsters that
people s;iid they were."
Donna Anderson, a former
Rush hostess for the Beta Theta Pi
fraternity, said people too often
apply their images of a group to
the individuals in that group.
"I don't support fraternities. I
don't oppose them. I attend the
fraternity functions because I
have friends in those groups." she
said.
Beta President Dennis Furlong
said the question of projecting a
particular image really does not
concern members of his group.
"We're not living to cast a
negative image, but we're not
reallv trving to east a positive
image either." Furlong said. "We
think we're a viable housing al
ternative for some people."
The issue of access to housing
on Iv compounds the problems
that fraternities present, accord
ing to art history graduate student
and gay activist Gerard Kos
kovich.
"Most fraternities foster among
their members an attitude of cal
lous indifference to gay men and
lesbians," Koskovieh said. He
called a fraternity's recent im
mitation of the George Segal
"Gay Liberation" sculpture in
White Plaza an example ot such
attitudes.
"It is inappropriate for organi
zations with such values to con
trol access to any part of the
scarce housing resources at Stan
ford." Koskovieh said.
The appeal of a different
housing situation can be one of
the more important considera
tions for some considering joining
a fraternity. Junior Ashwin
Adarkar did not join the Phi
Delta Theta fraternity until the
end of his sophomore year.
"I lived in the dorms for two
years, and I felt 1 had done every
thing you could do in the dorms."
Adarkar said. "I was looking for
new experiences, and I thought I
would be a little more indepen
dent in a frat."
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz
said the growing number of
recognized fraternities and
sororities, with only some of
those groups having access to
housing, creates a "gross in
justice."
Rebholz said there is 110 clear
rationale for deciding which
groups should have housing and
that the University does not have
the resources to house all the
recognized groups. Access to
housing should be available to

everyone, he said.
Rebholz s;iid he opposes frater
nities and sororities because ot in
itiation procedures which are ol
ten "mindless and dangerous."
" The very nature of fraternities
tends to reduce the diversity of
membership and outreach which
is deemed so important in the
University." Rehhol/ said.
For Delta Upsilon member
Ken Kolderup. the decision to
join a fraternity stemmed from
getting to know the members ot
the house.
"When you see it and you're a
freshman, your image is only of
the parties, and that's fine." Kol
derup said, "lint when you get
into Rush you see that they're a
great bunch of guys."
If the image of fraternities and
sororities at Stanford is linked
for some to the image of fra
ternities and sororities
everywhere, there arc also those
who draw both positive and
negative distinctions.
Kappa Kappa (iamma sorority
President Melinda Myers said she
supports the differences between
Stanford sororities and those at
other schools.
"I think some people come
here expecting a system like IJSC
and finding out that it's not."
M\ers said. "I personally am glad
that we can enjoy coed living and
yet also belong to a women's
group."
Norm Robinson, the associate
dean of student affairs. s;nd the
image of fraternities and
sororities varies with each group
because "each has its own reputa
tion and its own way ol doing
things."
"One thing is that here, less
than ;it other schools, it tends to
work less ;is ;i svstcm. Robinson
said. Mut this is starting to im
prove vv itli the involvement ol the
lIC. he said.
In a report issued last October.
Dean of Student Affairs .lames
l.vons mentioned an "unforeseen
development'" in the (ireek sys
tem at Stanford.
I Ins. according to the report,
was "the emergence ot groups
that have been predominantly

black and Jewish."
Steve Phillips, the chairman of
the Black Student Union, said he
believes the predominantly white
residential I vale mi ties ate in
tolerant of •'non-mainstream
people."
"There are problems in the sys
tem m that fraternities tend to be
sexist, and I don't think they tend
to promote very progressive
values." Phillips said.
The percentage of blacks
within the predominantly white
fraternities has been historically
low. according to Phillips.
"The black fraternities and
sororities provide an alternative
for the social life of the black
community, and they're also in
volved in public service, particu
larly the black sororities." Phillips
said.
Sophomore Melanie Wilt/,
president of the Alpha Kappa Al
pha sorority, said the image of all
sororities as "elitist" is not accu
rate.
"I think the image that most
people have now is more socially
oriented than service-oriented,
which isn't necessarily true." she
said.
Wilt/ said all fraternities and
sororities should aim at portray
ing an image ol public service.
For Pi Beta Phi President
Carolvn Benson, the image of a
sorority should not make the
decision to rush seem automatic.
"At Stanford, we've got a very
cohesive group, and we've got a
strong group, but it's not the only
social scene. Benson said. "It's
not obligators and I think that's
important."
Senior I rancesca I lynn said
her images of fraternities and
sororities are "quite different."
I lynn attributed the interest in
sororities to a need for women to
get together with other women.
"But I think that within frater
nities. there have been incidents
of behavior that encourage objec
tilicatioii ol and violence against
women." she said.
I lie question ol attitudes di
rected against minorities has been
a concern ol many involved in the
fraternity and sorority issue for
some time. In a 1953 policy

review of fraternities and
sororities at Stanford, the Office
of Student Affairs quoted
responses from various members
ol minority groups to questions
eo ncern ing fra te rllit ie s.
"In order to be accepted into a
fraternity, it appears necessary
for a minority to be acceptable by
Anglo standards — to be 'white
011 the inside' despite one's out
ward physical appearance. I do
not like the selective, exclusionist
attitude which the (ireek system
tends to promote." one Asian
American student was quoted as
saying.
But according to lIC President
Rick Hoskins. the (ireek system
provides opportunities for people
to become part of a closely knit
group and "just to make a lot of
friends."
"If I had to do it all over again.
I'd join a fraternity," Hoskins
said. "I've met some of the best
friends I've made in my life in a
fraternity."
Obviously, there are many
questions: Should fraternities and
sororities be recognized at Stan
ford? Should they have access to
campus housing? Should they be
filled through the Draw? Should
they place more emphasis on
public service or on the fraternal
theme?
However one feels about fra
ternities and sororities, it is likely
that the discussion on the future
of their role here will continue.
I he discussion is complex and in
volves more than just the issue of
whether fraternities and sororities
are "good" or "bad.
It is obvious too that this dis
cussion goes beyond abstract
ideologic;*! arguments and may
have a very real effect on people
at this campus. Many involved in
the discussion are fearful of let
ting the fraternity and sorority
issue become a judgment of indi
viduals in those groups rather
than of the groups as a whole. It is
at this point that those
"intellectual and emotional ele
ments" pinpointed by Webster
come into play and will continue
to act in future debates.

"Sometimes I think it's just the
image that's had. / mean, someone
says they're in a fraternity and
people immediately stereotype
them. . . . It shouldn't he that way."
-Jon Payne, freshman.
Image. What Webster's New
International Dictionary defines
simply as an "impression" and,
more precisely, as "the memory
of a perception in psychology that
is modified hy subsequent experi
ence and that contains both intel
lectual and emotional elements."'
With fraternities' and
sororities' repeated appearances
in campus news this year, the in
tellectual and emotional elements
relating to the image o! these
groups have come to the fore.
Many people have voiced then
opinions on what the image ol a
Stanford fraternity or sorority
could be, should be 01 is.
Participating in this debate are
people both in fraternities and
sororities and outside those
groups. Faculty, stall members
and students all seem to lake an
active interest in the (neck sys
tem at Stanford, and their
opinions range from full-hearted
support to active opposition.
Some have formulated their
opinions since coming here, and
some come with their views
already fixed. Some have re
thought their stances, and some
will change their views depending
on the future.
I he news has covered a long
list ol events, among them a task
force investigation ol the (neck
system at Stanford, the formula
tion ol I ntci 11 a tcrnity Council
parts guidelines and the placing
on probation ol three housed or
ganizations.
I veil the eovcraee of these

events is now a part of the debate
over the image of fraterni
ties and sororities.
Diana C'onklin. the assistant
dean of student affairs and direc
tor of the Row. said the image ol
the Greek system at Stanford is
probably shaped hy the particular
houses which most often appear
in the news.
"I think there's a problem
faced by the fraternities who
don't get on to the Iront page ol
The Dailv." Conklin said. " Those
Irats who don't may not have
some of their good points shown,
and that can be frustrating."
Senior Muck Melton agreed
with Conklin and said the media
often concentrate on the "bad
parts" ol fraternities "because its
easier to sensationalize."
Ihose who publish and dis
tribute the news are also taking
an active part in the image
debate, and then impressions ol
the Greek system have appeared
intermittently in the past lew
years.
After an incident occuring at
the beta I heta Pi house earlier
this year, the I lines Tribune pub
lished an editorial criticizing em
phasis on alcohol consumption at
Stanford Iraternity parties.
In the midst ol task force activ
itv and an investigation of frater
nities and sororities, a Daily edi
torial in Mav 1 1 >N4 called lor fra
ternities to be filled through the
Draw, and reflected The Daily
editorial board's negative image
ol the housed fraternities on

negative distinctions.
Kappa Kappa (iamma sorority
President Melinda Myers said she
supports the differences between
Stanford sororities and those at
other schools.
"I think some people come
here expecting a system like IJSC
and finding out that it's not."
M\ers said. "I personally am glad
that we can enjoy coed living and
yet also belong to a women's
group."
Norm Robinson, the associate
dean of student affairs. s;nd the
image of fraternities and
sororities varies with each group
because "each has its own reputa
tion and its own way ol doing
things."
"One thing is that here, less
than ;it other schools, it tends to
work less ;is ;i svstcm. Robinson
said. Mut this is starting to im
prove vv itli the involvement ol the
lIC. he said.
In a report issued last October.
Dean of Student Affairs .lames
l.vons mentioned an "unforeseen
development'" in the (ireek sys
tem at Stanford.
I Ins. according to the report,
was "the emergence ot groups
that have been predominantly

black and Jewish."
Steve Phillips, the chairman of
the Black Student Union, said he
believes the predominantly white
residential I vale mi ties ate in
tolerant of •'non-mainstream
people."
"There are problems in the sys
tem m that fraternities tend to be
sexist, and I don't think they tend
to promote very progressive
values." Phillips said.
The percentage of blacks
within the predominantly white
fraternities has been historically
low. according to Phillips.
"The black fraternities and
sororities provide an alternative
for the social life of the black
community, and they're also in
volved in public service, particu
larly the black sororities." Phillips
said.
Sophomore Melanie Wilt/,
president of the Alpha Kappa Al
pha sorority, said the image of all
sororities as "elitist" is not accu
rate.
"I think the image that most
people have now is more socially
oriented than service-oriented,
which isn't necessarily true." she
said.
Wilt/ said all fraternities and
sororities should aim at portray
ing an image ol public service.
For Pi Beta Phi President
Carolvn Benson, the image of a
sorority should not make the
decision to rush seem automatic.
"At Stanford, we've got a very
cohesive group, and we've got a
strong group, but it's not the only
social scene. Benson said. "It's
not obligators and I think that's
important."
Senior I rancesca I lynn said
her images of fraternities and
sororities are "quite different."
I lynn attributed the interest in
sororities to a need for women to
get together with other women.
"But I think that within frater
nities. there have been incidents
of behavior that encourage objec
tilicatioii ol and violence against
women." she said.
I lie question ol attitudes di
rected against minorities has been
a concern ol many involved in the
fraternity and sorority issue for
some time. In a 1953 policy

review of fraternities and
sororities at Stanford, the Office
of Student Affairs quoted
responses from various members
ol minority groups to questions
eo ncern ing fra te rllit ie s.
"In order to be accepted into a
fraternity, it appears necessary
for a minority to be acceptable by
Anglo standards — to be 'white
011 the inside' despite one's out
ward physical appearance. I do
not like the selective, exclusionist
attitude which the (ireek system
tends to promote." one Asian
American student was quoted as
saying.
But according to lIC President
Rick Hoskins. the (ireek system
provides opportunities for people
to become part of a closely knit
group and "just to make a lot of
friends."
"If I had to do it all over again.
I'd join a fraternity," Hoskins
said. "I've met some of the best
friends I've made in my life in a
fraternity."
Obviously, there are many
questions: Should fraternities and
sororities be recognized at Stan
ford? Should they have access to
campus housing? Should they be
filled through the Draw? Should
they place more emphasis on
public service or on the fraternal
theme?
However one feels about fra
ternities and sororities, it is likely
that the discussion on the future
of their role here will continue.
I he discussion is complex and in
volves more than just the issue of
whether fraternities and sororities
are "good" or "bad.
It is obvious too that this dis
cussion goes beyond abstract
ideologic;*! arguments and may
have a very real effect on people
at this campus. Many involved in
the discussion are fearful of let
ting the fraternity and sorority
issue become a judgment of indi
viduals in those groups rather
than of the groups as a whole. It is
at this point that those
"intellectual and emotional ele
ments" pinpointed by Webster
come into play and will continue
to act in future debates.

"Sometimes I think it's just the

says they're in a fraternity and

-Jon Payne, freshman.
Image. What Webster's New
International Dictionary defines
simply as an "impression" and,
more precisely, as "the memory
of a perception in psychology that
is modified hy subsequent experi
ence and that contains both intel
lectual and emotional elements."'
With fraternities' and
sororities' repeated appearances
in campus news this year, the in
tellectual and emotional elements
relating to the image o! these
groups have come to the fore.
Many people have voiced then
opinions on what the image ol a
Stanford fraternity or sorority
could be, should be 01 is.
Participating in this debate are
people both in fraternities and
sororities and outside those
groups. Faculty, stall members
and students all seem to lake an
active interest in the (neck sys
tem at Stanford, and their
opinions range from full-hearted
support to active opposition.
Some have formulated their
opinions since coming here, and
some come with their views
already fixed. Some have re
thought their stances, and some
will change their views depending
on the future.
I he news has covered a long
list ol events, among them a task
force investigation ol the (neck
system at Stanford, the formula
tion ol I ntci 11 a tcrnity Council
parts guidelines and the placing
on probation ol three housed or
ganizations.
I veil the eovcraee of these

events is now a part of the debate
over the image of fraterni
ties and sororities.
Diana C'onklin. the assistant
dean of student affairs and direc
tor of the Row. said the image ol
the Greek system at Stanford is
probably shaped hy the particular
houses which most often appear
in the news.
"I think there's a problem
faced by the fraternities who
don't get on to the Iront page ol
The Dailv." Conklin said. " Those
Irats who don't may not have
some of their good points shown,
and that can be frustrating."
Senior Muck Melton agreed
with Conklin and said the media
often concentrate on the "bad
parts" ol fraternities "because its
easier to sensationalize."
Ihose who publish and dis
tribute the news are also taking
an active part in the image
debate, and then impressions ol
the Greek system have appeared
intermittently in the past lew
years.
After an incident occuring at
the beta I heta Pi house earlier
this year, the I lines Tribune pub
lished an editorial criticizing em
phasis on alcohol consumption at
Stanford Iraternity parties.
In the midst ol task force activ
itv and an investigation of frater
nities and sororities, a Daily edi
torial in Mav 1 1 >N4 called lor fra
ternities to be filled through the
Draw, and reflected The Daily
editorial board's negative image
ol the housed fraternities on
campus. At the beginning ol this
school vear, a Daily editorial
surprised many people when it
called tor maintenance of the
status quo.
In earlier editorials, the Daily
criticized the self-selection
process ol fraternities. According
to the editorials. "Stanford

should not recognize any residen
tial organi/ation which uses only
social criteria to determine its
membership" and "each and
every student should share the
same right to live in any on
campus 1 esidenee."
In the wake of what some term
"had press" hy local and
campus publications, certain
members of fraternities and
sororities feel that the image
people have of their organizations
has less to do with the way they
behave than with the precon
ceived stereotypes others hold.
According to Kappa Alpha fra

ternity President Bret Sherman,
there are many people outside the
Greek system at Stanford who do
not attend fraternity functions
and yet hold stereotyped views of
fraternities.
"Even when people do go to a
party, they come with an attitude
and that skews your viewpoint,"
Sherman said. "The image we
project is not just what we try to
show, but what people think of us
stereotypically."
The president of the Sigma Al
pha Mu fraternity, Ethan Or
linsky, said he feels people apply
views based on a few fraternities
to all fraternities and sororities.
" Ull fort unately, people's
stereotypes are based on what
they hear about specific groups,"
Orlinsky said. "Not everyone
hears about the good aspects of
the majority of the fraternities."
A negative image of Stanford
fraternities and sororities may be
caused more by the actions of in
dividuals than of specific groups,
according to Kappa Alpha Psi
fraternity President Terry Jack
son. Jackson said the leaders of a
housed fraternity often do not
give individuals a strong sense of
responsibility to the fraternity.
"Some fail to realize that it
only takes one person to screw up
the name of an organization."
Jackson said.
Others feel that the living situa
tion in housed fraternities creates
attitudes and behavior that can
easily contribute to a negative
image.
Aurora Editor Karie
Youngdahl said the "artificial at
mosphere" that a housed frater
nity creates makes it very easy for
fraternity members to slip into a
"boys will be boys" way of acting.
" The world is not a group of
white, upper-middle-class boys
living together in a house and
having fun." Youngdahl said.
"That gives them a stilted view of
reality and a pervasive sense of
protection."
Youngdahl said the attitudes of
fraternity members toward
women can be "really degrad
ing." and degrading remarks are
often brushed off as jokes.
"But they obviously wouldn't
joke about Jews or blacks that
way." Youngdahl said.
Youngdahl said she considered
sororities and fraternities sepa
rately because " Irats have a lot
more influence and they are a lot
more visible."
While sophomore Steve I rout
said he supports fraternities for

the campus-wide parties they
throw, he expressed doubts aboil
certain attitudes that may appeal
within the fraternity system.
"Being in a fraternity atmoj
sphere may keep some of thus®
attitudes," Trout said.
But there are those who sa»
membership in a fraternity oj
sorority is a necessary prerc'
quisite to really appreciating all
the positive aspects of belonging
to the Greek system.
Pi Beta Phi sorority member
Katie 1 azar said her sorority is "J
group of friends that I can
turn to and trust."
"But I think maybe that peop le
who haven't experienced what it s
like have the wrong image," she
said.
Junior Andy Cohen, a member
of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity,
said people seem to like to gener
alize about Stanford fraternities
without appreciating the diversity
within them.
"If you took a cross-section of
people from fraternities, you'd
find a group of very diverse
people," Cohen said. " I here s a
lot more to fraternities than
meets the eye, and I don't think
you realize that until you're actu
ally in one."
Contrary to what some
believe, however, those
who support fraternities or
sororities are not only the mem
bers of those organizations.
Similarly, those who oppose fra
ternities or soi verities are not only
those who were rejected or
denied bids in the rush process.
The Task Force to Studv Frater
nities and Sororities at Stanlord is
composed of administrators, lac
ulty and students. Almost none o!
the recommendations issued H\
that task force last year receiveid
unanimous approval.
One of the most controversial
of those recommendations

Keith Light, associate director
(il admissions and adviser tor the
Stanford Sigma Chi chapter, said
maintaining the Greek system at
Stanford is a valid idea because of
the needs of Stanford students.
■•People come to Stanford with
different overall needs, not the
least of which arc simple human
relations." Light said.
Organizations pursuing a
ilieinc of camaraderie should he
encouraged and should he viewed
with that in mind, according to
Light.
l oo often people see fraterni
ties and sororities as mere social
eluhs." Light said. "At least at
Stanford. I see them as Uieme
houses with the theme being fra
ternity with a small ' F."
I lie social aspect of the frater
nities and sororities can be the
overriding impression that one
receives. One sorority member
who depledged at the beginning
o! this \ear and wishes to remain
anonvmous said that socializing
seems to be the biggest concern
for those in the groups.
"The problem I have with them
is that they all seem to have one
particular way of thinking." she
said. "Either they are like the
others or. if they're not. they will
try to conform. It's like this
•Group' is a being in itself."
Freshman Dave Harden said he
supports the Greek system at
Stanford and said the existence of
a Greek system here was one of
his considerations when choosing
a college.
••I think that fraternities play
just as important a role as other
student organizations, and I don't
see why they're constantly put
down." Harden said.
While fraternities and
sororities are obviously options
that some students want, it is not
clear that those groups pursue the
goals of Residential Education,
according to James Cadena,
director of Governors' Corner
and former assistant director of
the Row.
Cadena said his concern is
primarily with the housed frater
nities and "their lack of interest in
the goals of Res Ed," as shown by
recent behavior problems.
"Because they're associated
with a tradition of ritual and in
itiation. they limit themselves to
behavior that can be anti-social
and dangerous," Cadena said.
"We don't need that on a college
campus."
Cadena emphasized that as in
dividuals, fraternity members are
"a great bunch."
"But I feel the bad things that
happen outweigh their individual
good qualities," he said.
There is vet another contin
gent in the image debate,
composed of people who
refuse to argue over image at all
and say it's the individuals in a
house that matter.

Sophomore Meg Richman. a
"little sister for the Delta Kappa
Lpsilon fraternity, said her deci
sion to become a little sister was
not based on the image of the or
ganization.
"I'm a little sister at the Dekes
basically because I like the people
there." she said, "i wasn't really
sure about trats w hen I first came
here, but then I realized they
weren't the bad monsters that
people s;iid they were."
Donna Anderson, a former
Rush hostess for the Beta Theta Pi
fraternity, said people too often
apply their images of a group to
the individuals in that group.
"I don't support fraternities. I
don't oppose them. I attend the
fraternity functions because I
have friends in those groups." she
said.
Beta President Dennis Furlong
said the question of projecting a
particular image really does not
concern members of his group.
"We're not living to cast a
negative image, but we're not
reallv trving to east a positive
image either." Furlong said. "We
think we're a viable housing al
ternative for some people."
The issue of access to housing
on Iv compounds the problems
that fraternities present, accord
ing to art history graduate student
and gay activist Gerard Kos
kovich.
"Most fraternities foster among
their members an attitude of cal
lous indifference to gay men and
lesbians," Koskovieh said. He
called a fraternity's recent im
mitation of the George Segal
"Gay Liberation" sculpture in
White Plaza an example ot such
attitudes.
"It is inappropriate for organi
zations with such values to con
trol access to any part of the
scarce housing resources at Stan
ford." Koskovieh said.
The appeal of a different
housing situation can be one of
the more important considera
tions for some considering joining
a fraternity. Junior Ashwin
Adarkar did not join the Phi
Delta Theta fraternity until the
end of his sophomore year.
"I lived in the dorms for two
years, and I felt 1 had done every
thing you could do in the dorms."
Adarkar said. "I was looking for
new experiences, and I thought I
would be a little more indepen
dent in a frat."
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz
said the growing number of
recognized fraternities and
sororities, with only some of
those groups having access to
housing, creates a "gross in
justice."
Rebholz said there is 110 clear
rationale for deciding which
groups should have housing and
that the University does not have
the resources to house all the
recognized groups. Access to
housing should be available to

everyone, he said.
Rebholz s;iid he opposes frater
nities and sororities because ot in
itiation procedures which are ol
ten "mindless and dangerous."
" The very nature of fraternities
tends to reduce the diversity of
membership and outreach which
is deemed so important in the
University." Rehhol/ said.
For Delta Upsilon member
Ken Kolderup. the decision to
join a fraternity stemmed from
getting to know the members ot
the house.
"When you see it and you're a
freshman, your image is only of
the parties, and that's fine." Kol
derup said, "lint when you get
into Rush you see that they're a
great bunch of guys."
If the image of fraternities and
sororities at Stanford is linked
for some to the image of fra
ternities and sororities
everywhere, there arc also those
who draw both positive and
negative distinctions.
Kappa Kappa (iamma sorority
President Melinda Myers said she
supports the differences between
Stanford sororities and those at
other schools.
"I think some people come
here expecting a system like IJSC

certain attitudes that may appeal
within the fraternity system.
"Being in a fraternity atmoj
sphere may keep some of thus®
attitudes," Trout said.
But there are those who sa»
membership in a fraternity oj
sorority is a necessary prerc'
quisite to really appreciating all
the positive aspects of belonging
to the Greek system.
Pi Beta Phi sorority member
Katie 1 azar said her sorority is "J
group of friends that I can
turn to and trust."
"But I think maybe that peop le
who haven't experienced what it s
like have the wrong image," she
said.
Junior Andy Cohen, a member
of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity,
said people seem to like to gener
alize about Stanford fraternities
without appreciating the diversity
within them.
"If you took a cross-section of
people from fraternities, you'd
find a group of very diverse
people," Cohen said. " I here s a
lot more to fraternities than
meets the eye, and I don't think
you realize that until you're actu
ally in one."
Contrary to what some
believe, however, those
who support fraternities or
sororities are not only the mem
bers of those organizations.
Similarly, those who oppose fra
ternities or soi verities are not only
those who were rejected or
denied bids in the rush process.

Keith Light, associate director
(il admissions and adviser tor the
Stanford Sigma Chi chapter, said
maintaining the Greek system at
Stanford is a valid idea because of
the needs of Stanford students.
■•People come to Stanford with
different overall needs, not the
least of which arc simple human
relations." Light said.
Organizations pursuing a
ilieinc of camaraderie should he
encouraged and should he viewed
with that in mind, according to
Light.
l oo often people see fraterni
ties and sororities as mere social
eluhs." Light said. "At least at
Stanford. I see them as Uieme
houses with the theme being fra
ternity with a small ' F."
I lie social aspect of the frater
nities and sororities can be the
overriding impression that one
receives. One sorority member
who depledged at the beginning
o! this \ear and wishes to remain
anonvmous said that socializing
seems to be the biggest concern
for those in the groups.
"The problem I have with them
is that they all seem to have one
particular way of thinking." she
said. "Either they are like the
others or. if they're not. they will
try to conform. It's like this
•Group' is a being in itself."
Freshman Dave Harden said he
supports the Greek system at
Stanford and said the existence of
a Greek system here was one of
his considerations when choosing
a college.
••I think that fraternities play
just as important a role as other
student organizations, and I don't
see why they're constantly put
down." Harden said.
While fraternities and
sororities are obviously options
that some students want, it is not
clear that those groups pursue the
goals of Residential Education,
according to James Cadena,
director of Governors' Corner
and former assistant director of
the Row.
Cadena said his concern is
primarily with the housed frater
nities and "their lack of interest in
the goals of Res Ed," as shown by
recent behavior problems.
"Because they're associated
with a tradition of ritual and in
itiation. they limit themselves to
behavior that can be anti-social
and dangerous," Cadena said.
"We don't need that on a college
campus."
Cadena emphasized that as in
dividuals, fraternity members are
"a great bunch."
"But I feel the bad things that
happen outweigh their individual
good qualities," he said.
There is vet another contin
gent in the image debate,
composed of people who
refuse to argue over image at all
and say it's the individuals in a
house that matter.

Sophomore Meg Richman. a
"little sister for the Delta Kappa
Lpsilon fraternity, said her deci
sion to become a little sister was
not based on the image of the or
ganization.
"I'm a little sister at the Dekes
basically because I like the people
there." she said, "i wasn't really
sure about trats w hen I first came
here, but then I realized they
weren't the bad monsters that
people s;iid they were."
Donna Anderson, a former
Rush hostess for the Beta Theta Pi
fraternity, said people too often
apply their images of a group to
the individuals in that group.
"I don't support fraternities. I
don't oppose them. I attend the
fraternity functions because I
have friends in those groups." she
said.
Beta President Dennis Furlong
said the question of projecting a
particular image really does not
concern members of his group.
"We're not living to cast a
negative image, but we're not
reallv trving to east a positive
image either." Furlong said. "We
think we're a viable housing al
ternative for some people."
The issue of access to housing
on Iv compounds the problems
that fraternities present, accord
ing to art history graduate student
and gay activist Gerard Kos
kovich.
"Most fraternities foster among
their members an attitude of cal
lous indifference to gay men and
lesbians," Koskovieh said. He
called a fraternity's recent im
mitation of the George Segal
"Gay Liberation" sculpture in
White Plaza an example ot such
attitudes.
"It is inappropriate for organi
zations with such values to con
trol access to any part of the
scarce housing resources at Stan
ford." Koskovieh said.
The appeal of a different
housing situation can be one of
the more important considera
tions for some considering joining
a fraternity. Junior Ashwin
Adarkar did not join the Phi
Delta Theta fraternity until the
end of his sophomore year.
"I lived in the dorms for two
years, and I felt 1 had done every
thing you could do in the dorms."
Adarkar said. "I was looking for
new experiences, and I thought I
would be a little more indepen
dent in a frat."
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz
said the growing number of
recognized fraternities and
sororities, with only some of
those groups having access to
housing, creates a "gross in
justice."
Rebholz said there is 110 clear
rationale for deciding which
groups should have housing and
that the University does not have
the resources to house all the
recognized groups. Access to
housing should be available to

everyone, he said.
Rebholz s;iid he opposes frater
nities and sororities because ot in
itiation procedures which are ol
ten "mindless and dangerous."
" The very nature of fraternities
tends to reduce the diversity of
membership and outreach which
is deemed so important in the
University." Rehhol/ said.
For Delta Upsilon member
Ken Kolderup. the decision to
join a fraternity stemmed from
getting to know the members ot
the house.
"When you see it and you're a
freshman, your image is only of
the parties, and that's fine." Kol
derup said, "lint when you get
into Rush you see that they're a
great bunch of guys."
If the image of fraternities and
sororities at Stanford is linked
for some to the image of fra
ternities and sororities
everywhere, there arc also those
who draw both positive and
negative distinctions.
Kappa Kappa (iamma sorority
President Melinda Myers said she
supports the differences between
Stanford sororities and those at
other schools.
"I think some people come
here expecting a system like IJSC
and finding out that it's not."
M\ers said. "I personally am glad
that we can enjoy coed living and
yet also belong to a women's
group."
Norm Robinson, the associate
dean of student affairs. s;nd the
image of fraternities and
sororities varies with each group
because "each has its own reputa
tion and its own way ol doing
things."
"One thing is that here, less
than ;it other schools, it tends to
work less ;is ;i svstcm. Robinson
said. Mut this is starting to im
prove vv itli the involvement ol the
lIC. he said.
In a report issued last October.
Dean of Student Affairs .lames
l.vons mentioned an "unforeseen
development'" in the (ireek sys
tem at Stanford.
I Ins. according to the report,
was "the emergence ot groups
that have been predominantly

black and Jewish."
Steve Phillips, the chairman of
the Black Student Union, said he
believes the predominantly white
residential I vale mi ties ate in
tolerant of •'non-mainstream
people."
"There are problems in the sys
tem m that fraternities tend to be
sexist, and I don't think they tend
to promote very progressive
values." Phillips said.
The percentage of blacks
within the predominantly white
fraternities has been historically
low. according to Phillips.
"The black fraternities and
sororities provide an alternative
for the social life of the black
community, and they're also in
volved in public service, particu
larly the black sororities." Phillips
said.
Sophomore Melanie Wilt/,
president of the Alpha Kappa Al
pha sorority, said the image of all
sororities as "elitist" is not accu
rate.
"I think the image that most
people have now is more socially
oriented than service-oriented,
which isn't necessarily true." she
said.
Wilt/ said all fraternities and
sororities should aim at portray
ing an image ol public service.
For Pi Beta Phi President
Carolvn Benson, the image of a
sorority should not make the
decision to rush seem automatic.
"At Stanford, we've got a very
cohesive group, and we've got a
strong group, but it's not the only
social scene. Benson said. "It's
not obligators and I think that's
important."
Senior I rancesca I lynn said
her images of fraternities and
sororities are "quite different."
I lynn attributed the interest in
sororities to a need for women to
get together with other women.
"But I think that within frater
nities. there have been incidents
of behavior that encourage objec
tilicatioii ol and violence against
women." she said.
I lie question ol attitudes di
rected against minorities has been
a concern ol many involved in the
fraternity and sorority issue for
some time. In a 1953 policy

review of fraternities and
sororities at Stanford, the Office
of Student Affairs quoted
responses from various members
ol minority groups to questions
eo ncern ing fra te rllit ie s.
"In order to be accepted into a
fraternity, it appears necessary
for a minority to be acceptable by
Anglo standards — to be 'white
011 the inside' despite one's out
ward physical appearance. I do
not like the selective, exclusionist
attitude which the (ireek system
tends to promote." one Asian
American student was quoted as
saying.
But according to lIC President
Rick Hoskins. the (ireek system
provides opportunities for people
to become part of a closely knit
group and "just to make a lot of
friends."
"If I had to do it all over again.
I'd join a fraternity," Hoskins
said. "I've met some of the best
friends I've made in my life in a
fraternity."
Obviously, there are many
questions: Should fraternities and
sororities be recognized at Stan
ford? Should they have access to
campus housing? Should they be
filled through the Draw? Should
they place more emphasis on
public service or on the fraternal
theme?
However one feels about fra
ternities and sororities, it is likely
that the discussion on the future
of their role here will continue.
I he discussion is complex and in
volves more than just the issue of
whether fraternities and sororities
are "good" or "bad.
It is obvious too that this dis
cussion goes beyond abstract
ideologic;*! arguments and may
have a very real effect on people
at this campus. Many involved in
the discussion are fearful of let
ting the fraternity and sorority
issue become a judgment of indi
viduals in those groups rather
than of the groups as a whole. It is
at this point that those
"intellectual and emotional ele
ments" pinpointed by Webster
come into play and will continue
to act in future debates.

"Sometimes I think it's just the
image that's had. / mean, someone
says they're in a fraternity and
people immediately stereotype
them. . . . It shouldn't he that way."
-Jon Payne, freshman.
Image. What Webster's New
International Dictionary defines
simply as an "impression" and,
more precisely, as "the memory
of a perception in psychology that
is modified hy subsequent experi
ence and that contains both intel
lectual and emotional elements."'
With fraternities' and
sororities' repeated appearances
in campus news this year, the in
tellectual and emotional elements
relating to the image o! these
groups have come to the fore.
Many people have voiced then
opinions on what the image ol a
Stanford fraternity or sorority
could be, should be 01 is.
Participating in this debate are
people both in fraternities and
sororities and outside those
groups. Faculty, stall members
and students all seem to lake an
active interest in the (neck sys
tem at Stanford, and their
opinions range from full-hearted
support to active opposition.
Some have formulated their
opinions since coming here, and
some come with their views
already fixed. Some have re
thought their stances, and some
will change their views depending
on the future.
I he news has covered a long
list ol events, among them a task
force investigation ol the (neck
system at Stanford, the formula
tion ol I ntci 11 a tcrnity Council
parts guidelines and the placing
on probation ol three housed or
ganizations.
I veil the eovcraee of these

events is now a part of the debate
over the image of fraterni
ties and sororities.
Diana C'onklin. the assistant
dean of student affairs and direc
tor of the Row. said the image ol
the Greek system at Stanford is
probably shaped hy the particular
houses which most often appear
in the news.
"I think there's a problem
faced by the fraternities who
don't get on to the Iront page ol
The Dailv." Conklin said. " Those
Irats who don't may not have
some of their good points shown,
and that can be frustrating."
Senior Muck Melton agreed
with Conklin and said the media
often concentrate on the "bad
parts" ol fraternities "because its
easier to sensationalize."
Ihose who publish and dis
tribute the news are also taking
an active part in the image
debate, and then impressions ol
the Greek system have appeared
intermittently in the past lew
years.
After an incident occuring at
the beta I heta Pi house earlier
this year, the I lines Tribune pub
lished an editorial criticizing em
phasis on alcohol consumption at
Stanford Iraternity parties.
In the midst ol task force activ
itv and an investigation of frater
nities and sororities, a Daily edi
torial in Mav 1 1 >N4 called lor fra
ternities to be filled through the
Draw, and reflected The Daily
editorial board's negative image
ol the housed fraternities on
campus. At the beginning ol this
school vear, a Daily editorial
surprised many people when it
called tor maintenance of the
status quo.
In earlier editorials, the Daily
criticized the self-selection
process ol fraternities. According
to the editorials. "Stanford

should not recognize any residen
tial organi/ation which uses only
social criteria to determine its
membership" and "each and
every student should share the
same right to live in any on
campus 1 esidenee."
In the wake of what some term
"had press" hy local and
campus publications, certain
members of fraternities and
sororities feel that the image
people have of their organizations
has less to do with the way they
behave than with the precon
ceived stereotypes others hold.
According to Kappa Alpha fra

ternity President Bret Sherman,
there are many people outside the
Greek system at Stanford who do
not attend fraternity functions
and yet hold stereotyped views of
fraternities.
"Even when people do go to a
party, they come with an attitude
and that skews your viewpoint,"
Sherman said. "The image we
project is not just what we try to
show, but what people think of us
stereotypically."
The president of the Sigma Al
pha Mu fraternity, Ethan Or
linsky, said he feels people apply
views based on a few fraternities
to all fraternities and sororities.
" Ull fort unately, people's
stereotypes are based on what
they hear about specific groups,"
Orlinsky said. "Not everyone
hears about the good aspects of
the majority of the fraternities."
A negative image of Stanford
fraternities and sororities may be
caused more by the actions of in
dividuals than of specific groups,
according to Kappa Alpha Psi
fraternity President Terry Jack
son. Jackson said the leaders of a
housed fraternity often do not
give individuals a strong sense of
responsibility to the fraternity.
"Some fail to realize that it
only takes one person to screw up
the name of an organization."
Jackson said.
Others feel that the living situa
tion in housed fraternities creates
attitudes and behavior that can
easily contribute to a negative
image.
Aurora Editor Karie
Youngdahl said the "artificial at
mosphere" that a housed frater
nity creates makes it very easy for
fraternity members to slip into a
"boys will be boys" way of acting.
" The world is not a group of
white, upper-middle-class boys
living together in a house and
having fun." Youngdahl said.
"That gives them a stilted view of
reality and a pervasive sense of
protection."
Youngdahl said the attitudes of
fraternity members toward
women can be "really degrad
ing." and degrading remarks are
often brushed off as jokes.
"But they obviously wouldn't
joke about Jews or blacks that
way." Youngdahl said.
Youngdahl said she considered
sororities and fraternities sepa
rately because " Irats have a lot
more influence and they are a lot
more visible."
While sophomore Steve I rout
said he supports fraternities for

the campus-wide parties they
throw, he expressed doubts aboil
certain attitudes that may appeal
within the fraternity system.
"Being in a fraternity atmoj

fraternity and sorority issue for
some time. In a 1953 policy

review of fraternities and
sororities at Stanford, the Office
of Student Affairs quoted
responses from various members
ol minority groups to questions
eo ncern ing fra te rllit ie s.
"In order to be accepted into a
fraternity, it appears necessary
for a minority to be acceptable by
Anglo standards — to be 'white
011 the inside' despite one's out
ward physical appearance. I do
not like the selective, exclusionist
attitude which the (ireek system
tends to promote." one Asian
American student was quoted as
saying.
But according to lIC President
Rick Hoskins. the (ireek system
provides opportunities for people
to become part of a closely knit
group and "just to make a lot of
friends."
"If I had to do it all over again.
I'd join a fraternity," Hoskins
said. "I've met some of the best
friends I've made in my life in a
fraternity."
Obviously, there are many
questions: Should fraternities and
sororities be recognized at Stan
ford? Should they have access to
campus housing? Should they be
filled through the Draw? Should
they place more emphasis on
public service or on the fraternal
theme?
However one feels about fra
ternities and sororities, it is likely
that the discussion on the future
of their role here will continue.
I he discussion is complex and in
volves more than just the issue of
whether fraternities and sororities
are "good" or "bad.
It is obvious too that this dis
cussion goes beyond abstract
ideologic;*! arguments and may
have a very real effect on people
at this campus. Many involved in
the discussion are fearful of let
ting the fraternity and sorority
issue become a judgment of indi
viduals in those groups rather
than of the groups as a whole. It is
at this point that those
"intellectual and emotional ele
ments" pinpointed by Webster
come into play and will continue
to act in future debates.
