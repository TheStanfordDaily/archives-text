# Alumni leave Stanford housing legacy
##

There is one alumnus Mike Llerandi is not likely to tor
get.
Llerandi, president of the Sigma Chis, was at a chapter
meeting and a number of alumni showed up. One
alumnus, Rik Helmke, a Sigma Chi and former member ol
the baseball team, was especially keen to show his ap
preciation to the fraternity.
"He said, 'There are only two things I'd give money to
at this university: the baseball team and Sigma Chi.' Then
he gave us $100 and told us to go buy a few kegs."
Llerandi said.
Not all alumni contribute to their fraternities, and not
all contributions are specifically aimed toward enhancing
the social life of fraternity members. Some fraternities
have closer relations with their alumni than others. One
thing, however, is clear: Many alumni look at fraternities
as having been the center of their lives while they were at
Stanford, and some turn that satisfaction into contribu
tions to their fraternities — either through time commit
ments to the fraternity or through monetary contributions
to the University or directly to the fraternity.
In some cases, these contributions can have long-lasting
effects on the University or the fraternities themselves.
• Since 1957. fraternity alumni have contributed more
than $3.1 million to housing .it Stanford, according to
Peter Svlvester, an associate director of development here.
' hese contributions have helped build 13 houses — some
of which are no longer fraternities and helped renovate
he Meta Iheta Pi. Delta Upsilon and Delta I an Delta
houses.
** Last spring, as news spread ol a task loree recommenda
tion that fraternities be open to the Draw, concerned fra
rnitv alumni flooded many chapter advisers and Univer
sity officials with phone calls and letters asking about the
decision.
• In ION 2, lund-raisers for Delta Kappa Epsilon raised
:>re than $SO,OOO from alumni to help renovate the
ownstairs of the Deke house.
• Different fraternities receive varying amounts of ini
tiated hinds from alumni. Sigma ( hi alumni contributed
lore than $2,000 last year. Phi Delta Iheta alums "less
than $200." according to Phi Delt President Ed Bendy.
• Deke alumnus Albert Hettinger, class ol D 16, contrib
ed $500,000 to a fund administered by the University,
ne interest from that fund went toward three full-tuition
holarsliips tin Dekes this year.
• Different traternity members and alumni disagree on
aether being . member of a certain fraternitv helps inl
ine one's job prospects. Most agree that the so-called
iil-bov network is not as extensive here as at main other
-"*l' llools.
According to Sylvestci 2.SIS fiatcrnity alumni contrib
uted more than S2 million toward the construction of 13
mscs Sigma \lpha I psilon. Phi Delta I heta. I heta

In order to get a tax deduction for their contributions,
ic alumni had to contribute money to the Univcrsitv.
with a preference lor a certain house I he Universit\ also
id to take over ownership of the houses.
Many alumni, therefore, see recent University discus
ions ol opening the houses to the Draw as hctraving the
i 1 list they put m the University when thev contributed
iiiuls in the late 1 l )50s.
I here s always been this undercurrent of paranoia
unong sonic ol the alumni. 1 hcv never trusted the Uni
vcrsitv.' savs Sylvester, who was an Alpha Sig when he
was a student here in the early 19505. "Now some frater
nity alumni are saying. See. I told vou so." "
The ongoing re-examination ol the fraternities' role in
housing here has rattled many alumni to the point
w here some are threatening to stop contributing to the
University.
"I've talked to a lot ol different alumni who would be
monumentally less inclined to donate money to the Uni
versity." said lames Ouillinan. the president of the
Alumni Intcrlratcrnitv Council, an alumni fund-raising
group. " I hey think that the University solicited them di
rect Iv for money, and now it's Irving to stab them in the
back by taking away their fraternities."
"I vvou.d have to rethink my relationship with the Uni
versity if it took away fraternity housing." said l ianklin
Johnson, a Beta alumnus who has contributed undisclosed
amounts of money to the University and bis fraternity
since he graduated. "I love Stanford a lot. but it would

have a gaping hole in it."
Keith Light, chapter adviser and alumnus of the Sigma
Chis and an associate director of admissions here, said
many concerned alumni have called him and said they will
probably not contribute to the University if it makes tra
te rni tics part ol the Draw.
When asked whether financial considerations should
change the Universitv's decisions on the future of fraterni
ties. Light was not as firm.
"I don't think what the alumni feel should determine
the actions of the University by any means, but on the
other hand there's a moral obligation to acknowledge the
involvement of those who have gone before." Light said.
"And there's also a practical concern: Are we going to
throw out the Universitv's ability to go oil because ol stub
born adherence to principle?"
John (iilliland. an assciate director of development,
painted a much less confrontational picture of the rela
tionship between the University and alumni.
"I have faith in the goodwill of our donors."' (iilliland
said "I" m optimistic that the way donors cv aluate the Uni
versity includes so many more factors than just fraterni
ties. Mumni will find reasons to continue support if thev
don't like individual issues."
But (iilliland was firm in saying that the University is
unlikely to change its policies based on financial consider
ations.
" I he University will not be yanked around by donors."
(iilliland said. "I've never seen it happen. We've had a lot
of controversies, and I've seen the letters, and I've seen
the threats, but it doesn't change the results."
Alumnus Albert Hettinger died in 19N3 at the age of
90. but his legacy remains in the form of three
scholarships — each offering full tuition — that
were offered to members of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fra

ternity this year.
Guillinan. s\ ho hits a major role in deciding ss ho is gisen
the scholarships. s;iitl that financial need "is not a primary
consideration" lor determining who is given the awards.
Ihe recipients are chosen on the basis ot service to the
Unisersits and the house, academics and athletics.
Senior Ted Irons, a member ot the Dekes who is one ot
the recipients ot the award this scar, said the administra
tion of the award has been especially hclptul tor members
of the house because v if you're middle class, sou kind ot

Fraternities at mans other sch help their members
in one more important ssas — . lostcring connectii is
that can often help a fraternity brother get a job later on in
life. Most people involved in fraternities here agree that
the so-called old-bos network is not as strong here as i is
at large universities in Southern states.
"The old-boss' network doesn't appear to be that strong
as far as fraternites go. And I think that's a good thing.'"
says Gilliland. "I'm not aware of people's fraternity con
nections. It means the same to me as having the same bar
ber or the same hometown."
Uerandi. the Sigma Chi president, said, "I've never
heard of anybody saying.'Yeah. I got this guy lor an inter
sievs who s\as a Sigma ("hi and he told me he'd make suie I
got the job.' And if I were in a hiring position. I di n't
think I'd let it affect me either."
Donald Galles. the president ot the Dekes. said he \x
pects things to be different for him. hosvever.
"Being in a fraternity gives you ■ I connections for
job opportunities, especially in busii ess." Galles said. "If
you're in a fraternity , it can be good for you — it turns out
that many people in fraternities arc .ot the kind of people
who you're going to have to worry a'uwt being able to deal
ss ith other people."
