# Community projects get Greek support

Frats. Sororities. The average
student immediately asks,
"Where's the party?"
However, many members of
the Greek system here feel that
their reputation for huge parties,
coupled with the recent media
concern over fraternity-related
problems, has overshadowed the
| services and contributions they
offer to the community. The
majority of Greek groups on
icampus feel that they accomplish
more within the community than
average dorms do.
"There's a real misunderstand
ing that sororities and fraternities
get together only for social
purposes. . . . The social side of
Greek groups is usually more
visible or is more often empha
sized by non-Greek members,"
said Allison Lutz, president of
Kappa Alpha Theta.
"As a whole, I feel that frater
nities and sororities currently do
most of the concerted community
work on campus," said Pierre
King of Delta Kappa Epsilon.
Lutz agreed. "In a dorm that I
was in, there was not an emphasis
on, or an interest in, doing group
service projects, whereas within
Thetas there is a real interest in
helping out the local commu
nity."
Many fraternities and sororities
initiate their pledge group into
community service by charging
them with a pledge project. But
the community projects aren't
limited to the pledges. According
to Delta Gamma President Lisa
Weiss, community service "is
part of our programming when

we make up our calendar."
But skeptics do exist.
The Pi Beta Phi sorority helps
put on Bing Nursery's annual
May carnival. "The Pi Phis have
done some work for the fair. They
help with the booths, etc.," said
Carol Youngholt, director of the
nursery. But she said she
thinks there is a lot more that
sororities and fraternities are ca
pable of doing for the numerous
child-care programs around
campus.
Pi Phi President Carolyn Ben
son agrees. "There's no doubi in
my mind that we (the Greek sys
tem) have more potential. . . po
tential that can't be denied. Un
fortunately, that hasn't been a
focus."
But there are those who feel
that the amount of community
service which fraternities and
sororities can provide is limited.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon President
John Peterson admits that there
are some "untapped resources"
in the system, but feels that one
can only do so much for the com
munity and still keep up with the
scholastic demands of college life.
"The thing we lack is time. I've
got my studies, extra-curricular
activities and athletics, as well as
an office in the house," Peterson
said. His house does work with
the Palo Alto Parks and Recrea
tion Department, the National
Collegiate Athletic Association
Volunteers for Youth and Big
Brothers, and also does some
work with convalescent homes.
Peterson feels that Stanford
students as a whole are spread a
little too thin, and when one adds
the extra time of being, in a frater

nity, it would be difficult to do
any more than they already are.
King also said he felt this way.
"Everyone has more potential to
do community work, but at Stan
ford there are a lot of time com
mitments. And there are a lot of
these commitments just being in a
fraternity or sorority, exclusive of
doing community work."
And one Greek, who wished to
remain anonymous, said, "It feels
like people say the frats and
sororities should do more com
munity work as a justification of
their existence, which I don't feel
is appropriate."
But the Delta Upsilons claim
they're making up for lost time.
The DUs' community service ties
have "lacked somewhat in the
past," admitted DU President
Mike Minchin, "but presently
there's a conscious effort ... to
improve our community relations
and awareness."
According to DU Vice Presi
dent Robert Blum, the fraternity
is planning to donate 500 hours of
work in conjunction with the
Stanford Volunteer Network, and
DUs have already begun mainte
nance work on the Gertrude
Wilks Academy in East Palo
Alto.
Many of the Greek organiza
tions have one or two pet proj
ects, along with a slew of little
ones. For the Dekes, the main
community thrust is their involve
ment with the Special Olympics.
Their smaller endeavors include

hosting a dinner for members of
the Palo Alto Senior Center every
Thanksgiving and Easter and par
ticipating in the Big Brothers pro
gram.
According to Delta Gamma
member Lisa Rolfe, the DGs
donated $2,000, raised by hold
ing a dance-a-thon, to the Office
of Disabled Student Services.
"With that money the office
was able to buy a Visualtek ma
chine that enlarges the print on
books for visually impaired stu
dents. They wouldn't have had
the funds to buy it otherwise,"
said Rolfe.
In addition, a number of proj
ects are being initiated which will
involve the Greek system as a
whole.
One of those efforts, Adopt a
School, will be starting this quar
ter, according to Rick Hoskins,
president of the Interfraternity
Council.
The school the system is
adopting is the Ravenswood
Middle School in East Palo Alto.
"It's a poor school, lacking in
facilities," Hoskins said. "We'll
be tutoring and taking over the
playgrounds."
Pi Phi Benson said she thinks
the school needs math and
reading tutors, and says working
with the children is "one way all
of us could put in a couple of
hours. That way everyone is in
volved."
Bob Hudson, a counselor at the
school, said that the tutoring will

take place after school in the
classrooms and that there will be
some Greek help with the noon
sports program. There will also be
involvement with after-school
clubs like chess, drama, com
puters, dance and art.
"We're really looking forward
to the the assistance that the stu
dents can give us with the pro
grams," Hudson said.
The other major project com
ing up that will involve the entire
Greek system is the Stanford
Charity Carnival, a benefit for the
Children's Hospital.
Laura Nelson, president of the
Intersorority Council, said she
hopes each fraternity and sorority
will be able to plan and man a
booth for the Wilbur Field event
on April 20.
"One of the problems we had
last year was getting an organized
group of volunteers, and the fra
ternities and sororities supplied
the organized groups we
needed," said Pete Sidebottom,
the director of this year's carnival.
Regardless of the original moti
vation, Sigma Chi President Mike
Llerandi said community service
offers a feeling of satisfaction to
the Greeks who participate.
"You might feel that you're
doing it to impress the people
down in Old Union, but after
wards â€” that's when you feel like
it's all worth it," Llerandi said.
"You feel good about yourself
and about the people you help. It
generates a good feeling."
