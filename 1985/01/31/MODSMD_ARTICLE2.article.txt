### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
A committee charged with submitting a recom
mendation to Residential Education on the possible
reinstatement of on-campus housing privileges for
the Zeta Psi fraternity was unable to reach a deci
sion after a two-hour meeting yesterday.
According to Paige Arnof, chairman of the Com
mittee on Services to Students-Residences (COSS-
R), the group decided to postpone making a recom
mendation until meeting again Wednesday. "We'll
continue discussing it until next week," she said.
Arnof said members of Zete Psi attended yester
day's meeting to argue why the fraternity should be
granted rights to University housing. No other
details of the meeting were released.
The Zetes' housing privileges were suspended for
three years in 1981 after a series of incidents cul
minating with the throwing of a Mills College stu
dent into a shallow pond behind the house. The
house, located at 353 Campus Drive, is now open to
all students through the University's spring Draw.
The fraternity regained University recognition
last year as an unhoused fraternity and is entitled to
use campus facilities during Rush. The Zetes peti
tioned in January to regain housing privileges, Ar
nof said.
