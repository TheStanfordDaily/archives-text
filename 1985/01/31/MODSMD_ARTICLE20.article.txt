# Battling for housing, dealing with minorities
## What lies ahead for Greeks at Stanford? 
### R. Taeza Pierce Staff writer 
Ever since the Task Force to Study Fraternities and
Sororities at Stanford issued its recommendations hist
M;i\. the future ot fraternal groups on the Farm has been
the center of campus-wide speculation and debate.
The task force recommended that the University dis
solve current fraternity housing within three vears.
"Assignment to student housing ma> not he denied based
on the subjective judgments of current or former resi
dents." the most noted statement read.
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons has said that no
final decisions will he made until the task force releases its
final report — the May recommendations are not final
and that report goes through the proper channels. I yons.
Universin President Donald kenned\ and the board of

trustees will nil he involved in the final decision on
whether the University should continue to house frateini
ties. It is likel\ that no action will he taken for at least
three years.
Until a in decision is made, a policy of I ni\eisit\ sup
port and guidance" for all fraternal groups here will hi fol
lowed. according to the task forces preliminaiy icioin
mendations. l.\ons said the I ni\ersity is seauhing foi a
fraternal affairs adviser, an administrative position de
signed to implement the • support and guidance policy hy
working close I \ with Stanford s Irateinal gioups.
This adviser is "being hired specifically to work with fra
ternities and sororities, housed and unhoused, said
Director of the Row Diana Conklin. who noted that she
expected many changes for the better. "One change will
he that the 12 housed fraternities will have an additional

source of support." She said the Row Office will continue
to advise housed groups, but stressed that the fraternal af
fairs adviser will do that more extensively.
I FC President Kick Hoskins said the University has
narrowed down the candidates to four and hopes to have
selected someone by March 1.
Until the adviser is hired. Lyons said "action is being
taken ... to support fraternal organizations and provide
appropriate guidance." by visiting the various fraternities
and engaging in an active dialogue with them about their
future and the University's expectations of them.

visit." Lyons said. "We're very near the time when the
supply of housing will be adequate for the demand for
II Stanford is going to have fraternities and
rorities. they re going to have to he as good as the Uni
■rsit\ is."
Aeeording to Lyons, it a fraternity is not distinct from
her residences or it it must continually rel\ on hoarders
fill its house, it will have a hard time justifxing its
inland for designated housing.
Lyons said he feels that "it's more important that we
lild some trust and understanding" than make an im
ediate decision on the task force recommendations.
Despite the main recent fraternity-related problems
here. Hoskins said he has hope for the future. "The
University is coming to the IFC with those proh
ms." he said. "And the IFC has gained more support
nong fraternities" as well as from the Universitv.
Hoskins said in the case of recent problems regarding
e Delta Upsilon and Phi Delta Theta fraternities, the
niversity has asked the IFC for a recommendation on
ossible disciplinary action. He said he feels good that "a
)t of the disciplining has been handed over to the IFC." a
esture of confidence he expects to recur.
"We can only take positive steps," Hoskins said. "I'm
Mt sure how many more negative steps there can be."
One such positive step, according to Hoskins. is the
FCs increasing involvement in issues of concern to both
fraternities and the greater Stanford community. He said
|e perceives a definite interest among IFC members in
hanging both the reputation and some of the less positive
ctions of fraternities.
| Greater student involvement in the IFC has enabled the
puncil to form numerous sub-committees to investigate
najor issues. Hoskins said. Some of the committees in
[lude "a committee investigating alcohol use at par
ies . . . [one] investigating sexism in fraternities . . . [one]
nvestigating the task force, a special committee inves
igating the DUs . . . and a committee to investigate the Phi
)elts and hazing in general."
Among the groups investigating the role of fraternal or
ganizations on campus is the recently established IFC/ISC
Committee on the Fraternal System at Stanford. Senior
lohn Even, of the IFC, and junior Chris Reid, of the ISC.
are heading the committee, which is composed of one
member from every fraternity and sorority on campus as
well as a few at-large members.
Even said the committee came about "not because of
iany • • • problems," but because "the system needed some
looking at so we can co-exist in a university setting." The
committee's purpose, he said, is "basically to get these
members together to talk about some of the things that
came up" since the task force recommendations came out.
Although Even acknowledges the group will be "dealing
with a lot of the same issues that the task force dealt with."
he said he hopes the committee will be able to deal with a
' broader range of subjects" because of its size and nature.
Even said he is excited and optimistic about the IFC/ISC
committee. "We've gotten very much input from some of
the task force members," in addition to support from the
administration, he said. "This is the most critical year for
fraternities and sororities."
"We're trying, through the committee, to say that, yes,
the fraternal environment is something that is a good
thing. . . . People seem to want that type of environment,"
he said, referring to the growing number of "Greeks" on
campus.
According to Hoskins. 15 percent of Stanford men are
urrently in fraternities. For sororities, he said, the
lercentage is "even higher than that."
Even said that between now and May, the committee
nil undertake a "period of researching and talking about
liese issues." By June 1. the committee will "tie ends to
ether and come up with some concrete recommendations
hat we will also present to Dean Lyons," he said.
In the last five years, both the number of recognized fra
gilities and sororities here and the number of students
fining them has increased greatly. Conklin said that since
Greek membership at Stanford has increased from
50 to approximately 1,500.

While Conklin indicated that the numbers would most
likely continue to rise, she said they would not do so in
definitely. "Eventually it has to reach a saturation point,"
she said.
C onklin noted that two groups are currently seeking or
intend to seek recognition. ' Delta Sigma Theta sorority
has not yet been able to get local autonomy," she said.
" I he hi Delt (Delta Delta Delta) sorority is planning to
apply for recognition."
C onklin ottered no indication of how long it would take
tor either group to gain recognition: The time span varies
in each case. But she said getting a letter granting local
autonomy from the national body has been the major
delay tor groups seeking recognition in the past.
Although Lyons acknowledges that the membership in
fraternities has increased, he says the "anomaly is that the
residential fraternities are not filling. |and| the rush is get
ting smaller. . . . Some are filling quite easily, but others
are struggling."
ISC President Laura Nelson said. "I see the sororitv svs
tem expanding on campus." due in part to the recent
formation of Iri Delt sorority , which has about 50 mem
bers. As to whether the number of sororit\ members
would increase in the near future. Nelson affirmed. "Oh
defi nitelv."

Nelson said she "sees sororities being more involved in
community service" in the future, "promoting women's is
sues such as rape awareness." In addition. "I see sororities
becoming more involved in career development for
women."
The issue of minorities in the fraternal system, both in
predominantly white fraternities and in the newer
predominantly black fraternities and sororities, prom
ises to assume increasing importance in the future. Ac
cording to Conklin, the latter have tot) often been ignored.
Both Hoskins and Nelson agree that the number of
minorities who opt for the traditional, predominantly
white organizations is smaller than would be desired.
"In the ISC no racial segregation is allowed," Nelson
said, "but it seems to have happened anyway." She said
she hopes to find some way to work past whatever obstacle
keeps minority women from rushing. "As a result I'd like
to see black women feel comfortable rushing sororities
that are members of the ISC." Nelson added.
"Ideally I'd like to see the (two) black sororities become
comfortable being members of the ISC." Nelson said she
realizes, however, that this may take some time, if it ever
does happen.
Hoskins also said he regrets the lack of minority partici
pation. both in individual fiats, and 111 the IFC, but he sees
definite hope for the future. One reason Hoskins cites for
a lack of involvement in the II ( ol Stanford's three
predominantly black fraternities is the existence ol a sepa
rate Pan-Hellenic Council to which each predominantly
black fraternity and sorority belongs.
But despite this separate body, "their participation in
the IFC has definitely increased." demonstrated in part by
a willingness to run for IFC offices, Hoskins said.
In the past. Hoskins said, the IFC has had problems
drawing the support of the black fraternities. "Maybe our

goals arc different," he conjectured. "That's valid."
The three black fraternities are, by nature, committed to
public service geared toward the black community, Hos
kins said. But in "what has been labeled as predominantly
white fraternities, our focus isn't racial promotion of any
kind," he said.
Hoskins said he hopes to attract more minorities to the
predominantly white fraternities in the future. "We have a
difficult time appealing to the ethnic minorities. . . . The
only thing we can do is inform them more about it." Hos
kins said he perceives "a real reluctance on the part of
minorities, partly "because of the image that has per
petuated" about "white" fraternities.
Omega Psi Phi President William Guillory said he feels
blacks tend to opt for black fraternities and sororities be
cause "they want to be part of something where they're a
majority."
"You really can't avoid being culturally diverse if you're
black," Guillory said. Joining a black fraternity offers the
chance to benefit from brotherhood or sisterhood without
having to deal with being a minority in a group situation,
he said.
"A lot of blacks feel more comfortable with other
blacks." Guillory said. Membership in a black fraterity of
fers blacks a "much more real support system," which is

"not so much a networking that you'd think of in busi
ness."' According to (iuillory. Stanford's "housed fraterni
ties don't possess those characteristics."
For many black students here, joining a black fraternal
organization is in part "a reaction to being labeled a
minority lor so long that you want to go somewhere else
and be a majority." (iuillory said.
Ci ran ted University recognition in autumn of I 983-N4,
Omega f'si Phi has yet to join the IF(\ (iuillory said he
does not foresee that happening in the near future, mainly
because the needs of his organization do not necessarily
correspond with IFC goals.
Asked why he did not join the IFC, (iuillory said, "I
haven't seen anything that's really attractive."
"When you're at an IFC meeting you feel like you're a
minority interest that has to lobby to push one goal
through. " he said. "We can accomplish most of our goals
without that. Nothing is practically to be gained from
joining the IFC at this point."
As far as membership in black fraternities goes, (iuil
lory said he feels it will remain at about 10 percent of the
black community. I lc acknowledges that there are those in
the black community who dislike black fraternities either
due to their selective nature or because they "believe that
(ireeks are a perpetuation of Western culture."
Hut he said, "In general our overall goals of community
service and social action have a pretty solid support sys
tem, I think Ihe Black Student Union reflected this
sentiment in a statement issued this year in favor of black
fraternities and sororities here.
I he bottom line for black fraternities, according to
(iuillory. is that "black (ireeks have to get together even
tually. II we don't, the IFC* will run us over. II black
(ireeks want to remain here and be organizationally pow-

erful. we've got to get together."
through bodies like the now in
active Pan-Hellenic Council.
•' I he lIC |ust isn't the place." he
said.
(iuillory said he doesn't think a
great deal of integration is likely
to take place in either the
predominantly black or white fra
ternities. "The cultural differ
ences are just there. I don't think
they should he ignored or
destroyed." he said, adding that
he doesn't mean to imply the two
groups can never work together
toward common goals.
C)f the future. Lyons said. "I
think the new and really interest
ing phenomenon is the non
residential fraternity." including
the three hlack fraternities and
five other recognized fraternities.
While unhoused fraternities
may he new to Stanford. Lyons
said they are "as old as the hills'"
at I.astern schools. "This is what
we should he paying attention to.

looking at. and trying to help . . .
out." Lyons said.
He added that he thinks this is
where the major increase in fra
ternity membership is taking
place and said he feels most of
these groups might not opt for
University housing if given the
chance.
l or Omega Psi Phi. Guillory
said this is definitely the case. In
his personal opinion. "University
housing is a hassle. It's not a good
thing for black Greeks here." he
said, because "we haven't
developed the financial base . . .
and we haven't been here long
enough. If we had a house, it
would have to be a very small
house," he said.
For one unhoused group, ob
taining (or regaining) University
housing is a primary goal. The
University suspended the resi
dential privileges of the /eta Psi
fraternity three years ago follow
ing a series of hazing charges.
According to Conklin. "they
have put in their proposal," to
have housing reinstated. She said

the Committee on Services to
Students-Residences is supposed
to make a recommendation to
Dean of Residential Education
Norm Robinson by Feb. 6. The
final decision regarding the Zete's
housing rests with Robinson,
Conklin added.
Very little about the future of
fraternities and sororities at Stan
ford is concrete. No final decision
on the status of these organiza
tions is expected to be made in
the near future.
For now. the University's ex
pressed goal is to improve the
communication and relationship
both among the various fraterni
ties and sororities and between
the groups and the University.
The decision on housing fraterni
ties will undoubtedly play a large
part in whether the University
reaches that goal.
And the way in which members
of housed fraternities conduct
themselves in the upcoming years
will undoubtedly play a large part
in whether the housing decision
turns out in their favor.

Aeeording to Lyons, it a fraternity is not distinct from

Lyons said he feels that "it's more important that we
lild some trust and understanding" than make an im
ediate decision on the task force recommendations.
Despite the main recent fraternity-related problems
here. Hoskins said he has hope for the future. "The
University is coming to the IFC with those proh
ms." he said. "And the IFC has gained more support
nong fraternities" as well as from the Universitv.
Hoskins said in the case of recent problems regarding
e Delta Upsilon and Phi Delta Theta fraternities, the
niversity has asked the IFC for a recommendation on
ossible disciplinary action. He said he feels good that "a
)t of the disciplining has been handed over to the IFC." a
esture of confidence he expects to recur.
"We can only take positive steps," Hoskins said. "I'm
Mt sure how many more negative steps there can be."
One such positive step, according to Hoskins. is the
FCs increasing involvement in issues of concern to both
fraternities and the greater Stanford community. He said
|e perceives a definite interest among IFC members in
hanging both the reputation and some of the less positive
ctions of fraternities.
| Greater student involvement in the IFC has enabled the
puncil to form numerous sub-committees to investigate
najor issues. Hoskins said. Some of the committees in
[lude "a committee investigating alcohol use at par
ies . . . [one] investigating sexism in fraternities . . . [one]
nvestigating the task force, a special committee inves
igating the DUs . . . and a committee to investigate the Phi
)elts and hazing in general."
Among the groups investigating the role of fraternal or
ganizations on campus is the recently established IFC/ISC
Committee on the Fraternal System at Stanford. Senior
lohn Even, of the IFC, and junior Chris Reid, of the ISC.
are heading the committee, which is composed of one
member from every fraternity and sorority on campus as
well as a few at-large members.
Even said the committee came about "not because of
iany • • • problems," but because "the system needed some
looking at so we can co-exist in a university setting." The
committee's purpose, he said, is "basically to get these
members together to talk about some of the things that
came up" since the task force recommendations came out.
Although Even acknowledges the group will be "dealing
with a lot of the same issues that the task force dealt with."
he said he hopes the committee will be able to deal with a
' broader range of subjects" because of its size and nature.
Even said he is excited and optimistic about the IFC/ISC
committee. "We've gotten very much input from some of
the task force members," in addition to support from the
administration, he said. "This is the most critical year for
fraternities and sororities."
"We're trying, through the committee, to say that, yes,
the fraternal environment is something that is a good
thing. . . . People seem to want that type of environment,"
he said, referring to the growing number of "Greeks" on
campus.
According to Hoskins. 15 percent of Stanford men are
urrently in fraternities. For sororities, he said, the
lercentage is "even higher than that."
Even said that between now and May, the committee
nil undertake a "period of researching and talking about
liese issues." By June 1. the committee will "tie ends to
ether and come up with some concrete recommendations
hat we will also present to Dean Lyons," he said.
In the last five years, both the number of recognized fra
gilities and sororities here and the number of students
fining them has increased greatly. Conklin said that since
Greek membership at Stanford has increased from
50 to approximately 1,500.

While Conklin indicated that the numbers would most
likely continue to rise, she said they would not do so in
definitely. "Eventually it has to reach a saturation point,"
she said.
C onklin noted that two groups are currently seeking or
intend to seek recognition. ' Delta Sigma Theta sorority
has not yet been able to get local autonomy," she said.
" I he hi Delt (Delta Delta Delta) sorority is planning to
apply for recognition."
C onklin ottered no indication of how long it would take
tor either group to gain recognition: The time span varies
in each case. But she said getting a letter granting local
autonomy from the national body has been the major
delay tor groups seeking recognition in the past.
Although Lyons acknowledges that the membership in
fraternities has increased, he says the "anomaly is that the
residential fraternities are not filling. |and| the rush is get
ting smaller. . . . Some are filling quite easily, but others
are struggling."
ISC President Laura Nelson said. "I see the sororitv svs
tem expanding on campus." due in part to the recent
formation of Iri Delt sorority , which has about 50 mem
bers. As to whether the number of sororit\ members
would increase in the near future. Nelson affirmed. "Oh
defi nitelv."

Nelson said she "sees sororities being more involved in
community service" in the future, "promoting women's is
sues such as rape awareness." In addition. "I see sororities
becoming more involved in career development for
women."
The issue of minorities in the fraternal system, both in
predominantly white fraternities and in the newer
predominantly black fraternities and sororities, prom
ises to assume increasing importance in the future. Ac
cording to Conklin, the latter have tot) often been ignored.
Both Hoskins and Nelson agree that the number of
minorities who opt for the traditional, predominantly
white organizations is smaller than would be desired.
"In the ISC no racial segregation is allowed," Nelson
said, "but it seems to have happened anyway." She said
she hopes to find some way to work past whatever obstacle
keeps minority women from rushing. "As a result I'd like
to see black women feel comfortable rushing sororities
that are members of the ISC." Nelson added.
"Ideally I'd like to see the (two) black sororities become
comfortable being members of the ISC." Nelson said she
realizes, however, that this may take some time, if it ever
does happen.
Hoskins also said he regrets the lack of minority partici
pation. both in individual fiats, and 111 the IFC, but he sees
definite hope for the future. One reason Hoskins cites for
a lack of involvement in the II ( ol Stanford's three
predominantly black fraternities is the existence ol a sepa
rate Pan-Hellenic Council to which each predominantly
black fraternity and sorority belongs.
But despite this separate body, "their participation in
the IFC has definitely increased." demonstrated in part by
a willingness to run for IFC offices, Hoskins said.
In the past. Hoskins said, the IFC has had problems
drawing the support of the black fraternities. "Maybe our

goals arc different," he conjectured. "That's valid."
The three black fraternities are, by nature, committed to
public service geared toward the black community, Hos
kins said. But in "what has been labeled as predominantly
white fraternities, our focus isn't racial promotion of any
kind," he said.
Hoskins said he hopes to attract more minorities to the
predominantly white fraternities in the future. "We have a
difficult time appealing to the ethnic minorities. . . . The
only thing we can do is inform them more about it." Hos
kins said he perceives "a real reluctance on the part of
minorities, partly "because of the image that has per
petuated" about "white" fraternities.
Omega Psi Phi President William Guillory said he feels
blacks tend to opt for black fraternities and sororities be
cause "they want to be part of something where they're a
majority."
"You really can't avoid being culturally diverse if you're
black," Guillory said. Joining a black fraternity offers the
chance to benefit from brotherhood or sisterhood without
having to deal with being a minority in a group situation,
he said.
"A lot of blacks feel more comfortable with other
blacks." Guillory said. Membership in a black fraterity of
fers blacks a "much more real support system," which is

"not so much a networking that you'd think of in busi
ness."' According to (iuillory. Stanford's "housed fraterni
ties don't possess those characteristics."
For many black students here, joining a black fraternal
organization is in part "a reaction to being labeled a
minority lor so long that you want to go somewhere else
and be a majority." (iuillory said.

Omega f'si Phi has yet to join the IF(\ (iuillory said he
does not foresee that happening in the near future, mainly
because the needs of his organization do not necessarily
correspond with IFC goals.
Asked why he did not join the IFC, (iuillory said, "I
haven't seen anything that's really attractive."
"When you're at an IFC meeting you feel like you're a
minority interest that has to lobby to push one goal
through. " he said. "We can accomplish most of our goals
without that. Nothing is practically to be gained from
joining the IFC at this point."
As far as membership in black fraternities goes, (iuil
lory said he feels it will remain at about 10 percent of the
black community. I lc acknowledges that there are those in
the black community who dislike black fraternities either
due to their selective nature or because they "believe that

where the major increase in fra
ternity membership is taking

these groups might not opt for

chance.
l or Omega Psi Phi. Guillory
said this is definitely the case. In
his personal opinion. "University
housing is a hassle. It's not a good
thing for black Greeks here." he
said, because "we haven't
developed the financial base . . .
and we haven't been here long
enough. If we had a house, it
would have to be a very small
house," he said.
For one unhoused group, ob
taining (or regaining) University
housing is a primary goal. The
University suspended the resi
dential privileges of the /eta Psi
fraternity three years ago follow
ing a series of hazing charges.
According to Conklin. "they

have housing reinstated. She said

the Committee on Services to
Students-Residences is supposed
to make a recommendation to
Dean of Residential Education
Norm Robinson by Feb. 6. The
final decision regarding the Zete's
housing rests with Robinson,
Conklin added.
Very little about the future of
fraternities and sororities at Stan
ford is concrete. No final decision
on the status of these organiza
tions is expected to be made in
the near future.
For now. the University's ex
pressed goal is to improve the
communication and relationship
both among the various fraterni
ties and sororities and between
the groups and the University.
The decision on housing fraterni
ties will undoubtedly play a large
part in whether the University
reaches that goal.
And the way in which members
of housed fraternities conduct
themselves in the upcoming years
will undoubtedly play a large part
in whether the housing decision
turns out in their favor.
Ever since the Task Force to Study Fraternities and

Lyons said he feels that "it's more important that we
lild some trust and understanding" than make an im
ediate decision on the task force recommendations.
Despite the main recent fraternity-related problems
here. Hoskins said he has hope for the future. "The
University is coming to the IFC with those proh
ms." he said. "And the IFC has gained more support
nong fraternities" as well as from the Universitv.
Hoskins said in the case of recent problems regarding
e Delta Upsilon and Phi Delta Theta fraternities, the
niversity has asked the IFC for a recommendation on
ossible disciplinary action. He said he feels good that "a
)t of the disciplining has been handed over to the IFC." a
esture of confidence he expects to recur.
"We can only take positive steps," Hoskins said. "I'm
Mt sure how many more negative steps there can be."
One such positive step, according to Hoskins. is the
FCs increasing involvement in issues of concern to both
fraternities and the greater Stanford community. He said
|e perceives a definite interest among IFC members in
hanging both the reputation and some of the less positive
ctions of fraternities.
| Greater student involvement in the IFC has enabled the
puncil to form numerous sub-committees to investigate
najor issues. Hoskins said. Some of the committees in
[lude "a committee investigating alcohol use at par
ies . . . [one] investigating sexism in fraternities . . . [one]
nvestigating the task force, a special committee inves
igating the DUs . . . and a committee to investigate the Phi
)elts and hazing in general."
Among the groups investigating the role of fraternal or
ganizations on campus is the recently established IFC/ISC
Committee on the Fraternal System at Stanford. Senior
lohn Even, of the IFC, and junior Chris Reid, of the ISC.
are heading the committee, which is composed of one
member from every fraternity and sorority on campus as
well as a few at-large members.
Even said the committee came about "not because of
iany • • • problems," but because "the system needed some
looking at so we can co-exist in a university setting." The
committee's purpose, he said, is "basically to get these
members together to talk about some of the things that
came up" since the task force recommendations came out.
Although Even acknowledges the group will be "dealing
with a lot of the same issues that the task force dealt with."
he said he hopes the committee will be able to deal with a
' broader range of subjects" because of its size and nature.
Even said he is excited and optimistic about the IFC/ISC
committee. "We've gotten very much input from some of
the task force members," in addition to support from the
administration, he said. "This is the most critical year for
fraternities and sororities."
"We're trying, through the committee, to say that, yes,
the fraternal environment is something that is a good
thing. . . . People seem to want that type of environment,"
he said, referring to the growing number of "Greeks" on
campus.
According to Hoskins. 15 percent of Stanford men are
urrently in fraternities. For sororities, he said, the
lercentage is "even higher than that."
Even said that between now and May, the committee
nil undertake a "period of researching and talking about
liese issues." By June 1. the committee will "tie ends to
ether and come up with some concrete recommendations
hat we will also present to Dean Lyons," he said.
In the last five years, both the number of recognized fra
gilities and sororities here and the number of students
fining them has increased greatly. Conklin said that since
Greek membership at Stanford has increased from
50 to approximately 1,500.

While Conklin indicated that the numbers would most
likely continue to rise, she said they would not do so in
definitely. "Eventually it has to reach a saturation point,"
she said.
C onklin noted that two groups are currently seeking or
intend to seek recognition. ' Delta Sigma Theta sorority
has not yet been able to get local autonomy," she said.
" I he hi Delt (Delta Delta Delta) sorority is planning to
apply for recognition."
C onklin ottered no indication of how long it would take
tor either group to gain recognition: The time span varies
in each case. But she said getting a letter granting local
autonomy from the national body has been the major
delay tor groups seeking recognition in the past.
Although Lyons acknowledges that the membership in
fraternities has increased, he says the "anomaly is that the
residential fraternities are not filling. |and| the rush is get
ting smaller. . . . Some are filling quite easily, but others
are struggling."
ISC President Laura Nelson said. "I see the sororitv svs
tem expanding on campus." due in part to the recent
formation of Iri Delt sorority , which has about 50 mem
bers. As to whether the number of sororit\ members
would increase in the near future. Nelson affirmed. "Oh
defi nitelv."

Nelson said she "sees sororities being more involved in
community service" in the future, "promoting women's is
sues such as rape awareness." In addition. "I see sororities
becoming more involved in career development for
women."
The issue of minorities in the fraternal system, both in
predominantly white fraternities and in the newer
predominantly black fraternities and sororities, prom
ises to assume increasing importance in the future. Ac
cording to Conklin, the latter have tot) often been ignored.
Both Hoskins and Nelson agree that the number of
minorities who opt for the traditional, predominantly
white organizations is smaller than would be desired.
"In the ISC no racial segregation is allowed," Nelson
said, "but it seems to have happened anyway." She said
she hopes to find some way to work past whatever obstacle
keeps minority women from rushing. "As a result I'd like
to see black women feel comfortable rushing sororities
that are members of the ISC." Nelson added.
"Ideally I'd like to see the (two) black sororities become
comfortable being members of the ISC." Nelson said she
realizes, however, that this may take some time, if it ever
does happen.
Hoskins also said he regrets the lack of minority partici
pation. both in individual fiats, and 111 the IFC, but he sees
definite hope for the future. One reason Hoskins cites for
a lack of involvement in the II ( ol Stanford's three
predominantly black fraternities is the existence ol a sepa
rate Pan-Hellenic Council to which each predominantly
black fraternity and sorority belongs.
But despite this separate body, "their participation in
the IFC has definitely increased." demonstrated in part by
a willingness to run for IFC offices, Hoskins said.
In the past. Hoskins said, the IFC has had problems
drawing the support of the black fraternities. "Maybe our

goals arc different," he conjectured. "That's valid."
The three black fraternities are, by nature, committed to
public service geared toward the black community, Hos
kins said. But in "what has been labeled as predominantly
white fraternities, our focus isn't racial promotion of any
kind," he said.
Hoskins said he hopes to attract more minorities to the
predominantly white fraternities in the future. "We have a
difficult time appealing to the ethnic minorities. . . . The
only thing we can do is inform them more about it." Hos
kins said he perceives "a real reluctance on the part of
minorities, partly "because of the image that has per
petuated" about "white" fraternities.
Omega Psi Phi President William Guillory said he feels
blacks tend to opt for black fraternities and sororities be
cause "they want to be part of something where they're a
majority."
"You really can't avoid being culturally diverse if you're
black," Guillory said. Joining a black fraternity offers the
chance to benefit from brotherhood or sisterhood without
having to deal with being a minority in a group situation,
he said.
"A lot of blacks feel more comfortable with other
blacks." Guillory said. Membership in a black fraterity of
fers blacks a "much more real support system," which is

"not so much a networking that you'd think of in busi
ness."' According to (iuillory. Stanford's "housed fraterni
ties don't possess those characteristics."
For many black students here, joining a black fraternal
organization is in part "a reaction to being labeled a
minority lor so long that you want to go somewhere else
and be a majority." (iuillory said.
Ci ran ted University recognition in autumn of I 983-N4,
Omega f'si Phi has yet to join the IF(\ (iuillory said he
does not foresee that happening in the near future, mainly
because the needs of his organization do not necessarily
correspond with IFC goals.
Asked why he did not join the IFC, (iuillory said, "I
haven't seen anything that's really attractive."
"When you're at an IFC meeting you feel like you're a
minority interest that has to lobby to push one goal
through. " he said. "We can accomplish most of our goals
without that. Nothing is practically to be gained from
joining the IFC at this point."
As far as membership in black fraternities goes, (iuil
lory said he feels it will remain at about 10 percent of the
black community. I lc acknowledges that there are those in
the black community who dislike black fraternities either
due to their selective nature or because they "believe that
(ireeks are a perpetuation of Western culture."

He added that he thinks this is
where the major increase in fra

these groups might not opt for

chance.
l or Omega Psi Phi. Guillory
said this is definitely the case. In
his personal opinion. "University
housing is a hassle. It's not a good
thing for black Greeks here." he
said, because "we haven't
developed the financial base . . .
and we haven't been here long
enough. If we had a house, it
would have to be a very small
house," he said.
For one unhoused group, ob
taining (or regaining) University
housing is a primary goal. The
University suspended the resi
dential privileges of the /eta Psi

ing a series of hazing charges.
According to Conklin. "they

have housing reinstated. She said

the Committee on Services to
Students-Residences is supposed
to make a recommendation to
Dean of Residential Education
Norm Robinson by Feb. 6. The
final decision regarding the Zete's
housing rests with Robinson,
Conklin added.
Very little about the future of
fraternities and sororities at Stan
ford is concrete. No final decision
on the status of these organiza
tions is expected to be made in
the near future.
For now. the University's ex
pressed goal is to improve the
communication and relationship
both among the various fraterni
ties and sororities and between
the groups and the University.
The decision on housing fraterni
ties will undoubtedly play a large
part in whether the University
reaches that goal.
And the way in which members
of housed fraternities conduct
themselves in the upcoming years
will undoubtedly play a large part
in whether the housing decision
turns out in their favor.
Ever since the Task Force to Study Fraternities and
Sororities at Stanford issued its recommendations hist

ies . . . [one] investigating sexism in fraternities . . . [one]
nvestigating the task force, a special committee inves
igating the DUs . . . and a committee to investigate the Phi
)elts and hazing in general."
Among the groups investigating the role of fraternal or
ganizations on campus is the recently established IFC/ISC
Committee on the Fraternal System at Stanford. Senior
lohn Even, of the IFC, and junior Chris Reid, of the ISC.
are heading the committee, which is composed of one
member from every fraternity and sorority on campus as
well as a few at-large members.
Even said the committee came about "not because of
iany • • • problems," but because "the system needed some
looking at so we can co-exist in a university setting." The
committee's purpose, he said, is "basically to get these
members together to talk about some of the things that
came up" since the task force recommendations came out.
Although Even acknowledges the group will be "dealing
with a lot of the same issues that the task force dealt with."
he said he hopes the committee will be able to deal with a
' broader range of subjects" because of its size and nature.
Even said he is excited and optimistic about the IFC/ISC
committee. "We've gotten very much input from some of
the task force members," in addition to support from the
administration, he said. "This is the most critical year for
fraternities and sororities."
"We're trying, through the committee, to say that, yes,
the fraternal environment is something that is a good
thing. . . . People seem to want that type of environment,"
he said, referring to the growing number of "Greeks" on
campus.
According to Hoskins. 15 percent of Stanford men are
urrently in fraternities. For sororities, he said, the
lercentage is "even higher than that."
Even said that between now and May, the committee
nil undertake a "period of researching and talking about
liese issues." By June 1. the committee will "tie ends to
ether and come up with some concrete recommendations
hat we will also present to Dean Lyons," he said.
In the last five years, both the number of recognized fra
gilities and sororities here and the number of students
fining them has increased greatly. Conklin said that since
Greek membership at Stanford has increased from
50 to approximately 1,500.

While Conklin indicated that the numbers would most
likely continue to rise, she said they would not do so in
definitely. "Eventually it has to reach a saturation point,"
she said.
C onklin noted that two groups are currently seeking or
intend to seek recognition. ' Delta Sigma Theta sorority
has not yet been able to get local autonomy," she said.
" I he hi Delt (Delta Delta Delta) sorority is planning to
apply for recognition."
C onklin ottered no indication of how long it would take
tor either group to gain recognition: The time span varies
in each case. But she said getting a letter granting local
autonomy from the national body has been the major
delay tor groups seeking recognition in the past.
Although Lyons acknowledges that the membership in
fraternities has increased, he says the "anomaly is that the
residential fraternities are not filling. |and| the rush is get
ting smaller. . . . Some are filling quite easily, but others
are struggling."
ISC President Laura Nelson said. "I see the sororitv svs
tem expanding on campus." due in part to the recent
formation of Iri Delt sorority , which has about 50 mem
bers. As to whether the number of sororit\ members
would increase in the near future. Nelson affirmed. "Oh
defi nitelv."

Nelson said she "sees sororities being more involved in
community service" in the future, "promoting women's is
sues such as rape awareness." In addition. "I see sororities
becoming more involved in career development for
women."
The issue of minorities in the fraternal system, both in
predominantly white fraternities and in the newer
predominantly black fraternities and sororities, prom
ises to assume increasing importance in the future. Ac
cording to Conklin, the latter have tot) often been ignored.
Both Hoskins and Nelson agree that the number of
minorities who opt for the traditional, predominantly
white organizations is smaller than would be desired.
"In the ISC no racial segregation is allowed," Nelson
said, "but it seems to have happened anyway." She said
she hopes to find some way to work past whatever obstacle
keeps minority women from rushing. "As a result I'd like
to see black women feel comfortable rushing sororities
that are members of the ISC." Nelson added.
"Ideally I'd like to see the (two) black sororities become
comfortable being members of the ISC." Nelson said she
realizes, however, that this may take some time, if it ever
does happen.
Hoskins also said he regrets the lack of minority partici
pation. both in individual fiats, and 111 the IFC, but he sees
definite hope for the future. One reason Hoskins cites for
a lack of involvement in the II ( ol Stanford's three
predominantly black fraternities is the existence ol a sepa
rate Pan-Hellenic Council to which each predominantly
black fraternity and sorority belongs.
But despite this separate body, "their participation in
the IFC has definitely increased." demonstrated in part by
a willingness to run for IFC offices, Hoskins said.
In the past. Hoskins said, the IFC has had problems
drawing the support of the black fraternities. "Maybe our

goals arc different," he conjectured. "That's valid."
The three black fraternities are, by nature, committed to
public service geared toward the black community, Hos
kins said. But in "what has been labeled as predominantly
white fraternities, our focus isn't racial promotion of any
kind," he said.
Hoskins said he hopes to attract more minorities to the
predominantly white fraternities in the future. "We have a
difficult time appealing to the ethnic minorities. . . . The
only thing we can do is inform them more about it." Hos
kins said he perceives "a real reluctance on the part of
minorities, partly "because of the image that has per
petuated" about "white" fraternities.
Omega Psi Phi President William Guillory said he feels
blacks tend to opt for black fraternities and sororities be
cause "they want to be part of something where they're a
majority."
"You really can't avoid being culturally diverse if you're
black," Guillory said. Joining a black fraternity offers the
chance to benefit from brotherhood or sisterhood without
having to deal with being a minority in a group situation,
he said.
"A lot of blacks feel more comfortable with other
blacks." Guillory said. Membership in a black fraterity of
fers blacks a "much more real support system," which is

"not so much a networking that you'd think of in busi
ness."' According to (iuillory. Stanford's "housed fraterni
ties don't possess those characteristics."
For many black students here, joining a black fraternal
organization is in part "a reaction to being labeled a
minority lor so long that you want to go somewhere else
and be a majority." (iuillory said.
Ci ran ted University recognition in autumn of I 983-N4,
Omega f'si Phi has yet to join the IF(\ (iuillory said he
does not foresee that happening in the near future, mainly
because the needs of his organization do not necessarily
correspond with IFC goals.
Asked why he did not join the IFC, (iuillory said, "I
haven't seen anything that's really attractive."
"When you're at an IFC meeting you feel like you're a
minority interest that has to lobby to push one goal
through. " he said. "We can accomplish most of our goals
without that. Nothing is practically to be gained from
joining the IFC at this point."
As far as membership in black fraternities goes, (iuil
lory said he feels it will remain at about 10 percent of the
black community. I lc acknowledges that there are those in
the black community who dislike black fraternities either
due to their selective nature or because they "believe that
(ireeks are a perpetuation of Western culture."

he doesn't mean to imply the two
groups can never work together

C)f the future. Lyons said. "I

the three hlack fraternities and
five other recognized fraternities.

said they are "as old as the hills'"

He added that he thinks this is
where the major increase in fra
ternity membership is taking
place and said he feels most of
these groups might not opt for
University housing if given the
chance.
l or Omega Psi Phi. Guillory
said this is definitely the case. In
his personal opinion. "University
housing is a hassle. It's not a good
thing for black Greeks here." he
said, because "we haven't
developed the financial base . . .
and we haven't been here long
enough. If we had a house, it
would have to be a very small
house," he said.
For one unhoused group, ob
taining (or regaining) University
housing is a primary goal. The
University suspended the resi
dential privileges of the /eta Psi
fraternity three years ago follow
ing a series of hazing charges.
According to Conklin. "they
have put in their proposal," to
have housing reinstated. She said

the Committee on Services to
Students-Residences is supposed
to make a recommendation to
Dean of Residential Education
Norm Robinson by Feb. 6. The
final decision regarding the Zete's
housing rests with Robinson,
Conklin added.
Very little about the future of
fraternities and sororities at Stan
ford is concrete. No final decision
on the status of these organiza
tions is expected to be made in
the near future.
For now. the University's ex
pressed goal is to improve the
communication and relationship
both among the various fraterni
ties and sororities and between
the groups and the University.
The decision on housing fraterni
ties will undoubtedly play a large
part in whether the University
reaches that goal.
And the way in which members
of housed fraternities conduct
themselves in the upcoming years
will undoubtedly play a large part
in whether the housing decision
turns out in their favor.
Ever since the Task Force to Study Fraternities and
Sororities at Stanford issued its recommendations hist
M;i\. the future ot fraternal groups on the Farm has been
the center of campus-wide speculation and debate.
The task force recommended that the University dis
solve current fraternity housing within three vears.
"Assignment to student housing ma> not he denied based
on the subjective judgments of current or former resi
dents." the most noted statement read.
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons has said that no
final decisions will he made until the task force releases its
final report — the May recommendations are not final
and that report goes through the proper channels. I yons.
Universin President Donald kenned\ and the board of

trustees will nil he involved in the final decision on
whether the University should continue to house frateini
ties. It is likel\ that no action will he taken for at least
three years.
Until a in decision is made, a policy of I ni\eisit\ sup

mendations. l.\ons said the I ni\ersity is seauhing foi a
fraternal affairs adviser, an administrative position de
signed to implement the • support and guidance policy hy
working close I \ with Stanford s Irateinal gioups.
This adviser is "being hired specifically to work with fra
ternities and sororities, housed and unhoused, said
Director of the Row Diana Conklin. who noted that she
expected many changes for the better. "One change will
he that the 12 housed fraternities will have an additional

source of support." She said the Row Office will continue
to advise housed groups, but stressed that the fraternal af
fairs adviser will do that more extensively.
I FC President Kick Hoskins said the University has
narrowed down the candidates to four and hopes to have
selected someone by March 1.
Until the adviser is hired. Lyons said "action is being
taken ... to support fraternal organizations and provide
appropriate guidance." by visiting the various fraternities
and engaging in an active dialogue with them about their
future and the University's expectations of them.

■rsit\ is."
Aeeording to Lyons, it a fraternity is not distinct from
her residences or it it must continually rel\ on hoarders
fill its house, it will have a hard time justifxing its
inland for designated housing.
Lyons said he feels that "it's more important that we
lild some trust and understanding" than make an im
ediate decision on the task force recommendations.
Despite the main recent fraternity-related problems
here. Hoskins said he has hope for the future. "The
University is coming to the IFC with those proh
ms." he said. "And the IFC has gained more support
nong fraternities" as well as from the Universitv.
Hoskins said in the case of recent problems regarding
e Delta Upsilon and Phi Delta Theta fraternities, the
niversity has asked the IFC for a recommendation on
ossible disciplinary action. He said he feels good that "a
)t of the disciplining has been handed over to the IFC." a
esture of confidence he expects to recur.
"We can only take positive steps," Hoskins said. "I'm
Mt sure how many more negative steps there can be."
One such positive step, according to Hoskins. is the
FCs increasing involvement in issues of concern to both
fraternities and the greater Stanford community. He said
|e perceives a definite interest among IFC members in
hanging both the reputation and some of the less positive
ctions of fraternities.
| Greater student involvement in the IFC has enabled the
puncil to form numerous sub-committees to investigate
najor issues. Hoskins said. Some of the committees in
[lude "a committee investigating alcohol use at par
ies . . . [one] investigating sexism in fraternities . . . [one]
