# Greeks elsewhere describe different values in system
## 
### Jason Cole Daily staff 
At some universities, Greek
life is the central form of student
social life and is actively sup
ported by school administrations.
At other universities, school ad
ministrations have found Greek
life objectionable and have either
banned Greek life altogether or
have applied stringent rules re
garding the structure of the sys
tem.
At some universities, Greeks
and non-Greeks interact. At an
other university, the dichotomy is
so large that one non-Greek
reportedly watched with glee as a
fraternity house burned down.
In fact, the very essence of
what Greek systems are — a so
cial environment for people —
may by the only thing that is com
mon among every fraternity and
sorority. From university to uni
versity, differences and
similarities between the Greek
systems can be found depending
on the issue being discussed.
Traditionally, fraternities arc
where alcohol and parties
are supposed to be found on
campus. In the November issue of
Newsweek On Campus, the mag
azine conducted a poll of the
functions of fraternities and
sororities. When given a list of
possible functions and asked to
rank those functions, "giving
parties" was named by more
people (38 percent) than any
other category.
At Dartmouth College tradi
tion holds. According to junior
Mark Weiss, "People here like to
drink. . . . There's not much else
to do in Hanover. We don't have
the nightlife available."
Fraternities have become the
center of social life at Dartmouth
for both Greeks and non-Greeks.
Beth Meenan. president of the
Pan-Hellenic Council (equivalent
to Stanford's lntersorority Coun
cil) at Dartmouth, explained, "A
lot of the social life is through the
fraternities."
On weekends, according to
Weiss and Interfraternity Council
President Geoffrey Michel, many
of the students go party hopping
from one fraternity to another.
"There's a lot of wanton behavior
that characterizes social life
here," Weiss said.
As a result, Dartmouth has
developed a reputation that may
over-emphasize the drinking.
Stories of a high alcoholism rate
seem to be common when
Dartmouth is mentioned. "An
unfair amount of the publicity
that Dartmouth gets seems to

revolve around the social life
here. We're not still in the
'Animal House' days, but that's
what it seems like," Weiss said.
The Dartmouth administration
and Greek system have been
taking steps to change the image
that has developed in recent
years. In 1978, the Dartmouth
faculty voted to eliminate all fra
ternities. The vote was non
binding, but the point was clear
that something had to change.
The college now conducts dry
Rush and has recently instituted
party monitors. Monitoring of
parties begins this weekend and
will be carried out by members of
the host fraternity. These
monitors are supposed to remain
sober to look out for the par
ty-goers. If the monitors see some
one who is too inebriated, Michel
explained, they are supposed to
make sure that he or she doesn't
receive more alcohol.
Attitudes have also been
changing, slowly but surely.
"There's more of an emphasis on
the drinking problem here," Mi
chel said. "Each house has alcohol
counseling on a regular basis."
Dartmouth's treatment of its
situation runs along the lines of
what is happening in other parts
of the country. At the University
of Southern California, Rush is
also dry and has been that way for
five years. The idea behind dry
Rush is that potential pledges
should get "an honest look at
look at what the house is all about
and not just get involved in a
drunken party," a USC fraternity
member said.
At California State University
at Northridge. the Greek system
is the only social activity available
for most students. According to
Sigma Alpha Mu President Ken
Dinerman, "No one is giving the
kind of huge parties that the fra
ternities can."
The National Interfraternity
Conference passed a resolution in
1983 calling for the "lawful and
responsible use of alcohol." Ac
cording to NIC Director Bob
Marchesoni, "With some states
raising the drinking age, we rec
ognize that fraternities should
take more responsibility for
what's going on."
Marchesoni said that part of
the changes that fraternities must
make are entirely image oriented.
Specifically, he said that fraterni
ties should discontinue having
beer companies sponsor parties,
because it promotes an image that
the national conference is trying
to change. "Fraternities are the
targets of beer company market

ing. Sometimes these companies
try to promote an "Animal House'
image."
Whether or not fraternities are
providing the alcohol, it wouldn't
seem to make a difference in the
total consumption. In the
Newsweek On Campus poll, stu
dents were asked if they thought
there would be less drinking if
fraternities and sororities did not
exist and the "No" vote outnum
bered the "Yes" vote by more
than a 3-to-1 ratio.
Charity work and donations
are a mainstay of Greek
life, but much of the time it
seems to get pushed to the back
ground by the emphasis on social
life. "The press doesn't talk about
the charity work and
philanthropy work we do," said
David Palmer. USC's IPC Rush
president. He indicated that
problems with hazing or fights
tend to obscure civic service.
According to the Newsweek
On Campus poll, the civic service
function of fraternities and
sororities came in a distant third
(14 percent) in what students
thought Greeks did. Conversely,
most students (44 percent)
thought that civic service should
be the Greek systems top priority.
At USC, each Greek house, in
cluding 28 fraternities and 13
sororities, has its own
philanthropy. Palmer estimated
that each house takes in $5,000
each year for its own individual
philanthropy. Along with individ
ual philanthropies, the USC
Greek system raises another
$55,000 between the Songfest
and Greek Week combined.
At the University of Texas at
Austin, the amounts of money the
Greek system raises for charity
and the amounts of money Greek
alumni donate to the university
are incalculable. When junior Be
cky Nevers, a reporter for The
Daily Texan who has covered the
Greek system extensively, was
asked if the figures could be in the
millions of dollars she said, "I
don't know exactly, but I
wouldn't doubt it."
A study conducted by the NIC
determined that nearly $7 million
in philanthropic donations and
another million hours of work is
given by fraternities alone.
"At my fraternity [the hazing]
sucked and I was scared. But it
created a bond of friendship
that's very strong. . . . [At some
other fraternities] sometimes it's
some kind of outlet for maso
chists," explained Alan Malinak, a
sophomore at Texas and member
of the Delta Tau Delta fraternity.

Malinak's statement
typifies the general
misunderstanding of
hazing. People who go through
being hazed tend to value the ex
perience as something creating a
bond of friendship, while non-
Greeks tend to become outraged
at the thought of being doused
with beer or forced to do calis
thenics for seemingly endless
hours.
But no matter who you may be,
some hazing seems to go beyond
what anyone can accept, Greek or
not, as Malinak's statement
points out.
Levels of hazing tend to differ
from university to university. At
Dartmouth, much of the problem
revolves around forcing pledges
to drink excessively, according to
both Weiss and Michel. "Our
most recent problem involved
some pledges who had to do a
sort of obstacle course. They got
over by the Connecticut River
and crossed it. They ended up in
another town . . . and got into
some trouble when they went into
somebody's garage. It was cold,
but they should have been super
vised."
Dartmouth, like many other
colleges, has taken an anti-hazing
stand. According to Newsweek
On Campus, 16 states now have
anti-hazing legislation.
That kind of legislation has
been endorsed by organizations
like NIC, but with some reserva
tions. According to Marchesoni,
"We want to see that hazing legis
lation takes a general or broad
viewpoint and not just becomes a
piece of anti-fraternity legisla
tion."
Marchesoni's point is that
hazing is done by many organiza
tions — not just fraternities. His
point may be correct, considering
that the worst recent case of
hazing came out of Texas A & M,
where a ROTC cadet was killed
after doing extensive exercise.
The cadet had collapsed once, but
was forced to do more running,
Marchesoni said.
The death of the cadet has evi
dently disturbed residents of
nearby Austin, where, according
to Texas IFC President Scott
Polikov, "The administration and
the fraternities alike have been
talking about it and trying to
come to some understanding of
what w.e have to do."
At Texas, the Sigma Alpha Ep
silon chapter was recently put on
probation by the school and
suspended by its national organi
zation after a hazing instance in
which a pledge had to be taken to
the hospital. He had suffered
muscle tears in his legs and arms
after having done extensive calis
thenics.
But even muscle tears, proba
tion and suspension may not be
enough to break what may be

traditional hazing tactics at Texas.
According to Nevers, who
spent three-and-a-half months
with another reporter doing re
search on fraternities, all but
about five or six of Texas' 27 fra
ternities haze in one way or
another.
Calisthenics is the most popular
method, but the use of cattle
prods is not unusual. A cattle
prod gives out an electrical shock
equivalent to a pinch.
"Sometimes [the actives] will
take the pledges out to some
body's ranch and give them 45
minutes to move all the rocks,
make them do push ups in which
they land on their chest and use a
cattle prod on them, too," Nevers
said.
In the worst case that she men
tioned, two or three fraternities
have been known to use some
thing called the "Queen Bee." A
coil is hooked up to a car battery
and a tube is attached to the coil.
When the battery is turned on, it
emits a blue "flame" or light.
The tube is run up one leg,
across the buttocks and down the
other leg. "If you flinch when
they turn it on, they do it again,"
Nevers said. "It's not so much the
pain, but the blue light is
supposed to be very scary."
Texas may be a microcosm of
the worst, though most fraterni
ties don't reveal their hazing
practices, even if they no longer
perform hazing. Administrators
who put chapters on probation
are also unwilling to talk about
much in the way of specifics.
At Amherst College, Asst.
Dean of Students Irwin Nuss
baum declined to talk about any
specific reason for the board of
trustees decision to kick all frater
nities out of Amherst. He merely
said there were "all kinds of inap
propriate acts, both physical and
psychological, that did not belong
at Amherst."
Finally, at USC, Palmer said
that both the fraternities and the
administration were "very against
hazing." He also said that "hazing
has gone down considerably," al
though he wouldn't mention any
specifics.
Another student at USC des
cribed the problem as very minor.
"At my fraternity, we have
lineups that stress brotherhood
and unity. A pledge is asked a
question and if he gets it wrong,
everybody has to do 20 pushups,"
he said.
Among the other fraternities at
USC, most of the hazing revolves
around drinking. Several years
ago, according to the student, one
fraternity was placed on proba
tion for making pledges jump off
a single-story building
blindfolded and having others
catch them. Since then, most
chapters have been sticking to the
idea of no hazing.
