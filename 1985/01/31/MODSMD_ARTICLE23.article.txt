for having ignored racial

Despite these landmark deei
lions and despite the tact that
lurrently more than 12 percent of
men housed in fraternities are
minorities (according to a study
Hone in 1983). Sigma Chi and
many of the other houses here
hear the stigma of racial prejudice
and segregation.
•"It bothers me that there are
people out therj with a prejudice
towards frats and Sigma Chi in
particular." said Mike Llerandi,
president of Sigma Chi. "I don't
see discrimination here. I try to
dispel [the belief that fraternities
are prejudiced] every chance I
Nonetheless, the negative
image still pervades the campus,
and the bad reputation continues
to color the opinions of many stu-
One of the most common
t beliefs is that fraternities and

sororities today attempt to hide
their prejudices behind a few
token minority men and women.
•• Frats try to have at least one
minority." said a black student
who depledged a major housed
fraternity. He wished to remain
anonymous. "People don't want
to appear prejudiced, even it they
are." he said.
But to many of the black mem
bers of predominantly white fra
ternities and sororities, the belief
in tokenism is unfounded.

"That's total BS." said Tique
Robinson, a black Sigma Chi.
"You judge people by if they're
going to be an asset to the
house."
"There's not a whole lot of
minority representation in frats.
so it's easy to say.'Hey. they jlist
took one.' but that's just specula
tion." said Steve Stanford, a black
member of Sigma Alpha Kpsilon.
For Stanford, whose father was in
a black fraternity in college, the
SAEs were a logical choice, and
he does not believe that he was
chosen on account of his race. "I
knew a lot of the guys in the
house through crew. I don't see a
reason to isolate myself racially."
a\s for racial prejudice, the un
derlying tenet of tokenism. Stan
ford said he has not experienced
it in the house either.
"If you're looking for preju
dice. it's easy to find it." Stanford
said. "I don't feel it exists. I
haven't felt any. I guess I would
be accused of being unaware."

One fraternity that has
seemingly beaten the
claims of prejudice and
tokenism is Theta Delta Chi. This
year, approximately 10 of the 50
members in the house are
minorities, or about 20 percent.
Although traditionally composed
to a large extent of athletes, no
one is really sure why Theta Delts
have had more success attracting
minority members than other
houses.
Despite the numbers, there are
still those who believe that preju
dice is prevalent in the Greek sys
tem.
"Some frats seem to exemplify
prejudice." said David Porter,
treasurer of Alpha Phi Alpha,
one of the three black fraternities
at Stanford. "Once you're in. it
perpetuates itself. Some frats
don't even care." He said that
sometimes during hell week a fra
ternity will "do up" a pledge
paint him — and send him over to
Ujamaa. "Some frats. they do
tend tti be more overt, more ob
vious."
"Most people in frats come
from a background where they've
never been questioned." said the
black ex-fraternity member.
"They've lived in posh, protected
environments. I'hey blatantly dis
eard people."
After living in the fraternity
house for a year, this student said
he realized that he really didn't
belong.
He said he feels that one of the
main reasons blacks generally do
