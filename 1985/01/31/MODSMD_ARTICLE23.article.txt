Spvas deemed extreme. Both

for having ignored racial

Despite these landmark deei
lions and despite the tact that
lurrently more than 12 percent of
men housed in fraternities are
minorities (according to a study
Hone in 1983). Sigma Chi and
many of the other houses here
hear the stigma of racial prejudice
and segregation.
•"It bothers me that there are
people out therj with a prejudice
towards frats and Sigma Chi in
particular." said Mike Llerandi,
president of Sigma Chi. "I don't
see discrimination here. I try to
dispel [the belief that fraternities
are prejudiced] every chance I
Nonetheless, the negative
image still pervades the campus,
and the bad reputation continues
to color the opinions of many stu-
One of the most common
t beliefs is that fraternities and

sororities today attempt to hide
their prejudices behind a few
token minority men and women.
•• Frats try to have at least one
minority." said a black student
who depledged a major housed
fraternity. He wished to remain
anonymous. "People don't want
to appear prejudiced, even it they
are." he said.
But to many of the black mem
bers of predominantly white fra
ternities and sororities, the belief
in tokenism is unfounded.
/
"That's total BS." said Tique
Robinson, a black Sigma Chi.
"You judge people by if they're
going to be an asset to the
house."
"There's not a whole lot of
minority representation in frats.
so it's easy to say.'Hey. they jlist
took one.' but that's just specula
tion." said Steve Stanford, a black
member of Sigma Alpha Kpsilon.
For Stanford, whose father was in
a black fraternity in college, the
SAEs were a logical choice, and
he does not believe that he was
chosen on account of his race. "I
knew a lot of the guys in the
house through crew. I don't see a
reason to isolate myself racially."
a\s for racial prejudice, the un
derlying tenet of tokenism. Stan
ford said he has not experienced
it in the house either.
"If you're looking for preju
dice. it's easy to find it." Stanford
said. "I don't feel it exists. I
haven't felt any. I guess I would
be accused of being unaware."

One fraternity that has
seemingly beaten the
claims of prejudice and
tokenism is Theta Delta Chi. This
year, approximately 10 of the 50
members in the house are
minorities, or about 20 percent.
Although traditionally composed
to a large extent of athletes, no
one is really sure why Theta Delts
have had more success attracting
minority members than other
houses.
Despite the numbers, there are
still those who believe that preju
dice is prevalent in the Greek sys
tem.
"Some frats seem to exemplify
prejudice." said David Porter,
treasurer of Alpha Phi Alpha,
one of the three black fraternities
at Stanford. "Once you're in. it
perpetuates itself. Some frats
don't even care." He said that
sometimes during hell week a fra
ternity will "do up" a pledge
paint him — and send him over to
Ujamaa. "Some frats. they do
tend tti be more overt, more ob
vious."
"Most people in frats come
from a background where they've
never been questioned." said the
black ex-fraternity member.
"They've lived in posh, protected
environments. I'hey blatantly dis
eard people."
After living in the fraternity
house for a year, this student said
he realized that he really didn't
belong.
He said he feels that one of the
main reasons blacks generally do

not join the mainstream fraterni
ties — and wh) he felt he did not
fit in — was an inherent differ
ence in culture.
"Black students don't realk
want to be in fraternities. The)'re
not exposed in their upbringing
(to drinking, large parties, etc.).
It's a two-wa) street — a lack of
interest on the part of the blacks
and a lack of things in common."
While he found that "some of
the people were racist and closed
minded on politics, religion, anv
thing." he said he does not feel
his experience in the house was a
complete failure.
"I made some friends." he said.
"It was an educational experi
ence."
He said he plans to join a black
fraternit) in the spring.
Much of the belief that frater
nities and sororities are
prejudiced stems from the stance
once taken bv the national frater
nal organizations such as the anti
black and anti-Semitic rules which
governed the Sigma C'his as
recently as the late '60s.
"In the past, there have been
some very ugly overtones." said
Llerandi. But he feels that the
remains of the prejudiced atti
tudes have been "fairlv
eliminated here. That's an atti
tude carried over at state

schools."
Llcrandi also attributed the
reputation to the stereotypes
created In television and in the
movies, especialh those depicting
larger state schools.
"When I came to Stanford. I
had a bias based on what I had
heard from friends." he said.
"There's an unbelievable differ
ence (here). At other campuses,
there's a gung-ho. blind following
of national leadership. Here, the
focus is on the house and Shin
ford.
"There are a lot more social
rifts there (at state schools).
Minorities almost don't exist
there," sail! Llcrandi.
But some members of black
fraternities and sororities don't
see the racial situation in the
Greek s\stem here quite as opti

"Everything is sort of
segregated a little." said Debbie

recognized black sororit).
"Ideally, it would be great if we
could blend together, but you're
never going to forget who you
are. Somebody is always going to
remind you."
"Frats look for minorities who
don't act like true minorities, who
are assimilated in mannerisms or
beliefs." said the ex-frat member.
"Most blacks in frats are pretend
ing to he white and prefer not to
acknowledge that they are differ
ent in manv ways."

Not all the perceived differ
ences between the two
groups have had negative
effects, however. One of the most
positive results has been an in
creased awareness on the part of
the housed Greeks.
"We have a big problem at
tracting minorities, but the trend
is changing." said Hoskins. "We
really try to (raise awareness)
during and before rush. We go to

dorms like Ujamaa and Casa
/apata — dorms with an ethnic
theme — and tell them about
I rats. We're not just a bunch of
w hi te boys."
One of the main problems in
attracting minorities is the im
pression that the major sororities
and fraternities are not commit
ted enough to the ideals impor
tant to minorities.
"Their whole system is differ

ent. Theirs is like joining a club,"
said Boutte. "Ours is a lifetime
commitment: you always identify
with them. We really are sisters.
The bond remains."
"The sorority addresses our
culture. Boutte said. "They
really stressed education, seeing
blacks overcome oppression.
"Phat really pumped me up about

the sorority, the support from a
background that you can identity
with when you're trying to help
someone out. We need some type
of support group."
"There's much more concern
about each individual. We look
out tor each other more." said
Kick Kieketts. assistant treausure
ol Kappa Alpha Psi. another
black fraternity. He explained
that the Rush process for the black
fraternities is generally much
more intense than at most of the
housed frats and helps to build
stronger, longer-lasting ties,
while the predominantly white
frats have parties and drinking
games which occur over a one-to
two-week period, it is not unusual
for the black organizations to
have rush for as many as seven or
eight weeks, he said. One of the
most popular and visible black
rush activities is lining, where
everyone has to walk in step in a
straight line, dressed identically.
"We're closer than other
frats." Ricketts said. "There's
more brotherhood."
In addition to the differences in
rush practices and cohesion,
main blacks feel that the housed

fraternities and traditional
sororities are too socially ori
ented. with not enough emphasis
on service.
Aware of the differing focus.
Hoskins and the IFC are also at
tempting to bridge the gap be
tween the goals ot the two groups.
"We don't necessarily provide
the t\pe ot activities that they
(minorities) might want to
partake in. They're looking to
strengthen the black commu
nity." Hoskins said. "We have
tried to partake in activities in
\ol\inn minorities."
