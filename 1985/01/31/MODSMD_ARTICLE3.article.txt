"Change in the educational
system is intimately related to
politics," the editor of the World
Affairs Report said in a panel dis
cussion on education held here
yesterday.
Ronald Hilton, emeritus pro
fessor of humanities special pro
grams, was joined in the discus
sion at CERAS by Emil Sarpa of
Intel, an expert in East Asia, and
two education doctoral students
here, Eduardo Navas from
Guatemala and Suleman Sumra
from Tanzania.
Hilton opened the panel by dis
cussing the changes and attitudes
inherent in the Soviet Union, em
phasizing the influence of the
communist ideology and the
belief in the rule of the party on
teachers and students. But he

said, "There are changes taking
place in the Soviet Union that are
similar to those ocurring in the
U.S. now.
"What is happening is that
they (the Soviets) are trying to
make education more practical,
to increase discipline and to fit
people on the job market."
Similar changes are also occur
ring in the Far East, according to
Sarpa. Japan's technological
breakthrough has signaled a new
way to look at education for
countries such as Korea and the
People's Republic of China.
"Negotiations between the
Chinese and the United States in
the technological field have had a
tremendous impulse," he said.
"China is using technology as a
manner to leap forward."
He said China is developing a

Japanese-Chinese-American ex
perimental university that will
follow the U.S. model of educa
tion.
"This technological revolution
has swept the Far East," he said.
"Even Taiwan is 'waking up.'
The development of the educa
tional system in Tanzania has
been very different, according to
Sumra. Dramatic changes have
taken place in the poor, mostly
rural country since the state took
complete control of education
and "education became free at all
levels." Sumra noted that the new
government's attitude "to
prepare for the realities in Tan
zania" became "education for self
reliance."
"This brought to the country an
agricultural bias which would
train people in the technical

fields" and led a few years later to
a policy that introduced
"universal primary education"
that, due to poor conditions and
scarce resources, has been diffi
cult to implement.
"Tanzania's total budget for
education is less than this univer
sity's," he said.
The situation in Guatemala is
even worse, according to Navas.
"The Guatemalan educational
system is undergoing the most
serious economic and political
crisis of all its history," he said.
"There is a deadly confrontation
between political groups which
has had a tremendous impact on
the educational system at the
elementary, secondary and uni
versity level."
The link between the students
and the political system has tradi

tional/y been strong but the
results have been tragic, Navas
said. "The university has become
identified as the center of subver
sion and communism. In the con
frontation between the govern
ment, the army and the students
more than 200 professors and
50,000 students have been mur
dered."
He said violence has had dra
matic consequences for the
thousands of low-income young
people who seek a university
degree and find themselves
caught in a deadly political battle
with the government. "I don't see
any solutions in the near future.
These problems are not just
Guatemalan problems. There are
other social forces playing a
major role in deciding the future
of Guatemala."
