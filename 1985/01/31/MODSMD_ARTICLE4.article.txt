### INDRA SEHDEV Staff writer 
Changed attitudes on "both sides of the
fraternity fence" are the key to solving
disputes over Stanford fraternities, accord
ing to Kappa Alpha President Bret Sher
man.
Sherman was one of nine panelists who
spoke at a discussion forum on housing for
fraternities and sororities at Dinkelspiel
Auditorium yesterday afternoon. About
40 people attended the forum, which was
sponsored by the Stanford Undergraduate
Student Association.
The fraternities "tend to feel that the
University is out to get us. Because of this
attitude, we're not cooperating, Sherman
said.
However, he added, "The University is
committed to seeing us through this mess.
Before the problem can be solved, fra
ternity members must develop the attitude
that improvement is necessary. Sherman
said.
Sherman added that because the reckless
actions of "one guy in one house" can

cause the whole fraternity system to be
"out," there needs to be better leadership
"within the system." There must be mem
bers in each house who know what is hap
pening and make an effort to control it.
On the other side of the fraternity fence,
"The attitudes of non-members need to
change," Sherman said.
"People need to know that a fraternity
party is not a license to get wild and tear
things up. It is up to us (the fraternity
members) to stress this to the community
at large. You cannot have the attitude that
the fraternity's an 'Animal House.' It's
hard for us to get away when the commu
nity at large thinks this."
Noel Hanrahan, a member of the Gay
and Lesbian Alliance at Stanford, also dis
cussed the need for changes in attitude.
However, she approached the issue from a
different perspective.
Alluding to a recent letter to The Daily
from Associate Director of Admissions
Keith Light, Hanrahan said, "It doesn't

Gerard Koskovich, nother member of
the Gay and Lesbia liance at Stanford,
began his speech witti comments on the
merits of the diversi being "one of the
great things about <nford University."
Me said the goal oi K ential Education is
to "overcome view ," and promote di
versity.
Every year dormiK ;es invite gays and
lesbians to speak to residents, and they
support "at least one activity during Gay-

Lesbian Week," Koskovich said. "I have
known dozens of gays who have managed
to live in dorms. In dorms the problems of
homophobia can be dealt with quickly and
reasonably. Frats, on the whole, are an ex
ception to this recognized value of residen
tial education."
Angela Spurlock, a member of Alpha
Kappa Alpha, addressed the issue of diver
sity.
"I feel I am almost a victim of diversity,"
she said. People have a need to "be around
people they have chosen to be around."
On the specific issue of housing, Spur
lock said, "We're concerned about who
would have to leave for us to come in."
Spurlock suggested that having a lodge
in which sororities and fraternities could
hold social functions and meetings would
be a viable option to housing.
Sigma Chi President Mike Llerandi
spoke after Spurlock. He began with a
direct address to Hanrahan. "I am sorry
that you have the perspective you have, es
pecially to the article that Keith wrote.
You're not understanding what it is to be in

a fraternity. You have no idea what it's like
to live there."
Llerandi said the answer to the problem
is "to give more responsibility and more
freedon to fraternities so that they are 100-
percent accountable to themselves."
Llerandi also suggested that each house
present a set of objectives on "house im
provements, community service projects
and responsible social programs."
Llerandi concluded by saying that there
are options to "the all-or-nothing attitude
that seems to be prevailing now."
Also stressing viable options to an "all
or-nothing" attitude were panelists John
Even, a member of Phi Delta Theta; Chris
Reid, member of Kappa Kappa Gamma;
and Theta Xi President Mike Dickerson.
All three are members of the Interfrater
nity/Intersorority Committee on the
Fraternal System at Stanford.
Reid said that the goal of the IFC/ISC is
to examine current housing policy and rec
ommend new alternatives. All three
IFC/ISC members stressed the possibility
of "creative alternatives as opposed to just

no housing."
The final speaker, Mini Sadeghi of
Sigma Phi Epsilon, said he sees the ques
tion being reduced to two issues: '"whether
fraternities are positive and whether they
should have housing."
"I see fraternity and sorority groups as
allowing individuals to aggregrate their re
sources. Without housing, the logistics of
getting are organized.
"There is room for change. There is
room for flexibility. It's stupid to throw the
whole system out because we're not chang
ing fast enough," Sadeghi said.
After Sadeghi's speech, the forum was
opened up to questions or comments from
audience members, including Keith Light.
"I am too idealistic to think we can't
take things which, at their heart, are good
and improve them," Light said. "Then,
plenty of hope. 1 believe that fraternity
at their heart, are good."
Light stressed the need for students to
educate other students on the issue a
take action themselves. "I think we're
moving ahead of Res Ed itself," he said.
