# A 						history of fraternities at Stanford
## They're as old as the school itself, but the relationship has been stormy

"77/ c fraternity system at its best
is mi tiiil to scholarship, to milli
ners and to character; at its worst,
it is a basis for vulgar itissemion.
The influence of a fraternity
depends on the men who are in it.''
- David Starr Jordan, president of
Stan ford University, 1891-1913.
Stanford officials put the Phi
Delta Theta fraternit) on proba
tion last week for allegedly forc
ing its pledges to drink large
amounts of alcohol in a short time
span — "organized alcohol
abuse." as Dean of Residential
Education Norm Robinson called
it. The Phi Delts are the third fra
ternity to go on probation this
academic year.
In November the Beta Theta Pi
fraternity was placed on proba
tion for three weeks after it
hosted a party at which a drunken
student allegedly assaulted a
number of women.
Delta Upsilon members held a
chin-up contest on a water pipe at
a DU party in December and
flooded their house, rendering it
temporarily uninhabitable and
causing damage estimated at
$ I (>.()()() or more. They are cur
rently on probation pending an
Interfraternitv Council investiga
tion.
IPC President Rick Hoskins
said the investigation "will deal
with the entire history of the
DUs." That would be a difficult
task: The fraternity was estab
lished at Stanford in 1896. v
A glance at the history of fra
ternities shows, first, that contro
versial activities have been a part
of fraternity life here for decades,
and. second, that fraternity mem
bers this year are really not be
having significantly differently
than in the past. Compare, for ex
ample, the current Phi Delt
charge with a few of their past ac
tivities.
In 1973 the University
censured the Phi Delts for throw
ing a rush party that involved the
raffle of a hired stripper. A prep
school junior from Dallas won the
coveted prize.
Back in 1966, the Phi Delts
were ordered to vacate University
housing after officials charged
them with "misconduct" during
an exchange party with Mills Col
lege students. Fraternity mem
bers hid in trees and urinated on

the women, and one Mills woman
was reported!) assaulted b\ a
group of naked men.
Still further back, the Phi Delts
were fined in 1947 for a series of
hazing incidents including hosing
passing cars, throwing bottles and
acting obscene I) in front of
w omen.
I he Karl) Y ears
It would be misleading, though,
to limit a history of fraternities to
hazing incidents and initiation
rites. By the end of Stanford's
first year, eight fraternities had
been established, nut as vehicles
tor frivolit) but as purposeful
educational and social institu
tions. Ernest Lewis, a member of
the first Phi Delt group in IN9I.
noted that the Greek system was
called upon "to elevate the moral
and social tone" of Stanford and
"to assist in sowing those seeds
that shall grow and ripen into per
fected manhood."
The Phi Delt house, originally
located next door to the original
Storey House, was the first frater
nit) residence on campus. Lewis
called his brothers "earnest, con
scientious students and thorough
gentlemen." He felt the purpose
of campus fraternities was "to ex
alt the idea of brotherhood of all
men striving for a higher educa
tion and a broader culture." and
he called cxclusiveness "the great
good of fraternities," saying it
was important for them to seek
"not quantity, but quality."
Hie fraternities' total student
membership at the enil of the first
year of the University was about
100. By 1903, though, the num
ber of fraternities had jumped to
17. and roughly 100 men from
each class belonged to each of
them.
A 1905 Stanford Alumnus
magazine article noted some ol
the benefits of joining Stanford's
fraternities: "The keen annual
competition for desirable recruits,
the rivalry in desire for campus
honors, the development of a sort
of altruistic friendship and the
domestic problems oi economi
cally maintaining a large house
and holding the younger men to
their college work are all experi
ences that give a practical reality
to fraternity life and make it help
ful for the future of the individ
ual."
In the 19205, fraternities

gained notorict) for Encina tub
bing — holding students under
water until the) were out of
breath. That practice went out of
style at the end of the decade, but
hazing remained popular, accord
ing to Fred Glover, a student here
from 1929 to 1933 and president
of Delta fan Delta in 1933.
Glover has fond memories of
his fraternit) days here, calling
the hazing activities "a bunch of
nonsense" and citing leadership
experience as fraternities' most
important contribution to the stu
dent bod\ then. He saxs there was

little drinking on campus. noting
that lie was here during the per
iod of Prohibition.
"Fraternities were a lot more
independent then, too." (ilover
adds. "We took care of our own
disciplinary problems." A great
political rivalry existed at the time
between the fraternities and the
popular eating clubs; (ilover says
the rivalry promoted healthy
competition.
In the I«J3Os. fraternities were
hurt In the Depression, which
forced financially strapped stu
dents to leave the University,
lowering the number of students
pledging but not the number ol
fraternities.
A Phi Delt alumnus from the
'30s. though, says fraternities
especially the Phi Dclts. /etes.
Dekes and Betas were quite
popular and competitive in his
day.
Was land Leonard, a Phi Delt
from 1436 to 1440. recalls how
seriously students took rush and
how different from today s the
s\ stem was. "Back then you
didn't rush a fraternity." he said.
" bratcrnitics rushed you. . I lie
rush parties were sessions to meet
and get to know one another.
I here was no drinking."
Leonard recalls li\ing next to
Storey House, singing songs
"that the dean ol women next
door didn't particularly like."
Paddling was a favorite practice
ol some fraternities then, lie says.
Hut he tells of a more inventive
activity he was required to do lor
initiation. Actives sent him to
Stanford's goll course at 2 a.m.
with orders to find three goll balls
they had left out for him. "I
realized they'd only left two out
and came up with a plan. ' he
recalls. "I woke up a farmer and
got an egg from him and brought
back the two goll balls and the

During World War 11. the Ira

ternities leased their houses to the
University. Freshmen moved out
of Encina — to make room for
the Arm\ — and into the frater
nit) houses, which then took on
the names of U.S. presidents.
(Meanwhile, the University
banned all sororities from campus
in 1044 because of fierce compe
tition among women vying for ad
mission and persistent an
tagonism between sorority and
non-sororit) women.)
In the fall til 1946 fraternities
re-entered University housing
under a new set of guidelines. The

(iieek system's popularity
remained strong with the num
ber of fraternities remaining sta
ble around 24 — until the mid-
I 4bos. w hen financial difficulties
an d growing disillusionment
killed si\ and changed many
others.
I he Modern Years
Until 1457. most fraternities
owned their houses, often with a
mortgage from the University.
Fraternity budgets could not
cover renovation costs, though,
and the houses deteriorated as a
result. Alumni could not make
tax-deductible gifts to maintain
the houses because they weren't
I Jniversity-owned.
\ L>s7 survey revealed that IS
ol Stanford's 24 fraternity houses
needed major repairs that would
cost up to $132,000 per house.
I his was solely the cost ol bring
ing the aging structures up to
minimum building code specifica
tions: il did not provide for addi
tions or modernization.
I hat year, the Stanford Hoard
of I rustees drafted the Under
graduate Men's Housing Pro
gram. which called for the reloca
tion ol all 24 fraternities into four
clusters. I'he plan caused contro
versy because the University
would now own the houses, but
officials cited three financial ad
vantages for the fraternities: lax
deductible contributions could be
made to the University, ear
marked for a certain fraternity;
low-cost federal loans would
become available to pay half the
construction costs; and no prop
erty tax would have to be paid.
i lie clusters failed to work out
as planned, however. Builders did
not complete the first until 1462,
and the second was not finisl d
until a year later. I lie buildings
provided 50 bed spaces, and with
the decline of membership in the

19605, some fraternities folded
with insufficient operating funds.
Perhaps the chief cause of the
decline in popularity was the stu
dent body's growing disillusion
ment with fraternities, owing in
large part to the exclusionary
ideals of the national fraternal or
ganizations.
In 1961 Alpha Tau Omega
pledged four Jewish students and
was promptly dropped from its
national organization, the first in
a series of similar actions here
which set apart Stanford's frater
nities as mavericks.

The kappa Siiiin'i fraternity
pledged ;i hiiick student in 106 ?
and was suspended from its na
tional organization two years
later. In lactivists pressured
University officials to disband the
Sigma Chi house because of ;i dis
criminatory clause in its charter.
One vear later, when a black stu
dent pledged, the Sigma Chis
broke from their national organi
zation. erased the discriminatory
clause and became an indepen
dent "local" fraternity.
Hut despite Stanford fraterni
ties' disaffiliating from their na
tional organizations, the frater
nity system became associated
with racism, a highly unpopular
stigma in the face of growing so
cial awareness on campus.
In addition, coed housing, tirst
offered at Stanford in 1967, fur
ther hurt the popularity ol frater
nities by increasing students'
choices for living arrangements.
Ironically, it was the I'hi Delts -
kicked out of their house after the
1966 Mills College exchange
partv — who created the space
necessary to carry out the Cirove
Mouse experiment, the first coed
house here.
Changing lifestyles in the late
'60s led to the establishment of
several alternative living situa
tions. including theme houses, co
ops and trailers, and the number
of pledges dropped further. Hy
1972 there were only 14 fraterni
ties on campus, and that number
soon dropped to 12 and then
leveled off for several years.
I'he last 'three years have wit
nessed a great resurgence in fra
ternity popularity, though the
University made it clear in 1983
that it would not provide addi
tional housing for fraternities or
sororities. In 19K2 Kappa Alpha
Psi became the first black frater
nity to gain official University
recognition.



Stanford University Archives
Members of Stanford's Alpha kappa Lambda fraternity pose in front of their campus house in 1937.
The University currently
recognizes 19 fraternities, 12 of
which are housed. (In addition,
seven sororities — none housed
— have gained recognition since
the University lifted its 33-year
ban on sororities in 1977.)
Critics say the University's sys
tem of housing some but not all
fraternal groups is unfair. In addi
tion, they say it is unfair for mem
bers of housed fraternities to
decide by subjective means who
can live in their residences.
In 1983 Dean of Student Af
fairs James Lyons created The
Task Force to Study Fraternities
and Sororities at Stanford, asking
the 17-member committee to ad
dress the question: "To what ex
tent should fraternal organiza
tions at Stanford be encouraged
or discouraged?" The task force
announced its key recommenda
tion in May 1984: Dissolve fra
ternity housing.
Lyons has said since receiving
the report that the University will
take no action for at least two
years.
Hazing
Since 1946, when fraternities
re-entered University residences,
critics have questioned whether
Stanford should house fraterni
ties. Predictably, the omnipresent

cry for dissolving fraternity
housing seems to have been
loudest at the times when hazing
charges have arisen.
Stanford fraternities have
become associated not only with
top-notch intramural teams and
large parties but also with nude
volleyball games in Wilbur Field
and obscene shouting from roof
tops.
Delta Tau Delta is one house
that has been charged with hazing
many times in recent years. In
1973 the Delts were suspended
by the University for throwing
rocks and bottles through house
windows, firing pellet guns at cars
and burning a mattress on their
front lawn. They were suspended
again in 1976 and in 1981, the
most recent punishment following
a 1980 rush party at which a
woman fell 17 feet from a second
story window.
Several other fraternities have
found themselves in trouble with
the University. A look at the
recent history of Stanford's most
notorious fraternity serves to
show hazing here at its extreme.
"To be a Zete means to be
destructive and to disregard the
rights of others," said Director of
the Row Diana Conklin in 1981,
when the University announced
its decision to suspend the resi
dential privileges of the Zeta Psi
fraternity for three years.
The suspension followed a se
ries of hazing incidents —
"persistent theft, vandalism and
anti-social behavior," according

to Conklin — culminating in the
tossing of a Mills College visitor
into the Zete House pond during
a party. A University report on
the pond incident concluded that
the victim "suffered significant
emotional upheaval and humilia
tion." Three Zete members were
arrested on misdemeanor charges
in connection with the incident.
The University announced the
Zete suspension Oct. 29, 1981.
That night vandals broke into the
Res Ed office and poured milk
and coffee in typewriters and cal
culators and on desks and file
cabinets.
Though never proved, it was
assumed that Zete members were
responsible. "It certainly is hard
to believe this wasn't connected
with the Zete suspension," Norm
Robinson was reported saying the
following morning as he poured
milk from a desk-top calculator.
In December of 1981, police
discovered two Zete pledges lying
face-down in the mud near the
University's remote horse stables.
The pledges — one of whom was
legally blind — wore only under
shorts, and their hands and feet
were bound tightly with surgical
tape.
The University restored official
recognition of the Zetes last year
and is currently considering their
application for housing. The fra
ternity could move back into its
most recent residence — 353
Campus Drive — as early as Sep
tember.
