## Sororities: from tears to Twister 
### David kisser Daily staff 
On April 26, 1944, the University mysteriously called a
7:30 Cubberley Auditorium meeting — limited to Stan
lord women. At the meeting, University President
Donald I residder launched into a history of sororities ;it
Stanford before announcing that the board of trustees had
unanimously voted to authorize Tresidder to "work out
procedures which will lead to the discontinuation of
sororities." A 33-year ban had begun.
David Jacobson, a University secretary who was
present at the meeting, wrote in 197 X, ••Just before he an
nounced the decision, the president asked that there lie no
demonstration of any kind. There was none — except the
woman standing on my right broke into a broad grin; tears
rolled down the cheeks of the one on my left. I heir num
bers were multiplied throughout the room. I lie purpose of
the meeting was now clear to all who were there."
The Daily reported that the women first applauded
Tresidder as he left the stage and then spontaneously
broke into the "Stanford Hymn." Tresidder returned to
the stage to thank them: "That was the nicest thing you
could have done."
The outright dominance bv sororities ot Stanford
women's life in the 1940s is something quite foreign to the
system today, yet the perceived positive values of
sororities and the problems associated with their downfall
in 1944 remain evident.
I he Rise and I all
The first sorority chapter came to Stanford when
Kappa Alpha I hcta transfcrcd its charter at the I Jnivcrsitv
ol the Pacific to the I arm in January 1X92. Kappa Kappa
(iamma came later that year, followed by Pi Beta Phi in
1X93. I'hev were the onlv competing sororities here until
Delta (iamma and Alpha Phi came late in that de
cade. When the ban was instituted in IIM4.l l M4. there were
nine sororities in row houses, down from a peak of 1 (I after
Sigma Kappa voluntarily surrendered its charter.
Until the fall ol I 933. the number ol women at Stanford
was limited to 500 at any one time: one woman in two
belonged to a sorority. Differences between sorority
women and non-sororitv. or "hall." women warranted
complaints to the administration in 1919. 1925 and
again in 1930. " 1 he problems were even surfacing when I
was a freshman in 192 hand had been a good many years
before that." commented Ro/ Bacon, a member ol the
Kappas and later the director ol Rohle Hall.
In 11>34.l l >34. after a series of debates. Stanford women
voted 2 1 (t to 103 in favor of maintaining the sorority sys
tem. A I 93X editorial in The Daily asked that the number
ol sororities be increased or that they be disbanded en
tirely. the latter being the more feasible solution. Until
1943. however, the problems with sororities were rejected
as not great enough to require definitive action.
When the number of women at Stanford increased to
1.050 in 1933. there was no corresponding change in the
number of sororities. Because each woman chosen to be in
a sorority had to live in one of the nine houses, bv 1943
onlv one Stanford woman in five could join a sorority. At
the same time, there were far fewer men on campus, lie
cause of the war. and fraternities were temporarily without
housing due to the occupation of dorms by soldiers. The
sorority competition became fierce and the division be
tween hall women, who lived together in Roble and
Lagunita Court, and sororitv women was perceived bv
some as a threat to the unity ol the University.
I lie board ol trustees' report accepted with the vote to
ban sororities stated. " I lie division is unmistakable when
the rushing period starts. I here is an emotional tension
which affects prospective pledges and sorority women
alike. At the end of rushing ... a few ol the women who
have not been chosen leave Stanford. Women who remain
in the halls tend to loose confidence in themselves. To
main, life now centers around the sorority. The division
between non-sorority and sorority women then starts."
I'll ere was also concern that women's academics were
suffering due to the rigors of the rush process and that hall
women who became campus leaders inevitably joined
sororities, leav ing some non-sorority women with a feeling
of failure.
1943 was a year in which campus dances and prepara
tions for them made front-page headlines in Die Daily,
second only to reports of World War 11. During the entire
Rush period. The Daily ran front-page stories with reports
of the sorority teas and desserts held the day before and a
schedule ol the new day's activities, including the appro
priate dress lor each event.
••NINE FARM SORORITIES PI I DC. I I 2d."
screamed the banner headline on a special Saturday edi
tion ol The Dai Iv in 1943. I lie top of the page read
"EXTRA!! Pledges l isted Inside EXTRA!! Great em
phasis was placed on which sorority pledged the most
women. Inside were congratulatory advertisements from
local businesses.
The same vear. I 3 sponsors (similar to today's Resident
Assistants) living in Roble presented a petition to the I ni
versity. They wrote. " The previously recognized faults of
the sorority system at Stanford have reached the point
where they can be condoned no longer."
Bacon, director of Roble in 1944. said he felt the war
played a role in the decision to ban sororities and the ae

ceptance ot the ban by many women. "People were taking
seriously our democratic effort in the war. They believed
we were lighting for world democracy and saw we weren't
practicing democratic principles here at Stanford."
Indeed, the Roble sponsors wrote, "sororities are un
democratic and unnecessary." Half the sponsors were
sororitv members and an anti-sorority drive in 193S in
volved sorority women.
I'he petition was a challenge to the sororities and the
Panhcllcnic Council of sorority alumnae to come up with a
solution to the inequities in the system. Sorority leaders,
however, could not agree on one comprehensive solution.
They did agree to a less formal Rush and the Panhcllcnic
decided that "the sorority problem is diminutive, inop
portune and insignificant (in light of the domestic war ef
fort). and we ask postponement until the war is over."
The most important result of the Roble sponsors' peti
tion was the creation of a trustees committee to study the
issue. Alter 14 months ol deliberation, the committee sub
mitted the report recommending that sororities be
abolished to the lull board, where it was passed unani
mously .
Carol Wilson, a Theta who graduated in 1914. wrote to
the University in outrage. "Our Alma Mater has been
deprived of future partieipaton in intercollegiate associa
tions of nationwide strength and prestige. . . . The back
wash of 25 years of misunderstanding . . . clogs the free
llow ot spontaneous effort (to improve rather than ban
sororities)."
However, as Tresidder requested that fateful night in
1944. there were no demonstrations. Judy Scovvcroft,
president of the Panhcllcnic wrote the next day,"I feel
that sorority women will support (Tresidder) in working
out successfully the new system." The individual sororities
voted reluctantly to conform with the trustees' decision
and the 33-year prohibition began.
I he rumor that sororities were banned because a num
ber ol sorority sisters or rejected women jumped to their
deaths from Hoover lower persists to this day. I red
Glover. University secretary, insists. "| know for
sure there were no suicides. We cannot get rid of that
story. It is not true." Two or more men jumped in 1965 in
separate incidents. One woman drowned in Lake Lagunita
in the early I l )40s. hastening some to claim her death was
.i suicide connected to sororities. In anv case, there are
now bars around the Hoover Tower windows.
Back from the Dead
A battle began in the early 1970s as groups of women
organized to attempt a return of sororities. Under mount
ing pressure from students, alumnae and national sororitv
representatives. Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons said
in 1975 that he disapproved of establishing sororities or
any more fraternities on campus it they demanded the
right to choose their members sclcctivclv.
Ironically or not. Title IX of the Educational Amend
ments Act ol I ( >72. designed to protect against discrimina
tion on the basis of se\ in institutions receiv ing federal aid.
was brought up in the effort to gain the return of
sororities. The argument was that Stanford allowed frater
nities. yet prohibited sororities and that was dis
criminatory .
Lyons said if a discrimination complaint were lodged,
the University would "deny subjective selectivitv rights
completely." In other words. Stanford was willing to
abolish fraternities to avoid sororities. The Committee on
Services to Students (COSS). however, voted three to one
in 1977 to recommend that the trustees rescind the
sorority ban and Lyons agreed. "A majority . . . feels that

the University has a long-standing commitment to. .. the
fraternity system. Therefore, the University should permit
all-female sororites rather than eliminate all-male frater
nities," COSS concluded.
Alpha Phi, Gamma Phi Beta and Delta Gamma were
already expressing interest in returning to Stanford, and a
few sororities still retained holding funds in the tens of
thousands of dollars which belonged to their old Stanford
chapters.
But University President Richard Lyman noted a "very
strong reluctance" on the part of several trustees "to see
national Greek-letter sororities restored out of fear that
some of the difficulties that brought about their abolition
may return to haunt us."
Whether to avoid lawsuits or to promote equality at
Stanford, the board of trustees voted to rescind the
sorority ban in December 1977. This was only the begin
ning.
Anxious to avoid any repetition of the conditions which
led to the original 1944 ban, the trustees passed measures
to ensure that any sorority seeking recognition from the
University would have to prove a significant degree ot
autonomy from its national organization.
The board report states explicitly that the sorority se
lection process may not involve letters of reference or the
gathering of information from sources outside the Univer
sity and that national approval must not be necessary lor a
prospective pledge to gain membership.
A Tri-Delt pledge book from the 1940s states, Ihe
pledge member shall be approved by the executive secre
tary of Delta Delta Delta," and "before chapters may
invite a girl to pledge, a written recommendation from an
alumna member resident in the girl's home town must be
i)ii file." One sorority constitution permitted a national
council to dismiss any active member.
In similar fashion, many sororities' national constitu-
