# Poli Sci profs unite against Ward report
## 
### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
Sixteen of the 23 professors in the Political Science De
partment have accused the Ward Committee — a group
that called for more joint appointments between Stanford
and the Hoover Institution — of producing a report
"filled with biases and distortions" and ultimately doing
"a gross disservice to the entire Stanford community."
The faculty members — both professors and assistant
professors — signed a letter alleging that the Ward Com
mittee report is "one sided" because it only considers
events from Hoover's point of view.
"The purpose of this letter is to place the Ward Com
mittee report in perspective by calling attention to its er
rors of facts and omission and to the indefensible asym
metry in its treatment of the Hoover Institution and the
Department of Political Science," the group said in the letter,
which was published Wednesday in Campus Report.
The six-member Ward Committee studied the proce
dure for joint appointments between Stanford and
Hoover for five months before releasing a report in late
November calling for a strengthening of those ties. Ac
cording to the report, "The advantages for both parties
that could result from the establishment of a systemati
cally cooperative relationship between the University and
Hoover are dazzling
The report says that increased cooperation could create
a prestigious social science program here that would rival
Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government.
In the course of heralding this untapped potential, the
committee made jabs at the Political Science Department
for being unprofessional by discouraging joint appoint
ments, according to political science professors. The
report, submitted to University President Donald Ken
nedy and the board of trustees subcommittee on
University-Hoover relations, accuses the department of
engendering "acrimonious" relations with Hoover.
But as the debate heads toward the floor of the Faculty
Senate, some of the key figures say the discussion will
hinge not on the battle between Hoover and the Political
Science Department, but on the conclusions of the report
itself.
"The major job is to address the implications of their
recommendations," said Alexander George, professor of
political science and an outspoken critic of the Ward
Committee's procedures. George said the allegations
raised by trie letter are important "only so far as they raise
important questions for the whole community."
"I would hope that they will be separate issues," said
Robert Ward, chairman of the committee.
The political science faculty first responded to the
charges leveled in the Ward Committee report in mid-
December, when Department"Chairman Stephen Krasner
sent a letter to Ward asking for a retraction of those sec
tions of the report that some say libeled the department.
Krasner, on behalf of the department, also demanded an
apology.
On Jan. 9, Ward admitted the committee had made a
mistake when it charged one senior member of the de
partment with unprofessional conduct. In a retraction, he
wrote, "The group did not at the time check the accuracy
of the statement."
On Jan. 16. Ward wrote a letter denying the committee
had meant to suggest the Political Science Department
"acted for political or unprofessional reasons."
The majority of the political science staff judged these
statements inadequate and signed Wednesday's letter in
protest to the Ward Committee's accusations.
"I think we asked for a retraction and apology and they
said no," said John Manley, professor of political science.
"What we got from the Ward Committee was basically an
apology to one professor and some kind of fuzzy
response" to Krasner's letter, Manley said.
