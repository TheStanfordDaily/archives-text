Most of the recipients praised the

said Poster. "It's a chance to meet
and work with the most interesting
women on campus."

and I liked," at the F.ast Palo Alto
Community Law Project.
Trewitt called his work "a neat
project that hadn't ever really been
done before."
Some of the recipients said they
did not expect to win the award. "It
was a real surprise because my ad
viser was constantly telling me not to
do this work," said Nowicki.
"1 was pretty surprised" said Pas
sarelli. "It's nice to know they see
your work and are glad you did it."
