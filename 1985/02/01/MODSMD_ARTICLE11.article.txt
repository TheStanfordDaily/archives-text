# HCC to publish Honor Code recommendations
## 
### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Staff writer 
In response to the Student Conduct
Legislative Council's (SCLC) pro
posed modifications of the Honor
Code, the Honor Code Commission
(HCC) has written recommendations
to increase student understanding of
the Honor Code.
The recommendations will be
released in the form of essays in Wed
nesday's Campus Report. The essays
evaluate penalty grading, proctoring,
plagiarism and the importance of ap
pearing honest and propose an
elaboration on the definition of col
laboration, a form of plagiarism.
The HCC is in charge of education
and research activities regarding the
Honor Code.
The HCC goal is both to

"educate people of what the issues are
and give advice to the SCLC," said
HCC Chairman Arthur Keller.
"The Honor Code is a very impor
tant thing and it's important that the
students put effort into it. The stu
dents are collectively being respon
sible for themselves," he said.
The HCC cited several drawbacks
regarding the proposed changes to
the Honor Code's plagiarism policy.
The current policy does not recognize
the subjectiveness across campus in
defining plagiarism. The SCLC
proposes that each department be re
sponsible for explicitly defining
plagiarism "as it relates to that dis
cipline and that the instructors be re
quired to disseminate this interpreta
tion to the students," said HCC mem
ber Benny Lazo in his essay on
plagiarism.

First, a common definition in all
departments "would reduce a diver
gence of interpretations, lest the issue
become too complex," wrote Lazo,
criticizing the placement of ex
pediency above more fair interpreta
tions.
Second, the proposal does not sug
gest a method for the various inter
pretations to be disseminated. Third,
the proposal does not address deter
rence of plagiarism, but just "the pro
secution of such cases," Lazo wrote.
Keller, in his essay on collabora
tion, also suggests that "a statement
on plagiarism and collaboration may
be issued for a course, course section,
course sequence or for an entire de
partment. . . . We suggest that the
change implemented involve a
broader statement that includes the
nature of collaboration permitted."

The HCC wants to clarify to the
students "what is expected of them,"
he said.
The HCC also treats the subjec
tivity of penalty grading. The SCLC
has proposed modifying the
"Interpretations and Applications of
the Honor Code" — an addendum to
the Honor Code — to eliminate the
option of penalty grading. The com
mittee also distinguishes between
"intellectual" errors, which are the
responsibility of the instructor, and
"moral" errors, which the SCLC re
quires to be reported to the Office of
Judicial Affairs.
Keller proposes that "cases that are
currently handled by penalty grading
could still be handled quickly by ad
judication within the dean's (of Stu
dent Affairs) office. Instructors

should report all cases; the Judicial
Affairs officer and the dean of Stu
dent Affairs are experienced in deter
mining which cases should not result
in charges. When the instructor is un
clear whether the student's error is
intellectual' or'moral,' the instructor
should ask the Judicial Affairs officer
for guidance."
The HCC states its disapproval of
faculty proctoring.
"The students collectively accept
responsibility for their own honesty,
and faculty should not take extraordi
nary measures to detect student dis
honesty," said Keller and Suzanne
Liu, also an HCC member. Some stu
dents did express approval of some
form of proctoring, and the HCC is
looking into student-proctored exams
later in the year.

The HCC also addressed the
SCLC's proposal concerning the im
portance of appearing honest. It
questions both the advantages and
disadvantages of including such a
statement and encourages a narrower
definition.
"The intent of the recommenda
tion is toward reinforcing an atmo
sphere of confidence in the honesty of
those who are behaving in accordance
with the Honor Code," wrote HCC
member Doug Daher in his essay on
the importance of appearances.
Keller compared the issue to Ed
win Meese Ill's recent problems
during his confirmation hearings to
become attorney general.
Some of the information in the es
says is based on a survey of under
graduate and graduate students
conducted during the spring of 1984.
