## The 						Stanford Daily Editor's farewell 
### 
Mure than four months after it began. Volume
IK6 has come to a close.
There have been times we have sparkled; other
times we were merely adequate. And there have
been some instances (read: The Stanford Daily
Magazine cover) that we've failed embarrass
ingly.
Perhaps Paul Irvin put it best when he said that
sometimes he proudly tells people that he pastes
up The Stanford Daily, and that other times he
I us t says he works at a small typesetting shop at
Stanford University.
But through it all. we were challenged by, at
times exhausted by, our work here. We tried at
all times to uphold a high journalistic — some
would call it pre-professional — standard, and on
the whole 1 think we succeeded.
We trained a fresh crop of writers, night
editors, wire editors and photographers; a job as
important as putting out the paper. And though
people may argue about the paper's quality, there
is no disputing its quantity. Volume 186 has been
the biggest in recent years, possibly the biggest in
Daily history. Advertising sales are up and, after

a few shaky years a couple years back. The Daily
may well be on the road to long-term financial
stability.
I'd like to thank our business manager,
Andrew; our advertising manager, Kelvin; the
managing editors, Tim and Sandra; and the rest
of the department editors for contributing their
talent and their commitment. More important,
I'd like to thank our writers, photographers and
sales representatives, without whom the rest of us
would have nothing to do.
I'd like to thank my housemates for bearing
with me for the last quarter and one half. If I
seemed aloof, 1 apologize; I was simply preoc
cupied. Finally, I'd like to thank Bev, Paul and
Mike, our "Backshop buddies," for a herculean
quantity of patience and humor.
I hope the Stanford community has enjoyed
The Daily this volume; 1 know I have.
