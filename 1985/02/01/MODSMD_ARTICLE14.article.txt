# Robby Perkins
## The 						Devil made me do it 
### 
Do you remember those cartoons in which some
character is in a battle of conscience with a little
devil whispering "ill advice" in one ear and a little
angel advocating "the good" in the other? Well,
this was exactly my predicament last week when I
contemplated donating to an African Famine Relief
fund. I know the crisis is today's most immediate
problem on earth hundreds of people are dying
every week. Vet the devil was very persuasive and
it made for an interesting debate.
Devi/ Look Rob. no one is donating to those Eth
iopians Relief experts estimate that Americans
have onl> donated $50-to 100 million during the
height of the crisis these past three months — that's
less than 50 cents a person. By not donating, you
would not be am worse than most.
\ngel: Robbv. this is all the more reason why
\ ou —
Devil Don't listen to Mr. Holy Toes over there.
You know vou can't afford it. Rob. Your check
book balance is barely positive and you can
scarcely pay your next VISA bill. Also, there are
more fun things to spend money on that aren't so
depressing, like that ski trip or that sushi dinner.
Angel: \ ou have the money, Rob: it's just a mat
ter of how vou spend it. That $60 spent skiing or
'iat S2O spent dining could have saved lives! As far
• is having fun is concerned, you could make donat
ing fun by linking the amount donated to the
amount you spend on "fun" things.
Devil Don't be crazy, Robby. Why would you
want to give a percentage of your entertainment
mone\ to people you don't even know? You can't
even name one of those starving Africans. You've
got nothing in common with them. That's what
reallv motivates people to give. Let the Russians
save their fellow communists; let the Israelis save
theii Lallaslian brothers (whom, by the way, the Is
raelis are just using as pawns by settling them on
the West Bank).
Angel: Do you really have to have cultural or po
litical ties to -
Devil: Yeah, yeah, yeah. That stuff may sound
good in theory, but let's get down to some facts. If
vou were to give, ii wouldn't ever reach the needy
anvvvav. If those Los Angeles evangelists don't

pocket your donation in the United States, then
those Eritrea and Tigre rebels will ambush the food
relief truck in Ethiopia.
Angel: The existence of American profiteers and
Ethiopian rebels should only make you cautious in
deciding to which organization you would donate,
not whether you —
Devil: Why don't you shut up. Halo Head! Now
tell me, Rob. What's the real reason why you would
donate? Aren't you really just seeking to alleviate
vour own guilt for being so well off? Don't use

those Ethiopians just to convince yourself that
you're not selfish.
Angel: Intentions are not as important when the
outcome is —
Devil: I told you. lay off that holy-yoke stuff that
nobody wants to hear of bear. What's the big deal
about starvation anyway? If the suffering were really
that bad, the omniscient, omnipotent man upstairs
would send down relief from above. Doesn't He
claim to love that starving Eniopian child just as
much as He loves a well-fed American? He would
not let that child suffer if the pain were real, now
would He?
Angel: God works in mysterious —
Devil: We've all heard that one before. Rob, lis

ten to me: A donation is only a temporary solution.
Another drought could come along and the crisis
will start all over again; that is it the self-righteous
media decides to publicize it again. Mr. Angelic
knows he's not proposing any meaningful or long
term solution. In fact, your donation would be det
rimental; it would both discourage native farmers
from growing their own crops and encourage that
commie government to continue oppressing the
people.
Angel: Robby, can you stop to contemplate the

possible long term social, economic and political ef
fects of thousands of people —
Devil: Yes he can. And he will, becuase if he
were to make one small monetary donation, the
next thing you'd want is for him to become an
agricultural engineer or something and donate his
entire life!

haven't thought about it since.

Devi/ Look Rob. no one is donating to those Eth
iopians Relief experts estimate that Americans
have onl> donated $50-to 100 million during the
height of the crisis these past three months — that's
less than 50 cents a person. By not donating, you
would not be am worse than most.
\ngel: Robbv. this is all the more reason why
\ ou —
Devil Don't listen to Mr. Holy Toes over there.
You know vou can't afford it. Rob. Your check
book balance is barely positive and you can
scarcely pay your next VISA bill. Also, there are
more fun things to spend money on that aren't so
depressing, like that ski trip or that sushi dinner.
Angel: \ ou have the money, Rob: it's just a mat
ter of how vou spend it. That $60 spent skiing or
'iat S2O spent dining could have saved lives! As far
• is having fun is concerned, you could make donat
ing fun by linking the amount donated to the
amount you spend on "fun" things.
Devil Don't be crazy, Robby. Why would you
want to give a percentage of your entertainment
mone\ to people you don't even know? You can't
even name one of those starving Africans. You've
got nothing in common with them. That's what
reallv motivates people to give. Let the Russians
save their fellow communists; let the Israelis save
theii Lallaslian brothers (whom, by the way, the Is
raelis are just using as pawns by settling them on
the West Bank).
Angel: Do you really have to have cultural or po
litical ties to -
Devil: Yeah, yeah, yeah. That stuff may sound
good in theory, but let's get down to some facts. If
vou were to give, ii wouldn't ever reach the needy
anvvvav. If those Los Angeles evangelists don't

pocket your donation in the United States, then
those Eritrea and Tigre rebels will ambush the food
relief truck in Ethiopia.
Angel: The existence of American profiteers and
Ethiopian rebels should only make you cautious in
deciding to which organization you would donate,
not whether you —
Devil: Why don't you shut up. Halo Head! Now
tell me, Rob. What's the real reason why you would
donate? Aren't you really just seeking to alleviate
vour own guilt for being so well off? Don't use

those Ethiopians just to convince yourself that
you're not selfish.
Angel: Intentions are not as important when the
outcome is —
Devil: I told you. lay off that holy-yoke stuff that
nobody wants to hear of bear. What's the big deal
about starvation anyway? If the suffering were really
that bad, the omniscient, omnipotent man upstairs
would send down relief from above. Doesn't He
claim to love that starving Eniopian child just as
much as He loves a well-fed American? He would
not let that child suffer if the pain were real, now
would He?
Angel: God works in mysterious —
Devil: We've all heard that one before. Rob, lis

ten to me: A donation is only a temporary solution.
Another drought could come along and the crisis
will start all over again; that is it the self-righteous
media decides to publicize it again. Mr. Angelic
knows he's not proposing any meaningful or long
term solution. In fact, your donation would be det
rimental; it would both discourage native farmers
from growing their own crops and encourage that
commie government to continue oppressing the
people.
Angel: Robby, can you stop to contemplate the

possible long term social, economic and political ef
fects of thousands of people —
Devil: Yes he can. And he will, becuase if he
were to make one small monetary donation, the
next thing you'd want is for him to become an
agricultural engineer or something and donate his
entire life!
1 ended the debate on this scary thought and
haven't thought about it since.
