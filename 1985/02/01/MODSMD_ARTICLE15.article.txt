Take no prisoners
I must respond in opposition to
Rcbholz and Gallagher's "Call for
action" (The Daily, Jan. 28). Like it
or not, Ron and Lowell, we live in
the United States. In said nation,
public demonstration is a right which
is often taken for granted. Nut that I
agree with the motives or the actions
of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon frater
nity members who imitated Segal's
statue on Jan. 15. Rather. 1 fear the
cry for reprisal against these pledges
and the linking of their actions to
general "bad feelings" concerning
fraternities.
When one differentiates between
what is and what is not an acceptable
form of public demonstration, one
enters dangerous territory. What is
acceptable? If what was viewed by
the public as "non-acceptable"
demonstration were banned, we
could begin by throwing the mem
bers of the American Nazi Party in
jail. If the prank was seen by some as
malicious, that's fine. Write an edito
rial condemning the prank, or stage a
"skit" of your own. Just don't tell me
that these members need to be pun
ished.
Of course there's the argument
that fraternities have been punished
for less outrageous actions in the
past. There are two implicit assump
tions in this argument. The first is
that fraternities as a whole need to
be punished. Come on guys, Stan
ford isn't some kind of day camp.
When a member enters a fraternity,
his actions are still his responsibility,
not the responsibility of the larger
unit. If a member chooses to do unac
ceptable acts, focus the blame on
that iiuii* idual. Many arguments
against fraternities make it sound
like there is some amorphous blob of
control to which all members submit
responsibility. Even with the peer
pressure involved, one must accept
the fact that in the end each individ

ual answers to himself.
The second assumption in the
preceding phrase is that fraternities
have been punished for less out
rageous acts. What makes this act so
outrageous? The fact that it involved
gays rather than the Reagan li
brary? In the past, fraternities have
been punished for breaking rules.
They have damaged their houses and
pushed women into fountains. Now
it seems people want retaliation
whenever fraternities do something
that is offensive or seems just plain
wrong. Count me out.
If the public disagrees with the
legal actions of individuals, then the
punishment of those individuals
should be incurred by the public
wrath. In the case of Stanford frater
nities, there is the added factor of
Stanford implicitly "accepting" such
behavior by not punishing the frater
nity. If Stanford were to punish the
fraternity, as an institution it would
be making a private determination as
to what is acceptable on its campus,
which it has every right to do. In the
same token, such a determination
and its resulting definition of what is
"acceptable" is in effect a drift away
from the very diversity that Rcbholz
and Gallagher call for.
To me, being offended is a fact of
life. I'm offended and upset when I
see a Ku Klux Klan rally or hear the
National Rifle Association tell
America it needs handguns. But I
don't request punishment. Rather, I
accept the fact that some people's
views and actions will outrage me.
At the same time 1 continue to con
demn these actions and hope to
induce change.
The Segal stunt hurts, and that's
too bad. The benefits gained by
refraining from punishment in such
cases far outweigh the affront on
social freedom which selective
punishment would incur.
