## Stanford fire of complacency 
### 
Recently, an open letter was circ
ulated through various organs of
Stanford. It is an extended work, 30
pages long, t.iking the University to
task for its lack of any real commit
ment to intellectual exchange and the
life of the mind. IJnfortunatley, the
letter is having difficulty getting pub
lished and its author, David hem
pen, is having difficulty being heard.
" The irony of the whole thing,"
says l.empert, ' is that since The
Daily has decided no one's really in
terested in the life or death of ideas
here, it won't publish the letter. It
ends up keeping my ideas
suppressed." and fulfilling its own
prophecy.
"What kind of a school is it whose
paper devotes four pages to sports,
three pages to movie reviews and
only one page to a public forum for
opinions?"
At issue, according to l.empert. is
the variety of outlooks that Stanford
is supposed to represent, without
which the students either bend to
whatevei is expected ol them or lose
anv sense of commitment to under
standing.
Intrigued by the promise that a lack
of diversity on Stanford's part might
be responsible for my own foggy
meanderings through books, lessons
,md life. I took out my portable
notebook and interviewed some
friends. What I found began to in
trigue me even more.
•'There"re hardly any dissenting
\ iewpoints here, said Matt Cirant.
\part from the short-lived debates
i>u what used to be critical social is
sues. like sexism, racism, militarism
u pow'itv. there's a real lack ol any
iltern.itive thinking Stanford, in spite
i>t the critiral possibilities of a univei
sii\. is beginning more and more to
mirror the conformity and
homogeneity ol the non-academic

world."
Solomon Hill agreed. "It can be sti
fling here. No one really wants to ad
mit that there are certain things that
make people different. There's even a
romanticization of ignorance, with all
the alcohol swimming around frater
nity and dorm parties. You don't get
smarter when you're drunk."
So. among the few students I spoke
to. there was the feeling that, in gen
eral. Stanford students arc painfully
similar in their interests, in their
goals, in their very goal orientations.
And a suspicion arose that those
goals they'd adopted here were just
what "society" or "the status quo"
expected them to.
The irony of this — that students
thought students were too much the
"same" — indicates one of the fol
lowing:
1) Those few I talked to are
radically different from their counter
parts. in that they are the ones
actively questioning their reasons for
being here. If this were true, it would
point to a Stanford that did lack di
versity and whose dominant passion
was complacency: "We already know
why we're here, so why do we have to
talk about it?"
2) There are many people here
who question the role of the Univer
sity and their own status as its
pro lexers. If this is true, then the stu
dents are not convinced that being
here is the best way to get an educa
tion. Perhaps they are even skeptical
about education's purpose.
One student (I'll call him Bill) un
knowingly struck to the heart of the
whole issue when he claimed reluc
tance to speak to me.
Just raising the issue of 'ideas' is
merely .in intellectual game," he sug
uest.'d "It's also an exercise that will

just end up confirming for ourselves
how great we are.
"At Stanford, we are being
groomed for leadership. What's the
use of discussing ideas — or even
about ideas? It's a little like the king
asking his court its opinion on
Divine Right. You could say that
learning and intellectual exchange
lead us to live rewarding lives, but so
what? That doesn't do anyone else
any good. The basic fact, that there is
a ruling class, trained in universities,
entering 'the marketplace' with
materialist visions of yuppiedom,
doesn't change."
I get a little depressed whenever I
hear someone question the very posi
tion I'm trying to justify. Here I am,
trying to revitalize an interest in edu
cation and "ideas," when Bill comes
along (admittedly at my invitation)
and suggests that we're only deceiv
ing ourselves if we think learning
benefits anyone else.
But Bill has a good point. An idea
has very little use unless people are
willing to modify their behavior be
cause of it. Note, please, that they
don't have to change their way of life
just upon hearing the idea, or reading
the book or watching the film; in
fact, it might be impossible. They
must be open to the possibility that
such a thing can affect them in impor
tant ways and even, perhaps, spur
them into such a radical direction as
social change. But by eliminating that
possibility beforehand the sad fact
becomes true: you are complacent,
self-satisfied and willing to accept
whatever direction some external
source has determined is "proper"
for you to follow. You accept the vi
sion handed you by the status quo.
Way back when I was a senior in
high school, flipping through some of
the vast literature that bombards the
prospective collegian, I came across

something called "The Insider's
Guide to Colleges." Stanford's entry
ran something like this:
"If you're the type who likes to
compete in scholarship and savor the
pleasures of sun and sport, then you'll
be right at home down on the Farm.
But if you're looking for an institu
tion where a true, lively discussion of
ideas and issues are the order of the
day, then you'll be out of place at
Stanford."
"The Insider's Guide" is a Yale
Daily News publication, and so I passed
over such a harsh assessment rather
easily. But now it's a year and a half
later. I'm experienced. I've com
pleted my Western Culture track;
I've excelled in a number of courses;
I've flunked a few others; I've met
enough people floundering around
both academically and personally to
wonder: What is the point of coming
here for an education? Where is the
large, open forum which I crave? Is
Stanford just a prep school for the
upwardly mobile?
In his open letter, David Lempert
refers to the Stanford educational
system as "ossified" — a harsh
criticism, but one offered by someone
sincerely concerned with the state of
learning at this university. I believe it
is incumbent on all of us to take a
look at the issues being raised —
which means The Daily must print
Lempert's article, and any of the
various people concerned enough to
take it seriously must respond to it
and have their responses printed.
Without debate on this issue, and
without a much livelier discussion of
topics essential to our university and
our society Stanford will indeed have
become ossified — anothei tool of
the status quo, a structure without a
vision, a watchfire of complacency.

being here. If this were true, it would
point to a Stanford that did lack di
versity and whose dominant passion
was complacency: "We already know
why we're here, so why do we have to
talk about it?"
2) There are many people here
who question the role of the Univer
sity and their own status as its
pro lexers. If this is true, then the stu
dents are not convinced that being
here is the best way to get an educa
tion. Perhaps they are even skeptical
about education's purpose.
One student (I'll call him Bill) un
knowingly struck to the heart of the
whole issue when he claimed reluc
tance to speak to me.
Just raising the issue of 'ideas' is
merely .in intellectual game," he sug
uest.'d "It's also an exercise that will

just end up confirming for ourselves
how great we are.
"At Stanford, we are being
groomed for leadership. What's the
use of discussing ideas — or even
about ideas? It's a little like the king
asking his court its opinion on
Divine Right. You could say that
learning and intellectual exchange
lead us to live rewarding lives, but so
what? That doesn't do anyone else
any good. The basic fact, that there is
a ruling class, trained in universities,
entering 'the marketplace' with
materialist visions of yuppiedom,
doesn't change."
I get a little depressed whenever I
hear someone question the very posi
tion I'm trying to justify. Here I am,
trying to revitalize an interest in edu
cation and "ideas," when Bill comes
along (admittedly at my invitation)
and suggests that we're only deceiv
ing ourselves if we think learning
benefits anyone else.
But Bill has a good point. An idea
has very little use unless people are
willing to modify their behavior be
cause of it. Note, please, that they
don't have to change their way of life
just upon hearing the idea, or reading
the book or watching the film; in
fact, it might be impossible. They
must be open to the possibility that
such a thing can affect them in impor
tant ways and even, perhaps, spur
them into such a radical direction as
social change. But by eliminating that
possibility beforehand the sad fact
becomes true: you are complacent,
self-satisfied and willing to accept
whatever direction some external
source has determined is "proper"
for you to follow. You accept the vi
sion handed you by the status quo.
Way back when I was a senior in
high school, flipping through some of
the vast literature that bombards the
prospective collegian, I came across

something called "The Insider's
Guide to Colleges." Stanford's entry
ran something like this:
"If you're the type who likes to
compete in scholarship and savor the
pleasures of sun and sport, then you'll
be right at home down on the Farm.
But if you're looking for an institu
tion where a true, lively discussion of
ideas and issues are the order of the
day, then you'll be out of place at
Stanford."
"The Insider's Guide" is a Yale
Daily News publication, and so I passed
over such a harsh assessment rather
easily. But now it's a year and a half
later. I'm experienced. I've com
pleted my Western Culture track;
I've excelled in a number of courses;
I've flunked a few others; I've met
enough people floundering around
both academically and personally to
wonder: What is the point of coming
here for an education? Where is the
large, open forum which I crave? Is
Stanford just a prep school for the
upwardly mobile?
In his open letter, David Lempert
refers to the Stanford educational
system as "ossified" — a harsh
criticism, but one offered by someone
sincerely concerned with the state of
learning at this university. I believe it
is incumbent on all of us to take a
look at the issues being raised —
which means The Daily must print
Lempert's article, and any of the
various people concerned enough to
take it seriously must respond to it
and have their responses printed.
Without debate on this issue, and
without a much livelier discussion of
topics essential to our university and
our society Stanford will indeed have
become ossified — anothei tool of
the status quo, a structure without a
vision, a watchfire of complacency.
(Tom Ladd is an undeclared sopho
more. This is his final column.

Recently, an open letter was circ
ulated through various organs of
Stanford. It is an extended work, 30
pages long, t.iking the University to
task for its lack of any real commit
ment to intellectual exchange and the
life of the mind. IJnfortunatley, the
letter is having difficulty getting pub
lished and its author, David hem
pen, is having difficulty being heard.
" The irony of the whole thing,"
says l.empert, ' is that since The
Daily has decided no one's really in
terested in the life or death of ideas
here, it won't publish the letter. It
ends up keeping my ideas
suppressed." and fulfilling its own
prophecy.
"What kind of a school is it whose
paper devotes four pages to sports,
three pages to movie reviews and
only one page to a public forum for
opinions?"
At issue, according to l.empert. is
the variety of outlooks that Stanford
is supposed to represent, without
which the students either bend to
whatevei is expected ol them or lose
anv sense of commitment to under
standing.
Intrigued by the promise that a lack
of diversity on Stanford's part might
be responsible for my own foggy
meanderings through books, lessons
,md life. I took out my portable
notebook and interviewed some
friends. What I found began to in
trigue me even more.

Solomon Hill agreed. "It can be sti

mit that there are certain things that
make people different. There's even a
romanticization of ignorance, with all
the alcohol swimming around frater
nity and dorm parties. You don't get
smarter when you're drunk."
So. among the few students I spoke
to. there was the feeling that, in gen
eral. Stanford students arc painfully
similar in their interests, in their
goals, in their very goal orientations.
And a suspicion arose that those
goals they'd adopted here were just
what "society" or "the status quo"
expected them to.
The irony of this — that students
thought students were too much the

lowing:

radically different from their counter
