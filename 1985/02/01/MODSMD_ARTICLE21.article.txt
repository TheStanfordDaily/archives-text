# Oxford initiates return with mixed views

### CAMERON KALLER Staff writer 
"It's the greatest place on earth.'
said junior John Hillman.
"It turned out as well as the direc
tors had expected," said senior
Wendy Skinner.
"Pubs here are not a place of
decadence — everyone goes," said
senior Cameron Douglas.
"It's easy to study there, said
senior Barb Fitzgerald.
So where is this place that everyone
is talking about? Kansas?
No, Toto, this is the recently
-opened overseas center in Oxford,
England.
Stanford's Overseas Center in
Cliveden was closed a year and a halt
ago, leaving Stanford without a
campus in England until this fall.
The first group ever to be dubbed
"Oxford returnees," as well as those
students still there, give the new pro
gram a favorable appraisal.
"Since it had just opened, there
were definitely bugs that needed to
be worked out. but everybody really
had a good time," said senior Greg
Crawford.
Fitzgerald said, "I definitely liked
being there for the first quarter, be
cause there was no reputation
preceeding us."
"One nice thing is that we basically
can get anything we want at this
point, even a blender if we ask for
one. I think it's because we're guinea
pigs for the program, and they are
trying to be extra nice to us." said
Douglas, in a phone interview trom
Oxford. Douglas is in his second
quarter there.
The program is structured so that
Stanford leases housing space from
Oxford and arranges for students to
dine at several different Oxford col
leges four nights a week.
Stanford-in-Oxford students seem
to agree unanimously with fall retur
nee Ted Tchang that "the food is ab
solutely atrocious."
Fitzgerald added, "There's
definitely a lot of mvstery-meat type
of food."
There are varied reactions,
.however, concerning the ease with
which Stanford students are able to

integrate with the Oxford students.
Hillman, who has been there only
since the start of winter quarter, said
in a phone interview that "there is a
whole lot of opportunity to interact
with the Oxford students."
Crawford, on the other hand, said.
"We weren't very well integrated at
all. yet."
Fitzgerald seemed to agree with
Crawford. "People were wishing that
they were more integrated, especially
since the Oxford students tend to ap
proach Americans with much
reserve," she said.
The attitude of the Oxford students
toward the Stanford students was
reportedly mixed.
"Most Oxfordians automatically
think that if you're an American,
you're 011 a holiday or you're a tourist
unless you prove otherwise,"
Fitzgerald explained. "Also, even
though you're eating with them four
times a week, you're not living with
them, and that makes a lot of differ
ence too."
Crawford said he felt strongly that
"the Oxford students were pretty
cold, and they seemed really skeptical
about our program. A few of them
were really nice, but most seemed
very snobby."
"It is clearly a lot easier to meet
other Americans or Rhodes Scholars
or Canadians and Australians, and so
forth." Crawford said.
Tchang noted, "fortunately there
was 110 language barrier, so we could
at least communicate easily with
everyone."
Skinner also found the Oxford stu
dents "not as open and receptive as
they might be if they knew you were
going to be staying for longer periods
of time."
"You just really have to make an
effort," Skinner said. "They are much
more reserved than Americans, but
they are still receptive to you if you
try."
The academic rigors seem to be on
par with those encountered at Stan
ford, according to all involved with
the program.
The actual Stanford program there
is not inordinately difficult, "but it's
not going to be a joke," according to

Fitzgerald. "Geoffrey is trying very
hard to establish an academic reputa
tion for Stanford," he said referring
to Stanford-in-Oxford Director
Geoffrey Tyack.
For an American, the tutorial sys
tem is an entirely new educational
method.
Douglas explained that "they don't
have a major as we know it. What
English students do is 'read' a so
called major. They simply read
deeply into one field, and that's it."
"Academics at Oxford really is the
culture there," Fitzgerald said. "They
are the central focus, not of the entire
town but of portions of it. It makes it
easy to study there."
The town of Oxford itself seems to
hold only a measured amount of in
terest for the Stanford students.
Many students use their free time on
the weekends for traveling, either
throughout Great Britain or into
nearby countries such as France, Ger
many or Italy.
"Most people are gone six out of
the 10 weekends, I'd say. You don't
want to be gone all the time though,
because a lot really does go on in and
around Oxford. It is a very
manageable area," Fitzgerald said.
"You can get to feel that you 'know'
Oxford pretty well."
"London is farther from Oxford
than San Francisco is from Stanford,
but we really do make a lot more use
of London than Stanford students do
of San Francisco," said Douglas.
As for the local social life, pubs are
the central place for students.
" There's a pub everywhere you
look," said Hillman. There are 33
colleges within Oxford itself, and
each one of them has its own pub. "I
think there's a total of 152 pubs in
Oxford," Fitzgerald said.
"The most memorable experi
ence," Tchang said, "was not seeing
the sun for about six weeks at a
time." But the majority of students
said the most memorable experience
was the travel and the time spent
in the country.
"If I had to give it a letter grade?"
Fitzgerald queried. "Why there's no
doubt in my mind. ... I'd give it an
A."

"One nice thing is that we basically
can get anything we want at this
point, even a blender if we ask for
one. I think it's because we're guinea
pigs for the program, and they are
trying to be extra nice to us." said
Douglas, in a phone interview trom
Oxford. Douglas is in his second
quarter there.
The program is structured so that
Stanford leases housing space from
Oxford and arranges for students to
dine at several different Oxford col
leges four nights a week.
Stanford-in-Oxford students seem
to agree unanimously with fall retur
nee Ted Tchang that "the food is ab
solutely atrocious."
Fitzgerald added, "There's
definitely a lot of mvstery-meat type
of food."
There are varied reactions,
.however, concerning the ease with
which Stanford students are able to

integrate with the Oxford students.
Hillman, who has been there only
since the start of winter quarter, said
in a phone interview that "there is a
whole lot of opportunity to interact
with the Oxford students."
Crawford, on the other hand, said.
"We weren't very well integrated at
all. yet."
Fitzgerald seemed to agree with
Crawford. "People were wishing that
they were more integrated, especially
since the Oxford students tend to ap
proach Americans with much
reserve," she said.
The attitude of the Oxford students
toward the Stanford students was
reportedly mixed.
"Most Oxfordians automatically
think that if you're an American,
you're 011 a holiday or you're a tourist
unless you prove otherwise,"
Fitzgerald explained. "Also, even
though you're eating with them four
times a week, you're not living with
them, and that makes a lot of differ
ence too."
Crawford said he felt strongly that
"the Oxford students were pretty
cold, and they seemed really skeptical
about our program. A few of them
were really nice, but most seemed
very snobby."
"It is clearly a lot easier to meet
other Americans or Rhodes Scholars
or Canadians and Australians, and so
forth." Crawford said.
Tchang noted, "fortunately there
was 110 language barrier, so we could
at least communicate easily with
everyone."
Skinner also found the Oxford stu
dents "not as open and receptive as
they might be if they knew you were
going to be staying for longer periods
of time."
"You just really have to make an
effort," Skinner said. "They are much
more reserved than Americans, but
they are still receptive to you if you
try."
The academic rigors seem to be on
par with those encountered at Stan
ford, according to all involved with
the program.
The actual Stanford program there
is not inordinately difficult, "but it's
not going to be a joke," according to

Fitzgerald. "Geoffrey is trying very
hard to establish an academic reputa
tion for Stanford," he said referring
to Stanford-in-Oxford Director
Geoffrey Tyack.
For an American, the tutorial sys
tem is an entirely new educational
method.
Douglas explained that "they don't
have a major as we know it. What
English students do is 'read' a so
called major. They simply read
deeply into one field, and that's it."
"Academics at Oxford really is the
culture there," Fitzgerald said. "They
are the central focus, not of the entire
town but of portions of it. It makes it
easy to study there."
The town of Oxford itself seems to
hold only a measured amount of in
terest for the Stanford students.
Many students use their free time on
the weekends for traveling, either
throughout Great Britain or into
nearby countries such as France, Ger
many or Italy.
"Most people are gone six out of
the 10 weekends, I'd say. You don't
want to be gone all the time though,
because a lot really does go on in and
around Oxford. It is a very
manageable area," Fitzgerald said.
"You can get to feel that you 'know'
Oxford pretty well."
"London is farther from Oxford
than San Francisco is from Stanford,
but we really do make a lot more use
of London than Stanford students do
of San Francisco," said Douglas.
As for the local social life, pubs are
the central place for students.
" There's a pub everywhere you
look," said Hillman. There are 33
colleges within Oxford itself, and
each one of them has its own pub. "I
think there's a total of 152 pubs in
Oxford," Fitzgerald said.
"The most memorable experi
ence," Tchang said, "was not seeing
the sun for about six weeks at a
time." But the majority of students
said the most memorable experience
was the travel and the time spent
in the country.
"If I had to give it a letter grade?"
Fitzgerald queried. "Why there's no
doubt in my mind. ... I'd give it an
A."


Ted Tchang
Stanford's Overseas Study Center in England is located in Magdalen College, Oxford University. The Center
was moved there this fall from Cliveden, England.
"It's the greatest place on earth.'
said junior John Hillman.
"It turned out as well as the direc
tors had expected," said senior
Wendy Skinner.
"Pubs here are not a place of
decadence — everyone goes," said
senior Cameron Douglas.
"It's easy to study there, said
senior Barb Fitzgerald.
So where is this place that everyone
is talking about? Kansas?
No, Toto, this is the recently
-opened overseas center in Oxford,
England.
Stanford's Overseas Center in
Cliveden was closed a year and a halt
ago, leaving Stanford without a
campus in England until this fall.
The first group ever to be dubbed
"Oxford returnees," as well as those
students still there, give the new pro
gram a favorable appraisal.
"Since it had just opened, there
were definitely bugs that needed to
be worked out. but everybody really
had a good time," said senior Greg
Crawford.
Fitzgerald said, "I definitely liked
being there for the first quarter, be
cause there was no reputation
preceeding us."
"One nice thing is that we basically
can get anything we want at this
