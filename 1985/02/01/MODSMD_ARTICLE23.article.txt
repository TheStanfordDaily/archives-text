# Ducks spoil Cardinal's return home
## Stanford can't catch Oregon in final minutes 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
Opportunity came knocking on the Stanford men's bas
ketball team's door last night. No one answered it.
Stanford had a chance to beat the University of Oregon.
It didn t, 61-54. And because Arizona State University
lost to Washington State Univeristy last night, Stanford
had a chance to move into a tie with the Sun Devils for
fifth place in the Pacific 10 Conference
Instead, the Cardinal fell to 2-6 in the Pac-10 and into a
ninth-place tie with the University of California at
Berkeley. The Ducks, meanwhile, improved to 3-5 in the
conference, and they're the ones tied with Arizona State
for fifth.
Now the Cardinal gets nationally ranked Oregon State,
which lost to Cat last night, its second straight setback.
The Beavers, Pac-10 champs four of the last five years,
lose three in a row about as often as they lose two in a row
or even one. Not very.
So you might say that Stanford took the wrong elevator
last night — the one going down.
"We did (lose an opportunity)," said guard John Paye,
who scored a career-high 15 points. "That was the most
depressed we've been this year (in the lockerroom). We
had a chance to win the game while the other top teams in
the Pac-10 lost."
Although Stanford muffed a few chances to tie the
game in the closing minutes, the Cardinal lost this one at
the beginning of the second half. Stanford took a 31-30
lead at halftime, only to lose it — for good — in the early
moments of the second half.
Stanford failed to score on its first three possessions of
the half, while Oregon was successful on three of it first
four. An eight-footer by Mike Matheson, a layup by 7-
foot Blair Rasmussen and a baseline jumper by Rick Os
born gave the Ducks a 36-31 advantage. In a game where
no team led by more than seven, a five-point lead was
plenty commanding.
"It was going to be a close game, you could see that
from the outset," Stanford Coach Tom Davis said. "So it
was critical that they got that lead early in the second half
and we didn't."
The Cardinal, however, battled back to within two with
just under nine minutes left when Andy Fischer hit a 19-
footer from the left corner. The teams traded baskets
before a lane violation against Oregon discounted a free
throw made by Duck forward Greg Trapp with 5:48
remaining. Stanford had the ball with a chance to tie, and
Davis called a timeout.
"We thought we had that post-up play to either Kent
(Seymour) or Earl (Koberlein) coming across (the
middle)," Davis said. "We thought that was going to be
open, and I think it was."
Open or not, the ball never got there. Cardinal forward
Charles Hunt threw a low bounce pass inside that scooted

John Paye was Stanford's only player in double figures as he scored 15 points. But the sophomore's effort
wasn't enough to prevent what he called the Cardinal's most depressing loss of the season.
off someone's foot and rolled toward
midcourt. Oregon's Chris Harper
picked up the loose ball and a minute
later, the Ducks worked it to a wide
open Osborn. who hit the 18-footer
that made it 50-46.
Stanford had one last chance with
42 seconds left. After Osborn missed
the front end of a one-and-one, Fis
cher followed in a missed shot at the
other end of the court to narrow it to
56-54.
Davis called a timeout to set up the
defense, but Oregon Coach Don
Monson used it to set up an inbounds
play. Monson's play broke the Card
inal's press and resulted in two free
throws for Trapp with 0:36 to go.
Trapp made the second charity at
tempt and 22 seconds later. Osborn
iced it with a pair of free throws. Jerry
Adams' flying two-hand dunk at the
buzzer was the finishing touch — the
second time this season a team has
ended the game in such a manner
against the Cardinal.
"I think the difference in the bal-
Iclubs is that they have three experi
enced seniors," Davis said of the
Ducks, who for the most part used
only six players. "We have two
seniors that are playing for the first

time this year."
Another difference was the play of
Osborn, a freshman who was
recruited by Stanford. Osborn hit 7-
of-10 shots and scored a game- and
career-high 16 points, nearly all of
them shooting over a Stanford zone
defense sagging on Rasmussen.
As a tearr Oregon shot 56.5 per
cent from i!k floor, including 65 per
cent in the second half.

later, the Ducks worked it to a wide
open Osborn. who hit the 18-footer
that made it 50-46.
Stanford had one last chance with
42 seconds left. After Osborn missed
the front end of a one-and-one, Fis
cher followed in a missed shot at the
other end of the court to narrow it to
56-54.
Davis called a timeout to set up the
defense, but Oregon Coach Don
Monson used it to set up an inbounds
play. Monson's play broke the Card
inal's press and resulted in two free
throws for Trapp with 0:36 to go.
Trapp made the second charity at
tempt and 22 seconds later. Osborn
iced it with a pair of free throws. Jerry
Adams' flying two-hand dunk at the
buzzer was the finishing touch — the
second time this season a team has
ended the game in such a manner
against the Cardinal.
"I think the difference in the bal-
Iclubs is that they have three experi
enced seniors," Davis said of the
Ducks, who for the most part used
only six players. "We have two
seniors that are playing for the first

time this year."
Another difference was the play of
Osborn, a freshman who was
recruited by Stanford. Osborn hit 7-
of-10 shots and scored a game- and
career-high 16 points, nearly all of
them shooting over a Stanford zone
defense sagging on Rasmussen.
As a tearr Oregon shot 56.5 per
cent from i!k floor, including 65 per
cent in the second half.
Opportunity came knocking on the Stanford men's bas
ketball team's door last night. No one answered it.
Stanford had a chance to beat the University of Oregon.
It didn t, 61-54. And because Arizona State University
lost to Washington State Univeristy last night, Stanford
had a chance to move into a tie with the Sun Devils for
fifth place in the Pacific 10 Conference
Instead, the Cardinal fell to 2-6 in the Pac-10 and into a
ninth-place tie with the University of California at
Berkeley. The Ducks, meanwhile, improved to 3-5 in the
conference, and they're the ones tied with Arizona State
for fifth.
Now the Cardinal gets nationally ranked Oregon State,
which lost to Cat last night, its second straight setback.
The Beavers, Pac-10 champs four of the last five years,
lose three in a row about as often as they lose two in a row
or even one. Not very.
So you might say that Stanford took the wrong elevator
last night — the one going down.
"We did (lose an opportunity)," said guard John Paye,
who scored a career-high 15 points. "That was the most
depressed we've been this year (in the lockerroom). We
had a chance to win the game while the other top teams in
the Pac-10 lost."
Although Stanford muffed a few chances to tie the
game in the closing minutes, the Cardinal lost this one at
the beginning of the second half. Stanford took a 31-30
lead at halftime, only to lose it — for good — in the early
moments of the second half.
Stanford failed to score on its first three possessions of
the half, while Oregon was successful on three of it first
four. An eight-footer by Mike Matheson, a layup by 7-
foot Blair Rasmussen and a baseline jumper by Rick Os
born gave the Ducks a 36-31 advantage. In a game where
no team led by more than seven, a five-point lead was
plenty commanding.
"It was going to be a close game, you could see that
from the outset," Stanford Coach Tom Davis said. "So it
was critical that they got that lead early in the second half
and we didn't."
The Cardinal, however, battled back to within two with
just under nine minutes left when Andy Fischer hit a 19-
footer from the left corner. The teams traded baskets
before a lane violation against Oregon discounted a free
throw made by Duck forward Greg Trapp with 5:48
remaining. Stanford had the ball with a chance to tie, and
Davis called a timeout.
"We thought we had that post-up play to either Kent
(Seymour) or Earl (Koberlein) coming across (the
middle)," Davis said. "We thought that was going to be
open, and I think it was."
Open or not, the ball never got there. Cardinal forward
Charles Hunt threw a low bounce pass inside that scooted

John Paye was Stanford's only player in double figures as he scored 15 points. But the sophomore's effort
wasn't enough to prevent what he called the Cardinal's most depressing loss of the season.
