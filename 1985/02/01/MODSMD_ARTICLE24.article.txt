# OSU drops Pac-10 lead; faces Stanford tomorrow
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
Oregon State University basketball Coach Ralph Miller
is a perfect picture of a crotchety old man.
He has grey hair, wears wire-rimmed glasses and chain
smokes. He sits quietly on the bench, legs crossed, until
one of his players does something wrong â€” then he gets
red in the face and spouts off one of his sarcastic lines.
But Miller can also coach basketball. His team does it
by the book. Fundamentals. Two-hand chest passes. Jump
stops. Physical screens. In-the-jock-strap defense.
And, oh yeah. Miller's team wins. A lot.
Miller, the second-winningest active coach in the Na
tional Collegiate Athletic Association with 594 career vic
tories, has coached 33 seasons. Only two of them were
losing affairs. His teams produce great players, they
graduate, and the Beavers still win.
So it comes as no surprise that the Beavers, who
visit Stanford tomorrow at 3 p.m., are among.the
Pacific 10 Conference leaders once again. Never mind
that three-time AII-Pac-10 forward Charlie Sitton and
guard Alan Tait, who started all 29 games last season,
graduated and 6-foot-7 sophomore star Rick Berry trans
ferred. This is Oregon State, which wins like its coach
smokes.
The Beavers are 15-3 overall and tied for second place
in the Pac-10 with a 5-2 record. They are ranked 12th by
United Press International and 14th by the Associated
Press. Had the Beavers not been upset at home by
Arizona State University Saturday and lost, 42-36, to
the University of California at Berkeley last night, they'd
be undefeated in the Pac-10 and ranked in the top 10.
"What happened to Oregon State last week?" Miller
asked himself in his most sacastic tone. "The answer is
simple. The answer is we got beat by a team that played a
better basketball game than we did."
The loss kept the Beavers from running away with the
Pac-10 title they have won four of the last five years. And,
according to Miller, it forced them to take each opponent
seriously, no matter what its record.
Concerning Stanford, 2-6 in the conference, Miller had
this to say: "I think they play a type of game that is tough
to play, tough to meet. They will come into the game cer
tainly feeling better (after the Cardinal's 60-54 upset over
the University of Southern California Monday) than
they did. I certainly appreciatated Stanford's win at USC.
That was nice."
The victory knocked the Trojans out of a first-place tie
with Oregon State, and if Stanford hopes to do it again to
morrow, it will have to stop 6-9 forward A.C. Green, last
season's Pac-10 Player of the Year. Green, who averages
in double figures in both scoring and rebounding this
season, is Oregon State's fifth all-time scorer and fourth
all-time rebounder.
"I feel A.C. has definitely improved his talents over last
