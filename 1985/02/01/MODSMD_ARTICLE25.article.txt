# Women netters open season
## 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
As the Stanford women's tennis team heads into
its first league match against Cal State Fullerton
this afternoon, higher goals and higher team hopes
for this season are virtually impossible to set.
The reason is Stanford can't do any better this
year than last. Not many teams can expect to better
a 26-0 record and a National Collegiate Athletic
Association Championship, and to say that Stan
lord women's tennis dominated the collegiate scene
in 1984 is, put mildly, an understatement.
In 17 of the Cardinal's 26 matches last year, the
opponent won one or none of the total nine
matches, and only twice during the entire season
did an opponent score four wins in a match. In the
end, six Cardinal players were named to the All-
America team.
The Cardinal was so dominating in the NCAA
championship match against USC that the match
was called after Stanford took an insurmountable
lead by winning all of the six singles matches.
This season, Stanford is without three of the Ail-
Americans, but has gained freshmen Anna Ivan,
Kay Tittle and Cari Hagey. Along with returning
All-Americans Linda Gates, Patty Fendick and
Leigh Anne Eldredge and veteran players Step
hanie Savides and Alyce Werdel, Stanford is No. 1
in the Intercollegiate Tennis Coaches Association

preseason poll.
Stanford Coach Frank Brennan will naturally
miss the play of Elise Burgin, Kate Gompert and
Michelle Weiss, but he is far from pessimistic about
the possibility of a fourth NCAA title.
"Whenever you lose players (like Burgin, Gom
pert and Weiss), more than anything you're going
to miss their experience and stability. But we were
fortunate to have an outstanding recruiting year. I
may have, and only time will tell, recruited the tal
ent to replace them. I haven't, obviously, recruited
the experience. . . . We are a young team, but I am
extremely optimistic and comfortable with this
team," Brennan said.
In the preseason ITCA singles rankings. Gates,
Fendick, Ivan and Eldredge were all ranked in the
top nine nationally. Tittle and Hagey are ranked
No. 25 and No. 35, respectively.
Leading Stanford is three-time Ail-American
Gates. She is the No. 2 player in the nation in
preseason polls and last year won the NCAA
doubles title with Burgin, along with being the
NCAA singles runnerup.
"I think the team looks up to her because she has
accomplished so much in collegiate tennis," Bren
nan said. Other starting singles players will include
Fendick. Eldredge and freshman Ivan, according to
Brennan. Competing for the No. 5 and No. 6 spots

are Werdel Savides, Tittle and Hagey.
Brennan said the tight lineup is a sign of the
Cardinal's depth. With eight "solid" players, Bren
nan will net mind a change of lineup in case of in
jury or illness
Only thi doubles teams remain to be decided.
"We lost three starters and sometimes it's harder to
replace doubles players than singles players be
cause the\ have to work as a team. I'm not so sure
we replaced the doubles talent we lost. I think we
have sonn question marks when we have three
freshmen starting — which we may have."
In the three doubles matches against Cal State
Fullerton, Brennan is playing doubles teams of
Gates and Fldredge, Tittle and Savides, and An
nette Shelbv and Susan Ross. Cal State Fullerton
placed last in the Western Collegiate Athletic As
sociation in IMS 4.
"Cal State Fullerton is not a real powerhouse,
but they are a fairly substantial team," Brennan
said. "It'll give me a chance to put in some less ex
perienced players," he said.
Today's matches begin at 1:30 p.m. at the Var
sity Courts
On Tuesday, Stanford will play another home
match against the University of the Pacific before
going to Houston. Texas to play in the ITCA Na
tional Indoor Singles Championship Feb. 7-10.
