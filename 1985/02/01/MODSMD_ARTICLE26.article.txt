# Easy weekend ahead for men and women fencers

The Stanford men's and women's fencing teams get a
repeat performance and face some fresh blood tomorrow
as the men take on the University of San Francisco, the
women take on San Francisco State and both face the
University of Texas, San Antonio.
The three-way matches will all be held at USF. The
men, now 11-1 overall, beat the Dons, 19-8, in November
in Stanford's first official match of season. Stanford Coach
Buzz Hurst doesn't expect this time to be any different.
Texas is in both its first year of varsity competition and

its first varsity meet. The team is coached by former Stan
ford fencer Harvey Cain and, according to Hurst
reportedly has a good epee team. But it doesn't have a
sabre team and thus will forfeit nine matches from the
beginning. Hurst expects an easy victory.
The women defeated San Francisco State, 9-7 earlier
this season. Hurst expects the same result, especially be
cause team leader Jennifer Yu, who didn't compete the
first time, will play this time. Holly Taylor will also return
to action after suffering a pulled hamstring last week
Hurst expects about the same out of the Texas women's
team as its men's team.
