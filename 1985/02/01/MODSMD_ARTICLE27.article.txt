# Gymnasts must increase scores
## Men take on UC Davis 
### CAROLYN TARKINGTON Staff sportswriter 
The men's gymnastics team will
travel to meet the Aggies of the
University of California at Davis
tomorrow in what Coach Sadao
Hamada predicts will be an eas\
competition for the Cardinal.
Hamada's prediction comes
despite the fact that Davis has
finished in the top three teams in
the National Collegiate Athletic

Association Division II champion
ships each of the past few years.

Division I
"We are hoping for a team score
of about -"3.00 or better."
Hamada said "We are at a very
crucial point in the season. Our top
five scores of the season count
toward NCAA qualification and we
have seven meets left. Team scores
will be really important in all of our
coming meets."

As of Jan. 6, the Cardinal men
were ranked 16th in the nation, but
have since moved up to 13th.
"It was our last couple of meet
scores that moved us up," Hamada
said. "We have been scoring higher
team totals than at this time last
year, but in order to hope for an
NCAA bid we need to start scoring
totals three or four points better
than we are now. We have the po
tential to do it."
