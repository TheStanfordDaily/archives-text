# Defeated Cal Wednesday night
## Men spikers face Matadors 
### ROB GRAHAM Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford men's volleyball team, hot off its
weekend triumph in the Santa Barbara/Michelob
l ight Invitational and its victory over the Univer
sity of California at Berkeley Wednesday night,
starts its league schedule tonight against Cal State
Northridge at 7:30 p.m. in Maples Pavillion.
One would think that the Cardinal, ranked sixth
nationally in the most recent coaches' poll, would
enter tonight's game with overflowing confidence,
but one has to wonder if they can recapture the
level of play they reached in Santa Barbara.
Wednesday's game with Cal is reason for con
cern. Stanford was extended to five sets in the five
set match against a Golden Bear team that plays at
the club level.
After taking the first set 15-8, the Cardinal went
into a slumber. It dropped the next two sets by
scores of 2-15 and 7-15. "They started playing
great and things weren't going well for us," Co-
Coach Don Shaw said.
At that point, Stanford regained its concentra
tion. "We knew there would be a letdown (after the

Santa Ba r bara tournament), but when we were
down 2-1 we kind of steadied. (Jon) Root and
(Scott) Fortune really picked it up. We cruised in
the last two games," Shaw said.
The coach derived some satisfaction from the
Berkeley match. "It was good for us to play up
there. We have to get used to playing on the road,"
he said. What's more, he saw the comeback as
evidence of a new era in Stanford volleyball.
Paraphrasing Co-Coach Fred Sturm's post-game
talk, Shaw said that "in years past that might have
been a match we might have lost. But with our con
fidence, we were able to hang tough."
The Cardinal carries that confidence into
tonight's league opener with the Northridge
Matadors. But Shaw felt that it was essential that
his squad enter the game with the proper attitude.
"There is no team in this league that we can rest
against. The league is as balanced as it's ever been.
Every team is capable," he said.
And Northridge, a team Stanford defeated twice
last year, seems to be much improved. In both
matches last year, the Matadors took the Cardinal

to tour sets. Moreover, they finished seventh last
weekend in the Santa Barbara invite against a 20-
team field which included six schools ranked in the
nation's top 10.
Shaw considers Northridge a "scrappy team, a
good team. We expect them to he real tough." The
most formidable task for Stanford will be shutting
down Northridge's middle blocker, 6-foot-7 Dave
Schaefer. Schaefer led the California Intercol
legiate Volleyball Association (OVA) in both hit
ting percentage and blocking last year.
Consistency and execution will be integral for
Cardinal success, Shaw said. "We have to play at a
high level irregardless of how the other team is
playing. We have to run the offense efficiently.
We've been a little sloppy, so we'll stick with the
basic things we do best," he said.
Although there are no major injuries to report,
Shaw was concerned with a virus that's been going
around. "Some guys are coming down with the bug
and are under the weather," he said. Outside Hitter
Chris Braun, for instance, did not make the trip to
Berkeley. In any case, Shaw did not expect the flu
to impair his team's play.
