### PETER CASTILLO Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford wrestling team closes
its home dual-meet season tomorrow
in Maples Pavilion at 5 p.m. against
Cal State Bakersfield. The Cardinal is
coming off two fine performances and
hopes to carry the momentum against
Bakersfield.
"Cal State Bakersfield is a compa
rable team to Fresno (State Univer
sity). If we have a good match, we'll
give it a go," Stanford Coach Chris
Horpel said. "We match up better
against Bakersfield than Fresno and
we only trailed them by four-and-a
half points in the All-Cal Invita

tional."
The Cardinal's second-place finish
in the All-Cal Invitational was its best
ever; the team lost a close match, 22-
17, to a strong Fresno State team.
During these two meets the team has
generated a lot of internal momen
tum and Horpel said that the
wrestlers are excited to compete.
Stanford has a 5-5-1 dual-meet
record.
Cardinal wrestlers did well against
Bakersfield wrestlers in the All-Cal
Invitational. Jeff Bradley (134
pounds) defeated John Martin, and
Scott Wiggen (142 pounds) beat Ray

Hammond in the semifinals. In a
close match Dave Lee (167 pounds)
was victorious over Howard Lawson
in the finals and so were Tom Mullen
(177 pounds) and Kurt Kassulke
(190 pounds) against their
Bakersfield opponents.
Stanford's Neil Wartnik (126
pounds) lost to Mortezi Abedi, who
was the eventual champion, and Pete
Rogers (158 pounds) to Ardeshir As
gari in the finals. Abedi and Asgari
are both from Iran and enrolled in
Bakersfield last year. Horpel
describes them as excellent and ex
tremely tough freestyle wrestlers, the

type who play in the Olympics.
Horpel said that things look good
with the team right now and it's right
on schedule heading to the Pacific 10
Championships on March 3. An im
portant part of the team's progress
has been its positive attitude.
"I am constantly working on it
(attitude), but ultimately it rests on
the wrestlers. Most athletics are
mostly attitude and secondly talent
and technique," Horpel said. "Many
coaches make the mistake of ignoring
psychological factors. They work on
technique but overlook the mental
aspect."
