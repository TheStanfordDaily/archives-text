# Cuomo to talk at graduation
## Site decision imminent 
### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
New York Gov. Mario Cuomo,
the fiery keynote speaker at
last summer's Democratic National
Convention, will deliver the com
mencement address at Stanford's
1985 graduation ceremonies on June
16.
Cuomo was the first choice of a
seven-member University com
mencement panel. Other top choices
included novelist John Irving, science
fiction writer Ray Bradbury, ABC
anchorman Ted Koppel and former
Secretary of Education Shirley
Hufstedler.
The University extended the invi
tation to Cuomo in December. On
Wednesday, Leslie Stern, Cuomo's
director of scheduling, informed Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy's
office that the governor had accepted
the offer to speak.
In related news, University officials
will meet today with the four senior
class presidents to discuss the site of
the commencement exercises. Last
year, graduation was held in Sunken
Diamond when University officials
determined that Frost Amphitheater
— the site of commencement
ceremonies since 1937 — was too
small for the event.
Marlene Wine, special assistant to
Kennedy, said Sunken Diamond,
Stanford Stadium and the Oval are
under consideration for the June

ceremonies. l ast year, officials also
narrowed down the site choice to
these three locations, and Kennedy
selected the baseball diamond aftei
members of the senior class spoke out

strongly against the stadium.
"Lots of universities have com
mencement in their stadiums," 1 Wine
said yesterday. "We've thought of
ways that it can be creatively done."
Wine said she hopes a site can be
agreed upon today.
