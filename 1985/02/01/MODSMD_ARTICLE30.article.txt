# Women hoopsters face tough weekend in L.A.
## 
### JOHN LIS Staff sportswriter 
. It's back to the big time this
weekend for the Stanford women's
basketball team as the Cardinal
returns to conference action in Los
Angeles against UCLA tonight and at
Long Beach State tomorrow.
Stanford, 9-8 overall, has won its
last four games. Those wins, however,
came against the seventh- and eighth
place teams in the Western Collegiate
Athletic Association, the University
of Arizona and Arizona State Uni
versity, and two non-conference
teams, the University of the Pacific
and St. Mary's College.
The Cardinal, currently 2-2 and in
fifth place in the WCAA, will face a
more difficult challenge this
weekend. UCLA is 2-3 in the confer
ence and 11-8 overall, but all of its
conference losses have been to top
-25 teams. Long Beach State is the
conference leader at 4-0 and is
ranked third in the country with a 14-
1 record through yesterday.
"If we get 70 points, we can give
either of them a good game," Stan
ford Coach Dotty McCrea said.
"My main concern is the tempo.
They both like to run. We can't get
into a running game, and we have to
get back defensively. Quickness is
what wears us down."
UCLA enters tonight's game com
ing off a 76-50 loss to No. 4-ranked
Louisiana Tech University Tuesday.
In their last conference games last
weekend, the Bruins defeated
Arizona State, 97-61, and Arizona
82-68.
The sixth-place Bruins are paced
by 5-foot-10 junior guard Anne
Dean. She is averaging 13.4 points
and has hit 42 of her 45 free throws to
rank among the nation's leaders at 89
percent.

Annette Keur, a 6-4 sophomore
center from the Netherlands, is
averaging 12.9 points and 7.1
rebounds. She has 16 blocked shots
this season and is shooting 51 percent
from the field.
The Bruins also have Jackie
Joyner, the 1984 Olympic silver
medalist in the heptathalon, playing
basketball. Joyner, a 5-10 senior for
ward, is averaging 12.8 points and 8.1
rebounds.
Freshman Jaime Brown has come
on for UCLA in recent games. After
missing the first two weeks of the
season with a stress fracture, she
scored 20 points against Arizona
State and 22 against Arizona last
weekend.
"They're quicker than we are,"
McCrea said. "They have some
people who can get up and down the
floor."
Long Beach preserved its No. 3
ranking last night, beating Louisiana
Tech, 81-67. Prior to that, the
49ers beat Arizona 86-67 and
Arizona State 95-78 last weekend in
conference play. Long Beach's only
loss was at then-No. 1 ranked Old
Dominion University 84-71.
Cindy Brown, a 6-2 sophomore
forward, leads the 49ers with 21.6
points and 10 rebounds per game.
She had 32 points against Arizona
and followed that with 35 at ASU.
Kirsten Cummings, a 6-3 senior
center, is averaging 16.5 points and
10.1 rebounds, and 5-9 senior guard
Jackie White is averaging 15.1 points.
Long Beach has eight letterwomen
back, including three starters. The
49ers lead the nation in scoring at
91.1 points an outing, and they are
shooting at a 53 percent rate. Long
Beach set a school scoring record in
defeating UCLA 118-65 earlier this
year.
