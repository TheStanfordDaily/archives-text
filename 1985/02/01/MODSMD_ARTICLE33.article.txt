## ‘Top Girls' undeniably well-written 
### NANCY HENRY 
Eureka Theatre Company has
chosen Caryl Churchill's "Top Girls,"
a play which contrasts historical and
contemporary conceptions and ap
proaches to success, to open its new
performance space at 2760 16th St. in
Han Francisco. The choice is a good
Ine. T he play explores the position of
women in radically different cultures
and time periods and parallels the
sacrifices they made to "success" with
those men and women must make in
Society today. The Eureka company
jpas staged a technically precise,
Smoothly flowing and powerfully
acted play. The quality of the produc
tion invites total absorption in the
fich themes and compelling charac-

Japanese courtesan and mistress to
the emperor; Dull Gret, who, in a
painting by Brueghel, leads women
into battle against the devils of hell;
and a ninth-century woman who, dis
guised as a man, gained her education
through the church and maintained
her charade to reign for twelve years
as Pope Joan. Together the seven
members of the party eat, drink and
talk in a manner which masterfully
develops each as a representative of
her culture and time. Dull Gret eats
potatoes with a fork, Nijo holds her
cup timidly with both hands and Pope
Joan generously partakes of the wine
while spewing forth the doctrines of
Aquinas, in English and Latin . It is

Bters which combine to create a grip
iping and socially relevant play.
F The first scene is undoubtably the
Imost intriguing and serves as a prem
ise for the following four. It creates
jan impression that the audience can-
Jnot help but recall upon seeing the
,'jsame actresses and same situations,
however altered their guise, through
. out the rest of the play. Marlene,
played by Lorri Holt, an ambitious
and "successful" career woman, is the
unifying thread to the otherwise dis
parate scenes. When the play opens
I she is preparing for a dinner party,
tone to which a curious mix of guests

learn the true stories behind the os
tensibly splendid successes of the
heroines. Each has her secrets: rapes,
abortions, psychological and physical
abuse. And each, with the notable ex
ception of Marlene, accepts her own
position. The irony of the following
scenes proves to be the sacrifices
Marlene made in the name of her
career, and the structure of the play
leads us to see the similarities.
Following the dinner party, we see
the employment office where Mar
lene works and the type of work she
does: coaching women in just what it
takes to reach and stay at the top. In a
series of interviews, we see modern
women who have given up many of
the same basic elements of their

humanity as their ancestors: family,
integrity, individuality, even their
very womanhood. The issue of
children and inheritance is a major
one. Many of the atrocities suffered
by the women of history are directly
related to their children, and it is the
question of loyalty and responsibilty
to family that the second half of the
play powerfully and disturbingly
raises.

This is a complex play, perhaps not
integrated enough in a final analysis,
but it is undeniably well-written, im
aginative and important. Some of the
acting is outstanding. Sigrid
Wurschmidt as Dull Gret and then as
Angie, the victimized child in ques
tion, gives perhaps the most poignant
performance — tragic yet often
hilarious, she captures the frustration,
suppressed emotion and innocence of

a woman who does not have "what it
takes" to attain success in the con
ventional sense. Nancy Palmer Jones
demonstrates amazing versatility,
switching from a prim and proper
19th century British explorer to the
stubbornly proud, quietly suffering
housewife sister of Marlene. Abigail
Van Alyn also deserves note for her
erudite, mannish and comic Pope
Joan.

The play holds our attention due to
the depth of its subject matter and the
polish of its performances. Tightly
and professionally directed, it drags
only at the end, a problem of the
script and not the production. "Top
Girls" runs through Feb. 24. It is
an exciting and promising beginning
to what could prove to be a
future of innovative, intelligent, well
produced theater at the Eureka.
