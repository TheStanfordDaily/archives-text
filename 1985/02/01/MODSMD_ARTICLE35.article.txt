Madera Makes Music presented
he blues pianist Mark Naftalin
Tuesday night in the Madera Lounge,
rhe little-publicized affair took place
n front of about 45 people, most ol
.vhom were from the dorm itself. In
>pite of the sparse crowd, Mark Naf
talin managed to put on an invigorat
ing display of blues piano at its
traditional best.
Naftalin, who was raised in Min
neapolis, Minn., has played with
some of the real heavyweights of the
blues/rock scene. He was the original
keyboardist for the legendary Paul
Butterfield Blues Band in the 19605,
and he also teamed up with the im
mortal guitarist Mike Bloomfield for
several years. He now plays largely at
Bay Area clubs and has a short show
on radio statio KALN every Monday
night. The glamour and popularity
that was once enjoyed by such blues
masters in the '60s and early '70s is
long gone, but as Naftalin clearly
showed on Tuesday night, the music
definitely remains.
It was obvious from the start of his
first song that Naftalin "had it." He
opened with an unnamed blues num
ber that pretty much set the tone for
the concert. Naftalin established in
this first song the traditional blues
formula that he was to follow the rest
of the evening.
Naftalin's recipe entails first defin
ing clearly the song's main "theme"
right at the beginning. Then once the
underlying melody is set, Naftalin
goes into his own improvisation
realm where the blues really live.

With eyes closed and fingers flying,
Nafialin twists and teases the song's
original melody into a thousand and
two contorted shapes, leaving it up to
the listener to choose to he carried
away on the soul-wrenching journey
that characterizes good blues. And. of
course, before finishing, he always
brings us back from this journey by
once again finding the song's original
melody.
During the course of the two-part,
two-hour-long concert, Naftalin
played a variety of numbers, ranging
from gut-wrenching slow songs to up
beat boogie-woogie tunes. An early
highlight of the show was Naf
talin's own version of the famous
"CC Rider." This boppin' tune >vith
its upbeat, familiar melody was a def
inite crowd-pleaser. Toward the end
of the first set, he played two if-only
my-baby-would-take-me-back-type
numbers that were done in the 1940s
Chicago blues style. He played them
slowly and beautifully, neither com
promising nor exaggerating the emo
tions that the songs required.
Although Naftalin's voice was
clearly not up to par with the excel
lence of his piano playing, his vocals
did serve to add to the atmosphere
that he created on the piano.
Whether the songs were his own com
positions ("Groundskeeper's Blues,"
"Blues for Special People") or writ
ten by others ("Georgia," "Kansas
City") the results were always
pleasantly good. However, it was the
traditional slow, down-and-out
depressing blues numbers, like

"Lucinda" and "Walk On By," that
brought out the best in Naftalin. With
the right hand a blur on the keys,
Naftalin's improvisations flowed
naturally, evoking the characteristic
worthless/depressive emotions that
only real blues can hope to call forth.
Naftalin chose to close his second
set with his own version of a country
western tune. At that point in the
show, it seemed as it the number of
people left in the audience was di
rectly proportional to the number of
songs remaining in the concert. Un
daunted by this paucity of blues fans,
he did a marvelous 10-minute-jam
version of Floyd Kramer's "Last
Day." Like usual. Naftalin wasted
little time in setting down the song's
melody and getting to the customary
improvisational portion of the song.
Once there, he set off on beautiful
tangents, mixing and building
repetitive lines, playing sometimes
slowly, sometimes quickly, yet always
in the great blues style that is a
trademark of his music. After a
return to the song's original melody,
he ended the song and the concert
with an imposing crescendo, leaving
the listener quite suddenly with the
task of dealing with the fact that the
music was over.
Good blues is not easy to pull off. It
isn't written down on a music sheet
that can be nicely followed. Mark
Naftalin showed on Tuesday night,
like he has been showing for the past
20 years, that he knows how to play
the blues. And there doesn't seem to
be too many people like that around
anymore.

worthless/depressive emotions that
only real blues can hope to call forth.
Naftalin chose to close his second
set with his own version of a country
western tune. At that point in the
show, it seemed as it the number of
people left in the audience was di
rectly proportional to the number of
songs remaining in the concert. Un
daunted by this paucity of blues fans,
he did a marvelous 10-minute-jam
version of Floyd Kramer's "Last
Day." Like usual. Naftalin wasted
little time in setting down the song's
melody and getting to the customary
improvisational portion of the song.
Once there, he set off on beautiful
tangents, mixing and building
repetitive lines, playing sometimes
slowly, sometimes quickly, yet always
in the great blues style that is a
trademark of his music. After a
return to the song's original melody,
he ended the song and the concert
with an imposing crescendo, leaving
the listener quite suddenly with the
task of dealing with the fact that the
music was over.
Good blues is not easy to pull off. It
isn't written down on a music sheet
that can be nicely followed. Mark
Naftalin showed on Tuesday night,
like he has been showing for the past
20 years, that he knows how to play
the blues. And there doesn't seem to
be too many people like that around
anymore.

Madera Makes Music presented
he blues pianist Mark Naftalin
Tuesday night in the Madera Lounge,
rhe little-publicized affair took place
n front of about 45 people, most ol
.vhom were from the dorm itself. In
>pite of the sparse crowd, Mark Naf
talin managed to put on an invigorat
ing display of blues piano at its
traditional best.
Naftalin, who was raised in Min
neapolis, Minn., has played with
some of the real heavyweights of the
blues/rock scene. He was the original
keyboardist for the legendary Paul
Butterfield Blues Band in the 19605,
and he also teamed up with the im
mortal guitarist Mike Bloomfield for
several years. He now plays largely at
Bay Area clubs and has a short show
on radio statio KALN every Monday
night. The glamour and popularity
that was once enjoyed by such blues
masters in the '60s and early '70s is
long gone, but as Naftalin clearly
showed on Tuesday night, the music
definitely remains.
It was obvious from the start of his
first song that Naftalin "had it." He
opened with an unnamed blues num
ber that pretty much set the tone for
the concert. Naftalin established in
this first song the traditional blues
formula that he was to follow the rest
of the evening.
Naftalin's recipe entails first defin
ing clearly the song's main "theme"
right at the beginning. Then once the
underlying melody is set, Naftalin
goes into his own improvisation
realm where the blues really live.

With eyes closed and fingers flying,
Nafialin twists and teases the song's
original melody into a thousand and
two contorted shapes, leaving it up to
the listener to choose to he carried
away on the soul-wrenching journey
that characterizes good blues. And. of
course, before finishing, he always
brings us back from this journey by
once again finding the song's original
melody.
During the course of the two-part,
two-hour-long concert, Naftalin
played a variety of numbers, ranging
from gut-wrenching slow songs to up
beat boogie-woogie tunes. An early
highlight of the show was Naf
talin's own version of the famous
"CC Rider." This boppin' tune >vith
its upbeat, familiar melody was a def
inite crowd-pleaser. Toward the end
of the first set, he played two if-only
my-baby-would-take-me-back-type
numbers that were done in the 1940s
Chicago blues style. He played them
slowly and beautifully, neither com
promising nor exaggerating the emo
tions that the songs required.
Although Naftalin's voice was
clearly not up to par with the excel
lence of his piano playing, his vocals
did serve to add to the atmosphere
that he created on the piano.
Whether the songs were his own com
positions ("Groundskeeper's Blues,"
"Blues for Special People") or writ
ten by others ("Georgia," "Kansas
City") the results were always
pleasantly good. However, it was the
traditional slow, down-and-out
depressing blues numbers, like

"Lucinda" and "Walk On By," that
brought out the best in Naftalin. With
the right hand a blur on the keys,
Naftalin's improvisations flowed
naturally, evoking the characteristic
worthless/depressive emotions that
only real blues can hope to call forth.
