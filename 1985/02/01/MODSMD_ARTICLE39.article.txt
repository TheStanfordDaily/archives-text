Show Boat (1936)
Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley
First there was the Edna Ferber
romantic novel and then the ground
breaking Jerome Kern-Oscar Ham
merstein II musical play in 1927 — the
first American musical with a strong nar
rative line. Universal filmed the play,
without its music, in 1929 as a part
talkie starring Laura La Plante, Alma
Rubens, Joseph Schildkraut and Stepin
Fetchit, and then seven years later
released this version, with a Ham
merstein screenplay and direction by the
talented James Whale. (There was still
another, scrappy remake, from M-G-M
in 1951; it featured Howard Keel,
Kathryn Grayson, Ava Gardner and
William Warfield.) This marvelous,
deluxe production is the one everyone
remembers. Irene Dunne plays the
daughter of a show boat captain
(Charles Winninger) and his feisty wife
(Helen Westley) who falls for a ne'er
do-well gambler (Allan Jones), and her
older friend and confidante, the mulatto
Julie, is played by the queen of the torch
singers, Helen Morgan (who created the
role on the New York stage and who is
wonderful in it). The film's highlights are
Morgan's renditions of "Can't Help
Lovin' Dat Man" and "Bill" and of
course the grand "OF Man River" num
ber, sung unforgettably by Paul
Robeson. (He and Hattie McDaniel col
laborate on another song, "Ah Still Suits
Me," which Kern and Hammerstein
wrote especially for the movie.) With
Donald Cook, Oueenie Smith, Eddie
"Rochester" Anderson, Clarence Muse,
Harry Barris and E.E. Clive.
Plays Monday with "The Scar of
Shame."

The French Lieutenant's Woman
(1981)
Faculty Lounge, Building 300
As John Fowles' mystery woman,
Sarah Woodruff, Meryl Streep gives a
remarkably articulate performance, but
her mastery of technique is so clearly ev
ident that it becomes the theme of her
scenes. Karel Reisz directed this chilly,
split movie from Harold Pinter's
screenplay; in an attempt to find a filmic
equivalent to the commentary chapters
in Fowles' novel, Pinter has provided a
modern story about the filming of "The
French Lieutenant's Woman," filled
with the elliptical dialogue that is his
specialty, but Reisz's heart doesn't seem
to be in these scenes — they're flat, and
after a while they begin to seem in
trusive. The period sequences are
beautifully finished, however, and ex
quisitely shot by Freddie Francis. Reisz
coaxes admirable work from Jeremy
Irons, Patience Collier, Leo McKern,
Hilton Mcßae, Emily Morgan, Toni Pal
mer and Liz Smith.
Plays Wednesday at 7.

Small Change (1976)
Bijou, Palo Alto
Francois Truffaut's tribute to the
resilience of children — sweetly charm
ing, if not especially memorable. In one
scene, the parents of a little girl refuse to
take her to lunch at a restaurant because
she insists on bringing her stuffed-bear
handbag with her; piqued, she locks her

self in the apartment, throws the key
into a goldfish bowl, seizes her father's
megaphone and announces to the court
yard, "I'm hungry, I'm hungry." The
neighbors make up a bucket of food and
hoist it over to her window. There are
other delights in this picture, too, though
Truffaut doesn't know how to end many
of the sketches. Suzanne Schiffman col
laborated with him on the script;
Maurice Joubert wrote the lovely score;
the cast includes Jean-Francois Stevenin
as the humanistic schoolteacher who
delivers the director's message about
children's need for love.
Plays Wednesday at 8.
The Picture of Dorian Gray (1945)
Castro, San Francisco
Oscar Wilde's famous novella about a
man who retains his innocent, youthful
countenance while his portrait ages and
acquires the scars of all the evil he per
forms. Albert Lewin adapted and di
rected the film, which is shot (by Harry
Stradling) in black and white, with color
inserts for the close-ups of the
degenerating portrait. It isn't a good
movie, but the story keeps one watching
even after Angela Lansbury (as Sybil
Vane) drops out of it. She gives the only
good performance, but it's a truly mar
velous one — especially in the scene in
which she first sings "Little Yellow
Bird" and the later scene where Dorian
(Hurd Hatfield) seduces her with a little
Chopin. George Sanders plays Lord
Henry Wotton, Lowell Gilmore is Basil
Hallward, the painter. Donna Reed is
Gladys and Peter Lawford is David.
Plays Tuesday with "Night Must
Fall."
The Lady from Shanghai (1948)
Cedar, San Francisco
Orson Welles made this insanely com
plicated and thoroughly bizarre murder
mystery, adapting his overwritten
screenplay from a novel by Sherwood
King called "If I Die Before I Wake."
He plays the hero, too — an Irish sailor
who hires on to crew a yacht belonging
to a brilliant criminal lawyer (Everett

Sloane) and his alluring wife (Rita
Hayworth). Welles and Hayworth were
undergoing divorce proceedings while
the movie was in production, and that
may have contributed to Welles' depic
tion of the Bannisters' marriage in this
movie — they are as nasty and hateful a
couple as any ever put on the screen.
(O'Hara, the sailor, compares them
repeatedly to sharks, and his love scene
with Elsa Bannister takes place inside an
aquarium.) This is a very entertaing
piece of stylized hysteria, directed with
astonishing wit and cool assurance.
Welles' performance isn't any good (and
his Irish accent is as unconvincing as his
Scottish brogue in " Macbeth"), but
Everett Sloane is terrific as Arthur Ban
nister, who walks bent over like a stick
figure, a pair of (unexplained) crutches
close to his legs. He calls his wife
"lovers," and Glenn Anders (as his
creepy partner Grisby) calls O'Hara
"fella" in a voice that suggests the
Wicked Witch of the West in drag.
Grisby complains of an unhappy mar
riage, but we never meet his wife, and
Glenn Anders plays this man as a
predatory homosexual with a definite in
terest in O'Hara. The film is most fa
mous, of course, for the spectacular
crazy house finale — one of the high
points of American films of this period.
Plays today and tomorrow with "Gun
Crazy."
The Man Who Knew Too Much
(1956)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
With the aid of screenwriters John Mi
chael Hayes and Angus MacPhail, com
poser Bernard Herrmann and
photographer Robert Burks, Alfred
Hitchcock expanded and improved his
1934 thriller. James Stewart and Doris
Day play American tourists traveling in
Morocco who become involved in inter
national intrigue. The good supporting
cast includes Bernard Miles, Brenda da
Banzie and Daniel Gelin. This is one of
Doris Day's few good pieces of screen
acting; she, Stewart and Hitchcock
deserve equal credit for the unusual
scene in which Stewart tells her their

son has been kidnaped by conspirators.
A gripping (and much underrated)
picture.
Plays Tuesday and Wednesday with
the 1934 version.
The Big Heat (1953)
Cedar, San Francisco
One of the earliest corrupt
establishment thrillers. Glenn Ford gives
a low-key, intense performance as a
tough, uncompromising cop who gets in
trouble for insulting the local
"respectable" hood (Alexander
Scourby). Sidney Boehm's script (based
on a "Satevepost" story by William
McGivern) slips in some "High Noon -
era lectures about scared little people
who won't stick their necks out. but the
characters are colorful enough to
overcome the problem-play cliches.
Gloria Grahame plays the vain, hard
boiled moll of a sadistic thug (Lee Mar
vin): Jeanette Nolan is the ungrieving
widow of a cop whose suspicious suicide
begins the story; Jocelyn Brando is
Ford's wife; Dorothy Green is a hooker,
Carolyn Jones a barfly. Dan Seymour
the proprietor of an auto repair shop,
Peter Whitney a bartender, etc. This
mean, engrossing little picture was di
rected by Fritz Lang.
Plays Tuesday through Thursday with
"In a Lonely Place."
Night Must Fall (1937)
Castro, San Francisco
Robert Mongomery gives a
remarkable performance as a psychopat
hic killer in John van Druten's adapta
tion of the Emlyn Williams stage thriller.
Though the director, Richard Thorpe, is
rather uninspired, the film provides the
simple pleasures of the genre — specifi
cally, the English murder mystery of the
early part of this century, with its small
town gossips, invalid old ladies, old dark
houses, etc. And the two leading female
characters — the repellent old biddy
(Dame May Whitty) and the repressed
spinster companion (Rosalind Russell)
— lend a somewhat acrid (and interest
ing) flavor to the proceedings. With
Alan Marshal, Merle Tottenham, Mat
thew Boulton, E.E. Clive and Kathleen
Harrison (who has all the wittiest lines).
Plays Tuesday with "The Picture of
Dorian Gray."
