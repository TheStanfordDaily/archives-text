# Concert Network struggles to deliver
## 
### LARRY WEBER 
While Stanford students wait for campus
concerts and wonder what has become of
the Concert Network, members of the
Network say they are as frustrated and im
patient as anyone as they continue trying
to book contemporary acts here.
In its initial year as an operating promo
tional organization, the Network has been
able to to solicit only one musical per
former — Joan Baez. She came to Frost
Amphitheater in September.
Since then, Network Director Aaron
Persky and his staff have attempted to at
tract many performers, including Jean Luc
Ponty and Billy Ocean.
"We had Jean Luc Ponty booked to play
in January, but his manager rerouted the
tour," Persky said.
Subsequently, rescheduling became
impossible because Ponty's new Bay Area
schedule did not coincide with days that
Memorial Auditorium would be available.
The same situation occurred when the
Network had Ocean booked for the first
week of March.
"His band manager decided they'd
rather play in L.A.," he said.

"We just don't have a lot of flexibility
with regard to dates in Memorial
Auditorium," he explained.
In Frost, however, the concert season is
well-defined — the ampitheather is open
for concerts April 1 to October 31,
weather allowing.
"Most rock 'n' roll shows don't book
before three to four months ahead of
time," said Suzanne Becker, University
adviser to the Concert Network.
I hus, the Network is taking steps now to
obtain acts for the 1985 season.
This week, Persky sent a form letter to
potential promoters — such as Bill
Graham Presents and The Keystone Fam
ily— defining the parameters in which the
Network might set up a co-promotion
deal.
The requirements stated in the letter in
cluded Stanford student involvement on all
levels of production, the use of Tresidder
Ticket Office as a home box office for any
Frost show, equal billing for the Network
in advertisements, a $2 discount per ticket
bought by a Stanford student at Tresidder
and mandatory concert walk-throughs

before and after a show to "assess and at
tribute responsibility for facility damage."
Although the Network is trying to
remain the exclusive promoters of
Memorial Auditorium shows, this cannot
be done in Frost, a 9,500-seat theater.
"Out of financial necessity, we have to
go through a promoter," Becker said.
Noting that the Network's entire fee
assessment from last year could easily be
lost in one substantially unsuccessful
venture, Becker stressed the importance of
having a co-promoter to provide risk capi
tal and thus absorb potential losses.
Bill Graham is the Bay Area's premier
promoter. "He has a large financial base
and privileged access to bands and
facilities," Persky said.
This easy access has led to what Persky
called a "vertical monopoly on the busi
ness."
Graham has virtually exclusive control
over seven different Bay Area show loca
tions. They range in seating capacity from
Wolfgang's 675 seats to the Cow Palace's
12,000. Although Graham does not have
contractual agreements with all of these
places, his resources make him the usual

first choice of both facility owners and
band managers.
The infant Network has had difficulty
establishing credibility with promoters and
band agents in the already established mu
sical entertainment community. But Be
cker asserted that the Network's purpose
this year was not necessarily to provide
shows but rather to provide a sound organ
national base so that future shows can be
planned and executed smoothly.
"Aaron and the others have essentially
laid all of the groundwork and have set the
policy from scratch," she said.
"They are new at this, and they're
dealing with professionals who expect
them to be professional. They have done a
good job of starting to develop positive
relationships with the University and with
agencies."
According to Becker, Stanford can ex
pect some Frost shows before this school
year is over. Persky and other students in
the Network are determined to have their
efforts rewarded with a show before the
end of their one-year terms in office.
"They are real hungry for a show," Be
cker said.
