# Oil magnate advocates shareholder management

"Many people believe you can't foster the
entrepreneurial spirit in today's corporate environment. I
don't believe it," said Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens.
Making a case for employee ownership, Pickens said,
"The only way to respond to stockholders' concerns is to
be one of them."
Pickens, the controversial founder and chairman of
Mesa Petroleum Co., addressed an overflow crowd of
more than 350 yesterday in Bishop Auditorium. Pickens,
in a talk frequently interrupted by laughter, stressed his
role as a "champion" of stockholders' interests.
"1 believe stockholders own the company, not the man
agement. And too often, management believes it does,"
Pickens said.
Behind Pickens' words are a history of unsuccessful but
very lucrative takeover bids, the most recent being his
December grab at Phillips Petroleum. Pickens contends
that "much of the uproar over mergers and acquisitions
comes from corporate managers who don t even own a
sizable amount of stock in their own companies.
These managers, said Pickens, have little to gain but a

lot to lose. "They've got an empire, they've got
[perquisites] and their stock ownership is nil. They've got
no financial risk and they're not giving it up easily — I've
found that out."
To emphasize this point, Pickens cited the head of the
Business Round Table, who recently spoke out in favor of
legislation limiting takeovers. According to Pickens, the
average stock ownership by Round Table's chief execu
tive officers — those of America's 200 largest companies
— was less than 1 percent of their company's outstanding
stock.
The conflicts of interest between management and
shareholders are not the only source of Pickens' criticism.
He also believes that productivity is hampered by the ex
cessive cautiousness of today's corporate managers.
"Managements can analyze well, but they can't make
decisions," Pickens said. "You must be able to analyze sit
uations and take advantage of them. You have to be
flexible and you must be quick."
To illustrate this. Pickens drew an analogy with a poker
player, saying, "You've got to make a move before all the
cards are on the table."
