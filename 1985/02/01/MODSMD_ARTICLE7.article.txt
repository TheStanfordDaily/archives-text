Reagan names UN ambassador
WASHINGTON — President Reagan has decided to name retired Lt.
Cien. Vernon Walters to replace Jeane Kirkpatrick as ambassador to the
United Nations, well-placed administration officials said yesterday.
Walters, the chief diplomatic trouble-shooter at the State Depart
ment, has the support of Secretary of State George Shultz and also is
considered acceptable to more conservative elements in the administra
tion.
An accomplished linguist reputed to be fluent in eight languages, Wal
ters served as an aide to President Dwight Eisenhower at various summit
meetings and was with then-Vice President Richard Nixon when his
party was stoned by demonstrators in Caracas in 1958.
Nixon appointed Walters deputy director of the Central Intelligence
Agency in 1 972. In this post Walters was approached by Nixon chief of
staff H.R. Haldeman and asked to block an investigation by the Federal
Bureau of Investigation into the Watergate burglary by saying that it
would compromise CIA interests in Mexico.
Walters did as he was told but then checked on what Haldeman had
said and told White House counsel John Dean that no such interests
would be compromised.
"It simply did not occur to me that the chief of staff to the president
might be asking me to do something that was illegal or wrong," Walters
wrote in his memoirs.
Walters retired from the CIA in 1976 and since 1981 has been used
widely as a consultant and ambassador-at-large by the State Depart
ment. He served on an advisory committee to Reagan during the 1984
campaign.
Leading economic indicators fall
WASHINGTON — The government's index of leading indicators, the
chief barometer of the U.S. economy's future direction, fell 0.2 percent
in December and posted a less healthy gain in November than originally
estimated, the Department of Commerce reported yesterday.
Coming at a time when other indicators are signaling renewed vigor in
the nation's economy, this latest report raised questions about the true
course of the economy. But most private economists said December's
dip in the index does not change their outlook for healthy growth this
year.
'T'm going to write off the December indicators," Jerry Jasinowski,
chief economist of the National Association of Manufacturers, said.
"The decline in the index is very hard to reconcile with the other
evidence that growth is picking up in the early part of 1985."
At the White House, meanwhile, presidential spokesman Larry
Speakes said that the 0.2 percent drop in the index "is not a matter of
concern to us. Virtually all economic factors are reflecting exceptionally
strong growth . . . growth that surprises even the economists them
selves."
Finland recovers Soviet missile
HELSINKI, Finland — Finnish searchers yesterday found the tail sec
tion of a wayward Soviet missile that crashed five weeks ago. and West
ern officials denied a newspaper report that the missile had been aimed
at West Germany and the Soviets had to shoot it down.
The unarmed missile crashed in northern Finland after hurtling over
Norwegian and Finnish territory on Dec. 28, when it strayed from Soviet
military exercises in the Barents Sea.
At the time, the Soviet Union made an unprecedented apology to
Norway and Finland, saying the weapon was a target missile that had
gone off course during firing exercises.
In Washington, Defense Secretary Casper Weinberger told the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee the Soviets "shot down one of their own
cruise missiles that got away from them and was starting to work its way
across Norway and Finland."
Chernenko attacks space defense
WASHINGTON — Soviet President Konstantin Chernenko, disput
ing the Reagan administration's claim that the "Star Wars" space pro
gram is a defensive effort, harshly attacked the plan yesterday as an of
fensive and aggressive concept whose aim is to achieve U.S. superiority
over the Soviet Union.
Although the administration argues that Star Wars is only a missile
defense research program. Chernenko asserted that, behind the shield of
such a defense, Washington would feel safe against a retaliatory strike.
Thus, he said, the United States would have the capability to launch a
surprise nuclear attack against the Soviet Union.
Recalling that the atomic bomb was the product of scientific research,
the Soviet leader declared: "Everyone knows how it turned out for the
people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki." Both Japanese cities were
devastated by U.S. atomic bombs during World War 11.
Also yesterday, Kenneth Adelman, chief of the U.S. Arms Control
and Disarmament Agency, said that the administration will accuse the
Soviet Union of 15 to 20 violations and probable violations of various
arms control agreements, which is more than twice the number of al
leged cheating incidents previously cited.
"Unless there is a better pattern of Soviet behavior, their record casts
a very dark shadow over future agreements," Adelman said.
Pentagon research budget to grow
WASHINGTON — President Reagan will ask Congress to approve
"a very large" jump — about 19 percent after inflation — in next year's
Pentagon research budget and a similar increase in military construction,
administration and congressional sources said yesterday.
But the spending plan for fiscal 1986, which Reagan will send to
Congress Monday, will show for the first time in several years only
"modest growth" in funding for Pentagon weapons purchases, the
sources said.
The increase in research spending stems largely from plans to push
ahead with President Reagan's "Star Wars" missile defense system. Re
search on that program was given $ 1.4 billion in the current budget, and
the administration will seek to increase that by $2 billion in the fiscal
year that begins Oct. 1, according to a Pentagon official.
The defense budget has become a central element in the fight over the
administration's overall spending plan. Secretary of Defense Caspar
Weinberger, under intense pressure from the Republican majority in the
Senate and from colleagues in the administration, agreed in December
to trim the defense buildup by $8.7 billion.
Budget director David Stockman estimated that with such a cut, the
Pentagon budget would increase 6.4 percent, after inflation. Actual
defense spending would increase from the current figure of $284.5 bil
lion to $313.7 billion.
Arctic air mass blankets country
Bristling arctic air from Canada spread out from the Continental
Divide to cover more than half the nation yesterday, sending the tem
perature to 65.7 degrees below zero in Utah and carrying snow that
closed schools from New Mexico to Maryland.
At least five deaths in three states since Wednesday have been blamed
on the cold and snow.
Scores of schools closed yesterday in parts of Arizona, New Mexico,
Oklahoma, Texas, Missouri, Tennessee. Maryland. Delaware and the
District of Columbia.
Helicopter crews in Arizona yesterday began a second day of dis
tributing crucial supplies of food. fuel, medicine and livestock feed to
hundreds of people snowbound on isolated northern Indian reserva
tions.
Wall Street down slightly
NEW YORK — The stock market closed out its best month since last
summer with further gains yesterday, although blue chip issues lagged
behind once again.
The Dow Jones average of 30 big-name industrials slipped 1.1 1 to
1.286.77.
Today's weather
Increasing cloudiness with a slight chance of showers. Highs in the
