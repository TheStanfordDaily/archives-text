## Charges against Meese dropped 
### 
WASHINGTON — The govern
ment's chief ethics officer testified
yesterday that two staff attorneys
agreed with him to drop
their initial finding that Attorney
General-designate Edwin Meese 111
had committed ethics violations by
approving government appointments
for two persons with whom he had
financial ties.
Backed by testimony from the two
lawyers. Office of Government Ethics
director David Martin told the Senate
Judiciary Committee: "There was no
pressure from anyone regarding this
matter or any other matter."
The committee, which is consider
ing Meese's nomination, wound up
the Meese hearings by going late into
the evening to hear panels of wit
nesses from law enforcement groups
favoring Meese and from civil rights
organizations opposed to his con

firmation. With an agreement to vote
on the nomination Tuesday, there is a
chance the Senate could consider it
before recessing next Friday for two
weeks.
Sen Joseph Biden Jr. (D-Del.) the
panel's ranking minority member,
hardened his position yesterday on
Meese by saying he will vote against
confirmation unless the nominee
comes back before the committee and
"does a mea culpa, mea culpa" (Latin
for an admission of fault).
Before the hearings reopened this
week. Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D-
Ohio) had said he would oppose
Meese, and questions and comments
by several other Democrats on the
17-member committee indicate that
they may vote "no" as well.
The ethics office review of an inde
pendent counsel's investigation of
Meese, which had found no basis for

criminal charges against him, became
an issue Monday when the existence
of the report critical of Meese on eth
ical grounds was disclosed.
Martin said that the report was
written by the staff lawyers of the et
hics office, F. Gary Davis and Nancy
Feathers, as the first step in "an ex
haustive review" of the independent
counsel's investigation to see if it
raised any ethical problems.
Martin acknowledged that he and
the lawyers found there was "an ap
pearance problem" caused by
Meese's approval of the appointment
to the U.S. Postal Board of Gover
nors of John McKean, a San Fran
cisco accountant who had arranged
two loans of $60,000 for the finan
cially pressed Meese.
But Martin said he handled that by
notifying President Reagan's lawyer,
Fred Fielding, of the matter, although

he ignored Davis proposal th«
Fielding counsel Meese on the issue
Davis said that after lengthy discu
sions of the report with Martin ar
the office's chief counsel, Donal
Campbell, he became "complete
satisfied in my own mind that thei
wasn't any violation" of ethical stani
ards by Meese.
At the same time, Davis said, I
"also felt there was an overall pa
tern" of conduct demonstrated t
Meese on the loans arranged b
McKean and in McKean's subsequei
government appointment that calle
for Meese to "be a little moi
sensitive."
"You did feel there was a violatic
— I don't want to put words in yoi
mouth," Metzenbaum said.
