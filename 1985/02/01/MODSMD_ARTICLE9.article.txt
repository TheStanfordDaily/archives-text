# Shultz urges bullish U.S. policy

### 
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State George
Shultz and Secretary of Defense Caspar
Weinberger said yesterday that increased military
spending had swung the global balance of power
toward the United States and called for greater wil
lingness to use force to advance American inter
ests.
Shultz and Weinberger appeared before the Sen
ate Foreign Relations Committee in the first of a
series of hearings called by the panel's new chair
man, Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) aimed at creat
ing a bipartisan consensus on core foreign policy is
sues.
"We already have a basic consensus on the stra
tegic issues, East-West (and) U.S.-Soviet rela
tions," Lugar said. "The disagreements are mostly
on the fringes ... on where it is appropriate to use
force."
The Senate committee's session largely bore out
that contention. Democrats questioned Shultz and
Weinberger pointedly on several issues, including
the adminstration's request for CIA funding of
Nicaraguan rebels, but only one, Sen. Claiborne

Pell (D-R.1.) directly challenged the premises of
their policies.
Shultz, in a bullish, hour-long speech, asserted
that in the four years of President Reagan's first
term, "the underlying conditions of U.S.-Soviet re
lations have changed dramatically."
" A decade or so ago, when the United States was
beset by economic difficulties, neglecting its
defenses and hesitant about its role of leadership,
the Soviets Exploited these conditions," the secre
tary of state said. Uncharacteristically using Mar
xist jargon, he added, "They had reason for confi
dence that what they called the 'global correlation
of forces' was shifting in their favor.
"Today, the West is more united than ever
before," Shultz said. "The United States is restor
ing its military strength and economic vigor and has
regained its self-assurance. We have a president
with a fresh mandate from the people for an active
role of leadership.
"The Soviets, in contrast, face profound struc
tural economic difficulties, a continuing succession
problem and restless allies," he said.

"Their diplomacy and their clients are on the de
fensive in many parts of the world. We have reasoi
to be confident that the 'correlation of forces' i
shifting back in our favor."
Weinberger, who appeared separately, was les
optimistic and — embroiled in a major battle ove
the size of next year's defense budget — empha
sized the need to match what he described as an un
remitting buildup of Soviet military forces.
"Most elements of our relations with the Sovie
Union have been constant, or changed very slowly
in the post-war years," Weinberger said. "Couplet
with U.S. restraint during the 19705, (the Sovie
Union's) expanding military power enabled Mos
cow to shift critical components of the overal
global military balance in its favor."
Agreeing with Shultz, he said that the Reagai
administration had improved the military balanct
in the direction of greater U.S. strength, but said ht
still saw Soviet advantages in both conventiona
and nuclear forces.
