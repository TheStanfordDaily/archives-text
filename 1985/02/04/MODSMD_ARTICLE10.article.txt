# Congress wary of defense hike
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — President Reagan's new
budget, a $973.7 billion spending blueprint in
which proposals for massive domestic cuts are al
most entirely offset by higher defense outlays, en
countered swift criticism yesterday from leaders of
both political parties, who warned that it may un
dermine congressional efforts to reduce the deficit.
The administration's budget for fiscal 1986,
which was made public even before its official sub
mission to Congress today as a result of widespread
leaks, projects a deficit of $180 billion for the 12
months beginning Oct. 1 — or about $12 billion
more than the president's own goal for deficit re
duction.
Reagan, who proposes to add a dollar to this
year's defense spending levels for every dollar cut
from domestic programs, acknowledged in an ac
companying message to Congress that the plan is
"still a far cry from our goal of a balanced budget."
Nonetheless, he defended it as "a significant step in
the right direction."
Final congressional action will come only after
months of debale. But for now. Rep. Richard Gep
hardt (D-Mo.) appeared to express the mounting

discouragement of many on Capitol Hill when he
iid, "The Congress is going to wind up changing
this budget, but we may not get more in deficit re
duction."
Originally, Reagan had predicted his budget
would contain a $54 billion deficit reduction pack
age for fiscal 1986. Senate Republican leaders have
been trying without success for more than a month
to draft a reduction plan in the $50 billion range.
Pete Domenici (R-N.M ), chairman of the Sen
ate Budget Committee, indicated yesterday that
$38 billion to $40 billion may now be a more realis
tic goal for deficit reduction. " Reality-is setting in,"
Domenici said in an interview on the Cable News
Network. "Now we're measuring goals against per
formance, and it's getting very sticky and very
tough."
Gephardt agreed that the Senate Republican
leadership will probably fail to come up with $54
billion in cuts. "I think it's failing because it's hard
to do without presidential leadership," he said. "It
takes more than a bystander president."
"It would appear that the president has really
just walked away from the deficit issue and is
leaving it in the hands of the House and Senate,"

said Rep. William Gray (D-Pa.), chairman of the
House Budget Committee.
Republicans and Democrats alike predicted that
Congress will give Reagan less tor detense and
more for domestic programs than he wants.
Republicans, who control the Senate, are also con
sidering a freeze on Social Security benefits, which
the president and the Democratic majority in the
House publicly oppose. Senate Majority Leader
Robert Dole (R-Kan.), for example, said in a tele
vision interview that Congress is likely to boost the
defense budget by about 3 percent beyond infla
tionary growth, compared with Reagan s proposal
for a net increase of 5.7 percent.
"The president . . . says 'Don't touch Social Se
curity, don't touch defense, don t raise taxes,
Dole said on ABC's This Week with David
Brinkley. "And you can't touch the interest on the
debt. That doesn't leave a great deal. So those of us
in Congress have to maybe look beyond some of
the president's promises in the campaign. Maybe
we ought to bring Social Security back on the table.
Maybe more spending restraint on the defense side
will be back on the table."
