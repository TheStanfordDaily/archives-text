Winter storms continue
More low-temperature records were over
turned yesterday, with Wichita Falls, Texas,
knocking a full 12 degrees off its old mark, while
just 25 miles north of the Winter haven of
Phoenix, Ariz., police turned back vehicles with
out chains because of seven inches of snow.
Many roads across the Gulf Coast states were
still slick from last week's snow and ice, and some
major highways remained closed yesterday.
Since Wednesday, the weathe/ had- been
blamed for at least 39 deaths nationwide.
Bitter cold continued across the northern and
central states, with readings of 10 to 20 degrees
below zero across the northern Plains and upper
Mississippi Valley. Subzero temperatures pushed
as far south as southeastern Missouri and western
Kentucky, with lows in the teens across central
Mississippi. Paducah, Ky., had a record low of 8
degrees below zero.
Below-zero temperatures and wind up to 20
mph produced wind-chill factors across North
Dakota occasionally as low as 60 degrees below
zero. The coldest point in the lower 48 states was
Worland, Wyo., with a low of 32 below zero.
People poll backs Goetz
NEW YORK — Most people who responded
to an unscientific survey of People magazine's

readership believed Bernhard Goetz should have
shot four teen-agers who reportedly confronted
him on a subway train.
Roughly 7,000 readers mailed answers to the
poll, which was published in an earlier edition
along with a story about the Dec. 22 shootings.
The results are published in People's Feb. 11
issue.
Sixty-four percent of the men and 48 percent
of the women responding chose "shoot the as
sailants" as the option Goetz should have
pursued. Eighteen percent of the men and 30
percent of the women said he should have drawn
his gun but not fired.
The magazine did not publish figures on the
exact number of readers responding, or the esti
mated margin of error of the sample.
"It wasn't scientific," said People spokes
woman Penelope Karageorge. "It was a write-in
poll. . . . The people who were moved sent it in."
Goetz was indicted Jan. 26 on gun possession
charges. One of the four youths wounded in the
shooting remains in a coma. The three others
have been released from the hospital.
Block eyes farm woes
WASHINGTON — Secretary of Agriculture
John Block called it important yesterday that the
government take an "immediate look" at the

credit crisis that threatens to push increasing
numbers of farmers to the wall and said he
believed "we can come up with something" in the
week ahead.
Up for review by Block and other Reagan ad
ministration officals is a proposed emergency
program, discussed last week with farm-state
members of Congress, under which the govern
ment would guarantee a major portion of farm
loans if banks agreed to reduce interest rates to
head off foreclosures. Final decisions have yet to
be made on the plan, according to Edwin Dale,
chief spokesman for the Office of Management
and Budget.
Block emphasized that the administration was
"very concerned" about the plight of farmers
unable to meet carrying charges on bank loans in
a time of sagging farm prices. But he was less
than sanguine about the immediate future of U.S.
agriculture. •
"I think we all know that we'll lose some farm
ers. We've been losing farmers through an evolu
tionary process for 50 years," Block said during
an appearance on CBS News' "Face the Nation"
program.
Block said Reagan and his Cabinet were all
aware "that it is very difficult out there, that
farmers are in trouble." but "the solutions are
not easy to come by."
