USC finds fake degrees
LOS ANGELES — University of Southern
California officials are investigating allegations
that phony degrees, backed up by complete
transcripts illegally placed in the university's
computer system, were sold for up to $25,000
each.
The allegations, if substantiated, would repre
sent the second instance of illegal tampering with
the university's computer to surface since Octo
ber. Thirty USC students are currently under in
vestigation for allegedly paying to have unauth
orized grade changes made on their transcripts.
"Our investigation has widened beyond grade
changes," said U§C Vice Provost Sylvia Man
ning, who is coordinating the university's probe.
"We are now investigating the possibility that
someone may have created entire transcripts as
well."
Drug Enforcement Administration agents in
Louisville, Ky., said they uncovered information
that phony USC degrees were sold during the
course of a drug investigation, and that informa
tion was later relayed to the Los Angeles County
district attorney's office. Investigators said they
were unaware of how many phony degrees
reportedly were sold. But doctoral degrees al
legedly sold for as much as $25,000, said Jerry
Snyder, head of the DEA's Louisville office.
University officials have begun checking
transcripts in search of the bogus degrees. Man
ning said, but said none have turned up yet.
University officials believe they will be able to
uncover any bogus degrees and any additional
illegal grade changes by checking transcripts
against other records at the school, but they »d
-mit that it will be a slow, painstaking process.
Arsonist hits Berkeley
BERKELEY — At least one arsonist —
working almost around the clock some days —
has terrorized Berkeley-area residents for a
month, setting 19 fires that caused more than
$900,000 damage and left dozens temporarily

homeless.
The first fire, set in the pre-dawn hours of Dec.
29, caused $16,000 damage to a church on the
north side of the UC-Berkeley campus. Since
then, the arson fires have moved south into Oak
land. The most recent one, set outside a home
just before midnight on Wednesday, caused
minor damage.
"We are very concerned," said Inspector
Philip Fry, an arson specialist with the Alameda
County district attorney's office. "The person or
persons doing this doesn't seem to care at all
about the time or area he strikes, whether or not
people are present or whether lives are endan
gered."
Diablo reactor restarted
SAN LUIS OBISPO — Diablo Canyon nu
clear power plant's Unit 1 reactor was restarted
and brought to 2 percent capacity after a month
long inspection of its main turbine generator sys
tem, officials said yesterday.
The reactor at the coastal plant midway be
tween Los Angeles and San Francisco is expected
to be brought to about IS percent capacity within
the next several days, according to Ron Wein
berg, spokesman for Pacific C3as and Electric.
Unit 1 will produce electricity for an eight- to 10-
hour period, and then its power will be decreased
for a vibration test.
During the past four weeks, the main turbine
generator's bearings were inspected as required
by the manufacturer, Weinberg said. The
generator's lube oil was flushed to minimize wear
of the turbine bearings, he added.
The goal in the second round of testing is 75
percent of the unit's 1. 1 million kilowatt capacity,
Weinberg said. The reactor was restarted Satur
day night.
Full-power testing at the $5.4 billion twin
reactor plant started after the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission granted a license and a
federal appeals court lifted a stay obtained by en
vironmentalist foes of the plant.
During the first round of Unit 1 tests, which

will eventually lead to commercial operation, the
reactor shut itself down automatically several
times because of malfunctions.
I wo workers were also slightly contaminated
by radioactive water and acid when one stepped in
some water on the floor and the other touched
some dried boric acid crystals on a valve. At the
time, Weinberg characterized the incident as a
"perfectly routine situation."
Diablo Canyon has generated controversy be
cause it is located about three miles from the of
fshore Hosgri earthquake fault. It also was
plagued by numerous design errors that required
extensive modifications in the construction.
Porn star arrested in SF
