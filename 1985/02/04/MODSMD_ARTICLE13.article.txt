## Herrington weighs merits of stun gun Stanford police consider stunning addition 
### XAVIER BRIAND 
Until recently, many police depart
ments considered the stun gun a high
tech gadget. A cattle prod with a
microchip. A glorified palm buzzer.
loday, the stun gun's popularity is
growing among Bay Area police de
partments, and it may be coming to
Stanford.
We re looking at it with cautious
optimism, said Stanford Police Chief
Marvin Herrington, "to see if it per
forms as advertised, and so far it has
with the departments using them."
Herrington said the decision to
equip Stanford patrol officers with
the device won't be made soon, if

ever. But the stun gun appears to be
"a new tool that gives us the ability to
deal with people who are truly viol
ent."
Herrington recalled one incident
last fall when his officers had to strap
a PCP-crazed man on a stretcher
before bringing him into custody. A
stun gun might have been handy then,
he said.
Approximately the size and shape
of an electric razor, the hand-held
stun gun packs a substantial punch.
Placing the contact probes, which tip
the device, on someone's body and
pressing the activator releases 50,000
volts of electricity, immobilizing that

person within seconds.
"Stun gun" is a nickname for the
Nova RX-5000, manufactured by
Nova Technologies of Austin, Texas.
The firm says its device is perfectly
safe.
Powered by a nine-Volt rec
hargeable battery, it "delivers a
scientifically formulated ratio of
voltage, low amperage and frequency
proven both effective and safe by
government testing agencies," boasts
a brochure mailed by a retailer in
Chicago to Herrington.
But Herrington is not convinced,
and unlike some police chiefs in the
area, he has decided against field
testing the device.
Police departments in San Mateo,
Redwood City, Menlo Park, Sunny
vale, Oakland, Fremont, Napa and
Marin are currently testing the stun
gun. Union City's 37 officers have
already been assigned the weapon.
Menlo Park police are testing three
or four stun guns, according to Lt.

people who are

Jim Ensler of the Mcnlo Park Police
Department. "It's not a real formal
test. Vve've used them eight times
since late November without a prob
lem," he said.
Despite such preliminary success,
Palo Alto Police Chief Jim Zurcher
has also refused to test the Nova in
his jurisdiction. "It's quite new and
there's no telling whether long-term
or subsequent problems might occur
after receiving an electrical dis
charge," he said.
Zurcher referred to the

Sacramento County Sheriffs decision
last November to halt the use of stun
guns after two persons zapped with
the device said it left marks like insect
bites on their bodies.
The Nova stun gun has been on the
market less than two years, but the
idea behind it is not new. For exam
ple, the Nova is related to the Taser, a
police weapon in vogue during the
1970s and now largely abandoned.
Unlike the Nova, the Taser fires
darts attached to wires that strike a
target and transmit an electric shock
from a portable power source.
State law banned the use of Tasers
by private individuals, following a
rash of robberies committed with the
weapon in the early 19705. Last year
a bill sponsored by state Sen. John
Seymour (R-Anaheim), would have
imposed the same controls on stun
guns.
But the bill was amended, and state
law, signed by Gov. George Deuk
mejian last year, still allows anyone to
purchase the device. However, it is

now a misdemeanor to stun a private
citizen, and a felony to use the gun
against a peace officer or firefighter,
punishable by a year in jail.
The stun gun made headlines in
January when an Oakland man,
estranged from his wife, kidnapped
his two children and zapped their
grandfather, who tried to stop him.
According to the Oakland Tribune,
David Lopez, 63, suffered burns on
his scalp and a cut on the left side of
his face caused by repeated shocks
from the device.
Anyone may purchase a stun gun,
although gun-store personnel inter
viewed said they don't sell the item
indiscriminately. "It's quite popular,
but we don't sell it to everybody. I
personally do discriminate," said
Cameron Nouriani of Cameron
Ordnance & Supplies, Inc., in Foster
City.
The stun gun itself costs about $70,
but the entire package — gun,
recharger, holster, and nickel
cadmium battery — runs to $110.

The stun gun was a popular item at
H & H Enterprises in Redwood City
until about three weeks ago, said
owner Victor Holbrook.
In addition to supplying police de
partments, he has sold "about 70" in
the past three months to private
citizens, "mostly men buying them
for their wives or girlfriends.
"Everyone who wanted one bought
one," he said, speculating on the
reasons for the re:ent drop in sales of
stun guns.
While safety and potential for
criminal use are the main objections
leveled at the stun gun, some critics
also question its effectiveness as a
self-defense weapon.
The stun gun, unlike more conven
tional weapons like a night stick, must
first be place on the assailant, then
activated with a spring-loaded switch.
"Mace or a shriek alarm works just
as well," said Cari Wilson, director of
the Rape Crisis Center in Palo Alto.
"And at $70, (the stun gun) is prohi
bitive for many women."

Unlike the Nova, the Taser fires
darts attached to wires that strike a
target and transmit an electric shock
from a portable power source.
State law banned the use of Tasers
by private individuals, following a
rash of robberies committed with the
weapon in the early 19705. Last year
a bill sponsored by state Sen. John
Seymour (R-Anaheim), would have
imposed the same controls on stun
guns.
But the bill was amended, and state
law, signed by Gov. George Deuk
mejian last year, still allows anyone to
purchase the device. However, it is

now a misdemeanor to stun a private
citizen, and a felony to use the gun
against a peace officer or firefighter,
punishable by a year in jail.
The stun gun made headlines in
January when an Oakland man,
estranged from his wife, kidnapped
his two children and zapped their
grandfather, who tried to stop him.
According to the Oakland Tribune,
David Lopez, 63, suffered burns on
his scalp and a cut on the left side of
his face caused by repeated shocks
from the device.
Anyone may purchase a stun gun,
although gun-store personnel inter
viewed said they don't sell the item
indiscriminately. "It's quite popular,
but we don't sell it to everybody. I
personally do discriminate," said
Cameron Nouriani of Cameron
Ordnance & Supplies, Inc., in Foster
City.
The stun gun itself costs about $70,
but the entire package — gun,
recharger, holster, and nickel
cadmium battery — runs to $110.

The stun gun was a popular item at
H & H Enterprises in Redwood City
until about three weeks ago, said
owner Victor Holbrook.
In addition to supplying police de
partments, he has sold "about 70" in
the past three months to private
citizens, "mostly men buying them
for their wives or girlfriends.
"Everyone who wanted one bought
one," he said, speculating on the
reasons for the re:ent drop in sales of
stun guns.
While safety and potential for
criminal use are the main objections
leveled at the stun gun, some critics
also question its effectiveness as a
self-defense weapon.
The stun gun, unlike more conven
tional weapons like a night stick, must
first be place on the assailant, then
activated with a spring-loaded switch.
"Mace or a shriek alarm works just
as well," said Cari Wilson, director of
the Rape Crisis Center in Palo Alto.
"And at $70, (the stun gun) is prohi
bitive for many women."

Until recently, many police depart
ments considered the stun gun a high
tech gadget. A cattle prod with a
microchip. A glorified palm buzzer.
loday, the stun gun's popularity is
growing among Bay Area police de
partments, and it may be coming to
Stanford.
We re looking at it with cautious
optimism, said Stanford Police Chief
Marvin Herrington, "to see if it per
forms as advertised, and so far it has
with the departments using them."
Herrington said the decision to
equip Stanford patrol officers with
the device won't be made soon, if

ever. But the stun gun appears to be
"a new tool that gives us the ability to
deal with people who are truly viol
ent."
Herrington recalled one incident
last fall when his officers had to strap
a PCP-crazed man on a stretcher
before bringing him into custody. A
stun gun might have been handy then,
he said.
Approximately the size and shape
of an electric razor, the hand-held
stun gun packs a substantial punch.
Placing the contact probes, which tip
the device, on someone's body and
pressing the activator releases 50,000
volts of electricity, immobilizing that

person within seconds.
"Stun gun" is a nickname for the
Nova RX-5000, manufactured by
Nova Technologies of Austin, Texas.
The firm says its device is perfectly
safe.
Powered by a nine-Volt rec
hargeable battery, it "delivers a
scientifically formulated ratio of
voltage, low amperage and frequency
proven both effective and safe by
government testing agencies," boasts
a brochure mailed by a retailer in
Chicago to Herrington.
But Herrington is not convinced,
and unlike some police chiefs in the
area, he has decided against field
testing the device.
Police departments in San Mateo,
Redwood City, Menlo Park, Sunny
vale, Oakland, Fremont, Napa and
Marin are currently testing the stun
gun. Union City's 37 officers have
already been assigned the weapon.
Menlo Park police are testing three
or four stun guns, according to Lt.

The gun appears
to be 'a new tool
that gives us the
ability to deal with
people who are
truly violent.'

Department. "It's not a real formal
test. Vve've used them eight times
since late November without a prob
lem," he said.
Despite such preliminary success,
Palo Alto Police Chief Jim Zurcher
has also refused to test the Nova in
his jurisdiction. "It's quite new and
there's no telling whether long-term
or subsequent problems might occur
after receiving an electrical dis
charge," he said.
Zurcher referred to the

Sacramento County Sheriffs decision
last November to halt the use of stun
guns after two persons zapped with
the device said it left marks like insect
bites on their bodies.
The Nova stun gun has been on the
market less than two years, but the
idea behind it is not new. For exam
ple, the Nova is related to the Taser, a
