## The 						Stanford Daily Editor's introduction 
### 
I've watched three new editors write their in
troductory editorials, and each time I've thought
of all the wise and witty things I'd say if I ever had
the chance.
Maybe that's-why I'm having such a hard time
coming up with one cohesive theme for my intro
ductory editorial.
So instead of offering you the traditional,
solemn theme of The Daily's history and the
editor's plans for the future, I'd like to share with
you my thoughts on a number of things as we
head into the paper's 187 th volume.
Columnists and editorial board: I'm troubled
by what I saw when we asked for columnists and
editorial board candidates. We received 28
sample columns for the 10 biweekly columnist
positions, and 12 students applied for the three
at-large spots on the editorial board. That part
shows, I think, a healthy interest in the exchange
of ideas here. What worries me, though, is that
only two of the 28 columnist applicants and two
of the 12 editorial board candidates were women.
I have no idea how to explain this, and I'd appre
ciate any insight you might have that would help
us to prevent it from recurring.
Tough decisions: Stupid mistakes — misspelled
names, sentences that aren't, botched facts —
make you angry, and they make us angrier still.
But what really tends to upset you — if the letters
and phone calls we receive are accurate in
dicators of the way you feel — are the decisions
we make on judgment calls: Do we print the
name of a student who's been charged with
sexual assault? Do we publish advertising from a

company whose actions we can't accept? Do we
run pictures of an offensive stunt? All these have
come up in the first half of this year; they're diffi
cult questions and we don't take them lightly. I
can't promise that you'lN always be happy with
the decisions we make — I know there will be
members of our own staff who won't be happy
with our decisions — but I can promise you we
will have thought about them, argued about them
and, as I've done more than once in my three
years here, sometimes stormed out of the build
ing over them.
Changes: All new editors are accused of need
lessly tinkering with the appearance of the paper,
and I suppose I'm no different. Your Daily does
look different this morning, and it will take some
time to get used to it. But I think we'll all come to
appreciate the changes. You'll find keys on the
top of the front page to some of the best stories
on the inside of the paper. You'll find a full page
of wire service reports on Page 2 to keep you in
formed of events off campus. And throughout the
paper, you'll find a cleaner look brought about by
a streamlining of typefaces. All this should make
The Daily an easier and more interesting paper to
read. And that's what we're after. Let us know
how we're doing.
