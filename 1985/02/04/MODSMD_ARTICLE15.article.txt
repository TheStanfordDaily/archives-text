## Extradepartmental programs strengthened not diminished 
### 
I was the only undergraduate on the Uni
versity committee set up last year to review
extradepartmental education at Stanford. If I
didn't know better, if I hadn't been there
myself, I would certainly feel as though I'd let
everyone down.
It seems, from The Daily's coverage of that
committee's report, that the whole purpose of
the EDP Review Committee, of the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Studies' periodic
evaluations of the extradepartmental pro
grams, and of the careful attention given this
issue by the deans of Humanities and Sciences
has been to criticize and to eliminate SCIRE.
Evidence The Daily headlines: "Report urges
end to SCIRE," Nov. 26; "SCIRE to end,"
Jan. 14; "SCIRE changes cause controversy,"
Jan. 16.
1 don't know what Eric Berg knows about
the extradepartmental programs or the pro
posed reorganization, but luckily I am in
formed by The Daily that he is concerned that
"efforts to increase the academic rigor of ex
tradepartmental programs might take away
from what makes SWOPSI and UGS special."
(Did he really mean to say that?) He and, it

seems, the rest of the ASSU Senate are also
worried about "relying on departmental ac
creditation for internships." Finally, The
Daily says that Berg says he feels SCIRE
"was doing a good job."
I hear from my roommate that, after
reading The Daily, she's really sorry there are
not going to be any more classes like the ones
SWOPSI and UGS used to offer. And Friday,
I learned in a letter to The Daily from the
ARLO board student co-chairs that ARLO
"has been terminated without explanation"
and that "the rights of students to a voice in
their own education have been violated in this
dissolution." I disagree.
My point is not to criticize, but to suggest
that it is time for a little more substantive
coverage of what is actually going on regard
ing the review and reorganization of the ex
tradepartmental programs. While I applaud
The Daily's attention to the EDPs, as I ap
plaud the ASSU Senate's "concern" and, es
pecially, the energy of the ARLO board's
student co-chairs, I feel increasingly com
pelled to point out what I think I know about
what they think they're talking about.

First, the review committee's report was
not about SCIRE exclusively, or even about
SCIRE any more than about the other ex
tradepartmental programs: ARLO, SWOPSI,
UGS and URO. The charge the committee
received was "to deliberate on priorities in
extradepartmental education in the 1980s, to
formulate criteria for programs outside de
partments and to review the operations of the
following programs in the School of
Humanities and Sciences" — the five EDPs
named above.
The committee not only met with represen
tatives from each of the programs as part of its
deliberations, but also conducted a vigorous
investigation of student and faculty views
about the existing EDPs, and the role of ex
tradepartmental education at Stanford gener
ally, using both questionnaires and personal
interviews. Its final report emphasizes on
every page the same perception that students
and faculty supplied: that extradepartmental
education is important and provides a
valuable channel for academic exploration of
the kind not found within traditional depart
ments.

What the report also reveals is that students
and, in particular, faculty members feel that
the academic material encountered in the ex
tradepartmental programs is generally less
challenging, and methods of evaluation less
rigorous, than in regular Stanford courses.
Because the EDP Review Committee, C-US
and the deans in Humanities and Sciences all
agree with the consensus of students and fac
ulty that extradepartmental programs meet
important needs at Stanford, they have sup
ported recommendations to reorganize the
existing EDPs in hopes of strengthening
them. It may sound incredible, but it is true.
Nowhere in The Daily's coverage of this
issue have I read that the programs are being
restructured in order to reduce confusion
about what they are and what they do — so
that more students might take advantage of
extradepartmental resources. Neither have I
noticed mention of the recommendation that
the new extradepartmental education center
be administered by a director who is a mem
ber of the tenured faculty — to facilitate more
direct involvement by other faculty and to im
prove perceptions about the academic quality

of the programs.
No one wants to do away with ARLO's ad
mirable achievements. It is my understanding
that a revised structure for the EDPs will
draw and build on the resources that have
been developed by the existing programs in
the past. SCIRE was originally established to
develop innovative learning opportunities for
undergraduates, including individual and
group projects, task forces and funding for
student programs — not just to give students
credit for their summer internships. These im
portant functions should and will be included
in a new structure for extradepartmental edu
cation.
The kinds of changes being made to the ex
tradepartmental programs seem, to me, to
reflect a commitment to strengthening — not
diminishing — them, based on the Univer
sity's recognition of the valuable service they
provide. I hope the majority of students who
will be affected by these changes have the op
portunity to find out what's actually going on.
