# Nuclear Winter Wonderland thawed
## 
### 
President Reagan received significant media at
tention recently when he heaved several snowballs
across the White House lawn. The event was
treated very lightheartedly — good old Ron
showing what a spontaneous fellow he can be. Sure,
Jimmy Carter bashed rabbits in his spare time, but
old Ron chucks snowballs at trees.
The media typically respond to these types of
"less serious" incidents with resounding sen
sationalist unity; no one ever probes the possibility
that perhaps subliminal messages lie within these
so-called amusing situations. After considerable re
search I have concluded that there was much more
to Ron's romp in the snow than a simple
demonstration of his pitching technique (although
when he makes pitches they can often be compared
to snowballs). And although my conclusions have
far-reaching implications, 1 am convinced as to
their verity.
When the Clip hurled those snowballs for the
media, he was, in fact, stating that not only does he
support the idea that we can fight and win a limited
nuclear war, but that doing so could have fun
results. It has to do with Nuclear Winter Wonder
land.
In doing research on "snowscam" I uncovered
some highly confidential Department of Defense
documents dealing with the N.W.W. theory. These
documents show that the N.W.W. theory is the
brainchild of one Ogden T. Shiver, a mysterious
man holding no high government position, as far as
I could determine.
When I did track down Shiver at a posh ski resort
in Switzerland, he was in a ski lodge snuggled next
to a beautiful Swiss blonde named Olga Shiver,
who was. curiously enough, Ogden's wife. They
stared longingly into each other's eyes as he del
icately caressed her ivory hands and ate a bag of
Frito's brand corn chips.
I interrupted their temporal satisfaction by ask
ing for a Frito and then hitting Ogden with the fact
that 1 knew all about his connection with the
N.W.W. theory. He agreed to talk with me if 1 gave

him my word that I would not repeat anything he
told me. I gave him my word.
The firsi thing he talked about was how he had
injured himself that morning on the slopes. I told
him that I was sorry about his injury but that I
didn't have all morning and so would he please talk
about N.W.W. theory. He looked insulted at first,
but then I realized that a Frito was wedged between
his front teeth, and that he was in considerable
pain. He spit out the Frito and began to talk. "You
know, Steve, 1 stumbled upon tlr* Nuclear Winter
Wonderland theory right in this very lodge several
years ago. I was eating a mushroom omelette and
thinking about nuclear war."
"Oh," I said. "Of course."
"So anyway, there I was thinking about nuclear

war and what would happen if we had one, you
know, with nuclear winters and all that. Then all of
the sudden I thought, 'Hey Ogden, what would be
so bad about a nuclear winter?' "
"Uh huh?" I said.
"Don't you see?" he asked with disbelief. "With
a nuclear winter the whole world could be frolick
ing in one giant field of fresh powder."
"But. ..."
"But what!" he bellowed. "Nuclear Winter
Wonderland!" Just to avoid an argument 1 told him
I understood, and he continued to tell me how he
completed the development of the theory.

"I then offered to sell my theory to your govern
ment," he concluded.
"What did you get for it?" I.asked.
"Why, I got a brand new complete set of skiing
equipment — skis, boots, poles and all, worth
about $319,562.45 according to your govern
ment."
I thanked Ogden for his time, assured him that I
wouldn't repeat anything he'd told me, and left.
When I returned to the states I made contact
inside White House official to determine
how shiver's theory had made it to the Oval Office
and, subsequently, to the White House lawn.
I told my informant that I would in no way reveal
her identity or use my information to hurt her hus
band's administration.
"Ron and the staff went into an ecstatic frenzy
when they heard about the Nuclear Winter Won
derland theory," she said. "Even Lucky ap
proved," she added.
"1 see. So why the snowballs?" I asked.
"It's simple," she assured me. "The snowballs
were part of our strategy to get the country excited
about what fun snow can be. We chose trees as tar
gets for the snowballs to show that trees are no
fun."
"Because in a nuclear winter there will be no
trees left," I said, making the connection.
"Exactly," she said.
I asked her about the future.
"Well, as you know, this is Ron's last term, so
after it's over we plan on returning to the ranch
and. ..."
"Excuse me," I interrupted. "I mean the future
plans for the Nuclear Winter Wonderland theory."
"Well," she sighed, "at the present time our
strategem lacks definitive manifestativeliness
wherein as an exteroceptive element. ..."
"You don't know," I interrupted, again making
the connection.
"Exactly," she said.
