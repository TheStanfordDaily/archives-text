## Four-class is better 
### 
Rob Robinson said it all in "Four
class housing best for freshmen"
(The Daily, Jan. 28). As a junior
living in a four-class dorm in
Lagunita, I can confirm from a stu
dent's and an upperclassman's view
point what the resident fellow said
about the freshman's "enthusiasm
(and) willingness to experiment and
question, which is capable of gal
vanizing upperclassmen out of a
potential withdrawal into familiar
interests and familiar friends." And
as a former freshman who lived in
four-class Roble, I can affirm that
my upperclass friends were an inval
uable addition to the (also valuable)
system of advisers, AAs and RAs in
helping me learn my way around

Stanford, adjust to the Farm
academically and socially and get
involved in extracurricular activities
that first year.
Finally, as a former summer em
ployee at the Academic Information
Center — the office through which
the famous freshman white informa
tion card passes and roommate as
signments for each new entering
class are made — I can heartily attest
to the fact that the many phone calls
the office received from frosh re
questing to be in all-freshman Bran
ner were not based on their desire to
take advantage of the dorm-based
programs centered around Western
Cultur; and other freshman classes.
