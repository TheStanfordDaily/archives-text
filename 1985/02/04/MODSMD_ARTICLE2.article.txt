# Med VP Crowley resigns
## 
### 
Dr. Lawrence Crowley, president
of the Stanford Hospital and vice
president for medical affairs at the
medical center, will relinquish his ad
ministrative responsibilities at the
end of the year to return to other aca
demic duties.
University President Donald Ken
nedy accepted Crowley's resignation
"with a sense of real regret," but said
Crowley will continue to participate
in important projects he has begun.
These include medical center ef
forts to raise $145 million for capital
projects and endowment, the further
planning and development of the new
children's hospital and the study of
the future and organization of the
medical center.
According to University News Ser
vice, Crowley might not be replaced
as vice president. Rather, a special
committee, headed by Provost
James Rosse, will study
the medical center's administrative
structure and decide whether to
combine the position of vice presi
dent with the job of dean of the medi
cal center.
Kennedy expressed the hope that
the committee would make recom
mendations to him by the end of this
month
Crowley has only general plans for
the future.
"I hope to take a sabbatical and
then return to teaching," he said,
adding that seven years as an admin
istrator is a long time.
Kennedy told Crowley: "During
the seven years in which you will have
served in this role, you have given un
stingingly of yourself in the highest
interest of the University and the
medical center."
