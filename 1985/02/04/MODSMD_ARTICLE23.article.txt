## A.C. powers OSU over tenacious Card 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
The Stanford men's basketball team ended
the first half of its 18-game Pacific 10 Confer
ence schedule the same way it began it four
weeks ago — with a loss.
But Saturday afternoon against Oregon
State with 4,717 in Maples Pavilion and a
regional television audience looking on, Stan
ford added a new twist to a losing effort, its
seventh in nine league games. It played well.
The only problem was that Oregon State,
16-3 overall, 6-2 in the Pac-10 and 14th
ranked nationally, played better.

The final score was 83-73, but it was as
lopsided a 10-point game as they come. After
the Beavers had raced to a 20-6 lead, they
never looked back. The closest the Cardinal,
now 10-9 overall and tied for last plate in the
Pac-10 with a 2-7 record, got the rest of the
way was eight points.
To beat Oregon State, which moved into a
first-place tie with USC, Stanford knew it had
to stop 6-foot-9 forward A.C. Green, last
season's Pac-10 Player of the Year. California
did in its 42-36 upset over the Beavers
Thursday, holding Green to a season-low
eight points on a.3-for-ll shooting perfor

mance.
Stanford didn't.
About the only thing Stanford stopped
Green from doing Saturday was scoring 40
points. Other than that, he did it all. He
scored a career-high 39 points and would
have hit 40 had a free throw with 42 seconds
left not rolled around the rim and out. He
pulled down a game-high 11 rebounds. He
had five assists. He had four steals. And in 38
minutes of basketball, he had only three turn
overs.
"That was the rule rather than the excep
tion," Stanford Coach Tom Davis said of
Green. "He's an excellent basketball player.
There are no weaknesses in his game. We
tried to contain him, but he's not a one
dimensional player. He's a true All -
American."
Although 39 was his career high. Green
said he can and has played better. He also said
he has felt better.
"I had an upset stomach," said Green,
whose initials don't stand for a first or middle
name. "I don't know what it was. It was my
normal breakfast, but I felt sick. I wasn't as
quick as usual.
"It wasn't my best game, either," he contin
ued. " But we won, so that's the real important
thing."
His coach, Ralph Miller, couldn't agree
more. After the Beavers lost two straight —
83-82 to Arizona State in double overtime
last week and to Cal last Thursday — Miller,
the second winningest active coach in NCAA
Division I basketball, wasn't about to lose
three straight.
"Coach usually says 10 words max before a
game," Oregon State center Steve Woodside
said. "But before today's game, Coach had a
whole speech for us about how this game was
the turning point in our season."
When the crusty Miller was asked if he
talked to his players before the game, he
replied, "Yes, I talked to them." When he
was asked what he told them, he said, "That's
none of your damn business."
Oregon State was exactly what Stanford
hasn't been this season — consistent. Except
for a momentary lapse midway through the
second half, the Beavers played 40 minutes of
solid, team basketball.
That letdown came with 13:28 remaining
and followed — what else — a Green basket.
Green's two-handed dunk gave the Beavers a
51-37 lead, a point greater than their 37-24
halftime margin.
But just as Oregon State appeared comfor
tably in control, Stanford put together its only
serious run of the afternoon. A top-of-the
key jumper by Novian Whitsitt and a pair of
free throws by Keith Ramee narrowed it to
51-41 and began what would be an 8-2 spurt.
After Woodside put Oregon State on top
by 12 with a driving lay-up, Whitsitt worked
some more of his scoring on a 12-
footer from the right side and a fast-break lay

up after Kent Seymour blocked Green's shot
at the other end. Seconds later, Ramee stole
ttye Beavers' inbounds pass and drove for a
layup to cut it to six. He missed.
Oregon State grabbed the rebound, took it
down court and fed Green inside. Green
missed his first shot, but got the rebound, put
it in and was fouled. Miller called a timeout to
settle down his players, five of whom logged
at least 36 minutes, and less than 1:30 later,
they were in front by 15, 60-45. So much for
Stanford's comeback.
"On some nights they may be the best team
in the league," Davis said of Oregon State,
which hosts USC tonight for undisputed pos
session of first place. "The difference
(between the top teams) is so slight. By
March, any one of five or six teams in this
league could be the best. But right now,
you've got to give the edge to Oregon State."

Unlike their last two games, the Beavers
played like the class of the Pac-10 Saturday.
Asked what his team did differently, Miller
said, "Work hard. Play hall."
And make it look easy. The Beavers'
"Clockwork Orange" offense was at its most
effective as Oregon State shot 60.4 percent
from the floor, thanks to some nifty passing
that almost always seemed to result in lay
ups. Twenty-five of its 32 baskets were as
sisted.
"We moved the ball well," Miller said. "We
spread the court well so A.C. could sneak in
behind for easy baskets." Were the Beavers
looking for Green? "No. I just suggested we
pass the ball to the guy who was open. He
happened to be the one who was open."
Although Stanford was never really in the

before fouling out late in the second half.
game, the mood in the Cardinal lock
erroom was upbeat compared to the
gloomy scene following Thursday
night's 61-54 loss to Oregon.
As a team, Stanford shot 53.7 per
cent, the first time it has topped the
50 percent mark and only the third
time it has been over 40 percent in
conference play. As individuals,
nearly everyone played better, in par
ticular Whitsitt and Andy Fischer.
Whitsitt, who had 13 points, 10 of
them in the second half, broke a Pac
-10 season-long shooting slump with a
6-for-10 performance from the floor.
Entering Saturday's game, he was a
miserable 17-for-61, or 27.9 percent.
"I just stopped worrying about it,"
Whitsitt said of his slump. "I'm the
type of person that does worry about
things like that and let them affect
me."

Fischer, who scored all 14 of his
points in the second half — including
two on the first slam dunk of his Stan
ford career — was also optimistic
about the team's performance Satur
day. "We shot better and that was a
good sign," he said. "We also worked
hard. We just had to play a great
game to beat them the way they
played today."
Card notes
The Cardinal had two blocked
shots Saturday (one by Seymour, the
other by Earl Koberlein), tying the
Stanford team record of 60 blocked
shots in a season set by the 1976-77
team.
Ramee had five assists, bringing his
already record-setting career total to
300. Ramee, a junior, needs to
average 2.5 assists per game in his 40
remaining games at Stanford to top
the 400 plateau. An average of 6.6
assists a game will double the old
record of 281 Ramee broke last
month.
