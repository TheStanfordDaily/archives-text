# Stanford nine splits with Fullerton

### TOM SENF Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford baseball team upped its record to
2-1 by splitting a pair of games against defending
NCAA champion Fullerton State this weekend.
In its first test against high-caliber opposition,
the Cardinal managed a 6-3 victory on Friday after
its pitching staff suffered a 13-7 shelling Thursday.
The third game of the series was rained out Satur
day.
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess was definitely
satisfied with his team's performance against the
No. 3-ranked Titans. "Offensively and defensively,
we played well both games," he said. "We just
didn't pitch well in the first one."
In the series opener, Stanford showed it was not
intimidated by the national champs. The Cardinal
jumped on Fullerton starter Mike Belanger — son
of former Baltimore Orioles shortstop Mark
Belanger — for four first-inning runs. Shortstop
John Verducci had the key hit, delivering a two
out, two-run single.
The lead did not last long. In the fourth and fifth
innings, the Titans exploded for nine runs, driving
Cardinal starter Kevin Kunkel and reliever David

Harris from the game. When the barrage was over,
Fullerton had a 12-4 lead.
Marquess was not overly upset by his pitchers'
inability to hold the early advantage. "It was just
one of those things," he said. "We gave them too
much — on walks, etc. You can't do that against a
team like Fullerton."
The Titans' fireworks overshadowed a potent
Cardinal offense that squeezed seven runs out of
seven hits and six walks. Walt Harris, Stanford's
weekend hitting star, had two hits and scored two
runs. Although it only made the final score more
respectable, Rick Lundblade's seventh-inning
home run, his second of the season, showed that he
may be an answer to the Cardinal's power needs.
Marquess had a simple explanation of what hap
pened: "We didn't pitch well, and they hit the ball
extremely well."
The beginning of Friday's game was similar to
that of the previous day's. Stanford took the lead in
the first inning, as Pete Stanicek doubled and was
driven in by a Lundblade single. By the bottom of
the fourth, the Cardinal had increased its advan
tage to 4-0 and had chased Fullerton starter Dion

Beck from the mound.
This time, however, the Cardinal staff was able
to make the lead stand up, as pitchers Rob Was
senaar and Rick Dietz shut down the Titan bats.
Wassenaar earned his first win of the season, al
lowing three runs and seven hits in seven-and-two
thirds innings. "Rob pitched an outstanding game,"
Marquess said. "He was in command all the way."
Dietz, who has saved both Cardinal victories,
relieved Wassenaar in the eighth inning and re
corded the final four outs — two of them on
strikeouts.
The Cardinal offense had another effective
game, banging out 12 hits against three Fullerton
pitchers. Harris led the Cardinal attack by going 4-
for-4, givingAhim a .545 average for the season.
Lundblade added two more hits and two runs
batted in.
Before the series began, Marquess said, "It will
be a good test for us early in the season."
Now that the series has ended, Marquess said he
believes his team passed the test. "Considering the
quality of t! * opposition and that it was early in the
season, i i: pleased with the way we played," he
said.
