### PETER CASTILLO Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford wrestling team pulled
one of the greatest upsets in its his
tory on Saturday, toppling Cal State-
Bakersfield 26-23 in Maples Pavilion.
It was the first time Stanford had
beaten the Roadrunners in 15 years.
Going into the meet, Stanford's
outlook was not good. Scott Wiggen
had the stomach flu, was unable to
make weight at 142 pounds and had
to compete at 150 pounds. Reserve
Mark Alex was also ill, so Horpel
used 134-pound reserve Reggie Kel
lum, who had to lose a couple of
pounds in order to make weight Sat
urday morning.
Kellum was pinned 54 seconds into
the match by Ray Hammond, who is
ranked eighth in the nation. Wiggen,
however, recovered unbelievably
quickly from his illness and
demolished Chuck Justice 17-2 for a
technical pin with only 10 seconds
remaining in the match. Wiggen was
able to score four three-point near
falls and easily dominate the match.
The meet did not start out well for
Stanford, as the Roadrunners opened
up a 9-0 lead. Cardinal B.G. Porter
(118 pounds) returned to the line-up
after a three-week layoff due to a rib
injury and lost by a technical pin to
Ed Woodburn 20-4. Neil Wartnik
(126 pounds) lost to Morteza Abedi
11-6, but showed marked improve
ment over his loss to Abedi last Sat
urday in the All-Cal Invitational.
The two initial losses seemed to
motivate rather than frustrate Jeff
Bradley (134 pounds), who
dominated his match from the outset
and blitzed John Martin, 15-2. After
Wiggen's victory Stanford trailed
only 15-11.
The pivotal match of the evening
was at 158 pounds, as Stanford's Pete
Rogers scored a major upset over Ar
deshir Asgari, 6-4. Asgari and Abedi
defected from the Iranian national
team last year in Venezuela and are
extremely tough Olympic and inter
national freestyle wrestlers. They are
still not used to the American col
legiate wrestling rules, however, and

Rogers was able to use that to his ad
vantage against Asgari.
"In the All-Cal, Asgari was scoring
at will against Rogers, but was tiring
at the end. Rogers was not able to
stop Asgari tonight, but hung in there
tough. At the end of the match Pete
was the toughest and converted this
for a takedown," Horpel said.
The strategy was to take away As
gari's best moves by avoiding tie-ups.

Rogers said that he wanted to stymie
and frustrate Asgari and that fatigue
would be a critical factor.
At the end of two periods Asgari
led 2-1, and was ahead 4-3 early in the
final period, but he made a fatal tati
cal error by allowing Rogers to
escape in order to score more points.
Rogers retaliated quickly by scoring a
takedown and keeping his advantage
to score one point for more than a
minute of riding time.

In a mild upset, Dave Lee could
only manage a 4-4 tie with
Bakersfield's How ard Lawson, whom
Lee beat in the finals of the All-Cal
Invitational. Senior Tom Mullen (177
pounds) closed out his last home
meet in style by defeating Chris Cor
mier 9-0, giving Stanford the team
lead for the first time, 20-17. Kurt
Kassulke also came through for Stan
ford by pinning Ron McLoy at 2:21

of the first period.
Kassulke's pin gave Stanford an
unbeatable 26-17 lead going into the
final match as Cardinal heavyweight
Terry Mclntyre wrestled another
huge opponent, Mike Monroe, and
lost 16-1 by a technical pin at the end
of the match.
The Cardinal next faces Northern
Arizona and Arizona State Frid.'»v
Biola University in La Mirad; <■
the next day competes in the Bi< iu
Invitational.

Though in control here, Stanford's Dave Lee wrestled to only a 4-4
draw against Cal State-Bakersfield's Howard Lawson at 167 pounds.
The Cardinal defeated Bakersfield, a perennial Division II power, for
the first time in 15 years.
