# Spikers open with victory

### ROB GRAHAM Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford men's volleyball team, ranked si h
nationally, opened its league schedule on a high note
Friday with a staight-set win over Cal State-
Northridge, 15-9, 15-7, 15-11.
Co-coach Don Shaw was satisfied with his squad's
performance. "We still have a lot of bugs to work out,
but at this point in the year we don't want to be playing
our best volleyball. We'd like to peak a little later in
the year," he said.
Though the Cardinal displayed moments of bril
liance against the Matadors, there were streaks of
ragged play. "Our concentration kind of waned in the
middle of some games, but we were able to regroup,"
Shaw said.
Shaw was referring to a lapse in the middle of the
first game when the Cardinal, in command with a 7-1
lead, surrendered a six-point run to Northridge and
found the game knotted at 7-7. Stanford was able to
recapture the momentum, however, and took the first
game behind the serving of senior Brett Monello.
After securing the second game, 15-7, the Cardinal
again faltered and fell behind 6-3 in the third. But a
seven-point run, underpinned by the blocking of senior
Craig Lauchner and freshman Scott Fortune, all but
put the match out of reach. From that point on, Stan
ford was in control.
"We were pretty much able to control the game,"

Shaw explained. "We took them out of their offense.
Even though we made some mistakes, we served really
well and that compensated."
The Cardinal benefited from a measurable height
advantage. The Matadors featured only one player —
6-foot-7 Dave Shaffer — who is taller than 6-2. Stan
ford, meanwhile, was able to field a lineup with four
players — Lauchner, Jon Root, Fortune and Chris
Braun — over 6-2.
As a result, the Cardinal was able to disrupt the
Northridge hitters. "Our blocking was fairly well or
ganized tonight," Shaw said, "and that made our
defense a lot easier."
Starting now, the Cardinal enters the toughest part
of its schedule in the California Intercollegiate Volley
ball Association. Stanford travels south today for a
road trip that has it playing four games in six days. The
first, tonight's contest with third-ranked USC, should
be a challenge.
The Trojans combine quickness and size, Shaw said.
"They have big guys with experience." Specifically,
USC features fifth-year senior Bill Yardley, a first
team All-American, and senior setter Rudy Dvorak.
USC, which finished fourth in the Santa Bar
bara/Michelob Lite Invitational last week, will have
some added motivation when it lines up against Stan
ford. On its way to the tournament championship, the
Cardinal handed the Trojans a semifinal loss in Santa
Barbara.
