The Stanford men's and women's
fencing teams came away with two
victories apiece at the University of
San Francisco last weekend, raising
their records to 13-1 and 11-2,
respectively.
The Cardinal women opened with
an easy 13-3 win against San Fran
cisco State, as the one-two punch of
Holly Tailor and Jennifer Yu
combined for seven victories.
Earlier in the season, the Cardinal
women, without Jennifer Yu, narrowly
beat SFSU 9-7, but this time around,
according to Head Coach Buzz Hurst,
We hit them with full strength and
the score indicated that."
Meanwhile, the Stanford men

fenced host USF, posting a 21-6 vic
tory. The win was highlighted by the
saber team's 9-0 effort, as Steve
Levitan and Craig Miott both went
undefeated in their three bouts.
Chris Gillen, described by Hurst as
"the man of the hour" for the foil
team, totaled three victories as the
foil team finished 7-2. The epee, in
consisent of late, struggled to a 5-4
victory. Vince Bradshaw and Larry
Murk each won two bouts.
Both Cardinal teams fenced Texas-
San Antonio. The Stanford women
started things off by coasting to a 12-
4 victory.
As usual, Tailor and Yu headed the
Cardinal attack, both tallying three
victories. Yu, undefeated on the West
Coast, has compiled a "remarkable"

50-3 record. Hurst said.
Aided by nine forfeited matches in
the saber competition, the Cardinal
men's team defeated San Antonio
19-8.
Hurst viewed San Antonio's
charitable gesture as unnecessary
since the saber team "would have
killed them anyway. The saber team
is smoking right now."
Hurst did not share the same en
thusiasm for his epee's 2-7 perfor
mance. "They beat the hell out of us.
We weren't in it. Bascially we got
thumped. ... It was breathtaking to
watch them thump us like that."
The foil team, headed by Eliot
Chu's 3-0 record, went on to finish 8-
I. The Cardinal will begin to prepare
for a duel meet against California this
weekend.
