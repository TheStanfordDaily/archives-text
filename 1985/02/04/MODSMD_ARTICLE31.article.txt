## Card drops two on trip south 
### PABLO MORALES 
A basketball game is likely to see a plethora of
sophisticated game plans, but one simple strategy
reigns foremost: putting points on the scoreboard.
This weekend, the Stanford women's basketball
team saw this strategy work against them while
losing to UCLA, 72-58, and Long Beach State, 98-
56, in a pair of Western Collegiate Athletic Associ
ation games.
Paced by senior center Kirsten Cummings' 14
points, Long Beach used its strong inside game to
dominate play in the first half Saturday and to wear
down the Cardinal in the second.
"Given their exceptional strength and speed, we
knew we had to score points and rebound in order

to control the tempo," Stanford Asst. Coach Mike
Kehoe said.
Foul trouble plagued Cardinal players for most
of the second half, destroying any semblance of of
fensive continuity. Forward Kami Anderson's 14
points brought the only offensive bright spot for the
Cardinal.
During the first half of Friday night's game
against UCLA, Stanford was able to force the
talent-laden Bruins out of their speedy transition
game with a patient ball-control offense. But a six
minute scoring drought in the beginning of the
second half erased the 29-28 lead Stanford enjoyed
at halftime and allowed UCLA to regroup of
fensively and take control of the game.

The trio of guard Virginia Sourlis, center Kim
Mercer and Anderson combined to tally 44 of
Stanford's 58 points, an indication of the kind of
offensive imbalance that kept the Cardinal out of
the game in the second half.
Annette Keur, a 6-4 sophomore center, led the
Bruins with a 27-point effort. She also pulled down
13 rebounds, helping Jackie Joyner, who had 10
rebounds, solidify the Bruins' inside game.
Long Beach strengthened its No. 3 national
ranking while remaining atop the WCAA with an
unblemished 5-0 record. UCLA is now 3-3 and in
fifth place in the conference, and Stanford falls to
2-4 and sixth place.
