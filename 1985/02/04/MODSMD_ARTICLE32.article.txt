## Stanford notches easy victory 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
Coach Frank Brennan was pleased
with the Stanford women's tennis
team's league opener against Fuller
ton State — not because the Cardinal
won 9-0, but because his team exhib
ited very little "sloppy, lazy" play.
Stanford won all nine matches
without losing a set, and, though
Brennan said the level of play was
"nothing special," it was a more
than-satisfactory season opener.
Stanford had most of its trouble
with Fullerton's Kristi Blankenship.
Linda Gates defeated her 6-2, 6-4 in
the No. 1 singles match.
"Kristi Blankenship has solid

ground strokes, passes very well and
can return tough serves — exactly
what you need when you play a
power player. She took a set from
Kate Gompert last year," Brennan
said.
Blankenship also played with
teammate Anita Salas in the No. 1
doubles match, losing to Gates and
Leigh Anne Eldredge, 6-1, 6-3.
Gates and Eldredge kept constant
pressure at the net, forcing Fullerton
to make defensive lobs or else try dig
ging up volleys at their feet.
"As a team, I think Linda and I
balance each other out," Eldredge
said. "Linda is a more flashy player
— she gets the big points, while I'm

more consistent," she said.
Gates considered her playing er
ratic. "I'm having some trouble with
my first serve — it wasn't going in.
On my second serves, they were
teeing off on the returns," she said.
In the No. 2 doubles match, Stan
ford's Kay Tittle and Stephanie
Savides defeated Michelle LeFebvre
and Debra Reichman 6-2, 6-1. Tittle
and Cindy Spiekerman were the two
freshmen from Stanford playing in
the match.
"It's really great to be playing as a
team now. We've been having the
challenges, and it's nice to not be
competing within the team," Tittle
said.

Brennan said Stanford's other
freshmen, Cari Hagey and Anna
Ivan, will probably be playing on a
regular basis in the future, but did not
play against Fullerton State because
of injury and an overabundance of
good players.
"Overall, I think this was a good
start for us," Brennan said. "To play
well helps to solidify the team after
challenges, which are almost over. I
thought the singles play was good.
I'm pleased."
Stanford's next match is tomorrow
against Pacific at Stockton. Stanford
is ranked No. I in the Intercollegiate
Tennis Coaches Association
preseason poll.
