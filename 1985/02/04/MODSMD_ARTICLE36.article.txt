# Many 'reach out' and help
## 
### LYNDA JOHNSON-TATE Editorial staff 
Many Stanford students never started their
homework Saturday. Instead they donated their time
helping members of nearby communities as part of
Stanford's Reach Out Today project.
Nearly 400 students spent the day organizing and
participating in golf and bowling tournaments at the
Veteran's Adminstration Hospital in Palo Alto, trail
maintenance at Castle Rock State Park, a party with
the residents of Hillhaven Convalescent Hospital, a
field day for children involved with the Partners and
Big Brothers/Big Sisters organizations and mainte
nance and painting at the Palo Alto Junior Museum.
The project, the second of its kind, was sponsored by
the Stanford Volunteer Network, an organization es
tablished in September 1984 to provide resources for
people interested in public service and to encourage
student volunteers.
Peter Spivack, a 1984 Stanford graduate and coord
inator of the network, said Saturday's Reach Out
Today program was just as successful as the first proj
ect last quarter. He said many students were surprised
to discover that they could make a difference.
"Reach Out Today may be the first taste many of

these students have had of public service, but with that
one taste we believe students will be hooked," he said.
Spivack said students sometimes aren't aware that
their contributions can have such a lasting effect on
children or senior citizens. "You can't see what you
have done, but you know that what you have done is
going to last."
Students from Murray House visited the residents at
Hillhaven Convalescent Hospital and spent time sing
ing, talking and playing Trivial Pursuit. One elderly
resident asked a student for a manicure.
Sophomore Lisa Richardson, who coordinated the
event, said, "It was a sobering experience. A man
asked one of us 'Could you take me home?' 2nd an
other woman, who had killed us at Trivial Pursuit,
cried when we left. It made us want to keep in touch
with some of them."
Students from Cardenal in Florence Moore Hall
spent the afternoon at the Palo Alto Junior Museum,
where children are exposed to hands-on exhibits.
Sophomore Hillary Kircher, coordinator of the
museum project, said she and seven other students
spent "three to four hard hours" painting. Kircher said
many students were initially reluctant to get involved,
but later they all agreed: "This is actually fun!"
