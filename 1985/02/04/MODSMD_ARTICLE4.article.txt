# C-IR member urges strong policy
## 
### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER Senior staff writer 
Two weeks after the Committee on Investment
Responsibility (C-IR) agreed to recommend condi
tional divestment of Motorola Inc., one member of
the committee will propose that the University
adopt a more aggressive divestment policy at the C
IR meeting tomorrow evening.
Mark Landesmann, a fifth-year student in inter
national policies studies, will ask the committee to
consider "an active and encompassing selective
divestment policy" for companies that do business
with South Africa.
Landesmann said he is satisfied with the C-IR's
first recommendation to the Board of Trustees, but
feels it did not go far enough.
"It would be false and even counterproductive to
consider the decision we made at the last meeting
to be an adequate response to the much broader
issue raised," Landesmann said in a memo to the
other 1,1 committee members.
In October, Stanford students voted by a four

to-one margin to divest of Motorola and to es
tablish strict criteria for selective divestment of
companies in the future. Landesmann said he is
trying to follow through on the second of these
clauses.
In the Jan. 30 document to the C-IR members,
Landesmann criticized the committee, saying, "The
C-IR has over the last eight years failed to imple
ment an active divestment policy and has not regu
larly addressed the possibility of divestment for the
'worst' companies (in South Africa)."
Landesmann recommends two solutions:
• The University should adopt "mechanized rules
and criteria that allow for automatic divestment" of
morally questionable companies.
• The University should establish a task force to
study the conduct of companies in Stanford's
portfolio.
Richard Brody, chairman of the C-IR and pro
fessor of political science, said, "I hold a very small
likelihood that this (Landesmann's document)
would be accepted as it stands." He declined to

speculate on the C-IR's stance, saying, "I won't
discuss the committee business until the commis
sion meets."
Brody said the committee has a full agenda, and
a decision might not be reached tomorrow.
On Jan. 15 the C-IR recommended the Univer
sity divest of its holdings in Motorola — 94,000
shares valued at more than $3.2 million — if the
company resumes sales to the South African mili
tary or police.
Ihe Board of Trustees' Special Committee on
Investment Responsibility will take up the issue at
next Wednesday's meeting.
Only portions of the report will be presented to
the board, Brody said. He added that the C-IR's
recommendations are designed to "help the trus
tees" decide about divestment from South African
corporations.
"Motorola is undoubtedly the one that has the
most obvious indifference to blacks in South
