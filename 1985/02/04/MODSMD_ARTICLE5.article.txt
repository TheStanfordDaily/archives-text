# Hayden: Improve U.S.-Israeli link

### EDITH PEPPER 
By cultivating a stronger rela
tionship with Israel and develop
ing alternative energy sources,
the United States can reduce its
reliance on Saudi Arabia and
assert its independence in foreign
policy, said California As
semblyman Tom Hayden (D-
Santa Monica).
Addressing an audience of ap
proximately 300 people at the
Sixth Annual Israel Education
Day in Kresge Auditorium yester
day, Hayden warned that the
United States is ignoring "anti
democratic impulses" by accord
ing respect to those nations it
depends on economically. This,
Hayden said, prohibits the country
from "remaining independent in
our foreign policy."
Hayden, one of the leaders of
Students for a Democratic Society
in the 19605, said the economic
ties between Saudi Arabia and the

United States are based not on "a
moral relationship but short-term
calculations of interest." Relation
ships such as these, he said, make
"the future of democracy
cloudier."
Hayden said democracy over
seas is connected to our economic
policies.
"We have the ability to preserve
democracy in Israel as well as in
the United States," Hayden said,
but realizing this goal will depend
on seeking economic ties with
countries that are not diabolically
opposed to our "fundamental in
terests."
Hayden said technological
cooperation between Israel and
the United States is essential "in
the interest of preserving . . .
democracy." He pointed to exam
ples where such cooperation is
already underway.
