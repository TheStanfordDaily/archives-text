# Coffee House loses $80,000
## Confidential memo reveals debt 
### CLINT HIGHFILL Editorial staff 
The Coffee House, Inc., owned and
operated by the ASSU, has run up
losses of about $80,000 in the four
years since the ASSU took over, The
Daily has learned.
According to a seven-page docu
ment prepared for student senators
and obtained by The Daily, the
ASSU "will have to essentially write
off losses incurred" because the mag
nitude of the losses makes it "unlikely
that we can recover them through
profits in a subsequent contract."
The impact of these losses on the
financial standing of the ASSU is not
clear.
The Coffee House is legally an in
dependent corporation, so the ASSU
would not be liable for its debt, ac
cording to an ASSU senator who
asked not to be named. But the
ASSU will inevitably lose some
money because the Coffee House will
be unable to repay loans made to it by
the parent organization.
"There are so many permutations
that it's impossible to predict" the ex
tent of the ASSU's losses, according
to the senator.
But despite this revelation, the
ASSU Senate voted Tuesday to bid to
operate the Coffee House for five
more years. The confidential docu
ment was made available to senators
one day prior to the meeting.
The ASSU rents the space for the
Coffee House from Tresidder Union,
and the current contract with Tresid
der expires Aug. 31, 1985. B.ds tor
the next five-year contract will be
taken in the beginning of May, ac
cording to Nanci Howe, assistant
director of Tresidder.
The debt began mounting in 1982
when "the difficulties of the first year
of operation" led to a position
$36,000 in the red.
In addition, a sizable bloc of the
debt was acquired during autumn
quarter of 1982 when a labor strike
closed down University Food Service.
Just before the strike occurred, the
Coffee House made changes in its
serving operations which inadver
tently caused it to lose 25 cents on
every sandwich it sold, according to
Todd Kerr, chairman of the Coffee
House board of directors. With the
heavy use of the Coffee House by stu
dents during the strike, autumn quar
ter losses quickly reached $30,000,
according to the document.
The business did manage to earn
profits in both the second year of op
eration and last year, but these earn
ings were small relative to the debts
already run up.

After a good January, the Coffee
House is close to breaking even this
year, according to Kerr, also a mem
ber of the Council of Presidents
(COP).
Many factors are cited to explain
the corporation's troubles.
For one, the ASSU agreed to pay
33 percent more of its gross profits as
rent to Tresidder than it should have
in order to break even, according to
the documents.
In addition to the high rent, the
documents list "severe managerial
problems" and relatively flat sales as
problems leading to the Coffee
House's dismal profit picture.
Kerr's comments in the confiden
tial reports were optimistic for the
future. "Because we have learned the
faults within the last (Coffee House
bid) proposal made by the ASSU, our
next one should be a more educated
one," he wrote.
Even given a new, more reasonable
rent contract with Tresidder, however,
the desirability of the ASSU continu
ing to operate the Coffee House is
unclear.
The first ofder ol business would
undoubtedly be making a profit or at
least staying out of debt.
Coffee House President Mark

Todd Kerr
Chairman of Coffee House board
Thornburgh, for one, believes there's
"no reason why the Coffee House
cannot profitably run with good man
agement."
This year's board of directors "is
smart; they're no dummies," said
Kerr.
Kerr also believes that labor costs,
which contributed to the debt, have
been brought under control. "We're
very competitive with the restaurant
industry" in labor costs, Kerr said.
