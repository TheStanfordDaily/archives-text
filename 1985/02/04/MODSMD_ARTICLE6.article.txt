# Coffee House loses $80,000
## Confidential memo reveals debt 
### CLINT HIGHFILL Editorial staff 
The Coffee House, Inc., owned and
operated by the ASSU, has run up
losses of about $80,000 in the four
years since the ASSU took over, The
Daily has learned.
According to a seven-page docu
ment prepared for student senators
and obtained by The Daily, the
ASSU "will have to essentially write
off losses incurred" because the mag
nitude of the losses makes it "unlikely
that we can recover them through
profits in a subsequent contract."
The impact of these losses on the
financial standing of the ASSU is not
clear.
The Coffee House is legally an in
dependent corporation, so the ASSU
would not be liable for its debt, ac
cording to an ASSU senator who
asked not to be named. But the
ASSU will inevitably lose some
money because the Coffee House will
be unable to repay loans made to it by
the parent organization.
"There are so many permutations
that it's impossible to predict" the ex
tent of the ASSU's losses, according
to the senator.
But despite this revelation, the
ASSU Senate voted Tuesday to bid to
operate the Coffee House for five
more years. The confidential docu
ment was made available to senators
one day prior to the meeting.
The ASSU rents the space for the
Coffee House from Tresidder Union,
and the current contract with Tresid
der expires Aug. 31, 1985. B.ds tor
the next five-year contract will be
taken in the beginning of May, ac
cording to Nanci Howe, assistant
director of Tresidder.
The debt began mounting in 1982
when "the difficulties of the first year
of operation" led to a position
$36,000 in the red.
In addition, a sizable bloc of the
debt was acquired during autumn
quarter of 1982 when a labor strike
closed down University Food Service.
Just before the strike occurred, the
Coffee House made changes in its
serving operations which inadver
tently caused it to lose 25 cents on
every sandwich it sold, according to
Todd Kerr, chairman of the Coffee
House board of directors. With the
heavy use of the Coffee House by stu
dents during the strike, autumn quar
ter losses quickly reached $30,000,
according to the document.
The business did manage to earn
profits in both the second year of op
eration and last year, but these earn
ings were small relative to the debts
already run up.

After a good January, the Coffee
House is close to breaking even this
year, according to Kerr, also a mem
ber of the Council of Presidents
(COP).
Many factors are cited to explain
the corporation's troubles.
For one, the ASSU agreed to pay
33 percent more of its gross profits as
rent to Tresidder than it should have
in order to break even, according to
the documents.
In addition to the high rent, the
documents list "severe managerial
problems" and relatively flat sales as
problems leading to the Coffee
House's dismal profit picture.
Kerr's comments in the confiden
tial reports were optimistic for the
future. "Because we have learned the
faults within the last (Coffee House
bid) proposal made by the ASSU, our
next one should be a more educated
one," he wrote.
Even given a new, more reasonable
rent contract with Tresidder, however,
the desirability of the ASSU continu
ing to operate the Coffee House is
unclear.
The first ofder ol business would
undoubtedly be making a profit or at
least staying out of debt.
Coffee House President Mark

Todd Kerr
Chairman of Coffee House board
Thornburgh, for one, believes there's
"no reason why the Coffee House
cannot profitably run with good man
agement."
This year's board of directors "is
smart; they're no dummies," said
Kerr.
Kerr also believes that labor costs,
which contributed to the debt, have
been brought under control. "We're
very competitive with the restaurant
industry" in labor costs, Kerr said.

Senate Chair Eric Berg, however,
warned in the confidential papers that
owning the Coffee House may be
a substantial risk for the ASSU.
"Our experience indicates that the
upside and downside potentials are
very unequal: It doesn't seem likely
that we'll ever do significantly better
than anticipated, but we've seen that
it's quite easy to do a whole lot
worse," Berg said.
Even if the Coffee House doesn't
become profitable, "money isn't the
only thing. ... As long as we can
break even and give the ASSU a good
return, we'll be successful,"
Thornburgh said.
From the viewpoint of the Tresid
der management, however, profits
are a major concern, and the ASSU
has yet to prove that it can create
them.
"The total number of customers
. . . has declined about 17 percent in
the four-and-one-half years they've
been there . . . (and) revenues have
increased only about 4 percent,"
Howe said.
And even the increase in revenues
has "not been as great as budgeted,"
she said. Howe explained that Tresid
der, which is owned by the University
but managed independently, must
have earnings increases that keep
pace with increases in University
costs.

In addition, the ASSU would like
to renew its contract in order to main
tain the Coffee House's atmosphere
and to provide students with jobs and
experience.
The old, pre-ASSU Coffee House
was "a pit, kind of commercial and in
bad taste," said Kerr. He fears the
Coffee House would revert to its old
ways if a commercial contractor
started running it again.
Kerr also asserted in the confiden
tial papers that having the ASSU run
ning the Coffee House gives students
jobs and unique management oppor
tunities which would be unavailable
should a private contractor begin
operating it.
However, Cathy Le√ülanc, adminis
trative assistant for Servomation Inc.,
said that students manage the Corner
Pocket operation in Tresidder and
that the company's student
employees have starting wages about
$1.50 higher than those of students
starting to work in the Coffee House.
Servomation was the only other
bidder when the ASSU won its pres
ent contract, and Le Blanc said that,
although she had not heard Tresidder
was going to open the bidding for a
new contract, Servomation would
"love to bid on it" should the oppor
tunity arise.
Whether the ASSU operates it or
not, Tresidder officials say a
coffee house would remain. Should
the ASSU lose the contract, "We
would want to keep the basic compo
nents of the Coffee House," Howe
said.

a substantial risk for the ASSU.
"Our experience indicates that the
upside and downside potentials are
very unequal: It doesn't seem likely
that we'll ever do significantly better
than anticipated, but we've seen that
it's quite easy to do a whole lot
worse," Berg said.
Even if the Coffee House doesn't
become profitable, "money isn't the
only thing. ... As long as we can
break even and give the ASSU a good
return, we'll be successful,"
Thornburgh said.
From the viewpoint of the Tresid
der management, however, profits
are a major concern, and the ASSU
has yet to prove that it can create
them.
"The total number of customers
. . . has declined about 17 percent in
the four-and-one-half years they've
been there . . . (and) revenues have
increased only about 4 percent,"
Howe said.
And even the increase in revenues
has "not been as great as budgeted,"
she said. Howe explained that Tresid
der, which is owned by the University
but managed independently, must
have earnings increases that keep
pace with increases in University
costs.

In addition, the ASSU would like
to renew its contract in order to main
tain the Coffee House's atmosphere
and to provide students with jobs and
experience.
The old, pre-ASSU Coffee House
was "a pit, kind of commercial and in
bad taste," said Kerr. He fears the
Coffee House would revert to its old
ways if a commercial contractor
started running it again.
Kerr also asserted in the confiden
tial papers that having the ASSU run
ning the Coffee House gives students
jobs and unique management oppor
tunities which would be unavailable
should a private contractor begin
operating it.
However, Cathy Le√ülanc, adminis
trative assistant for Servomation Inc.,
said that students manage the Corner
Pocket operation in Tresidder and
that the company's student
employees have starting wages about
$1.50 higher than those of students
starting to work in the Coffee House.
Servomation was the only other
bidder when the ASSU won its pres
ent contract, and Le Blanc said that,
although she had not heard Tresidder
was going to open the bidding for a
new contract, Servomation would
"love to bid on it" should the oppor
tunity arise.
Whether the ASSU operates it or
not, Tresidder officials say a
coffee house would remain. Should
the ASSU lose the contract, "We
would want to keep the basic compo
nents of the Coffee House," Howe
said.

The Coffee House continues to be a favorite Stanford hangout, valued
for its food, atmosphere and convenient location.
The Coffee House, Inc., owned and
operated by the ASSU, has run up
losses of about $80,000 in the four
years since the ASSU took over, The
Daily has learned.
According to a seven-page docu
ment prepared for student senators
and obtained by The Daily, the
ASSU "will have to essentially write
off losses incurred" because the mag
nitude of the losses makes it "unlikely
that we can recover them through
profits in a subsequent contract."
The impact of these losses on the
financial standing of the ASSU is not
clear.
The Coffee House is legally an in
dependent corporation, so the ASSU
would not be liable for its debt, ac
cording to an ASSU senator who
asked not to be named. But the
ASSU will inevitably lose some
money because the Coffee House will
be unable to repay loans made to it by
the parent organization.
"There are so many permutations
that it's impossible to predict" the ex
tent of the ASSU's losses, according
to the senator.
But despite this revelation, the
ASSU Senate voted Tuesday to bid to
operate the Coffee House for five
more years. The confidential docu
ment was made available to senators
one day prior to the meeting.
The ASSU rents the space for the
Coffee House from Tresidder Union,
and the current contract with Tresid
der expires Aug. 31, 1985. B.ds tor
the next five-year contract will be
taken in the beginning of May, ac
cording to Nanci Howe, assistant
director of Tresidder.
The debt began mounting in 1982
when "the difficulties of the first year
of operation" led to a position
$36,000 in the red.
In addition, a sizable bloc of the
debt was acquired during autumn
quarter of 1982 when a labor strike
closed down University Food Service.
Just before the strike occurred, the
Coffee House made changes in its
serving operations which inadver
tently caused it to lose 25 cents on
every sandwich it sold, according to
Todd Kerr, chairman of the Coffee
House board of directors. With the
heavy use of the Coffee House by stu
dents during the strike, autumn quar
ter losses quickly reached $30,000,
according to the document.
The business did manage to earn
profits in both the second year of op
eration and last year, but these earn
ings were small relative to the debts
already run up.

After a good January, the Coffee
House is close to breaking even this
year, according to Kerr, also a mem
ber of the Council of Presidents
(COP).
Many factors are cited to explain
the corporation's troubles.
For one, the ASSU agreed to pay
33 percent more of its gross profits as
rent to Tresidder than it should have
in order to break even, according to
the documents.
In addition to the high rent, the
documents list "severe managerial
problems" and relatively flat sales as
problems leading to the Coffee
House's dismal profit picture.
Kerr's comments in the confiden
tial reports were optimistic for the
future. "Because we have learned the
faults within the last (Coffee House
bid) proposal made by the ASSU, our
next one should be a more educated
one," he wrote.
Even given a new, more reasonable
rent contract with Tresidder, however,
the desirability of the ASSU continu
ing to operate the Coffee House is
unclear.
The first ofder ol business would
undoubtedly be making a profit or at
least staying out of debt.

Todd Kerr
Chairman of Coffee House board
Thornburgh, for one, believes there's
"no reason why the Coffee House
cannot profitably run with good man
agement."
This year's board of directors "is
smart; they're no dummies," said
Kerr.
Kerr also believes that labor costs,
which contributed to the debt, have
been brought under control. "We're
very competitive with the restaurant
industry" in labor costs, Kerr said.

warned in the confidential papers that
