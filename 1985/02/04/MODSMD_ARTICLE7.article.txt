# Israeli: Keep tight defense
## 
### MARK LAWRENCE 
The former military governor of two Israeli
provinces said yesterday that Israel must maintain a
strong defense in order to protect its national security.
In the first of three keynote speeches at Stanford's
sixth annual Israel Education Day, Aryeh Shalev said
Israel should continue to emphasize military prepared
ness "as long as there is no overall and comprehensive
peace'' in the Middle East.
Shalev, now a writer and researcher at Columbia
University and the University of Tel Aviv, told a
Kresge Auditorium audience of more than 200 people,
" Israel will need a strong and efficient military that can
both deter the Arabs from starting a war and win a war
if it is started.
"The existence of a strong army is not merely to
have military superiority but to force the Arabs to seek
peaceful, diplomatic means to bring about peace," he
said.
Shalev said that in the Arab-Israeli conflict both par
ties have advantages and disadvantages.
If united against Israel, the Arab nations would en
joy a great quantitative advantage, he said.
After mobilization, the Arab force would include,
based on Shalev's figures, 1.9 million
troops. Israel's force can number no
more than 440,000 troops. The
united Arab force would outnumber
Israeli forces by more than two-to
one in divisions, nine-to-one in high
quality tanks, four-to-one in fighter
planes and eight-to-one in air bases,
Shalev said. He said the Arab nations
also enjoy greater financial resources.
Israel, however, benefits from the
fact that the "Arab countries are
divided and split as never before."
Shalev cited the Iran-Iraq war, the
conflict in Lebanon and disapproval
by the rest of the Arab world of the
Egypt-Israeli peace agreements as
examples. Israel also has the
qualitative advantage of "better
equipment and troops," he said.
"For the coming year, I do not
think a general war launched by the
Arabs is a feasibility," Shalev said,
noting the present "balance" of mili
tary advantages. He went on,
however, to point out that terrorism,
specifically by the Palestine Libera
tion Organization, will continue to
occur despite highly successful efforts
to stop it.
Shalev made the distinction that
"terrorism is a threat but not a risk to
the existence of Israel."
Shalev outlined what he believes to
be a good strategy for Israel to use in
order to avoid a long-term "general"
war."
• Israel should "avoid acts which
might push the Arab states to unite
against Israel."
• Israel must work to detect Arab
preparations for war and avoid being
taken by surprise, a situation in which
the Arabs could best exploit their
quantitative advantages.
• Israel must keep its forces in the
West Bank "as long as there is a
threat of war." The West Bank,
Shalev explained, is higher in eleva
tion and therefore more strategically
advantageous than the narrow coastal
plain below which includes the vital
cities of Haifa, Tel Aviv and
Jerusalem.
• Israel must also maintain its
qualitative advantages in troops and
equipment.
• Finally, Israel must be prepared to
launch a pre-emptive strike in case an
imminent Arab attack is detected.
After his address, Shalev said Israel
is willing to begin negotiating to end
the long-standing Arab-Israeli con
flict. "Negotiation depends on the
other side," and to this point, only
Egypt has shown willingness, he said.
