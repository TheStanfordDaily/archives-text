Tutu calls for pressure from West
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Bishop Desmond Tutu, the
Nobel Peace laureate, called on the West yesterday to impose "punitive
economic sanctions" on South Africa, including the withdrawal of
foreign investments, if the white-minority regime here does not begin
"actively dismantling" its system of racial separation within the next two
years. >
Speaking at his installation as the Anglican bishop of Johannesburg.
Tutu, 53, urged greater international political, diplomatic and economic
pressure on the Pretoria government in the meantime to push it toward
negotiations with the black majority on the country's future.
He listed these criteria for progress: an end to the forced resettlement
of blacks, abolition of regulations restricting them from working in ur
ban areas and living there with their families, recognition of blacks as full
South African citizens, strengthening of black labor unions, and the
rapid improvement of education and vocational training for blacks.
Tutu had said last week that without concrete progress, the govern
ment's reform proposals would be "grossly insufficient" because they
were not based on talks with black leaders and did not fully reflect the
aspirations of blacks.
The black prelate also urged the government yesterday to free the
jailed leaders of the African National Congress, the oldest anti
apartheid group, and to grant all political prisoners and exiles full am
nesty so negotiations can be held with the black community's "authentic
leaders." Tutu offered to act as an intermediary between the African
National Congress and the government.
Although he did not refer directly to Botha's recent reform proposals,
Tutu made clear that he would measure the government by its actions,
not its promises.
Pravda stresses space weapons ban
MOSCOW — The Soviet press yesterday issued new criticism of U.S.
space weapons research and said the "only pattern" for drawing up an
arms accord would be to include a ban on space weapons.
Commentaries by the Communist Party daily Pravda and the military
newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda underscored the importance of such a ban
to the Soviet Union as it prepares for the new arms control talks in
Geneva.
Soviet and U.S. negotiators are to begin discussions on space weap
ons, medium-range missiles and strategic nuclear forces on March 12.
Soviet officials and media have been conducting a vigorous campaign to
stress that any proposed arms agreement that does not include space
weapons will not be acceptable to the Kremlin.
"The upcoming Soviet-American talks in Geneva may become an im
portant landmark," Pravda said in an article by Igor Biryukov. "The ac
cord reached on the subject and aims of these talks opens the possibility
for a serious and fruitful examination of issues pertaining to preventing
an arms race in outer space and putting an end to it on Earth."
Pravda said that formula •— the linkage of space and nuclear weapons
— contains "the only pattern possible under present day conditions for
the resolution of the problems" of arms control.
Echoing statements by Soviet leader Konstantin Chernenko and
Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko, Pravda stressed the "organic inter
connection" of the three sets of talks that begin next month.
"The point is to abide honestly by the accord reached in Geneva (on
linking the three areas of arms control). The soviet delegation will have
instructions to act precisely this way. We expect the same attitude from
the U.S.A," the newspaper said.
Krasnaya 'Zvezda charged that U.S. research into an anti-missile
defense system based in space is destabilizing Soviet security.
"The real meaning of the United States' 'initiative' in the field of
'strategic defense' is to undermine strategic stability," the newspaper
said.
Pope pleads for end to fighting
AYACUCHO, Peru — Surrounded by the tightest security cordon of
his current South American trip, here in the heartland of a violent
Maoist guerrilla movement, Pope John Paul II voiced an urgent plea to
the rebels yesterday to lay down their arms.
"I beg you with pain in my heart," the pontiff pleaded in this Andean
mountain town. Ayacucho is the birthplace of Sendero Luminoso
(Shining Path), a guerrilla band whose war with the government has
claimed more than 4,000 lives since 1980 and led to emergency military
rule over an 11-county region.
"To those who have let themselves be tricked by false ideologies to
the point of thinking that terror and aggression . . . can lead to a better
world, evil is never the road to good," the Pope proclaimed.
Speaking in a slightly raspy voice, the only visible sign during his tiring
three-city schedule yesterday that he had carried on despite a mild fever
and sore throat the day before, John Paul continued:
"The cruel logic of violence leads nowhere. No good is obtained by
contributing to its growth. If your objective is a more just and fraternal
Peru, seek the paths of dialogue and not those of violence."
-The pope was vigorously cheered and applauded by a tightly
controlled crowd here of about 20,000 who, after careful screening,
were admitted to the parking lot area of the airport to hear him.
Peruvian authorities had initially resisted the pope's request to speak in
Ayacucho. When he insisted, they relented but limited him to a 90-
minute stop at the airport.
Earlier yesterday. John Paul and flew into the old Inca capital of
Cuzco, where thousands of colorfully dressed descendants of the ancient
civilization had gathered on the stone foundations and battlements of an
1 1,000-foot-high mountain fortress that was an engineering marvel of
the Inca age.
Long a growing center of the coca plant, mostly for local Andean Indi
ans who chew its potent leaves, the Cuzcoans remained impassive as the
pontiff warned them of the "corrupting business" that has grown up
around cocaine, the plant's end product.
Seemingly unaffected by the chilled mountain air and rarified altitude,
John Paul spoke forcefully for Indian rights, including land reform, and
for more official attention by authorities to "the problem of justice and
humanity."
Tavern bomb injures servicemen
ATHENS, Greece — An explosion that injured dozens of U.S. ser
vicemen serving at tHe Ellinikon Air Base here Saturday night was
caused by a bomb, Greek police said yesterday.

50 percent of his body.
Seventy-eight people were hurt by the explosion in Bobby's Bar, most
of them U.S. military personnel. Seven were Greeks, and the others
foreign tourists.
Police said they had found the remnants of a time fuse in the bar in the
Athens suburb of Glvfada. The bar. located near the U.S. base, is
popular among military men.
Of 15 U.S. servicemen still hospitalized yesterday, two were flown to a
U.S. Air Force hospital in West Germany. The transfer of another five
to the air force hospital is under consideration.
The remaining eight are out of danger, doctors said.

advisers. President Augusto Pinochet decreed a 90-day extension of the
state of siege Saturday to stifle opposition political activity throughout

to Pinochet. It i<* led by the illegal Communist Party, the strongest in
Latin America outside Cuba.

to the Soviet Union as it prepares for the new arms control talks in
Geneva.
Soviet and U.S. negotiators are to begin discussions on space weap
ons, medium-range missiles and strategic nuclear forces on March 12.
Soviet officials and media have been conducting a vigorous campaign to
stress that any proposed arms agreement that does not include space
weapons will not be acceptable to the Kremlin.
"The upcoming Soviet-American talks in Geneva may become an im
portant landmark," Pravda said in an article by Igor Biryukov. "The ac
cord reached on the subject and aims of these talks opens the possibility
for a serious and fruitful examination of issues pertaining to preventing
an arms race in outer space and putting an end to it on Earth."
Pravda said that formula •— the linkage of space and nuclear weapons
— contains "the only pattern possible under present day conditions for
the resolution of the problems" of arms control.
Echoing statements by Soviet leader Konstantin Chernenko and
Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko, Pravda stressed the "organic inter
connection" of the three sets of talks that begin next month.
"The point is to abide honestly by the accord reached in Geneva (on
linking the three areas of arms control). The soviet delegation will have
instructions to act precisely this way. We expect the same attitude from
the U.S.A," the newspaper said.
Krasnaya 'Zvezda charged that U.S. research into an anti-missile
defense system based in space is destabilizing Soviet security.
"The real meaning of the United States' 'initiative' in the field of
'strategic defense' is to undermine strategic stability," the newspaper
said.
Pope pleads for end to fighting
AYACUCHO, Peru — Surrounded by the tightest security cordon of
his current South American trip, here in the heartland of a violent
Maoist guerrilla movement, Pope John Paul II voiced an urgent plea to
the rebels yesterday to lay down their arms.
"I beg you with pain in my heart," the pontiff pleaded in this Andean
mountain town. Ayacucho is the birthplace of Sendero Luminoso
(Shining Path), a guerrilla band whose war with the government has
claimed more than 4,000 lives since 1980 and led to emergency military
rule over an 11-county region.
"To those who have let themselves be tricked by false ideologies to
the point of thinking that terror and aggression . . . can lead to a better
world, evil is never the road to good," the Pope proclaimed.
Speaking in a slightly raspy voice, the only visible sign during his tiring
three-city schedule yesterday that he had carried on despite a mild fever
and sore throat the day before, John Paul continued:
"The cruel logic of violence leads nowhere. No good is obtained by
contributing to its growth. If your objective is a more just and fraternal
Peru, seek the paths of dialogue and not those of violence."
-The pope was vigorously cheered and applauded by a tightly
controlled crowd here of about 20,000 who, after careful screening,
were admitted to the parking lot area of the airport to hear him.
Peruvian authorities had initially resisted the pope's request to speak in
Ayacucho. When he insisted, they relented but limited him to a 90-
minute stop at the airport.
Earlier yesterday. John Paul and flew into the old Inca capital of
Cuzco, where thousands of colorfully dressed descendants of the ancient
civilization had gathered on the stone foundations and battlements of an
1 1,000-foot-high mountain fortress that was an engineering marvel of
the Inca age.
Long a growing center of the coca plant, mostly for local Andean Indi
ans who chew its potent leaves, the Cuzcoans remained impassive as the
pontiff warned them of the "corrupting business" that has grown up
around cocaine, the plant's end product.
Seemingly unaffected by the chilled mountain air and rarified altitude,
John Paul spoke forcefully for Indian rights, including land reform, and
for more official attention by authorities to "the problem of justice and
humanity."
Tavern bomb injures servicemen
ATHENS, Greece — An explosion that injured dozens of U.S. ser
vicemen serving at tHe Ellinikon Air Base here Saturday night was
caused by a bomb, Greek police said yesterday.

50 percent of his body.
Seventy-eight people were hurt by the explosion in Bobby's Bar, most
of them U.S. military personnel. Seven were Greeks, and the others
foreign tourists.

Athens suburb of Glvfada. The bar. located near the U.S. base, is
popular among military men.
Of 15 U.S. servicemen still hospitalized yesterday, two were flown to a
U.S. Air Force hospital in West Germany. The transfer of another five
to the air force hospital is under consideration.
The remaining eight are out of danger, doctors said.
Pinochet extends state of seige
SANTIAGO. Chile — Ignoring U.S. pressure and objections by some
advisers. President Augusto Pinochet decreed a 90-day extension of the
state of siege Saturday to stifle opposition political activity throughout
Chile.
The decree, published without comment in the Official Bulletin, main
tained special curbs on the press and on public gatherings until May 6
because of a "state of internal convulsion" in Chile.
Pinochet, an army general who toppled the Marxist government of
Salvador Allende in a 1973 coup, imposed the clampdown Nov. 6 to
combat a surge of terrorism and mass demonstrations for a swift return
to democracy He has insisted on adherence to a constitution that
prolongs his authoritarian rule at least until 1989.
Nti government official would comment on the state of siege Saturday.
Pinochet was away at his summer home.
A broad coalition of non-Marxist parties make up the main opposition
to Pinochet. It i<* led by the illegal Communist Party, the strongest in
Latin America outside Cuba.
Tutu calls for pressure from West
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Bishop Desmond Tutu, the
Nobel Peace laureate, called on the West yesterday to impose "punitive
economic sanctions" on South Africa, including the withdrawal of
foreign investments, if the white-minority regime here does not begin
"actively dismantling" its system of racial separation within the next two
years. >
Speaking at his installation as the Anglican bishop of Johannesburg.
Tutu, 53, urged greater international political, diplomatic and economic
pressure on the Pretoria government in the meantime to push it toward
negotiations with the black majority on the country's future.
He listed these criteria for progress: an end to the forced resettlement
of blacks, abolition of regulations restricting them from working in ur
ban areas and living there with their families, recognition of blacks as full
South African citizens, strengthening of black labor unions, and the
rapid improvement of education and vocational training for blacks.
Tutu had said last week that without concrete progress, the govern
ment's reform proposals would be "grossly insufficient" because they
were not based on talks with black leaders and did not fully reflect the
aspirations of blacks.
The black prelate also urged the government yesterday to free the
jailed leaders of the African National Congress, the oldest anti
apartheid group, and to grant all political prisoners and exiles full am
nesty so negotiations can be held with the black community's "authentic
leaders." Tutu offered to act as an intermediary between the African
National Congress and the government.
Although he did not refer directly to Botha's recent reform proposals,
Tutu made clear that he would measure the government by its actions,
not its promises.
