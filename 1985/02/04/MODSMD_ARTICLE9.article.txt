# Spending plan goes to the Hill
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — President Reagan sends a
$313.7 billion defense budget to Congress today,
seeking major spending boosts for nuclear weapons
and his "Star Wars" missile defense program but
relatively modest increases for training and other
programs that contribute to the readiness of con
ventional forces.
The Pentagon budget for fiscal 1986, which
begins Oct. 1, represents an increase over the cur
rent fiscal year of 5.9 percent after inflation. Under
the new blueprint, defense spending would account
for 6.6 percent of the nation's gross national prod
uct and would grow to 7.4 percent by 1990. By
comparison, the defense share of the GNP was 5.1
percent in 1980, two years before Reagan submit
ted his first complete budget, and 8.3 percent
during the Vietnam War 10 years earlier.

Reagan's defense spending plans are already un
der withering attack from Congressional
Republicans and Democrats alike, and are almost
certain to be shaved. Critics contend that a boost of
the magnitude being proposed is not justified at a
time when domestic programs are being slashed
and the deficit is continuing to spiral upward.
As one senior administration official noted at a
weekend news briefing, however. Congress —
despite its complaining — has thus far given the
president almost everything he asked for in his pro
posed five-year, $1 trillion defense buildup — the
largest p acetime increase in the nation's history.
Anu Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger,
arguing that the budget is as lean as it can be, said
at a new- riefing Saturday that the president's suc
cessful ctforts to boost defense spending over his

first term were responsible tor the Soviet Union s
new willingness to resume arms control talks.
"We believe our resolve to stay strong is what
brought the Soviets to the negotiating table."
Weinberger said, referring to the talks scheduled to
open in Geneva next month.
At the same time, he asserted, current world
conditions dictated the need to maintain that
growth in military spending. 'There s been no
diminution in the threat or the percept.on of the
threat, and it is the threat which dictates our na
tional security needs," he said.
While Reagan is seeking authority tor a Pent
agon budget of $313.7 billion, up from $284.5 bil
lion in the current fiscal year, the full amount will
not be paid out during the 12-month fiscal year be
cause of time lags on major defense contracts.
