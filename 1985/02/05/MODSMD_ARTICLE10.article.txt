## The
						return of... Bug Me 
### 
Dear Bug Me:
I have no questions to ask you
today. Could this be related to ions in
the air or humidity or temperature or
sunspots or is it apt to be a result of
some psycho-physiological quirk of
mine? - D.E.
Not to worry, D.E., hypochondria
never really killed people; they just
thought it did. Actually, Bug Me — a
weekly question-and-answer infor
mation column covering everything
interesting under the sun — hasn't
crawled across The Daily's pages since
1983, so your questions were prob
ably suffering a natural remission
which will go away soon, I hope.
In fact, I'm offering a challenge to
all readers to dust off those nagging
questions, those confounding
bugaboos, or anything that causes un
sightly curiosity and let me try to find
the answer.
This isn't like Trivial Pursuit; if a
question doesn't fall into a neat cate
gory, I won't throw wedgies at you.
Ask me anything at all. Just make it
printable.
Still don't have any ideas? You'll
never get your name in print at this
rate. Try these old samples from the
files — the same ones that produced
D.E.'s letter above — for inspiration.
• Is it true that Dr. Norman Shum
way offered a reward for the first
couple to make love in the hanging
planters at the med center? If so, how
much did he offer and what proof did
he require?
• Who decided the dimensions of an
eight-and-a-half by 11 inch piece of
paper? It seems sort of arbitrary. On
what authority did "they" make this
choice?
• Where do all those funny little
white Cushman carts go at night?
• On the back of my wristwatch is a
number: 206098. Under that it says,
"Nl." Does this mean anything, or
should I just keep on wearing it?
• Who is (was) Florence Moore,
anyway? Did she ever party?
• Where does one get refunds for
money lost in candy machines?
• Which is taller, Cal's Campanile or

Hoover Tower?
• Where do you find a notary public?
• Why are campus maps always
printed with north pointing off to the
bottom?
See how easy it is? Now all you
have to do is write down one of the
many questions buzzing around your
mind and send it to Bug Me, and you

won't have to go through the hassle of
finding an answer yourself. I will. On
second thought. . .
No, just kidding. I promise to be
more diligent — through sleet or hail
or dead of night — than your average
postman. Or at least I'll do my best.
