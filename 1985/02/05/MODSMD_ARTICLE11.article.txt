s
<£■ Would you answer any question an interviewer
3sked you to get a job?
p. You may think you have to to get a job with
jtome of the companies interviewing on campus.
an interviewer from Goldman Sachs al
£ifcgedly asked a woman whether she would have
an abortion to save her job. This question should
never have been asked, much less answered. The
. student complained, the Career Planning and
Placement Center acted, and Goldman Sachs
apologized, all of which we commend.
i,. The question is sexist. No man would be asked
the same thing. It is distressing that the inter
viewer, a recent Stanford graduate, wouldn't be
sensitive enough to the implications of this ques
tion to avoid it.
The Goldman Sachs interviewer also
reportedly asked questions involving religion,
drugs and sexual preference. Even if he was
simply trying to provoke a response from the stu
dents, these questions are discriminatory. Sure,

you can refuse to answer a question, but even the
fact that you find particular questions objec
tionable tells the interviewer something. If the
question were, "Are you religious?" or "Whom
do you sleep with?" which are both questions
said to have been asked, refusing to answer may
make the interviewer think he found your sore
spot.
Although the Goldman Sachs interviewer said
he only wanted to shake people up a bit, it would
be impossible for their reactions not to make
some impression on him. Although he might not
discriminate against the person on this basis, it
would be almost impossible for him not to make
some discriminations based on the response.
The CPPC should make it clear to prospective
interviewers that it demands a sensitivity in ques
tioning that goes beyond legal minimums. Stan
ford is a place where one should demand the
ideal, and not accept microcosms of the injustices
we'll all face in "the real world."
