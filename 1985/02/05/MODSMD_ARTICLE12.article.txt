# Turning Orwellian
## 
### 
The visions of an Orwellian destiny were
supposed to have ceased when 1984 ended just
over a month ago. But maybe George was just a
, year off.
Last week, the San Jose Mercury News re
ported that IBM, as well as several other com
panies, had instituted mandatory urinalysis drug
screening for applicants. In fact, IBM has been
„ -requiring the test for approximately the last year.
I The testing is a response to the growing use of
J cocaine and methamphetamines in the high-
J.-pressure and affluent world of Silicon Valley. As
i Dick O'Connell, a spokesman for IBM, told the
Ij-Times Tribune, "Problems at some locations
\ were traced to drugs."
j" Requiring urinalysis, however, reeks of inva-
J sion of privacy. Currently, there are no laws
such screening, but the American
£ v Civil Liberties Union has already begun consid-
J "ering possible measures, including litigation or
• .support for aggressive labor-union action.
r Private companies certainly have the right to
gather information about prospective employees.
Reliability, responsibility and competency all fall
\jvithin the definition of information in this case.

But what a person does on his own time is none
of a company's business. It has no bearing on how
that person will perform on the job, and that is
what a company should be concerned with.
Obviously, private life and work, as O'Connell
pointed out, overlap at times. When drug use
does begin to have an affect on the performance
of an employee, then the company should take
whatever steps are necessary, whether that be
dismissal or counseling.
But drug testing oversteps the line between
private life and work. It creates an environment
in which employees work and live under
suspicion. It destroys any kind of trust that an
employee or an employer should have in one an
other.
Some companies, despite problems they may
have had, understand this principle. At the FMC
Corp., where 10 employees were arrested in a
drug bust last year, spokeswoman Germaine
Cummings told the Times Tribune, "We're con
cerned about the kind of people we hire, but we
can be in tune with what kind of job they'll do
without an actual test like that."
