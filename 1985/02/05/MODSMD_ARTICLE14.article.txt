Corrupt material
It is very sad that the ASSU
agreed to permit the promoters of
the Tri-Star Pictures film "Heaven
Help Us" to offer a "free screening"
on campus.
Posters for the film, displayed
around campus, contain the follow
ing caption in the upper left corner:.
"The Brothers of Saint Basil's
School preached against vice, lust
and disrespect. But that never
stopped these guys." Under the title
of the film we read: "If God had
wanted them to be angels, He would
have given them wings."
It is a tragedy that young people,
seeking legitimate diversion and
entertainment, are presented with

this kind of morally corrupt material
As if they do not have immortal
souls!
Let us love and help one another
and put no stones in our brother's
path.

Socialist rhetoric
In the concluding paragraph of his
viewpoint (The Daily, Jan.3o), Ross
Boylon promises us a continuance of
enlightening viewpoints that will
attempt to change our view of
socialism.
Indeed, considering the first, the
thought of more of these long-winded

tomes makes me cringe. When we
boil down the verbiage under
"things-to-do" and look at the verbs,
we find the following: 1) must be
made; 2) must be made; 3) must be
made; 4) must be more! Small
wonder socialism "conjures up
images of massive, coercive central
governments, the gulag and terror."
And to this, we could add
"inefficiency," something to which
Afghanistan, Bulgaria, Czechoslo
vakia . . . Zimbabwe will attest.
Boylon and the SDSA, if you were
truly the humanitarians that you
believe yourselves to be, you would
spare us any more of your rhetoric.
Believe me, it's all been said before.
