# '70s child: Did you vote for Quisp or Quake?
## 
### 
Intone of my classes last quarter, we were
discassing how modern day toys such as G.I.
Joe.'-and urinating dolls socialize bourgeois
chjjclrcn into their capitalistic society. In the
mjfist of this rather heated discussion, this
girKlwho looked so spinsterly for a 20-year
old fhat I could imitate her walk, interjected:
"Well, when I was a child in the early
19705. ..." I was laughing so hard that I for
got>the rest of her sentence. This student
seeirted to address the group of 19- and 20-
year"-olds as if she were an old woman
recounting her past for the benefit of her
grandchildren.
Ttyis comment so absorbed my mind the
restÂ£pf last quarter that I'm positive it's the
reajon I flunked the class. I still can't get over
the.;fact that I'm now actually a member of a
laljpled generation. I keep forgetting that
questions concerning the Brady Bunch are
now considered trivia. Those black children I
used to see on the news (along with their par
ents in various civil rights demonstrations)
when I was three or four are actually doing
adult things like working and studying and
marrying. I can drive and vote, but I still re
member thinking to myself on my sixth
birthday, "Only 10 more years'til I drive!"
I was so intrigued by this new concept that I
took this almost obsessive interest in my past.
I began to explore how the early '70s shaped
the \vay I am today. When / was a child in the

early 19705, my hair was brown. Within a
year after 1 first saw the "blondes have more
fun" hair-coloring commercial, my hair
turned blond (no joke). Everyone seemed to
have Space Food Sticks in their lunch boxes.
Colorado and palominos were in. I even
found a 3-D palomino trading card in a box of
cereal once.

The still incomplete version of this list runs
through my head continually, and other
children of the early '70s add still more to the
list. Sometimes I have this competition with
this friend of mine who was equally in
fluenced by the media of the early '70s. She'll
say something like, "Quick, who did you vote
for, Ouisp or Quake?"
I'll say, "Quake, but Quisp won. What was
the television ad for the Cub Scouts in 1972-
73?"

"I don't know."
"Hey there, Cub Scout, cool cat, join us;
join our groovy gang!"
"I used to think Webelos meant 'We below
Boy Scouts,' but it means, 'We'll be loyal
scouts.' "
"Really? I used to think it was an animal,
and I would look it up in all the encyclopedias
to find out what it ate."
I realize not every child of the early '70s
lived in the San Fernando Valley with a
mother who liked Pop Tarts, children's art
books and"The Young and the Restless,"
but for other people of that era and myself,
media helped shape to a point our outlooks
today. I keep comparing "Hamlet" to Bugs
Bunny. The other night a friend from Yale
and I tried to imagine how different people
we knew would act if they had played Serge
on "Beverly Hills Cop."
Among the main reasons I'm glad I attend
ed Westlake School is the ability to say that I
went there at the same time Carol Burnett's
daughter did and that I had history with
"Natalie" from"The Facts of Life" and was
invited to see "Little Darlings" with her (I
couldn't go).
After four months of conspicuous intro
spection into my past, I'm now beginning to
focus on the present. I don't want to be evan
gelical, but the fact that we're accomplishing

anything after watching six hours of television
a day until 1978 is a miracle. All the good
bands nowadays are swarming with children
of the early '70s (the only guy in my senior
class who didn't go to college is in this band,
The Del Fuegos, and 1 keep reading rave
reviews about it in all these music sections). In
every magazine I read, they say things like,
"Eddie Murphy, 23, used to imitate Bull
winkle wi h uncanny accuracy when he was
younger," or, "We consider Dan Marino,
only 23 years old, to be one of the finest quar
terbacks ever to play the game of football."
Children of the early '70s are starting to make
their opinions known about domestic and
world affairs, and I expect to hear many
names from my generation within the next 20
years.
I figure there're a lot of cynical children from
my generation out there who are thinking,
"How idealistic and naive can you get?
What's so great about our generation of
media-infested kids who wore Billy the Kid
hand-me-downs?" I got my answer to these
negatives from this comic-book character
called The Flaming Carrot, the creation of a
child from the early '70s. He proclaims,
"Cynics will be shot."
To me, youth seems a useless time to be
cynical; at least you could wait until you're
middle-aged and you've tried all your plans
to save the world or be famous or get rich and

they've failed. So, this column is also a
reminder to all those youth who are resigned
and disgusted to do something and make
change. Otherwise, the children of 2010 will
think that we too believed that the Beatles
were the best band ever to hit pop music, and
I'd hate to have them think that were true.
Sometimes I watch "Entertainment
Tonight" and wish I were an actress so that I
could be interviewed and say something in
consequential like, "The 'hing that made me
want to be an actress was this day in fifth
grade when Julia Luber told me in the recess
line that the Fonz was dead. We were all so
grief-stricken that the girls began sobbing,
and the boys kept saying, 'Ay, ay,' with their
thumbs down. When I discovered it was only
a rumoi, I was so inspired that 1 decided I
wanted to follow in his footsteps. Well, I
haven't made it to Milwaukee yet, but I don't
regret anything I've done."
Of course, I'd want to tell them more about
what made me the way I am, but I realize the
interviewer would have to say, "Cut it, and
back to you, John," before I could say any
thing else. However, I'd know that other
children of the early '70s would be standing
by for their 30-second spot too, so you'd
know I'd just be loving it.
