## No candy from Goldman interviewer 
### 
I am writing because I had a gripe about my
Goldman Sachs interview and I did not get to voice
it in last week's article (The Daily, Jan.29). Mike
Werner, that mean bastard, did not give me a piece
of cpndy when I finished my interview. I inter
viewed with Hewlett-Packard a few weeks ago and

they_gave me a piece of candy after my interview.
Why is Mike Werner so mean, and is there any
thing the Career Planning and Placement Center
can do?
Actually, that is not the real reason at all.
Rather, I feel that The Daily's article on the
Goldman interviews, while presenting the "facts,"
did so out of context. Furthermore, the dissatisfac
tion of many Stanford students over their Goldman
interviews was due more to a fault of their own
than to the "improper" questioning by Michael
Werner.
One does not need to search long or hard to dis
cover that Goldman Sachs has a reputation for
employing particularly unconventional interview
ing tactics. Traditionally, Goldman likes to put two
of associates across the table from the inter
viewee. They do not hesitate to fire rapid, pointed
questions, insults or challenges.
Their tactics are not without reason. Investment
banking is a fast-paced, stressful business and indi
viduals involved must be quick, alert and strong.
(Qualities such as these cannot be determined from
resumes, transcripts or purely "friendly" inter
views. Goldman seeks to place the interviewee in
an unexpected situation, hoping he will take a stand
and'*rlefend it. The interviewers ask questions de
signed to incite, offend and surprise, expecting an
<

assertive, aggressive response. Clearly those stu
dents not prepared for such an encounter will tend
to misinterpret the questions and respond to them
in an inappropriate manner.
I think that Mike Werner knew the abortion
question was out of bounds and expected the
woman he was interviewing to tell him so. In my
opinion it was an issue to be resolved during the in
terview, not to be discussed, out of context, several
days later. The real question was not designed to
find out whether the woman would have an abor
tion but whether the woman would assert herself
during the interview.

Such a complaint reflects
upon the naivete of the
student rather than upon
the rudeness of the inter
viewer.

While the presentation of the story was a repre
sentation of the "facts," it failed to adequately
depict the circumstances discussed above. Even the
CPPC would agree that it is the duty of the student
to research the company he is interviewing with
before the interview. Any student, with the most
minimal effort, could have discovered Goldman's
reputation for aggressive interviews. Even
Goldman held an information session here this fall

where they alluded to their interviewing method.
Within the context of the interview, Werner's ques
tion was not sexist, as The Daily's article suggested.
This seems to be the case with many other
criticisms directed toward Werner. Some of the stu
dents being interviewed did not realize the purpose
of Werner's questioning, but rather were insulted
by the content.
Other complaints concerning Goldman's inter
viewing tactics seem almost unreal to me. I don't
think it is yet a law, or even a policy at Stanford, to
require interviewers to respond to the phrase,
"Nice to meet you," with, "Nice to meet you too!"
Such a complaint reflects upon the naivete of the
student rather than upon the rudeness of the inter
viewer.
Clearly, different companies have different per
sonal needs and their interviewing styles vary
accordingly. Requiring Goldman Sachs and
Hewlett-Packard to follow the same format would
be a great disservice to both companies and the stu
dent involved. By researching the company and
speaking to others who have worked, or even inter
viewed, there, a student can prepare himself for
these different approaches to the interview.
I think that, in this case. Werner's comments and
questions were received in a different vein than he
intended. I wish the students involved had resolved
the matter during the course of the interview rather
than report to the CPPC and wait for the director
to do something. One thing I think Stanford hopes
to teach all of us while we are here is to think and
act for ourselves, and it is unfortunate that some of
us, so close to graduation, have yet to learn that
simple lesson.
