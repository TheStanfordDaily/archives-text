tercollegiate Volleyball Association play and 9-2
overall, entered the contest with little experience in

v Light Invitational was played away
'.from Stanford, for the most part the crowds were
Impartial and considerate. That was not the case at
use.
. y Our guys are fairly young," said Co-Coach Don
Shaw after witnessing his team's disintegration.
"It's tough to play in SCs gym. But we have to
learn to go on the road and play." In any case, the

men will have plenty of opportunities to learn their
lessons. The Cardinal travels down the road to San
Diego State for its next match tomorrow.
The Cardinal's youth may have been the differ
ence. USC "played very well when they had to, and
that frustrated us," Shaw said. "We didn't handle
the frustration well."
While Stanford toiled to overcome frustration,
the No. 3-ranked Trojans benefitted from an extra
incentive. The Cardinal defeated USC in the semi
final round of the Santa Barbara Invite two weeks
ago and, as USC's Adam Horstman put it, "We
really wanted to make up for what happened in the
tournament."
Though the match would appear to have been
lopsided, Shaw felt his squad could have staged a
comeback. After the Trojans, already up one set,
had forged an 8-2 lead in the second, the Cardinal
rebounded to close to within one at 13-/2. But suc

cessive kills by USC's Adam Johnson, who ended
with 19 kills on the evening, and Adam Horstman
clinched the set for the Trojans.
"The second set was the turning point. If we had
won that game, we would have won the match,"
said Shaw.
In the third set, USC broke open a tight 10-9 set
with a match-ending barrage led by All-American
Bill Yardley and Honorable Mention All-
American Rudy Dvorak. "We had super intensity
and we played really steady," Trojan Coach Bob
Yoder said. "Our serving was tough."
The lone bright spot for Stanford was the play of
its own All-America selection, junior Jon Root.
Root led all players with 24 kills. After Root,
though, there was a drop off. Freshman Scott
Fortune was the Cardinal's next most potent
weapon with nine kills.
