# Trotters put on a show at Maples

### KEN STEVENS 
The Harlem Globetrotters, one of the most successful
and renowned teams in sports history, dazzled a near
caipacity crowd at Maples Pavilion last night with a combi
nation of basketball magic and court antics en route to a
£6-80 victory over the Washington Generals.
From the pregame show, with Curly Neal netting half
court shots and Geese Ausbie taking pictures with various
delighted spectators, until the conclusion of the game, the
crowd was treated to a display of passing, shooting and
comical creativity.
" The victory was No. 15,758 for the Globetrotters,
dating back to 1927 and adding to their .979 career win
ning percentage. The win did not come effortlessly,
however, as the Generals, undaunted by the Globetrot
ters' court wizardry, stayed within striking distance
throughout the game.
> Geese took control of the action from the outset,
showing why he has come to be known as the "Clown
Prince of Basketball." Whether interacting with the fans,
ridiculing the referees or simply making a shot from be
tween the opponent's legs. Geese was a dynamo, provid
ing running commentary the entire evening.
At one point, when a photographer was about to shoot
a oicture of the slightly obese referee who tours with the
Globetrotters, Geese, in typical manner, suggested the
use of a wide-angle lens.
When the Globetrotters were not busy with their comic
routines, they were showing off the polished basketball
skills that helped many of them become stars during their
college careers.
"Sweet" Lou Dunbar, a former All-American at Hous
ton and fellow court jester with Geese, combined with 7-
foot Robert Paige and 6-9 Billy Ray Hobley to put on a
rim-rattling dunking exhibition. Also, Curly, the long
time Globetrotter star, and Jimmy Blaylock showed their
adeptness with arcing long-range jumpshots.
The variety of passes exhibited by the Globetrotters
excited the crowd as well. The Trotters threw passes be
hind backs and through legs — using hips, knees, feet,
shoulders and thighs — and just about every other way
imaginable.
The Globetrotters performed many of their traditional
routines. Included were the pre-game "Magic Circle" per
formed to "Sweet Georgia Brown," the water pail filled
with confetti and Geese's boomerang free-throw with a
rubber band attached to the ball.
Absent, however, was Curly's famous dribbling routine.
Jit was replaced by a similar routine by "Gator" Rivers,
which was received with enthusiasm.
Last night's game ended a Bay Area tour by the
Globetrotters. Tonight they travel to Stockton for another
exhibition, seeking to add to their record number of
career victories and to add to the millions of smiles they
have inspired.
