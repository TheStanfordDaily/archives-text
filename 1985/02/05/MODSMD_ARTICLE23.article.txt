# Baseball at Hayward
## Cardinal takes to road again 
### TOM SENF Staff sportswriter 
After a couple of days to get
some sleep and a good meal —
well, maybe just some sleep — the
Stanford baseball team is on the
road again. Today, the Cardinal
travels across the Bay to take on
Hayward State.
Stanford is coming off a
weekend split of a two-game series
with defending NCAA champion
Fullerton State. The Cardinal of
fense, the team's major question
mark entering the season, scored
13 runs against the Titans.
Leftfielder Walt Harris had six hits
in eight at-bats for the weekend,
and first baseman Rick Lundblade
had a home run and four runs
batted in.
Although it had two rough in
nings on Thursday, allowing nine
runs in the fourth and fifth innings,
the Cardinal pitching staff has
been stingy in the first three
games. Rick Dietz has already
shown that he will be the main
man in the Cardinal bullpen,
recording saves in both Stanford
wins. Dietz has struck out four in
his three-and-one-third innings
and has yet to allow a hit.
Hayward opened its season this
weekend against Chico State by
losing two of three games. The
lone win was a convincing one — a
7-0 shutout thrown by senior Tom
Mills.
Coach Doug Weiss has 13 re
turning players, led by Mills and

second baseman Timmy Wallace.
Weiss is also expecting contribu
tions from transfers Monty
Reuling and Paul Mason.
Weiss is hoping that his lineup
will be able score enough runs to
compensate for a thin pitching
staff. Before Mills' shutout, the
Pioneers surrendered 17 runs in
two games.
What the staff lacks in quality, it
fails to make up for in quantity.
Hayward will have only four or
five pitchers available for today's
game. Brad Reiches (0-1) will
probably start, but Lawrence Pel
tier and Brain Pennebaker will
likely see action.
Playing a Division II school
after the defending national cham
pions could result in a letdown for
the Cardinal, but Coach Mark
Marquess doesn't think it will hap
pen. "It's early enough in the
season that I'm not too worried
about it,"he said. "Otherwise, it
could be a problem."
Taking the Pioneers lightly
could be a big mistake. "We have
a well-known program,"
Marquess said. "Everyone is out
to beat us, especially a Division II
team like Hayward. They're al
ways tough over there."
Lefthander Jeff Ballard will
open on the mound for Stanford.
The Cardinal will next face
Santa Clara in a three-game
weekend series. The games Friday
and Sunday will be at Sunken Dia
mond, while Saturday's contest
will be at Santa Clara.
