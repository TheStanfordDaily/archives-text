# Women netters face 'substantial' Pacific
## 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford women's tennis team
will play one of its "tougher early
matches" today at Stockton against
Pacific. According to Stanford Coach
Frank Brennan, Pacific is a
"substantial" team, but definitely not
a West Coast powerhouse.
The Tigers, 1-0, are in the Pacific
Coast Athletic Association for
the first time this year. UOP is not
ranked in the Intercollegiate Tennis
Coaches Association top 20 poll and
has no individually ranked players.
Stanford is ranked No. 1 and has four
players ranked in the top 10 singles
poll.
Stanford won its last match against
Fullerton State, 9-0, without the loss
of a set. Brennan said UOP should be
better than Fullerton, however, in
both singles and doubles.

Playing in the No. 1 singles match
for UOP will be junior Trina Lee. She
and Paige Jackson will be partners in
No. 1 doubles. Tiffany Lee, freshman
sister of Trina Lee, will probably play
No. 2 singles and play second doubles
with teammate Julie Fairchild.
Tiffany Lee played in the No. 1
singles spot against San Jose State
Saturday. The Tigers won the match
6-1. Both Lee sisters are close in
playing ability and may see equal
time in the No. 1 spot.
Stanford's next home match will be
against San Jose State Friday. The
Cardinal will be without three of its
top players — Linda Gates, Leigh
Anne Fldredge and Anna Ivan — for
that match. They will be playing in
the ITCA National Indoor Singles
Championship in Houston, which
runs Thursday through Sunday.
