# Sam Peckinpah: a retrospective tribute
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG Editorial staff 
The lengthy opening scene of "The
Wild Bunch" — perhaps the longest
credits sequence ever put on film —
follows the renegade heroes, Pike
Bishop (William Holden) and his
rough, rag-taggle crew, the tail end
of the free-riding cowboy spirit, into a
town and into its bank, which they
plan to rob. Every few moments, as a
new credit appears on the screen, the
action freezes, the magnificent worn
faces of the men hardening into
storybook drawings. The final credit,
to the director, Sam Peckinpah, ap
pears just after Pike has shouted a
terse command to one of his men,
who holds the innocent bank custom
ers at gunpoint: "If they move, kill
'em!"
When "The Wild Bunch" plays in
revival houses, that moment usually
provokes laughter, because it seems
such an appropriate signature for
Bloody Sam, the filmmaker whose
name became — after "The Wild
Bunch" (1969) and "Straw Dogs"
(1971) — synonymous for most
moviegoers with excessive, self
indulgent cinematic violence. When
Sam Peckinpah died last month at the
age of 59, 23 years after the release of
his first picture, "The Deadly Com
panions," and before shooting had
begun on his 15th, "On the Rocks,"
he had failed to outlive his bad boy
reputation and to convince most crit
ics and serious filmgoers that his work
merited close, intelligent attention.
Yet America has produced few direc
tors with his impassioned visual com
mand, few elegists for her frontier
past as plaintive and heartbreaking,
few moralists as provocative and
emotionally challenging. The fashion,
especially in the last decade, has been
to relegate Peckinpah to the rank of
professional hack, undistinguished
action director, but the gun battles in
his films equal Griffith's, his best wes
terns surpass John Ford's (and even
at their least inspired, they never suf
fer from the patina of stodginess —
respectability — that Ford acquired
in his Oscared years), and his two
most notorious movies are fierce, full
arguments for an ethic, a vision of life
in this country. While good liberal
audiences were reviling violence on
screen as if it were the cause of all of
this country's urban ills, Peckinpah,
along with most of the other major
American directors of the past two
decades (Arthur Penn, Robert
Altman, Francis Coppola, Martin
Scorsese, Brian De Palma), explored
the nature of violence; his films
threatened audiences because they
told us, with uncompromising and
graphic intensity, that the beast was
in us.
Peckinpah began as a script writer
and eventually director for various
television westerns in the 19505; his
debut film project, "The Deadly
Companions," came about as a con
sequence of his friendship with Brian
Keith, the film's star. It was his
second picture, however, "Ride the
High Country" (1962), that really
displayed his instinct for filmmaking,
and his instinctual understanding of
the western myth, which he continued
to evoke and probe on some level for
the rest c" his life, even in a contem
porary drama like "Straw Dogs" or a
war film like "Cross of Iron" or a
martial arts actioner like "The Killer
Elite." Working with the superb
cinematographer Lucien Ballard,

Peckinpah used the resources of
Cinemascope and Metrocolor to
describe the expansive beauty of the
late 19th-centur> West, and again in
"Major Dundee" (1965), shot by
Sam Leavitt in Eastmancolor and
Panavision, Peckinpah realized the
potential of the big screen as no one
had before him — and as practically
no one in today's video world
(perhaps only Fred Schepisi and Wal
ter Hill) still does.
The pleasures of watching "Major
Dundee" (which include Richard
Harris's stylish performance as Dun
dee's companion and adversary) are
not much dimmed by its heavy
handed script or the stolidity of its
star, Charlton Heston, but Colum
bia's idiocy in chopping sections of it
blurs the shape of the second half.
Peckinpah's resistance to this in
sensitive decision on the studio's part
— he had already dealt with the in
tractability of producers, when MGM
insisted on throwing "Ride the
High Country" onto the lower half of
double bills instead of giving it a
decent release — branded him
"difficult," and he didn't work again
in Hollywood for four years. When he
did, for Warners-Seven Arts, he gave
his bosses more than they bargained
for. "The Wild Bunch" accomplished
in the western genre what Arthur
Penn's "Bonnie and Clyde" had done
for gangster movies two years before:
It burrowed beneath the myth, re
vealing its underpinnings, examining
its implications. But the studio ob
jected to its length (nearly two-and
a-half hours) and its extensive
reliance on slow-motion violence,
and once again Peckinpah's film was
taken away from him and cut without
his approval.
Time and film history have silenced
Penn's detractors, who claimed in
1967 that "Bonnie and Clyde"
glorified thugs while reveling in gore,
but Peckinpah, who went farther than
Penn's death ballet finale into an
agonized, rapturous orgy of violence,
continues to be damned for it. But the
combination of slow motion and
excess in "The Wild Bunch' and the
Peckinpah films that followed it has a
point. Like Penn, riddling the corpses
of his hero and heroine with bullets,
Peckinpah wants us to understand
how final and irrevocable death is, to
demythify it. The avenging sheriff
and his men in "Bonnie and Clyde"
pumped enough lead into Bonnie and
Clyde to deflate the legend they had
become; the rain of gunfire that cuts
down the Wild Bunch suffices to kill
off the Old West. (When, at the end
of "Cross of Iron," James Coburn
and his few surviving comrades let
loose the fury of machine gun and
bayonet on the fellow German soldier
who betrayed them, they want to
eradicate the fact of him — wipe him
out of history.)
Slow motion both preserves the last
moment of a dying man's freedom
and accentuates its loss; it reminds us
of the evanescence of our existence
by prolonging the passage out of it.
Could anyone who watches Jaime
Sanchez' throat being slit by his
Mexican captors in "The Wild
Bunch" seriously doubt the value
Peckinpah places on human life? But
Peckinpah, as complex a sensualist as
Renoir or Ophuls, confuses our
responses: First he films the violence
with an abstract beauty and then he
jolts us out of our esthetic apprecia
tion for it by punctuating it with a

horrific thud as each body co'i
with the ground. "The Wild Bunc.,
is such an extraordinary visceral ex
perience that it forces us to look at
our own reactions to the violence in
it, particularly in the final gunfight, in
which men tumble by the dozens in a
fog of smoke. Alternately appalled
and amazed, numbed and freshly ap
palled, we can no longer look at the
western with the child's simplicity we
brought to a "Stagecoach" or a "Red
River."
Just as Peckinpah ricochets.
tween emotional poles in this se
quence, so he taps back into the west
ern myth even as he undercuts it. For
slow motion, like the photograph, is a
myth-forging device: When William
Holden and his cohorts ride slowly
across the plains, bouncing lightly on
their steeds in the hyperbright, hal
lucinatory sunlight, they acquire a
legendary beauty that is enhanced
when Peckinpah invokes the same
distorted tempo to capture their
death throes. Besides, in movies the
greatest images have the effect of
seeming to halt the passage of time.
The geranium cut by the dead sol
dier's bedside in "Grand Illusion,"
the proud old man, bent on suicide,
rushing toward the train tracks with
his little dog in his arms in "Umberto
D," deny the reality of death by
transforming it into an image that
lives on in our heads. In "The Wild
Bunch," men on horseback leaping

into the water off an exploded bridge
(a tribute to a moment in Sergei
Eisenstein's "October"), a train with
out an engineer at its helm rattling
heedlessly toward its destruction,
transcend the fate of the characters
on the screen. Peckinpah's relentless
investigation of old myths dismantles
them while his artistry creates new
ones from their ashes.
There is always a danger in at
tempting to spot a director's persona
in each of his pictures, but Peckin
pah's career is one of the few in
Hollywood that almost justifies an
auteurist approach. Not only do cer
tain Peckinpah flourishes show up in
film after film — the village celebra
tion scenes, the singing of his favorite
hymn, "We Will Gather at the River"
(especially at funerals), the joyless,
ominous games of children (who
torture scorpions in "The Wild
Bunch," circle a lone dog in "Straw
Dogs" and swing on the jailyard
noose in "Pat Garrett and Billy the
Kid") — but all of his movies rework
the same themes and embrace the
same ethic, even though he claimed
he was only discharging the jobs the
studios threw his way. The wild
bunch may be brutal killers, but their
rebellious stance against the crushing
new world of the company establish
ment ennobles them. Thornton
(Robert Ryan), in charge of hunting
them down, once rode with Pike; he
tells the puny, vulturous stooges hired
on to assist him, "We're after men —
and I wish to God I was with them."
Peckinpah saw himself, battling the
corrupt, tyrannical Hollywood sys
tem, in Pike Bishop, in Billy the Kid
(Kris Kristofferson), in Mike (James
Caan), the double-crossed CIA agent
of "The Killer Elite," in the exemp
lary soldier Steiner (James Coburn),
the hero of "Cross of Iron," who tells
a sympathetic major, "I hate all offi
cers," and in the independent (i.e.,
non-union) trucker (played again by
Kristofferson, with his steely blue
eyes and his steely cool) who leads
the "Convoy."
"Aren't your loners and misfits
conformists to outdated codes?"
William Murray asked Peckinpah in a
Playboy interview in 1972. The direc
tor replied, "Outdated codes like
courage, loyalty, friendship, grace un
der pressure, all the simple virtues
that have become cliches, sure" —
echoing Pike, who says, "You side
with a man and then you stick with
him. If you can't do that, you're like
an animal," or Mike, who enlists the
aid of two former agents considered
by his employers to be, respectively, a
has-been and a psychotic, because
they are his friends and he knows he
can trust them. When Peckinpah
turned again and again to the actors
he felt he could communicate with —
to Coburn and Kristofferson, Warren
Oates, L.Q. Jones, R.G. Armstrong,
Gig Young, Steve McQueen, Ernest
Borgnine, Burt Young, Ben Johnson,
David Warner, Strother Martin, Slim
Pickens — he was validating the stand
his heroes always took.
These virtues, of course, are at
least a partial definition of machismo ;
in "Straw Dogs," his most disturbing
film, he completed it. "Straw Dogs''
begins by belittling its intellectual
(mathematician) protagonist, David
Sumner (Dustin Hoffman, in an ex
pert performance), for his cowardice
— unwilling to confront the increas
ingly perilous life in America in the
early '70s, he has fled with his bride
to her home village in the English

countryside — and ends by enshrin
ing his single-handed slaughter of a
gang of thugs who have raped his wife
and invaded his home. David's wife
Amy (Susan George) has taunted him
for his unmanliness while encourag
ing her rapists; the first shot of her
focuses on her free-swinging breasts,
and every line she speaks sounds like
an invitation to sex or a covert threat,
or both. And this baby doll version of
the young Julie Christie has a juvenile
double — a pouty teenager who, dis
couraged by David's refusal to
respond to her sexual availability,
turns on a local just released from a
mental hospital, in a subplot that
reprises "Of Mice and Men" both in
narrative line (the man unwittingly
kills her) and in theme (women are
nothing but trouble).
As Pauline Kael, ever Peckinpah's
most eloquent champion, correctly
pointed out on the film's release,
"Straw Dogs" was a key film for its
time. Unlike the other, more readily
sanctioned, displays of violence that
came out that same fall and
Christmas (1971) — "The French
Connection," "Dirty Harry," "The
Cowboys," "A Clockwork Orange"
— Peckinpah's movie had at least the
courage of its convictions, as well as a
mastery of craft so stunning that an
admiring viewer was automatically
guilty of complicity in its point of
view. Sitting through it, feeling myself
drawn toward its inevitable explosive
finale, I remember experiencing the
same mixture of awe and revulsion I
had had when I saw Leni
Riefenstahl's Nazi celebration
"Triumph of the Will." You couldn't
deny that Peckinpah had addressed
the issue of the accelerating violence
in our society, and you couldn't
pretend he hadn't seduced you into
sharing David's triumph — insofar as
you registered a deep sense of relief
when the film, wound up unbearably
tight in its first 90 minutes, erupted
into violence in its last half hour. At a
distance of more than 10 years,
though, "Straw Dogs" (while no less
astonishing and no less problematic)
has lost some of its raw power. On a
recent reviewing, I was startled to
find that it seemed tied to its epoch in
a way that the far more ambiguous
"The Wild Bunch" did not.
Peckinpah was fond of referring to
himself as an old whore turning a deft
trick for his studio bosses, but only on
very few occasions — in "The
Getaway" or the necrophilic "Bring
Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia" —
did he fail to bring something vital
and distinctive to even the most drab
assignments. "The Killer Elite" has a
riveting opening scene, behind the
credits, in which anonymous hands
plant a bomb in a building — a model
of narrative shorthand — and a
climactic, almost surrealistic battle
sequence involving dozens of silver
robed Ninja. The tiresome, talky
"Cross of Iron," shot by John Coquil
lon, has an amazing color scheme: ex
otic, overrich greens suffocating in
blue smoke. It also has extraordinary
combat sequences and several
memorable images — an upended
jeep, wheels still spinning; live sol
diers buried in trenches, their flesh
rippling like waves as the artillery
rings out above their heads; blood
seeping from a headless uniform half
sunk in the water; a tank, its operator
unseen, plowing through the rubble
piled on top of it like an unkillable
monster in some apocalyptic science
fiction picture.

The most pleasant surprise among
the late Peckinpahs is "Convoy''
(which has probably the Worst
reputation of any of his movies).
Unlike the other routine jobs he
managed to vivify in some way,
"Convoy," which begins with a shot
of a highway cascading like a water
fall toward the camera, is a relaxed
demonstration of craft. It even con
tains elements of self-parody,' like a
brawl at a truck stop in which ketchup
flows instead of blood, and a direct
allusion to the explosion on the
bridge in "The Wild Bunch" with a
comic kicker — the occupant Of the
shattered vehicle emerges with only a
few injuries. In this cheerfully anar
chic comedy, almost no one ever gets
hurt. A cop car soars through the air,
piercing a billboard sign, and lands in
a ditch, a truck rolls over on its side,
but the cop and the trucker bounce
back like adversaries in a cartoon. In
fact, "Convoy" is as close as a live ac
tion film has ever come to ap
proximating the sensibility of a car
toon: Dirty Lyle, the bad guy sheriff
(Ernest Borgnine), plays Wile E.
Coyote to a fleet of bigger, faster and
cleverer Roadrunner trucks. At one
point, a police car races across the
screen, apparently in hot chase after
its prey; the camera pulls back.and we
see, in a visual punch line worthy of
Chuck Jones, that it's the patrdl vehi
cle that is being chased — by & truck
twice its size, taking its own sweet
time.
Even the oddest of Peckinpah's
movies — the Vietnamized \yestern
"Pat Garrett and Billy the'Kid''
(1973), with its misplaced hippie hero
and its late '60s-early '70s counter
culture cast (Kris Kristoffersou, Bob
Dylan, Rita Coolidge) — has a hyp
notic quality; it lingers in the, mind
years after you've seen it. Its*heavy,
dreamy texture, partly the result of
the modern folk score by Dylan, sug
gests that Peckinpah may have been
trying for something like the atmo
sphere Robert Altman had achieved
in "McCabe and Mrs. Miller" (which
employed songs by Leonard Cohen)
two years earlier, but
wasn't bleak and fatalistic, and "Pat
Garrett" is. In any case, even this
weird, failed effort at finding a com
mon mood to bridge the distance be
tween two experiences (the last gasps
of the freedom of the frontier, the
dying strains of protest against the
Vietnamization of America), though
both are falsified in the process, is
strangely affecting. And there are
magnificent images: Billy riding his
horse slowly along a stream jn the
growing dusk, a barge floating down
the water in the leisurely declining
sunlight of a late afternoon. in the
most remarkable scene, an old man
(Slim Pickens), once an outlaw and
now deputized by his friend Pat Gar
rett (James Coburn), receives'a gun
shot in the belly and crawls ~10 the
water to die. As the strains of Dylan's
"Knockin' on Heaven's DooJ" rise
on the soundtrack, Pickens' wife
(Katy Jurado) sees what has hap
pened and follows him; unable to ap
proach him and violate the privacy of
his last moments, she remains a few
hundred feet above him on the shore,
her eyes filling with tears as the sun
glows red in the stream. Thi* scene
must last no more than two minutes,
but for years (until I saw the-film a
second time) I remembered it as
much longer. The image hid ex
panded in my mind and broken the
bounds of time.

Getaway.*


Sam Peckinpah combined the brash American frontier spirit with depth and sensitivity
The lengthy opening scene of "The
Wild Bunch" — perhaps the longest
credits sequence ever put on film —
follows the renegade heroes, Pike
Bishop (William Holden) and his
rough, rag-taggle crew, the tail end
of the free-riding cowboy spirit, into a
town and into its bank, which they
plan to rob. Every few moments, as a
new credit appears on the screen, the
action freezes, the magnificent worn
faces of the men hardening into
storybook drawings. The final credit,
to the director, Sam Peckinpah, ap
pears just after Pike has shouted a
terse command to one of his men,
who holds the innocent bank custom
ers at gunpoint: "If they move, kill
'em!"
When "The Wild Bunch" plays in
revival houses, that moment usually
provokes laughter, because it seems
such an appropriate signature for
Bloody Sam, the filmmaker whose
name became — after "The Wild
Bunch" (1969) and "Straw Dogs"
(1971) — synonymous for most
moviegoers with excessive, self
indulgent cinematic violence. When
Sam Peckinpah died last month at the
age of 59, 23 years after the release of
his first picture, "The Deadly Com
panions," and before shooting had
begun on his 15th, "On the Rocks,"
he had failed to outlive his bad boy
reputation and to convince most crit
ics and serious filmgoers that his work
merited close, intelligent attention.
Yet America has produced few direc
tors with his impassioned visual com

past as plaintive and heartbreaking,
few moralists as provocative and
emotionally challenging. The fashion,
especially in the last decade, has been
to relegate Peckinpah to the rank of
professional hack, undistinguished

most notorious movies are fierce, full
arguments for an ethic, a vision of life
in this country. While good liberal
audiences were reviling violence on
screen as if it were the cause of all of
this country's urban ills, Peckinpah,
along with most of the other major
American directors of the past two
decades (Arthur Penn, Robert
Altman, Francis Coppola, Martin
Scorsese, Brian De Palma), explored
the nature of violence; his films
threatened audiences because they
told us, with uncompromising and
graphic intensity, that the beast was

Peckinpah began as a script writer
and eventually director for various
television westerns in the 19505; his
debut film project, "The Deadly

sequence of his friendship with Brian
Keith, the film's star. It was his

displayed his instinct for filmmaking,
and his instinctual understanding of
the western myth, which he continued
to evoke and probe on some level for
the rest c" his life, even in a contem
porary drama like "Straw Dogs" or a
war film like "Cross of Iron" or a
martial arts actioner like "The Killer

cinematographer Lucien Ballard,

Peckinpah used the resources of
Cinemascope and Metrocolor to
describe the expansive beauty of the
late 19th-centur> West, and again in
"Major Dundee" (1965), shot by
Sam Leavitt in Eastmancolor and
Panavision, Peckinpah realized the
potential of the big screen as no one
had before him — and as practically
no one in today's video world
(perhaps only Fred Schepisi and Wal

The pleasures of watching "Major

Harris's stylish performance as Dun
dee's companion and adversary) are
not much dimmed by its heavy
handed script or the stolidity of its
star, Charlton Heston, but Colum
bia's idiocy in chopping sections of it
blurs the shape of the second half.
Peckinpah's resistance to this in
sensitive decision on the studio's part
— he had already dealt with the in
tractability of producers, when MGM
insisted on throwing "Ride the
High Country" onto the lower half of
double bills instead of giving it a
decent release — branded him
"difficult," and he didn't work again
in Hollywood for four years. When he
did, for Warners-Seven Arts, he gave
his bosses more than they bargained
for. "The Wild Bunch" accomplished
in the western genre what Arthur
Penn's "Bonnie and Clyde" had done
for gangster movies two years before:
It burrowed beneath the myth, re
vealing its underpinnings, examining
its implications. But the studio ob
jected to its length (nearly two-and
a-half hours) and its extensive
reliance on slow-motion violence,
and once again Peckinpah's film was
taken away from him and cut without
his approval.
Time and film history have silenced
Penn's detractors, who claimed in
1967 that "Bonnie and Clyde"
glorified thugs while reveling in gore,
but Peckinpah, who went farther than
Penn's death ballet finale into an
agonized, rapturous orgy of violence,
continues to be damned for it. But the
combination of slow motion and
excess in "The Wild Bunch' and the
Peckinpah films that followed it has a
point. Like Penn, riddling the corpses
of his hero and heroine with bullets,
Peckinpah wants us to understand
how final and irrevocable death is, to
demythify it. The avenging sheriff
and his men in "Bonnie and Clyde"
pumped enough lead into Bonnie and
Clyde to deflate the legend they had
become; the rain of gunfire that cuts
down the Wild Bunch suffices to kill
off the Old West. (When, at the end
of "Cross of Iron," James Coburn
and his few surviving comrades let
loose the fury of machine gun and
bayonet on the fellow German soldier
who betrayed them, they want to
eradicate the fact of him — wipe him
out of history.)
Slow motion both preserves the last
moment of a dying man's freedom
and accentuates its loss; it reminds us
of the evanescence of our existence
by prolonging the passage out of it.
Could anyone who watches Jaime

a sympathetic major, "I hate all offi

double — a pouty teenager who, dis
couraged by David's refusal to
respond to her sexual availability,
turns on a local just released from a
mental hospital, in a subplot that
reprises "Of Mice and Men" both in
narrative line (the man unwittingly
kills her) and in theme (women are
nothing but trouble).
As Pauline Kael, ever Peckinpah's
most eloquent champion, correctly
pointed out on the film's release,
"Straw Dogs" was a key film for its
time. Unlike the other, more readily
sanctioned, displays of violence that
came out that same fall and
Christmas (1971) — "The French
Connection," "Dirty Harry," "The
Cowboys," "A Clockwork Orange"
— Peckinpah's movie had at least the
courage of its convictions, as well as a
mastery of craft so stunning that an
admiring viewer was automatically
guilty of complicity in its point of
view. Sitting through it, feeling myself
drawn toward its inevitable explosive
finale, I remember experiencing the
same mixture of awe and revulsion I
had had when I saw Leni
Riefenstahl's Nazi celebration
"Triumph of the Will." You couldn't
deny that Peckinpah had addressed
the issue of the accelerating violence
in our society, and you couldn't
pretend he hadn't seduced you into
sharing David's triumph — insofar as
you registered a deep sense of relief
when the film, wound up unbearably
tight in its first 90 minutes, erupted
into violence in its last half hour. At a
distance of more than 10 years,
though, "Straw Dogs" (while no less
astonishing and no less problematic)
has lost some of its raw power. On a
recent reviewing, I was startled to
find that it seemed tied to its epoch in
a way that the far more ambiguous
"The Wild Bunch" did not.
Peckinpah was fond of referring to
himself as an old whore turning a deft
trick for his studio bosses, but only on
very few occasions — in "The
Getaway" or the necrophilic "Bring
Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia" —
did he fail to bring something vital
and distinctive to even the most drab
assignments. "The Killer Elite" has a
riveting opening scene, behind the
credits, in which anonymous hands
plant a bomb in a building — a model
of narrative shorthand — and a
climactic, almost surrealistic battle
sequence involving dozens of silver
robed Ninja. The tiresome, talky
"Cross of Iron," shot by John Coquil
lon, has an amazing color scheme: ex
otic, overrich greens suffocating in
blue smoke. It also has extraordinary
combat sequences and several
memorable images — an upended
jeep, wheels still spinning; live sol
diers buried in trenches, their flesh
rippling like waves as the artillery
rings out above their heads; blood
seeping from a headless uniform half
sunk in the water; a tank, its operator
unseen, plowing through the rubble
piled on top of it like an unkillable
monster in some apocalyptic science
fiction picture.

The most pleasant surprise among
the late Peckinpahs is "Convoy''
(which has probably the Worst
reputation of any of his movies).
Unlike the other routine jobs he
managed to vivify in some way,
"Convoy," which begins with a shot
of a highway cascading like a water
fall toward the camera, is a relaxed
demonstration of craft. It even con
tains elements of self-parody,' like a
brawl at a truck stop in which ketchup
flows instead of blood, and a direct
allusion to the explosion on the
bridge in "The Wild Bunch" with a
comic kicker — the occupant Of the
shattered vehicle emerges with only a
few injuries. In this cheerfully anar
chic comedy, almost no one ever gets
hurt. A cop car soars through the air,
piercing a billboard sign, and lands in
a ditch, a truck rolls over on its side,
but the cop and the trucker bounce
back like adversaries in a cartoon. In
fact, "Convoy" is as close as a live ac
tion film has ever come to ap
proximating the sensibility of a car
toon: Dirty Lyle, the bad guy sheriff
(Ernest Borgnine), plays Wile E.
Coyote to a fleet of bigger, faster and
cleverer Roadrunner trucks. At one
point, a police car races across the
screen, apparently in hot chase after
its prey; the camera pulls back.and we
see, in a visual punch line worthy of
Chuck Jones, that it's the patrdl vehi
cle that is being chased — by & truck
twice its size, taking its own sweet
time.
Even the oddest of Peckinpah's
movies — the Vietnamized \yestern
"Pat Garrett and Billy the'Kid''
(1973), with its misplaced hippie hero
and its late '60s-early '70s counter
culture cast (Kris Kristoffersou, Bob
Dylan, Rita Coolidge) — has a hyp
notic quality; it lingers in the, mind
years after you've seen it. Its*heavy,
dreamy texture, partly the result of
the modern folk score by Dylan, sug
gests that Peckinpah may have been
trying for something like the atmo
sphere Robert Altman had achieved
in "McCabe and Mrs. Miller" (which
employed songs by Leonard Cohen)
two years earlier, but
wasn't bleak and fatalistic, and "Pat
Garrett" is. In any case, even this
weird, failed effort at finding a com
mon mood to bridge the distance be
tween two experiences (the last gasps
of the freedom of the frontier, the
dying strains of protest against the
Vietnamization of America), though
both are falsified in the process, is
strangely affecting. And there are
magnificent images: Billy riding his
horse slowly along a stream jn the
growing dusk, a barge floating down
the water in the leisurely declining
sunlight of a late afternoon. in the
most remarkable scene, an old man
(Slim Pickens), once an outlaw and
now deputized by his friend Pat Gar
rett (James Coburn), receives'a gun
shot in the belly and crawls ~10 the
water to die. As the strains of Dylan's
"Knockin' on Heaven's DooJ" rise
on the soundtrack, Pickens' wife
(Katy Jurado) sees what has hap
pened and follows him; unable to ap
proach him and violate the privacy of
his last moments, she remains a few
hundred feet above him on the shore,
her eyes filling with tears as the sun
glows red in the stream. Thi* scene
must last no more than two minutes,
but for years (until I saw the-film a
second time) I remembered it as
much longer. The image hid ex
panded in my mind and broken the
bounds of time.

Getaway.*


Sam Peckinpah combined the brash American frontier spirit with depth and sensitivity
The lengthy opening scene of "The
Wild Bunch" — perhaps the longest
credits sequence ever put on film —
follows the renegade heroes, Pike
Bishop (William Holden) and his
rough, rag-taggle crew, the tail end
of the free-riding cowboy spirit, into a
town and into its bank, which they
plan to rob. Every few moments, as a
new credit appears on the screen, the
action freezes, the magnificent worn
faces of the men hardening into
storybook drawings. The final credit,
to the director, Sam Peckinpah, ap
pears just after Pike has shouted a
terse command to one of his men,
who holds the innocent bank custom
ers at gunpoint: "If they move, kill
'em!"
When "The Wild Bunch" plays in
revival houses, that moment usually
provokes laughter, because it seems
such an appropriate signature for
Bloody Sam, the filmmaker whose
name became — after "The Wild
Bunch" (1969) and "Straw Dogs"
(1971) — synonymous for most
moviegoers with excessive, self
indulgent cinematic violence. When
Sam Peckinpah died last month at the
age of 59, 23 years after the release of
his first picture, "The Deadly Com
panions," and before shooting had
begun on his 15th, "On the Rocks,"
he had failed to outlive his bad boy
reputation and to convince most crit
ics and serious filmgoers that his work
merited close, intelligent attention.
Yet America has produced few direc
tors with his impassioned visual com
mand, few elegists for her frontier
past as plaintive and heartbreaking,
few moralists as provocative and
emotionally challenging. The fashion,
especially in the last decade, has been
to relegate Peckinpah to the rank of
professional hack, undistinguished
action director, but the gun battles in
his films equal Griffith's, his best wes
terns surpass John Ford's (and even
at their least inspired, they never suf
fer from the patina of stodginess —
respectability — that Ford acquired
in his Oscared years), and his two
most notorious movies are fierce, full
arguments for an ethic, a vision of life
in this country. While good liberal
audiences were reviling violence on
screen as if it were the cause of all of
this country's urban ills, Peckinpah,
along with most of the other major
American directors of the past two
decades (Arthur Penn, Robert
Altman, Francis Coppola, Martin
Scorsese, Brian De Palma), explored
the nature of violence; his films
threatened audiences because they
told us, with uncompromising and
graphic intensity, that the beast was
in us.
Peckinpah began as a script writer
and eventually director for various
television westerns in the 19505; his
debut film project, "The Deadly
Companions," came about as a con
sequence of his friendship with Brian
Keith, the film's star. It was his
second picture, however, "Ride the
High Country" (1962), that really
displayed his instinct for filmmaking,
and his instinctual understanding of
the western myth, which he continued
to evoke and probe on some level for
the rest c" his life, even in a contem
porary drama like "Straw Dogs" or a
war film like "Cross of Iron" or a
martial arts actioner like "The Killer
Elite." Working with the superb
cinematographer Lucien Ballard,

Peckinpah used the resources of
Cinemascope and Metrocolor to
describe the expansive beauty of the
late 19th-centur> West, and again in
"Major Dundee" (1965), shot by
Sam Leavitt in Eastmancolor and
Panavision, Peckinpah realized the
potential of the big screen as no one
had before him — and as practically
no one in today's video world
(perhaps only Fred Schepisi and Wal
ter Hill) still does.
The pleasures of watching "Major
Dundee" (which include Richard
Harris's stylish performance as Dun
dee's companion and adversary) are
not much dimmed by its heavy
handed script or the stolidity of its
star, Charlton Heston, but Colum
bia's idiocy in chopping sections of it
blurs the shape of the second half.
Peckinpah's resistance to this in
sensitive decision on the studio's part
— he had already dealt with the in
tractability of producers, when MGM
insisted on throwing "Ride the
High Country" onto the lower half of
double bills instead of giving it a
decent release — branded him
"difficult," and he didn't work again
in Hollywood for four years. When he
did, for Warners-Seven Arts, he gave
his bosses more than they bargained
for. "The Wild Bunch" accomplished
in the western genre what Arthur
Penn's "Bonnie and Clyde" had done
for gangster movies two years before:
It burrowed beneath the myth, re
vealing its underpinnings, examining
its implications. But the studio ob
jected to its length (nearly two-and
a-half hours) and its extensive
reliance on slow-motion violence,
and once again Peckinpah's film was
taken away from him and cut without
his approval.
Time and film history have silenced
Penn's detractors, who claimed in
1967 that "Bonnie and Clyde"
glorified thugs while reveling in gore,
but Peckinpah, who went farther than
Penn's death ballet finale into an
agonized, rapturous orgy of violence,
continues to be damned for it. But the
combination of slow motion and
excess in "The Wild Bunch' and the
Peckinpah films that followed it has a
point. Like Penn, riddling the corpses
of his hero and heroine with bullets,
Peckinpah wants us to understand
how final and irrevocable death is, to
demythify it. The avenging sheriff
and his men in "Bonnie and Clyde"
pumped enough lead into Bonnie and
Clyde to deflate the legend they had
become; the rain of gunfire that cuts
down the Wild Bunch suffices to kill
off the Old West. (When, at the end
of "Cross of Iron," James Coburn
and his few surviving comrades let
loose the fury of machine gun and
bayonet on the fellow German soldier
who betrayed them, they want to
eradicate the fact of him — wipe him
out of history.)
Slow motion both preserves the last
moment of a dying man's freedom
and accentuates its loss; it reminds us
of the evanescence of our existence
by prolonging the passage out of it.
Could anyone who watches Jaime
Sanchez' throat being slit by his
Mexican captors in "The Wild
Bunch" seriously doubt the value
Peckinpah places on human life? But
Peckinpah, as complex a sensualist as
Renoir or Ophuls, confuses our
responses: First he films the violence
with an abstract beauty and then he
jolts us out of our esthetic apprecia
tion for it by punctuating it with a

horrific thud as each body co'i
with the ground. "The Wild Bunc.,
is such an extraordinary visceral ex
perience that it forces us to look at
our own reactions to the violence in
it, particularly in the final gunfight, in
which men tumble by the dozens in a
fog of smoke. Alternately appalled
and amazed, numbed and freshly ap
palled, we can no longer look at the
western with the child's simplicity we
brought to a "Stagecoach" or a "Red
River."
Just as Peckinpah ricochets.
tween emotional poles in this se
quence, so he taps back into the west
ern myth even as he undercuts it. For
slow motion, like the photograph, is a
myth-forging device: When William
Holden and his cohorts ride slowly
across the plains, bouncing lightly on
their steeds in the hyperbright, hal
lucinatory sunlight, they acquire a
legendary beauty that is enhanced
when Peckinpah invokes the same
distorted tempo to capture their
death throes. Besides, in movies the
greatest images have the effect of
seeming to halt the passage of time.
The geranium cut by the dead sol
dier's bedside in "Grand Illusion,"
the proud old man, bent on suicide,
rushing toward the train tracks with
his little dog in his arms in "Umberto
D," deny the reality of death by
transforming it into an image that
lives on in our heads. In "The Wild
Bunch," men on horseback leaping

into the water off an exploded bridge
(a tribute to a moment in Sergei
Eisenstein's "October"), a train with
out an engineer at its helm rattling
heedlessly toward its destruction,
transcend the fate of the characters
on the screen. Peckinpah's relentless
investigation of old myths dismantles
them while his artistry creates new
ones from their ashes.
There is always a danger in at
tempting to spot a director's persona
in each of his pictures, but Peckin
pah's career is one of the few in
Hollywood that almost justifies an
auteurist approach. Not only do cer
tain Peckinpah flourishes show up in
film after film — the village celebra
tion scenes, the singing of his favorite
hymn, "We Will Gather at the River"
(especially at funerals), the joyless,
ominous games of children (who
torture scorpions in "The Wild
Bunch," circle a lone dog in "Straw
Dogs" and swing on the jailyard
noose in "Pat Garrett and Billy the
Kid") — but all of his movies rework
the same themes and embrace the
same ethic, even though he claimed
he was only discharging the jobs the
studios threw his way. The wild
bunch may be brutal killers, but their
rebellious stance against the crushing
new world of the company establish
ment ennobles them. Thornton
(Robert Ryan), in charge of hunting
them down, once rode with Pike; he
tells the puny, vulturous stooges hired
on to assist him, "We're after men —
and I wish to God I was with them."
Peckinpah saw himself, battling the
corrupt, tyrannical Hollywood sys
tem, in Pike Bishop, in Billy the Kid
(Kris Kristofferson), in Mike (James
Caan), the double-crossed CIA agent
of "The Killer Elite," in the exemp
lary soldier Steiner (James Coburn),
the hero of "Cross of Iron," who tells
a sympathetic major, "I hate all offi
cers," and in the independent (i.e.,
non-union) trucker (played again by
Kristofferson, with his steely blue
eyes and his steely cool) who leads
the "Convoy."
"Aren't your loners and misfits
conformists to outdated codes?"
William Murray asked Peckinpah in a
Playboy interview in 1972. The direc
tor replied, "Outdated codes like
courage, loyalty, friendship, grace un
der pressure, all the simple virtues
that have become cliches, sure" —
echoing Pike, who says, "You side
with a man and then you stick with
him. If you can't do that, you're like
an animal," or Mike, who enlists the
aid of two former agents considered
by his employers to be, respectively, a
has-been and a psychotic, because
they are his friends and he knows he
can trust them. When Peckinpah
turned again and again to the actors
he felt he could communicate with —
to Coburn and Kristofferson, Warren
Oates, L.Q. Jones, R.G. Armstrong,
Gig Young, Steve McQueen, Ernest
Borgnine, Burt Young, Ben Johnson,
David Warner, Strother Martin, Slim
Pickens — he was validating the stand
his heroes always took.
These virtues, of course, are at
least a partial definition of machismo ;
in "Straw Dogs," his most disturbing
film, he completed it. "Straw Dogs''
begins by belittling its intellectual
(mathematician) protagonist, David
Sumner (Dustin Hoffman, in an ex
pert performance), for his cowardice
— unwilling to confront the increas
ingly perilous life in America in the
early '70s, he has fled with his bride
to her home village in the English

countryside — and ends by enshrin
ing his single-handed slaughter of a
gang of thugs who have raped his wife
and invaded his home. David's wife
Amy (Susan George) has taunted him
for his unmanliness while encourag
ing her rapists; the first shot of her
focuses on her free-swinging breasts,
and every line she speaks sounds like
an invitation to sex or a covert threat,
or both. And this baby doll version of
the young Julie Christie has a juvenile
double — a pouty teenager who, dis
couraged by David's refusal to
respond to her sexual availability,
turns on a local just released from a
mental hospital, in a subplot that
reprises "Of Mice and Men" both in
narrative line (the man unwittingly
kills her) and in theme (women are
nothing but trouble).
As Pauline Kael, ever Peckinpah's
most eloquent champion, correctly
pointed out on the film's release,
"Straw Dogs" was a key film for its
time. Unlike the other, more readily
sanctioned, displays of violence that
came out that same fall and
Christmas (1971) — "The French
Connection," "Dirty Harry," "The
Cowboys," "A Clockwork Orange"
— Peckinpah's movie had at least the
courage of its convictions, as well as a
mastery of craft so stunning that an
admiring viewer was automatically

Sam Peckinpah combined the brash American frontier spirit with depth and sensitivity
The lengthy opening scene of "The
Wild Bunch" — perhaps the longest
credits sequence ever put on film —
follows the renegade heroes, Pike
Bishop (William Holden) and his
rough, rag-taggle crew, the tail end
of the free-riding cowboy spirit, into a
town and into its bank, which they
plan to rob. Every few moments, as a
new credit appears on the screen, the
action freezes, the magnificent worn

storybook drawings. The final credit,
to the director, Sam Peckinpah, ap
pears just after Pike has shouted a

who holds the innocent bank custom

'em!"
When "The Wild Bunch" plays in

he had failed to outlive his bad boy

audiences were reviling violence on
screen as if it were the cause of all of

along with most of the other major
American directors of the past two
decades (Arthur Penn, Robert
Altman, Francis Coppola, Martin
Scorsese, Brian De Palma), explored
the nature of violence; his films
threatened audiences because they
told us, with uncompromising and
graphic intensity, that the beast was

Peckinpah began as a script writer
and eventually director for various

cinematographer Lucien Ballard,

Peckinpah used the resources of
Cinemascope and Metrocolor to
describe the expansive beauty of the
late 19th-centur> West, and again in
"Major Dundee" (1965), shot by
Sam Leavitt in Eastmancolor and
Panavision, Peckinpah realized the
potential of the big screen as no one
had before him — and as practically
no one in today's video world
(perhaps only Fred Schepisi and Wal

The pleasures of watching "Major

sensitive decision on the studio's part
— he had already dealt with the in

his bosses more than they bargained

in the western genre what Arthur
Penn's "Bonnie and Clyde" had done

Time and film history have silenced

1967 that "Bonnie and Clyde"
glorified thugs while reveling in gore,
but Peckinpah, who went farther than
Penn's death ballet finale into an
agonized, rapturous orgy of violence,
continues to be damned for it. But the
combination of slow motion and
excess in "The Wild Bunch' and the
Peckinpah films that followed it has a
point. Like Penn, riddling the corpses
of his hero and heroine with bullets,
Peckinpah wants us to understand
how final and irrevocable death is, to
demythify it. The avenging sheriff
and his men in "Bonnie and Clyde"
pumped enough lead into Bonnie and
Clyde to deflate the legend they had
become; the rain of gunfire that cuts
down the Wild Bunch suffices to kill
off the Old West. (When, at the end
of "Cross of Iron," James Coburn
and his few surviving comrades let
loose the fury of machine gun and
bayonet on the fellow German soldier
who betrayed them, they want to
eradicate the fact of him — wipe him
out of history.)
Slow motion both preserves the last
moment of a dying man's freedom
and accentuates its loss; it reminds us
of the evanescence of our existence
by prolonging the passage out of it.
Could anyone who watches Jaime
Sanchez' throat being slit by his
Mexican captors in "The Wild
Bunch" seriously doubt the value
Peckinpah places on human life? But
Peckinpah, as complex a sensualist as
Renoir or Ophuls, confuses our
responses: First he films the violence
with an abstract beauty and then he
jolts us out of our esthetic apprecia
tion for it by punctuating it with a

horrific thud as each body co'i
with the ground. "The Wild Bunc.,
is such an extraordinary visceral ex
perience that it forces us to look at
our own reactions to the violence in
it, particularly in the final gunfight, in
which men tumble by the dozens in a
fog of smoke. Alternately appalled
and amazed, numbed and freshly ap
palled, we can no longer look at the
western with the child's simplicity we
brought to a "Stagecoach" or a "Red
River."
Just as Peckinpah ricochets.
tween emotional poles in this se
quence, so he taps back into the west
ern myth even as he undercuts it. For
slow motion, like the photograph, is a
myth-forging device: When William
Holden and his cohorts ride slowly
across the plains, bouncing lightly on
their steeds in the hyperbright, hal
lucinatory sunlight, they acquire a
legendary beauty that is enhanced
when Peckinpah invokes the same
distorted tempo to capture their
death throes. Besides, in movies the
greatest images have the effect of
seeming to halt the passage of time.
The geranium cut by the dead sol
dier's bedside in "Grand Illusion,"
the proud old man, bent on suicide,
rushing toward the train tracks with
his little dog in his arms in "Umberto
D," deny the reality of death by
transforming it into an image that
lives on in our heads. In "The Wild
Bunch," men on horseback leaping

into the water off an exploded bridge
(a tribute to a moment in Sergei
Eisenstein's "October"), a train with
out an engineer at its helm rattling
heedlessly toward its destruction,
transcend the fate of the characters
on the screen. Peckinpah's relentless
investigation of old myths dismantles
them while his artistry creates new
ones from their ashes.
There is always a danger in at
tempting to spot a director's persona
in each of his pictures, but Peckin
pah's career is one of the few in
Hollywood that almost justifies an
auteurist approach. Not only do cer
tain Peckinpah flourishes show up in
film after film — the village celebra
tion scenes, the singing of his favorite
hymn, "We Will Gather at the River"
(especially at funerals), the joyless,
ominous games of children (who
torture scorpions in "The Wild
Bunch," circle a lone dog in "Straw
Dogs" and swing on the jailyard
noose in "Pat Garrett and Billy the
Kid") — but all of his movies rework
the same themes and embrace the
same ethic, even though he claimed
he was only discharging the jobs the
studios threw his way. The wild
bunch may be brutal killers, but their
rebellious stance against the crushing
new world of the company establish
ment ennobles them. Thornton
(Robert Ryan), in charge of hunting
them down, once rode with Pike; he
tells the puny, vulturous stooges hired
on to assist him, "We're after men —
and I wish to God I was with them."
Peckinpah saw himself, battling the
corrupt, tyrannical Hollywood sys
tem, in Pike Bishop, in Billy the Kid
(Kris Kristofferson), in Mike (James
Caan), the double-crossed CIA agent
of "The Killer Elite," in the exemp
lary soldier Steiner (James Coburn),
the hero of "Cross of Iron," who tells
a sympathetic major, "I hate all offi
cers," and in the independent (i.e.,
non-union) trucker (played again by
Kristofferson, with his steely blue
eyes and his steely cool) who leads
the "Convoy."
"Aren't your loners and misfits
conformists to outdated codes?"
William Murray asked Peckinpah in a
Playboy interview in 1972. The direc
tor replied, "Outdated codes like
courage, loyalty, friendship, grace un
der pressure, all the simple virtues
that have become cliches, sure" —
echoing Pike, who says, "You side
with a man and then you stick with
him. If you can't do that, you're like
an animal," or Mike, who enlists the
aid of two former agents considered
by his employers to be, respectively, a
has-been and a psychotic, because
they are his friends and he knows he
can trust them. When Peckinpah
turned again and again to the actors
he felt he could communicate with —
to Coburn and Kristofferson, Warren
Oates, L.Q. Jones, R.G. Armstrong,
Gig Young, Steve McQueen, Ernest
Borgnine, Burt Young, Ben Johnson,
David Warner, Strother Martin, Slim
Pickens — he was validating the stand
his heroes always took.
These virtues, of course, are at
least a partial definition of machismo ;
in "Straw Dogs," his most disturbing
film, he completed it. "Straw Dogs''
begins by belittling its intellectual
(mathematician) protagonist, David
Sumner (Dustin Hoffman, in an ex
pert performance), for his cowardice
— unwilling to confront the increas
ingly perilous life in America in the
early '70s, he has fled with his bride
to her home village in the English

countryside — and ends by enshrin
ing his single-handed slaughter of a
gang of thugs who have raped his wife
and invaded his home. David's wife
Amy (Susan George) has taunted him
for his unmanliness while encourag
ing her rapists; the first shot of her
focuses on her free-swinging breasts,
and every line she speaks sounds like
an invitation to sex or a covert threat,
or both. And this baby doll version of
the young Julie Christie has a juvenile
double — a pouty teenager who, dis
couraged by David's refusal to
respond to her sexual availability,
turns on a local just released from a
mental hospital, in a subplot that
reprises "Of Mice and Men" both in
narrative line (the man unwittingly
kills her) and in theme (women are
nothing but trouble).
As Pauline Kael, ever Peckinpah's
most eloquent champion, correctly
pointed out on the film's release,
"Straw Dogs" was a key film for its
time. Unlike the other, more readily
sanctioned, displays of violence that
came out that same fall and
Christmas (1971) — "The French
Connection," "Dirty Harry," "The
Cowboys," "A Clockwork Orange"
— Peckinpah's movie had at least the
courage of its convictions, as well as a
mastery of craft so stunning that an
admiring viewer was automatically
guilty of complicity in its point of
view. Sitting through it, feeling myself
drawn toward its inevitable explosive
finale, I remember experiencing the
same mixture of awe and revulsion I
had had when I saw Leni
Riefenstahl's Nazi celebration
"Triumph of the Will." You couldn't
deny that Peckinpah had addressed
the issue of the accelerating violence
in our society, and you couldn't
pretend he hadn't seduced you into
sharing David's triumph — insofar as
you registered a deep sense of relief
when the film, wound up unbearably
tight in its first 90 minutes, erupted
into violence in its last half hour. At a
distance of more than 10 years,
though, "Straw Dogs" (while no less
astonishing and no less problematic)
has lost some of its raw power. On a
recent reviewing, I was startled to
find that it seemed tied to its epoch in
a way that the far more ambiguous
"The Wild Bunch" did not.
Peckinpah was fond of referring to
himself as an old whore turning a deft
trick for his studio bosses, but only on
very few occasions — in "The
Getaway" or the necrophilic "Bring
Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia" —
did he fail to bring something vital
and distinctive to even the most drab
assignments. "The Killer Elite" has a
riveting opening scene, behind the
credits, in which anonymous hands
plant a bomb in a building — a model
of narrative shorthand — and a
climactic, almost surrealistic battle
sequence involving dozens of silver
robed Ninja. The tiresome, talky
"Cross of Iron," shot by John Coquil
lon, has an amazing color scheme: ex
otic, overrich greens suffocating in
blue smoke. It also has extraordinary
combat sequences and several
memorable images — an upended
jeep, wheels still spinning; live sol
diers buried in trenches, their flesh
rippling like waves as the artillery
rings out above their heads; blood
seeping from a headless uniform half
sunk in the water; a tank, its operator
unseen, plowing through the rubble
piled on top of it like an unkillable
monster in some apocalyptic science
fiction picture.

The most pleasant surprise among
the late Peckinpahs is "Convoy''
(which has probably the Worst
reputation of any of his movies).
Unlike the other routine jobs he
managed to vivify in some way,
"Convoy," which begins with a shot
of a highway cascading like a water
fall toward the camera, is a relaxed
demonstration of craft. It even con
tains elements of self-parody,' like a
brawl at a truck stop in which ketchup
flows instead of blood, and a direct
allusion to the explosion on the
bridge in "The Wild Bunch" with a
comic kicker — the occupant Of the
shattered vehicle emerges with only a
few injuries. In this cheerfully anar
chic comedy, almost no one ever gets
hurt. A cop car soars through the air,
piercing a billboard sign, and lands in
a ditch, a truck rolls over on its side,
but the cop and the trucker bounce
back like adversaries in a cartoon. In
fact, "Convoy" is as close as a live ac
tion film has ever come to ap
proximating the sensibility of a car
toon: Dirty Lyle, the bad guy sheriff
(Ernest Borgnine), plays Wile E.
Coyote to a fleet of bigger, faster and
cleverer Roadrunner trucks. At one
point, a police car races across the
screen, apparently in hot chase after
its prey; the camera pulls back.and we
see, in a visual punch line worthy of
Chuck Jones, that it's the patrdl vehi
cle that is being chased — by & truck
twice its size, taking its own sweet
time.
Even the oddest of Peckinpah's
movies — the Vietnamized \yestern
"Pat Garrett and Billy the'Kid''
(1973), with its misplaced hippie hero
and its late '60s-early '70s counter
culture cast (Kris Kristoffersou, Bob
Dylan, Rita Coolidge) — has a hyp
notic quality; it lingers in the, mind
years after you've seen it. Its*heavy,
dreamy texture, partly the result of
the modern folk score by Dylan, sug
gests that Peckinpah may have been
trying for something like the atmo
sphere Robert Altman had achieved
in "McCabe and Mrs. Miller" (which
employed songs by Leonard Cohen)
two years earlier, but
wasn't bleak and fatalistic, and "Pat
Garrett" is. In any case, even this
weird, failed effort at finding a com
mon mood to bridge the distance be
tween two experiences (the last gasps
of the freedom of the frontier, the
dying strains of protest against the
Vietnamization of America), though
both are falsified in the process, is
strangely affecting. And there are
magnificent images: Billy riding his
horse slowly along a stream jn the
growing dusk, a barge floating down
the water in the leisurely declining
sunlight of a late afternoon. in the
most remarkable scene, an old man
(Slim Pickens), once an outlaw and
now deputized by his friend Pat Gar
rett (James Coburn), receives'a gun
shot in the belly and crawls ~10 the
water to die. As the strains of Dylan's
"Knockin' on Heaven's DooJ" rise
on the soundtrack, Pickens' wife
(Katy Jurado) sees what has hap
pened and follows him; unable to ap
proach him and violate the privacy of
his last moments, she remains a few
hundred feet above him on the shore,
her eyes filling with tears as the sun
glows red in the stream. Thi* scene
must last no more than two minutes,
but for years (until I saw the-film a
second time) I remembered it as
much longer. The image hid ex
panded in my mind and broken the
bounds of time.

Getaway.*


Sam Peckinpah combined the brash American frontier spirit with depth and sensitivity
The lengthy opening scene of "The
Wild Bunch" — perhaps the longest
credits sequence ever put on film —
follows the renegade heroes, Pike
Bishop (William Holden) and his
rough, rag-taggle crew, the tail end
of the free-riding cowboy spirit, into a
town and into its bank, which they
plan to rob. Every few moments, as a
new credit appears on the screen, the
action freezes, the magnificent worn
faces of the men hardening into
storybook drawings. The final credit,
to the director, Sam Peckinpah, ap
pears just after Pike has shouted a
terse command to one of his men,
who holds the innocent bank custom
ers at gunpoint: "If they move, kill
'em!"
When "The Wild Bunch" plays in
revival houses, that moment usually
provokes laughter, because it seems
such an appropriate signature for
Bloody Sam, the filmmaker whose
name became — after "The Wild
Bunch" (1969) and "Straw Dogs"
(1971) — synonymous for most
moviegoers with excessive, self
indulgent cinematic violence. When
Sam Peckinpah died last month at the
age of 59, 23 years after the release of
his first picture, "The Deadly Com
panions," and before shooting had
begun on his 15th, "On the Rocks,"
he had failed to outlive his bad boy
reputation and to convince most crit
ics and serious filmgoers that his work
merited close, intelligent attention.
Yet America has produced few direc
tors with his impassioned visual com
mand, few elegists for her frontier
past as plaintive and heartbreaking,
few moralists as provocative and
emotionally challenging. The fashion,
especially in the last decade, has been
to relegate Peckinpah to the rank of
professional hack, undistinguished
action director, but the gun battles in
his films equal Griffith's, his best wes
terns surpass John Ford's (and even
at their least inspired, they never suf
fer from the patina of stodginess —
respectability — that Ford acquired
in his Oscared years), and his two
most notorious movies are fierce, full
arguments for an ethic, a vision of life
in this country. While good liberal
audiences were reviling violence on
screen as if it were the cause of all of
this country's urban ills, Peckinpah,
along with most of the other major
American directors of the past two
decades (Arthur Penn, Robert
Altman, Francis Coppola, Martin
Scorsese, Brian De Palma), explored
the nature of violence; his films
threatened audiences because they
told us, with uncompromising and
graphic intensity, that the beast was
in us.
Peckinpah began as a script writer
and eventually director for various
television westerns in the 19505; his
debut film project, "The Deadly
Companions," came about as a con
sequence of his friendship with Brian
Keith, the film's star. It was his
second picture, however, "Ride the
High Country" (1962), that really
displayed his instinct for filmmaking,
and his instinctual understanding of
the western myth, which he continued
to evoke and probe on some level for
the rest c" his life, even in a contem
porary drama like "Straw Dogs" or a
war film like "Cross of Iron" or a
martial arts actioner like "The Killer
Elite." Working with the superb
cinematographer Lucien Ballard,

Peckinpah used the resources of
Cinemascope and Metrocolor to
describe the expansive beauty of the
late 19th-centur> West, and again in
"Major Dundee" (1965), shot by
Sam Leavitt in Eastmancolor and
Panavision, Peckinpah realized the
potential of the big screen as no one
had before him — and as practically
no one in today's video world
(perhaps only Fred Schepisi and Wal
ter Hill) still does.
The pleasures of watching "Major
Dundee" (which include Richard
Harris's stylish performance as Dun
dee's companion and adversary) are
not much dimmed by its heavy
handed script or the stolidity of its
star, Charlton Heston, but Colum
bia's idiocy in chopping sections of it
blurs the shape of the second half.
Peckinpah's resistance to this in
sensitive decision on the studio's part
— he had already dealt with the in
tractability of producers, when MGM
insisted on throwing "Ride the
High Country" onto the lower half of
double bills instead of giving it a
decent release — branded him
"difficult," and he didn't work again
in Hollywood for four years. When he
did, for Warners-Seven Arts, he gave
his bosses more than they bargained
for. "The Wild Bunch" accomplished
in the western genre what Arthur
Penn's "Bonnie and Clyde" had done
for gangster movies two years before:
It burrowed beneath the myth, re
vealing its underpinnings, examining
its implications. But the studio ob
jected to its length (nearly two-and
a-half hours) and its extensive
reliance on slow-motion violence,
and once again Peckinpah's film was
taken away from him and cut without
his approval.
Time and film history have silenced
Penn's detractors, who claimed in
1967 that "Bonnie and Clyde"
glorified thugs while reveling in gore,
but Peckinpah, who went farther than
Penn's death ballet finale into an
agonized, rapturous orgy of violence,
continues to be damned for it. But the
combination of slow motion and
excess in "The Wild Bunch' and the
Peckinpah films that followed it has a
point. Like Penn, riddling the corpses
of his hero and heroine with bullets,
Peckinpah wants us to understand
how final and irrevocable death is, to
demythify it. The avenging sheriff
and his men in "Bonnie and Clyde"
pumped enough lead into Bonnie and
Clyde to deflate the legend they had
become; the rain of gunfire that cuts
down the Wild Bunch suffices to kill
off the Old West. (When, at the end
of "Cross of Iron," James Coburn
and his few surviving comrades let
loose the fury of machine gun and
bayonet on the fellow German soldier
who betrayed them, they want to
eradicate the fact of him — wipe him
out of history.)
Slow motion both preserves the last
moment of a dying man's freedom
and accentuates its loss; it reminds us
of the evanescence of our existence
by prolonging the passage out of it.
Could anyone who watches Jaime
Sanchez' throat being slit by his
Mexican captors in "The Wild
Bunch" seriously doubt the value
Peckinpah places on human life? But
Peckinpah, as complex a sensualist as
Renoir or Ophuls, confuses our
responses: First he films the violence

when Peckinpah invokes the same

There is always a danger in at

corrupt, tyrannical Hollywood sys
tem, in Pike Bishop, in Billy the Kid
(Kris Kristofferson), in Mike (James
Caan), the double-crossed CIA agent
of "The Killer Elite," in the exemp
lary soldier Steiner (James Coburn),
the hero of "Cross of Iron," who tells
a sympathetic major, "I hate all offi
cers," and in the independent (i.e.,
non-union) trucker (played again by
Kristofferson, with his steely blue
eyes and his steely cool) who leads
the "Convoy."
"Aren't your loners and misfits

both are falsified in the process, is
strangely affecting. And there are
magnificent images: Billy riding his
horse slowly along a stream jn the
growing dusk, a barge floating down
the water in the leisurely declining
sunlight of a late afternoon. in the
most remarkable scene, an old man
(Slim Pickens), once an outlaw and
now deputized by his friend Pat Gar
rett (James Coburn), receives'a gun
shot in the belly and crawls ~10 the
water to die. As the strains of Dylan's
"Knockin' on Heaven's DooJ" rise
on the soundtrack, Pickens' wife
(Katy Jurado) sees what has hap
pened and follows him; unable to ap
proach him and violate the privacy of
his last moments, she remains a few
hundred feet above him on the shore,
her eyes filling with tears as the sun
glows red in the stream. Thi* scene
must last no more than two minutes,
but for years (until I saw the-film a
second time) I remembered it as
much longer. The image hid ex
panded in my mind and broken the
bounds of time.

Getaway.*


Sam Peckinpah combined the brash American frontier spirit with depth and sensitivity
The lengthy opening scene of "The
Wild Bunch" — perhaps the longest
credits sequence ever put on film —
follows the renegade heroes, Pike
Bishop (William Holden) and his
rough, rag-taggle crew, the tail end
of the free-riding cowboy spirit, into a
town and into its bank, which they
plan to rob. Every few moments, as a
new credit appears on the screen, the
action freezes, the magnificent worn
faces of the men hardening into
storybook drawings. The final credit,
to the director, Sam Peckinpah, ap
pears just after Pike has shouted a
terse command to one of his men,
who holds the innocent bank custom
ers at gunpoint: "If they move, kill
'em!"
When "The Wild Bunch" plays in
revival houses, that moment usually
provokes laughter, because it seems
such an appropriate signature for
Bloody Sam, the filmmaker whose
name became — after "The Wild
Bunch" (1969) and "Straw Dogs"
(1971) — synonymous for most
moviegoers with excessive, self
indulgent cinematic violence. When
Sam Peckinpah died last month at the
age of 59, 23 years after the release of
his first picture, "The Deadly Com
panions," and before shooting had
begun on his 15th, "On the Rocks,"
he had failed to outlive his bad boy
reputation and to convince most crit
ics and serious filmgoers that his work
merited close, intelligent attention.
Yet America has produced few direc
tors with his impassioned visual com
mand, few elegists for her frontier
past as plaintive and heartbreaking,
few moralists as provocative and
emotionally challenging. The fashion,
especially in the last decade, has been
to relegate Peckinpah to the rank of
professional hack, undistinguished
action director, but the gun battles in
his films equal Griffith's, his best wes
terns surpass John Ford's (and even
at their least inspired, they never suf
fer from the patina of stodginess —
respectability — that Ford acquired
in his Oscared years), and his two
most notorious movies are fierce, full
arguments for an ethic, a vision of life
in this country. While good liberal
audiences were reviling violence on
screen as if it were the cause of all of
this country's urban ills, Peckinpah,
along with most of the other major
American directors of the past two
decades (Arthur Penn, Robert
Altman, Francis Coppola, Martin
Scorsese, Brian De Palma), explored
the nature of violence; his films
threatened audiences because they
told us, with uncompromising and
graphic intensity, that the beast was
in us.
Peckinpah began as a script writer
and eventually director for various
television westerns in the 19505; his
debut film project, "The Deadly
Companions," came about as a con
sequence of his friendship with Brian
Keith, the film's star. It was his
second picture, however, "Ride the
High Country" (1962), that really
displayed his instinct for filmmaking,
and his instinctual understanding of
the western myth, which he continued
to evoke and probe on some level for
the rest c" his life, even in a contem
porary drama like "Straw Dogs" or a
war film like "Cross of Iron" or a
martial arts actioner like "The Killer
Elite." Working with the superb
cinematographer Lucien Ballard,

Peckinpah used the resources of
Cinemascope and Metrocolor to
describe the expansive beauty of the
late 19th-centur> West, and again in
"Major Dundee" (1965), shot by
Sam Leavitt in Eastmancolor and
Panavision, Peckinpah realized the
potential of the big screen as no one
had before him — and as practically
no one in today's video world
(perhaps only Fred Schepisi and Wal
ter Hill) still does.
The pleasures of watching "Major
Dundee" (which include Richard
Harris's stylish performance as Dun
dee's companion and adversary) are
not much dimmed by its heavy
handed script or the stolidity of its
star, Charlton Heston, but Colum
bia's idiocy in chopping sections of it
blurs the shape of the second half.
Peckinpah's resistance to this in
sensitive decision on the studio's part
— he had already dealt with the in
tractability of producers, when MGM
insisted on throwing "Ride the
High Country" onto the lower half of
double bills instead of giving it a
decent release — branded him
"difficult," and he didn't work again
in Hollywood for four years. When he
did, for Warners-Seven Arts, he gave
his bosses more than they bargained
for. "The Wild Bunch" accomplished
in the western genre what Arthur
Penn's "Bonnie and Clyde" had done
for gangster movies two years before:
It burrowed beneath the myth, re
vealing its underpinnings, examining
its implications. But the studio ob
jected to its length (nearly two-and
a-half hours) and its extensive
reliance on slow-motion violence,
and once again Peckinpah's film was
taken away from him and cut without
his approval.
Time and film history have silenced
Penn's detractors, who claimed in
1967 that "Bonnie and Clyde"
glorified thugs while reveling in gore,
but Peckinpah, who went farther than
Penn's death ballet finale into an
agonized, rapturous orgy of violence,
continues to be damned for it. But the
combination of slow motion and
excess in "The Wild Bunch' and the
Peckinpah films that followed it has a
point. Like Penn, riddling the corpses
of his hero and heroine with bullets,
Peckinpah wants us to understand
how final and irrevocable death is, to
demythify it. The avenging sheriff
and his men in "Bonnie and Clyde"
pumped enough lead into Bonnie and
Clyde to deflate the legend they had
become; the rain of gunfire that cuts
down the Wild Bunch suffices to kill
off the Old West. (When, at the end
of "Cross of Iron," James Coburn
and his few surviving comrades let
loose the fury of machine gun and
bayonet on the fellow German soldier
who betrayed them, they want to
eradicate the fact of him — wipe him
out of history.)
Slow motion both preserves the last
moment of a dying man's freedom
and accentuates its loss; it reminds us
of the evanescence of our existence
by prolonging the passage out of it.
Could anyone who watches Jaime
Sanchez' throat being slit by his
Mexican captors in "The Wild
Bunch" seriously doubt the value
Peckinpah places on human life? But
Peckinpah, as complex a sensualist as
Renoir or Ophuls, confuses our
responses: First he films the violence
with an abstract beauty and then he
jolts us out of our esthetic apprecia
tion for it by punctuating it with a

horrific thud as each body co'i
with the ground. "The Wild Bunc.,
is such an extraordinary visceral ex
perience that it forces us to look at
our own reactions to the violence in
it, particularly in the final gunfight, in
which men tumble by the dozens in a
fog of smoke. Alternately appalled
and amazed, numbed and freshly ap
palled, we can no longer look at the
western with the child's simplicity we
brought to a "Stagecoach" or a "Red
River."
Just as Peckinpah ricochets.
tween emotional poles in this se
quence, so he taps back into the west
ern myth even as he undercuts it. For
slow motion, like the photograph, is a
myth-forging device: When William
Holden and his cohorts ride slowly
across the plains, bouncing lightly on
their steeds in the hyperbright, hal
lucinatory sunlight, they acquire a
legendary beauty that is enhanced
when Peckinpah invokes the same
distorted tempo to capture their
death throes. Besides, in movies the
greatest images have the effect of
seeming to halt the passage of time.
The geranium cut by the dead sol
dier's bedside in "Grand Illusion,"
the proud old man, bent on suicide,
rushing toward the train tracks with
his little dog in his arms in "Umberto
D," deny the reality of death by
transforming it into an image that
lives on in our heads. In "The Wild
Bunch," men on horseback leaping

into the water off an exploded bridge
(a tribute to a moment in Sergei
Eisenstein's "October"), a train with
out an engineer at its helm rattling
heedlessly toward its destruction,
transcend the fate of the characters
on the screen. Peckinpah's relentless
investigation of old myths dismantles
them while his artistry creates new
ones from their ashes.
There is always a danger in at
tempting to spot a director's persona
in each of his pictures, but Peckin
pah's career is one of the few in
Hollywood that almost justifies an
auteurist approach. Not only do cer
tain Peckinpah flourishes show up in
film after film — the village celebra
tion scenes, the singing of his favorite
hymn, "We Will Gather at the River"
(especially at funerals), the joyless,
ominous games of children (who
torture scorpions in "The Wild
Bunch," circle a lone dog in "Straw
Dogs" and swing on the jailyard
noose in "Pat Garrett and Billy the
Kid") — but all of his movies rework
the same themes and embrace the
same ethic, even though he claimed
he was only discharging the jobs the
studios threw his way. The wild
bunch may be brutal killers, but their
rebellious stance against the crushing
new world of the company establish
ment ennobles them. Thornton
(Robert Ryan), in charge of hunting
them down, once rode with Pike; he
tells the puny, vulturous stooges hired
on to assist him, "We're after men —
and I wish to God I was with them."
Peckinpah saw himself, battling the
corrupt, tyrannical Hollywood sys
tem, in Pike Bishop, in Billy the Kid
(Kris Kristofferson), in Mike (James
Caan), the double-crossed CIA agent
of "The Killer Elite," in the exemp
lary soldier Steiner (James Coburn),
the hero of "Cross of Iron," who tells
a sympathetic major, "I hate all offi
cers," and in the independent (i.e.,
non-union) trucker (played again by
Kristofferson, with his steely blue
eyes and his steely cool) who leads
the "Convoy."
"Aren't your loners and misfits
conformists to outdated codes?"
William Murray asked Peckinpah in a
Playboy interview in 1972. The direc
tor replied, "Outdated codes like
courage, loyalty, friendship, grace un
der pressure, all the simple virtues
that have become cliches, sure" —
echoing Pike, who says, "You side
with a man and then you stick with
him. If you can't do that, you're like
an animal," or Mike, who enlists the
aid of two former agents considered
by his employers to be, respectively, a
has-been and a psychotic, because
they are his friends and he knows he
can trust them. When Peckinpah
turned again and again to the actors
he felt he could communicate with —
to Coburn and Kristofferson, Warren
Oates, L.Q. Jones, R.G. Armstrong,
Gig Young, Steve McQueen, Ernest
Borgnine, Burt Young, Ben Johnson,
David Warner, Strother Martin, Slim
Pickens — he was validating the stand
his heroes always took.
These virtues, of course, are at
least a partial definition of machismo ;
in "Straw Dogs," his most disturbing
film, he completed it. "Straw Dogs''
begins by belittling its intellectual
(mathematician) protagonist, David
Sumner (Dustin Hoffman, in an ex
pert performance), for his cowardice
— unwilling to confront the increas
ingly perilous life in America in the
early '70s, he has fled with his bride
to her home village in the English

countryside — and ends by enshrin
ing his single-handed slaughter of a
gang of thugs who have raped his wife
and invaded his home. David's wife
Amy (Susan George) has taunted him
for his unmanliness while encourag
ing her rapists; the first shot of her
focuses on her free-swinging breasts,
and every line she speaks sounds like
an invitation to sex or a covert threat,
or both. And this baby doll version of
the young Julie Christie has a juvenile
double — a pouty teenager who, dis
couraged by David's refusal to
respond to her sexual availability,
turns on a local just released from a
mental hospital, in a subplot that
reprises "Of Mice and Men" both in
narrative line (the man unwittingly
kills her) and in theme (women are
nothing but trouble).
As Pauline Kael, ever Peckinpah's
most eloquent champion, correctly
pointed out on the film's release,
"Straw Dogs" was a key film for its
time. Unlike the other, more readily
sanctioned, displays of violence that
came out that same fall and
Christmas (1971) — "The French
Connection," "Dirty Harry," "The
Cowboys," "A Clockwork Orange"
— Peckinpah's movie had at least the
courage of its convictions, as well as a
mastery of craft so stunning that an
admiring viewer was automatically
guilty of complicity in its point of
view. Sitting through it, feeling myself
drawn toward its inevitable explosive
finale, I remember experiencing the
same mixture of awe and revulsion I
had had when I saw Leni
Riefenstahl's Nazi celebration
"Triumph of the Will." You couldn't
deny that Peckinpah had addressed
the issue of the accelerating violence
in our society, and you couldn't
pretend he hadn't seduced you into
sharing David's triumph — insofar as
you registered a deep sense of relief
when the film, wound up unbearably
tight in its first 90 minutes, erupted
into violence in its last half hour. At a
distance of more than 10 years,
though, "Straw Dogs" (while no less
astonishing and no less problematic)
has lost some of its raw power. On a
recent reviewing, I was startled to
find that it seemed tied to its epoch in
a way that the far more ambiguous
"The Wild Bunch" did not.
Peckinpah was fond of referring to
himself as an old whore turning a deft
trick for his studio bosses, but only on
very few occasions — in "The
Getaway" or the necrophilic "Bring
Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia" —
did he fail to bring something vital
and distinctive to even the most drab
assignments. "The Killer Elite" has a
riveting opening scene, behind the
credits, in which anonymous hands
plant a bomb in a building — a model
of narrative shorthand — and a
climactic, almost surrealistic battle
sequence involving dozens of silver
robed Ninja. The tiresome, talky
"Cross of Iron," shot by John Coquil
lon, has an amazing color scheme: ex
otic, overrich greens suffocating in
blue smoke. It also has extraordinary
combat sequences and several
memorable images — an upended
jeep, wheels still spinning; live sol
diers buried in trenches, their flesh
rippling like waves as the artillery
rings out above their heads; blood
seeping from a headless uniform half
sunk in the water; a tank, its operator
unseen, plowing through the rubble
piled on top of it like an unkillable
monster in some apocalyptic science
fiction picture.

The most pleasant surprise among
the late Peckinpahs is "Convoy''
(which has probably the Worst
reputation of any of his movies).
Unlike the other routine jobs he
managed to vivify in some way,
"Convoy," which begins with a shot
of a highway cascading like a water
fall toward the camera, is a relaxed
demonstration of craft. It even con
tains elements of self-parody,' like a
brawl at a truck stop in which ketchup
flows instead of blood, and a direct
allusion to the explosion on the
bridge in "The Wild Bunch" with a
comic kicker — the occupant Of the
shattered vehicle emerges with only a
few injuries. In this cheerfully anar
chic comedy, almost no one ever gets
hurt. A cop car soars through the air,
piercing a billboard sign, and lands in
a ditch, a truck rolls over on its side,
but the cop and the trucker bounce
back like adversaries in a cartoon. In
fact, "Convoy" is as close as a live ac
tion film has ever come to ap
proximating the sensibility of a car
toon: Dirty Lyle, the bad guy sheriff
(Ernest Borgnine), plays Wile E.
Coyote to a fleet of bigger, faster and
cleverer Roadrunner trucks. At one
point, a police car races across the
screen, apparently in hot chase after
its prey; the camera pulls back.and we
see, in a visual punch line worthy of
Chuck Jones, that it's the patrdl vehi
cle that is being chased — by & truck
twice its size, taking its own sweet
time.
Even the oddest of Peckinpah's
movies — the Vietnamized \yestern
"Pat Garrett and Billy the'Kid''
(1973), with its misplaced hippie hero
and its late '60s-early '70s counter
culture cast (Kris Kristoffersou, Bob
Dylan, Rita Coolidge) — has a hyp
notic quality; it lingers in the, mind
years after you've seen it. Its*heavy,
dreamy texture, partly the result of
the modern folk score by Dylan, sug
gests that Peckinpah may have been
trying for something like the atmo
sphere Robert Altman had achieved
in "McCabe and Mrs. Miller" (which
employed songs by Leonard Cohen)
two years earlier, but
wasn't bleak and fatalistic, and "Pat
Garrett" is. In any case, even this
weird, failed effort at finding a com
mon mood to bridge the distance be
tween two experiences (the last gasps
of the freedom of the frontier, the
dying strains of protest against the
Vietnamization of America), though
both are falsified in the process, is
strangely affecting. And there are
magnificent images: Billy riding his
horse slowly along a stream jn the
growing dusk, a barge floating down
the water in the leisurely declining
sunlight of a late afternoon. in the
most remarkable scene, an old man
(Slim Pickens), once an outlaw and
now deputized by his friend Pat Gar
rett (James Coburn), receives'a gun
shot in the belly and crawls ~10 the
water to die. As the strains of Dylan's
"Knockin' on Heaven's DooJ" rise
on the soundtrack, Pickens' wife
(Katy Jurado) sees what has hap
pened and follows him; unable to ap
proach him and violate the privacy of
his last moments, she remains a few
hundred feet above him on the shore,
her eyes filling with tears as the sun
glows red in the stream. Thi* scene
must last no more than two minutes,
but for years (until I saw the-film a
second time) I remembered it as
much longer. The image hid ex
panded in my mind and broken the
bounds of time.

Sam Peckinpah combined the brash American frontier spirit with depth and sensitivity
The lengthy opening scene of "The
Wild Bunch" — perhaps the longest
credits sequence ever put on film —
follows the renegade heroes, Pike
Bishop (William Holden) and his
rough, rag-taggle crew, the tail end
of the free-riding cowboy spirit, into a
town and into its bank, which they
plan to rob. Every few moments, as a
new credit appears on the screen, the
action freezes, the magnificent worn
faces of the men hardening into
storybook drawings. The final credit,
to the director, Sam Peckinpah, ap
pears just after Pike has shouted a
terse command to one of his men,
who holds the innocent bank custom
ers at gunpoint: "If they move, kill
'em!"
When "The Wild Bunch" plays in
revival houses, that moment usually
provokes laughter, because it seems
such an appropriate signature for
Bloody Sam, the filmmaker whose
name became — after "The Wild

Sam Peckinpah died last month at the

he had failed to outlive his bad boy

audiences were reviling violence on
screen as if it were the cause of all of

along with most of the other major

decades (Arthur Penn, Robert
Altman, Francis Coppola, Martin
Scorsese, Brian De Palma), explored
the nature of violence; his films
threatened audiences because they
told us, with uncompromising and
graphic intensity, that the beast was

Peckinpah began as a script writer
and eventually director for various

war film like "Cross of Iron" or a
martial arts actioner like "The Killer

cinematographer Lucien Ballard,

Peckinpah used the resources of
Cinemascope and Metrocolor to
describe the expansive beauty of the
late 19th-centur> West, and again in
"Major Dundee" (1965), shot by
Sam Leavitt in Eastmancolor and
Panavision, Peckinpah realized the
potential of the big screen as no one
had before him — and as practically
no one in today's video world
(perhaps only Fred Schepisi and Wal
ter Hill) still does.
The pleasures of watching "Major

not much dimmed by its heavy
handed script or the stolidity of its

Peckinpah's resistance to this in
sensitive decision on the studio's part
— he had already dealt with the in
tractability of producers, when MGM
insisted on throwing "Ride the
High Country" onto the lower half of
double bills instead of giving it a
decent release — branded him
"difficult," and he didn't work again
in Hollywood for four years. When he
did, for Warners-Seven Arts, he gave
his bosses more than they bargained

in the western genre what Arthur
Penn's "Bonnie and Clyde" had done

1967 that "Bonnie and Clyde"
glorified thugs while reveling in gore,
but Peckinpah, who went farther than
Penn's death ballet finale into an
agonized, rapturous orgy of violence,
continues to be damned for it. But the
combination of slow motion and
excess in "The Wild Bunch' and the
Peckinpah films that followed it has a
point. Like Penn, riddling the corpses
of his hero and heroine with bullets,
Peckinpah wants us to understand
how final and irrevocable death is, to
demythify it. The avenging sheriff
and his men in "Bonnie and Clyde"
pumped enough lead into Bonnie and
Clyde to deflate the legend they had
become; the rain of gunfire that cuts
down the Wild Bunch suffices to kill
off the Old West. (When, at the end
of "Cross of Iron," James Coburn
and his few surviving comrades let
loose the fury of machine gun and
bayonet on the fellow German soldier
who betrayed them, they want to
eradicate the fact of him — wipe him

Slow motion both preserves the last

to Coburn and Kristofferson, Warren
Oates, L.Q. Jones, R.G. Armstrong,
Gig Young, Steve McQueen, Ernest
Borgnine, Burt Young, Ben Johnson,
David Warner, Strother Martin, Slim
Pickens — he was validating the stand
his heroes always took.
These virtues, of course, are at
least a partial definition of machismo ;
in "Straw Dogs," his most disturbing
film, he completed it. "Straw Dogs''
begins by belittling its intellectual
(mathematician) protagonist, David
Sumner (Dustin Hoffman, in an ex
pert performance), for his cowardice
— unwilling to confront the increas
ingly perilous life in America in the
early '70s, he has fled with his bride
to her home village in the English

countryside — and ends by enshrin
ing his single-handed slaughter of a
gang of thugs who have raped his wife
and invaded his home. David's wife
Amy (Susan George) has taunted him
for his unmanliness while encourag
ing her rapists; the first shot of her
focuses on her free-swinging breasts,
and every line she speaks sounds like
an invitation to sex or a covert threat,
or both. And this baby doll version of
the young Julie Christie has a juvenile
double — a pouty teenager who, dis
couraged by David's refusal to
respond to her sexual availability,
turns on a local just released from a
mental hospital, in a subplot that
reprises "Of Mice and Men" both in
narrative line (the man unwittingly
kills her) and in theme (women are
nothing but trouble).
As Pauline Kael, ever Peckinpah's
most eloquent champion, correctly
pointed out on the film's release,
"Straw Dogs" was a key film for its
time. Unlike the other, more readily
sanctioned, displays of violence that
came out that same fall and
Christmas (1971) — "The French
Connection," "Dirty Harry," "The
Cowboys," "A Clockwork Orange"
— Peckinpah's movie had at least the
courage of its convictions, as well as a
mastery of craft so stunning that an
admiring viewer was automatically
guilty of complicity in its point of
view. Sitting through it, feeling myself
drawn toward its inevitable explosive
finale, I remember experiencing the
same mixture of awe and revulsion I
had had when I saw Leni
Riefenstahl's Nazi celebration
"Triumph of the Will." You couldn't
deny that Peckinpah had addressed
the issue of the accelerating violence
in our society, and you couldn't
pretend he hadn't seduced you into
sharing David's triumph — insofar as
you registered a deep sense of relief
when the film, wound up unbearably
tight in its first 90 minutes, erupted
into violence in its last half hour. At a
distance of more than 10 years,
though, "Straw Dogs" (while no less
astonishing and no less problematic)
has lost some of its raw power. On a
recent reviewing, I was startled to
find that it seemed tied to its epoch in
a way that the far more ambiguous
"The Wild Bunch" did not.
Peckinpah was fond of referring to
himself as an old whore turning a deft
trick for his studio bosses, but only on
very few occasions — in "The
Getaway" or the necrophilic "Bring
Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia" —
did he fail to bring something vital
and distinctive to even the most drab
assignments. "The Killer Elite" has a
riveting opening scene, behind the
credits, in which anonymous hands
plant a bomb in a building — a model
of narrative shorthand — and a
climactic, almost surrealistic battle
sequence involving dozens of silver
robed Ninja. The tiresome, talky
"Cross of Iron," shot by John Coquil
lon, has an amazing color scheme: ex
otic, overrich greens suffocating in
blue smoke. It also has extraordinary
combat sequences and several
memorable images — an upended
jeep, wheels still spinning; live sol
diers buried in trenches, their flesh
rippling like waves as the artillery
rings out above their heads; blood
seeping from a headless uniform half
sunk in the water; a tank, its operator
unseen, plowing through the rubble
piled on top of it like an unkillable
monster in some apocalyptic science
fiction picture.

The most pleasant surprise among
the late Peckinpahs is "Convoy''
(which has probably the Worst
reputation of any of his movies).
Unlike the other routine jobs he
managed to vivify in some way,
"Convoy," which begins with a shot
of a highway cascading like a water
fall toward the camera, is a relaxed
demonstration of craft. It even con
tains elements of self-parody,' like a
brawl at a truck stop in which ketchup
flows instead of blood, and a direct
allusion to the explosion on the
bridge in "The Wild Bunch" with a
comic kicker — the occupant Of the
shattered vehicle emerges with only a
few injuries. In this cheerfully anar
chic comedy, almost no one ever gets
hurt. A cop car soars through the air,
piercing a billboard sign, and lands in
a ditch, a truck rolls over on its side,
but the cop and the trucker bounce
back like adversaries in a cartoon. In
fact, "Convoy" is as close as a live ac
tion film has ever come to ap
proximating the sensibility of a car
toon: Dirty Lyle, the bad guy sheriff
(Ernest Borgnine), plays Wile E.
Coyote to a fleet of bigger, faster and
cleverer Roadrunner trucks. At one
point, a police car races across the
screen, apparently in hot chase after
its prey; the camera pulls back.and we
see, in a visual punch line worthy of
Chuck Jones, that it's the patrdl vehi
cle that is being chased — by & truck
twice its size, taking its own sweet
time.
Even the oddest of Peckinpah's
movies — the Vietnamized \yestern
"Pat Garrett and Billy the'Kid''
(1973), with its misplaced hippie hero
and its late '60s-early '70s counter
culture cast (Kris Kristoffersou, Bob
Dylan, Rita Coolidge) — has a hyp
notic quality; it lingers in the, mind
years after you've seen it. Its*heavy,
dreamy texture, partly the result of
the modern folk score by Dylan, sug
gests that Peckinpah may have been
trying for something like the atmo
sphere Robert Altman had achieved
in "McCabe and Mrs. Miller" (which
employed songs by Leonard Cohen)
two years earlier, but
wasn't bleak and fatalistic, and "Pat
Garrett" is. In any case, even this
weird, failed effort at finding a com
mon mood to bridge the distance be
tween two experiences (the last gasps
of the freedom of the frontier, the
dying strains of protest against the
Vietnamization of America), though
both are falsified in the process, is
strangely affecting. And there are
magnificent images: Billy riding his
horse slowly along a stream jn the
growing dusk, a barge floating down
the water in the leisurely declining
sunlight of a late afternoon. in the
most remarkable scene, an old man
(Slim Pickens), once an outlaw and
now deputized by his friend Pat Gar
rett (James Coburn), receives'a gun
shot in the belly and crawls ~10 the
water to die. As the strains of Dylan's
"Knockin' on Heaven's DooJ" rise
on the soundtrack, Pickens' wife
(Katy Jurado) sees what has hap
pened and follows him; unable to ap
proach him and violate the privacy of
his last moments, she remains a few
hundred feet above him on the shore,
her eyes filling with tears as the sun
glows red in the stream. Thi* scene
must last no more than two minutes,
but for years (until I saw the-film a
second time) I remembered it as
much longer. The image hid ex
panded in my mind and broken the
bounds of time.

Getaway.*


Sam Peckinpah combined the brash American frontier spirit with depth and sensitivity
The lengthy opening scene of "The
Wild Bunch" — perhaps the longest
credits sequence ever put on film —
follows the renegade heroes, Pike
Bishop (William Holden) and his
rough, rag-taggle crew, the tail end
of the free-riding cowboy spirit, into a
town and into its bank, which they
plan to rob. Every few moments, as a
new credit appears on the screen, the
action freezes, the magnificent worn
faces of the men hardening into
storybook drawings. The final credit,
to the director, Sam Peckinpah, ap
pears just after Pike has shouted a
terse command to one of his men,
who holds the innocent bank custom
ers at gunpoint: "If they move, kill
'em!"
When "The Wild Bunch" plays in
revival houses, that moment usually
provokes laughter, because it seems
such an appropriate signature for
Bloody Sam, the filmmaker whose
name became — after "The Wild
Bunch" (1969) and "Straw Dogs"
(1971) — synonymous for most
moviegoers with excessive, self
indulgent cinematic violence. When
Sam Peckinpah died last month at the
age of 59, 23 years after the release of
his first picture, "The Deadly Com
panions," and before shooting had
begun on his 15th, "On the Rocks,"
he had failed to outlive his bad boy
reputation and to convince most crit
ics and serious filmgoers that his work
merited close, intelligent attention.
Yet America has produced few direc
tors with his impassioned visual com
mand, few elegists for her frontier
past as plaintive and heartbreaking,
few moralists as provocative and
emotionally challenging. The fashion,
especially in the last decade, has been
to relegate Peckinpah to the rank of
professional hack, undistinguished
action director, but the gun battles in
his films equal Griffith's, his best wes
terns surpass John Ford's (and even
at their least inspired, they never suf
fer from the patina of stodginess —
respectability — that Ford acquired
in his Oscared years), and his two
most notorious movies are fierce, full
arguments for an ethic, a vision of life
in this country. While good liberal
audiences were reviling violence on
screen as if it were the cause of all of
this country's urban ills, Peckinpah,
along with most of the other major
American directors of the past two
decades (Arthur Penn, Robert
Altman, Francis Coppola, Martin
Scorsese, Brian De Palma), explored
the nature of violence; his films
threatened audiences because they
told us, with uncompromising and
graphic intensity, that the beast was
in us.
Peckinpah began as a script writer
and eventually director for various
television westerns in the 19505; his
debut film project, "The Deadly
Companions," came about as a con
sequence of his friendship with Brian
Keith, the film's star. It was his
second picture, however, "Ride the
High Country" (1962), that really
displayed his instinct for filmmaking,
and his instinctual understanding of
the western myth, which he continued
to evoke and probe on some level for
the rest c" his life, even in a contem
porary drama like "Straw Dogs" or a
war film like "Cross of Iron" or a
martial arts actioner like "The Killer
Elite." Working with the superb
cinematographer Lucien Ballard,

Peckinpah used the resources of
Cinemascope and Metrocolor to
describe the expansive beauty of the
late 19th-centur> West, and again in
"Major Dundee" (1965), shot by
Sam Leavitt in Eastmancolor and
Panavision, Peckinpah realized the
potential of the big screen as no one
had before him — and as practically
no one in today's video world
(perhaps only Fred Schepisi and Wal
ter Hill) still does.
The pleasures of watching "Major
Dundee" (which include Richard
Harris's stylish performance as Dun
dee's companion and adversary) are
not much dimmed by its heavy
handed script or the stolidity of its
star, Charlton Heston, but Colum
bia's idiocy in chopping sections of it
blurs the shape of the second half.
Peckinpah's resistance to this in
sensitive decision on the studio's part
— he had already dealt with the in
tractability of producers, when MGM
insisted on throwing "Ride the
High Country" onto the lower half of
double bills instead of giving it a
decent release — branded him
"difficult," and he didn't work again
in Hollywood for four years. When he
did, for Warners-Seven Arts, he gave
his bosses more than they bargained
for. "The Wild Bunch" accomplished
in the western genre what Arthur
Penn's "Bonnie and Clyde" had done
for gangster movies two years before:
It burrowed beneath the myth, re
vealing its underpinnings, examining
its implications. But the studio ob
jected to its length (nearly two-and
a-half hours) and its extensive
reliance on slow-motion violence,
and once again Peckinpah's film was
taken away from him and cut without
his approval.
Time and film history have silenced
Penn's detractors, who claimed in
1967 that "Bonnie and Clyde"
glorified thugs while reveling in gore,
but Peckinpah, who went farther than
Penn's death ballet finale into an
agonized, rapturous orgy of violence,
continues to be damned for it. But the
combination of slow motion and
excess in "The Wild Bunch' and the
Peckinpah films that followed it has a
point. Like Penn, riddling the corpses
of his hero and heroine with bullets,
Peckinpah wants us to understand
how final and irrevocable death is, to
demythify it. The avenging sheriff
and his men in "Bonnie and Clyde"
pumped enough lead into Bonnie and
Clyde to deflate the legend they had
become; the rain of gunfire that cuts
down the Wild Bunch suffices to kill
off the Old West. (When, at the end
of "Cross of Iron," James Coburn
and his few surviving comrades let
loose the fury of machine gun and
bayonet on the fellow German soldier
who betrayed them, they want to
eradicate the fact of him — wipe him
out of history.)
Slow motion both preserves the last
moment of a dying man's freedom
and accentuates its loss; it reminds us
of the evanescence of our existence
by prolonging the passage out of it.
Could anyone who watches Jaime
Sanchez' throat being slit by his
Mexican captors in "The Wild
Bunch" seriously doubt the value
Peckinpah places on human life? But
Peckinpah, as complex a sensualist as
Renoir or Ophuls, confuses our
responses: First he films the violence
with an abstract beauty and then he
jolts us out of our esthetic apprecia
tion for it by punctuating it with a

horrific thud as each body co'i
with the ground. "The Wild Bunc.,
is such an extraordinary visceral ex
perience that it forces us to look at
our own reactions to the violence in
it, particularly in the final gunfight, in
which men tumble by the dozens in a
fog of smoke. Alternately appalled
and amazed, numbed and freshly ap
palled, we can no longer look at the
western with the child's simplicity we
brought to a "Stagecoach" or a "Red
River."
Just as Peckinpah ricochets.
tween emotional poles in this se
quence, so he taps back into the west
ern myth even as he undercuts it. For
slow motion, like the photograph, is a
myth-forging device: When William
Holden and his cohorts ride slowly
across the plains, bouncing lightly on
their steeds in the hyperbright, hal
lucinatory sunlight, they acquire a
legendary beauty that is enhanced
when Peckinpah invokes the same
distorted tempo to capture their
death throes. Besides, in movies the
greatest images have the effect of
seeming to halt the passage of time.
The geranium cut by the dead sol
dier's bedside in "Grand Illusion,"
the proud old man, bent on suicide,
rushing toward the train tracks with
his little dog in his arms in "Umberto
D," deny the reality of death by
transforming it into an image that
lives on in our heads. In "The Wild
Bunch," men on horseback leaping

into the water off an exploded bridge
(a tribute to a moment in Sergei
Eisenstein's "October"), a train with
out an engineer at its helm rattling
heedlessly toward its destruction,
transcend the fate of the characters
on the screen. Peckinpah's relentless
investigation of old myths dismantles
them while his artistry creates new
ones from their ashes.
There is always a danger in at
tempting to spot a director's persona
in each of his pictures, but Peckin
pah's career is one of the few in
Hollywood that almost justifies an
auteurist approach. Not only do cer
tain Peckinpah flourishes show up in
film after film — the village celebra
tion scenes, the singing of his favorite
hymn, "We Will Gather at the River"
(especially at funerals), the joyless,
ominous games of children (who
torture scorpions in "The Wild
Bunch," circle a lone dog in "Straw
Dogs" and swing on the jailyard
noose in "Pat Garrett and Billy the
Kid") — but all of his movies rework
the same themes and embrace the
same ethic, even though he claimed
he was only discharging the jobs the
studios threw his way. The wild
bunch may be brutal killers, but their
rebellious stance against the crushing
new world of the company establish
ment ennobles them. Thornton
(Robert Ryan), in charge of hunting
them down, once rode with Pike; he
tells the puny, vulturous stooges hired
on to assist him, "We're after men —
and I wish to God I was with them."
Peckinpah saw himself, battling the
corrupt, tyrannical Hollywood sys
tem, in Pike Bishop, in Billy the Kid
(Kris Kristofferson), in Mike (James
Caan), the double-crossed CIA agent
of "The Killer Elite," in the exemp
lary soldier Steiner (James Coburn),
the hero of "Cross of Iron," who tells
a sympathetic major, "I hate all offi
cers," and in the independent (i.e.,
non-union) trucker (played again by
Kristofferson, with his steely blue
eyes and his steely cool) who leads
the "Convoy."
"Aren't your loners and misfits
conformists to outdated codes?"
William Murray asked Peckinpah in a
Playboy interview in 1972. The direc
tor replied, "Outdated codes like
courage, loyalty, friendship, grace un
der pressure, all the simple virtues
that have become cliches, sure" —
echoing Pike, who says, "You side
with a man and then you stick with
him. If you can't do that, you're like
an animal," or Mike, who enlists the
aid of two former agents considered
by his employers to be, respectively, a
has-been and a psychotic, because
they are his friends and he knows he
can trust them. When Peckinpah
turned again and again to the actors
he felt he could communicate with —
to Coburn and Kristofferson, Warren
Oates, L.Q. Jones, R.G. Armstrong,
Gig Young, Steve McQueen, Ernest
Borgnine, Burt Young, Ben Johnson,
David Warner, Strother Martin, Slim
Pickens — he was validating the stand
his heroes always took.
These virtues, of course, are at
least a partial definition of machismo ;
in "Straw Dogs," his most disturbing
film, he completed it. "Straw Dogs''
begins by belittling its intellectual
(mathematician) protagonist, David
