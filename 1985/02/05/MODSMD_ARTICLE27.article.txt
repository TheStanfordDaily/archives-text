# Soul artist turns to gospel with a beat
## 
### TONY TRAN 
While driving to Flint Center in De Anza College to see
A 1 Green in concert Friday night, my friend Steve and I
were discussing what kind of a show we could expect from
the legendary 1970s pop/soul singer who had reputedly
gone gospel. For those of you who have forgotten who A 1
Green is, I would like to refresh your memory. For those
who never knew, I will enlighten your musical taste and
spectrum. Memphis-born and raised, A 1 Green was one of
the two (the other was Stevie Wonder) most successful
and highly acclaimed black pop/rock artists of the early-to
mid-'7os.
He had an extraordinarily large amount of top-notch
soul music to his credit in those six or seven years, in terms
of whole albums ("Call Me," "Let's Stay Together,"
"Livin' for You," "I'm Still in Love with You," etc.) as
well as individual songs ("Let's Get Married;" "You
Ought to Be with Me," "Love and Happiness," "Tired of
Being Alone," etc.). Most of this stuff was very good, and
most became smash hits. He was in many ways the perfect
soul singer: The proud inheritor of the soul tradition as
handed down by such immortals as Otis Redding and Sam
Cooke, Green was a first-rate composer and vocalist, con
sidered by many to be the sexiest soul singer of his time.
He owned one of the most subtle, exciting and distinctive
voices in the history of soul music, and, in my opinion, was
the niost adept soul man ever at covering other artists'
songs. Listen to his versions of Hank Williams' "I'm So
Lonesome I Could Cry," or Willie Nelson's "Funny How
Time Just Slips Away," or the Bee Gee's "How Can You
Mend a Broken Heart," and you will know what I mean.
Perhaps it was inevitable that he would sooner or later
run out of gas; no one can maintain such a prolific
"groove" indefinitely. "The Belle Album," released in
1977, marked the start of a gradual decline in both
creativity and popularity. By the turn of the decade, A 1
Green had disappeared from the pop music scene. He has
since been rumored to have embraced Christianity and
gospel music, in the manner of Little Richard.
Although we both knew that the concert would feature
lots of gospel, Steve and I seemed to differ a little bit on
our expectations for the concert. Steve said that he would
not be really happy unless A 1 played a healthy cross sec
tion of the "oldies but goodies" from the '70s — songs
that he knew and loved. I agreed, but also tended to
believe that maybe just the experience of seeing "The
Legendary A 1 Green Live in Concert" would be
worthwhile and enough in itself. For me, viewing the con
text of this concert from the perspective of history was per
haps just as important as from the standpoint of the
show's actual content.
From the start of the show, it was apparent that A 1
Green still had the voice, and that the crowd still loved
him; the opening round of applause bordered on pan
demonium. It did not take me long to see why he has been
deemed among the greatest soul showmen ever. Singer
audience interaction and rapport was extensive through
out the concert, as he periodically handed out roses to
delirious women in the audience. The back-up band, in
cluding three female gospel singers, was very competent,
able to adapt to the frequently shifting tempo and mood
changes quite smoothly.
There was a conspicuous, glaring element missing from
the band, however: a horn section — the trademark and

lifeblood of soul music.
It was a gospel concert, and Al Green acted more the
part of a sermonizing, religious-revival preacher than a
thoroughbred soul singer. He endlessly urged the crowd
— many of whom were stomping, swaying and shouting,
caught up in the spiritual fervor of the moment and
Green's magnetic persona — to hear the word of the Lord
and follow in the footsteps of Christ. The titles of the
songs he performed told the story: "Amazing Grace,"
"Trust in God," "People Get Ready (There's a Train a-
Comin')," "In the Name of Jesus," among others. He
sang only one song from his goldmine of '70s hits, the
striking "Belle." One verse from the song goes:
It's you I want,
But it's Him that I need.. ..
So, if you came to hear the well-known hits, you were
bound to be disappointed.
As every self-respecting critic or rock music fan should
do, however, I had to look at it from his point of view. At
one point in the concert, Green explained why he hasn't
merely continued playing the blues and soul hits that have
brought him such fame and fortune. His reasoning follows
more or less on the order of, "There is a time for games,
fun and sin, and a time for truth, devotion and salvation."
Apparently, the old routine and formula has worn off or
become tiresome, and he needed a new, meaningful direc
tion where he could channel all his energy and consider
able talents. He found this direction in God, and became
the Rev. Al Green.
His born-again evangelism represents a challenge to
rock fans, in the same way of, say, folksinger Bob Dylan's
turn to electric rock in 1965. Each of us fans can deal with
this in our own way, although I must admit that it's a hell
of a lot easier to turn our backs on an artist if he has the
"audacity" to go through such a drastic stylistic change.
Maybe we should try to respect Al Green for being what
he is, rather than continuing to want him to be as we want
him to be. One definitely encouraging thing about the
show, though — gospel and pop/rock can coexist har
moniously. From what I heard at the concert, gospel is
very much compatible with a big booming beat,
propulsive bass and crunching guitar. Indeed, the back-up
band at times played music so loud and hard it can't be
termed as anything else than "rock." (My friend
remarked that it even sounded like Van Halen at times.)
But the concert was first and last a gospel show, and
that means lots of spoken and sung words about religion
and salvation, and this was likely to have different effects
on different people in the audience. I can understand, for
example, how an atheist who just wanted to hear the old
hits would feel somewhat uncomfortable at the show, and
a little bit angry, too — not only did he not get to hear his
favorites, but the tickets were expensive and the show was
not that long (a little more than one hour).
The final analysis is that if you are dying to hear his stuff
from the '70s, don't go see Al Green. But, if you are very
religious and don't mind gospel music (especially the hard
gospel-rock variety), or if you know enough about Al
Green to realize and respect his position in the history of
pop/rock/soul music, you won't be disappointed with the
show.
And definitely do go see him if you have never heard of
him (or at least buy the records). The voice is reason
enough.

sang only one song from his goldmine of '70s hits, the
striking "Belle." One verse from the song goes:
It's you I want,
But it's Him that I need.. ..
So, if you came to hear the well-known hits, you were
bound to be disappointed.
As every self-respecting critic or rock music fan should
do, however, I had to look at it from his point of view. At
one point in the concert, Green explained why he hasn't
merely continued playing the blues and soul hits that have
brought him such fame and fortune. His reasoning follows
more or less on the order of, "There is a time for games,
fun and sin, and a time for truth, devotion and salvation."
Apparently, the old routine and formula has worn off or
become tiresome, and he needed a new, meaningful direc
tion where he could channel all his energy and consider
able talents. He found this direction in God, and became
the Rev. Al Green.
His born-again evangelism represents a challenge to
rock fans, in the same way of, say, folksinger Bob Dylan's
turn to electric rock in 1965. Each of us fans can deal with
this in our own way, although I must admit that it's a hell
of a lot easier to turn our backs on an artist if he has the
"audacity" to go through such a drastic stylistic change.
Maybe we should try to respect Al Green for being what
he is, rather than continuing to want him to be as we want
him to be. One definitely encouraging thing about the
show, though — gospel and pop/rock can coexist har
moniously. From what I heard at the concert, gospel is
very much compatible with a big booming beat,
propulsive bass and crunching guitar. Indeed, the back-up
band at times played music so loud and hard it can't be
termed as anything else than "rock." (My friend
remarked that it even sounded like Van Halen at times.)
But the concert was first and last a gospel show, and
that means lots of spoken and sung words about religion
and salvation, and this was likely to have different effects
on different people in the audience. I can understand, for
example, how an atheist who just wanted to hear the old
hits would feel somewhat uncomfortable at the show, and
a little bit angry, too — not only did he not get to hear his
favorites, but the tickets were expensive and the show was
not that long (a little more than one hour).
The final analysis is that if you are dying to hear his stuff
from the '70s, don't go see Al Green. But, if you are very
religious and don't mind gospel music (especially the hard
gospel-rock variety), or if you know enough about Al
Green to realize and respect his position in the history of
pop/rock/soul music, you won't be disappointed with the
show.
And definitely do go see him if you have never heard of
him (or at least buy the records). The voice is reason
enough.

While driving to Flint Center in De Anza College to see
A 1 Green in concert Friday night, my friend Steve and I
were discussing what kind of a show we could expect from
the legendary 1970s pop/soul singer who had reputedly
gone gospel. For those of you who have forgotten who A 1
Green is, I would like to refresh your memory. For those
who never knew, I will enlighten your musical taste and
spectrum. Memphis-born and raised, A 1 Green was one of
the two (the other was Stevie Wonder) most successful
and highly acclaimed black pop/rock artists of the early-to
mid-'7os.
He had an extraordinarily large amount of top-notch
soul music to his credit in those six or seven years, in terms
of whole albums ("Call Me," "Let's Stay Together,"
"Livin' for You," "I'm Still in Love with You," etc.) as
well as individual songs ("Let's Get Married;" "You
Ought to Be with Me," "Love and Happiness," "Tired of
Being Alone," etc.). Most of this stuff was very good, and
most became smash hits. He was in many ways the perfect
soul singer: The proud inheritor of the soul tradition as
handed down by such immortals as Otis Redding and Sam
Cooke, Green was a first-rate composer and vocalist, con
sidered by many to be the sexiest soul singer of his time.
He owned one of the most subtle, exciting and distinctive
voices in the history of soul music, and, in my opinion, was
the niost adept soul man ever at covering other artists'
songs. Listen to his versions of Hank Williams' "I'm So
Lonesome I Could Cry," or Willie Nelson's "Funny How
Time Just Slips Away," or the Bee Gee's "How Can You
Mend a Broken Heart," and you will know what I mean.
Perhaps it was inevitable that he would sooner or later
run out of gas; no one can maintain such a prolific
"groove" indefinitely. "The Belle Album," released in
1977, marked the start of a gradual decline in both
creativity and popularity. By the turn of the decade, A 1
Green had disappeared from the pop music scene. He has
since been rumored to have embraced Christianity and
gospel music, in the manner of Little Richard.
Although we both knew that the concert would feature
lots of gospel, Steve and I seemed to differ a little bit on
our expectations for the concert. Steve said that he would
not be really happy unless A 1 played a healthy cross sec
tion of the "oldies but goodies" from the '70s — songs
that he knew and loved. I agreed, but also tended to
believe that maybe just the experience of seeing "The
Legendary A 1 Green Live in Concert" would be
worthwhile and enough in itself. For me, viewing the con
text of this concert from the perspective of history was per
haps just as important as from the standpoint of the
show's actual content.
From the start of the show, it was apparent that A 1
Green still had the voice, and that the crowd still loved
him; the opening round of applause bordered on pan
demonium. It did not take me long to see why he has been
deemed among the greatest soul showmen ever. Singer
audience interaction and rapport was extensive through
out the concert, as he periodically handed out roses to
delirious women in the audience. The back-up band, in
cluding three female gospel singers, was very competent,
able to adapt to the frequently shifting tempo and mood
changes quite smoothly.
There was a conspicuous, glaring element missing from
the band, however: a horn section — the trademark and

lifeblood of soul music.
It was a gospel concert, and Al Green acted more the
part of a sermonizing, religious-revival preacher than a
thoroughbred soul singer. He endlessly urged the crowd
— many of whom were stomping, swaying and shouting,
caught up in the spiritual fervor of the moment and
Green's magnetic persona — to hear the word of the Lord
and follow in the footsteps of Christ. The titles of the
songs he performed told the story: "Amazing Grace,"
"Trust in God," "People Get Ready (There's a Train a-
Comin')," "In the Name of Jesus," among others. He
sang only one song from his goldmine of '70s hits, the
striking "Belle." One verse from the song goes:
It's you I want,
