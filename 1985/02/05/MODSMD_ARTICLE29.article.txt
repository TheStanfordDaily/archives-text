# 'Chess' predictable, but it has potential

### ANDREW CROWELL 
With the World Chess Champion
ship between Karpov and Kasparov
now entering its record-shattering
109 th week and with the recently re
initiated U.S./Soviet talks, it seems all
too appropriate to review the
"Chess" album released late last
year.
What do chess and foreign rela
tions have in common?
Quite a bit, according to Benny
Andersson, Tim Rice and Bjorn Ul
vaeus, the creators of this musical-in
progress.
"Chess" is the story of the World
Chess Championship between an
American and a Russian and all the
complications which arise during the
competition as each seeks to make a
name for himself and his country
while attempting to humiliate his op
ponent. It is largely a story of betrayal
and egocentrism from which the ac
tion often results.
The music is varied and on the
whole quite enjoyable. The London
Symphony Orchestra provides a su
perb accompaniment to the
Ambrosian Singers along with
numerous other vocalists that per
form on the soundtrack. Unfortun
ately, the lyrics wear a bit too thin in
spots, revealing a few holes that need
to be reworked before this show hits
the theater circuit.
The album begins with the delight
fully upbeat "Merano," which sets an
impressive tone for the show. The lis
tener learns of the excitement of the
inhabitants of this little Italian village
as they look forward to the chess
championship that will soon be
taking place there. (Actually, the
people are more excited about the
media coverage and the increased
revenues which are sure to accom

pany the event.) As the American
enters the scene, the Rodgers and
Hammerstein show tune transforms
into a rock song. What is most
amusing about the American is that

his voice closely resembles that of
David Lee Roth and, throughout the
show, his appearance is proceeded by
what sounds like Eddie Van Halen
guitar solos. Not too surprisingly, the

American sings about the fame (and
money) he wishes to acquire by
defeating his Russian opponent. In
"The Russian," the music and lyrics
quickly switch directions. The chorus

line is replaced by a primitive and
ominous musical background as the
Russian clarifies the situations to a
KGB agent. "He's a brilliant lunatic
and you can't tell which way he'll

jump — like his game he's impossible
to analyze — you can't dissect him,
predict him. ... "
Needless to say, the plot thicken#.'

Yes, 1 think so, too. The 0

all too predictable. The two slightly
disillusioned lovers sing: "You arid 112/ 1

Not too deep and a bit cliche; i a '
agree. Realizing that "C'hess" '
yet finished and that it is intended tb
be seen as well as heard, 1 susbedf '
(and hope) that Andersson, Rice {ihtf
Ulvaeus will expand this project
more. The music is fun to listen tb v '„
and the story does have potential.it'
would be a shame, though, to sdß"
"Chess" remain one more Trivial' 1
Pursuit.
