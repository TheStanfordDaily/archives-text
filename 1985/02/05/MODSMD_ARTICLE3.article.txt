# Center to consolidate service programs
## 
### REBECCA RUBIN 
In response to questions from leaders of two
recently terminated extradepartmental programs
here, Catherine Milton, special assistant to Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy and director of the
new Public Service Center, says the functions and
objectives of ARLO and SCIRE will continue to be
addressed by the University.
The Public Service Center at Owen House
already houses Stanford-in-Government, Stanford
Volunteer Network, Stanford Students Making A
Difference and the Summer Public Service Fellow
ship. With the decision to streamline the inter
departmental programs of UGS and URO, the
scope of the center is expanding.
According to Marty Fung, student co-chairman
of ARLO, the future prospects of his program are
uncertain if it relocates to Owen House. There is
"confusion as to what is to become of ARLO.
They've told us we're to be incorporated into the
Public Service Center. That wouldn't be so bad if
they kept ARLO functions alive. "
Currently, the Action Research Liaison Office
(ARLO) provides credit to students who conduct
research, under the supervision of faculty mem
bers, in local non-profit organizations and
governmental agencies.
According to Fung, "The Public Service Center
doesn't have any plans for ARLO after it becomes
incorporated. The faculty, students, and commu
nity groups have all lauded ARLO. We don't un
derstand why they want to stop something that's
working fine. They keep telling us, 'Don't worry

about it,' but they haven't given us anything con
crete as to the maintenance of the ARLO series."
"In letters, they say ARLO will cease to exist;
publicly, they say it will exist. That's where the am
biguity comes into play," he said.
"The main thing we're fighting for is not the
name ARLO but the function and what it stands
for. If we can get that to carry over, that's what we
need: for it to be maintained in its current form."
With regard to ARLO, Milton said that credit
would be made available in much the same manner
as was previously arranged through that organiza
tion: "The student will have a faculty member as a
sponsor, and credit will then be available through
the department. The details need to be worked out,
but it will be run similarly to the way ARLO credit
is granted now."
Judy Adams, co-director of the Student Center
for Innovation in Research and Education
(SCIRE), voices sentiments similar to those of the
ARLO directors: "I have no idea what the specific
plans will be. All I know is, SCIRE is to be taken
over June 15."
According to Adams, the function of SCIRE is
twofold: first, to provide credit for ex
tradepartmental internships and interdisciplinary
work, and, second, to coordinate the Clearinghouse
Catalog of intern and research opportunities.
Adams points out that, while the Public Service
Center has made it clear to SCIRE that the catalog
will be continued, it remains unclear as to what will
become of SCIRE's main purpose: "Academic func
tions have been dropped without any specification
of how they will be continued. [Assoc. Dean of

Humanities and Sciences Carolyn LougeeJ is
working on setting up options, but we don't know
specifically what she's done. What's up in the air is
the question of credit and how non-clearinghouse
functions will he continued. We're hoping that we
can have a role in the transfer."
With respect to the SCIRE program, Milton said,
"The clearinghouse will be done by CPPC. The
plan is to have this all accessible by computers, and
it will probably also be printed up."
Milton said that ARLO and SCIRE were not
ending because of failure. She said the programs
were consolidated to make them more accessible
for the community.
Sarah Vonderlippe, co-coordinator of the up
coming conference on world hunger, a program af
filiated with the Public Service Center, reiterated
Milton's points: "We're not stopping SCIRE or
ARLO, we're continuing a very valuable program
begun by them. What we've done is taken a collec
tion of programs and projects and combined them
in the center — a real step toward having a Public
Service Center. Catherine (Milton) is really good at
taking students who want to work in public service
and giving them the opportunity to do it. If the sup
port structure there, if there's a place you can go,
that's really helpful. That's what this place could
become — it could be fantastic."
Also at issue is the question of the
jobs of the current program leaders of both ARLO
and SCIRE. While Milton stated that those jobs
would be terminated, Vonderlippe added: "We're
hoping we'll be able to work on this program with
the heads of SCIRE and ARLO."

Milton's points: "We're not stopping SCIRE or
ARLO, we're continuing a very valuable program
begun by them. What we've done is taken a collec
tion of programs and projects and combined them
in the center — a real step toward having a Public
Service Center. Catherine (Milton) is really good at
taking students who want to work in public service
and giving them the opportunity to do it. If the sup
port structure there, if there's a place you can go,
that's really helpful. That's what this place could
become — it could be fantastic."
Also at issue is the question of the
jobs of the current program leaders of both ARLO
and SCIRE. While Milton stated that those jobs
would be terminated, Vonderlippe added: "We're
hoping we'll be able to work on this program with
the heads of SCIRE and ARLO."
In response to questions from leaders of two
recently terminated extradepartmental programs
here, Catherine Milton, special assistant to Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy and director of the
new Public Service Center, says the functions and
objectives of ARLO and SCIRE will continue to be
addressed by the University.
The Public Service Center at Owen House
already houses Stanford-in-Government, Stanford
Volunteer Network, Stanford Students Making A
Difference and the Summer Public Service Fellow
ship. With the decision to streamline the inter
departmental programs of UGS and URO, the
scope of the center is expanding.
According to Marty Fung, student co-chairman
of ARLO, the future prospects of his program are
uncertain if it relocates to Owen House. There is
"confusion as to what is to become of ARLO.
They've told us we're to be incorporated into the
Public Service Center. That wouldn't be so bad if
they kept ARLO functions alive. "
Currently, the Action Research Liaison Office
(ARLO) provides credit to students who conduct
research, under the supervision of faculty mem
bers, in local non-profit organizations and
governmental agencies.
According to Fung, "The Public Service Center
doesn't have any plans for ARLO after it becomes
incorporated. The faculty, students, and commu
nity groups have all lauded ARLO. We don't un
derstand why they want to stop something that's
working fine. They keep telling us, 'Don't worry

about it,' but they haven't given us anything con
crete as to the maintenance of the ARLO series."
"In letters, they say ARLO will cease to exist;
publicly, they say it will exist. That's where the am
biguity comes into play," he said.
"The main thing we're fighting for is not the
name ARLO but the function and what it stands
for. If we can get that to carry over, that's what we
need: for it to be maintained in its current form."
With regard to ARLO, Milton said that credit
would be made available in much the same manner
as was previously arranged through that organiza
tion: "The student will have a faculty member as a
sponsor, and credit will then be available through
the department. The details need to be worked out,
but it will be run similarly to the way ARLO credit
is granted now."
Judy Adams, co-director of the Student Center
for Innovation in Research and Education
(SCIRE), voices sentiments similar to those of the
ARLO directors: "I have no idea what the specific
plans will be. All I know is, SCIRE is to be taken
over June 15."
According to Adams, the function of SCIRE is
twofold: first, to provide credit for ex
tradepartmental internships and interdisciplinary
work, and, second, to coordinate the Clearinghouse
Catalog of intern and research opportunities.
Adams points out that, while the Public Service
Center has made it clear to SCIRE that the catalog
will be continued, it remains unclear as to what will
become of SCIRE's main purpose: "Academic func
tions have been dropped without any specification
of how they will be continued. [Assoc. Dean of

Humanities and Sciences Carolyn LougeeJ is
working on setting up options, but we don't know
specifically what she's done. What's up in the air is
the question of credit and how non-clearinghouse
functions will he continued. We're hoping that we
can have a role in the transfer."
With respect to the SCIRE program, Milton said,
"The clearinghouse will be done by CPPC. The
plan is to have this all accessible by computers, and
it will probably also be printed up."
Milton said that ARLO and SCIRE were not
ending because of failure. She said the programs
were consolidated to make them more accessible
for the community.
Sarah Vonderlippe, co-coordinator of the up
coming conference on world hunger, a program af
filiated with the Public Service Center, reiterated
Milton's points: "We're not stopping SCIRE or
