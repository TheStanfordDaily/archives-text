## Int'l co-op may join full Draw 
### JOHN SELLERS 
Hammarskjold House, the only
campus residence filled through an
independent spring lottery, may
join the regular Draw next year, ac
cording to Rodger Whitney, associ
ate dean of students and housing
director.
Hammarskjold operates as a co
op with an international theme and
conducts its own draw. House resi
dents are chosen prior to the
regular Draw through a system of
self-selection.
Whitney expressed fears that the
current system of choosing residents
involves too much subjectivity. He
said the University considered put
ting Hammarskjold in the regular
Draw this year, but after consulting
with the Committee on Services to
Students, Residences (COSS-R),
the decision was delayed for a year.
Last week, residents of Ham
marskjold were informed of the
University's decision to wait until
next year for the house to enter the
regular Draw. To the expressed
relief of many residents the house
will retain its current status through
the next academic year.
One eating associate at the house
said Hammarskjold needs residents

who "want to contribute to the in
ternational theme of the house."
Putting Hammarskjold in the regu
lar Draw might result in bringing in
residents who "are not as 'gung ho'
on both the cooperative and inter
national themes of the house."

The reason for the possible
change in Hammarskjold's draw
was the concern that not enough
people know about the special
draw, according to one resident.
Saying that the current selection
process is rather subjective, she said

most of Hammarskjold's residents
come from Europe and the house
needs more students from other
parts of the world. She held,
however, that "putting Ham
marskjold into the regular Draw is
not the answer."

The independent draw system for Hammarskjold house, plagued by questions of subjective selectivity and
inefficiency, may come to an end next year.
