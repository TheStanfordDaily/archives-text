# Law applications reflect national trend
## But officials say they're not worried 
### ROB REID 
Applications at Stanford Law
School are currently running 14 per
cent behind last year's figures, ac
cording to Dora Hjertberg, director
of admissions at the law school. Al
though applications have reached the
lowest level since the 19705, faculty
members and administrators aren't
anticipating a similar drop in the
quality of the student body.
Ronald Gilson, acting chairman of
the admissions board and a professor
of law, said he is "delighted with the
progress the school has made in com
peting for the best students," and, al
though the gross number of ap
plicatons is falling, the number of su
perior applicants is rising.
John Ely, dean of the law school,
said, "We're still going to get the best
law students in the country, so we'll
be the last ones to worry" about the
decreasing number of applicants.
Gilson said he does not anticipate a
large-scale recruitment operation to
reverse the trend. "I would be
surprised if the school did anything to
try to compete for students with other
professional schools — to try to per
suade anybody that it would be better
to be a lawyer than to be a business
school graduate or a doctor."
The drop in applications at the law
school here is part of a nationwide

trend. Harvard also reports a 14 per-;
cent drop in law applications, and;
Yale and the University of Chicago;
show significant declines as well.
Ely said the drop in applications'
will not pose a major problem for!
Stanford. ''We're not concerned!
about it, although . . . some of the less-;
selective law schools may be worrying;
about filling their classes."
Professors at the school say they
see several factors which may have
caused the drop in applicants.!
Thomas Campbell, acting associate!
professor of law, said he suspects the;
trend is "responsive to signals from;
the market."
Campbell said, "Whereas the
top graduates are still receiving large*
numbers of offers, it is more difficult,
to place all law school graduates." !
Gilson said that for a long time'
there was a backlog of people wank
ing to attend law school. Many-tit"
these people were looking for mid?
level career changes. The backlog of
applicants has since dissipated, and a«j
a result applications have declined.
Ely said he believes law school ap
plications have peaked, and the
downward trend will probably last a
few years. The number of
peaked here in 1982 when 4,329j#j£i
plicants competed for approximately
170 positions.
