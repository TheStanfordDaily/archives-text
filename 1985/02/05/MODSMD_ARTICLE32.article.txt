Attention all staffers: Briefly is
now crashing with great regularity.
To prevent disaster, please "read - '
your briefly every few minutes. And
then we'll all be happy.
Shortboard: Edit board this even
ing at 6 sharp. We will discuss our
needs for mayonnaise and mustard.
Staph lunch: At the Dairy Shak
Wednesday at noon. Tim will preside.
All should attend.
The real edit bored: Friday at noon.
It will be so good to see you.
Fleart beats: And it will be so good
to see all of the beat reporters this
week. Do stop in to chat sometime
with the man from S.D. today or the
other guy tomorrow. That means all
of you â€” Lynn, Todd, Steve, David,
Brian and Dave (teleconferencing
fine this time only).

Baboon droppings: All of us here at
The Daily wish Baie and Dave, our
two vacationing senior staff writers,
the best vacations of their lives. Be
crazy you two: You're still young.
Who has a name long enough for
two mailboxes, a nickname short
enough for half of one and words to
fill them all?
Is Jeff still living in a London fog?
Will Mary ever eat a Za?
Will Bob learn to dance tonight?
Is Julie's alarm going off?
Did Clay get a good story last
night?
Was Heather no where to be
found?
If Geoff had been here, would we
have fired up some Zaskies?
The answers to these and other im
portant questions are to be found in
the top bins of the news and features
desks. Or not.
