# ASSU launches in-house probe
## Seeks Coffee House informant 
### CLINT HIGHFILL Editorial staff 
An ASSU investigation is under
way to determine the identity of those
persons responsible for releasing to
The Daily confidential background
documents regarding the finances of
the Coffee House, according to B.G.
Porter, head of a special committee
appointed by Senate Chair Eric Berg
to try to find the source of the leak.
Tonight the committee will inter
view six people during a "fact-finding
meeting," said Porter, who also
serves as deputy chair of the senate.
"We're not accusing anyone .... We
just want to find out the facts," he
said.
The investigation follows a letter
Berg issued to senators Friday. In the
letter, Berg said he suspects "that one
or more of the members of the sen
ate" were responsible for leaking the
information, and said if those
senators involved had not resigned by
"the beginning of this week," he
would appoint the committee.
If "it is possible to assign responsi
bility ... I will then ask the Adminis
tration and Rules Committee to rec
ommend appropriate action to the
senate," he wrote.
Porter said he doesn't know what
chance the committee has of tracking
down the origin of the leak, but
Berg's letter was more optimistic.
"I should indicate that there is
already a good deal of information to
indicate the identity of the person(s)
responsible," he wrote.
Berg wrote that the alleged action
of any senators involved would con
stitute "a gross breach of the trust
placed in them by their colleagues in
the senate."
"I'm really hoping we're not going
to wind up expelling anyone from the
senate," said Porter, but he added
that Berg has strong feelings on the
issue.
Porter said he doesn't know if the
"appropriate action" suggested by
Berg includes expelling members
from the senate, but said Berg "feels
very strongly about this. He doesn't
feel a senator who has done this can
'be trusted to work well with his col
leagues."
Berg would not comment on any
aspects of the investigation when con
tacted yesterday.
Another concern voiced by Berg in
the letter was that publication of
"certain of the background informa
tion" could reduce the ASSU's
chances of winning the bid for a new
lease contract from Tresidder Union
and could "convince Tresidder that
the ASSU is incapable of acting in a

business-like fashion and should not
be awarded the contract, no matter
what we bid."
The Coffee House's current con
tract expires Aug. 31, and the ASSU
must submit a bid for the next five
year contract in May.
The ASSU's main worry was that
the percentage of gross sales paid to
Tresidder for rent would be revealed
to other contractors bidding for the
Coffee House rent contract and
would provide those competitors with
an advantage in the bidding process.

Head of investigative committee
However, when asked if he thinks
too much information has been pub
lished, Porter said "I don't think so."
"We're concerned about the prin
ciples involved," he said.
Nanci Howe, assistant director of
Tresidder, said she does not feel the
release of the documents would affect
the Tresidder management when it
decided who to award the contract to.
"The important thing will be the
quality of the bid that's presented and
the contractor's past experience," she
said. The ASSU "would be coming
into this operation stronger than last
time" in terms of experience, she
added.
Having the article in the paper was
unfortunate only because it "makes it
more difficult for the ASSU to put to
gether a new bid," she said.
Berg also expressed concern that
the leak would cause the council of
presidents and the financial manager
to unilaterally decide matters involv
ing confidential information about
ASSU operations.
Porter said one purpose of his in
vestigation is to prevent this.
"For most senators, this will be an
eye-opener," he said. Senators will
"hopefully learn a lesson."
Members of the investigative com
mittee will be Senators Yvonne
Campos and Jim DeLaHunt.

too much information has been pub
lished, Porter said "I don't think so."
"We're concerned about the prin
ciples involved," he said.
Nanci Howe, assistant director of
Tresidder, said she does not feel the
release of the documents would affect
the Tresidder management when it
decided who to award the contract to.
"The important thing will be the
quality of the bid that's presented and
the contractor's past experience," she
said. The ASSU "would be coming
into this operation stronger than last
time" in terms of experience, she
added.
Having the article in the paper was
unfortunate only because it "makes it
more difficult for the ASSU to put to
gether a new bid," she said.
Berg also expressed concern that
the leak would cause the council of
presidents and the financial manager
to unilaterally decide matters involv
ing confidential information about
ASSU operations.
Porter said one purpose of his in
vestigation is to prevent this.
"For most senators, this will be an
eye-opener," he said. Senators will
"hopefully learn a lesson."
Members of the investigative com
mittee will be Senators Yvonne
Campos and Jim DeLaHunt.
