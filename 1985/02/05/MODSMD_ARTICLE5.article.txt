# Current five explain all to hopefuls
## Dollies: not as easy as it looks 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
More than 50 would-be Dollies listened attentively
last night at Branner Hall as current members of the
group told what it takes to become one of perhaps the
five most recognizable faces at Stanford.
"Dollies is an exciting thing," sophomore Monica
Lytic told the group. Being a Dollie "should be one of
your first priorities," added another Dollie, sopho
more Ellen Rosenthal.
Rosenthal said experience as a dancer is not essen
tial for becoming a Dollie, adding that "what is more
important is your personality." She said there is "a dif
ferent choreography, a certain Dollie style" that
separates the group from most cheerleaders at other
universities.
It was this mystique which seemed to appeal to a
number of the women at the meeting. "It sounds like a
lot of fun," said freshman Jackie Bilodeau, a cheer
leader for six years who choreographed her high
school's cheerleading routines during her senior year.
Bilodeau said she did not view performing as a
Dollie as something which promotes sexist values.
"They seem to get a great deal of respect and
everybody watches when they perform," she said.
Freshman Jodie Martinson echoed Bilodeau s senti
ments, stating that being a Dollie is "a good way to
show your spirit. People really support the Dollies.
Although Rosenthal said being a Dollie is a great

deal of fun, she stressed the sizable time commitment
members of the group must make. The Dollies must
arrive at Stanford Aug. 1 from summer vacation and
spend the next two months practicing for up to six
hours each day, she said.
During that period, each girl lives with "a Dollie
family," Rosenthal said, adding that a strong sense of
camaraderie between the Dollies develops during this
time.
Football season requires "the most time commit
ment," she said, advising hopeful women to take a
heavier class load during the spring to compensate for
the time spent away from academics in the fall.
Practices occur less often during basketball season as
performance time increases, Rosenthal said.
Dollies, selected by the Band, receive two units of
credit each quarter.
"The Dollies are part of the Band," Lytic said, add
ing that the golden rule for the group is that "the music
comes first, the dancing comes later." The Band selects
the music, she said, and the Dollies choreograph
routines over spring break in preparation for their first
appearance at Splendor on the Grass in May.
"As a Dollie you have to be there for everything."
Lytle said, adding that the Dollies are expected to
rehearse with the Band each Wednesday, Friday and
Saturday morning during the week before a football

game.
Acknowledging the Band's reputa
tion for sometimes extravagant be
havior, Lytle called the group "a lot
of fun." Sophomore Kelly Colbert,
another Dollie, added that while the
Band's reputation might be intimidat
ing to young women during the
tryouts, "You don't have to be a
massive partier" to be chosen.
Kathy Lowe, another sophomore
Dollie, said all expenses for the
Dollies are taken care of by the Band
and sponsors such as Adidas. She said
Adidas provides the Dollies with five
pairs of shoes, two pairs of sweats,
and other accessories.
The group operates on a tight
budget which provides for three sepa
rate outfits, usually white dresses
during the snrine and winter and a

red outfit for the football season.
Brenda Branin, a junior who tried
out for the Dollies as a freshman and
was cut before finally making it last
spring as a sophomore, said the cur
rent members have no say in the selec
tion of the future group. She encour
aged the aspiring women to ask them
questions during the six upcoming
practices in which the women are
asked to rehearse two standard
routines and create one of their own.
First cuts for the Dollies are Feb.
28, with the final tryouts set for
March 2.
After the field is narrowed through
the first cuts, the remaining partici
pants audition in front of the Band.
Ten of those go on to a party in the
Band Shak, where they are inter
viewed by "Band Staph" members.
The final five are chosen that night,
and are awakened early the next
morning for the traditional ice cream
celebration.

Rosenthal said experience as a dancer is not essen
tial for becoming a Dollie, adding that "what is more
important is your personality." She said there is "a dif
ferent choreography, a certain Dollie style" that
separates the group from most cheerleaders at other
universities.
It was this mystique which seemed to appeal to a
number of the women at the meeting. "It sounds like a
lot of fun," said freshman Jackie Bilodeau, a cheer
leader for six years who choreographed her high
school's cheerleading routines during her senior year.
Bilodeau said she did not view performing as a
Dollie as something which promotes sexist values.
"They seem to get a great deal of respect and
everybody watches when they perform," she said.
Freshman Jodie Martinson echoed Bilodeau s senti
ments, stating that being a Dollie is "a good way to
show your spirit. People really support the Dollies.
Although Rosenthal said being a Dollie is a great

deal of fun, she stressed the sizable time commitment
members of the group must make. The Dollies must
arrive at Stanford Aug. 1 from summer vacation and
spend the next two months practicing for up to six
hours each day, she said.
During that period, each girl lives with "a Dollie
family," Rosenthal said, adding that a strong sense of
camaraderie between the Dollies develops during this
time.
Football season requires "the most time commit
ment," she said, advising hopeful women to take a
heavier class load during the spring to compensate for
the time spent away from academics in the fall.
Practices occur less often during basketball season as
performance time increases, Rosenthal said.
Dollies, selected by the Band, receive two units of
credit each quarter.
"The Dollies are part of the Band," Lytic said, add
ing that the golden rule for the group is that "the music
comes first, the dancing comes later." The Band selects
the music, she said, and the Dollies choreograph
routines over spring break in preparation for their first
appearance at Splendor on the Grass in May.
"As a Dollie you have to be there for everything."
Lytle said, adding that the Dollies are expected to
rehearse with the Band each Wednesday, Friday and
Saturday morning during the week before a football

game.
Acknowledging the Band's reputa
tion for sometimes extravagant be
havior, Lytle called the group "a lot
of fun." Sophomore Kelly Colbert,
another Dollie, added that while the
Band's reputation might be intimidat
ing to young women during the
tryouts, "You don't have to be a
massive partier" to be chosen.
Kathy Lowe, another sophomore
Dollie, said all expenses for the
Dollies are taken care of by the Band
and sponsors such as Adidas. She said
Adidas provides the Dollies with five
pairs of shoes, two pairs of sweats,
and other accessories.
The group operates on a tight
budget which provides for three sepa
rate outfits, usually white dresses
during the snrine and winter and a

red outfit for the football season.
Brenda Branin, a junior who tried
out for the Dollies as a freshman and
was cut before finally making it last
spring as a sophomore, said the cur

aged the aspiring women to ask them
questions during the six upcoming
practices in which the women are
asked to rehearse two standard
routines and create one of their own.
First cuts for the Dollies are Feb.
28, with the final tryouts set for
March 2.
After the field is narrowed through
the first cuts, the remaining partici
pants audition in front of the Band.
Ten of those go on to a party in the
Band Shak, where they are inter
viewed by "Band Staph" members.
The final five are chosen that night,
and are awakened early the next
morning for the traditional ice cream
celebration.
