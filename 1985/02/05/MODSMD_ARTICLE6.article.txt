Israeli soldier killed in West Bank
RAM ALLAH, Occupied West Bank — An Israeli soldier was shot to
death at close range yesterday while he was on guard duty in this Arab
town, an Israeli military spokesman said. It was the latest incident in a
two-week wave of violence that has swept the occupied West Bank of
the Jordan River.
The spokesman's announcement said the military imposed a curfew
on Ramallah, 10 miles north of Jerusalem, and the nearby al-Amari
refugee camp while they seached for the attacker. The curfew was lifted
six hours later, at 7 p.m., the spokesman said.
Troops also blocked the road to the Dheishe refugee camp after a
rabbi walked inside and fired shots into the air. Rabbi Moshe Levinger
said he did it because Palestinian youths threw stones at him as he waited
for some Parliament members who planned to demonstrate at the camp
about six miles south of Jerusalem.
Levinger has camped across the road from Dheishe for more than
three months to protest what he sees as weak Israeli response to Pales
tinian attacks.
The military spokesman identified »he dead soldier as Cpl. Aharon
Avidar, 29, from Ness Ziona, south of Tel Aviv. Military sources said he
was shot in the head with a small pistol as he opened a gate of a building
used by the military government, and that his attacker was believed to be
an Arab.
Avidar was the second Israeli killed in the latest outburst of attacks in
the West Bank, which has raised tensions between Palestinians and
Jewish settlers.
It was believed to be the first assassination-style killing of an on-duty
soldier since Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967
Arab-Israeli war. Most previous deaths have occurred duringclashes be
tween soldiers and demonstrators.
Guerrillas sabotage Pope's arrival
LIMA, Peru — Guerrilla saboteurs blacked out the runway lights at
Lima's airport yesterday night as Pope John Paul Il's twin-engined jet
arrived, but the plane landed safely, police and control tower officials re
ported.
They said the pontiff entered a limousine sent by President Fernando
Belaunde Terry and was driven to the papal ambassador's residence to
spend the night.
The runway lights went out at 8:45 p.m. — 10:45 p.m. PST — but the
tower officials said power was restored almost immediately by the auto
matic generating system.
About 30 minutes later, Lima was blacked out and utility officials
blamed guerrillas of the Maoist Shining Path movement. Then, two huge
hammer-and-sickle Shining Path symbols were set ablaze on moun
tainsides north of Lima.
The actions apparently signaled the Shining Path's rejection of John
Paul's appeal Sunday for an end to the violence that has claimed at least
4,000 lives since the guerrillas began their anti-government war four
years ago.
The airport blackout occurred as the pope — on the tenth day ot his
12-day tour of South America and Trinidad-Tobago — was returning
from the fishing city of Trujillo, 350 miles north of Lima.
The pope ends his his sixth trip to Latin America and 25th abroad
when he goes to Trinidad-Tobago today.
Soviets: U.S. complicating talks
MOSCOW — The official Tass news agency said yesterday the
Reagan administration's proposed military budget heralds a weapons
buildup that will complicate U.S.-Soviet arms talks scheduled to open
next month in Geneva.
It carried three separate articles critical of the U.S. budget for fiscal
1986, including an attack on Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger.
Tass said his report outlining U.S. military spending shows he is intent
on establishing superiority over the Soviets.
Tass analyst Vladimir Bogachyov wrote that remarks by Max Kampel
man, who will head the U.S. delegation at the Geneva talks, indicate he
believes that in the nuclear age, stability can be ensured by building U.S.
potential rather than limiting weapons.
The proposed Defense Department budget reflects this philosophy,
Bogachyov said. He cited increases for developing space-based defense
systems, known as the "Star Wars" plan, and anti-satellite systems as ex
amples, and said the next anti-satellite test is due about the time the
Geneva talks start March 12.
Bogachyov said other budget increases would be for intercontinental
missiles, submarine-based missiles and B-l long-range bombers.
"The new U.S. military budget, if it is approved in its present form,
will only put into operation the 'action-counteraction' chain in the vi
cious circle of the arms race and create new difficulties in the way of
resolution of the problems that are on the agenda of the forthcoming
Geneva negotiations," he said.
In its article on Weinberger's report on U.S. weapons needs, Tass said
he used "the cliche reference to a mythical Soviet military threat" to jus
tify more arms spending.
Trial starts amid tight security
NAPLES, Italy — The trial of 251 suspected Camorra gang members
and their alleged accomplices — including a nun and a priest — began
yesterday with police sharpshooters on guard and the defendants incar
cerated in 20 cages in the courtroom.
Extraordinary security measures were in effect in and around Naples'
Poggioreale Prison, where a windowless courtroom was built for the
trial, which court officials called Italy's largest criminal proceeding ever.
Bomb-detecting dogs patroled inner hallways and police
sharpshooters were posted on rooftops of buildings ringing the prison.
Helicopters hovered over the area and lawyers and reporters were
searched at the prison's gate.
To protect admitted mobsters turned police informers, authorities
beefed up prison security with an additional 800-man force. Two of the
20 courtroom cages were reserved for the gangsters who turned state's
evidence, known as "pentiti."
Yesterday's court session, dubbed "the trial of the century" by
Neapolitan newspapers, is the first of three for 640 suspects arrested in
the June 17, 1983, crackdown on the Nuova Camorra Organizzata.
All defendants are charged with criminal association, a catch-all
charge used to prosecute suspected gangsters. Some are also charged
with drug trafficking and extortion, and some could be sentenced to life
in prison if convicted.
U.S. responds to New Zealand
WASHINGTON — The Reagan administration reacted sharply yes
terday to the New Zealand government's second refusal to permit a U.S.
warship to visit New Zealand, and the prime minister of Australia
predicted that the incident would lead to the cancellation of upcoming
naval maneuvers in the South Pacific.
Hinting at U.S. reprisals. State Department spokesman Bernard Kalb
said "we deeply regret" the denial of access for the destroyer Buchanan,
which was scheduled to take part in the naval exercises off Australia next
month. And Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger called the action
"a serious attack" upon the ANZUS alliance that has existed since
World War II between the United States, Australia and New Zealand.
"At the momemt they arc only following a course which can be of
great harm to themselves." Weinberger said in an appearance before the
Senate Armed Services Committee.
New Zealand Prime Minister David Lange has vowed to prohibit
nuclear-armed vessels to dock at his nation's ports and last week turned
down an initial hid by the United States to let the destroyer make a port
call. Kalb asserted yesterday that the ship was "conventionally
powered" but followed longstanding U.S. policy in refusing to say
whether it carried nuclear weapons.
The dispute threatened to divide the three-nation alliance, and
Australian Prime Minister Robert Hawke said in Brussels late yesterday
that the allies' planned "Sea Eagle" naval exercises, scheduled for
March, were about to be canceled.
