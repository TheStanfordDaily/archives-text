# Democrats, Republicans both wary
## Trouble on the Hill for budget plan 
### 
WASHINGTON — President
Reagan's fiscal 1986 budget got off to
a faltering start in Congress yesterday
as Democrats pounced on proposals
to cut programs for middle-class
voters and Republicans offered little
more than lukewarm support for the
plan as a whole.
However, prospects for quick de
velopment of a congressional alterna
tive to the president's plan appeared
shaky.
The Democrats seized on the presi
dent's proposals for cuts in middle
class programs, such as student loans,
farm supports and veterans benefits.
"T urge the president to take the
time to educate the country on his
various budget proposals and to tell
people how they will be affected,"
said House Speaker Thomas "Tip"
O'Neill, Jr. (D-Mass.). Starting this
weekend, the House Budget Com
mittee plans to hold a series of
regional hearings around the country
to "aid in this education effort."
Meanwhile, Senate Majority
Leader Robert Dole (R-Kan.), who
said a month ago that Senate
Republicans would have an alterna

tive plan for deficit reductions by
Feb. 1, indicated yesterday that the
Senate Budget Committee would
take over the job of drafting the plan,
which is expected to take five or six
weeks.
While there is strong sentiment in
the Senate's GOP majority for sub
stantial deficit reductions, the
senators have been unable to agree
on specific domestic-spending cuts or
on how extensively to cut the admin
istration's military buildup.
Despite the criticism of Reagan's
budget, which for the fifth year in a
row proposes massive shifts of money
from domestic to defense programs,
there was general agreement that he
will get at least some of the domestic
spending cuts he seeks and possibly
half of the defense growth he re
quested.
But the clear message was that the
first budget of Reagan's second term
did not land on the greased skids that
four years ago awaited the first
budget of his first term.
Not only was there a chilly reaction
from many lawmakers, but powerful

constituencies for many of the
threatened programs, including cities
faced with the loss of revenue
sharing, lost no time in marshaling for
a fight.
" It's going to be very difficult to do
many of the things the president sets
forth in his budget," Dole said.
Among Democrats, including some
who have been among the staunchest
critics of previous Reagan budgets,
there was no rush to proclaim this
budget to be "dead on arrival," as
there was in the last couple of years.
The congressional jockeying for
position on the budget came as
Reagan and his budget director,
David Stockman, stepped up their
rhetorical pressure for enactment of
its key provisions.
"We can't wait a moment longer to
get our federal budget under con
trol," said Reagan at a White House
briefing for congressional leaders. "If
we lose the budget battle," he added,
"if we allow all the lessons of all the
decades of unchecked government
spending to go unheeded, we consign
ourselves and our children to the
tyranny of a government that respects

no boundaries and knows no limits."
He held out a hint of compromise,
which Senate Republicans have said
is essential to passage of deficit
reductions sufficient to meet their
goal of cutting deficits by half to $100
billion a year in three years, a goal
once shared by the White House but
abandoned in the budget submitted
yesterday. But the president
defended his defense buildup and
refusal to consider tax increases.
Congressional criticism of
Reagan's budget proposal appeared
to come without regard to geographi
cal, political or philosophical lines, al
though the intensity appeared to be
higher among Democrats, liberals
and lawmakers from the Northeast
and industrial Midwest.
While most Senate Republicans
remained quiet after weeks of
dominating the budget debate. Sen
ate Democrats suddenly found their
voices.
Reagan's continued effort to
reduce education spending came in

both from within Congress and from
