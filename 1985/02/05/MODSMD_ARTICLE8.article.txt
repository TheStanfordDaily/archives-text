Military aid increased
WASHINGTON — The Reagan administra
tion yesterday unveiled a foreign-aid budget that
calls for increasing military assistance to
Guatemala from $300,000 to $35.3 Trillion
despite severe criticism of its human-rights
record.
That part of the $14.77 billion overall request
for fiscal 1986 is relatively small in comparison
with packages being proposed for such tradi
tional U.S. allies as Israel, Egypt, Pakistan and
the Philippines.
But in comparative terms, the jump is so large
that it seems certain to trigger new charges from
congressional critics that the administration is
seeking to resolve Central America's conflicts by
emphasizing military solutions.
The administration also requested $483.4 mil
lion in economic and military aid packages to
help El Salvador combat leftist guerrilla oppo
nents and $231 million for Honduras, where the
administration has been trying to strengthen the
armed forces to help counter the leftist Sandi
nista government in neighboring Nicaragua.
Guatemala received U.S. economic aid for the
last two years but, except for $300,000 this year
for training, has had no U.S. military assistance
sir.ce 1977 because of its poor human-rights
record.
However, administration officials said they
believe that the request for an additional $35
million in support funds and credits to buy U.S.
weapons is justified because the Guatemalan mil
itary regime has promised elections that could
produce a civilian government by Oct. 1.
World Bank pullout?
WASHINGTON — The Reagan administra
tion yesterday served notice on the world
Bank that it may end its support of the bank's
subsidized Third World aid program after the
present U.S. commitment expires in two years.
In his budget message to Congress for fiscal
1986, President Reagan said the administration
"intends to honor existing commitments" to the
International Development Association, as well
as to the Asian Development Fund and the
African Development Fund.
Reagan addeo, however, that, "In light of the

current severe fiscal pressures, the administration
is not budgeting at this time for the future
replenishments of these particular institutions."
The bank's concessional program is carried on
through the International Development Associa
tion, an affiliate that the United States helped to
launch in 1961.
Despite the inclusion of the phrase "at this
time," World Bank officials yesterday took a
sober view of prospects in view of the general at
titude of the Reagan administration over the past
four years.
"We take this seriously," said Senior Vice
President Moeen Qureshi in an interview.
"Signals by the United States have a tremendous
impact on other countries, which understand that
IDA is a burden-sharing program."
Reagan defends buildup
WASHINGTON — President Reagan
asserted twice yesterday that U.S. arms spending
is sanctioned by scripture and said defense
budget cuts would weaken the nation in the face
of the "unprecedented military buildup of the
Soviet Union."
"You might be interested to know that the
scriptures are on our side in this," Reagan told a
group of business and trade representatives in the
White House. "Luke 14:31, in which Jesus in
talking to the disciples, spoke about a King who
might be contemplating going to war against an
other king with his 10,000 men, but he sits down
and counsels how good he's going to do against
the other fellow's 20,000 and then says he may
have to send a delegation to talk peace terms."
"Well, I don't think we ever want to be in a po
sition of only being half as strong and having to
send a delegation to negotiate under those cir
cumstances — peace terms — with the Soviet
Union," Reagan continued.
Later in the day he cited the biblical passage
again in a speech to the National Religious
Broadcasters Conference meeting at the
Sheraton Washington hotel.
"I don't think the Lord that blessed this
country as no other country has ever been
blessed intends for us to someday negotiate be
cause of our weakness," the president said.
"Ultimately, our security and our hopes for

success at the arms-reduction talks hinge on the
determination that we show here to continue our
program to rebuild and refortify our defenses,"
the president said.
He also made a more traditional argument in
this speech and another to new members of
Congress, saying that "the defense of our nation
is the one budget item which cannot be dictated
solely by domestic considerations."
Soviet reveals CIA ties
WASHINGTON — Arkady Shevchenko, the
highest-ranking Soviet diplomat to defect to the
United States since World War 11, was a spy for
the CIA for two-and-a-half years before seeking
asylum in this country in 1978, according to ex
cerpts published yesterday of his book revealing
his clandestine life.
Shevchenko, a former top adviser to Soviet
Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko and
undersecretary-general of the United Nations at
the time of his defection, said in the book that he
reluctantly agreed to spy for the Americans only
after becoming disenchanted with the Soviet sys
tem.
The book, entitled "Breaking With Moscow,"
discloses no major espionage coups resulting
from Shevchenko's period of espionage for the
United States from the fall of 1975 until April
1978. But he said he provided U.S. intelligence
officials with revealing glimpses into the Soviet
hierarchy, which he describes as riddled by in
tense personal rivalries and bureaucratic infight
ing.
Market climbs sharply
NEW YORK — The stock market posted a
broad gain yesterday, playing an encore to its
dramatic January rally.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials,
down more than three points in early trading, was
up 12.36 at 1,290.08 by the close.
That left the average about 2 points below the
record close of 1,292.62 it reached last Tuesday.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange
surpassed 100 million shares for the 18th con

1986, President Reagan said the administration
"intends to honor existing commitments" to the
International Development Association, as well
as to the Asian Development Fund and the
African Development Fund.
Reagan addeo, however, that, "In light of the

current severe fiscal pressures, the administration
is not budgeting at this time for the future
replenishments of these particular institutions."
The bank's concessional program is carried on
through the International Development Associa

launch in 1961.
Despite the inclusion of the phrase "at this

sober view of prospects in view of the general at
titude of the Reagan administration over the past
four years.
"We take this seriously," said Senior Vice
President Moeen Qureshi in an interview.
"Signals by the United States have a tremendous
impact on other countries, which understand that
IDA is a burden-sharing program."
Reagan defends buildup
WASHINGTON — President Reagan
asserted twice yesterday that U.S. arms spending
is sanctioned by scripture and said defense
budget cuts would weaken the nation in the face
of the "unprecedented military buildup of the
Soviet Union."
"You might be interested to know that the
scriptures are on our side in this," Reagan told a
group of business and trade representatives in the
White House. "Luke 14:31, in which Jesus in
talking to the disciples, spoke about a King who
might be contemplating going to war against an
other king with his 10,000 men, but he sits down
and counsels how good he's going to do against
the other fellow's 20,000 and then says he may
have to send a delegation to talk peace terms."
"Well, I don't think we ever want to be in a po
sition of only being half as strong and having to
send a delegation to negotiate under those cir
cumstances — peace terms — with the Soviet
Union," Reagan continued.
Later in the day he cited the biblical passage
again in a speech to the National Religious
Broadcasters Conference meeting at the
Sheraton Washington hotel.
"I don't think the Lord that blessed this
country as no other country has ever been
blessed intends for us to someday negotiate be
cause of our weakness," the president said.
"Ultimately, our security and our hopes for

success at the arms-reduction talks hinge on the
determination that we show here to continue our
program to rebuild and refortify our defenses,"
the president said.
He also made a more traditional argument in
this speech and another to new members of
Congress, saying that "the defense of our nation
is the one budget item which cannot be dictated
solely by domestic considerations."
Soviet reveals CIA ties
WASHINGTON — Arkady Shevchenko, the
highest-ranking Soviet diplomat to defect to the
United States since World War 11, was a spy for
the CIA for two-and-a-half years before seeking
asylum in this country in 1978, according to ex
cerpts published yesterday of his book revealing
his clandestine life.
Shevchenko, a former top adviser to Soviet
Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko and
undersecretary-general of the United Nations at
the time of his defection, said in the book that he
reluctantly agreed to spy for the Americans only
after becoming disenchanted with the Soviet sys
tem.
The book, entitled "Breaking With Moscow,"
discloses no major espionage coups resulting
from Shevchenko's period of espionage for the
United States from the fall of 1975 until April
1978. But he said he provided U.S. intelligence
officials with revealing glimpses into the Soviet
hierarchy, which he describes as riddled by in
tense personal rivalries and bureaucratic infight
ing.
Market climbs sharply
NEW YORK — The stock market posted a
broad gain yesterday, playing an encore to its
dramatic January rally.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials,
down more than three points in early trading, was
up 12.36 at 1,290.08 by the close.
That left the average about 2 points below the
record close of 1,292.62 it reached last Tuesday.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange
surpassed 100 million shares for the 18th con
secutive session, totaling 113.72 million against
Friday's 105.44 million.
Military aid increased
WASHINGTON — The Reagan administra
tion yesterday unveiled a foreign-aid budget that
calls for increasing military assistance to
Guatemala from $300,000 to $35.3 Trillion
despite severe criticism of its human-rights
record.
That part of the $14.77 billion overall request
for fiscal 1986 is relatively small in comparison
with packages being proposed for such tradi
tional U.S. allies as Israel, Egypt, Pakistan and
the Philippines.
But in comparative terms, the jump is so large
that it seems certain to trigger new charges from
congressional critics that the administration is
seeking to resolve Central America's conflicts by
emphasizing military solutions.
The administration also requested $483.4 mil
lion in economic and military aid packages to
help El Salvador combat leftist guerrilla oppo
nents and $231 million for Honduras, where the
administration has been trying to strengthen the
armed forces to help counter the leftist Sandi
nista government in neighboring Nicaragua.
Guatemala received U.S. economic aid for the
last two years but, except for $300,000 this year
for training, has had no U.S. military assistance
sir.ce 1977 because of its poor human-rights
record.
However, administration officials said they
believe that the request for an additional $35
million in support funds and credits to buy U.S.
weapons is justified because the Guatemalan mil
itary regime has promised elections that could
produce a civilian government by Oct. 1.
World Bank pullout?
WASHINGTON — The Reagan administra
tion yesterday served notice on the world
Bank that it may end its support of the bank's
subsidized Third World aid program after the
present U.S. commitment expires in two years.
In his budget message to Congress for fiscal
1986, President Reagan said the administration
"intends to honor existing commitments" to the
International Development Association, as well
as to the Asian Development Fund and the
African Development Fund.
