Test scores, grades drop
SACRAMENTO — Educators say falling
grade-point averages and lower entrance-test
scores are leaving significantly fewer California
students eligible for college today than seven
years ago.
A survey of the 1983 high school graduating
classes shows that since 1976 the proportion of
seniors meeting admission standards at the Uni
versity of California has decreased 11 percent,
and the proportion eligible for state universities
fell nearly 17 percent.
That survey is part of a California Postsecon
dary Education Commission study, which also re
ported grade-point averages have declined from
2.76 to 2.62. Scholastic aptitude scores for verbal
skills dipped 5.3 percent and mathematic ability
slipped 1 percent.
The Sacramento Bee newspaper reported yes
terday that while the study drew no conclusions
about the declines, educators cited several
reasons for changes:
• high schools are tightening grading policies.
• More students are taking tougher courses and
receiving lower grades.
• More black and Hispanic students attend high
school today; their grades generally are lower
and affect the statewide average.
• College preparatory programs have been
diluted, leaving students unprepared to answer
questions on admission tests.
Lottery moves forward
SAC RAMENIO — California's lottery
lurched closer to being a reality yesterday as the
new commission organized itself in a whirlwind
six-minute meeting, walled from direct public
view by an army of TV news camera crews.
Later in the day, commissioners said at a

Capitol news conference packed with reporters
that they plan to meet with some of the eight can
didates for lottery executive director before their
next session Feb. 13.
Howard Varner, 59, a food-service corpora
tion chairman from Pacific Palisades who was se
lected as commission chairman, said seven of the
eight candidates are currently lottery commis
sioners in other states and have the knowledge
that will be key to success in California. None of
the candidates for executive director were
named.
The commission, which includes at least two
members who voted against creating a state lot
tery, plans to make recommendations to Gov.
George Deukmejian, who will appoint the execu
tive director.
Utility wins nuclear case
SAN FRANCISCO — In a victory for a
beleaguered Washington utility system, a federal
appeals court yesterday upheld contracts requir
ing residents of three Northwest states to con
tinue paying for three nuclear power plants, two
of which have been mothballed.
The decision by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals affects three plants in Washington in
which more than $6 billion worth of bonds have
been invested by the Washington Public Power
Supply System, or WPPSS.
Last year WPPSS suffered the largest bond
default in the nation's history when it admitted it
could not pay the $2.5 billion debt on bonds for
two other abandoned nuclear plants in the same
system.
Yesterday's decision, which upheld a 1983
ruling by a federal judge in Portland, affects
ratepayers in Washington, Oregon and Idaho.
It was a victory for WPPSS and for under
writers of the bonds. But a lawyer representing
18 ratepayers who challenged the contracts said
the decision will hurt consumers.

The plants are WPPSS projects 1, 2 and 3.
Plant 2, at the Hanford site near Richland,
Wash., began operation last December; work has
been halted indefinitely on plant 1, also at Han
ford, and plant 3, at Satsop in southwest Wash
ington.
Porn star apologizes
SAN FRANCISCO — Adult film star Marilyn
Chambers, stunned by the first arrest of her life,
apologized to the police, her fans and her mother
yesterday, while her attorney accused authorities
of using her as a pawn in a struggle over control
of adult businesses.
I ve never been arrested in my life for any
thing, ever, so this is kind of a big shock for me,
not only as a performer but as a human being,"
Chambers told a crowded news conference on
the "Cine-Stage" at the Mitchell Brothers
O Far re II Theater, where she was arrested Friday
night by some 25 police officers.
The arrest came just three days before the
board of supervisors were to vote on an or
dinance to eliminate police permit requirements
tor adult bookstores and theaters. The board ap
proved the measure 8-3 yesterday.
A report by plainclothes police officers who at
tended her show, "Feel the Magic," in the red
curtain-lined room, alleged that Chambers
- a one-time model for Ivory Snow soapflakes
-allowed an appreciative audience to touch her
nude body with their hands and mouths.
"Mom, I'm not a prostitute," Chambers
said to the television cameras on yesterday, add
ing, "(Mom) just got over the X-rated films."
At a court hearing earlier, the district attor
ney s office asked for a week's continuance in the
case for "further investigation."

Supply System, or WPPSS.
Last year WPPSS suffered the largest bond
default in the nation's history when it admitted it
could not pay the $2.5 billion debt on bonds for
two other abandoned nuclear plants in the same
system.
Yesterday's decision, which upheld a 1983
ruling by a federal judge in Portland, affects
ratepayers in Washington, Oregon and Idaho.
It was a victory for WPPSS and for under
writers of the bonds. But a lawyer representing
18 ratepayers who challenged the contracts said
the decision will hurt consumers.

The plants are WPPSS projects 1, 2 and 3.
Plant 2, at the Hanford site near Richland,
Wash., began operation last December; work has
been halted indefinitely on plant 1, also at Han
ford, and plant 3, at Satsop in southwest Wash
ington.
Porn star apologizes
SAN FRANCISCO — Adult film star Marilyn
Chambers, stunned by the first arrest of her life,
apologized to the police, her fans and her mother
yesterday, while her attorney accused authorities
of using her as a pawn in a struggle over control
of adult businesses.
I ve never been arrested in my life for any
thing, ever, so this is kind of a big shock for me,
not only as a performer but as a human being,"
Chambers told a crowded news conference on
the "Cine-Stage" at the Mitchell Brothers
O Far re II Theater, where she was arrested Friday
night by some 25 police officers.
The arrest came just three days before the
board of supervisors were to vote on an or
dinance to eliminate police permit requirements
tor adult bookstores and theaters. The board ap
proved the measure 8-3 yesterday.
A report by plainclothes police officers who at
tended her show, "Feel the Magic," in the red
curtain-lined room, alleged that Chambers
- a one-time model for Ivory Snow soapflakes
-allowed an appreciative audience to touch her
nude body with their hands and mouths.
"Mom, I'm not a prostitute," Chambers
said to the television cameras on yesterday, add
ing, "(Mom) just got over the X-rated films."
At a court hearing earlier, the district attor
ney s office asked for a week's continuance in the
case for "further investigation."
Today's weather
Sunny with highs in the mid 50s to low 60s.
Test scores, grades drop
SACRAMENTO — Educators say falling
grade-point averages and lower entrance-test
scores are leaving significantly fewer California
students eligible for college today than seven
years ago.
A survey of the 1983 high school graduating
classes shows that since 1976 the proportion of
seniors meeting admission standards at the Uni
versity of California has decreased 11 percent,
and the proportion eligible for state universities
fell nearly 17 percent.
That survey is part of a California Postsecon
dary Education Commission study, which also re
ported grade-point averages have declined from
2.76 to 2.62. Scholastic aptitude scores for verbal
skills dipped 5.3 percent and mathematic ability
slipped 1 percent.
The Sacramento Bee newspaper reported yes
terday that while the study drew no conclusions
about the declines, educators cited several
reasons for changes:
• high schools are tightening grading policies.
• More students are taking tougher courses and
receiving lower grades.
• More black and Hispanic students attend high
school today; their grades generally are lower
and affect the statewide average.
• College preparatory programs have been
diluted, leaving students unprepared to answer
questions on admission tests.
Lottery moves forward
SAC RAMENIO — California's lottery
lurched closer to being a reality yesterday as the
new commission organized itself in a whirlwind
six-minute meeting, walled from direct public
view by an army of TV news camera crews.
Later in the day, commissioners said at a

Capitol news conference packed with reporters
that they plan to meet with some of the eight can
didates for lottery executive director before their
next session Feb. 13.
Howard Varner, 59, a food-service corpora
tion chairman from Pacific Palisades who was se
lected as commission chairman, said seven of the
eight candidates are currently lottery commis
sioners in other states and have the knowledge
that will be key to success in California. None of
the candidates for executive director were
named.
The commission, which includes at least two
members who voted against creating a state lot
tery, plans to make recommendations to Gov.
George Deukmejian, who will appoint the execu
tive director.
Utility wins nuclear case
SAN FRANCISCO — In a victory for a
beleaguered Washington utility system, a federal
appeals court yesterday upheld contracts requir
ing residents of three Northwest states to con
tinue paying for three nuclear power plants, two
of which have been mothballed.
The decision by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals affects three plants in Washington in
which more than $6 billion worth of bonds have
been invested by the Washington Public Power
Supply System, or WPPSS.
Last year WPPSS suffered the largest bond
default in the nation's history when it admitted it
could not pay the $2.5 billion debt on bonds for
two other abandoned nuclear plants in the same
system.
