VHSIC
Very High Speed Integrated Circuitry (VHSIC). It's the next
generation silicon technology. It's being developed and manu
factured by the engineers and scientists of Honeywell's Solid
State Electronics Division (SSED).
Honeywell SSED is a recognized leader in this advanced
technology. We're developing the most sophisticated VHSIC
technology ever, at .5 micron.
Such landmark advancements are nothing new at SSED. We've
also developed the most complex bipolar circuit ever built with a
first pass success, integrating 136,500 transistors and diodes. And
we continue to research ideas for creating and producing chips
that incorporate over one million devices.
If you're an engineering student with a career direction in Bipolar,
MOS and Sensor technologies, why not join us in the environment
that has promoted the major solid state technological advance
ments through the years. Honeywell SSED in Minneapolis or in
Colorado Springs.
Meet us at Stanford University's Center for Intergrated Systems
on February 13th for a closer look at Honeywell SSED.
Please call Honeywell for more information.
