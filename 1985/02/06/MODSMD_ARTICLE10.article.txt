Buchanan receives post
WASHINGTON — Patrick Buchanan, a
hardline conservative columnist and commenta
tor known for his pugnacious style and blistering
attacks on the press, was installed yesterday as
White House communications chief in charge of
media relations and speech writing.
Making his debut as White House chief of
staff, Donald Regan readily acknowledged Buc
hanan's reputation as a tough-talking critic
whose targets have included administration
moderates such as Secretary of State George
Shultz and Treasury Secretary James Baker 111.
"You may not like what he says but you under
stand what he's saying," said Regan. "His philos
ophy in many ways parallels that of President
Reagan."
Regan said Buchanan specifically agreed that
while he could speak his mind in administration
councils as policies are being debated, he would
support decisions once they are set by the presi
dent.
Regan, in his second day on the job, an
nounced two other key appointments:
• Edward Rollins, 41, to become chief of poli
tical and governmental affairs. Rollins was
Reagan's political director until moving out of
the White House to run the president's re
election campaign.
• Max Friedersdorf, 55, to be legislative strategy
coordinator. Friedersdorf, now a vice president
of Pepsico Inc., was Reagan's first chief White
House lobbyist who helped push the president's
1981 economic program, with its budget cuts and
tax reductions, through Congress.

Pensions under fire
WASHING I ON — Pentagon pensions, long a
target of military reformers, came under assault
again yesterday as David Stockman, director of
the Office of Management and Budget, called
them "a scandal" and "an outrage."
Despite such criticism, President Reagan's
1986 budget proposes only a modest change — a
one-year delay in cost-of-living increases for the
1.5 million military retirees. This would save
$491 million.
A Pentagon commission last year recom
mended substantial reductions in retirement pay
for future military personnel who leave after 20
years of service. Although legislation was
promised, top military officials strongly objected
to the plan and Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger has made no recommendation about
changing the pension system.
"A decision has been made to hold off on the
matter," said Maj. Peter Wyro, a Pentagon
spokesman. He said Weinberger could not sug
gest changes in pensions until he knew whether
Congress would approve his proposal for a 3 per
cent boost in military pay this year.
Wyro said the system "has a lot to do with the
retention of well-trained and qualified individ
uals in the military." Unlike a private pension, he
said, "We don't regard it as an employment ar
rangement; it's a complete way of life. It incor
porates a different ethic and different values. We
look at changes to the military retirement system
with an awful lot of scrutiny."

Seat covers fall
WASHINGTON — The bottom line on toilet
seat covers destined for Navy planes dropped
from $640 to $100 apiece yesterday when a Cali
fornia defense contractor, under pressure from
Congress, agreed to reduce the price.
Lockheed Corp., based in Burbank, Calif.,
agreed to bill the Defense Department $200 each
for 54 toilet seat covers rather than the $640
price the contractor had charged earlier, Sen
William Roth (R-Del.) told a Capitol Hill news
conference.
That meant a $23,760 refund, said Roth, or
$440 for each of the 54 covers purchased for the
Navy's P-3 Orion submarine-hunting planes.
But within an hour, the Pentagon announced
that Lockheed had further lowered the price to
$100 each, making the total refund $29,160.
A Lockheed spokesman did not return phone
calls requesting comment.
Roth, holding the large plastic cover, called it
"just another illustration of the lack of cost effec
tiveness in Pentagon procurement."
Stock prices down
Stock prices settled for a mixed showing yes
terday after making an unsuccessful run at a
record high in the Dow Jones industrial average.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, after
moving several times past the all-time closing
high of 1,292.62 reached a week earlier, settled
back to finish with a loss of 4.85 points at
1,285.23.

1.5 million military retirees. This would save
$491 million.
A Pentagon commission last year recom
mended substantial reductions in retirement pay
for future military personnel who leave after 20
years of service. Although legislation was
promised, top military officials strongly objected
to the plan and Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger has made no recommendation about
changing the pension system.
"A decision has been made to hold off on the
matter," said Maj. Peter Wyro, a Pentagon
spokesman. He said Weinberger could not sug
gest changes in pensions until he knew whether
Congress would approve his proposal for a 3 per
cent boost in military pay this year.
Wyro said the system "has a lot to do with the
retention of well-trained and qualified individ
uals in the military." Unlike a private pension, he
said, "We don't regard it as an employment ar
rangement; it's a complete way of life. It incor
porates a different ethic and different values. We
look at changes to the military retirement system
with an awful lot of scrutiny."

Seat covers fall
WASHINGTON — The bottom line on toilet
seat covers destined for Navy planes dropped
from $640 to $100 apiece yesterday when a Cali
fornia defense contractor, under pressure from
Congress, agreed to reduce the price.
Lockheed Corp., based in Burbank, Calif.,
agreed to bill the Defense Department $200 each
for 54 toilet seat covers rather than the $640
price the contractor had charged earlier, Sen
William Roth (R-Del.) told a Capitol Hill news
conference.
That meant a $23,760 refund, said Roth, or
$440 for each of the 54 covers purchased for the
Navy's P-3 Orion submarine-hunting planes.
But within an hour, the Pentagon announced
that Lockheed had further lowered the price to
$100 each, making the total refund $29,160.
A Lockheed spokesman did not return phone
calls requesting comment.
Roth, holding the large plastic cover, called it
"just another illustration of the lack of cost effec
tiveness in Pentagon procurement."
Stock prices down
Stock prices settled for a mixed showing yes
terday after making an unsuccessful run at a
record high in the Dow Jones industrial average.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, after
moving several times past the all-time closing
high of 1,292.62 reached a week earlier, settled
back to finish with a loss of 4.85 points at
1,285.23.
