USDA named in suit
SAN FRANCISCO — An animal rights group
filed suit yesterday against the U.S. Department
of Agriculture, blaming it for failing to enforce
laws protecting laboratory animals at UC-
Berkeley.
The federal suit, filed in U.S. District Court,
alleges that the 50,000 cats, monkeys, rats and
other warm-blooded animals on the campus have
been mistreated and housed in unsanitary,
cramped cages that leave them vulnerable to
disease.
"Animals are dying before the experiments
and after the experiments because of neglect,"
said Bradley Miller, president of the Buddhists
Concerned for Animals. "Animals are dying in
their cages due to infectious diseases, due to
gangrene, hepatitis, meningitis, overcrowding
and suffocation."
Terry Carlson, an attorney representing the
San Francisco-based group, accused the USDA
of failing to enforce the federal Animal Welfare
Act.

Diablo hearings open
SAN F RANCISCO — A state hearing officer
opened yesterday what are expected to be two
yeuisoi healings on the price customers will have
to pay for the Diablo Canyon nuclear power
plant and said it would probably be mid-July
before the plant first affects electric bills.
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. wants its 3.6 million
customers to pay the entire $5.4 billion cost of
Diablo Canyon, a long-delayed plant that sits
alongside an earthquake fault on the San Luis
Obispo County coast. The state Public Utilities
Commission must decide how much of the cost
was "unreasonable" and should not be passed on
to customers.
The first installment requested by PG&E is a
$219 million rate increase, or 4.4 percent. The
company says the average customer using 500
kilowatt-hours of electricity a month pays a bill
of $36.85; the requested increase would be
$1.62. PG&E plans to seek another $134 million
increase by the end of the year.
But the PUCs consumer staff has instead pro-

posed an initial rate decrease of $169 million, or
$1.25 a month for the average customer. The
staff cites consumer challenges to more than half
the cost of the first reactor and contends custom
ers should not have to pay for challenged costs in
advance, but should benefit from the utility's
savings in non-nuclear fuels.
Kesterson cleanup
SA( RAMEN IO — A cleanup and abatement
order for Kesterson Reservoir was adopted yes
terday by a state board, which said it gives the
federal government more options than double
lining it or closing it down.
The order, adopted unanimously by the state
Water Resources Control Board, suggests that
the selenium-polluted waste water in the Merced
C ounty reservoir could be disposed of in ponds
on farms.
Today's Weather
Sunny early, cloudy later. Highs in the 50s.
