# Heart defect repaired
## 
### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER Senior staff writer 
Piotr Sternik, the six-year-old boy
from Gdansk, Poland, who under
went open-heart surgery at Stanford
Hospital on Jan. 25, was recently re
ported to be in stable condition at the
hospital. Sternik came to Stanford
Medical Center with a complicated
congenitial heart disease which doc
tors in his homeland could neither
diagnose nor treat fully.
When Sternik arrived at Stanford
Medical Center in December 1984,
he was seen by Paul Pitlick, a
pediatrician specializing in cardiol
ogy. To determine the exact nature of
Sternik's problems, two cardiac cath
eterizations were performed. These
procedures enabled doctors to look
into the boy's heart and determine
what medical repairs needed to be
performed, Pitlick explained.
In a standard cardiac catheteriza
tion, contrast dye is injected into the
heart by a catheter which is threaded
through a vein in the arm or groin.
The contrast dye then allows
visualization of the heart when an X

ray is taken of his heart.
The two catheterizations per
formed on Sternick differed from the
standard in that a special contrast ma
terial was used in place of the dye.
The material aids in the repair of the
heart and remains in the body rather
than being absorbed by it, as is the
dye.
The results of the two catheteriza
tions showed that Sternik had two
congenital deformities in his heart:
one involving a hole between two
chambers of the boy's heart and the
other involving a transposition of two
arteries.
Sternik was lucky, Pitlick said, be
cause if he had been born with only
the transposition of arteries, it is
likely he would have lived "only a few
days." The hole in Sternik's heart ac
tually helped to compensate for the
faulty blood flow.
In order to correct Sternik's mal
formations, surgeons at Stanford
Hospital had to perform a number of
different procedures. One procedure
was to place a patch in the right
ventricle to cover the hole in the
heart. The other procedure entailed

connecting a tube from the right
ventricle to the pulmonary artery.
In the past Sternik had undergone
several operations; however, none of
them adequately corrected his
defects.
As of Monday, Sternik was listed in
stable condition, but it was unclear
when he will be released from the
hospital because he had contracted an
infection in his lungs and was suffer
ing from a fever.
Infection often occurs after compli
cated open-heart surgery, according
to Pitlick.
When questioned about the fact
that the members of the surgical team
have not asked for any money from
Sternik's family, Pitnick replied, "It's
a common thing. . . . Not all of us live
our lives to make money."
Although physicians at Stanford
Hospital waived their fees, hospital
officials still asked for $25,000 up
front before they allowed the the sur
gery to be performed. This fee was
needed to cover hospital expenses.
Through some quick fund raising, the
money was obtained by the Polish
Assistance of California.
