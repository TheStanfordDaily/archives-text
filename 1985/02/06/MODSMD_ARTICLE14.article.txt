## Scientists seek MS cure

Researchers at Stanford, Columbia University and
Mountain View's Becton Dickinson Monoclonal Center
hope to collaborate to implement a treatment for multiple
sclerosis (MS) suggested by current experimental results.
MS is a chronic debilitating disease of the central ner
vous system. It is believed that the body's immune system
engages in a self-destructive attack against myelin, an in
sulating sheath of fatty cells surrounding nerve cells.
Destruction of the myelin sheath often begins at a
young adult age and lasts for the remainder of the pa
tient's life — commonly 20 to 30 years.
Weakness, paralysis and loss of control over the
muscles involved in speech and vision are characteristic
symptoms. Many patients spontaneously improve be
tween successive relapses. There is currently no effective
clinical treatment.
Here at Stanford, researchers led by medical student
Matthew Waldor injected mice with nerve tissue. The
animals' immune systems reacted to the injection by at
tacking their own myelin. The ensuing experimental
disease provides a model of MS: Mice become weak and
then paralyzed, and death often results.
In the immune system, the T-cell, a type of white blood
cell, plays a central role. There are helper and suppressor
subsets of T-cells, which act in a wide variety of im
munological processes. It is known that helper T-cells are
associated with the progression of MS in humans. The help
er T-cell subset plays an important role not fully under
stood in the cause of the mouse MS analogue.
The helper T-cells have a protein called L3T4 on the
surface of their membranes that is not found on suppressor
cells. The research group explored treatment of the ailing
mice by altering the ratio of helper to suppressor T-cells
using monoclonal antibodies.

An antibody is a protein molecule that can recognize
and bind to another specific molecule. Experimenters fuse
an antibody-manufacturing cell of the immune system
with a cancerous cell that can divide forever, creating a
hybridoma cell. Monoclonal antibodies are the proteins
manufactured by hybridomas. Hybridomas can be
cultured to produce large amounts of one antibody. Gkl.s
is the name given to the antibody that recognizes the
L3T4 surface molecule of helper cells. When injected into
mice, this protein binds to the L3T4 molecule, and either
deactivates or kills helper T-cells.
Treatment of mice before or shortly after they began to
show symptoms of the MS-like disease prevented or
reversed the disease entirely. No permanent damage was
observed in the recovered mice.
The mechanism of the antibody therapy is not entirely
understood. The observed decrease in helper T-cell num
bers may be an adequate explanation; other explanations
are possible. A genetically engineered antibody similar to
Gkl.s will be clinically tested this year, said Larry Stein
man, a neurology professor.
Previous testing of antibodies in humans has been hin
dered by rejection, since most of the available antibodies
are mouse proteins. To avoid the possibility that humans
might reject the mouse antibody, "chimeric" proteins —
half-human and half-mouse — will be used. The portion
of the antibody that remains constant within a given
species will be human, while the variable functional part
that binds the helper T-cells surface protein will come
from the mouse.
These new chimeric monoclonal antibodies could be
potentially useful in the treatment of other diseases, espe
cially auto-immune diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis and
juvenile diabetes. These antibodies may also be useful in
treating cancer, AIDS and the rejection problems of or
gan transplantation.
