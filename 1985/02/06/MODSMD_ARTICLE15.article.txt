## The 						Stanford Daily Diamond shining choice 
### 
The hard part is over. The University has lined
up a keynote speaker for commencement exer
cises, and a fine one at that. New York Gov.
Mario Cuomo, whose speech at the Democratic
National Convention last summer was better
received than Walter Mondale's entire campaign,
satisfies the crucial criterion that the speaker be
top-notch. Few are better.
Inviting a politician to deliver the commence
ment speech is risky: The speaker must address
student concerns as well as political issues.
Cuomo, we hope, will combine his political ex
perience with the sensitivity he demonstrated at
the convention.
Where Cuomo will speak has yet to be decided.
The prospective sites for June's graduation exer
cises have been reduced to two: the stadium and
Sunken Diamond.
The stadium has its advantages. For one,
graduating students wouldn't need to worry
about finding extra seats for relatives and friends.
With its 80,000 seats, space is no problem.

But the thought of 60,000 of those seats con
spicuously empty does not make a pretty picture.
Nor does the idea of audience members perched
in the stands, far away from the exercises taking
place on the field below.
We would like to see commencement in
Sunken Diamond. It worked last year, despite sti
fling heat and a few preventable logistical prob
lems. One problem was inadequate restroom
facilities. This is easily remedied. A more orderly
exit procedure is also needed. Last year's crowd
was forced to exit through only one gate.
Frost Amphitheater, long the traditional com
mencement site, was ruled too small. So was the
Oval in front of the Quadrangle. Both of these
sites would be beautiful places to hold the event,
but we reluctantly agree that their seating
capacity is insufficient. To limit the number of
people a graduate may invite to the event seems
unfair, especially to students with large families.
The stadium is too big and impersonal; the
Oval and Frost Amphitheater are too small.
Sunken Diamond is the logical choice.
