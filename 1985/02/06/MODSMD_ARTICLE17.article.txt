(Christopher Shinkman, director of
the Career Planning and Placement
Center, submitted this letter along
with a forward he prepared.)
With the permission of the author,
I am making public a copy of W.
Don Cornwell's letter to me dated
Feb. 4. I know that a number of
people at Goldman Sachs are sorry
that this unfortunate incident oc
curred.
The Career Planning and Place
ment Center staff members and I
were also deeply concerned. My
response was to telephone the inter
viewer, Michael Werner, promptly
and to follow that call with letters to
Werner and his supervisor, Don
Cornwell. My communication with
Werner was intended to let him
know in the clearest possible terms
that employers are welcomed in the
CPPC only on the condition that
they use the interview process for the
purpose for which it is intended — a
productive and valid exchange of
information and ideas leading to an
ipformed and thoughtful hiring deci
sion. We will not allow it to be used
otherwise.
Fortunately, the great majority of
those recruiters who come to the
CPPC have received some training in
the art of interviewing. My hope is
that the negative publicity resulting
from the interviews conducted by
one Goldman Sachs recruiter will
cause all of us to be more aware of
the appropriate nature of the inter
view process.

Dear Mr. Shinkman:
I am writing you in my capacity as
the senior official of Goldman, Sachs
& Co. responsible for recruiting
graduating seniors into our two-year
financial analyst program. As you
know, when our firm interviewed
undergraduate students on the
campus of Stanford University
during the week of Jan. 20, one of
our three representatives adopted a
style of interviewing in which he
asked certain inappropriate and
offensive questions.
•We would like the students and
other members of the Stanford Uni
versity community to know that this
was an isolated incident and does not
ia any way reflect the policies of our
fifm or the attitudes of our more

than 4,000 employees. This style of
interviewing is not condoned by
Goldman Sachs and we have taken
steps to ensure that it is not used by
any of our representatives in the
future.
We have been working closely
with you and your staff at the Career
Planning and Placement Center to
ensure that no Stanford students feel
that they were treated unfairly by
our firm. In that regard, we under
stand that a majority of the students
involved in this unfortunate incident
will be interviewing with Goldman
Sachs when we return to campus
Feb. 6 and 7.
Our two-year undergraduate
program is very important to
Goldman Sachs. Stanford University
has been our most consistent source
of participants in that program in
recent years and we look forward to
continuing our excellent relationship
with the University and its student
body.
Very truly yours,
W. Don Cornwell
Vice president, Corporate Finance
Department; Goldman, Sachs & Co.
Belated thanks
On behalf of the members of the
St. Vincent de Paul Society, families
and children served and myself, I
wish to thank you with love for your
gifts of clothing, food and toys
during Christmas.
It gives me great joy to tell you
that 300 families of all backgrounds
living in East Palo Alto and Menlo
Park were given food baskets for
Christmas, plus 1,054 children
belonging to these families were each
given two or more gifts. This is the
largest Christmas distribution we
have ever done.
For now, we are spiritually content
because as a completely volunteer
effort we gave our best. But be
assured that we will continue day in
and day out throughout the year to
serve, comfort and encourage those
in need. If you are able, we would
appreciate your continued assistance
throughout the year to help us fulfill
this commitment.
Thank you for making it possible
to bring in a small but beautiful way
the peace of God and the happiness
of life to these economically less
fortunate families. A mother's joy
and the excitement and big smiles of
the happy children brought many

warm thank you's and expressions of
love to us which equally belongs to
you.
As the angels announced peace on
earth to the shepherds, so too was
peace announced to these families,
and with it the hope of lasting peace
despite the difficulties each family
must face.
On behalf of these families and
ourselves we can only offer you a
warm thank you sent with love, hugs
and kisses and the prayer that God's
peace is filling your hearts.

Unjust decision
We are angered by Stanford Uni
versity's recent decision to exonerate
the bystanders at the Nov. 19 Beta
Theta Pi party at which several
women were allegedly assaulted. We
live in a society that both tolerates
and condones violence against
women; however, at some point,
individuals must take responsibility
for their own actions or inactions.
Whether or not the bystanders were
laughing, their inaction implies a
silent consent.
The University has trivialized the
incident by focusing on the minor
details of the assault and exonerating
the onlookers. We would like to see
the University issue a strong state
ment condemning such reprehensible
behavior and affirming the credibility
of the women who said they were
assaulted. We would also like to see
immediate implementation of an
educational program targeting the
fraternities but available to all Stan
ford students. The educational pro
grams could include dorm-based'
self-defense demonstrations for
women and discussions for both
men and women.
Violence toward women will not
end unless individuals take responsi
bility for their own actions; to this
end, the University should publicly
denounce the behavior of the on
lookers and initiate education of the
general Stanford community.
