## Oppressing Palestinians 
### 
As a member of the Stanford Committee for Justice in
the Middle East, I would like to comment on Hillel's and
Stanford-in-Government's choice of Menahem Milson as
an honored guest speaker on Jan. 28. We do not question
Milson's right to speak, but we do feel obliged to inform
the Stanford community of his direct responsibility for
oppression of Palestinian inhabitants of the Israeli
occupied West Bank, where he served as chief of the Is
raeli civilian administration during 1981-82.
Col. Milson's talk of "moderate Palestinians,"
"stemming the influence of the PLO" and finding "the
appropriate Palestinian leadership for dialogue for mutual
coexistence" sounds like a constructive approach to sol
ving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, especially to those
who are ignorant of the brutality of the Israeli occupation
or whose only source of information is the American
media. Nothing could be further from the truth.

VIEWPOINT

Milson was appointed to his post by former Prime Mini
ster Menachem Begin, on the recommendation of Ariel
Sharon. The "civilian" administration was the brainchild
of Begin and Sharon, who saw it as a means of annexing
the occupied West Bank and Gaza strip while still carrying
out the letter of the Camp David accords. This violation of
the intent of the Camp David accords was sharply
criticized by President Sadat of Egypt and Israeli peace
activists and totally rejected by the Palestinians.
The civil administration was to be the basis of Begin's
"autonomy plan" for the West Bank. Under this plan the
inhabitants would run their own health programs, schools,
postage and sewerage services — but have no control over
their water supply, land use, defense or foreign policy. In
reality, the administrative services of the military govern
ment were simply renamed "civilian administration." The
same military officers still carried out the same jobs.
Milson's mission was to manipulate the population of
the West Bank into seeming acceptance of the "autonomy
plan," which would retain Israeli settlements and Israel's
continued military presence. Doing this meant destroying
Palestinian identity and reducing the Palestinians merely
to "the inhabitants of Judea, Samaria and Gaza." And
here lies the root of the Israeli occupation's brutality.
The problem faced by Milson (and by all those who
refuse to accept the Palestinians' right to choose their own
leadership) is that since 1968 the Palestinians have been
united in the Palestine Liberation Organization. The PLO
has all the agencies of any government and is controlled
by a national council and executive committee made up of
representative leaders. It is a fact that the PLO has
succeeded in instilling a firm sense of Palestinian identity
in the vast majority of Palestinians, which will survive any
blows the PLO itself might suffer.
West Bank Palestinians were forbidden to join the PLO
by Israeli authorities, but the recognized leaders of the
Palestinians on the West Bank were elected as mayors of
their towns (before such elections were abolished by Is
raeli authorities). Their leadership in resisting the Israeli
occupation was effective and a large majority of West
Bank inhabitants followed their lead. They denounced the

autonomy plan and refused to deal with the civilian ad
ministrator. They called for protest strikes and appealed
to the United Nations to censure Israel for violation of in
ternational law. These were not the kind of leaders Milson
had in mind.
So he proceeded to depose all of the popularly elected
mayors for refusing to meet with him. Not only elected
leaders, but doctors, teachers and other public-sector offi
cials were also fired.
Public response to the firings was overwhelming. There
were daily demonstrations against the occupation. Vio
lence erupted between the demonstrators (armed with
rocks) and the Israeli military. In the spring of 1982, 25
Palestinians — including seven-year-old Suheil Raban
and 65-year-old Salah Al-Yamani — were shot to death;
400 Palestinians were injured. Schools and universities
were special targets. Under Milson, a professor at Hebrew
University, the West Bank colleges and universities were
closed down more frequently and for longer periods, and
suffered the most severe restrictions on academic
freedom, in their history.
Milson justified the brutality by explaining that it
should be viewed as a necessary response to PLO attacks
on Israel. This was "war with the PLO," he told Canadian
radio reporters. This was the same theme used by Sharon,
Begin and Ytzak Shamir to justify Israel's invasion of
Lebanon. They were "going to the source" in an attempt
to destroy the PLO. This insane notion has since proven
to be a failure. What Israeli occupation officials were
really up against was the Palestinians' resistance to the at
tempted destruction of their national identity.
This last point brings us back to Milson's quest for
"moderate" Palestinian leadership. In fact, what he did
was attempt to build up a facade of leadership from
among the old, corrupt office holders under Jordanian oc
cupation, prior to 1967. These people were totally
rejected by West Bank Palestinians in the municipal elec
tions of 1976. While those with integrity rejected Milson's
offer with disdain, he did have success with some embez
zlers, drug dealers and other small-time criminals whom
he formed into the "village leagues." They were given
money, arms and the power to determine who should be
entitled to such benefits as exit visas, drivers' licenses and
other necessary documents. They used the funds for their
personal benefit, used the arms to intimidate (and mur
der) their critics and used their influence to blackmail
other Palestinians. It goes without saying that no Palestin
ian sees them as representative leaders.
It should always be remembered that under Milson, the
brutality of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank took a
quantum leap. Although his words may sound con
ciliatory, they should not be accepted without analyzing
his objectives or the results of his policies. His sojourn as a
scholar at the Hoover Institution, which claims to support
human freedom, is a mockery, and his appearance as an
honored guest of a campus group is outrageous to all of us
who believe that the road to peace in the Middle East is
through justice and human dignity.
