# Liberals' hypocrisy in South Africa
## 
### 
And the American liberals' hypocritical mean
derings through modern public policy continue.
One may find the most recent manifestation of
their errant journey within the not-so-unlikely
realm of foreign policy: specifically, concerning
limits on the use of U.S. power to influence nations.
Liberals usually insist that the United States
refrain from its alleged penchant for manipulating
other countries and imposing its values on them.
Current examples of this insistence abound:
Diatribes against U.S. support of the Salvadoran
government are frequent, as are protests against
support of the freedom fighters (contras) in
Nicaragua.
This aversity toward the use of U.S. economic or
military force is embodied in a policy of "non
intervention" and "anti-imperialism," and is
professed by its liberal proponents to be a corner
stone of their world-view. Actual adherence to this
policy's rules against intervention, however, is con
spicuously inconsistent, its principles being applied
only when compatible with the latest liberal
"cause."
An examination of recent debate surrounding
U.S. policy toward Nicaragua, El Salvador and
South Africa exposes several reckless inconsis
tencies.
Current attacks on aid to Nicaraguan freedom
fighters and to the Salvadoran government usually
are founded on the contention that it is "immoral"
or "unjust" for the United States to interfere with
the internal affairs of another nation. Proponents
of such a non-interventionist world-view forbid
U.S. attempts to aid the contras on the grounds that
such action would violate the sovereignty of the
nation-state of Nicaragua. They endeavor to
prohibit aid to the Salvadoran government for
similar reasons: U.S. exertion of influence is said to

interfere with the right of the Salvadoran people to
determine their destiny.
One would presume, then, that a proponent of
such a policy of non-intervention and respect for
nations' right to self-determination would also
denounce the proposed use of U.S. economic
power against the government of South Africa.
After all, South Africa, like Nicaragua and El Sal
vador, is a sovereign nation-state and should, ac-

cording to this world-view, be afforded the basic
right of self-determination.
One would expect a consistent adherent to such
an avowedly anti-imperialistic philosophy to argue
in this manner. But he does not: He spends his
mornings attacking U.S. intervention in Nicaragua
and El Salvador and his afternoons demanding it in
South Africa.
He discards his philosophy of non-intervention
and respect for a nation's right to self
determination in the case of South Africa and
invokes a convenient double-standard to justify in
terference on behalf of his pet "cause": The liberal
criticizes U.S. intervention on behalf of efforts he
personally is against and shamelessly demands it to
promote causes with which he agrees.
Many liberals piously claim a devout adherence

to an unimperialistic foreign policy philosophy. In
truth, however, they simply seek to employ im
perialistic means to achieve their own goals â€” all
the time vehemently condemning the use of these
means by others.
Certainly Americans find South African apar
theid practices immoral and repugnant. But it is
curious that the liberal's revulsion at the South
African government does not extend to the mul
titude of governments that strip entire populations
of every fundamental human right we treasure.
The abused citizens of these forgotten nations
are denied rights that South African blacks enjoy
daily, yet their plight is ignored: It is not chic to
condemn governments of the Eastern bloc and
elsewhere for their subjugation of entire popula
tions. Nor is it acceptable to impose economic sanc
tions in efforts to persuade these governments to
reform. Regrettably, it has become the norm
among liberal intellectuals to accept and endorse
Marxist-Leninist systems of institutionalized mass
enslavement as "alternative" methods of govern
ment.
It is disturbing that many Americans so
vehemently condemn South African apartheid
while vigorously pursuing friendship and trade
agreements with Marxist-Leninist governments
that oppress their citizens (subjects) indis
criminately.
Sen. Edward Kennedy should tour a gulag on
his next mission to expose injustice. He would learn
that although South African blacks are oppressed,
they fare quite well when compared to the
wretched peoples of Cambodia, Vietnam, Ethiopia,
the Soviet Union.... He might even tell his friends
and fans the news.
