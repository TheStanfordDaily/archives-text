## Lundblade HR lifts Cardinal 
### TOM SENF Staff sportswriter 
HAYWARD — In the top of the
ninth inning yesterday, the Hayward
State Pioneers were primed to upset
the No. 9-ranked Stanford Cardinal.
The score was tied 4-4, the Pioneers
needed only one more out for a
chance to win the game, and the
Cardinal had managed only one hit
since the fourth inning. The Hayward
dugout buzzed with chatter.
One pitch and more than 400 feet
later, the dugout was silent. With
Pete Stanicek on first, Stanford first
baseman Rick Lundblade unloaded a
tremendous home run to center field.
The ball cleared the 380-foot sign,
went through the trees behind it and
may have reached San Francisco Bay
before finally landing.
As his drive rocketed out of the
park, Lundblade simply stood at the
plate and watched it go. After the
game, he was a little embarrassed by
his Reggie Jackson imitation.
"Usually 1 don't do that," he said.
"But I knew it was out."
The Pioneers were far too
demoralized to mount a comeback in
the bottom of the inning. After three
ground balls to second baseman
Stanicek, Stanford had upped its
record to 3-1. Hayward fell to 1-3.
If this game was supposed to be an
easy one for the Cardinal, someone
forgot to tell the home team. The
fired-up Pioneers scored two un
earned runs off starter Jeff Ballard in
the first inning. An error by Stanicek
allowed one run to score and
prolonged the inning long enough for
Kris Wyllie to stroke a run-scoring
single.
After squandering excellent
scoring opportunities in the first and
third innings, the Cardinal finally got
to Hayward starter Lawrence Peltier
in the fourth. After Toi Cook walked,
catcher John Ramos drilled a home

run down the left field line — the first
of his Stanford career. Later in the in
ning, a throwing error by Peltier and
a sacrifice fly by Walt Harris gave the
Cardinal its first lead, 4-3.
That was it for Stanford until the
ninth, thanks to middle reliever Brian
Pennebaker. Pennebaker baffled the
Cardinal hitters for three hitless in
nings with a mystifying combination
of knuckleballs and curveballs. "I'd
be lucky to go l-for-100 against
iiim," said Lundblade, who was
struck out by Pennebaker in the
seventh on a wicked breaking ball.
Jack McDowell took over for Bal
lard in the fifth and held the Pioneers
until the seventh, when he too
became the victim of an unearned
run. He managed to keep the Card
inal even until the ninth, however,
and after Lundblade's heroics,
McDowell had earned the first win of
his Stanford career.
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
was generally happy with his two
pitchers, but he expressed some con
cern about Ballard, who gave up six
hits in his four innings. "McDowell
threw extremely well. Ballard's
velocity was good, but his location
was off," he said. "But if we had
played defense, they wouldn't have
scored at all."
Lundblade, who has now hit three
homers in four games, is definitely
not a concern. "He's done a great job
so far," Marquess said. "He's our
power guy — our RBI man."
With Stanicek at first with two outs
in the ninth, Marquess had planned to
flash the steal sign — good strategy
considering that Stanicek had already
stolen four bases in the game.
Lundblade knew that Stanicek
might be going. "If he's stealing, I'll
let him go to get in scoring position,"
he said. It wasn't necessary.
On the first pitch, reliever Dana
Gomez came in with a fastball. It

went out a lot faster than it came in.
"I hit low balls best, and it was
down around my knees," Lundblade

said. "1 got my pitch, didn't over
swing and hit it well."
That's an understatement.

threw extremely well. Ballard's
velocity was good, but his location
was off," he said. "But if we had
played defense, they wouldn't have
scored at all."
Lundblade, who has now hit three
homers in four games, is definitely
not a concern. "He's done a great job
so far," Marquess said. "He's our
power guy — our RBI man."
With Stanicek at first with two outs
in the ninth, Marquess had planned to
flash the steal sign — good strategy
considering that Stanicek had already
stolen four bases in the game.
Lundblade knew that Stanicek
might be going. "If he's stealing, I'll
let him go to get in scoring position,"
he said. It wasn't necessary.
On the first pitch, reliever Dana
Gomez came in with a fastball. It

went out a lot faster than it came in.
"I hit low balls best, and it was
down around my knees," Lundblade

said. "1 got my pitch, didn't over
swing and hit it well."
That's an understatement.
