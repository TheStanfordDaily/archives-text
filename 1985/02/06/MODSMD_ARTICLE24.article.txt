After suffering its first league
setback Monday at the hands of
USC, the Stanford men's volley
ball team hopes to regroup tonight
against San Diego State in San
Diego.
The Cardinal, now 1-1 in Cali
fornia Intercollegiate Volleyball
Association play and 9-2 overall,
is looking to regain the form that
propelled it to its upset victory two
weeks ago at the Santa Bar
bara/Michelob Light tournament.
According to Coach Don Shaw,
the men have been hurt by their
lack of game experience outside of
Maples Pavilion. "We have to
learn to go on the road and play,"
Shaw said.
The Cardinal had better learn
that lesson soon. Stanford is in the
middle of a four-game road trip
that will take it to UCLA on
Friday and UC-Santa Barbara on

Saturday. Each game, including
tonight's with the Aztecs, counts
in league play.
Last year, the Cardinal split two
games with San Diego State, win
ning 3-1 here and losing 3-0 on
the road. The Aztecs, who went 9-
9 in CIVA play last year and 14-
13 overall, currently boast a 2-1
overall mark and are 0-1 in the
league.
Leading the attack for the Az
tecs will be senior Andy Aguilar of
Livermore. Aguilar was San Diego
State's leading hitter in the Aztecs'
loss to Santa Barbara last week,
notching 16 kills. Junior outside
hitter John Eddo contributed 13
kills in that game.
In addition to Aguilar and
Eddo, the Aztecs are hoping that a
recovered Eric Barton will revi
talize their offense. The Aztecs
missed the playoffs last year after
Barton was sidelined with a foot
injury.
