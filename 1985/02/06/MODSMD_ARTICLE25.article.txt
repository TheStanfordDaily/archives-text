# Ruggers drop two
## 
### 
Playing its third and fourth matches
in an eight-day span, the Stanford
men's rugby team fell victim to Chico
State and Australian National Uni
versity this weekend.
After defeating Toronto (Canada),
22-10 last Wednesday, the Cardinal
seemed primed for its conference
game with Chico. Neil Angelillo's
drop-kick gave Stanford an early 3-0
lead, but the Wildcats stormed back
to take an 8-6 halftime advantage and
held on for a 16-14 victory.
On Sunday, a makeshift squad of

weary players fell to Australian Na
tional University, 45-6. Sam Aronson
scored the lone Cardinal try on a
penalty play.
The Cardinal's busy schedule con
tinues this Wednesday when UC-
Santa Cruz visits Stanford at 3:30. On
Saturday, the 8.A.T.5., one of the
Bay Area's best club sides, visits the
Farm for three games. The first teams
will meet at 11 a.m., the second teams
at 1 p.m. and the third teams at 3 p.m.
All games will be played on Maloney
Field.
