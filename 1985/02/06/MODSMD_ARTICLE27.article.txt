## Bradach: self-assertive on and off the court 
### BETH KLEID 
Senior Mary Bradach was not
recruited by the Stanford women's
basketball team in the usual way. In a
sense, the forward recruited herself.
As a high school basketball star on
an American Army/Air Force base in

Sports Spotlight

Frankfurt, Germany, Bradach was
virtually unknown to college coaches
in the states. But when she contacted
them, she started getting some atten
tion.
"I definitely had to initiate the
whole thing," Bradach said. "I mean,
I was all the way over in Germany,
and it's too expensive for coaches
from here to go recruit in Europe.
"I knew I wanted to go to college in
the U.S., and I knew I wanted to play
basketball," she said. Bradach had a
systematic plan to accomplish these
goals — including persistently writing
letters to American coaches and at
tending basketball camps in the
United States during her high school
summers.
The camps gave Bradach exposure
and helped her to develop as a bas
ketball player. "The camps were very
important. Besides letting coaches
here see me play, they gave me a
chance to play against people who
were a lot better, and I got a little
preview of what college basketball in
America would be like," she said.
So when the Most Valuable Player

of Germany's American high school
basketball league attended Stanford
Coach Dotty McCrea's basketball
camp in Pennsylvania, she began in
troducing herself to Stanford.
"And after going to her camp, I
just kept writing those letters,"
Bradach said. Her older brother, who
attended Stanford at the time, helped
his sister's effort by giving McCrea
reports of her successes in Germany.
The forward's diligence paid off,
and she received a basketball scholar
ship to the Farm. "I have to give
some credit to my parents, too. I'm
lucky that they thought it was impor
tant enough to send me to the
camps."
But family help and encourage
ment in her basketball career was
really nothing new to Bradach. In
fact, it was her father who spurred his
fourth-grade daughter to an addiction
to shooting and rebounding that has
lasted to this day.
"My father was the school principal
at the American school in Germany,
but he was also the high school bas
ketball coach," she said. "It seems
that we were around the gym all of
the time."
Being around the gym and being
around basketball became so impor
tant to Bradach that she tried out for
a team in fourth grade. It was then
that the self-confident attitude of her
self-recruiting days first appeared.
"That fourth-grade team was all
boys — I was the only girl on it.

That's when people first started
thinking that I was good at basket
ball."
Bradach continued to stand out
throughout her years in Germany, as
a player on her American high school
girls' basketball team and on a Ger
man team. But when she came to the
Farm, things changed — temporarily.
"The competition here is so much
better than in Germany. Coming here
was definitely eye-opening," she said.
"It was really different playing on a
team with 12 people who are all good
players."
During her freshman year she
didn't play that much, but she says
she has "played progressively more
each year."
"I have improved a lot since I've
been here, and as I have improved I
have played more," she said. "I really
feel I have been able to contribute as
much as possible to the team."
But "one-way" is no way to
describe the relationship between
Bradach and the Stanford women's
basketball program. "My coach has
helped me so much, and so have the
other players.
"This team is one of the best things
I have ever been associated with,"
she said.
The senior bursts with enthusiasm
as she looks back on her basketball
career here. "Basketball has given
me the best times I've had — it has
'made' my experience at Stanford."
Through basketball, Bradach has

been able to travel and to develop
close friendships — she said that she
and her teammates are friends "on*
and off " the court.
"I can hardly explain what a good'
experience it's been. I just hope that I
have given back what the program
has given to me." 4 '
Bradach's favorite moment as a>
Cardinal hoopster came this season'.
"It was this past Christmas vacation,
at a tournament in New Jersey, when
we were playing a team called Seton 1
Hall," she said. "It was my favorite', 1
because I made the basket that put'
the game into overtime, and it was<
probably the last time that my parents
will see me play." *
Bradach'*. parents have continued
to support their daughter throughout'
her career by traveling from Ger
many to watch her play during'
Christmas vacations. The senior
credits the sport for helping keep her
family close.
Bradach recounts her years of bas-'
ketball with a touch of sadness in her'
voice, because the end of her years of
serious devotion to the game is in
sight.
"I feel the need for a change. I'
want to pursue new things. ... I think
the best thing for me to do is to go out
into the work world," said the eco
nomics major. She does plan to con
tinue playing basketball on a recrea
tional level.

Senior forward Mary Bradach's persistence as a high-schooler in Ger
many got her into Stanford — her aggressive play under the boards this
year has earned her the team lead in rebounding.
"I'll always have an interest in it.
I'll maintain contact with the game
and the people I've met through bas
ketball. I know I'll still be an avid
fan."
It isn't all over yet, of course —
Bradach still has the remainder of this
season to display and perfect her
skills. She describes herself as a
"consistent and steady" player. "My
strongest points are shooting and
rebounding," she said.
Bradach's description of herself is
quite accurate. This season the six
foot co-captain is averaging 10.2
points per game, and she leads the
squad in rebounding with 6.4 per
game.
Bradach has seen improvement in
women's basketball in recent years,
and she she said that she feels this is a
trend. "Our freshman recruits this

year are great — they seem to be get
ting better each year."
It doesn't bother the forward that
her sport doesn't get as much
recognition as men's basketball. "I
get a lot out of it despite fan aware
ness, but it seems that people are
more aware than ever. Lately, we've
gotten great coverage."
Bradach believes that even after
she has no more practices to plan her
days around and her high-tops spend
more time in the closet than on her
feet, the effects of being a basketball
player will be with her. Her years as a
Cardinal have increased the as
sertiveness that she showed as the
only girl on a fourth-grade boys'
team.
"As I go through the interviewing
process to get a job for next year, I
can see it," she said. "Basketball has
definitely made me more self
confident — it has affected how 1
present myself and what I have to
say."

lasted to this day.
"My father was the school principal
at the American school in Germany,
but he was also the high school bas
ketball coach," she said. "It seems
that we were around the gym all of
the time."
Being around the gym and being
around basketball became so impor
tant to Bradach that she tried out for
a team in fourth grade. It was then
that the self-confident attitude of her
self-recruiting days first appeared.
"That fourth-grade team was all
boys — I was the only girl on it.

That's when people first started
thinking that I was good at basket
ball."
Bradach continued to stand out
throughout her years in Germany, as
a player on her American high school
girls' basketball team and on a Ger
man team. But when she came to the
Farm, things changed — temporarily.
"The competition here is so much
better than in Germany. Coming here
was definitely eye-opening," she said.
"It was really different playing on a
team with 12 people who are all good
players."
During her freshman year she
didn't play that much, but she says
she has "played progressively more
each year."
"I have improved a lot since I've
been here, and as I have improved I
have played more," she said. "I really
feel I have been able to contribute as
much as possible to the team."
But "one-way" is no way to
describe the relationship between
Bradach and the Stanford women's
basketball program. "My coach has
helped me so much, and so have the
other players.
"This team is one of the best things
I have ever been associated with,"
she said.
The senior bursts with enthusiasm
as she looks back on her basketball
career here. "Basketball has given
me the best times I've had — it has
'made' my experience at Stanford."
Through basketball, Bradach has

been able to travel and to develop
close friendships — she said that she
and her teammates are friends "on*
and off " the court.
"I can hardly explain what a good'
experience it's been. I just hope that I
have given back what the program
has given to me." 4 '

"I feel the need for a change. I'

Senior forward Mary Bradach's persistence as a high-schooler in Ger
many got her into Stanford — her aggressive play under the boards this
year has earned her the team lead in rebounding.
"I'll always have an interest in it.
I'll maintain contact with the game
and the people I've met through bas
ketball. I know I'll still be an avid
fan."
It isn't all over yet, of course —
Bradach still has the remainder of this
season to display and perfect her
skills. She describes herself as a
"consistent and steady" player. "My
strongest points are shooting and
rebounding," she said.
Bradach's description of herself is
quite accurate. This season the six
foot co-captain is averaging 10.2
points per game, and she leads the
squad in rebounding with 6.4 per
game.
Bradach has seen improvement in
women's basketball in recent years,
and she she said that she feels this is a
trend. "Our freshman recruits this

year are great — they seem to be get
ting better each year."
It doesn't bother the forward that
her sport doesn't get as much
recognition as men's basketball. "I
get a lot out of it despite fan aware
ness, but it seems that people are
more aware than ever. Lately, we've
gotten great coverage."
Bradach believes that even after
she has no more practices to plan her
days around and her high-tops spend
more time in the closet than on her
feet, the effects of being a basketball
player will be with her. Her years as a
Cardinal have increased the as
sertiveness that she showed as the
only girl on a fourth-grade boys'
team.
"As I go through the interviewing
process to get a job for next year, I
can see it," she said. "Basketball has
definitely made me more self
confident — it has affected how 1
present myself and what I have to
say."
Senior Mary Bradach was not
recruited by the Stanford women's
basketball team in the usual way. In a
sense, the forward recruited herself.
As a high school basketball star on
an American Army/Air Force base in

Sports Spotlight

Frankfurt, Germany, Bradach was
virtually unknown to college coaches
in the states. But when she contacted
them, she started getting some atten
tion.
"I definitely had to initiate the
whole thing," Bradach said. "I mean,
I was all the way over in Germany,
and it's too expensive for coaches
from here to go recruit in Europe.
"I knew I wanted to go to college in
the U.S., and I knew I wanted to play
basketball," she said. Bradach had a
systematic plan to accomplish these
goals — including persistently writing
letters to American coaches and at
tending basketball camps in the
United States during her high school
summers.
The camps gave Bradach exposure
and helped her to develop as a bas
ketball player. "The camps were very
important. Besides letting coaches
here see me play, they gave me a
chance to play against people who
were a lot better, and I got a little
preview of what college basketball in
America would be like," she said.
So when the Most Valuable Player

of Germany's American high school
basketball league attended Stanford
Coach Dotty McCrea's basketball
camp in Pennsylvania, she began in
troducing herself to Stanford.
"And after going to her camp, I
just kept writing those letters,"
Bradach said. Her older brother, who
attended Stanford at the time, helped
his sister's effort by giving McCrea
reports of her successes in Germany.
The forward's diligence paid off,
and she received a basketball scholar
ship to the Farm. "I have to give
some credit to my parents, too. I'm
lucky that they thought it was impor
tant enough to send me to the
camps."
But family help and encourage
ment in her basketball career was
really nothing new to Bradach. In
fact, it was her father who spurred his
fourth-grade daughter to an addiction
to shooting and rebounding that has
lasted to this day.

at the American school in Germany,
