## Netters beat UOP in 'warm-up' 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
The No. 1-ranked Stanford women's tennis
team, playing its usual steady game, defeated un
ranked University of the Pacific yesterday, 7-2.
Coach Frank Brennan said Stanford "won all of
the matches it should have won" and he was espe
cially pleased with the play of Linda Gates and
Leigh Anne Eldredge.
Gates and Eldredge leave today for the Intercol
legiate Tennis Coaches Association National In
door Championship in Houston. "It was a perfect
match (against UOP) to warm up for the Indoor
Championship. They played well," Brennan said.
Gates won her No. 1 singles match against Trina
Lee, 6-2, 6-3. Eldredge also had an easy match, 6-
2, 6-0, against Trina Lee's freshman sister, Tiffany
Lee. Brennan said Trina Lee's playing is a "titch"
better than that of her little sister, but neither of the
matches was close.
Stanford's Stephanie Savides, Kay Tittle and
Alyce Werdel won the third, fourth, and fifth

singles matches, respectively, in straight sets. Susan
Ross lost to UOP's Paige Hodge, 7-5, 6-2, in the
No. 6 match.
"Susan Ross had a good match. It's too bad she
couldn't win," Brennan said. He had a similar
sentiment concerning Stanford's loss in the No. 3
doubles match.
UOP's Tiffany Lee and Julie Fairchild combined
to beat Werdel and freshman Cari Hagey 6-4, 6-2
in that contest. Lee and Fairchild normally play No.
2 doubles for the Tigers, but UOP apparently
thought it had a better chance for winning a match
with better players in the No. 3 spot.
Hagey has been out for the last couple of weeks
with a shoulder injury. "Her shoulder wasn't too
bad," Brennan said. "She was pretty sluggish,
though. The other team got rolling, too. They
began to think, 'Gosh, we really can win a match
against Stanford.' "
Hagey will play again Friday against San Jose
State, Brennan said. The Cardinal will be without
Gates and Eldredge in that home match.

"I certainly hope their absence will not make a
difference. I may be out of a job if it does," Bren
nan said.
The match will begin at 1:30 p.m. on the Varsity
Courts.
