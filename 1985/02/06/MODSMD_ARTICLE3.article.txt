# Library panel suggests location near campus

### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
A special Board of Trustees committee will recommend
next week that the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library be
located on a site off Junipero Serra Boulevard near the
Stanford Golf Course and the Center for Advanced Study
in the Behavioral Sciences, according to Robert Freelen,
University vice president for public affairs.
The seven-member committee will present the recom
mendation to the Board of Trustees at its meeting
Tuesday. The board will forward its decision to the White
House for President Reagan's approval.
In November, the University's Reagan Library Plan
ning Committee ranked the Junipero Serra site as its top
choice among more than 20 considered. President Reagan
also has indicated his support for the site.
Martin Anderson, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institu
tion and White House liaison for library affairs, said
Reagan prefers the Junipero Serra site becausc of its
'proximity to the center of campus.
"We showed him pictures of the various sites, and the
site that was most attractive to him was Junipero Serra,"
Anderson said. He said Reagan wants the facility to be
used as "a living library" by faculty and students.
According to Anderson, the Gerald Ford Library at the
University of Michigan is popular among faculty and stu
dents there because it is so close to the Ann Arbor
campus.

The library planning committee, chaired by Freelen,
studied more than 20 sites before recommending three
finalists to the board in November.
Both of the other sites are more distant from the center
of campus. One is near the intersection of Alpine Road
and Interstate 280, and the other is off Page Mill Road.
All three sites are in the foothills that rim the western
edge of campus, and all are on unincorporated county
land owned by Stanford.
After considering the three recommendations at the
December meeting, a board subcommittee decided to
withhold a decision until members had more time to study
the issue. But now that the special trustee committee has
agreed with the recommendation of the Freelen commit
tee, sources close to the board expect a decision to be
reached at next week's meeting.
"It depends on whether the questions the trustees
raised (last month) have been answered satisfactorily,"
Anderson said.
The members of the special trustee group are: Board
President William Kimball, Warren Christopher, Thomas
Ford, James Gaither, Melvin Lane, Nancy Barry Munger
and Frank Tatum.
"I think this is a key recommendation," said Bob
Beyers, spokesman for the University. "There are a lot of
