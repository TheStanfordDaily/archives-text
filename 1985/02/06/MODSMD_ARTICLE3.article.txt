# Library panel suggests location near campus
## 
### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
A special Board of Trustees committee will recommend
next week that the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library be
located on a site off Junipero Serra Boulevard near the
Stanford Golf Course and the Center for Advanced Study
in the Behavioral Sciences, according to Robert Freelen,
University vice president for public affairs.
The seven-member committee will present the recom
mendation to the Board of Trustees at its meeting
Tuesday. The board will forward its decision to the White
House for President Reagan's approval.
In November, the University's Reagan Library Plan
ning Committee ranked the Junipero Serra site as its top
choice among more than 20 considered. President Reagan
also has indicated his support for the site.
Martin Anderson, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institu
tion and White House liaison for library affairs, said
Reagan prefers the Junipero Serra site becausc of its
'proximity to the center of campus.
"We showed him pictures of the various sites, and the
site that was most attractive to him was Junipero Serra,"
Anderson said. He said Reagan wants the facility to be
used as "a living library" by faculty and students.
According to Anderson, the Gerald Ford Library at the
University of Michigan is popular among faculty and stu
dents there because it is so close to the Ann Arbor
campus.

The library planning committee, chaired by Freelen,
studied more than 20 sites before recommending three
finalists to the board in November.
Both of the other sites are more distant from the center
of campus. One is near the intersection of Alpine Road
and Interstate 280, and the other is off Page Mill Road.
All three sites are in the foothills that rim the western
edge of campus, and all are on unincorporated county
land owned by Stanford.
After considering the three recommendations at the
December meeting, a board subcommittee decided to
withhold a decision until members had more time to study
the issue. But now that the special trustee committee has
agreed with the recommendation of the Freelen commit
tee, sources close to the board expect a decision to be
reached at next week's meeting.
"It depends on whether the questions the trustees
raised (last month) have been answered satisfactorily,"
Anderson said.
The members of the special trustee group are: Board
President William Kimball, Warren Christopher, Thomas
Ford, James Gaither, Melvin Lane, Nancy Barry Munger
and Frank Tatum.
"I think this is a key recommendation," said Bob
Beyers, spokesman for the University. "There are a lot of
important people on this group."
Campus and area residents have raised objections to all
three sites in recent months. Critics of the Junipero Serra
site say the library will have a negative impact on traffic
patterns and the environment. Some have protested the
symbolism of having the Reagan library overlook campus.
Anderson expressed surprise over this kind of partisan
argument.
"1 find it hard to believe that a faculty member could
raise that kind of ideological objection," he said.
The Freelen committee stipulated that the library not
be visible from the center of campus. Charles Palm,
Hoover archivist and a member of the Reagan Library
Planning Committee, said if the Junipero Serra site is se
lected, the facility will probably be built in a ravine behind
one of the hills.
"The library will not be overlooking the campus," Palm
said. "You won't be able to see it from campus. The plan
is to put it in the swale, not on the ridge."
Palm said the impact of the library on traffic and day
to-day campus life will be less than expected.
According to Palm, a "worst-case traffic scenario"
would bring only about 300 cars — each carrying three
passengers — to the library each day. Palm said he
believes a more realistic estimate would be 200 cars or
fewer on a normal work day during the academic year.
Freelen estimates that almost 400 cars might visit the li
brary daily. Planning Office figures indicate that 17,000

cars travel Junipero Serra each day, Palm said.
Both Freelen and Palm pointed out that the traffic re
sulting from library will not contribute to commute
hour congestion on Junipero Serra. The library will be
open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Freelen said some of the negative claims will be
mitigated because the library will probably be smaller
than some have feared.
"The bulk of the Reagan memorabilia is to be located
at Eureka College in Illinois," Freelen said in a statement.
"The exhibiton space at Stanford will be a small portion of
the facility, and will be an adjunct to the scholarly work of
the library." Reagan graduated from Eureka in 1932.
In response to those who say the library will adversely
affect the environment, Palm said, "This is a project that
will be well-funded, and with funds you can minimize en
vironmental impact."
In a letter from the White House to the University,
Presidential Counselor Edwin Meese indicated that
Reagan wanted to maintain the beauty of the foothills.
"We would like to preserve the trees, the hiking and
jogging trails that currently exist, and as much of the natu
ral environment as possible," Meese said.
The Ladera Community Association had planned a
meeting last night to discuss community opposition to the
Alpine Road site. That meeting occurred as scheduled,
but a Ladera spokesman said yesterday before the
meeting that the focus would shift away from the Reagan
library.
