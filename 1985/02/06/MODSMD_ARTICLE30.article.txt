## Opposition pressures Duarte 
### BARBARA SCHULER 
The effects of El Salvador's civil
war may increase the possibility for
the development of a political
democracy within that country, a
Harvard professor of government
said yesterday.
Prof. Terry Karl, who received her
doctorate in political science at Stan
ford, spoke to about 35 people at the
Bolivar House on "The Prospects for
Democracy in El Salvador."
Karl said the war has caused "the
loss of more than 50,000 lives and the
displacement of a million-and-a-half
people." In a country of five million,
that means 27 percent of the popula
tion has been dramatically affected,
she said.
Karl offered an analysis of the deci
sion last fall by El Salvador's Presi
dent Jose Napoleon Duarte to
negotiate with rebel forces in the
country. Throughout her talk, she
focused on the opportunity for
democracy presented by the current
political and military stalemate be
tween Duarte's Christian Democratic
Party, which has allied with the mili
tary, and the FDR/FMLN rebel

forces.
"When studying the democratiza
tion of countries in Latin America
and Latin Europe, the one condition
we found in common was

stalemate. . . . And what political
democracy does is to institutionalize
that stalemate," Karl said.
Karl also cited U.S. foreign policy

as important to the future of El Sal
vador. 'The designing of democracy
in El Salvador depends upon two
forces: the Christian Democratic
Party of El Salvador and the Reagan
administration," she said.
In addition to outlining the lessons
the Christian Democrats have
learned from their counterparts in
Chile and in Venezuela — where
Duarte lived in exile for several years
— she contrasted his WB4 election
victory with his loss in 1982.
"What changed was not the party,
but the context," she said. "A differ
ent military relationship exists in El
Salvador" today, as a result of the
"astonishing" successes of
FDR/FMLN offensives and the divi
sion of the armed forces into compet
ing factions.
Karl also emphasized the
"tremendous pressure" on the
Duarte government, both to "end the
war and do something about the eco
nomy." The problems plaguing the
economy include labor strikes, a
deteriorating standard of living and a
65 percent drop in the minimum
wage, she said.
