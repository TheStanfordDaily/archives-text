New director for GSB doctoral program
Business School Prof. David Kreps has been ap
pointed director of the business school doctoral
program, effective July of this year.
He will replace Venkataraman Srinivasan,
Ernest C. Arbuckle Professor of Marketing and
Management Science, who has been director since
1982.
Kreps, 34, is an economist known internationally
for his research on microeconomic theory and is
one of the business school's most popular teachers.
Although he received his Ph.D. only ten years
ago, Kreps has already won a reputation for
preeminence in his field. He is a fellow in the
Econometric Society, is co-editor of Econometrica
and has been a member of the editorial boards of
the Journal of Economic Theory and the Journal of
Mathematical Economics.
His writings on the foundations of dynamic op
timization theory, axiomatic dynamic choice the
ory, financial markets and arbitrage, the theory of
extensive games and industrial organizations have
been called by one of his colleagues "fundamental
and pathbreaking."
Stanford to seal underground tanks
Stanford may spend as much as $400,000 during
the next three years to seal off many underground
tanks it has used to store fuels and oil and to correct
any leaks that may be found in tanks it plans to
continue using.
A total of 33 storage tanks are spread around
campus, three of which are as old as the University

itself, according to Jennifer Gates of the Univer
sity's Department of Health and Safety.
Aqua Terra Technologies of Oakland recently
completed a survey of the locations and conditions
of Stanford's underground tanks. The company
soon will begin testing for leaks and will determine
if any contamination of ground or the groundwater
supply has occurred.
Most of the University's tanks now store diesel
fuel, gasoline and heavy fuel oil. Three tanks con
taining ethanol, rocket fuel and transformer oil will
each be closed.
Gates said the substances "have low toxicity and
are relatively nonhazardous to the underground
water."
Following the testing phase, which is expected to
last about three months, the Department of Health
and Safety and Aqua Terra Technologies will
develop a plan to bring the tanks into compliance
with recently enacted code requirements for
storage of underground liquids.
Korn appoints task force
Three task forces to examine the scope and di
rection of new academic programs of the School of
Medicine have been appointed by Medical School
Dean David Korn.
The groups will review and make recommen
dations to the dean about:
• expanded programs in organ transplantation
medicine — specifically kidney and bone marrow,
• nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and
• primary care.
The task force recommendations will be impor

tant for the academic directions of the medical
school, stressed Korn, who assumed the deanship
earlier this year. The new programs had been under
development for some time.
Korn said he put the plans temporarily on hold,
"because we now have the opportunity to deter
mine whether they provide for optimum develop
ment of transplantation medicine, the future direc
tions of NMR and primary care at Stanford."
The task force on transplantation is co-chaired
by Korn and Stanley Schrier, professor of
medicine. David Prince, professor and department
of neurology chairman, will head the committee on
NMR, and Duncan Govan, professor of surgery,
will chair the primary care task force.
A subcommittee of the latter group, headed by
Halsted Holaman, professor of medicine, will ex
amine how the faculty medical practice should be
organized to strengthen its regional role as a
provider of medical services.
Joint public service fellowship
Establishment of a joint public service fellowship
for graduate seniors has been announced by Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy and UC-
Berkeley Chancellor Ira Michael Heyman.
The new fellowships are named in honor of John
Gardner, an alumnus of both institutions.
Intended to encourage some of the ablest stu
dents at the two universities to consider public ser
vice careers in government and the volunteer sec
tor, the Gardner Fellowship Program will provide
six fellows with $12,000 stipends for 11 months,
plus funding for program expenses.
