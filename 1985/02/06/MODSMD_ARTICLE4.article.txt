Charges have been filed against all
34 people arrested in connection with
the Super Bowl, and the district attor

prehended recently in Reno.
Herrington said he is pleased with
the way his department handled the
event.

pickpocketing, two for disturbing the
peace, one for using a phony ticket,
one for drunk driving and one who
was arrested and released when no
