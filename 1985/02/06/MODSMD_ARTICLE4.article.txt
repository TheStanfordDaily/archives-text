# Bowl cases await DA action
## 
### BRYAN WALSER Staff writer 
Charges have been filed against all
34 people arrested in connection with
the Super Bowl, and the district attor
ney must now act on those cases, ac
cording to Stanford Police Chief Mar
vin Herrington.
Most of the arrests were made on
charges of trespassing and public
drunkenness, although police did ap
prehend several alleged pickpockets
and scalpers.
To speed processing, some cases
have been closed on the basis of time
already served: Many out-of-towners

who were arrested on misdemeanor
charges spent a night in jail, he said.
But the police department is not
finished with all the work stemming
from the Jan. 21 game. The depart
ment is currently working through the
case load left by the game, and has
recovered some stolen property, Her
rington said.
One person involved in a recrea
tional vehicle burglary here was ap
prehended recently in Reno.
Herrington said he is pleased with
the way his department handled the
event.
"This was a very big deal, and it

came out really well," he said. "For
an event of this kind, we prevented
most of the possible crime. Thirty
four arrests are very few when you
have 120,000 to 130,000 people to
deal with."
A complete tally of game-day ar
rests shows 10 people nabbed for
public drunkenness, six for trespass
ing, five for scalping tickets, three for
pickpocketing, two for disturbing the
peace, one for using a phony ticket,
one for drunk driving and one who
was arrested and released when no
charges were filed.
Total game-day crime reports in
cluded two cases of attempted bur
glary at the ABC news trailer com
pound, two cases of vehicle burglary
in the recreational vehicle parking
lot, one case of petty theft and 39
cases of pickpocketing. Later reports
included several more cases of vehicle
burglaries and pickpocketing, mostly
filed by people who had left the area
and later noticed something missing.
To combat the problem of
unauthorized entry into Stanford

Stadium, the department stationed
guards within sight of one another
around the perimeter of the stadium
fence.
Approximately 50 members of the
60-person force were on duty for the
event, Herrington said. Additional
people, mainly off-duty officers from
other jurisdictions, were hired to pro
vide extra manpower. The NFL pro
vided a private security force,
which provided some of the man
power neccesary to guard fixed posts.
