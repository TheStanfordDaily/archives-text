# C-IR asks Kennedy for help
## 
### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER Senior staff writer 
The Committee on Investment Re
sponsibility (C-IR) voted unani
mously yesterday to request that Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy
hire a permanent, full-time staff
member to review the University's in
vestment policies.
C-IR Chairman Richard Brody
said that there was "mostly general
agreement that the existing criteria
for divestment was a structure with
which we could live," but that a per
manent staff member could speed up
the committee's investigations.
"There was unanimous agreement
that there is a need to develop a
capacity to look more into
divestiture," said Brody, a political
science professor.
Brody said the full-time staff mem
ber "could begin to develop the infor
mation" needed to make decisions
about morally unsound companies in
South Africa and other countries.
The committee needs more staff
people "to simply develop a capacity
to look more into divestiture ... to
not simply be reacting to things,"
Brody said.
The major need of the committee
at this time is "to develop informa
tion," he said.
The committee would like to
"develop a specific knowledge on
specific cases ... we want to have
developed more specification on what

is socially injurious action," Brody
said.
The committee chairman said that
sales to the South African military are
a "socially injurious action."
After yesterday's meeting, commit
tee member Mark Landesmann, a
fifth-year senior majoring in interna
tional policy studies, said the only so
lution to the existing case-by-case ap
proach of the committee is an in
crease in resources.
In a Jan. 30 letter to the C-IR,
Landesmann suggested two improve
ments for the University's divestment
policy:
• The adoption of "mechanized rules
and criteria that allow for automatic

divestment" of morally questionable
companies.
•The establishment of a task force to
study the conduct of companies in
Stanford's portfolio.
The committee decided instead to
send a letter to Kennedy requesting a
permanent staff member.
The addition of a permanant staff
member "should be a substantial help
in facilitating an active process of
selective divestiture in the future,"
Landesmann said.
"It's a very reasonable argument
that every committee should have the
ability to defend itself," he added.
"I feel that the C-IR members have
been reluctant to make divestment
decisions because there has not been
enough information," Landesmann
said.
The C-IR spent much of last year
looking into Motorola — a Chicago
based electronics firm — and its
dealings in South Africa. Brody said
that issue currently has been shelved
as the committee works on internal
affairs, specifically on hiring a full
time staff member.
"We have no further actions on
Motorola at this point," he said.
Landesmann said the committee's
recommendations concerning
Motorola will go to the Board of
Trustees.
The trustees will meet Monday or
Tuesday, but as of yesterday, the
agenda had not yet reached the trus
tees.
