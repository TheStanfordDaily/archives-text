# Apple, Inc. founder sees new age for personal computers
## The 						day of 'computer as communicator' is near 
### DEBORAH KEHLE Staff writer 
This year will usher in the next age
of computing, the age of "personal
computer as communicator," the
founder of Apple Computers told a
standing-room-only crowd in Bishop
Auditorium last night.
Steven Jobs said the first age of
personal computing was the age of
computer "as servant," but said that
age is now coming to a close.
Jobs said computers are a new
medium, and whenever a new
medium is born "we fall into old
medium habits." He referred to the
early days of television when shows
were little more than radio programs
with pictures, and compared that to
the current use of video disks. He said
the uniqueness of computers as a
medium is that they are "a simulated
interactive experience."
The goal then should be to
"increase the sophistication and in
teractive quality of the experience."
Jobs said.
The beginning of the 1990s will

bring in the age of the personal com
puter as agent, Jobs said. A computer
owner will be able to specify tasks to
a computer, have the computer carry
out the tasks on its own initiative and,
finally, be informed that the tasks have
been completed, according to Jobs.
"That's where artificial intelligence
will really play a major role," he said.
There are three forms of computer

'Apple succeeded
by creating
markets ahead of
itself.'

communication: computer to main
frame services, networks and
electronic mail. Until now the cost of
being in a network has made it un
profitable, but Jobs said he hopes to
bring the price of the network down

to $50.
Were the price lower, more people
would join networks and more
software would be designed for
clients, making networks a profitable
venture, Jobs said.
Jobs was asked about the relation
ship between Apple and IBM; he said
Apple has declared a period of
"detente" with IBM for 1985. He
added that IBM is a "great company"
that is good at "service, support and
what we call motherhood," prompt
ing laughter from the audience.
Asked about previous market fail
ures of Apple Computers, Jobs said
that at least half of them were caused
by "not facing reality soon enough."
He added that failure can be good if it
forces one to reassess and figure out
what is necessary for success.
"Apple succeeded by creating
markets ahead of itself," he said.
"When you shoot a duck, you don't
aim at the duck, you aim ahead of the
duck."
He paused, then added.'T've never
shot a duck. What do I know?"
