U.S. withdraws from exercises
WASHINGTON — The United States, expressing "grave concern" at
New Zealand's denial of port access to a U.S. warship, yesterday can
celed participation in a mival exercise of the Australia-New Zealand-
United States alliance (ANZUS) and warned that it might retaliate
against New Zealand.
The dispute, which White House spokesman Larry Speakes said "goes
to the core of our mutual obligations as allies," raised doubts about
whether the three nations would be able to continue the 34-year-old
pact for mutual defense in the South Pacific.
It also exposed Reagan administration fear that New Zealand's action,
prompted by strong anti-nuclear feeling there, could have a ripple effect
among other U.S. allies.
The State Department, charging that anti-nuclear movements "seek
to diminish defense cooperation," warned: "We would hope that our
response to New Zealand would signal that the course these movements
advocate would not be cost-free in terms of security relationships with
the U.S.°
U.S. officials refused to identify countries where they fear similar situ
ations could occur. However, the administration is known to feel that
New Zealand's example could embolden anti-nuclear forces in Australia
and Japan to create pressure for similar restrictions on U.S. warships.
On Monday, New Zealand's Labor government refused for the second
time to permit the destroyer, USS Buchanan, to dock there next month
as part of joint maneuvers called Sea Eagle 1-85. New Zealand said it
did so because the United States would not say whether the destroyer
carries ,nuclear arms.
Guerillas seize north Sri Lanka
COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — Tamil guerrillas have seized control of
much of the northern quarter of this Indian Ocean island nation, and of
ficials here are beginning to concede that government security forces are
barely able to move beyond their garrisons.
Sustaining an almost continuous hit-and-run offensive that began in
November, the guerrillas have extended their attacks to the eastern
provinces near the strategic port city of Trincomalee, straining Sri
Lanka's 11,000-man {|rmy almost to the breaking point.
While official pronouncements confidently forecast a wearing down of
the insurgency, privately officials show signs of discouragement and
frustration over the army's failure to contain the guerrilla war to the iso
lated Jaffna peninsula at the northern tip of the island.
The key to the recent successes of the longstanding insurgency, Sri
Lankan officials said, is an unbroken supply line to the northern
provinces from guerrilla redoubts along the Indian coastline just 18
miles across the narrow Palk Strait. Despite the deployment of virtually
all the Sri Lankan navy's 27 patrol boats along the northern coast, the
blockade has been only partially effective in inhibiting the flow of arms
and men, officials said.
Polish policemen await sentences
TORUN, Poland — The chief prosecutor said yesterday that a slain
pro-Solidarity priest invited death by his "extremism," and claimed the
Roman Catholic Church turns a blind eye to militant clergymen.
In the last day of testimony, four secret policemen charged with killing
the Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko made their final statements. Two wept
openly, and said they were misled by blind faith in their superiors.
Capt. Grzegorz Piotrowski, the alleged ringleader who faces a death
sentence, told the court, "1 did commit an act of madness." But he said
that "even in the shadow of the gallows," he could not accept the
charges of premeditated murder or beg for mercy.
The chief judge said a verdict would be announced tomorrow, exactly
six weeks after the unprecedented trial began.
The secret police officers are charged with the October abduction and
killing of Popieluszko, a popular and outspoken defender of the
outlawed Solidarity free trade union. The killing set off protests
throughout Poland and led authorities to order the trial, the first public
trial of secret police agents for actions against a dissident.
"One extremism leads to another extremism," chief prosecutor Les
zek Pietrasinski said. "It has been claimed that Popieluszko's activity
could have no link with the crime, but the truth is otherwise. . . . There is
good and bad in the history of the church."
Catholic lawyers representing the dead priest's family retorted that
the prosecutor was "slandering the victim in the courtroom."
Piotrowski, 33, Chmielewski, 29, and Lt. Leszek Pekala, 32, are
charged with kidnapping and murdering Popieluszko, who was beaten
before his body was flung into a reservoir. The four defendants face min
imum sentences of eight years in prison.
Israel vows to protect West Bank
JERUSALEM — David Levy, Israeli vice prime minister, said yes
terday his government is determined to combat terrorism in the occu
pied West Bank of Jordan "with all strength."
Levy was speaking after Arab guerrillas Monday shot dead an Israeli
soldier in the town of Ramalla. The Israeli government was determined
to ensure the "security and freedom of movement of Jewish and Arab
citizens alike" in the area, he declared.
Israeli troop units continued to search for the soldier's killers. Israeli
authorities have ordered a two-day closure of shops in Ramalla and
neighboring El-Bire as part of their investigations.
Israeli press reports yesterday quoted security sources as saying that as
many as three guerrilla groups on the West Bank have become active
recently. Last week, two Israeli buses were fired upon near Hebron and
a firebomb thrown onto another Israeli vehicle near Kalkilia killed its
driver.
Militant Israeli Rabbi Moshe Lewinger continued yesterday his
protest against the government's alleged soft treatment of "trouble
makers and terrorists." As on Monday, Lewinger parked his car near the
entrance of the Daheje refugee camp near Hebron to draw attention to
his views. -
Greece seeks Lybian arms deal
ATHENS, Greece — The Greek government wants to sell arms worth
a billion dollars to Libya during the next five years, government spokes
man Dimitris Maroudas said yesterday.
He said the January arms agreement, signed in Libya, which provides
for the supply of $500 million worth of arms during the next three years,
was only the first part of the deal.
Maroudas said the arms involved were all made in Greece and foreign
weapons were not included in the deal. He said all the weapons' technol
ogy also came from Greece.
Libyan experts began negotiations here Monday with the Greek gov
ernment on the practical aspects of delivering the arms and military
vehicles.
Indian businessman admits spying
NEW DELHI, India — A businessman accused of playing a key role
in India's espionage scandal testified yesterday that he sold national
secrets to Poland, France and East Germany, a senior court source said.
The government also ousted two top officials in connection with the
scandal. Defense Production Secretary M.C. Sarin and a secretary in the
Finance Ministry. J.S. Baijal, were instructed to go on leave and an in
quiry was ordered into the leak of classified documents from their de
partments.
The court source said businessman Coomar Narain told New Delhi
Magistrate P.K. Dham that he transferred classified information, culled
from several officials in top government circles, to foreign agents for the
past 25 years.
The source, said Narain named a Polish diplomat and two French
diplomats, including a French deputy military attache. Col. Alain Bollcy,
who was ousted from India on Jan. 20.
The French Embassy in New Delhi has declined comment since Bolley
was recalled. France also has recalled its ambassador. Serge Boidevaix,
who is expected to leave India this week.
Polish ambassador Ryszard Fijalkowski described the allegations
about his embassy's involvement in the espionage ring as "baseless."

openly, and said they were misled by blind faith in their superiors.
Capt. Grzegorz Piotrowski, the alleged ringleader who faces a death
sentence, told the court, "1 did commit an act of madness." But he said
that "even in the shadow of the gallows," he could not accept the
charges of premeditated murder or beg for mercy.
The chief judge said a verdict would be announced tomorrow, exactly
six weeks after the unprecedented trial began.
The secret police officers are charged with the October abduction and
killing of Popieluszko, a popular and outspoken defender of the
outlawed Solidarity free trade union. The killing set off protests
throughout Poland and led authorities to order the trial, the first public
trial of secret police agents for actions against a dissident.
"One extremism leads to another extremism," chief prosecutor Les
zek Pietrasinski said. "It has been claimed that Popieluszko's activity
could have no link with the crime, but the truth is otherwise. . . . There is
good and bad in the history of the church."
Catholic lawyers representing the dead priest's family retorted that
the prosecutor was "slandering the victim in the courtroom."
Piotrowski, 33, Chmielewski, 29, and Lt. Leszek Pekala, 32, are
charged with kidnapping and murdering Popieluszko, who was beaten
before his body was flung into a reservoir. The four defendants face min
imum sentences of eight years in prison.
Israel vows to protect West Bank
JERUSALEM — David Levy, Israeli vice prime minister, said yes
terday his government is determined to combat terrorism in the occu
pied West Bank of Jordan "with all strength."
Levy was speaking after Arab guerrillas Monday shot dead an Israeli
soldier in the town of Ramalla. The Israeli government was determined
to ensure the "security and freedom of movement of Jewish and Arab
citizens alike" in the area, he declared.
Israeli troop units continued to search for the soldier's killers. Israeli
authorities have ordered a two-day closure of shops in Ramalla and
neighboring El-Bire as part of their investigations.
Israeli press reports yesterday quoted security sources as saying that as
many as three guerrilla groups on the West Bank have become active
recently. Last week, two Israeli buses were fired upon near Hebron and
a firebomb thrown onto another Israeli vehicle near Kalkilia killed its
driver.
Militant Israeli Rabbi Moshe Lewinger continued yesterday his
protest against the government's alleged soft treatment of "trouble
makers and terrorists." As on Monday, Lewinger parked his car near the
entrance of the Daheje refugee camp near Hebron to draw attention to
his views. -
Greece seeks Lybian arms deal
ATHENS, Greece — The Greek government wants to sell arms worth
a billion dollars to Libya during the next five years, government spokes
man Dimitris Maroudas said yesterday.
He said the January arms agreement, signed in Libya, which provides
for the supply of $500 million worth of arms during the next three years,
was only the first part of the deal.
Maroudas said the arms involved were all made in Greece and foreign
weapons were not included in the deal. He said all the weapons' technol
ogy also came from Greece.
Libyan experts began negotiations here Monday with the Greek gov
ernment on the practical aspects of delivering the arms and military
vehicles.
Indian businessman admits spying
NEW DELHI, India — A businessman accused of playing a key role
in India's espionage scandal testified yesterday that he sold national
secrets to Poland, France and East Germany, a senior court source said.
The government also ousted two top officials in connection with the
scandal. Defense Production Secretary M.C. Sarin and a secretary in the
Finance Ministry. J.S. Baijal, were instructed to go on leave and an in
quiry was ordered into the leak of classified documents from their de
partments.
The court source said businessman Coomar Narain told New Delhi
Magistrate P.K. Dham that he transferred classified information, culled
from several officials in top government circles, to foreign agents for the
past 25 years.
The source, said Narain named a Polish diplomat and two French
diplomats, including a French deputy military attache. Col. Alain Bollcy,
who was ousted from India on Jan. 20.
The French Embassy in New Delhi has declined comment since Bolley
was recalled. France also has recalled its ambassador. Serge Boidevaix,
who is expected to leave India this week.
Polish ambassador Ryszard Fijalkowski described the allegations
about his embassy's involvement in the espionage ring as "baseless."
U.S. withdraws from exercises
WASHINGTON — The United States, expressing "grave concern" at
New Zealand's denial of port access to a U.S. warship, yesterday can
celed participation in a mival exercise of the Australia-New Zealand-
United States alliance (ANZUS) and warned that it might retaliate
against New Zealand.
The dispute, which White House spokesman Larry Speakes said "goes
to the core of our mutual obligations as allies," raised doubts about
whether the three nations would be able to continue the 34-year-old
pact for mutual defense in the South Pacific.
It also exposed Reagan administration fear that New Zealand's action,
prompted by strong anti-nuclear feeling there, could have a ripple effect
among other U.S. allies.
The State Department, charging that anti-nuclear movements "seek
to diminish defense cooperation," warned: "We would hope that our
response to New Zealand would signal that the course these movements
advocate would not be cost-free in terms of security relationships with
the U.S.°
U.S. officials refused to identify countries where they fear similar situ
ations could occur. However, the administration is known to feel that
New Zealand's example could embolden anti-nuclear forces in Australia
and Japan to create pressure for similar restrictions on U.S. warships.
On Monday, New Zealand's Labor government refused for the second
time to permit the destroyer, USS Buchanan, to dock there next month
as part of joint maneuvers called Sea Eagle 1-85. New Zealand said it
did so because the United States would not say whether the destroyer
carries ,nuclear arms.
Guerillas seize north Sri Lanka
COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — Tamil guerrillas have seized control of
much of the northern quarter of this Indian Ocean island nation, and of
ficials here are beginning to concede that government security forces are
barely able to move beyond their garrisons.
Sustaining an almost continuous hit-and-run offensive that began in
November, the guerrillas have extended their attacks to the eastern
provinces near the strategic port city of Trincomalee, straining Sri
Lanka's 11,000-man {|rmy almost to the breaking point.
While official pronouncements confidently forecast a wearing down of
the insurgency, privately officials show signs of discouragement and
frustration over the army's failure to contain the guerrilla war to the iso
lated Jaffna peninsula at the northern tip of the island.
The key to the recent successes of the longstanding insurgency, Sri
Lankan officials said, is an unbroken supply line to the northern
provinces from guerrilla redoubts along the Indian coastline just 18
miles across the narrow Palk Strait. Despite the deployment of virtually
all the Sri Lankan navy's 27 patrol boats along the northern coast, the
blockade has been only partially effective in inhibiting the flow of arms
and men, officials said.
Polish policemen await sentences
TORUN, Poland — The chief prosecutor said yesterday that a slain
pro-Solidarity priest invited death by his "extremism," and claimed the
Roman Catholic Church turns a blind eye to militant clergymen.
In the last day of testimony, four secret policemen charged with killing
the Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko made their final statements. Two wept
