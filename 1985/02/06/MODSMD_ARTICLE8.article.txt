# Senate committee endorses Meese
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Senate Judiciary Com
mittee, rejecting criticism that Attorney General
designate Edwin Meese 111 wears ethical blinders,
approved his nomination 12-6 yesterday as two
Democrats joined 10 Republicans in backing
Meese.
Although Meese endured a five-and-half-month
investigation by an independent counsel, the com
mittee's action — taken more than a year after
President Reagan named him to the nation's top
law enforcement post — represented a substantial
victory for the White House.
Meese's foes vowed an all-out fight on the Sen
ate floor, contending the committee's six "no"
votes foreshadow substantial opposition when the
final confirmation vote is taken soon after the Sen
ate returns from a recess Feb. 18. But, barring new
disclosures of information unfavorable to Meese,
his approval as Attorney General William Smith's
successor seems virtually certain.
Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.) the committee
chairman, said the panel's seven days of hearings,
the independent counsel's probe and a review by
the Office of Government Ethics had established
that Meese was "a man of honesty, competence
and dedication."
But former Watergate special prosecutor Ar
chibald Cox, who has become one of Meese's shar
pest critics in his capacity as chairman of Common
Cause, the self-described citizens' lobby, charged
the committee had found "that Edwin Meese's
record of ethical misconduct is not an impediment
to his serving as attorney general."
Instead, he urged the full Senate to set a higfier
standard: "that every government official has a
duty to disqualify himself from acting on the gov

ernment business of individuals who have helped
him financially."
In contrast to the protracted inquiry over Meese,
the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Commit
tee swiftly approved Reagan's nominations of

Donald Hodel as secretary of the Interior and John
Herrington to succeed Hodel as energy secretary.
The nominations were sent to the Senate on 20-0
votes.
In the Meese case, the support of two Democrats
on the panel — Sens. Dennis DeConcini of Arizona

and Howell Heflin of Alabama — had a tone of
faint praise to it.
DeConcini, for example, said he believed
Cabinet nominees should "have a presumption, or
certainly a leaning, that they should be con
firmed. ... Do we ask for something more than a
bill of health that says you may have some warts,
you may have some skin cancer, but you don't have
something that is terminal? .. . That's where 1 find
Mr. Meese at."
Heflin, meanwhile, said Meese's "answers to ex
haustive and thorough questioning before the
Judiciary Committee go a long way toward erasing
charges of unethical conduct." But in noting that he
was giving Meese "the benfit of doubt at this time"
by voting "yes," Heflin added that he was main
taining "an open mind" on the final vote.
Sen. Alan Simpson (R-Wyo.) accused Meese's
foes of objecting to him "on the basis of philoso
phy, but couching it in other ways." However, of
the opponents, only Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-
Mass.) cited philosphical grounds, contending that
Meese as a top White House aide has been "closely
identified with policies that undermine" basic
human rights. "Mr. Meese stands for unequal
justice," Kennedy declared.
Most other Democratic opponents objected to
what they saw as Meese's blending of his private
business with his public responsibilities and his fail
ure to satisfactorily convey that he realized such
conduct gave the appearance of impropriety.
But Senate Minority Leader Robert Byrd (D-
W.Va.) tied his opposition to the question of com
petence. "I think the standard of excellence — not
mediocrity — is the standard to be applied here,"
he said.
