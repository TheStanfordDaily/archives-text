# Stockman cites 'blackmail situation'
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Budget direc
tor David Stockman said yesterday
that the administration will provide
some form of credit aid for economi
cally pressed farmers, because farm
state legislators have created "a kind
of blackmail situation" involving
President Reagan's proposed revision
of the basic government farm pro
grams.
Stockman told the Senate Budget
Committee that the administration
expects to receive long-term help on
the farm programs — its effort to cut
price supports — in exchange for a
short-term "credit bailout" to tide
over struggling farmers through this
year's spring planting.
Stockman stirred a furor when he
tried in vain last week to get Senate
Republicans to agree to a formal
"contract" trading credit assistance
for support of Reagan's proposals to
reshape basic farm programs. Yester
day he raised the stakes in a lecture to

the committee on farm debt that
created almost an air of confrontation
between the administration and farm
ers, who in November were among
the administration's staunchest sup
porters.
"For the life of me," he said, "I
can't figure out why the taxpayers
have the responsibility to go in and
refinance bad debt willingly incurred
by consenting adults who went out
and bought farm land when prices
were going up and thought they could
get rich."
Stockman said he saw no difference
between the plight of small business
men, failed savings and loan associa
tions, unemployed auto workers and
economically pressed farmers. He
said it would be one thing if farmers'
problems had occurred because of
pressure from "New York banks and
other city slickers." Instead, he said,
farmers and their lenders helped
create today's debt problem.
He added, "We're probably going

to have to do something because the
drumbeat of political demands is so
great that basically we're threatened
with a kind of blackmail situation —
do something for us now to refinance
all this bad debt or we're not going to
allow the farm programs to be
reformed. I think it's a sad day those
kinds of threats are being made."
The administration's restructuring
package, a revision of the program
announced by Reagan six weeks
before the November election, is to
be unveiled tomorrow by Agriculture
Secretary John Block.
As the Office of Management and
Budget director was lecturing on
Capitol Hill, the Independent Bank
ers Association of America —
representing most of the nation's
rural banks — was urging a broaden
ing of the administration's debt
assistance program.
The bankers called on the adminis
tration to drop interest or principal

"forgiveness" features of a farm loan
guarantee program and said that
Congress should increase funding of
the guarantees from $650 million to
$3 billion. They also asked for a joint
federal-private underwriting effort to
cut interest rates on farm loans by 4
percent.
IBAA official Thomas Olson, a
rural Nebraska banker, also said his
group will support farm legislation
that would provide for mandatory
production controls as a way of
boosting prices and getting farm pro
duction in line with demand — a posi
tion diametrically opposed to the ad
ministration's.
The administration is expected
soon to send Congress its 1985 farm
proposal that would bar the use of
mandatory production controls and
gradually reduce federal farm
program spending by cutting price
support loan levels and direct subsidy
payments.
