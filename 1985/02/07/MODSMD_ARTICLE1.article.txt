# Stress at Stanford
## Relationships 
### 
This is the second in a three
part series on stress at Stan
ford.
It has been said that no man
(or woman) is an island. This
could not be more true at
Stanford. Stanford is a com
munity of people. The
residences, the village, the In
ternational Center, Tresidder,
the classrooms, the profes
sional schools and all other
parts of campus exist to pro
vide the opportunities we
need to know, to be, and to
learn from each other. It is
within this complex web of so
cial relationships that many of
our best resources exist for
times of great duress and great
joy. It offers opportunities for
future "connection," intellec
tual stimulation, mutual af
firmation for really being
oneself, shared effort or
values, honesty, self
definition, support,
reciprocity, and connected
ness.
Some of our relationships
develop out of our lineage and
heritage, others develop out
of circumstance, still others by
mutual choice. Whatever the
case, they all require energy
for these relations to be sus
tained and nurtured. Because
we are individuals with our
own needs, there are times
when there is a lack of con
gruence in what we need from
a relationship. Our lives then
become less smooth, less
predictable. It is at these times
that our relationships seem
filled with tensions, anxiety
and conflict.

To understand the stresses
that frequently accompany
relationships it is important to
give them a developmental
context. As with most things in
life, relationships have a
beginning, a middle and an
end. While the time of each
stage can be as variable as a
few minutes to a lifetime,
there are very distinctive is
sues in each stage and
therefore stresses.
The beginning of relation
ships can frequently be quite
stressful, particularly, if one
wants to go beyond the casual
encounter. To some degree or
another most people are
sensitive to or fearful of rejec
tion. Rejection by others
usually confirms our worst
fears about ourselves.
Whether rationally or irration
a'.'y, we fear that rejection
happens because of some
negative quality in ourselves.
This can have to do with physi
cal, social or intellectual at
tractiveness, or in regard to
some other human quality. In
a paradoxical way, it is not in
frequent to find that we
protect ourselves from rejec
tion with self-isolation.
Our sensitivity to what
others think of us can add
stress in other ways. We fear
that if our private self, what we
very frequently call our "true
self," is known, we will be
rejected. Consequently we ex
aggerate our public self to the
point that we frequently feel
inauthentic. Thus even among
people we feel a persistent
state of loneliness.
The end of relationships is

stressful in a different way.
Some relationships end by cir
cumstance, some by choice.
Some endings may be planned
and orderly, still others are
sudden and unexpected. Yet it
does not seem to matter how a
relationship ends, there are
likely to be feelings of desola
tion and self-questioning.
This is to a large extent a
direct consequence of the
process of attachment. Once
developed, it seems to persist.
It is not willed into being after
a calculation of its advantages.
Distress at the end of
relationships stems from the
inaccessibility of the partner in
the relationship rather than
simply from being alone. The
loss of the relationship
exposes us to a sense of new
vulnerability. This is fre
quently accompanied by a loss
of confidence in one's self.

Not infrequently we find our
selves having difficulties
sleeping, a loss of appetite, ir
ritability, susceptibility to sud
den anger or sudden tears,
and inability to concentrate on
matters unrelated to the ter
mination. It is often difficult to
think about anything else.
Sometimes the end of a rela
tionship becomes an acutely
painful reminder of other
losses in our lives. It is worth
noting that even non
permanent endings, brief
separations, can engender
many of the intense feelings
associated with loss and
separation.
It also needs to be pointed
out that there are differences
in the intensity, duration and
quality of the stresses associ
ated with endings in relation
ships. How well in advance

one knows about the termina
tion can be a very important
moderating factor. It seems
that individuals who experi
ence an unanticipated ter
mination recover more slowly
than those who have some
degree of anticipation. For
they not only have the loss to
contend with, but the conse
quential fear that every aspect
of their lives is vulnerable to
unanticipated devastation.
How long the relationship
has been going is also signifi
cant. Prior to a certain point in
a relationship, the loss of the
relationship does not give rise
to great disruption of social
and emotional life. Once a re
lationship is fully integrated
into our lives, the loss is more
significant.
