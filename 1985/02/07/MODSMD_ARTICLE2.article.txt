# When skiing, be ready
## 
### 
Skiing — the word conjures up visions of
deep powder in Alta, uninterrupted miles of
descent in Chamonix or Davos, exhilarating
shutes and couloirs in Jackson, sunshine and
moguls in Squaw with vistas of a sparkling Lake
Tahoe, or for some the peace and solitude of a
cross-country hike in Vosemite.
Unfortunately, if we look at the popular
recreational downhill skiing, for every 1,000 as
cending the slopes on the weekends, six will
descend those slopes in toboggans pulled by
the ski patrol and another four will visit a doc
tor's office Monday morning with sprains or
contusions in need of medical attention. There
is an injury rate of approximately 1 percent per
skier days.
Age, experience, time of day, fatigue of the
skier, snow conditions and type of equipment
used are all variables that influence the injury
rate. The novice skier is statistically the most
likely victim for injury due to falls, especially
when older, in poor physical condition, tired at
the end of the day, wearing illfitting, outdated
equipment and skiing in fresh, heavy or wet
snow.

As ever greater numbers of enthusiasts swarm
to the slopes, their Walkmen plugged in, a beer
behind the belt and a joint inhaled on the lift,
oblivious to their surroundings, collisions
become much more prevalent and can produce
a wide range of injuries to almost any part of the
body. "Defensive skiing" and rapid advance
ment to the less populated more expert slopes
on a crowded weekend day is your best protec
tion against these unpredictable, often serious
injuries.
Fortunately, with the advent of new technol
ogy in equipment these types of injuries have
become less common.
Skis are lighter ("sandwich" construction with
fiberglass, wood, metal), generally shorter and
therefore easier to handle.
Safety bindings have reached a high degree of
sophistication, with release mechanisms for
heels and toes, responding immediately to rota
tional and deceleration forces when adjusted
carefully for weight and expertise of the individ
ual skier.
Skibrakes have nearly eliminated lacerations

occurring during a fall from
flailing skis attached to the
legs by so-called "safety
straps" (although they have
made it impossible to find a
ski after a fall in deep pow
der!).
Skiboots for downhill skiing
have evolved from flexible,
low, laced leather boots to
hightop, buckled, plastic
shells molded to encase foot,
ankle and lower half of the
tibia and fibula. Ankle injuries,
previously the most common
skiing injury, have almost
been eliminated with this effi
cient "brace."
Skipoles are lighter, shorter
and designed without any
wrist straps so as to be easily
released if caught in branches,
eliminating a common cause
for shoulder and arm injuries
in treeskiing.
Skiclothes are warmer,
water-repellent, windproof
and airpermeable (such as
Gortex), preventing cold injur
ies and hypothermia.
On the other hand, with the
universal adoption of this
newest equipment, especially
the higher top boots, which al
low the foot and ankle to
withstand substantial pat
hologic strain, an increased in
cidence of injuries to the knee
has emerged.
Next to knee injuries,
shoulder injuries, especially
dislocations or rotator cuff
(muscle) injuries from direct
falls, have emerged as a more
common cause for pathology,
especially in expert skiers.
Injuries usually happen to
"the other people," especially
if you prepare yourself accord
ing to the following sugges
tions.
Suggestions for ski conditioning
The need for proper
conditioning prior to partici

pation in a sport has been well
proven. Participating in a con
ditioning program for skiing
will help to prevent injuries
from occurring. The basic
physical requirements of
skiing are sustained muscle
contractions punctuated with
short, powerful bursts of activ
ity, general flexibility, and car
diopulmonary fitness. The
typical downhill skier al
ternates between brief peri
ods of intense involvement
and longer spells of waiting in
lines and riding lifts. Proper
muscle flexibility is necessary
to permit easy maneuvering
and to guard against muscle
strains in cross-country skiing.
General cardiopulmonary fit
ness is required to provide the
endurance to make it through
a long day of activity, espe
cially for skiing at high al
titudes and in cross-country
skiing.
As in any exercise program,
begin slowly and progress
gradually. Fitness cannot be
acquired overnight. Ideally an
effective ski conditioning pro
gram will require a minimum
of six to eight weeks to
produce a significant change
in fitness level. However, it is
never too late to begin exer
cising. If you are unsure of
your health or have had an in
jury in the past, get a
clearance check-up before
beginning.
Strength training may be
done utilizing the Nautilus,
Universal and isokinetic
equipment. Special emphasis
should be given to the follow
ing muscle groups: hip, back,
abdominals, quadriceps
(thigh), hamstrings, calves,
chest, shoulders, biceps and
triceps.
A few simple exercises not
requiring equipment are:

Wall sitting — stand with
back against the wall, flex hips
bringing trunk forward while
flexing knees in different
angles from 45 degrees to 90
degrees. Begin with repeti
tions to tolerance maintaining
position five to 10 seconds per
repetition. Duration of each
repetition is gradually in
creased with a goal of main
taining this position for one
to two-minute intervals.
Isometrically tightening your
thigh muscles can be done al
most any time anywhere. Try
knee bending and straighten
ing exercise, while sitting,
using progressive ankle
weights or a book or two in
your backpack hung on your
ankle.
To strengthen your calf
muscles, go up and down on
your toes in toe raises.

Bent knee situps done very
slowly and coming up halfway,
then holding and going down
slowly, strengthens your ab
domen.
Laying on your side back
and stomach and slowly lifting
your leg strengthens your
thigh and knee.
Another important area to
focus on, for both downhill
and cross-country skiing, is
shoulder strengthening exer
cises.

Jumping rope and box jump
ing help develop the power,
balance and agility necessary
for short, powerful, coor
dinated bursts of activity. Use
a telephone book or empty
shoe box and jump rapidly
from side to side across it until
fatigue develops.
Traverse running, beginning
on level surfaces and, as fit
ness improves, progressing to
running down smooth hills,
cutting sharper angles. As with
box jumping, shoulders
should remain facing foward
to assimilate proper skiing me
chanics.
Stretching exercises to all of
the muscle groups that we
have been strengthening
should be done slowly, with
out bouncing. Hold each
stretch for approximately 10
seconds, relax, then repeat a

few times. Stretching should
be done before and after any
exercise; conditioning and
skiing.
Cardiopulmonary en
durance, or aerobic capacity,
can be increased by running,
biking, or swimming three to
five times a week for approxi
mately 20 to 45 minutes each
time.
Many of the aerobic dance
classes and ski conditioning
classes provide workouts to

help improve one's fitness
level. Proper nutrition and rest
are also important ingredients
in improving one's health and
preventing injuries. Take fre
quent rest stops and when
fatigued avoid that "one last
run of the day."
Should a skiing injury occur
to you despite being in top
physical condition, follow a
few simple guidelines for first
aid and/or home treatment of
limb sprains, mild ligamental
injuries and various contu
sions (mnemonic "ICE"):
I — ice (or snow) application
to injured part as soon and as
often as possible for the first
hours to decrease swell
ing, bleeding and pain.
C — compression (ace
bandage or taping) to prevent
swelling and give support.
E — elevation of affected ex
tremity as long as possible to
minimize swelling.
Even fractures or other
more severe injuries fare bet
ter with intial "ICE" treat
ment, can be diagnosed more
accurately at the time of evalu
ation and treatment (e.g., a
cast) can be started more
promptly.
Skiing injuries can be
evaluated at Cowell anytime in
the Urgent Care Center.
Sports medicine consultation
by orthopedic surgeons is
available if needed. Also,
physical therapy (taping,
range of motion exercises,
heat, ultrasound, whirlpool
treatment, massage, etc.) by a
physical therapist, athletic
trainer and a skier himself is
available.
For questions about particu
lar ski conditioning exercises,
call Cowell's physical therapist
at 497-3197.

angles from 45 degrees to 90
degrees. Begin with repeti
tions to tolerance maintaining
position five to 10 seconds per
repetition. Duration of each
repetition is gradually in
creased with a goal of main
taining this position for one
to two-minute intervals.
Isometrically tightening your
thigh muscles can be done al
most any time anywhere. Try
knee bending and straighten
ing exercise, while sitting,
using progressive ankle
weights or a book or two in
your backpack hung on your
ankle.
To strengthen your calf
muscles, go up and down on
your toes in toe raises.

Bent knee situps done very
slowly and coming up halfway,
then holding and going down
slowly, strengthens your ab
domen.
Laying on your side back
and stomach and slowly lifting
your leg strengthens your
thigh and knee.
Another important area to
focus on, for both downhill
and cross-country skiing, is
shoulder strengthening exer
cises.

Jumping rope and box jump
ing help develop the power,
balance and agility necessary
for short, powerful, coor
dinated bursts of activity. Use
a telephone book or empty
shoe box and jump rapidly
from side to side across it until
fatigue develops.
Traverse running, beginning
on level surfaces and, as fit
ness improves, progressing to
running down smooth hills,
cutting sharper angles. As with
box jumping, shoulders
should remain facing foward
to assimilate proper skiing me
chanics.
Stretching exercises to all of
the muscle groups that we
have been strengthening
should be done slowly, with
out bouncing. Hold each
stretch for approximately 10
seconds, relax, then repeat a

few times. Stretching should
be done before and after any
exercise; conditioning and
skiing.
Cardiopulmonary en
durance, or aerobic capacity,
can be increased by running,
biking, or swimming three to
five times a week for approxi
mately 20 to 45 minutes each
time.
Many of the aerobic dance
classes and ski conditioning
classes provide workouts to

help improve one's fitness
level. Proper nutrition and rest
are also important ingredients
in improving one's health and
preventing injuries. Take fre
quent rest stops and when
fatigued avoid that "one last
run of the day."
Should a skiing injury occur
to you despite being in top
physical condition, follow a
few simple guidelines for first
aid and/or home treatment of
limb sprains, mild ligamental
injuries and various contu
sions (mnemonic "ICE"):
I — ice (or snow) application
to injured part as soon and as
often as possible for the first
hours to decrease swell
ing, bleeding and pain.
C — compression (ace
bandage or taping) to prevent
swelling and give support.
E — elevation of affected ex
tremity as long as possible to
minimize swelling.
Even fractures or other
more severe injuries fare bet
ter with intial "ICE" treat
ment, can be diagnosed more
accurately at the time of evalu
ation and treatment (e.g., a
cast) can be started more
promptly.
Skiing injuries can be
evaluated at Cowell anytime in
the Urgent Care Center.
Sports medicine consultation
by orthopedic surgeons is
available if needed. Also,
physical therapy (taping,
range of motion exercises,
heat, ultrasound, whirlpool
treatment, massage, etc.) by a
physical therapist, athletic
trainer and a skier himself is
available.

lar ski conditioning exercises,

Skiing — the word conjures up visions of
deep powder in Alta, uninterrupted miles of
descent in Chamonix or Davos, exhilarating
shutes and couloirs in Jackson, sunshine and
moguls in Squaw with vistas of a sparkling Lake
Tahoe, or for some the peace and solitude of a
cross-country hike in Vosemite.
Unfortunately, if we look at the popular
recreational downhill skiing, for every 1,000 as
cending the slopes on the weekends, six will
descend those slopes in toboggans pulled by
the ski patrol and another four will visit a doc
tor's office Monday morning with sprains or
contusions in need of medical attention. There
is an injury rate of approximately 1 percent per
skier days.
Age, experience, time of day, fatigue of the
skier, snow conditions and type of equipment
used are all variables that influence the injury
rate. The novice skier is statistically the most
likely victim for injury due to falls, especially
when older, in poor physical condition, tired at
the end of the day, wearing illfitting, outdated
equipment and skiing in fresh, heavy or wet
snow.

As ever greater numbers of enthusiasts swarm
to the slopes, their Walkmen plugged in, a beer
behind the belt and a joint inhaled on the lift,
oblivious to their surroundings, collisions
become much more prevalent and can produce
a wide range of injuries to almost any part of the
body. "Defensive skiing" and rapid advance
ment to the less populated more expert slopes
on a crowded weekend day is your best protec
tion against these unpredictable, often serious
injuries.
Fortunately, with the advent of new technol
ogy in equipment these types of injuries have
become less common.
Skis are lighter ("sandwich" construction with
fiberglass, wood, metal), generally shorter and
therefore easier to handle.
Safety bindings have reached a high degree of
sophistication, with release mechanisms for
heels and toes, responding immediately to rota
tional and deceleration forces when adjusted
carefully for weight and expertise of the individ
ual skier.
Skibrakes have nearly eliminated lacerations

occurring during a fall from
flailing skis attached to the
legs by so-called "safety
straps" (although they have
made it impossible to find a
ski after a fall in deep pow
der!).
Skiboots for downhill skiing
have evolved from flexible,
low, laced leather boots to
hightop, buckled, plastic
shells molded to encase foot,
ankle and lower half of the
tibia and fibula. Ankle injuries,
previously the most common
skiing injury, have almost
been eliminated with this effi
cient "brace."
Skipoles are lighter, shorter
and designed without any
wrist straps so as to be easily
released if caught in branches,
eliminating a common cause
for shoulder and arm injuries
in treeskiing.
Skiclothes are warmer,
water-repellent, windproof
and airpermeable (such as
Gortex), preventing cold injur
ies and hypothermia.
On the other hand, with the
universal adoption of this
newest equipment, especially
the higher top boots, which al
low the foot and ankle to
withstand substantial pat
hologic strain, an increased in
cidence of injuries to the knee
has emerged.
Next to knee injuries,
shoulder injuries, especially
dislocations or rotator cuff
(muscle) injuries from direct
falls, have emerged as a more
common cause for pathology,
especially in expert skiers.
Injuries usually happen to
"the other people," especially
if you prepare yourself accord
ing to the following sugges
tions.
Suggestions for ski conditioning
The need for proper
conditioning prior to partici

pation in a sport has been well
proven. Participating in a con
ditioning program for skiing
will help to prevent injuries
from occurring. The basic
physical requirements of
skiing are sustained muscle
contractions punctuated with
short, powerful bursts of activ
ity, general flexibility, and car
diopulmonary fitness. The
typical downhill skier al
ternates between brief peri
ods of intense involvement
and longer spells of waiting in
lines and riding lifts. Proper
muscle flexibility is necessary
to permit easy maneuvering
and to guard against muscle
strains in cross-country skiing.
General cardiopulmonary fit
ness is required to provide the
endurance to make it through
a long day of activity, espe
cially for skiing at high al
titudes and in cross-country
skiing.
As in any exercise program,
begin slowly and progress
gradually. Fitness cannot be
acquired overnight. Ideally an
effective ski conditioning pro
gram will require a minimum
of six to eight weeks to
produce a significant change
in fitness level. However, it is
never too late to begin exer
cising. If you are unsure of
your health or have had an in
jury in the past, get a
clearance check-up before
beginning.
Strength training may be
done utilizing the Nautilus,
Universal and isokinetic
equipment. Special emphasis
should be given to the follow
ing muscle groups: hip, back,
abdominals, quadriceps
(thigh), hamstrings, calves,
chest, shoulders, biceps and
triceps.
A few simple exercises not
requiring equipment are:

Wall sitting — stand with
back against the wall, flex hips
bringing trunk forward while
flexing knees in different
angles from 45 degrees to 90
degrees. Begin with repeti
tions to tolerance maintaining
position five to 10 seconds per
repetition. Duration of each
repetition is gradually in

Fortunately, with the advent of new technol
ogy in equipment these types of injuries have
become less common.
Skis are lighter ("sandwich" construction with
fiberglass, wood, metal), generally shorter and
therefore easier to handle.
Safety bindings have reached a high degree of
sophistication, with release mechanisms for
heels and toes, responding immediately to rota
tional and deceleration forces when adjusted
carefully for weight and expertise of the individ
ual skier.
Skibrakes have nearly eliminated lacerations

occurring during a fall from
flailing skis attached to the
legs by so-called "safety
straps" (although they have
made it impossible to find a
ski after a fall in deep pow
der!).
Skiboots for downhill skiing
have evolved from flexible,
low, laced leather boots to
hightop, buckled, plastic
shells molded to encase foot,
ankle and lower half of the
tibia and fibula. Ankle injuries,
previously the most common
skiing injury, have almost
been eliminated with this effi
cient "brace."
Skipoles are lighter, shorter
and designed without any
wrist straps so as to be easily
released if caught in branches,
eliminating a common cause
for shoulder and arm injuries
in treeskiing.
Skiclothes are warmer,
water-repellent, windproof
and airpermeable (such as
Gortex), preventing cold injur
ies and hypothermia.
On the other hand, with the
universal adoption of this
newest equipment, especially
the higher top boots, which al
low the foot and ankle to
withstand substantial pat
hologic strain, an increased in
cidence of injuries to the knee
has emerged.
Next to knee injuries,
shoulder injuries, especially
dislocations or rotator cuff
(muscle) injuries from direct
falls, have emerged as a more
common cause for pathology,
especially in expert skiers.
Injuries usually happen to
"the other people," especially
if you prepare yourself accord
ing to the following sugges
tions.
Suggestions for ski conditioning
The need for proper
conditioning prior to partici

pation in a sport has been well
proven. Participating in a con
ditioning program for skiing
will help to prevent injuries
from occurring. The basic
physical requirements of
skiing are sustained muscle
contractions punctuated with
short, powerful bursts of activ
ity, general flexibility, and car
diopulmonary fitness. The
typical downhill skier al
ternates between brief peri
ods of intense involvement
and longer spells of waiting in
lines and riding lifts. Proper
muscle flexibility is necessary
to permit easy maneuvering
and to guard against muscle
strains in cross-country skiing.
General cardiopulmonary fit
ness is required to provide the
endurance to make it through
a long day of activity, espe
cially for skiing at high al
titudes and in cross-country
skiing.
As in any exercise program,
begin slowly and progress
gradually. Fitness cannot be
acquired overnight. Ideally an
effective ski conditioning pro
gram will require a minimum
of six to eight weeks to
produce a significant change
in fitness level. However, it is
never too late to begin exer
cising. If you are unsure of
your health or have had an in
jury in the past, get a
clearance check-up before
beginning.
Strength training may be
done utilizing the Nautilus,
Universal and isokinetic
equipment. Special emphasis
should be given to the follow
ing muscle groups: hip, back,
abdominals, quadriceps
(thigh), hamstrings, calves,
chest, shoulders, biceps and
triceps.
A few simple exercises not
requiring equipment are:

Wall sitting — stand with
back against the wall, flex hips
bringing trunk forward while
flexing knees in different
angles from 45 degrees to 90
degrees. Begin with repeti
tions to tolerance maintaining
position five to 10 seconds per
repetition. Duration of each
repetition is gradually in
creased with a goal of main
taining this position for one
to two-minute intervals.
Isometrically tightening your
thigh muscles can be done al
most any time anywhere. Try
knee bending and straighten
ing exercise, while sitting,
using progressive ankle
weights or a book or two in
your backpack hung on your
ankle.
To strengthen your calf
muscles, go up and down on
your toes in toe raises.

Bent knee situps done very
slowly and coming up halfway,
then holding and going down
slowly, strengthens your ab
domen.
Laying on your side back
and stomach and slowly lifting
your leg strengthens your
thigh and knee.
Another important area to
focus on, for both downhill
and cross-country skiing, is
shoulder strengthening exer
cises.

Jumping rope and box jump
ing help develop the power,
balance and agility necessary
for short, powerful, coor
dinated bursts of activity. Use
a telephone book or empty
shoe box and jump rapidly
from side to side across it until
fatigue develops.
Traverse running, beginning
on level surfaces and, as fit
ness improves, progressing to
running down smooth hills,
cutting sharper angles. As with
box jumping, shoulders
should remain facing foward
to assimilate proper skiing me
chanics.
Stretching exercises to all of
the muscle groups that we
have been strengthening
should be done slowly, with
out bouncing. Hold each
stretch for approximately 10
seconds, relax, then repeat a

few times. Stretching should
be done before and after any
exercise; conditioning and
skiing.
Cardiopulmonary en
durance, or aerobic capacity,
can be increased by running,
biking, or swimming three to
five times a week for approxi
mately 20 to 45 minutes each
time.
Many of the aerobic dance
classes and ski conditioning
classes provide workouts to

help improve one's fitness
level. Proper nutrition and rest
are also important ingredients
in improving one's health and
preventing injuries. Take fre
quent rest stops and when
fatigued avoid that "one last
run of the day."
Should a skiing injury occur
to you despite being in top
physical condition, follow a
few simple guidelines for first
aid and/or home treatment of
limb sprains, mild ligamental
injuries and various contu
sions (mnemonic "ICE"):
I — ice (or snow) application
to injured part as soon and as
often as possible for the first
hours to decrease swell
ing, bleeding and pain.
C — compression (ace
bandage or taping) to prevent
swelling and give support.
E — elevation of affected ex
tremity as long as possible to
minimize swelling.
Even fractures or other
more severe injuries fare bet
ter with intial "ICE" treat
ment, can be diagnosed more
accurately at the time of evalu
ation and treatment (e.g., a
cast) can be started more
promptly.
Skiing injuries can be
evaluated at Cowell anytime in
the Urgent Care Center.
Sports medicine consultation
by orthopedic surgeons is
available if needed. Also,
physical therapy (taping,
range of motion exercises,
heat, ultrasound, whirlpool
treatment, massage, etc.) by a
physical therapist, athletic
trainer and a skier himself is
available.

lar ski conditioning exercises,
