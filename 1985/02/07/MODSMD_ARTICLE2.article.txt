# When skiing, be ready

Skiing â€” the word conjures up visions of
deep powder in Alta, uninterrupted miles of
descent in Chamonix or Davos, exhilarating
shutes and couloirs in Jackson, sunshine and
moguls in Squaw with vistas of a sparkling Lake
Tahoe, or for some the peace and solitude of a
cross-country hike in Vosemite.
Unfortunately, if we look at the popular
recreational downhill skiing, for every 1,000 as
cending the slopes on the weekends, six will
descend those slopes in toboggans pulled by
the ski patrol and another four will visit a doc
tor's office Monday morning with sprains or
contusions in need of medical attention. There
is an injury rate of approximately 1 percent per
skier days.
Age, experience, time of day, fatigue of the
skier, snow conditions and type of equipment
used are all variables that influence the injury
rate. The novice skier is statistically the most
likely victim for injury due to falls, especially
when older, in poor physical condition, tired at
the end of the day, wearing illfitting, outdated
equipment and skiing in fresh, heavy or wet
snow.

As ever greater numbers of enthusiasts swarm
to the slopes, their Walkmen plugged in, a beer
behind the belt and a joint inhaled on the lift,
oblivious to their surroundings, collisions
become much more prevalent and can produce
a wide range of injuries to almost any part of the
body. "Defensive skiing" and rapid advance
ment to the less populated more expert slopes
on a crowded weekend day is your best protec
tion against these unpredictable, often serious
injuries.
Fortunately, with the advent of new technol
ogy in equipment these types of injuries have
become less common.
Skis are lighter ("sandwich" construction with
fiberglass, wood, metal), generally shorter and
therefore easier to handle.
Safety bindings have reached a high degree of
sophistication, with release mechanisms for
heels and toes, responding immediately to rota
tional and deceleration forces when adjusted
carefully for weight and expertise of the individ
ual skier.
