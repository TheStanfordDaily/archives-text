# AIDS poses a problem gays can't ignore
## 
### 
Beyond the health-related issues
that all of society shares, the gay com
munity experiences particular ones. It
would be suicidal, particularly for gay
men, to ignore the current AIDS
epidemic. Given that lesbians and
heterosexuals at large have been but
minimally affected, the emphasis of
this article will be gay men's health as
it relates to AIDS. Other gay health is
sues, though important, have less ur
gency today and discussions of those
can be found elsewhere.
Because the AIDS virus can be
sexually transmitted, most likely
through semen, although other bodily
fluids might also be involved, sexuality
among men between whom there is
penile penetration is particularly
hazardous. This fact coupled with the
fact that a significant percentage of
gays have multiple sexual partners ex
plain the rapid development of the
epidemic among gay men. A specific
factor has to do with the lengthy in
cubation period, anywhere between 6
to4o months. This period allows active
carriers to transmit the disease un
knowingly.
Although homosexuality per se has
been, and unfortunately still is,
negatively sanctioned by society, some
specifics of homosexual behavior are
not. Traditionally, multiple partners in
any male carries fewer consequences
than it does for females. Issues of
pregnancy, virginity, violation and
moral transgression are by comparison
negligible or not there. Until recently,
the risk of sexually transmitted disease
and the possible abuse, or even addic

tion, to casual impersonal sex were the
"problems" for gay men. The advan
tages were the variety and excitement
of intimately and pleasurably relating
to a wide variety of other men. An indi
vidual so inclined, if conscious, cau
tious and discriminating, could "play"
this way without much hesitation.
Not so today. Sexually transmitted
disease and problems of lack of in
timacy in casual sexual encounters are
mild when compared to the virtual
death sentence for whoever contracts
AIDS. So far, no one diagnosed with
AIDS has lived for more than 3 years.
In most cases there is a direct relation
ship between multiple partners and
patients with AIDS.
So, if you want to stay alive, indis
criminate careless sex with numerous
partners is out. If you want to run this
risk you need to take a good look at
the seriousness of your actions. Care
ful sexual encounters with as few
partners as possible, will help avert
this risk. If you want to be safe, stay ex
clusively with a lover-friend that you
can trust and who is as committed to
monogamy as you are. Of course, total
abstinence guarantees no possible
AIDS contact (assuming you are not an
intravenous drug addict) yet it is an un
realistic choice for most people.
For the gay men who is not in a
couple relationship or who is in the
early stages of the "coming out"
process, great caution is paramount.
Here, the concept of "safe sex" is per
tinent. Epidemiologically speaking, it
is not clear yet what safe sex means.

However, "no exchange of bodily
fluids" seems to summarize it.
The first step in the direction of
safety is to know your potential sexual
partner well prior to any sexual in
timacy. Befriend him and develop a
sense of trust. Get comfortable with
each other. Gently explore his sexual
history and share yours with him. Ask
ing relevant questions gives him the
message that you are conscientious
and trustworthy. Petting, necking, fon
dling, and mutual masturbation fall in
the category of safe sex. Exchange of
saliva while kissing might not be. Fel
latio and anal intercourse, unless with
someone who is "clear," does not.
There is controversy about the safety
of using condoms, as some claim that
the AIDS virus is so small that it can fil
ter through the latex rubber fibers.
Needless to say, patronizing the gay
bath houses for anonymous sex is ex
tremely dangerous. Going to pick-up
bars and indiscriminately engaging in
casual sex with someone you just met,
is also very dangerous. The safest way
to meet other gay men is through
private parties, mutual friends, dinner
invitations or through gay social organ
izations. At Stanford, the Gay and Les
bian Alliance has weekly social
gatherings which offer individuals a
warm and friendly atmosphere for the
development of activities and
friendship.
AIDS is the result of a viral infection,
and as such, is less able to take hold of
an individual who is in a state of good
health and has his immunological
responses intact. In this sense, good

nutrition, regular exercise, avoidance
of drugs, and peace of mind are essen
tial.
Your attitudes about yourself and
about the validity of your sexual pref
erence are of great importance. Self
condemnation, self-hate, internalized
homophobia or social inferiority can
lead to a "who cares" posture and ulti
mately to self-destructive behaviors. It
is easier to sabotage our health when
we do not feel best about ourselves.
If you are still struggling with these
issues, get help. It is available through
Cowell Student Health Service for pro
fessional consultation and through
"The Bridge" for peer-counselling.
The AIDS virus, it is now known, has
been around for a very long time, with
endemic pockets identified in Central
Africa. There the incidence is among
heterosexuals and not among the
groups it has affected in this country.
This virus is responsible for one of the
deadliest epidemics in modern medi
cal history. With exception to direct
blood contamination, its spread is di
rectly proportional to multiple sexual
partners. As a gay man you play a key
role in the future course of this
epidemic. Your responsibility goes
beyond the preservation of your own
health and to that of the gay commu
nity and of society at large.
Enjoy who you are, but responsibly,
so that you can continue to enjoy life.
