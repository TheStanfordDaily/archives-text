Cuts — Medical attention for cuts is advised
when a) movement or feeling is lost, b) the
edges at the skin pull apart instead of coming
easily together, c) it is caused by a bite or is very
dirty, d) it occurs in an area of continuous
movement such as a joint, or e) it occurs in an
area such as the face which is of cosmetic con
cern.
Exhaustion — Frequent exhaustion can be a sign
of physical problems, but it also can be a reac
tion to unhappiness. Increased physical activity
can help to tap your body's energy, which is
geared to your particular metabolism, and help
combat exhaustion.
Ears — Use of cotton swabs to clean ears may
damage the protective skin, and can push the
wax deeper into the ear canal. Avoid using these
in your ears.
Constipation — Eating a balanced diet at regular
intervals, particularly increasing consumption
of fruits and vegetables and drinking plenty of
fluids, can usually help prevent constipation.
Stomach — A mild upset stomach may be
relieved by just not eating food for a few hours,
loosening clothing, or lying down on the right
side of the body. The last method works be
cause it allows gravity to move the food out of
the stomach and into the intestines.
Side stitches — The painful stitch in the side
which discourages many new runners is caused

by the downward pull on internal organs. To
avoid this, start out slowly when running, run
with a smooth gait, and never on a full stomach.
Lose weight if necessary and exercise to
strengthen stomach muscles.
Allergies — Allergies result from a defect in the
immune system, which normally serves to
protect our bodies from microscopic invaders.
This defect is a tendency to overreact to foreign
substances, such as pollens that are otherwise
utterly harmless.
Anxiety — Anxiety is a common reaction to
stress. Some common symptoms include loss of
appetite, heart palpitations, sweaty palms,
tremors, insomnia and lack of attention to work.
Frequently, talking about the problem with
friends and counselors will help identify the
cause of anxiety.
Physical fitness — Without exercise the muscles
become flabby, the bones become brittle, and
the heart becomes weak. The ability to
withstand any kind of stress is directly related to
the physical condition of the body. Walking,
jogging, swimming and bicycling are easy and
pleasurable ways to put regular physical exer
cise into your life.
