Why give blood?
In spite of our sophisticated medical soci
ety, not all patients respond to drugs, sur
gery, and medical technology alone. Blood is
a component of treatment for trauma, sur
gery, or cancer that cannot be manufactured;
it is only available from donors.
30,000 units (pints) of blood are required in
the United States every day (100 at Stanford
Hospital alone!), or 14 million units per year.
Approximately 40 percent of our population
is medically eligible to donate blood, and yet
less than 10 percent of the population donate
this 14 million units. More men than women
tend to be blood donors.
Who can give?
In general, anyone age 17 to 65 who is in
good health can donate. Donors must weigh
at least 110 pounds, they must wait at least 8
weeks between donations, but may not
donate more than 5 times in any 12-month
period.
You may not donate if you have or have had
hepatitis, a current heart condition (other
than a murmur), diabetes requiring insulin,
epilepsy, or cancer within the past five years.
Temporary deferrals may result if you have a
cold or any other infection requiring medica
tion, a close hepatitis contact within six
months, a pregnancy within six weeks, or
travel to a malaria area within six months. If

you have in fact taken Chloroquine or Fan
sidar for malaria prevention, you may not
donate for three years. Persons taking
vitamins, hormones, birth control pills, blood
pressure medication, or antibiotics for acne
may donate. For the time being, anyone at
high risk for AIDS is asked to refrain from
donating.
At the same time of donation, individuals
are screened for anemia; if anemia is found,
donation is not allowed. Screening is also
performed for hepatitis Band syphilis before
the blood is used. An additional screening
test has also been performed since July 1983
to try to identify individuals at increased risk
for AIDS. At the present time, donors will
only be notified if abnormal screening results
are obtained on repeated donations over
several months. Donating blood is also a
great way to find out your blood type!
What happens?
After a brief medical history, temperature,
blood pressure, and weight are recorded. A
small sample of blood is taken from your
finger or your ear lobe to check for blood
type and anemia. If everything is okay, you
are asked to lie down on a table or sit in a spe
cial chair. A skilled technician puts the needle
into a large vein in your arm and the blood
flows into a plastic bag. About one pint of
your blood is taken.

There is no risk of AIDS or any other infec
tion â€” the needles are disposable. The whole
process takes less than an hour. Vou will be
asked to stay 15 minutes afterward for obser
vation, juice, and cookies. There is no restric
tion on subsequent activities, though an
increased fluid intake is often recommended.
Where does the blood go?
Ninety percent of the blood taken from any
one individual is broken down into its com
ponent parts: red cells, white cells, platelets
and plasma, to be used separately. Red cells
are most often used during surgery or for se
vere anemia. Platelets are most commonly
given to those with leukemia, while plasma is
needed for burn victims and vaccine
manufacture.
The greatest consumers are cancer patients
and the elderly in general. Women use more
than men. The single condition requiring the
most transfusions is that of surgical repair of a
fractured hip, usually in women over 65.
* The rarest blood types are those in short
supply. Credits for blood donation are good
for one year and may be transferred to any of
over 2,000 hospitals in the United States.
If you would like to donate blood, you will
be welcome at the Stanford Blood Center or
the American Red Cross.
