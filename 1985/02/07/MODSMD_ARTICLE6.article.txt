of a relationship is also deter
mined by who is the leaver
and who is being left. Stress is
experienced by both sides.
The leaver tends to experience
guilt, may even be distraught,
at the damage the departure
inflicts on the person left. Not
infrequently the leaver ques
tions his/her capacity to meet
emotional obligations.
In contrast, those who are
left tend to question their abil
ity to hold the love of anyone,
the worst fears about them
selves feel realized. They then
may be quite reluctant to trust
themselves to another rela
tionship.
A final factor that can
moderate the impact of the
termination is the availability
of a new relationship. This can
reduce the stress of loss and
significantly diminish the
feelings of loneliness. The
strong support of caring
people or a new relationship
cannot deflect all the negative
emotion of a lost relationship,
but having someing to be
with, who wants to be with the
person experiencing the loss,
does appear to provide some
protection against the emo
tional assault of separation.
A lot happens in between
the beginnings and endings of
relationships. All ongoing
relationships have a cyclical
dimension to them. There are
times when we feel very close
to the partner in the relation
ship. These are the emotional
rewards and joyous periods.
At these times, very few other
things in life seem truly signifi
cant. Yet we are all familiar
with the other times in
relationships. Those times,

when even under the best of
situations, conflict seems in
evitable.
It needs to be mentioned
that conflict in itself is neither
good nor bad nor even stress
ful. It can allow tensions in
relationships to be channeled
along socially acceptable
lines. Conflict can stimulate
discussion and promote
healthy changes in relation
ships. Conflict, when caringly
resolved, can bring people
closer together.
How stress develops in
relationships is a question
worth examining. Perhaps the
most common reason involves
differences in interests. The
difference can vary from dif
ferences in musical interests
to the frequency of sex.
Another area of stress in
relationships involves differ
ences in values. To some ex
tent values are the most
encompassing element of
relationships. The individuals
in the relationship have to
negotiate the definition of
friendship, courtesy,
reciprocity, sex roles, concep
tion of a family, ways of ex
pressing affection, and
commitment. It is in this area
that one often finds some of
the stresses that do not seem
to feel resolvable.
Communication barriers are
another factor that frequently
contribute to stress in
relationships. Given our so
phisticated ways of communi
cating, even unconsciously,
we can still ask a question but
really make an accusation; or
be consoling, but really be
asking that the other person
not express his or her
feelings; or go through the

motions of listening and not
being able to recall but a few
words of what was said. How
often have two people dis
cussed a common event, but
made it sound like they were
at two completely different
locations?
Dependence on the other
person in the relationship can
often become a source of
stress. When one person
relies on another for the per
formance of a task or for the
provision of a needed
resource, major disappoint
ments frequently develop.
The person being depended
on can feel resentful of the
pressure, while the person
who is dependent can feel
angry when the other does not
come through.
Sometimes stress in
relationships is the result of
prior unresolved conflicts.
The more unresolved conflicts
there are in a relationship, the
greater current ones are likely
to become. It is not unusual to
find a whole history of un
resolved conflicts played out
on issues as simple as who
washes the the dishes or who
cleans the clothes.
It is also not unusual to have
external pressure put serious
strains on relationships. The
external pressure can intensify
what may otherwise be simple
to manage relationship
stresses or it can create new
ones. What is unfortunate
about this type of pressure is
that frequently individuals
cannot or do not identify the
cost the external pressures ex
act on the relationship and
begin to doubt the purpose or
significance of the relation
ship. It is like blaming the con

sequence for the problem.
They become disappointed
when the relationship does
not become the refuge they
may desperately need and
become angry not at the rea
son whey they even need such
refuge, but at the fact that the
other person appears so recal
citrant in providing it for
them.
At Stanford, the external
pressures on relationships of
students are innumerable.
There are severe financial and
housing shortages facing
many students, academic pre
ssures and responsibilities,
unexpected health problems,
and the simple but time
demanding daily maintenance
chores to name a few. These
pressures frequently take our
attention away from the
people we care for. We con
tinue to expect so much from
them, when we have so little
to give ourselves. Sometimes
we are so busy dealing with
our own personal pressures
that we fail to see how much
we are needed or when the

other person is hurting and
vulnerable.
While it's difficult to give an
overall strategy for minimizing
the negative aspects of stress
in relationships, a few sugges
tions may be helpful.
• To improve communication,
develop more emphatic listen
ing skills, more exact ways of
being heard and understood.
• Focus upon defeating the
problems rather than each
other.
• Accept conflict as helpful,
providing it does not elicit
threat or defensiveness.
• Seek facts to resolve dilem
mas, but first attend to
feelings.
• Make it a collective respon
sibility to be open and honest
about facts, opinions, and
feelings.
• Look for solutions that
achieve your goals, the goals
of the other person and those
that are acceptable to both of
you.
