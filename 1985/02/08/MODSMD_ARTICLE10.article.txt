Governor raps Bird ills
Decisions by the California Supreme Court are
hurting California's economy, and business
leaders should "make the connection" between
the cost of doing business in California and the
retention vote on Chief Justice Rose Bird next
year. Gov. George Deukmejian said yesterday.
The Republican governor refused to cite any
specific decision by Bird's court, saying instead
there were numerous examples, and that the
court has a nationwide reputation for
"excessively liberal" rulings, which he said were
bad for business and the economy.
Deukmejian — a longtime critic of the court's
rulings for defendants' rights in criminal cases —

attacked the court's record on government
regulation of business before a symposium of
business executives at St. Mary's College and ex
panded his criticism in an impromptu news con
ference.
"While we often concentrate on decisions of
the court in the criminal law field , . . the deci
sions that are made by that court have also made
it far more difficult for businesses to operate in
California," Deukmejian told the 250 business
executives.
Deukmejian said he was concerned about
"burdensome and onerous" Supreme Court
rulings that "have an impact on the way in which
you are able to do business in the state, especially

Compiled from the Associated Press and Los Angeles Times/Washington Post wire services

an impact on the cost ot doing business here."
Questioned later by reporters, Deukmejian
declined several times to Cite any specific court
decision except to say "there are a number of
them. . . . I m not going to attempt at this point to
specify them."
Today's weather
Rain will hit the Stanford area today, becom
ing heavy at times, then turning showery and
decreasing tonight. Chance of showers tomorrow
morning, then partly cloudy. South winds will in
crease to 15-25 mph. Highs in the 5()s; lows in
