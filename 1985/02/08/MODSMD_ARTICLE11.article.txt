## Doty bridges town-gown gap Stanford land use a 'sticky wicket' in community relations 
### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
"How does a major university rec
oncile its needs with the claims and
wishes of its neighbors?"
That, says Andy Doty, is a problem
that has intrigued him for the past 20
years. A good thing, too, since it is
Doty's job to answer that question.
Doty, as Stanford's director of
community relations, is one of the
main links between the University
and neighboring towns. He compares
his duties to those of an antenna: He
scans the town-gown airwaves, pick
ing up what one party says and trans
mitting that message to a second
party. For Doty, this means he is en 7
gaged in constant dialogue with plan
ners, council members and dis
gruntled citizens from Palo Alto,
Menlo Park, Ladera, Portola Valley
and a handful of other Peninsula
towns.
"We are a big entity with the po
tential to harm our neighbors," Doty
explains. " It's not politically realistic
to say, 'We can do whatever we
want.' " Thus, Doty says he does "an
awful lot of extra work" organizing
and participating in community
meetings, hearings and forums de
signed to explain to others what Stan
ford's intentions are as well as to elicit
feedback on these plans.
"We just bend ourselves over
backward. I wish our neighbors
realized the degree to which we go to
accommodate them," he says."I
think we bend ourselves into a pretzel
sometimes trying to be a good neigh
bor."
Doty shines in this role as liaison
between the city and the University,
says Anne Weatherspoon, a 10-year
member of the Palo Alto City Coun
cil. "I've never known Andy to tell us
something without asking us how we
feel about it," she said.
Over the years, Doty's job has
boiled down to the specific issue of
land use and development. How
Stanford proposes to use its 8,800

acres is the "sticky wicket" in rela
tions between the University and its
neighbors, he says. The way Doty
sees it, Palo Alto would like to exert
greater control over Stanford's unin
corporated lands, but the University
is unwilling to give "veto power" to
any outside body.
"There's sort of an unseen tug-of
war that goes on between the Univer
sity and its neighbors, the University
wanting to demonstrate that it
handles its lands properly and for
good purpose, and certain neighbors
wishing that they had a greater voice
in how we use our land," he said.
In the middle of this tug-of-war
stands Andy Doty, playing the role of
antenna.

'I think we bend ourselves into a
pretzel sometimes trying to be a good
neighbor.'

"I owe it to the University to take a
hard look at our neighbors. We can
not shrug off their attitude and simply
say, 'That's provincialism,' or 'That's
selfishness,' " says Doty, a former Air
Force bomber-turned-journalist with
a weathered face and rugged features
that attest to his love of the outdoors.
At 59, Doty is completing his 22nd
year in Stanford's public relations of
fice. Sitting behind a large, impec
cably neat black desk in his office in
Building 170 of the Quad, he
talks comfortably and candidly about
what the future bodes for the Univer
sity and the community. With the
tools of his trade — telephone, dic
tionary and word processor — all
within easy reach, Doty discusses the
main points of contention between
Stanford and Palo Alto in recent
years: the Stanford West housing

project, the Sand Hill Road extension
and plans for the 86 acres of unincor
porated University land across from
the Oak Creek housing complex on
Sand Hill Road.
Doty has been in the thick of each
of these proposals, often following
them from the University's planning
department to Palo Alto's staff, ar
chitectural review board, planning
commission and city council, and then
sometimes back to Stanford's plan
ners.
"It's an enormous, complicated,
lengthy process in this area to do a
project of any magnitude," Doty said.
" We think the city gets a little too fas
tidious in its attention to what we do.
What we do does affect them, but not

as much as they think."
With the strains of Beethoven from
Doty's office stereo wafting softly in
the background, Doty offers insight
into the University's position on some
of the major land issues.
• Stanford West: "They (Palo Alto)
want it and we want it and it's time to
move ahead. . . . We don't want to
get in the same situation we were in
before, where there's some misun
derstanding on the city's part as to
what the University's intentions are."
• Sand Hill Road extension: "They
(backers of a Menlo Park citizens'
lawsuit that claims the extension
ignores their interests) are deter
mined to pursue this thing. They
don't want Stanford West and they
don't want the road. They see the two
of them as linked, 1 think." (Doty in
sists on calling the corridor "Willow

Road" despite the name change ap
proved by the Palo Alto City Council
last September. Says he:"I don't
believe in semantics.")
• Eighty-six acres of unincorporated
land on Sand Hill Road: "The city
has it in its mind that the acreage
poses some dire threat to the commu
nity. We keep arguing that that's
hardly the case, that it's not another
industrial park. ... I think they are
going to be quite reassured to find
that what we're projecting is far less
threatening than what they fear."
• Ronald Reagan Presidential Li
brary: "It's not going to be as contro
versial as people thought initially."
Doty claims that sometimes he
can't understand those people who
categorically resist any Stanford
developments. For example, he notes
the irony in opposing the Stanford
Hospital Modernization Plan, the En
vironmental Safety Facility and Stan
ford West. "What those neighbors
arc basically saying is: Don't
modernize your hospital, don't han
dle your toxic waste properly and
don't build badly needed housing."
Nevertheless, despite these traces
of bitterness, Doty points to a recent
survey claiming that 90 percent of
Palo Alto and Menlo Park residents
recognize the University's contribu
tion to the community. Doty agrees
that Stanford is well-regarded by
most of its neighbors, and he'd like to
correct any misperceptions harbored
by the rest.
"What I want to do is demonstrate
in many, many ways that the Univer
sity provides open space, it provides
revenue, it provides high standards, it
provides jobs, it is involved in so
many ways that offset the negatives
that arise now and then," Doty says.
"And I sincerely believe that."
The topic is important to Doty, and
he leans forward in his chair, dicing
his desk with light karate chops for
emphasis. Dressed casually in a blue
button-down shirt and blue crew neck
sweater to match his bright blue eyes,

the former New Yorker sips a cup of
coffee as he explains why he believes
the University is not being the ogre
that some claim it is.
"If I were working for a commer
cial land developer who was destroy
ing the landscape for private profit, I
might not feel as good about it as I
do," he says. "But I feel the Univer
sity's record is so good in inheriting
8,800 acres of land and utilizing only
one-third of it and leaving the
remainder open. I think it's
reasonable to go ahead and use some
of that property for highly worthwhile

purposes, and with high standards."
While relations between the Uni
versity and its neighbors are "a lot
better than they were," Doty admits
that he spends a portion of each day
defending Stanford and trying to ex
plain its actions to angry callers and
visitors.
For example, in one recent.week,
Doty handled calls from local resi
dents demanding that he do some
thing about the trucks on Embar
cadero Road, lambasting the Univer-
