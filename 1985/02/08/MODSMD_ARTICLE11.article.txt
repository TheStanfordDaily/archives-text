## Doty bridges town-gown gap Stanford land use a 'sticky wicket' in community relations 
### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
"How does a major university rec
oncile its needs with the claims and
wishes of its neighbors?"
That, says Andy Doty, is a problem
that has intrigued him for the past 20
years. A good thing, too, since it is
Doty's job to answer that question.
Doty, as Stanford's director of
community relations, is one of the
main links between the University
and neighboring towns. He compares
his duties to those of an antenna: He
scans the town-gown airwaves, pick
ing up what one party says and trans
mitting that message to a second
party. For Doty, this means he is en 7
gaged in constant dialogue with plan
ners, council members and dis
gruntled citizens from Palo Alto,
Menlo Park, Ladera, Portola Valley
and a handful of other Peninsula
towns.
"We are a big entity with the po
tential to harm our neighbors," Doty
explains. " It's not politically realistic
to say, 'We can do whatever we
want.' " Thus, Doty says he does "an
awful lot of extra work" organizing
and participating in community
meetings, hearings and forums de
signed to explain to others what Stan
ford's intentions are as well as to elicit
feedback on these plans.
"We just bend ourselves over
backward. I wish our neighbors
realized the degree to which we go to
accommodate them," he says."I
think we bend ourselves into a pretzel
sometimes trying to be a good neigh
bor."
Doty shines in this role as liaison
between the city and the University,
says Anne Weatherspoon, a 10-year
member of the Palo Alto City Coun
cil. "I've never known Andy to tell us
something without asking us how we
feel about it," she said.
Over the years, Doty's job has
boiled down to the specific issue of
land use and development. How
Stanford proposes to use its 8,800

acres is the "sticky wicket" in rela
tions between the University and its
neighbors, he says. The way Doty
sees it, Palo Alto would like to exert
greater control over Stanford's unin
corporated lands, but the University
is unwilling to give "veto power" to
any outside body.
"There's sort of an unseen tug-of
war that goes on between the Univer
sity and its neighbors, the University
wanting to demonstrate that it
handles its lands properly and for
good purpose, and certain neighbors
wishing that they had a greater voice
in how we use our land," he said.
In the middle of this tug-of-war
stands Andy Doty, playing the role of
antenna.

'I think we bend ourselves into a
pretzel sometimes trying to be a good
neighbor.'

"I owe it to the University to take a
hard look at our neighbors. We can
not shrug off their attitude and simply
say, 'That's provincialism,' or 'That's
selfishness,' " says Doty, a former Air
Force bomber-turned-journalist with
a weathered face and rugged features
that attest to his love of the outdoors.
At 59, Doty is completing his 22nd
year in Stanford's public relations of
fice. Sitting behind a large, impec
cably neat black desk in his office in
Building 170 of the Quad, he
talks comfortably and candidly about
what the future bodes for the Univer
sity and the community. With the
tools of his trade — telephone, dic
tionary and word processor — all
within easy reach, Doty discusses the
main points of contention between
Stanford and Palo Alto in recent
years: the Stanford West housing

project, the Sand Hill Road extension
and plans for the 86 acres of unincor
porated University land across from
the Oak Creek housing complex on
Sand Hill Road.
Doty has been in the thick of each
of these proposals, often following
them from the University's planning
department to Palo Alto's staff, ar
chitectural review board, planning
commission and city council, and then
sometimes back to Stanford's plan
ners.
"It's an enormous, complicated,
lengthy process in this area to do a
project of any magnitude," Doty said.
" We think the city gets a little too fas
tidious in its attention to what we do.
What we do does affect them, but not

as much as they think."
With the strains of Beethoven from
Doty's office stereo wafting softly in
the background, Doty offers insight
into the University's position on some
of the major land issues.
• Stanford West: "They (Palo Alto)
want it and we want it and it's time to
move ahead. . . . We don't want to
get in the same situation we were in
before, where there's some misun
derstanding on the city's part as to
what the University's intentions are."
• Sand Hill Road extension: "They
(backers of a Menlo Park citizens'
lawsuit that claims the extension
ignores their interests) are deter
mined to pursue this thing. They
don't want Stanford West and they
don't want the road. They see the two
of them as linked, 1 think." (Doty in
sists on calling the corridor "Willow

Road" despite the name change ap
proved by the Palo Alto City Council
last September. Says he:"I don't
believe in semantics.")
• Eighty-six acres of unincorporated
land on Sand Hill Road: "The city
has it in its mind that the acreage
poses some dire threat to the commu
nity. We keep arguing that that's
hardly the case, that it's not another
industrial park. ... I think they are
going to be quite reassured to find
that what we're projecting is far less
threatening than what they fear."
• Ronald Reagan Presidential Li
brary: "It's not going to be as contro
versial as people thought initially."
Doty claims that sometimes he
can't understand those people who
categorically resist any Stanford
developments. For example, he notes
the irony in opposing the Stanford
Hospital Modernization Plan, the En
vironmental Safety Facility and Stan
ford West. "What those neighbors
arc basically saying is: Don't
modernize your hospital, don't han
dle your toxic waste properly and
don't build badly needed housing."
Nevertheless, despite these traces
of bitterness, Doty points to a recent
survey claiming that 90 percent of
Palo Alto and Menlo Park residents
recognize the University's contribu
tion to the community. Doty agrees
that Stanford is well-regarded by
most of its neighbors, and he'd like to
correct any misperceptions harbored
by the rest.
"What I want to do is demonstrate
in many, many ways that the Univer
sity provides open space, it provides
revenue, it provides high standards, it
provides jobs, it is involved in so
many ways that offset the negatives
that arise now and then," Doty says.
"And I sincerely believe that."
The topic is important to Doty, and
he leans forward in his chair, dicing
his desk with light karate chops for
emphasis. Dressed casually in a blue
button-down shirt and blue crew neck
sweater to match his bright blue eyes,

the former New Yorker sips a cup of
coffee as he explains why he believes
the University is not being the ogre
that some claim it is.
"If I were working for a commer
cial land developer who was destroy
ing the landscape for private profit, I
might not feel as good about it as I
do," he says. "But I feel the Univer
sity's record is so good in inheriting
8,800 acres of land and utilizing only
one-third of it and leaving the
remainder open. I think it's
reasonable to go ahead and use some
of that property for highly worthwhile

purposes, and with high standards."
While relations between the Uni
versity and its neighbors are "a lot
better than they were," Doty admits
that he spends a portion of each day
defending Stanford and trying to ex
plain its actions to angry callers and
visitors.
For example, in one recent.week,
Doty handled calls from local resi
dents demanding that he do some
thing about the trucks on Embar
cadero Road, lambasting the Univer-

sity for hosting the Super Bowl and
explaining why the University would
be sued over a particular land-use
decision.
"It can be irritating, frankly, that
people can be so self-centered that
they can't put up with inconveniences
now and then," he said. "Sometimes I
wish people would express some grat
itude over the use of our lands for
recreational purposes instead of damn
ing us for using them for our aca
demic needs."
Reclining in his swivel chair and
crossing his arms behind his head.
Doty listens to each question care
fully before leaning forward, with his
elbows resting on the desk, and
delivering his answer. In responding,
he scans the walls of his office,

decorated with large framed photos
of artistic mountain scenes and beau
tiful sunsets, searching his mind for
the dates and details of each land-use
decision. Frequently, he refers to the
color map of Stanford on his desk
blotter, tracing routes and outlining
parcels of land with the cap end of a
pen that rarely leaves his hand, a
throwback to his days as a journalist.
In fact, it was a love of writing that
propelled Doty into his current job.
After a two-year stint in the Air
Force, Doty studied at St. Lawrence
University in upstate New York,
where he majored in English and
wrote for campus magazines, the stu
dent newspaper and the sports infor
mation office. In 1950 he married his
high school sweetheart and took a job
as a reporter for the Watertown Times
in its Canton, N.Y., bureau. He re
entered the world of higher education
in 1952, working in general publicity
at Johns Hopkins University. A few

years later he landed a job at the Uni
versity of Michigan as a science and
engineering editor. There he met
Lyle Nelson, now a communication
professor at Stanford, and Bob
Beyers, now the director of the Stan
ford News Service. In 1963, he fol
lowed Nelson and Beyers to Stanford,
and he's never regretted the move.
"I wanted the two best men on the
University of Michigan public infor
mation staff with me," Nelson recalls.
"One was Bob Beyers . . . and the
other ,vas Andy Doty. I've known
Andy for 20 years and have great
respect for him. He's the best possible
person for this job," Nelson says.
Doty says the Stanford offer was
one that he could not refuse. "I took
a look at the map and realized that if I
don't go west and Muir Woods
and San Francisco and Monterey and
Yosemite, I'm absolutely crazy."
He and his wife, Eleanor, both avid
hikers and campers, take advantage

of California's natural beauty every
summer, when Doty takes a month
off and the couple heads for the hills
— usually the Sierras or the
Cascades.
"I just love the high country," he
said. "There's nothing better than to
be out there in that clean air, looking
at the mountains. There's something
very peaceful and rewarding about
it."
That peace serves as a counter to
the sometimes hectic pace of Doty's
job. Doty says that, in the course of
dealing with the people and problems
that go along with his position as
director of community relations, he
has learned a few things. Among the
most valuable of these lessons, he
says, is to be "open and considerate"
when discussing the issues.
"We adopted a policy long ago to
be as open and forthcoming as we can
in dealing with our neighbors, and I
think that's paid off," he says.

Doty's style has apparently paid off
as well. Former and current Palo Alto
residents and politicians — even
those who have vehemently opposed
Stanford's development policies —
have nothing but kudos for Andv
Doty.
Alan Henderson, a member of the
Palo Alto City Council for 10 years
and mayor for two and a half, says
Doty's calm demeanor is his greatest
asset. Henderson, who has known
Doty on both a professional and per
sonal level for almost 15 years, recalls
that Doty has even "stepped in and
saved the day" on some of the more
"sticky issues."
Weatherspoon, another 10-year
member of the Palo Alto City Coun
cil, commends Doty's public relations
skills "in this specialized area of local
politics."
"There are some very volatile per
sonalities in this community, and I
don't know of anybody who doesn't

respect Andy," Weatherspoon said.
"His is a very tough job. It takes a lot
of sensitivity."
Jim Culpepper, a Palo Alto resi
dent who frequently finds himself on
the opposite side of the fence from
Doty, agrees.
"1 think he's an excellent salesman
for the University," Culpepper says.
"I don't think anyone could articulate
what Stanford wants better. Per
sonally, he's affable, easy to get along
with ... a real prince of a guy. 1 just
don't happen to agree with him."
Culpepper, who has been highly
critical of Stanford's "inflexibility" in
land and development related issues,
says Doty "is the best thing they
(Stanford) have going for them."
Yet Doty maintains he just wants
to represent Stanford fairly to its
neighbors, i think if you really look
at the record, you'll find that the good
the University has done far outweighs
the bad," he says.
