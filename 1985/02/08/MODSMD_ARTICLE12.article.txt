Now that the Stanford community knows the
ASSU has been waging a "confidential" cam
paign to put together a bid to operate the Tresid
der Union Coffee House for another five years,
it's important to put a few things in perspective.
Given the uncertain performance of the Coffee
House since the initiation of student management
in 1980, the ASSU should conduct periodic con
sultations with independent experts in restaurant
management before the current five-year con
tract expires Aug. 31. Coffee House leaders say
mistakes in the previous contract and poor man
agement in the fall of 1982 are largely to blame
for the restaurant's current woes.
Professionals with firsthand knowledge of res
taurant operations might help ease the deficit
without compromising the student-management
structure on which the Coffee House is based.
With a better consultation system in place, the
ASSU would be in a stronger position to deter
mine whether entering another bid is really a
good idea.
If the ASSU then decides it still wants to bid,
keeping the actual proposal secret would be key.
Exposing the inner workings of the bid package
could be a real break for the competition. And
the bidding could be stiff: Servomation Inc.,

which already holds a big chunk of the Tresidder
concession, has already expressed an interest in
the Coffee House.
But there's a crucial difference between
keeping a bid quiet and deliberately shielding the
community from information it has a right to
know.
Something is fundamentally wrong when
secrecy extends to a student corporation's profit
loss record. Students help pay for the Coffee
House. Students deserve to know when the Cof
fee House is losing money.
Writing off those losses by allowing students to
subsidize unknowingly a business that has come
up $80,000 short over the past four-and-a-half
years would be, to put it politely, just a bit dis
honest.
Most government organizations openly report
on their finances; we should expect nothing less
from the ASSU. It's not enough for Coffee
House operations to be buried in a "public
record" that many members of the community
don't even know exists.
In its zeal to shut up, the ASSU threatens to
shut out the same students who are still paying, at
least in part, for mistakes that originated in the
halls of the ASSU.
