## Committee report libelous to faculty members, departments 
### 
(The following letter was sent to all members
of the Faculty Senate last week.)
A joint Hoover-Stanford group appointed
by the president of the University to consider
ways of "strengthening" ties with Hoover has
issued a report that many members of the fac
ulty believe is libelous.
The report accuses faculty members and
departments of opposing past efforts at
greater "cooperation" with Hoover on per
sonal, political and unprofessional grounds.

VIEWPOINT

Upon its release, the president called the
report "excellent," "thoughtful and thor
ough," but plans to implement its recommen
dations were delayed pending senate
discussion (Campus Report, Dec. 5, 1984).
The president may be expected to disassociate
himself from those parts of the report that
question the integrity of individual faculty
members and departments. But there are
larger issues for the Faculty Senate to con
sider than the personal charges of the
Hoover-Stanford group.
We are writing to ask whether the Faculty
Senate should merely stand by when faculty
members are attacked and possibly libeled in
official University reports. The faculty mem
bers and departments that are held up for
public criticism in the report may have the
right to be heard on such charges, and a com
mittee of the Faculty Senate may be the ap
propriate vehicle for such a hearing.
We further suggest that the senate ask the
question of how much confidence we should
place in the conclusions of a group whose own
procedures may impeach the recommen
dations which it reaches.
Finally, we suggest that the senate commit
tee should study the broader issues involved
with administration proposals for more joint
appointments and cooperation with the
Hoover Institution, and thereby help prepare
the ground for full senate discussion of the
administration's objectives.
The issue of Hoover is made more pressing
by the release of the institution's 1984
"Annual Report."
This report, as is true of earlier reports,
details the extensive political connections of
the institution and describes how it was trans
formed from a library and archive into one of
the country's leading (conservative) think
tanks.

When a similar report was issued two years
ago, it led to a senate call for a study by the
Board of Trustees. Enough time has passed to
show that the administration and the Board of
Trustees do not intend to hold public hearings
on, or even consider, the question of the pro
priety of Hoover's alleged political activities.
The time has come for a representative com
mittee of the senate to study the evidence on
Hoover's political activities and advise this
community on the wisdom of closer relations
between the two institutions.
The Ward Committee report
Given the heavy representation of Hoover
on the Ward committee, it is hardly surprising
that it would call for more joint appointments
and cooperation with Stanford. What is
surprising and not a little ironic is that it at
tacks individual faculty and departments in
the process. The method is that of invidious
comparison:
It is also the case that the relationship
where joint appointments l are concerned
has varied by departments. The Sociology
Department, for example, has been syste
matically and deliberately apolitical and
goal-oriented in its institutional dealings
with Hoover, and has reaped very sub
stantial benefits from the resulting rela
tionship. The attitudes of most other units,
such as the Economics Department or the
Graduate School of Business, have been
friendly and professional. The principal
exceptions have been the Political Sci
ence Department and, less notably, the
History Department, where the relation
ship has been acrimonious at times, with
some members opposing any association
with Hoover (Campus Report, Dec. 5,
1984, emphasis added).
These are, of course, extremely serious
charges to bring against departments. But the
report also criticizes individual members of
the faculty for making "personal objections"
to Hoover appointments, and former depart
ment chairmen are said by persons at Hoover
to have practiced "evasion" in handling
Hoover requests for appointments.
The Ward Committee, to its credit, has
publicly apologized to one senior member of
the Political Science Department who felt
defamed in the report, and it has issued a
clarification of its intentions regarding other

parts of the report.
The Faculty Senate should realize,
however, that the chairman of the Political
Science Department asked the Ward Com
mittee to retract publicly the paragraph
quoted above, and the committee has refused.
Members of the Faculty Senate might want
to consider how they would feel if their de
partments were singled out for such criticism
in a report to the Board of Trustees. It is obvi
ously true that, if such a committee can
prepare a one-sided attack on the Political
Science Department and the History Depart
ment, it can do it to any department. Indeed,
the Ward Committee does precisely that
when it reports Hoover grievances (but not
departmental responses) over courtesy and
joint appointments that have not been offered
Hoover scholars. Departments singled out by
way of illustration include Sociology, Eco
nomics, Political Science, Philosophy and
Physics (Campus Report, Dec. 5, 1984).
If no action is taken to correct the Ward
report's allegations against faculty members
and departments of this university, Stanford's
official records will forever contain a report
that brands these colleagues as unprofessional
in their dealings with Hoover. A senate com
mittee on the Hoover Institution would not
only give your colleagues a chance to answer
the charges against them; it might lead the
senate to consider such steps as the adoption
of a senate resolution disavowing such
practices. Such a study and resolution would
help clear the good name of those faculty
aggrieved by the Ward report.
Cooperating with Hoover
When the Ward report was first discussed
by the Faculty Senate, Prof. Eric Berg,
noting reports that Hoover might use political
criteria in making appointments, asked if it
were not inappropriate to encourage more
joint appointments unless the answer to these
reports is clearly no. He was told by the presi
dent that the Ward Committee was not in
tended to get into such questions, but all this
does is leave the general question un
answered.
Unless such questions are addressed, how
can we know how close and cooperative we
want to be with Hoover? What, in short, is the
nature of the institution with which the Uni
versity wants closer ties?
If the answer to this question is that
Hoover is a research institution with a mis

sion, then many people are not sure it should
be on a college campus at all, let alone more
closely linked to the University.
What, if any, is the evidence that Hoover
has a mission, and if it has a mission, how
threatening is this mission to the University's
reputation for nonpartisanship and objec
tivity?
These are precisely the questions that could
be addressed by a senate committee on
Hoover. When the Ward report was released,
the University news service announced that
greaier cooperation with Hoover could be
promoted without any "dramatic re-adjust
ments" in University policies or the
"autonomy of Hoover" (University News
Service, Nov. 30, 1984). The administration,
which defines the problem of Hoover as one
of governance, not severance, has yet to
produce specific recommendations for
changes in Hoover's governance. It may be
that no dramatic changes in Hoover's gover
nance are necessary. But how are we to know
unless we ask? And, more important, how is
the community to know unless the question is
asked publicly before a responsible forum of
this university?
The administration and the Board of Trus
tees do not feel that these questions need to
be asked publicly, nor do they feel that the
study oifgftially called for by the senate re
quires a public report on fears that Hoover's
political activities might endanger the Univer
sity's reputation and legitimacy. But many
faculty members feel otherwise.
So far the administration's response has
been to deny that there is a problem with
Hoover's political activities. The president
dismissed the second faculty petition as a
"cure in search of a disease" (remarks before
the Faculty Senate, Feb. 23, 1984).
But denials of a problem do not refute the
evidence that a problem exists; they simply
ignore it. Over the past two years, a great deal
of evidence has been presented that the
Hoover Institution does have a mission, that it
is well connected politically at the national
level, and that it has earned its reputation in
the press as one of the leading conservative
think tanks in the country.
This is not the place to review this evidence,
but members of the Faculty Senate, in consid
ering the appropriateness of a committee on
Hoover, might want to recall that Herbert
Hoover thought the institution had a mission.
"The purpose of this institution," he said in

1959, "must be, by its research and publica
tions, to demonstrate the evils of the doctrines
of Karl Marx — whether Communism,
Socialism, economic materialism, or at
heism. . . . (The Daily. April 19, 1983). Sen
ate members might also wish to pick up the
1984 Hoover "Annual Report," in which
Director W. Glenn Campbell recounts the
growth of Hoover from an institution with six
fellows to one with 70, and proudly cites its
many connections with the Reagan adminis
tration.
In this regard it is significant that President
Reagan has no trouble understanding what
seems to elude many people at Stanford,
namely that Hoover is heavily implicated in
politics. Last month, at a reception for
Hoover's Board of Overseers, he said:
"Politics, as much as anything else, is a battle
of ideas, and it was ideas — many of them
originating at the Hoover Institution — that
helped to overthrow what (Hoover Senior
Fellow) Milton Friedman has called the
'tyranny of the status quo' " (Hoover Institu
tion press release, Jan. 18, 1985).
To date, the Faculty Senate has held public
hearings on the Reagan library, but it has yet
to study the general problem of Hoover. That
there is a problem seems undeniable. Even
the president came close to acknowledging
the special character of Hoover when he an
nounced opposition to Hoover's control of
the proposed Ronald Reagan Center for
Public Affairs. He spoke then of the need for
assuring "both the fact and the appearance of
political neutrality. ..." (University News
Service, March 13, 1984).
I hat need still exists. When the Faculty
Senate first went on record favoring a study,
the administration talked about the possibility
ol appointing an eminent visiting committee
or perhaps a representative in-house commit
tee. Instead, it chose to handle the issue
inside the Board of Trustees, and not hold
public hearings. The only hope that remains
for an objective study of Hoover and an in
formed discussion of Hoover's real nature is
the Faculty Senate. If the Ward report and
Hoover's continuing political involvement
induce the senate to establish such a commit
tee, we may yet be permitted to ask and an
swer questions about the kind of institution
Hoover is, and whether we really want to get
closer to it.
