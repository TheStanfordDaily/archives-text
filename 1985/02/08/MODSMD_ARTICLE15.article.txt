# Did you ever wonder why Andy Rooney wonders about what he always wonders?
## 
### 
You ever wonder how Andy Rooney makes a
living? Every Sunday on "60 Minutes" this odd
looking man comes on the tube and poses
ridiculous questions.
You ever wonder why your middle finger is
longer than your second and your fourth? You ever
wonder why they call them stands when you actu
ally sit in them? Did you ever wonder why toilet
seats are round and not square?
Did you ever notice that he never waits for a
response?
The truth is. 1 never wondered.
OK. That's not completely true. Sure I wondered
what the median was like on the chem test that I
got a 13 on. and yes. I wondered when the Mets
were next going to win a World Series, and I even
wondered what today's fro-yo flavor was at the
Corner Pocket .. . hut that's as far as I'll go.
For me, there's a finite number of things about
which I care to wonder. As to the rest. I couldn't
care less.
But for argument's sake, let's take a look at the
other side of the coin. Maybe Andy Rooney actu
ally wonders about these things. Maybe Andy
Rooney stays awake nights just wondering (ever
wonder what his wife does?). Maybe wondering is
like a disease that only Andy Rooney has. Let's see
if we can imagine what poor Andy's day must be
like.
7:30 a.m. Andy awakes. Andy's psyched to
wonder. Andy wonders what he can wonder about
first.
Andy goes to the bathroom. He starts with an
easy one. Andy wonders which way the toilet paper
is supposed to face. Oh forget it. Andy. Leave that

to Ann Landers.
Andy gets dressed. He puts on his tie. Andy
wonders who invented the tie. Ever wonder why he
couldn't have come up with a more original name
than "tie?"
Andy eats breakfast: coffee, scrambled eggs and
toast. Ever wonder how come when you put bread

■ . ii if in Wi l
in a toaster and it comes out they call it toast, but
when you put a pop-tart in a toaster and it comes
out. it's still a pop-tart?
8:30 a.m. Andy arrives at work. Andy's secre
tary greets him with a cheerful "Good morning."
Ever wonder why the secretary always greets you
with a cheerful "Good morning." no matter how
Godawful your day has been so far?
She then informs him of his lunch date with Mr.
Rogers (Ever wonder how he makes a living? Can
you spell "wonder"?). As Andy heads to his office,
his secretary yells that he should "break a leg."
Ever wonder what she would feel like if he actually
broke a leg?
11:00 a.m. Andy's at home now. He sits at his desk

and observes all that is in front of him. Ever
wonder why they call them paper clips if they're not
paper? Ever wonder why they call them silver dol
lars if they're not silver?
It appears Andy's disease is getting worse. Andy
turns on the TV so that he can escape into some
show which will put his mind to rest. As "The
Tonight Show" appears on the screen, Andy feels
the need to wonder one last time. Ever wonder why
they call it"The Tonight Show" if 50 percent of the
time it was filmed years ago?
11:45 p.m. Andy falls into a deep sleep. Only now
can Andy escape from the plight that plagues him.
Only now can Andy rest comfortably without
feeling the need to wonder about what's going on
around him.
Only after reading about such a harrowing day
can one actually feel sorry for poor Andy. One
begins to wonder what terrible mental anguish
Andy will have to endure in the upcoming years.
Perhaps we should all feel pity for poor Andy.
Maybe we should honor and respect Andy for the
gracious way he has accepted his misfortune and
kept up his cheerful facade for all these long,
loathsome years.
On the other hand, maybe Andy is completely
well, both physically and mentally. Could it be that
Andy seeks pleasure in cluttering our senses with
hoards of trivial queries that only deter the use of
our minds from more important questions. Could it
be that Andy "gets off' on this sort of mental tor
ment.
Did you ever wonder. . . ?

7:30 a.m. Andy awakes. Andy's psyched to
wonder. Andy wonders what he can wonder about
first.
Andy goes to the bathroom. He starts with an
easy one. Andy wonders which way the toilet paper
is supposed to face. Oh forget it. Andy. Leave that

to Ann Landers.
Andy gets dressed. He puts on his tie. Andy
wonders who invented the tie. Ever wonder why he
couldn't have come up with a more original name
than "tie?"
Andy eats breakfast: coffee, scrambled eggs and
toast. Ever wonder how come when you put bread

■ . ii if in Wi l
in a toaster and it comes out they call it toast, but
when you put a pop-tart in a toaster and it comes
out. it's still a pop-tart?
8:30 a.m. Andy arrives at work. Andy's secre
tary greets him with a cheerful "Good morning."
Ever wonder why the secretary always greets you
with a cheerful "Good morning." no matter how
Godawful your day has been so far?
She then informs him of his lunch date with Mr.
Rogers (Ever wonder how he makes a living? Can
you spell "wonder"?). As Andy heads to his office,
his secretary yells that he should "break a leg."
Ever wonder what she would feel like if he actually
broke a leg?
11:00 a.m. Andy's at home now. He sits at his desk

and observes all that is in front of him. Ever
wonder why they call them paper clips if they're not
paper? Ever wonder why they call them silver dol
lars if they're not silver?
It appears Andy's disease is getting worse. Andy
turns on the TV so that he can escape into some
show which will put his mind to rest. As "The
Tonight Show" appears on the screen, Andy feels
the need to wonder one last time. Ever wonder why
they call it"The Tonight Show" if 50 percent of the
time it was filmed years ago?
11:45 p.m. Andy falls into a deep sleep. Only now
can Andy escape from the plight that plagues him.
Only now can Andy rest comfortably without
feeling the need to wonder about what's going on
around him.
Only after reading about such a harrowing day
can one actually feel sorry for poor Andy. One
begins to wonder what terrible mental anguish
Andy will have to endure in the upcoming years.
Perhaps we should all feel pity for poor Andy.
Maybe we should honor and respect Andy for the
gracious way he has accepted his misfortune and
kept up his cheerful facade for all these long,
loathsome years.
On the other hand, maybe Andy is completely
well, both physically and mentally. Could it be that
Andy seeks pleasure in cluttering our senses with
hoards of trivial queries that only deter the use of
our minds from more important questions. Could it
be that Andy "gets off' on this sort of mental tor
ment.
Did you ever wonder. . . ?
