## Arizona hands Card 3rd straight loss 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
TUCSON, Ariz. — The Stanford men's bas
ketball team last night played well, shot poorly
and lost. Again.
In what has become more of a trend than
simple consequence, Stanford lost, 68-56, to
Arizona here because it shot poorly. Never
mind that the Cardinal was equal or better than
the Wildcats in every other statistical category.
Arizona shot 56 percent from the floor. Stan
ford, after shooting 57 percent in the first half,
finished the game at 42 percent. Arizona wins,
Stanford loses. No detectives needed to solve
this mystery.
The loss evened Stanford's overall record at
10-10 and left it alone in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence basement at 2-8. Washington State, which
had been tied with Stanford, climbed into ninth
place with a 66-58 overtime victor) over UCLA
last night.
Arizona, meanwhile, upped its overall mark
to 16-6 and remained tied for second place at 7-
3. USC defeated Washington 61-50 last night to
hold its one-game lead in the Pac-10.
"I thought we played pretty well," Davis told
reporters after last night's loss, the Cardinal's
fifth double-figure defeat in conference play.
"We did some nice things, especially in the first
half. We just couldn't quite close the gap on
them.
"I told the players that to beat Arizona on its
home court, we had to play a near-perfect
game. We played a pretty good game, but not
good enough to win."
Like Saturday's 10-point loss to Oregon
State, the Cardinal got behind early last night
and never really recovered. Arizona, which had
won its previous three games by an average of
20 points while shooting 66 percent, picked up
where it left off last week.
The Wildcats hit 10 of their first 14 shots (71
percent) en route to a 21-10 lead midway
through the half. Davis called a timeout to
regroup his players and quiet the screaming
crowd of 10,305, but the Cardinal never got
closer than seven points in the first half and
trailed 35-28 at intermission.
Arizona did most of its first-half damage
shooting over the Cardinal's packed 1-2-2 zone

defense. In fact, all but three of the Wildcats' 17
first-half baskets were from the 15- to 20-foot
range.
In the second half, the Wildcats cooled off
from the outside and the Cardinal slowly crept
back in it. With Arizona ahead 50-41, freshman
Greg Butler hit an 18-footer from the right side,
and then a few minutes — and turnovers —
later, Novian Whitsitt rebounded his own
missed shot and put it in to make it 50-45.
After Morgan Taylor countered with a
tomahawk slam dunk at the other end, Stanford
blew two chances to narrow it to five again.
Wildcat guard Brock Brunkhorst scored on a
fast break with 6:39 remaining to put Arizona
back in front by nine, 54-45, and quell Stan
ford's last serious rally.
"We were well aware of [Arizona's outside
shooting ability]," Davis said of the Wildcats,
who entered the game 12th in the nation in
team field-goal percentage. "But the problem is
they've got a good inside game, too. 1 think
that's why they're a good ballclub and contend
ing for the league title."
The biggest problem for Stanford, however,
came from the outside — in particular from
guard Steve Kerr, the lone sophomore in a
senior-dominated starting lineup. Kerr hit nine
of 14 shots — all from long range — and five of
six free throws for a career-high 23 points.
Making his performance extra sweet was the
presence of his mother, who works in Cairo,
Egypt. Kerr's father, Malcolm, was the presi
dent of American University in Beirut when he
was assassinated 13 months ago.
"I was glad to play better," Kerr said. "My
mother came last year to the Stanford game and
that was one of my worst games of the season.
"I love playing against them because that
zone opens up a lot for me outside," continued
Kerr, who at one point hit six straight shots.
"And if I can get into my rhythm, I can score a
lot. When I'm in my rhythm, I can shoot from
just about anywhere."
Kerr's performance overshadowed fine
games by two of Stanford's younger players —
Whitsitt and Butler. Whitsitt, who emerged
from a shooting slump last week, was com
pletely back on track last night, making 6-of-10
