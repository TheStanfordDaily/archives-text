# Committee to scrutinize Ward recommendations
## 
### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
The Faculty Senate voted yester
day to create a senate committee to
assess how the Ward Committee's
recommendations, if implemented,
would affect academic programs and
the reputation of the University.
Members of the senate raised con
cern about the Ward report, which
calls for more joint appointments be
tween Stanford and the Hoover Insti
tution, during the 75-minute discus
sion. One of the main problems, ac
cording to Political Science Prof.
David Abernethy and many others
who echoed his initial statement, is
that the report only considers the
benefits — and not the costs — of
strengthening relations between the
two parties.
"The report simply did not discuss
the possible costs to individual de
partments or to the University of a
closer link with the Hoover," Aber
nethy in a prepared statement to
the senate.
"We have here, I would submit, an
example of poor policy analysis,
based on a 'benefit-bene fit' approach
whose refusal even to consider costs
calls the recommendations based on
this faulty methodology into ques
tion," he said.
As for benefits, the Ward report
naya more joint appointments would
create a prestigious social science
program here that would rival Har

vard's John F. Kennedy School of
Government. Many political science
professors have disputed this claim.
The committee will "examine the
effects the (Ward Committee's)
recommendations are likely to have
on the academic programs, the de-

partment structure, the faculty
recruitment policies and the quality
and reputation of the relevant aca
demic departments of the Univer
sity," according to the resolution, in
troduced by Biology Prof. Craig Hel
ler, a former senate chair.
Saying that the Stanford-Hoover
question has "finally fallen squarely
in our laps," Heller told fellow
senators, "There are very serious is
sues that need to be considered
before we move ahead."
But University President Donald

Kennedy, who in November praised
the report and pledged to implement
its recommendations, said he plans to
move ahead on selected recommen
dations pending the senate commit
tee's findings.
"I feel responsible to the Board (of
Trustees) to move forward on consid
eration of implementation," Kennedy
said. "We would want to get the judg
ment of any group you choose to as
sign before we do anything far
reaching. But neither would I think it
reasonable to put the whole agenda
on the back burner. I don't want any
misunderstanding about that," he
said.
After the meeting, Kennedy said
simply, "We're not going to wait on
everything."
The already strained relations be
tween Hoover and the Department of
Political Science have been particu
larly tense since the release of the
Ward report in late November. Mem
bers of the department say the report,
which criticizes Political Science for
refusing to make joint or courtesy ap
pointments with Hoover, is "one
sided," "libelous" and "factually in
accurate."
Yesterday, Ward urged that Stan
ford and Hoover "stop snarling at
each other, and sit down calmly and
objectively to explore just what sorts
of cooperative efforts on what sorts of
