# No homecourt edge for ASU

TUCSON, Ariz. — Last season, the Arizona State ,
men's basketball team had problems winning on the road.'i
The Sun Devils finished 13-15 overall and 8-10 in the
Pacific 10 Conference, but were 3-8 away from home.
Coach Bob Weinhauer seems to have solved those,
troubles this year — Arizona State is 3-1 on the road in; l
Pac-10 play, including an 83-82 overtime victory over
Oregon State in Corvallis, Ore., two weeks ago. 1 .
Now the Sun Devils, 9-10 overall and 4-5 in the Pac-10,
can't win at home. m!
Even if Arizona State beats Stanford tomorrow at 2 -
p.m. PST in the 14,287-seat University Activity Center,
its Pac-10 home record will be under .500. In fact, before
the Sun Devils beat Washington State eight days ago at
the activity center, they were 0-3 at home in conference
play. A loss to Washington Saturday and a 61-60 victory
over California last night brought their Pac-10 home
record to 2-4.
If Stanford hopes to make Arizona State's already
frustrated fans even more so, it will have to stop guards
Steve Beck and Bobby Thompson, the Sun Devils' top
two scorers.
In ASU's 89-74 victory at Stanford last month, the
sharpshooting Beck and Thompson seemingly scored at
will over a sagging Cardinal zone defense, combining for
47 points while hitting 15 of 23 shots (65 percent,. As a
team, Arizona State shot 60 percent, including a 67 per
cent figure in the first half.
"I felt good out there," said Thompson after that game,
in which he scored a career high 27 points. "1 was per
fectly relaxed. You take what you can get from a zone
defense, and they were giving me the shot. My rhythm felt
good and the shots were falling in."
Arizona State, the only Pac-10 team Stanford beat
twice last year, has been playing what is probably its best
basketball of the season lately. Had it not been for a 17-
point first half against Washington last week, the Sun
Devils might very well have won their last three straight
and been just two games out of first place.
