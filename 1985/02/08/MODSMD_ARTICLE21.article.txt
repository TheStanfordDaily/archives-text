# Swim teams face top opponents this weekend
## Men host USC, UCLA in big Pac-10 meets 
### INGRID SEYER Staff sportswriter 
The two most important meets of
the season are nothing to take lightly,
and when the No. 1-ranked Stanford
men's swimming team faces USC
today and UCLA tomorrow, that is
the last thing it will be doing. Stan
ford will host USC today at 2 p.m.
and UCLA tomorrow at 1 p.m. at
DeGuerre Pool.
"The USC and UCLA meets are
absolutely the biggest and most im
portant dual meets of the entire
season," Coach Skip Kenney said. "If
the men swim well and if the team
receives the support of the school, we
can win both meets."
USC is currently ranked fourth in

the NCAA coaches poll and UCLA is
ranked fifth. But although the Card
inal may be leading the polls. Kenney
does not feel this will give Stanford an
advantage in any way.
"No matter what the rankings are,
these meets are going to be extremely
close," Kenney said.
Fourteen Olympians who
represented seven countries in Los
Angeles will be competing this
weekend. These Olympians ac
counted for nine medals, including
five golds. Stanford's four Olympians
— Jeff Kostoff, Pablo Morales, John
Moffet and Anthony Mosse — will all
be competing for the Cardinal.
UCLA boasts six Olympians and
USC fields four.

Kenney feels positive about the
Cardinal's chances for victory in
today's meet against USC, especially
if Stanford's diving squad comes
through as expected. Stanford is
heavily favored to defeat USC by a
score of 16-2 in the diving events,
since Thor Johnson and Tom Roth
enbucher are expected to take first
and second place in the one-meter
and three-meter competition.
Very few of the swimming events
can be as easily predicted, especially
with the possiblity of three key
match-ups featuring Olympic team
members.
