# Swim teams face top opponents this weekend
## Men host USC, UCLA in big Pac-10 meets 
### INGRID SEYER Staff sportswriter 
The two most important meets of
the season are nothing to take lightly,
and when the No. 1-ranked Stanford
men's swimming team faces USC
today and UCLA tomorrow, that is
the last thing it will be doing. Stan
ford will host USC today at 2 p.m.
and UCLA tomorrow at 1 p.m. at
DeGuerre Pool.
"The USC and UCLA meets are
absolutely the biggest and most im
portant dual meets of the entire
season," Coach Skip Kenney said. "If
the men swim well and if the team
receives the support of the school, we
can win both meets."
USC is currently ranked fourth in

the NCAA coaches poll and UCLA is
ranked fifth. But although the Card
inal may be leading the polls. Kenney
does not feel this will give Stanford an
advantage in any way.
"No matter what the rankings are,
these meets are going to be extremely
close," Kenney said.
Fourteen Olympians who
represented seven countries in Los
Angeles will be competing this
weekend. These Olympians ac
counted for nine medals, including
five golds. Stanford's four Olympians
— Jeff Kostoff, Pablo Morales, John
Moffet and Anthony Mosse — will all
be competing for the Cardinal.
UCLA boasts six Olympians and
USC fields four.

Kenney feels positive about the
Cardinal's chances for victory in
today's meet against USC, especially
if Stanford's diving squad comes
through as expected. Stanford is
heavily favored to defeat USC by a
score of 16-2 in the diving events,
since Thor Johnson and Tom Roth
enbucher are expected to take first
and second place in the one-meter
and three-meter competition.
Very few of the swimming events
can be as easily predicted, especially
with the possiblity of three key
match-ups featuring Olympic team
members.
In the 200-yard individual medley,
Stanford Olympian Pablo Morales is
expected to face former Olympic
teammate Chris Cavanaugh of USC.
Morales won one gold medal and two
silvers in L.A. and Cavanaugh won a
gold.
Two more Olympians will meet in
the 200-yard breaststroke when Stan
ford's John Moffet faces Canadian
Ken Fitzpatrick. In the 1,000-yard
freestyle. Cardinal Jeff Kostoff (sixth
in the Olympic 400-meter individual
medley) will go against USC fresh
man Mike O'Brien. O'Brien won a
gold medal for his performance in the
1,500-meter freestyle. According to
Kenney, Kostoffs American-record
time in this event could fall to the
winner of the race.
Enthusiasm for tomorrow's meet
against UCLA shouldn't be difficult
to create, as the Cardinal will be
seeking revenge for its loss to the
Bruins two weeks ago in the Dallas
Morning News Classic (277-268).
The Bruins boast an unblemished
dual-meet record (6-0), as does Stan
ford. The Cardinal has won 29
straight dual meets since losing to

UCLA during the 1981-82 season.
"UCLA has an outstanding team
this year, but our men are really
psyched for the meet," Kenney said.
•'After losing to the Bruins two weeks
ago, the guys have a lot more in
centive to win."
UCLA's squad includes Olympians
Gionvanni Minervini, Tom Jager,
Bruce Hayes and Ralf Diegel. Miner
vini should face Moffet in the
breaststroke events, Hayes could
meet Kostoff in the 500-yard
freestyle and Diegel may swim
against Morales in the 200-yard indi
vidual medley.
Jager, the nation's fastest collegiate
swimmer, leads the nation in the 50-
yard (19.85) and 100-yard (44.15)
freestyle events.
Kenney is especially worried about
the relay events in the UCLA meet.
"Both of UCLA's relay teams are
very good," Kenney said. "We will
have to have won the meet before the
400-yard freestyle relay if we want to
win. To do that we must be able to
race head-to-head in each and every
race."
In the diving competition, UCLA
will be led by one of the nation's top
divers, junior Doug Shaffer.
