# Women at defending champ Texas
## 
### INGRID SEYER Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford women's swimming team will face pos
sibly its toughest competition of the season this Saturday
as it travels to Austin to face defending NCAA champion
Texas.
Although Stanford is top-ranked in the NCAA Coaches
Poll, followed by Texas in second place, Swimming World
Magazine's rankings reverse the order of the two teams.
That's the way it should be, according to swimming coach
George Haines.
"If you compare the times of both teams, Texas obvi
ously looks better on paper," Haines said. "Overall,
Texas has much better times then we do and has qualified
more swimmers for the NCAA championships."
The Cardinal will enter the meet with an unblemished
4-0 record. The Longhorns 2-1 dual meet record is
marred only by an early-season upset at Southern Meth
odist.

Texas Swimming Coach Richard Quick is very confident i
about his team. "We are more sure we can win (this
year)," Quick said. "The team is convinced we are the J
better team." J
Traditionally, the Cardinal swimmers swim some of •
their fastest times against Texas and this weekend the •
team will be hoping to do just that.
"We haven't met the NCAA cutoff times in nearly as »
many events as we would like TrC so hopefully this!
weekend we will be able to qualify a lot more swimmers in 1
more events," Haines said. "We have reached the point in *
the season when our women should be swimming at their •
best."
Stanford has qualified five swimmers in 12 events, two»
of them relays, for the NCAAs. In comparison, Texas has!
qualified 15 swimmers in 34 events, four of them relays. J
In the diving competition, Stanford will be looking to*
win both the one- and three-meter competitions. Stanford.
has qualified five divers in seven events for the NCAAs.
