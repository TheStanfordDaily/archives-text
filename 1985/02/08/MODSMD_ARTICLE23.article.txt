## Card plays SCU in weekend set 
### TOM SENF Staff sportswriter 
After playing its last three games on the road, the
Stanford baseball team returns home today for a 2
p.m. contest against Santa Clara.
The two teams will play three games this
weekend at alternating sites. Tomorrow's game will
be held at Buck Shaw Stadium in Santa Clara, with
the series finale at Sunken Diamond on Sunday.
Stanford's scheduled starters for the weekend
are Kevin Kunkel, Rob Wassenaar and Jeff Bal
lard. They will likely be opposed by Broncos John
Savage, Sal Vaccaro and Dave Blakely.
Stanford, 3-1, is coming off a tight 6-4 win at
Hayward State on Tuesday. Rick Lundblade's two
run ninth inning homer was the deciding factor.
Lundblade has been the offensive standout for the

Cardinal early in the season. His three home runs,
seven RBIs and .824 slugging percentage are all
team highs.
Leftfielder Walt Harris leads the team in batting
with a .400 average. Overall, the Cardinal is hitting
only .244 and is hitting a dismal .105 with runners
in scoring position.
Santa Clara brings a disappointing 2-4 record
into this weekend's series. According to first-year
Coach John Oldham, the Broncos have been
plagued by poor pitching and inconsistent defense.
However, one thing remains constant at Santa
Clara — explosive offense. Last year, the Broncos
hit 62 home runs — 27 more than the Cardinal.
They also had a team batting average of .303.
Although their top two hitters of 1984 are gone,
the Broncos have last year's four leading long-ball

hitters returning. Catcher Mike McFarlane hit .332
last season and slugged 13 homers, earning the
respect of coaches from all over the West Coast —
including Stanford's Mark Marquess.
"Mike is certainly one of the outstanding
catchers around," Marquess said. "He is a danger
ous hitter with tremendous power."
This year, Santa Clara has shown that it will be as
potent offensively as ever. Centerfielder Dave
Bearden, a second-team Northern California
Baseball Association selection last year, was hitting
over .500 prior to Wednesday's game with
Sacramento State.
First baseman Kevin Dunton — son of Stanford
Asst. Coach Tom Dunton — beat Sacramento
State with a grand slam. McFarlane has already
homered twice
