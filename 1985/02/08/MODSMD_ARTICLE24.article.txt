### PETER CASTILLO Staff sportswriter 
This weekend, the Stanford wres
tling team will face its last major tests
before the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships as it meets Northern
Arizona and Arizona State at Biola
University in La Mirada today and
competes in the Biola Invitational to
morrow.
" A SI J is the toughest school on our

schedule," said Stanford Coach Chris
Horpel. "This will be a good test for
the team since ASU is ranked in the
top five nationally and we have been
competitive with all the teams in our
schedule, but ASU is heavily
favored.
"We lost a close one to Northern
Arizona last year, and I hope to
avenge that," he continued. "I expect

to win considering the progress we
have made, but 1 don't know a lot
about Northern Arizona."
The Biola Invitational will be a
good indicator of Stanford's tourna
ment ability because it features the best
schools in California — such as Cal
State-Bakersfield and Fresno State —
as well as Arizona State. The highest
placing ever for the Cardinal in the
tournament was sixth place and Hor

pel is hoping for a fourth-place finish
this year.
Arizona State and Stanford both
competed in the Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo Collegiate and the Caesar's
Palace -Invitational early in the
season. Today's rematch will give
some Cardinal wrestlers a chance to
see how far they have progressed
since November and December.
