# Shorthanded netters take on San Jose St.
## 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
Normally, the Stanford
women's tennis coach can just toss
the balls out onto the Varsity
Courts, sit back, relax and watch
his team beat just about any op
ponent 9-0. It will be a different
situation today, however â€” Coach
Frank Brennan admits he's
worried about the Cardinal s
match against San Jose State.
The Spartan squad is not the
problem for Brennan. San Jose
State has gone 2-2 in its dual
matches thus far, and it lost its lirst
Northern Pacific Conference
match to California on Tuesday,
9-0.
Stanford's top four players will
not compete today. No. 1 singles
player Linda Gates and No. 2
Leigh Anne Eldredge, who also
make up the No. 1 Cardinal
doubles team, are competing in
the Intercollegiate Tennis Coaches
Association National Indoor
Championship in Houston
through Sunday.
Patty Fendick, ranked No. 3 in
the ITCA preseason poll, finished
competition in a professional

tournament in Florida yesterday,
but will not be back in time to play
San Jose State.
Finally, freshman Anna Ivan,
who was scheduled to play in the
ITCA Individuals, will not play
due to illness.
Brennan is left with Stephanie
Savides, Kay Tittle, Alyce Werdel
and possibly Cari Hagey in the top
four singles matches.
"1 think we'll do fine if we can
play that lineup," Brennan said.
Rochell Morrisson will play in
the No. 1 singles spot for San Jose
State. She is 5-2 in matches thus
far. Her doubles partner, and the
No. 2 singles player, is Shelley
Stockman. Stockman is currently
3-3 in her matches.
"We'll get most of the trouble
from San Jose State's top doubles
team. They (Rochell and Stock
man) lost in three sets to Gates
and Eldredge in an earlier ITCA
tournament," Brennan said.
San Jose State "will be primed
for an upset. We're skin and bones
at this point. If anybody gets hurts
or ill we'll be in real trouble. ... It
would be embarrassing to lose."
