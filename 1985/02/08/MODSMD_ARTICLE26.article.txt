## Cardinal ends swing at UCLA, Long Beach 
### ROB GRAHAM Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford men's volleyball team, 2-1 in
California Intercollegiate Volleyball Associa
tion play and 10-2 overall, concludes a four
game swing through Southern California
tonight and tommorrow as it takes on league
rivals UCLA and Long Beach State.
The Cardinal, ranked sixth in the latest na
tional poll, is 1-1 on the current road trip. Stan
ford lost to USC in three sets Monday and
edged San Diego State in a five-set marathon on
Wednesday. It does not get any easier for the
Cardinal.
Tonight's contest with UCLA in Pauley
Pavillion promises to test Stanford's mettle. By
Co-Coach Don Shaw's own admission, his
squad has yet to prove it can play in front of
hostile crowds. "We have to learn to go on the
road and play," Shaw said after Stanford was
trounced by USC.
Pauley Pavilion is not the place to learn that
lesson. Since 1970, the four-time national
champs have compiled a 147-10 record on their
home court. The Bruins, the nation's No. 2
team, boast a 17-2 overall mark this year. They
are 2-0 in the CIV A, having downed both Cal
State-Northridge and Long Beach in three sets.
Long Beach enters weekend play in the

CIV A cellar with an 0-3 record. The 49ers have
lost to USC, UC-Santa Barbara and UCLA,
each match going three sets. In spite of this,
Long Beach is ranked eighth nationally and
could give the Cardinal trouble.
History is against Stanford in both matches.
The Cardinal lost all four league games with
UCLA and Long Beach last year. Moreover,
Stanford failed to take a single set against either
team, losing 3-0 each time.
Shaw is hoping his team can relax and play
within itself. "I don't think we played really
well," said Shaw after Wednesday's victory over
SDSU. "I think it was a case of us being incon
sistent. We were so anxious that it got in the
way of our execution. We can't play like this
and expect to do well."
It's a safe bet that the Cardinal will have to be
on top of its game tonight in Los Angeles if it
hopes to win. But if it can pull off an upset over
the Bruins, Stanford will be in a dominant posi
tion in the CIVA.
With the hardest part of its schedule behind
it, Stanford will return to the friendly confines
of Maples Pavilion for a lengthy home stand.
And with that advantage, the Cardinal could
turn the tables against its southern rivals and
show them just what it means to play before a
partisan crowd.
