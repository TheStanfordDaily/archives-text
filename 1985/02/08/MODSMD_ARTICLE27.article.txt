## Stanford hosts No. 16 SDSU 
### PABLO MORALES 
The San Diego State women's basketball team has experienced the
gamut of highs and lows this year in Western Collegiate Athletic Asso
ciation conference action. Tomorrow night at 7:30 p.m. in Maples
Pavilion, Stanford will try to catch the A/tecs on a low.
At times this season. San Diego State has played brilliantly, as in its
61-59 victory over two-time defending national champion USC. Other
times, however, it has looked considerably less than brilliant, as in
their recent 92-65 loss to Long Beach State.
One apparent reason for this inconsistency has to do with the status
of first-team Ail-American Tina Hutchinson, a 6-foot-2 forward
who averaged 29.9 points and 10 rebounds a game for the Aztecs as a
freshman last year. Because of a knee injury suffered last December,
her productivity has been cut down to 19 points and six rebounds an
outing while filling only spot roles off the bench for San Diego State.
But according to Stanford Head Coach Dotty McCrea, this does not by

any means make the A/tecs a weaker team.
"Our game plan won't change any." McCrea said. "They have a
very strong inside game even without Hutchinson. They're extremely
talented."
Leading San Diego State's inside attack will he sophomore center
Toni Wallace, who at 6-4 and more than 200 lbs. is a quite formidable
figure underneath the boards. Penny Toler, a 5-8 treshman guard,
has been the offensive catalyst for the Aztecs this year. Her 5.8 assists
and 1 1 points-per-game avcraue have been a much appreciated contri
bution, especially in light of injury to Hutchinson.
Success for the Cardinal depends on how well it can control the
boards. McCrea stresses fundamentals.
"We need to box out underneath the boards, especially on defense.
We just can't allow them any second shots."
Ranked 15th nationally, San Diego State is 15-6 overall, and 4-3 in
the conference.
