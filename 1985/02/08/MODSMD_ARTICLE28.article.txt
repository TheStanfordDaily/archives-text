## 
### CAROLYN TARKINGTON Staff sportswriter 
It will be an exciting evening for both
men's and women's gymnastics, beginning at
7:30 tonight in Maples Pavilion. The men
will be competing in a triangular meet
against California and UCLA, while the
women will compete in a dual meet against
Cal State-Northridge.
"This is probably one of the more exciting
home competitions we will have," Men's
Coach Sadeo Hamada said. "UCLA and

Berkeley will be bringing Olympic-caliber
gymnasts."
UCLA is currently ranked sixth nationally
and is the defending NCAA champion. Two
Bruin gymnasts are members of the United
States National Team, and UCLA gymnast
Tony Pineda was a member of the 19K4
Mexican Olympic team.
The Bears are currently ranked one posi
tion behind Stanford at No. 14, and also
have as a member of their team U.S. Na
tional Team member Jon Omori.

"I predict it is going to be a close competi
tion" Hamada said. "It will be our first meet
of the season where we are going out full
strength with a full lineup. This ought to be a
psychological boost for the team."
"We are hoping to break some school
records tonight," Women's Coach Homer
Sardina said. "The record team score is
18 1.9, and we could break that easily. It's all
a matter of hitting our routines."
Tomorrow evening the Cardinal women
will have a dual competition against Cal.
