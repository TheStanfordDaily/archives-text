# Senate gets library report
## 
### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Staff writer 
The Academic Council Committee on Libraries (C-
Lib) yesterday presented its 1983-84 report to the Faculty
Senate, addressing the continuing automation of the li
brary system and recommending a refurbishing of Meyer
Library.
C-Lib Chairman Peter Paret also suggested lengthening
library hours.
"The Committee was encouraged with the progress in
planning an automated circulation system for Green and
Meyer Libraries, which would be linked to Socrates,"
states the C-Lib's report.
Thirty Socrates terminals are already in use in 13 loca
tions with 25 lines ordered and 25 terminals about to be
ordered. The Committee hopes to expand usage to dorms
and offices.
Paret, a professor of history, said the conversion to an
electronic catalog would temporarily inconvenience
some users.
Although library users can currently refer to one source
— card catalogs — to locate all library holdings, "Within
the next eight to 14 months, bibliographic records for new
works will no longer be added to the card catalogue," the
report states. Rather, the records will be entered only in
Socrates.

The move is expected to save $100,000 per year.
History Prof. Carl Degler Requested more terminals
during the transition period. At the moment it is
impossible to get access "without waiting on line," Degler said.
Degler also requested more terminals in the library it
self, because most patrons work "right there."
In addition, because the current rate of conversion —
70,000 volumes annually — would require 20 years to
complete the transition, the committee unanimously rec
ommended additional funds to speed the process, Paret
said.
C-Lib also explored how to use space better at Meyer
Library, which currently uses only half of its space.
The space "encourages socializing rather than studying,
and in the evenings tends to be noisy," the report states.
Possible changes, such as installing semi-partitioned
desks similar to those at Green, might encourage a more
studious atmosphere.
English Prof. John Bender said an extension of library
hours during inter-sessions for research is needed. A few
people writing a few important books in Green are suffici
ent to "justify at least a skeleton staff ... accessible only
to faculty" or other carefully defined groups.
Paret said C-L.ib "is pushing to extend hours."
