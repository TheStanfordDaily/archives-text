The weather could not be better for
a picnic, even if it is winter quarter.
And if the clouds gather and cover
the sun, your picnic plans need not be
scrapped. Picnics are pleasurable not
only when eaten outdoors; they are
great anytime, anywhere. This some
what unconventional concept regard
ing the how-to's and where's of
picnicking is rapidly becoming
popular thanks to entrepreneur Step
hanie Gaddis.
Owner of the Palo Alto Picnic Co.,
Gaddis prepares picnics for two to
200, saving you the hassle of shop
ping and the mess of cleaning up. The
only thing left for you to do is unpack
your basket of goodies and proceed
to gobble everything up.
The success of the Picnic Co. is
proof that a picnic is appropriate for
many occasions. A tailgater, brown
bag lunch, dorm study break or
breakfast, lunch or dinner with
friends are all perfect opportunities
for calling The Picnic Co. and re
questing a made-to-satisfy picnic ex
travaganza. Or, if you are in need of a
gift for someone and want to share
the riches, give a gift certificate and
then invite yourself.
Some ideal locations for a picnic in
clude the Dish, which is only a short
walk away, or a sunrise breakfast or
sunset dinner at Half Moon Bay. As
the sun sets and the breeze picks up,
unfold the blanket included with the
picnic basket and wrap yourself up.
Or, if you want to surprise your friend
with a special Valentine's treat, order
a picnic complete with chocolates,
candles and other special touches.
What is so nice about the Picnic Co. is
that each picnic basket is different.

depending on the customer's destina
tion and the occasion. If you go to a
baseball game, you'll find
jawbreakers and baseball cards; if the
occasion is a prom or birthday party,
the basket will include champagne or
Martinelli's cider, truffles and torte.
"The Picnic," as described in the
brochure, includes rich, flaky crois
sants filled with turkey, roast beef or
just about anything else. Salads,

cheese and fruit, dessert and
beverages are also included. The
choice of salads is as large as the vari
ety of ingredients that can go in the
croissants. Fruit varies, depending
upon what is in season. Included in
the large bowl with slice* of fruit will
be a generous portion of brie or Cut
ter cheddar cheese.
The croissant sandwiches are ex
ceptional. The meat or cheeses
combined with all the trimmings are
scrumptuous. However, the crois
sants themselves are so deliciously

fresh and light that you could just as
easily eat one plain.
Once you've finished your crois
sant, salad, cheese and fruit, you'll
most definitely be stuffed. If you
aren't, then you have either been on a
starvation diet or are a glutton! Being
full poses a problem because staring
you in the face is a piece of chocolate
and-amaretto torte with fresh al
monds. The torte is 10 layers tall and
worth every calorie. Most people
comment that there is just too much
food to eat in one sitting. This neces
sitates only a small amount of
creativity. Either order for two and
then eat the picnic with four — there
would still be a generous amount of
food for everyone — or eat half of
everything and save the rest for later.
Prices start at $14.95 for a Petite
Picnic, which includes two plain crois
sants, two salads and two beverages.
For an additional $10, a Basket for
Two includes two croissant sand
wiches, one salad, fruit and cheese,
two desserts and two beverages. As
you add people, the price increases; a
special of $9.50 per person is given to
groups of 12 or more. If this price
seems slightly expensive, remember
that you are really getting two meals
in one, and consequently need to
divide the price in half to fully appre
ciate the value of this unique dining
experience.
The picnics are all attractively
packaged in wicker baskets, along
with utensils, napkins and a
tablecloth to sit on. You'll have a
complete meal, neatly packaged so
that it is easily portable. Whether
you're planning to go to the Dish,
Napa Valley or Go'den Gate Park, or
stay in the comfort of your room, a
picnic from the Picnic Co. can make
any day more special.

On a clear day the Dish is an ideal location for a picnic. You won't have to climb for long before the whole
Bay Area lies before you.
