## Mexican food in an authentic setting

Usually the mention of u Mexican
restaurant conjures up images of
inargaritas, framed pictures of hull
fighters and other conveniently com
mercialized American influences.
Such is not the case at La Estrellita,
where the word "authentic" still
stands for something.
La Estrellita takes a different ap
proach By using five-year-old menus
to set the tradition and travel posters

of Ma/atlan and Mexico City to rep
resent the rest of the necessary atmo
sphere, I.a Estrellita is free to con
centrate on its outstanding
homemade Mexican food.
"Homemade" and "outstanding"
are definitely the two key words to
remember about the food. Every
thing from the hot sauce to the flour
tortillas is homemade, which gives all
the food an added flavor that tends to
get lost in most restaurants.
Service is prompt and courteous.
Our waitress suggested we begin our
evening meal with one of the several

appetizers on the menu. Although
nachos are free to groups of four or
more Stanford students with IDs. we
chose the quesadilla special. This
consisted ot melted cheese with
chorizo, a spicy Mexican sausage,
wrapped in a tortilla. Great-tasting
and large enough to make a meal it
self, it cost only $3.
Two items stand out as unique. The
first is the Mole (pork with red
sauce), containing more than 25
items. The second is the house
specialty, "The Great Burrito"
($5.25). which lives up to its reputa
tion as one of the best burritos in the

Bay Area.
The entire meal cost only $14 for
two people, a bargain indeed for a
fine dining experience. It you're
looking for a Mexican restaurant with
an unpretentious atmosphere and
outstanding, inexpensive, authentic
Mexican food, then this is the place
for you.
La Estrellita is located one block
west of El Camino on San Antonio
Road. Lunch is also served and
takeout orders are available.
