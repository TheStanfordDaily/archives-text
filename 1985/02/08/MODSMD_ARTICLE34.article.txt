At 16, I had what is known by the
sympathetic as a "math panic." At
the time, I was an honors math stu
dent in my sophomore year of high
school. Though I don't remember ex
actly how or when it happened, I sud
denly found myself unable to do my
math homework. This paralysis per
sisted, despite tutoring, and I
dropped out of the program.^
Then things got strange. 1 lost all
but the most remedial math skills,
and the sinht of numbers and equa
tions made me fidgety. It took me al
most six months to recover from this,
and though I returned eventually to
the old class, my enthusiasm for math
was gone. As a consequence, it
became like a foriegn language. \
This scenario is incomprehensible _
to most mathematicians. As with\
' most phobias, math anxiety is all too
familiar to the phobic and confusing
and even silly tp those unaffected.
Few phobias attafck one's ability to
learn, but math phobia does. Students
. in the humanities and "hard" sciences _
alike have had problems similiar to
mine. Somewhere in & confusing
tangle of equations, their, grasp of
even the basic concept of mathmatics
has gotten lost.

Enter Michael Guillen with a solu
tion to the problem. "Bridges To In
finity," a collection of essays explain
ing math to the layman, gives the
phobic (or curious) a glimpse into the
world of mathematicians and math.
Guillen, a professor of math and
physics at Harvard, is experienced at
explaining science to the layman. He
has written hundered of science arti
cles for magazines as well as a monthly
column for Psychology Today. As a
writer, his prose is clear and accessi
ble, and he indexes and cross
references the text so completely that
confusion is practically impossible,
v. The 17 essays begin with a section,
"Fantasizing," which gives a histori
cal perspective on the current state of
"pure" mathematics. Guillen outlines

the discoveries of major mathe
meticians from the time of Aristotle
and Pythagoras to Imre Lakatos' ex
ploration of Godel's theorem. The
discussion is simple — perhaps too
simple, since about 2,500 years of
math are glibly condensed into about
50 pages. One realizes something has
been left out, but one doesn't know
what.
Calculus and algebra are disssected
down to their barest theoretical
bones, and concepts such as finite
sets, rational numbers, plane
geometry and antimatter are
coherently presented. Guillen
employs the useful if sometimes con
descending technique Carl Sagan has
used — he cites concrete metaphors
to ground abstract ideas. In an essay
explaining catastrophe theory, he
compares the graph of an irreversible
catastrophe to that of an expanding
balloon which pops, and that of a
reversible catastrophe to a toy "frog
clicker" that pops in and out of shape.
In a second, brief section titled
"Comprimising," more controversial
areas are explored. Guillen discusses
non-Euclidian geometries, or
_ "alternate universes," and the con
flict over Godel's theory of uncer
\

tainty. The two essays in the section
are interesting in themselves, but they
don't fit together as well as the first
section, and the result is slightly mud
dling.
The third section, "Optimizing ," is
the most troublesome. Guillen
chooses six areas of applied mathe
matics and tries to explain them
based on what we've already learned
in the first two sections. The choice of
six topics (probability and statistics,
two-person game theory, three
person game theory, topology,
catastrophe theory and com
binatorics) seems arbitrary to me.
One gets the feeling Guillen is saying,
"And here's what we all do with this
silly stuff." In the last chapter, when
Guillen is explaining how computers
figure out airline city-by-city vs. non
stop schedules, it gets to be some
thing of a letdown. After all this gran- -
diose and consciousness-expanding -
theory, Guillen almost apologetically
brings us back into reality. If any
thing, "Optimizing" gave me addi
tional reasons to avoid mathematics;
instead of dwelling on Nielsen ratings "
and traveling-salesman routes, Guil- -
len could have thought of more com- J
pelling examples for using all that
bloody theory.

Despite the anticlimax, I can say I
know a lot more about math now
then when I started reading "Bridges
To Infinity." And though there are
occasional moments when you feel
back in Romper Room, generally the
book is written, as Guillen says, "so
that Diderot could enjoy it." If one
Diderot (philosopher and math clod
par excellence) becomes enlightened
by this book, it's worthwhile, because
greater communication between
math, the non-mathematical sciences
and the humanites can only improve
the quality of all. If you become en
lightened by the book, and find that
the knowledge of math theory makies
you interested in doing a few math
problems, then it's doubly
worthwhile.
