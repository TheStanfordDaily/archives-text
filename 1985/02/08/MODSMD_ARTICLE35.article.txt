"The Secret Teachings of Jesus:
Four Gnostic Gospels"
Translated by Marvin Meyer
Random House, 129 pp., $15.95
In 1945 two peasants literally un
buried a cache of scrolls in the Egyp
tian town of Nag Hammadi, scrolls
which gave the world its first look at
the sacred scriptures of a group of
early Christians — the Gnostics, who
had been condemned and thrown out
of the church. Until then, all that was
known of this heretical sect was writ
ten by bishops in the church or
thodoxy who viciously attacked it. In
"The Gnostic Gospels," which won
the 1979 National Book Critics Circle
Award, Elaine Fagels explained how
these mystical texts questioned the
very idea of a hierarchical Christian
church. The Gnostic tradition offered
its followers a direct communion with
Jesus Christ, and it had neither a
place nor a need for any mediating
Pope or clergy,
With Marvin Meyer's "The Secret
Teachings," the general reader will
have easy access to four key contro
versial Gnostic texts: The Secret
Books of James and John, The
Gospel of Thomas and The Book of
Thomas. A lot in these scriptures
closely resembles passages in the

canonical New Testament — on the
other hand, much seems to belong to
early Jewish Mystic traditions, and, as
some scholars have suggested, Orien
tal philosophies such as Buddhism.
Meyer's translation is admirably
lucid, spirited and colloquial, seeking
to remove as far as possible what Bible
scholars have termed "gender bias."
This "inclusiveness" corrects many
faults that have been perpetrated by

'Not to listen to the cries of the poor,
it will kill us.'

more traditional translations. It also
makes for some needlessly abstract
sounding idioms. For example, "One
who knows himself' becomes, quite
clunkily, "One who knows self." And
worse: The "Son of Man" becomes a
much too bland "Child of
Humanity."
"Choices"

A few weeks ago, Liv Ullmann
went on one of those 4 a.m. talk

shows to promote her book,
"Choices," and UNICEF. The forum
was perfect for her. Except for her
gracefully pale, pain-ridden face and
her Norwegian-accented voice, there
seemed to be neither light nor noise
in all of Palo Alto. "We must not for
get that all humans belong to one
family," she was saying. "Not to lis
ten to the cries of the poor, it will kill
us."

Somehow, the strident obviousness
of what she was saying was allayed by
her moving presence on television.
Pieties that would wilt in most
mouths — and do melt, and regularly
— were projected in a stunning,
oracular way.
Ullmann's first book, "Changing,"
told the story of her middle-class
upbringing and of her famous col
laboration with film director Ingmar
Bergman, with whom she made such
landmark films as "Persona" and
"Cries and Whispers." In this new
book, Ullniann continues the story.

focusing on her relationship with her
daughter, her musical debut on
Broadway (in "I Remember
Mama") and on her visits to Africa.
Ullman is often able to transfer her
dazzling physical immediacy into a
prose that is at once elliptical and
detailed: "We pass a very old lady
holding a small heap of dried nuts in
her lap. I sit down next to her and
watch her give from her ration to a
little baby boy. She looks up at me,
and without a word she peels a nut
and puts it in my mouth." Toward the
end of the book, she makes explicit
her moral conclusion: "If help arrives
only after all the people are gone,
when the sands have erased the little
traces that people once lived here, it
is my duty to say: Man was here. And
now he is gone because 1 failed him."
You are probably guessing that this
kind of stuff, if not interrupted by
some "levity," would make you ache
after awhile. It will make you ache,
sometimes. But Ullman, especially in
her descriptions of New York
Theater, is able to write in a lighter,
more deadpan style. Still, the prevail
ing mood is, needless to say, sadness.
"Our loudest cries are soundless and
stay with us as our own secret."

"The Gnostic Gospels," which won
the 1979 National Book Critics Circle
Award, Elaine Fagels explained how
these mystical texts questioned the
very idea of a hierarchical Christian
church. The Gnostic tradition offered
its followers a direct communion with
Jesus Christ, and it had neither a
place nor a need for any mediating
Pope or clergy,
With Marvin Meyer's "The Secret
Teachings," the general reader will
have easy access to four key contro
versial Gnostic texts: The Secret
Books of James and John, The
Gospel of Thomas and The Book of
Thomas. A lot in these scriptures
closely resembles passages in the

canonical New Testament — on the
other hand, much seems to belong to
early Jewish Mystic traditions, and, as
some scholars have suggested, Orien
tal philosophies such as Buddhism.
Meyer's translation is admirably
lucid, spirited and colloquial, seeking
to remove as far as possible what Bible
scholars have termed "gender bias."
This "inclusiveness" corrects many
faults that have been perpetrated by

more traditional translations. It also
makes for some needlessly abstract
sounding idioms. For example, "One
who knows himself' becomes, quite
clunkily, "One who knows self." And
worse: The "Son of Man" becomes a
much too bland "Child of
Humanity."
"Choices"
By Liv Ullman
Knopf, 193 pp., $14.95
A few weeks ago, Liv Ullmann
went on one of those 4 a.m. talk

shows to promote her book,
"Choices," and UNICEF. The forum
was perfect for her. Except for her
gracefully pale, pain-ridden face and
her Norwegian-accented voice, there
seemed to be neither light nor noise
in all of Palo Alto. "We must not for
get that all humans belong to one
family," she was saying. "Not to lis
ten to the cries of the poor, it will kill
us."

Somehow, the strident obviousness
of what she was saying was allayed by
her moving presence on television.
Pieties that would wilt in most
mouths — and do melt, and regularly
— were projected in a stunning,
oracular way.
Ullmann's first book, "Changing,"
told the story of her middle-class
upbringing and of her famous col
laboration with film director Ingmar
Bergman, with whom she made such
landmark films as "Persona" and
"Cries and Whispers." In this new
book, Ullniann continues the story.

focusing on her relationship with her
daughter, her musical debut on
Broadway (in "I Remember
Mama") and on her visits to Africa.
Ullman is often able to transfer her
dazzling physical immediacy into a
prose that is at once elliptical and
detailed: "We pass a very old lady
holding a small heap of dried nuts in
her lap. I sit down next to her and
watch her give from her ration to a
little baby boy. She looks up at me,
and without a word she peels a nut
and puts it in my mouth." Toward the
end of the book, she makes explicit
her moral conclusion: "If help arrives
only after all the people are gone,
when the sands have erased the little
traces that people once lived here, it
is my duty to say: Man was here. And
now he is gone because 1 failed him."
You are probably guessing that this
kind of stuff, if not interrupted by
some "levity," would make you ache
after awhile. It will make you ache,
sometimes. But Ullman, especially in
her descriptions of New York
Theater, is able to write in a lighter,
more deadpan style. Still, the prevail
ing mood is, needless to say, sadness.
"Our loudest cries are soundless and
stay with us as our own secret."
