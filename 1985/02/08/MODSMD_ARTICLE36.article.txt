To Have and Have Not (1944)
Kresge Auditorium .
Warner Brothers bought the title of an
Ernest Hemingway novella, but the
crackling Jules Furthman-William
Faulkner script has virtually nothing to
do with the book. In this first of four
movies Humphrey Bogart and Lauren
Bacall made together, she teaches him
how to whistle and seems far too sexy to
turn into the dried-up, strident trouper
she would become after his death. They
play together marvelously in this im
mensely enjoyable romantic adventure
melodrama, superbly crafted by Howard
Hawks and co-starring Walter Brennan,
Hoagy Carmichael, Sheldon Leonard,
Dolores Moran, Dan Seymour and even
Marcel Dalio (of Renoir's "Grand Illu
sion" and " Rules of the Game"),
Plays tonight at 9.

Bachelor Party (1984)
Memorial Auditorium
The premise of this comedy — a young
woman's concern that her fiance may
cheat on her at his bachelor party —
seems somehow anachronistic, but at
least it gives the star, Tom Hanks, an op
portunity to reveal his sweet, affec
tionate side at odd moments. The rest of
the time he runs the risk of appearing to
be a poor man's Bill Murray. The film,
which was written by Neil Israel and Pat
Proft and directed by Israel, isn't worth
seeing for Hanks alone, however, and
there's no other conceivable reason for
sitting through it. The junior high school
level of the humor so drains you that you
can't call up enough energy to get offen
ded at any of it. (If you did, you'd prob
ably walk out very early in the picture.)
The supporting cast includes Tawny
Kitaen, William Tepper and (in an em
barrassing performance) George Griz
zard.
Plays Sunday evening at 7 & 9:30.
A Clockwork Orange (1971)
Faculty Lounge (Building 300)
Anthony Burgess' novel was a satire
on the polarized state he felt western so
ciety was approaching: Young Alex is a
despicable thug who is "rehabilitated"
by behavioral psychologists, i.e., reduced
to a benign blur. The nasty joke, of
course, is that the two alternatives — so
cial and anti-social conduct — are
equally repugnant. But in Stanley
Kubrick's film version, Alex is made so
sympathetic — and all of society's repre
sentatives are such megalomaniacal
halfwits — that we are manipulated into
cheering for his highly objectionable acts
of rebellion. Shrewdly, Kubrick has cast
vivacious, winning Malcolm McDowell
— a performer whom no one could
dislike — in the role of Alex. This is a
morally questionable film, directed in
such an impersonal manner that even the
violence doesn't affect us; it seems to
transpire in a vacuum.

Manhattan (1979)
Kresge Auditorium
In a Chaplinesque display of ego.
Woody Allen makes the schlemiel hero
he's made us identify as himself pitifully
tormented: He is trying so hard to be
true to himself and fair to his lovers, but
they keep victimizing him. This charac
ter, Isaac Davis, is involved with three
women. His wife Jill (Meryl Streep)
throws him over for another woman.

writes a book exposing the dark un
derside of their marriage and retains cus
tody of their little boy, who is glimpsed
in montages with Isaac that signal us that
he is the most loving of fathers. Mary
(Diane Keaton) returns to her old
boyfriend, Isaac's best friend, Yale
(Michael Murphy). Tracy (Mariel
Hmeingway) commits the unpardonable
crime of being too young — she is 17,
and in this movie's cockeyed terms, the
indiscretion is all on her side. Ironically,
the redeeming grace of this infuriating
movie is the performances of three
actresses cast in these roles. Gordon Wil
lis did the striking black and white pho
tography; the music is by George
Gershwin.
Plays Saturday at 7 & 9.
Missing (1982)
Geology Corner, Room 320
It takes place in Chile during the coup
in 1973 that overthrew Allende's Marx
ist government and established a mili
tary junta, but it seems to be set in hell.
Costa-Gavras, the director, gives a stun
ning demonstration of what it is like to
be in a country in a state of siege, and in
some scenes he shows a feeling for visual
poetry that indicates Bertolucci's influ
ence. The screenplay (by Costa-Gavras
and Donald Stewart, out of Thomas
Hauser's book) tells the true story of the
search for an American, Charlie Hor
man, arrested in Chile in the first days of
the take-over. But there's a second plot,
too — the politicization of Horman's
conservative father (Jack Lemmon), who
comes to Chile to help his daughter-in
law (Sissy Spacek, giving her best perfor
mance in years) to find Charlie — and it
nearly wrecks the movie. The problem is
not just Lemmon's awful acting, but also
the fact that Horman's development has
been cut out of the cloth of 1960s
generation-gap cliches.
Plays Friday and Saturday at 7:30 &

The Adventures of Robin Hood
(1938)
Festival, Palo Alto
The best way to describe the experi
ence of seeing this movie, one of the
early Technicolor adventures, is to say
that it is to swashbucklers what "The
Wizard of Oz" is to musicals. Seton I.
Miller and Norman Reilly Raine, who
wrote the script, must have been grin
ning for weeks, and the pleasure that the
spirited cast takes in performing it is
highly infectious. Errol Flynn had his

ideal role in Robin Hood; Olivia De
Havilland, as Maid Marian, is as beauti
ful as a fairy tale princess; Alan Hale
plays Little John, Eugene Pallette is
Friar Tuck, Basil Rathbone is the vil
lainous Sir Guy of Gisborne, Melville
Cooper is the Sheriff of Nottingham,
Claude Rains is evil Prince John. Lan
Hunter is King Richard, Una O'Connor
and Herbert Mundin are Bess and Much
the Miller. William Keighley initiated
the film, but it was completed by Michael
Curtiz. There are many unforgettable se
quences, but perhaps the best is the en
trance of Robin in the midst of Prince
John's feast with a stag on his shoulder.
Plays through Wednesday with "The
Adventures of Don Juan."
Boudu Saved from Drowning (1932)
U.C. Theater, Berkeley
The bookstore owner Lestingois
(Charles Granval) saves a tramp (Michel
Simon) from drowning and takes him
into his home. But Boudu, who speaks
with a permanent drunken slur, executes
backward somersaults on the table or
hangs from the arches to demonstrate his
high spirits, sleeps on the floor with his
feet up against the wall, and finally
enrages his host by spitting on his first
editions. ("I can only shun the man who
spat on Honore de Balzac," Lestingois
tells him.) Jean Renoir's enchanting so
cial comedy, an imaginative variation on
the Frankenstein story, was adapted
from a play by Rene Fauchois and shot,
much of it on the banks of the Seine, by
Marcel Lucien — taking French movies
outdoors, en plein air, after years of
studio confinement, so that it has the
liberated feeling of the early Impres
sionist paintings. Michel Simon gives one
of the most magnificent comic perfor
mances ever put on film, and the sup
porting cast is first-rate, too — especially
Marcelle Hainia as Mme. Lestingois,
whom Boudu seduces, reducing her to a
giggling schoolgirl.
Plays Thursday with "La Bete
Humaine."
La Bete Humaine (1938)
U.C. Theater, Berkeley
Jean Renoir softens the fatalism and
melodrama of Emile Zola's novel about
a train engineer with hereditary
(alcoholic) insanity. The film seems
somewhat patchwork while you're
watching, but you retain the images and
the performances of Jean Gabin as the
engineer, Lantier (this was his great per
iod — the period of "The Lower
Depths" and "Pepe Le Moko" and
"Grand Illusion"), and the dark minx
Simone Simon as Severine, the femme
fatale. Curt Courant photographed
(beautifully). With Fernand Leaoux,
Julien Carette and Renoir himself in a
lovely cameo as Cabuche, the poacher.
Plays Thursday with "Boudu Saved

Boudu Saved from Drowning (1932)
U.C. Theater, Berkeley
The bookstore owner Lestingois
(Charles Granval) saves a tramp (Michel
Simon) from drowning and takes him
into his home. But Boudu, who speaks
with a permanent drunken slur, executes
backward somersaults on the table or
hangs from the arches to demonstrate his
high spirits, sleeps on the floor with his
feet up against the wall, and finally
enrages his host by spitting on his first
editions. ("I can only shun the man who
spat on Honore de Balzac," Lestingois
tells him.) Jean Renoir's enchanting so
cial comedy, an imaginative variation on
the Frankenstein story, was adapted
from a play by Rene Fauchois and shot,
much of it on the banks of the Seine, by
Marcel Lucien — taking French movies
outdoors, en plein air, after years of
studio confinement, so that it has the
liberated feeling of the early Impres
sionist paintings. Michel Simon gives one
of the most magnificent comic perfor
mances ever put on film, and the sup
porting cast is first-rate, too — especially
Marcelle Hainia as Mme. Lestingois,
whom Boudu seduces, reducing her to a
giggling schoolgirl.
Plays Thursday with "La Bete
Humaine."
La Bete Humaine (1938)
U.C. Theater, Berkeley
Jean Renoir softens the fatalism and
melodrama of Emile Zola's novel about
a train engineer with hereditary
(alcoholic) insanity. The film seems
somewhat patchwork while you're
watching, but you retain the images and
the performances of Jean Gabin as the
engineer, Lantier (this was his great per
iod — the period of "The Lower
Depths" and "Pepe Le Moko" and
"Grand Illusion"), and the dark minx
Simone Simon as Severine, the femme
fatale. Curt Courant photographed
(beautifully). With Fernand Leaoux,
Julien Carette and Renoir himself in a
lovely cameo as Cabuche, the poacher.

To Have and Have Not (1944)
Kresge Auditorium .
Warner Brothers bought the title of an
Ernest Hemingway novella, but the
crackling Jules Furthman-William
Faulkner script has virtually nothing to
do with the book. In this first of four
movies Humphrey Bogart and Lauren
Bacall made together, she teaches him
how to whistle and seems far too sexy to
turn into the dried-up, strident trouper
she would become after his death. They
play together marvelously in this im
mensely enjoyable romantic adventure
melodrama, superbly crafted by Howard
Hawks and co-starring Walter Brennan,
Hoagy Carmichael, Sheldon Leonard,

Bachelor Party (1984)
Memorial Auditorium
The premise of this comedy — a young

seems somehow anachronistic, but at

the time he runs the risk of appearing to
be a poor man's Bill Murray. The film,
which was written by Neil Israel and Pat
Proft and directed by Israel, isn't worth
seeing for Hanks alone, however, and
there's no other conceivable reason for
sitting through it. The junior high school
level of the humor so drains you that you

Anthony Burgess' novel was a satire

Geology Corner, Room 320
It takes place in Chile during the coup
in 1973 that overthrew Allende's Marx
ist government and established a mili
tary junta, but it seems to be set in hell.
Costa-Gavras, the director, gives a stun
ning demonstration of what it is like to
be in a country in a state of siege, and in
some scenes he shows a feeling for visual
poetry that indicates Bertolucci's influ
ence. The screenplay (by Costa-Gavras
and Donald Stewart, out of Thomas
Hauser's book) tells the true story of the
search for an American, Charlie Hor
man, arrested in Chile in the first days of
the take-over. But there's a second plot,
too — the politicization of Horman's
conservative father (Jack Lemmon), who
comes to Chile to help his daughter-in
law (Sissy Spacek, giving her best perfor
mance in years) to find Charlie — and it
nearly wrecks the movie. The problem is
not just Lemmon's awful acting, but also
the fact that Horman's development has

he is the most loving of fathers. Mary
(Diane Keaton) returns to her old
boyfriend, Isaac's best friend, Yale
(Michael Murphy). Tracy (Mariel
Hmeingway) commits the unpardonable
crime of being too young — she is 17,
and in this movie's cockeyed terms, the
indiscretion is all on her side. Ironically,
the redeeming grace of this infuriating
movie is the performances of three
actresses cast in these roles. Gordon Wil
lis did the striking black and white pho
tography; the music is by George
Gershwin.
Plays Saturday at 7 & 9.
Missing (1982)
Geology Corner, Room 320
It takes place in Chile during the coup
in 1973 that overthrew Allende's Marx
ist government and established a mili
tary junta, but it seems to be set in hell.
Costa-Gavras, the director, gives a stun
ning demonstration of what it is like to
be in a country in a state of siege, and in
some scenes he shows a feeling for visual
poetry that indicates Bertolucci's influ
ence. The screenplay (by Costa-Gavras
and Donald Stewart, out of Thomas
Hauser's book) tells the true story of the
search for an American, Charlie Hor
man, arrested in Chile in the first days of
the take-over. But there's a second plot,
too — the politicization of Horman's
conservative father (Jack Lemmon), who
comes to Chile to help his daughter-in
law (Sissy Spacek, giving her best perfor
mance in years) to find Charlie — and it
nearly wrecks the movie. The problem is
not just Lemmon's awful acting, but also
the fact that Horman's development has
been cut out of the cloth of 1960s
generation-gap cliches.
Plays Friday and Saturday at 7:30 &
10.
The Adventures of Robin Hood
(1938)
Festival, Palo Alto
The best way to describe the experi
ence of seeing this movie, one of the
early Technicolor adventures, is to say
that it is to swashbucklers what "The
Wizard of Oz" is to musicals. Seton I.
Miller and Norman Reilly Raine, who
wrote the script, must have been grin
ning for weeks, and the pleasure that the
spirited cast takes in performing it is
highly infectious. Errol Flynn had his

ideal role in Robin Hood; Olivia De
Havilland, as Maid Marian, is as beauti
ful as a fairy tale princess; Alan Hale
plays Little John, Eugene Pallette is
Friar Tuck, Basil Rathbone is the vil
lainous Sir Guy of Gisborne, Melville
Cooper is the Sheriff of Nottingham,
Claude Rains is evil Prince John. Lan
Hunter is King Richard, Una O'Connor
and Herbert Mundin are Bess and Much
the Miller. William Keighley initiated
the film, but it was completed by Michael
Curtiz. There are many unforgettable se
quences, but perhaps the best is the en
trance of Robin in the midst of Prince
John's feast with a stag on his shoulder.
Plays through Wednesday with "The
Adventures of Don Juan."
Boudu Saved from Drowning (1932)
U.C. Theater, Berkeley
The bookstore owner Lestingois
(Charles Granval) saves a tramp (Michel
Simon) from drowning and takes him
into his home. But Boudu, who speaks
with a permanent drunken slur, executes
backward somersaults on the table or
hangs from the arches to demonstrate his
high spirits, sleeps on the floor with his
feet up against the wall, and finally
enrages his host by spitting on his first
editions. ("I can only shun the man who
spat on Honore de Balzac," Lestingois
tells him.) Jean Renoir's enchanting so
cial comedy, an imaginative variation on
the Frankenstein story, was adapted
from a play by Rene Fauchois and shot,
much of it on the banks of the Seine, by
Marcel Lucien — taking French movies
outdoors, en plein air, after years of
studio confinement, so that it has the
liberated feeling of the early Impres
sionist paintings. Michel Simon gives one
of the most magnificent comic perfor
mances ever put on film, and the sup
porting cast is first-rate, too — especially
Marcelle Hainia as Mme. Lestingois,
whom Boudu seduces, reducing her to a
giggling schoolgirl.
Plays Thursday with "La Bete
Humaine."
La Bete Humaine (1938)
U.C. Theater, Berkeley
Jean Renoir softens the fatalism and
melodrama of Emile Zola's novel about
a train engineer with hereditary
(alcoholic) insanity. The film seems
somewhat patchwork while you're
watching, but you retain the images and
the performances of Jean Gabin as the
engineer, Lantier (this was his great per
iod — the period of "The Lower
Depths" and "Pepe Le Moko" and
"Grand Illusion"), and the dark minx
Simone Simon as Severine, the femme
fatale. Curt Courant photographed
(beautifully). With Fernand Leaoux,
Julien Carette and Renoir himself in a
lovely cameo as Cabuche, the poacher.
Plays Thursday with "Boudu Saved
from Drowning."
