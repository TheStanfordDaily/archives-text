## Economist criticizes aid to 'non-poor' 
### GEORGE LeMAITRE 
A Reagan administration econo
mist last night defended the pro
posed increases in the defense
budget and recommended trimming
the $222 billion budget deficit by
cutting services to the "non-poor."
"We must cut government pro
grams that give benefits to the non
poor," said Herbert Stein, a mem
ber of President Reagan's Eco
nomic Policy Advisory Board. Pro
grams in this category of "non
poor" include incentives to farmers
and small businesses and a "long list
of programs which finance people
who are not poor," Stein said.
People are also receiving
"unearned" benefits from Social
Security, Stein said, calling the
practice unacceptable.
"An average married male who
retired in 1960 is receiving benefits
13 times larger than the amount he
gave (including interest)," Stein
said.
Stein also said only one-third of
the $200 billion paid out each year
in Social Security benefits goes to
people who would be poor without
the benefits.
In his speech. Stein examined the
sectors from which the money could
be taken: national defense, public
services (police and fire), consump
tion for the poor and subsidies for
the non-poor. He concluded that
the money must come from funding
for the non-poor.
Stein advised against cutting the
defense budget."It seems like
everyone except Reagan, (Secretary

of Defense) Caspar Weinberger and
me is in favor of cutting defense,"
he said.
"There's a great public miscon
ception over the size of the defense
budget," Stein said, citing a study
showing that 57 percent of the
American people think that defense
accounts for more than 20 percent
of the gross national product.
Currently, national defense is 6
percent of the GNP and the admin
istration has proposed to raise this
to 7.8 percent by 1990. However,
between 1952 and 1970 there were
only two years in which defense ac
counted for less than than 8 percent
of the GNP, according to Stein.
Stein said public services account
for 15 percent of the GNP and
"must be left alone." The costs of
public services has practically stood
still while the national per capita
income has risen substantially.
Cutting benfits to the poor is also
out of the question, Stein said.
"There is a general agreement that
we have a social obligation to assist
the very poor," he said.
Stein did, however, mention that
recent evidence shows that federal
assistance to the poor has not
helped to dispel poverty and could
instead be a cause of its persistence.
He said he didn't necessarily believe
this and that the results of the study
are "inconclusive."
The consequences of not reducing
the federal deficit are not known for
sure, Stein said. "For the past 20
years they (economists) have been
saying large deficits cause infla

tion," Stein said. "But you've seen
(under Reagan) the larger deficits
with a diminished inflation rate."
"The value of getting the deficit
down depends on the cost of doing
it. It is a question of priorities,"
Stein said.
However, Stein thinks that if the
deficit increases too much, "a possi
ble explosion process" could take
place and the government would be
forced to inflate its way — by drasti
cally enlarging the money supply —
out of the crisis.

Stein said that a constitutional
amendment for a balanced budget
would probably not work because
the congressional "evasion of this
would be outrageous."
In addition to serving in Reagan's
administration. Stein also chaired
the Council of Economic Policy Ad
visory Board under Presidents
Nixon and Ford.
The speech, held in Bishop
Auditorium, attracted close to 200
people.
