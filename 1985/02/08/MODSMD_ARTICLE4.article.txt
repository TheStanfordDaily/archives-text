# STANFORD STADIUM
## Stadium's the place Oval, diamond lose out as graduation sites 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Staff writer 
Following a recommendation by
the senior class presidents, Univer
sity President Donald Kennedy
yesterday chose Stanford Stadium
as the site for Commencement this
June.
The Oval and Sunken Diamond
were the other two sites considered.
The diamond was deemed unac
ceptable because of poor sight lines
and its small size. "The sight lines
are bad. [People] farther than 10
rows back felt uninvolved because
they couldn't see," Co-president
Kathy Ko said. "The diamond is
really too flat and too small, and it's
not very pretty when it's packed
with people."
"The Oval was not a choice,"
said Senior Class President Joyce
Weatherford, because "it's too flat
and there would be no crowd con
trol. They'd also have to close Palm
Drive and the surrounding streets
for three days."
The Oval is "really too small
when you consider the speaker
we're having," Ko added. "Last
year there were 25,000 people. We
expect 30,000 to 35,000 this year."
New York Gov. Mario Cuomo,
the keynote speaker at last sum
mer's Democratic National Con
vention, will be the commencement
speaker.
Both Ko and Weatherford called

the stadium "the best alternative"
of the the three.
"The biggest complaint is that it's
too big. but it's the only logical
choice," Ko said.
"We were left with no choice,
and we're doing the best we can,"
Weatherford said. "I have a little
bit of trepidation because there are
no perfect sites. The reactions of
parents and friends after last year's
graduation were so negative that
we felt the change was needed.
"Besides the sight lines being ob
viously better, the single most im
portant feature is the advantage of
unlimited tickets. Sixty percent of
those attending will be within
driving distance, and we don't want
people choosing [among] relatives
and friends for a limited number of
tickets.
"The biggest qualm people have
about the stadium is that it is im
personal," Weatherford said.
"That's its only fault, and that's not
really a fault because now you can
invite [whomever] you want."
Ko and Weatherford said there
will be a major effort to improve
the attractiveness of the stadium for
the event.
"The University will invest a lot
of time and money into making the
stadium beautiful," Ko said.
Asst. Art Profs. Wanda Corn and
Gregory Lynch and Planning
Director Phil Williams have

worked with Lois Wagner, director
of Events and Services, to design a
low, 20-by- 160-foot platform that
will face the press box side of Stan
ford Stadium.
Undergraduates will be seated in
a fan-shaped pattern in front of the
podium with graduate students oc
cupying a section in the stands.
Spectators will sit on the shady
side of the field, facing the podium.
Huge banners representing the
University, the University presi
dent, the Stanford Centennial and
Stanford's eight schools will cover
the empty seats behind the
graduates.
Ko and Weatherford expect
some criticism from seniors who
feel the stadium is not a good
choice.
"If it's not explained well, people
will get very upset," Ko said. "A lot
of people equate being small with
being personal. Frost Ampitheater
was beautiful, but now it's
impossible to have it anywhere
[that is] the size of Frost."
"From our point of view, the stu
dents are the ones graduation is
for," Weatherford said. "It's almost
like, 'Who cares about anything
else?' That's not really true because
parents and other guests are the
ones who really need to be consid
ered. Graduation will be for us
