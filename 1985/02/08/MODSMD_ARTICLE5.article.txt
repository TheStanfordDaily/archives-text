# Res Ed restructures Draw system
## 
### INDRA SEHDEV Staff writer 
The most important change in the Undergradu
ate Housing Draw this year will "strengthen the
guaranteed status" by allowing all students with
guaranteed housing to draw from a better pool of
numbers than their unguaranteed counterparts, ac
cording to Rodger Whitney, assistant dean of Resi
dential Education and director of the Housing Cen
ter.
"Unguaranteed students will draw from the
worst numbers, probably beginning at 3,000,"
Whitney said.
In previous years, unguaranteed as well as
guaranteed students have drawn from the same
pool of numbers — one to 5,000. "The only advan
tage of having guaranteed status, then, has been to
get . . . into the assignable group," Whitney said.
The size of the assignable group is determined by
the number of undergraduate spaces available. Stu
dents are put into the assignable group on the basis
of their guaranteed standing. First, guaranteed stu
dents are assigned before unguaranteed students.
Second, students are assigned on the basis of their
draw numbers, with low numbers better than high
numbers.
Whitney said that the recommendation for the
change in the Draw came to Res Ed from the Com
mittee on Services to Students-Residences (COSS-
R). a student advisory group.
The idea behind the change is "to strengthen the
guaranteed status. It will help people, in their
guaranteed year, to have a better shot at getting
into some of the more popular residences," Whit
ney said.
Only the students included in the assignable
group can be considered for assignment in the

second round of the Draw, in which students are
assigned to specific dorms.
Whitney explained that in past years, guaranteed
status hasn't helped students once they have gotten
to the second round. It has been possible for un
guaranteed students with lower draw numbers than
some of the guaranteed students to get assigned to
more popular dorms.
Student reaction to the changes is varied.
Junior Mark Epstein, currently a resident of
Roble Hall, said, "I think it's an improvement, but
it doesn't affect me because I'm ready to live off
campus next year."
Barbara Massengale, a sophomore living in Potter,
offered a contrasting view. "I don't think it's a
good idea. The Draw is hard enough as it is. Your
chances are already lower when you're un
guaranteed. I think everyone should be given the
same chance."
Whitney also discussed other aspects of the
Draw, stressing that "people still need priorities"
to get into the residences of their choice. "If you
get into the assignable pool, the computer looks at
your priorities and then at draw numbers to break
ties."
But there will be a slight change in the criteria
for receiving priorities this year, he said. This year
the highest priority for being assigned to all
residences will be the returning resident priority. In
the past the "SI" priority, the highest priority, has
not necessarily been the returning resident priority.
Some of the residences chose other SI priorities.
"Group priorities won't be valid after round two
for Manzanita. Mirrielces or the Suites. Friends
who want to live together will have to join the

waiting list together. However, the S2 (group
priority) will not help them."
Changes involving the waiting list have also been
made for this year's Draw. "Students on the
waiting list will no longer have to go to a date posi
tion," Whitney explained. "They will get a number
above 5,000 when they join the waiting list after
round two of the Draw.
"We will take numbers in order, and students
can sequence themselves better and see where they
are on the list."
Also, there will be "no gaps on the waiting list
order" if students are assigned .numbers, Whitney
said.
Res Ed is considering other changes in housing
for next year, according to Whitney. "We are still
looking at, and will decide in a few weeks, on a
noise policy and a no-smoking policy for
residences."
Whitney cited other important problems that the
Housing Center continues to work on. "We are
concerned about the need for more on-campus
housing, the high cost of off-campus housing and
fine tuning the Draw to make it fair and supportive
of Res Ed."
Drawbooks will be distributed in early April.
The Draw will be held from April 22 to April 26
this year.
COSS-R spokesman Tim Hesterberg explained
that the new system will "spread the supply of good
housing around and give preference to guaranteed
students. Guaranteed students have not done as
well as unguaranteed students in round two of the
Draw," he said. •

COSS-R spokesman Tim Hesterberg explained
that the new system will "spread the supply of good
housing around and give preference to guaranteed
students. Guaranteed students have not done as
well as unguaranteed students in round two of the
Draw," he said. •

Looking away to improve his luck, a Stanford student pulls his fate out
of the chest during a recent Draw.
The most important change in the Undergradu
ate Housing Draw this year will "strengthen the
guaranteed status" by allowing all students with
guaranteed housing to draw from a better pool of
numbers than their unguaranteed counterparts, ac
cording to Rodger Whitney, assistant dean of Resi
dential Education and director of the Housing Cen
ter.
"Unguaranteed students will draw from the
worst numbers, probably beginning at 3,000,"
Whitney said.
In previous years, unguaranteed as well as
guaranteed students have drawn from the same
pool of numbers — one to 5,000. "The only advan
tage of having guaranteed status, then, has been to
get . . . into the assignable group," Whitney said.
The size of the assignable group is determined by
the number of undergraduate spaces available. Stu
dents are put into the assignable group on the basis
of their guaranteed standing. First, guaranteed stu
dents are assigned before unguaranteed students.
Second, students are assigned on the basis of their
draw numbers, with low numbers better than high
numbers.
Whitney said that the recommendation for the
change in the Draw came to Res Ed from the Com
mittee on Services to Students-Residences (COSS-
R). a student advisory group.
The idea behind the change is "to strengthen the
guaranteed status. It will help people, in their
guaranteed year, to have a better shot at getting
into some of the more popular residences," Whit
ney said.
Only the students included in the assignable
group can be considered for assignment in the

second round of the Draw, in which students are
assigned to specific dorms.
Whitney explained that in past years, guaranteed
status hasn't helped students once they have gotten
to the second round. It has been possible for un
guaranteed students with lower draw numbers than
some of the guaranteed students to get assigned to
more popular dorms.
Student reaction to the changes is varied.
Junior Mark Epstein, currently a resident of
Roble Hall, said, "I think it's an improvement, but
it doesn't affect me because I'm ready to live off
campus next year."
Barbara Massengale, a sophomore living in Potter,
offered a contrasting view. "I don't think it's a
good idea. The Draw is hard enough as it is. Your
chances are already lower when you're un
guaranteed. I think everyone should be given the
same chance."
Whitney also discussed other aspects of the
Draw, stressing that "people still need priorities"
to get into the residences of their choice. "If you
get into the assignable pool, the computer looks at
your priorities and then at draw numbers to break
ties."
But there will be a slight change in the criteria
for receiving priorities this year, he said. This year
the highest priority for being assigned to all
residences will be the returning resident priority. In
the past the "SI" priority, the highest priority, has
not necessarily been the returning resident priority.
Some of the residences chose other SI priorities.
"Group priorities won't be valid after round two
for Manzanita. Mirrielces or the Suites. Friends
who want to live together will have to join the

waiting list together. However, the S2 (group
priority) will not help them."
Changes involving the waiting list have also been
made for this year's Draw. "Students on the
waiting list will no longer have to go to a date posi
tion," Whitney explained. "They will get a number
above 5,000 when they join the waiting list after
round two of the Draw.
"We will take numbers in order, and students
can sequence themselves better and see where they
are on the list."
Also, there will be "no gaps on the waiting list
order" if students are assigned .numbers, Whitney
said.
Res Ed is considering other changes in housing
for next year, according to Whitney. "We are still
looking at, and will decide in a few weeks, on a
noise policy and a no-smoking policy for
residences."
Whitney cited other important problems that the
Housing Center continues to work on. "We are
concerned about the need for more on-campus
housing, the high cost of off-campus housing and
fine tuning the Draw to make it fair and supportive
of Res Ed."
Drawbooks will be distributed in early April.
The Draw will be held from April 22 to April 26
this year.
