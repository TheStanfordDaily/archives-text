Hijacking in Lebanon fails
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Gunmen seized a Cyprus Airways jetliner and
held 12 hostages at Beirut airport yesterday, then surrendered the plane
and hostages six hours later. A mediator said the hijackers were told
their demand would be met.
The gunmen demanded that Greek Cypriot authorities free two
Lebanese Shiitc Moslems in prison on Cyprus for an earlier hijacking.
The Shiite attack squad at Beirut set a 12-hour deadline. They said that
one hour after it expired, they would start killing hostages.
But suddenly it was over. The plane's Swedish pilot, Sven Wisting,
said the gunmen escaped without a trace at the end of the hijack drama.
He said he did not realize the hijacking had ended until 10 minutes
later, when security officials informed him.
Wisting said five or six men took over his Boeing 707 aircraft and ap
parently had colleagues on the ground where he was ordered to taxi his
plane.
The Beirut assailants identified themselves as members of the Black
Brigade, which is bent on determining the fate of Imam Mousa Sadr,
spiritual head of Lebanon's Shiite sect, who disappeared during a visit to
Libya in 1978.
Their Black Brigade comrades jailed in Cyprus were sentenced to
seven-year terms in 1983 after they surrendered in Cyprus after their
21-hour hijacking of a Libyan-chartered Romanian jetliner bound from
Athens to Tripoli.
The Beirut hijackers demanded freedom for their "brothers . .. who
1 ,are detained because of an honorable cause, which is the Imam's
release."
Reagan affirms ANZUS alliance
WASHINGTON — President Reagan and Australian Prime Minister
Robert Hawke agreed yesterday that the Australia-New Zealand-
United States alliance (ANZUS) is in no danger of being scrapped
despite rebuffs dealt to U.S. military activities by each of its partners this
week.
''The ANZUS treaty remains," Hawke said as he left the White
House after a luncheon meeting with Reagan. "The relationship be
tween Australia and the United States under the ANZUS treaty, the
rights and obligations assumed by us under the treaty, are undiminished
by recent events."
, His remarks referred, in part, to the U.S. announcement Wednesday
that it will conduct its next test of the MX missile without Australian
help. The United States acted after Hawke unexpectedly told the admin
istration that pressure from antinuclear forces in his Labor Party would
force him to renege on plans to let U.S. test-monitoring planes use
Australian bases.
Reagan, who spoke in glowing terms of U.S.-Australian cooperation,
made no mention of Hawke's turnaround. But, talking briefly to
reporters at the outset of his meeting with Hawke, he criticized New-
Zealand's denial of port access to a U.S. warship because the United
States refused to say whether the ship carries nuclear arms.
A senior U.S. official, who briefed reporters later on condition that he
not be identified, stressed that the administration is much more con
cerned about the disagreement with New Zealand than with Hawke's ac
tions. The U.S. position is that it can find other ways to monitor the MX
test and that Australia continues to cooperate on many naval-defense
activities in the South Pacific. "The MX issue was blown enormously
out of proportion," the official said. "Not only has its importance been
exaggerated, but it is a very unique issue. It has a very generic difference
from the issue of ship visits which does apply worldwide."
The official said New Zealand's position means that the United States
cannot consider it a fully functioning member of the three-nation pact.
He said the ANZUS framework will be kept intact in hopes that New
Zealand will change its stance, but he also acknowledged that, for now,
U.S. participation in ANZUS effectively is limited to working with
Australia.
Korean leader returns from exile
NARITA, Japan — South Korean opposition leader Kim Dae Jung
took off yesterday on a flight to Seoul to end a two-year exile in the
United States and said he hoped to receive a welcome that "will show
how strongly I am supported" by the South Korean people.
Kim, 61, the opposition candidate in his country's last free and open
presidential election, has not spent a free moment on Korean soil since
the government of President Chun Doo Hwan jailed him in May 1980.
Kim declared before leaving for Seoul that "as long as I maintain my
loyalty to our people's aspirations for democracy, there is no way for our
people not to support me."
The government has said publicly that Kim would not be jailed again
when he returned, but there was widespread speculation that he may im
mediately be put under house arrest.
"1 strongly believe I am supported by our people," Kim said last night
at a news conference attended by 300 Japanese and foreign reporters at
a hotel near Narita Airport outside Tokyo. He added that the degree of
that support would be made clear when he arrived at Seoul's Kimpo Air
port.
Noting that he had been "separated from our people since May
1980," Kim saic! he hoped that the Chun government would allow him
to make "short remarks" upon his arrival.
He also said he was prepared to "be moderate" if Chun, a former gen
eral, acts "with prudence." He noted that he had proposed a four-person
"summit" among Chun, himself, and two other purged political leaders
of the 1961-1979 era of the assassinated President Park Chung Hee.
"If the government is willing to carry on a dialogue with North Korea,
why shouldn't it carry on a dialogue with South Koreans?" Kim asked.
Salvadoran peace talks stalled
MEXICO CITY — A Salvadoran rebel leader said yesterday that
peace-talks with the government of El Salvador are frozen indefinitely,
but he stopped short of saying the negotiations are dead.
Guillermo Ungo, president of the Revolutionary Democratic Front,
the political arm of the left-wing insurgents, also made public the con
tents of a letter to Salvadoran President Jose Napoleon Duarte, dated
Jan. 30, that rejected Duarte's demand that the rebels renounce violence
if they want the talks to proceed.
"A general state of war exists in El Salvador," the letter said in part,
"and there is no way anyone can seriously pretend to overcome this by
mere declarations."
Rebel leaders complained two weeks ago that Duarte's government
had refused to respond to a suggested offer of a time and place for a new
round of talks. Ungo's assessment that the talks are at a standstill un
derlines the difficulty of reaching any settlement soon.
"It is not probable we will hold another round of talks before the
municipal elections scheduled for the middle of March," Ungo told
reporters, but he refused to speculate on whether the government might
be willing to talk pfter the elections.
"We believe that President Duarte has little capacity to impose his will
to have a dialogue with us — if, in fact, that is his will — because the real
power is held by the military and by the Reagan administration," Ungo
said.
Eventually, he said, the peace talks will be renewed because they pro
vide the only forum for negotiating an end to the civil war, which has
claimed 50,000 lives.
