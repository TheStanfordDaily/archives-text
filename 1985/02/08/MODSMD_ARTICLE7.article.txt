# Weinberger urges 'no freeze'
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Secretary of Defense
Caspar Weinberger told the Senate Budget Com
mittee yesterday that a defense spending freeze
would decimate the Pentagon's programs, delaying
work on the B-l and "Stealth" bombers, reducing
the fleet of tactical aircraft, halting development of
a new transport airplane and blocking the purchase
of two submarines.
But Weinberger, trying to fend off cuts in the
$313.7 billion Pentagon budget proposed by Presi
dent Reagan, met the same skepticism he encoun
tered on two previous visits to Congress this week
— despite his volunteered "hit list" of some of the
Pentagon's most favored projects.
Committee Chairman Pete Domenici (R-N.M.)
told Weinberger that few in Congress expect the
Pentagon, which is seeking a five-year growth rate
of 6.5 percent after inflation, will even receive a 5
percent increase in fiscal 1986.
And Sen. Lawton Chiles (D-Fla.), questioning
whether the nation has received what it paid for in
Reagan's trillion-dollar defense buildup, said that
the Pentagon had "no clear idea" on how to use its
funds or how to fight more effectively.
Later, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
who had been silent for most of the session as
Weinberger exchanged volleys with committee
members, asked for an opportunity to respond to
Chiles.
The suggestion that the nation was not getting its
money's worth out of the Pentagon, the chairman,
Gen. John Vessey, observed tartly, was "baloney."
He declared: "To say we don't get value received is
just pure bunk."
Weinberger had told the senators that a Pen
tagon budget freeze, after compensating for infla
tion, would not produce the savings "that
everybody is looking for" in the effort to reduce the
anticipated 1986 federal budget deficit to $180 bil
lion.

"What that would do would be to decimate the
ability of the department to continue with the pro
grams that are now in effect," he said, volunteering
for the first time a list of specific weapons he would
cancel if a freeze was approved.
"You'd have to delay by about three to four
years the present schedule of the B-l and the Ad
vanced Technology Bomber," he noted. The
Reagan administration has requested $6.2 billion
to produce 48 B-ls, completing its order at 100
airplanes, while the Advanced Technology
Bomber, commonly known as the radar-eluding
Stealth airplane, is not expected to be deployed un
til the 19905.
Weinberger also said a freeze would require a 38
percent reduction in tactical aircraft purchases, a
50 percent cut in the increased numbers in Army
and Air Force helicopters and a halt to work on the
C-17 transport plane, new D-5 missiles for Trident
submarines and two of the subs themselves.
Domenici responded: "1 have a great deal of dif
ficulty in believing that would be the result.'' The
secretary of defense said he could "go on for four
pages," but a Pentagon spokesman, Bill Caldwell,
said later he was unable to produce a cutback list.
The size of the defense budget has become a
central issue in efforts to reach an agreement be
tween the administration and the Senate's Republi
can majority on deficit reduction. But Domenici
said in a speech Thursday that unless the Pentagon
bore its share of budget cuts, any agreement "will
fall apart."
Sources on Capitol Hill said that Senate leaders
are trying to agree to a 3 percent inflation-adjusted
increase in the Pentagon budget over the next three
years.
Such an increase, they said, would reduce the
deficit as much from fiscal 1986 to 1988 as would a
one-year freeze followed by two years of annual 5
percent increases in the Pentagon's budget.

Budget analysts said that either course would
reduce the planned buildup by about $100 billion
Qygi* three years but would still permit military
spending to increase from about $247 billion this
year to more than $315 billion in l l )K8.
Domenici also endorsed the controversial re
commendation by budget director David Stockman
that Congress cut military pensions. He conceded
Stockman's fiery rhetoric was "out of line," but
said that if cost-of-living adjustments in Social Se
curity pensions were frozen consideration should
be given as well to freezing similar adjustments in
military pensions. Stockman had described the mil
itary pension system as a scandal.
Meanwhile, Senate Republicans were pressing
the suggestion that Social Security cost-of-living
adjustments be frozen for a year. Majority Leader
Robert Dole (R-Kan.), for example, told the
American Bankers Association that Republicans
had agreed to include in their budget package a
plan to bypass the scheduled Social Security adjust
ment if it did not become a "politicized, polarized
issue."
Noting that Reagan has recommended no change
in Social Security benefits. Dole added that the way
to persuade the president to alter his position was
through a "bipartisan group willing to make that
change." Democrats, however, have shown no in
clination to tamper with Social Security.
Domenici, echoing Dole's remarks, also said he
supported a Social Security freeze "if we can put
together a deficit reduction package of $50 billion
or more. That is the conditionally."
In the Senate, sources said that Republican
leaders were seeking a compromise on the budget
package that would protect Social Security
recipients living near or under the poverty line
from falling further behind economically. Under
this plan, beneficiaries would receive an inflation
adjustment for retirement benefits next year.

to persuade the president to alter his position was
through a "bipartisan group willing to make that
change." Democrats, however, have shown no in
clination to tamper with Social Security.
Domenici, echoing Dole's remarks, also said he
supported a Social Security freeze "if we can put
together a deficit reduction package of $50 billion
or more. That is the conditionally."
In the Senate, sources said that Republican
leaders were seeking a compromise on the budget
package that would protect Social Security
recipients living near or under the poverty line
from falling further behind economically. Under
this plan, beneficiaries would receive an inflation
adjustment for retirement benefits next year.
WASHINGTON — Secretary of Defense
Caspar Weinberger told the Senate Budget Com
mittee yesterday that a defense spending freeze
would decimate the Pentagon's programs, delaying
work on the B-l and "Stealth" bombers, reducing
the fleet of tactical aircraft, halting development of
a new transport airplane and blocking the purchase
of two submarines.
But Weinberger, trying to fend off cuts in the
$313.7 billion Pentagon budget proposed by Presi
dent Reagan, met the same skepticism he encoun
tered on two previous visits to Congress this week
— despite his volunteered "hit list" of some of the
Pentagon's most favored projects.
Committee Chairman Pete Domenici (R-N.M.)
told Weinberger that few in Congress expect the
Pentagon, which is seeking a five-year growth rate
of 6.5 percent after inflation, will even receive a 5
percent increase in fiscal 1986.
And Sen. Lawton Chiles (D-Fla.), questioning
whether the nation has received what it paid for in
Reagan's trillion-dollar defense buildup, said that
the Pentagon had "no clear idea" on how to use its
funds or how to fight more effectively.
Later, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
who had been silent for most of the session as
Weinberger exchanged volleys with committee
members, asked for an opportunity to respond to
Chiles.
The suggestion that the nation was not getting its
money's worth out of the Pentagon, the chairman,
Gen. John Vessey, observed tartly, was "baloney."
He declared: "To say we don't get value received is
just pure bunk."
Weinberger had told the senators that a Pen
tagon budget freeze, after compensating for infla
tion, would not produce the savings "that
everybody is looking for" in the effort to reduce the
anticipated 1986 federal budget deficit to $180 bil
lion.

"What that would do would be to decimate the
ability of the department to continue with the pro
grams that are now in effect," he said, volunteering
for the first time a list of specific weapons he would
cancel if a freeze was approved.
"You'd have to delay by about three to four
years the present schedule of the B-l and the Ad
vanced Technology Bomber," he noted. The
Reagan administration has requested $6.2 billion
to produce 48 B-ls, completing its order at 100
airplanes, while the Advanced Technology
Bomber, commonly known as the radar-eluding
Stealth airplane, is not expected to be deployed un
til the 19905.
Weinberger also said a freeze would require a 38
percent reduction in tactical aircraft purchases, a
50 percent cut in the increased numbers in Army
and Air Force helicopters and a halt to work on the
C-17 transport plane, new D-5 missiles for Trident
submarines and two of the subs themselves.
Domenici responded: "1 have a great deal of dif
ficulty in believing that would be the result.'' The
secretary of defense said he could "go on for four
pages," but a Pentagon spokesman, Bill Caldwell,
said later he was unable to produce a cutback list.
The size of the defense budget has become a
central issue in efforts to reach an agreement be
tween the administration and the Senate's Republi
can majority on deficit reduction. But Domenici
said in a speech Thursday that unless the Pentagon
bore its share of budget cuts, any agreement "will
fall apart."
Sources on Capitol Hill said that Senate leaders
are trying to agree to a 3 percent inflation-adjusted
increase in the Pentagon budget over the next three
years.
Such an increase, they said, would reduce the
deficit as much from fiscal 1986 to 1988 as would a
one-year freeze followed by two years of annual 5
percent increases in the Pentagon's budget.

Budget analysts said that either course would
reduce the planned buildup by about $100 billion
Qygi* three years but would still permit military
spending to increase from about $247 billion this
year to more than $315 billion in l l )K8.
Domenici also endorsed the controversial re
commendation by budget director David Stockman
that Congress cut military pensions. He conceded
Stockman's fiery rhetoric was "out of line," but
said that if cost-of-living adjustments in Social Se
curity pensions were frozen consideration should
be given as well to freezing similar adjustments in
military pensions. Stockman had described the mil
itary pension system as a scandal.
Meanwhile, Senate Republicans were pressing
the suggestion that Social Security cost-of-living
adjustments be frozen for a year. Majority Leader
Robert Dole (R-Kan.), for example, told the
American Bankers Association that Republicans
had agreed to include in their budget package a
plan to bypass the scheduled Social Security adjust
ment if it did not become a "politicized, polarized
issue."
Noting that Reagan has recommended no change
in Social Security benefits. Dole added that the way
to persuade the president to alter his position was
through a "bipartisan group willing to make that
