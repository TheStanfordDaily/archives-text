# Killers of priest sentenced

### 
TORUN, Poland â€” A Polish court yesterday
convicted four secret police officers of murdering
one of the nation's most popular Roman Catholic
priests but rejected possible death penalties and
sentenced all four to long prison terms.
Capt. Grzegorz Piotrowski, 33, described as the
chief organizer of the killing, and 47-year-old Col.
Adam Pietruszka, the most senior of the accused
men, were both sentenced to 25-year prison terms,
the longest possible under Polish law. Both men
were also deprived of their basic civil rights for an
additional 10 years.
Two junior officers, Lt. Lescek Pekala, 32, and
Lt. Waldemar Chmielewski, 29, were given prison
terms of 15 and 14 years, respectively.
All four were convicted in connection with the
kidnap and killing last October of the Rev. Jerzy
Popieluszko, widely respected in this staunchly
Catholic nation for his outspoken condemnation of
the Communist government's repressive measures

and his support for the outlawed Solidarity free
trade union movement.
"They wanted to kill and they implemented their
plan," Chief Judge Artur Kujawa said in a 75-
minute statement explaining the verdict. "The in
tention to kill existed before the abduction."
Kujawa also noted that during the few hours be
tween the time the 37-year-old priest was pulled
from his automobile near here and when his body
was thrown into a reservoir, he was treated with
"exceptional cruelty and ruthlessness."
Popieluszko was severely beaten before he was
dumped in the trunk of a secret police vehicle and
taken to the reservoir.
Kujawa said the court rejected the death penalty,
which the prosecution requested for Piotrowski,
because "according to Poland's Socialist penal law,
punishment imposed by the court is not and should
not be revenge. Punishment," he added, "is
supposed to educate and deter."

The defendants are expected to appeal the sen
tences to the Polish Supreme Court, a process that
could take months.
Popieluszko's murder stunned and outraged the
Polish public and presented the government of
Premier Wojciech Jaruzelski with a major crisis.
In an apparent attempt to dampen public anger
and to discipline the country's increasingly inde
pendent state security aparatus, Jaruzelski took the
unprecedented step of ordering a public trial for
the se'cret police officers. Piotrowski, by far the
most articulate and composed of the defendants
during the 26-day trial, stared at the ceiling as the
verdict was read, then slumped forward, head in
hands, and began to sob.
Pietruszka, a 24-year veteran of the secret police
and the only one of the four accused to plead not
guilty, stood expressionless as tears welled in his
eyes.
