O'Neill attacks Reagan
WASHINGTON — House Speaker Thomas
"Tip" O'Neill (D-Mass.), unusually conciliatory
toward President Reagan since the November
elections, resumed the attack yesterday, accusing
Reagan of not being "honest with the American
people," particularly about the federal budget
deficits, in his State of the Union address Wed
nesday night.
He charged that Reagan has "mesmerized"
and misled the American people about who is re
sponsible for the budget deficit, and he particu
larly disputed Reagan's assertion that the deficit
is the result of "nearly 50 years of government's
living beyond its means."
"That clever rhetoric covers up the facts,"
O'Neill said. "In 1981, when President Reagan
took office, the national debt was just over $900
billion. Today it is $1.8 trillion, double what it
was when he took office. .. . The debt will be $3
trillion when he leaves office, triple what it was
when the Reagan revolution began."
He urged the president to "start with the facts.
"Let us work hard to cut the deficit, Mr. Presi
dent, but... do not point the finger at the distant
past when you yourself have so much responsibil
ity for these deficits resting on your own
shoulders."
Haig talks on terrorism
WASHINGTON — Former Secretary of State
Alexander Haig said yesterday that President
Reagan probably could have prevented the
deaths of 241 U.S. Marines in Lebanon in 1983
by retaliating for earlier terrorists acts, and he
declared that the White House "damn well bet

ter" seeK vengeance for terrorism in the future.
Haig, who served as Reagan's first Secretary of
State, told the Senate Foreign Relations Com
mittee that the bloody massacre of the Marines in
their barracks near the Beirut airport in October
1983 probably would not have happened if the
president had responded to a previous bombing
at the U.S. Embassy by "taking Syrian
casualties" in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley.
"Had we done that, we probably wouldn't
have been faced with the destruction of the
Marine barracks," Haig said. "That is my convic
tion."
Seventeen Americans and 46 other persons
were killed in the April 1983 bombing of the
U.S. Embassy in Beirut.
Although the president threatened retaliation
at the time of the Beirut bombings, he later ex
plained that the United States did not take action
against the terrorists because the CIA lacked
positive proof of who was responsible. Reagan
also said that the U.S. government feared inno
cent civilians might be hurt by an act of retalia
tion.
Haig, who was forced to resign from the
Reagan administration in June 1982 after a series
of policy disagreements with the White House,
said there was little doubt within the U.S. intelli
gence community following the bombing of the
U.S. Embassy that it had been carried out by
Iranian militants acting on behalf of the govern
ment of Syria. At the time, Syrian military forces
were based in the Bekaa Valley northeast of
Beirut.
"I happen to think the violence in Lebanon at
the time of the destruction of the embassy was
such that some very vigorous action against the
Syrian camps in the Bekaa Valey would probably
have been appropriate and not too difficult to

do," Haig said. "I don't believe the consensus
would have been against it, had it been carried
out promptly, surgically and with success."
Haig strongly advocated U.S. retaliation
against terrorism as a matter of principle.
"Inaction in the face of a terrorist assaults is a
far greater risk in the long run because it con
vinces assorted hit men and fanatics and the cal
culating governments who help them that we are
too confused and too fearful to resist," he said.
"The point is to be sure that those who engage
in terrorism know that we just might, and where
we have hard evidence that a nation was involved
I would say we should (retaliate), unless it is an
act of imprudence."
The former secretary of state noted that
Reagan freqently had warned that the United
States would retaliate against terrorism directed
at U.S. personnel or facilities around the world,
but that the administration had never followed
up on that threat.
"I think he's talked himself into a position
where he damn well better," he said. "The gap
between our resounding rhetoric and our demon
strated resolve may be the most dangerous im
balance of all."
High trade spurs stocks
Blue-chip issues rejoined the stock market's
rally in heavy trading yesterday as the Dow Jones
industrial average fell just short of-j record high.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up
nearly 1 1 points at midsession, closed with a
9.49-point gain at 1,290.08 — exactly offsetting
its loss over the two previous sessions. The ad
vance left the average less than three points shy
of its record high 1,292.62 reached Jan. 29.

tion.
Haig, who was forced to resign from the
Reagan administration in June 1982 after a series
of policy disagreements with the White House,
said there was little doubt within the U.S. intelli
gence community following the bombing of the
U.S. Embassy that it had been carried out by
Iranian militants acting on behalf of the govern
ment of Syria. At the time, Syrian military forces
were based in the Bekaa Valley northeast of
Beirut.
"I happen to think the violence in Lebanon at
the time of the destruction of the embassy was
such that some very vigorous action against the
Syrian camps in the Bekaa Valey would probably
have been appropriate and not too difficult to

do," Haig said. "I don't believe the consensus
would have been against it, had it been carried
out promptly, surgically and with success."
Haig strongly advocated U.S. retaliation
against terrorism as a matter of principle.
"Inaction in the face of a terrorist assaults is a
far greater risk in the long run because it con
vinces assorted hit men and fanatics and the cal
culating governments who help them that we are
too confused and too fearful to resist," he said.
"The point is to be sure that those who engage
in terrorism know that we just might, and where
we have hard evidence that a nation was involved
I would say we should (retaliate), unless it is an
act of imprudence."
The former secretary of state noted that
Reagan freqently had warned that the United
States would retaliate against terrorism directed
at U.S. personnel or facilities around the world,
but that the administration had never followed
up on that threat.
"I think he's talked himself into a position
where he damn well better," he said. "The gap
between our resounding rhetoric and our demon
strated resolve may be the most dangerous im
balance of all."
High trade spurs stocks
Blue-chip issues rejoined the stock market's
rally in heavy trading yesterday as the Dow Jones
industrial average fell just short of-j record high.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up
nearly 1 1 points at midsession, closed with a
9.49-point gain at 1,290.08 — exactly offsetting
its loss over the two previous sessions. The ad
vance left the average less than three points shy
of its record high 1,292.62 reached Jan. 29.
O'Neill attacks Reagan
WASHINGTON — House Speaker Thomas
"Tip" O'Neill (D-Mass.), unusually conciliatory
toward President Reagan since the November
elections, resumed the attack yesterday, accusing
Reagan of not being "honest with the American
people," particularly about the federal budget
deficits, in his State of the Union address Wed
nesday night.
He charged that Reagan has "mesmerized"
and misled the American people about who is re
sponsible for the budget deficit, and he particu
larly disputed Reagan's assertion that the deficit
is the result of "nearly 50 years of government's
living beyond its means."
"That clever rhetoric covers up the facts,"
O'Neill said. "In 1981, when President Reagan
took office, the national debt was just over $900
billion. Today it is $1.8 trillion, double what it
was when he took office. .. . The debt will be $3
trillion when he leaves office, triple what it was
when the Reagan revolution began."
He urged the president to "start with the facts.
"Let us work hard to cut the deficit, Mr. Presi
dent, but... do not point the finger at the distant
past when you yourself have so much responsibil
ity for these deficits resting on your own
shoulders."
Haig talks on terrorism
WASHINGTON — Former Secretary of State
Alexander Haig said yesterday that President
Reagan probably could have prevented the
deaths of 241 U.S. Marines in Lebanon in 1983
by retaliating for earlier terrorists acts, and he
declared that the White House "damn well bet

ter" seeK vengeance for terrorism in the future.
Haig, who served as Reagan's first Secretary of
State, told the Senate Foreign Relations Com
mittee that the bloody massacre of the Marines in
their barracks near the Beirut airport in October
1983 probably would not have happened if the
president had responded to a previous bombing
at the U.S. Embassy by "taking Syrian
casualties" in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley.
"Had we done that, we probably wouldn't
have been faced with the destruction of the
Marine barracks," Haig said. "That is my convic
tion."
Seventeen Americans and 46 other persons
were killed in the April 1983 bombing of the
U.S. Embassy in Beirut.
Although the president threatened retaliation
at the time of the Beirut bombings, he later ex
plained that the United States did not take action
against the terrorists because the CIA lacked
positive proof of who was responsible. Reagan
also said that the U.S. government feared inno
cent civilians might be hurt by an act of retalia
tion.
