Critics worldwide are singing the praises of the new Bose" Acoustic Wave™
Music System.
Why? Because the Bose Acoustic Wave Music System is smaller than a con
ventional bookshelf speaker, yet it can outperform large component systems
costing up to five times as much.
After investing 14 years and 13 million dollars, Bose achieved a technological
breakthrough with the Acoustic Wave Music System: produce clear, deep
and powerful bass notes within a small enclosure.
The final critic is you. To really appreciate the remarkable sound of the
Acoustic Wave Music System, you have to hear it for yourself. For a demon
stration to remember, call Jon Mann, your campus representative,
at 323-3070.
Better sound through research.
