No benefit cuts planned
WASHINGTON — The majority whips of the
House and Senate said yesterday that Congress is
prepared to freeze cost-of-living increases for the
nation's 36 million Social Security recipients next
year, but that benefits will not be cut.
Rep. Thomas Foley (D-Wash.) said a freeze
"will be last on the list" of budget-cutting
proposals, but Sen. Alan Simpson (R-Wyo.) in
sisted that such action is needed to make inroads
against the federal deficit.
"I think we have to do that. It's a question of
(reductions) across the board. Unless we do it for
Social Security . . . we're not going to get it
done," Simpson said on the NBC program " Meet
The Press."
"We're not taking away existing benefits,
we're freezing the cost-of-living allowance," he
continued. "We intend to take care of those at
the poverty level with no cuts, no reductions.
We're not out to do a number on the poor in
America."
In recent weeks, Senate Republican leaders
have been inching toward a formal recommenda
tion that Social Security cost-of-living increases
be frozen for a year as part of a $50 billion pack
age of cuts in domestic and defense programs.
President Reagan, meanwhile, has said he will
look at such a plan if it were backed overwhelm
ingly by both Democrats and Republicans on
Capitol Hill.

Aid cuts called warlike
WASHINGTON — New York University
President John Brademas charged yesterday that
President Reagan's proposal to cut $2 billion in
student aid amounts to "a declaration of war on
middle-income America."
The former Indiana congressman urged college
presidents attending the Association of Ameri
can Colleges meeting to "enter the battle that
will be waged this in Washington.
"If higher education is to survive, and, indeed,
flourish, it will be up to you," he said in a speech
last night. "This is war, and we need every one of
you in our ranks."
Brademas, a Rhodes scholar who helped
create student aid programs during his 22 years
in Congress, also charged that the Reagan budget
cuts along with proposed new tax changes would
inflict "a triple whammy" on higher education.
The Treasury Department tax plan, which
Reagan has not specifically endorsed, would
sharply restrict deductions for charitable giving.
It would also eliminate the deduction for state
and local taxes, which help pay school bills.
In the fiscal 1986 budget he sent to Congress
last Monday, Reagan proposed cutting federal
loans, grants and work-study subsidies for more
than 1 million of the 5 million current recipients.
He would end Guaranteed Student Loans to
students from families with adjusted gross
incomes above $32,500; bar Pell Grants and

other aid to students with family incomes above
$25,000, and clamp a $4,000 lid on annual help
to any student, no matter how poor.
Brademas also branded as "nonsense" the
charge by Budget Director David A. Stockman
Thursday that college presidents are only
"worried about financing their budgets," not
about students.
Gun thieves will appeal
WASHING 1 ON — Three of the soldiers con
victed of stealing Soviet-made automatic rifles
from a warehouse in Grenada as souvenirs are
"in a limbo status" while their cases are appealed
and are bitter that a Navy vice admiral and his
staff were not punished for the same offense, the
soldiers' attorneys said yesterday.
Former staff Sgt. Allen Cassatt, one of at least
seven lower-ranking soldiers and Marines court
martialed on theft charges, has said his son, 12,
attempted suicide because of the strain of the
court-martial and his father's imprisonment.
Another soldier, former Sgt. Bruce Willard,
was dismissed but not discharged from the Army
and remains on a form of inactive duty,
prevented from working or associating with other
soldiers.
The third, former Capt. John Dorsz, spent
three months in jail and is jobless while pressing
his appeal that the Army violated a federal am
nesty offer in prosecuting him.
