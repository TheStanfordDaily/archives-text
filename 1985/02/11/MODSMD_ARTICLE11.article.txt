Gas prices moving up
LOS ANGELES — Gasoline prices, which
have dropped steadily for the past three months
to their lowest level since 1980, are likely to
climb to reflect an increase in wholesale prices,
an oil industry analyst said yesterday.
Although pump prices for all grades of gas
dropped 0.7 cents in the past two weeks,
wholesale prices increased 0.3 cents during the
same period, said analyst Dan Lundberg.
Dealers arc sacrificing nearly a penny in mar
gin for every gallon they sell because of the dis
parity in retail and wholesale prices, he said.
"Dealers move very swiftly to respond to
wholesale increases," Lundberg said. "There's a
great likelihood of at least a penny increase in the
near future, as they (dealers) try to compensate
for what they've lost in this period."
The nationwide average price for a gallon of
regular leaded self-serve during the survey per
iod Jan. 25 to Feb. 8 was $1.01. Regular un

leaded selt-serve was selling for $1.08, and
premium unleaded self-serve for $1.23,
Lundberg said. Self-service pumps account for
about 75 percent of all gasoline stations, he said.
In Lundberg's latest survey of gas prices, the
lowest price in the nation was found in Denver,
where the average cost of a gallon of regular
leaded self-serve gas was 89.8 cents.
Scam bilks immigrants
LOS ANGELES — Unscrupulous notaries
who promise to help obtain green cards or docu
ments such as U.S. birth certificates are cheating
immigrants out of thousands of dollars, officials
say.
The notary public is an important government
official in Latin American countries, but in the
United States notaries merely have power to wit
ness signatures on documents for a fee of no
more than $10.
Some immigrants, unaware of the difference,

pay high prices for phony green cards, U.S.
residency credentials that can he obtained only
through official channels.
"It's not their fault, bless their hearts; they're
just uneducated," said John Andrade, an inves
tigator for the California Secretary of State Of
fice who specializes in notary fraud. "But their
money is as green as anyone else's."
Favio Oliveres, 36, a legal Cuban refugee, said
he paid a total of $500 to two notaries to get a
green card for permanent residency. The first
notary disappeared after Oliveres paid him $200,
and the second took $300 and and then told him
he was ineligible for a green card, Oliveres said.
"They take advantage of me because I don't
know language or customs here," he said. He
never reported the incident to authorities, he
said.
