## Scholarship aids students serving the public 
### BARBARA SCHULER 
"The generalization that students
now are interested in economic secur
ity and material well-being, I think is
a lair one. But the altruistic spirit is
alive and well, too. And a challenge is
being made to selfishness and ex
cessive concern for security," Dean of
the Chapel Robert Hamerton-Kelly
said.
The R.G. Hamerton-Kelly Schol
arship Fund, set up in early 1983 by
the Friends of Memorial Church as a
girt marking the dean's 10th year at
Stanford, has not lacked for enthusi
astic applicants, bearing tesimony to
his words.
Although it has received con
siderably less publicity than more
recently instituted programs such as
the Stanford University Public Ser
vice Fellowships and the Volunteer
Network, the scholarship fund at
tracted 20 applicants in its first year
and awarded live with scholarships
averaging $800. This past summer, its
second year, the number of applicants
increased by 50 percent and 11 schol
arships were given.
"The range of our commitment is
broad. We try to support students
doing service in the international
community, nationally and locally,"
Hamerton-Kelly said. Scholarship
recipients have served in Africa, Asia
and East Palo Alto, among other
locations.
The scholarship fund's emphasis is
on "direct human service. . . . All
things being equal, we'd probably fa
vor someone with a background of
religious activity. But as you can see
from the record of scholarships we've
provided, we've funded more
humanitarian than specifically religi
ous projects," Hamerton-Kelly said.
The list of project sponsors — Vol
unteers in Asia, Crossroads Africa,
the United Nations, USAID and two

law firms, among others — does dis
play a relative lack of projects spon
sored by religiously affiliated organi
zations. Junior John McGovern's
work with the Columbia Road Health
Service, run by the non
denominational Church of Christ
based in Wahington, D.C., was the
sole such project.
McGovern, who worked as a hand
yman and all-around gopher at the
health service in the largely black and
Hispanic Adams-Morgan district of
Wahington, admitted that there was
nothing glorious "about hauling beds
from a donor's attic to a local shelter
(for the homeless). . . . But the
people I was working with made it
worthwhile. There was a great atmo
sphere . . . and a real sense of com
munity."
Law student Chip Pitts worked in
Johannesburg, South Africa, with the
Legal Resources Center — a firm
sponsoring its second Hamerton-
Kelly scholarship recipient in as many
years. Pitts advised workers of their
legal rights under new, liberalized
labor laws, in addition to bargaining
on their behalf with corporate attor
neys. "Helping individuals and seeing
the concrete results of my efforts"
made the prospect of remaining with
the center, the country's only public
interest law firm, "extremely tempt
ing," he said.
Pitts emphasized that there are
negative aspects to doing public
interest law in a country like South
Africa. "By working within a legal
system of institutionalized racism,
you're implicitly accepting as
legitimate the system whose apar
theid laws deny blacks even the most
basic rights," he said. By "operating
within the system, (the center) shores
up the myth that South Africa
operates under the rule of law. And
by allowing some blacks access to the

legal system, it masks gross inequities
in both procedural and substantive
law."
However, Pitts concluded that "the
effort was worthwhile . . . the small
victories are worth it."
Kien Pham, another scholarship
recipient, spent his summer in
Thailand consulting for the U.S.
Agency for International Develop
ment. In addition to his official work,
Pham set up a support network for
Vietnamese rape victims — assaulted
by "pirates" who prey on the boat
people and loot their belongings —
and collected information on orphan
refugees as part of his efforts in the
United States to make structural
changes expediting the refugee adop
tion process.
Pham, who has himself tried to
adopt a boy he met at the camp, ex

plained that in addition to strict U.S.
adoption laws, "these kids live under
the guardianship of the U.N. The
matter gets even more complicated
because of that." Regarding his own
lack of success, Pham said, "For a
single male to adopt in this country,
they laugh at you. It's very difficult to
do."
The political controversiality of
certain human-service projects has
not yet caused problems for the
scholarship committee, according to
Hamerton-Kelly. However, work
with such technically illegal groups as
the sanctuary movement "would re
quire some thought," he acknowl
edged. "We don't stay away from
them (political projects) on principle
though," Hamerton-Kelly said, citing
the example of the grant given to
Nina Bohlen for her work with the

Valley Oak Institute for Voter Partic
ipation.
Bohlen, a coterminal student in
East Asian Studies, was co-director
of the institute's summer voter
registration drive. The project's
"most important" contributions were
"the number of low-income, minority
and student voters we registered . . .
and the training and education of stu
dents who worked as staff and as vol
unteers," according to her assess
ment.
Although the organization of the
community, which was an inevitable
part of the registration process, was a
benefit "in a less obvious sense," it is
the aspect of her summer's efforts of
which she is most proud, Bohlen said.
In San Mateo County, she organized
a coalition of "peace groups,
women's groups and labor groups

unifying through the vehicle of voter
registration." Sounding pleased and a
bit amazed, Bohlen added, "the coal
ition is still persisting."
Both Kelly and the scholarship
recipients stressed the inevitable
practical and political education
gained from social service work. Said
Robert Townsend, Pitts' predecessor
at the Legal Resources Center in
South Africa, "to the extent that
someone views firsthand what goes
on behind a legalistic system, it really
changes your perspective. My own in
dividual commitment was
strengthened by it."
Danish doctoral student Palle
Henckel, who did a one-month in
ternship with the United Nations,
gained some insight into public ser
vice which re-affirmed some of the
myths which still taint the reputation
of public-sector jobs. "I certainly got
incredible insight into the U.N. At
one level it was very exciting because
you realize the potential in the U.N.,
but it's also very disappointing be
cause you see so much being
frustrated by the politics."
Henckel, like most recipients of the
Hamerton-Kelly scholarships, had to
supplement his summer work with
other funds. "It certainly didn't pay
for everything, but it's a step on the
way," he said. While Henckel used
personal savings, some recipients ap
plied for other grants from their de
partments and from other founda
tions.
However, many recipients con
curred with Pitts, who said, "I
wouldn't have been able to do it if
Dean Hamerton-Kelly hadn't
helped."
Bohlen, echoing Pitts' gratitude,
said, "I can't emphasize enough how
much even a small grant can do. That
$500 was a godsend."
