The Faculty Senate decided Thursday to inves
tigate the impact of the Ward committee's
recommendations on joint appointments.
This is a necessary and commendable move on
the part of the Faculty Senate because it signifies
an effort to answer a series of long-standing ques
tions: What is the relationship between Stanford
and the Hoover Institution? Should this relation
ship be strengthened, given the partisan bent of
Hoover? Should this relationship be encouraged
at the expense of the autonomy of University de
partments?
Unfortunately, however, the investigating
committee the senate decided to form Thursday
will probably not be able to address the entire
issue of Hoover-Stanford relations; faculty mem
bers indicated a desire to restrict the response to
the effects of the Ward recommendations. And
that's too bad. The parameters of what needs to
be discussed are much wider.
Those who have been following the Hoover-
Stanford issue closely will recall that a special
five-member Board of Trustees committee was
created last year to look into the Hoover-
Stanford relationship. To say that the committee
has accomplished nothing would be unfair, but it
has not released any findings to date. At the risk
of sounding like a broken record, the Stanford
community should know the status of the board

committee's investigation.
The Ward committee initially offered hope that
the Hoover-Stanford relationship would get the
scrutiny it deserves, but here, too, there were
problems. The committee was limited by its
charge to look at only joint appointments be
tween the two institutions — presupposing the
need for strengthening relations between Hoover
and Stanford — and not at the Hoover-Stanford
relationship as a whole. In addition, the six
member committee was stacked 4-to-2 in
Hoover's favor, making anything but a pro-
Hoover outcome unlikely.
Thus, we're left with the need for an unbiased
committee to look into the overall Hoover-
Stanford relationship. If its charge is designed
properly, if it is asked to look at not just the Ward
committee recommendations, but at the entire
Hoover-Stanford relationship, the Faculty Senate
committee could fulfill that need.
Given such a broad charge as investigating the
entire Hoover-Stanford relationship, the Faculty
Senate committee would have to work harder,
and perhaps the process would take years, not
months. But so many questions about the
Hoover-Stanford relationship are still waiting to
be answered, it would be a tragic mistake to let
this opportunity for an honest investigation slip
by.
