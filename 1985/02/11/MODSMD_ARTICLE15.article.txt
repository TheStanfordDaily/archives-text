# 'Subway vigilante': a case for killing in self-defense?
## 
### 
A Manhattan grand jury has refused to in
dict Bernhard Goetz, the so-called subway
vigilante, for murder. The prominence given
to this story, together with a subway story in
Garry Trudeau's "Doonesbury," shows that
self-defense is still a topic very much in the
news.
In fact, recent news stories from Chicago
tell of several elderly individuals who have
used deadly force in fending off attackers.
On Dec. 22, Goetz shot four youths who
harassed him for money on a New York sub
way. Afterward he told a neighbor that he had
been frightened.
The reactions to the subway shooting have
been varied. San Jose attorney Richard Al
exander wrote an opinion column for the San
Jose Mercury News saying that "there can be
no toleration" of such acts. Nationally synd
icated conservative columnist James Kilpatrick
said that "law must prevail over vengeance."
Mayors, police chiefs and prosecuting at
torneys across the country made numerous
pious statements along the same lines and
then called for spending more taxpayers'
money "to restore the public's confidence in
the criminal justice system."
But there is a case to be made for killing in
self-defense during a robbery. And there is
also a case for the right of people to carry
fifCarms for self-defense.

By not indicting Goetz for murder, the
grand jury indicated its belief that Goetz was
defending himself against robbery. If subse
quent examination of the evidence shows that
this jury was wrong, then Goetz should have

been indicted. (Such re-examination could
occur during upcoming civil rights or personal
damage suits.)
But whatever the historical truth turns out
to be, it is still valuable to consider the argu
ments for self-defense and the right to bear
arms.
Robbery differs from theft in that a theft is
a secret act done without the victim's knowl
edge. Robbery is a face-to-face experience.
Although robbery is the taking of another
person's goods, its definitive characteristic is
the use of force or the threat of force against
the owner.

What are the victim's rights under the cir
cumstances? Surely the victim has the right to
defend himself or herself and his or her prop
erty. Moral philosophers would then correctly
add that the victim should only kill the per
petrator if this is necessary to halt the crime.
What are the criminal's rights? After all,
criminals are people too. But we must give
full respect to justice here. The criminal has
transgressed against the victim's rights. That
transgression does not make the criminal a
mere "wild beast" to be dealt with accord
ingly.
But by trespassing against the victim's
rights and threatening or using force against
the victim's person, the criminal forfeits the
usual respect that should be accorded his or
her right to life. It is the robber's threat to the
life of the victim that makes the robber's life
legitimately subject to the victim's acts of self
defense.
What about the right to carry firearms? If
you believe that people have a right to self
defense, then it is reasonable to conclude that
people have a right to carry handguns and
other appropriate self-defense technology.
Gun control advocates are dreaming if they
think that juries in America will convict
people of serious felonies (that is, violations
of gun control laws) in clear-cut cases of self

defense or in cases of a victim's defense of his
or her family.
Opponents of gun bans are convinced —
correctly, I believe — that handgun restric
tions are ineffective in combating crime and
are unconstitutional.
Anti-gun laws were originally enacted as a
means of persecuting racial minorities and im
migrants. They also became a progressive
liberal cause after the failure of the liberals'
first grand experiment in combating violent
crime — alcohol prohibition.
The overwhelming weight of statistical
evidence shows that handgun-banning states
have the same or higher levels of violent
crime than the states that allow handguns —
even though the states that ban handguns are
demographically less crime-prone.
The Constitution's Bill of Rights recognizes
the right to bear arms. Liberals, who should
know better than to construe the Bill of
Rights in favor of big government, have spent
considerable time downgrading the Second
Amendment.
These liberals conclude that the "militia
clause" negates the right to bear arms. Ac
cording to these liberals, this part of the Bill
of Rights was not intended as a protection of
the people against government power. It was
merely a plan for a National Guard under
government control.

Fortunately for the lives and liberties of the
American people, these fair-weather
defenders of the Bill of Rights are wrong.
"Militia" meant to the framers all able
bodied citizens capable of bearing arms. The
"militia clause" as well as the "right to bear
arms clause" were intended to protect the
rights of an armed citizenry. Perhaps someday
the U.S. Supreme Court will see its way to
clearly upholding the historic rights of the
people under the Second Amendment.
The subway shooting incident has caused
much comment. It highlights a class division
in our country. San Jose Mercury News col
umnist Joanne Jacobs has neatly described
the two classes. The first is the Volvo class —
which lives in safe neighborhoods and travels
through the seedy parts of town with "the
windows rolled up." The second is the victim
class — "which lives and commutes with
young thugs and has no protection from street
crime."
The Volvo class is all for simply letting the
government handle crime. But the Volvo class
is wrong. We should defend the victims'
rights. We should defend their right to self
defense and their right to own, carry and use
firearms in self-defense.
