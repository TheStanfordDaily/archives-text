Respect Palestine
. Prof. Menahein Milson (The
Jan. 29) would still have us
bplieve that "the root of the Arab-
Israeli conflict is the Arabian refusal
to recognize Israel." It is surprising
that Milson makes such a claim in
spite of the fact that all neighboring
Arab states have accepted numerous
U.N. resolutions calling for the
mutual recognition of all states in the
nfgipn. It is equally surprising that
Milson does not specify which Israel
he wants recognized: Is it the Israel
of the U.N. partition plan of 1947
which would have occupied about
halfof the historical area called
Palestine? Or is it the Israel of 1948
Which occupied 70 percent of
Palestine? Or is it the Israel of 1967
which occupied all of Palestine and
large areas of neighboring Egypt and

Syria? Or is it perhaps the Israel of
1982 which includes the south of
Lebanon? Or is it the Israel of Ariel
Sharon and his colleagues who
believe that Israel's sphere of influ
ence should extend as far as Pakis
tan?
Does Milson really believe that the
Palestinians on the West Bank do
not recognize Israel? As a former
administrator of that territory he
should know better. We Palestinians
who have suffered under brutal
Israeli occupation for 19 years,
whose children were killed, whose
lands were confiscated, whose insti
tutions were paralyzed, whose
elected mayors were deposed (by
Milson), whose universities were
shut down for long periods during
every academic year, would be a
nation of lunatics if we still failed to
recognize Israel, the fifth-strongest

military power on this globe.
The root of the problem, Prof.
Milson, is not the refusal to recog
nize Israel. The root is the Zionist
ideology that refuses to accommodate
the fact that two peoples live on the
same piece of land, two peoples who
should have the same rights to self
determination, freedom from ex
ploitation, and equality.
The conflict in the Middle East
cannot be resolved by the policies
that Milson advocates. Indeed, his
policies proved to be a failure when
he was the civil administrator of the
West Bank. Milson tried to create by
force an alternative leadership for
the Palestinian people by supporting
quislings called the Village Leagues.
He tried to create a new leadership
by arming a group that, according to
a Time magazine poll (Sept. 20,
1982), was supported by only 0.2

percent of the population. He failed
to accept the poll results indicating
that 98.2 percent of the West Bank
residents want an independent Pales
tinian state, and that 86 percent
would like a Palestinian state run by
the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion.
We Palestinians on the West Bank
have been suffering from occupation
for 19 years. We are more eager
than Milson to reach a just resolu
tion of the conflict. On numerous
occasions our leaders have expressed
their willingness to recognize Israel.
However, none of the Israeli leaders
have accepted our right to choose
our own leadership; none have been
willing to negotiate with this leader
ship. Indeed, Milson deposed the
democratically elected mayors of the
West Bank. Peace will not be
achieved unless Milson and the

Israeli establishment respect the
rights of the Palestinians to self
determination and freedom.

Israeli propaganda
I am sorry to see Stanford become
a regular venue for former adminis
trators of the Israeli-occupied West
Bank ana Gaza to promote the
annexationist policies of Israel. In
one week Col. Menachem Milson
and former military governor Aryeh
Shalev, both dressed in
"respectable" professorial garb and
carrying the requisite academic
credentials, addressed large campus
audiences.
It is sadder yet to find The Daily
mouthing their propaganda. By

referring to Milson as "chief of the
civil administration in Judea and
Samaria" (Jan. 29) and to Shalev as
"former military governor of two
Israeli provinces" (Feb. 4), it seems
The Daily accepts Israel's bibilical
claim to the West Bank and rejects
the right of the Palestinian people to
self-determination. If this is so, I
wish to hear your defense of an
nexationist policies which have been
condemned by the United Nations,
the United States included, since
1967.
Frankly, I believe your reporters
simply failed to do their homework.
But that is no excuse for swallowing,
hook, line and sinker, what any
campus speaker says, even if he or
she has prestigious academic affilia
tions.
