## South Africa and the Communist bloc 
### 
Jason Matherly's attack on what he calls liberal
hypocrisy in South Africa (The Daily, Feb. 6) provides
ait,extremely ignorant view of the world. I think
thyt most Americans, even we bleeding-heart
liberals, recognize that the countries of the Soviet
bltjc have cruel, repressive governments which
routinely deny their citizens the most basic human

rights. I for one would never want to live in Cam
bodia. Vietnam, Ethiopia or the Soviet Union. I
would also never want to live in Honduras,
Gigitemala, Chile or the Philippines, to name just a
few examples of countries with brutally oppressive
governments which receive the full support of our
government. The distinction between the repres
sion of communist and that of noncommunist
regimes is difficult to make. Anyone who calls one
categorically worse than the other is demonstrating
a sjrong ideological bias rather than any real
knowledge of world affairs.
Matherly's comparison of U.S. intervention in
Central America to its possible actions in South
Africa is absurd. How he can compare the financ
ing of weaponry, the training of military personnel
at# the effort at complete destabilization of the
Saridinista government with the verbal condemna

tions and threatened economic sanctions the
liberals want in South Africa is beyond me.
I fail to see any hypocrisy in the liberal point of
view which supports national self-determination by
each country's own citizens, all of its citizens. The
degree to which the governments of El Salvador
and Nicaragua represent the will of all their people
is open to debate and is an issue which probably re
quires further study by the determiners of U.S.
foreign policy. However, it is a known fact that the
present South African government excludes the
participation of the vast majority of its inhabitants,
representing solely the interests of the tiny white
minority.
I do not know whether the United States should
take any action in South Africa. I do know that
great damage to U.S. long-term interests has
resulted in many instances of U.S. support for
regimes which did not represent the will of the
majority of their people. Batista in Cuba, the Shah
in Iran and Somoza in Nicaragua may have ap
peared to be relatively stable alternatives to other
governmental possibilities, which included — gasp!
— communism. Eventually the cruelty and corrup
tion of these regimes led to violent radical uprisings
which threatened both specific U.S. interests and
general global stability. In my admittedlv liberal

opinion, the only possible way for the United States
to further progress toward long-term peace and
stability is by allowing the development of govern
ments which satisfy the needs of the majority of
each country's citizens. 1 do not pretend to know
enough about each country to dictate what form its
government should take.
Matherly might be interested to know that the
spectrum of political opinion in much of the world
is not as narrow as in his own native land. Commu
nist parties have been a part of the political es
tablishment in Europe and much of the Third
World for decades. The liberals in this country
whom Matherly so roundly condemns would be
considered right of center in many parts of the
globe. Much as he would like to label it as some
horrible, inadmissible extreme. I think Matherly,
along with the majority of Americans, needs to rec
ognize that communism in its various forms is cur
rently part of the mainstream of world political
thought. Cruelty, brutality and oppression are un
fortunate elements of many governments. The in
ference that such wrongs are inherent to certain
leftist systems but only aberrations in other systems
constitutes the real hypocrisy.
