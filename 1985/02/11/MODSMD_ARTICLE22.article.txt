## Red-hot Devils shoot down Card 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
TEMPE, Ariz. — Stanford Basket
ball Coach Tom Davis said it way
back in October, before the season
even started. The Cardinal could play
excellent basketball, he said, and still
finish at the bottom of the Pacific 10
Conference.
He was right.
Against Arizona Thursday night,
Stanford played as good a game as it's
played all season — and lost. Satur
day afternoon against Arizona State
before 4,553 fans at the University
Activity Center and a regional televi
sion audience, it was more of the
same.

The Sun Devils had a season-high
point total in the 91-75 victory. They
had four players score at least 12
points. They shot a season-high 68
percent from the floor. Most teams
don't shoot that well in warm-ups.
This isn't to say that Stanford
couldn't have played better. It could
have. But even if it had, it probably
wouldn't have mattered. The way the
Sun Devils played, you had to wonder
if the Phoenix Suns didn't steal their
uniforms and pull a fast one.
The loss, Stanford's fourth straight,
kept the Cardinal embedded in the
Pac-10 cellar with a 2-9 conference
record. It also lowered its overall
record to 10-11, the first time it's

been under .500 all season. Arizona
State, 11-10 overall and 6-5 in the
Pac-10, hopped on the high side of
.500 for the first time since early in
the season.
"I don't have much to say," said
Davis, who is in danger of suffering
the first losing season of his coaching
career. "I thought Arizona State just
played a very, very fine basketball
game. They hurt us with their quick
ness and hurt us on the boards inside
as well."
Arizona State Coach Bob Wein
hauer wore a smile of satisfaction
while discussing the Sun Devils' third
victory in their last four games. "A
guy from television came up to me to
tell me who the player of the game
was," he said. "But in reality, the
player of the game was the whole
team. This was our best team effort of
the season."
It was a gift from the heavens that
Stanford only trailed by five, 39-34,
at halftime. Arizona State played a
near-flawless first half, shooting 71
percent from the floor, 83 percent
from the line and having no player
with more than one personal foul.
The folks upstairs were just as gra
cious to let Stanford lose by only 16
after the second half. The Sun Devils
continued to play well. Stanford
didn't.
Maybe it was the Arizona air or the
unseasonably cold temperatures, but
in both games on the road trip Stan
ford shot over 50 percent from the
floor in the first half and under 40
percent in the second. And that's a
sure-fire way to lose a basketball
game in any coach's book.
Against Arizona, the Cardinal shot
57 percent in the first half and 33 in
the second. Against Arizona State, its
numbers were 52 in the first and 39 in
the second. All told, the Arizona
teams took 23 fewer shots and made
10 more than the Cardinal did in the
two games.
Davis, at a loss for explanations,
blamed it on inexperience, which his
team has plenty of. "1 think that it's a
mark of experience to execute in the
second half as well as you do in the
first half," he said.
Assoc. Head Coach Bruce Pearl
pointed to the early moments of the

second half as the problem. "On our
first few possessions of the second
half, we went down and didn't score,"
he explained. "And then they go to
the other end and score. 1 think the
kids got a little unraveled, and that's
because of inexperience. The kids
want to win so badly that they worry a
lot about losing."
After Arizona State guard Steve
Beck opened the second half scoring
with a free throw, Stanford forward
Greg Butler answered with a 16-foot
jumper from the right side to cut the
Sun Devil lead to four, 40-36. The
Cardinal never got closer.
While Stanford spent the next
three minutes turning the ball over —
and not scoring — Arizona State was
busy running off seven straight to
take a 47-36 lead. Stanford cut it to
eight at 56-48, but Sun Devil guard
Bobby Thomspon hit two free
throws, and then freshman sensation
Chris Sandle drove the lane, raised
his arm and almost tore off the rim
with a vicious one-hand dunk.
Sandle was fouled on the play but
missed the free throw. Cardinal cen
ter Eric Reveno grabbed the
rebound, lost it out of bounds and
the Sun Devils had the ball back.
Seconds later, a short jumper by Eric
Holloway made it 62-60, and the rout
was on.
So was the embarrassment. The
Sun Devils dunked nine — count 'em,
nine — times against the Cardinal, in
cluding six in the second half alone.
One-handed dunks, two-handed
dunks, dunk tip-ins, ally-oop dunks
— the works. And all Weinhauer, not
known for his tact, could say was:
"We missed two. We should have had
double figures."
Most of Arizona State's dunks
came against Stanford's press, which
Weinhauer claimed his team broke at
will. "We did the best job 1 think
we've done in three years attacking
their press," he said. "We tried to
take advantage of their gambling
press. When you're tentative against
it (the press) you often play into their
hands. So we decided to attack it."
Weinhauer, however, failed to look
at the turnover column on the statis
tics sheet while praising his press
break. Arizona State had 18 turn

overs to Stanford's 16. The Cardinal
simply couldn't capitalize on the Sun
Devils' mistakes.
The two bright spots of the road
trip were Butler and Novian Whitsitt,
who scored 12 and 16, respectively,
in each game. Against the Sun Devils,
the pair virtually carried Stanford for
the first eight minutes of the game,
combining for 12 of the Cardinal's
first 14 points.
Stanford, which can finish no better
than 9-9 in the Pac-10, is now
relegated to the role of a spoiler. But
there will be plenty of teams' fortunes
to spoil, as four of Stanford's final six
games are against the conference's
top five teams. Stanford has UCLA
(next Monday), USC (Feb. 21) and
Washington (March 9) at Maples
Pavilion, where the Cardinal defeated
all three last year.

Card notes
Stanford went its second straight
game without blocking a shot, and
remained tied with the 1976-77 team
for most blocked shots in a season at
60.
The second-half officiating was an
item of controversy Saturday, espe
cially as far as Stanford was con
cerned. In the second half, Stanford
was called for 19 fouls to Arizona
State's 10, and the Cardinal had five
team fouls before the Sun Devils' had
their first. Consequently, Arizona
State shot more than twice as many
free throws (29 to 14) as Stanford.
Andy Fischer sat on the end of the
bench next to trainer Dake Walden
for most of the first half Saturday.
Fischer ran into Thompson in the
game's early minutes and suffered a
mild concussion, Walden said.
