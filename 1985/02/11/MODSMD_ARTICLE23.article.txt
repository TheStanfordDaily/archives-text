## Stanford splits pair with Broncos 
### TOM SENF Staff sportswriter 
Stanford's modest three-game winning streak
came to an end yesterday as Santa Clara used 13
hits and four double plays to post a 9-5 win, en
abling the Broncos to gain a split of the weekend
series.
Saturday, the Cardinal eked out a 3-2 victory
in 11 innings. Friday's game was rained out.
Yesterday, Santa Clara had a 2-0 lead after
only three batters had stepped to the plate, as
first baseman Kevin Dunton lined a split
fingered fastball from Cardinal starter Jack
McDowell over the fence in left-center.
Stanford had a chance to do some early scoring
of its own in the first, but after loading the bases
with one out, John Ramos popped up and Mark
Davis grounded out.
McDowell, who had not allowed an earned run
in two previous appearances, never settled down
after Dunton's homer. After Ken Kneis's RBI
single in the fourth made it 5-0, the day was over
for the Cardinal freshman.
Although he allowed six hits, McDowell's main
problem was his lack of control. Two of the three
men he walked scored, and he threw three wild
pitches.
"McDowell didn't throw as hard as he did
Tuesday, but he threw hard enough," said Stan
ford Coach Mark Marquess. "It was his control
that wasn't good today, and they hit the ball real
well."
Kevin Kunkel took over for McDowell and
pitched four-and-one-third solid innings, allow
ing only four hits and one walk. Unfortunately,
he also pitched an inning that was anything but
solid. In the sixth, the Broncos turned an error,
three hits and two walks into four runs. Ray Wil
liamson's three-run double — a scorching line
drive down the left-field line — made the score 9-
0.
Bronco starter John Savage took a shutout into
the sixth inning — even though he had already
allowed three hits and six walks. Two of the
walks were to first baseman Rick Lundblade.
After Lundblade's final two at-bats, Savage
probably wished he had kept walking him.
Lundblade denied Savage a shutout with a
home run to left field in the sixth. Then, in the
seventh, he drove him from the game with a
three-run shot to right. Lundblade's blasts
brought the Cardinal to within four, but Pat Pil
ling came out of the bullpen and threw two-and
one-third hitless innings to record the save.
A major factor in the game was the Broncos'
ability to tame the bad bounces of the rain
damaged infield. Santa Clara turned four double
plays on it. allowing Savage to escape potential
big innings.
Santa Clara Coach John Oldham wasn't
Surprised by his infielders. "Our defense has
been pretty good this year," he said. "We think
it's one of our strengths."
Defense is supposed to be one of Stanford's
strengths, but the Cardinal made three errors
yesterday. Marquess did not use the field as an
excuse. "A majority of the balls were
fnisplayed," he said. "The fielders laid back, and
the balls ate them up."
Oldham also refused to blame the field for any
problems his team had. "We played the ball
poorly a couple of times." he said. "It wasn't the
field's fault. Stanford did a great job of getting it
ready."
Marquess chalked the double plays up to bad
luck. "We hit the ball hard, but right at people."
he said. "The difference between a double play

and a double can he six inches."
Six inches was about how close Santa Clara's
Mike Ward came to putting the Broncos ahead in
Saturday's game. In the third inning. Walt Harris
robbed Ward of a home run by scaling the
left-field fence and snaring his long-ball bid.
In the bottom of the inning, Toi Cook singled
and scored all the way from first on a double by
John Verducci — just sliding under catcher Mike
MacFarlane's tag.
The double was the end of the weekend for
Verducci. who aggravated a hamstring pull he
suffered last week against Hayward State. The
injury does not appear to be serious, and Ver
ducci should be able to play later this week.
Santa Clara tied the game in the sixth and ap
peared ready to take the lead in the seventh.
With two outs, Clinton singled and Kneis walked.
Marquess decided to replace starter Rob Was
senaar with freshman Lee Plcmel.
PlemtTs first assignment as a Cardinal was not
in eas\ one retire the dangerous Dunton with
two men on. But he was up to the task, getting
the Bronco first baseman to hit a weak grounder
hack to the mound.
Wassenaar turned in his second gutty perfor
mance of the year. "Wassenaar didn't have the
same fastball lie had against Fullerton,"
Marquess said. "He didn't have his good stuff,
but he hung in there for seven tough innings."
Ramos ,>ut the Cardinal back ahead in bottom

of the inning with his second homer of the year,
but the Broncos tied it in the eighth. Kick Dietz
replaced Plemel after MacFarlane doubled to
start the inning. With two outs, MacFarlane had
moved to third. Dietz had two strikes on pinch
hitter Joe Gosland, but his next pitch skipped by
Ramos— allowing MacFarlane to trot home with
the tying run.
"We both knew it was a slider," said Dietz. "I
just bounced it.and it got by him."
In the 11th. Dietz struck out Dunton with the
bases loaded by using experience and extra in
centive. "I played with him this summer, so I
knew how to pitch him," he said. "His being the
Colonel's (pitching coach Tom Dunton's) son
pumped me up a little more."
The Cardinal finally won it in the bottom of the
inning when — guess who — lundblade drove in
Ruben Amaro from second with a double to
right-center. Lundblade. who now has five
homers and a 1.000 slugging percentage, has
driven in a run in every game.
Dietz went four innings to get the win — a long
stint for a short reliever. "I felt fine at first," he
said. "But I couldn't get my mechanics down
towards the end."
Although he said he was ready to pitch another
inning, Dietz's day was over. "That was a long
outing for him," Marquess said. "The 11th was
his last inning."
Thanks to Lundblade,l2th wasn't necessary.
