### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
Stanford's Dan Goldie won the
men's singles championship and
Leigh Anne Eldredge and Linda
Gates won the women's doubles title
yesterday at the Rolex Indoor Indi
vidual Tournament in Houston.
Goldie, ranked No. 2 in the Inter
collegiate Tennis Coaches Associa
tion poll, defeated the No. 1-ranked
player in the country, Michael
Pernfors of Georgia, 6-3, 6-2.
Eldredge and Gates upset Ross
Riach and Cary Richmond of Miami
(Fla.), 6-4, 4-6, 6-1. Riach and Rich
mond were ranked the No. 3 doubles
team in the ITCA preseason poll.
Eldredge and Gates were ranked No.
14.
Tournament results form a basis
for the next ITCA rankings that
should be issued this week.
Other players in the tournament
from Stanford included Jim Grabb,
John Letts and Eric Rosenfeld.
Grabb lost in the semifinals to
Pernfors, 7r5, 4-6, 6-1. Letts also lost
to Pernfors in the second round, 6-1,
6-4.
Rosenfeld was eliminated in the
first round by Steve Couch of Hous
ton, 3-6, 6-3, 6-3. He went on to lose
to Chris Kennedy of Trinity (Texas),

6-4, 6-3, in second-round consolation
play.
Men's Coach Dick Gould, was
pleased with his players' perfor
mances in the tournament as a whole,
especially those of Goldie and Grabb.
"Dan has had two great weeks in a
row. He had been a little slow, and
it's good to see him getting back in
shape," Gould said. "To play
Pernfors (in the finals) was perfect.
Dan is extremely aggressive, and with
Michael not having a great serve, my
guess is that Dan just attacked him."
Goldie also played doubles with
teammate Rosenfeld. They lost in the
third set of their second-round match
against Pernfors and Alan Miller
after Goldie's back "tightened up."
"It was (Goldie's) third match that
day," Gould said. "He was told that if
he felt it at all, he should stop playing
immediately. He had the singles com
petition to think about."
Stanford's second doubles team of
Grabb and Letts was also eliminated
in the second round in a "tough" 7-6,
5-7, 7-6 loss to Richard Matuszewski
and Brandon Walters of Clemson.
In women's singles, Eldredge and
Gates both lost in the third round, to
Beverley Bowes of Texas and
Heliane Steden of USC. Bowes and
Steden were ranked No. 4 and No. 8,
respectively, in the preseason poll.
