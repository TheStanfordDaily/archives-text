# Swimmers sink USC, UCLA to stay No. 1
## 
### INGRID SEYER Staff sportswriter 
When the Stanford men's swimming team
gets its heart set on victory, there isn't much
that can stop it, as the team's two weekend
victories proved. Stanford, currently ranked
No. 1 nationally, defeated USC Friday, 75-
38, and went on to defeat UCLA Saturday
70-43.
" This was by by far the greatest dual-meet
weekend Stanford has had since I have been
coaching,'' Men's Swimming Coach Skip
Kenney said. "It is really tough to swim
against such great teams back to back, but the
guys were able to keep themselves up and
swam super both days."
In the women's competition on Saturday,
the situation was somewhat reversed as the
No. 1-ranked Cardinal fell to No. 2 Texas 88-
52 in Austin, Texas.
The men's victory over USC Friday was
surprisingly easy. Kenney predicted the fifth
ranked Trojans would challenge the Cardinal
throughout the meet, but Stanford jumped
out to an early lead, winning five of the first
seven events.
Stanford's victory was made easy with the
help of four national-best times — the fastest
in the country this season — and a surprise
victory by Dave Bottom in the 50-yard
freestyle.
The 50 freestyle proved to be a turning
point in the meet, largely because USC's
Chris Cavanaugh was expected to win the
event. Cavanaugh currently holds the nation's
No. 2 time in the event, 20.37. Bottom won
the race with a time of 20.70, followed by
Cavanaugh with a time of 20.81.
"Dave's victory was most certainly the
turning point of the USC meet," Kenney said.
"I kept Dave out of the medley relay, hoping

that Cavanaugh would swim in that event and
tire out. My hopes came true and we got the
added edge that we needed."
The Cardinal captured eight of the 11
swimming events, going one-two in the 200
butterfly with Pablo Morales (1:47.34) and
Anthony Mosse (1:47.69) and in the 200
backstroke with Sean Murphy (1:48.37) and
Dave Bottom (1:50.59).
Murphy, a freshman, set the new national
best time in the 200 backstroke. Stanford also
had national-best times in the 400 medley
relay (3:19.52), the 200 individual medley
(Morales, 1:49.19) and the 500 freestyle
(Kostoff, 4:22.74).

Kostoff s time in the 500 freestyle was esp
cially amazing considering his health at the
time of the meet.
"Jeff was feeling pretty sick for awhile, but
he really reached inside himself and pulled
through with some fabulous swims, " Kenney
said. "I couldn't have been happier with his
performances this weekend."
The medley relay team — Murphy, John
Moffet, Morales and David Lundberg — went
on to set a new national-best time on Satur
day, winning the event with a time of 3:18.17.
The swimming team wasn't the only team
scoring for Stanford on Friday. The diving
team went one-two in both the 1- and 3-

meter competitions. Thor Johnson took first
place and Tom Rothenbucher took second in
both events.
In Saturday's meet against No. 4 UCLA,
Stanford again started off on a roll, winning
the first three events. The Cardinal went on to
win all but two of the swimming events.
UCLA captured the 1- and 3-meter diving
events with two victories by junior Paul Shaf
fer. Tom Jager was the only other Bruin to
win an event as he took first place in the 50
(20.55) and 100 (45.39) freestyles. Jager cur
rently holds the national best times in both
events.
In the UCLA victory, Stanford won both

relays. Kostoff won both the 500 and 1,000
freestyle* and Murphv clocked the nation's.
No. 2 time in the 200 backstroke — Murphy
also holds the No. 1 time — as he won the
event.
Moftet won the 200-yard breaststroke, and
Dave Louden captured the 200 freestyle with
his season-best time of 1:37.17.
Louden s victory in the 200 freestyle was
the turning point for the Cardinal on Satur
day, according to Kenney.
"When Louden beat Bruce Hayes in that
eveni, .ie really turned the meet around for us
and started us rolling," Kenney said.
"The victory really meant a lot to me since
it meant so much to the team," Louden said.
"It felt especially good to defeat Bruce Hayes
in the event. The win sort of gave me a chance
to do one last thing for all the seniors on the
team in their last meet."
It was Hayes who held off West Germany's
double gold medalist Michael Gross as the
Unites States won the gold medal and set a
world record in the 800-meter freestyle relay
at the Olympics last summer.
In the women's meet, the Cardinal swim
mers were not quite as successful, winning
only three swimming events. Marybeth
Linzmeier won the 200-yard freestyle
(1:47.99), Kathy Smith won the 100
breaststroke (1:03.60), and the team of Diana
Zock, Jennifer Pokluda, Stephanie Norton
and Linzmeier won the 400-yard freestyle
relay (3:28.34).
Linzmeier's time in the 200 freestyle set the
new national-best time in that event.
In the diving competion, Stanford went
one-two-three in the 1-meter diving and tookl
second and third in the 3-meter. Cardinal
Sharon Daly won the 1-meter event with a
score of 249.40, followed by teammates
Simone LeVant and Kim Jones.


This weekend sophomore Pablo Morales set two individual
national-best marks for this season in the 200-yard butterfly and

the 200 individual medley. He also swam the butterfly leg on the
400 medley relay, which set a national-best time.
When the Stanford men's swimming team

Murphy, a freshman, set the new national

relay (3:19.52), the 200 individual medley
(Morales, 1:49.19) and the 500 freestyle

Moftet won the 200-yard breaststroke, and
Dave Louden captured the 200 freestyle with
his season-best time of 1:37.17.

that can stop it, as the team's two weekend
victories proved. Stanford, currently ranked
No. 1 nationally, defeated USC Friday, 75-
38, and went on to defeat UCLA Saturday
70-43.
" This was by by far the greatest dual-meet
weekend Stanford has had since I have been
coaching,'' Men's Swimming Coach Skip
Kenney said. "It is really tough to swim
against such great teams back to back, but the
guys were able to keep themselves up and
swam super both days."
In the women's competition on Saturday,
the situation was somewhat reversed as the
No. 1-ranked Cardinal fell to No. 2 Texas 88-
52 in Austin, Texas.
The men's victory over USC Friday was
surprisingly easy. Kenney predicted the fifth
ranked Trojans would challenge the Cardinal
throughout the meet, but Stanford jumped
out to an early lead, winning five of the first
seven events.
Stanford's victory was made easy with the
help of four national-best times — the fastest
in the country this season — and a surprise
victory by Dave Bottom in the 50-yard
freestyle.
The 50 freestyle proved to be a turning
point in the meet, largely because USC's
Chris Cavanaugh was expected to win the
event. Cavanaugh currently holds the nation's
No. 2 time in the event, 20.37. Bottom won
the race with a time of 20.70, followed by
Cavanaugh with a time of 20.81.
"Dave's victory was most certainly the
turning point of the USC meet," Kenney said.
"I kept Dave out of the medley relay, hoping

that Cavanaugh would swim in that event and
tire out. My hopes came true and we got the
added edge that we needed."
The Cardinal captured eight of the 11
swimming events, going one-two in the 200
butterfly with Pablo Morales (1:47.34) and
Anthony Mosse (1:47.69) and in the 200
backstroke with Sean Murphy (1:48.37) and
Dave Bottom (1:50.59).
Murphy, a freshman, set the new national
best time in the 200 backstroke. Stanford also
had national-best times in the 400 medley
relay (3:19.52), the 200 individual medley
(Morales, 1:49.19) and the 500 freestyle
(Kostoff, 4:22.74).

Kostoff s time in the 500 freestyle was esp
cially amazing considering his health at the
time of the meet.
"Jeff was feeling pretty sick for awhile, but
he really reached inside himself and pulled
through with some fabulous swims, " Kenney
said. "I couldn't have been happier with his
performances this weekend."
The medley relay team — Murphy, John
Moffet, Morales and David Lundberg — went
on to set a new national-best time on Satur
day, winning the event with a time of 3:18.17.
The swimming team wasn't the only team
scoring for Stanford on Friday. The diving
team went one-two in both the 1- and 3-

meter competitions. Thor Johnson took first
place and Tom Rothenbucher took second in
both events.
In Saturday's meet against No. 4 UCLA,
Stanford again started off on a roll, winning
the first three events. The Cardinal went on to
win all but two of the swimming events.
UCLA captured the 1- and 3-meter diving
events with two victories by junior Paul Shaf
fer. Tom Jager was the only other Bruin to
win an event as he took first place in the 50
(20.55) and 100 (45.39) freestyles. Jager cur
rently holds the national best times in both
events.
In the UCLA victory, Stanford won both

relays. Kostoff won both the 500 and 1,000
freestyle* and Murphv clocked the nation's.
No. 2 time in the 200 backstroke — Murphy
also holds the No. 1 time — as he won the
event.
Moftet won the 200-yard breaststroke, and
Dave Louden captured the 200 freestyle with
his season-best time of 1:37.17.
Louden s victory in the 200 freestyle was
the turning point for the Cardinal on Satur
day, according to Kenney.
"When Louden beat Bruce Hayes in that
eveni, .ie really turned the meet around for us
and started us rolling," Kenney said.
"The victory really meant a lot to me since
it meant so much to the team," Louden said.
"It felt especially good to defeat Bruce Hayes
in the event. The win sort of gave me a chance
to do one last thing for all the seniors on the
team in their last meet."
It was Hayes who held off West Germany's
double gold medalist Michael Gross as the
Unites States won the gold medal and set a
world record in the 800-meter freestyle relay
at the Olympics last summer.
In the women's meet, the Cardinal swim
mers were not quite as successful, winning
only three swimming events. Marybeth
Linzmeier won the 200-yard freestyle
(1:47.99), Kathy Smith won the 100
breaststroke (1:03.60), and the team of Diana
Zock, Jennifer Pokluda, Stephanie Norton
and Linzmeier won the 400-yard freestyle
relay (3:28.34).
Linzmeier's time in the 200 freestyle set the
new national-best time in that event.
In the diving competion, Stanford went
one-two-three in the 1-meter diving and tookl
second and third in the 3-meter. Cardinal
Sharon Daly won the 1-meter event with a
score of 249.40, followed by teammates
Simone LeVant and Kim Jones.


This weekend sophomore Pablo Morales set two individual
national-best marks for this season in the 200-yard butterfly and

the 200 individual medley. He also swam the butterfly leg on the
400 medley relay, which set a national-best time.
When the Stanford men's swimming team
gets its heart set on victory, there isn't much
that can stop it, as the team's two weekend
