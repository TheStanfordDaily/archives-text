# Fencing teams carve up Cal
## 
### ERIK ESELIUS Staff sportswriter 
Performing with a greater consis
tency than they did earlier this
season, both the Stanford men's and
women's fencing teams recorded
decisive victories over California this
weekend, improving their records to
12-2 and 15-1, respectively.
Led by senior Karen Kwong's four
victories, the Cardinal women hand
ily defeated the Bears, 23-4. Kwong,
in her first year of competitive fen
cing, turned out a steady performance
and "had the best day of her season,"
according to Stanford Coach Buzz
Hurst.
The No. 1- and No. 2-seeded fen
cers, Jennifer Yu and Holly Tailor,

each posted three victories against
the "psychologically intimidated" Cal
squad, raising their season records to
53-3 and 41-10, respectively.
The Cardinal men's epee team got
back on track after last week's subpar
outing to notch a solid 7-2 score,
headed by Larry Murk and Chris
McConnell, who combined for six
victories.
"Larry and Chris did very well,"
Hurst said. "Except for Larry's first
bout, we never had any trouble. . . .
Far too often 1 see a good touch, then
someone literally falls on his sword.
None of that this time."
The streaking men's saber contin
ued to roll along, shutting out the Cal
squad 9-0. In the last four dual meets,

the saber team has compiled a 34-2
record. Andy Goorno and Steve
Levitan each won three bouts, fol
lowed by Greg Miott's two victories.
Three victories by third-seeded
Russell Hulston paved the way for
the foil team, which finished 7-2.
Captain Eliot Chu and Chris GiÂ«l.v
both won their two matches.
The Cardinal will have a two-week
break before its next dual meet. Five
Stanford fencers will be active next
weekend, however, having been selec
ted to compete in the National 20-
and-Under Junior Olympics. Meagan
Levitan and Tailor will represent the
Cardinal women's team while the
Stanford men's team will send Mike
Kramer, Murk and Gillen.
