Both the Stanford men's and women's gymnas
tics teams broke records for total team points
during Friday night's competition in Maples
Pavilion. On Saturday night, the women followed
up their record-breaking performance with a win
over California in Berkeley.
The Stanford women had an easy victory over
Cal State-Northridge on Friday, scoring a total of
183.25 points, more than three points better than
the Cardinal record set last season. Northridge
scored a team total of 172.45.
"It was an excellent meet for us,' Stanford
Women's Gymnastics Coach Homer Sardina said.
"I think we're just starting to see our full potential
as a team. This score is currently the seventh
highest team total in the nation."
The Stanford men also put in a great team effort,
finishing with a total of 277.65 points and a second
place finish to UCLA's 279.10. California finished
third with 271.85 points.
"I think we surprised ourselves," said Sadeo
Hamada, Stanford's men's coach. "We did much
more than we expected. It should really give our
team incentive now that we know we are capable of
giving the sixth-ranked team in the nation a close
competition.
"If we continue at this pace we have a very good
chance of qualifying as a team to the NCAA cham
pionships. That would be a first in the history of
Stanford gymnastics."
In the women's all-around competition, Cardinal
senior Angie Barnes put together an outstanding
performance, earning a first-place finish and a per
sonal best with a total of 36.90 points. Finishing
second and third in the all-around for Stanford
were freshmen Beth Pope and Alison McGann
with 36.20 and 36.15, respectively.
In the men's competition, junior Randy Besosa
finished second, with a 56.45, to Olympic competi
tor Tony Pineda of UCLA Pineda scored 57.30
points.
"In order to qualify to the NCAAs, our two
highest home-meet scores and three highest away
meet scores will count," Hamada said. "We have
four away meets left and one more at home, and
every one of them will be important if we're hoping
to break into the top ten."
A similar system of averaging three away-meet
and two home-meet scores will determine whether

or not the Cardinal women will qualify for the
NCAA regionals. "We will have no problem quali
fying for the regionals," Sardina said. "We have
gone in the past, usually finishing fifth or sixth.
Right now we're ranked second in our region and
can realistically aim for the national champion
ships."
On Saturday evening the Cardinal women faced

California and once again came up with a strong
team effort, totaling 180.20 points to defeat the
Bears. "It was a difficult meet because we were
tired from the competition the night before, and
Berkeley didn't have a full team to compete
against," Sardina said. "But we did a good job of
pulling together, concentrating on hitting our
routines."
