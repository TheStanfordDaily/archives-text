## Cardinal ends trip with weekend split 
### ROB GRAHAM Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford mens volleyball
team, ranked sixth nationally, con
cluded its first tour through South
ern California this weekend by
splitting contests with league rivals
UCLA and Long Beach State.
The Cardinal's victory Saturday
over Long Beach, 15-10, 15-6,
15-9, and its 15-5, 15-9, 15-3 loss
Friday to UCLA leave Stanford
with a 3-2 mark in California In
tercollegiate Volleyball Associa
tion play. Stanford, now 11-3
overall, stands in a fourth-place tie
with UC-Santa Barbara and trails
USC (4-0), UCLA (3-0) and Pep
perdine (2-0).
Stanford can, however, derive
some satisfaction from its 2-2 road
trip. No Stanford men's volleyball
team before had ever won at
either Long Beach or San Diego
State, the site of Wednesday's
five-set Cardinal victory.
"I'm happy that although we
didn't play our best, we still won a
couple of games," said Co-coach
Don Shaw. "It's tough to win on
the road in this conference. That's
the test of a good team."
Stanford learned the hard way
why the Los Angeles schools,
UCLA and USC, have long occu
pied the top of the CIV A ranking.
The Cardinal was unable to take a
single set from either team. Shaw
summed up Friday's UCLA game:
"We got killed.

"We didn't play very well. We'd
been struggling the entire week
and on Friday we hit rock bottom.
UCLA was really ready for us and
we seemed to be real flat. The
game was over quickly. It was a
poor effort all the way around."
After Friday's debacle with the
Bruins, Shaw's squad gathered for
a soul-searching team meeting, a
meeting that Shaw said "lasted
longer than the UCLA game. We
were lingering on the negatives
and so we decided not to dwell on
our mistakes. We went out on Sat
urday (against Long Beach) and
had some fun."
The Cardinal fielded a much
looser, comfortable team against
the 49ers and was able to enjoy
the spoils of its new attitude. "We
played much better," said Shaw.
"I'm really encouraged by this
game."
Shaw said that sophomore John
McDermott turned in an excellent
performance. "McDermott's been
having some back trouble lately
but he played his best match of the
year Saturday."
With the toughest part of its
schedule completed, the Cardinal
returns to Maples Pavilion for a
lengthy home stand. Wednesday
afternoon's match with UC-Santa
Barbara, 3-2 in CIVA, will be
played for undisputed possesion of
fourth place in the league and
could very well determine the
playoff picture.
