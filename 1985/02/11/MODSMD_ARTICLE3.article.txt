# Stanford aims at collider

### TODD RAMMING Staff writer 
Stanford, in alliance with UC-
Berkeley and the California Institute
of Technology, has begun preparing a
bid to acquire a $4 billion particle ac
celerator project to be funded by the
Deptartment of Energy.
The accelerator, to be called the
Superconducting Super Collider, will
be able to reach the extremely high
energy levels present immediately
following the explosive birth of the
universe.
A number of states will be vying for
the project. Richard Taylor, associate
director of the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center, considers Califor
nia's major competitors for the col
lider to be Illinois, Texas and New
Mexico.
California Gov. George Deuk
mejian has budgeted $500,000 to the
Berkeley-based committee, which will
"explore the feasibility of siting (the
Super Collider) in California," said
Bob Harris, the governors program
budget manager.
William Wenzel, a physicist at the
Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and a
member of the committee searching
for a California site, believes the best
place for the collider would be near
Fresno or Sacramento, where the
land is flat and secure from
earthquake faults.
The collider will be able to
generate energy levels 65 times
greater than the most powerful ac
celerator currently operating in the
world.
Wenzel said attracting the Super
Collider to California "would help us
recruit top academic talent for
decades."

In addition, major accelerators in
Switzerland and Illinois have
returned an estimated $6 in regional
economic activity for every $1 in
vested in the project, according to the
San Francisco Examiner.
Larry Horton of Stanford's Office
of Government Relations said the
University will not actively lobby to
bring the project to California.
We would like to see the site selec
tion "based on scientific merits,"
Horton said. "I don't think it would
do Stanford any good to bring the
project to California if scientists did
not agree it was an excellent site," he
said.
The presence of many of the
world's best scientists in both theoret
ical and experimental high-energy
physics in California should aid the
state in its quest to win the project,
said James Albertson, UC-Berkeley's
associate vice-president for academic
affairs.
Of equal weight are "the induce
ments a state can offer in terms of ac
tual construction and operation —
land, utilities, housing (and) trans
portation," Albertson said.
But although California has much
in its favor, "there are factors that
mitigate against California," Taylor
said. "It already gets a fair share of
the federal dollar."
The multi-billion dollar project fol
lows in the wake of a July 1983 re
quest by the High-Energy Physics
Advisory Panel calling for "the im
mediate initiation of a multiple TeV
(trillion electron volt, a measure of
accelerating capacity), high
luminosity, proton-to-proton collider
with the goal of physics experiments
at the facility at the earliest possible

date," said Department of Energy
spokesman Jeff Sherwood.
It is hoped that the accelerator will
open the door to fundamental dis
coveries about matter. "The present
theories work very well in the low
energy regime," Taylor said. "By the
time you get to this (very high) en
ergy, things have to have changed.
"We hope to find new particles and
different behavior of particles we
already know about," he said.
Cornell University Prof. Maury
Tigner has been selected to head a
Central Design Group, coordinating
preparatory work for the collider
project at the Brookhaven, N.Y., Ar
gonne, 111., and Lawerence Berkeley
federal laboratories.
"We have initiated preliminary
R & D," Sherwood said. A site
criteria document is expected by this
spring, he said.
"The principal component (of the
Super Collider) is a ring of several
hundred superconducting magnets,"
Taylor said. Before finalizing site
criteria, a choice must be made be
tween three possible designs for the
magnets, he said.
The circumference of the collider
— from 40 to 100 miles — hinges
upon the magnets chosen. Each of the
three proposed magnet configura
tions "has its own advantages and dis
advantages," Taylor said.
With site criteria firmly estab
lished, a committee formed by the
National Academy of Sciences and
the National Academy of Engineer
ing will review the state proposals and
make recommendations to the De
partment of Energy.
