# Women's basketball
## Upset bid against SDSU falls short 
### PABLO MORALES 
Saturday night at Maples Pavilion, 5-foot-8
treshman guard Penny Toler of San Diego State
went up against the Stanford women's basketball
team. Toler won.
I oler scored a career-high 30 points, and her
teammates added a basket here and there to lift the
Aztecs to a 73-59 victory over the Cardinal. The
game was actually closer than the 14-point margin
indicates, but again, as in its previous two games,
Stanford was hurt by a couple offensive lapses.
In the first halt, the Cardinal did everything it
had to do to establish control of the contest — neu
tralize 6-4 center Toni Wallace, run a patient ball
control offense and hit the open outside jumpers.
The freshman duo of 5-6 guard Charli Turner
and 6-0 forward Kami Anderson pushed the Card
inal to an early 14-10 lead. Turner hit on her first
three attempts and Anderson added six more
points, swishing three of four high-arcing baseline
jumpers.
"Stanford was shooting well from the outside,
and on defense they were containing our strong

inside line, including Toni (Wallace)," said San
Diego State Head Coach Earnest Riggins.
"We had to start pressuring their offense as well
as running our quick transition offense."
Enter Toler. Not only were Toler's speedy fast
breaks almost impossible to keep up with, but her
defensive pressure on the half-court trap and full
court press produced three steals and kept San
Diego State within reach. And if all this wasn't
enough, she scored on a 35-foot shot at the buzzer
to give the Aztecs a 33-31 lead at the half.
Stanford shot a respectable 14-of-31 from the
field in the first half, including Turner's 5-of-6 for
10 points. And the Cardinal did what it had to do
under the boards, outrebounding the strong front
line of the Aztecs 21-17.
Co-captains Mary Bradach and Virginia Sourlis
pulled down five and six rebounds, respectively, to
lead both teams at the half.
In the second half, however, 6-1 sophomore for
ward Shelda Arceneaux gave the Aztecs some
much-needed help by grabbing nine rebounds. Ar
ceneaux's boards gave the Aztecs the second shots

that they were not able to get during the first half.
Stanford's shooting fell off in the second half
(12-of-32), but the Cardinal was still only down
55-49 with 6:48 to play due to Bradach's tenacious
rebounding and her three straight hoops from the
outside.
Enter Toler again. Two fast breaks and a fade
away jumper later, San Diego State led comfor
tably, 61-51. The Cardinal was not able to get
much closer as both teams traded baskets during
the final five-minute stretch.
Bradach led Stanford with 16 points and 12
rebounds. Turner scored a career-high 12 points
and Anderson also added a dozen. Virginia Sourlis'
11 points gave her 1,002 for her career.
Aside from Toler's 30, no other Aztec scored in
double figures. Arceneaux's 14 rebounds led both
teams.
Stanford has now lost three consecutive confer
ence games, dropping its league record to 2-4. 9-1 1
overall.
San Diego State remains in fourth place in the
Western Collegiate Athletic Association at 5-3.
The 16th-ranked Aztecs are 16-6 overall.
