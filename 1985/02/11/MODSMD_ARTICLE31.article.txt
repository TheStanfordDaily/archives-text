### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
Despite the absence of several top players
Friday, the Stanford women's tennis team
defeated San Jose State 8-1.
Stanford's one loss came in the No. 2
doubles match, where Susan Ross and An
nette Shelby lost to the Spartans' Kristin Hil
debrandt and Dionna House, 6-4, 4-6, 6-4.
The win tied the Stanford team record for
29 consecutive dual match victories. The
string of wins included the Cardinal's 26-0
record last year.

The previous record streak began in 1981
and ended in the ninth match of the 1983
season — a 5-4 loss to USC in the Nike In
door Championship finals.
Coach Frank Brennan has reason to be
pleased with the performance of his team over
the past few years, but he played down the
tying of the record in light of the way his No. 1
doubles team played against San Jose.
In that match, Stephanie Savides and Kay
Tittle defeated San Jose State's Rochelle
Morrison and Shellev Stockman, 6-2, 6-2.

Usually, Linda Gates and Leigh Anne
Eldrege, or Patty Fendick and Anna Ivan,
play in the No. 1 spot, but bigger tournaments
drew those players away.
"Kay and Stephanie are really coming to
gether as a team," Brennan said. "They are
learning more about playing with each other
— enjoying each other out on the court."
Savides also won her No. 1 singles match
against Morrison, "a nice solid player," ac
cording to Brennan. Fendick defeated Stock
man in No. 2 singles, 7-5, 6-1. She finished
competition in a professional tournament in

Florida in time to play at home.
Brennan had been concerned with Stan
ford's lack of better players, but San Jose also
had difficulty with its lineup. Only five players
showed up to play for the Spartans, who are
rebuilding their program, according to Bren
nan. As a result, the No. 6 singles and No. 3
doubles matches were forfeited to Stanford.
Today, Stanford will take on UC-Davis at
1:30 p.m. Davis has not lost a Northern Cali
fornia Athletic Conference match in seven
years and hopes to win its eighth straight con
ference championship this year.

Davis finished fourth in the NCAA's Divi
sion 11 last year and is ranked No. 3 this
season.
Helen Nazar will be playing No. 1 singles
and doubles for Davis. She was NorCal player
of the year in 1984. Her doubles partner will
probably be Sally Garbeff, formerly Davis!
No. 1 player.
Brennan said the match will be another
"warm-up" for the Cardinal. He plans to ex
periment with different players, including
Cindy Spiekerman, Shelby, and Ross.
