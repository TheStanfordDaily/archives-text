# Card heads for key Arizona tourney
## 
### KEN STEVENS 
Currently at the cutoff point to
make the NCAA championships,
the Stanford women's golf team
travels to Tucson, Ariz., today for
the opening round of the three
day Arizona Intercollegiate.
As they head into the winter
and spring portion of their
schedule, the Cardinal women
stand at No. 14 in the national
computer rankings. In May, the
nation's top 14 teams will advance
to the NCAA championships at
Cape Cod, Mass.
"We're ready to charge," said
Kathleen McCarthy, an All-
American as a freshman last year
and winner of the Stanford
Women's Intercollegiate earlier
this season with a tournament
record 211.
"We have a lot of potential, a
lot of talent," McCarthy said. "We
just have to put it together."
The Cardinal women have been
hurt by inconsistency this season.
They opened with two fourth
place finishes before winning the
Stanford Intercollegiate on their
home course. Since then, Stanford
has recorded a fifth-place finish in
the U.S. International University
Intercollegiate and a fourth-place
finish in the Desert Classic at Palm
Springs.
McCarthy said the inconsistency

has been partly due to the lack of
"college experience" on the team.
"We're just young right now," she
said. "We don't have any seniors."
The five starting golfers for
Stanford are junior Julie Carmic
hael, sophomore McCarthy and
three freshmen: Kay Cornelius,
runner-up at the U.S. High School
Championships last year, Trish
McGonigle, a top prospect from
the West, and Anna Oxenstierna,
the No. 1 junior player in Europe.
McCarthy sees great things in
the future for the Stanford
women's golf program. "As soon
as they (the freshmen) get some
college experience, this team
could be great," she said.
Individually, McCarthy is
aiming for All-American honors
for the second consecutive season.
She played impressively early in
the year, especially in her victory
in the Stanford Intercollegiate in
November.
A below-average performance
at the Desert Classic in January,
however, increased her stroke
average to 75.6. She finished last
season with a 73.8 stroke average,
third lowest in the nation.
"I have to have some good tour
naments because I really want to
make All-American like last
year," said McCarthy.
