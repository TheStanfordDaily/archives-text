## Polish boy leaves Stanford Hospital 
### 
A Polish boy whose live-saving
heart surgery was made possible by
$25,000 in donations from about
1,000 people across the country was
released yesterday Stanford Medical
Center.
Piotr Sternik, in critical condition
and breathing with the aid of a
respirator before surgery to repair a
defective heart valve Jan. 25, was in
good condition when he left, said
Laura Hofstadter, a hospital spokes
woman.
The 6-year-old boy walked out of
the hospital on his own and got into a
car for the trip to Carmel, 70 miles to
the south, where he and his mother,
Halina Sternik, will stay while the boy
is recuperating, according to Peter
Wasowski, their host.
The boy, from Gdansk, Poland,
had a congenital heart defect that
caused much of his blood to bypass
his lungs, where blood is
reoxygenated.
One of every 4,000 infants
worldwide is born with problem, the
hospital said in a statement. It said 90
percent who do not get the treatment
Piotr received die within a year of
birth.
Piotr's father, Michal Sternik, a
former Solidarity activist, remained

behind during tne mission to save the
boy's life. Wasowski said Sternik
wept for joy when he heard on the
telephone that the operation was a
success.
Wasowski estimated it might be the
end of March before the boy is
allowed to return to his home.
Wasowski is a self-employed medical
consultant who has specialized in X
ray equipment for visualizing arteries
in the heart and brain.
Before he leaves, Wasowski said, a
news conference will be held to let
know the many people who donated
money to save Piotr's life the happy
result of their gifts.
"We owe it to those people to let
them know how this came out,"
Wasowski said with emotion. He said
he realized an effort was made to
keep reporters and photographers
away from the hospital when Piotr
left.
"Today was just not a good day be
cause of his condition," Wasowski
said, adding that the young patient
"gets very excited" from all the news
attention.
"If it was not for reporters he
would not have gotten his surgery,"
Wasowski observed.
