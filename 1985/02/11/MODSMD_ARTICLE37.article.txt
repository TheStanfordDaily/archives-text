# Symposium explores racism, alienation of blacks
## 
### REBECCA RUBIN 
A group of authorities on black education
discussed an array of topics including racism
and psychological alienation of blacks during a
Friday evening symposium which commenced
Black Liberation Month activities.
The presentation, titled "The Crisis in Edu
cation," was opened by moderator Asa Hil
liard, professor of Urban Education at Geor
gia State University.
Hilliard referred to racism as "legitimation
achieved at the expense of someone else," and
as "an illness" characterized by "neurotic
symptoms, delusions of grandeur and the pro
jection of white supremacy."
But racism leads to other problems, as the
speakers noted. "Racism in the system in
sidiously works on the mind of children. . . .
We must turn the system upside down," said
Mary Rhodes Hoover, chair of Black Studies
at Long Beach State, speaking of the threat
racism poses to black education.
Wade Nobles introduced the issue of the
alienation of the black mind. Nobles, execu
tive director of the Institute for the Advanced

Study of Black Family Life in Oakland, said,
"The whole problem for us African people is
that we have had a mind transplant. .. . Black
education is very much like the Frankenstein
to white scholarship. Obedience to someone
else's will — and this is why I use the analogy
of Frankenstein — is symptomatic of this mind
transplant."
Nobles said the barrier to "finding a pur
pose" in education was "the alienated black
mind." He explained, "It's a matter for us to
understand and to reclaim the kinds of issues
and belief systems that triggered and inspired
our educational processes."
"The symptoms characteristic of the
alienated black mind come from our not really
understanding the relationship between the
roots of learning and what we in fact use as the
practice of learning," he said.
Nobles underscored the importance of myth
in relationship to the ultimate freedom of the
black mind, black education and the black cul
ture. "Myth reflects the abstract codification
of our culture," he said. "If you take someone
else's culture, you simultaneously adopt a sys

tem of thinking designed to give praise to that
other culture. Liberation results when we
develop a paradigm that reflects our vested in
terest — when we become freemasons, not
Frankensteins."
Later, the speakers addressed the topics of
black youth and black education. Warren
Hayman, former vice president of Morgan
State University in Baltimore, closed the sym
posium by saying, "Despite all the adversity
... we will have black colleges and univer
sities, because we know that as the tree is
known by the fruit it bears, the intelligence of
the people is known by the children it
produces. It's not only the roots, it's also the
fruit."
Hoover, however, identified the threats
posed to black education, citing cutbacks,
mergers, class cancellations, dropouts, testing
bias and disregard for research that would
help black students.
She noted, for example, that "The writing
proficiency exam at (Long Beach State) . . .
limits students from graduating. Yet three of

the five sections of the test have no relation to
writing."
Hoover said solutions to the problems of
black education should be approached in
terms of the need to "turn upside down the
basic assumptions of society" and "challenge
public schools," perhaps through the use of
malpractice suits.
Hayman addressed the crisis from the
standpoint of black colleges and universities.
Hayman's speech included a historical per
spective of black education, an analysis of how
the crisis in education affects black colleges
and universities and the response by colleges
and universities to the crisis.
Stressing the responsibility of black colleges
and universities in meeting this crisis, Hayman
said, "Central to our survival is unity and
building on our traditions. We need more
responsive, more positive and more talented
black students, black faculty and black com
munity organizations to support our black col
leges and universities.
