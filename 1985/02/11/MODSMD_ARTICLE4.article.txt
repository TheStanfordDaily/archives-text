# Board faces big issues
## Trustees to debate library site, stock, tuition 
### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
The Board of Trustees will address
two of the most controversial issues
of the year today and tomorrow when
members consider the site for the
Ronald Reagan Presidential Library
and debate whether Stanford should
sell 94,000 shares of stock in
Motorola, Inc.
The trustees will also vote on a rec
ommended 7.9 percent increase in
undergraduate tuition for the 1985-
86 academic year, as well as increases
in the tuition charged students in the
medical, law and business schools.
The proposed increase would put un
dergraduate tuition over the $10,000
mark.
Last week, a special trustee com
mittee suggested the Reagan library
be located off Junipero Serra
Boulevard near the Stanford Golf
Course and the Center for Advanced
Study in the Behavioral Sciences.
That decision echoed the November
recommendation of the Ronald
Reagan Library Planning Committee,
a University group chaiied by Robert
Freelen, vice president for public af
fairs.
The Junipero Serra site is the
closest to campus of the more than 20
sites originally .considered by the
Freelen committee. Reagan favors
this site over all the others, according
to Martin Anderson, senior research
fellow at the Hoover Institution and
White House liaison for library af
fairs.
Last month Presidential Counselor
Edwin Meese 111 sent a letter to
Board President William Kimball ex
plaining Reagan's preferences for the
library.
"[ The President] is especially con
cerned that if the library is to be lo
cated on a university campus it be
readily accessible to undergraduate
and graduate students," the Jan. 18
letter said.
The special trustee committee
found that if the library is located at
the Deer Creek Road or Alpine Road

sites, the opportunity for integration
into student research programs would
be diminished.
Also, according to Meese," Reagan
strongly prefers the kind of architec
ture that predominates on the Stan
ford campus, including red tile
roofs."
Freelen said the board's discussion
might hinge on access to the Junipero
Serra site. The planning committee
recommends that traffic use existing
roads, not build a new route directly
from Junipero Serra to the library.
The board is expected to choose
the Junipero Serra site at tomorrow's
meeting, although Freelen believes it

is "not going to sail through." If a
decision is made, "A formal letter
will go from (University President
Donald) Kennedy to the President
with a copy for Meese," Freelen said.
Then it will be up to Reagan to ap
prove the recommended site.
If the trustees and Reagan agree to
a site soon, groundbreaking will
probably begin in early 1987, with
the library open by the time Reagan
completes his second term, Freelen
said.
The board's special subcommittee

on investment responsibility will dis
cuss a University committee recom
mendation to divest of all Stanford
stock holdings in Motorola if the
company resumes sales to the South
African military or police.
The Committee on Investment Re
sponsibility (C-IR) agreed unani
mously on Jan. 15 to suggest condi
tional divestment to the board. That
decision followed a student resolution
in which students asked the board to
divest of Motorola, 2,045 to 485.
A Motorola spokesman told the C
IR that the Illinois-based electronics
firm had not sold any equipment to
the South African military or police

in 1984. Nevertheless, the company
has earned consistently low ratings on
tests designed to measure to what ex
tent U.S. corporations support apar
theid.
The board will also vote on tuition
increases for the 1985-86 academic
year. Business school students would
be hardest hit by the proposed in
creases, seeing their tuition leap 10.4
percent.
According to recommendations,

undergraduate tuition would jump
$771, to $10,476 per year. Medical
School tuition would remain the
highest, at a proposed $12,330 per
year.
Basic undergraduate room and
board would cost $4,417, more than
40 percent of the total tuition.
In 1984-85 Stanford ranked
seventh in tuition among comparable
schools nationwide.
According to Stanford's 1984 An
nual Financial Report, tuition ac
counts for $109 million per year, ap
proximately 20 percent of the Uni
versity's total operating expenditures.

be located off Junipero Serra
Boulevard near the Stanford Golf
Course and the Center for Advanced
Study in the Behavioral Sciences.
That decision echoed the November
recommendation of the Ronald
Reagan Library Planning Committee,
a University group chaiied by Robert
Freelen, vice president for public af
fairs.
The Junipero Serra site is the
closest to campus of the more than 20
sites originally .considered by the
Freelen committee. Reagan favors
this site over all the others, according
to Martin Anderson, senior research
fellow at the Hoover Institution and
White House liaison for library af
fairs.
Last month Presidential Counselor
Edwin Meese 111 sent a letter to
Board President William Kimball ex
plaining Reagan's preferences for the
library.
"[ The President] is especially con
cerned that if the library is to be lo
cated on a university campus it be
readily accessible to undergraduate
and graduate students," the Jan. 18
letter said.
The special trustee committee
found that if the library is located at
the Deer Creek Road or Alpine Road

sites, the opportunity for integration
into student research programs would
be diminished.
Also, according to Meese," Reagan
strongly prefers the kind of architec
ture that predominates on the Stan
ford campus, including red tile
roofs."
Freelen said the board's discussion
might hinge on access to the Junipero
Serra site. The planning committee
recommends that traffic use existing
roads, not build a new route directly
from Junipero Serra to the library.
The board is expected to choose
the Junipero Serra site at tomorrow's
meeting, although Freelen believes it

is "not going to sail through." If a
decision is made, "A formal letter
will go from (University President
Donald) Kennedy to the President
with a copy for Meese," Freelen said.
Then it will be up to Reagan to ap
prove the recommended site.
If the trustees and Reagan agree to
a site soon, groundbreaking will
probably begin in early 1987, with
the library open by the time Reagan
completes his second term, Freelen
said.
The board's special subcommittee

on investment responsibility will dis
cuss a University committee recom
mendation to divest of all Stanford
stock holdings in Motorola if the
company resumes sales to the South
African military or police.
The Committee on Investment Re
sponsibility (C-IR) agreed unani
mously on Jan. 15 to suggest condi
tional divestment to the board. That
decision followed a student resolution
in which students asked the board to
divest of Motorola, 2,045 to 485.
A Motorola spokesman told the C
IR that the Illinois-based electronics
firm had not sold any equipment to
the South African military or police

in 1984. Nevertheless, the company
has earned consistently low ratings on
tests designed to measure to what ex
tent U.S. corporations support apar
theid.
The board will also vote on tuition
increases for the 1985-86 academic
year. Business school students would
be hardest hit by the proposed in
creases, seeing their tuition leap 10.4
percent.
According to recommendations,

undergraduate tuition would jump
$771, to $10,476 per year. Medical
School tuition would remain the
highest, at a proposed $12,330 per
year.
Basic undergraduate room and
board would cost $4,417, more than
40 percent of the total tuition.
In 1984-85 Stanford ranked
seventh in tuition among comparable
schools nationwide.
According to Stanford's 1984 An
nual Financial Report, tuition ac
counts for $109 million per year, ap
proximately 20 percent of the Uni
versity's total operating expenditures.
