# Lyons to question SAEs
## 
### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER Senior staff writer 
In response to a plea from the Gay and Lesbian Al
liance at Stanford (GLAS), 15 pledges of the Sigma Al
pha Eplison (SAE) fraternity will be questioned by Dean
of Student Affairs James Lyons in conjunction with an in
cident that occurred on Jan. 15 in White Plaza.
Four SAE pledges "powdered themselves white and
assumed the exact pose of the (George) Segal sculpture,
while two other pledges gestured at them with hammers,"
according to a document written by David Cuff, a spokes
man for GLAS.
The Segal sculpture, "Gay Liberation," depicts two
men, one with his arm on the other's shoulder, and two
women sitting holding hands.
The GLAS statement said the incident also disrupted a
rally in honor of Martin Luther King, Jr., causing
"outrage" in the black community.
Although the students involved in the incident will be
questioned, there is no suggestion of any action against
the fraternity as a whole. "I'm not sure if any punishment
is called for," Lyons said . "I'd call it a fairly massive dose
of insensitivity.

"I want to know what happened and why it happened,"
he said. "I don't know what the heck was in their
minds. ... It was a pretty stupid thing to do."
The dean said the only punishment he envisions cur
rently is to "look for some way to help them understand
how to be a little more sensitive."
Cuff agreed with Lyons in regards to punishment. "I
don't want any punitive action," he told The Daily. He
said he would like to see "some kind of education pro
gram or workshop."
Cuff said he thought the mocking of the â€¢sculpture was
"an insensitive act on their (the SAEs') part. It came off
as being malicious. .. . We're not sure if this is some un
derlying homophobia."
In response, SAE President John Peterson said the
mocking of the statue was "just an activity we had thought
up for the pledges. .. .We had no malicious intent."
"It was purely for humor's sake," the senior added.
Peterson said he believes the issue was "blown way out
of proportion." The pledges were in White Plaza for only
five minutes and left when they were
asked to do so by some of the people
at the rally, he said.
"We were wrong. We didn't realize
the massive amount of controversy
this little incident could cause," he
said.
Peterson continued, "We may have
screwed up, but there's nothing we
can do about it now. ... It doesn't
reflect a massive homophobic atti
tude among the members of the
house. We've given it due thought."
