# LOTS II start-up delayed by software

### TRACEY BANKS 
The new LOTS II computer center, which was
originally scheduled to open on Jan. 15, should be
opening within the next two weeks, according to
Ralph Gorin, director of LOTS.
The delay is a result of the extensive amount of
software LOTS II will maintain, according to
Gorin. All the hardware for the new center has
arrived, he said.
"The problem we have is that we have to organ
ize all of the software," he said. "In essence, we will
have a software library."
One of the main purposes of LOTS II will be "to
allow people to use personal computers as work
stations without logging into LOTS," said Mark
Laube, coordinator of the opening of LOTS 11. Be
cause this is "an experiment," "people will prob
ably resist the change at first," Laube said.
However, Laube said he feels that users will
eventually realize that lines at LOTS II will prob
ably be shorter and begin to use the facility more.
Because of the fact that most of LOTS II will be
devoted to personal computers, there will be no ac
count system there. "Personal computers don't
have accounts associated with them because a per

sonal computer is only shared in sequence. When
you use it, it's all yours and there is no need to
identify yourself," Gorin said.
LOTS II users will be able to check out software
with programs that range from word processing to
financial analysis. Although users will be able to
check out software, they will also be expected to
purchase diskettes in order to preserve the work
done on the personal computers. "The analogy is
that you must bring a pad of paper to the library,"
Gorin said.
LOTS II will be divided into four user-defined
sections. One section will be open to normal LOTS
users, Gorin said.
Another section, which will include DEC Rain
bow computers, will be open to Stanford faculty,
academic staff and students for any academic
purposes. These terminals will be "especially good
for word processing and spread sheets (a form of
financial analysis)," Gorin said.
The third section contains a collection of IBM
equipment that will be used by students in selected
classes involved in the Waterloo Project. This proj
ect's equipment "is present for the purpose of ex
perimenting with introductory computer-language

teaching." Gorin said.
The final section will include DEC Professional
350 computers to be used in a project called SUN
DEC which involves "researching distributed com
puting as applied to academic needs," Gorin said.
Distributed computing entails the use of two or
more computers that perform different functions in
order to gain the benefits of both.
The DEC Professional and Rainbow computers
were equipment grants — at no cost to Stanford —
from the Digital Equipment Corporation. The IBM
equipment was a grant for use in the Waterloo
Project, Gorin said.
However, LOTS II is not expected to be a per
manent facility. "We have plans to be there only
until the new building, called the Academic
Resource Center, is erected," Gorin said. This
building will contain "all of LOTS, except the
mainframe computers," he said.
Gorin said that the Board of Trustees has ap
proved the concept and if it gives final approval,
"the building will be ready for occupation for the
fall of '86, maybe."

The new LOTS II facility in Tresidder Union will open in the next two
weeks, according to LOTS Director Ralph Gorin. The facility was
slated to open over three weeks ago but was held up by delays in or
ganizing software.
