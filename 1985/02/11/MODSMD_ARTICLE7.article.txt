Reagan asked to cancel Chun visit
SEOUL, South Korea — A delegation of American supporters of op
position leader Kim Dae Jung urged yesterday that the Reagan adminis
tration consider postponing President Chun Doo Hwan's scheduled state
visit to the United States in April because of manhandling tactics by
, police at the airport when Kim came home from exile Friday.
The delegation asserted that police manhandling of some of its mem
bers and of Kim was a premeditated act that violated assurances
received in advance by both the delegation and the U.S. government.
A statement, signed on behalf of the 22 Americans by Reps. Edward
Feighan (D-Ohio) and Thomas Foglietta (D-Pa.) and Robert White, a
former U.S. ambassador to El Salvador, called the episode a "calculated
affront to the American government and people" and recommended
that the administration "give serious consideration" to putting off
Chun's visit.
The statement also criticized Richard Walker, the U.S. ambassador to
South Korea, for allegedly playing down the incident.
Walker, for his part, lashed out at the Americans, denying that the
. State Department had told them that three members of the delegation
would be permitted to stay alongside Kim and his wife, Lee
Hee Ho, as the couple went through customs at Kimpo Airport and
drove to their home in Seoul.
"They (the Americans in the delegation) had the belief that they
would stay with Kim right through to his home. That is simply not true,"
David Fitzgerald, embassy spokesman, quoted Walker as saying.
Feighan, however, asserted that both Harriet Isom, Korea desk chief
at the State Department, and David Straub, a Korea desk officer, had
assured him the day before the U.S. delegation left Washington with
Kim that three members of the group would be allowed to go through
customs and on to Kim's home with Kim and his wife.
"There was no mention about any agreement about separating the
three members of the delegation from Kim" to go through customs,
White added. It was when Kim, the two congressmen and White
resisted attempts by plainclothesmen to separate them that most of the
manhandling occurred at the airport.
Three of the Americans, including White and Foglietta, said that they
were thrown to the floor as Kim and his wife were pushed into an
elevator and taken away from the U.S. delegation that had travelled with
t them in a move to ensure Kim's safe arrival.
Kim, 61, a major critic of Chun's authoritarian government, was con
victed of sedition in 1980 after Chun seized power and had him arrested.
He still faces the balance of a suspended 20-year jail term, although the
, Chun government last Monday promised not to jail him "on his arrival"
t 'ending a two-year exile in the United States.
Chun released Kim from prison in December 1982, ostensibly to al
low him to get medical treatment in the United States.

Weinberger defends weapons plan
I MUNICH, West Germany — Secretary of Defense Caspar
Weinberger defended research into space-based defense systems here
Jesterday as a means to develop a better East-West strategic balance.
In an address to a military studies congress, Weinberger said such a
system would make nuclear weapons entirely superfluous on the ground.
President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, popularly referred to as
firs "Star Wars" plan, would spare humanity the fear of nuclear war.
,* The international meeting, attended by 150 Western politicians,
academics and journalists, has focused on the "Star Wars" proposal as
Che critical defense question of coming years.
_ Weinberger said Reagan had proposed nothing more than the possi
bility of researching how to defend "ourselves and our allies" from
missiles from space. Considering the enormous Soviet advances in space
weapons, this was a wise course to take, Weinberger said.
- Weinberger's speech was read by Assistant Secretary of Defense
Richard Perle because Weinberger was late for the meeting when his
plane was unable to land at Munich airport because of bad weather.
" The defense secretary said the strategic defense on which the U.S. was
forking would be also effective against Soviet SS-20 nuclear missiles
£nd similar intermediate-range weapons, reducing the risk of a first
Sjrike and creating stability.
; He believed the prospect of a viable and cost-effective defense would
arfso give a stimulus to U.S.-Soviet negotiations to end the accumulation
destabilizing offensive weapons.
" Debate_at the meeting centered around French opposition to "Star
wars,*' on the grounds that it would provoke a new arms race and on
what the French viewed as West German and U.S. fascination with the
new technological leap forward.
.. French Defense Minister Charles Hernu warned here Saturday that
President Reagan's "Star Wars'" missile defense could lead to
"complicity" between the United States and Soviet Union that would
leave Western Europe to cope with the threat of nuclear weapons on its
own.
Iran, Iraq seek Gulf War options
MANAMA. Bahrain — Iraq and Iran, their military options
paralyzed by recent changes on the 52-month-old gulf war, are searching
for new ways to break a politically volatile battlefield stalemate, and the
first victims may be their own civilians.
Both countries said that their heavy artillery and rocket launchers
were zeroed in on major civilian targets inside each other's territories, as
a 48-hour ultimatum issued by Iran to Iraq to stop alleged shelling of
border cities ticked away to its expiration sometime last night.
The Iranian ultimatum came after Iraq changed its static defense tac
tics early this month, launching two lightning attacks that upset the
ditch-war pattern of the past three years.
Military analysts say the Iraqi attacks, while demonstrating Iran's in
ability to launch a long-threatened final offensive, did not really change
the strategic balance on the battlefield.
They said it was intended instead to compensate for Iraq's own in
ability to stop a floating "oil shuttle service" just set up by Iran far from
the range of Iraq's partial, and only marginally successful, air force siege
of the main Iranian oil export terminal at Kharg Island.
Iranian President Ali Khamenei has been touring Iranian cities on-the
occasion of the sixth anniversary of the Islamic revolution, telling war
\ycary Iranians that the final offensive will materialize after all, that the
Islamic revolution was spreading throughout the region "despite the
modern arms pouring into Iraq from the forces of imperialism."
The Iranians staged their last massive offensive in February last year
but suffered extensive casualties without attaining their objective — iso
lating the southern city of Basra, which stretches to the borders of
Kuwait.
