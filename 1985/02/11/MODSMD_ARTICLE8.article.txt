# Mandela snubs freedom offer
## 
### 
SOWETO, South Africa â€” Nelson Mandela, the
imprisoned leader of the African National
Congress, yesterday firmly rejected the South
African government's offer of conditional freedom
and instead set forth his own terms for negotiations
between his outlawed organization and the
minority white regime.
"I cannot sell my birthright, nor am I prepared to
sell the birthright of the people to be free," Man
dela, 66, declared in a message from his prison cell
in Cape Town, where he is serving a life sentence
imposed in 1964 after his conviction on charges of
treason.
"I cannot and will not give any undertaking at a
time when I and you, the people, are not free. Your
freedom and mine cannot be separated."
Mandela's statement was dictated in prison to his
wife Winnie and was read to a crowd of 8,000 at a
political rally in a Soweto amphitheater by his
daughter Zinzi, 22, who risked imprisonment un
der South Africa's stringent security laws for
quoting her father in public.
President Pieter Botha, in a gesture meant to
demonstrate his government's commitment to
reform, including a political voice for South
Africa's black majority, had offered to free Man
dela and other black nationalist leaders if they
renounced violence as a means of struggle against
the apartheid system of racial segregation here and
undertook to obey the country's strict internal se
curity laws.
"I'm surprised (at) the conditions that the gov
ernment wants to impose on me," Mandela said in
the statement. "I am not a violent man. ... It was
only when all other forms of resistance were no
longer open to us that we turned to armed
struggle."

Mandela demanded an unconditional release
before he would negotiate with the Botha govern
ment. "Only free men can negotiate. Prisoners can
not enter into contracts," he said.
If Botha truly wants a political solution to South
Africa's continued turmoil, Mandela said, the gov
ernment should legalize the African National
Congress, release its imprisoned opponents, allow
exiles to return, permit free political activity and
commit itself to end apartheid.
"Let Botha show that he is different," Mandela
said, recalling past white leaders who refused to
negotiate with the African National Congress and
instead strengthened the apartheid system. "Let
him renounce violence."
Although Mandela's rejection of the govern
ment's offer had been expected, he appeared to be
leaving an opening for Botha to seek reconciliation
on what South African blacks regard as the mini
mum term of fairness.
"I cherish my own freedom dearly," said Man
dela, who has been jailed since 1962. "But I care
even more for your freedom. Too many have died
since I went to prison. Too many have suffered for
the love of freedom. I owe it to their widows, to
their orphans, to their mothers and fathers who
have grieved and wept for them. Not only I have
suffered during these long, lonely, wasted years."
What was even the point of accepting the gov
ernment offer, Mandela asked, when apartheid still
effectively reduced freedom to almost nothing?
"What freedom am I being offered while the or
ganization of the people (the African National
Congress) remains banned?" he asked. "What
freedom am I being offered when I may be arrested
on a pass offense (for not having permission to be
in a white area)? What freedom am I being offered
to live my life with my family while my dear wife

remains in banishment? What freedom am I being
offered when I must ask permission to live in an ur
ban area? What freedom am 1 being offered when I
need a stamp in my pass book to seek work? What
freedom am 1 being offered when my very South
African citizenship is not respected?"
Mandela's message was the first to his supporters
since his treason trial 21 years ago, and it greatly
moved the predominantly black crowd of 8,000
here for whom Mandela is a symbol of resistance to
apartheid.
The rally in this black Johannesburg suburb was
originally organized by the United Democratic
Front, an alliance of about 700 anti-apartheid or
ganizations, to celebrate the Nobel Peace Prize
awarded Bishop Desmond Tutu and his election as
the Anglican bishop of Johannesburg. It was the
first time permission was given for an outdoor rally
by the organization.
Longtime observers noted that it was the first
time they could recall an anti-apartheid rally's
being held without any visible police presence. Yet
there was a reminder of the mounting racial tension
in the fact that the rally took place a day after a gun
battle between police and a group of ANC insur
gents in another black ghetto of Johannesburg
called Alexandra. One insurgent was killed in the
battle.
On Friday a bomb believed to have been planted
by congress insurgents wrecked part of a military
building in nearby downtown Johannesburg, indi
cating a possible revival of insurgent activity after a
lull of four months.
"If you want to discuss dismantling apartheid,"
Tutu said, addressing the government, "our leaders
are ready to talk to you, and our leaders are not the
blood-thirsty men you think, but peace-loving
men."
