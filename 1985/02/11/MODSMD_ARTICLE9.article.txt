# Israelis die in security zone
## 
### 
JERUSALEM — Three Israeli sol
diers were killed and the army an
nounced that a fourth had died from
wounds received previously as Israel
suffered yesterday one of the costliest
days in the last two years of its mili
tary occupation of southern Lebanon.
The casualties came in two sepa
rate guerrilla attacks, the most signifi
cant of which occurred just north of
the international border, well inside
what Israel has said would continue
to be a critical security zone even
after most of its troops withdraw from
Lebanon.
Later in the day, Israeli warplanes
raided a Palestinian guerrilla base in
the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley
of Lebanon. The army said pilots re
ported accurate hits on a one-story
building near Chtoura which had
been used by the Democratic Front
for the Liberation of Palestine to
launch attacks on Israeli troops in the
south. Beirut Radio reported that one
person was killed and two wounded

in the strike.
A senior military source in Tel
Aviv said that the air raid was part of
a long-standing policy to strike what
he called terrorist targets in Lebanon.
There was no direct connection be
tween the bombing raid and the ear
lier guerrilla attacks on Israeli sol
diers, he said.
The incidents occurred as the Is
raeli army neared completion of the
first stage of its planned withdrawal
from Lebanon. It is to evacuate the
Sidon area by next Monday, accord
ing to an Israeli Cabinet decision
made in mid-January. The timing
and exact details of two subsequent
stages are still undetermined, but by
the end, most Israeli troops are to be
redeployed on their own side of the
international border.
However, senior defense officials
stressed that, even after the planned
withdrawal, Israel intended to exer
cise military hegemony over southern
Lebanon. An Israeli-backed local
militia, supplemented by Israeli ad

visors and possibly some combat
units, will remain indefinitely in a
narrow "buffer zone" north of the
border. And Israel plans regular
reconnaissance throughout the south
ern Lebanon zone by air, sea and
ground forces, these officials said.
Yesterday's guerrilla attacks,
meanwhile, were part of a sharp in
crease during the last two weeks in
Lebanese national resistance to the
Israeli occupation. And they un
derlined the vulnerability of Israeli
troops to concerted guerrilla actions.
The most worrisome of the attacks
from Israel's point of view occurred
just north of Metulla, the nor
thernmost settlement in Israel.
Details of the incident were not im
mediately available pending notifica
tion of the next of kin of the dead sol
diers. However, military sources said
that two Israelis were killed by a
roadside bomb.
"It's a problem, because it means
(anti-Israeli guerrillas) are getting
very close to the border," said a

senior defense official said.
It was unclear who was responsible
for the bomb attack, but it occurred
in an area containing large numbers
of Israeli troops and members of the
Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army
militia. It thus underscored Israeli
fears that determined terrorists and
guerrilla fighters could, follow the
withdrawing Israeli army all the way
back to the border, and possibly
beyond.
In a second incident yesterday, a
20-year-old Israeli soldier was killed
and three other soldiers were
wounded by light machine gun fire in
an ambush near Aaddoussiye, be
tween Tyre and Sidon on the
Lebanese coastal highway.
Also yesterday, the army spokes
man announced that Sgt. Baruch
Ezra, 21, who was wounded in south
Lebanon one week ago, died of his
wounds Saturday night. Sunday's
toll brought the total number of Is
raelis killed in Lebanon since the
June 6, 1982, invasion to 615.
