'Star Wars' cost probed
WASHINGTON — The cost of the adminis
tration's "Star Wars" program could exceed $70
billion by 1993, with the Pentagon unlikely to
spend the money fast enough to keep up with its
budget requests, two policy analysts said yester
day.
The two urged Congress to take a close look at
the research program before the spending mo
mentum builds.
The administration is seeking $3.7 billion in
the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 for its Strategic
Defense Initiative (SDI), an effort to develop a
defense shield against long-range nuclear weap
ons. The current budget for the program is $1.4
billion.
"The SDI is frequently referred to as a $26 bil
lion, five-year program," said John Pike, author
of a new study by the Federation of American
Scientists. "However, this cost and time-frame is
a product of the Department of Defense budget
process, which only projects five years into the
future. In fact, the initial development phase of
the SDI will run through the early 19905, at a
cost of about $70 billion in current year dollars."
The federation, with 5,000 members, is dedi

cated to ending the arms race.
Pike said he arrived at the estimate using
available Pentagon figures and previous es
timates by two industry groups, the Electronic
Industries Association and the Defense Market
ing Service. He said the estimate may be conser
vative, given past cost-overruns in Pentagon pro
grams.
Mayors criticize budget
CHICAGO — President Reagan's proposed
1986 budget could bring massive layoffs, higher
taxes, mass transit fare increases of up to 50 per
cent and further urbay decay, mayors of 18 of the
nation's larger cities said yesterday.
'We're expected to believe that the city is
hoarding while the federal cupboard is bare,"
said Milwaukee Mayor Henry Maier, a member
of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, at a news con
ference called by the mayors group. "President
Reagan does not have a mandate to destroy the
cities of America." The executive committee
of the group was in Chicago to kick off a series of
meetings nationwide to combat Reagan's budget.
New Orleans Mayor Ernest Morial, conference

president, said the cuts in the proposed $973.7
billion spending plan threaten to create "two
societies — one rich and one poor," with the po
tential for urban unrest reminiscent of the 19605.
Perhaps most devastating to the cities, the
mayors said, would be massive cuts in federal aid
for successful programs such as revenue sharing
and Urban Development Action Grants.
Citing an example of the budget's impact,
Chicago Mayor Harold Washington said the city
could lose more than $1 billion from 1986
through 1988, or more than 14 percent of its
operating budget.
Stock market falls
The stock market fell broadly yesterday,
detouring from the path of steady advances it has
followed in early 1985 amid profit-taking and a
decline in the price of a key blue-chip issue, IBM.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials,
which rose 12.25 last week, fell 13.91 to
1,276.06.
