Davis starts Senate race
LOS ANGELES — State Sen. Ed Davis for
mally launched his campaign 'for the 1986 Re
publican nomination for the U.S. Senate yester
day, labeling Democratic incumbent Alan
Cranston as "a cynical liberal" who has favored
the wealthy over average taxpayers.
In a four-city announcement tour, the 68-year
old former Los Angeles police chief criticized
Cranston as "a weathervane politician" who has
taken inconsistent positions on the B-l bomber,
tax cuts, the "Star Wars" space defense plan and
other issues.
"We find a rather irresolute man, who is ail
over the place on all the issues, who can really be
called a weathervane politician — not really
standing for anyone or anything except his own
perpetuation," Davis told a Van Nuys news con
ference.
"Alan Cranston is a cynical liberal who has
specialized in lucrative tax breaks for large busi
ness enterprises while ... at the same time, he
has attempted to undo the indexing of income
taxes. Indexing is for the working stiff," he said.
"Alan Cranston has probably seduced more
business executives than Errol Flynn has
women," Davis continued, as he immediately
launched his campaign with a substantially more
strident attack against Cranston than his
relatively cautious formal announcement state
ment.
Davis is the first of at least six Republicans
who are expected to seek the GOP nomination to
oppose Cranston, the second-ranking Democrat
in the U.S. Senate, in his bid for a fourth term.
Bob Naylor of Menlo Park, the former Repub
lican floor leader of the state assembly, is sched
uled to formally announce his candidacy tomor
row. Other probable Republican candidates in
clude economist Arthur Laffer and Reps. Dan
Lundgren of Long Beach, Bill Dannemeyer of
Fullerton and Bobbi Fiedler of Northridge.
The Senate race will be the second bid for
statewide office by Davis, who has represented
the San Fernando Valley in the state Senate since
1981.
In 1978, Davis collected 29 percent of the
GOP vote, to finish second to then-Attorney
General Evelle Younger in a five-way race for
the Republican nomination for governor.

Smith to face charges
LOS ANGELES — Cathy Evelyn Smith
withdrew from a plea bargain agreement yester
day and will instead face murder charges that she
killed comedian John Belushi with a drug
overdose.
Smith did not enter a plea during a brief and
much-delayed hearing before Superior Court
Judge Robert Devich, who ordered the woman
and her attorney, Howard Weitzman, to appear
in Municipal Court again on tomorrow for a pre
liminary hearing date.
Under California law. Smith can ask for the
hearing without entering a plea. A preliminary
hearing determines if the case has sufficient
evidence to go to trial.
"I can't in good conscience, based on con
versations with Smith . . . make a recommenda
tion that she enter a plea of guilty to any
homicide," Weitzman told the judge.
Both Weitzman and Deputy District Attorney
Michael Montagna agreed that Smith's decision
throws out a plea-bargain agreement which the
Canadian woman made with prosecutors before
waiving extradition and coming to the United
States last month.
Montagna said last month that Smith had
agreed to plead guilty to a reduced charge of in
voluntary manslaughter and three counts of fur
nishing and administering narcotics.
"At this point we feel completely relieved to
keep that offer to plead guilty to manslaughter.
That offer is withdrawn . .. We're back on a case
of murder," Montagna told the judge yesterday.
Belushi, 33, the star of TV's "Saturday Night
Live," died in a rented bungalow at the Chateau
Marmcnt Hotel on the Sunset Strip on March 5,
1982. The coroner listed cause of death as acute
heroin and cocaine poisoning.
Smith was questioned by police and released
on the day Belushi died. However, a year later, a
grand jury indicted her on one count of murder
and 13 counts of furnishing and administering
narcotics.
Montagna said the district attorney will file a
formal complaint against Smith tomorrow which
contains the charges from the indictment.
Smith, a onetime backup singer with rock
music groups, is free on $50,000 bail, which she
posted last week. Devich refused Montagna's re
quest to increase it to more than $ 1(H),000.

DA balks on porn charge
SAN FRANCISCO — There will be no pros

Marilyn Chambers, at least for now.
The San Francisco District Attorney's office
declined to press those charges at her arraign
ment yesterday before a Municipal Court judge,
but left open the possibility that it would pursue
the case in the future.
Chambers, star of pornographic movies such as
"Behind the Green Door" and "Insatiable," was
arrested Feb. 1 at the Mitchell Brothers Theater
for allegedly committing a lewd act and soliciting
prostitution.
She denied the charges, claiming she accepted
no money from patrons, but admitting that she
did dance nude near people in the club and
allowed them to touch her.
If you can't lick 'em . . .
SAN FRANCISCO — Federal authorities an
nounced charges yesterday against six people
whose eyes may have gone blurry in a laborious
postal scam — allegedly sifting through millions
of discarded envelopes looking for uncancelled
stamps.
Postal Inspector J.K. Jones said the investiga
tion included a search last October in which more
than 2 million discarded Pacific Gas & Electric
Co. billing envelopes were found at four East
Bay locations. PG&E was then discarding 2.8
million envelopes a month, authorities said.
According to the charges, Stella Johnson, 40,
of San Pablo picked up trash bags filled with en
velopes that had been mailed to PG&E by cus
tomers.
She allegedly kept some envelopes on which
the post office had failed to cancel the stamps,
and turned rest over to three other people.
They would then comb through the envelopes,
find those with uncancelled stamps, soak them
off and resell them as new, authorities said.

over the place on all the issues, who can really be
called a weathervane politician — not really
standing for anyone or anything except his own
perpetuation," Davis told a Van Nuys news con
ference.
"Alan Cranston is a cynical liberal who has
specialized in lucrative tax breaks for large busi
ness enterprises while ... at the same time, he
has attempted to undo the indexing of income
taxes. Indexing is for the working stiff," he said.
"Alan Cranston has probably seduced more
business executives than Errol Flynn has
women," Davis continued, as he immediately
launched his campaign with a substantially more
strident attack against Cranston than his
relatively cautious formal announcement state
ment.
Davis is the first of at least six Republicans
who are expected to seek the GOP nomination to
oppose Cranston, the second-ranking Democrat
in the U.S. Senate, in his bid for a fourth term.
Bob Naylor of Menlo Park, the former Repub
lican floor leader of the state assembly, is sched
uled to formally announce his candidacy tomor
row. Other probable Republican candidates in
clude economist Arthur Laffer and Reps. Dan
Lundgren of Long Beach, Bill Dannemeyer of
Fullerton and Bobbi Fiedler of Northridge.
The Senate race will be the second bid for
statewide office by Davis, who has represented
the San Fernando Valley in the state Senate since
1981.
In 1978, Davis collected 29 percent of the
GOP vote, to finish second to then-Attorney
General Evelle Younger in a five-way race for
the Republican nomination for governor.

Smith to face charges
LOS ANGELES — Cathy Evelyn Smith
withdrew from a plea bargain agreement yester
day and will instead face murder charges that she
killed comedian John Belushi with a drug
overdose.
Smith did not enter a plea during a brief and
much-delayed hearing before Superior Court
Judge Robert Devich, who ordered the woman
and her attorney, Howard Weitzman, to appear
in Municipal Court again on tomorrow for a pre
liminary hearing date.
Under California law. Smith can ask for the
hearing without entering a plea. A preliminary
hearing determines if the case has sufficient
evidence to go to trial.
"I can't in good conscience, based on con
versations with Smith . . . make a recommenda
tion that she enter a plea of guilty to any
homicide," Weitzman told the judge.
Both Weitzman and Deputy District Attorney
Michael Montagna agreed that Smith's decision
throws out a plea-bargain agreement which the
Canadian woman made with prosecutors before
waiving extradition and coming to the United
States last month.
Montagna said last month that Smith had
agreed to plead guilty to a reduced charge of in
voluntary manslaughter and three counts of fur
nishing and administering narcotics.
"At this point we feel completely relieved to
keep that offer to plead guilty to manslaughter.
That offer is withdrawn . .. We're back on a case
of murder," Montagna told the judge yesterday.
Belushi, 33, the star of TV's "Saturday Night
Live," died in a rented bungalow at the Chateau
Marmcnt Hotel on the Sunset Strip on March 5,
1982. The coroner listed cause of death as acute
heroin and cocaine poisoning.
Smith was questioned by police and released
on the day Belushi died. However, a year later, a
grand jury indicted her on one count of murder
and 13 counts of furnishing and administering
narcotics.
Montagna said the district attorney will file a
formal complaint against Smith tomorrow which
contains the charges from the indictment.
Smith, a onetime backup singer with rock
music groups, is free on $50,000 bail, which she
posted last week. Devich refused Montagna's re
quest to increase it to more than $ 1(H),000.

DA balks on porn charge
SAN FRANCISCO — There will be no pros
titution charges pressed against X-rated film star
Marilyn Chambers, at least for now.
The San Francisco District Attorney's office
declined to press those charges at her arraign
ment yesterday before a Municipal Court judge,
but left open the possibility that it would pursue
the case in the future.
Chambers, star of pornographic movies such as
"Behind the Green Door" and "Insatiable," was
arrested Feb. 1 at the Mitchell Brothers Theater
for allegedly committing a lewd act and soliciting
prostitution.
She denied the charges, claiming she accepted
no money from patrons, but admitting that she
did dance nude near people in the club and
allowed them to touch her.
If you can't lick 'em . . .
SAN FRANCISCO — Federal authorities an
nounced charges yesterday against six people
whose eyes may have gone blurry in a laborious
postal scam — allegedly sifting through millions
of discarded envelopes looking for uncancelled
stamps.
Postal Inspector J.K. Jones said the investiga
tion included a search last October in which more
than 2 million discarded Pacific Gas & Electric
Co. billing envelopes were found at four East
Bay locations. PG&E was then discarding 2.8
million envelopes a month, authorities said.
According to the charges, Stella Johnson, 40,
of San Pablo picked up trash bags filled with en
velopes that had been mailed to PG&E by cus
tomers.
She allegedly kept some envelopes on which
the post office had failed to cancel the stamps,
and turned rest over to three other people.
They would then comb through the envelopes,
find those with uncancelled stamps, soak them
off and resell them as new, authorities said.
Today's weather
A chance of light rain this morning in the Stan
ford area, becoming partly cloudy in the after
noon, with highs from the mid 50s to the mid 60s
and light winds. Fair overnight with lows in the
mid 30s to mid 40s.
Davis starts Senate race
LOS ANGELES — State Sen. Ed Davis for
mally launched his campaign 'for the 1986 Re
publican nomination for the U.S. Senate yester
day, labeling Democratic incumbent Alan
Cranston as "a cynical liberal" who has favored
the wealthy over average taxpayers.
In a four-city announcement tour, the 68-year
old former Los Angeles police chief criticized
Cranston as "a weathervane politician" who has
taken inconsistent positions on the B-l bomber,
tax cuts, the "Star Wars" space defense plan and
other issues.
