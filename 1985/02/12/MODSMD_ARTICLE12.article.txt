## Pedestals, leaks and brain death 
### 
Dear Bug Me:
Has Ronald Reagan been certified
brain dead yet?
- Mark Williams, Theta Chi
This is the first question I got as the
Bug, Mark, so it does have sentimen
tal value, but I have to admit that I
don t know the answer. I couldn't
find the answer. 1 couldn't make up
an answer. And I don't care if there is
an answer.
How's that for guilt?
I did call Cowell Health Center. I
figured if they didn't have an answer
for you, then no one would.
The medical definition of one who
suffers from being brain dead, ac
cording to the Cowell staff, is some
one with a flat EEG (electro
encephalogram).
If you've ever watched a soap, you
probably know as well as any doctor
what this is. It means the only good
guy character in "Mayberry Manor" has
insulted his scriptwriters and must
now drop into a mysterious coma
♦after a brawl with the jealous hus
band of one of his many sex symbol
lovers.
The bouncy little cursor on the
screen of his life has lost its carbona
tion. His blip is beeped out. Someone
straightened his green line. The elec
trical activity in his brain has shorted
out, to get technical.
I don't know how this applies to the
president, Mike. You interpret it for
yourself.
Dear Bug Me:
For what is the pedestal in front of
Meyer Library to be used?
Why is the south wall (the one
closest to Santa Teresa St.) of Terman
always covered with plastic? Does it
leak?
- Mog Moore
That's three questions, isn't it? It's
too bad I don't get paid by the an

swer. That's OK. Here's your three
for-the-price-of-one response.
Your first question's pretty obser
vant. That pedestal was put in some
time near the beginning of winter
quarter in preparation for the arrival
of Rodin's monument to Balzac that
is on loan from the Los Angeles
County Museum of Art for about two
years.

All of you who are asking your
selves, "What pedestal?" should refer

to the first question and check in at
Cowell for an EEG test.
According to Museum Registrar
Kate Kimelman, the installation
should come sometime next week,
depending on when the riggers and
crane can be arranged.
7 The sculpture has been kept in
storage at Stanford since last March.
It won't be used in the permanent
Rodin garden behind the museum,
like the other outdoor Rodin pieces,
because it is on loan.
Your second question isn't as
timely as the first was. That plastic
has been keeping rain out of Terman
since 1979, when a leak in the walls
first allowed water into offices along
the exposed walls.
The problem is that the bond be
tween the wood pieces and the
masonry sections is not waterproof,
according to an administrator in the

School of Engineering.
Other than a couple hundred dol
lars' worth of damage done to things
along the walls when the first rains hit
Terman, no money has been lost ex
cept in inconvenience, according to
Ken Down, assistant dean of business
and finance for the School of Engi
neering.
University officials are negotiating
with the architect, Harry Weese of
Chicago, to determine who will pay
for the repairs.
Down said the University hopes to
get started on repairs this spring. The
solution in the past has been to cover
the walls with plastic each fall.
"It's literally a rain coat," said
Down.
Just don't ask me what size Terman
wears.
Dear Bug Me:
Why is it that when I call a 497-
number, it takes so long to go through,
and sometimes never does go
through? How can the best school in
the country have such an archaic
phone system?
-J. Niedzielski
Before I started harassing Pacific
Bell, I timed the pause between
dialing a 497- and hearing the first
ring, and I found I waited an average
10.8 seconds. Impatient, aren't you?
But I'm supposed to be answering,
not asking questions, so I spent half
an hour in the operator run-around
wondering who was harassing whom

before I hit the upper echelons of
"service reps."
(Actually, operators are really very
polite while they spend 10 minutes
deciding that they don't know the an
swer to your question.)
Andy Pearson of the marketing de
partment must not have had anyone
else to transfer me to, so he divulged
that the system Stanford uses now is a
CU Centrex — a "step-by-step" type
electromechanical system — that was
developed in the '20s and '30s, but
was still in use in the '70s.
It was "not necessarily state-of
the-art" when it was installed 10
years ago because there were faster,
electronic systems that don't have to
wait for relays to click and magnets to
drop for a connection to be made, ac
cording to Pearson.
The University has contracted
Northern Telecom to install a whole
electronic communications project,
according to Greg Steiger, an em
ployee of that company. Pacific Bell
will continue to provide a dial tone
and access to the outside world, but
on campus there will be a new and
improved, faster-acting $20 million
electronic system named Northern SL
100 to frustrate you with its mil
lisecond waits.
I wouldn't get hung up over it,
though.
Please keep those questions com
ing in. I have not yet begun to be
bugged.
