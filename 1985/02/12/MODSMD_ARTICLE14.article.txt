## The
						Stanford Daily ASSU oversteps bounds 
### 
In 1774, British politician and political writer
Edmund Burke addressed the electors of Bristol
in an effort to gain a position in the House of
Commons. In his speech, Burke explained his
belief in a "trustee" style of representation.
He explained to them that he would use his
own independent judgment and would not neces
sarily try to figure out what the majority wanted.
His logic was that a member of the House of
Commons should vote in what he believed was
best for the country.
In 1985, it seems that the ASSU Senate Ap
propriations Committee has taken the beliefs of
Burke to heart. Since last Tuesday, in accordance
with the ASSU bylaws, the committee has been
auditing the budgets and reviewing the estimates
of the organizations which have requested fee as
sessments for the next academic year.
The ASSU bylaws allow the committee to
perform a necessary task for the students: to
make sure that the budgets are in order and
honest and that the estimates are proper. But in
so doing, some of the organizations have com
plained, the committee has overstepped its
ground.
According to Chaparral Business Manager

Karen Easterbrook, one committee member
"kept on saying that we didn't perform enough of
a public service for them to support us. . . .
[another member] said that they figured out how
much it would cost per student and said they
couldn't support us."
KZSU Business Manager Ted Wheeler said
the appropriations committee went through his
budget line by line, but added that it "went a little
off base, asking about ratings. But we were ask
ing for a significant increase."
One ASSU senator said that "it appears that
they (the committee) are not evaluating on the
merits of the budgets, rather on the merits of how
they value" the groups which apply.
That .is not the power that the students have
given the ASSU in this situation. The students, in
fact, are the ones who should be deciding
whether or not an organization deserves to be
funded when the fee assessment elections are
held next quarter.
So the ASSU should take a step back from
Burke's philosophy, or at least heed the judg
ment that the electors of Bristol made 211 years
ago: Burke lost.
