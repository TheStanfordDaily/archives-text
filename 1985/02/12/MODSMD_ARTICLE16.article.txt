## Don't ignore the important issues 
### 
"This country sucks . . . the deeper
this country sinks into corruption and
hypocrisy the more patriotic and self
righteous we become." That was ba
sically the thesis of Tim Quirk's
column, "Red, White and Blues"
(The Daily, Jan. 22). After reading
Quirk's column, I sat back and waited
for the outraged responses to start
pouring in. After all, what could be

VIEWPOINT

more thought-provoking than a red
blooded American's (assuming, of
course, that Quirk is not a commu
nist) diatribe against our country and
our, president, who so recently
received his overwhelming mandate?
When I was told that nobody had
responded to Quirk's column, I was
puzzled and examined the responses
that The Daily had received to dis
cover which vital issues had drawn at
tention away from such a direct
attack on our motherland. The
responses, which included letters
giving an explanation of the Commit
tee on Services to Students-
Residences' attitude toward co-ops
and an impassioned defense of frater
nities, all covered relevant and com
pelling topics. However, seeing as we,
the student body of Stanford Univer
sity, are widely acknowledged to be
"the leaders of tomorrow" and seeing
as we have been painstakingly selec
ted from such diverse socioeconomic
backgrounds, I still could not under
stand why Quirk's column went by
without so much as a comment.
I don't believe that the reason
nobody responded was because
nobody cared. But, as you can see
from the subjects of the letters that
we}e written, we (human beings,
Americans, Stanford students) have a
disturbing habit of actively consider
ing and reacting to only those matters
which directly affect us. But (and this
especially applies to we "leaders of
tomorrow") we can all see where this

attitude of letting "someone else"
tackle the "bigger issues" has gotten
us. Fraternities and co-ops aside,
these bigger issues should be the ones
that stimulate our intellect and draw
our energy. In this instance the issue
is the ever-strengthening psychologi
cal phenomenon of "New Patriotism"
and all of the attitudes and policies
which it entails. Quirk obviously finds
this new fad repugnant. Why? Prob
ably not because it will ever affect
him (seeing as he is not a farmer in
Nicaragua or a teenager from Har
lem), but because he senses that this
New Patriotism will manifest itself in
policies that will directly affect and
harm others.
Of course, I have so far ignored
several possible categories of people
who did not seem to react. In one cat
egory are the people who disagree
with Quirk's value judgement about
New Patriotism. By this, I mean that
they may be perfectly content with
our new macho motif and realize that
the best way to keep Quirk's argu
ment from gaining support is simply
to ignore it. I mean, for them to get
excited about such a trifle would
make about as much sense as the
most powerful country in the world
getting upset about an under
developed country of 2.9 million re
ceiving a few fighter jets. Simply not
worth the trouble.
Under another category are the
ones who were turned off by Quirk's
style. After all, he did use awfully
harsh language . . . words like
"sucks" and phrases like, "A patriot's
idea of fun is watching Goldie Hawn
have multiple orgasms while she
recites the Declaration of Indepen
dence." And even some of you bleed
ing heart liberals out there have to
admit that his fairly violent self
criticism made you feel a little un
comfortable and defensive.
A last category includes those who,
while somewhat put off by his style,
basically agreed with the gist of

Quirk's attack. Some may have raised
a clenched fist in the air or ripped up
the Jan. 28 cover of their Newsweek
(the one with an angelic, John
Waynish looking Reagan taking his
oath of office). Others may have
quietly discussed their reactions with
friends. Most probably nodded
knowingly,, then turned the page.
Nobody, at least to my observation,
reacted strongly and personally to the
column. As I said earlier, I don't
believe that nobody reacted because
nobody cared. Rather, I think that
the relative indifference can be attrib
uted to two factors.
The first factor, as I have already
mentioned, is our propensity to not
become motivated about issues which
do not directly affect us. This is, un
fortunately, a very human trait. For
example, to my knowledge, no article
created a greater uproar than Gordon
Schmeirer's about the cuteness of
freshman girls. Now I'm not saying
that the cuteness of girls, or the
defense of frats, or an explanation of
co-op attitude should not motivate
us. . . . These are important issues
(well, two of them anyway) among
the many which directly affect us.
These "direct" issues are a vital part
of our lives ... as they should be.
However, we should be equally
motivated about the "bigger issues"
which may not seem to directly affect
us. Why? First, because they do affect
others and we, as supposedly compas
sionate beings, should care about
that. Second, because eventually they
will directly affect us, or, if not us, our
children.
The second factor is our tendency
to temper our emotions about topics
which we consider somehow "too big"
to affect or handle. After all, Reagan
et al. are in office for at least another
four years, and who in the world can
fight a psychological phenomenon?
A concrete example? OK, take the
Marine recruiting commercial that
has recently been on TV. In this com

mercial we see a raw, burning hunk of
iron being welded into a sword. The
final image is of the glistening sword
flashing out of its sheath, slicing
through the air and snapping into po
sition, inches from the proud and
hardened face of the corpsman. I
know, I know . . . just a commercial.
But it's also a sign of the times. We're
going on a power trip, and it's a scary
thing.
It's scary in the short run, because
it causes the public to acquiesce to
U.S. support of the contras, who are
putting bullets in little babies' heads.
It's scary in the medium run, because
it may lead to a U.S. invasion of
Nicaragua, where we will put even
more bullets into more babies'
heads.-It's scary in the long run, be
cause this kind of power-dominated,
confrontationalist attitude has led us
to the brink. .. . And once we cross
over, we're all going to die.
Pretty dramatic stuff, I know. But
that's the whole point. Believe me,
I'm trying desperately not to turn
anybody off. Quirk's anger and my
drama simply express our exaspera
tion with this sense of acceptance and
resignation which most adopt when
confronted with these bigger issues —
issues that somehow seem out of our
grasp.
You may agree with this direction
in which America is going. That's
your privilege. You may disagree, as I
do. Whichever. But don't feel ambi
valent! Babies are dying because of
our policies. If you agree with these
policies, OK, but acknowledge this
and know why you agree. If you dis
agree, OK, but don't feel helpless!
The stakes are too high. We, more
than anyone else, by questioning,
challenging and, above all, learning,
have an obligation at least to try. For
if we do not try, the bigger issues may
again be left to "someone else" —
someone more ignorant or callous.
