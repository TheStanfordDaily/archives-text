# Divestiture won't help black workers
## 
### 
Renewed calls for divestiture of American in
vestments in South Africa have made strange bed
fellows of those in South Africa who traditionally
have been bitter foes. As Senator Edward Kennedy
discovered on his recent trip to South Africa, many
South African black leaders are unified in their op
position to such interference, agreeing that
divestiture will only hurt the black worker.
jßveryone would agree that apartheid is con
temptable. Ready alternatives to white rule in
South Africa, however, are likely to prove worse.
Leading proponents of radical solutions to topple
white rule in South Africa refuse to see that the im
mediate and lasting victims of such an act would be
the blacks, and blacks not only of South Africa but
of the neighboring countries as well.
When compared to blacks of other African na
tions, South African blacks enjoy a greater stan
dard of living, greater literacy, medical care, and
freedom of such first stones of developing
democracies as the press, opportunities for employ
ment, advancement and property ownership.
However morally repugnant is apartheid, and per
haps our inferred support of such government
through investment, the result has been a political
and economic stability useful to blacks.
A survey of black South African factory workers
by the eminent sociologist Lawrence Schlemer
revealed that while blacks understandably oppose
apartheid and are suspicious of the Botha govern
ment. over 75 percent oppose American campaigns
for divestiture. They do not see American invest
ment as support for apartheid. Rather, they do see
that American investment brings American labor
policies to South Africa: higher wages, job training,
unionization and, what is more important, jobs.
A strong South African economy, helped in part
by U.S. investment, generates jobs not only for
black South Africans but also for more than 2 mil
lion blacks from neighboring countries who em
migrate to South Africa to work, returning hard
currency and goods to their homelands. Black
Southern African nations have recognized the
benefits they draw from an economically strong
South Africa. South Africa supplies cheap goods
and is a market for their raw materials. For this rea

son, many of South Africa's neighbor nations have
mollified their militant opposition to the Botha
government. Most recently, under the prodding of

the Reagan administration, Mozambique con
cluded an agreement with South Africa to improve
trade and to ease tensions by cutting support for in
surgency movements in South Africa.
Apparently, to many proponents of black
majority rule, declines in living standards are a
tolerable result of the end to colonial rule. As said
SekouToure, late ruler of Guinea: "We prefer
poverty in liberty to riches in slavery." Many would
share Toure's idealism, preferring the dignity of
black self rule. Unfortunately, the historic results of
a rapid transfer from colonial to home rule often
has been not "poverty in liberty" but poverty in
slavery, and often slaughter. The end to white rule
in Rhodesia/Zimbabwe saw the transfer of power
from one autocrat, lan Smith, to another, Robert
Mugabe. The economic well-being of the blacks
declined as traditional investment and economic
organization left the country. If anything, political
freedoms worsened — the press was suspended and
opposition leaders were jailed. Lawrence
Schlemer's statistics show that many blacks, in this
case South African blacks, would not be willing to
suffer economic loss for political gain.
No longer should the vestiges of colonialism
solely be blamed for stagnant economic develop
ment and repressed living standards among blacks.
The problems facing black African nations and the
development of stable political power are more
complex. While many of the people of Ethiopia

starve, their government reportedly spent over
$200 million on recent political celebrations
marking the anniversary of Marxist rule in that
country. The rulers of many newly independent
African nations abandon pledges of democracy and
prosperity, drowning their people in tribal blood
baths; Amin's Uganda, Bokassa's Central African
Empire and the Burundi massacres of 1972 where
80,000-150,000 people died.
Of course such blood-letting and in-fighting is
not reserved to the African continent. The list is
long of one social group oppressing another follow
ing the destabilization of formally entrenched
power structures through decolonization. Protes
tant Irish fought Catholic Irish. Hindu killed Mus
lim. Two million Cambodians died under the
repression of the Pol Pot regime. In Africa, it is not
the case of black killing black, brother killing
brother, as we are wont to perceive here in
America, but one tribe, a distinct social group, ex
acting its will or venting its animosities toward an
other. These complexities seem lost on those
provoking a policy of divestment.
In our enthusiasm to bring about a hasty end to
apartheid, we must be careful not to trod under op
portunities for an enduring economic prosperity.
Apartheid is wrong. Rapid divestiture, however,
and a toppling of apartheid would only bring more
hardship to South African blacks. We must use
U.S. investment in South Africa to coax change, al
lowing the various black tribal leaderships to
coalesce into a unified political body, with leaders
trained and capable of assuming the reins of gov
ernment from the ruling whites.
If we are compelled to assume responsibility for
the betterment of blacks in South Africa, demand
ing an end to the abuses of apartheid, we must also
be compelled to accept blame for the unfortunate
results of its too-hasty termination. Democracy will
not be bought at the price of tumbling standards of
economic and political freedom. In our efforts to
free the black majority from the chains of apartheid
we must be careful not to leave it bound and
shackled by other evils.

Renewed calls for divestiture of American in
vestments in South Africa have made strange bed
fellows of those in South Africa who traditionally
have been bitter foes. As Senator Edward Kennedy
discovered on his recent trip to South Africa, many
South African black leaders are unified in their op
position to such interference, agreeing that
divestiture will only hurt the black worker.
jßveryone would agree that apartheid is con
temptable. Ready alternatives to white rule in
South Africa, however, are likely to prove worse.
Leading proponents of radical solutions to topple
white rule in South Africa refuse to see that the im
mediate and lasting victims of such an act would be
the blacks, and blacks not only of South Africa but
of the neighboring countries as well.
When compared to blacks of other African na
tions, South African blacks enjoy a greater stan
dard of living, greater literacy, medical care, and
freedom of such first stones of developing
democracies as the press, opportunities for employ
ment, advancement and property ownership.
However morally repugnant is apartheid, and per
haps our inferred support of such government
through investment, the result has been a political
and economic stability useful to blacks.
A survey of black South African factory workers
by the eminent sociologist Lawrence Schlemer
revealed that while blacks understandably oppose
apartheid and are suspicious of the Botha govern
ment. over 75 percent oppose American campaigns
for divestiture. They do not see American invest
ment as support for apartheid. Rather, they do see
that American investment brings American labor
policies to South Africa: higher wages, job training,
unionization and, what is more important, jobs.
A strong South African economy, helped in part
by U.S. investment, generates jobs not only for
black South Africans but also for more than 2 mil
lion blacks from neighboring countries who em
migrate to South Africa to work, returning hard
currency and goods to their homelands. Black
Southern African nations have recognized the
benefits they draw from an economically strong
South Africa. South Africa supplies cheap goods
and is a market for their raw materials. For this rea

son, many of South Africa's neighbor nations have
mollified their militant opposition to the Botha
government. Most recently, under the prodding of

the Reagan administration, Mozambique con
cluded an agreement with South Africa to improve
trade and to ease tensions by cutting support for in
surgency movements in South Africa.
Apparently, to many proponents of black
majority rule, declines in living standards are a
tolerable result of the end to colonial rule. As said
SekouToure, late ruler of Guinea: "We prefer
poverty in liberty to riches in slavery." Many would
share Toure's idealism, preferring the dignity of
black self rule. Unfortunately, the historic results of
a rapid transfer from colonial to home rule often
has been not "poverty in liberty" but poverty in
slavery, and often slaughter. The end to white rule
in Rhodesia/Zimbabwe saw the transfer of power
from one autocrat, lan Smith, to another, Robert
Mugabe. The economic well-being of the blacks
declined as traditional investment and economic
organization left the country. If anything, political
freedoms worsened — the press was suspended and
opposition leaders were jailed. Lawrence
Schlemer's statistics show that many blacks, in this
case South African blacks, would not be willing to
suffer economic loss for political gain.
No longer should the vestiges of colonialism
solely be blamed for stagnant economic develop
ment and repressed living standards among blacks.
The problems facing black African nations and the
development of stable political power are more
complex. While many of the people of Ethiopia

starve, their government reportedly spent over
$200 million on recent political celebrations
marking the anniversary of Marxist rule in that
country. The rulers of many newly independent
African nations abandon pledges of democracy and
prosperity, drowning their people in tribal blood
baths; Amin's Uganda, Bokassa's Central African
Empire and the Burundi massacres of 1972 where
80,000-150,000 people died.
Of course such blood-letting and in-fighting is
not reserved to the African continent. The list is
long of one social group oppressing another follow
ing the destabilization of formally entrenched
power structures through decolonization. Protes
tant Irish fought Catholic Irish. Hindu killed Mus
lim. Two million Cambodians died under the
repression of the Pol Pot regime. In Africa, it is not
the case of black killing black, brother killing
brother, as we are wont to perceive here in
America, but one tribe, a distinct social group, ex
acting its will or venting its animosities toward an
other. These complexities seem lost on those
provoking a policy of divestment.
In our enthusiasm to bring about a hasty end to
apartheid, we must be careful not to trod under op
