Business' business
The editorial "Turning Orwellian"
(The Daily, Feb.s) criticized
"mandatory urinalysis drug screening
for job applicants." You based your
criticism on this thesis: "What a
person does on his or her own time is
none of the company's business."
Are you sure you mean that?
Do you mean a bank clerk who
works nights as a burglar should not
be interfered with by his employer
because he's burgling on his own
time?
Or the school teacher who runs a
call-girl agency by night?
Or the airport security guard who
has a $300-a-day heroin problem?
Or the department store executive
who commits incest?
Or the airplane pilot who beats his
wife on his own time?
Ah, you say, the job applicant
who's taking drugs on his own time
isn't guilty of a crime like burglary,
living off the proceeds of prostitu
tion, incest or wife-beating. How
about the airport security guard —
should he be allowed to do airport
screening for weapons? Perhaps, he is
guiltless; still is he qualified for the
job?
Or the garage mechanic who's a
secret member of the Ku Klux Klan
but whose job behavior is impec
cable. On his own time the garage
mechanic likes to behave like a
Klansman behaves. He commits no
crime for which he can be arrested.
Are you sure you mean "what a
person does on his own time is none
of a company's business?"

Consistent liberals
If Jason Matherly in his column
(The Daily, Feb. 6) cannot see the
consistency of denouncing military
and economic support for an un
popular regime in El Salvador and
denouncing support for an even
more unpopular regime in South
Africa, then I can see how he could
so easily make light of the criminal
actions taken by the South African
government.
In his article, he speaks of the

"anti-imperialistic philosophy" of
many "liberals." Well, it is that same
philosophy which leads these same
"liberals" to denounce our economic
involvement in a country such as
South Africa which manipulates its
non-white population in much the
same ruthless and uncaring way as
the imperialistic powers of the 19th
century.
Matherly also vaguely mentions
without specifying some rights that
South Africa's blacks enjoy daily. It
is understandable that Matherly
declined to mention specifically any
of these rights since South Africa's
22 million blacks do not have the
right to vote, to own land, to speak,
congregate or move about freely.
Matherly ends his article by com
paring oppression in South Africa
with oppression in South East Asia.
Although oppression anywhere is
unacceptable and tragic, it is even
more so when it occurs in a modern
industrialized country such as South
Africa, where not only is such racial
oppression condoned, it is
legalized.

Not worse than most
In the letter titled, "Corrupt ma
terial" (The Daily, Feb.s) about the
movie "Heaven Help Us," Kathleen
Smith quoted two captions from
publicity posters circulated around
campus. From these quotations she
condemns the movie as "morally
corrupt material." Because she did
not attend the screening, I find her
judgment premature. Movies are like
novels; judgment cannot be passed
until the book is read.
Although some may question the
movie's theme, I feel the movie has
less "vice, lust and disrespect" than
most current movies — for example,
"Risky Business." In fact, the movie
does not come close to fulfilling the
flyer's implications.
Censorship is the only way to
prevent movies like "Heaven Help
Us" from being shown. Perhaps
Stanford students can do this on
their own.
