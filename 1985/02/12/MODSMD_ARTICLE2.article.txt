# Police arrest hacker

### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Staff writer 
A Cupertino high school student
will be charged with trying to break
into the Stanford computer network
in what Stanford Police Detective
Ron Levine is calling "the first case of
its kind in this area."
The Santa Clara County Sheriffs
Department made the arrest after an
investigation was conducted by Stan
ford police and a new technical-crime
task force led by District Attorney
Doug Southard.
The 15-year-old Homestead High
School student was trying to access
the account maintained by Stanford's
Information Technology Services
(ITS) which contains high school
grades.
High school officials had been
aware of student attempts to access
the Stanford computer since October,
when printouts indicated several at
tempts to gain entry after hours using
teachers' names and school
nicknames as passwords.
"We monitored the situation until
Jan. 1," Levine said. The list of
suspects was narrowed after the
juvenile suspect was arrested for
trespassing at the school and found
with a key to the computer room.
According to a school official, the
student borrowed a master key from
a staff member on Jan. 18, traced the
key on a piece of paper and fashioned
a crude duplicate that enabled him to
enter the computer room.
Levine said the student later ad
mitted that he had seen the eight
letter password required to access the
computer but had failed to memorize
it.
After noticing the failed access at
tempts, the school district quickly
changed its access code. Printouts of
approximately 400 access attempts
made on the weekend of Jan. 19 show
the student was able to remember all
but two letters of the necessary pass
word.
The next morning, Levine said, the
student found the correct former
password.
An article in the high school news
paper said the student, who will face
expulsion as well as criminal prosecu
tion, blamed a friend for doing the ac
tual "hacking." Both students were
apparently considering selling grade
changes for up to $100.
Homestead High School Principal
Ed Bangle said school officials are
also investigating the possibility of
disciplinary action against the stu
dent. A confidential hearing with par
ents, school officials, and legal ad
visers is upcoming. Bangle said.
The student faces prosecution un
der a new California law in effect
since Jan. 1 which outlaws illegal at
tempts to access a computer.
