## Card blanks UCD, streak at 30 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
To the folks who update the record books, yesterday's 9-0 vic
tory by the Stanford women's tennis team over UC-Davis was a
big deal. It was the Cardinal's 30th consecutive dual match vic
tory dating back to last season, breaking the previous record of
29 set by the 1983 squad.
To Stanford Coach Frank Brennan, however, it was just an
other match. And — the way things have been going the past two
seasons — another victory.
"I don't think streaks are very important," Brennan said. "I
think what's important is at the end of the season, whether a team
wins the NCAAs or does not win the NC <\As."
Funny he should mention the NCAA championships. The last
time his Stanford team lost a dual match was in May 1983 at Al
buquerque, N.M. — in the NCAA consolation championships.
Since then, it's been nothing but victories, 30 of them.
Few have been as easy as the one yesterday afternoon at the
Varsity Courts. Stanford, which improved to 4-0, didn't lose a set
in the perfect 9-0 match, Davis' season opener. Seven of the 18
sets were 6-0 and only one Aggie player got more than three
games in a set off a Cardinal netter.
And all this without two of the Cardinal's top players— sopho
more Patty Fendick and senior Linda Gates. The pair just
returned from the National Indoor Intercollegiate Tournament,
where they won the doubles title. For their efforts, Fendick and
Gates were named Western Collegiate Athletic Association Ath
letes of the Week along with USC triple jumper Yvette Bates.
As has been the case in all the matches this season, Brennan
mixed up the lineup yesterday. Sophomore Stephanie Savides
played No. 1 and improved her singles record this season to 9-3
by beating Davis' Maria Newton 6-0, 6-2.
"Stephanie Savides is playing really well," he said. "She's
playing a little higher (on the ladder) than she normally will when
we have everyone back, but she's playing very steady tennis.
Sometimes it's hard to keep your concentration against the lesser
opponents."
Brennan also passed out plaudits to junior Susan Ross, a walk
on who didn't play tennis competitively until her junior year in
high school. Ross defeated Anne Mitchell, 6-4, 6-2, at No. 4 to
raise her singles record to 3-2. She then paired with another
walk-on, freshman Cindy Spiekerman, to rout Davis' No. 3 team
of Kim Wischel and Karen Astrachan, 6-1, 6-0.
"Susan Ross is playing very well this season," Brennan said. "I
think she is probably the most improved player on the team this
season."
Stanford continues its six-match homestand tomorrow against
Santa Clara at 1:30 p.m, then has a week off before hosting
eighth-ranked California next Wednesday.
