## Stanford hosts UCSB after ITCA play 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
After two weeks of Intercollegiate
Tennis Coaches Association tourna
ment competition, the Stanford men's
tennis team will resume dual match
play today against UC-Santa Bar
bara.
The Cardinal had "two weeks of
excellent play" in the ITCA team and
individual championships in Louis
ville, Ky., and Houston, according to
Coach Dick Gould. Stanford
defeated USC in the team finals, 6-3,
and Dan Goldie won the indoor

singles title with a 6-3, 6-2 victory
over Georgia's No. 1-ranked Michael
Pernfors.
Gould greeted Goldie at the air
port on his return Sunday night. He
said he assumed his top player
"attacked" Pernfors with his aggres
sive style of play on return of serve
and at the net.
With the extensive traveling and
number of matches Stanford's top
players have recently played,
however, Gould said he would like to
"give them a break" and not play
them against Santa Barbara.

"They have gone back and forth
across the country several times in a
few weeks. That's really, really tough.
I know Dan had four matches in one
day. . . . They have to be jet-lagged
out," Gould said.
As a result, the four who went to
the tournament, — Goldie, John
Letts, Jim Grabb and Eric Rosenfeld
— will be replaced temporarily today
by Derrick Rostagno, Patrick
McEnroe, Scott Moody and Mark
Jacobson.
Santa Barbara is currently 8-5 in
the Pacific Coast Athletic Association

and is led by senior Gus Andersen in
singles competition. Andersen also
plays No. 1 doubles with John Nis
sley. Chris Russell and Kirk Hull play
No. 2 doubles.
According to Gould, Stanford is
building up to playing Louisiana State
at home on Thursday. LSU is the No.
8 team in the country in ITCA
preseason polls.
"LSU scares everybody they play,"
Gould said. "In a match against USC,
they had them 3-3 after the singles
competition. They are definitely our
toughest preseason opponent."
