# Baseball hosts USF, hopes to rebound
## 
### LARRY GREEN Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford baseball team, 4-2
this season, will look to rebound
from Sunday's shaky 9-5 loss to
Santa Clara when it faces the Uni
versity of San Francisco at Sunken
Diamond today.
USF has posted a 3-3 record so
far this year, but had a late game
against Pacific last night. USF
Coach Ken Bowman said," It's al
ways nice to play Stanford, (but)
we have to be at our best."
Stanford Asst. Coach Dean
Stotz said the USF baseball pro
gram has improved, but that the
Dons weren't quite the caliber of
Stanford's rivals in the Pacific 10
Southern Division. However,
Stotz was quick to add, "Swinging
the bat as we are ... we can't take
anyone lightly."
Bowman plans to start Pat
McClelland (1-0, 4.35 ERA) on
the mound today. He said that "he
is one" of the Dons' best hurlers
and has "pitched well" shortly into
the season.
Bowman also said that he ex
pected a good game out of power
hitter Dave Shelbon (.333).
Stotz said that senior southpaw
Jeff Ballard (1-0, 2.57) will get the
start against the Dons.
Ballard's stint on the mound will
probably be "extended a little fur
ther," Stotz said. "We're looking
for six or seven good innings out of
him. The preseason is when you
get a feel" for what is going to
work during the season, he said.
"The mix (lineup) isn't proper
yet."

The Cardinal's only problem
has been inconsistent hitting up
and down the lineup. Stotz said,
"We have to hit like we can. (So
far) the batting order's changed
each game." He added that at this
point in the season "we're in no
state of panic. We're looking to
get more (hitting) but it's a crazy
game."
After six games the Cardinal has
a .241 team batting average. First
baseman Rick Lundblade contin
ues to carry the team on the
strength of his bat. He is hitting
.333, with five homers and 12
RBIs.
Outfielder Walt Harris is second
on the Cardinal with a .292
average. Catcher John Ramos, the
Cardinal's only other power threat
to materialize this year (two
homers), is third in hitting with a
.286 average.
Second baseman Pete Stanicek
leads the team in stolen bases with
seven thefts in eight atttempts.
Shortstop John Verducci will sit
out today's game with a hamstring
pull that he aggravated in Satur
day's game against Santa Clara.
Stotz said of Lundblade's bat
ting performance so far this year,
"Amen." If Lundblade hits one
more home run, it will be the
23rd of his career and place him in
a four-way tie for fifth place in
Cardinal history.
Ballard can take over sole pos
session of third place for career
victories at Stanford with a win
today. He currently has 24 vic
tories and is in a three-way tie for
third place.
