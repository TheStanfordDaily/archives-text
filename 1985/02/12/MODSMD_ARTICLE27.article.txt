## 'Micki and Maude' proves funny and charming 
### STEVE VINEBERG Editorial staff 
American movies may be passing
through an uninspired period right
now, but Hollywood filmmakers cer
tainly haven't lost the knack for
producing entertaining comedies.
Having finally caught up with "Micki
and Maude" (which opened at
Christmas), I was surprised to find it
fairly consistently funny and charm
ing — surprised because the director,
Blake Edwards, generally makes such
acrid and mean-spirited movies that
my first impulse when he releases
something new is to stay away.
("5.0.8." was one of the least
pleasurable evenings I've ever spent
at the movies. It made me feel un
clean.)
"Micki and Maude" doesn't have
the trademark Edwards nastiness, or
the manic Clouseau humor, that in his
last several films has begun to seem
desperate; actually, it's rather sweet
and refreshingly relaxed. The tone
and style derive, no doubt, from the
script, which Edwards didn't write
this time. He had originally signed to
direct "City Heat" with Clint
Eastwood and Burt Reynolds, but,
when personality conflicts arose, he
left the picture (which contains some
of his material, credited to a pseudo
nym). Then, at a loss for a new proj
ect, he turned to a script by the
playwright Jonathan Reynolds, who
wrote "Geniuses," a thinly disguised
comedy about the making of
"Apocalypse Now."
His willingness to put himself com
pletely at the service of Reynolds'
screenplay is highly commendable,
especially since it's a clever piece of
writing about Rob Salinger, a TV
broadcast journalist who ends up with
two pregnant wives. And it brings out
a side of Edwards — a cozy, ap
preciative side, almost a laissez-faire
side — no one could have anticipated.
Possibly the presence of his friend
Dudley Moore, the star of "10," in
the leading role allowed him to calm
down and let the movie spin its
merry, unemphatic way. In its best
moments, "Micki and Maude," with
its amorous hero who loves two
women and the idea of a family too
much to let either of them go, is like
Bertrand Blier in Manhattan (as in
congruous as that may sound): You
don't feel that Edwards (or
Reynolds) is making any judgments
on the characters' behavior.
Dudley Moore was terrific in the
slapstick sections of "10" (the
melancholy, menopausal-male scenes
called for a depth he failed to deliver
— they cried out for the George Segal
of a decade ago) and in almost all of

"Arthur" (especially the tete-a-tetes
with John Gielgud). But he's even
better to watch with Amy Irving, who
plays Maude, the cellist who stirs Rob
to commit bigamy. Rob and Maude
have a loony, unstructured, unfussy
good time together, in scenes that
seem to have been improved entirely
without self-consciousness. In fact,
thinking over them afterwards, you
aren't sure that much happens in their
exchanges; it's not a case of good
comic actors making the most of a
bright piece of dialogue, or even an
expertly assembled situation. In their

funniest bit, Moore and Irving watch
a caveman picture on television and
go crazy aping the clumsy plasticine
monsters. (I'd happily trade all of the
expensive jungle footage in
"Greystoke" for this two-minute seg
ment.)
The only problem with the Moore-
Irving scenes is that the amazing rap
port between these two performers
wrecks the balance of the picture, in a
way that neither Reynolds nor Ed
wards could have guessed. As Micki,
the superwoman lawyer who

postpones a position on the Supreme
Court to have a baby, Ann Reinking
can't be faulted for a lack of warmth
or skill or genuine high spirits, or for
not creating a distinctive and appeal
ing character, though, at various
points during the film, I was ready to
believe that she had seriously let the
comedy down in one of these depart
ments. The fact is that she and Moore
simply don't connect on screen the
way he and Irving do, and so Micki
seems to be trying too hard with Rob
— as if she knew (long before the
movie allows for it) that she had a

rival. Reinking's overzealousness
makes Maude look like the better
partner for Rob, and that shouldn't
be the case.
"Micki and Maude" isn't a great
movie; it has some limp scenes, most
of them when Rob is at work. (An in
terview he conducts with six men
wearing nothing but handguns
doesn't even raise a chuckle.) But one
scene, in the waiting room of a doc
tor's office, is as funny as anything
I've seen at the movies in the past
year, and I had a fine time all the way

through; the film doesn't disintegrate,
the way so many comedies do ("All
of Me," to take one example). The
late scenes have something of the
flavor of the subplot in Jonathan
Demme's "Citizens Band" (or
"Handle with Care"), involving the
amiable big-boned trucker, played by
Charles Napier, and his two spouses
(Marcia Rodd and Ann Wedgeworth)
— certainly a recommendation —
and Jonathan Reynolds rounds out
the story perfectly. You walk away
feeling you've just taken an afternoon
off.

scene, in the waiting room of a doc
tor's office, is as funny as anything
I've seen at the movies in the past
year, and I had a fine time all the way

through; the film doesn't disintegrate,
the way so many comedies do ("All
of Me," to take one example). The
late scenes have something of the
flavor of the subplot in Jonathan
Demme's "Citizens Band" (or
"Handle with Care"), involving the
amiable big-boned trucker, played by
Charles Napier, and his two spouses
(Marcia Rodd and Ann Wedgeworth)
— certainly a recommendation —
and Jonathan Reynolds rounds out
the story perfectly. You walk away
feeling you've just taken an afternoon
off.


Blake Edwards directs Amy Irving, Dudley Moore and Ann Reinking in "Micki and Maude."
American movies may be passing
through an uninspired period right
now, but Hollywood filmmakers cer
tainly haven't lost the knack for
producing entertaining comedies.
Having finally caught up with "Micki
and Maude" (which opened at
Christmas), I was surprised to find it
fairly consistently funny and charm
ing — surprised because the director,
Blake Edwards, generally makes such
acrid and mean-spirited movies that
my first impulse when he releases
something new is to stay away.
("5.0.8." was one of the least
pleasurable evenings I've ever spent
at the movies. It made me feel un
clean.)
"Micki and Maude" doesn't have
the trademark Edwards nastiness, or
the manic Clouseau humor, that in his
last several films has begun to seem
desperate; actually, it's rather sweet
and refreshingly relaxed. The tone
and style derive, no doubt, from the
script, which Edwards didn't write
this time. He had originally signed to
direct "City Heat" with Clint
Eastwood and Burt Reynolds, but,
when personality conflicts arose, he
left the picture (which contains some
of his material, credited to a pseudo
nym). Then, at a loss for a new proj
ect, he turned to a script by the
playwright Jonathan Reynolds, who
wrote "Geniuses," a thinly disguised
comedy about the making of
"Apocalypse Now."
His willingness to put himself com
pletely at the service of Reynolds'
screenplay is highly commendable,
especially since it's a clever piece of
writing about Rob Salinger, a TV
broadcast journalist who ends up with
two pregnant wives. And it brings out
a side of Edwards — a cozy, ap
preciative side, almost a laissez-faire
side — no one could have anticipated.
Possibly the presence of his friend
Dudley Moore, the star of "10," in
the leading role allowed him to calm
down and let the movie spin its
merry, unemphatic way. In its best
moments, "Micki and Maude," with
its amorous hero who loves two
women and the idea of a family too
much to let either of them go, is like
Bertrand Blier in Manhattan (as in
congruous as that may sound): You
don't feel that Edwards (or
Reynolds) is making any judgments
on the characters' behavior.
Dudley Moore was terrific in the
slapstick sections of "10" (the
melancholy, menopausal-male scenes
called for a depth he failed to deliver
— they cried out for the George Segal
of a decade ago) and in almost all of

"Arthur" (especially the tete-a-tetes
with John Gielgud). But he's even
better to watch with Amy Irving, who
plays Maude, the cellist who stirs Rob
to commit bigamy. Rob and Maude
have a loony, unstructured, unfussy
good time together, in scenes that
seem to have been improved entirely
without self-consciousness. In fact,
thinking over them afterwards, you
aren't sure that much happens in their
exchanges; it's not a case of good
comic actors making the most of a
bright piece of dialogue, or even an
expertly assembled situation. In their

funniest bit, Moore and Irving watch
a caveman picture on television and
go crazy aping the clumsy plasticine
monsters. (I'd happily trade all of the
expensive jungle footage in
"Greystoke" for this two-minute seg
ment.)
The only problem with the Moore-
Irving scenes is that the amazing rap
port between these two performers
wrecks the balance of the picture, in a
way that neither Reynolds nor Ed
wards could have guessed. As Micki,
the superwoman lawyer who

postpones a position on the Supreme
Court to have a baby, Ann Reinking
can't be faulted for a lack of warmth
or skill or genuine high spirits, or for
not creating a distinctive and appeal
ing character, though, at various
points during the film, I was ready to
believe that she had seriously let the
comedy down in one of these depart
ments. The fact is that she and Moore
simply don't connect on screen the
way he and Irving do, and so Micki
seems to be trying too hard with Rob
— as if she knew (long before the
movie allows for it) that she had a

rival. Reinking's overzealousness
makes Maude look like the better
partner for Rob, and that shouldn't
be the case.
"Micki and Maude" isn't a great
movie; it has some limp scenes, most
of them when Rob is at work. (An in
terview he conducts with six men
wearing nothing but handguns
doesn't even raise a chuckle.) But one
scene, in the waiting room of a doc
tor's office, is as funny as anything
