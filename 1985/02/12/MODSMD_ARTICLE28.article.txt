## 'Russia' fails as a play, but triumphs as 3-D art 
### AMY FRIEDMAN 
The dream sequences of "Russia" twist through the tor
ments of a father trying to keep his daughter from drifting
away from him, and his daughter trying to find her own
identity as a sexual, independent adult. The look and
sound of this multi-media performance are stunning, yet
they do not express the theme of "intolerance" that the
director/creator Chris Hardman wanted to explore in the
production.
Projected against black, red letters spell out "Russia."
White circles float back and forth as attendants dressed in

black place the circles over the letters as they are called
out rhythmically and randomly — "U-S-A," "U-S-S-R,"
"A-S-S," "S-S-A." The introduction draws the audience
into the landscape that is graphic and well-defined and, at
the same time, fantastic, mythical. In this context the ex
otic masks that the characters wear allow for the abstrac
tion of their ideas while allowing for their uniqueness. The
masks are futuristic without being cold and have a quality
reminiscent of Joan Miro or of the cartoons of William
Steig, playful and comforting without being familiar.
Russian fighter planes attack all around. This first
nightmare establishes the father's extreme fear of the
Russians. Pilots radio of impending danger and the father
does his best to destroy the enemy. White triangles to rep
resent planes zoom across the stage, and the scene fades
to Times Square in New York. It is New Year's Eve — a
voice explains what is going on. He talks of how everyone
is getting bombed. Then in answer to an unspoken ques

tion, the voice explains that he means "bombed" in the
sense of getting drunk. This clarifies the abstruse connec
tion between the scenes and reinforces the fact that this is
a dream.
The father is awakened by his wife. "Jim," she seems to
call out, yet it is not her voice — it is a pre-recorded voice,
as is all the dialogue. The clarity of the sound is haunting.
Through the conversations and reflections, the story un
folds. Jim cannot understand why his daughter, Lily, has
gone off. He imagines the men with whom she is involved
to be Russians, whom he associates with evil. Lily is
energized by the discovery of her sexual self and is frank
in her enjoyment of it. She understands how much she is
hurting her father, yet knows that she must do as she
pleases. She is no longer "daddy's little girl" and is com
fortable with that.
But Jim is not as accepting. He goes so far as to hire a
private eye to get back his daughter. The private eye is the
most marvelous and witty creation by Sherry Charles, the
costume designer. He is wrapped in black so the only
visible part of him is his head, an "eye" formed by a neon
light.
The story is presumptuous and plods on heavy
handedly. The connections between intolerance, Russia,
evil and naivete are too simplistic and not nearly well
developed enough to hold the interest of the audience.
The ending rushes to a close that is ambiguous, in fact, the
audience needed the staff to cue them for the final ap
plause because it remained uncertain that it had really
finished.
The aesthetic quality of the production is stunning. The
minimalist staging and the throbbing electronic music are
exceptional and together offer a surprising variety and
beauty. Black ensconces the whole theater and breaks
down the barrier between audience and stage: the audi
ence is in the performance almost as much as the players.
It is therefore a real disappointment that the theme does
not work.
Antenna Theater has achieved recognition as an inno
vative and probing theatrical group. It was founded by
Chris Hardman and is based in Sausalito. It "seeks to in
vent, discover and explore ways of involving the public" in
the performances. Hardman has experimented with
"walk-through" productions that involve the viewer in
unfolding the story as he walks through the set among ac
tors, picking up props and listening to the story on a
walkman. In "Russia," Hardman tries a more traditional
format and clearly does not want to abandon his dedica
tion to ingenuity. But he confuses innovation with quirki
ness and because of this the production teeters between
fresh images and stale storytelling. There is a new-wave
atmosphere around a trite story; there are imaginative
sights and sounds falling on a flat theme. As a three
dimensional piece of art, "Russia" succeeds mag
nificently; as a play, it fails.

White circles float back and forth as attendants dressed in

black place the circles over the letters as they are called
out rhythmically and randomly — "U-S-A," "U-S-S-R,"
"A-S-S," "S-S-A." The introduction draws the audience
into the landscape that is graphic and well-defined and, at
the same time, fantastic, mythical. In this context the ex
otic masks that the characters wear allow for the abstrac
tion of their ideas while allowing for their uniqueness. The
masks are futuristic without being cold and have a quality
reminiscent of Joan Miro or of the cartoons of William
Steig, playful and comforting without being familiar.
Russian fighter planes attack all around. This first
nightmare establishes the father's extreme fear of the
Russians. Pilots radio of impending danger and the father
does his best to destroy the enemy. White triangles to rep
resent planes zoom across the stage, and the scene fades
to Times Square in New York. It is New Year's Eve — a
voice explains what is going on. He talks of how everyone
is getting bombed. Then in answer to an unspoken ques

tion, the voice explains that he means "bombed" in the
sense of getting drunk. This clarifies the abstruse connec
tion between the scenes and reinforces the fact that this is
a dream.
The father is awakened by his wife. "Jim," she seems to
call out, yet it is not her voice — it is a pre-recorded voice,
as is all the dialogue. The clarity of the sound is haunting.
Through the conversations and reflections, the story un
folds. Jim cannot understand why his daughter, Lily, has
gone off. He imagines the men with whom she is involved
to be Russians, whom he associates with evil. Lily is
energized by the discovery of her sexual self and is frank
in her enjoyment of it. She understands how much she is
hurting her father, yet knows that she must do as she
pleases. She is no longer "daddy's little girl" and is com
fortable with that.
But Jim is not as accepting. He goes so far as to hire a
private eye to get back his daughter. The private eye is the
most marvelous and witty creation by Sherry Charles, the
costume designer. He is wrapped in black so the only
visible part of him is his head, an "eye" formed by a neon
light.
The story is presumptuous and plods on heavy
handedly. The connections between intolerance, Russia,
evil and naivete are too simplistic and not nearly well
developed enough to hold the interest of the audience.
The ending rushes to a close that is ambiguous, in fact, the
audience needed the staff to cue them for the final ap
plause because it remained uncertain that it had really
finished.
The aesthetic quality of the production is stunning. The
minimalist staging and the throbbing electronic music are
exceptional and together offer a surprising variety and
beauty. Black ensconces the whole theater and breaks
down the barrier between audience and stage: the audi
ence is in the performance almost as much as the players.
It is therefore a real disappointment that the theme does
not work.
Antenna Theater has achieved recognition as an inno
vative and probing theatrical group. It was founded by
Chris Hardman and is based in Sausalito. It "seeks to in
vent, discover and explore ways of involving the public" in
the performances. Hardman has experimented with
"walk-through" productions that involve the viewer in
unfolding the story as he walks through the set among ac
tors, picking up props and listening to the story on a
walkman. In "Russia," Hardman tries a more traditional
format and clearly does not want to abandon his dedica
tion to ingenuity. But he confuses innovation with quirki
ness and because of this the production teeters between
fresh images and stale storytelling. There is a new-wave
atmosphere around a trite story; there are imaginative
sights and sounds falling on a flat theme. As a three
dimensional piece of art, "Russia" succeeds mag
nificently; as a play, it fails.
"Russia" plays through March 3 at the Theatre Artaud
in San Francisco.
