# 'Movie Star' imaginative but confusing
## 
### NANCY HENRY 
"A Movie Star has to Star in Black
and White" is an appropriately com
plex title for a complex play. The play
is sponsored by Stanford University
Black Performing Arts and the De
partment of Drama, directed by visit
ing Drama Prof. Camille Howard and
written by Obie Award-winning
playwright Adrienne Kennedy. It is

The first and most
natural question
seems to be, what
is this play actu
ally saying, and
the second, how
might it have been
better said?

an imaginatively conceived and
professionally staged piece. Its suc
cess and potential as a truly outstand
ing or significant piece of theater are,
however, limited. The first and most
natural question seems to be, what is
this play actually saying, and the
second, how might it have been better
said? Certainly, if only to raise these
questions, this short and ultimately
entertaining piece is worth seeing.
Clara is the play's "star," a young
woman who has reacted to a some
what traumatic life by retreating si
multaneously to the world of the
movies and to that of her own work as
a writer. Much of the burden for

holding the scenes together falls on
Janine White. As Clara, she is always
on stage in a role that calls for many
extended and emotional monologues.
White gives a solid performance, but
one lacking in range. She is defiant,
independent and vulnerable, but fails
to create a convincingly romantic and
idealistic character of the kind that
would find coping with reality so dif
ficult to bear. Her relationship to all
the other characters is intentionally
distant and detached. She is obsessed
with her parents and their past, with
her husband and her role as a mother.
Among them, Alma Derricks as the
mother is the only one who seems
more than a prop for Clara's self
exploration and energizes the stage in
several brief but powerful
encounters. The central and most cre
ative aspect of the play is Clara's infu
sion of her own life and speech with
those of the movie stars she idolizes.
Howard's technique of framing the
stage in slides from the movies ("Now
Voyager," "Viva Zapata" and "A
Place in the Sun") is effective, creat
ing the dream-like atmosphere into
which walk the characters from these
films as Clara sees them — beautiful,
romantic and eloquently expressing
all that she would like to say in the
way she would like to say it.
Clara cannot distinguish between
herself, the actors in the movies and
the characters in the play she is so in
tensely writing. She is confused and it
is in this general confusion that the
audience is lost. Too many themes
and symbols are introduced in a very
short time, and it is the most one can
do to grab onto one thread and follow
it through to the end. This does not
ruin the play; it merely makes it am
biguous, a problem the producers
have addressed by bringing cast and
crew out to answer questions after
each performance.
Technically, the play is quite good.

The music deserves special mention
for creating a soft, melancholy,
dreamy ambience. Several
performers take full advantage of
parts that must have been enjoyable
to play. Ashley Quinn as Bette Davis,
Christine Arnold as Jean Peters and

Simone Genatt as Shelly Winters
were impressive and charmingly dra
matic in the grand style of the black
and-white heyday of American
cinema. Eric Wolken, Gary Rosen
berg and Charlie Cosovich were
strong and silent as the respective

male leads. The silence of the men on
the screen is significant when consid
ering that Clara does not want to hear
what the men in her life have to say. In
the movies, she directs and stars.
Things are as she wants them, but her
tragedy lies in life's failure to be so

accommodating. Kennedy, a visiting
professor at UC-Berkeley this year,
attended the opening night's perfor
mance and found it faithful to the
play's original intentions. "Movie
Star" runs again from Wednesday
through Friday in the Nitery.

the characters in the play she is so in
tensely writing. She is confused and it
is in this general confusion that the
audience is lost. Too many themes
and symbols are introduced in a very
short time, and it is the most one can
do to grab onto one thread and follow
it through to the end. This does not
ruin the play; it merely makes it am
biguous, a problem the producers
have addressed by bringing cast and
crew out to answer questions after
each performance.
Technically, the play is quite good.

The music deserves special mention
for creating a soft, melancholy,
dreamy ambience. Several
performers take full advantage of
parts that must have been enjoyable
to play. Ashley Quinn as Bette Davis,
Christine Arnold as Jean Peters and

Simone Genatt as Shelly Winters
were impressive and charmingly dra
matic in the grand style of the black
and-white heyday of American
cinema. Eric Wolken, Gary Rosen
berg and Charlie Cosovich were
strong and silent as the respective

male leads. The silence of the men on
the screen is significant when consid
ering that Clara does not want to hear
what the men in her life have to say. In
the movies, she directs and stars.
Things are as she wants them, but her
tragedy lies in life's failure to be so

accommodating. Kennedy, a visiting
professor at UC-Berkeley this year,
attended the opening night's perfor
mance and found it faithful to the
play's original intentions. "Movie
Star" runs again from Wednesday
through Friday in the Nitery.


Janine White as Clara is confronted by two characters from her favorite
movies, Ashley Quinn as Bette Davis and Gary Rosenberg as Marlon

Brando, in a scene from M A Movie Star has to Star in Black and White,"
