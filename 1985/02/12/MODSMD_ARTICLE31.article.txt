## Goldman Sachs re-interviews 
### JULIE RYAN Editorial staff 
Goldman Sachs Vice President Donald Cornwell re
interviewed approximately 18 students last week in an ef
fort to make amends with students who complained that
they were asked questions about sex, religion, drugs and
abortion by a Goldman Sachs interviewer two weeks ago.
CPPC Director Christopher Shinkman said that the
majority of students eligible to re-interview with the firm
chose to do so. However, he said, about four students
"said they were so dissatisfied that they didn't want any
more to do with them."
Several students who chose not to re-interview received
telephone calls from Cornwell, who reportedly explained
that the questions asked by Werner were unfortunate and
not usual Goldman Sachs policy. *
Cornwell said the second interviews went well. "1 had
some interesting conversations," he said.
The story of Goldman Sachs" problems at Stanford was
picked up by the national*press last week. "I have spoken
to a lot of people from the press," Cornwell said. "It goes
without saying that no one wishes for that kind of
publicity."

Cornwell said the most negative impact of the incident
has been"the real sense of embarrassment and concern
within Goldman Sachs that something like this could hap
pen." He said, "We're probably more worried about this
than anyone else."
Shinkman also said he has spent a lot of time speaking
to the press about the interviews. "It's been hard to get
anything done," he said last week.
Senior Eric Gilbert was one student who chose not to
be re-interviewed. He sent a letter to John Weinberg,
managing partner of Goldman Sachs, saying that he found
the "subsequent handling of the matter inadequate."
Gilbert said the letter offering a second interview from
Shinkman said that Cornwell was "anxious not to
jeopardize Goldman Sachs' relationship with Stanford
University." He said he perceived little concern for the
students.
Gilbert said that the phone call he received from
Cornwell resolved the issue. "I was very pleased that
Donald Cornwell called on Sunday, on his own time. It
was a very concrete indication that Goldman was indeed
concerned about the students and not just their relation
ship with the University."
