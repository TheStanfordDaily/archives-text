# Briefly
## 
### 
Clint, just in from the pow wow,
will not be receiving the extended
play note tomorrow. This will have to
suffice. You were to call a certain
party at least five times.
All staff writers should report to
the commanders and let them know
the plans of the week. Come in and
find one of the interesting story possi
bilities. And no, Bob does not need
any help covering the trustees.
Not much going on at the office this
week, but if you want to know any
thing about what is going on outside
of the office, be sure to ask the unsick
Ops "gossip monger" editor.

Briefly holds up the paper.

Memo, memo, on the wall who's
most pre-professional of them all?
Watch this space for an important
announcement about an imperative,
required appointment Friday after
noon for all staffers.
The bill of Daily rights:
1) There is the bill for the clock going
to the would-be quarterback.
2) There is the bill of the bird eating
the bug for Miss Wann.
3) There are the condolences sent out
to all of the injured souls on ad-side.
Just limp, limp, limp.
4) Cam the scam won't touch Spam.
5) Do, don't go to the CoPo no mo.
6) Prince comes to the Peninsula. The
Daily stands in line for tickets. One
news editor is invited to get a ticket
while the other is offered the chance

of a lifetime — cheap Mexican food
and R. Taeza doesn't live here any
more.
7) This just in. There is an emergency
election to be held today for the rat.
We must have a name so he can play
the game. D-con staff lunch today un
der the enlarger. Short, obnoxious
ex-(so called) photographers are
welcome to attend but should beware
of the other wild animals in The Daily
hot on her trail: the baboons. Be
heuh.
8) Charlie has a bill for each of you.
9) Recently atnmended Day or night
we miss Marina. There is no new first
lady. Would you consider an encore
performance?
10) Mike may go no better than one
for-two on the funny Briefly scale.
