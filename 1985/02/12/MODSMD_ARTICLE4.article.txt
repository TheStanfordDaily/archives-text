The Santa Clara County Planning Commission voted 5-
0 Thursday to approve a permanent location for Stan
ford's Environmental Safety Facility (ESF) near the Stan
ford Golf Course.
ESF will perform the function of various temporary
sites on campus already handling toxic waste. Three dif
ferent types of waste material will be handled at the cen
ter: biological waste from the Stanford Medical Center,
chemical waste from University maintenance and research
labs, and radioactive waste from biological research and
medical treatment. The commission added that the ap
proval is dependent upon the commission's monitoring of
operations and the facility's successful incorporation of
future Environmental Protection Agency standards.
A letter to the commission from Stanford administra
tors said, "The Environmental Safety Facility will allow us
to receive, monitor, treat and prepare materials for ship
ment in a far safer, more economical and effective way
than is now the case.
"We will be dealing with very small volumes of materi
als at very low levels of activity. The average service sta
tion contains far larger amounts of dangerous materials
than we will be processing." The letter was signed by
Alain DeCleve, director of Health and Safety; Roland

Finston, director of Health Physics; and Phil Williams,
Stanford's planning director.
Finston added that the ESF would store "only low-level
radioactive material with a half-life of less than five
years." *
Louis Fein, a resident of the Oak Creek Apartments,
which are situated close to the intended site, has voiced
strong opposition to the decision. Fein said the county has
not approved a land-use plan for the site, and the Univer
sity has not fully defined plans for the use of the ESF.
Future activity may "have a negative impact on the com
munity." He noted that the site was chosen for
its proximity to the medical center but asserted that a bet
ter location would have been near the existing medical
center incinerator so that the old one could be used as a
backup system.
Fein said the approved site poses a "risk of accident."
"Nobody knows what kinds of accidents will come up.
Who is responsible? Not the University. The people in the
vicinity will pay the consequences," Fein said.
He proposed putting ESF in the hills above Stanford to
reduce the potential for accidents.
Finston emphasized the low risk factor of the ESF,
stating that toxic-waste removal would occupy only a
"small fraction of the activity (of the facility)."
