# ASSU committee nixes requests for KZSU, Chappie
## 
### JOYA WESLEY Staff writer 
The Chapparal and KZSU have
not received Senate Appropriation
Committee recommendations for
their special fee assessment requests,
according to a report released Sunday
night.
While the KZSU request is now
being reconsidered, the Chaparral's
case is essentially closed.
The committee also recommended
only partial fee requests for the Axe
Committee, the Band and The Daily.
The committee has delayed action on
Club Sports and SURE because of
technical budget problems and rec
ommended the remaining requests
with "minor or no modifications."
In the wake of the interviews the
committee conducted last week, some
groups are complaining that the com
mittee went beyond its duties in the
questions it asked representatives of
the assessment-seeking groups.
Leaders of the two rejected groups
are especially critical.
Karen Easterbrook, business
manager of the Chapparal, said she
feels her request was rejected be
cause of the personal opinions of
committee members.
"They didn't think we performed a
public service," she said. She went on
to say she feels this reasoning has no
connection with the purpose of the
interviews, which, according to the
ASSU Senate Constitution, are to
"review the estimates and audits of
the organization." Easterbrook said
she has learned from Appropriations
Committee Chair Carey White that
the KZSU request was also rejected
for non-budgetary reasons.
Ted Wheeler, KZSU financial
manager, has similar thoughts on the
matter, but said he understands the
committee's concern.
"Perhaps they went a little bit
beyond the budget with KZSU, but I
think it was necessary because we re
quested so much more money than
last year," he said.
Easterbrook said she is not as
sympathetic with the committee's in
tentions because she was unable to
get an explanation for the Chaparral's
rejection on the basis of specific line
items in the magazine's budget.
"You would be hard pressed to
prove that they (the committee) per
formed a public service," she said.
SURE's Andy Frisch also criticized
the committee's methods.
"They were giving me complaints
about the service and 1 really didn't
think that was their place," he said.
The Chapparal has opted to avoid
further encounters with the senate by
attempting to collect signatures of 20

percent of the student body, the alter
nate procedure for obtaining a place
on the spring ballot.
In response to these accusations,
White expressed a different view of
the committee's purpose and ex
plained that current circumstances af
fected the committee's decisions.
"I think the committee's purpose is
to be sure that money being taxed
from the students goes to the stu
dents," he said.
He went on to explain that the sen
ate has noticed an increase in the
number of students taking refunds
and believes that students are begin
ning to vote for an organization's re
quest solely for the purpose of getting
a refund the following year.
White said he does not think the
committee has the power to deter
mine the fate of an organization be
cause groups always have the option
to go the petition route, as the Chap
paral has decided to do. This option
acts as a check on the committee and
the senate's selections for the ballot,
he said.
Senate Chair Eric Berg elaborated
on White's point, saying that the fact
that the senate places a group on the
ballot shows the senate's endorse
ment. For this reason he thinks the
committee has a right to ask ques
tions beyond the budget.
The committee's reasons for not
recommending the Chapparal cen
tered on the magazine's intention to
eliminate the $1 cover price and to
distribute copies free. This, along
with the fact that the magazine's staff
did not anticipate an increase in ad
vertising revenue as a result of this
move, made the committee unwilling
to recommend funding which it felt
could be obtained elsewhere.
The division of the Axe Commit
tee's, the Band's and The Daily's re
quests will be an important topic of
tonight's senate meeting. The senate
will vote on amendments which
would make it possible for such un
precedented actions to be taken.
The committee wants to divide
these requests because the groups'
budgets contain items that the
committee decided students should
not be asked to pay for or that should
be cited separately.
The Band's budget includes a trip
to Washington that the committee
felt should be listed separately on the
budget. It also included a preseason
trip for the academic year 1986-87
that the committee eliminated com
pletely.
The Daily and Axe Committee re
quests contained "questionable items
" that the committee also eliminated.

could be obtained elsewhere.
The division of the Axe Commit
tee's, the Band's and The Daily's re
quests will be an important topic of
tonight's senate meeting. The senate
will vote on amendments which
would make it possible for such un
precedented actions to be taken.
The committee wants to divide
these requests because the groups'
budgets contain items that the
committee decided students should
not be asked to pay for or that should
be cited separately.
The Band's budget includes a trip
to Washington that the committee
felt should be listed separately on the
budget. It also included a preseason
trip for the academic year 1986-87
that the committee eliminated com
pletely.
The Daily and Axe Committee re
quests contained "questionable items
" that the committee also eliminated.
The Chapparal and KZSU have
not received Senate Appropriation
Committee recommendations for
their special fee assessment requests,
according to a report released Sunday
night.
While the KZSU request is now
being reconsidered, the Chaparral's
case is essentially closed.
The committee also recommended
only partial fee requests for the Axe
Committee, the Band and The Daily.
The committee has delayed action on
Club Sports and SURE because of
technical budget problems and rec
ommended the remaining requests
with "minor or no modifications."
In the wake of the interviews the
committee conducted last week, some
groups are complaining that the com
mittee went beyond its duties in the
questions it asked representatives of
the assessment-seeking groups.
Leaders of the two rejected groups
are especially critical.
Karen Easterbrook, business
manager of the Chapparal, said she
feels her request was rejected be
cause of the personal opinions of
committee members.
"They didn't think we performed a
public service," she said. She went on
to say she feels this reasoning has no
connection with the purpose of the
interviews, which, according to the
ASSU Senate Constitution, are to
"review the estimates and audits of
the organization." Easterbrook said
she has learned from Appropriations
Committee Chair Carey White that
the KZSU request was also rejected
for non-budgetary reasons.
Ted Wheeler, KZSU financial
manager, has similar thoughts on the
matter, but said he understands the
committee's concern.
"Perhaps they went a little bit
beyond the budget with KZSU, but I
think it was necessary because we re
quested so much more money than
last year," he said.
Easterbrook said she is not as
sympathetic with the committee's in
tentions because she was unable to
get an explanation for the Chaparral's
rejection on the basis of specific line
items in the magazine's budget.
"You would be hard pressed to
prove that they (the committee) per
formed a public service," she said.
SURE's Andy Frisch also criticized
the committee's methods.
"They were giving me complaints
about the service and 1 really didn't
think that was their place," he said.
The Chapparal has opted to avoid
further encounters with the senate by
attempting to collect signatures of 20

percent of the student body, the alter
nate procedure for obtaining a place
on the spring ballot.
In response to these accusations,
White expressed a different view of
the committee's purpose and ex
plained that current circumstances af
fected the committee's decisions.
"I think the committee's purpose is
to be sure that money being taxed
from the students goes to the stu
dents," he said.
He went on to explain that the sen
ate has noticed an increase in the
number of students taking refunds
and believes that students are begin
ning to vote for an organization's re
quest solely for the purpose of getting
a refund the following year.
White said he does not think the
committee has the power to deter
mine the fate of an organization be
cause groups always have the option
to go the petition route, as the Chap
paral has decided to do. This option
acts as a check on the committee and
the senate's selections for the ballot,
he said.
Senate Chair Eric Berg elaborated
on White's point, saying that the fact
that the senate places a group on the
ballot shows the senate's endorse
ment. For this reason he thinks the
committee has a right to ask ques
tions beyond the budget.
The committee's reasons for not
recommending the Chapparal cen
tered on the magazine's intention to
eliminate the $1 cover price and to
distribute copies free. This, along
with the fact that the magazine's staff
did not anticipate an increase in ad
vertising revenue as a result of this
move, made the committee unwilling
to recommend funding which it felt
could be obtained elsewhere.
