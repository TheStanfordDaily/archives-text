Occasionally wearing a pair of sunglasses and imitat
ing a slew of Southern accents with obvious relish, poet
novelist James Dickey gave a crowd of about 150 at
Kresge Auditorium last night an informal tour of his
writings "so you can see what I've been doing all these
times."
Most famous for his novel "Deliverance," the burly
and charming South Carolinan spent almost as much
time introducing his poems and stories as reading them.
Dickey, who was sponsored by the ASSU Spe Iter's
Bureau, and who looks like the ex-star halfback he is,
read a section from his novel, a couple short stories and
several poems.
In an interview with The Daily Sunday, Dickey gave
his opinions on a range of subjects with the same wry ir
reverence. He began by talking about the creative
process.
"I just turned 62 on Sunday and never have I felt
more uncertain," he said. "But I am certain about a few
things. I think that when you sit down, you can't let your
critical faculty and your schooling fake you out. When
you sit down to write, sit down and write with careless,
proud indifference. You do that and some voice will
begin to speak through you, one you didn't know was
there."
A professor of English at South Carolina University,
Dickey believes that schooling can be valuable
sometimes, especially creative writing courses. "The col

lege writing class is a writer's first selected audience. It's
pure. The students come with no axes to grind. People
say what they think."
"I work continually," Dickey says. " My whole house
is booby-trapped with typewriters, a novel in one, poetry
in another, some translations in another. And whatever
typewriter I'm near I stop at, and I get involved in that
particular one, and sit there and work with it, then do
something else â€” like go out and shoot some arrows, or
play the guitar, or talk with my little girl until the next
time I am wandering around through the house, when I
say, 'Yeah, this might not be so bad, but it has to be
changed.' "
Dickey, a prolific critic, is notably forthright in his
judgment of other writers. Much of what is printed in the
major poetry journals is just "capok," he claims. Allen
Ginsberg, for example, is "the garbageman of poetry.
Anybody could do that stuff." And James Merrill, who
recently published his ouija board epic, "The Changing
Light of Sandover," "He's a nice little guy, but his
poetry is sugar water. He's an interior decorator, a hurt
nobody's-feelings type." Dickey is just as hard on poets
who try to effect political change with their work: "If a
poet mounts a soapbox, the garbage remains in the
streets."
Dickey prefers the work of D.H. Lawrence because
"he vivifies things, doesn't close them down." Of con
temporary American writers, he admires "the work of a
