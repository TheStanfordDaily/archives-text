# Poet shares works, insights

Occasionally wearing a pair of sunglasses and imitat
ing a slew of Southern accents with obvious relish, poet
novelist James Dickey gave a crowd of about 150 at
Kresge Auditorium last night an informal tour of his
writings "so you can see what I've been doing all these
times."
Most famous for his novel "Deliverance," the burly
and charming South Carolinan spent almost as much
time introducing his poems and stories as reading them.
Dickey, who was sponsored by the ASSU Spe Iter's
Bureau, and who looks like the ex-star halfback he is,
read a section from his novel, a couple short stories and
several poems.
In an interview with The Daily Sunday, Dickey gave
his opinions on a range of subjects with the same wry ir
reverence. He began by talking about the creative
process.
"I just turned 62 on Sunday and never have I felt
more uncertain," he said. "But I am certain about a few
things. I think that when you sit down, you can't let your
critical faculty and your schooling fake you out. When
you sit down to write, sit down and write with careless,
proud indifference. You do that and some voice will
begin to speak through you, one you didn't know was
there."
A professor of English at South Carolina University,
Dickey believes that schooling can be valuable
sometimes, especially creative writing courses. "The col

lege writing class is a writer's first selected audience. It's
pure. The students come with no axes to grind. People
say what they think."
"I work continually," Dickey says. " My whole house
is booby-trapped with typewriters, a novel in one, poetry
in another, some translations in another. And whatever
typewriter I'm near I stop at, and I get involved in that
particular one, and sit there and work with it, then do
something else — like go out and shoot some arrows, or
play the guitar, or talk with my little girl until the next
time I am wandering around through the house, when I
say, 'Yeah, this might not be so bad, but it has to be
changed.' "
Dickey, a prolific critic, is notably forthright in his
judgment of other writers. Much of what is printed in the
major poetry journals is just "capok," he claims. Allen
Ginsberg, for example, is "the garbageman of poetry.
Anybody could do that stuff." And James Merrill, who
recently published his ouija board epic, "The Changing
Light of Sandover," "He's a nice little guy, but his
poetry is sugar water. He's an interior decorator, a hurt
nobody's-feelings type." Dickey is just as hard on poets
who try to effect political change with their work: "If a
poet mounts a soapbox, the garbage remains in the
streets."
Dickey prefers the work of D.H. Lawrence because
"he vivifies things, doesn't close them down." Of con
temporary American writers, he admires "the work of a

poet like James Wright, with his
sense of the doom of the natural
world, the closing down of exis
tence, the ultimate destruction of
the planet. His poetry is poignant
because it applies to all of us —
which is the opposite of what
Robert Lowell's work does.
"Lowell is saying essentially to
the reader, Now look, I am an ex
traordinary personality and a won
derful poet, and everybody knows
it, so you've got to pay attention to
everything that pertains to me,
everything, my family, my sexual
problems, my wrestling with my
conscience about religion, because
everything about me, Robert
Lowell, matters greatly, and if you
don't think so, just read my work,
and I will tell you how important
my doings are, my life, where I live,
the street where I used to live, my
mama, my father, everything.' "
"I like a poet like (Theodore)
Roethke much better. He says, 'If
you have heard wind, I can tell you
something about wind. I'm giving
the wind to you, too.' Roethke
opens the world out to you.
"The human poet says what God
didn't get around to saying. And
there's a lot that God left unsaid.
So the human poet has got carte
blanche to say it his way. He can
change it and interpret it, shade it,
patch it and make it according to
what his interpretation is. This is
the great thing, why there will al
ways be poets. Because humanity
needs this, they need a multiplicity

of approaches to their own experi
ence, an infinitude of interpreta
tions of experience, none of which
is ultimate, all of which are
revisable. How many people have
written about the sea? But who has
ever said the definitive word on the
sea? There's not any. The sea itself
is not the definitive word on the
sea.
"We go there and we are under
the fond illusion that we can say the
ultimate thing about it. It is a neces

sary illusion. It is important to us.
What we say may change some
body's angle of vision. La mer, la
mer toujour est commence. That's
the French poet, Valery. The sea is
always begun again. No ending, no
beginning. Always starting over.
"I think that is a super line."
The ASSU will present
playwright Edward Albee, author
of "Who's Afraid of Virginia
Woolf," next Tuesday at Kresge
Auditorium.

James Dickey reads from his works in a presentation at Kresge
Auditorium last night.
Occasionally wearing a pair of sunglasses and imitat
ing a slew of Southern accents with obvious relish, poet
novelist James Dickey gave a crowd of about 150 at
Kresge Auditorium last night an informal tour of his
writings "so you can see what I've been doing all these
times."
Most famous for his novel "Deliverance," the burly
and charming South Carolinan spent almost as much
time introducing his poems and stories as reading them.
Dickey, who was sponsored by the ASSU Spe Iter's
Bureau, and who looks like the ex-star halfback he is,
read a section from his novel, a couple short stories and
several poems.
In an interview with The Daily Sunday, Dickey gave
his opinions on a range of subjects with the same wry ir
reverence. He began by talking about the creative
process.
"I just turned 62 on Sunday and never have I felt
more uncertain," he said. "But I am certain about a few
things. I think that when you sit down, you can't let your
critical faculty and your schooling fake you out. When
you sit down to write, sit down and write with careless,
proud indifference. You do that and some voice will
begin to speak through you, one you didn't know was
there."
A professor of English at South Carolina University,
Dickey believes that schooling can be valuable
sometimes, especially creative writing courses. "The col

lege writing class is a writer's first selected audience. It's
pure. The students come with no axes to grind. People
say what they think."
"I work continually," Dickey says. " My whole house
is booby-trapped with typewriters, a novel in one, poetry
in another, some translations in another. And whatever
typewriter I'm near I stop at, and I get involved in that
particular one, and sit there and work with it, then do
something else — like go out and shoot some arrows, or
play the guitar, or talk with my little girl until the next
time I am wandering around through the house, when I
say, 'Yeah, this might not be so bad, but it has to be
changed.' "
Dickey, a prolific critic, is notably forthright in his
judgment of other writers. Much of what is printed in the
major poetry journals is just "capok," he claims. Allen
Ginsberg, for example, is "the garbageman of poetry.
Anybody could do that stuff." And James Merrill, who
recently published his ouija board epic, "The Changing
Light of Sandover," "He's a nice little guy, but his
poetry is sugar water. He's an interior decorator, a hurt
nobody's-feelings type." Dickey is just as hard on poets
who try to effect political change with their work: "If a
poet mounts a soapbox, the garbage remains in the
streets."
Dickey prefers the work of D.H. Lawrence because
"he vivifies things, doesn't close them down." Of con
temporary American writers, he admires "the work of a

poet like James Wright, with his
sense of the doom of the natural
world, the closing down of exis
tence, the ultimate destruction of
the planet. His poetry is poignant
because it applies to all of us —
which is the opposite of what
Robert Lowell's work does.
"Lowell is saying essentially to
the reader, Now look, I am an ex
traordinary personality and a won
derful poet, and everybody knows
it, so you've got to pay attention to
everything that pertains to me,
everything, my family, my sexual
problems, my wrestling with my
conscience about religion, because
everything about me, Robert
Lowell, matters greatly, and if you
don't think so, just read my work,
and I will tell you how important
my doings are, my life, where I live,
