Glemp attacks Polish government
WARSAW — In a development reflecting growing tension
within Poland's important church-state relationship, the country's
Roman Catholic primate. Cardinal Jozef Glemp, yesterday accused the
communist government of directing a propaganda campaign against the
church.
Glemp also rejected charges by Polish leader Gen. Wojciech
Jaruzelski that dissident priests were violating Polish law in speaking out
against government repression.
"I understand the attitude of some priests is not liked at all but I can
not agree that it is a violation of the law," Glemp said.
At a 35-minute news conference in a large office at his official
residence, the normally cautious, publicity-shy primate personally
defended the actions of the slain dissident priest Father Jerzy
Popieluszko, murdered last October by three Polish secret police offi
cers.
The latter stages of an unprecedented open trial of the officers and a
superior who directed them was used by the government to launch
repeated attacks against the Roman Catholic Church and activist priests,
including Popieluszko.
- Glemp accused the government yesterday of turning the proceedings
into an attempt to try Popieluszko and the church in order to serve its
own propaganda goals.
The primate's remarks against the government were less aggressive
than language he has used in two recent sermons and they appeared to
be packaged more as a defensive answer to the recent government cam
paign than an aggressive counterattack. But his decision to address them
to Western reporters was viewed as a barometer of how serious he
viewed the government's charges.
Shultz dismisses Korean scuffle
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State George Shultz said yesterday
that a misunderstanding led to a scuffle between police and exiled South
Korean dissident leader Kim Dae Jung's party when he arrived at the
Seoul airport last week, but administration officials refused to Say
whether they agree with the U.S. ambassador's assertion that American
rights activists accompanying Kim may have provoked the incident.
"Things didn't go according to the agreements that we thought we had
worked out for (Kim's) arrival," Shultz said on NBCs "Today" show.
"The traveling party didn't go as was described and the Korean govern
ment didn't react the way we thought they might have, so there was
some misunderstanding, and it led to this scuffle."
However, Shultz sidestepped the issue of whether he agrees with Am
bassador Richard Walker's comments to reporters Sunday. Walker con
demned the Korean use of force but also said that the action of
prominent Americans in linking arms with Kim "appeared to be a
purposeful provocation''' against police. The Americans who traveled
with Kim have rejected the charge as "absolutely false."
The administration was embarrassed badly by the incident in which
the Americans, including two members of Congress, said they were
beaten, kicked and knocked down. But Shultz's comments also made
clear that the administration, which regards South Korea as an impor
tant ally, does not intend to abandon its policy of trying to bring about an
easing of Korean political repression through quiet diplomacy.
U.S. invites 'Star Wars' partners
GIESSEN, West Germany — Secretary of Defense Caspar
Weinberger invited European nations yesterday to join in the U.S. "Star
Wars" defense system and said Washington would soon provide fuller
details of the'plan.
Weinberger, in Giessen for a visit with U.S. troops and for talks with
West German Defense Minister Manfred Woerner, said at a news con
ference that work on space-based defenses were still in the earliest
stages of planning.
Woerner said at the same press conference that West Germany and
other European countries would be willing to take part in "Star Wars"
only if the United States liberalized its stiff technology-export restric
tions.
"There will be no secrets if we cooperate," said Woerner, who pointed
out that Chancellor Helmut Kohl recently reserved a decision on West
German participation until Washington had briefed Bonn in detail on
the project.
Both Weinberger and Woerner expressed strong disapproval of the
popular use of the "Star Wars" label. The system is formally called the
Strategic Defense Initiative. They said the system does not represent a
scheme to mount wars of conquest from outer space. The initiative is
purely defensive in nature and has as its goal the abolition of nuclear
weapons, they said.
Weinberger added that the United States would not make cost-related
cuts in the number of its troops in Western Europe to help finance the
defense system as has been feared by some European politicians.
Rising dollar breaks 10 francs
PARIS — The dollar burst through the symbolic barrier of 10 French
francs yesterday amid growing concern in Western Europe over continu
ing high U.S. interest rates and huge budget deficits.
The U.S. currency's renewed surge against key European currencies
came as good news for American tourists abroad and European export
ers to the United States but bad news for central banks struggling to
restore some order to the world economy. There is a widespread percep
tion in Europe that the dollar is overvalued but little agreement on when
it might begin to come down.
The concern felt in other industrialized countries at the dollar's un
controlled rise was reflected in a speech less than two weeks ago by the
newly appointed secretary general of the Paris-based Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development, Jean-Claude Paye, in which
he criticized U.S. budgetary policy.
"The dollar exchange rate is considered almost unanimously to be
clearly overvalued, which in turn dangerously increases protectionist
pressures and gives rise to fears that the dollar could at any moment
begin an excessive and hard-to-control decline," Paye told the par
liamentary assembly of the Council of Europe in his first major speech.
In addition to reaching a record level against the French franc, up 150
percent from 4 francs tp the dollar in 1980, the dollar is also at a 13-year
high against the West German mark. It has also made spectacular prog
ress against the British pound, leading currency dealers in Britain to
speculate about a $1 pound within the next few months.
The fluctuations in the U.S. currency are likely to become a subject of
political talks between U.S. and European leaders in a series of meetings
during the next few months. Last month, according to French officials,
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher took the unusual step of ap
pealing personally to President Reagan for the world's leading industria
lized countries to take joint action to halt the dollar's rise.
Israel bombs alleged guerrilla base
TEL AVIV, Israel — Israeli warplanes raided Syrian-controlled eas
tern Lebanon for the second time in less than 24 hours yesterday, bomb
ing an alleged Palestinian guerrilla base near Chtura in the Bekaa valley,
a military representative said here.
An Israeli army spokesman said the pilots scored direct hits on a
building outside the village of Taalabye, located some 22 miles east of
Beirut. The structure was used by guerrillas of rebel Fatah leader
Col.Abu Moussa. he said.
The attack followed a similar raid Sunday against a house outside an
other Chtura-arca village, Kahaladye, which Israel claimed was a
headquarters of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
The raid, the first of its type in a month, was in retaliation for attacks on
Israeli soldiers in south Lebanon.
In Damascus. Syria, yesterday, the Democratic Front, headed by
Nayef Hawatmeh, issued a communique saying that yesterday"the Is
raeli enemy air force has for the second time bombarded the area of
Taalbaya and Taanayel, which is heavily populated with civilians, using
napalm bombs.
"This led to heavy human losses among the civilians, including women
and children," it added.
