WASHINGTON â€” President Reagar. called on
Saudi Arabian King Fahd yesterday to use his in
fluence "as a leading Arab statesman" to convince
Jordan and possibly other Arab states to open
direct peace talks with Israel.
Fahd, beginning his first official visit to Washing
ton since ascending to the throne in June 1982,
responded by urging the United States to resume
its role as Middle East mediator and to throw its
support behind "the just cause of the Palestinian
people."
The president and the monarch both used the
word "tragedy" to describe the Arab-Israeli con
flict and the Palestinian problem but each sugges
ted that the other take the political risks entailed in
seeking a settlement.
Although neither Reagan nor Fahd bluntly said
so in public, it was clear that the Saudi leader wants

the United States to pressure Israel to make
concessions while the president wants the Saudis to
wring concessions from the Arabs.
"Together, our considerable influence and our
moral suasion can, at the very least, decrease the
threat of war," Reagan said during a formal 21 -gun
salute to welcome Fahd on the White House lawn.
"If the Saudi and American governments focus
their energies, progress can be made, especially in
the lingering dispute between Israel and her neigh
bors."
But a senior administration official said later that
Reagan made it clear Saudi Arabia must take the
first step in bringing about such a partnership by
convincing some Arab party to negotiate with Is
rael.
The official, who briefed reporters with the un-
would not be identified by name.

said that direct U.S. involvement in the peace
process would come "when there are direct
negotiations with an Arab interlocutor at the
table."
About the time Reagan and Fahd sat down for
private meetings at the White House, news
agencies reported from Amman that Jordan's King
Hussein and Palestine Liberation Organization
leader Yasser Arafat had reached agreement on a
framework for a joint effort to solve the Palestinian
issue. The reports contained no details and did not
indicate whether Hussein would be prepared to
negotiate directly with the Israelis.
The U.S. official said he was aware of the reports
but did not know whether they constituted a
breakthrough. ' The major break would come the
day that Jordan is able to announce its readiness to
move into direct negotiations," he said.
