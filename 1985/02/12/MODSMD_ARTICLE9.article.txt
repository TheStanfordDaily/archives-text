# Bennett calls loans luxuries

### 
WASHINGTON — Secretary of
Education William Bennett, defend
ing the administration's proposal to
curb federal loan guarantees for col
lege students, said yesterday that in
some cases the cuts would simply
force students to "divest" themselves
of their stereos, automobiles and time
at the beach.
Bennett also said that cutbacks to
the federal loan programs would hit
not students but bankers "most im
mediately and hardest" because they
would lose interest payments.
Bennett made his comments during
his first news conference as secretary
— a wide-ranging session in which he
outlined his vision of American edu
cation. He vowed to work actively to
promote President Reagan's budget

proposals in Congress. Reagan's new
budget calls for denying student loan
guarantees to students from families
with adjusted gross incomes above
$32,500 per year.
Though Bennett defended the
proposals, one of his senior assistants
said during the news conference that
the administration would be "willing
to negotiate" on the scope of the cuts,
reflecting awareness that Congress
may be reluctant to curtail a program
popular with middle-class taxpayers.
The comment was made by Gary
Bauer, undersecretary for planning,
budget and evaluation, who added
after the news conference that
Congress might suggest "a few modi
fications" to the administration pro
no«a' "Wp send these budgets up,

and we're always willing to have a
give-and-take with Congress on the
details," Bauer said.
In addition to the $32,500 annual
income ceiling for loan guarantees,
the administration has asked
Congress to deny grants, work-study
or direct loans to any student whose
family's adjusted gross income
exceeded $25,000, and to make
$4,000 the most federal aid that a
student could qualify for in a year.
Bennett said that students, parents
and college administrators have been
"way out of line" in expressing oppo
sition to the administration's
proposals, which would eliminate
about 1 million students from federal
college-aid programs.

The new secretary said that the
Reagan administration's aim was to
provide for "the neediest group first"
and to fight the federal deficit. He
conceded that, if the proposals are
passed, some families with more than
one student in college would "have to
tighten their belts even further."
For others, however, the measures
would mean only that certain luxuries
would have to be cut out, he said.
It would be "divestiture of certain
sorts: stereo divestiture, automobile
divestiture, three-weeks-at-the
beach divestiture," Bennett said,
"I do not mean to suggest this will
be the case in all circumstances," said
the former professor of philosophy,
"but it will, like the rain, fall on the
just and unjust alike."
