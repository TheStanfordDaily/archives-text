CBS libel case continues
NEW YORK — The Army officer responsible
for estimating enemy strength in the months
preceding the Vietnam wars 1968 Tet offensive
said yesterday he personally "skimmed" figures
and issued orders producing official estimates
that were "ridiculously low" and nothing more
than "crap."
Testifying before a federal jury hearing Gen.
William Westmoreland's $120 million libel suit
against CBS, retired Col. Gains Hawkins said he
acted on the orders of superiors who told him
that his own reports of increased enemy strength
were "unacceptable."
Hawkins' appearance on the witness stand had
been long expected. His interview in the CBS
documentary, "The Uncounted Enemy: A Viet
nam Deception," was a centerpiece in the broad
cast's contention that Westmoreland deceived
President Lyndon Johnson with doctored enemy
strength estimates. Westmoreland contends that
CBS distorted an honest disagreement among in
telligence analysts to make it appear he had
knowingly misled his superiors.
Under oath, Hawkins told the same story that
he had related in the 1982 documentary about
Westmoreland's reaction in May 1967 when he
was told that new estimates of enemy strength
were sharply higher.
Of his role, he told the jury, "I carried out the
orders as a loyal officer of the U.S. Army. ..."
Nerve gas debated
WASHINGTON — The Reagan administra
tion, rebuffed in its previous attempts to begin
producing nerve gas, is opening what one defense
budget expert predicted would be "a full-court
press" to persuade Congress to let it rebuild the
nation's stockpile of the highly toxic weapon.
The Pentagon is seeking a $ 1 -4-billion chemi
cal warfare budget next year, up from the ap

proximately $1 billion it is receiving this year un
der provisions that exclude actual production of
nerve gas.
No new chemical weapons have been author
ized since 1969, and the military wants to replace
aging, dangerous stocks with new "binary" weap
ons that could be kept harmless until combined
automatically in a shell or bomb just before
reaching a target.
Despite defeat in Congress last May, the ad
ministration is seeking $207 million for research
on modern chemical weapons, purchase of pro
duction equipment, construction of a production
site and purchase of chemicals, shells and bombs.
Last year, it unsuccessfully sought $136 million
for similar efforts.
Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger and
Gen. John Vessey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, have begun trying to gain congressional
support for their controversial proposal, and a
Pentagon official said he expects Sen. Barry
Goldwater (R-Ariz.), the new chairman of the
Senate Armed Services Committee, to pursue the
funding.
But supporters of the plan concede that,
despite the departures from Congress of two
leading opponents of chemical weapons —
former Rep. Ed Bethune (R-Ark.) and former
Sen. Paul Tsongas (D-Mass.) — they face an up
hill fight.
A Pentagon official said that "well over 15
countries" have the capacity to use nerve gas
weapons. The precise number is classified, he
said.
"If I were out there on the battlefield, I'd be
facing what I consider an unacceptable risk," an
other Pentagon official said, referring to the pos
sible use of nerve gas by the Soviet Union.
'Star Wars' at Geneva
WASHINGTON — President Reagan will
place his so-called "Star Wars" missile defense

research program on the negotiating table at
Geneva for "discussion and explanation" but not
as a "bargaining chip," his chief spokesman made
plain yesterday.
Reagan's controversial $26 billion program,
officially known as the Strategic Defense Initia
tive, was declared non-negotiable by White
House spokesman Larry Speakes, who expanded
on remarks Reagan made in an interview pub
lished yesterday.
In the interview with The New York Times,
Reagan announced that even if an agreement to
eliminate nuclear weapons were reached with the
Soviet Union, the United States would still
proceed with research into a space-based, non
nuclear defense system.
A knowledgeable White House official, speak
ing on condition he not be identified, said yester
day that the president had previously been
"careful" not to spell out his "hands-off Star
Wars" position so explicitly for fear that it might
give the Soviets an excuse to boycott new arms
talks, set to begin March 12 in Geneva.
But the official said that Reagan's motivation
during the interview Monday was to "make it
very clear to everybody what the situation is.
There's no reason for anybody now to be
confused; there's no excuse for the Soviets to
walk out."
Besides, he said," We've talked it through with
the Soviets. They know what we're doing." He
added that Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko agreed with Secretary of State George
Shultz at their meeting in Geneva last month that
any negotiated ban on research is impossible to
verify.
Market climbs slightly
NEW YORK — The stock market posted a
tiny gain yesterday, rebounding from an early
price decline but unable to mount a serious re
sumption of its early 1985 bullish tack.
