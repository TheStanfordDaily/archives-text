Lottery act altered
SACRAMENTO — A Senate committee yes
terday approved legislation to relax vojter
adopted protection against corrupt lottery sup
pliers out of fear that the rules assure Atlanta
based Scientific Games a big contract.
One member of the Senate Governmental Or
ganization Committee was openly nervous about
altering the strict corporate financial disclosures
required of potential suppliers by the lottery act,
a constitutional amendment approved at the polls
on Nov. 6.
"It amazes me, frankly, how we can tamper
with it to that extent," said Sen. Robert Beverly
(R-Manhattan Beach).

The panel voted 8-0 to send 5835, by Sen.
Ralph Dills (D-Gardena), to the Senate Appro
priations Committee. The decision came after
Dills, the committee's chairman, said a legislative
counsel's opinion had declared the measure in
keeping with the lottery act's intentions.
The action marked the first movement of a
dozen lottery follow-up bills, intended to refine
the act or repair what are seen as flaws.
5835 was spawned two months ago by lottery
supply industry claims that Scientific Games is
the only corporation that could meet the strict
financial disclosures required of potential bid
ders.
Scientific Games, the nation's largest lottery
ticket supplier, helped write the lottery act before

financing the $2.12 million campaign for its
adoption.
The act requires officers, directors and stock
holders of the parent company of a potential lot
tery supplier to submit income tax returns to the
state. •
Several companies, saying that Scientific
Games already has the material ready, com
plained that their businesses would have diffi
culty meeting the requirements.
Today's weather
I oday will be mostly sunny. Highs in the 60s to
mid 70s. Light winds. Tonight clear. Lows in the
40s.
