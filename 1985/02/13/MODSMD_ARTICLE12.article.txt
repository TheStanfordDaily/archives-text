## Stanford researchers receive NIH grant Scientists help deaf to hear with artificial ear 
### PATRICK LIN Editorial staff 
I wo Stanford researchers have
been awarded a special $1.8 million
grant by the National Institute of
Health to continue development of
an artificial ear which may one day
enable the profoundly deaf to hear
and understand normal speech.
In January, F. Blair Simmons, a
professor of surgery at Stanford
Medical School, and Robert White,
chairman of the Electrical Engineer
ing Department, shared the special
grant, one of a small number of such
grants funded by Congress through
the NIH.
I he human ear is essentially a
transducer, changing sound waves in
the air to nerve impulses that are
carried in the auditory nerve to the
brain. In principle, if the auditory
nerve is intact in a deaf person, one
could inject electrical current directly
into the nerve and bypass the ear.
The basic idea behind the artificial
ear, known as a "cochlear pros
thesis," is simply to implant
electrodes inside the ear and electri
cally stimulate the auditory nerve.
Such an idea is not new. The idea
goes back to 1796, when Volta,
the inventor of the battery, put
electrodes into his ears and shocked
himself, Simmons said.
However, serious development of a
cochlear prosthesis for the deaf did
not begin until the 19605. Simmons,
then a resident at Stanford Hospital,
became intrigued with the possibility
of constructing a cochlear prosthesis.
In 1964, Simmons succeeded in im
planting a prototype six-channel
device in the inner ear of a deaf per
son. The device not only enabled the
subject to experience the sensation of

hearing noise but also enabled him to
discriminate among different pitches.
Simmons said he did the experi
ment "to see if it could be done." The
results were very encouraging because
they implied that it was possible to
recreate meaningful sounds in a deaf
person. However, in spite of the
promising results, scientists did not
respond favorably to his work, he
said. The results were just "too far
out.
"I needed badly to get my results
verified by someone, but the majority
of people didn't want to touch it with
a 10-foot pole," Simmons recalled.
Not only were people skeptical, he
said, but they also did not like the
idea of "human experimentation and
putting electricity in people's brains."

Thus, it was initially difficult to
recruit technical help, Simmons said.
It was not until the early 1970s that
Simmons began his collaboration
with White and the Electrical Engi
neering Department. White became
interested in the cochlear prosthesis
during his sabbatical at Oxford in
1969.
"I wanted to do something differ
ent," said White, whose field of ex
pertise was originally in magnetic
resonance spectroscopy of solids. "I
always had a hobby in neurophysiol
ogy, and I began reading about visual
prostheses at Oxford," he said. "I
then read about protheses for the ear,
and I decided that it was do-able."
Shortly after returning to Stanford,
White started working with Simmons.

Since then, they have
developed several models of cochlear
prostheses. Currently, they are
working on a fourth-generation
model, which is distinguished by its
advanced electronics and a flexible
bundle of eight electrodes. The
bundle of electrodes is special in that
it can be surgically threaded into the
cochlea, or inner ear.
Simmons and White's latest
cochlear prosthesis picks up sound by
a microphone, which changes the
sound into electrical impulses. A
"signal processor," essentially a com
puter, analyzes the impulses and
decides what sort of electrical pulses
should be delivered to the implanted
electrodes.
Commands are then sent by the

signal processor to a "receiver
stimulator," a small implanted device
which drives the electrodes in the
cochlea. When the electrodes are
driven, nerve pulses are generated in
the auditory nerve, and the brain in
terprets this as sound.
Although the cochlear prothesis
cannot exactly reproduce hearing, it
has achieved something remarkable.
It has enabled a deaf person to hear
and understand spoken words. This is
the primary objective of Simmons
and White's device.
So far, two people have been
implanted with Simmons and White's
cochlear prosthesis. Both are "post
lingually deaf." In other words, both
lost their hearing after they had ac
quired spoken language. With the aid
of the prosthesis, both are able to
comprehend speech with a fairly im
pressive level of accuracy. Unfortun
ately for the two subjects, use of the
cochlear prosthesis currently is lim
ited to the laboratory.
In order to appreciate the difficul
ties involved with constructing a
cochlear prosthesis, one must con
sider the anatomy of the human ear.
The key part of the ear is the cochlea,
or inner ear. It is essentially a long,
fluid-filled tube which is coiled up in
a spiral somewhat resembling a snail's
shell. The cochlea is lined with hair
cells, which sense sound by the vibra
tions in the fluid environment.
Simmons estimates that there are
approximately 30,000 hair cells in the
human cochlea, each responding to a
slightly different frequency. The hair
cells are lined up in such a way that
high-frequency, or high-pitched,
sounds are sensed near the base of
the cochlea while low frequency
sounds are picked up near the apex of

the structure.
A fascinating aspect of Simmons'
and White's prosthesis is that it
employs only eight electrodes to stim
ulate the 30,000 hair cells. Initially,
this might lead one to think that the
prosthesis would give at best a crude
reconstruction of the auditory envi
ronment. However, this is not true at
all.
The classical view that hearing
merely consists of one hair cell res
ponding to one frequency is over
simplified. Simmons and White's re
search has helped demonstrate that
hearing depends not only on which
hair cells are excited hut also on com
plex patterns of firing in the nerve
fibers. As White put it, "I think it's
safe to say that we know a lot less
about the ear today than we did five
years ago."
According to White, the solution to
a better cochlear prosthesis is not
necessarily more electrodes. "We're
not getting as much out of eight
electrodes as we should," White says.
Because of the complicated
neurophysiology of hearing, many
strategies are being tried for exciting
the auditory nerve. These strategies
can be divided into two basic types of
schemes, according to White.
The simpler scheme relies on the
nervous system to sort out raw infor
mation. Sound is broken up into eight
bands of frequencies and the eight
electrodes are stimulated accordingly.
For example, if a noise is high
pitched, then the electrode in contact
with the high-pitched region of the
cochlea is stimulated.
The more complex scheme involves
extensive analysis of sound by the

signal processor. Speech, in particu
lar, is analyzed for "formants," which
can be thought of as building blocks
of spoken words. The signal
processor can be programmed to try
to recognize formants in speech. The
implanted electrodes are then stim
ulated in patterns that could help the
subject perceive the formants.
formants.
Simmons and White have tried
both strategies for stimulating the au
ditory nerve. According to White,
both seem to work equally well at the
present time in terms of verbal com
prehension. Further experimentation
is needed to determine which scheme
holds the greater potential.
Simmons believes that one reason
for the cochlear prosthesis' success is
that because "there is so much redun
dancy of information in speech," one
can "chop out a lot of information
and still get intelligible speech." A
good demonstration of this is the tele
phone, said Simmons. The telephone
uses only a small portion of the audi
tory information in speech, but
people have no trouble communicat
ing over the phone.
Although the cochlear prosthesis
has been highly successful, a number
of technical problems still exist. Per
haps most notable among them is the
design of the implanted electrodes.
Currently, Simmons and White use a
bundle of eight individually insulated
platinum wires. Making such
electrodes has proven very difficult
and painstaking.
Simmons and White are attempting
to apply semi-conductor technology
to the construction of their electrode.
However, most of the substrates for
semi-conductor chips — such as
silicon — are not flexible and cannot
be threaded into the cochlea. Cur
rently, Simmons and White are ex
perimenting with a flexible polyimide
substrate onto which to etch their
electrodes.
If technical problems can be
solved, the cochlear prosthesis has
the potential for helping a great num
ber of people. Whether a particular
individual can benefit depends on the

kind of deafness from which he suf
fers.
Deafness resulting from mechani
cal disruption of the eardrum or the
middle ear can usually be repaired
simply by surgery, said Simmons.
Deafness resulting from a failure of
the hair cells in the cochlea may be
treatable with the cochlea!* implant.
Simmons estimates that there may be
as many as 200,000 Americans suf
fering from this kind of deafness.
Deafness resulting from a severed
auditory nerve, however, would not
be treatable with either surgery or the
cochlear, prosthesis.
While the artificial ear may help
many people, Simmons warns against
an overly optimistic outlook for the

device. From experience, he
believes that people will vary in terms
of how well the device works for
them. "Some people do amazingly
well and some do terribly," he said.
This variation, he said, may reflect
how much hidden damage is done to
an individual's auditory nerve.
The cochlear prosthesis may also
prove to be inapplicable for people
born deaf. According to Simmons,
approximately half of the 200,000
people do indeed have congenital deaf
ness. Whether cochlear implants are
given to infants is an important ethical
issue to be addressed in the future.
