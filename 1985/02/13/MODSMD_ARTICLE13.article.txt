Now listen up, Nelson, 'cause I'm just gonna
run through this once. I want you in motion when
Cuomo starts the "Winners and Losers" part of
his speech. The second he's done, you break. 1
want a quick down-and-out pattern — nothing
fancy. Your diploma will be there when you turn.
The cheering's gonna drown out audibles, so this
is the play we'll go with, no matter what. Under
stand?
Yeah, but this is the final play, coach. We can't
take a chance on blowing this one. Perhaps we
should -
1 think I know what's best for the last play of
your college career, Nelson. My mind's made up,
so don't even think of wasting my time with an
argument.
My gown, though ... It's long. ... I'm bound
to trip running the pattern.
Chop your steps, Nelson. Get your knees up.
Make your cut sharp. I want you to get the di
ploma at the 40-yard line. If you don't get into
the Poli Sci zone, kiss the play goodbye. Now
Shapiro, if you get the call, you're looking at a
five-yard run from the line of scrimmage. The

Chem Department's gonna be on the sidelines at
the 20. Look for a pitchout on the right and run
wide. Make sure you get out of bounds at the
marker. Any questions?
Yeah, coach. I have 11 relatives and friends
who want to see me graduate. Can I get them tick
ets?
Tell you what, Shapiro. Section C is empty as
of now. It ought to be large enough; we'll reserve
it for you. But make sure everyone you invite un
derstands that it'll be illegal and dangerous to
rush onto the field afterwards. You tell them to
dress nice, come watch, enjoy themselves and
exit in an orderly manner. Understand?
Yeah, coach. Will the Band be allowed to put
on one of its normal shows?
Of course. Why should graduation be a special
Occasion? You're making too big a deal out of
this. Just trust me and do what I tell you. I
wouldn't be in a position to make the important
decisions if I weren't qualified to make them.
Everything will go fine. For God's sake, though,
Nelson, when you get your diploma, don't spike
it.
