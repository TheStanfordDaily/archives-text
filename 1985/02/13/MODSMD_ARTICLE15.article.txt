## Remember what the PLO wants forgotten 
### 
Public notions of the Arab-Israeli conflict are
too often marred by disinformation and polemi
cal propaganda. John Rosenblum's Feb. 6 view
point, "Oppressing Palestinians," exemplifies
this most unfortunate phenomenon.
PLO supporters, like Rosenblum, would have
us forget the innumerable atrocities committed
by the PLO in recent years. In Israel, brutal acts
such as the 1983 attack on a Jerusalem bus
which wounded dozens and killed two young
girls, countless bombings of supermarkets,
hijackings, murders ... the list goes on. The
PLO has not been restricted to the Middle East.
Its bloodstained hands extend into Europe:
murdering 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972
Munich Olympics, bombing synagogues in Paris
and Rome, killing customers at a Jewish restau-

VIEWPOINT

rant in Paris . .. again, the list goes on.
They would also like us to forget the openly
declared aim of the PLO to liquidate the state of
Jfcrael, negating the right of Jewish people to
Ijave a homeland. The PLO rejects the only suc
cessful first step to Middle East peace, the 1979
Camp David Accords; it rejects not only the
Begin plan for implementing Palestinian
autonomy, but also the Sadat plan. In fact, the
PLO dismisses any peace plan which
presupposes the recognition of Israel. PLO
leaders, including Yasser Arafat, not only
denounced the Camp David Accords, but
labeled Sadat a traitor, openly advocated his as
sassination and rejoiced when Muslim fun
damentalist fanatics gunned him down.
Anwar Sadat has not been the only Arab
subjected to the wrath of the PLO. John
Rosenblum fails to mention that terrorism
which the PLO regards as its essential strategy is
aimed not only at Jews but also at those Pales
tinians unwilling to toe the PLO line. PLO ter
rorists assassinated moderate Palestinian
leaders such as businessman Abd al-Nur Janho
(February 1978), religious leader Sheikh Has
hem Khuzendar (June 1979) and West Bank
village head Yusef Al-Khatib (November
1981). This is but a fraction of some 30 other
Palestinians slain between 1979 and 1981
whose sole "crime" was their support of Sadat's
pqace initiative.
â€¢John Rosenblum begins his article piously
declaring his recognition of Prof. Menahem
Milson's right to speak, but then expresses his
displeasure at his being invited to speak here.
Obviously Rosenblum's notion of freedom of
speech concurs with that of the organization he
so admires, the PLO.

Within the PLO, freedom of opinion is not
tolerated. Rosenblum misrepresents the PLO as
a democratic organization, "controlled by a na
tional council and executive committee made up
of representative leaders." The PLO's National
Council has never been elected by the Palestin
ian people, and the PLO is not a democratic
body. Rather, it controls the Palestinian politi
cal scene with guns and patronage money. They
represent the interests of the wealthy Arab
countries that back them. Saudi Arabia finances
PLO terrorism against Israel to deflect
radicalism away from its own land.
The PLO enforces its own brand of censor
ship upon Palestinians. Abu Zuluf, the editor of
the Palestinian newspaper Al-Quds, had his car
firebombed twice just because he hinted sup
port for Camp David. Rosenblum's claim of
PLO "democracy" is obviously a sham.
This lack of democratic process extends into
the highest echelons of the PLO. At the 1983
PLO Council meeting in Algiers, Arafat
forbade Dr. Sartawi, a PLO moderate, to
deliver a speech, thus delegitimizing him. Two
months later, Sartawi was assassinated.
It becomes clear upon the study of Palestinian
history that the tragedy of the Palestinian
people is that political power is monopolized by
extremists refusing any conciliation. The
boycotts against the West Bank and Gaza Civil
Administrations did not in fact express popular
will; they were imposed by the PLO. Rashad al-
Shawa, a leading Palestinian personality and
former mayor of Gaza, stated in an interview
that a "5 percent extremist minority forccd me
to boycott the civil administration against my
better judgment."
The Palestinian mayor of Bethlehem, Elias
Freij, said recently in an interview that pro-
PLO mayors in the West Bank, in their extreme
rejection of a compromise solution, were the
best allies of Israeli annexationists. In other
words, extremism on one side breeds extremism
on the other. Milson fought against precisely
this situation. Rather, he emphasized that
moderate positions on both sides reinforce each
other and constitute the only road to Israeli-
Palestinian peace.
Clearly, PLO supporters like Rosenblum find
it easier to argue against those Israelis who
refuse Palestinians a viable economic and politi
cal alternative. They would like to be in a posi
tion to state that those who oppose the PLO
oppose the Palestinian people. They are obvi
ously angered when they face someone like Mil
son who, while a critic of PLO terrorism and
absolutist ideology, has not only recognized the
existence of the Palestinian people and their

pghts, but also has devoted his political and aca
demic efforts on their behalf.
Milson not only advocated that Israel should
allow Palestinians to organize; he acted oh this
principle. The emergence of the Village
Leagues, which openly supported Camp David
and the Reagan peace initiative, exemplifies this '
approach. Of course, an indigenous Palestinian
movement frightens and angers the PLO lead
ership, which thrives on perpetuation of the
conflict. A PLO supporter like Rosenblum,
unable to cope with this phenomenon of Pales
tinians who do not accept the PLO as the "sole
legitimate representative," must resort to
libeling these people as criminals.

posed and implemented by Milson, Rosenblum

resorts to personal smear and guilt by associa
tion. Instead of discussing Milson's views,
Rosenblum simply links him to Menachem
Begin, Ariel Sharon and Yitzhak Shamir. But,
as is well known, the former civil administrator
was a nonpartisan appointee who served under
former Defense Ministers Shimon Peres of the
Labour Party, and Ezer Weitzman and Sharon,
both of the Likud Party. He served in capacities
ranging from adviser on Arab affairs to aide
decamp for Sadat during his historic visit to
Jerusalem in 1977.
One can agree or disagree with Milson's
views and policies, but to link them to those of
Begin, Sharon and Shamir when they clearly
differ, is a sign of ignorance, propaganda or dis
information. To place the burden of respon
siblity upon Milson's shoulders for military
actions over which he, as civil administrator,
had no control, reflects a complete disregard fcr
the facts. Milson clearly distinguishes between
PLO terrorists and the Palestinian people. To
accuse him of justifying brutality appallingly

distorts the record. In fact, Milson resigned
from his post as civil administrator in Septem
ber 1982 in protest over Begin's initial refusal
to set up a commission to investigate the Sabra
and Shatila massacre.
Milson's administration was marked by a
deep respect for the law. The proof lies in the
fact that not a single one of his decisions or
measures was revoked or criticized by the Is
raeli Supreme Court, which is universally
recognized to be non-political and a bastion of
justice. The period extending from mid-April
1982, after Milson removed pro-PLO West
Bank mayors, until his Sept. 22 resignation, was
the calmest period in the history of the Israeli
occupation of the West Bank, with a minimal
military presence and no killings.
Rosenblum repeatedly condemns Israel for
its occupation of the West Bank. He would like
us to ignore that this unfortunate situation was
created when Israel was forced to fight a defen
sive war against hostile Arab nations in 1967.
This occupation is perpetuated by the refusal of
Jordan and the PLO to negotiate peace. One
Arab country finally recognized that negotia
tions and recognition of Israel's right to exist are
the only means to peace. When Egypt, under
Sadat, chose to directly negotiate with Israel,
the occupied territory, the Sinai desert, was
returned, and peace was established.
lished.
It is the tragedy of the Palestinians that their
political life has been monopolized by leaders
who refuse to recognize Israel and the need for
a compromise solution. Much against their will,
as evidenced by the telling remarks of Shawa
and Freij, they are coerced to acquiesce to the
self-destructive approach of the PLO. The
Egyptian example poignantly illustrates the wil
lingness of Israel to compromise in the pursuit
of peace and recognition.
Menahem Milson attempted to instill a
moderate sensibility as a framework for ensur
ing the legitimate rights of both Israel and the
Palestinian people. A scholar, humanist and
truly loyal Israeli citizen, Milson courageously
stands for a just, humane and viable solution to
the Israeli-Arab conflict. Admittedly, both
right-wing annexationists and pro-PLO fanatics
reject such an approach. The Israeli Labour
monthly Spectrum best described Milson's
quest for peace: "Doves to the left of him,
hawks to the right of him, into the West Bank
rode Menahem Milson."
