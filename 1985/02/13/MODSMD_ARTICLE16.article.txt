On the fringe
Ever since I was an undergraduate
at Stanford, I have often suspected
that The Daily's editors deliberately
print the most inflammatory op-ed
pieces they can come up with —
regardless of the author's ability to
make sense — simply for the sake of
provoking a response. I can just see
them chuckling, "Wait 'til they see
this one!" as they slip in a real
zinger. Well, I've taken the bait.
Jason Matherly's idiotic column on
liberal hypocrisy in South Africa
(The Daily, Feb. 6) is an embarrass
ment to the conservative cause he
seems to want to support. Liberal or
conservative, only the willfully ig
norant can fail to make the distinc
tion between supplying weapons and
military training to a country for the
purpose of violent revolution — or
counter-revolution — and
"intervention" in the form of eco
nomic pressure to try and change the
apartheid policy that even Matherly
concedes is immoral.
His statement that South Africa
blacks "fare quite well compared to
the wretched peoples of Cambodia,
Vietnam, Ethiopia and the Soviet
Union" is not merely grossly in
sensitive, it is a logical and rhetorical
blunder of stupefying proportions.
It's like saying that people shouldn't
have gotten so worked up about
Auschwitz when Stalin was conduct
ing his bloody purges. Apartheid and
totalitarian repression are both evil
and should both be opposed. But the
U.S. approach to opposing
totalitarianism is to build an overkill
arsenal that will destroy us as cer
tainly as it will the Soviet Union —
whether because of Soviet retaliation
or the climatic ricochet of nuclear
winter — while our official response
to apartheid is to lamely mutter that
sometimes you just have to take the
bad with the good.
Surely The Daily can find a more
intelligent advocate for con
servatives. Or are you simply trying
to embarrass them by printing the
ravings of their least gifted ad
herents? It's a sly trick, sort of like a
politician getting the Ku Klux Klan
to endorse his opponent. Well, you
don't fool me.
