# Finding reality under all the whitewash
## 
### 
Sometimes the reaction to an event can be more
illuminating than the event itself. For example, in
November, four female Stanford students filed as
sault charges against a male student because of four
separate incidents they said had occurred at a party
at the Beta House. In one of the incidents a man
was alleged to have tried to remove the clothing of
one of the women as 10 or 20 party-goers stood by
and cheered, according to the woman and some
other witnesses.
Stanford's judicial affairs officer, Sally Cole,
conducted an investigation and recently released a
report about the charge against the bystanders.
That Stanford students would see a sexual assault
as entertaining is certainly a serious allegation, and
a serious inquiry was called for. Unfortunately, the
report that was issued was largely a whitewash.
Consider some of Cole's findings:
• The woman involved was not held for five
minutes, as she claimed, but a mere 90 seconds to
two minutes. (Hold you breath for two minutes. It's
a long time.)
• Her clothes were not being taken off: Only her
jacket was removed and the alleged assailant was
merely "grabbing hard"' or "holding on" to the
woman's clothing.
• The bystanders were not laughing at the woman,
but rather at a "drunken student who was making a
fool of himself' by molesting a woman.
Cole also gave the rationales offered by several
onlookers for not getting involved, including the
assumption that the man and woman knew each
other (making the incident, presumably, legitimate
social behavior) and the justification by friends of
the accused that his behavior was not serious be
cause he is "harmless."
For these and similar reasons, Cole found that
the bystanders did not violate any moral standards
bv not getting involved. The lesson to be learned

from this is not that students are entertained by
sexual assaults, but merely that they see nothing
wrong with a woman being held against her will for
two minutes by someone intent on "grabbing" her
clothes.
The whole mess is doubly interesting in light of
the reaction to "All Men at Fault in Rape and Ter
ror," a recent opinion piece in The Daily. The au
thor, Noel Hanrahan, charged that all men must

take responsibility for rape. Judging by the amount
of mail received by The Daily, this was considered
a far more outrageous act than laughing and cheer
ing at a sexual assault.
I won't defend Hanrahan's writing style. She
makes it far too easy to evade her message. But her
central point must still be faced: All men share in
the power garnered from the rapist's act.
Many letters — many more than were printed —
were sent to The Daily by indignant males. Was
there more than a little guilt in that rush to deny?
Men like to think that there are "rapists" out there
who have nothing to do with normal society — per
haps they live in the bushes that they jump out of.
Actually, most rapes are committed by "normal"
men against women they know. I think few men

here would not benefit from examining their own
sex lives to see whether they are innocent of using
coercion.
Many issues raised or implied by Hanrahan's
viewpoint still stand. Men — good men — are
placed in a paternalistic position of power by
women's fear of rape. Rape is not a natural fact —
it is created, defined and invested with meaning by
our culture. One can examine a Western Culture
reading list to find out which gender's culture it is.
The one point that I would like to dispute with
Hanrahan is her calling rape the "ultimate threat."
The threat of rape is predicated on an earlier
oppression — the transformation of women into
property. Women are told from childhood that
their chief social worth is as a sexual commodity.
It is this lie that allows men to devalue women
through rape, to turn a physical assault into an at
tack on a woman's whole being, into the absolute
humiliation that rape is.
Women who are rape victims need all the sup
port they can be given. But all women need to
know that a rapist should not be able to ruin their
lives, that they need not feel guilty or devalued by
being raped, and that they don't have to restrict
their freedom in order to remain "good girls" who
are deserving of society's sympathy.
I cringe every time I hear some well-intentioned
person urge women not to go out at night alone, or
to get a man to go with them every time they go to
the library. Rape is a real danger, but so is the dan
ger of making the fear of rape — despite our best
intentions — into something which keeps women in
their places, i.e.. under the protection of a man.
That danger, rather than the danger of giving of
fense to male consciences, is the real problem with
Hanrahan's column.
