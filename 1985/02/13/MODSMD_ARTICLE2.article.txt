Plans for the proposed Ronald
Reagan Presidential Library cleared a
major hurdle yesterday when the
Stanford Board of Trustees agreed

said a trustee committee debated the
issue for nearly an hour Monday.

Counselor Edwin Meese 111 to Board
President William Kimball, Meese
explained Reagan's preference for
the Junipero Serra site.
Reagan "is especially concerned
that if the Library is to be located on
a university campus, it be readily ac
