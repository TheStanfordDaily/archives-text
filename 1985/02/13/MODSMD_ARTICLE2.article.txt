# Board backs C-IR decision, library site
## Reagan's top choice approved 
### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
Plans for the proposed Ronald
Reagan Presidential Library cleared a
major hurdle yesterday when the
Stanford Board of Trustees agreed
unanimously that the library should
be located on a site in the foothills
just west of Junipero Serra
Boulevard.
University President Donald Ken
nedy will send a letter to President
Reagan this week officially informing
him of the trustee decision, said
Robert Freelen, Stanford vice presi
dent for public affairs. Reagan, who
has indicated a strong preference for
this site, will have final site approval.
The action came as no surprise in
light of recent events. Last week, a
high-powered seven-member trustee
committee, including Board Presi
dent William Kimball, recommended
the Junipero Serra site, the location
closest to campus of more than 20
originally considered by the Univer
sity. That decision echoed the late
November recommendation issued
by a planning group.
The trustees discussed the library
site for 10 minutes before voting yes
terday, according to Freelen. Freelen
said a trustee committee debated the
issue for nearly an hour Monday.
Two top location choices — one off
Alpine Road near Ladera and Por
tola Valley, one near the intersection
of Page Mill Road and Interstate 280
— were criticized by community
members. Local groups feared the li
brary would bring increased traffic,
noise and other inconveniences to
surrounding towns.
In a Jan. 18 letter from Presidential
Counselor Edwin Meese 111 to Board
President William Kimball, Meese
explained Reagan's preference for
the Junipero Serra site.
Reagan "is especially concerned
that if the Library is to be located on
a university campus, it be readily ac
cessible to undergraduate and
graduate students," according to the
letter.
W. Glenn Campbell, director of the
Hoover Institution, expressed his
satisfaction with the decision yester
day.
"The site's proximity to the central
campus creates excellent prospects
for developing a close relationship
between.the library and the academic
program of the University,"
Campbell said.
Pending Reagan's approval, the li
brary will be in a valley just behind
the first set of hills above Junipero
Serra. Access from Junipero Serra
will be from a road that currently
serves the Stanford Golf Course and
the Center for Advanced Studies in

Behavioral Sciences, planners say.
The trustees said yesterday the
museum exhibition space in the
facility should not exceed 15 percent
of the total area in the building or
buildings. Reagan plans to house a
more extensive collection of personal
memorabilia at Eureka College in
Dixon, 111.
In February 1984, Stanford trus
tees approved the Reagan library and
a small museum but rejected White
House proposals for a policy center to
be governed by Hoover.
In other action at yesterday's
meeting, board members approved
increases in tuiton and room and
board fees for the 1985-86 academic
year.
Undergraduate tuition will be set at
$10,476, topping the $10,000 mark
for the first time ever. Tuition for the
school of medicine will reach
$12,330, the lighest of Stanford's

professional schools.
Room and board will climb 8.7
percent to an average of $4,417 for
on-campus students. In 1983-84,
Stanford had the second highest room
and board rates nationwide. In a
comparitive study of tuition rates last
year, Stanford ranked seventh among
comparable institutions across the
country.
