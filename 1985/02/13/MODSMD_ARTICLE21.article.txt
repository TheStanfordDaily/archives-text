## Persevering preacher brings act to Farm 
### MARY YUH Editorial staff 
James Gilles, or "Brother Jim" as
he is more commonly known, offend
ed and amused hundreds of spec
tators in White Plaza yesterday and
Monday with his attacks on
homosexuals and women and his
extreme views on God, sin and
Christianity.
As one bystander said simply,
"He's condemning all people."
Gilles decried homosexuality as a
sin, declaring that "all homosexuals
are murderers." He cited three fun
damental steps toward becoming a
homosexual: believing in Darwin's
theory of evolution — pronouncing
it "evil-lution" — being a secular
humanist and being an atheist.
Women are "whores,' hussies, un
clean," and they caused man's ex
pulsion from Eden, he told his lis
teners. "Do you know what ERA
stands for?" he asked. "Eve ruined
Adam."
Gilles continuously returned to
the theme of sin, saying, "God is not
obligated to hear the prayers of a
sinner until he first prays for repen
tance," and, "There are moral ab
solutes, right and wrong. There is no
gray matter."
God has "a master plan: the total
annihilation of all sinners," he said.
"God's master race does not say
'Sieg Heil.' We say' Praise God.' It's
not skin, it's sin, that God is con
cerned about."
Repeatedly asserting that he is
"without sin," he challenged the
crowd to give up "the college life of
drugs, sex, booze and rock 'n' roll"
for the "life of God's grace."
Gilles described how he was
saved at a Van Halen concert four
years ago, during his senior year of
high school. "My eyes were opened
to the utter darkness of my life of
depravity as a drug addict and lusty
rock 'n' roller," he said. "I've been
motivated to open the eyes of others
in my age group so that they might
see sin and holiness in contrast to
each other."
One month after that pivotal con

cert, Gilles was praying in church
when God spoke, he told The Daily.
"God called me, 'Jim, I have taken
you away from the drugs, sex, booze
and rock 'n' roll scene, and I am
going to send you back, only this
time to preach to them.' "
"My employer is the moral gover
nor of the universe," Gilles said.
"I'm basically a missionary. I live by
faith." He said he has spent nine
months a year for the past three

years preaching on college
campuses because, he said, "I love
the students."
Students, however, do not seem
to return that emotion.
"He's a great performer, but he's
ptain wrong," said a spectator.
"The things he says bother me a
lot," freshman Jeff Colen said.
"People like him should be put
away. He's very scary."
"He's putting most of the people

here on the defensive," said senior
Joel Bellenson. "He hasn't done
anything constructive."
Gilles is "an extreme case of prej
udice based on ignorance," said
Walter Geys, a doctoral candidate
in economics. "On the one hand,
he's hilarious and funny, on the
other, disgusting. The principal
thing is tHat he believes that he
knows the truth, and only he can be
right."
Said sophomore Chip Atterbury:
"I think he's misrepresenting Chris
tianity, especially because he thinks
he's perfect and the Bible says that
no man is without sin."
"He doesn't substantiate him
self," said sophomore John Lazor.
"He's quoting his opinions as if they
were scripture. He calls people
names and insults them. He ignores
questions. Jesus reached out to
people and this guy can't even stand
to be touched. He does many things
opposite to what Jesus did."
"Closed-minded" is how sopho
more Danielle Darracq character
ized Gilles. "He's incredibly
prejudiced. 'Sweeping generaliza
tions' is his middle name. He's an
elitist: Everybody who doesn't
believe what he believes is mixed
up."
Apparently, Gilles has not
received the desired response. In
stead of bringing people close to his
brand of Christianity, he seems to
have alienated them.
Nevertheless, Gilles is un
daunted. "I plan to preach at col
lege campuses indefinitely, until I
die."
Gilles is a member of Geth
semane Temple, a fundamentalist,
inter-denominational sect of Chris
tianity that partially finances his ac
tivities. He supports his nine
month-a-year habit of preaching at
colleges by holding prayer meetings,
guest-speaking at fundamentalist
churches and attracting donations from
"people who just love Brother Jim
and can't do enough for him finan
cially," Gilles said.

gray matter."
God has "a master plan: the total
annihilation of all sinners," he said.
"God's master race does not say
'Sieg Heil.' We say' Praise God.' It's
not skin, it's sin, that God is con
cerned about."
Repeatedly asserting that he is
"without sin," he challenged the
crowd to give up "the college life of
drugs, sex, booze and rock 'n' roll"
for the "life of God's grace."
Gilles described how he was
saved at a Van Halen concert four
years ago, during his senior year of
high school. "My eyes were opened
to the utter darkness of my life of
depravity as a drug addict and lusty
rock 'n' roller," he said. "I've been
motivated to open the eyes of others
in my age group so that they might
see sin and holiness in contrast to
each other."
One month after that pivotal con

cert, Gilles was praying in church
when God spoke, he told The Daily.
"God called me, 'Jim, I have taken
you away from the drugs, sex, booze
and rock 'n' roll scene, and I am
going to send you back, only this
time to preach to them.' "
"My employer is the moral gover
nor of the universe," Gilles said.
"I'm basically a missionary. I live by
faith." He said he has spent nine
months a year for the past three

years preaching on college
campuses because, he said, "I love
the students."
Students, however, do not seem
to return that emotion.
"He's a great performer, but he's
ptain wrong," said a spectator.
"The things he says bother me a
lot," freshman Jeff Colen said.
"People like him should be put
away. He's very scary."
"He's putting most of the people

here on the defensive," said senior
Joel Bellenson. "He hasn't done
anything constructive."
Gilles is "an extreme case of prej
udice based on ignorance," said
Walter Geys, a doctoral candidate
in economics. "On the one hand,
he's hilarious and funny, on the
other, disgusting. The principal
thing is tHat he believes that he
knows the truth, and only he can be
right."
Said sophomore Chip Atterbury:
"I think he's misrepresenting Chris
tianity, especially because he thinks
he's perfect and the Bible says that
no man is without sin."
"He doesn't substantiate him
self," said sophomore John Lazor.
"He's quoting his opinions as if they
were scripture. He calls people
names and insults them. He ignores
questions. Jesus reached out to
people and this guy can't even stand
to be touched. He does many things
opposite to what Jesus did."
"Closed-minded" is how sopho
more Danielle Darracq character
ized Gilles. "He's incredibly
prejudiced. 'Sweeping generaliza
tions' is his middle name. He's an
elitist: Everybody who doesn't
believe what he believes is mixed
up."
Apparently, Gilles has not
received the desired response. In
stead of bringing people close to his
brand of Christianity, he seems to
have alienated them.
Nevertheless, Gilles is un
daunted. "I plan to preach at col
lege campuses indefinitely, until I
die."
Gilles is a member of Geth
semane Temple, a fundamentalist,
inter-denominational sect of Chris
tianity that partially finances his ac
tivities. He supports his nine
month-a-year habit of preaching at
colleges by holding prayer meetings,
guest-speaking at fundamentalist
churches and attracting donations from
"people who just love Brother Jim
and can't do enough for him finan
cially," Gilles said.

Now 22 years old. Jim Gilles travels nine months of the year and has
been doing so for the past three years. Stanford is the 163 rd schoo' he
says he has visited in that time.
James Gilles, or "Brother Jim" as
he is more commonly known, offend
ed and amused hundreds of spec
tators in White Plaza yesterday and
Monday with his attacks on
homosexuals and women and his
extreme views on God, sin and
Christianity.
As one bystander said simply,
"He's condemning all people."
Gilles decried homosexuality as a
sin, declaring that "all homosexuals
are murderers." He cited three fun
damental steps toward becoming a
homosexual: believing in Darwin's
theory of evolution — pronouncing
it "evil-lution" — being a secular
humanist and being an atheist.
Women are "whores,' hussies, un
clean," and they caused man's ex
pulsion from Eden, he told his lis
teners. "Do you know what ERA
stands for?" he asked. "Eve ruined
Adam."
Gilles continuously returned to
the theme of sin, saying, "God is not
obligated to hear the prayers of a
sinner until he first prays for repen
tance," and, "There are moral ab
solutes, right and wrong. There is no
gray matter."
God has "a master plan: the total
annihilation of all sinners," he said.
"God's master race does not say
'Sieg Heil.' We say' Praise God.' It's
not skin, it's sin, that God is con
cerned about."
