## Card blows out USF, 18-3 
### LARRY GREEN Staff sportswriter 
In its outlook for the 1985 season,
the Cardinal Baseball Press Guide
reads: "The offense is certainly better
than last year." The Cardinal added a
little credence to that statement yes
terday when it powered to a convinc
ing 18-3 victory over the University
of San Francisco Dons at Sunken
Diamond.
Mark Davis, Mike Deßenon and
Walt Harris led the Cardinal attack.

collecting eight hits, nine runs and 11
RBIs among them. It didn't seem to
matter who was on the mound for the
Dons — Stanford pounded out 15
hits off six different USF pitchers, in
cluding Dave Sheldon, the Dons'
starting right fielder.
Although USF was not the caliber
of Stanford's league opponents,
Coach Mark Marquess was generally
pleased with the win. "We really hit
well and it's nice to get Mark Davis
going," he said. Maruuess rated the

Dons' pitching as fair, but added that
"we haven't really met any dominant
pitching yet."
In the bottom of the second, with
the Cardinal trailing 1-0, Deßenon
ignited a four-run rally with a leadoff
single. Harris got aboard on a
fielder's choice and Davis cleared the
bases with a triple for a 2-1 lead. Toi
Cook singled Davis home, went to
second on the throw and scored on
subsequent sacrifice flies by Pete
Stanicek and John Verducci.
On the first pitch of the Cardinal
half of the third inning, Deßenon
lined a home run to left field, upping
the lead to 5-1. Harris followed with
a single and once again Davis cleared
the bases — this time with a line
drive homer to left field that chased
USF starter Pat McClelland from the
mound. When Stanicek drove in
Cook, who had gotten aboard on a
walk, Stanford led 8-2, and the game
was essentially over.
Jeff Ballard gave up a home run to
USF catcher Nick Laßocca in the top
of the fourth, but that would be the
last run for the Dons. Ballard ex
plained that the homer was off a
fastball. "My curveball was working
today," he said, "but I was a little in
consistent with the fastball."
In the sixth, Stanford shut the door
on the Dons with an eight-run explo
sion fueled by five walks, two passed
balls and another two-run homer by
Davis. Deßenon started it off by sin
gling with the bases full to score
Ruben Amaro and John Ramos. Har
ris cleared the bases with a triple —
scoring Rick Lundblade and
Deßenon — before Davis finished
the job with a blast to left-center. He
later said, "These kind of days (3-for
4, 2 homers, 6 RBIs, 3 runs) don't
come often, so I'll probably savor this
one."
In the seventh inning, freshman

hurler Lee Plemel replaced Ballard,
who wound up being credited with his
second win of the season. Plemel gave
up two hits but also struck out six bat
ters — including all three he faced in
the eighth.
In the bottom of that inning. Card
inal reserve catcher Doug Robbins
slammed a solo home run to left
center to cap off Stanford's 15-hit of
fensive performance.

Centerfielder Mark Davis accepts the congratulations of third-base
coach Dean Stotz after the first of his two home runs put the Cardinal
up 7-1.
In its outlook for the 1985 season,
the Cardinal Baseball Press Guide
reads: "The offense is certainly better
than last year." The Cardinal added a
little credence to that statement yes
terday when it powered to a convinc
ing 18-3 victory over the University
of San Francisco Dons at Sunken
Diamond.
Mark Davis, Mike Deßenon and
Walt Harris led the Cardinal attack.

collecting eight hits, nine runs and 11
RBIs among them. It didn't seem to
matter who was on the mound for the
Dons — Stanford pounded out 15
hits off six different USF pitchers, in
cluding Dave Sheldon, the Dons'
starting right fielder.
Although USF was not the caliber
of Stanford's league opponents,
Coach Mark Marquess was generally
pleased with the win. "We really hit
well and it's nice to get Mark Davis
going," he said. Maruuess rated the

Dons' pitching as fair, but added that
"we haven't really met any dominant
pitching yet."
In the bottom of the second, with
the Cardinal trailing 1-0, Deßenon
ignited a four-run rally with a leadoff
single. Harris got aboard on a
fielder's choice and Davis cleared the
bases with a triple for a 2-1 lead. Toi
Cook singled Davis home, went to
second on the throw and scored on
subsequent sacrifice flies by Pete
Stanicek and John Verducci.
On the first pitch of the Cardinal
half of the third inning, Deßenon
lined a home run to left field, upping
the lead to 5-1. Harris followed with
a single and once again Davis cleared
the bases — this time with a line
drive homer to left field that chased
USF starter Pat McClelland from the
mound. When Stanicek drove in
Cook, who had gotten aboard on a
walk, Stanford led 8-2, and the game
was essentially over.
Jeff Ballard gave up a home run to
USF catcher Nick Laßocca in the top
of the fourth, but that would be the
last run for the Dons. Ballard ex
plained that the homer was off a
fastball. "My curveball was working
today," he said, "but I was a little in
consistent with the fastball."
In the sixth, Stanford shut the door
on the Dons with an eight-run explo
sion fueled by five walks, two passed
balls and another two-run homer by
Davis. Deßenon started it off by sin
gling with the bases full to score
Ruben Amaro and John Ramos. Har
ris cleared the bases with a triple —
scoring Rick Lundblade and
Deßenon — before Davis finished
the job with a blast to left-center. He
later said, "These kind of days (3-for
4, 2 homers, 6 RBIs, 3 runs) don't
come often, so I'll probably savor this
one."
In the seventh inning, freshman

hurler Lee Plemel replaced Ballard,
who wound up being credited with his
second win of the season. Plemel gave
up two hits but also struck out six bat
ters — including all three he faced in
the eighth.
In the bottom of that inning. Card
inal reserve catcher Doug Robbins
slammed a solo home run to left
center to cap off Stanford's 15-hit of
fensive performance.
