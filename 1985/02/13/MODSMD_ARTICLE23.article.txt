# Netters struggle in warm-up win
## 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford men's tennis team
yesterday ran into the toughest
sort of opponent in sports — an
underdog with nothing to lose. In
its closest preseason match so far,
the Cardinal lost three singles
matches before sweeping the
doubles to pull out a 6-3 victory
over UC-Santa Barbara on the
Varsity Courts.
Stanford, still riding high from
its Intercollegiate Tennis Coaches
Association Team Indoor title and
senior Dan Goldie's All American
Indoor title, did not play its best
lineup against Santa Barbara.
"We knew they weren't playing
their top players. They were un
derestimating us," UCSB fresh
man Scott Morse said. "We told
ourselves to dig in and go for it."
Morse dug in for his No. 3
singles match against Cardinal
Scott Moody, and came away with
a hard-fought 7-5, 7-5 victory.
Moody said he had difficulty
concentrating. "I was up 5-2 in the
second set but I couldn't pull it
out," he said. "He had a pretty
good serve and returns — I just
lost my mind."
The prolonged No. 2 singles
match between Patrick McEnroe
and Gus Andersen drew most of
the attention yesterday afternoon.
Andersen won in three sets, 4-6,
7-6, 7-5.
Stanford pulled out the match in
the doubles competition, not
losing a set in three matches. The
Cardinal played all but one of its
six top doubles players — Dan
Goldie was replaced by Eric

Rosenfeld in the No. 3 spot.
UCSB's second-year coach,
Gary Druckman, was "extremely
proud" of the way his team per
formed against what is probably
the best team in the nation.
"We've had 14 matches so far.
and 1 would say we are just getting
into the rhythm of the season,"
Druckman said. "We had two
freshmen win their matches. . . .
When someone wins like that, the
feeling of'l can win too' spreads."
Druckman was not particularly
concerned with whether or not
Stanford played its best players.
"Nothing detracts from the fact
that you're playing the No. 1 team
in the nation. . . . We hung in
there all the way."
According to Stanford Coach
Dick Gould, the match against
Santa Barbara was intended to be
a warm-up for the Cardinal's
meeting with No. 8-ranked LSU
tomorrow. The Cardinal may have
gotten a little heat instead of
warmth.
