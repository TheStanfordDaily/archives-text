# Card gets set for challenges, cakewalks
## Netters expect romp 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
With a 4-0 record and a 3()-match
winning streak on the line, the Stan
ford women's tennis team returns to
action today against Santa Clara. The
match begins at 1:30 p.m. on the Var
sity Courts.
Top-ranked Stanford defeated
UC-Davis 9-0 Monday to extend the
streak, which dates back to last
season and breaks the old record of
29 set from 1981-83.
"The record is nice," Cardinal
Coach Frank Brennan said, "and it's
a nice compliment on the program.
But right now, the girls are concerned
with getting into the meat of our
schedule and meeting some better
opponents."
That won't happen today. Stanford
will have to wait until next Wednes
day, when it hosts eighth-ranked Cal

ifornia, for some serious competition.
"The Cal match next week is going
to he a very big match," Brennan
said. "I'm going with my full lineup
against Cal."
Brennan will use an assortment of
scholarship and walk-on players
against Santa Clara, a team he said
"shouldn't pose any more problems
than a UC-Davis."
The Cardinal was without three of
its top players in its two most recent
victories. Linda Gates and Leigh
Anne Eldredge were at the National
Indoor Intercollegiate Tennis Tourn
ament, and freshman Anna Ivan was
sick.
Though all three are available
today, Brennan won't need them
against the Broncos. He will,
however, against Cal â€” the first team
with a realistic shot at halting the win
streak.
