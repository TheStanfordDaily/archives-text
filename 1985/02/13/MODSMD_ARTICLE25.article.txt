After a four-game tour through
Southern California, the Stanford
men's volleyball team returns to the
familiar surroundings of Maples
Pavilion today for a crucial 4
p.m. game with league rival UC-
Santa Barbara.
The Cardinal, now 3-2 in the Cali
fornia Intercollegiate Volleyball As
sociation and 11-3 overall after its 2-
2 road trip, is tied for fourth place in
the CIVA with the Gauchos, also 3-2.
Stanford and Santa Barbara trail
league leaders USC (4-0), UCLA
(3-0) and Pepperdine (2-0).
Today's contest could shed some
light on the uncertain NCAA playoff
picture. Traditionally, the No. 2
through No. 5 teams in the CIVA
compete at season's end for the one
at-large spot still available in the

NCAA tournament's final four. The
other three spots are reserved for the
champions from the East, the Mid
west and the CIVA.
While Stanford, ranked sixth na
tionally, would seem secure in its cur
rent tie for fourth. Cardinal Co-coach
Don Shaw is anything but com
placent. "There are a lot of good
teams in this league," he said. "There
are probably six or seven teams capa
ble of making it." Last year, the
Cardinal learned firsthand that it's a
tough task to qualify for the CIVA at
large tournament, as it finished the
season in eighth place at 6-12.
Shaw described today's opponent
as a "team that's always been tough
for us." In this year's only meeting,
Stanford downed No. 4 Santa Bar
bara in two sets in the semifinals of
the Santa Barbara Invitational.
