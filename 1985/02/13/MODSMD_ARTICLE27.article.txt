## Habib says peace is possible 
### CHARLES GNAEDINGER 
Relative tranquility in the Middle East at the present
time offers an unprecedented opportunity for peace in
the region, former U.S. special envoy to the Middle
East told an overflow audience at Hoover Tower yes
terday.
Habib said the current tranquility of the region, the
flexibility of the Labor Party now in power in Israel
and the readiness of the more moderate PLO factions
to begin negotiations through King Hussein of Jordan
all serve to create a more favorable climate for peace
negotiations.
The United States must be willing to play a central
role in any future negotiations because it is widely per
ceived by the Arab states as the only nation with any
influence over Israel and because Israel would prefer
U.S. involvement anyway, Habib said.
Habib briefly discussed the importance of the

Middle East to the United States and its allies. While
the region is a crossroads for world trade and a vital
supplier of natural resources to the West, Habib also
stressed the role of the Middle East as a highly
sensitive area in the global confrontation between the
United States and the Soviet Union.
In addition, Habib outlined the primary commit
ments and goals that have influenced U.S. policy
toward the Middle East in recent decades. Besides sup
port for Israel, the United States has shown greatly in
creased support for Egypt since the signing of the
Camp David Accords under President Carter, he said.
Also, depending on the specific issue, American policy
may strongly support Jordan or Saudi Arabia, accord
ing to Habib.
Habib devoted part of his talk to examining what he
called "crisis situations" that occur with disturbing
regularity in the Middle East.
