An article in The Daily yesterday
on an environmental safety facility,
site misquoted Louis Fein as saying
that putting the facility in the hills
above Stanford would reduce the po
tential for accidents. Fein said instead
that putting the facility there would
reduce the potential for harm to
humans as a result of accidents. The
Daily regrets the error.
