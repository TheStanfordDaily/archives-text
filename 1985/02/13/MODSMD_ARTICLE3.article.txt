# What the trustees' jobs entail

### CAMERON KALLER Senior staff writer 
In the wake of many recent Board of Trustees decisions
on top-of-the-news issues ranging from tuition increases
to University divestment policy, interest has grown in just
what the hoard's duties and powers are.
According to Board President William Kimball, very
few people have a complete understanding of who the
trustees are or what they are actually responsible for.
"Essentially,'" Kimball said, "we are responsible for the
total financial health of the University, both raising and
spending the University's funds, determining policy for
the University as well as choosing its president."
According to the University bylaws, the board "is cus
todian of the endowment and all the properties of the
University. The Board administers the invested fund, sets
the annual budget and determines policies for operation
and control of the University."

"We don't manage the University itselfâ€” the president
and the provost do that. The board is, however, the final
authority. Don (University President Donald Kennedy)
must report to the board on any and all major financial ar
rangements such as authorization for new buildings or for
bonds and so forth," Kimball said.
"An issue may come before the board several times
before it is passed," Kimball explained, citing the Reagan
library as one such issue.
"All along we've wanted what's best for Stanford Uni
versity, and that hasn't necessarily been what the Reagan
administration has felt was best for the library ... in terms
of governance and location. We've 'won,' however, and
gotten essentially what we wanted," he said.
There are 32 members of the board, including Ken
nedy, who serves ex-officio. Alumni elect eight board
