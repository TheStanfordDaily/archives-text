# Conditional divestment tied to Motorola's sales
## 
### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
The Board of Trustees voted yes
terday to sell nearly $4.7 million
worth of stock in Motorola, Inc. if the
Illinois-based electronics firm
resumes sales to the South African
military or police.
That decision marks the first time
the board has ratified a divestment
proposal of any type since the Uni
versity's adoption of a policy on in
vestment responsibility in 1977. If
divestment occurs, it would be the
first time Stanford has sold stock on
moral grounds, said William Massy,
vice president for business and
finance.
A Motorola public relations official
refused to comment yesterday when
informed by The Daily of the board's
decision. He also declined to com
ment on the company's future sales
intentions.
University President Donald Ken
nedy, a member of the board of trus
tees, said divestment was the only
reasonable choice in this case.
"Having failed to receive an as
surance that sales of equipment to the
South African police will not be
resumed, we must — it seems to me
— reinforce our finding that such
sales constitute substantial social in
jury," Kennedy said.
As the trustees discussed these and
other matters on the second floor of
the Herbert Hoover Memorial Build
ing, more than 40 students and staff
members staged a peaceful sit-in in
the lobby. The protestors, who in
cluded members of the Black Student
Union and other groups which
oppose apartheid, called for total
divestment of all companies that do
business with South Africa.
The board's decision reflects its ap
proval of a unanimous recommenda
tion from the Committee on Invest
ment Responsibility (C-IR), a 12-
member student, staff and faculty
group which suggested conditional
divestment in January. The C-IR
studied Motorola's investment
policies for three months before de
termining that the company's sales
were socially injurious in their sup

port for apartheid.
Divestment of the 124,000 shares
is contingent upon the University fin
ding that "Motorola has sold, or is
selling, equipment to the South
African military and/or police after
1983," according to the board resolu
tion drawn up by the special trustee
committee on investment responsibil
ity.
A Motorola spokesman told the C
IR in December that the corporation
did not sell any equipment to the
South African military or police in
1984. He pledged that Motorola
would not resume sales in the future
to the military but remained noncom
mittal on sales to the police.
Massy said the University will
monitor the company carefully to
watch for sales that might trigger
divestment.
"There are a number of national
services that track what happens in
South Africa," Massy said. He said
Stanford would use those services —
in conjunction with its own resources
— to keep tabs on the company.
Student and staff protestors called
the trustee action "encouraging," but
only a "half-step."
"We accept it as an encouraging
sign that they are willing to act," said
Steve Phillips, chairman of the Black
Student Union. "But it's really noth
ing compared to what we're asking
for. The very presence of companies
in South Africa supports apartheid."
The BSU and other protesting
groups, including the Stanford Coali
tion Against Apartheid, advocate
total divestment of stock held in all
companies that do business with
South Africa.
"Stanford's investment in compan
ies doing business with South Africa
is completely antithetical to the ideals
of academic and social freedom,
public service and equality of oppor
tunity which the University professes
to support," Phillips said.
"I think it's a good half-step," said
Keith Archuleta, assistant director of
the Row. "It's a compromise, but
there are a lot of miles to go," he said.
