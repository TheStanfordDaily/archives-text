# ASSU votes for split-fee ballots
## 
### JOYA WESLEY Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate voted last night
to place divided fee requests for the
Axe Committee, The Daily and the
Band on this spring's fee-assessment
ballot.
In other business during its meeting
in the Law School, the senate ap
proved all the recommendations of
the Senate Appropriations Commit
tee regarding groups requesting fee
assessments. In addition, the senate
received previous notice on a resolu
tion thanking the Board of Trustees
for voting for conditional divestment
of the University's Motorola, Inc.
stock holdings.
The division of budgets marks the
first time such action has been taken,
according to Council of Presidents
member David Porter. It allows the
senate to indicate to the voting stu
dent body which line items of an or
ganization's budget the senate deems
questionable, he said.
"We now have a very powerful
weapon," said Porter. However, he
said he feels the senate used this
weapon to an abusive degree in the
case of the Band.
The senate voted to place the
Band's entire budget on the ballot,
but with the Band's preseason trip to
Washington next fall listed as a sepa
rate item.
Because the University has refused
to provide extra funding for this trip,
several senate members argued that
the student body should be able to
vote down this activity — from which

it would not directly benefit — with
out denying all funding to the Band.
Fee assessments for both the Axe
Committee and The Daily will also be
presented in this manner.
Official action on the resolution to
thank the Board of Trustees for its
actions regarding Unversity invest
ments will be taken at the next senate
meeting.
Graduate senator Mark Landes
mann. the bill's sponsor, said he feels
a resolution to thank the board would
be in order to show that the senate
appreciates its cooperation and its
response to the results of this fall's
ASSU referendum on South Africa.
The senate also received word of
the findings of a special chair's com
mittee formed to investigate the
source of the leak of confidential in
formation regarding the Coffee
House to The Daily.
Committee Chair B.G. Porter said
the committee determined that an
unidentified member of the senate
leaked the information.
Several senators expressed
negative feelings about this during
open forum.
"I am very, very disappointed."
said Graduate Senator Jim
DeLaHunt. The action was unjus
tified and was obviously intended to
sabotage the senate, he said.
The senate also entertained sugges
tions for extended service of the Mar
guerite system as either a supplement
to or a replacement for SURE. This
issue is also being reviewed by the
Senate Appropriations Committee,
us it decides how to handle SURH's
request for a special fee assessment.
The positive points of an extended
Marguerite service are that it would
benefit both men and women and
would provide protection against cold
weather and rain, in addition to pre
venting rapes, said Graduate Senator
Brita Jaffe.
Senator Derek Passarelli pointed
out that although an extended Mar
guerite would be helpful, it still would
not be able to go door-to-door as
SURE escorts do, so women would
not have an escort away from main
streets.
