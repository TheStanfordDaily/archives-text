# COSS-R opts to drop a co-op
## News 
### CAMERON KALLER Senior staff writer 
The Committee on Student Services-
Residences (COSS-R) recommended yesterday
the conversion of Terra House from a
cooperative to a University-operated house.
The committee's report recommends that
Terra House "be a University-operated house
for at least the next two Draws," and that "the
residents of Terra have the option of presenting a
written request for the house to be a self
operated house."
Calling the committee's recommendation
"fairly moderate," Rodger Whitney, assistant
dean of Residential Education and director of the
Housing Center, stressed that the report is still
only a recommendation and has yet to be ap
proved by Dean of Res Ed Norm Robinson.
"What we hope is that by tightening the num
ber of co-op spaces available, the remaining
spaces will fill up better in the Draw," Whitney
said. There arc currently six co-ops on campus.
Terra was selected because it will be the most
likely to succeed as a University-operated house,
according to the report.
A University-operated house has full-time
food and cleaning services provided by the Uni
versity.
But Whitney says he expects Terra to petition
for self-op status.
Director of the Row Diana Conklin said self
ops differ from co-ops in that "self-ops hire a
full-time, professional cook . . . and fill consis
tently. whereas co-ops do not."
"The opportunity for Terra to be a self-op
would make it very similar to a co-op, except it
wouldn't have quite the consensus decision
making," Whitney said.
"If the residents want to bake bread in the
Terra tradition, that won't change in a self-op en
vironment," he said. "We're trying not to un
dermine what is good, but simply to create a
more broad-based appeal for students going
through the Draw."

"Self-ops are a popular option," Conklin said.
"They are a wonderful place for students to live
and to learn how to take care of themselves. I was
happy to see COSS-R leave that option open for
Terra."
"Our choices ran the gamut from actually mer
ging the co-ops or terminating them to looking at
two instead of one. What we've proposed is not a
radical change," Whitney said. "The house isn't
closing, and we're not slapping the residents of
Terra in the face."
"The committee wanted to see what would
happen with a moderate change at first. We'll
look at it again next year and see if more drastic
changes are called for," he said.

Robinson said he had not had enough time to
focus on the committee's recommendation and
would probably not issue a decision until late this
month.
After hearing of the recommendation, Terra
residents invited Robinson, Conklin, Whitney
and others to dinner last night.
"We haven't given up yet," said Terra resident
Eileen McManus, a sophomore.
"Making it into a University-run house would,
to me, be closing Terra. You can't make Terra
not a co-op and have it still be Terra," she said.
"Now, it is almost like a family is living together

here, but University-operated
housing isn't even close to being a
home-like atmosphere.
"I just landed in Terra by accident,"
McManus said, "but it's been like a
180-degree turnaround. That's the
case for a lot of people who, like me,

end up here as a result of bad Draw
numbers but then realize that they
like co-ops and want to stay."
McManus said that Terra residents
will "definitely" petition for self-op
status if they cannot remain a co-op.
Conklin said, "It remains to be
seen whether the change will help to
fill Terra or not. We've no idea what
the problem is, whether it's the name
or the co-op-ness, but this is a hy

pothesis we've got to test."
"With outreach and this moderate
change, this problem might well he
solved," Whitney said. "The commit
tee considered the possibility of let
ting a decision on the co-ops go for
one more year and see how they fare
in the Draw, but everyone agreed
that it's the same problem now that
it's been for a number of years. It's
not going to go away, and something
had to be done to address it."

A University-operated house has full-time
food and cleaning services provided by the Uni
versity.
But Whitney says he expects Terra to petition
for self-op status.
Director of the Row Diana Conklin said self
ops differ from co-ops in that "self-ops hire a
full-time, professional cook . . . and fill consis
tently. whereas co-ops do not."
"The opportunity for Terra to be a self-op
would make it very similar to a co-op, except it
wouldn't have quite the consensus decision
making," Whitney said.
"If the residents want to bake bread in the
Terra tradition, that won't change in a self-op en
vironment," he said. "We're trying not to un
dermine what is good, but simply to create a
more broad-based appeal for students going
through the Draw."

"Self-ops are a popular option," Conklin said.
"They are a wonderful place for students to live
and to learn how to take care of themselves. I was
happy to see COSS-R leave that option open for
Terra."
"Our choices ran the gamut from actually mer
ging the co-ops or terminating them to looking at
two instead of one. What we've proposed is not a
radical change," Whitney said. "The house isn't
closing, and we're not slapping the residents of
Terra in the face."
"The committee wanted to see what would
happen with a moderate change at first. We'll
look at it again next year and see if more drastic
changes are called for," he said.

Robinson said he had not had enough time to
focus on the committee's recommendation and
would probably not issue a decision until late this
month.
After hearing of the recommendation, Terra
residents invited Robinson, Conklin, Whitney
and others to dinner last night.
"We haven't given up yet," said Terra resident
Eileen McManus, a sophomore.
"Making it into a University-run house would,
to me, be closing Terra. You can't make Terra
not a co-op and have it still be Terra," she said.
"Now, it is almost like a family is living together

here, but University-operated
housing isn't even close to being a
home-like atmosphere.
"I just landed in Terra by accident,"
McManus said, "but it's been like a
180-degree turnaround. That's the
case for a lot of people who, like me,

end up here as a result of bad Draw
numbers but then realize that they
like co-ops and want to stay."
McManus said that Terra residents
will "definitely" petition for self-op
status if they cannot remain a co-op.
Conklin said, "It remains to be
seen whether the change will help to
fill Terra or not. We've no idea what
the problem is, whether it's the name
or the co-op-ness, but this is a hy

pothesis we've got to test."
"With outreach and this moderate
change, this problem might well he
solved," Whitney said. "The commit
tee considered the possibility of let
ting a decision on the co-ops go for
one more year and see how they fare
in the Draw, but everyone agreed
that it's the same problem now that
it's been for a number of years. It's
not going to go away, and something
had to be done to address it."
