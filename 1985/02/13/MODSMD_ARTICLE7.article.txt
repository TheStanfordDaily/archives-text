Israel questions Arab agreement
JERUSALEM — Israeli leaders reacted skeptically yesterday to the
agreement between Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser
Arafat and Jordan's King Hussein to jointly pursue "a just solution of
the Middle East crisis."
"It's still unclear what they did in Amman," said Prime Minister
Shimon Peres of the accord the two Arab leaders said Monday that they
had reached.
"First of all, we'll see what they agreed between them — if they
agreed to make peace between themselves, or if they want peace with Is
rael," Peres remarked in response to pupils' questions during a tour of a
high school near Haifa.
Israel's litmus test of any Middle East peace proposal is acceptance of
U.N. Security Council Resolution 242, which recognizes Israel's right to
exist within secure borders.
Hussein in November proposed a joint Jordanian-Palestinian peace
initiative including Resolution 242, but there was no evidence yesterday
that whatever pact he reached with Arafat mentioned the controversial
resolution.
"The question is whether what we hear (about the Arafat-Hussein
agreement) is all there is," a senior Israeli politician said yesterday. "If it
is, then there is no (mention of) 242."
And if the resolution is not mentioned? "Then nothing happened,"
the source replied.
The Palestinians have rejected the resolution because it does not rec
ognize them as a legitimate nation, referring to them instead as merely a
refugee problem.
"I have the impression that Hussein gave in to Arafat," Israeli
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said in an interview with the Israeli
urmy's radio station. "That is a preliminary impression and therefore it
does not constitute, at least as far as things appear at the moment, any
sort of change which really makes possible a significant turning point."
Poland plans secret police shakeup
WARSAW, Poland — A government spokesman confirmed yester
day that a major shakeup was under way in the section of the secret
police involved in the murder of a Roman Catholic priest.
The spokesman, Jerzy Urban, said the reorganization involves De
partment IV of the Polish Interior Ministry, the department that has
been responsible for surveillance of Catholic church activities^
"... Department IV has been divided into two different departments
and there are new directors now," Urban said at his weekly news confer
ence.
He said that Gen. Zenon Platek, head of the department at the time,
three of its members kidnapped and killed Father Jerzy Popieluszko on
Oct. 19, was still suspended from all duties and that "a personnel
review" was continuing within the Interior Ministry.
Urban said that Col. Leszek Wolski of the Warsaw regional office of
the Polish secret police also remained under suspension.
Platek and Wolski both testified at the trial of four secret-police offi
cers convicted last week in Popieluszko's murder. The fourth officer was
a colonel convicted of aiding and abetting the crime.
Premier Wojciech Jaruzelski told a meeting of the Communist Party
Central Committee in December that an extensive personnel review was
being conducted within the ministry and that it would continue for some
time. Jaruzelski also assumed personal control of security matters within
the Politburo.
There wjere unconfirmed reports yesterday, mainly from government
sources speaking privately, indicating that at least 100 secret-police offi
cers have been replaced since the Popieluszko murder. Urban, speaking
at his weekly news conference, repeated an earlier assertion that there
would be no detailed explanation of the Interior Ministry shakeup.
Soviets confirm Chernenko illness
MOSCOW — Soviet officials confirmed yesterday that President
Konstantin Chernenko is ill and said he canceled a scheduled meeting
with Greek Premier Andreas Papandreou, a Greek government spokes
man said. Chernenko has not made a public appearance in nearly seven
weeks.
A Soviet Foreign Ministry official said Chernenko, who came to
power a year ago today after the death of Yuri Andropov, was out of
town "on vacation" and that there would be no meeting.
Greek government spokesman Dimitrios Maroudas later told a news
conference that a planned meeting today between Papandreou and the
73-year-old Soviet leader had been canceled by Soviet officials who said
Chernenko was sick.
"The planned meeting of the premier of Greece with the general sec
retary of the Soviet Communist Party could not take place due to the ill
ness of Mr. Chernenko," Maroudas said.
He declined to say how much advance notice was given.
Asked if the delegation was given any details about Chernenko,
Maroudas said: "We have no such curiosity."
Earlier, the Foreign Ministry official told The Associated Press: "Mr.
Chernenko is not in Moscow. He is in the country. He is on vacation."
Maroudas said, "These two things do not necessarily contradict each
other. He could be ill and out of town at the same time."
Chernenko's health has been the subject of persistent speculation
since he took office on Feb. 13, 1984, including reports that he has em
physema. He has displayed obvious breathing difficulties when speaking
in public.
Iraq claims attack on tanker
BAGHDAD, Iraq — Iraq said last night its warplanes had
struck "a very large naval target" in the gulf a few hours after one of its
jets fired a missile into a Greek supertanker.
No immediate corroboration on the latest attack could be obtained
from independent shipping sources, who earlier confirmed the attack on
the Liberian-registered Greek ship Fellowship L.
A military statement broadcast over Baghdad radio said the second
attack occurred "near Kharg Island," Iran's main oil export terminal,
less than eight hours after the first attack in the same vicinity.
The raid on the supertanker was the 30th claimed by Iraq since the
beginning of this year and the third against Greek tankers. It was
believed here to have been intended to show that the Iraqis were capable
of disrupting an "oil export shuttle service" launched by Iran in the Per
sian Gulf last week.
Gulf shipping sources confirmed that an Iraqi missile left a hole in the
Fellowship L as it was steaming in the gulf with a full load of Iranian
crude oil.
The attack occurred between Kharg and the Island of Sirri, from
which Iran launched its new oil shuttle service, supposedly away from
the air attacks that had battered shippers coming into Kharg Island.
After the attack, the Fellowship L headed to the United Arab
Emirates for repairs. No casualties were reported.
Iraq announced, meanwhile, that it had advanced more than four
miles inside Iran's borders in a two-pronged blitz attack in the early
hours yesterday.
Pinochet fires 2 cabinet members
SANTIAGO, Chile — President Augusto Pinochet yesterday fired
two leading civilian Cabinet members who had urged him not to renew
the state of siege he has used to crack down on the political opposition.
The entire 16-member Cabinet resigned Monday at Pinochet's re
quest. He reappointed 14 members yesterday, 10 days after the state of
siege was renewed, but dismissed Interior Minister Sergio Onofre Jarpa
and Finance Minister Luis Escobar. Four of the reappointed ministers
are military officers.
Jarpa and Escobar, both conservatives, had argued privately against
the 90-day renewal of the state of siege, which bans opposition news
media and political activity. Pinochet, an army generai, decreed the
emergency measure 6 to quell political violence and demonstra
tions calling for a swift return to democracy.
Pinochet, 69. took power in a September 1973 coup against the
elected government of Marxist President Salvador Allende and has
vowed to stay in office until at least 1989.
