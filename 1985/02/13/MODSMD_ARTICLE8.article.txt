# Goldwater to reduce budget
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — In an apparent
breakthrough in Senate budget deliberations, Sen.
Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.) chairman of the Armed
Services Committee, has agreed to trim about $33
billion from President Reagan's defense spending
request over the next three years, congressional
aides said yesterday.
Goldwater, who had previously opposed any cuts
in Reagan's defense budget, now has told Senate
Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-Kan.) that he
could support cutting Reagan's defense budget by
$2.1 billion in fiscal 1986, $9.2 billion in 1987 and
$21.8 billion in 1988, according to a spokesman for
Dole. Neither Dole nor Goldwater could be
reached for comment.
Goldwater's proposal still would allow for annual
increases in defense spending of 4 percent after in
flation. Reagan's fiscal 1986 budget, which he sub
mitted to Congress last week, calls for an increase
in Pentagon spending of 5.9 percent in 1986 and
projected increases of 8.2 percent in 1987 and 8.8
percent in 1988.
Although Goldwater's plan falls far short of
Dole's original goal to trim $20 billion from the
1986 defense budget, Dale Tate, Dole's spokes

man, described the offer as a good "starting point"
for further negotiations. She noted that it was the
first time Goldwater had agreed to any cuts in
defense spending.
Another Senate budget aide, who spoke on the
condition that he not be identified, noted that while
Goldwater's proposal would contribute little to
deficit reduction in 1986, it would help Dole sub
stantially in his quest for $100 billion in budget
savings over the next three years.
Since early January, Dole and other Senate
Republicans have been struggling to put together a
package of budget cuts that would f.rim Reagan's
projected deficits of nearly $200 billion in each of
the next three years. Until now, Goldwater's oppo
sition to defense cuts has been the principal stum
bling block in the negotiations.
Senate aides said Goldwater indicated his sup
port for the defense cuts would be contingent upon
the successful negotiation of an overall deficit re
duction package, including substantial cuts in
domestic spending as well as a freeze in Social Se
curity benefits.
Senate aides noted that, unlike the budget

cutting suggestions of other committee chairmen,
Goldwater s proposal has not been presented in
written form. Tate said that the Armed Services
Committee chairman simply made an oral offer to
begin searching the budget tor cuts in the $33 bil
lion range over three years. The figures could
change when negotiations resume next week, she
said.
Some Senate Republicans have been advocating
an overall freeze in defense spending, but GOP
leaders have been backing away from that idea in
recent days on grounds that it would undermine the
U.S. commitment to NATO to increase real
defense spending by 3 percent each year. Senate
leaders also fear that the Democratic-controlled
House will try to trim more from the defense
budget when it comes up for consideration in that
chamber.
Aides said Goldwater and the Senate GOP
leaders would not meet again to discuss the defense
budget until next week, alter the Congress returns
from its current recess. In recent meetings, accord
ing to aides, the Senate GOP leaders have put
heavy pressure on Goldwater to agree to cuts in
defense.
