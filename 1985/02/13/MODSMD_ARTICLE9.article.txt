# Korean ruling party wins election

### 
SEOUL, South Korea, — Presi
dent Chun Doo Hwan's ruling party
won as expected today in National
Assembly elections here but a new
opposition party supported by Kim
Dae Jung, Chun's purged political
enemy, emerged as the No. 1 anti
government force.
In the direct election part of the
voting, the ruling Democratic Justice
Party won 88 assembly seats, two
fewer than in the last election four
years ago, and the New Korea Demo
cratic Party, which was organized
only 25 days before yesterday's bal
loting, collected 47. Just over 84 per
cent of the voters cast ballots in the
country's 92 two-seat assembly elec
tion districts.
The opposition party made espe
cially strong showings in both of the
nation's major cities — Seoul and
Pusan — as well as in Kwangju, the
site of a bloody 1980 anti-Chun
rebellion in which 189 persons were
killed. Before the election, even the
party's own leaders had said that its
best possible showing would be vic
tories in "more than 30" of the direct
election contests.
With the "proportional representa
tion" seats added, Chun's ruling party
wound up with 149 seats, a majority
of 11 in the 276-seat unicameral as
sembly. The New Korea Democratic

Party finished with 64, while the
former leading opposition party, the
Democratic Korea Party, received 32
and the Korea National Party got 24.
Although both Kim, 61, the oppo
sition candidate in South Korea's last
free and open presidential election in
1971, and Kim Young Sam, 57, an
other former opposition leader,
remain purged by Chun from par
ticipating in politics, candidates of the
New Korea Democratic Party openly
declared their support for the two
Kims.
The two purged politicians, who
are not related, are listed as advisers
to the new hard-line party, which
campaigned on a platform of ending
what it called "military dictatorship"
and restoring democracy to South
Korea.
The New Korea Democratic Party
promises to criticize Chun
vociferously in the National Assem
bly, whose term will continue through
March 1989, one year after Chun's
constitutionally limited one term
comes to an end.
One source, who asked not to be
identified, said that government offi
cials are "alarmed" by the strong
showing by the party supported by
the two purged Kims.
Alarming as the surge of the new

opposition party may have been to
Chun's ruling Democratic Justice
Party, its strong showing itself ap
peared to reaffirm the new level of
freedom that Chun permitted both
for the campaign and the vote
counting.
One foreign observer said that the
campaign, during which "voters
heard things they haven't heard for
years," represented "real progress
toward greater democracy."
During the 20-day campaign, Chun
was widely condemned, both in poli
tical rallies and in the mass media,
which reported opposition candi
dates' comments, for running a
"military dictatorship" and for
"politics of violence and repression."
Lee Min Woo, 70, president of the
new opposition party, however,
accused the government even before
the ballot counting was finished with
carrying out "the most illicit election
in the history of the nation's constitu
tional rule."
He charged that his party had de
tected evidence of 300 cases of illegal
or unfair campaign practices, includ
ing use of government bureaucrats
and executives of state-run corpora
tions to campaign for ruling party
candidates.
The effect of Kim Dae Jung's

return from a two-year exile in the
United States last Friday was difficult
to measure.
Kim said he believed that his
homecoming would encourage sup
porters of the new opposition party,
but news of the fracas involving
police, Kim, and 22 of his American
supporters at the airport and the en
suing American government criticism
of South Korea was censored here.
Kim, whose 20-year jail term on a
sedition conviction has been
suspended, was placed under limited
house arrest Friday and has not left
his home since.
The voter turnout, which was the
highest in 25 years, was due, at least
in part, to favorable weather. Mild
temperatures and overcast skies
prevailed through most of the nation
yesterday with only light rain in scat
tered areas during the late afternoon.
Very windy, too.
Chun is expected to soon form a
new Cabinet and appoint new offi
cials of his ruling party, both routine
moves after an election.
The Cabinet shuffle is expected to
result in the naming of a new prime
minister to replace Chin lee Chong,
who made his first public appearance
yesterday to cast his ballot since suf
fering a stroke Nov. 1. Chin has been
on sick leave since then.
