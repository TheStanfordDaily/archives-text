# Human rights status pleases State Dept.

WASHINGTON — The State De
partment noted a "very strong and
impressive trend" toward democracy
in Latin America in its annual report
on human rights released yesterday
and said the situation in Korea has
improved as well.
"Continued improvement in the
Western Hemisphere was the only
significant overall trend," Elliott
Abrams, assistant secretary for
human rights, said in releasing the
report on 164 countries. He cited the
recent return to civilian government
in Brazil, the inaugural next month of
an elected civilian president in
Uruguay, the elections in Grenada,
the promise of elections for a civilian
government in Guatemala later this
year "and a really significant
downturn in death-squad killings and
disappearances" in El Salvador.
He called Chile "the greatest dis
appointment" in the Western hemis
phere because the military govern
ment there has halted "the move
toward a return to democratic gov
ernment" and increased "the degree
of political repression." Abrams also
expressed concern about the contin
ued instability stemming from the
civil war in El Salvador, and he ac
knowledged that the level of violence
in Guatemala remains high.
Nevertheless, Abrams noted, "In

the last five years, nine countries of
the hemisphere have moved to
democracy from dictatorship and
zero countries have gone from
democracy to dictatorship."
The report's findings as to
countries that have figured in rights
controversies include:
• Israel. Although Israel is an "open
democracy" with "strong respect for
civil rights," its military occupation of
the West Bank and Gaza Strip con
tinues to cause strains in relations
with the Palestinian inhabitants of
these territories.
• South Africa. "Despite the
gradualist reform process seen in
recent years . . . the black African
majority continues to be denied the
basic rights of citizenship" and blacks
are still subject to a variety of arbi
trary detention measures and other
rules severely limiting their political,
social and economic development."
• Nicaragua. Under the leftist Sandi
nista government, 1984 saw a greater
denial of basic political rights and re
strictions on the press and the free ex
ercise of religion. The report also
notes Sandinista charges that its
"contra" guerrilla opponents, which
had the financial backing of the
United States until last year, have en
gaged in murder, kidnapping and in
timidation of civilians.
