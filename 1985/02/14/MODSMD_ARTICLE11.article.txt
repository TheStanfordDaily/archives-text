## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The United
States and Soviet Union, stepping
up their dialogue on troubled
regions of the world, plan to hold
talks in Vienna, Austria, begin
ning Tuesday on the Arab-Israeli
conflict and other difficult issues,
an administration source said yes
terday.
Also on the agenda is the was
between Iran and Iraq and the
presence of more than 100,000 so
viet troops in Afghanistan.
Richard Murphy, assistant sec
retary of state for the Near East, is
expected to head the U.S. delega
tion.
The talks are part of a Reagan
administration effort to work out a
better relationship with Moscow,
as pledged by the president in a
speech last September at the
United Nations.
Reagan, preparing to leave the
White house by helicopter for a
California vacation, was asked
what he hoped to get from the
talks in Vienna with the Soviets,
and replied:
"There are a number of things
that I think are of interest to both
countries and . . . there's some

reason to believe that we can
straighten out some things —
trade matters."
Partly to ease Israeli concerns,
U.S. officials have emphasized
there is no plan to call a confer
ence on the Middle East and give
the Soviets a major role in seeking
an overall settlement.
The Soviets generally side with
the Arabs against Israel and have
no diplomatic relations with
Jerusalem.
On a trip here last week,
however, Egyptian Foreign Mini
ster Esmat Abdel-Meguid, reflect
ing Cairo's growing ties with the
Soviets, endorsed the idea of such
a conference.
The administration has a strong
interest, meanwhile, in trying to
persuade the soviets to reduce
their presence in Afghanistan.
Moslem rebels in the country have
been fighting a bloody battle
against soviet troops since 1979.
An Afghan settlement could
center on U.S. acceptance of So
viet influence in the country,
which lies along the Soviet border,
coupled with a troop pullback.
