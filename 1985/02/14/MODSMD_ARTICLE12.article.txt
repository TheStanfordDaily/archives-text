'Disinvestment' sought
WASHINGTON — Budget Director David
Stockman, who has been resisting pressure to
provide additional relief for credit-squeezed
farmers, said yesterday that many growers will be
forced out of business in the coming shakeout but
"that is the way a dynamic economy works."
The Office of Management and Budget direc
tor, in the latest of a series of blasts at
beneficiaries of federal subsidies, said there is
"overinvestment" in agriculture today and
predicted several years of "disinvestment" in
which acreage is scaled back, farmers reconsider
spending on such things as irrigation and fertil
izer, and many are forced to quit agriculture.
" And it's not nice to talk about and I think you
shouldn't be unsympathetic to the people in
volved," he said. "But, look, we have lost one
fourth of our savings and loan institutions over
the last four years because that structure was no
longer viable in a deregulated financial environ
ment.
"We've probably lost a good 30 to 40 percent
of our auto production workers, at least —
maybe 50 percent; I haven't checked — relative
to late 1978, because that industry had to adjust,
slim down, modernize and so forth," Stockman
said in a breakfast meeting with reporters.
"So these disinvestments occur at the same
time that these massive explosions of new jobs
and investments are occurring elsewhere, in

Silicon Valley. And if you want an economy that
is productive, that maximizes growth, income,
opportunity over time you have to encourage
both the investment and disinvestment, you've
got have adjustment," he added.
"The government basically is a reactionary in
stitution that tries to foster one and retard the
other and it usually makes a botch of both. That's
why we want to have a kind of hands-off indus
trial policy."
If the budget-cutting by Congress falls short of
the $50 billion goal, Stockman said. "You go
with what you've got." He added that Reagan
"will not support one dime of tax increase."
Stockman also said rumors about his departure
from the administration "ought to be adjusted
for seasonal factors" and that his tenure is
"obviously not indefinite."
Research moving ahead
LONDON —Technical progress in some areas
of research on future anti-missile defenses is
moving faster than many people realize, accord
ing to visiting U.S. government officials.
But two key officials say the White House is
resisting pressure from some quarters to consider
applying the technology to more near-term, lim
ited use — such as defending U.S. land-based of
fensive missile silos from attack — rather than
waiting for the results to come in on President
Reagan's longer-term missile defense research

project, popularly know as "Star Wars."
The officials say the administration realizes
that some portions of the Star Wars technology,
if it works, will be available sooner than others
and could be useful in limited roles.
Aside from possibly defending some existing
U.S. Minuteman ICBM bases or future silos for
the new MX missile, they mention defending
command centers, submarine ports, and a possi
ble mini-defense in Western Europe against
shorter-range Soviet tactical missiles that
threaten allied ports and airfields.
These officials, who asked not to be identified,
say there is growing interest among some civilian
and military circles to consider such moves, espe
cially protection of the MX.
However, they say, administration policy is not
to make early commitments on pursuing such
specific developments because research is
moving so fast that they do not want to risk se
lecting the wrong technology nor fail to explore
all the technologies that are part of what is for
mally called Reagan's Strategic Defense Initia
tive.
