Hospital violations cited
SACRAMENTO — There were four "serious
violations" of state licensing rules at a San Pablo
hospital involved in the controversial death of an
unemployed mechanic last month, a state agency
says.
The Licensing and Certification Division of the
California Department of Health gave Brookside
Hospital until March 1 to come up with a plan to
correct its deficiencies or face suspension or
revocation of its license.
The action against Brookside Hospital is the
result of a state investigation of the circumstances
surrounding the Jan. 31 death of unemployed
mechanic Eugene Barnes, the division said in a
written release yesterday.
Barnes was taken to Brookside's emergency
room with a head injury Jan. 28. After emer
gency room personnel tried unsuccessfully for
more than four hours to locate a neurosurgeon,
Barnes was finally transferred to San Francisco
General Hospital, where he died three days later.
In a terse announcement, the state agency said
Brookside was cited for not having a plan for care
of head and spinal cord injury patients; for not

having a plan for the transfer of patients whose
injuries exceed the capacities of the hospital
staff; for failure to provide neurosurgery care;
and for not reporting the incident to the state as
required.
Utility confirms leak
SAN ON OF RE, Calif. — The core of a highly
radioactive X-ray machine being used to examine
welds was exposed for 36 hours late last week
after a freak accident near Unit 3 of the San
Onofre nuclear power station, utility officials
confirmed yesterday.
Six workers received small exposures of radia
tion as they put the core back into its container
Saturday, said Harold Ray, Southern California
Edison vice president at San Onofre.
Edison spokesman Dave Barron said the acci
dent, in which the bared element emitted poten
tially fatal levels of radiation thoughout the 36
hours, was non-nuclear and could have happened
at any industrial site. Edison owns 80 percent of
the station and San Diego Ga» & Electric Co.
owns 20 percent.

Officials pick dump site
SANTA ROSA, Calif. — City officials want to
dump millions of gallons of wastewater into the
scenic Russian River, which absorbed a weekend
spill of raw sewage estimated at 1.5 million gal
lons.
The city plan calls for allowing more waste
water into the river than the law allows. It
would require the state to order officials to break
the law.
Santa Rosa Mayor Schuyler Jeffries said the
city will drop its plan unless the state "agrees to
our solution and directs us to carry it out."
A regulator for the North Coast Regional
Water Quality Control Board said he favors the
city's plan. State attorneys, however, have
advised him that the board is unable to give the
order the city seeks.
