## Datacom makes parking tickets pay off

around 75, no problem."
Clarke, 32, is one of 16 Stanford
community service officers (CSOs)
whose responsibilities include the
thankless job of citing the owners of
illegally parked vehicles.
A four-year veteran on the
campus, Clarke said parking in red
zones is by far the most common
violation, and the cheapest — $ 10 —
compared to $52 for illegally parking

in a zone reserved for the handi
capped.
Working outdoors in pleasant sur
roundings is one reward of the job,
Clarke said. The drawback is con
fronting a violator with a citation.
"You just have to get used to it,"he
said, referring to occasional hostility
from the public.
Altogether, CSOs issued about
35,000 parking citations last year on
campus, said Stanford Police Capt.
William Wullschleger. Roughly
translated, that means about a half
million dollars, if the collection rate is
100 percent.
The University doesn't get a dime
of that money, however. Santa Clara
County, whose sheriffs department
supplies Stanford with CSOs, pockets
all the fines. The county's collection
rate for Stanford tickets is about 64
percent, which means it netted
around $300,000 in 1984.
The citations used to be processed
by county employees. But in 1980,
Santa Clara County hired Datacom
Systems Corp., a computerized col
lection agency based in New York.
For a percentage of the fines,
Datacom now processes all parking
tickets issued in the county and on
Stanford property.
Datacom personnel in San Jose
were unwilling to comment on the
size of that cut, but according to The

Wall Street Journal, the company
gets as much as "25 percent to 48
percent" when the fines are delin
quent.
The Journal said municipalities
began hiring firms like Datacom in
the late 19705, when officials sought
to crack down on parking violators
and use the fines to balance lopsided
budgets.
Companies like Datacom "use
computers to speed the collection
process and cut staffs, hire non-union
workers to reduce payroll expenses,
negotiate agreements with other

states that ease the task of tracking
out-of-state violators, and even map
out parking patterns of routine
violators and tow their cars away until
they pay up," the Journal reported.
The Datacom techniques caused
collection rates to jump in cities and
counties, more than offsetting the
price charged by the collection
agency. New York City, for instance,
had a collection rate of about 25 per
cent in 1970. With help from
Datacom and 13 other outside
agencies, the rate soared to about 60
percent in 1981.

Santa Clara County officials say
that of the 35,425 parking citations
issued between July 1983 and June
1984 at Stanford, 22,815 — or 64
percent — were paid, adding up to
$201,714.
Stanford paid more than $2 million
for police services last year, and
CSOs justified their share of that ex
pense by citing more than 35,000
vehicles.
But community service officers do
more than hop into Cushman buggies
and stalk parking violators. They pa-

trol dorm areas at night, direct traffic
during athletic events, protect a crime
scene from intruders, investigate
bomb threats and assist patrol offi
cers as needed.
The CSOs and more than 60 tem
porary employees were hard at work
on Super Bowl Sunday, Wullschleger
said. Aside from directing the
monumental traffic and assisting in

crowd control, they spotted a record
49 cars that had to be towed away.
CSOs are "extremely useful," said
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Her
rington, particularly since Stanford
doesn't have enough patrol officers.
Herrington said the night crew
CSOs are "the eyes and ears of the
campus," reporting everything from
the mundane to the serious, from
unlocked doors to fires.
Rivalry or tension between CSOs
and patrol officers at Stanford is non
existent, said CSO supervisor Steve

Janzer, because both groups realize
they are mutually dependent. "It's a
good department. I like to work
here," he said.
So does CSO Keith Bryan, 37, who
refers to himself as a "Cushman offi
cer," after the characteristic buggies
CSOs operate. "I'm an outside per
son. If I didn't like it, 1 wouldn't
stay."

With 16 community service officers patrolling the Stanford campus,
about 35,000 parking tickets are written each year.
