# Snacking students Blue after five years of Fields
##

Over 700 of them arrive by 10:30
a.m., and all of them disappear within
six hours of the same day. Day after
day, week after week.
It doesn't to matter what genre
they are. Indiscriminate students just
keep gobbling them up.
They're cookies. Specifically, the
ones sold in the Candy Jar.
The Candy Jar, located in the Stan
ford Bookstore, used to sell "Mrs.
Fields" cookies, but is now selling
"Blue Chip" cookies instead.
Reasons for the change have been
frequently discussed, albeit not with
tremendous seriousness, around
campus. Some notions fall closer to
the truth than others.
• "The students all seem to think
that we dropped Mrs. Fields— when,
th fact, it's Mrs. Fields that dropped
us," said Linda Snyder, buyer and
director for the Candy Jar.
"She (Fields) also has had business
in a couple of other colleges, but she
felt she was losing some of the quality
of the cookies by not serving them
hot. I guess you could say she's
decided to go back to basics," Snyder
said.

Snyder alluded that the pull out
was due to campus sales being "too
big of a hassle for the Fields Corp."
"It's a proven fact," Snyder said,
"that we've been selling Mrs. Field's
for five years, and they have never
been warm, but they've still sold like
hotcakes."
The Stanford Bookstore was the
first location outside of Liddicoat's in
Palo Alto to sell Mrs. Fields' cookies.
Now Liddicoats is once again the only
local business to sell them, in accor
dance with Fields' wishes: hot, fresh
and right out of the oven.
Many students have indicated,
however, that Blue Chip cookies
stack up at least as high — if not
higher— than Fields.
According to Snyder, several
"serious" sampling sessions were
held, and Blue Chip won out over
several companies, including the
Cookie Stop, the Cookie Habit, Fa
mous Amos and the Ultimate
Cookie.
"What's really interesting, too,"
Snyder explained, "is that the stu
dents were the ones who came and
told us about Blue Chip. I figured
that if people were going all the way
to San Francisco for them that I had

to check these out. . . . Ultimately all
of the other companies we were
looking at came to us with offers, but
with Blue Chip, we went to them."
"Eldon (Speed, manager of the
bookstore) took one bite out of the
cookie and had Blue Chip on the
phone," Snyder said.
She also said that the response to
the new company has been amazing.
"We've sold many more Blue Chip
cookies than we did Mrs. Fields
primarily because there is more vari
ety. Blue Chip has 13 kinds of
cookies ranging from Triple Choco
late or Almond Roca to White Choc
olate Macadamia. If Mrs. Fields put
out more of a variety, they probably
would sell even better, but kids are
getting a little tired of chocolate chip
and oatmeal."
During the first week of promo
tional sales, Blue Chip cookies were
sold for 25 cents each. Since then,
"We have people addicted and under
our spell," according to Megan
Swezey, a Candy Jar salesperson.
Now, however, that "spell" has
people plunking down 60 cents per
cookie.
"I adore the new cookies," Swezey
said, "especially the white chocolate

macadamias."
"Blue Chip cookies are definitely
much better. The taste and texture
are incredible," said another student.
Other students chose to dissent
from popular opinion, though.
"Mrs. Field's were much bigger
and tastier for less money than the
Blue Chip cookies are," said junior

Jeff Schroeder.
Whatever the overall consensus
may be, according to Snyder, the fact
that Blue Chip cookies have attracted
a captive audience is born out in
recent sales.
"We're selling about 720 cookies a
day in less than 6 hours." she said.

"That amount will probably double
on Valentines Day, which is always
our busiest day of the year."
But what Blue Chips do on
Valentines Day may not make much
difference in the scheme of things,
because on any given day at the
bookstore, "It's chaos until they're
gone," Snyder said.
