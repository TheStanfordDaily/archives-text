## The 						Stanford Daily Give them a free meal

Last week's attempt by the Athletic Depart
ment to slip out of a potential violation of NCAA
rules by charging walk-on players for the training
table meals they ate last fall does not serve
justice. Walk-ons should not have to pay for
mistakes made by the Athletic Department.
The department got into trouble by mistakenly
allowing walk-on football players to eat free
meals with scholarship players. Walk-ons are
players who are not on scholarship and, under
NCAA rules, cannot receive any aid from the
Athletic Department unless it directly relates to
their sport.
The consequences for the players involved,
who were not even aware they were participating
in something violating NCAA rules, are not in
significant. Each of the 11 players who took
meals last fall has been asked by the department
to pay at least $272 by the end of this school year.
This is not an equitable solution to the depart
ment's mix-up.
Athletic Director Andy Geiger was closer to
being on the path to fairness when he claimed re
sponsibility for the mix-up.

Geiger said, "I'm responsible. ... If you want
to write-up someone for being responsible, it's
me. I'm the guy in charge." Geiger is right, but
accepting responsibility means paying the price.
Not to suggest that Geiger should personally
pay for the meals consumed by the walk-ons, but
that approach would be better than the current
solution.
A more equitable solution would have the
Athletic Department telling the NCAA a mistake
has been made and indicating the University will
now accept whatever punishment the NCAA
decides to mete out. This is the only just solution.
Stanford's athletic program has a good reputa
tion with the NCAA, and this violation
is but an atom in the large mass of violations that
occur each year at other NCAA-affiliated
schools.
When schools like the University of Florida,
which have a much more extensive record of vio
lations than Stanford, are placed on only one year
of probation for more than a hundred violations,
Stanford has little to fear from being cited for this
incident.
