# They used to be great, but I hate them now

### 
Now that the Super Bowl is over, there
should be little doubt about why professional
football is having money problems. For every
one except the most vengeful 49er fans and
the select few who had the privilege of seeing
it in person, the game was probably as
suspenseful as dropping a rock from the top of
a cliff and watching it fall. This was the much
heralded confrontation of the NFL's two best
teams? Please.
But perhaps I judge too harshly. Even
though the game will never rank as a classic, it
wasn't any more or less thrilling than any reg
ular season contest. Of course, it wasn't a reg
ular season game; it was the Super Bowl, that
paragon of professional sports events, that
nationwide orgy of athlete worship, that TV
ratings monster. A certain mystique clings to
the Super Bowl. Fans are supposed to behave
more and more like real fanatics as kickoff
time draws near; entire cities are supposed to
erupt into mad celebration when their team
triumphs; presidents are supposed to
postpone their inaugurations in deference to
the game (perhaps we should be thankful for
the latter fringe benefit).
It is staggering to realize that on Sunday,
Jan. 20, almost every human being in the na
tion capable of speech and hearing said or
heard something about the Super Bowl. And
yet when it was all over, you looked at the
scoreboard and wished thar3B-I6 didn't"tell
the whole story. It did, though; the game was
every bit as dull as the score looks. But then
you ask yourself: How could any mere game
live up to all the excitement and expectations
surrounding the Super Bowl? All of us who
were disappointed by the not-quite-Super
Bowl probably shouldn't have been. We
didn't have any really good reason to expect
the Sports Spectator Rapture. The Bowl was a
game, just as promised, and we just happen to
be victims of the dreaded post-hype letdown.
Post-hype letdown is rapidly gaining on the
common cold for honors as America's most
übiquitous ailment. You hear people com
plaining about the illness in the street.
Recently I overheard a student remark to his
friends, "I am so sick of Michael Jackson. I

used to like him — until he became popular."
He and everyone else; we've all got Jackson
burnout.
Even my sister, who had an uncanny power
to sense Michael's presence across the
airwaves and always switched to MTV in time
to catch his videos, has abandoned him. She
has a new hero: Prince. She and everyone
else. Presumably Prince, too, will suffer the

punishment for superstardom and be con
demned to the limbo of the Once-Liked-But-
Now-Popular.
It's no secret that once a talented musician
goes commercial, some of his special appeal is
lost. This is just a manifestation of a larger
sociological phenomenon. We Americans
have a penchant for finding something we like
and blowing it up to superhuman proportions
so that we can all love it, whereupon we all
start finding reasons to hate it. Consequently,
we lurch from one post-hype letdown to an
other.
There's a lesson here for everyone who
becomes a superstar or who comes up with a
celebrated product, or novel, or film, or song
or idea, and especially for anyone who
markets or invests in the above. In the United
States, popularity breeds contempt. We loved
Carl Lewis before the Olympics, but no
sooner had he delivered exactly what every
one said he would and done so in the only
manner he felt he could than half the nation
was grumbling about how lacking a human
being he is. For a people who clamor for ex
cellence all the time, we certainly do a terrible
job of rewarding it.

Much of our schizophrenic treatment of the
Lewis' of the world is, of course, the result of
mass media hype. Michael Jackson is an ex
tremely talented singer and entertainer, and is
rightly recognized as such. None of that has
anything whatever to do with his alleged cos
metic surgery, his personality quirks, his
eating habits or his sexual preferences or lack
thereof.
It's hardly necessary to know all these tid
bits of information to appreciate the man's
music, but once it became clear that
"Thriller" was going to break numerous in
dustry records, the hype mill started dissemi
nating all the aforementioned critical facts
and more — much more. (Tell me, who really
wanted to know that Mike drinks carrot juice
instead of Pepsi?)
Jackson's is the classic case of too much of a
good thing being no good. The same principle
applies to Prince, Carl Lewis, the Smurfs and
the biggest offender of all, E.T. Who couldn't
learn to hate the little creature after being
blitzed with its likeness 24 hours a day? And
now that my revulsion for Spielberg's ex
traterrestrial has faded and I can confine my
violent reaction to his Gremlins to a few mut
tered obscenities, I have to contend with
watching every conceivable issue or idea get
converted into something-busters —
Reaganbusters, Fritzbusters, taxbusters,
Dolphinbusters and everything but all-this
busting-stuff-busters.
What is this? What is it about Americans
that we feel it necessary to destroy every
clever idea or outstanding achievement
through overexposure? Why do we rush
headlong into post-hype letdown at the
slightest provocation? The media have to take
the lion's share of the blame, but I think the
American public is culpable, too. There
would be no hype if hype didn't sell.
Sometimes the media don't even have to sell
hype. We do it ourselves if they don't do it
for us. How often, do you hype places you've
been, movies you've seen and experiences
you've had? "Oh, it was great\" you say, even
if it was only good. Then since everything
halfway decent is called great these days, you

have to make it really great, so you lie some
more until you've practically described the
Second Coming and the recreation of the
Universe done with lasers. (Later, you ask
your friend how he liked it; he smiles wanly
and replies with deep conviction, "It was nice;
I like it.")
I suspect that much of this phenomenon is a
consequence of a mass, democratic society
existing in a world where technology — espe
cially communications — contributes daily to
homogeneous tastes and lifestyles. We can all
discuss the latest happenings on "Dynasty,"
share in the humor when someone blurts out,
"Where's the beef?" and recite Trivial Pur-

Presumably Prince,
too, will suffer the
punishment for super
stardom and be con
demned to the limbo
of the Once-Liked-
But-Now-Popular.

suit questions to one another. In such a cul
ture of mass experience, it is little wonder that
we rush at the least spark of creativity or ex
cellence like a horde of starving beggars,
yearning for something different, something
new, something worthy of a trend.
In our zeal to commune with whatever it is
we learn to adore, we pick it apart, reproduce it
and distribute ad nauseam until we have
become so familiar with it that nothing about
it can awe or excite us. The mentality behind

this process is slightly pathetic. It is as if in our
collective mediocrity we revere excellence
or originality more than ever but, because we
cannot understand these qualities, we resent
their uniqueness.
If it is a great talent we admire, we strive
unceasingly to find reasons to degrade and
criticize the possessor of the talent. ("Sure,
Carl Lewis is a great athlete; but I hear he's
gay, too.") If it is an idea or a product which
strikes us as particularly appealing, we strip jt
of its uniqueness by replicating it on a colossal
scale. It is not enough to think Smurfs are
cute; we must have comic books, cartoons,
stuffed pillows, bedsheets, toys, posters,
figurines, parade floats and, God forgive us,
cereals of Smurfs, too. There is a perverse sort
of democracy to it all. If there's something
special out there, then by God, we all better
have access to it or we'll see to it that whoever
has it doesn't enjoy it. And in the best tradi
tion of consumerism, once we get it and enjby
it for awhile, we can discard it, like toilet
paper.
Of course, hype and its consequences do
not rank as one of society's major problems.
We have nuclear arms, racism, sexism,
poverty, famine, crime, cancer, Ronald
Reagan and a host of other unpleasant things
to occupy our minds. It may well be that hype
and what-is-hyped serve as a refreshing, al
beit temporary, respite from the aforemen
tioned woes of the world, and if we manage to
preserve a shred of our collective sanity by
repeatedly entering love-hype-hate affairs
with cinematic fantasies, perhaps post-hype
letdown is a small price to pay. Maybe we
should get ecstatic about an annual football
game and buy all sorts of useless trinkets com
memorating it and pay hundreds of dollars for
tickets to it and throw parties for it and gener
ally behave foolishly over it. Maybe we should
tolerate our flagrant abuse of superlatives like
"great." Who knows? If we're lucky, maybe
all this hype is itself a trend, and sooner or
later we'll learn to hate it, too.

rightly recognized as such. None of that has
anything whatever to do with his alleged cos
metic surgery, his personality quirks, his
eating habits or his sexual preferences or lack
thereof.
It's hardly necessary to know all these tid
bits of information to appreciate the man's
music, but once it became clear that
"Thriller" was going to break numerous in
dustry records, the hype mill started dissemi
nating all the aforementioned critical facts
and more — much more. (Tell me, who really
wanted to know that Mike drinks carrot juice
instead of Pepsi?)
Jackson's is the classic case of too much of a
good thing being no good. The same principle
applies to Prince, Carl Lewis, the Smurfs and
the biggest offender of all, E.T. Who couldn't
learn to hate the little creature after being
blitzed with its likeness 24 hours a day? And
now that my revulsion for Spielberg's ex
traterrestrial has faded and I can confine my
violent reaction to his Gremlins to a few mut
tered obscenities, I have to contend with
watching every conceivable issue or idea get
converted into something-busters —
Reaganbusters, Fritzbusters, taxbusters,
Dolphinbusters and everything but all-this
busting-stuff-busters.
What is this? What is it about Americans
that we feel it necessary to destroy every
clever idea or outstanding achievement
through overexposure? Why do we rush
headlong into post-hype letdown at the
slightest provocation? The media have to take
the lion's share of the blame, but I think the
American public is culpable, too. There
would be no hype if hype didn't sell.
Sometimes the media don't even have to sell
hype. We do it ourselves if they don't do it
for us. How often, do you hype places you've
been, movies you've seen and experiences
you've had? "Oh, it was great\" you say, even
if it was only good. Then since everything
halfway decent is called great these days, you

have to make it really great, so you lie some
more until you've practically described the
Second Coming and the recreation of the
Universe done with lasers. (Later, you ask
your friend how he liked it; he smiles wanly
and replies with deep conviction, "It was nice;
I like it.")
I suspect that much of this phenomenon is a
consequence of a mass, democratic society
existing in a world where technology — espe
cially communications — contributes daily to
homogeneous tastes and lifestyles. We can all
discuss the latest happenings on "Dynasty,"
share in the humor when someone blurts out,
"Where's the beef?" and recite Trivial Pur-

Presumably Prince,
too, will suffer the
punishment for super
stardom and be con
demned to the limbo
of the Once-Liked-
But-Now-Popular.

suit questions to one another. In such a cul
ture of mass experience, it is little wonder that
we rush at the least spark of creativity or ex
cellence like a horde of starving beggars,
yearning for something different, something
new, something worthy of a trend.
In our zeal to commune with whatever it is
we learn to adore, we pick it apart, reproduce it
and distribute ad nauseam until we have
become so familiar with it that nothing about
it can awe or excite us. The mentality behind

this process is slightly pathetic. It is as if in our
collective mediocrity we revere excellence
or originality more than ever but, because we
cannot understand these qualities, we resent
their uniqueness.
If it is a great talent we admire, we strive
unceasingly to find reasons to degrade and
criticize the possessor of the talent. ("Sure,
Carl Lewis is a great athlete; but I hear he's
gay, too.") If it is an idea or a product which
strikes us as particularly appealing, we strip jt
of its uniqueness by replicating it on a colossal
scale. It is not enough to think Smurfs are
cute; we must have comic books, cartoons,
stuffed pillows, bedsheets, toys, posters,
figurines, parade floats and, God forgive us,
cereals of Smurfs, too. There is a perverse sort
of democracy to it all. If there's something
special out there, then by God, we all better
have access to it or we'll see to it that whoever
has it doesn't enjoy it. And in the best tradi
tion of consumerism, once we get it and enjby
it for awhile, we can discard it, like toilet
paper.
Of course, hype and its consequences do
not rank as one of society's major problems.
We have nuclear arms, racism, sexism,
poverty, famine, crime, cancer, Ronald
Reagan and a host of other unpleasant things
to occupy our minds. It may well be that hype
and what-is-hyped serve as a refreshing, al
beit temporary, respite from the aforemen
tioned woes of the world, and if we manage to
preserve a shred of our collective sanity by
repeatedly entering love-hype-hate affairs
with cinematic fantasies, perhaps post-hype
letdown is a small price to pay. Maybe we
should get ecstatic about an annual football
game and buy all sorts of useless trinkets com
memorating it and pay hundreds of dollars for
tickets to it and throw parties for it and gener
ally behave foolishly over it. Maybe we should
tolerate our flagrant abuse of superlatives like
"great." Who knows? If we're lucky, maybe
all this hype is itself a trend, and sooner or
later we'll learn to hate it, too.

Now that the Super Bowl is over, there
should be little doubt about why professional
football is having money problems. For every
one except the most vengeful 49er fans and
the select few who had the privilege of seeing
it in person, the game was probably as
suspenseful as dropping a rock from the top of
a cliff and watching it fall. This was the much
heralded confrontation of the NFL's two best
teams? Please.
But perhaps I judge too harshly. Even
though the game will never rank as a classic, it
wasn't any more or less thrilling than any reg
ular season contest. Of course, it wasn't a reg
ular season game; it was the Super Bowl, that
paragon of professional sports events, that
nationwide orgy of athlete worship, that TV
ratings monster. A certain mystique clings to
the Super Bowl. Fans are supposed to behave
more and more like real fanatics as kickoff
time draws near; entire cities are supposed to
erupt into mad celebration when their team
triumphs; presidents are supposed to
postpone their inaugurations in deference to
the game (perhaps we should be thankful for
the latter fringe benefit).
It is staggering to realize that on Sunday,
Jan. 20, almost every human being in the na
tion capable of speech and hearing said or
heard something about the Super Bowl. And
yet when it was all over, you looked at the
scoreboard and wished thar3B-I6 didn't"tell
the whole story. It did, though; the game was
every bit as dull as the score looks. But then
you ask yourself: How could any mere game
live up to all the excitement and expectations
surrounding the Super Bowl? All of us who
were disappointed by the not-quite-Super
Bowl probably shouldn't have been. We
didn't have any really good reason to expect
the Sports Spectator Rapture. The Bowl was a
game, just as promised, and we just happen to
be victims of the dreaded post-hype letdown.
Post-hype letdown is rapidly gaining on the
common cold for honors as America's most
übiquitous ailment. You hear people com
plaining about the illness in the street.
Recently I overheard a student remark to his
friends, "I am so sick of Michael Jackson. I

used to like him — until he became popular."
He and everyone else; we've all got Jackson
burnout.
Even my sister, who had an uncanny power
to sense Michael's presence across the
airwaves and always switched to MTV in time
to catch his videos, has abandoned him. She
has a new hero: Prince. She and everyone
else. Presumably Prince, too, will suffer the

punishment for superstardom and be con
demned to the limbo of the Once-Liked-But-
Now-Popular.
It's no secret that once a talented musician
goes commercial, some of his special appeal is
lost. This is just a manifestation of a larger
sociological phenomenon. We Americans
have a penchant for finding something we like
and blowing it up to superhuman proportions
so that we can all love it, whereupon we all
start finding reasons to hate it. Consequently,
we lurch from one post-hype letdown to an
other.
There's a lesson here for everyone who
becomes a superstar or who comes up with a
celebrated product, or novel, or film, or song
or idea, and especially for anyone who
markets or invests in the above. In the United
States, popularity breeds contempt. We loved
Carl Lewis before the Olympics, but no
sooner had he delivered exactly what every
one said he would and done so in the only
manner he felt he could than half the nation
was grumbling about how lacking a human
being he is. For a people who clamor for ex
cellence all the time, we certainly do a terrible
job of rewarding it.

Much of our schizophrenic treatment of the
Lewis' of the world is, of course, the result of
mass media hype. Michael Jackson is an ex
tremely talented singer and entertainer, and is
rightly recognized as such. None of that has

cute; we must have comic books, cartoons,
stuffed pillows, bedsheets, toys, posters,
figurines, parade floats and, God forgive us,
cereals of Smurfs, too. There is a perverse sort
of democracy to it all. If there's something
special out there, then by God, we all better
have access to it or we'll see to it that whoever
has it doesn't enjoy it. And in the best tradi
tion of consumerism, once we get it and enjby
it for awhile, we can discard it, like toilet
paper.
Of course, hype and its consequences do
not rank as one of society's major problems.
We have nuclear arms, racism, sexism,
poverty, famine, crime, cancer, Ronald
Reagan and a host of other unpleasant things
to occupy our minds. It may well be that hype
and what-is-hyped serve as a refreshing, al
beit temporary, respite from the aforemen
tioned woes of the world, and if we manage to
preserve a shred of our collective sanity by
repeatedly entering love-hype-hate affairs
with cinematic fantasies, perhaps post-hype
letdown is a small price to pay. Maybe we
should get ecstatic about an annual football
game and buy all sorts of useless trinkets com
memorating it and pay hundreds of dollars for
tickets to it and throw parties for it and gener
ally behave foolishly over it. Maybe we should
tolerate our flagrant abuse of superlatives like
"great." Who knows? If we're lucky, maybe
all this hype is itself a trend, and sooner or
later we'll learn to hate it, too.

Now that the Super Bowl is over, there
should be little doubt about why professional
football is having money problems. For every
one except the most vengeful 49er fans and
the select few who had the privilege of seeing
it in person, the game was probably as
suspenseful as dropping a rock from the top of
a cliff and watching it fall. This was the much
heralded confrontation of the NFL's two best
teams? Please.
But perhaps I judge too harshly. Even
though the game will never rank as a classic, it
wasn't any more or less thrilling than any reg
ular season contest. Of course, it wasn't a reg
ular season game; it was the Super Bowl, that
paragon of professional sports events, that
nationwide orgy of athlete worship, that TV
ratings monster. A certain mystique clings to
the Super Bowl. Fans are supposed to behave
more and more like real fanatics as kickoff
time draws near; entire cities are supposed to
erupt into mad celebration when their team
triumphs; presidents are supposed to
postpone their inaugurations in deference to
the game (perhaps we should be thankful for
the latter fringe benefit).
It is staggering to realize that on Sunday,
Jan. 20, almost every human being in the na
tion capable of speech and hearing said or
heard something about the Super Bowl. And
yet when it was all over, you looked at the
scoreboard and wished thar3B-I6 didn't"tell
the whole story. It did, though; the game was
every bit as dull as the score looks. But then
you ask yourself: How could any mere game
live up to all the excitement and expectations
surrounding the Super Bowl? All of us who
were disappointed by the not-quite-Super
Bowl probably shouldn't have been. We
didn't have any really good reason to expect
the Sports Spectator Rapture. The Bowl was a
game, just as promised, and we just happen to
be victims of the dreaded post-hype letdown.
Post-hype letdown is rapidly gaining on the
common cold for honors as America's most
übiquitous ailment. You hear people com
plaining about the illness in the street.
Recently I overheard a student remark to his
friends, "I am so sick of Michael Jackson. I

used to like him — until he became popular."
He and everyone else; we've all got Jackson
burnout.
Even my sister, who had an uncanny power
to sense Michael's presence across the
airwaves and always switched to MTV in time
to catch his videos, has abandoned him. She
has a new hero: Prince. She and everyone
else. Presumably Prince, too, will suffer the

punishment for superstardom and be con
demned to the limbo of the Once-Liked-But-
Now-Popular.
It's no secret that once a talented musician
goes commercial, some of his special appeal is
lost. This is just a manifestation of a larger
sociological phenomenon. We Americans
have a penchant for finding something we like
and blowing it up to superhuman proportions
so that we can all love it, whereupon we all
start finding reasons to hate it. Consequently,
we lurch from one post-hype letdown to an
other.
There's a lesson here for everyone who
becomes a superstar or who comes up with a
celebrated product, or novel, or film, or song
or idea, and especially for anyone who
markets or invests in the above. In the United
States, popularity breeds contempt. We loved
Carl Lewis before the Olympics, but no
sooner had he delivered exactly what every
one said he would and done so in the only
manner he felt he could than half the nation
was grumbling about how lacking a human
being he is. For a people who clamor for ex
cellence all the time, we certainly do a terrible
job of rewarding it.

Much of our schizophrenic treatment of the
Lewis' of the world is, of course, the result of
mass media hype. Michael Jackson is an ex
tremely talented singer and entertainer, and is
rightly recognized as such. None of that has
anything whatever to do with his alleged cos
metic surgery, his personality quirks, his
eating habits or his sexual preferences or lack
thereof.
It's hardly necessary to know all these tid
bits of information to appreciate the man's
music, but once it became clear that
"Thriller" was going to break numerous in
dustry records, the hype mill started dissemi
nating all the aforementioned critical facts
and more — much more. (Tell me, who really
wanted to know that Mike drinks carrot juice
instead of Pepsi?)
Jackson's is the classic case of too much of a
good thing being no good. The same principle
applies to Prince, Carl Lewis, the Smurfs and
the biggest offender of all, E.T. Who couldn't
learn to hate the little creature after being
blitzed with its likeness 24 hours a day? And
now that my revulsion for Spielberg's ex
traterrestrial has faded and I can confine my
violent reaction to his Gremlins to a few mut
tered obscenities, I have to contend with
watching every conceivable issue or idea get
converted into something-busters —
Reaganbusters, Fritzbusters, taxbusters,
Dolphinbusters and everything but all-this
busting-stuff-busters.
What is this? What is it about Americans
that we feel it necessary to destroy every
clever idea or outstanding achievement
through overexposure? Why do we rush
headlong into post-hype letdown at the
slightest provocation? The media have to take
the lion's share of the blame, but I think the
American public is culpable, too. There
would be no hype if hype didn't sell.
Sometimes the media don't even have to sell
hype. We do it ourselves if they don't do it
for us. How often, do you hype places you've
been, movies you've seen and experiences
you've had? "Oh, it was great\" you say, even
if it was only good. Then since everything
halfway decent is called great these days, you

have to make it really great, so you lie some
more until you've practically described the
Second Coming and the recreation of the
Universe done with lasers. (Later, you ask
your friend how he liked it; he smiles wanly
and replies with deep conviction, "It was nice;
I like it.")
I suspect that much of this phenomenon is a
consequence of a mass, democratic society
existing in a world where technology — espe
cially communications — contributes daily to
homogeneous tastes and lifestyles. We can all
discuss the latest happenings on "Dynasty,"
share in the humor when someone blurts out,
"Where's the beef?" and recite Trivial Pur-

Presumably Prince,
too, will suffer the
punishment for super
stardom and be con
demned to the limbo
of the Once-Liked-
But-Now-Popular.

suit questions to one another. In such a cul
ture of mass experience, it is little wonder that
we rush at the least spark of creativity or ex
cellence like a horde of starving beggars,
yearning for something different, something
new, something worthy of a trend.
In our zeal to commune with whatever it is
we learn to adore, we pick it apart, reproduce it
and distribute ad nauseam until we have
become so familiar with it that nothing about
it can awe or excite us. The mentality behind

this process is slightly pathetic. It is as if in our
collective mediocrity we revere excellence
or originality more than ever but, because we
cannot understand these qualities, we resent
their uniqueness.
If it is a great talent we admire, we strive
unceasingly to find reasons to degrade and
criticize the possessor of the talent. ("Sure,
Carl Lewis is a great athlete; but I hear he's
gay, too.") If it is an idea or a product which
strikes us as particularly appealing, we strip jt
of its uniqueness by replicating it on a colossal
scale. It is not enough to think Smurfs are
cute; we must have comic books, cartoons,
stuffed pillows, bedsheets, toys, posters,
figurines, parade floats and, God forgive us,
cereals of Smurfs, too. There is a perverse sort
of democracy to it all. If there's something
special out there, then by God, we all better
have access to it or we'll see to it that whoever
has it doesn't enjoy it. And in the best tradi
tion of consumerism, once we get it and enjby
it for awhile, we can discard it, like toilet
paper.
Of course, hype and its consequences do
not rank as one of society's major problems.
We have nuclear arms, racism, sexism,
poverty, famine, crime, cancer, Ronald
Reagan and a host of other unpleasant things
to occupy our minds. It may well be that hype
and what-is-hyped serve as a refreshing, al
beit temporary, respite from the aforemen
tioned woes of the world, and if we manage to
preserve a shred of our collective sanity by

letdown is a small price to pay. Maybe we
should get ecstatic about an annual football
game and buy all sorts of useless trinkets com
memorating it and pay hundreds of dollars for
tickets to it and throw parties for it and gener
ally behave foolishly over it. Maybe we should
