Phantom petition
There are several corrections that
I would like to make regarding the
following paragraph in a recent
article (The Daily, Feb. 7) on the
Ward group's report concerning joint
appointments between University
departments and the Hoover Institu
tion:
According to The Daily, "Last
spring, a year after 84 faculty mem
bers and 1,500 students called for an
investigation of Hoover's alleged
political activities, 101 faculty mem
bers signed a petition [circulated by
Political Science Prof. John Manley
and English Prof. Ronald Rebholz]
asking for an independent visiting
committee to study the issue."
Actually, in the spring of 1983, the
names of the signers of the Manley-
Rebholz petition were kept secret for
many weeks after it was officially
submitted. Later, when the "no
name" petition got names, only 76 of
the 84 names were made public.
Therefore, I believe fairness and
decency would require that the lower
figure be used.
Regarding the petition signed by
1,500 students, this has never been
made available to the Hoover Insti
tution. and it has not (to my knowl
edge) been authenticated as far as
the number and validity of the
signatures. In May 1983, when I was
Hoover's public affairs coordinator,
a San Francisco TV station asked me
to comment on the petition when it
was allegedly presented to the Stan
ford Board of Trustees. I would not
do so until I had examined it. To this
date, it remains only a "phantom"
petition to me.
With regard to the second Manley-
Rebholz petition with "101 faculty"
names, I recall that quite a few of the
signers were staff or emeriti, possibly
as many as 30.
Also, the article does not mention
the counter petition which had 131

faculty signatures, submitted in May
1983, which deplored and opposed
the investigation of the political
orientation of the Hoover Institu
tion.

Missing ASSU reps
After the many stories I have
heard of the inadequacies of the
ASSU Senate, I had the unfortunate
opportunity, Tueday evening, of
seeing firsthand what an injustice to
the student body the senate really is.
1 think that the senators need to be
reminded that what they supposedly
represent is the Stanford community,
rather than their own narrow inter
ests and opinions.
In particular, I wish to address the
matter of special fee assessments. As
a member of the Axe Committee
whose many requests on Tuesday
were turned down, some may say I
have sour grapes. As a matter of fact
I do, and well I should. With three
organizations still awaiting a vote on
their special fee requests — the Axe
Committee, the Band and The Daily
— there were only 15 voting mem
bers of the Senate present. It takes
13 members of the Senate to ap
prove a fee assessment. As it turned
out, twice during the evening our
proposals were defeated because we
only had 12 votes in favor. We
received 80 percent of the vote and
were still defeated.
I would like to know where those
other five senators were. Did they
feel that the Axe Committee, the
Band and The Daily were not impor
tant enough for their attention? Or
did they feel that the students who
elected them did not care about
these organizations?
Finally, I do not question the
division of the budgets of the Band,
The Daily and the Axe Committee.
This allows the student body to vote

for certain parts of the budget and
not others. As an example, the stu
dents should examine whether
or not they want the Axe Committee
to sponsor a Meganooner. How can
it hurt, however, to allow the stu
dents to decide for themselves what
they want? The senate has made it
less likely that the students will ever
be given the opportunity to decide
by requiring twice as many
signatures for this to come to a vote.
Senators, you are our elected
representatives. You represent us —
the student body. In the future, I ask
you to consider this when you decide
not to attend an important senate
meeting or when you make it harder
for students to have a direct say in
what they get out of this university.

We have apologized. We have
apologized to the public. We have
apologized to the Gay and Lesbian
Alliance at Stanford (GLAS). We
have apologized to the black com
munity. And now we will apologize,
once again, publicly, for our ir
responsible and insensitive behavior
on Jan. 15, when we portrayed the
Segal sculpture in White Plaza.
The point of this letter is not to
defend our actions, because we
accept full responsibility. But the
misrepresentation of fact and The
Daily's failure to report relevant
information regarding this issue
compels us to notify the public as to
the state of affairs and, we hope, to
finally close this belabored issue.
When Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons called for "some kind
of education program or workshop"
in The Daily's front-page article
(Feb. 11), every involved party on
campus knew that we had already
conducted an hour-and-a-half semi
nar on Wednesday, Jan. 30. The

workshop, led by Resident Assistant
Fritz Fischer, addressed such issues
as homophobia and the perceptions
of homosexuals. In our apology to
GLAS, sent the week of our
workshop, we notified them of our
specific plans to conduct the seminar.
Copies of the letter were sent to
Row Director Diana Conklin and
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz. Fur
thermore, The Daily, in its article
(Feb. 11), when reporting Lyons'
request for in-house action, ne
glected to add that it knew of our
completed workshop discussion. The
Daily must have known: One of its
photographers documented the
event. Also, The Daily was notified
on Feb. 10 about the workshop,
when a senior staff writer contacted
SAE President John Peterson for
comments, which were quoted in the
next day's issue.
We would also like to clarify the
point regarding the black commu
nity's alleged "outrage." At 12:45
p.m. on Jan. 15, a half hour after the
incident, two SAE members went to
the Martin Luther King rally in
White Plaza and spoke to the co
ordinator and spokeswoman, where
they extended our apology. She
commented that, personally, she
thought it was in terrible taste and
showed a lack of discretion, but with
regard to the rally, it had not dis
rupted it. Indeed, many had not even
noticed it. She said that she would
not make an issue of the incident and
appreciated our apology.
Now that the facts are recorded,
we have done all that we can do. We
assume full responsibility for our
offensive actions and have tried to
atone for them. We apologized to
the public, and took the corrective
actions even before they were sug
gested. We feel that the issue is now
adequately reported, and we tire of
seeing this dead horse beaten.

their special fee requests — the Axe
Committee, the Band and The Daily
— there were only 15 voting mem
bers of the Senate present. It takes
13 members of the Senate to ap
prove a fee assessment. As it turned
out, twice during the evening our
proposals were defeated because we
only had 12 votes in favor. We
received 80 percent of the vote and
were still defeated.
I would like to know where those
other five senators were. Did they
feel that the Axe Committee, the
Band and The Daily were not impor
tant enough for their attention? Or
did they feel that the students who
elected them did not care about
these organizations?
Finally, I do not question the
division of the budgets of the Band,
The Daily and the Axe Committee.
This allows the student body to vote

for certain parts of the budget and
not others. As an example, the stu
dents should examine whether
or not they want the Axe Committee
to sponsor a Meganooner. How can
it hurt, however, to allow the stu
dents to decide for themselves what
they want? The senate has made it
less likely that the students will ever
be given the opportunity to decide
by requiring twice as many
signatures for this to come to a vote.
Senators, you are our elected
representatives. You represent us —
the student body. In the future, I ask
you to consider this when you decide
not to attend an important senate
meeting or when you make it harder
for students to have a direct say in
what they get out of this university.

We have apologized. We have
apologized to the public. We have
apologized to the Gay and Lesbian
Alliance at Stanford (GLAS). We
have apologized to the black com
munity. And now we will apologize,
once again, publicly, for our ir
responsible and insensitive behavior
on Jan. 15, when we portrayed the
Segal sculpture in White Plaza.
The point of this letter is not to
defend our actions, because we
accept full responsibility. But the
misrepresentation of fact and The
Daily's failure to report relevant
information regarding this issue
compels us to notify the public as to
the state of affairs and, we hope, to
finally close this belabored issue.
When Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons called for "some kind
of education program or workshop"
in The Daily's front-page article
(Feb. 11), every involved party on
campus knew that we had already
conducted an hour-and-a-half semi
nar on Wednesday, Jan. 30. The

workshop, led by Resident Assistant
Fritz Fischer, addressed such issues
as homophobia and the perceptions
of homosexuals. In our apology to
GLAS, sent the week of our
workshop, we notified them of our
specific plans to conduct the seminar.
Copies of the letter were sent to
Row Director Diana Conklin and
English Prof. Ronald Rebholz. Fur
thermore, The Daily, in its article
(Feb. 11), when reporting Lyons'
request for in-house action, ne
glected to add that it knew of our
completed workshop discussion. The
Daily must have known: One of its
photographers documented the
event. Also, The Daily was notified
on Feb. 10 about the workshop,
when a senior staff writer contacted
SAE President John Peterson for
comments, which were quoted in the
next day's issue.
We would also like to clarify the
point regarding the black commu
nity's alleged "outrage." At 12:45
p.m. on Jan. 15, a half hour after the
incident, two SAE members went to
the Martin Luther King rally in
White Plaza and spoke to the co
ordinator and spokeswoman, where
they extended our apology. She
commented that, personally, she
thought it was in terrible taste and
showed a lack of discretion, but with
regard to the rally, it had not dis
rupted it. Indeed, many had not even
noticed it. She said that she would
not make an issue of the incident and
appreciated our apology.
Now that the facts are recorded,
we have done all that we can do. We
assume full responsibility for our
offensive actions and have tried to
atone for them. We apologized to
the public, and took the corrective
actions even before they were sug
gested. We feel that the issue is now
adequately reported, and we tire of
seeing this dead horse beaten.

There are several corrections that
I would like to make regarding the
following paragraph in a recent
article (The Daily, Feb. 7) on the
Ward group's report concerning joint
appointments between University
departments and the Hoover Institu
tion:
According to The Daily, "Last
spring, a year after 84 faculty mem
bers and 1,500 students called for an
investigation of Hoover's alleged
political activities, 101 faculty mem
bers signed a petition [circulated by
Political Science Prof. John Manley
and English Prof. Ronald Rebholz]
asking for an independent visiting
committee to study the issue."
Actually, in the spring of 1983, the
names of the signers of the Manley-
Rebholz petition were kept secret for
many weeks after it was officially
submitted. Later, when the "no
name" petition got names, only 76 of
the 84 names were made public.
Therefore, I believe fairness and
decency would require that the lower
figure be used.
Regarding the petition signed by
1,500 students, this has never been
made available to the Hoover Insti
tution. and it has not (to my knowl
edge) been authenticated as far as
the number and validity of the
signatures. In May 1983, when I was
Hoover's public affairs coordinator,
a San Francisco TV station asked me
to comment on the petition when it
was allegedly presented to the Stan
ford Board of Trustees. I would not
do so until I had examined it. To this
date, it remains only a "phantom"
petition to me.
With regard to the second Manley-
Rebholz petition with "101 faculty"
names, I recall that quite a few of the
signers were staff or emeriti, possibly
as many as 30.
Also, the article does not mention
the counter petition which had 131

faculty signatures, submitted in May
1983, which deplored and opposed
the investigation of the political
orientation of the Hoover Institu
tion.

After the many stories I have
heard of the inadequacies of the
ASSU Senate, I had the unfortunate
opportunity, Tueday evening, of
seeing firsthand what an injustice to
the student body the senate really is.
1 think that the senators need to be
reminded that what they supposedly
represent is the Stanford community,
rather than their own narrow inter
ests and opinions.
In particular, I wish to address the
matter of special fee assessments. As
a member of the Axe Committee
whose many requests on Tuesday
were turned down, some may say I
have sour grapes. As a matter of fact
I do, and well I should. With three
organizations still awaiting a vote on
their special fee requests — the Axe
Committee, the Band and The Daily
— there were only 15 voting mem
