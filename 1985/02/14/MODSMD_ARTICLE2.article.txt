# COP vetoes senate vote on Band fee
## 
### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER Senior staff writer 
In the first veto of an ASSU Senate measure in two
years, the Council of Presidents (COP) yesterday blocked
a senate order calling for the reorganization of the Band's
budget.
Saying that the proposed reorganization of the budget is
"totally unacceptable," the COP sent a notification of the
intent to veto to Senate Chair Eric Berg yesterday.
The senate decided to reorganize the budget because
the Band used fee-assessment funds for a road trip in Sep
tember 1984. According to ASSU bylaws, fee assessment
funds are to be allocated for operation expenses only.
The total money available for Band use for the 1984-85
school year is $108,000, Berg said in an interview yester
day. Fee assessments added up to $44,821 after refunds.
The conflict within the senate stems from a road trip to
a preseason football game in Oklahoma. "Well over half
of the Band's special fee was spent on the trip," Berg said.
Both Band members and ASSU representatives say it is
likely the veto will be overriden. The Band's budget reor
ganization was approved overwhelmingly Tuesday night.
The senate solution would change how the Band is
represented on the ballot. If the veto is overriden, the bal
lot would contain two separate assessment measures: One
would concern operating funds for the Band, and the
other would deal with road trips.
The COP members said they feel the senate needs to
reconsider its actions in relation to the Band. According
to the COP letter to the senate chair, the Band has
worked well with the Appropriations Committee and
deserves a more "equitable solution/'
In the letter, the COP wrote, "We are taking this ac
tion. ... In light of the fact that the Band has tried to
work with the senate to answer senate concerns as to who
should pay for the trip, (e.g. that the University should
pay for it). We find it questionable to rewrite their budget
after they have done exactly what you told them."
Band Manager Scott Gode said the Band is asking for
$15,000 less than it received last year because the road
trip is "a lot smaller" and "most of the operating expenses
are less than or equal to last year."
Students will not have to pay for any road trips taken
next year, Gode said.
Students, through the ASSU fee assessments, will pay
for the Band's operating costs, Gode said, adding that the
University will cover any traveling costs and will contrib
ute $22,000 to operating costs.
In addition to the fee-assessment funds and the Univer
sity donations, the Band receives money from the
provost's office and the Music Department.
There are no plans for any cuts in those donations. Berg
said.
Commenting on Tuesday night's actions, COP member
David Porter said, "It makes us look really, really bad"
and had the effect of making the Band look bad.
"The senate is saying that they don't like the way the
Band is spending their money," Porter said.
Todd Kerr, also a COP member, said, "All three of us
(COP members) feel very strong about the Band getting
their fee assessment. .. We thought the cuts were drastic.
"The Band has reduced its request from last year; it has
been trying to work with the ASSU," Kerr said.
Gode noted that it is "frustrating that the COP can only
veto and not make decisions."
The band manager said he is not optimistic about the
outcome of the veto. He said he does not "know if enough
students care" to protest.
"The senate has gotten to a point where there are no
checks and balances against them," Gode said.
Jeff Stevens, assistant manager of the Band, said he is
"very unhappy" with the senate action. "It was out of
bounds." he said.
