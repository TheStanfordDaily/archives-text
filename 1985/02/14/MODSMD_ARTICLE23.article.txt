## Men's volleyball UCSB knocks off Stanford 
### ROB GRAHAM Staff sportswriter 
In a match played for the un
disputed possession of fourth place in
the California Intercollegiate Volley
ball Association, the Stanford men's
volleyball team fell to UC-Santa Bar
bara in four sets, 6-15, 8-15, 15-8,4-
15, yesterday.
The loss dropped the Cardinal's
league mark to 3-3 and its overall
record to 11-4. With the victory, the
Gauchos improved to 4-2 in the
CIV A. Stanford and Santa Barbara
are chasing league leaders USC (4-0),
UCLA (3-0) and Pepperdine (2-0).
"The difference in the match was in
their serve return," Stanford Co-
Coach Don Shaw said afterward. Ken
Preston, the Santa Barbara coach,
agreed. "Our setters did a real fine
job, especially on the side-outs," he
said. "Siding-out is the whole key to
the ball game."
Santa Barbara fielded only one
starter, Randy Ittner, over six foot
three. Stanford featured four players
that tall — Scott Fortune, Jon Root,
Craig Lauchner and Chris Braun —
but the Gauchos moved and reacted
well to overcome their height disad
vantage.
"We were one step behind all
night," Shaw said. "They were com
ing at us from all different angles."
After falling behind by two sets,
Stanford managed to capture the
third set. Shaw felt that the Cardinal
was able to "take Santa Barbara out
of their offense and control the ac
tion" in that set. Preston, on the other
hand, attributed Stanford's short
lived comeback to his own team's let
down.
In any case, both teams returned to
form in the fourth set, when the

Gauchos were again able to dictate
the action with their diversified at
tack.
Stanford's Chris Braun, a junior
outside hitter from Carmichael, led
all hitters on the evening with 20 kills.
He combined those kills with a .357
hitting percentage. Brett Monello
chipped in for the Cardinal with 14
kills (.300), and Scott Fortune added
11.
Santa Barbara was led by the play
of Randy Ittner, a four-year starter
and a pre-season Ail-American. It
tner, from Torrance, recorded 13 kills
and a fine .444 percentage. Jared
Huffman, a junior setter, had 16 kills.
Yesterday's victory was especially
sweet for the Gauchos. Santa Barbara
was looking to even a score dating
back to the Santa Barbara/Michelob
Light Invitational a month ago, when
Stanford handed the home team a
two-set loss and knocked Santa Bar
bara out of the tournament. The
Cardinal eventually went on to win
the invitational.
"We didn't feel we played very well
that day," Preston said. "There was
definitely a revenge factor tonight."
Though disappointed with his
team's play, Shaw was not ready to
call it quits. "It's still early in the
season," he said. "There are still 12
games to go."
With those 12 games remaining,
Stanford stands tenuously in fifth
place. The top five teams from the
CIV A are offered bids to the post
season NCAA tournament.
The Cardinal will be in action again
tomorrow night at Chico State, in a game
that will not count in conference
standings. On Saturday, Stanford
returns to Maples Pavilion for a 5:30
p.m. game against California.

but it was not enough to overcome the diversified Gaucho attack.
