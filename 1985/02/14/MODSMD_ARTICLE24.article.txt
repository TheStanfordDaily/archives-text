# Little mistakes trip up golfers
## 
### KEN STEVENS Staff sportswriter 
Though their eighth-place finish
yesterday in the Arizona Intercol
legiate at Tucson was their worst
of the 1984-85 season, the Stan
ford women golfers are confident
that many better finishes lie in the
near future.
"Overall, we're doing really
well," freshman Trish McGonigle
said. "We're just making little
mistakes ... and some of the putts
aren't falling. It's just a matter of
time."
In Tuscon, the Cardinal
combined consecutive rounds of
307 Monday and Tuesday with a
final-round 306 yesterday for a
920 three-day total which was far
off the pace of tournament winner
UCLA's sizzling 904.
New Mexico finished three
strokes in back of UCLA at 907,
followed by San Jose State at 913.
McGonigle said that despite the
disparity in the scores of the two
teams, the Cardinal has the talent
to play with UCLA and the other
top teams.
"The difference between Stan
ford and UCLA is just a fine line,"
McGonigle said. "We're so close.
I'm really confident."
Sophomore Kathleen Mc-
Carthy, who finished in a tie for
fifth place in the individual com
petition at 225, was pleased by the
enthusiasm that the team showed

throughout the tournament. "We
showed a lot of team effort, which
is something I haven't seen in a
long time," McCarthy said.
Both McGonigle and McCarthy
believe that the Cardinal women
are underestimating their ability.
"I don't think we expect enough of
ourselves," McGonigle said.
"I don't think we realize that we
can compete against these people
(the highly-ranked teams) .. . but
I think that will change,"
McCarthy said. "The overall
feeling is pretty positive. We're
willing to work."
UCLA's Kay Cockerill finished
three shots ahead of the pack at
220 to take individual honors.
Tied for second at 223 were New
Mexico's Cristy Arrington and
U.S. International University's
Laurette Maritz, with McCarthy
two shots back at 225.
Following McCarthy for Stan
ford were freshmen Kay Cornelius
and Anna Oxenstierna with equal
scores of 233. McGonigle finished
at 235 and junior Julie Carmichael
shot 237 on the 6000-yard Ran
dolph Golf Course.
The Cardinal women have two
weeks off before playing Tulsa in a
dual-match at Cypress Point. On
March 1 they begin play in the
three-day Lady Spartan hosted by
San Jose at Fort Ord and Pebble
Beach.
