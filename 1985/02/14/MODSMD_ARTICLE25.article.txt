Twenty-two players — 18 fresh
men and four junior-college trans
fers — have signed letters of intent
to attend the University on foot
ball scholarships this fall, Stanford
Recruiting Coordinator Dick
James announced yesterday.
Head Coach Jack Elway was
very pleased with what he called
an "outstanding group" of 17 de
fensive and five offensive players
James said, "We feel we have
definitely reached the goals we set.
Last year we were good at recruit
ing offensive players. This year is
the second half of the package.
We've reinforced our defensive
capacity.
"We had needs we wanted to
fill. We were able to do that, espe
cially on defense," James said.
This year marked a departure
from previous years in that there
were four junior-college transfers.
There were no JC transfers signed
last year.
James said he expects the trans
fers to be able to step in and con
tribute right away. "That's why we
recruited them," he said.
The transfers are center Guy
Bunyard of El Camino Commu
nity College in Torrance; defen
sive lineman Tony Leiker of Cof
feyville (Kan.) Community Col
lege; wide receiver Rod Shull of
Santa Barbara City College; and
defensive back Chris Young of
Wharton (Texas) Community Col
lege.

Lineman Brian Huckestein was
the only recruit to receive All-
America honors from USA
Today, but four others — lineman
Lester Archambeau, linebacker
Jeff Danchok, running back Scott
Eschelman and defensive back
Jonathan Holloway — received
honorable-mention honors.
Freshmen who could contribute
in 1985 include Archambeau,
Huckstein, Holloway, wide
receiver Jeff Blaisdell and tight
end Jim Price.
The overall defensive group in
cludes six linemen about whom
Elway is "really enthused," and
six linebackers and five defensive
backs.
"We wanted to improve team
speed," James said. "They all have
verifiable 40 (yard dash) times.
That's not just the defensive
backs, (it's) the linemen, too. They
run within the range of what
people in the Pac-10 should
run."
Stanford did not land a quarter
back this year. The Cardinal
recruited two of the nation's top
QBs — Todd Ellis of Greensboro,
N.C., and Mark Kamphaus of na
tional powerhouse Cincinnati
Moeller High School — but lost
them both. Ellis signed with South
Carolina, and Kamphaus will try
to replace Doug Flutie at Boston
College.
"We didn't feel like we had to
bring a body in," James said.
"Any person we recruited would
have to be as good or better than
John Paye. That's a pretty high
standard."
