## Card humiliates Santa Clara 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
It was a beautiful day for tennis yesterday, but
the Santa Clara women's tennis team probably had
better things in mind than playing No. 1-ranked
Stanford.
The scoreboard, which showed Stanford winning
9-0, spoke for itself — and for Santa Clara.
Was Cardinal Coach Frank Brennan surprised
with the ease of the victory? "Uh-uh," he said,
"especially when they called me before the match
and told me one of their players was sick."
The victory boosted Stanford's record to 5-0.
The school-record match winning streak now
stands at 31.
"Now we're ready to get on with business," said
Brennan, whose team has won by scores of 9-0, 7-

2, 8-1, 9-0 and 9-0. "We get the (eighth-ranked
California) Golden Bears next week and I'm
looking forward to that, if for no other reason than
to get going, to see how (good) we are."
For the second straight match, no Cardinal netter
lost a set yesterday. And except for Linda Gates at
No. 1, no one came close. Santa Clara won a total
of 24 games in 18 sets and were blanked in a third
of them.
Gates was cruising along against the Broncos'
Kelly Tebo and won the first set, 6-1, but was
forced to come from behind in the second. Down 5-
4, Gates broke Tebo's serve, then held her own to
move in front, 6-5.
Gates returned to first-set form in the 12th
game. The Cardinal senior fired a winner down the
right sideline, Tebo double-faulted, and then Gates
hit a perfect cross-court volley to clinch the victory.

"She had a little groin pull," Brennan said of
Gates, the lone senior on the team. "She hit yester
day and looked pretty good. But it acted up again
today in the second set and she really lost mobility
in her backhand."
Walk-on Cindy Spiekerman played perfect ten
nis yesterday, winning her No. 6 singles match, 6-0,
6-0 and then teaming with walk-on Susan Ross at
No. 3 doubles to post her second 6-0, 6-0 score of
the afternoon. Brennan also used his third walk-on,
sophomore Annette Shelby, who beat Racchi, 6-3,
6-1, at No. 5.
Brennan said he'll go with his best lineup against
Cal Wednesday — if everyone is healthy, that
is. Freshman Anna Ivan is still recovering from a
bout with the flu and freshman Cari Hagey just
came down with the same illness.
