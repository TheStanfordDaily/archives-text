# Men's tennis team faces LSU
## 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford men's tennis team,
currently ranked No. 2 in the nation,
takes on No. 8-ranked Louisiana
State today in what Cardinal Coach
Dick Gould calls his team's toughest
preseason match.
Stanford defeated UC-Santa Bar
bara 6-3 on Tuesday in a four-and-a
half hour match. I 4 shouldn't have
been so tough — Santa Barbara, now
7-7, is not ranked.
Gould did not play his full singles
lineup Tuesday because his top
players have been competing in Inter
collegiate Tennis Coaches Associa
tion tournaments around the country
and needed a chance for the jet lag to
wear off.

As it turned out, he could have
used some of those players in singles
competition Tuesday, as UCSB won
half of the six matches.
"Sometimes I have to take a
chance, but I have a lot of confidence
in the guys," Gould said. "The match
was a good one in several aspects.
John Letts got to play John (Nissley)
in the No. 1 spot and beat him pretty
easily. That made up for a loss three
months ago."
Against LSU, however, a full
lineup will be in order — probably
similar to the one Stanford used two
weeks ago to win the National Team
Indoor Championship.
Dan Goldie will play No. 1 singles.
He won the All American Individual
Indoor title this past weekend in

Houston by beating the No. 1-ranked
player in the country, Michael
Pernfors of Georgia.
Goldie will play against LSU's Fer
nando Perez. Perez, a member of the
Mexican Davis Cup team last
summer, is the No. 9-ranked player in
ITCA preseason polls and is 3-2 in
singles competition so far this season.
He was invited to the Individual In
door Championship that Goldie won,
but did not go because of an injury.
Perez also plays No. 1 doubles with
freshman Jeff Brown. LSU's No. 2
doubles team, consisting of Steve
Wood and Jason Noonan, was 25-2 in
1984 and won the Southeastern Col
legiate Conference doubles cham
pions.
LSU's strength this season has

been in the bottom half of singles
competition and in doubles. Two
freshman recruits, Brown and Billy
Urive, are partially responsible for
the trend. Urive plays No. 3 singles,
and Brown plays No. 5 singles. Both
are 4-1 in their matches.
LSU lost in the first round of the
NCAA Championships last year to
UCLA. UCLA went on to win the
team tournament with a 5-4 victory
over Stanford in the finals. LSU
finished up the season ranked No. 12.
LSU coach Jerry Simmon said the
match "is a good opportunity to play
a great team on the road."
"This is the toughest match we've
had to face so far. We finished sixth in
the NTIC .. . and this will let us know
more where we stand," he said.
