# Goldie rising to top of collegiate ranks
## 
### BETH KLEID 
Dan Goldie's name couldn't be more perfect. With
strawberry-blonde hair and a shy smile, he is the epitome
of the boy next door. And after winning the Rolex Indoor
Individual Tournament in Houston last Sunday, he is now
the golden boy of college tennis.
Goldie, the No. 1 player on the Stanford men's tennis
team, is now No. 1 in the country. When he went to Hous
ton last week he was ranked No. 2 in the Intercollegiate
Tennis Coaches Association poll. He beat No. 1 -ranked
Michael Pernfors of Georgia 6-3, 6-2, and he should be
receiving his new ITCA ranking at the end of this week.
When Goldie applied to Stanford he chose the word
"perfectionist" to describe himself in an application essay.
"I would say it is an accurate description," he said.
But that's as far as his vanity goes. The attention Goldie
is getting because of his recent win hardly affects his ego.
"Just because I won one tournament, I'm getting all this
attention, but I'm still the same player I was a week ago,"
he said.
The junior has hardly had a chance to recover from the
tournament, and already he is scheduled for newspaper
and television interviews. On his first day back to the Var
sity Courts, he was greeted by other Cardinal tennis
players with expressions of congratulations — "Way to
go, Dan, " and "Great job." He responded to these, as he
does to the media, with quiet modesty.
Goldie isn't blinded by fame and glory.
"It's an honor to be No. 1," he said, "but rankings
aren't that important to me. When I play a match I worry
about the match, not rankings.
"And it doesn't matter what rank you have, because
when you go on the court it's between two players. It
doesn't matter how good you are, it's just how you play on
that day."
His recent success does not even cause Goldie to dream
of tennis stardom in the future. "I'm not looking past this
year," he said. "The farthest I'll look ahead to is May 20,
the day of the NCAA tournament. My main goal now is to
help Stanford win the NCA As this year."
Indeed, Goldie is a true team player. He said that the
thing he likes most about college tennis is that it makes an
otherwise individual sport into a team sport. He notes that
this is the "major difference" between college tennis and
junior tennis and professional tennis.
"I put this team ahead of my personal tennis career," he
said. "I'm playing for this school and not myself."
According to Goldie, there is no jealousy among the
Cardinal netters, despite the fact that many of them
played against each other in junior tournaments before
they came to the Farm.

"The reason that we do so well is that we stick together
— it's something our coach has been been able to get us to
do. We're not individual players looking for glory."
He predicts that his team has a "good shot" at No. 1
this year, "if we all stay healthy."
Lately, Goldie has been having health problems him
self. He did not play much this fall because of a back in
jury. Last year, Goldie was diagnosed as having scoliosis,
a curvature of the spine.
"I have just recently started to play matches," he said.

"I usually feel it (the back) after a match — not during.
It's an aching; it feels tight and uncomfortable."
After some prodding, Goldie agreed to make some
predictions about himself. He said that he will turn profes
sional after he graduates — his dedication to his team
keeps him from leaving school to turn pro, as John
McEnroe did after his freshman year at Stanford. "There
is a possibility that I will turn pro after this year," Goldie
admitted, "but it is only a possiblity."
Goldie has played on the pro circuit, but as an amateur
he is unable to accept any money for winning tourna

ments. Last summer, he won a pro doubles tournament in
Chicago — this summer he plans to play in the U.S. Open.
Wimbledon and other tournaments.
But for Goldie, tennis does not mean forever. "I
wouldn't be at Stanford if I wanted to play tennis for the
rest of my life," said the economics major. "Besides, ten
nis careers don't last that long.
"I'll play as long as I'm having a good time. If you're
not having fun at something, it's not worth doing, no mat
ter how successful you are." Right now Goldie is enjoying
tennis "a lot," but eventually he wants to do something
else — probably in the business world.
Goldie has been having a good time with tennis since he
first picked up a racket at age 13. By the time he was 14,
he was ranked third in his age-division and he had begun
traveling to participate in the Junior Nationals.
"1 liked traveling when 1 was growing up. 1 got to see a
lot of different things that most young kids don't get a
chance to see — and I got to meet a lot of different
people."
When Goldie was growing up in the Washington D.C.
area, his coach. Jack Schore, "built the foundation" of his
game. Now, Schore and Stanford Coach Dick Gould
speak about their protege quite frequently.
"They help each other out — they tell each other about
what they're working on with me."
He has seen improvement in his game since he came to
Stanford. He said that he has gone from being a baseline
player to one with a strong serve and volley game. Gould
calls him "aggressive."
Goldie admits that his sport has enhanced his life in dif
ferent ways. Through tennis, he has learned the art of bal
ance.
"I have had to learn how to set my day up — to make
time for practicing three to four hours a day, traveling,
school and friends, " he said. "I'm so used to doing this
that I don't know what I would do in the afternoons with
out tennis."
Tennis has also taught Goldie to "keep things in per
spective." He tries not to let a good or bad day on the
courts affect his life too much. "Tennis is just a game, and
the world is a lot bigger than just a game," he said.
He says that he uses tennis as an outlet. "It does feel
great to come out to the courts and be your best at some
thing. It's part of putting things in perspective — it helps
take the pressure off of school and grades."
As a player, Goldie finds another type of balancf. He
said he thinks he is a mixture between a natural athlete
and an athlete who has to work hard at his sport. "I don't
think about it much, 1 just go out and play," he said. And
the rest of the world watches a tennis player on the rise.
