I"he Oklahoma-Georgia al
liance that mounted a historic le
gal challenge to the NCAA over
television rights last year was obvi
ously dissolved Wednesday when
Georgia — following what seems
to be a nationwide trend —
grabbed two blue-chip football
prospects from the Sooners' back
yard.
Wednesday was the first day
high school stars could sign bin
ding letters of intent. And while
most of the traditional powers ap
peared to be making their cus
tomary haul, many of the most
highly sought athletes were bolting
their home areas.
Nebraska, which usually sweeps

through its own state like a
vacuum cleaner, waved goodbye
to the No. 1 prospect in the
Cornhusker state. Washington,
which vanquished Oklahoma in
the Orange Bowl Jan. 1, lost — to
Oklahoma — a brilliant defensive
back from Everett, Wash. And the
Sooners winced when top line
prospects Bill Goldberg and Eric
Johnson of Tulsa signed with
Georgia.
A short time later, however, the
Sooners landed what many con
sider the top line prospect in
Texas, Dante Williams of Gaines
ville.
