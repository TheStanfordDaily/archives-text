### 
After clobbering UC-Santa Cruz
48-0 last Wednesday, the Stanford
men's rugby team got a 3-52 thrash
ing of its own on Saturday at the
hands of the visiting Bay Area
Touring Side (BATS), one of the
area's best club teams. The weary
Cardinal, playing its sixth match in
only 14 days, was outmanned by the
large, very experienced pack and
quick backline of the BATS.
Stanford threatened at times, one
of those resulting in an Andy
McTavich penalty kick that was the
Cardinal's only score, but was
dominated by the veteran BATS for
the majority of the game.
In the second teams' game, Stan
ford fared better but still fell 28-0.
The loss came despite strong perfor
mances by backs Doug Rigg, Dave

Schultz, Chris Stevens and Dave Sil
vestre, who racked up many long runs
and caused havoc in the BATS'
backline with numerous strong
tackles.
Meanwhile, the overmatched
Cardinal third team lost 7-60, with
Bob Levinstein's penalty kick and
John Moore's try accounting for the
Cardinal scoring. Moore recovered
the ball in the try zone after Darrell
Brooks, subbing for an injured
player, was tackled after recovering
his own long kick.
The Cardinal, now 2-2 in the con
ference and 3-6 overall, will get a
much-needed 10-day break before
clashing with the visiting University
of British Columbia on Feb. 21 at 4
p.m. on Maloney Field.
