# Diving an 'art' for Meyer
## 
### INGRID SEYER Staff sportswriter 
Diving isn't something that Jean Meyer just
started to do one day in her early teens — it is
something she has been doing all her life. And that
experience certainly shows in her diving perfor
mance.
Meyer, a senior, has been competing on the
Stanford diving team for the past four years, but
that is only about one quarter of her total diving ex
perience.
"1 started diving seriously when I was six years
old," Meyer said. " I had always been diving, and I
realized that it was something I had a talent for and
could really be good at."
Meyer began training with a small local club in
her hometown of San Marino, moving on to com
pete in the Los Angeles Diving Club. When Meyer
reached high-school age, she made what may have
been the most important choice of her diving
career.
"1 decided to move away from home in order to
train with the Mission Viejo Diving Club," Meyer
said. "I had to live away from my family for those
four years, but the experience I gained with the
club was well worth it.
"Even though I was still fairly young at that
point, I realized that diving was a very important
part of my life. When I committed myself to going
to Mission Viejo, 1 was committing a large portion
of my life to diving, which is really what it takes if
you want to be good."
Meyer's dedication began to pay off early in her
career. An eight-time National Junior Olympic
Champion and four-time high school All-

American, Meyer also traveled with the American
National Team on three separate occasions. Her
diving talent easily caught the eye of Stanford
Diving Coach Rick Schavone.
"Stanford revived its diving program five years
ago and Jean was the the team s first top recruit,"
Schavone said. "Jean's affect on the Stanford
diving program has been tremendous. She is most
assuredly the 'queen of the Stanford diving pro
gram.' "
Meyer was the first Stanford diver to receive col
legiate All-American honors, first in 1982 and then
again in 1983. Meyer finished fourth in the NCAA
Championships during both of those years.
Although Meyer admits the honors associated
with her diving are very exciting, she says that the
outlet for personal expression she finds in her sport
is more important.
" Diving is as much an art form as any other type
of art. In the case of my sport, the diver is the artist
and every dive is a piece of the artist's work,"
Meyer said. "Each diver chooses to express himself
differently, just as I do."
According to Schavone, Meyer's individual form
of expression is by far her greatest asset.
"Jean is the most beautiful and elegant diver I
have ever coached," Schavone said. "She has tre
mendous grace and has kept beauty in her diving
even though the focus of diving has been moving
more toward the strength moves and away from the
aesthetics."
"I have always worked to maintain my style even
though there was a lot of pressure to conform and
change toward more strength-oriented dives,"
Meyer said. "Because I have had to compete

against girls that are a lot bigger and stronger than
me, I have had to fight to keep my grace.
"I have been working for a long time on combin
ing more strength into my diving and I finally feel
the effort is beginning to show."
Her coach agrees. "Jean has definitely improved
her diving since she's been at Stanford, " Schavone
said. "She has added strength to her dives and has
improved her 'ripping' (ability to enter the water
gracefully)."
Meyer's improvement is not the result of a few
lucky breaks — it has come from many hours of
practicing each of her dives over and over again.
According to Meyer, she must practice each dive
until it becomes a habit for her.
"Before I get ready to dive, I try to control my
body while going through the dive in my mind,"
Meyer said. "I know each dive so well that I can
feel if any part of my body isn't performing exactly
as it should during the dive."
Although Meyer says that diving has been the
most important part of her life, she is quick to point
out that she has never missed out on any other
aspects of life because of her dedication.
"Diving has always been my life, but I have
never regretted it," Meyer said. "Diving has af
fected my life in many, many ways. It is a very dis
ciplined mental sport.
"Because I'm always working to improve my
dives and reach perfection, 1 work to perfect every
thing else in my life."
An American studies major who hopes to stay
involved with athletics through a sales position or
the media, Meyer will be giving up her competitve
diving after this year's NCAA Championships.

out that she has never missed out on any other
aspects of life because of her dedication.
"Diving has always been my life, but I have
never regretted it," Meyer said. "Diving has af
fected my life in many, many ways. It is a very dis
ciplined mental sport.
"Because I'm always working to improve my
dives and reach perfection, 1 work to perfect every
thing else in my life."
An American studies major who hopes to stay
involved with athletics through a sales position or
the media, Meyer will be giving up her competitve
diving after this year's NCAA Championships.
Diving isn't something that Jean Meyer just
started to do one day in her early teens — it is
something she has been doing all her life. And that
experience certainly shows in her diving perfor
mance.
Meyer, a senior, has been competing on the
Stanford diving team for the past four years, but
that is only about one quarter of her total diving ex
perience.
"1 started diving seriously when I was six years
old," Meyer said. " I had always been diving, and I
realized that it was something I had a talent for and
could really be good at."
Meyer began training with a small local club in
her hometown of San Marino, moving on to com
pete in the Los Angeles Diving Club. When Meyer
reached high-school age, she made what may have
been the most important choice of her diving
career.
"1 decided to move away from home in order to
train with the Mission Viejo Diving Club," Meyer
said. "I had to live away from my family for those
four years, but the experience I gained with the
club was well worth it.
"Even though I was still fairly young at that
point, I realized that diving was a very important
part of my life. When I committed myself to going
to Mission Viejo, 1 was committing a large portion
of my life to diving, which is really what it takes if
you want to be good."
Meyer's dedication began to pay off early in her
career. An eight-time National Junior Olympic
Champion and four-time high school All-

American, Meyer also traveled with the American
National Team on three separate occasions. Her
diving talent easily caught the eye of Stanford
Diving Coach Rick Schavone.
"Stanford revived its diving program five years
ago and Jean was the the team s first top recruit,"
Schavone said. "Jean's affect on the Stanford
diving program has been tremendous. She is most
assuredly the 'queen of the Stanford diving pro
gram.' "
Meyer was the first Stanford diver to receive col
legiate All-American honors, first in 1982 and then
again in 1983. Meyer finished fourth in the NCAA
Championships during both of those years.
Although Meyer admits the honors associated
with her diving are very exciting, she says that the
outlet for personal expression she finds in her sport
is more important.
" Diving is as much an art form as any other type
of art. In the case of my sport, the diver is the artist
and every dive is a piece of the artist's work,"
Meyer said. "Each diver chooses to express himself
differently, just as I do."
According to Schavone, Meyer's individual form
of expression is by far her greatest asset.
"Jean is the most beautiful and elegant diver I
have ever coached," Schavone said. "She has tre
mendous grace and has kept beauty in her diving
even though the focus of diving has been moving
more toward the strength moves and away from the
aesthetics."
"I have always worked to maintain my style even
though there was a lot of pressure to conform and
change toward more strength-oriented dives,"
Meyer said. "Because I have had to compete

against girls that are a lot bigger and stronger than
me, I have had to fight to keep my grace.
"I have been working for a long time on combin
ing more strength into my diving and I finally feel
the effort is beginning to show."
Her coach agrees. "Jean has definitely improved
her diving since she's been at Stanford, " Schavone
said. "She has added strength to her dives and has
improved her 'ripping' (ability to enter the water
gracefully)."
Meyer's improvement is not the result of a few
lucky breaks — it has come from many hours of
practicing each of her dives over and over again.
According to Meyer, she must practice each dive
until it becomes a habit for her.
"Before I get ready to dive, I try to control my
body while going through the dive in my mind,"
Meyer said. "I know each dive so well that I can
feel if any part of my body isn't performing exactly
as it should during the dive."
Although Meyer says that diving has been the
most important part of her life, she is quick to point
out that she has never missed out on any other
aspects of life because of her dedication.
"Diving has always been my life, but I have
never regretted it," Meyer said. "Diving has af
fected my life in many, many ways. It is a very dis
ciplined mental sport.
"Because I'm always working to improve my
dives and reach perfection, 1 work to perfect every
thing else in my life."
