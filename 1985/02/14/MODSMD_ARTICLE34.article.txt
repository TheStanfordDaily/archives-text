# Final meet for wrestlers

### PETER CASTILLO Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford wrestling team finishes its dual-meet
season on the road tonight against San Jose State. A
win for the Cardinal, now 7-6-1, will give the team a
winning dual-meet record for the season.
"In the past, at times, we have done really well
against San Jose — and there have been times when
the same San Jose wrestlers have beaten us," Stanford
Coach Chris Horpel said. "We are favored to win for
the first time in 10 years, but if we match up like we did
in the Biola Invitational, we won't do particularly
well."
In the Biola Inviational last Saturday, Stanford
finished in fifth place, with San Jose right behind in
sixth. In head-to-head matches the Spartans had the

better of the Cardinal.
At 142 pounds, Stanford's Scott Wiggen pinned Ken
Brison 3:37 into the match and Dave Lee (167
pounds) defeated San Jose's Matt Toves 8-1. The
Spartans registered victories when Shannon Felix (150
pounds) decisioned Jeff Hazard 7-3, Craig Walker
(158 pounds) defeated Pete Rogers 9-3 and Don Knox
(177 pounds) beat Tom Mullen 4-3.
Horpel believes that the team was suffering from a
mild case of burnout last weekend and hopes the two
days off — Sunday and Monday — will help the ath
letes. He has gone over video tapes of the Cardinal's
previous matches against the Spartans with the team in
order to correct mistakes, and says the team is ready to
give San Jose a good battle.
