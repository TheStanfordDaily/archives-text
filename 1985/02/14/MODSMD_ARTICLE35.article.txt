# First home game for new varsity sport
## Softball team hosts SFSU 
### GEOFF SANBORN Editorial staff 
The Stanford softball team will
make a little history today just by
stepping between the baselines of its
makeshift field in the far corner of
Roble Field: No matter what, today's
contest with San Francisco State will
go into somebody's record book as
the first home game for Cardinal
softball since it became a varsity
sport.
There's another bit of history that
could be made this afternoon, but it
won't happen quite so easily. If the

Cardinal comes away with a victory,
the game will go down as the first win
in the history of varsity softball on the
Farm.
The Cardinal is currently 0-6, all
six of the losses having come in the
Santa Barbara Invitational two weeks
ago. But outfielder Cathy Taft
remains optimistic despite her team's
slow start.
"Our defense was great in the
tournament — we never gave up
more than five runs," said Taft, last
year's most valuable player and the
only senior on the team this year.

"We're a very, very good team for
people just walking on," Taft said.
The San Francisco State game will
not count in the Western Collegiate
Athletic Association standings. Once
WCAA play begins, however, the
Cardinal will be going up against such
teams as UCLA and Fullerton State,
the No. 1 and 2 teams in the nation
last year.
Taft is not overly concerned.
"We're not going to blow anyone
out," she said, "but we're going to
play with them."
