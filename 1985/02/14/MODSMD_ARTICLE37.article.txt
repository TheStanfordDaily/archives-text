## The
						'King of the Blues': Still indisputably the best 
### DAVID RISSER Senior staff writer 
8.8. King, the indisputable King of
the Blues, has returned once again
with his guitar Lucille to the Venetian
Room at the Fairmont Hotel for a
thrilling performance of a few of his
best tunes.
King's band, an incredible store of
musical talent directed by saxo
phonist Edgar Synigal, opens the show
with an active display of the abilities
of each of the six musicians.
8.8. soon takes the stage with a
heartening rendition of "Every Day I
Have The Blues." For an hour and
ten minutes he proceeds to dish out
some of his best blues, including the
1971 Grammy award-winner that
sold millions, "The Thrill is Gone."
King's exhibition of emotional,
shiveringly slow blues is a musical ex
perience unparalleled today. His
unique rapport with a crowd and his
ability to evoke the most moving of
guitar riffs from the immortal Lucille
are not to be missed.
The Venetian Room is an intimate,
spectacular place to see a live perfor
mance and there is not a bad seat in
the house. The rich, relatively sterile
environment does not serve to com
promise the audience involvement of
a great blues performance.
When King sings of a woman who
is evil when she is with him and
jealous when they are apart in "How
Blue Can You Get," he builds to the
lyrics:
/ gave you a brand new Ford, you
said, "I want a Cadillac"; I bought
you a $10 dinner, you said, "Thanks
for the snack"; I let you live in my
penthouse, you said it was just a
shack; I gave you seven children and
now you want to give them back!
The audience reacts with screams
and claps as current King enthusiasts
are transported through time to imag
ine what a 8.8. King performance
must have meant to fans at the
Paradise in Detroit in the 19505.
King's roots reflect the classic "son
of a poor, black sharecropper"
model. Born in the Mississippi Delta
town of Indianola, he borrowed $15
from his cotton plantation boss to buy
his first guitar.
In 1947, he hitchhiked to Memphis

and soon recorded "Three O'Clock
Blues" on the RPM label. King went
on to become the most revered blues
artist in the world.
Now approaching his 40th year in
show business, King has taken his
brand of blues to more than 50
countries, including the Soviet Union,
where he performed for 100,000
people in 1979.
King has collected Grammy
awards, gold records and world-wide
critical acclaim and honors.
He has been recognized as a
humanitarian by various groups for
founding, with attorney F. Lee
Bailey, the Foundation for the Ad
vancement of Inmate Rehabilitation
and Recreation. The organization is
trying to improve rehabilitation ef
forts within the prison system by ex
posing inmates to the arts.
King once said, "Music is the inter
national denominator for bringing
people of all race, creed and color to
gether." His career and his perfor
mance reflect that belief.
The greatest credit to 8.8. King is

that virtually no performers of music
rooted in the blues have escaped his
pervasive influence. Eric Clapton,
Mick Jaggerand Stevie Ray Vaughan
are among them. On the opening
night of King's Venetian Room stay,
Carlos Santana was at the next table
enjoying the show.
The only person out of place was a
woman who came on stage for a few
numbers, introduced only after she
was through singing as Deborah Bos
ton. While she evidently has talent
and 8.8. crafted some fine guitar
playing around her, her presence
detracted from a performance that, if
only an hour and 15 minutes long,
should have been dedicated entirely
to the genius of 8.8. King.
King and his band will perform two
shows nightly at 9:30 p.m. and 11:30
p.m. through this Sunday.
Cover charge js $17, $19 on
Friday and Saturday and drinks are in
the $4 range. The Venetian Room is
in the Fairmont Hotel atop Nob Hill
in San Francisco. Call 772-5163 for
reservations.
