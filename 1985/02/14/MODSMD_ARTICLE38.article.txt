Roman Holliday — Fire Me Up
★ H
Listen to this record whenever
you want to find out why your par
ents hate rock 'n' roll. Probably
every obnoxious cliche commer
cially available is here: The band
abandoned its old swing-pop style
(perhaps because Wham! stole it) in
favor of, well, MTV-rock. "Fire Me
Up" (a delightful choice of album
titles — how did the guys think that
one up?) contains 11 songs,
each a sample of a different second
rate commercial band's material.

It's unbelieveable and pitiful that 1)
the band would dare to discard
its peppy, cheerful style and that
2) if it did, it would switch to such
a moronically common one. Lead
singer Steve Lambert's lead vocals
are no longer melodic or catchy as
they once were — they're rock
rough, ordinary and forced. The
formerly cute instrumentation and
harmonies are irritating, cheap im
itations, and none of the songs are
together enough to carry them
selves. The decline and fall of dance
music's popularity has claimed yet
another victim: Roman Holliday

has abandoned both its charm
and its danceability. Its fans
should be next.

The Smiths — Meat is Murder
★ ★ ★ l / 2
In the space between last year's
debut album and this latest effort,
The Smiths have refined their
sound substantially. Their debut
was gloomy, uniform and tedious;
"Meat is Murder" is still gloomy,
but manages to overcome
monotony by a much more pleasant
variety of styles. The band's consis
tently drab sound has incorporated
a range of brighter, more challeng
ing elements, resulting in an overall
feel that is far more satisfying than
that of most one-sound groups. The

key (yet not dominant) guitar work
and tasteful drums and bass
combine to form unique instrumen

tation that manages to keep up with
and highlight lead singer Morris
sey's trademark vocals and falsetto
glides without either falling behind
or overpowering him. The lyrics are
relevant and well enunciated (a
definite plus considering the
R.E.M.s and Dylans of the world),
and though they're somewhat dis
mal, the mildly cheery music
relieves any depressive tendencies.
If The Smiths' future music contin
ues to mature and improve at this
rate, the band will easily transcend
the limited appeal of its already
aging genre.

Sade — Diamond Life ★ ★ ★
Sade is a svelte, glossy band,
huge in England, that is currently

enjoying ever-brief critical and
popular acclaim for its James Bond
cantina music. Its slow, atmo
spheric jazz conveys a rich, fashion
conscious mood without forcing it;
its lyrics might even be meaning
ful for all we care; and each song,
while remaining consistent with the
album's luxurious theme, is differ
ent enough from the others to keep
the whole album from fading com
pletely into the background. Abun
dant sax color and varied syn
thesizer textures accent each track,
while Sade Adus nice, airy vocals
add an extra "instrumental 1 ' layer
to it all. The instrumentation is

hardly challenging enough to war
rant more than passive listening; it
resembles a vocal mix between
Srwndau Ballet and Windham Hill,
conjoining the upper-class ten
dencies of tne former with the envi
ronmental qualities of the latter
while avoiding the obnoxious
qualities of both. While there is
nothing significant about Sade's
music, it is still pleasant, harmless,
non-evocative fluff with which to
relax and forget about life for a
while.
