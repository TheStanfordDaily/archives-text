# Sean Penn enlivens 'The Falcon and the Snowman'
## Boyhood friends sell government secrets to the Soviets in a story based on real life 
### STEVE VINEBERG Editorial staff 
"The Falcon" is Christopher Boyce (Timothy Hutton),
a young man with a passion for falconry who, somewhere
between disillusionment with seminary life and projected
enrollment in law school, allows his father, a retired FBI
agent (Pat Hingle), to land him a high-security job in an
aerospace industrial complex. "The Snowman" is his
oldest friend, Daulton Lee (Sean Penn), a cocaine dealer
whose financial gains (as well as his own fondness for
drugs) keep him working outside of the law despite a
record of arrests and a pending trial. These two scions of
wealthy Palos Verdes families go into partnership when
Chris discovers — accidentally, when CIA-bound telex
messages land on his desk at work — that his employers
are involved in various covert American operations
around the globe, principally the maintenance of surveil
lance satellites, and decides to sell the secrets he has ac
quired to the Soviets. So, armed with certain tantalizing
bits of information and the promise of others, Daulton
strolls into the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City one day
and sets up a contact with the KGB, in the person of a
worldly, amused agent named Alex (David Suchet).
This outrageous story really occurred, between July
1974 (when Chris began work for TRW in Redondo
Beach) and July 1977 (when the boys were tried and con
victed of espionage). Novelized in 1979 by Robert
Lindsey — whose later book, "Flight of the Falcon,"
covers Chris's escape from Lompoc Penitentiary in 1980
— "The Falcon and the Snowman" is close to foolproof

material for the movies, and so John Schlesinger's film
version, with a script by Steve Zaillian, is an entertaining
bad movie for most of its slightly excessive length. (It runs
for two hours and 15 minutes.) Schlesinger opts, intel
ligently, for a comic tone in the first scenes between Daul
ton and Alex (and Alex's supervisor, Mikhael, played by
Boris Leskin), declining to minimize the preposterousness
of this dope dealer's chutzpah in hawking CIA secrets to
the Russians. He's certainly found the actor to carry it off.
Sean Penn wears a thin moustache in this movie, and
everything else about him is correspondingly reduced: He
has never seemed less physically imposing — his arms
swim in the sleeves of the Japanese dressing gowns he
wears, and his eyes retreat behind a pair of shades — and
his voice has a puny, high-whine timber and something
like a bubble caught in it. He conducts his deals with the
Soviets as if he were selling them cocaine (and in one
scene he actually offers them heroin), and when he feels
they are treating him shabbily, his protests take the form
of an exasperated snit, like a tourist's complaining about
his accommodations.
Penn's Daulton Lee is a shrewd little guy, capable of
switching from a sheepish little boy swearing his resolu
tion to reform, when his ineffectual parents (Richard
Dysart and Priscilla Pointer) lecture him, to an outraged
innocent when they encounter fresh evidence of his illegal
activities. And when he is cornered — in an arrest — he
has a ploy to buy time: He listens to his captors with en
forced calm, in a stony lethargy, and then the moment he

can be alone with his lawyer, he releases all his tension in
a tiny, sharp, desperate explosion. Penn makes Daulton
slimy the way John Cazale was as Fredo in "The Godfat
her, Part II" — slimy, that is, without being repulsive.
We can believe everything Penn does as Daulton, in
cluding a scene in which he drives his terrified kid brother
(Chris Makepeace) wildly through the streets, exhorting
him to spare their parents any repeat performances of the
heartbreaks Daulton has brought them. ("And no drugs!
If I hear of you taking drugs I'll kill you!" Penn screams at
him in that resonance-less voice.) It's Chris Boyce, whose
actions reside directly at the center of the movie, who
puzzles us. Timothy Hutton has the right combination of
aristocratic good looks and the suggestion of damaged
sensitivity to play the role, and he shows more self
assurance on the screen than ever before. But Zaillian has
provided him with almost none of the support this charac
ter needs to make sense to an audience. He introduces
Chris in front of a TV set, watching the Watergate
hearings with his father and making jokes about Nixon
that the elder Boyce does not appreciate, but that is
hardly sufficient to indicate the serious conflict between
father and son later alluded to, or to explain Chris's moti
vation for turning spy. We never do understand Chris's
behavior; is it impulse (as he tells Alex) or carefully
thought-out rebellion (as he tells the CIA)? Most of the
opacity in the depiction of this character is Zaillian's fault,
I think, but Hutton contributes to it by playing the inade
quately written scenes with his fellow workers (Dorian
Harewood, as a vet down on "college boys," and Mady
Kaplan) with neither sufficient conviction to make us
believe he enjoys partying with them nor enough tamped
down anger to see that he is wilfully militating against
them.
You have to go back to Lindsey's book to get a sense of
Boyce's divided emotional interests. Describing a break
fast Chris, at 14, shared with his father and a drugged-out
21-year-old who introduced him to falconry, Lindsey

writes: "If there was ever a moment when Chris dis
covered the curious, horrible ambiguity that would haunt
his life, this was it. Other people, he thought, may have a
single identity, but not me. Chris from then on could not
—or would not— make a choice." This passage begins to
explain Chris's fascination with Daulton Lee, too (and
Lindsey elaborates on this), which confounds the viewer.
Until very late in the picture, when Lee throws a tantrum
at the Soviet embassy and Chris can't hide his enjoyment
of his friend's hijinks, we don't receive a single clue to this
friendship, except that the young men were altar boys to
gether (hardly a prescription for a friendship lasting this
long). It might have helped if the filmmmakers had pro
vided a scene in which the two boys smoke marijuana to
gether, as the book tells us they did but the movie hints at
only obliquely, in a morning-after scene that is easy to
misread. And considering Daulton's penchant for messing
up, we wonder if Boyce has gone made when he enlists his
friend as courier, or if he's actually looking to get caught.
David Suchet and Boris Leskin give the best perfor
mances in the movie aside from Sean Penn's, but other ac
tors in supporting roles have to suffer with the shortcom
ings of the script (and of Schlesinger's direction), just as
Timothy Hutton does. Lori Singer, who gave an incen
diary performance in "Footloose" whenever the movie
permitted it, plays Chris's live-in girl friend Lana. Chris
throws her out of his apartment when he gets too deeply
involved with the KGB and is worried about implicating
her; he claims he doesn't love her anymore. Then, just
before his arrest (which he knows at that point is im
minent), he visits her at her job and contradicts his earlier
assertion. Set by themselves in a sea of scenes depicting
the boys' espionage activities, denied the validity of a
romance worked through in the script, these two brief
scenes are more of an embarrassment than anything else.
Poor Lori Singer looks astonished in both of these scenes;
she doesn't seem to know any more about why Chris
Boyce should act in such a strange fashion than we do.
