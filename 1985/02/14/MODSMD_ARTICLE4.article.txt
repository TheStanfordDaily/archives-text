### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Staff writer 
A 15-year-old Homestead High School soph
omore was cited yesterday by Stanford Police
for attempting to break into the University's
main administrative computer.
The charge was referred to the Santa Clara
County District Attorney's Office, Stanford
Police Chief Marvin Herrington told the Uni
versity News Service
The student allegedly attempted to enter an
account operated by Stanford's Information
Technology Service (ITS). The account was
maintained by the Fremont High School Dis
trict for general use, including grades. The
school district is one of several dozen that main
tain records in the Stanford computer.
The charge is an infraction that could be
changed to a misdemeanor. Police would not
name the student because he is a juvenile.
Herrington told the news service that the
charge could be made a misdemeanor, but,
despite reports indicating that the student in
tended to sell grade changes for a fee, Stanford
police do not have solid evidence of what the

student intended to do had he made it into the
computer.
The student never actually got into the main
administrative computer, an IBM 3084, Ed
ward Shaw, director of ITS, told the news ser
vice. The student was stopped at the first secur
ity level, Shaw said, and he would have had to
bieak through at least three additional security
levels before he could have used the account.
Shaw said the student would have been
unable to jump to other accounts on the system
without triggering immediate security alarms.
Stanford police began the investigation after
school officials noticed an inordinate number of
failed log-on attempts at odd hours. After these
unsuccessful attempts, the student allegedly
forged a key to the high school computer room
and found a copy of the password. The student
allegedly used the key to illegally use the
school's computer facilities.
The student apparently forgot the correct
password, and school officials aware of the
access attempts changed the access code before
