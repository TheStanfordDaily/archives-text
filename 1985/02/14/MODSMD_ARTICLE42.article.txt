# Hoover fellow urges flat tax

"The time is ripe for a substantial
overhaul of the tax system in
America," Hoover Senior Fellow
Alvin Rabushka told a crowd of
about 30 at History Corner last
night.
According to Rabushka, "For
the first time, the flat-rate income
tax has the support of the president,
the treasury, and leaders in both
major parties." In addition to the
much-publicized Treasury Depart
ment proposal, Rep. Jack Kemp
(R-N.Y.) and Sen. Bill Bradley (D-
N.J.) have both introduced broad
based tax programs which utilize
variations of the flat tax.
Rabushka outlined a flat-rate
income tax proposal based at 19
percent. The proposal, authored by
Rabushka and Stanford Economics
Prof. Robert Hall, who is also
a Hoover senior fellow, would re
quire individuals and businesses to
pay an income tax of 19 percent on
all earnings. Personal allowances in

the proposal could exempt families
making up to $12,600 from paying
any taxes at all.
Rabushka cited the complexity of

the present tax structure and the
vast amount of lax cheating as
catalysts in the creation of the Hall-
Rabushka flat tax plan. "Today, it's

perfectly moral for people to hire
accountants and lawyers in order to
save 50 cents on the dollar in taxes.
But what we're proposing is that
taxpayers keep 81 cents on the dol
lar — and not pay an accountant to
be able to do it."
The Hall-Rabushka proposal
also calls for the elimination of in
heritance and capital gains taxes
and replaces business depreciation
allowances with a system of annual
"expensing." "The overriding in
centive in this system is to make
money. There is no incentive to
cheat because the risks are not jus
tified at only 19 percent,"
Rabushka said.
He also predicted his tax pro
posal would eliminate the U.S. def
icit by the mid-1990s barring any
dramatic changes in government
spending. Congressional
economists have predicted that the
U.S. deficit will loom well into the
next century under the present sys
tem.
