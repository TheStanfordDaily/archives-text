You are precious.
Phone home. E.T.
Poo so fair poo so sweet
You go away you are snakemeat.
Valentine, please be true
Next year take me away with you.
Will you marry me???
Don't answer that yet
A pizza is a safer bet

Santa on the roof says,
I want you, Marvie!
You don't know me yet, but you will! I
have admired you from afar for so long.
I think you're so cool! 1 think you'll like
me, too. We're alike in so many ways!
We like doing the same things, but I'd
love to turn you on to new experiences.
. How I've dreamed of waking up to see
j| morning's first light stream in through
your blue window. How romantic! If
you're like me, and I think you are, then
we should get together! You can bring
X out the man in me! I'll be in touch! -
Bruce.
s Will you marry me???
Slip on your raincoat.
Let's fly away.
Will you marry me? ? ?
Don't answer that yet.
Let's go kiss in the rain
and get really wet.
Will you marry me? ? ?
Please say yes, poo poo poo
'cause I'm still getting flash
zoom wide-angle focus field images of
you.

HVD to my Theodore across the Bay!
I love you more than all the fro-yo,
muffins and teddies put together!
Two years and 8,000 miles later,
I'm still your little Lippy,

Thanks for all the hugs, smiles,
laughter, and great times.
Lucky I was clever enough
to know a good deal when I saw one!

your Gummy Bear.
Chee:
It's been said before

Even though I've said it for ages
Other boys use the splendor
of their trembling lip
But you're so teddy bear tender
and tragically hip
-Cheers, T.
Groders: Happy 3.682! We are on our
way - No stopping us now. We will have

To discuss life as it is;
To speak of "beauty in all,"
To just enjoy our presence.

prison make; you've broken mine out a
bit. Great thanks, my reluctant friend,
weary confident. I'll spot you a 1 Oflfl in
future life.
Blessings, always.
Your oft-humbled servant
LflL: How could we ever possibly ask
you to be our valentines? After all. . .
we're condescending, arrogant, in
sensitive, and most of all - "We've
changed!" Lucky for us we're so damn
cute. -MflM

Thanks for keeping the place alive; don't
you dare retire yet. It takes time to sew
all the sequin 1 on the gown for your
dowager understudy. Dave & Mark.
Mark: Let us see who will be the girl
tonight? Oh hell, let's be realistic and
both be the boy. That's more fun anyway,
expecially with you! Dave.
To the GLAS Steering Committee -
We've always wanted an appreciative

selves (but that's typical). From the
GLAS Steering Committee.

KD-
You've definitely made my year more
colorful. .. French Colombard, French
accents, Chicago. It's been fun. I think

New York's ever seen.
To my far-away, much missed BAD
ASS-BABY. I'm thinking of you, you

our mother's doing laundry, port wine,
western culture, art, straight A's, Candy,
Christmas, the beach, a barn, and Lady

Kathy W., a blonde,
blue-eyed beauty,
Roses are red, violets
are blue.
I'm so happy when
I'm with you.
So bright and 112 resh
like morning dew.
Alive and free, like
a bird that flew.
Not stuck in place
with paste or glue.
A 112 riend I'll be,
whatever we do.
Anything more,
you know I'll be true.
So much said
with words so few.
Happy Valentine's Day!
Love, Russell
To the Stanford Greeks: We hear the
things your words don't say; we see in
your hips that certain sway; But we don't
want it anyway! Because your
girlfriends always say you simply don't
know how to play. The guys we like are
really gay.
Dave - Does the Coffeehouse sell
season tickets? Two please.

Yeh Yeh, Jill and me in a tree
Well, you ask, when did it start?
On the bathroom trip to BART.
I, her last choice for John Denver,
was already losing my heart to her.
Since then my life has been so grand,
as we've traveled through the land.
We've done so much, brom ballet to
baseball,
and seen the sights oh so natural.
Our life together has been like heaven,
though I dare not stop at 7-11.
With just one fight - about a picture,
our love will last, of that I am sure.
Despite the pain of many miles,
my heart is waiting for her smiles.
Since together I will not see my sweet
heart,
because we are so far apart,
please tell her to this message heed,
"babe, please know, you're all I need."
