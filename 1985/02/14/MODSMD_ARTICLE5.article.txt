# COP petitions to dump Berg
## News 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
A Council of Presidents-backed
petition drive aimed at ousting Senate
Chair Eric Berg from office stunned
the ASSU yesterday, triggering a
wave of countercharges from senators
pledging to support their leader.
COP member David Porter told
The Daily that Berg has politicized
"what should be an apolitical posi
tion. ... A senate chair who is politi
cal can use that position to decide the
fate of most bills. He hasn't been
apolitical, and he's used his power to
affect decisions." In addition, he
claimed a number of people have
resigned from ASSU positions this
year because "they just did not want
to work with Eric Berg anymore."
In response, Berg said he was
"quite surprised" by the COP's
move, saying there is "a certain
amount of sour grapes going on on
their (the COP's) part."
Specifically, Berg said he thinks the
move for his ouster was the action of
a "frustrated" COP that had seen a
number of its proposal defeated in
the senate. He cited a recent COP
proposals to divide the salary of
former COP member Alice Wells
among the remaining members that
was "quite decisively defeated" by
the senate.
Graduate Senator Jim McGrath
said he feels the majority of senators
are behind Berg, a sentiment echoed
by Deputy Chair B. G. Porter. Porter
said there is "a common consensus"
among senators that Berg has done
an impressive job.
However, COP member Porter
said Berg has "a rather large ten
dency for abuses of power," but did
not give examples. "It's hard to say
there's been this abuse, that abuse.
This is a very controversial and very
decisive thing for the ASSU, and
we're trying to limit that," Porter
said.
COP member Todd Kerr said Berg
committed "the most blatant" abuse

of power of his term Tuesday night
when he moved a COP proposal di
rectly to a committee without first
bringing it to the senate. Kerr said the
action was "unprecedented" and a
"blatant usurpation of power."
The proposal in question involved
a move by the COP to seek funding
for the Guest Professorship Bureau
to finance speakers for a hunger con
ference to be held here spring quar
ter.
Berg said he "indicated quite some
time ago" that he intended to send

the matter to the Budget and Finance
Committee before it came before the
senate.
"I've maintained all along that
things should go through the commit
tees before they reach the senate
floor," Berg said, adding that he
thinks such a procedure allows for a
better-informed discussion in the sen
ate.
Berg said the senate chair has the
right to send a proposal directly to a
committee, quoting the bylaws: "Any
bill or resolution may be committed
by the chair to one or more appropri
ate committees of the senate for con
sideration . . . before reaching the
senate floor."
McGrath said he and other
senators were "in total sympathy with


Eric Berg
Senate chair
what he (Berg) did." He said the
COP should have gone to the Budget
and Finance Committee before the
senate met, calling it "at worst a
procedural problem" to conduct the
meeting beforehand. He said such a
meeting could have prevented the
entire uproar.
According to the ASSU constitu
tion, a petition to recall a senate offi
cer must be signed by at least 15 per
cent of the entire student body. Once
the signatures are verified by the
elections commissioner, the ASSU
must hold a two-day election no
fewer than six days and no more than

15 days after verification. Should a
two-thirds majority of voters approve
Berg's ouster, the senate chair would
be forced to step down, in which case
Deputy Chair Porter would tempo
rarily assume the position until the
senate decides on a new chair.
Jon Adelstein, another senator,
said he was "shocked" to hear about
the ouster, adding that "it's bound to
raise animosities and solve nothing."
He said "there seem to be other ways
to go about" discussing Berg's activi
ties than "attempting to undermine
him" in the public.
"If he's impeached, I'll resign from
the senate," said an angered
Adelstein.
Graduate Senator Mark Landes
mann called the COP move "ugly,

silly, superfluous, immature, incom
prehensible, destructive and futile."
He said Berg is an "incredibily
diligent" worker, "one of the best
senate chairs in the history of the
ASSU."
Berg said there is an alternative
method the COP could have taken to
oust him: a senate vote calling for
Berg's removal requiring a simple
majority vote to pass. He said the
COP's failure to take this route shows
that the COP feels "the senate would
not be very sympathetic to such a
movement."
COP member Melissa Auchard
said a senate vote was not tried be
cause she, Porter and Kerr believe
that Berg "is affecting the student
body" and the ouster is a student

issue.
Auchard added the COP had tried
reconciling its differences with Berg
numerous times through conversa
tions with him, appearing to make
progress and then discovering later
that nothing had changed. She said
the situation eventually became "so
out of control" that another form of
action was imperative.
Senator Jay Alter said the COP pe
tition is "not very pragmatic; his term
is almost up. Will it solve any prob
lems or will it create new ones? I
won't recall him for (solely) personal
reasons â€” he was elected fair and
square."
Kerr said the ouster is not a per
sonal attack, although he said the
"ASSU couldn't continue to provide

services to students if this was to con
tinue." He said he thinks a shake-up
was needed to get things moving in
the senate.
Kerr added that the "attendance
rate has been awful" in the senate, a
fact he attributes partially to Berg s
"administrative tendencies and his
personality."
McGrath called the COP petition
"amazing" and "really strange," al
though he said the move was not
surprising and probably the product
of a COP that was "dissatisfied with
(its) term in office." Like Berg, he
noted the COP's frustration over the
Wells salary affair and other times
that it "ran into some problems with
the senate."
McGrath said the COP members

talked with Financial Manager Chris
O'Brien and Berg about dividing the
salary among the members before
bringing the issue to the senate. He
said his senate colleagues "looked at
me as if I was crazy" when McGrath
revealed the COP plan to split the
money without letting the senate vote
on the matter.
McGrath said Berg is "a scapegoat.
The COP is taking it out on Eric."
"I just don't like to see political
games being played between the
branches of the ASSU," Deputy
Chair Porter said, adding that he was
"really shocked" by the COP action.
Berg said he has called for a special
meeting of the senate tomorrow, at
which time one of the issues discussed
will be the COP recall move.
