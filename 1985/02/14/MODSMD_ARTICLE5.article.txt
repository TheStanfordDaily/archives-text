# COP petitions to dump Berg
## News 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
A Council of Presidents-backed
petition drive aimed at ousting Senate
Chair Eric Berg from office stunned
the ASSU yesterday, triggering a
wave of countercharges from senators
pledging to support their leader.
COP member David Porter told
The Daily that Berg has politicized
"what should be an apolitical posi
tion. ... A senate chair who is politi
cal can use that position to decide the
fate of most bills. He hasn't been
apolitical, and he's used his power to
affect decisions." In addition, he
claimed a number of people have
resigned from ASSU positions this
year because "they just did not want
to work with Eric Berg anymore."
In response, Berg said he was
"quite surprised" by the COP's
move, saying there is "a certain
amount of sour grapes going on on
their (the COP's) part."
Specifically, Berg said he thinks the
move for his ouster was the action of
a "frustrated" COP that had seen a
number of its proposal defeated in
the senate. He cited a recent COP
proposals to divide the salary of
former COP member Alice Wells
among the remaining members that
was "quite decisively defeated" by
the senate.
Graduate Senator Jim McGrath
said he feels the majority of senators
are behind Berg, a sentiment echoed
by Deputy Chair B. G. Porter. Porter
said there is "a common consensus"
among senators that Berg has done
an impressive job.
However, COP member Porter
said Berg has "a rather large ten
dency for abuses of power," but did
not give examples. "It's hard to say
there's been this abuse, that abuse.
This is a very controversial and very
decisive thing for the ASSU, and
we're trying to limit that," Porter
said.
COP member Todd Kerr said Berg
committed "the most blatant" abuse

of power of his term Tuesday night
when he moved a COP proposal di
rectly to a committee without first
bringing it to the senate. Kerr said the
action was "unprecedented" and a
"blatant usurpation of power."
The proposal in question involved
a move by the COP to seek funding
for the Guest Professorship Bureau
to finance speakers for a hunger con
ference to be held here spring quar
ter.
Berg said he "indicated quite some
time ago" that he intended to send

the matter to the Budget and Finance
Committee before it came before the
senate.
"I've maintained all along that
things should go through the commit
tees before they reach the senate
floor," Berg said, adding that he
thinks such a procedure allows for a
better-informed discussion in the sen
ate.
Berg said the senate chair has the
right to send a proposal directly to a
committee, quoting the bylaws: "Any
bill or resolution may be committed
by the chair to one or more appropri
ate committees of the senate for con
sideration . . . before reaching the
senate floor."
McGrath said he and other
senators were "in total sympathy with
