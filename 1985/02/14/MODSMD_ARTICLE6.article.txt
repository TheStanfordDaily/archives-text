# Reagan-proposed cuts spark local discussion

### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Staff writer 
Fierce competition from other appli
cants may not be the only obstacle pre
venting many qualified students from at
tending Stanford.
The impact of the proposed Reagan ad
ministration budget cuts for fiscal year
1986 concerning the Guaranteed Student
Loan (GSL) program and a "cap" of
$4,000 a year in federal aid would be
"catastrophic" for students, according to
Financial Aids Director Robert Huff.
The Reagan administration plans to put
a ceiling of $32,500 on the allowable fam
ily incomes of students requesting GSLs.
The proposed cuts also lower the amount
of aid a student can receive from the
federal government to $4,000 per year
from $7,000.
"It threatens about 40 percent of our

current federal funding for students," Huff
said. In dollar terms this runs around $7
million, he said.
Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo) held
hearings yesterday addressing the budget
cuts. Robert Freelen, vice president for
Public Affairs, Melissa Auchard, Council
of Presidents member, and Julie Petro,
director of the Lobby Office, were among
six panel members who testified on post
secondary education.
Freelen told Lantos the cuts would also
severely affect graduate students' ability to
finance their education. The annual aid
cap, if implemented, would decrease
graduates' borrowing power by 20 percent.
Approximately 1,200 graduates are cur
rently using GSLs and are borrowing ap
proximately $5,000 each. Huff said.
Freelen testified that, overall, prelimi

nary figures suggest that Stanford students
will lose $7 to $8 million annually, which is
equivalent to 40 to 50 percent of all
federal aid currently received.
These two changes in the GSL program
represent a $4.3 to $4.4 million cut to the
University, he said. The programs hit
hardest are those designed to assist
lower-income students, such as the Na
tional Direct Student Loan Program and
the Pell Grants; they will cost Stanford
more than $1.6 million per year.
The net effect will undoubtedly force
students to borrow money at higher inter
est rates to finance their educations, he
said.
Huff questioned the feasibility of the
new alternative programs proposed by the
Reagan administration. The banks are
"not too on unsubsidized loans," he
said. Many would have to go to the private

sector as an alternative source, which will
be much more expensive.
Two other panel members testifying
were from community colleges. They
agreed with the Reagan administration's
proposals, according to Auchard. Commu
nity college students would not be affected
as much by the proposed cuts because the
schools are financed by the state, Auchard
said.
Auchard and Petro testified to the panel
opposing the proposed financial aid cuts.
"People really listened to us," Auchard
said. Many older people and educators in
the audience identified with their tes
timony, she said.
In her testimony, Auchard told Lantos
that she was "overwhelmed with a
sense of frustration and fear for the
future ... I feel it is important that
these recommendations are attached
to people, not only considered in the
abstract."
She said people were surprised
when she said she worked 20 to 30
hours per week to help finance her
education.
"I am so busy working to stay in
school I miss out on school," she tes
tified. Auchard said she transferred
to UC-Berkeley for a semester, be
cause she thought her "other interests
and my need to explore the alterna
tive ways to serve my community
were too important to surrender."
Auchard closed her testimony by
questioning whether it was right to
provide the full advantages of a col
lege education — academics, extra
curricular and social activities — to
only the wealthy.
In defending the administration's
proposal Monday, Secretary of Edu

cation William Bennett said during a
press conference that in some cases
the cuts would simply force some stu
dents to "divest" themselves of their
stereos, automobiles and trips to the
beach.
In reponse Auchard asked, "Will
people really believe that so many
students are buying cars, stereos and
going on vacations with their aid
money?" The number of people who
need GSLs outweighs the people who
abuse them, she said.
Bennett also commented that the
financial-aid cuts will "like the rain,
fall on the just and the unjust alike."
Petro testified that "perhaps it is
more appropriate to say that from
low- and middle-income families, the
cuts will keep them back like driven
snow. When the weather is minus-40
degrees outside, no one goes out.
When there is little financial aid, the
would-be students are at home or
competing for low-paying jobs."
"The difference between the
weather and our budget is that one
we can't control and live with, the
other we can use to determine the
future of many others," she said.

Freelen proposed possible ways of
reducing government expenditures
for student aid. These include:
• Computing all GSLs on the basis of
a family's ability to pay rather than on
an arbitrary family income ceiling
that affects families in drastically dif
ferent ways;
• Instituting a stricter determination
of GSL eligibility by including the
family's liquid assets as well as
income;
• Changing the definition of a self-
students to include only
those students over 25 years of age
instead of the proposed cut off of 22.

financial-aid cuts will "like the rain,
fall on the just and the unjust alike."
Petro testified that "perhaps it is
more appropriate to say that from
low- and middle-income families, the
cuts will keep them back like driven
snow. When the weather is minus-40
degrees outside, no one goes out.
When there is little financial aid, the
would-be students are at home or
competing for low-paying jobs."
"The difference between the
weather and our budget is that one
we can't control and live with, the
other we can use to determine the
future of many others," she said.

Freelen proposed possible ways of
reducing government expenditures
for student aid. These include:
• Computing all GSLs on the basis of
a family's ability to pay rather than on
an arbitrary family income ceiling
that affects families in drastically dif
ferent ways;
• Instituting a stricter determination
of GSL eligibility by including the
family's liquid assets as well as
income;
• Changing the definition of a self-
students to include only
those students over 25 years of age
instead of the proposed cut off of 22.
Fierce competition from other appli
cants may not be the only obstacle pre
venting many qualified students from at
tending Stanford.
The impact of the proposed Reagan ad
ministration budget cuts for fiscal year
1986 concerning the Guaranteed Student
Loan (GSL) program and a "cap" of
$4,000 a year in federal aid would be
"catastrophic" for students, according to
Financial Aids Director Robert Huff.
The Reagan administration plans to put
a ceiling of $32,500 on the allowable fam
ily incomes of students requesting GSLs.
The proposed cuts also lower the amount
of aid a student can receive from the
federal government to $4,000 per year
from $7,000.
"It threatens about 40 percent of our

current federal funding for students," Huff
said. In dollar terms this runs around $7
million, he said.
Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo) held
hearings yesterday addressing the budget
cuts. Robert Freelen, vice president for
Public Affairs, Melissa Auchard, Council
of Presidents member, and Julie Petro,
director of the Lobby Office, were among
six panel members who testified on post
secondary education.
Freelen told Lantos the cuts would also
severely affect graduate students' ability to
finance their education. The annual aid
cap, if implemented, would decrease
graduates' borrowing power by 20 percent.
Approximately 1,200 graduates are cur
rently using GSLs and are borrowing ap
proximately $5,000 each. Huff said.
Freelen testified that, overall, prelimi

nary figures suggest that Stanford students
will lose $7 to $8 million annually, which is
equivalent to 40 to 50 percent of all
federal aid currently received.
These two changes in the GSL program
represent a $4.3 to $4.4 million cut to the
University, he said. The programs hit
hardest are those designed to assist
lower-income students, such as the Na
tional Direct Student Loan Program and
the Pell Grants; they will cost Stanford
more than $1.6 million per year.
The net effect will undoubtedly force
students to borrow money at higher inter
est rates to finance their educations, he
said.
Huff questioned the feasibility of the
new alternative programs proposed by the
Reagan administration. The banks are
"not too on unsubsidized loans," he
said. Many would have to go to the private

sector as an alternative source, which will
be much more expensive.
Two other panel members testifying
were from community colleges. They
agreed with the Reagan administration's
proposals, according to Auchard. Commu
nity college students would not be affected
as much by the proposed cuts because the
schools are financed by the state, Auchard
said.
Auchard and Petro testified to the panel
opposing the proposed financial aid cuts.
"People really listened to us," Auchard
said. Many older people and educators in
the audience identified with their tes
timony, she said.
In her testimony, Auchard told Lantos
that she was "overwhelmed with a
sense of frustration and fear for the
future ... I feel it is important that
these recommendations are attached
to people, not only considered in the
abstract."
She said people were surprised
when she said she worked 20 to 30
hours per week to help finance her
education.
"I am so busy working to stay in
school I miss out on school," she tes
tified. Auchard said she transferred
to UC-Berkeley for a semester, be
cause she thought her "other interests
and my need to explore the alterna
tive ways to serve my community
were too important to surrender."
Auchard closed her testimony by
questioning whether it was right to
provide the full advantages of a col
lege education — academics, extra
curricular and social activities — to
only the wealthy.
In defending the administration's
proposal Monday, Secretary of Edu

cation William Bennett said during a
press conference that in some cases
the cuts would simply force some stu
dents to "divest" themselves of their
stereos, automobiles and trips to the
beach.
In reponse Auchard asked, "Will
people really believe that so many
students are buying cars, stereos and
going on vacations with their aid
money?" The number of people who
need GSLs outweighs the people who
abuse them, she said.
Bennett also commented that the
financial-aid cuts will "like the rain,
fall on the just and the unjust alike."
Petro testified that "perhaps it is
more appropriate to say that from
low- and middle-income families, the
cuts will keep them back like driven
