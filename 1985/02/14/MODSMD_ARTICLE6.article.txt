# Reagan-proposed cuts spark local discussion

### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Staff writer 
Fierce competition from other appli
cants may not be the only obstacle pre
venting many qualified students from at
tending Stanford.
The impact of the proposed Reagan ad
ministration budget cuts for fiscal year
1986 concerning the Guaranteed Student
Loan (GSL) program and a "cap" of
$4,000 a year in federal aid would be
"catastrophic" for students, according to
Financial Aids Director Robert Huff.
The Reagan administration plans to put
a ceiling of $32,500 on the allowable fam
ily incomes of students requesting GSLs.
The proposed cuts also lower the amount
of aid a student can receive from the
federal government to $4,000 per year
from $7,000.
"It threatens about 40 percent of our

current federal funding for students," Huff
said. In dollar terms this runs around $7
million, he said.
Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo) held
hearings yesterday addressing the budget
cuts. Robert Freelen, vice president for
Public Affairs, Melissa Auchard, Council
of Presidents member, and Julie Petro,
director of the Lobby Office, were among
six panel members who testified on post
secondary education.
Freelen told Lantos the cuts would also
severely affect graduate students' ability to
finance their education. The annual aid
cap, if implemented, would decrease
graduates' borrowing power by 20 percent.
Approximately 1,200 graduates are cur
rently using GSLs and are borrowing ap
proximately $5,000 each. Huff said.
Freelen testified that, overall, prelimi

nary figures suggest that Stanford students
will lose $7 to $8 million annually, which is
equivalent to 40 to 50 percent of all
federal aid currently received.
These two changes in the GSL program
represent a $4.3 to $4.4 million cut to the
University, he said. The programs hit
hardest are those designed to assist
lower-income students, such as the Na
tional Direct Student Loan Program and
the Pell Grants; they will cost Stanford
more than $1.6 million per year.
The net effect will undoubtedly force
students to borrow money at higher inter
est rates to finance their educations, he
said.
Huff questioned the feasibility of the
new alternative programs proposed by the
Reagan administration. The banks are
"not too on unsubsidized loans," he
said. Many would have to go to the private

sector as an alternative source, which will
be much more expensive.
Two other panel members testifying
were from community colleges. They
agreed with the Reagan administration's
proposals, according to Auchard. Commu
nity college students would not be affected
as much by the proposed cuts because the
schools are financed by the state, Auchard
said.
Auchard and Petro testified to the panel
opposing the proposed financial aid cuts.
"People really listened to us," Auchard
said. Many older people and educators in
the audience identified with their tes
timony, she said.
In her testimony, Auchard told Lantos
