# Attorney explains sports law
## 
### LARRY GREEN Staff writer 
"Sports law, on a more practical level, is akin to the
wild, wild West," according to one of the country's top
sports attorneys.
In a speech yesterday at the law school, Leigh Steinberg
touched on a few of the issues in his area of sports
negotiation and offered several of his insights on the
sports world in general.
"It's a tough field to work in," he said. "It requires tre
mendous patience and the ability to sit through anything."
Steinberg's current clients include Mark Gastineau of
the New York Jets, the highest paid defensive lineman
ever. Warren Moon of the Houston Oilers, signed to the
largest contract in NFL history, and Steve Young of the
USFL's Los Angeles Express, who last year signed a con
tract for a reported sum of $40 million in salary and an
nuities.
Steinberg's key to success in attracting top athletes and
signing them to top contracts stems from his early
friendship with Atlanta Falcons quarterback Steve
Bartkowski at UC-Berkeley. In 1975, when the NFL draft
was approaching, Bartkowski asked Steinberg to repre
sent him. Bartkowski then became the top draft pick of
that year and Steinberg negotiated the then-largest NFL
contract.
He said research is the key to working out such large

contracts. An avid novel reader and subscriber to more
than 30 newspapers, Steinberg said the negotiating
process begins before "the client walks into the room. The
first key is to research the values of your client."
Most athletes in college are approached by agents, a
term Steinberg seemed to dislike, who show them what
they call "the good life" and then sign them to binding
contracts.
"The scholarship level of athletes (in college) is set ar
tificially low and (in essence) the athletes are getting set
up to be bribed," he said.
Most agents make contracts with teams that entitle the
players to large amounts of deferred money. The players,
often "just young kids right out of school" in the NFL's
case, usually mistake these deferments as "long-term se
curity," Steinberg said.
But Steinberg pointed out that if inflation, the agent's
percentage of the contract and the signing bonus are taken
into account, many of the players end up losing. Players
are often deluded by the mystique of the "million-dollar"
contract, he said.
The next important step in sports negotiating is "to re
search your client in a football sense." This involves
checking out what kind of impact the player can have on
the city, the team and even the league. The final step.

Steinberg discussed the value of research in sports law during a speech at Stanford Law School
yesterday.
Steinberg said, is to research the team
itself.
An important part of the negotiat
ing process involves never rushing
headfirst into discussing money,
Steinberg said. He said this is a major
distinction between agents and sports
attorneys.
Steinberg said the Bartkowski deal
is a good example of his negotiating
style.
"I got a sense of the tremendous
impact athletes had in many cities. I
felt that athletes could be role
models," he said. In that deal, Stein
berg eventually negotiated a clause in
which Bartkowski would take a pay
cut if the Falcons promised to lower
ticket prices.
Over the years Steinberg has seen
to it that many of his clients have used
their "high profile" as athletes to help
the community. Eleven of his NFL
clients have paid back their scholar
ships to their schools.
Steinberg said Young has "already
given $183,000 to Brigham Young,"

his alma mater. Citing St. Louis Card
inal quarterback Neil Lomax and
Detriot Lions tight end David Lewis
as other examples, he said, "It's their
way of saying thanks to the school for
shaping their lives."
Steinberg descibed the current
NFL salary structure as "at a peak
because of the impact of the USFL."
He said that the NFL draft limits the
entry-level freedom of players be
cause once they are chosen by a team
it is difficult to go elsewhere.
Contracts in the NFL are surpris
ingly unguaranteed, Steinberg said,
unless the player gets a "skilled guar
antee," such as in professional
baseball. This means that the team
has the option of cutting a player at
any time.
Leverage is the key to negotiating
the major contracts that Steinberg
has accomplished, he said.
"The ability to walk away from the
table is very important," he said. "We
give them (the team being negotiated
with) every chance to be fair. The key
is to not lock people into positions
where they feel you've abused their
trust." Ultimately, when money
comes into the negotiating picture,
Steinberg said, "The price is

whatever the market can bear ... the
trick is to leave the player maximally
compensated."

shaping their lives."
Steinberg descibed the current
NFL salary structure as "at a peak
because of the impact of the USFL."
He said that the NFL draft limits the
entry-level freedom of players be
cause once they are chosen by a team
it is difficult to go elsewhere.
Contracts in the NFL are surpris
ingly unguaranteed, Steinberg said,
unless the player gets a "skilled guar
antee," such as in professional
baseball. This means that the team
has the option of cutting a player at
any time.
Leverage is the key to negotiating
the major contracts that Steinberg
has accomplished, he said.
"The ability to walk away from the
table is very important," he said. "We
give them (the team being negotiated
with) every chance to be fair. The key
is to not lock people into positions
where they feel you've abused their
trust." Ultimately, when money
comes into the negotiating picture,
Steinberg said, "The price is

whatever the market can bear ... the
trick is to leave the player maximally
compensated."
"Sports law, on a more practical level, is akin to the
wild, wild West," according to one of the country's top
sports attorneys.
In a speech yesterday at the law school, Leigh Steinberg
touched on a few of the issues in his area of sports
negotiation and offered several of his insights on the
sports world in general.
"It's a tough field to work in," he said. "It requires tre
mendous patience and the ability to sit through anything."
Steinberg's current clients include Mark Gastineau of
the New York Jets, the highest paid defensive lineman
ever. Warren Moon of the Houston Oilers, signed to the
largest contract in NFL history, and Steve Young of the
USFL's Los Angeles Express, who last year signed a con
tract for a reported sum of $40 million in salary and an
nuities.
Steinberg's key to success in attracting top athletes and
signing them to top contracts stems from his early
friendship with Atlanta Falcons quarterback Steve
Bartkowski at UC-Berkeley. In 1975, when the NFL draft
was approaching, Bartkowski asked Steinberg to repre
sent him. Bartkowski then became the top draft pick of
that year and Steinberg negotiated the then-largest NFL
contract.
He said research is the key to working out such large

contracts. An avid novel reader and subscriber to more
than 30 newspapers, Steinberg said the negotiating
process begins before "the client walks into the room. The
first key is to research the values of your client."
Most athletes in college are approached by agents, a
term Steinberg seemed to dislike, who show them what
they call "the good life" and then sign them to binding
contracts.
"The scholarship level of athletes (in college) is set ar
tificially low and (in essence) the athletes are getting set
up to be bribed," he said.
Most agents make contracts with teams that entitle the
players to large amounts of deferred money. The players,
often "just young kids right out of school" in the NFL's
case, usually mistake these deferments as "long-term se
curity," Steinberg said.
But Steinberg pointed out that if inflation, the agent's
percentage of the contract and the signing bonus are taken
into account, many of the players end up losing. Players
are often deluded by the mystique of the "million-dollar"
contract, he said.
The next important step in sports negotiating is "to re
search your client in a football sense." This involves
checking out what kind of impact the player can have on
the city, the team and even the league. The final step.

Steinberg discussed the value of research in sports law during a speech at Stanford Law School
yesterday.
Steinberg said, is to research the team
itself.
An important part of the negotiat
ing process involves never rushing
headfirst into discussing money,
Steinberg said. He said this is a major
distinction between agents and sports
attorneys.
Steinberg said the Bartkowski deal
is a good example of his negotiating
style.
"I got a sense of the tremendous
impact athletes had in many cities. I
felt that athletes could be role
models," he said. In that deal, Stein
berg eventually negotiated a clause in
which Bartkowski would take a pay
cut if the Falcons promised to lower
ticket prices.
Over the years Steinberg has seen
to it that many of his clients have used
their "high profile" as athletes to help
the community. Eleven of his NFL
clients have paid back their scholar
ships to their schools.
Steinberg said Young has "already
given $183,000 to Brigham Young,"

his alma mater. Citing St. Louis Card
inal quarterback Neil Lomax and
Detriot Lions tight end David Lewis
as other examples, he said, "It's their
way of saying thanks to the school for
shaping their lives."
