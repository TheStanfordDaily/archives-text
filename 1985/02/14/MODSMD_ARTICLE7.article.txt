# Attorney explains sports law

"Sports law, on a more practical level, is akin to the
wild, wild West," according to one of the country's top
sports attorneys.
In a speech yesterday at the law school, Leigh Steinberg
touched on a few of the issues in his area of sports
negotiation and offered several of his insights on the
sports world in general.
"It's a tough field to work in," he said. "It requires tre
mendous patience and the ability to sit through anything."
Steinberg's current clients include Mark Gastineau of
the New York Jets, the highest paid defensive lineman
ever. Warren Moon of the Houston Oilers, signed to the
largest contract in NFL history, and Steve Young of the
USFL's Los Angeles Express, who last year signed a con
tract for a reported sum of $40 million in salary and an
nuities.
Steinberg's key to success in attracting top athletes and
signing them to top contracts stems from his early
friendship with Atlanta Falcons quarterback Steve
Bartkowski at UC-Berkeley. In 1975, when the NFL draft
was approaching, Bartkowski asked Steinberg to repre
sent him. Bartkowski then became the top draft pick of
that year and Steinberg negotiated the then-largest NFL
contract.
He said research is the key to working out such large

contracts. An avid novel reader and subscriber to more
than 30 newspapers, Steinberg said the negotiating
process begins before "the client walks into the room. The
first key is to research the values of your client."
Most athletes in college are approached by agents, a
term Steinberg seemed to dislike, who show them what
they call "the good life" and then sign them to binding
contracts.
"The scholarship level of athletes (in college) is set ar
tificially low and (in essence) the athletes are getting set
up to be bribed," he said.
Most agents make contracts with teams that entitle the
players to large amounts of deferred money. The players,
often "just young kids right out of school" in the NFL's
case, usually mistake these deferments as "long-term se
curity," Steinberg said.
But Steinberg pointed out that if inflation, the agent's
percentage of the contract and the signing bonus are taken
into account, many of the players end up losing. Players
are often deluded by the mystique of the "million-dollar"
contract, he said.
The next important step in sports negotiating is "to re
search your client in a football sense." This involves
checking out what kind of impact the player can have on
the city, the team and even the league. The final step.
