Europe may face unified terrorists
BRUSSELS, Belgium - An outburst of terrorist activity across the
Continent has triggered a wave of fear in government and industry that a
European brotherhood of terrorism may be in the making.
The attacks, mainly aimed at NATO's defense system and its sup
pliers, caused little stir last fall when they erupted sporadically. No lives
were taken. There were no signs of cooperation among terrorists.
That changed suddenly on Jan. 15 with a joint declaration by West
Germany's anarchist Red Army Faction and France's left-wing Direct
Action that they were joining forces against the U.S.-led N ATO military
alliance and other "imperialist" targets in Western Europe.
Ten days later, Rene Audran, director of arms sales at the French
defense ministry, was ambushed and shot to death in his car outside his
suburban Paris home. Direct Action claimed responsibility.
The West German group struck next. Its target: Ernst Zimmermann,
chairman of a West German company that makes engines for NATO's
Tornado jets. He was shot in the head by intruders who burst into his
home near Munich on Feb. 1.
Other terrorist bombings and arson attacks directed at N ATO instal
lations, its personnel or companies that do business with it have occurred
recently in France, West Germany, Belgium, Portugal and Greece.
The violence, and worries about coordinated terrorist attacks in the
future," have prompted European governments to increase security
precautions and to consider coordinating their and-terrorist tactics.
A flurry of diplomatic activity has produced these results:
France and West Germany have set up a special group of security ex
perts to coordinate anti-terrorist efforts.
France has selected its top police officer, Robert Broussard, to head a
new national police campaign against terrorism.
Italy's interior minister, Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, has sounded out France.
Belgium, Spain and other West European countries about an Italian
proposal for a high-level conference on anti-terrorist measures to be at
tended by the 10 European Common Market nations.
The cross-"border talks also have exposed obstacles to a unified stance.
Italy, for example, has criticized France for its tradition of providing
asylum to political refugees. Speaking to the Italian Parliament last
week, Premier Bettino Craxi accused the French government of present
ing "difficulties" to Italy's requests for extradition of long-sought terror
ists and suspects living in France.
Uganda may hold early elections
NAIROBI, Kenya —• Uganda is being plagued by increasing political
repression and chronic famine only 10 months before a scheduled gen
eral election.
An insurgency in the East African country has failed to calm down
despite the ousting of dictator Idi Amin in 1979 and heavy fighting has
been reported between government troops and rebels.
Rumors abound in the capital Kampala that the elections will be held
at an earlier date in the face of continuing unrest At the same time
famine is also spreading in the land-around the Victoria Lake.
The Red Cross estimates that between 300 ami 400 people have died
of hunger in the northwestern part of the country during the past six
months. Another 115,000 people are in acute danger of dying from
famine, it said. The Red Cross is now distributing food in four centers.
The situation is also looking bad in the eastern province of Karamoya
where about 30,000 people died in the famine of 1981.
With its attention focused on the upcoming elections the army started
late last year a new offensive against the guerrilla stronghold in the
Luwero district, about 124 miles northwest of Kampala — but ap
parently again without much success.
The government of President Milton Obote has spoken of fleeing
refugees and deserters. However according to accounts of independent
eyewitnesses, who traveled through the troubled areas, there is still
heavy fighting going on in the Luwero district.
Meanwhile, the rebels are Claiming they have killed more than 200
soldiers including North Korean and Tanzanian troops. But the Obote '
government has repeatedly denied foreign troop involvement in the
fighting.
Since the start of the election campaign a few weeks ago, Obote's crit
ics have come under increasing pressure. Apart from the ruling Uganda
People's Congress three other parties are likely to take part in the elec
tion.
But the strongest opposition group, the conservative Catholic Demo
cratic Party has said that "the environment cannot permit the holding of
free and fair elections."
Manila blaze kills five Americans
MANILA, Philippines — Heavy smoke and intense heat today forced
back firefighters trying to recover more bodies from a luxury hotel
where a fire, still burning after a day and a half, has killed at least 30
people.
Among the confirmed dead in the fire — which broke out early yes
terday — were five Americans, three Britons and a Canadian.
A fire official at the scene, who asked not to be identified, said 30
bodies had been recovered or spotted inside the smoke-filled hallways of
the 11 -story, 464-room Regent of Manila hotel by this morning.
"It was simply a ghastly, terrible, terrible thing," said Michael Mat
thews, a Regent International official from Hong Kong who met with a
group of surviving guests today at a nearby hotel.
Matthews promised guests $ 100 each for emergency clothing and help
with travel documents and airline tickets but declined to answer ques
tions about the fire.
Police were investigating the cause of the blaze, the worst of six
Philippine hotel fires in the past four months.
Forty people died in three of the previous fires which police blamed
on arsonists. A man charged in a fire last October at the Pines Hotel in
Baguio that killed 23 people, including eight Americans, escaped from
military guards in that northern city last week.
The cause of the Regent fire was not yet known, but one fire official,
Col. Rodolfo Villavicencio, said it may have been arson. "To me it looks
suspicious because the lateral spread was quick and the alarm was
delayed."
Most of the bodies recovered were found on stairway landings. Vil
lavicencio said he feared more victims among the hotel's estimated 370
guests and an undetermined number of employees may have suffocated
as they jammed smoke-filled hallways.
Police said earlier that 160 guests had been transferred to the nearby
Hyatt and that they did not know the whereabouts of more than 150
others. They said some of the others may have moved to other hotels on
their own.
New Zealand denied Soviet reports
LONDON — The United States has blocked New Zealand from re
ceiving top-level intelligence on the Soviet Union in reaction to the
refusal of the New Zealand government to allow a U.S. destroyer to
make a port call, Jane's Defense Weekly reported.
The article in Jane's edition appearing Tuesday quoted "reliable
sources" in the Australian capital of Canberra.
The reported move would represent the most serious U.S. action
against New Zealand, a member of the 1951 Australian-New Zealand-
United States military defense alliance known as ANZUS.
In Washington, several U.S. officials declined to momment on the
Jane's report, saying they prohibited from discussing intelligence mat
ters. But one official, who insisted on anonymity, said he understood the
administration was "making things tough" for New Zealand.
Jane's said New Zealand was ordered cut from the list of recipients of
intercepted radio communications on Feb. 4, when Prime minister David
Lange announced for the second time that the destroyer could not dock
unless the United States guaranteed the ship was not carrying nuclear
weapons.
"Basically, the American government is saying, 'If you don't play ball
with us and let our ship into your harbor, we won't play ball with you and
give you any signals intelligence,' " Richard Coltart of Jane's said.

The Red Cross estimates that between 300 ami 400 people have died
of hunger in the northwestern part of the country during the past six
months. Another 115,000 people are in acute danger of dying from
famine, it said. The Red Cross is now distributing food in four centers.
The situation is also looking bad in the eastern province of Karamoya
where about 30,000 people died in the famine of 1981.
With its attention focused on the upcoming elections the army started
late last year a new offensive against the guerrilla stronghold in the
Luwero district, about 124 miles northwest of Kampala — but ap
parently again without much success.
The government of President Milton Obote has spoken of fleeing
refugees and deserters. However according to accounts of independent
eyewitnesses, who traveled through the troubled areas, there is still
heavy fighting going on in the Luwero district.
Meanwhile, the rebels are Claiming they have killed more than 200
soldiers including North Korean and Tanzanian troops. But the Obote '
government has repeatedly denied foreign troop involvement in the
fighting.
Since the start of the election campaign a few weeks ago, Obote's crit
ics have come under increasing pressure. Apart from the ruling Uganda
People's Congress three other parties are likely to take part in the elec
tion.
But the strongest opposition group, the conservative Catholic Demo
cratic Party has said that "the environment cannot permit the holding of
free and fair elections."
Manila blaze kills five Americans
MANILA, Philippines — Heavy smoke and intense heat today forced
back firefighters trying to recover more bodies from a luxury hotel
where a fire, still burning after a day and a half, has killed at least 30
people.
Among the confirmed dead in the fire — which broke out early yes
terday — were five Americans, three Britons and a Canadian.
A fire official at the scene, who asked not to be identified, said 30
bodies had been recovered or spotted inside the smoke-filled hallways of
the 11 -story, 464-room Regent of Manila hotel by this morning.
"It was simply a ghastly, terrible, terrible thing," said Michael Mat
thews, a Regent International official from Hong Kong who met with a
group of surviving guests today at a nearby hotel.
Matthews promised guests $ 100 each for emergency clothing and help
with travel documents and airline tickets but declined to answer ques
tions about the fire.
Police were investigating the cause of the blaze, the worst of six
Philippine hotel fires in the past four months.
Forty people died in three of the previous fires which police blamed
on arsonists. A man charged in a fire last October at the Pines Hotel in
Baguio that killed 23 people, including eight Americans, escaped from
military guards in that northern city last week.
The cause of the Regent fire was not yet known, but one fire official,
Col. Rodolfo Villavicencio, said it may have been arson. "To me it looks
suspicious because the lateral spread was quick and the alarm was
delayed."
Most of the bodies recovered were found on stairway landings. Vil
lavicencio said he feared more victims among the hotel's estimated 370
guests and an undetermined number of employees may have suffocated
as they jammed smoke-filled hallways.
Police said earlier that 160 guests had been transferred to the nearby
Hyatt and that they did not know the whereabouts of more than 150
others. They said some of the others may have moved to other hotels on
their own.
New Zealand denied Soviet reports
LONDON — The United States has blocked New Zealand from re
ceiving top-level intelligence on the Soviet Union in reaction to the
refusal of the New Zealand government to allow a U.S. destroyer to
make a port call, Jane's Defense Weekly reported.
The article in Jane's edition appearing Tuesday quoted "reliable
sources" in the Australian capital of Canberra.
The reported move would represent the most serious U.S. action
against New Zealand, a member of the 1951 Australian-New Zealand-
United States military defense alliance known as ANZUS.
In Washington, several U.S. officials declined to momment on the
Jane's report, saying they prohibited from discussing intelligence mat
ters. But one official, who insisted on anonymity, said he understood the
administration was "making things tough" for New Zealand.
Jane's said New Zealand was ordered cut from the list of recipients of
intercepted radio communications on Feb. 4, when Prime minister David
Lange announced for the second time that the destroyer could not dock
unless the United States guaranteed the ship was not carrying nuclear
weapons.
"Basically, the American government is saying, 'If you don't play ball
with us and let our ship into your harbor, we won't play ball with you and
give you any signals intelligence,' " Richard Coltart of Jane's said.
Europe may face unified terrorists
BRUSSELS, Belgium - An outburst of terrorist activity across the
Continent has triggered a wave of fear in government and industry that a
European brotherhood of terrorism may be in the making.
The attacks, mainly aimed at NATO's defense system and its sup
pliers, caused little stir last fall when they erupted sporadically. No lives
were taken. There were no signs of cooperation among terrorists.
That changed suddenly on Jan. 15 with a joint declaration by West
Germany's anarchist Red Army Faction and France's left-wing Direct
Action that they were joining forces against the U.S.-led N ATO military
alliance and other "imperialist" targets in Western Europe.
Ten days later, Rene Audran, director of arms sales at the French
defense ministry, was ambushed and shot to death in his car outside his
suburban Paris home. Direct Action claimed responsibility.
The West German group struck next. Its target: Ernst Zimmermann,
chairman of a West German company that makes engines for NATO's
Tornado jets. He was shot in the head by intruders who burst into his
home near Munich on Feb. 1.
Other terrorist bombings and arson attacks directed at N ATO instal
lations, its personnel or companies that do business with it have occurred
recently in France, West Germany, Belgium, Portugal and Greece.
The violence, and worries about coordinated terrorist attacks in the
future," have prompted European governments to increase security
precautions and to consider coordinating their and-terrorist tactics.
A flurry of diplomatic activity has produced these results:
France and West Germany have set up a special group of security ex
perts to coordinate anti-terrorist efforts.
France has selected its top police officer, Robert Broussard, to head a
new national police campaign against terrorism.
Italy's interior minister, Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, has sounded out France.
Belgium, Spain and other West European countries about an Italian
proposal for a high-level conference on anti-terrorist measures to be at
tended by the 10 European Common Market nations.
The cross-"border talks also have exposed obstacles to a unified stance.
Italy, for example, has criticized France for its tradition of providing
asylum to political refugees. Speaking to the Italian Parliament last
week, Premier Bettino Craxi accused the French government of present
ing "difficulties" to Italy's requests for extradition of long-sought terror
ists and suspects living in France.
Uganda may hold early elections
NAIROBI, Kenya —• Uganda is being plagued by increasing political
repression and chronic famine only 10 months before a scheduled gen
eral election.
An insurgency in the East African country has failed to calm down
despite the ousting of dictator Idi Amin in 1979 and heavy fighting has
been reported between government troops and rebels.
Rumors abound in the capital Kampala that the elections will be held
at an earlier date in the face of continuing unrest At the same time
