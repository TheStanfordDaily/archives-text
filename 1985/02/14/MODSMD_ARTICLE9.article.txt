# Reagan hopeful about agreement
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — President Reagan said yes
terday that "it seems as if some progress has been
made" in the agreement of Jordan's King Hussein
and Palestine Liberation Organization chairman
Yasser Arafat, and others in his administration
were increasingly hopeful about the latest Mideast
diplomatic development.
Reagan's comment came in a brief exchange with
reporters as he boarded his helicopter for a five
day California vacation. Several hours later the
White House released a communique on Reagan's
meetings Monday and Tuesday with Saudi Arabia's
King Fadh, in which the president "renewed his
pledge" to support his 1982 peace plan "in direct
negotiations involving the parties most concerned."
"We're being optimistic about it," Reagan told
reporters in reference to the Hussein-Arafat
"framework for common action" that was con
cluded Monday in Amman.
A senior administration official who briefed
reporters at Point Mugu, where Air Force
One landed with the vacation-bound president,
referred to the "framework" agreement as "a mile
stone" but also termed it "one step in a long road."

"Before, there had never been a Palestinian
commitment to the peaceful resolution of the prob
lem. Now there is," said the senior official, who did
not permit use of his name.
The official avoided placing the acceptance di
rectly within the "framework" of U.N. Security
Council resolution 242, which the administration
has singled out as an essential foundation for Arab-
Israeli talks.
Diplomatic sources and press reports from the
area said that the principle of trading territory for
peace, which is the basic bargain envisioned in
resolution 242, is endorsed in the "framework"
agreement, but that the resolution is not mentioned
by name.
The senior official briefing the White House
press corps said the agreement as he understands it
"implies the acceptance of the major principle of
resolution 242."
State Department officials said it seemed signifi
cant that the Hussein-Arafat agreement was
reached while the Saudi king was in Washington, in
time for the Arab leader to discuss the accord with
Reagan.

One reason for this might have been a desire of
Hussein, Arafat and Egypt's President Hosni
Mubarak to involve the Saudis as much as possible
as backers and even sponsors of the agreement.
Fahd is principal author of the September 1982
Fez declaration of the Arab League, which is the
most recent unified position of the Arab states on
the conflict with Israel. The Hussein-Arafat
framework goes beyond the Fez plan. For one
thing, it does not call for an independent Palestin
ian state having Jerusalem as its capital.
In yesterday's U.S.-Saudi communique, Fahd
spoke of the Fez plan as providing "a just basis for
negotiations leading to a comprehensive peace.''
Reagan in turn "expressed his appreciation for
the Fez consensus, positive elements of which have
been recognized by the United States."
The communique said Reagan and Fahd
"stressed that a stable peace must provide security
for all states in the area and for the exercise of the
legitimate rights of the Palestinian people."
The meetings of Reagan and Fahd, the com
munique said, "charted the course for continued
development of U.S.-Saudi relations."
