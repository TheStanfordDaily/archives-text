# Vietnamese overrun strongholds

KHAO SARAPEE, Thailand —
Vietnamese troops and armor sweep
ing through the jungle behind a fero
cious artillery barrage overran one
Khmer Rouge stronghold yesterday
and seized part of another in the
western Cambodia mountains, Thai
military officers reported.
The Thai border commander
predicted the entire guerrilla complex
would fall by today. A knowledgeable
Soviet bloc diplomat said it may be
the "turning point of the war" that
broke out after Vietnam invaded
Cambodia and ousted Pol Pot's
Khmer Rouge regime in January
1979.
With guerrilla forward defense
lines shattered by three days of with
ering artillery fire, 13,000 Viet
namese troops surged from the south
and east in a pincer movement that
overwhelmed the Khao Din stron
ghold and captured half the guerrilla
headquarters at Phnom Malai, said
Col. Chettha Thannajaro, deputy
commander of the Eastern (border)
Field Force.
The force commander said Viet

namese troops were within two miles
of Phum Thmei, the communist
Khmer Rouge showcase camp and re
ported operations center that Phnom
Malai protected. Maj. Gen. Salya
Sriphen said it could be over by today
for the Khmer Rouge in the steaming,
malarial enclave that juts like a tooth
into Thailand.
Hundreds of guerrillas fleeing the
assault on Khao Din trudged
northward near this hamlet about 19
miles south of the key Thai border
town of Aranyaprathet. The seasoned
fighters, who have roamed the Cam
bodia countryside for years, took
everything with them — field guns,
food, even war elephants.
Also driven by the Vietnamese of
fensive, which intensified with a rain
of thousands of artillery and mortar
rounds Tuesday, were up to 40,000
civilians fleeing every major Khmer
Rouge-controlled camp along the 40-
mile battlefromt south of
Aranyaprathet.
They made their way into
Thailand, joining 160,000 who

already had sought haven from the
three-month-long offensive and
30,000 more who fled last April.
Vietnam turned its guns on the
Khmer Rouge in western Battam
bang Province after overrunning
bases of another guerrilla group, the
Khmer People's National Liberation
Front. The two-pronged drive was
designed to trap the guerrillas in the
pocket with their backs to the border
of Thailand's Prachiburi province.
The two guerrilla groups are
against the Vietnamese-installed
Heng Samrin government with a third
led by the former Cambodian chief of
state, Prince Norodom Sihanouk. The
National Liberation Front and
Sihanouk's guerrillas are non
communist.
Deputy Commander Chetha,
reached by telephone, said 6,000
troops from Vietnam's 59th Division
drove northward and seized Khao
Din, along with some guerrilla out
posts as insurance against ambushes.
The troops advanced to less than two
miles south of Phum Thmei, he said.
The Phum Thmei-Phnom Malai

area is about 14 miles south of
Aranyaprathet and the Khao Din
base is about 20 miles south of the
Thai border town.
Another tank-led column of 5,000
troops of the 7th and Bth Divisions
advanced westward towards Phnom
Malai, positioning itself about 6 miles
from the stronghold to prevent the
guerrillas from fleeing into the inte
rior, Chettha said.
He said the guerrillas were blocked
on the southeastern flank by 2.000
troops moving between the two other
units.
Officers at the Eastern Field Force
estimated that 4,000 guerrillas were
defending Phnom Malai. Salya, the
field force commander, said Vietnam
had about 40,000 troops in the
Phnom Malai-Khao din area led by
20 tanks.
The Thai army expects the final as
sault on Phnom Malai to spill across
the frontier, and has put the area just
south of Aranyapra thet on full alert.
Thai reinforcements can be seen
every day moving out of the border
town to points south.
