Cuts decried at hearing
NEW ORLEANS — The president of the U.S.
Conference of Mayors told a Congressional
hearing on education yesterday that the Reagan
administration thinks "defense is its only respon
sibility."
Mayor Dutch Morial of New Orleans said ad
justments must be made in the president's list of
priorities. Reducing federal aid to education
hurts kids who need help most, he added.
"So it disturbs me greatly, since I live in a com
munity where one out of every five families is
classified as below the poverty line, and one out
of every two black families lives in poverty — it
disturbs me greatly to see some leaders in Wash
ington act as if the public education system is
headed toward extinction," he said.
The mayor spoke at a hearing by the House
Education and Labor Committee on a move to
trim $3 billion off the Department of Education
budget for fiscal 1986.
In general, under the current $18.4 billion
budget, federal education programs are "frozen"
at that level.
Rep. Augustus Hawkins (D-Calif.), committee
chairman, said the freeze actually amounts to a
reduction because local school districts just ab
sorb the cost of inflation, which probably will be
around 5 percent.
Justice probes FBI 'bug'
NEW YORK — The Justice Department has
completed an investigation of charges that the

FBI wrongly obtained wiretaps now being used
against Labor Secretary Raymond Donovan, and
is sharing its findings with prosecutors, officials
said yesterday.
Stephen Bookin, an assistant district attorney
in the Bronx, declined to discuss the findings of
the inquiry and said authorities had not decided
on any possible action, including steps against the
FBI agents involved.
However, he said the Justice Department,
after more than a month of delay, was cooperat
ing with his efforts to defend the wiretaps as
evidence in the criminal case against Donovan
and nine other men.
John Russell, a Justice Department spokesman
in Washington, confirmed that investigators had
completed their "spadework" into allegations
about the wiretaps, but that there had been no
decision on any action.
The wiretaps and an electronic "bugs" were
placed in 1979 in the office of William Masselli, a
reputed organized crime figure and now a co
defendant in the Donovan case, which involves
alleged fraud in a subway construction project.
Masselli charges that FBI agents deceived a
federal judge into authorizing the surveillance by
concealing that they already had an informer in
his office. His lawyer has called the surveillance
"legally rancid" and wants it rejected as
evidence.
Bookin revealed the federal inquiry on Jan. 9,
when he said in state court that the Justice De
partment was refusing to cooperate with him
while it investigated the allegations concerning
the wiretaps.

But yesterday, at another hearing in the trial
level state court, Bookin said the federal inves
tigators have let him review transcripts of 50 in
terviews and agreed to let him conduct at least
three interviews of his own, including two of FBI
agents.
Hotel fire kills five
HIGH POINT, N.C. — Fire struck a Civil
War-era hotel used as a home for transients last
night, killing five people and critically burning a
sixth, police said.
The blaze at the three-story Biltmore Hotel
erupted shortly after another fire had been
brought under control at the Wachovia Bank &
Trust Co., said police Capt. R.J. McGuire. Both
fires were brought under control.
Six people were trapped on the roof of the four
story bank, but were rescued by firefighters,
MacGuire said.
The hotel fire, which was called in at 7:21 p.m.,
apparently was confined to the top floor,
McGuire said.
The Biltmore serves as a home for transients
and 28 of its 35 rooms were occupied, he said.
The building has been plagued by mattress fires
recently, McGuire added.
Market mixed
The stock market turned mixed in heavy
trading today, bogging down at the 1,300 level in
the Dow Jones industrial average.
