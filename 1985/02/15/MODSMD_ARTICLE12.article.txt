Jury split over sentence
SANTA CRUZ — A hung jury in the Royal
Hayes murder trial could not agree yesterday
whether the convicted double killer should die in
the gas chamber.
Nine jurors voted for the death penalty for
Hayes, 47, while three voted for life imprison
ment without possibility of parole. A unanimous
jury is required for a death sentence to be issued.
The eight-woman, four-man panel announced
the stalemate about 2 p.m. yesterday in Santa
Cruz Superior Court.
Hayes was convicted on Feb. 5 of two counts of
first-degree murder, assault with a deadly
weapon, false imprisonment and possession of
cocaine in the killings of Lauren deLaet, 36. and
Donald Mac Vicar, 32, on Dec. 29. 1982.
Prosecutor Madeleine Boriss had asked the
jury to hand down a death sentence for Hayes,
calling him a "cavalier psychopath."
Boriss has indicated she will not ask for a new
jury to review the case and decide the penalty

again, wnich is an option lor iici.
If she does not ask for another decision on the
death sentence, Hayes, who has a previous his
tory of mental and legal problems, probably will
be sentenced to life in prison without the possi
bility of parole.
Whitnesses in the two-month trial, including
two women who said they helped Hayes arrange
the murders, testified that the victims thought
they were going to a remote spot on the Univer
sity of California-Santa Cruz campus to pick up
$250,000 of cocaine.
Frito-Lay recalls Fritos
DALLAS — Frito-Lay Inc. yesterday began a
voluntary recall of 3,000 bags of Fritos corn chips
in Southern California, warning that some of the
packages may contain aluminum shavings.
The three-quarter ounce packages of regular,
unflavored corn chips are imprinted with a prod
uct date of March 4, with the letters LA immedi

ately below, company spokesperson Elliot Bloom
said.
They are distributed primarily through conces
sions and restaurants and not through grocery
outlets. Bloom said.
Affected counties are Los Angeles, Riverside,
San Bernadino, Ventura, Kern, San Luis Obisbo,
Santa Barbara and Orange, he said.
"Although this recall involves less than 3,000
small, three-quarter ounce packages, it is being
recovered as a precautionary measure," Bloom
said.
Aluminum shavings may have dropped into
the chips during packaging at Frito-Lay's Los
Angeles plant, he said.
Other corn chips and Frito products were not
affected by the recall, Bloom said.
Today's weather
Partly sunny today and pleasant. High in the
