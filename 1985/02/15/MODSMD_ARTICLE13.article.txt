## African activist engages in drama and music 
### MARK LAWRENCE 
If you are a Stanford student,
chances are you have seen Awetu
Simesso — perhaps as an actor in a
drama production, as a musician in
his Ethiopian band, as a lecturer on
African politics, as a speaker appeal
ing for Ethiopian famine relief, as
a teaching assistant in political sci
ence courses or as a guest on a televi
sion talk show.
Simesso, 30, is a graduate student
in political science and communica
tion who is currently dividing his time
between completing a dissertation on
socialism and development in Africa
and maintaining a busy schedule of
speaking engagements.
" All of my studies here have been
geared toward understanding devel
opment in the Third World," Simesso
said.
"The true leader is an educator,"
he said, explaining his interest in
communication. "By studying com
munication I want to try to communi
cate in as many ways as possible this
process (of development). In the long
run, 1 would like to work in a multi
media setting and try to communicate
with the peasant. For many of the un
derdeveloped countries, where the
average is not the city dweller, I think
that's the answer."
Simesso described his dissertation
as "an evaluation of socialism in
Africa vis-a-vis the theory. Eth
iopia, he said, "is a microcosm of the
developing world. It's gone from the
extreme right to the extreme left — a
prototype of the long and gruesome
process of development with a lot of
fire in the process."
Upon arriving at Stanford in 1978,
Simesso coordinated the Stanford-
Berkeley Joint Center for African

Studies. He also helped found the
Stanford East African Relief Organi
zation to "encourage deeper aware
ness and appreciation" of the famine
crisis, to "encourage people to help
through whatever agency they can"
and to do fund raising, he said.
Because of increased public aware
ness of the famine crisis, Simesso
recently has been in great demand as
a speaker. He has appeared at confer
ences, churches and schools, and on
several radio and television talk
shows, including "People are
Talking."
"I speak mostly about the famine,
Third World issues and the relief ef
fort," he said. "It's been very
heartwarming. The human response
has been very educational, very
moving.
"My latest passion is this concern
for the emergency situation we have
— not only in Ethiopia but in Africa
in general," he said. "In a very
profound way, we are affected by the
suffering. All we have would be lost
unless we continue saving human
life."
Simesso has spent much of his life
involved in political activism and
public speaking.
Born in Dembi-Dollo in western
Ethiopia and raised in the capital city
of Addis Ababa, he was student
chairman of what he called "the most
radical high school in the country" by
the age of 13. He said that at one
point he was arrested during a street
demonstration while protesting
"issues of social justice." However,
when 1,500 fellow students would not
allow the car with Simesso to pass, he
was released.
At 15, he came to the United

States for the first time on an Ameri
can Field Service exchange. "I
wanted to go somewhere very differ
ent from Ethiopia — so they sent me
to Maine," he said. Although he had
already graduated from high school in
Ethiopia, he spent a year in New En
gland before returning to Ethiopia to
attend Haile Selassie First University
and work as a radio journalist.
Simesso withdrew from that uni
versity after two years because of the

student unrest that plagued Ethiopia
in the years preceeding the 1974
socialist revolution. He returned to
the United States to attend Colby
College in Maine, a school he had
seen during his first visit, but
remained there only one year before
being called back to his homeland
during the revolution.
Simesso's father, a former con
gressman in the deposed Haile
Selassie government, was im

prisonned during the revolution, and
Simesso worked once again as a radio
journalist to support 13 members of
his family.
A year later, he was awarded a
scholarship that covered his family
expenses and allowed him to do a
summer-long speaking tour of
Sweden as the chairman of an Ethi
opian youth organization. Looking
back, Simesso said, "1 have been ex
tremely fortunate. I do not know how
1 would have made it if people had
not helped me."
Following this tour, Simesso
returned once again to Maine to com
plete his undergraduate education at
Colby.
Returning to Ethiopia, he worked
for six weeks as the English news
editor for the Radio Voice of Et
hiopia before quitting in protest of
human rights violations by the leftist
government.
At that point, Simesso left for the
United States, where he has since
remained. Following a year of study
at the University of Minnesota, he
came to Stanford in 1978 and began
working toward a masters degree in
political science.
Simesso is not only a political ac
tivist but also a musician and actor.
"Speaking, acting, community in
volvement are all part and parcel of
my living routine," he said.
By age 11, he had been on a two
year tour of his homeland as the
leader of a choir group, played the
lead in Ethiopia's first-ever opera,
and was on his way to performing in
the national theatre.
At Stanford, he has most recently
appeared in the fall production of
Moliere's "Tartuffe." Said Simesso:
"I may audition for a show for spring

quarter if 1 get time. Acting is my pas>
sion — it's like a therapy. I love to
sneak into a show."
In addition to his acting at Stanford
and the performing he did in hi«
youth, Simesso has acted at Colby
and in a Bay Area summer stock
company.
Simesso is also a member of a loctfl
band of Ethiopian musicians. Al
though he plays the harmonica,
guitar, piano and recorder, he said h£
is primarily involved in the
"promotional aspects" of the group
and in "interpreting the music anti
trying to locate it within the history of
music, whenever 1 feel enthused.V
The band most recently played at the
First Baptist Church in Palo Alto anil
performs at "Ethiopian occasions." «
Simesso plans to complete his work
at Stanford in a "very short time if
uninterrupted by the political at
mosphere at home" and reflects
warmly on his years here.
"I've been so impressed as )i
foreign student with the people I've
met — a very wide spectrum," hie
said. "From that I've developed an
openness which I cherish very much.
To be a good student is to be opejn
and unprejudiced. The ideal is to
develop an openness to all that'.s
around one's self.
"Above all, I guess I've come to
the classical conception of knowledge
as trying to inculcate in one's self;a
sense of virtue and a sense of learning
through all avenues — not only de
veloping one's reason from education
but learning from the exemplariness
of teachers," he said.
"The growth here has been very
nice for me and 1 should say how
much I've really appreciated this in
stitution."


"Speaking, acting, community involvement are all part and parcel of
my living routine," says Awetu Simesso, a doctoral candidate in politi
cal science here.
