The University is on the road to a more re
sponsible investment policy with Tuesday's deci
sion by the Board of Trustees to sell Stanford's
shares in Motorola, Inc., if the Illinois-based
electronic firm resumes sales to the South
African military or police. However, there are
still many miles to go.
Conditional divestiture, though unused since
the University approved an official investment
responsibility policy in 1977, isn't an end in itself.
It doesn't satisfy the demand made by students in
the ASSU referendum last fall.
Lest we forget, 81 percent of the voters in that
election called on the University to completely
divest of its shares in Motorola and "to establish
criteria for selective divestment" in other com
panies. To date, neither demand has been met.
For the referendum to be effective, students must
remain vigilant in the face of measures that are
important yet fall short of the real objective.
A responsible investment policy calls for noth
ing less than total and immediate divestiture. For
years, Motorola's electronics products have helped

the South African military and police physically
enforce apartheid. The corporation's employ
ment practices have consistently failed to comply
with the Sullivan Principles, a code of ethical con
duct for multi-national corporations.
There's no guarantee that Motorola is bent on
changing its corporate practices in South Africa.
Tn December, a Motorola spokesman told the
Stanford Committee on Investment Responsibil
ity, a 12-member student, staff and faculty group
that reports directly to the trustees, that his com
pany did not sell any equipment to the South
African military or police last year — but left
open the possibility that sales to the police may
be resumed at any time.
Motorola's unwillingness to commit itself to a
policy that respects the fundamental rights of all
the peoples of South African compels Stanford to
divest— and divest now. Stanford still holds $4.7
million worth of Motorola stock. Stanford still
condones a social system that is antithetical to the
social and intellectual freedom on which the Uni
versity is based.
