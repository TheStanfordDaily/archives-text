# Things to not talk about
## 
### 
First of all, let's not talk about the
title of this piece. I split an infinitive
— it's OK, I'm a linguistics major,
I'm entitled. If I were an English
major, you could maybe carp, but I'm
not. So I don't want to hear about it.
All right? Maybe later we'll talk
about some other titles — if we can
catch an English major splitting an in
finitive, we'll all sit around and
ridicule him and have a good time.
Until then, stay calm. I have a few
more ground rules to lay down first.
We're not going to discuss my use
of the pronoun "him" to designate a
person who may or may not be male.
The person may or may not even ex
ist, so it hardly matters right now
what pronoun I use. If you're a per
son that gets really worked up about
such things, at least wait until you
find out who I'm talking about. Then
you can complain. I won't listen, of
course, because I already told you,
we're not going to talk about it. In
fact, if you're the sort of person who
would complain, you probably got
upset when I said "a person that..."
instead of "a person who. ..."
Maybe you got so upset that you
stopped right there, and this column
is now in a trash bin. Well, good rid
dance to you.
When we talk — if we talk — there
are certain words we are not going to
use. I'm not going to use them, and
since you're not the one writing this,
you're not going to use them either.
These are words that I find personally
offensive, words that I have seen too
many unscrupulous writers using. I
think you know the words 1 mean:
words like "thus," "therefore,"
"hence," "accordingly." Words they
teach you in freshman composition
classes so that, if you can't write
decently, at least you can limp to the
end of an essay. I am not going to use
them, and neither are you. Partly this
is from spite, because I hated fresh
man English; partly it is because the
words just sound stupid; mostly it is
because I just don't like them. I hate
the idea of writing formal essays,
proceeding logically from arguments
to conclusions, using words like that.
It's ugly. Logical progression is for

math majors. Besides, I usually have
no arguments and no conclusions to
proceed to.
Another thing that will not come
up is any relevant topic. There will be
no discussion of major social issues,
or minor social issues, or anything
that has significance. Things that are
significant are also boring, as a rule.
There will be no trenchant discus
sions of politics or economics, be
cause politics and economics bore
me. I will not analyze current events
because not only do most of them

bore me, I don't know what most of
them are. I'm just a linguistics major.
I'll leave the serious analysis to
people who are qualified to do it; po
litical science majors, economics stu
dents, undeclared freshmen. You
don't want to hear what I have to say,
and I don't have anything to say
anyway. So forget about it right now,
because I'm going to.
Along with relevant topics, we're
not going to talk about controversial
topics. It seems that everyone who
isn't writing about relevant topics is
trying to be controversial. The idea, I
suppose, is that if you are controver
sial enough then people will start to
talk, information will be dis
seminated, ideas freely exchanged,
consciousness raised and so on.
Wrong. Here is what happens when
you try to be controversial: The
people you want to reach ignore you,
because controversy is boring: the
people who agree with you will feel
smug for a while; the people who dis
agree with you will, briefly, think
you're an idiot. Then they'll forget

about you, because idiots are boring.
People will talk, maybe, but only to
people who already agree with them.
What's the point?
People who set out to be contro
versial usually are annoying. Usually
they're intentionally annoying,
believing that annoying people is a
good thing. And sometimes it is —
but not when they do it. When they
do it, it's just annoying. That kind of
controversy is easy, and we're not
going to do it. If you want it, you can
make your own. Write a column
defending rape as a social institution,
or blaming all men personally for the
existence of rape. Take out an ad
vertisement supporting apartheid in
the newspaper. Stand on a box at
noon in White Plaza and malign Mar
tin Luther King. Write a letter to the
editor saying that William Shockley
makes some good points. Wear a
swastika armband to a dorm meeting.
Just don't expect me to pay you much
attention. As far as I'm concerned,
you'll be an idiot.
So we're not going to talk about
any of that stuff. If I want to annoy
you, I'll come right out and do it. No
playing around, trying to make you
believe that I'm annoying you for
your own good. Because I won't be. If
I annoy you, I'll be doing it for my
own good, because I happen to enjoy
annoying you. If you're annoyed, you
can just stop reading, because I car
tell you right now that you won't miss
out on anything but annoyance.
We're not going to talk about any
thing important, we're not going to
mention any vital facts and only very
rarely will we mention useful infor
mation of any kind. Probably you've
spent most of your life in school,
trying to absorb useful information —
do you really want more of it from
me? I hope not, because you're not
going to get it.
What you will get is... .
Well, I've run out of space. But
don't worry, I'll be back in two
weeks. We'll talk.
