## The 						'democracy pedestal' 
### 
Early last Monday morning, a controversial and, in this
writer's view, a very crude, life-size sculpture by an un
known student artist appeared on a pedestal outside of
Meyer Library.
Perhaps The Daily will eventually unveil the struggling
young artist who created the piece, the handsome subject

of the statue and the significance of what struck passers
by as a provocative work that some believed the Univer
sity had commissioned for a substantial sum.
But until The Daily begins its investigations and
presents comments on the campus reaction, two observa
tions about the episode come to mind.
The first is that it showed a very positive and sometimes
hidden side of the University â€” the great potential for
student creativity and ingenuity. There is a great deal of
unused and unrealized potential here, waiting to be ex
pressed if the University will only provide the means of
honoring and displaying it. In this particular case, the Uni
versity should be commended for having left an unproved
student work untouched for several days so that all could
see it.
Rather than erect yet another base for the purchased
work of a major artist, which will continue to turn Stan
ford into a park where students are merely spectators, the
University has seen that it can inject itself with a new
sense of vitality by turning areas like the pedestal outside
of Meyer into forums for open display of student work.
I propose that we offer the pedestal outside of Meyer
on a free and open basis (Stanford's "democracy pedes
tal") to any student who signs up to display his artistic tal
ent or to make a personal statement. The outdoor display
of 40 or so pieces of student work for one week at a time
in the course of a year will have a healthy effect on this
community.
At the same time, many will argue that this cannot be

done, that no student artwork would survive without con
stant protection, for the unfortunate reason that while
there is much hidden creativity, there is also a dark under
current of student destructiveness; part of the ethic of
anti-intellectualism and opposition to new ideas which
pervades this university.
The pedestal is empty this week, not because the Uni
versity ordered the statue down, but because some stu
dents out on a reckless spree destroyed their fellow
student's work. This perverse form of censorship that is a
regrettable characteristic of Stanford life at all levels,
though generally in much subtler forms, is only beginning

The University should
encourage intellectual
activity and freedom by
keeping the pedestal open
for any student who signs up
to use it.

to be examined by this newspaper and by the University
community.
It is curious that a poorly conceived statue, probably
created as a prank, should unintentionally be the medium
to suggest this in a university where even the student
newspaper is afraid to commit itself to any serious discus
sion of Stanford's culture and its systematic destruction of
ideas. There, alongside the fragments of a broken student
statue, is where the real debate on the future of this uni
versity lies.
