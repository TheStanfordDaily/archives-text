Brother Jim ...
There's something very disturbing
about a crowd of 300 Stanford stu
dents hanging around "Brother Jim"
in White Plaza for hours at a time,
especially during midterms. 1 haven't
seen this big of a crowd in ages —
not for the divestment rally, not to
hear election campaign talks last fall,
not to learn about the East African
famine. And everyone knows the
excuses for apathy: "I'm too busy,"
"I have a program due tomorrow,"
"I have three midterms this week."
Why do so many people have so
much time so suddenly?
If everyone who's been standing
around waiting for Brother Jim to
make another gaffe for the past
couple of days is there because he or
she is interested in Christianity or
God or eternal life. I have nothing to
say. But what makes me sick is that
this superior, smug bunch of brats
should stand around to make fun of
one man, however off-base anyone
thinks his views are.
Jeering, vicious laughter and
hurled obscenities and insults don't
speak too highly for students in one
of the best, most exclusive univer
sities in the United States. And it
seems pretty clear to me that most of
the people "listening" to him are
only interested in poking fun at
Brother Jim and showing off to their
friends.
I don't think Brother Jim's sexism
or homophobia calls for someone to

attack him with kisses that are obvi
ously very offensive to him. In an
other situation, we'd be tempted to
call that sort of behavior "rape."
I guess I expected more civilized
behavior of Stanford students; not
because I thought intelligence had
anything to do with being a better
person, but because I expected
people with an education to be a
little more reflective than to deny
their "civilization," their ideals about
tolerance, relativism or whatever, so
blatantly. If Brother Jim offends you,
don't give him an audience. That, at
least, is a civilized way to show him
how you feel.

The recent visit of Brother Jim to
White Plaza has brought a new
source of conversation, amusement
and, I'm afraid, confusion to our
campus. While many students, in
cluding myself, have not given him
too much time, it is probably true
that almost everyone is familiar with
what he is "preaching" (e.g., hell,
fire, homosexuals and prostitutes).
Many Christians on campus are
concerned, though, that some may
confuse this with true Christianity,
which it is not.
Christianity, Christ in one, is cen
tered on the person and teachings of
Jesus as found in the Bible. One
becomes a Christian by acknowledg

ing Jesus' death as God's provision
for his sin and Jesus' resurrection as
proof of his claim to be God
(Romans 10:9, 10). The Bible
describes this provision as a gift
(grace) which is offered to all people
in love and without condition (Rom.
5:8, Eph. 2:8,9). When one claims
this gift by faith, trusting that it is
true, Christ enters his life through
the Holy Spirit, forgives his sin and
makes him "spiritually alive" (John
5:24).
That's it. The person is still
human, he still fails and misses God's
best for his life (Romans 7). His
hope and joy, though, are no longer
in himself but in Jesus living through
him. He receives power as he looks
to God for guidance in living a life
which honors the Lord.
Is this what Jim believes? I'm not
sure — is anyone? Is this what he
communicates? Definitely not! The
manner in which he preaches draws
attention to himself, not Jesus or the
true "Word of God." Make no
mistake. Brother Jim is a master at
his art. He knows exactly what to say
and when to say it in such a way as
to draw the "best" crowd response.
But is there love in what he says? Is
God's spirit working through him to
cause listeners to consider Jesus or
the Bible? Or is he simply creating
confusion, contempt and even a
mockery of the message of Jesus?
Be careful to make distinctions.
But consider also that only originals
of value are ever counterfeited.

(Ever know of anyone who copied
pennies for a living?) Don't be
turned off to Jesus because of
"preachers." Read and investigate
the claims of Christ for yourself.
Then let Jesus himself turn you off
— or draw you to him (Matthew 11:
28-30).

How is it that Stanford's students,
faculty and staff can park their
bicycles in a chaotic fashion without
any concern for people who are
handicapped? This recurrent behav
ior is inexcusable and a poor reflec
tion on our community. As we
debate issues of human rights, let us
also keep in mind the rights of hand
icapped people here at Stanford.
Imagine, if you would, trying to
function at this campus without
eyesight. It would be difficult, to say
the least. If your bicycle is going to
obstruct someone's path, causing
them undue hardship or possible
injury, don't park it there! What
right do you have to deny someone
else access to a building? Or, is your
bicycle more important than his
degree? Those of us who have
healthy enough bodies to ride a
bicycle are capable of walking an
other five or 10 feet on our way to
Tresidder, class or the library.

5:8, Eph. 2:8,9). When one claims
this gift by faith, trusting that it is
true, Christ enters his life through
the Holy Spirit, forgives his sin and
makes him "spiritually alive" (John
5:24).
That's it. The person is still
human, he still fails and misses God's
best for his life (Romans 7). His
hope and joy, though, are no longer
in himself but in Jesus living through
him. He receives power as he looks
to God for guidance in living a life
which honors the Lord.
Is this what Jim believes? I'm not
sure — is anyone? Is this what he
communicates? Definitely not! The
manner in which he preaches draws
attention to himself, not Jesus or the
true "Word of God." Make no
mistake. Brother Jim is a master at
his art. He knows exactly what to say
and when to say it in such a way as
to draw the "best" crowd response.
But is there love in what he says? Is
God's spirit working through him to
cause listeners to consider Jesus or
the Bible? Or is he simply creating
confusion, contempt and even a
mockery of the message of Jesus?
Be careful to make distinctions.
But consider also that only originals
of value are ever counterfeited.

(Ever know of anyone who copied
pennies for a living?) Don't be
turned off to Jesus because of
"preachers." Read and investigate
the claims of Christ for yourself.
Then let Jesus himself turn you off
— or draw you to him (Matthew 11:
28-30).

How is it that Stanford's students,
faculty and staff can park their
bicycles in a chaotic fashion without
any concern for people who are
handicapped? This recurrent behav
ior is inexcusable and a poor reflec
tion on our community. As we
debate issues of human rights, let us
also keep in mind the rights of hand
icapped people here at Stanford.
Imagine, if you would, trying to
function at this campus without
eyesight. It would be difficult, to say
the least. If your bicycle is going to
obstruct someone's path, causing
them undue hardship or possible
injury, don't park it there! What
right do you have to deny someone
else access to a building? Or, is your
bicycle more important than his
degree? Those of us who have
healthy enough bodies to ride a
bicycle are capable of walking an
other five or 10 feet on our way to
Tresidder, class or the library.

Brother Jim ...
There's something very disturbing
about a crowd of 300 Stanford stu
dents hanging around "Brother Jim"
in White Plaza for hours at a time,
especially during midterms. 1 haven't
seen this big of a crowd in ages —
not for the divestment rally, not to
hear election campaign talks last fall,
not to learn about the East African
famine. And everyone knows the
excuses for apathy: "I'm too busy,"
"I have a program due tomorrow,"
"I have three midterms this week."
Why do so many people have so
much time so suddenly?
If everyone who's been standing
around waiting for Brother Jim to
make another gaffe for the past
couple of days is there because he or
she is interested in Christianity or
God or eternal life. I have nothing to
say. But what makes me sick is that
this superior, smug bunch of brats
should stand around to make fun of
one man, however off-base anyone
thinks his views are.
Jeering, vicious laughter and
hurled obscenities and insults don't
speak too highly for students in one
of the best, most exclusive univer
sities in the United States. And it
seems pretty clear to me that most of
the people "listening" to him are
only interested in poking fun at
Brother Jim and showing off to their
friends.
I don't think Brother Jim's sexism
or homophobia calls for someone to

attack him with kisses that are obvi
ously very offensive to him. In an
other situation, we'd be tempted to
call that sort of behavior "rape."
I guess I expected more civilized
behavior of Stanford students; not
because I thought intelligence had
anything to do with being a better
person, but because I expected
people with an education to be a
little more reflective than to deny
their "civilization," their ideals about
tolerance, relativism or whatever, so
blatantly. If Brother Jim offends you,
don't give him an audience. That, at
least, is a civilized way to show him
how you feel.

The recent visit of Brother Jim to
White Plaza has brought a new
source of conversation, amusement
and, I'm afraid, confusion to our
campus. While many students, in
cluding myself, have not given him
too much time, it is probably true
that almost everyone is familiar with
what he is "preaching" (e.g., hell,
fire, homosexuals and prostitutes).
Many Christians on campus are
concerned, though, that some may
confuse this with true Christianity,
which it is not.
Christianity, Christ in one, is cen
tered on the person and teachings of
Jesus as found in the Bible. One
becomes a Christian by acknowledg

ing Jesus' death as God's provision
for his sin and Jesus' resurrection as
proof of his claim to be God
(Romans 10:9, 10). The Bible
describes this provision as a gift
(grace) which is offered to all people
in love and without condition (Rom.
5:8, Eph. 2:8,9). When one claims
this gift by faith, trusting that it is
true, Christ enters his life through
the Holy Spirit, forgives his sin and
makes him "spiritually alive" (John
5:24).
