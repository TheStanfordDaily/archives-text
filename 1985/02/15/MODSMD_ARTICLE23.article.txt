## Netters beat No. 8 LSU to stay unbeaten 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
Whether it was the sun or the good
opponent that brought spectators to
Stanford's match with the Louisiana
State men's tennis team yesterday, no
one left without seeing some excel
lent tennis, as the Cardinal beat the
eighth-ranked team in the country, 5-
4.
Even Coach Dick Gould's 15-
month-old daughter turned up to
watch what proved to be the
"toughest" preseason home match
for the Cardinal.
I.SU is home to players such as the
Intercollegiate Tennis Coaches Asso
ciation's No. 9-ranked Fernando
Fere/ — a silver medalist in the 1982
Pan American Games and a member
of the 1984 Mexican Davis Cup
Team.
Stanford can spew out a sermon of
impressive facts too — concerning in
particular its top singles and doubles
players: Dan Goldie, John Letts and
Jim Grabb.
Goldie, the nation's top collegiate
player, defeated Perez 6-3, 7-6. LSU
coach Jerry Simmon watched the
entire match from the sidelines. He
found out first hand just how aggres
sive Goldie can be.
Goldie is definitely not one to miss
a chance to reach the net. He has the
ground strokes to get him there, too.
He got in the most trouble against
Perez in the second set. Shoulder
high volleys started going wide and
deep. Down 3-4, Goldie muttered, "I
have never played in a more frustrat
ing match .. . never, never."
Goldie seemed to let his frustration
out in service aces, however, and he
proceeded to break Perez serve, and
eventually win the set by a 7-4 margin
in the tiebreaker.
Grabb and Letts played with equal
intimidation in No. 1 doubles compe
tition, defeating Perez and Jeff
Brown 6-4, 7-6.
The Cardinal duo could not bal
ance each other out any better. At 6-
foot-3 and 165 pounds, Grabb makes

a tall, lean team captain. In compari
son, Letts could be considered stocky.
But between Grabb's towering serve,
and Letts' over-the-fence, home
run volley smashes, they make a
tough pair to beat.
In No. 2 doubles, Eric Rosenfeld
and Patrick McEnroe were defeated
by Steve Wood and Jason Noonan, 2-
6, 7-5, 6-1. Derrick Rostagno did not
play with McEnroe as usual because
of illness.
Rosenfeld appeared to let out some
energy in his doubles match in his No.
4 singles win over Carlos Homedes.
"I was impatient in the first set
(against Homedes)," Rosenfeld said.
"I haven't played many baseliners.
I've been playing serve and volley
every match. .. . when it was four-all
in the third set, I just bore down and
had to be patient."
Stanford lost the No. 3 and No. 6
singles matches. Grabb defeated
Steve Wood 6-3, 6-2 and Letts
defeated Jeff Brown 6-3, 6-3 in the
No. 2 and No. 5 singles.
The Cardinal has another home
match today against unranked Santa
Clara. Gould will more that likely put
his second six singles players in the
lineup for experience.
Freshman Tony Del Rosario, 2-1,
will play No. 1 singles and doubles for
Santa Clara. At one time his interna
tional ranking was No. 17. He has
compiled a 0-3 doubles record so far
with partner Steve Otten.
"Their record doesn't reflect how
well they have been playing," Santa
Clara Coach John Barrett said. "It's
been the tough opponents."
Stanford's doubles teams should be
no exception. "We just hope to stay
alive. We're a very young team,"
Barrett said, noting Santa Clara has
freshmen in the No. 1, No. 4 and No.
6 singles spots. "Stanford is the cream
of the crop, obviously. We're ap
proaching the match very philosophi
cally. We have to give it our best shot
all the way through and see what hap
pens."

edge the Tigers 5-4. LSU, the No. 8 team in the nation, likely represents
the Cardinal's toughest non-conference opposition.
Whether it was the sun or the good
opponent that brought spectators to
Stanford's match with the Louisiana
State men's tennis team yesterday, no
one left without seeing some excel
lent tennis, as the Cardinal beat the
eighth-ranked team in the country, 5-
4.
Even Coach Dick Gould's 15-
month-old daughter turned up to
watch what proved to be the
"toughest" preseason home match
for the Cardinal.
I.SU is home to players such as the
Intercollegiate Tennis Coaches Asso
ciation's No. 9-ranked Fernando
Fere/ — a silver medalist in the 1982
Pan American Games and a member
of the 1984 Mexican Davis Cup
Team.
Stanford can spew out a sermon of
impressive facts too — concerning in
particular its top singles and doubles
players: Dan Goldie, John Letts and
Jim Grabb.
Goldie, the nation's top collegiate
player, defeated Perez 6-3, 7-6. LSU
coach Jerry Simmon watched the
entire match from the sidelines. He
found out first hand just how aggres
sive Goldie can be.
Goldie is definitely not one to miss
a chance to reach the net. He has the
ground strokes to get him there, too.
He got in the most trouble against
Perez in the second set. Shoulder
high volleys started going wide and
deep. Down 3-4, Goldie muttered, "I
have never played in a more frustrat
ing match .. . never, never."
Goldie seemed to let his frustration
out in service aces, however, and he
proceeded to break Perez serve, and
eventually win the set by a 7-4 margin
in the tiebreaker.
Grabb and Letts played with equal
intimidation in No. 1 doubles compe
tition, defeating Perez and Jeff
Brown 6-4, 7-6.
The Cardinal duo could not bal
ance each other out any better. At 6-
foot-3 and 165 pounds, Grabb makes

a tall, lean team captain. In compari
son, Letts could be considered stocky.
But between Grabb's towering serve,
and Letts' over-the-fence, home
run volley smashes, they make a
tough pair to beat.
In No. 2 doubles, Eric Rosenfeld
and Patrick McEnroe were defeated
by Steve Wood and Jason Noonan, 2-
6, 7-5, 6-1. Derrick Rostagno did not
play with McEnroe as usual because
of illness.
Rosenfeld appeared to let out some
energy in his doubles match in his No.
4 singles win over Carlos Homedes.
"I was impatient in the first set
(against Homedes)," Rosenfeld said.
"I haven't played many baseliners.
I've been playing serve and volley
every match. .. . when it was four-all
in the third set, I just bore down and
had to be patient."
Stanford lost the No. 3 and No. 6
singles matches. Grabb defeated
Steve Wood 6-3, 6-2 and Letts
defeated Jeff Brown 6-3, 6-3 in the
No. 2 and No. 5 singles.
The Cardinal has another home
match today against unranked Santa
Clara. Gould will more that likely put
his second six singles players in the
lineup for experience.
Freshman Tony Del Rosario, 2-1,
will play No. 1 singles and doubles for
Santa Clara. At one time his interna
tional ranking was No. 17. He has
compiled a 0-3 doubles record so far
with partner Steve Otten.
"Their record doesn't reflect how
well they have been playing," Santa
Clara Coach John Barrett said. "It's
been the tough opponents."
Stanford's doubles teams should be
no exception. "We just hope to stay
alive. We're a very young team,"
Barrett said, noting Santa Clara has
freshmen in the No. 1, No. 4 and No.
6 singles spots. "Stanford is the cream
of the crop, obviously. We're ap
proaching the match very philosophi
cally. We have to give it our best shot
all the way through and see what hap
pens."


Jim Grabb and John Letts combined to defeat Louisiana State's Fer
nando Perez and Jeff Brown 6-4, 7-6 at No. 1 doubles to help Stanford
