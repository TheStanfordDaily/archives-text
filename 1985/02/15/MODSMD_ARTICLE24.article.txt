SAN JOSE — The Stanford

meet season on the road on a win
ning note, demolishing San Jose
State 33-15 for its first victory
over the Spartans in 10 years. The
win gave the Cardinal a 8-6-1 final
record.
"I thought we did a good job.
We had some guys who were com
ing off injuries and were a little bit
sick," Stanford Coach Chris Hor
pel said. "The team will get four
days off to recuperate for the Pac
-10 Championships."
The star of the evening for the
Cardinal was Kurt Kassulke at 190
pounds. Kassulke scored a techni
cal pin with only four seconds
remaining in the match, 15-0, over
Jesse Figueroa. In the first period,
Kassulke opened a 7-0 lead and
began the second period with a
reversal. In the final period Kas
sulke came close to scoring with
20 seconds left and out of this hold
got a three-point near-fall for the
technical pin.
In the first match, the Spartan's
Arnold Khanbabian (118 pounds)
registered a technical pin against
B.G. Porter 4:22 into the match, 1-
17. Neil Wartnik of Stanford won
his match by forfeit. Heavyweight
Terry Mclntyre also won by for
feit.
Jeff Bradley (134 pounds), who
is coming off a neck injury suf

fered last weekend, won his match
over San Jose's Joe Zamlich 8-3.
Scott Wiggen widened the team
score for the Cardinal with a 16-2
thrashing of Ken Brison. In the
final period, Wiggen was able to
score nine unanswered points and
came very close to getting another
near fall at the buzzer and a tech
nical pin.
In an off match, Stanford's Jeff
Hazard (142 pounds) lost to Shan
non Felix 7-15. Hazard said that
he butted heads with Felix in the
first period and felt dizzy through
out the match.
At 158 pounds, Stanford's Pete
Rogers and Spartan Kraig Walker
continued their on-going battle
with a 4-4 draw. At the end of two
periods Walker held a 4-3 lead,
but Rogers was able to score an
escape 10 seconds into the final
period.
Horpel felt that Rogers faded at
the end of the match and still
could be suffering from a case of
burn out. Rogers is 2-2-1 against
Walker this season.
Freshman sensation Dave Lee
(167 pounds) looked sharp as al
ways in a 13-0 win against Matt
Toves. Last weekend in the Biola
Invitational, Lee beat Toves, 8-1.
Stanford's Tom Mullen (177
