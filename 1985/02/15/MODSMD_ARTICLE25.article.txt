The Stanford women's softball
team played a doubleheader against
San Francisco State yesterday and
made a little history doing it.
Not only were they the first and
second home games for the softball
team in its first year as a varsity sport,
they were the first and second vic
tories as well.
Stanford won the first game, 7-3,
and then prevailed in the nightcap,
13-3, on the so-called 10-run rule,
which puts a team out of its misery if
it's down by 10 or more runs after five
innings.
Pitcher Lisa Buchanan went the
distance in the first game, giving up
three runs and only six hits. Sopho
more Betsy Watson had identical
numbers in the second game and also
was credited with her first victory of
the season.
Stanford had little problem scoring
in both games, thanks to some timely
hitting. Freshman infielder Terri Sil
liman led the way in the opener,
going 2-for-2 at the plate.
In the second game, the Cardinal
ripped San Francisco State pitching
for 13 runs in five innings behind
Kathy Dominguez (2-for-3, 2 RBIs),
Cathy Taft (3 RBIs), K.K. Bush (2
RBIs) and sophomore catcher Mar
garet Pezzini (2 RBIs).
