# Vengeful Card hosts Bears, Bruins

### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
With the Cardinal's biggest home
stand ot the season — a three-games
in-six-days affair — approaching,
Stanford Basketball Coach Tom
Davis worked his players hard in
Tuesday's practice.
I hen he gave them Wednesday off.
"I thought their problem was not
one of practicing hard," Davis said.
"They have practiced very hard. But 1
thought maybe the day off was the

best thing from a mental standpoint."
Stanford probably could use the
rest, too, with its three biggest home
games of the season packed into a six
day period. The Cardinal plays rival
California tomorrow at 3 p.m.,
UCLA Monday night at 7:30 and
USC Thursday at 7:30 p.m.
Stanford also could use a victory. A
pair of losses in Arizona last weekend
left the Cardinal with an overall
record, 10-11, under .500 for the first

time this season, a Pacific 10 Confer
ence record of 2-9 and a four-game
losing streak.
"Losing's never fun," Davis said.
"Being on a team is fun. But when
you lose a game or a couple of games
or four games in a row, that's not tun.
The players, they're unhappy-
They're not pleased with their record.
They really want to win a game."
Stanford's first — and probably
best — chance to halt the losing
streak comes tomorrow afternoon
against Cal, 11-10 overall and in
the Pac-10. The basketball office is
taking this one seriously, encouraging
fans to wear red and passing out
1,000 red-and-white shakers (mini
pom-pons) at the game.
Rivalry aside, Stanford has plenty
of incentive to win, if for no other
reason than the 87-72 thumping the
Bears' handed the Cardinal last
month at Cal. The 15-point loss fol
lowed the Cardinal's first Pac-10 win,
over Arizona, and kept Stanford from
climbing out of the Pac-10 cellar it
presently occupies.
Ahead 10-9, Cal Coach Dick Ku
chen decided to hold the ball and bring
Stanford out of its packed-in zone
defense. While the Cardinal zone
wouldn't budge, Kuchen's strategy
worked. The Bears moved out to a
37-25 halftime lead and then cruised
in the second half.
When asked about the slowdown
tactics at his weekly press conference
Monday, Davis shook his head and
said, "Yes, it did disrupt us."
Although Cal played well in that
game — its first Pac-10 victory — it's
playing even better now. The Bears
took UCLA and USC to the wire the
next weekend and then beat not one,
but both Oregon schools two weeks
ago.
Against Arizona State last week,
it watched a late-game lead dis
solve and eventually turn into a 61-60
loss when a 10-foot shot at the buzzer
fell short. Two days later against
Arizona, they "ran into a very hot
ballclub," according to Kuchen, and
lost, 66-48.
To beat Cal, Stanford will have to
do something it hasn't done in recent

games — work the ball inside. Card
inal centers Kent Seymour and Eric
Reveno combined to take six shots
against Arziona and eight against
Arizona State, not nearly enough to
keep opposing teams' defenses from
clogging up the middle and forcing
Stanford — not a particularly good
shooting team — to fire away from
the outside.
Stanford will also have to stop Cal
sophomore guard Kevin Johnson,
who sprung for a career-high 23
points and 14 rebounds in the teams'
last meeting. "We've got to play bet
ter defense on him," Davis said.
"That certainly is a problem because
I don't know if we have someone
quick enough to guard him."
The biggest key, however, will be
not falling behind early. "That's even
more important against a ball-control
team like Cal," Davis said. "Since it's
going to be a low-scoring game, any
lead is more significant."
The Cardinal will have a day to rest
after the Cal game before UCLA, al
ways a big attraction in the Bay Area,
visits Maples Pavilion Monday night.
UCLA, 9-11 overall and 6-5 in the
Pac-10, is out for revenge after what
happened at this time last year in
Maples Pavilion, something Bruins
want to — and Cardinal fans never
will — forget.
That was when Stanford defeated
UCLA, 75-64, in what many consider
the biggest victory in Cardinal bas
ketball history since Stanford beat
Dartmouth, 53-38, in 1942 to win the
NCAA title. Red-clad Stanford fans
flooded the floor in sold-out Maples
Pavilion after the victory, which
raised the Cardinal's record to 18-8
and almost assured it the post-season
tournament berth that never came.
UCLA made up in part for that by
routing Stanford, 100-71, in Los An
geles last month. It was the worst loss
in Davis' three years at Stanford.
While Stanford can finish no higher
than 9-9 in the Pac-10, it can play
spoiler in its remaining games. To do
so, guard Keith Ramee said the Card
inal will have to relax a little.
"We were all kind of tight last
weekend, we wanted to win so bad,"

Ramee said. "Sometimes you can
want it so bad that you can come out
and try to do too much. We still want
to come out and play aggressive, but
we don't want to overdo it."
Card notes
Cal has won six of the last seven
basketball Big Games, including the
last the last three straight at Maples
Pavilion. Cal's last Pac-10 road vic
tory was a 66-64 win at Stanford
last year. Since then the Bears have
lost 14 straight onference games on
the road.
Ramee played on the same high

school team as two Bears — freshman
forward Leonard Taylor and sopho
more guard Chris Washington. Also,
Cardinal freshman Greg Butler is the
younger brother of Dave Butler, the
Bears All-Pac-10 forward who has
been sidelined for most of the season
with a stress fracture in each leg.
Both teams are among the league
leaders in free-throw shooting. Stan
ford is first in all games with a 73 per
cent figure while Cal is second in con
ference games at 74 percent. Individ
ually, Stanford's Novian Whitsitt is
leading the Pac-10, shooting 89 per
cent from the line in conference
games and 86 percent in all games.

Guard John Paye had 13 points last month in Berkeley against Califor
nia in the 87-72 loss that dropped the Cardinal into the Pac-10 cellar.

Forward Earl Koberlein was suffering from a chronic back problem
when Stanford played in Berkeley last month, and he only scored six
points before fouling out.
