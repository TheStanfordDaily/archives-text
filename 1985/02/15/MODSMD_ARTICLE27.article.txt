# Lundblade 'comes through'
## 
### JENNIFER KOCH 
The game is tied 2-2. With no
outs in the bottom of the 11th in
ning, the pressure is on Stanford to
score. A Cardinal batter steps up
and hits the ball into right
center field, past the outstretched
glove of the Santa Clara outfielder,
allowing Stanford's Ruben Amaro
to score from second base.
The final score: Stanford 3, Santa
Clara 2.
After the last of the fans have
cleared the stands, Rick Lundblade
— No. 15 — turns to a teammate,
and with a shy smile confesses, "I
just wanted to get it over with."
This is the same Rick Lundblade
who hit the game-winning home
run for the Cardinal against
Hayward State a week ago. The
same Rick Lundblade who hit two
home runs for Stanford against
Santa Clara Sunday.
Claiming his only objective at the
plate is to "hit the ball hard,"
Lundblade leads the team with five
home runs, eight hits, 12 runs
batted in and a .333 batting
average. His fielding has also been
statistically flawless, as he has yet to
make an error at first base.
A 6-foot-5, 230-pound senior,
Lundblade feels his three years of
weightlifling experience have been
responsible for his "quick bat" and
power at the plate. Lundblade has
gained 40 pounds since his fresh
man year and 20 pounds during last
summer alone, primarily because of
his weight-training regimen.
In the 1984 season, Lundblade
led the team with a .339 average.
He also drove in 68 runs, the
second best for one season in Stan
ford baseball history, and held the
third-highest RBI total in the
Pacific 10 Conference. Not surpris
ingly, the coaching staff gave
Lundblade the "Come Through"
award last season.
Lundblade played basketball as
well as baseball at Eureka High
School and was voted All-County
and All-League in both sports. Al
though he said California was also
interested in him, "Stanford was

my first choice since my junior year
of high school."
A catcher for his first two years
at Stanford, Lundblade feels he
"grew out of' the position. His
height as well as "troubles" in his
sophomore year prompted a joint
decision by Lundblade and the
coaching staff to move him to first
base at the start of his junior year.
He prefers his current position,
saying he feels "less pressure" at
first base.
A member of the Theta Delta
Chi fraternity, Lundblade enjoys
spending his time off the baseball
field playing golf or racquetball. He
is also a member of the Stanford
chapter of Athletes in Action.
Lundblade said he thinks
'"baseball is a funny thing,"
and lately he appears to have op
posing pitchers feeling the same
way. Saying he is "not worried"
about the disappointing loss to

Santa Clara Sunday, Lundblade
feels it is "early in the season and
the team can pick it up."
Lundblade appears a bit shy in
regard to his current success. Ap
parently uncomfortable to be sin
gled out, he stresses that Stanford's
victories have been an entire team
effort.
An economics major, Lundblade
would someday like to become in
volved in business. His first priority
is the chance to play professional
baseball, however. Although he
claims he can't plan on a baseball
career, Lundblade said, "It's what
I'd like to do. I've played this long
and I want to finish it out."
In Lundblade's 123 games at
Stanford, he has proven himself to
be both an excellent power hitter
and defensive first baseman. He has
displayed his ability to "come
through" for Cardinal baseball.
