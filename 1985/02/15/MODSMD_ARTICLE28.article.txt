# Baseball faces Fresno
## 
### JOHN LIS Editorial staff 
Coming off an offensive onslaught in an 18-3 victory
over the University of San Francisco Tuesday, the Stan
ford baseball team will try to improve its 5-2 record this
weekend when the Cardinal faces Fresno State in a four
game series.
The games tonight and tomorrow are in Fresno, while
Sunday's and Monday's games will be at Sunken Dia
mond. Those two will start at 1 p.m. Tonight's game at
Tresno is expected to be close to a sellout of 3,500.
The Bulldogs are 6-2 this season and ranked No. 18 in
the ESPN College Baseball Poll. Having dropping two of
three games to California to open the season, Fresno has
won five straight.
Fresno was 54-12 last year and qualified for the
regional playoffs. The Bulldogs won their sixth straight
Northern California Baseball Association title last year.
This year they are in the Pacific Coast Athletic Associa
tion.
The Bulldogs' starting pitchers have thrown shutouts in
their last two games. Mark Gardner is the ace of the
Fresno staff. He has a 3-0 record, and in 23 innings has
given up only 11 hits and no earned runs. He has 19

strikeouts.
Pitcher Ken Crew has won his first two starts of the
season and has a 2.89 average.
Shortstop Joe Xavier is leading the Bulldogs in hitting,
with a .438 average and nine RBIs.
Fresno Coach Bob Bennett believes Xavier is the
premier shortstop in college baseball. "I've had a chance
to see a lot of college baseball teams as well as players on
international teams, and I haven't seen any player better
than Joe Xavier," Bennett said.
Xavier is the nephew of Toronto Blue Jays Manager
Bobby Cox.
Outfielder Eric Fox is the only other Bulldog hitting
over .300. He is at .333 with one home run and seven
RBIs. Fresno is hitting .275 as a team.
After seven games for Stanford, outfielder Walt Harris
is leading the Cardinal in hitting with a .357 average and
three doubles.
Catcher John Ramos is hitting .320 with two home runs
and six RBIs, and centerfielder Mark Davis is hitting. 308.
Davis had a career-high six RBIs against USF Tuesday.
First baseman Rick Lundblade has been the Cardinal's
power threat this season. Lundblade has five home runs
and 13 RBIs in only seven games. He is hitting .296.
