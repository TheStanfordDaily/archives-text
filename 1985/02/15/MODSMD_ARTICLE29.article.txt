# Big weekend for Cardinal gymnastics
## Women host Cardinal Classic 
### CAROLYN TARKINGTON Staff sportswriter 
This is a big weekend for both the men's and women's
gymnastics teams. Tonight the Cardinal women host the
second annual Cardinal Classic, while the men go to
Berkeley to compete in a five-way competion against Cal
ifornia, San Jose State, UC-Davis, Washington and Long
Beach City College.
The Cardinal women have a second meet tomorrow
night against UCLA and Utah at UCLA.
"The classic should be an exciting competiton"
Women's Coach Homer Sardinasaid. "Washington is cur
rently ranked at 10th and has one of the top freshman
recruits in the nation on their team."
The classic will feature, along with Washington, Cali
fornia and San Diego State.
"We're aiming to break our team record," Sardina said.
The Cardinal women set a record of 183.25 points in last
week's meet against Cal State-North ridge. "It is going to
take a lot of team energy, but we are capable of doing it,"
Sardina said.
In tomorrow night's competition the women will face
two of the top teams in the nation. UCLA is currently
ranked No. 8, and Utah, currently ranked No. 1, has won
the NCAA championship for the past four years.
"Our approach to this competition will be the same as it
is for all competitions," Sardina said. "We'll aim for con
sistency, hitting as many routines possible."
For the Stanford men, Coach Sadeo Hamada predicts
that tonight's five-way meet will not be a tough one. "Our
biggest competition will be against Cal. We did beat them
by six points last weekend, so I don't think they'll really be
much of a threat this weekend, but they will have the
home-court advantage," Hamada said.
After last weekend's record-breaking team perfor
mance totaling 277.65 points, the Cardinal men are unof
ficially ranked No. 8 in the nation.
Hamada said he hopes to see his team score 275 team
points or more and that his only concern is that this is the
first big away meet of the season.
