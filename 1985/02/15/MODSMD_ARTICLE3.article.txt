# Animal welfare suit dismissed
## 
### BARBARA SCHULER 
A lawsuit charging Stanford and four other
defendants with violations of the Animal Welfare
Act was dismissed last week by a federal judge.
Three local humane societies, plaintiffs in the
case, were denied "standing" by U.S. District
Court Judge Stanley Weigel in his Feb. 5 dismissal,
meaning they have no right to sue.
The dismissal order also concluded "that the
plaintiffs have failed to state a claim upon which
relief can be granted." Under the California penal
code, research institutions that use laboratory
animals are exempt from anti-cruelty laws. As a
result, Weigel declared the matter "moot."
The suit, filed on April 12, 1984, arose in
response to the death of a laboratory dog being
used by a Stanford doctor for research at the Palo
Alto Veteran's Administration Medical Center. A

Stanford medical student discovered the dog, which,
according to reports, had been bitten by an animal
in an adjacent cage. The dog was taken to a Palo
Alto veterinarian who put it to sleep, believing that
it was in pain and would not recover.
The plaintiffs, which include the Palo Alto,
Peninsula and Santa Clara Valley Humane
Societies, expect to decide whether to appeal the
dismissal within two or three weeks, according to
Warren Broderick. executive director of the Santa
Clara group. "We've talked about it, but we
haven't come to any definite decision," he said.
Although the case had no legal precedent,
Brodrick said he "thought we maybe had a 50-50
chance. . . . We're very disappointed, obviously."
Despite this setback, Brodrick said, "We're not
going to let it (the case) die."
Stanford officials felt "vindicated," according to

a statement released by the medical center. In that
statement, Assoc. Dean David Mendelow said,
"We are gratified that the court has clarified a po
tential misconception about Stanford's standards of
animal care."
When contacted for further comment, Mendelow
said, "The fact that the judge saw no merit to the
case indicates that Stanford University's program
(of animal care) . . . more than complies with the
statutes (currently on the books)."
Rodney Johnson, managing attorney for medical
affairs at Stanford, also denied the University's cul
pability in the incident. "In factual context, the dog
was at the VA, owned by the VA, cared for by the
VA, housed in the VA. It wasn't like the animal
was part of Stanford University," he said.
In separate investigations, both the
VA and the U.S. Department of
Agriculture concluded "that this was
an isolated incident and with some
cage modifications, it wouldn't hap
pen again," Johnson said.
The plaintiffs aren't convinced. "It
should be understood by the public
that just because the case was dis
missed does not mean justice has
been done. It means we do not have
the instruments for trying to see
justice done," said Lise Giraud,
a member of the Palo Alto Humane
Society's board of directors and a li
brarian at Green.
Giraud complained that "the
animals themselves cannot get legal
standing, and the humane societies
were denied standing on behalf of the
animals. There can, in effect, be no
plaintiff."
Because current laws have blocked
legal action at this point, Brodrick
said the next step might not be an ap
peal, but an attempt to change the
state law exempting research institu
tions like Stanford from the Animal
Welfare Act.
