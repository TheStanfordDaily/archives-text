# Women cagers in Arizona for rematches
## 
### PABLO MORALES Staff sportswriter 
Neither the women's basketball teams of
Arizona State nor Arizona are enjoying the best
of seasons. Nevertheless, they will hardly be push
overs as Stanford seeks to end a three-game
losing streak in Arizona this weekend.
Last month, the Cardinal was successful
against both teams, toppling the Wildcats 63-52
and squeaking by the Sun Devils 68-67 at
home.
"Whenever you beat a team at home, it's al
ways tough to travel to their backyard and
repeat," Stanford Asst. Coach Mike Kehoe
said. "We expect two competitive games."
The Sun enter today's game against
Stanford with a 1-6 conference record and a 9-

11 overall mark. Their recent 87-74 win over
Arizona was their first conference victory.
Leading the offensive attack for the Sun
Devils is 5-foot-7 junior guard Jodi Rathbun,
who is enjoying another fine season, averaging
14.2 points and 3.4 rebounds per game. Her
five assists a game leads the team.
"Rathbun is the catalyst; she makes things
happen," Kehoe said. "We have to seal off the
perimeter in order to prevent her from
penetrating the lane. She's the kind of player
that if you allow her to penetrate, she'll create a
desirable offensive situation for their team."
Two other players who are scoring in double
figures for the Sun Devils are 6-0 sophomore
forwards Sherry Doole (13.0, 5.1) and Robin
Connolly (11.5, 5.3). Center Tanya Morris, a 6-

4 freshman, is leading the team with an average
of 6.3 rebounds a game.
Arizona is winless thus far in the Western
Collegiate Athletic Association at 0-7, and,
after losses to Pepperdine, 79-73, and ASU, the
Wildcats shouldn't present too much difficulty
for the Cardinal tomorrow night.
The Wildcats are usually tough at home, but
they'll need some exceptional play from a
couple of key players in order to be competitive.
Kirsten Smith, a 5-5 junior, is another play
making guard that the Cardinal will have to
contend with this weekend. Smith's stats have
dropped off a couple points to 11.9 points
and 2.8 rebounds per game, but she is always a
threat to create havoc for defenses.
Forward Yolanda Turner, a 6-0 sophomore,

is starting to play well as of late. Her numbers
(7.1, 2.8) do not reflect the overall contribution
she has made to the team in the last three
games.
Should the Cardinal get good point produc
tion from its inside game, it will more than likely
come back home with two more wins under its
belt. Kehoe stressed the need for inside point
production.
"We need our inside people to score either
off of post feeds or offensive boards. We just
can't rely on 15-foot outside jumpers."
Forward Mary Bradach is coming off a fine
performance against San Diego State last Satur
day and should figure prominently in the Card
inal's inside game. Her 6.8 rebounds per game
lead the team.
