# Women bear down for Big Meet at Cal
## 
### INGRID SEYER Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford women's swim team
closes out its regular season this
weekend as it travels to California
tomorrow. The meet, which starts at
noon, should be a very close one, ac
cording to Coach George Haines.
"Cal really scares me," Haines
said. "They have a super team and
are really going to give us a fight."
The Bears, currently ranked
seventh in the nation, are 7-2 this
season with losses to Arizona State,
58-55, and USC, 88-52. Stanford, 4-
1, the No. 2 team in the country, fell
to No. 1-ranked Texas last weekend,
88-52.
Although the Cardinal edges out
the Bears in the rankings, that edge
may be the only one Stanford will
have tomorrow. Cal will be led by
Olympic gold medalist Mary T.
Meagher and All-Americans Conny
van Bentum and Cindy Tuttle.
"Meagher could easily win three
events, if she is swimming well, as can
van Bentum," Haines said. "Our girls
are really going to have to be pushing
hard in order to keep the meet close
all the way."

Tuttle and Amy Clark have a
strong chance of dominating the
breaststroke events, although Stan
ford's Kathy Smith should be in the
running for both the 100- and 200-
yard breaststrokes.
The Bears field very strong relay
times and, according to Haines, could
win both the 400 medley and 400
freestyle relays.
"Cal's medley relay is one of the
strongest around," Haines said.
"They have clocked a 3:46 and the
best we have gone is 3:47.04."
Stanford will be looking to win
both backstroke events, led by the
corps of Jennifer Pokluda, Patty
Gavin and Julie Miller. The Cardinal
also has a good chance of taking the
distance freestyle events and the 400
individual medley.
Marybeth Linzmeier, Stacy Shupe
and Liza Hazen are the top distance
swimmers for Stanford, while Patty
Gavin and Jenny Rapp lead the Card
inal in the I.M. events.
Stanford is expected to capture
both the 1- and 3-meter diving com
petitions, and according to Haines,
the diving could decide the meet.
