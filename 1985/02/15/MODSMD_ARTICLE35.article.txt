# Lombard Street has more than just curves

Lombard Street.
Mention these two words and virtually everyone imme
diately pictures the narrow winding street in San Fran
cisco, with its flower-lined drives and magnificent view of
the City from the top. What many people may not realize
is that Lombard Street offers much more than this famous
portion of the road.
If you drive down Van Ness Avenue and turn south
onto Lombard, you enter the fashionable Marina District.
Here there are a number of famous historical landmarks
and a variety of buildings, ranging from the tastefully ele
gant to the run down. The newly remodeled Marina Inn,
the Hotel Edward 11, a French dining/dancing club, and
the Marina Cafe are all on this street, as is Scott's Restau
rant, where French President Francois Mitterrand chose
to dine last year to the chagrin of a number of French res
taurateurs.
Fisherman's Wharf, Pier 39, the Exploratorium, Union
Street and an assortment of clothing boutiques, cafes and
bars are all within easy walking distance of this section of
Lombard Street. Although not as popular or recognized
as the curving block of Lombard, the street's Marina Dis
trict offers much of interest to those who look.
Perhaps the most inconvenient, as well as expensive,
part of a trip to the City is parking. Free parking is diffi
cult Tl.id at any time of the day, and it may take hours to
do so. Consequently, it pays in time and money to drive
down Lombard Street and park in one of the less crowded
(and free) side streets. If you make this area your base,
you'll be able to spend the rest of your day, evening or
weekend enjoying yourself without having to return regu
larly to put money in a meter or worry about a large bill at
a parking garage.
One block up from Lombard is Union Street. Flower
vendors on every street corner lend extra color to a street
teeming with people from every walk of life. You can sit in
the sun and enjoy breakfast or lunch at one of the
delicatessens or bakeries, or visit the classy Blue Light
Cafe. The cafe, owned by musician Boz Scaggs, caters to
a younger Yuppie-type crowd and is chic and modern.
The bar and people dominate here; the cafe's soft salmon

walls are a soothing element. Ifs a fun place to go for
drinks; there are a number of metal-topped tables in the
bar area where you can sit and observe people inside as
well as on the street.
Across the street is another colorful hangout with a
character all its own. You won't find Yuppies here; in
stead, the old Victorian house with its red facade and
stained-glass windows caters to a more earthy, organic
crowd.
Tuesday is the Chinese New Year and you may want to
spend some time exploring the City then if you haven't
done so over President's Weekend. San Francisco offers
so much to do and see that a weekend visit sometime
during the year is a must. Driving home in the early hours
of the morning is neither fun nor safe; consequently, you
have a number of reasons for staying overnight. Accom
modations range from lavish and costly to moderately
priced and simple. The Marina Inn and the Hotel Edward
11, both just off Lombard Street, offer pleasant accom
modations with a touch of European charm.
The Marina Inn
3110 Octavia St.
San Francisco
928-1000
After two years of remodeling and renovating, the
Marina Inn celebrated its grand opening Saturday. The
40-room bed and breakfast located at the corner of Oc
tavia and Lombard Streets is the height of elegance.
As you enter the inn, it is hard not to notice the
columned archway hand-sculpted by the renowned artist
Manuel Palos. Inside, the lobby is decorated with gor
geous Italian marble floor tiling and lovely lalique crystal
chandeliers. The lobby, parlor, hallways and dining areas
are also the settings for many magnificent furnishings and
oil paintings.
Each of the inn's 40 rooms is individually decorated.
Fabulous handwoven Peking rugs enhance the hardwood
floors and set the theme for each room. The walls, bed
coverings and drapes of each room coordinate beautifully

with the rugs. Exquisite 18th-century European furnish
ings along with antique brass and wood beds give each
room an Old World charm. Details such as brass
doorknobs and lamps give the room its finishing touches.
In addition, each room has a private bath which includes
such fineries as a lovely marble vanity, a combination bath
and shower, a heating lamp and a fragrant selection of two
intimately wrapped soaps.
For further comfort, each room contains a cable TV, an
AM/FM clock radio, an antique-style phone and an adjus
table thermostat. The Marina Inn also contains its own
beauty shop and boutique.
Breakfast is served to the inn's guests every morning
from 8 to 10. Breakfast includes fresh-ground specialty
coffees, exotic teas, fresh-squeezed orange juice and deli
cious baked bread and French pastries. Each evening in
** the parlor, beer and wine are served. And in the late
evenings when you return to your room, you will find your
bed turned down with delicious Ghirardelli chocolates on
the pillows.
The Marina Inn is located only a few blocks from such
key dining, shopping and entertainment locations as
Chestnut and Union Streets. Marina Green/Marina Park,
public tennis courts and a combination spa and gym are
also two or three blocks away and provide great opportu
nities for exercising. The staff is very helpful in aiding you
plan your transportation and reservation arrangements, as
well as giving you excellent directions or anything else you
might need.
Reservations for a special and romantic weekend stay in
San Francisco at The Marina Inn are $75 for any room, a
price you will find well worth it!
Hotel Edward II
3155 Scott St.
San Francisco
921-9776
The Hotel Edward II goes back to the days of the
Panama-Pacific International Exposition in 1915. The

hotel has since been renovated and the "second" added to
the name in honor of the changes. The hospitable inn
keepers pride themselves on offering visitors a quaint
stay with European-style bed and breakfast. Unlike so
many bed-and-breakfast establishments in the area, this
36-room hotel provides comfortable accommodations at ex
tremely affordable prices.
Located on the corner of Scott and Lombard Streets,
the inn is a tiny community. Rooms occupy the second
and third floors, with both an authentic French-Italian
bakery and a fine bar and Italian seafood restaurant on
the ground floor. The price of the rooms includes break
fast in the bakery, complimentary wine at one of three
restaurants nearby, shared bath and shower and a cozy,
spotlessly clean room. For $35 one gets a double bed;
queens cost $45. Rooms with a private bath are also
available for $50.
In each room is a television set, a sink and original an
tique furnishings. Flowers placed on the chests of drawers
brighten the rooms. Outside the rooms, the hallways are
warm and cheerful. Green carpets, live potted flowers
along the walls and a skylight with a stained-glass inset en
hance the beauty of the old building.
We were encouraged to dine at the Marina Cafe, a res
taurant located below the hotel but not owned by the
same person. The restaurant is divided into two parts: To
the left of the entrance is the bar and to the right is the
dining area. By separating the two, noise from the bar
doesn't bother diners. Although we had reservations, the
bar is extremely pleasant and I wouldn't have minded
having a drink or two before dinner.
In addition to alcohol, one can order espresso at the
bar. The coffee beans are ground on the premises and
then brewed in an ornate brass espresso maker. Located
behind the bar in the middle of the many glass bottles, the
espresso maker is a shining sight to behold. Instead of the
style odor of beer which often pervades a bar, here one
•smells the rich aroma of coffee.
I he restaurant offers its early dinner special for
"$7.95, which is a fantastic bargain. After 7 p.m. the prices
return to rates more comparable to other restaurants ser
ving pasta, seafoods and veal, among other entrees. In the
evening the entrees start at $8.95 and include specials
such as fresh sole or salmon as well as the regular features.
We dined as a group of four, and one person in our
party ordered the antipasto appetizer ($5). The waiter
warned her that the portion was too large for one person
who wished to eat an entree as well, so we took her advice
to share the entree among the four of us. When it was
-served. I was surprised and pleased to see that it was
indeed enough to satisfy four hungry people. There was a
generous serving of salami, ham, cheese, olives, tomatoes,
cucumbers and mushrooms on a bed of lettuce, topped
with a light seasoning.
As we sipped our complimentary glasses of chardonnay
and broke apart the warm French bread, we agreed on
how peaceful the mood of the restaurant was. The waiters
were most attentive and the restaurant was quickly filling
up, yet we felt undisturbed.
When the waiter arrived with our entrees, we
proceeded to eat with minimal conversation and a lot of
cross-sampling of dishes. Two members of our party or
dered pasta. One had seafood fettucini with mushrooms
and a light sauce as well. Each bite was a different experi
ence and he savored the different combinations, finally
claiming that he'd obviously ordered the specialty of the
house. One of us had ordered sole, one of the evening's
specials, and it was without fault. I ordered prawns, and
chose a tomato provencal sauce with mushrooms from
the variety of sauces offered. Served with crisp slices of
carrot and zucchini and a choice of rice or scalloped
potatoes, all of the entrees looked delicious, and we all
emerged extremely satisfied with the quality of the food
and service.
Having saved so much on the price of the entrees, it was
tough to say "No" to dessert. Perhaps the most difficult
dessert to eat is the chocolate mousse torte: It just looks
too good to eat! A wafer-thin slice of chocolate tops this
delightful concoction which is everything chocolate
mousse and chocolate torte should be. With either a cup
of coffee (or espresso) or milk, it can't be improved upon.
More unusual is the zabigone, an Italian custard made
with Marsala wine, among other ingredients. Served warm
with two cherry halves and whipped cream, it is also very
tasty.
