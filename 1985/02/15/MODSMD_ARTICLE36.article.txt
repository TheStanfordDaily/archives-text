## Shepard's tequila vision marks mid- career 
### 
"Fool for Love and Other Plays"
By Sam Shepard
Bantam, 307 pp., $6.95
Sam Shepard — author of dozens of plays, actor,
boyfriend of Jessica Lange — has said, "1 have
American scars on my brain. With the publication
ol his second volume of plays, we can see the won
derful designs they have made.
In many ways, Shepard appears to be in the
middle of a career that may turn out to be as
prolific and important as Faulkner's. He certainly
has a Faulknerian obsessiveness of vision. But if we
can fancy the Mississippi novelist's fiercely local vi
sion of Yoknapatawpha County as having the dark
and woozy feel of Bourbon, Shepard's plays have a
kind of hyper-lucid, tilted, tequila clarity to them.
And while Shepard is incessantly focused on
America (or, more specifically, on the American
West), he never defines an explicit or naturalistic
teriain. hxcept for four or five recurring props
(motel beds, cowboy boots, guns, electric guitars
and amps are everywhere), Shepard's world has
been distilled almost to pure fable. Likewise, the
characters he puts on stage don't have what one
conventionally thinks of as fixed "personalities" —
they tend to mix, trade or disappear. Yet their
voices are marvelously colloquial and distinctive,
and Shepard s tricky switches never come off as
being merely "experimental" in the academic and
bad sense of the term.
One of Shepard's chief accomplishments is his
invention of new theatrical forms that are as in
stantly accessible as rock 'n' roll — even if the audi
ence can t come away from his work with a
coherent explanation of what it has witnessed.
Shepard, who indeed once wanted to be a rock star,
could fit most easily in the New York Wiped Out
School of Patti Smith (with whom he lived for a
while in the early '70s) and Lou Reed, whose lyrics
resist any sort of didactic condensing and that typi
cally conclude by pointing you somewhere both
jarringly uncertain and memorably fruitful.
If Shepard doesn't respect the traditional notion
of a theatrical character, it is because he sees his

creations as consciously trying to identity their own
— as one in " Action" puts it. "I'm looking forward
to my life. I'm looking forward to, uh, me. The way
I picture me." Similarly, Shepard's plays don't ex
plore a set of myths that are already established
about America so much as they describe
Americans citizens trying to find a myth they can
respect.

One of Shepard's chief
accomplishments is his
invention of new theatri
cal forms as instantly ac
cessible as rock "n" roll.

In a play he wrote with Patti Smith, "Cowboy
Mouth," Cavale kidnaps a guy named Slim and
hopes to make him into an American rock 'n" roll
messiah. "1 mean I can't be the saint people dream
of now," she says. "People want a street angel.
I hey want a saint with a cowboy mouth. Somebody
to get off on when they can't get off on them
selves. . . . We're earthy people, and the old saints
just don't make it, and the old God is just too far

away. He don't represent our pain no more. His
words don't shake through us no more. Any great
motherfucker rock n' roll song can raise me higher
than all Revelations."
Most ot the plays in this edition transfer easily to
the written page, perhaps because the sets Shepard
creates are so hare and his stage directions so suc
cinct. (There is one exception: "Suicide in B-flat"
suffers because much of the play consists of rock 'n'
roll lyrics that need those three amplified chords to
take their dopey shrillness away.) Otherwise, his
stagings are easy to picture. In the title play, for in
stance, Eddie and May meet up in a Mohave desert
motel room and wonder whether they should com
mit incest again. In the kind of chilling yet lyrical
monolog for which Shepard is famous, Eddie tells
the story of how he discovered that his father was
bigamous. He drags his sister's befuddled boyfriend
around the stage with him, touching all the walls —
a simple and perfect way to evoke the inexorable
tragedy Eddie's past will surely tag him with.
And "Geography of a Horse Dreamer" begins
"in darkness,' with "the sound of horses galloping
at a distance heard. A slow motion color film clip of
a horse race is projected just above Cody's head on
the rear wall. No screen. The film begins out of
focus and slowly is pulled into a sharp picture as the
sound of galloping grows louder. The film clip lasts
for a short while with the sound, then Cody wakes
up with a yell ('Silky Sullivan in the seventh! 1 ). The
film goes off and the lights on stage bang up."
In "Geography," two hoods kidnap this Cody —
a Wyoming cowboy who can pick the winners at the
horse track in his dreams— and lug him from room
to room all over the world, never telling him where
he is, until he is finally robbed of his magic power.
This is a brisk and wicked parable of the American
artist being systematically co-opted and plundered
by this country's cultural institutions. But it is a lot
more. When Cody's two huge, dust-covered broth
ers come on stage with less than a page to go, the
result is pure, silent theater.
