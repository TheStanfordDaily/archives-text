## Panel argues women in military Cuts 
### DEBORAH KEHLE Staff writer 
A panel of noted female university
faculty members and administrators
addressed an almost entirely female
audience last night on the role of
women in the military and the peace
movement.
"Women have to assume the re
sponsibility for the dirty jobs in soci
ety," said Judith Steihm, vice provost
in charge of faculty affairs at the Uni
versity of Southern California. She
said women should be part of the mil
itary on equal terms with men. If they
aren't, "you end up with a class of cit
izen called the protector and another
called the protected. . . . We permit
them (men) to use us to justify what
they do." That helps perpetuate the
myth that "war is manly." It is a myth
that takes "terrible advantage of
young men's uncertainty of identity,"
she said.
"Women are always going to be
relegated to second-class citizenship
in the military," responded Marge
Franz, a history professor at UC-
Santa Cruz. She called Steihm's belief
that giving women an equal role in
the military would change things for
the better "wishful thinking."
"I see the military as our endan
gerers, not protectors," she said, call
ing for active support for the peace
movement.
But Elsa Garcia, a Spanish profes
sor at Cal State-Hayward, said she
could not "take a pacifist position."
Given the repression of former
Nicaraguan President Anastasio
Somoza, "I can hardly stand here,
from my relatively comfortable,
relatively safe place" and say that the
people of Nicaragua should not wage
war. For them, pacifism is "not an op
tion," she said.
She pointed out that although men

and women were originally trained
together in the Nicaraguan military,
they are now trained separately. Al
though women played important
roles in the 1979 revolution, often
leading successful military campaigns,
the new draft laws have changed the
status of women in the army to
strictly voluntary service. Men,
however, are still drafted.
"As a poet, I've never thought in
terms of gender," said Denise Lever
tov, an English professor here. She
said the peace movement is "a human
task."
"It seems naive to me to suppose
that women any more than young
men could withstand" the force of
military indoctrination, she said in
response to Steihm's statements. "I
know what a giant organization does
to one's moral fiber . . . you go
along. . . , [Women] are going to
become part of it. It's like, 'You are
what you eat.' "

Steihm responded that military in
doctrination wasn't the problem.
"The civilians have been more ir
responsible than the military." She
said that among Nixon's advisers
during the Vietnam War, the civilian
advisers were the "hawks."
One area of agreement among the
panelists, however, was their disap
pointment in the size of the audience.
Fewer than 50 people attended the
symposium. "Where are the under
graduates?" asked Levertov. As ex
planation for the lack of response,
Franz said, "I think there is a great
deal of despair ... a hopelessness" as
to what people can do about the
threat of war.
The Cubberley Auditorium sympo
sium was chaired by Asst. Political
Science Prof. Condoleezza Rice, who
is the assistant director of the Stan
ford Center for International Security
and Arms Control.
