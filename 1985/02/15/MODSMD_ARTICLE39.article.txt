Lolita (1962)
Faculty Lounge (Building 300-303)
Though it was almost universally dis
missed on its release as a watering-down
of the novel — a novel, incidentally, that
had been reviled in many quarters on
publication — Stanley Kubrick's black
comedy is possibly his best movie.
Vladimir Nabokov did his own adapta
tion, retaining a surprising amount of the
verbal wit of the original, and the cast
could hardly be better: James Mason as
Humbert Humbert, lover of nymphets;
Shelley Winters as pretentious, clinging
Charlotte Haze; and best of all, Peter
Sellers as Clare Quilty. None of them has
ever surpassed his work in this movie.
The film is overlong, structurally flawed
and drably photographed, but it is none
theless one of the best American movies
of the 19605. With Sue Lyon, certainly
adequate as Lolita.
Plays Thursday at 7.
From Here to Eternity (1953)
Kresge Auditorium
One of the two or three best American
movies of the early '50s. Daniel
Taradash adapted James Jones' bestsel
ler about soldiers stationed at Pearl Har
bor just before the Japanese attack in
1941, and Fred Zinnemann directed,
beautifully. The extraordinary cast in
cludes Montgomery Clift (giving his
greatest performance) as the sensitive
bugler Pruitt; Burt Lancaster as the ser
geant in love with his captain's wife,
played by Deborah Kerr; Frank Sinatra
as mouthy, appealing Maggio; Donna
Reed as the nightclub "hostess" (a Hays
Code euphemism) in love with Pruitt;
and Ernest Borgnine as the evil bully in
charge of the stockade. Among the se
quences movie lovers have cherished for
years are Lancaster's first advance to
Kerr; the love scene on the beach
(memorably spoofed by Sid Caesar and
Imogene Coca on TV); the communal
drunk scene that climaxes in Maggio's
death; and — most moving of all —
Pruitt's bugle tribute to his dead buddy.
The haunting melody sung in the drunk
scene is "Re-enlistment Blues."
Plays tonight at 8.
Tightrope (1984)
Memorial Auditorium
In this sluggish, obvious and consis
tently badly acted thriller, written and
directed by Richard Tuggle, Clint
Eastwood plays a cop whose search for a
psychopathic murderer hitting exclu
sively on active members of the sexual
underground in New Orleans exposes his
own need for sexual excitement of an un
savory nature. Every hustler in the city
seems to have Eastwood's number; they
take one look at that absolutely inex
pressive face and immediately guess that
he's eager for the same kind of kicks as
the man he's trying to track down. The
movie has been a hit in surprising cor
ners because Tuggle positioned his hero
on appealing psychological terrain —
he's tapped into the "Vertigo" vein. And
so a dull, realistic murder story suddenly
becomes, without warning, an expres
sionistic fable about the tightrope all
men walk between the darkest corner of
their souls and their more "acceptable"
sexual selves, even though Tuggle is no
expressionist and Clint Eastwood is, God
knows, no actor. With Genevieve Bujold
and Alison Eastwood as her father's
daughter.
Plays Sunday at 7 and 9:30.
Alice Adams (1935)
U.C. Theater, Berkeley
George Stevens' film of the Booth
Tarkington novel, scripted by Dorothy
Yost and Mortimer Offner, is a brilliant
social comedy-drama — one of the best
American pictures of its period, or, per
haps, of any period. Alice (Katharine
Hepburn) dreams of shaking free of her
lower middle-class roots, but her hope
less family — a fatuous, ineffectual
father (Fred Stone, the vaudeville star
who played the Scarecrow on stage in
"The Wizard of Oz" in 1903), a nagging
mother (Ann Shoemaker), and a dis
solute brat of a brother (Frank Al
bertson) — stand in her way. (The
domestic scenes could not possibly be
better performed.) Katharine Hepburn
plays Alice with such powerful urgency
that we suffer with her as each petty
humiliation threatens to overwhelm her;
Hepburn makes Alice's affectations
painful and touching, because she always
lets us see the depth of feeling beneath
them. The scene in which, after a hor

rible dinner with her family, she asks the
man of her dreams (Fred Mac Murray,
unfortunately) if she has driven him
away is one of the high points in the his
tory of American acting. This is Hep
burn's greatest performance of the '30s
— even more astonishing than "Little
Women" or "Holiday." Hattie
McDaniel, Evelyn Venable, Hedda
Hopper, Charley Grapewin and Grady
Sutton are in the cast.
Plays Thursday with "The Magnificent
Ambersons."
The Bicycle Thief (1948)
Cedar, San Francisco
Vittorio De Sica's fable about a man
driven to stealing in the poverty-stricken
Rome of the post-World War II epoch
appears on every list of all-time great
movies. Like the two other neo-realist
masterpieces De Sica made with
screenwriter Cesare Zavattini,
"Shoeshine" and "Umberto D," this
movie touches one so intimately that it is
almost an invasion of privacy; it is shock
ing, shattering and finally exhilarating.
De Sica takes us to the deepest reaches
of despair and out the other side. With
Lamberto Maggiorani, Lianella Carelli
and Enzo Staiola.
Plays Tuesday through Thursday with
"Miracle in Milan."
Miracle in Milan (1951)
Cedar, San Francisco
The director, Vittorio De Sica, and the
screenwriter, Cesare Zavattini, were fa
mous for shattering neo-realist pictures
like "Shoeshine" and"The Bicyle
Thief' when they took a holiday with
this enchanting fantasy, based on Zavat
tini's novel "Toto the Good." De Sica's
humanism and his keen eye for social in
justice are still in evidence, but the style
is a wild blend of slapstick magic and so
cial satire: Fur-collared rich men bicker
over land like bulldogs growling and
yapping at each other, lovers swing from
poles and turn somersaults, a balloon
seller in danger of floating away with his
wares is fed bread by his neighbors to
weigh him down. This movie achieves
what Jean Giraudoux attempted in "The
Madwoman of Chaillot." Francesco
Golissano plays Toto, the saintly idiot
who saves his community. Brunella Bovo
plays the girl he loves, and Emma Gram
matica gives a joyous performance as the
merry, magical old woman who raises
Toto.
Plays Tuesday through Thursday with
"The Bicycle Thief."
Death Takes a Holiday (1934)
Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley
Fredric March gives a witty perfor
mance as Death, who masquerades as a
mortal for a couple of days in order to
find out why men fear him and why they
cling to their lives. The dialogue (by
Maxwell Anderson, Gladys Lehman and
Walter Ferris) is weighed down with
ironies, but March makes them ring with
humor. This material started out as a
play by the Italian writer Alberto
Casella, and then Anderson wrote his
own stage version; unhappily, as the
drawing-room philosophizing drones on
and on, the film's theatrical origins are
all too clear. But Mitchell Leisen, the
director, with the help of an expert
photographer (Charles Lang) and art
director (Ernst Fegte), gives it an elegant
setting and a dark fantasy style all its
own. Evelyn Venable plays the woman
who captures Death's heart; her voice is
permanently pitched on the verge of hys
teria, but she really is beautiful enough
(in a Merle Oberon way) to make his
passion convincing. With Katharine Al
exander, Sir Guy Standing, Helen
Westley, Kent Taylor, Henry Travers,
Gail Patrick and Kathleen Howard. The
most memorable moment: March's reac
tion when Venable pins a flower to his
vest and he finds it doesn't wither.
Plays tomorrow with "The Scarlet
Empress."
Humoresque (1946)
Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley
Clifford Odets wrote "Golden Boy"

for John Garfield when both men
worked in the Group Theatre in the mid
-19308, but the director, Harold Clur
man, didn't think Garfield could carry
off the role of the young violinist-turned
boxer, so he cast Luther Adler instead.
Then William Holden landed the film
role, because Warner Brothers had Gar
field on contract and refused to loan him
out to another studio. (Garfield finally
got to play it, near the end of his career,
in a Hollywood revival.) This movie,
which Odets and Zachary Gold adapted
from a Fannie Hurst novel and Jean
Negulesco directed, must have been the
consolation prize: Garfield plays a vir
tuoso violinist who behaves like a boxer.
The first, brooding close-up of him, with
heavy, fleshy cheeks and a brow grown
into a permanent overcast, suggests that
he's ready to take the "Golden Boy"
role to new heights, but then, after the
first half hour, Joan Crawford turns up as
an alcoholic patroness of the arts, and
the movie turns into a Joan Crawford
picture. And she is awful. The doomed
romance between these two goes on for
most of an eternity, until at last, while his
greatest concert blares on the radio, she
walks (slowly) into the ocean. (The
music he is playing, in case you needed
to be told, is Wagner's "Liebestod.")
The cast includes Oscar Levant as Gar
field's best friend, J. Carrol Naish and
Ruth Nelson as his parents, Joan
Chandler, Tom D'Andrea, Craig
Stevens, Bobby (Robert) Blake, and
John Abbott, who gets stuck with the
booby prize line: "There's fire in his
playing — kind of like what you find in a
Van Gogh painting — a touch of the
savage — it's good for the art!"
Plays Thursday with "One Day Pina
Asked ..." and "I'm Hungry, I'm
Cold."
The Scarlet Empress (1934)
Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley
One of Josef von Sternberg's baroque
pastries starring Marlene Dietrich. She
plays Catherine the Great with a
ridiculously affected breathlessness, but
it doesn't matter, because the movie
never touches the earth at all; it's high
kitsch all the way. Hans Dreier, Peter
Ballbusch and Richard Kollorsz, the art
directors, are the real stars — all you're
likely to remember afterwards is the en
tertainingly lunatic decor. John Lodge,
Sam Jaffe, Louise Dresser and C.
Aubrey Smith can be seen in the midst of
the madness. Manuel Komroff wrote the
script and Bert Glennon supervised the
incredibly elaborate lighting.
Plays tomorrow with "Death Takes a
Holiday."
The Love Parade (1929)
Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley
Ernst Lubitsch directed this early
talkie operetta with Maurice Chevalier
and Jeanette Mac Donald; it's a version
of a play called "The Prince Consort,"
and Ernst Vajda and Guy Bolton wrote
the screenplay. Most musicals of this
period were such lumbering, stage
bound bores that the fluidity of
Lubitsch's camera was a revelation to its
first audiences; the picture was
nominated for an Academy Award,

scored enough of a success to spawn
several others (most of them directed by
Lubitsch and starring Mac Donald, all of
them featuring Chevalier), and film his
torians still consider it one of the
breakthrough musicals. Seen today,
however, it appears awfully precious and
a little tedious. Victor Schertzinger and
Clifford Grey wrote the songs; Victor
Milner photographed; and the cast in
cludes Lupino Lane, Edgar Norton,
Eugene Pallette, Lionel Belmore, and
the apple-cheeked songstress Lillian
Roth, famous (much later) for her auto
biography "I'll Cry Tomorrow."
Plays Wednesday with "Yesterday's
Witness."
The Magnificent Ambersons (1942)
U.C. Theater, Berkeley
RKO decided that Orson Welles had
been too extravagant with their time and
money when he made this film (his
second, right after "Citizen Kane") of
Booth Tarkington's rich novel, so it cut
40 minutes out of it and gave him a
reputation for irresponsibility that he has
never managed to live down. Yet even in
its truncated form, "Ambersons" is one
of the great American movies. It
chronicles the tumbling of the gracious,
tiered society of the late 19th and early
20th centuries into the age of speed,
through the descent of one grand family.
Welles evokes the declining Victorian
period in scenes of balls and sleigh rides
that one does not forget, and his depic
tion of the private bickering of a public
family is almost expressionistic. A barely
adequate Tim Holt plays the focal char
acter, young George Minafer, but the
rest of the cast is extraordinary, espe
cially Agnes Moorehead as his embit
tered spinster aunt. Richard Bennett as
his grandfather, Dolores Costello as his
mother and Joseph Cotten as the
rejected suitor who loves her all his life.
Also featuring Anne Baxter. Ray Collins
and Erskine Sanford; music by Bernard
Herrmann, and formidable photography
by Stanley Cortez.
Plays Thursday with "Alice Adams."
Spellbound (1945)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
One of the most eagerly anticipated
collaborations in movie historv: Alfred

Hitchcock directs Gregory Peck and In
grid Bergman in a Ben Hecht script, with
dream sequences designed by Salvador
Dali. Unhappy, the movie is a fiasco.
The dream decor is of passing interest,
but the Freudian content is risible ("just
about as much id as could be safely dis
played in a Bergdorf Goodman win
dow," according to James Agee), since it
serves merely as a fairly lunkheaded
strategy for unraveling a murder mys
tery. (Obviously not everyone feels the
same way: Robert Benton aped this
technique in "Still of the Night" — with
predictably catastrophic consequences.)
Leo G. Carroll, Michael Chekhov and
Rhonda Fleming co-star.
Plays Tuesday and Wednesday with
"Rebecca."
The Bounty (1984)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Starting from an unusual source —
Richard Hough's book "Captain Bligh
and Mr. Christian," rather than the
romantic adventure novels by Nordhoff
and Hall that spawned the two earlier
film versions, both called " Mutiny on the
Bounty" — director Roger Donaldson
and screenwriter Robert Bolt build two
fascinating psychological portraits. Bligh
(Anthony Hopkins) is a man driven by
thwarted pride and ambition to conduct
himself in an unreasonable, inhumane
fashion; Christian (Mel Gibson) is an im
mature younger man who rebels against
an older friend standing in loco parentis.
The crux of the conflict between these
two is that Christian is not the man Bligh
thought him, and the discrepancy be
tween Bligh's idealized image of him —
informed at least in part by a homoerotic
interest — and Christian's real nature,
causes Bligh so much mental anguish
that he begins to behave cruelly toward
his friend and toward the sailors who
respect and admire Christian. The first
half of the film is problematic, because
Bolt originally planned two screenplays
to chronicle the tale of the "Bounty"'s
journey to Tahiti, the mutiny, and the
separate fates of Bligh and Christian,
and consequently the movie feels com
pressed and frustratingly episodic. But if
you have the patience to ride out the first
hour, your trust pays off. With fine per
formances by Hopkins, Gibson, Wi Kuki
Kaa, Tevaite Vernette and Philip Martin

Brpwn
Plays Monday with "Das Boot."
Say Amen, Somebody (1983)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Watching the two irepressible oldsters
at the center of this documentary —
Thomas A. Dorsey, the "father of gospel
music," and his prize pupil, Willie Mae
Ford Smith — you get the feeling that
George T. Nierenberg, the producer
director, caught the last vestiges of first
generation gospel. One of the many
pleasures of this movie is that if you are
unfamiliar with old-time gospel, you find
out how amazing the best of it is, and you
see the links to jazz, blues and show
music. Nierenberg, a smart documen
tarian with a sense of irony, has captured
some lovely, unpredictable moments as
well as some overpowering musical per
formances.
Plays tomorrow.
East of Eden (1955)
U.C. Theater, Berkeley
Paul Osborn's screenplay of John
Steinbeck's biblical allegory (Genesis set
in Northern California in the late 19th
and early 20th centuries) uses only the
Cain and Abel section, with Raymond
Massey as Adam Trask, James Dean and
Dick Davalos as his sons Cal and Aaron
and Jo Van Fleet as his estranged wife,
the madam in a neighboring town. When
Cal learns who his mother is, he uses the
knowledge to destroy his brother. One
recognizes the Steinbeck heavy touch —
ironies are stated and restated and over
stated — but the director, Elia Kazan,
emphases the Freudian subtext of the
story, so the period detail notwithstand
ing, this becomes a prime example of
1950s American Freudianizing. Kazan
botches the narrative and the film lopes
and bounds rather than building and
moving forward, but it has tremendously
intense scenes and amazing vitality —
particularly in the scenes between Dean
and Julie Harris, which have the feeling
of improvisation. The excitement in the
performances of these two remarkable
young stars hasn't dimmed; you still get
the sense of actors inventing a whole new
set of rules.
Plays today with "Rebel Without a
Cause."
