# Autism linked to immune system
## 
### PATRICK LIN Editorial staff 
Researchers at Stanford Medical
School may have made a key dis
covery concerning autism, the mys
terious neurological disorder that
causes children to become extremely
withdrawn.
Richard Todd, a resident in the Psy
chiatry Department, and Roland
Ciaranello, chief of the Child Psychi
atry Division, published an initial
report on their findings in the current
issue of the Proceedings of the Na
tional Academy of Sciences.
That report shows autism may
result from an auto-immune reaction.
The investigators found antibodies in
the blood of autistic children that at

tacked the children's nervous sys
tems.
The study also indicates that neural
pathways involving serotonin may be
important in autism. Serotonin is a
neurotransmitter, a chemical mes
senger in the nervous system.
Todd and Ciaranello demonstrated
that antibodies in autistic children at
tacked neural pathways that use
serotonin.
According to Ciaranello. the dis
covery of the antibodies was made
partly by accident.
"Right now, we're viewing it as an
extremely preliminary finding," said
Ciaranello. He pointed out that the
study by no means proved that either

auto-immunity or serotonin pathways
are involved in all cases of autism.
One reason for Ciaranello's cau
tion is that the published report
presents detailed data on only one
autistic child. Hence, the results could
not yet be generalized to all cases of
autism.
However, Todd and Ciaranello
have unpublished data that they said
strongly bolsters their arguments.
Most notably, they have to date
screened the blood of 13 randomly
chosen autistic children for the ab
normal antibodies. Of the 13, seven
possessed the antibodies.
Ciaranello said he plans to screen
200 more autistic children for the an
tibodies. "What I'm hoping is that we

didn't pick the only seven kids on
earth with antibodies" that disrupt
serotonin pathways, he said.
Autism is a fairly common disor
der, afflicting approximately one out
of every 2,000 children, according to
Ciaranello. The onset of the disorder
is in early childhood, usually during
the first or second year.
"The most striking feature of
autism," said Ciaranello, "is the
aloofness, isolation and severe
withdrawal of the children."
In addition, the disease is marked
by bizarre movements — such as flap
ping or twirling the arms — and by a
failure to develop language skills, said
Ciaranello. Many autistic children
also become mentally retarded.
