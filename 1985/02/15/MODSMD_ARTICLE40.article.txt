## Foreign study praised 
### BRIAN WALSER Staff writer 
The Viennese Ball has come and
gone, but Hedi Thimig takes a little
bit of Austria with her everywhere
she goes.
Thimig, director of the University's
Vienna campus, dropped in on the
Farm last week as a guest of the Vien
nese Ball Committee. A native of
Vienna, she has been the director of
Stanford's program there since 1969.
In a Daily interview, Thimeg
praised the University's efforts to ed
ucate students through study abroad.
"Being away in a foreign country
gives you a new outlook on your own
country," Thimig said.
"That's the major reason for travel
and education in a foreign culture.
You gain an appreciation of other
people's values and can look at your
own country from a different per
spective."
After teaching for several years in
England, she went back to Austria
and, coincidentally, heard about
Stanford's efforts to expand its pres
ence there. "1 looked up a former
professor of mine who was the aca
demic director of the Stanford
campus there, and who was just ex
panding the program there. He had
an opening, and just asked when 1
could start. I just knocked at the right
time."
Commenting on the cohesiveness
of the students who have studied in
Vienna, Thimig noted that. "No
other overseas center has this kind of
devotion among returned students.
There is no Italy week or Berlin week
or Tours week. It is very unique to
have a teacher flown over to Stanford
at the students' expense. I thought
the (Viennese) Ball was a great ex
perience. It was very good."
Among possible reasons for this
cohesion, Thimig noted that there is a
great deal of contact between stu
dents and faculty. "We have one
Stanford professor each quarter, and
two German faculty members, in ad
dition to myself. Some other classes
are taught by faculty from the Uni
versity of Vienna. There is really an
intimate relationship between stu
dents and the faculty and administra
tion."
Thimig also noted the importance
of international travel in the Vienna
program. "We teach Monday morn
ing through Friday morning, so stu
dents can travel on Friday afternoon.

Saturday and Sunday. A trip to
Budapest (Hungary) can be done
very well in two days. There is also a
break of a week in the middle of the
quarter. The students this quarter
used this break to travel to Russia, to
Moscow and Leningrad and Nov
gorod." Thimig said it is easy to travel
to Warsaw Pact nations, because the
only requirement is a valid visa.
There is a great deal of contact with
native Austrians as well. Said Thimig,
"Students live in dormitories run by
foundations for University of Vienna
students. They are definitely in the
minority there, with perhaps two or

three Stanford students in a dorm
with 40 or 50 Austrians. The interac
tion is very strong, especially with a
family program in which students can
visit a Viennese family once a week."
Thimig said the people are very
helpful with students having trouble
with German, and are as often as not
likely just to switch to English. Even
so, the German preparation required
for students is very intensive. Two
quarters of classroom instruction are
mandatory, as well as a one-week in
tensive course and five course hours
of German in Viennna. Said Thimig,
"The more German a student knows,
the better."
The courses at the Vienna campus
are difficult, but not impossible. Said
Thimig, "The courses are academi
cally very good. We don't give out
Valentine A's, but our students do
very well." Still, Thimig does not

think the course selection in Vienna
will be substantially broadened. "Six
or seven classes are offered each
quarter. Since the largest group (of
students) is hardly more than 40.
there are only 12 to 15 students in
each class. I don't think that it's
economically viable to expand the
course offerings, since there simply
aren't enough students to justify it.
Students interested in taking different
classes at the University of Vienna
can do so, but only if they stay in
Vienna for both the winter and spring
quarters, since the university there
begins classes in October and ends

them in January and then runs from
March to June."
Most people go the Vienna in the
spring quarter, with the lowest num
ber coming in the fall. That interests
Thimig because she feels that fall is es
pecially attractive in Europe and
there are no differences in the course
offerings at the Vienna campus. She
suggests the fall preference may
merely be a question of logistics,
because people apparently want to be at
the main campus for fall quarter and
come to Europe and travel after
spring quarter.
Vienna's climate may help to ex
plain the unpopularity of winter quar
ter there.
Thimig stressed the importance of
travel as a broadening influence."lt is
important to get involved in a foreign
culture.
