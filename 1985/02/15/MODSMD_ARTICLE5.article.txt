# Phi Psi tries to clear debt
## 
### JULIE RYAN Editorial staff 
The resident assistant and the fin
ancial managers of the Phi Psi co-op
are currently taking action to finance
a debt of more than $10,000 the
house has accumulated since January
1984.
Former Phi Psi Financial Manager
Peter Lee has already paid back
$2,000 of $2,500 that is unaccounted
for in the debt, and efforts are being
made to collect money from former
house residents who owe up to
$2,000 each in unpaid room-and
board, according to Phi Psi RA
Nicole Moayeri.
Moayeri said she learned of the
debt from Assistant Row Director
Keith Archuleta last week. She then
scheduled a house meeting to make
people in the house aware of the
problem and to tell residents they
might each have to pay $100 to alle
viate the problem. Since then,
however, other methods of repay
ment have been planned. She said the
house is no longer considering these
emergency measures because "the
debt is under control."
Archuleta, who has been dealing
with members of the house to combat
the debt, said, "It's not that unusual
for a house to have a debt that size.
There are some other houses that
have a lot of debt." However, he said
that some of the accounting
procedures used at Phi Psi did create

"a problem that cannot be tolerated."
Current Phi Psi Financial Manager
Bill George said, "The records are
gone now, so we can't say how bad
they were. But obviously they were
bad enough so that $2,500 was
misplaced, or whatever you want to
call it."
Phi Psi's accounting problems stem
from the fact that virtually no records
can be found from the time Lee was
financial manager. "My bookkeeping
was incredibly bad," said Lee. He
said he kept a ledger and threw all the
receipts and cancelled checks in a
drawer but can no longer find them.
But George said, "What I believe
happened is one of the old residents
did something to the books so we
wouldn't know he owed us money."
Lee said, "I think maybe someone
from the Row came by and cleaned
out the cabinet. I don't think anyone
would sneak in and steal them."
This poses a problem for Lee be
cause several checks have been found
which he made out to himself. "I had
to write myself checks," he said,
"because so many people hadn't paid
last year, and when I couldn't pay
bills I had to write checks from my
own account." He said that he is
unsure about how much he paid from
his account and how much he wrote
to himself in checks.
According to George, Lee was
