# Tax proposals raise worries at Stanford

### TODD RAMMING Staff writer 
University officials have voiced
concern over three proposed plans to
simplify federal income-tax laws,
saying a revision in the current system
could affect charitable gifts to the
University.
Upon returning to work Tuesday,
Congress will resume debate on three
different tax-simplification proposals
that have surfaced on Capitol Hill.
"We're quite concerned about it
(the proposed tax revisions)," said
William Massy, vice president of
business and finance here. Massy said
he has written letters to President
Reagan and that University President
Donald Kennedy has been active in
Washington.
In danger are voluntary contribu
tions to universities, graduate fellow
ships and employer-provided
benefits, benefits that include health
plans, employer-paid tuition and pen

The proposals "could throw serious
imbalances into the funding structure
of higher education," according to a
recent National Education Associa

There is "nothing in the proposals
that specifically addresses higher edu

The proposals call for more

widespread taxation of fringe benefits
and a "broadening [of] the base of
fringe benefits," she said, making tui
tion remission, health plans and cer
tain educational expenses taxable.
Dix said graduate students who
receive fellowships in return for
teaching a class, in addition to any re
search in which they may be in
volved, would have to pay taxes on
such income, according to the new
proposals.
Of the three proposals — one
sponsored by former Treasury Secre
tary Donald Regan, the second by
Sen. Robert Kasten (R-Wis.) and
Rep. Jack Kemp (R-N.Y.), and the
third by Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.)
and Rep. Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.)
— Regan's plan has received the
widest public attention.
Four aspects of the Regan proposal
would lead to a serious cutback in
charitable giving, said Bob Smucker,
vice president for government rela
tions at Independent Sector, a group
representing philanthropic organiza
tions. A study commissioned by Inde
pendent Sector estimated that a flat
tax of 21 percent, a scheme compara
ble to the Regan plan, would reduce
annual giving by 12 percent.
Primarily, the Regan plan would
