# Tax proposals raise worries at Stanford
## 
### TODD RAMMING Staff writer 
University officials have voiced
concern over three proposed plans to
simplify federal income-tax laws,
saying a revision in the current system
could affect charitable gifts to the
University.
Upon returning to work Tuesday,
Congress will resume debate on three
different tax-simplification proposals
that have surfaced on Capitol Hill.
"We're quite concerned about it
(the proposed tax revisions)," said
William Massy, vice president of
business and finance here. Massy said
he has written letters to President
Reagan and that University President
Donald Kennedy has been active in
Washington.
In danger are voluntary contribu
tions to universities, graduate fellow
ships and employer-provided
benefits, benefits that include health
plans, employer-paid tuition and pen
sions.
The proposals "could throw serious
imbalances into the funding structure
of higher education," according to a
recent National Education Associa
tion (NEA) newsletter.
There is "nothing in the proposals
that specifically addresses higher edu
cation," said NEA lobbyist Pat Dix.
The proposals call for more

widespread taxation of fringe benefits
and a "broadening [of] the base of
fringe benefits," she said, making tui
tion remission, health plans and cer
tain educational expenses taxable.
Dix said graduate students who
receive fellowships in return for
teaching a class, in addition to any re
search in which they may be in
volved, would have to pay taxes on
such income, according to the new
proposals.
Of the three proposals — one
sponsored by former Treasury Secre
tary Donald Regan, the second by
Sen. Robert Kasten (R-Wis.) and
Rep. Jack Kemp (R-N.Y.), and the
third by Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.)
and Rep. Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.)
— Regan's plan has received the
widest public attention.
Four aspects of the Regan proposal
would lead to a serious cutback in
charitable giving, said Bob Smucker,
vice president for government rela
tions at Independent Sector, a group
representing philanthropic organiza
tions. A study commissioned by Inde
pendent Sector estimated that a flat
tax of 21 percent, a scheme compara
ble to the Regan plan, would reduce
annual giving by 12 percent.
Primarily, the Regan plan would
"increase the cost of giving,"
Smucker said.
The Regan proposal calls for a
much simpler, three-tiered tax table,
said Treasury Department
spokesperson Charles Powers. Tax
payers filing a joint return would pay
15 percent on income between
$3,800 and $31,800; 25 percent on
revenue between $31,800 and
$63,800; and 35 percent on any
amount more than $63,800, Powers
said.
When the tax rate on maximum
income is reduced from 50 percent to
35 percent, Smucker said, one gets
less back on the dollar for charitable
contributions.
In addition, in the Regan plan, con
tributions could be deducted only in
cases where they represent more than
2 percent of a taxpayer's adjusted
gross income and only when the tax
payer fills out the long 1040 form,
Smucker said.
Finally, the proposal would
"change how gifts of appreciative
property (such as stocks) would be
treated," Smucker said. Taxpayers
would be allowed to deduct a "much,
much lower" amount for donations of
appreciative property.

The Kemp-Kasten and Bradley-
Gephardt proposals would "have
similar effects" on charitable giving,
Smucker said.
Stanford received $112 million in
fiscal year 1984 in charitable gifts,
Massy said. Operating expenses for
the University were $581 million,
with $62 million provided from dona
tions.
Powers defended the Regan pro
posal as "an issue of equity and fair
ness." Currently, "people who don't
have scholarships or fellowships have
to pay (for these programs) with
income subject to taxation," he said.
"If anyone can present hard statis
tics as opposed to rhetoric, it (the
proposal) is subject to change,"
Powers said. The Office of Treasury
Policy is currently holding meetings
and will make new recommendations,
he said.
All three tax-reform proposals are
currently before the president. Once
a tax plan is approved, it will then go
officially before Congress. Dix doubts
that Congress will be able to take any
action before June 1.
Ed Gonzalez, editor of the NEA
newsletter, said he expects the final
tax bill to be a "melange of all three"
proposals. The influence of the
higher education lobby should be
"pretty strong," Gonzales said. "We
have a lot of grass-roots support."
