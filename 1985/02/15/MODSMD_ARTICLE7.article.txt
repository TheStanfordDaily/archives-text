"We've got our gloves on and we're going
to do battle." say Stanford Medical Center
officials preparing to fight President
Reagan's proposed freezes in Medicare.
Officials at the medical center say they tear
that if enacted, the proposed freezes,
combined with below-cost levels of MediCal
reimbursement, will damage the University's
ability to fulfill its commitment to the com
munity and to medical students.
Reagan's budget proposal, released to
Congress Feb. 4, calls for a reduction of more
than $4 billion in outlays for Medicare, the
federal health care program for the elderly.
The reduction would include a freeze in
reimbursement rates to, all hospitals and
would cut in half compensation for varying
degrees of degrees of illness in patients.
"This is a major issue for Stanford Univer
sity Medical Center," said David Sakai.
director of finance for the hospital.

Medicare accounts for 36 percent of Stan
ford's patient costs, and MediCal, the state
program for indigent health care, accounts
for approximately 10 percei
University President Donald Kennedy
said, "The threat that the university medical

"and then expect the university hospitals to
take on the load of managing the severe ill

Sakai said officials at Stanford "are going
to be making a lot of efforts" by working
with other hospitals in the American Hospi
tal Association (AHA) and the California
Hospital Association to fight the proposed
freezes in Medicare funds. In addition. Stan
ford is a member of lobbying groups for uni
versity and teaching hospitals and will be
working with those groups to dissuade mem

bers of Congress from voting for proposed
reductions that would affect teaching hospi
tals most heavily.
Kennedy said Stanford officials will also
continue to press for an increase in MediCal
payments to match inflation.
Until 1983, MediCal reimbursed hospitals
according to cost, but reimbursement is now
set at a daily rate determined each year in
negotiations between individual hospitals
and the California Department of Health.
Stanford's contract for fiscal 1986, which
Sakai described as "barely adequate," is ex
pected to be approved by the California
MediCal Commission on March 6. The
negotiated rate is confidential, but last year's
contract paid 20 to 30 percent less than cost,
and each year the rate has increased less than
inflation, he said.
"We're going to put the MediCal contract
ing agency on notice that much more of this,
