# Med center protests cuts

### LYNN MARCUS Staff writer 
"We've got our gloves on and we're going
to do battle." say Stanford Medical Center
officials preparing to fight President
Reagan's proposed freezes in Medicare.
Officials at the medical center say they tear
that if enacted, the proposed freezes,
combined with below-cost levels of MediCal
reimbursement, will damage the University's
ability to fulfill its commitment to the com
munity and to medical students.
Reagan's budget proposal, released to
Congress Feb. 4, calls for a reduction of more
than $4 billion in outlays for Medicare, the
federal health care program for the elderly.
The reduction would include a freeze in
reimbursement rates to, all hospitals and
would cut in half compensation for varying
degrees of degrees of illness in patients.
"This is a major issue for Stanford Univer
sity Medical Center," said David Sakai.
director of finance for the hospital.

Medicare accounts for 36 percent of Stan
ford's patient costs, and MediCal, the state
program for indigent health care, accounts
for approximately 10 percei
University President Donald Kennedy
said, "The threat that the university medical
centers face is from a set of policies that fa
vor cost competition " for basic medical care
"and then expect the university hospitals to
take on the load of managing the severe ill
nesses, predominantly in charity patients,
without adequate reimbursement."
"That is a financial formula to kill the uni
versity medical centers," Kennedy said.
Sakai said officials at Stanford "are going
to be making a lot of efforts" by working
with other hospitals in the American Hospi
tal Association (AHA) and the California
Hospital Association to fight the proposed
freezes in Medicare funds. In addition. Stan
ford is a member of lobbying groups for uni
versity and teaching hospitals and will be
working with those groups to dissuade mem

bers of Congress from voting for proposed
reductions that would affect teaching hospi
tals most heavily.
Kennedy said Stanford officials will also
continue to press for an increase in MediCal
payments to match inflation.
Until 1983, MediCal reimbursed hospitals
according to cost, but reimbursement is now
set at a daily rate determined each year in
negotiations between individual hospitals
and the California Department of Health.
Stanford's contract for fiscal 1986, which
Sakai described as "barely adequate," is ex
pected to be approved by the California
MediCal Commission on March 6. The
negotiated rate is confidential, but last year's
contract paid 20 to 30 percent less than cost,
and each year the rate has increased less than
inflation, he said.
"We're going to put the MediCal contract
ing agency on notice that much more of this,

and we're really going to have to get
out," Kennedy said. He stressed,
however, that Stanford is committed
to "socially beneficial care."
"It's not reasonable for those
agencies to expect to continue to shift
costs away from those (non-paying)
patients onto the patients who are
either paying for their own health
care or are insured by private third
parties, and that is the effect of
under-reimbursement," Kennedy
said.
Sakai said that because of cost
shifting in the past, ongoing cost re
duction measures begun in 1981 and
a build-up of reserves in preparation
for a project of hospital moderniza
tion which began last year, the hospi
tal has managed to avoid running
over budget.
Hospital administrators said,
however, that Stanford's budget
would be unable to accommodate
continued under-reimbursement
from Medicare and MediCal.
The effect of Reagan's proposals,
when combined with the losses Stan
ford expects to incur due to a "barely
adequate" contract recently
negotiated with MediCal, would be
"reprehensible," Sakai said.
"Stanford just wouldn't be able to
fulfill its mission — its obligation to
teaching, research, and service to the
community."
Sheldon King, executive director of
the hospital, said the proposed cuts in
Medicare and the under
reimbursement by MediCal signals
that the country is "returning to two
tiered care — one standard for the
poor" and another for those able to
pay. "It (the double standard) was
reduced somewhat under Medicare
and Medicaid, but not completely,"
he said.

Sakai said teaching hospitals such
as Stanford would be especially af
fected by a cut in the Medicare reim
bursement rates that adjust for
severity of illness because such hospi
tals generally treat patients whose
conditions are more severe and who
cost more to treat. Stanford ranks
among the highest in the nation on a
Medicare index that rates severity of
illnesses treated. Many patients with
acute health problems are referred
here.
Stanford would be among the
hospitals receiving a "double
wammy" under the proposed freezes
because Stanford not only treats
more severe patients, but is in a
region with higher costs than the na
tional average, Sakai said.
By proposing a freeze in reim
bursements rather than adjusting for
inflation, he said, "what the president
is doing is reneging" on a promise
made regarding the Prospective Pay
ment System, an administration
backed program implemented in
1983.
The program, designed to provide
hospitals with incentives to reduce
costs, bases reimbursement to hospi
tals on a set rate predetermined for
each specific illness category, or
Diagnostically Related Grouping
(DRG).
According to King, the impact of
the proposed freezes on Stanford
would be moderated if the DRG costs
were determined according to a rate
that weighted hospital-specific costs
and nationally averaged costs
equally. Under the Prospective Pay
ment System, however, DRGs will be
weighted 75 percent on national
average in a hospital's third year of
the program and 100 percent the fol
lowing year.
Stanford has been less affected in
the past because it is only in the first
year of the new program, but will be
more strongly affected in the future

under the Prospective Payment Sys
tem because reimbursements will be
more determined by average national
costs.
If DRG costs are frozen at
nationally averaged levels and the
percentage of the costs that
recognizes severity is reduced as pro
posed, "We will have problems,"
King said.
King, soon to begin a term as chair
man of the Council of Teaching
Hospitals of the AHA, said that by
proposing plans that would have par
ticular impact on teaching hospitals,
the government is demonstrating its
willingness to "consider removing it
self from covering the costs of
graduate medical education" at a cost
to teaching hospitals of "several mil
lion dollars."
King said such a move could have
severe consequences. "I think you'll
begin to see a return to the time when
minorities and low-income students
could not get near medical school."
King said that both the lobbies for
teaching hospitals and for hospital
trade groups will be working to
"persuade Congress rather than the
president" and that "the hospital in
dustry, for the most part, will present
a united front."
"I think it's reasonable to expect
the health care industry has to con
tribute to a reduction of the national
debt, but we may find Congress sym
pathetic to more equity in the way the
reductions take place," King said.
King said he is optimistic that if a
freeze in Medicare payents is "more
equitably determined," Stanford
Hospital will be able to preserve the
quality of care, teaching and research
by continuing current projects on cost
reduction and improved marketing.
But Sakai cautions against
"sending out an alarm" on the pro
posed cuts.

continue to press for an increase in MediCal
payments to match inflation.
Until 1983, MediCal reimbursed hospitals
according to cost, but reimbursement is now
set at a daily rate determined each year in
negotiations between individual hospitals
and the California Department of Health.
Stanford's contract for fiscal 1986, which
Sakai described as "barely adequate," is ex
pected to be approved by the California
MediCal Commission on March 6. The
negotiated rate is confidential, but last year's
contract paid 20 to 30 percent less than cost,
and each year the rate has increased less than
inflation, he said.
"We're going to put the MediCal contract
ing agency on notice that much more of this,

and we're really going to have to get
out," Kennedy said. He stressed,
however, that Stanford is committed
to "socially beneficial care."
"It's not reasonable for those
agencies to expect to continue to shift
costs away from those (non-paying)
patients onto the patients who are
either paying for their own health
care or are insured by private third
parties, and that is the effect of
under-reimbursement," Kennedy
said.
Sakai said that because of cost
shifting in the past, ongoing cost re
duction measures begun in 1981 and
a build-up of reserves in preparation
for a project of hospital moderniza
tion which began last year, the hospi
tal has managed to avoid running
over budget.
Hospital administrators said,
however, that Stanford's budget
would be unable to accommodate
continued under-reimbursement
from Medicare and MediCal.
The effect of Reagan's proposals,
when combined with the losses Stan
ford expects to incur due to a "barely
adequate" contract recently
negotiated with MediCal, would be
"reprehensible," Sakai said.
"Stanford just wouldn't be able to
fulfill its mission — its obligation to
teaching, research, and service to the
community."
Sheldon King, executive director of
the hospital, said the proposed cuts in
Medicare and the under
reimbursement by MediCal signals
that the country is "returning to two
tiered care — one standard for the
poor" and another for those able to
pay. "It (the double standard) was
reduced somewhat under Medicare
and Medicaid, but not completely,"
he said.

Sakai said teaching hospitals such
as Stanford would be especially af
fected by a cut in the Medicare reim
bursement rates that adjust for
severity of illness because such hospi
tals generally treat patients whose
conditions are more severe and who
cost more to treat. Stanford ranks
among the highest in the nation on a
Medicare index that rates severity of
illnesses treated. Many patients with
acute health problems are referred
here.
Stanford would be among the
hospitals receiving a "double
wammy" under the proposed freezes
because Stanford not only treats
more severe patients, but is in a
region with higher costs than the na
tional average, Sakai said.
By proposing a freeze in reim
bursements rather than adjusting for
inflation, he said, "what the president
is doing is reneging" on a promise
made regarding the Prospective Pay
ment System, an administration
backed program implemented in
1983.
The program, designed to provide
hospitals with incentives to reduce
costs, bases reimbursement to hospi
tals on a set rate predetermined for
each specific illness category, or
Diagnostically Related Grouping
(DRG).
According to King, the impact of
the proposed freezes on Stanford
would be moderated if the DRG costs
were determined according to a rate
that weighted hospital-specific costs
and nationally averaged costs
equally. Under the Prospective Pay
ment System, however, DRGs will be
weighted 75 percent on national
average in a hospital's third year of
the program and 100 percent the fol
lowing year.
Stanford has been less affected in
the past because it is only in the first
year of the new program, but will be
more strongly affected in the future

under the Prospective Payment Sys
tem because reimbursements will be
more determined by average national
costs.
If DRG costs are frozen at
nationally averaged levels and the
percentage of the costs that
recognizes severity is reduced as pro
posed, "We will have problems,"
King said.
King, soon to begin a term as chair
man of the Council of Teaching
Hospitals of the AHA, said that by
proposing plans that would have par
ticular impact on teaching hospitals,
the government is demonstrating its
willingness to "consider removing it
self from covering the costs of
graduate medical education" at a cost
to teaching hospitals of "several mil
lion dollars."
King said such a move could have
severe consequences. "I think you'll
begin to see a return to the time when
minorities and low-income students
could not get near medical school."
King said that both the lobbies for
teaching hospitals and for hospital
trade groups will be working to
"persuade Congress rather than the
president" and that "the hospital in
dustry, for the most part, will present
a united front."
"I think it's reasonable to expect
the health care industry has to con
tribute to a reduction of the national
debt, but we may find Congress sym
pathetic to more equity in the way the
reductions take place," King said.
King said he is optimistic that if a
freeze in Medicare payents is "more
equitably determined," Stanford
Hospital will be able to preserve the
quality of care, teaching and research
by continuing current projects on cost
reduction and improved marketing.
But Sakai cautions against
"sending out an alarm" on the pro
posed cuts.
"We've got our gloves on and we're going
to do battle." say Stanford Medical Center
officials preparing to fight President
Reagan's proposed freezes in Medicare.
Officials at the medical center say they tear
that if enacted, the proposed freezes,
combined with below-cost levels of MediCal
reimbursement, will damage the University's
ability to fulfill its commitment to the com
munity and to medical students.
Reagan's budget proposal, released to
Congress Feb. 4, calls for a reduction of more
than $4 billion in outlays for Medicare, the
federal health care program for the elderly.
The reduction would include a freeze in
reimbursement rates to, all hospitals and
would cut in half compensation for varying
degrees of degrees of illness in patients.
"This is a major issue for Stanford Univer
sity Medical Center," said David Sakai.
director of finance for the hospital.

University President Donald Kennedy
said, "The threat that the university medical
centers face is from a set of policies that fa
vor cost competition " for basic medical care
"and then expect the university hospitals to
take on the load of managing the severe ill
nesses, predominantly in charity patients,
without adequate reimbursement."
"That is a financial formula to kill the uni
versity medical centers," Kennedy said.
Sakai said officials at Stanford "are going
to be making a lot of efforts" by working
with other hospitals in the American Hospi
tal Association (AHA) and the California
Hospital Association to fight the proposed
freezes in Medicare funds. In addition. Stan
ford is a member of lobbying groups for uni

working with those groups to dissuade mem
