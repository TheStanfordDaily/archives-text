Israel razes guerrilla storehouses
SI DON, LEBANON— Israeli soldiers rolled into a south Lebanon
village yesterday, pushed French U.N. peacekeeping troops aside and
bulldozed four buildings they claimed were guerrilla weapon
storehouses, United Nations officials reported.
Sources in the area, who spoke on condition they not be identified,
said the Israelis knocked down three houses and a Shiite Moslem civic
center and arrested more than 60 villagers during an eight-hour occupa
tion of Bourj Rajal Shiite guerrillas make frequent raids on Israeli forces
in the area.
Israeli military sources in Tel Aviv, Israel, said one man was killed in
the raid, and reporters said two villagers were wounded. The sources
would speak only on condition of anonymity.
The Israeli military command in Tel Aviv reported that elsewhere in
south Lebanon yesterday, Israelis killed 11 guerrillas and captured nine
in one encounter.
Israeli troops in about 20 armored personnel carriers and trucks en
tered Bourj Rahal at about 7 a.m.
Timur Goksel, spokesman for the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon,
said French peacekeeping troops tried to prevent destruction of the
houses and the Husseiniyeh cultural center in the village northwest of
Tyre, a port city in Israeli-occupied territory.
Goksel said the Israelis claimed the buildings contained weapons and
explosives. Israeli forces frequently raze buildings they suspect are being
used for arms storage.
The U.N. force, known as UNIFIL, has been in place since Israeli
forces withdrew in June 1978 after their first invasion of southern
Lebanon in pursuit of Palestinian guerrillas, which lasted three months,
Israel invaded again in June 1982 and now is in the first phase of a three
stage withdrawal. )
Sources said an Israeli foot patrol- came under small-arms fire near
Bourj Rahal yesterday, and at least three rocket-propelled grenade at
tacks were reported in the area.
Shiite leaders have pledged the attacks will increase until Israel ends
the occupation.
Walesa plans nationwide strike
WARSAW — Solidarity founder Lech Walesa said he met secretly
with a second group of union activists yesterday to discuss strategy for a
15-minute nationwide strike to protest proposed food price increases.
Police broke up a similar meeting of leadens of the outlawed labor fed
eration Wednesday in Gdansk and detained seven senior Solidarity ac
tivists, but released Walesa.
"I had another meeting of this kind since the morning, which was ap
parently successful," Walesa told The Associated Press when contacted
by telephone at his Gdansk apartment.
He declined to identify the participants or say where they met, but
said they discussed ways to ''promote" his appeal to Polish workers to
join the protest actions planned for Feb. 28.
The strike call is the first by the Solidarity leadership in two years.
Walesa proposed in a statement released yesterday that workers
either stop work for 15 minutes and talk with management on Feb. 28,
or write letters to Poland' , Communist leaders demanding union
freedoms, the release of political prisoners and measures to "stop the
disastrous decline in the living standards fo working people."
"The point is not to cause economic losses or an escalation of ten
sions," the statement said. "The point is that with the solidarity of every
enterprise we will confirm that we will not give up the gains of August
(1980)."
The August 1980 strikes began as a protest over food price hikes and
led to the birth of Solidarity, the only independent labor federation in
the Communist bloc. The government imposed martial law and crushed
the union 16 months later, and the Polish Parliament outlawed it in Oc
tober 1982.
Walesa's statement was read over the telephone by an aide, Bosdan
Olszewski, who added that the activists at yesterday's meeting had ex
- pressed "unanimous support" for Walesa's appeal.
The police raid Wednesday appeared to reflect official concern over
public reaction to the increases in the prices of government controlled
commodities, planned for March. Similar increases in 1970, 1976 and
1980 triggered widespread protests.
Soviets donate refunds to UNESCO
PARIS — The Soviet Union and other nations said yesterday they will
give up about $6 million in refunds from a special UNESCO fund to ease
the financial loss caused by the pullout of the United States, which had
provided one quarter of the agency's budget.
France, UNESCO's host country, announced Wednesday that it
would make a special payment of $2 million. The agency lost an annual
contribution of $43 million when the United States withdrew at the end
of last year.
Director-General Amadou Mahtar M'Bowsaid UNESCO must make
up a $28 million deficit because of the U.S. withdrawl.
Indian delegate T.N. Kaul said yesterday that the U.S. action and
threats by some other members to follow Washington's lead put the
entire U.N. system into serious jeopardy.
Critic nations say the agency is mismanaged, politicized and fiscally
extravagant.
"We are face with a situation that must change for the better or
destroy the twin pillars of international cooperation on which UNESCO
in particular and the U.N. system in general is founded," Kaul said.
He told a meeting of the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Or
ganization's executive board that there is no alternative to UNESCO
and the United Nations "in the interdependent thermonuclear world of
today."
"Let us not destroy the system we have built up for the last 40 years
and try to rebuild it on the ashes of what may survive," he said.
Soviets rap 'Star Wars' research
GENEV A, Switzerland — A top Soviet disarmament official said yes
terday that further American research on the "Star Wars" space defense
program would "certainly torpedo" U.S.-Soviet arms control negotia
tions.
v "If the Americans press us to negotiate on (other weapons) and go
ahead with research and elaboration on the so-called Star Wars it would
certainly torpedo the negotiations," said Viktor lssraelyan. the chief So
viet delegate to the Geneva disarmament conference.
lssraelyan also told reporters there "won't be any chemical weapons
agreement in 1985" in the United Stated sticks to a draft treaty pro
posed last April by Vice President George Bush.
Discussing the Strategic Defense Initiative, popularly termed "Star
Wars," lssraelyan reitereated that Secretary of State George Shultz and
Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko agreed in January that one
goal of the coming bilateral arms talks was to avoid an arms race in outer
space.
"Why should a party to the negotiations spend billions on research to
construct such weapons in outer space?" he said.
President Reagan said earlier this week he was going forward with the
Star Wars program even if the superpowers came to an agreement on
limiting offensive nuclear weapons. The government plans to spend $26
billion in exploratory research on the plan.
The Geneva conference, which begins March 12, is the world's only
multilateral disarmament forum. Geneva arms talks have been dead
locked for more than a decade on the question of a chemical weapons
ban because of disputes on verification and endorsement.
Meanwhile, in other arms negotiations in Vienna, a Western spokes
man welcomed a revised plan by the Soviet Union, East Germany,
Poland and Czechoslovakia calling for a reduction of 20,000 Soviet and
13,000 U.S. ground forces within a year of reaching a troop-reduction
agreement.
Western diplomats in Moscow also said the Soviets previously made
the offer and that yesterday's move formally submits it to the East-West
talks being held in Vienna.
In a related move, a top Swiss Foreign Ministry official in Lausanne
proposed that Switzerland and other neutral European nations monitor
Soviet and U.S. compliance with arms-control treaties.
