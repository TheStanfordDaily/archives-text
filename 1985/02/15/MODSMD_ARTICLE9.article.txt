### 
DAMASCUS, Syria — U.S. journalist Jeremy
Levin, kidnapped 11 months ago in Beirut, escaped
yesterday in apparent good health and will be
turned over to the U.S. ambassador, the Syrian
government said.
The official Syrian News Agency reported late
yesterday that Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa
summoned U.S. Ambassador William Eagleton
and told him Levin had managed to escape from his
captors in Lebanon and would be turned over to
the ambassador this morning at the Foreign Mini
stry in Damascus.
The official report said Levin "escaped and
arrived at a Syrian army position in Lebanon," but
did not elaborate.
Earlier, the Syrian government had said it won
Levin's release through negotiations, but Levin —
the Beirut bureau chief for Cable News Network —
was quoted as saying he fled from his captors and
walked for two hours.
"He looks beautiful," Levin's wife, Lucille, said
in Washington after she was shown a news photo
graph of her husband with a beard, rumpled hair
and a bewildered look on his face.
The Syrian ambassador in Washington, Rafic
Jouejati, said the reporter had been examined at a
medical center in Damascus and found to be well.
But AFP, the French news agency, quoted Levin
as saying he could not identify who held him or say
exactly how he escaped.
"I fled toward midnight from the two-story villa

where I was being held," he was quoted. "I walked
for two hours before hearing a dog and human
voices.
"1 thought my kidnappers were at my heels so 1
hid under a truck. But when I saw it was Syrian sol
diers, 1 gave myself up," he said.
Levin, 51, disappeared March 7, 1984. Accord
ing to the AFP interview, he said he was captured
by a lone gunman about 20-years-old.
White House spokesman Larry Speakes said in
Santa Barbara, where President Reagan is
vacationing, that the U.S. Embassy in Damascus
had been informed by the Syrian government that
Levin "is in Syrian hands and is safe in Damascus."
"We are certainly pleased that he has been
released," Speakes said.
Speakes said there is no word about four other
Americans who have been missing in Lebanon.
In an interview with The Associated Press three
weeks ago, Reagan was asked about his silence in
regard to the five Americans.
"This is a situation which for the safety of those
individuals in mind, doesn't mean we're sitting
doing nothing," Reagan said then. "It just means it
isn't something that we should be talking about."
The president said, "You have to recognize that
you aren't dealing with a government; you're
dealing with some personages."
F.d Turner, CNN executive vice president, said in
Atlanta, "The White House has authorized an Air
Force plane to fly Mrs. Levin and members of the
family to a rendezvous point (in Europe) with Jerry

... We hope all that happens within the next dozen
hours."
Reports were that Levin showed up at a Syrian
army installation in the eastern Lebanese city of
Baalbeck about 2 a.m.
A man claiming to represent the shadow ex
tremist group Islamic Holy War said in a telephone
call to a Western news agency in Beirut that "the
truth of the matter is that we released ... Levin
after many approaches by some brotherly and ef
fective sides."
Col. Kasem Mohammed Kasem, a Syrian officer,
said Levin was first taken to Syrian army intelli
gence headquarters in Lebanon, at Anjar near
Baalbek.
He also suggested Levin may have been released
as part of a deal, using the expression "a thing for a
thing."
He would only say: "It has political im
plicaitons."
The Syrian source said military police found
Levin hiding near a truck, interrogated him, and
then turned him over to intelligence officers in
Baalbek.
Baalbek, besides having a large Syrian army
camp, also is headquarters for several radical Shiite
Moslem groups.
Islamic Holy War, believed made up of Shiite
Moslems loyal to Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, has claimed responsibility for a long se
ries of violent attacks.

call to a Western news agency in Beirut that "the
truth of the matter is that we released ... Levin
after many approaches by some brotherly and ef
fective sides."
Col. Kasem Mohammed Kasem, a Syrian officer,
said Levin was first taken to Syrian army intelli
gence headquarters in Lebanon, at Anjar near
Baalbek.
He also suggested Levin may have been released
as part of a deal, using the expression "a thing for a
thing."
He would only say: "It has political im
plicaitons."
The Syrian source said military police found
Levin hiding near a truck, interrogated him, and
then turned him over to intelligence officers in
Baalbek.
Baalbek, besides having a large Syrian army
camp, also is headquarters for several radical Shiite
Moslem groups.
Islamic Holy War, believed made up of Shiite
Moslems loyal to Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, has claimed responsibility for a long se
ries of violent attacks.
