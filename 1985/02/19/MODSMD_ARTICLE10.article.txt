Boat accidents claim 12
SAN FRANCISCO — The death toll from
weekend boating and swimming accidents along
the Northern California coast climbed to 12 yes
terday as officials recovered another body and
called off the search for three missing people.
The U.S. Coast Guard originally reported
eight dead, four missing and six hurt after Satur
day's boating and swimming accidents from
Monterey to San Francisco.
Fire hits Cal ROTC hall
BERKELEY — Authorities searched yester
day for the cause of a pre-dawn. $2 million fire
that destroyed historic Callaghan Hall, home to
ROTC programs on the UC-Berkeley campus
and a popular target for anti-war protesters of
the 1960s and '70s.
About 28 firefighters responding to a 3:20
a.m. call spent an hour battling the fire, which
destroyed the building. No one was injured.
"We don't know if it's arson. The cause is still
unknown," university spokesman Ray Colvig
said. Police said they have no suspects in the fire.
The fire quickly enveloped the 40-year-old,
two-story wooden structure named after Admiral
Daniel Callaghan, who was killed aboard the
cruiser USS San Francisco in the World War II
battle of the Solomon Islands.
The building housed the offices and classrooms
of the school's Air Force and Navy programs.
The Army facilities are in another building.
The UC naval ROTC program was started in
1926 by Chester Nimitz, later a World War II
fleet admiral. The program was the first of its
kind in the United States, Colvig said.

"I am distressed by the loss of classrooms and
of mementos from the career of Adm. Nimitz,"
Vice Chancellor Roderic Park said.
During the 19705, Callaghan Hall was a favor
ite target of Vietnam War demonstrators.
Several attempts were made to destroy the
building during anti-war protests, and as recently
as December, an incendiary device that failed to
go off was found behind the hall, Colvig said.
An odd Coke machine
HAWTHORNE — Five Cuban refugees were
arrested while trying to break into a Coca-Cola
machine where $20,000 in cocaine had become
trapped when it was put into the wrong slot in an
apparent drug deal, police said yesterday.
Police Sgt. John Beerling said the drugs were
to have been hidden in the section of the machine
where the cans drop down, so that the cocaine
could be easily retrieved by the buyer.
But, he said, someone stuck the package into
another slot and it fell inside the machine at an
auto body repair shop. That touched off three at
tempts Sunday to break into the soft-drink ma
chine, Beerling said.
Each time, police were called by neighbors.
The first time, the would-be burglars were gone
by the time police arrived, but the shop's owner
was called and opened the machine, and police
found the cocaine, which Beerling said was worth
about $20,000.
About two hours later, at 7.30 a.m., police ar
rested two men they said were trying to break
into the machine. Three men were arrested
during another break-in attempt three hours
later.
Beerling said the men, all Cubans, had been

booked for investigation of tampering with the
machine and investigation of conspiring to pos
sess cocaine for sale.
Big money at book fair
SAN FRANCISCO — This weekend's Anti
quarian Bookfair drew 6,200 book lovers and
grossed $1.4 million — but at those prices,
nobody was surprised.
A first-issue Latin treatise by Copernicus was
selling for $65,000. A volume illustrated by
Georges Braque had a $42,500 price tag. For
bargain hunters, there was a hard-cover first edi
tion of Frank Herbert's "Dune" for $550.
"Quite reasonable, actually," remarked finan
cial analyst Bob Dyer, who found much of the
fair's wares "a little overpriced."
But that didn t stop book lovers during three
days of browsing and buying among the 129 book
dealers who came from across the United States,
as well as Sweden, Great Britain, Australia and
France.
Los Angeles booksellers Zeitlin & ver Brugge
offered the Copernicus work, dated 1543, which
demonstrated the Earth moves around the sun.
Today's weather
It will be sunny in the Stanford area today after
a few patches of morning fog or low clouds; highs
will range from the mid 60s to mid 70s. Winds
will be light. Patchy night and morning fog or low
clouds will give way to Sunshine tomorrow. To
morrow night's lows will be in the 40s to 50s;
highs will be in the 60s to mid 70s.

Fire hits Cal ROTC hall
BERKELEY — Authorities searched yester
day for the cause of a pre-dawn. $2 million fire
that destroyed historic Callaghan Hall, home to
ROTC programs on the UC-Berkeley campus
and a popular target for anti-war protesters of
the 1960s and '70s.
About 28 firefighters responding to a 3:20
a.m. call spent an hour battling the fire, which
destroyed the building. No one was injured.
"We don't know if it's arson. The cause is still
unknown," university spokesman Ray Colvig
said. Police said they have no suspects in the fire.
The fire quickly enveloped the 40-year-old,
two-story wooden structure named after Admiral
Daniel Callaghan, who was killed aboard the
cruiser USS San Francisco in the World War II
battle of the Solomon Islands.
The building housed the offices and classrooms
of the school's Air Force and Navy programs.
The Army facilities are in another building.
The UC naval ROTC program was started in
1926 by Chester Nimitz, later a World War II
fleet admiral. The program was the first of its
kind in the United States, Colvig said.

"I am distressed by the loss of classrooms and
of mementos from the career of Adm. Nimitz,"
Vice Chancellor Roderic Park said.
During the 19705, Callaghan Hall was a favor
ite target of Vietnam War demonstrators.
Several attempts were made to destroy the
building during anti-war protests, and as recently
as December, an incendiary device that failed to
go off was found behind the hall, Colvig said.
An odd Coke machine
HAWTHORNE — Five Cuban refugees were
arrested while trying to break into a Coca-Cola
machine where $20,000 in cocaine had become
trapped when it was put into the wrong slot in an
apparent drug deal, police said yesterday.
Police Sgt. John Beerling said the drugs were
to have been hidden in the section of the machine
where the cans drop down, so that the cocaine
could be easily retrieved by the buyer.
But, he said, someone stuck the package into
another slot and it fell inside the machine at an
auto body repair shop. That touched off three at
tempts Sunday to break into the soft-drink ma
chine, Beerling said.
Each time, police were called by neighbors.
The first time, the would-be burglars were gone
by the time police arrived, but the shop's owner
was called and opened the machine, and police
found the cocaine, which Beerling said was worth
about $20,000.
About two hours later, at 7.30 a.m., police ar
rested two men they said were trying to break
into the machine. Three men were arrested
during another break-in attempt three hours
later.
Beerling said the men, all Cubans, had been

booked for investigation of tampering with the
machine and investigation of conspiring to pos
sess cocaine for sale.
Big money at book fair
SAN FRANCISCO — This weekend's Anti
quarian Bookfair drew 6,200 book lovers and
grossed $1.4 million — but at those prices,
nobody was surprised.
A first-issue Latin treatise by Copernicus was
selling for $65,000. A volume illustrated by
Georges Braque had a $42,500 price tag. For
bargain hunters, there was a hard-cover first edi
tion of Frank Herbert's "Dune" for $550.
