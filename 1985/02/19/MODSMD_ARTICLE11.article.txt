## Bugging The Times 
### 
Dear Bug Me.

How much do those little two-line
personal ads on the front pug t of The
New York Time. t? Can anyone
buy one? How much does a full-page
ad cost? Which one - the little two
liner or the full-page ad - is the better
buy when you work it all out? - Tim.
It's so nice of my editor to fill an
inch of column space with his ques
tion alone. To be equally thorough
with my answer (and to keep my
Daily job), I called the friendly classi
fied number of everyone's favorite
journalistic institution.
1 don t think The Times was run
ning any Washington's Birthday
sales. It's $200 for a line on the front
page, and you've got to buy at least
two lines. For some reason, these ads
run for 13 weeks at a time.
If you're willing to settle for two
lines on the classified pages for three
days, it will put you back $100,
As for the tull-page ad, buying one
of the nine columns on a classified
page costs slightly more than spend
ing a year at Stanford including tui
tion, air fare and incidental expenses.
I he whole cost of a page would buy a
handful of doctorates.
This is easy enough to figure out. A
line costs $49.20. There are 14 lines
in an inch. A column is 20 inches
long. That's a grand total of $13,776
for one column, at least in my fuzzy
minded view of math.
Not that the full-page rate could
possibly be different than the per-line
rate, but that's the best I could do.
Just to add perspective. The Daily
charges students $2.50 a line. It has a
circulation of 15,000. The New York
Times circulates 850,000 newspapers
every weekday.
If anyone wants to buy an ad that
will reach an audience that large, the
number to call is 1-800-223-7437.
Why is the Claw culled the Claw? -
Shirley Wang.
According to Art Prof. Albert El
sen, the Claw is called the Claw be
cause students call it the Claw. Say
that five times fast.
He couldn't remember its real title,
but the artist was someone named

Demetrios from San Francisco.
"I'm amused by student names for
things like the Claw and Mem Aud,"
Elsen said. "It's a term of affection
and not necessarily of derision."
When asked, most people seemed
surprised that its name should be
questioned. "That's what it looks
like," was all one passerby would say.

Does anyone ever try to collect on
parking tickets issued by Stanford
Police that are unpaid? If so, what can
they do to me? - an anonymous law
student.
Are you talking about the horrible
possibility that University public ser
vants aren't getting their paychecks
or are you admitting you committed a
parking violation? Since I'm not a law
student, I can assume guilt and an
swer the latter.
The regular fee for parking in a red
zone or a permit area is $10. If you
don't pay before the deadline, this fee
goes up. The amount depends on how
long you wait and what the original
violation was.
They can "do" more than this to
you if you are a California resident.
In this case, you're in a marvelous
new computer system that can
prevent you from renewing your
license or registering any new
vehicles.
In 1979, the University paid com
munity service officers to write more
than $44,000 worth of parking cita
tions on campus. Their salaries come
out of the parking permit fees for A
and C lots. The revenue from their
work went to county government.
Either way, students pay to park

legally or illegally. The difference is
in where the money goes. I'm sorry if
that's not the way a law student
would be expected to analyze the sit
uation. But then, I don't have a
ticket, I have a permit. Big difference.
Why is Filipino spelled with an "F
and Philippines is spelled with a
"Ph"? It's been a real source of stress
in my life! - A . B.
Do I detect sarcasm, or have you
really lived a life without mid-terms,
parking tickets and other stressful
crises?
According to Linguistics Prot.
Charles Ferguson, the source of your
anxiety has a historical explanation.
Filipino is the older of the two
words. It is the Spanish spelling left
over from when the Spaniards con
trolled the Philippines, which is the
English spelling, from when the En
glish took over.
Filipino is used to describe the
people of these islands, while
Philippines is the word for the name
of the country.
Actually, the national language is
Tagalog, which is spoken in its pure
form in Manila. But it is called
Pilipino so all the non-Manilan
Filipinos will not be offended by the
way they must speak, if not by the
spellings of individual words.
Who picks the movies for Sunday
Flicks? - Velina Underwood
The ASSU, in the person of Randy
Schwartz, is responsible for your
viewing pleasure.
According to Schwartz, his per
sonal preferences for movies have
little to do with what is shown. His
criteria as to what is shown is a
movie's availability, its nationwide
box-office reports of audience
preferences, the surveys he passes out
to Stanford students and the newest
releases he can find.
For this quarter's lineup, Schwartz,
distributed about 75 surveys to
people waiting in line at the Flicks
and to 40 ASSU officials, asking for
nine choices from each out of a list of
20.

"I'm amused by student names for
things like the Claw and Mem Aud,"
Elsen said. "It's a term of affection
and not necessarily of derision."
When asked, most people seemed
surprised that its name should be
questioned. "That's what it looks
like," was all one passerby would say.

Does anyone ever try to collect on
parking tickets issued by Stanford
Police that are unpaid? If so, what can
they do to me? - an anonymous law
student.
Are you talking about the horrible
possibility that University public ser
vants aren't getting their paychecks
or are you admitting you committed a
parking violation? Since I'm not a law
student, I can assume guilt and an
swer the latter.
The regular fee for parking in a red
zone or a permit area is $10. If you
don't pay before the deadline, this fee
goes up. The amount depends on how
long you wait and what the original
violation was.
They can "do" more than this to
you if you are a California resident.
In this case, you're in a marvelous
new computer system that can
prevent you from renewing your
license or registering any new
vehicles.
In 1979, the University paid com
munity service officers to write more
than $44,000 worth of parking cita
tions on campus. Their salaries come
out of the parking permit fees for A
and C lots. The revenue from their
work went to county government.
Either way, students pay to park

legally or illegally. The difference is
in where the money goes. I'm sorry if
that's not the way a law student
would be expected to analyze the sit
uation. But then, I don't have a
ticket, I have a permit. Big difference.
Why is Filipino spelled with an "F
and Philippines is spelled with a
"Ph"? It's been a real source of stress
in my life! - A . B.
Do I detect sarcasm, or have you
really lived a life without mid-terms,
parking tickets and other stressful
crises?
According to Linguistics Prot.
Charles Ferguson, the source of your
anxiety has a historical explanation.
Filipino is the older of the two
words. It is the Spanish spelling left
over from when the Spaniards con
trolled the Philippines, which is the
English spelling, from when the En
glish took over.
Filipino is used to describe the
people of these islands, while
Philippines is the word for the name
of the country.
Actually, the national language is
Tagalog, which is spoken in its pure
form in Manila. But it is called
Pilipino so all the non-Manilan
Filipinos will not be offended by the
way they must speak, if not by the
spellings of individual words.
Who picks the movies for Sunday
Flicks? - Velina Underwood
The ASSU, in the person of Randy
Schwartz, is responsible for your
viewing pleasure.
According to Schwartz, his per
sonal preferences for movies have
little to do with what is shown. His
criteria as to what is shown is a
movie's availability, its nationwide
box-office reports of audience
preferences, the surveys he passes out
to Stanford students and the newest
releases he can find.
For this quarter's lineup, Schwartz,
distributed about 75 surveys to
people waiting in line at the Flicks
and to 40 ASSU officials, asking for
nine choices from each out of a list of
20.

Dear Bug Me.

How much do those little two-line
personal ads on the front pug t of The
New York Time. t? Can anyone
buy one? How much does a full-page
ad cost? Which one - the little two
liner or the full-page ad - is the better
buy when you work it all out? - Tim.
It's so nice of my editor to fill an
inch of column space with his ques
tion alone. To be equally thorough
with my answer (and to keep my
Daily job), I called the friendly classi
fied number of everyone's favorite
journalistic institution.
1 don t think The Times was run
ning any Washington's Birthday
sales. It's $200 for a line on the front
page, and you've got to buy at least
two lines. For some reason, these ads
run for 13 weeks at a time.
If you're willing to settle for two
lines on the classified pages for three
days, it will put you back $100,
As for the tull-page ad, buying one
of the nine columns on a classified
page costs slightly more than spend
ing a year at Stanford including tui
tion, air fare and incidental expenses.
I he whole cost of a page would buy a
handful of doctorates.
This is easy enough to figure out. A
line costs $49.20. There are 14 lines
in an inch. A column is 20 inches
long. That's a grand total of $13,776
for one column, at least in my fuzzy
minded view of math.
Not that the full-page rate could
possibly be different than the per-line
rate, but that's the best I could do.
Just to add perspective. The Daily
charges students $2.50 a line. It has a
circulation of 15,000. The New York
Times circulates 850,000 newspapers
every weekday.
If anyone wants to buy an ad that
will reach an audience that large, the
number to call is 1-800-223-7437.
Why is the Claw culled the Claw? -
Shirley Wang.
According to Art Prof. Albert El
sen, the Claw is called the Claw be
cause students call it the Claw. Say
that five times fast.
He couldn't remember its real title,

Demetrios from San Francisco.
