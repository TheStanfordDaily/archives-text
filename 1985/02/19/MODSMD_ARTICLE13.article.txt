There's probably no one who.knows better
than the council of presidents (COP) that the pe
tition to eject Eric Berg from his position as sen
ate chair was sloppy and damaging to the ASSU.
The whole episode can be summed up pretty
easily: The COP fired its charges without bother
ing to substantiate them; senators rallied around
their leader; the COP changed its mind; and the
student body watched the whole pathetic process
blow up in the faces of COP members.
The COP's most blatant blunder was to avoid
talking to Berg before launching the petition
drive. One COP member insists Berg has been
difficult to work with all year long, but Berg says
he had no idea the COP was contemplating his
ouster.
When the COP launched its petition, Berg
could scarcely respond because the charges were
so general. The COP's principal beef was that
Berg had been politicizing his position, but its
only example was a recent case in which Berg
sent a COP-introduced piece legislation to com
mittee. In this case, the money was to be used for
purposes other than originally intended. Berg's
decision was consistent with his position that is
sues should be discussed in committee before
being brought to a vote in the general senate, and
it fell within ASSU constitutional guidelines.

The COP promised specifics later, but after the
petition drive was abandoned, one COP member
admitted that Berg's "style" — not any specific
abuse of power — was the root of the conflict.
Style is a hard term to define and would have
been difficult for the student body to vote on.
What's more, the charge that Berg caused
several students to resign from the senate and ex
ecutive branch was never substantiated. The
rnp confused the process by refusing to identify
the students they said quit the ASSU because of
Berg. None of the former ASSU officials con
tacted by The Daily specifically named Berg as
the reason for leaving his or her post.
Then there's the curious idea of taking the pe
tition directly to the students instead of to the
senate. The senators have to work with Berg. If
they weren't willing to vote the necessary two
thirds to recall, then recall was hardly in order.
As the smoke clears, it would appear COP
members sought to use Berg as a scapegoat upon
which to heap their own frustrations over the dif
ficulties of affecting change within the ASSU bu
reaucracy.
A good witch hunt may be something "to get
the senate moving," but as COP members have
discovered, movement isn't enough. You've got
to move in the right direction.
