# Bad directions, and that's not all
## 
### 
There's nothing 1 hate more than bad directions.
Last summer I was staying in Port Huyneme with
my aunt, and she told me I could find the freeway
entrance the same place I got off. I never found the
entrance. I honked a guy down and he said he'd
lead me to the freeway, but he led me to the wrong
entrance. Then I drove through three shopping
centers and nearly drove through three walls. I
didn't shift into second until I was going 40. 1 was
screaming at everyone I saw, including my car and
myself. I finally found an entrance in Oxnard. I
thought that it was times like these that caused my
grandfather to quit driving in 1929.
Worse than cars, I hate when people give bad di
rections to other people. Once a friend was telling
me, "It took me three years to convince Mrs.
Dewine (her art teacher) that I wanted to paint like
Jamie Shuken, not Monet, not Renoir, but Jamie
Shuken." This college-educated teacher took three
years to realize that her student had some original
talent because she failed to think. She was so
caught with her pre-conceived notion of painting
that she failed to consider that another person
could have an equally viable alternative view.
It bothers me when people forget to think. Once
a girl asked me who I was voting for in the elections
last November. When I said David Bergland, she
replied, "Oh, Libertarians have some good ideas,
but on the whole they're very naive. Ask any poli.
sci. professor; he'll tell you." I wasn't bothered that
she disagreed with my views, but she never told me
why she believed so.
I don't want to condemn other people about this
failure to think since I constantly do the same thing
myself. It's a chronic illness. It was the worst when 1
first left that adolescent stage where kids first ask
themselves the big questions, "Who am I?" or

"Why am I here?" in that melodramatic fashion.
One day I turned 15-and-a-half and threw out all

the pathetic poetry 1 had written a year before and
decided that I pretty well knew what life was all
about. I mean I had gotten drunk and smoked pot
and made out with boys; 1 didn't think there was
much practical information left for me to know ex
cept college.
I was so sure I knew everything that I grew quite
complacent. I often took other people's opinions
for granted because I didn't find it necessary to

think. Sometimes it didn't matter. Once someone
told me that Dartmouth was the heaviest drinking
school in the country, and 1 just believed it. My
family thought that was ridiculous, but then we met
a bartender who said, "Oh, 1 graduated from
Dartmouth, the heaviest drinking school in the
country!"
However, most of the time it did matter. 1 used
to get so shocked when something 1 took for
granted didn't turn out the way I expected. 1 think
mostly it was because of my assumption in taking at
face value what others told me. The worst was with
this friend I had in 11th grade. She would tell me
how self-confident 1 was one moment, "What are
you going to do without me next year?" I believed
everything she said and was intensely confused and

at these shocks as organic. They would disrupt my
life for a period of time, but then 1 would forget and

high school, I went on this group tour of Europe,
and one night in Venice some people were telling

She sat down and said, "Did you hear the Jewish
jokes? You didn't? They all told jokes about how
they're all stingy — like 'What's the new Jew
sportscar? It stops on a dime and picks it up.' They
never thought that when you pick up a dime it adds
up to something, and I don't know about them or
anyone else, but 1 think thrift is a really good
thing." I had never thought about stinginess in
that light before. 1 had always been secretly embar

to question that prevailing stereotype. Since that
episode I've tried to make a conscious effort to
question other people's outlooks and relate them to
my own experiences. Because I am pretty

errors, but now I see my mistakes as more of a

Jamie told me last November — after I told her
how fast she talks — that her roommate once asked
her, "Doesn't your mind ever stop working?"
She told her roommate, "No. It never does. I
can't stop it." When I drove home from her apart

question that should always be answered "no."

There's nothing 1 hate more than bad directions.
Last summer I was staying in Port Huyneme with
my aunt, and she told me I could find the freeway
entrance the same place I got off. I never found the
entrance. I honked a guy down and he said he'd
lead me to the freeway, but he led me to the wrong
entrance. Then I drove through three shopping
centers and nearly drove through three walls. I
didn't shift into second until I was going 40. 1 was
screaming at everyone I saw, including my car and
myself. I finally found an entrance in Oxnard. I
thought that it was times like these that caused my
grandfather to quit driving in 1929.
Worse than cars, I hate when people give bad di
rections to other people. Once a friend was telling
me, "It took me three years to convince Mrs.
Dewine (her art teacher) that I wanted to paint like
Jamie Shuken, not Monet, not Renoir, but Jamie
Shuken." This college-educated teacher took three
years to realize that her student had some original
talent because she failed to think. She was so
caught with her pre-conceived notion of painting
that she failed to consider that another person
could have an equally viable alternative view.
It bothers me when people forget to think. Once
a girl asked me who I was voting for in the elections
last November. When I said David Bergland, she
replied, "Oh, Libertarians have some good ideas,
but on the whole they're very naive. Ask any poli.
sci. professor; he'll tell you." I wasn't bothered that
she disagreed with my views, but she never told me
why she believed so.
I don't want to condemn other people about this
failure to think since I constantly do the same thing
myself. It's a chronic illness. It was the worst when 1
first left that adolescent stage where kids first ask
themselves the big questions, "Who am I?" or

"Why am I here?" in that melodramatic fashion.
One day I turned 15-and-a-half and threw out all

the pathetic poetry 1 had written a year before and
decided that I pretty well knew what life was all
about. I mean I had gotten drunk and smoked pot
and made out with boys; 1 didn't think there was
much practical information left for me to know ex
cept college.
I was so sure I knew everything that I grew quite
complacent. I often took other people's opinions
for granted because I didn't find it necessary to

think. Sometimes it didn't matter. Once someone
told me that Dartmouth was the heaviest drinking
school in the country, and 1 just believed it. My
family thought that was ridiculous, but then we met
a bartender who said, "Oh, 1 graduated from
Dartmouth, the heaviest drinking school in the
country!"
However, most of the time it did matter. 1 used
to get so shocked when something 1 took for
granted didn't turn out the way I expected. 1 think
mostly it was because of my assumption in taking at
face value what others told me. The worst was with
this friend I had in 11th grade. She would tell me
how self-confident 1 was one moment, "What are
you going to do without me next year?" I believed
everything she said and was intensely confused and
