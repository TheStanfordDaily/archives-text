## Recollections on a changing university 
### 
I graduated from Stanford in 1962.
When 1 returned 20 years later, in
1982. I found my alma mater coming
almost full circle, from the civility of
the early '60s. through the destructive
period of left authoritarianism in the
late '60s to mid-'7os, and finally back

VIEWPOINT

to the current environment, in which
civility and tolerance are once again
values that the faculty cares to
defend.
Few students have recollections of
what happened to Stanford a decade
and more back when aggressive
militants succeeded in pushing not
very courageous faculty and adminis
tration to come to terms with their
demands. (Stanford's failure of nerve
in the early '70s was hardly unique.
With the exception of the University
of Chicago, many faculties acceded to
the pressures of the left and made
substantial policy concessions. Politi
cal and ideological criteria came to
prevail in decisions where they had
no business.)
Had the campus left worn white
sheets and burned crosses on faculty
lawns, the administration would have
had no ambivalence about asking
the cops to get them removed from
campus. Nor is it likely that any
Stanford faculty would have circ
ulated a petition in defense of the

KKK's actions on campus.
But the hooligans were of the left,
and for that reason were able to neu
tralize the Stanford faculty. This was
because of the pervasive guilt many
faculty felt toward to thes subjects of
leftwing anguish and concern. When
one Stanford professor, an avowed
Maoist, called for an armed struggle
against the trustees, among other acts
of demagogic braggadocio, there
were Stanford faculty who rushed to
this man's defense with petitions.
There was much agonizing by the fac

ulty before he was finally given the
boot. Presumably, some Stanford fac
ulty couldn't distinguish between the
responsible and irresponsible exercise
of academic freedom.
But I sense that this situation is
changed now. The infrastructure of
Stanford's political culture may still
be wedded to the ideology of the left,
but turnout by the rank and file
among the student body appears in
creasingly anemic.
The liberation of Grenada may
well mark the turning point in the

beginning of the left's decline on
campus. Since my arrival in 1982, it
was the first time I saw in The Daily at
least as many letters written in sup
port of Grenada's liberation as were
opposed. It indicated that there were
students at Stanford who would stand
up to the left â€” who were not afraid
to express their views in opposition to
the prevailing left-of-center or
thodoxy.
Hypocrisy cannot long survive the
light of reason. Consider what hap
pened here over a decade back.
There were Stanford professors who
would condemn the actions of Ameri
can soliders in Vietnam on moral
grounds and yet, with no sense of
contradiction, manage to find accep
table moral grounds to defend the ter
roristic violence that Marxist guerril
las intentionally carried out against
non-combatant civilians as well as
combatants. This abdication of a
unified moral standard occurred
primarily because of the psycho
dynamic elements that were
boiling on campus. No more combus
tible mixture can be imagined for
turning liberal heads from reason
than the emergence of explosive so
cial guilt combined with the fear of
verbal or even physical assault by
campus radicals.
