I'd like to respond to your edito
rial of Feb. 12 ("ASSU oversteps its
bounds") by explaining why the
senate chooses not to put every
special fee request on the ballot.
Let's assume the senate did put
every request that came to us on the
ballot. What would happen when
people went to vote? They would
look at the ballot and realize that
they have nearly no incentive to vote
any fee down unless they specifically
object to the group's existence.
Why? Because they can always get
their money back.
But they have a great incentive to
vote yes. They can in most cases get
the benefit from the group even if
they take their refund — they can
still read The Daily, they can still
hear the Band, etc.
You can see where this leads.
Everyone could simply vote yes and
then get a refund.
This is only a problem if the actual
refund rate exceeds the rate of
refunds we've built into the budget.
If that happens, the group has to
decide, sometimes in the middle of
the year or during major program
ming, what it is going to cut because
it is suddenly out of money.
And remember, by the constitu
tion (Article IV-4-E.2) we can't
budget for more than a 25 percent
refund rate. The figures I have for
the most recent cycle show that half
the groups are approaching a 25
percent actual refund rate; three
have exceeded it.
I personally believe that the lower
tax rate on everyone's PTR, the
fewer people will come for refunds.
That's why the senate tries to keep
that pcr-person tax low: to keep
actual refund rates from exceeding
that upper-budgeted limit of 25
percent.
I think the question is, which is
fairer? To cut budgets beforehand
and make some groups get petitions
in order to keep the tax rate low or
to let refunds wipe out programming
that students have voted for? The
latter is what will happen if tax rates
go through the roof.
Honestly, I think the system is
unfair. It presents us with two un-

satisfactory alternatives. I think it's a
great idea to vote on taxes, but to
allow refunds makes no sense. If no
refunds were allowed, people would
be more careful about what they
voted for — and the senate wouldn't
have to worry about how much in
proposed taxes got on the ballot.
But we do have to worry about it.
We believe we should cut things on
the front end, before people vote on
them. We don't think it's honest to
let them vote on something and then
have it cut by refunds later.

Well my friends, the time has
come to divest. The secretary of
education, William Bennett, has
made the public aware of us. He has
caught us with our stereos, our cars
and our three-week trips to the
beach. Now we face the conse- '
quences: major cutbacks in federal
funding for our educations.
Hey, I'm an American, and for the
good of my country I'm willing to
re-arrange my assets, liquidate
luxuries and make up for the GSL I
won't have next year. Sure, I think I
should start with my stereo. Bill.
Actually, I don't own one, but I can
certainly sell my $15 clock radio.
The G.E. radio really has been an
unnecessary luxury; I could easily
wake to my wristwatch alarm in the
morning. Who needs stereos or
clock radios, anyway? Relaxing to
music wastes the mind. Doing extra
problem sets improves it.
You see, I've really gotten into
the spirit of cutting back. I called my
folks the other day and suggested
divesting some of my graph paper and
textbooks. They thought that was a
great idea. (In fact, my mom said my
family would do its part by having
plain spaghetti instead of tuna
casserole on Tuesday nights.) That's
not all. Why tomorrow I'm going to
pawn my bicycle, my philodendron
and my unabriged dictionary. In no
time at all I'll be able to pay for
medical school.
