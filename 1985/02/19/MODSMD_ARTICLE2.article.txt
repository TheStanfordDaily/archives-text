# Bundy:
## No 'Star Wars' 
### DEBORAH KEHLE Staff writer 
"While it may not be able to
protect all of our people, it can and
will defend some of our weapons."
That's the way McGeorgc Bundy
parodied the logic of supporters of
President Reagan's "Star Wars"
defense system.
In his address last night to a near
capacity audience in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium, Bundy called the up
coming arms talks in Geneva "flim
flam" and said "the prospect of any
new or substantial agreement is . ..
remote."
"The conditions for serious
negotiations are absent," Bundy
said.
Bundy, an expert on nuclear
defense policy, served as special as
sistant for national security under
Presidents Kennedy and Johnson
and was president of the Ford Foun
dation from 1966 to 1979.
Bundy said the arms talks be
tween the United States and the So
viet Union are doomed for failure
"unless there are radical changes in
policy in Moscow or Washington or
both."
"There is no good reason to
suppose that either side will fall
back" within the next four years, he
said. The Soviets "will make no
agreement that lets Mr. Reagan's
(Strategic Defense Initiative) pro
gram run free."
"There is a clear-cut incom

patibility" between Reagan's pro
gram and arms control, Bundy said,
especially because Reagan is deter
mined that Star Wars not be a bar
gaining chip. Bundy said we can ex
pect "not a negotiation, but a con
test for public approval" in Geneva
between the United States and the
Soviets.
Bundy said the Soviets "view the
Star Wars program with deep
respect for the danger it may
produce" even though it is "still
only a research program." This will

lead them to condemn it at the con
ference, while the United States will
praise its peace-keeping potential,
he said.
"A nuclear war cannot be won
and must never be fought," Bundy
said. Even with a space-weapons
kill rate of 90 percent, there would
still be a "catastrophe."
The space weapons program is
supposed to close the so-called
"window of vulnerability." But
Bundy asserts "the window of vul
nerability never existed." The

United States could still strike back
and inflict "appaling" damage to
the Soviet Union, more than "any
sane leader" would risk.
"Our strategic deterrent is, in
fact, entirely adequate," Bundy
said. "Enough is more than enough
at levels long since reached."
However, the Soviets "are them
selves a most considerable part of
the current problem" when it comes
to arms control, Bundy said.

Queen for a day
Who says birthdays are a thing to dread? Certainly not
Okada freshman Kim Hsieh, who was treated on her
birthday yesterday to a royal procession across campus.

grapes and strawberries and was fanned with palm fronds.
