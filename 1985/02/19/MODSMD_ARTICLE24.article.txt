## UCLA hands Card 6th straight loss 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
An already miserable season just
got a little more miserable last night
for the Stanford basketball team. Not
a lot more miserable, just a little
more.
Last night's beneficiary of Stan
ford's relative lack of height, talent
and experience was UCLA. The final
score was 72-66.
It was the Cardinal's sixth straight
loss, eighth in nine games, 11th in 13
games, and 12th in 15 games. Stan
ford remained the tenant of the
Pacific 10 Conference cellar with a 2-
11 league record while its overall
mark slipped three games under .500
to 10-13.
If Coach Tom Davis is to stay in the
elite company of basketball coaches
who have not had losing seasons,
Stanford will have to win four of its
final five games. And if Stanford
hopes to win a game in the month of
February, it will have to beat either
first-place USC at home Thursday
night or second-place Oregon State at
Corvallis on the last day of the
month.
In these days of dwindling expecta
tions and growing frustrations, Davis
searches for any sort of salvation.
Last night he found it in the second
half, when the Bruins twice built
leads of 20 points or more and twice
Stanford refused to roll over and die.
UCLA led by 20, 60-40, as late as
the 6:48 mark in the second half, but
just over five minutes later, the Card
inal had cut it to nine. And in the final
seconds, the Cardinal narrowed it to
the final margin of six.
"As hard as these guys played in
the second half, that was outstand
ing," Davis told reporters. "We may
lack talent, but character is not some
thing this team lacks. I don't think
I've had a team that works harder."
In the end, however, it was the
same old story. UCLA was bigger,
stronger, faster, more talented and
more experienced. If Stanford was to
beat the Bruins at Maples Pavilion for
the third time in five years, it needed
to play a near-perfect game. The
Cardinal didn't come close.
Take, for example, the first half.
Stanford shot a god-awful 23 percent
from the floor. UCLA, at 46 percent,
wasn't much better, but still took two
fewer shots and made six more than
the Cardinal. So it was no mystery
why the Bruins led, 35-22, at
halftime.
"I think they just tightened up,"
was the way Davis described his
team's shaky first half. "They were
just trying so hard. You miss a couple
and then you try a little harder and
that really throws everything off.
"We were also missing free throws
in the first half," continued Davis,
whose team was 8-for-14 from the
line in the first half. "And we're a
good free-throw-shooting team.
That's a sign of tightness. When
you're missing your free throws, it
throws your whole shot off."
UCLA, meanwhile, wasn't exactly
tearing up the nets, but did enough
good things to even its overall record
at 11-11 and improve its Pac-10 mark
to 8-5.
The Bruins, who had lost four
straight before beating Arizona State
Saturday night, haven't been playing
well lately, and last night was no ex
ception. UCLA shot 45 percent from
the floor, was outrebounded by a
much smaller Stanford team and
turned the ball over 18 times.
Still, Coach Walt Hazzard will take

the victory. "We didn't play bad —
we won the game," he said. "It's our
second road win and anytime you win
on the road it's good."
Hazzard can thank forward Gary
Maloncon and his baseline jumper a
great deal for the road victory.
Malocon, who scored 23 points
against Stanford the last time the
teams met, came off the bench last
night to score 17, all but one of which
were baseline jumpers.
"It's a baseline play against the
zone," Maloncon said. "I rotate along
the baseline left to right. Stanford
plays a packed-in zone, so coach told
me to take the shot. I had a good
game against them last time and we
used the same play against them last
time."

Maloncon, named ESPN's Player
of the Game, was not UCLA's
leading scorer, though. Guard Nigel
Miguel was, with 18. Miguel scored
only four points in the first half, but
had 14 in the second, eight of which
were from the free-throw line.
While Maloncon and Miguel
combined for nearly half of UCLA's
points, Stanford relied on a more
balanced attack. Only one Cardinal
— freshman Greg Butler with 13,—
scored in double figures, but nine
players finished with five or more
points.
"We don't have a stopper," Davis
said. "We just don't have a guy that
can come down the floor and stick a
shot for us in a crucial situation."

Card notes
Stanford finally broke its string of
games in which it did not block a shot.
It blocked two last night, the first of
which gave the Cardinal 61 for the
season and broke the Stanford record
for most blocked shots in a season.
Although three Cardinal players
fouled out last night, only one of
them was a starter (Andy Fischer).
Keith Ramee played 20 minutes and
Earl koberlein only 16 before fouling
out.
Cardinal freshman center Eric
Reveno was hit with a technical foul
early in the second half last night
when he argued with an official after
being whistled for a foul in a
rebounding tie-up with UCLA's Brad
Wright.

a lot more miserable, just a little
more.
Last night's beneficiary of Stan
ford's relative lack of height, talent
and experience was UCLA. The final
score was 72-66.
It was the Cardinal's sixth straight
loss, eighth in nine games, 11th in 13
games, and 12th in 15 games. Stan
ford remained the tenant of the
Pacific 10 Conference cellar with a 2-
11 league record while its overall
mark slipped three games under .500
to 10-13.
If Coach Tom Davis is to stay in the
elite company of basketball coaches
who have not had losing seasons,
Stanford will have to win four of its
final five games. And if Stanford
hopes to win a game in the month of
February, it will have to beat either
first-place USC at home Thursday
night or second-place Oregon State at
Corvallis on the last day of the
month.
In these days of dwindling expecta
tions and growing frustrations, Davis
searches for any sort of salvation.
Last night he found it in the second
half, when the Bruins twice built
leads of 20 points or more and twice
Stanford refused to roll over and die.
UCLA led by 20, 60-40, as late as
the 6:48 mark in the second half, but
just over five minutes later, the Card
inal had cut it to nine. And in the final
seconds, the Cardinal narrowed it to
the final margin of six.
"As hard as these guys played in
the second half, that was outstand
ing," Davis told reporters. "We may
lack talent, but character is not some
thing this team lacks. I don't think
I've had a team that works harder."
In the end, however, it was the
same old story. UCLA was bigger,
stronger, faster, more talented and
more experienced. If Stanford was to
beat the Bruins at Maples Pavilion for
the third time in five years, it needed
to play a near-perfect game. The
Cardinal didn't come close.
Take, for example, the first half.
Stanford shot a god-awful 23 percent
from the floor. UCLA, at 46 percent,
wasn't much better, but still took two
fewer shots and made six more than
the Cardinal. So it was no mystery
why the Bruins led, 35-22, at
halftime.
"I think they just tightened up,"
was the way Davis described his
team's shaky first half. "They were
just trying so hard. You miss a couple
and then you try a little harder and
that really throws everything off.
"We were also missing free throws
in the first half," continued Davis,
whose team was 8-for-14 from the
line in the first half. "And we're a
good free-throw-shooting team.
That's a sign of tightness. When
you're missing your free throws, it
throws your whole shot off."
UCLA, meanwhile, wasn't exactly
tearing up the nets, but did enough
good things to even its overall record
at 11-11 and improve its Pac-10 mark
to 8-5.
The Bruins, who had lost four
straight before beating Arizona State
Saturday night, haven't been playing
well lately, and last night was no ex
ception. UCLA shot 45 percent from
the floor, was outrebounded by a
much smaller Stanford team and
turned the ball over 18 times.
Still, Coach Walt Hazzard will take

the victory. "We didn't play bad —
we won the game," he said. "It's our
second road win and anytime you win
on the road it's good."
Hazzard can thank forward Gary
Maloncon and his baseline jumper a
great deal for the road victory.
Malocon, who scored 23 points
against Stanford the last time the
teams met, came off the bench last
night to score 17, all but one of which
were baseline jumpers.
"It's a baseline play against the
zone," Maloncon said. "I rotate along
the baseline left to right. Stanford
plays a packed-in zone, so coach told
me to take the shot. I had a good
game against them last time and we
used the same play against them last
time."

Maloncon, named ESPN's Player
of the Game, was not UCLA's
leading scorer, though. Guard Nigel
Miguel was, with 18. Miguel scored
only four points in the first half, but
had 14 in the second, eight of which
were from the free-throw line.
While Maloncon and Miguel
combined for nearly half of UCLA's
points, Stanford relied on a more
balanced attack. Only one Cardinal
— freshman Greg Butler with 13,—
scored in double figures, but nine
players finished with five or more
points.
"We don't have a stopper," Davis
said. "We just don't have a guy that
can come down the floor and stick a
shot for us in a crucial situation."

Card notes
Stanford finally broke its string of
games in which it did not block a shot.
It blocked two last night, the first of
which gave the Cardinal 61 for the
season and broke the Stanford record
for most blocked shots in a season.
Although three Cardinal players
fouled out last night, only one of
them was a starter (Andy Fischer).
Keith Ramee played 20 minutes and
Earl koberlein only 16 before fouling
out.
Cardinal freshman center Eric
Reveno was hit with a technical foul
early in the second half last night
when he argued with an official after
being whistled for a foul in a
rebounding tie-up with UCLA's Brad
Wright.

Like the rest of the Stanford team, Andy Fischer did not have one of his
better games last night. He scored only six points before fouling out.
An already miserable season just
got a little more miserable last night
