# Stanford bows to Cal in double OT heartbreaker
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
Stanford Basketball Coach Tom
Davis walked out of the Cardinal
lockerroom and into the adjacent
interview room following Satur
day's 43-41 double-overtime loss
to California. With his shirt un
buttoned halfway to the waist, his
hair unkempt, a throat lozenge in
his mouth and a cup of water in his
hand, Davis looked as though he
had been through an ordeal.
He had.
Stanford had lost its fifth straight
game. But unlike the previous four,
or any of the Cardinal's other
Pacific 10 Conference setbacks for
that matter, this one was close. Too
close.
"They played their butts off," a
hoarse Davis said of his team. "We
just couldn't get over the hump. We
couldn't get that crucial basket,
make that crucial free throw or
grab that crucial rebound."
Cal's Kevin Johnson put the
Cardinal out of its misery 49
minutes and 59 seconds after the
beginning of the ordeal. With the
score knotted 41-41 in the second
overtime and all indicators pointing
toward a third extra period,
Johnson drove right off a screen
from Eddie Javius, picked up his
dribble just to the left of the top of
the key and put up a 17-foot
jumper.
The net swished, the buzzer
buzzed and the Cal bench swarmed
Johnson.
"I thought it was good," Johnson
said. "I felt pretty confident when I
released it. I had a good screen
from Eddie and I was pretty open."
While the near-capacity crowd of
6,803 in Maples Pavilion certainly
was concerned with the outcome of
the game, the rest of the Pac-10
couldn't have cared less. The vic
tory improved Cal's record to 12-
10 overall and 4-8 in the Pac-10,
and kept it only two places above
the cellar position which Stanford
currently occupies.
The victory, however, continued
the Bears' recent dominance over
its cross-Bay rival. It was their
second triumph over the Cardinal
this season and the fourth straight
at Maples Pavilion. Stanford

seniors Kent Seymour and Charles
Hunt will end their careers with a
1-7 record against Cal.
For a while, it seemed like a
game nobody wanted to win. The
teams missed pressure free throws,
missed pressure shots, turned the
ball over in pressure situations— in
short, they choked.
The Bears had the best chance to
win late in regulation — they had a
38-37 lead and the ball with 30
seconds left. But John Paye

knocked the ball away from Cal
guard Chris Washington and then
made a diving save that carried him
into the Cardinal bench. Keith
Ramee came up with the ball on the
other side of the court, drove to the
basket, scored and was fouled.
Ramee, however, missed the free
throw that would have put Stanford
ahead by two and Cal, with 18
seconds remaining, had a chance to

Cal's Ernie Sears scored 10 points on 5-for-6 shooting to share
game-high scoring honors with teammate Kevin Johnson Saturday.
win it. Washington got that chance 10
seconds later when Seymour fouled
him while trying to block his shot.
With students on the sideline
jumping up and down to make the
flexible Maples floor bounce, Wash
ington missed the first free throw,
then hit the second to tie it at 39-39.
Stanford had the last chance for vic
tory in regulation, but Paye's 25-
footer from the left side was short.
The first overtime was even worse
as far as blown opportunities were
concerned. In all, Stanford missed
four shots — three of them from
inside 15 feet — and turned the ball
over twice. Cal, meanwhile, missed a
lay-up and three front ends of one
and-ones, the final choke coming
when Johnson blew his free throw
with 34 seconds to go. Again, Stan
ford took the final shot and, again, it
missed.
Stanford, in essence, turned the
second five-minute overtime into a
two-minute period by stalling more

than three minutes off the clock
before Ramee was fouled with 1:53
left. Ramee, whom Davis called the
team's "best pressure free-throw
shooter," missed his second straight
pressure attempt of the game, and the
Bears had the ball back. Then it was
Cat's turn to stall, and the Bears held
the ball until Johnson did his thing as
time ran out.
The game might never have gone
down to the wire had Stanford not
squandered a 30-21 lead with 14:10
remaining in the second half. But Cal
guard Earnie Sears came off the
bench to score the Bears' next four
hoops, and with 11:32 to go, the
Cardinal's lead had shrunk to five
points, 34-29.
What was worse, Stanford didn't
score at all for the next 7:36 and
didn't score on a field goal until
Ramee hit a lay-up with 18 seconds
left.
Though there were plenty of
negatives, Davis tried to emphasize
the positives to his demoralized team.
"We did a lot of good things," he
said. "1 tried to remind them about
the things they did to get themselves
in the position to win."

time ran out.
The game might never have gone
down to the wire had Stanford not
squandered a 30-21 lead with 14:10
remaining in the second half. But Cal
guard Earnie Sears came off the
bench to score the Bears' next four
hoops, and with 11:32 to go, the
Cardinal's lead had shrunk to five
points, 34-29.
What was worse, Stanford didn't
score at all for the next 7:36 and
didn't score on a field goal until
Ramee hit a lay-up with 18 seconds
left.
Though there were plenty of
negatives, Davis tried to emphasize
the positives to his demoralized team.
"We did a lot of good things," he
said. "1 tried to remind them about
the things they did to get themselves
in the position to win."
Stanford Basketball Coach Tom
Davis walked out of the Cardinal
lockerroom and into the adjacent
interview room following Satur
day's 43-41 double-overtime loss
to California. With his shirt un
buttoned halfway to the waist, his
hair unkempt, a throat lozenge in
his mouth and a cup of water in his
hand, Davis looked as though he
had been through an ordeal.
He had.
Stanford had lost its fifth straight
game. But unlike the previous four,
or any of the Cardinal's other
Pacific 10 Conference setbacks for
that matter, this one was close. Too
close.
"They played their butts off," a
hoarse Davis said of his team. "We
just couldn't get over the hump. We
couldn't get that crucial basket,
make that crucial free throw or
grab that crucial rebound."
Cal's Kevin Johnson put the
Cardinal out of its misery 49
minutes and 59 seconds after the
beginning of the ordeal. With the
score knotted 41-41 in the second
overtime and all indicators pointing
toward a third extra period,
Johnson drove right off a screen
from Eddie Javius, picked up his
dribble just to the left of the top of
the key and put up a 17-foot
jumper.
The net swished, the buzzer
buzzed and the Cal bench swarmed
Johnson.
"I thought it was good," Johnson
said. "I felt pretty confident when I
released it. I had a good screen
from Eddie and I was pretty open."
While the near-capacity crowd of
6,803 in Maples Pavilion certainly
was concerned with the outcome of
the game, the rest of the Pac-10
couldn't have cared less. The vic
tory improved Cal's record to 12-
10 overall and 4-8 in the Pac-10,
and kept it only two places above
the cellar position which Stanford
currently occupies.
The victory, however, continued
the Bears' recent dominance over
its cross-Bay rival. It was their
second triumph over the Cardinal
this season and the fourth straight
at Maples Pavilion. Stanford

seniors Kent Seymour and Charles
Hunt will end their careers with a
1-7 record against Cal.
For a while, it seemed like a
game nobody wanted to win. The
teams missed pressure free throws,
missed pressure shots, turned the
ball over in pressure situations— in
short, they choked.
The Bears had the best chance to
win late in regulation — they had a
38-37 lead and the ball with 30
seconds left. But John Paye

knocked the ball away from Cal
guard Chris Washington and then
made a diving save that carried him
into the Cardinal bench. Keith
Ramee came up with the ball on the
other side of the court, drove to the
basket, scored and was fouled.
Ramee, however, missed the free
throw that would have put Stanford
ahead by two and Cal, with 18
seconds remaining, had a chance to

Cal's Ernie Sears scored 10 points on 5-for-6 shooting to share
game-high scoring honors with teammate Kevin Johnson Saturday.
win it. Washington got that chance 10
seconds later when Seymour fouled
him while trying to block his shot.
With students on the sideline
jumping up and down to make the
flexible Maples floor bounce, Wash
ington missed the first free throw,
then hit the second to tie it at 39-39.
Stanford had the last chance for vic
tory in regulation, but Paye's 25-
footer from the left side was short.
The first overtime was even worse
as far as blown opportunities were
concerned. In all, Stanford missed
four shots — three of them from
inside 15 feet — and turned the ball
over twice. Cal, meanwhile, missed a
lay-up and three front ends of one
and-ones, the final choke coming
when Johnson blew his free throw
with 34 seconds to go. Again, Stan
ford took the final shot and, again, it
missed.
Stanford, in essence, turned the
second five-minute overtime into a
two-minute period by stalling more

than three minutes off the clock
before Ramee was fouled with 1:53
left. Ramee, whom Davis called the
team's "best pressure free-throw
shooter," missed his second straight
pressure attempt of the game, and the
Bears had the ball back. Then it was
Cat's turn to stall, and the Bears held
the ball until Johnson did his thing as
time ran out.
The game might never have gone
