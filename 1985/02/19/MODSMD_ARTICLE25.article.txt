# Stanford bows to Cal in double OT heartbreaker
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
Stanford Basketball Coach Tom
Davis walked out of the Cardinal
lockerroom and into the adjacent
interview room following Satur
day's 43-41 double-overtime loss
to California. With his shirt un
buttoned halfway to the waist, his
hair unkempt, a throat lozenge in
his mouth and a cup of water in his
hand, Davis looked as though he
had been through an ordeal.
He had.
Stanford had lost its fifth straight
game. But unlike the previous four,
or any of the Cardinal's other
Pacific 10 Conference setbacks for
that matter, this one was close. Too
close.
"They played their butts off," a
hoarse Davis said of his team. "We
just couldn't get over the hump. We
couldn't get that crucial basket,
make that crucial free throw or
grab that crucial rebound."
Cal's Kevin Johnson put the
Cardinal out of its misery 49
minutes and 59 seconds after the
beginning of the ordeal. With the
score knotted 41-41 in the second
overtime and all indicators pointing
toward a third extra period,
Johnson drove right off a screen
from Eddie Javius, picked up his
dribble just to the left of the top of
the key and put up a 17-foot
jumper.
The net swished, the buzzer
buzzed and the Cal bench swarmed
Johnson.
"I thought it was good," Johnson
said. "I felt pretty confident when I
released it. I had a good screen
from Eddie and I was pretty open."
While the near-capacity crowd of
6,803 in Maples Pavilion certainly
was concerned with the outcome of
the game, the rest of the Pac-10
couldn't have cared less. The vic
tory improved Cal's record to 12-
10 overall and 4-8 in the Pac-10,
and kept it only two places above
the cellar position which Stanford
currently occupies.
The victory, however, continued
the Bears' recent dominance over
its cross-Bay rival. It was their
second triumph over the Cardinal
this season and the fourth straight
at Maples Pavilion. Stanford

seniors Kent Seymour and Charles
Hunt will end their careers with a
1-7 record against Cal.
For a while, it seemed like a
game nobody wanted to win. The
teams missed pressure free throws,
missed pressure shots, turned the
ball over in pressure situations— in
short, they choked.
The Bears had the best chance to
win late in regulation — they had a
38-37 lead and the ball with 30
seconds left. But John Paye

knocked the ball away from Cal
guard Chris Washington and then
made a diving save that carried him
into the Cardinal bench. Keith
Ramee came up with the ball on the
other side of the court, drove to the
basket, scored and was fouled.
Ramee, however, missed the free
throw that would have put Stanford
ahead by two and Cal, with 18
seconds remaining, had a chance to

game-high scoring honors with teammate Kevin Johnson Saturday.
