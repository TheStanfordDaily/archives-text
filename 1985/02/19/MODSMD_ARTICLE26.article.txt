## Card drops pair in Arizona 
### PABLO MORALES Staff sportswriter 
It's tough to win on the road.
The Stanford women's basketball team might
have expected this maxim to hold true against all
teams in the Western Collegiate Athletic Associa
tion except for the two Arizona teams, who occupy
the conference basement. Not so.
This weekend, the Cardinal went on the road to
Arizona with hopes of ending a three-game losing
streak. However, the Sun Devils of Arizona State
and the Arizona Wildcats felt obliged to extend
Stanford's streak, and did so by scores of 84-56 and
57-49, respectively.
As in the previous three games, the lack of offen
sive consistency on the part of Stanford played a
major role in both defeats. This time the Cardinal
offense fell prey to two well-coached defenses.
"Both teams knew what they had to do on
defense to shut us down." Stanford Head Coach
Dotty McCrea said. "We just couldn't adjust."
On Friday night, the Sun Devils shut the Card
inal offense down by playing extremelv tight
defense on Stanford's two offensive stalwarts,
guard Virginia Sourlis and forward Kami Ander
son. This forced Stanford to rely heavily on the
inside game for point production, something that
had not proven successful for the Cardinal in its
past few outings.
And once again, the inside game for the Cardinal
did not respond, although 6-0 senior forward Mary
Bradach contributed 14 points on a seven-for-11
shooting effort. Bradach's performance was not
enough to keep pace with a Sun Devil offense
which was shooting a blistering 62 percent from the
field.
In addition, Arizona State's full-court press and
half-court traps forced steals and turnovers for
most of the game. Anderson. Stanford's leading
scorer, was one who felt the pressure of the swarm

ing Sun Devil defense, shooting a mere six-for-15,
far below her season average.
She wasn't alone. Sourlis was an uncharacteristic
six-for-13 from the field and center Karen
Goedewaagen hit on only two of her nine shots. As
a team, Stanford shot 35 percent from the floor
(26-of-63) and 40 percent from the foul line (four
of-10).
The Sun Devil scoring barrage was led by for
ward Beth Smetana whose 18 points— nine-for-12
from the field — wai a game high. Five-foot-seven
junior guard Jodi Rathbun tossed in 13 points and
6-0 sophomore forward Sherry Doole added 14.
Arizona State took a ten-point (38-28) lead at
the half, and its scorching offensive pace did not
slacken in the second period. When it was clear that
the game was out of reach. McCrea began to substi
tute in an effort to give the starters some rest for
the game against the winless Wildcats on Saturday.
The extra rest didn't seem to do the Cardinal
starters much good, as Stanford's offensive perfor
mance went from bad to worse during the first half
of its game against Arizona. The Cardinal shot an
ice-cold five-of-24 from the field, including six
missed lay-ups.
The Wildcats weren't lighting up the scoreboard
either, but Arizona still held a 10-point lead, 25-
15, at the intermission.
The second half was a virtual imitation of the
first as. again, the Stanford offense could not get on
track in the face of a tough Wildcat defense. 5-11
freshman forward Barb Hyde was a force inside for
Arizona, pulling down a game-high 13 rebounds.
5-5 junior guard kirsten Smith scored 14 points to
lead the Wildcats.
Oncc again. Bradach had a great game, scoring
18 points and grabbing 10 rebounds to lead the
Cardinal. She has led Stanford in scoring and in
rebounding for the past three games, averaging 16
points and 10 rebounds an outing.

Anderson shot far below her average, two-for-12
from the field and three-for-four from the free
throw line for a total of seven points. The team
shooting average leaped an entire percentage point
from the previous night's performance — the Card
inal hit on 36 percent of its shots from the floor
(19-of-53).
Arizona State's victory over the Cardinal was
only its second WCAA triumph — the Sun Devils
had beaten Arizona earlier in the week — and it
lifted ASU to a share of sixth place in the confer
ence with Stanford at 2-6. The Wildcats remain in
last place with a 1-7 record.
Stanford's five straight loses have lowered its
overall record to 9-13 with six tough conference
games remaining on the schedule. McCrea hoped
that the Cardinal could win 10 games this year,
building upon the 5-23 record of last year. Now
that goal appears difficult to reach.
"We had hoped to win our tenth game against
either one of the Arizonas," McCrea. "Now we're
going to have to pull off an upset if we want to
reach that goal."
Of the six remaining games, two are against two
time defending NCAA champion USC, and the
rest are against Cal State-Fullerton, Long Beach
State, UCLA, and San Diego State. All five teams
are ranked in the top 20 nationally.
Without a doubt, the Cardinal desperately needs
an increase in point production from its inside
game should it entertain any hope of upsetting any
one of the remaining teams on the schedule.
Bradach has been playing extremely well, but assis
tance from the other forwards and centers is cru
cial.
Assistant Coach Mike Kehoe prophesized that
the neither Cardinal nor any team can rely on the
15-foot jumper. If opponents continue to key on
Sourlis and Anderson, without increased produc
tion from the front line, Stanford may have to wait
until next year to get its 10 victories.

Goedewaagen hit on only two of her nine shots. As
a team, Stanford shot 35 percent from the floor
(26-of-63) and 40 percent from the foul line (four
of-10).
The Sun Devil scoring barrage was led by for
ward Beth Smetana whose 18 points— nine-for-12
from the field — wai a game high. Five-foot-seven
junior guard Jodi Rathbun tossed in 13 points and
6-0 sophomore forward Sherry Doole added 14.
Arizona State took a ten-point (38-28) lead at
the half, and its scorching offensive pace did not
slacken in the second period. When it was clear that
the game was out of reach. McCrea began to substi
tute in an effort to give the starters some rest for
the game against the winless Wildcats on Saturday.
The extra rest didn't seem to do the Cardinal
starters much good, as Stanford's offensive perfor
mance went from bad to worse during the first half
of its game against Arizona. The Cardinal shot an
ice-cold five-of-24 from the field, including six
missed lay-ups.
The Wildcats weren't lighting up the scoreboard
either, but Arizona still held a 10-point lead, 25-
15, at the intermission.
The second half was a virtual imitation of the
first as. again, the Stanford offense could not get on
track in the face of a tough Wildcat defense. 5-11
freshman forward Barb Hyde was a force inside for
Arizona, pulling down a game-high 13 rebounds.
5-5 junior guard kirsten Smith scored 14 points to
lead the Wildcats.
Oncc again. Bradach had a great game, scoring
18 points and grabbing 10 rebounds to lead the
Cardinal. She has led Stanford in scoring and in
rebounding for the past three games, averaging 16
points and 10 rebounds an outing.

Anderson shot far below her average, two-for-12
from the field and three-for-four from the free
throw line for a total of seven points. The team
shooting average leaped an entire percentage point
from the previous night's performance — the Card
inal hit on 36 percent of its shots from the floor
(19-of-53).
Arizona State's victory over the Cardinal was
only its second WCAA triumph — the Sun Devils
had beaten Arizona earlier in the week — and it
lifted ASU to a share of sixth place in the confer
ence with Stanford at 2-6. The Wildcats remain in
last place with a 1-7 record.
Stanford's five straight loses have lowered its
overall record to 9-13 with six tough conference
games remaining on the schedule. McCrea hoped
that the Cardinal could win 10 games this year,
building upon the 5-23 record of last year. Now
that goal appears difficult to reach.
"We had hoped to win our tenth game against
either one of the Arizonas," McCrea. "Now we're
going to have to pull off an upset if we want to
reach that goal."
Of the six remaining games, two are against two
time defending NCAA champion USC, and the
rest are against Cal State-Fullerton, Long Beach
State, UCLA, and San Diego State. All five teams
are ranked in the top 20 nationally.
Without a doubt, the Cardinal desperately needs
an increase in point production from its inside
game should it entertain any hope of upsetting any
one of the remaining teams on the schedule.
Bradach has been playing extremely well, but assis
tance from the other forwards and centers is cru
cial.
Assistant Coach Mike Kehoe prophesized that
the neither Cardinal nor any team can rely on the
15-foot jumper. If opponents continue to key on
Sourlis and Anderson, without increased produc
tion from the front line, Stanford may have to wait
until next year to get its 10 victories.

Mary Bradach was Stanford's only consistent bright spot in its weeken
set in Arizona. She scored a total of 32 points in the two games.
It's tough to win on the road.
The Stanford women's basketball team might
have expected this maxim to hold true against all
teams in the Western Collegiate Athletic Associa
tion except for the two Arizona teams, who occupy
the conference basement. Not so.
This weekend, the Cardinal went on the road to
Arizona with hopes of ending a three-game losing
streak. However, the Sun Devils of Arizona State
and the Arizona Wildcats felt obliged to extend
Stanford's streak, and did so by scores of 84-56 and
57-49, respectively.
As in the previous three games, the lack of offen
sive consistency on the part of Stanford played a
major role in both defeats. This time the Cardinal
offense fell prey to two well-coached defenses.
"Both teams knew what they had to do on
defense to shut us down." Stanford Head Coach
Dotty McCrea said. "We just couldn't adjust."
On Friday night, the Sun Devils shut the Card
inal offense down by playing extremelv tight
defense on Stanford's two offensive stalwarts,
guard Virginia Sourlis and forward Kami Ander
son. This forced Stanford to rely heavily on the
inside game for point production, something that
had not proven successful for the Cardinal in its
past few outings.
And once again, the inside game for the Cardinal
did not respond, although 6-0 senior forward Mary
Bradach contributed 14 points on a seven-for-11
shooting effort. Bradach's performance was not
enough to keep pace with a Sun Devil offense
which was shooting a blistering 62 percent from the
field.
In addition, Arizona State's full-court press and
half-court traps forced steals and turnovers for
most of the game. Anderson. Stanford's leading
scorer, was one who felt the pressure of the swarm

ing Sun Devil defense, shooting a mere six-for-15,
far below her season average.
She wasn't alone. Sourlis was an uncharacteristic
six-for-13 from the field and center Karen
Goedewaagen hit on only two of her nine shots. As
