## Baseball Stanford takes 3 of 4 from Fresno State 
### LARRY GREEN Staff sportswriter 
A baseball team can go a long way
with good pitching. The Cardinal
proved that this weekend by taking
three of four games from the 15th
ranked Fresno State Bulldogs and im
proving its record to 8-3.
Stanford Head Coach Mark
Marquess was pleased with the Card
inal's overall performance. "You're
going to go up and down (batting and
scoring runs) during the season, but
the key to it is pitching and defense,"
he said.
It didn't matter that yesterday's
game at Sunken Diamond, which
Stanford won 10-6, started with
Cardinal hurler Kevin Kunkel being
roughed up for five first-inning runs,
including a grand-slam homer by Bull
dog designated hitter Craig Ainley.
Marquess decided to stick with his
starter, and the Stanford bats came to
the Kunkel's rescue.
"It wasn't a league game,"
Marquess said. "We wanted to let

him (Kunkel) work and pitch three or
four innings." Kunkel ended up
pitching six more innings of scoreless
baseball.
Stanford chipped away steadily at
the Fresno State lead. In the bottom
of the first inning, John Ramos sin
gled and Rick Lundblade walked.
With two outs, both runners were
going when Mike Deßenon singled to
drive in Ramos. Lundblade, who had
hustled all the way around from first,
was out at home when he failed to jar
the ball loose from Fresno State
catcher Jim Davis in a collision at the
plate.
In the Cardinal second, Walt Har
ris led off with a triple and Mark
Davis hit a come-backer over the
pitcher's mound to close the gap to 5-
2. Toi Cook walked to force Bulldog
pitcher Eric Solberg from the mound
and then took off with Davis on a suc
cessful double steal.
Consecutive walks to Pete Stanicek
and Ruben Amaro brought Davis
home before Ramos hit into a double

play to kill the rally.
Stanford went ahead for good in
the third inning. Lundblade and
Deßenon drew walks to lead off the
frame, and Harris capitalized by sin
gling Lundblade home. Davis singled
to load the bases, then Cook got
aboard on a fielder's choice to score
Deßenon and tie the score at 5-5.
John Verducci lofted a sacrifice fly
deep to left field to drive in Harris
with the go-ahead run.
Harris drove in the winning run in
the fourth. After Ramos walked,
Lundblade singled and the pair pulled
off Stanford's second double steal of
the day. Harris sliced a single to right
that scored Ramos and increased the
Cardinal's lead to 7-5,
Amaro put the game on ice in the
bottom of the fifth with his first
career home run. With Verducci on
third after having driven Davis home,
Amaro hit a shot to right center that
just cleared the fence and made the
score 10-5
Rick Dietz relieved Kunkel with

two outs and the bases filled in the
top of the eighth and picked up his
fourth save of the season. Kunkel
earned his first win of the season to
go 1-1 overall.
Marquess praised his team's ability
to overcome the early five-run deficit,
saying, "It was a great offensive effort
for us to come back."
"I broke out today," Amaro said
after his performance in Sunday's
game at Sunken Diamond. Amaro,
who went 3-for-3, was personally re
sponsible for six of Stanford's runs in
their 9-3 win at Sunken Diamond.
Jeff Ballard went the distance in
the victory over the Bulldogs, giving
up eight hits while raising his record
to 3-0. "I brought out the slider today
and got big outs on all of them," he
said.
Hard-throwing Fresno State
pitcher Mike Goff seemed to have
Stanford off balance early in the con
test. At the start of the fifth inning the
Bulldogs were ahead 2-1 on a
ground-out RBI by shortstop Joe
Xavier and a solo home run by third
baseman Rob Bafia. But in the bot
tom of the inning. Cook's walk with
one out ignited a four-run rally that
put the Cardinal ahead to stay.
Verducci's single after Cook's base
on balls placed runners on first and
second. The next batter, Stanicek,
singled Cook home to tie the score,
and Amaro drove in the go-ahead
and winning runs with a single off the
first pitch he saw. Lundblade built up
the lead to 5-2 with a sacrifice fly that
scored Amaro.
Stanford extended the lead in the
seventh inning. Verducci led off with
a single and moved to second on a
wild pitch. Amaro doubled and went
to third on an error to score Verducci.
That chased Fresno's Goff from the
mound. Ramos followed with an RBI
single. After Lundblade walked,
Deßenon singled Ramos home to
raise the Cardinal lead to 8-2.
After that, it was Ballard's pitching
that held the Bulldogs in check for
the remainder of the game. "He
(Ballard) can be sharper," Marquess
said, "but he had good control
(today)."
Mark Davis closed out the scoring
with a leadoff homer, his third of the
year, in the bottom of the eighth in
ning.
The Cardinal squelched two Fresno
State rally attempts in the eighth and
ninth innings with two perfect
around-the-horn double plays started
by third baseman Ken Green. "We
played great defense today . . . fan
tastic," Marquess said.
Saturday's game, at Fresno, was a

different situation. It was a clear ex
ample of how pitching and hitting
must balance in order for a team to
win. Bulldog pitcher Ken Crew held
the Cardinal to three hits and Fresno
State coasted to a 7-2 victory.
Marquess said, "He (Crew) stuck it to
us pretty good."
Stanford starter Jack McDowell
had a game in which he didn't pitch
badly, but also didn't have a few
breaks go his way. The loss dropped
McDowell's record to 1-2. Two other
freshman pitchers, Lee Plemel and
Ugo Colella, got a little work during
the latter stages of the contest.
Davis, Harris and Stanicek were
the only Cardinal players able to mar
Crew's pitching performance with
hits. Davis and Verducci were
credited with Stanford's two RBIs.
Marquess said about the two games

in Fresno, "We essentially traded
great pitching performances." He was
able to say that because of Rob Was
senaar's effort on the hill in the series
opener on Friday.
"Wassenaar kind of handled
them," Marquess said. He and Dietz
combined for an eight-hitter en route
to an 8-4 victory. Along the way the
two Stanford pitchers also struck out
12 Bulldogs — Wassenaar lead the
way with 10 whiffs.
Stanford jumped out to a 3-0 lead
in the third inning and never looked
back. Lundblade and Deßenon led
the way, each driving in two runs.
Ramos, Harris and Davis rapped two
hits apiece off three Fresno State
pitchers.
The victory improved Wassenaar's
record to 2-0 and Dietz tallied an
other save.

Cardinal third baseman Ruben Amaro prepares to high-five teammate
Rick Lundblade (No. 15) after the first home run of his collegiate career
yesterday. The homer, which just barely cleared the fence in right
center field, came in the fifth inning and gave Stanford a 10-5 lead.
Amaro's heroics came on the heels of a fine 3-for-3 performance in Sun
day's game against Fresno State.
A baseball team can go a long way
with good pitching. The Cardinal
proved that this weekend by taking
three of four games from the 15th
ranked Fresno State Bulldogs and im
proving its record to 8-3.
Stanford Head Coach Mark
Marquess was pleased with the Card
inal's overall performance. "You're
going to go up and down (batting and
scoring runs) during the season, but
the key to it is pitching and defense,"
he said.
It didn't matter that yesterday's
game at Sunken Diamond, which
Stanford won 10-6, started with
Cardinal hurler Kevin Kunkel being
roughed up for five first-inning runs,
including a grand-slam homer by Bull
dog designated hitter Craig Ainley.
Marquess decided to stick with his
starter, and the Stanford bats came to
the Kunkel's rescue.
"It wasn't a league game,"
Marquess said. "We wanted to let

him (Kunkel) work and pitch three or
four innings." Kunkel ended up
pitching six more innings of scoreless
baseball.
Stanford chipped away steadily at
the Fresno State lead. In the bottom
of the first inning, John Ramos sin
gled and Rick Lundblade walked.
With two outs, both runners were
going when Mike Deßenon singled to
drive in Ramos. Lundblade, who had
hustled all the way around from first,
was out at home when he failed to jar
the ball loose from Fresno State
catcher Jim Davis in a collision at the
plate.
In the Cardinal second, Walt Har
ris led off with a triple and Mark
Davis hit a come-backer over the
pitcher's mound to close the gap to 5-
2. Toi Cook walked to force Bulldog
pitcher Eric Solberg from the mound
and then took off with Davis on a suc
cessful double steal.
Consecutive walks to Pete Stanicek
and Ruben Amaro brought Davis
home before Ramos hit into a double

play to kill the rally.
Stanford went ahead for good in
the third inning. Lundblade and
Deßenon drew walks to lead off the
frame, and Harris capitalized by sin
gling Lundblade home. Davis singled
to load the bases, then Cook got
aboard on a fielder's choice to score
Deßenon and tie the score at 5-5.
John Verducci lofted a sacrifice fly
deep to left field to drive in Harris
with the go-ahead run.
Harris drove in the winning run in
the fourth. After Ramos walked,
Lundblade singled and the pair pulled
off Stanford's second double steal of
the day. Harris sliced a single to right
that scored Ramos and increased the
Cardinal's lead to 7-5,
Amaro put the game on ice in the
bottom of the fifth with his first
career home run. With Verducci on
third after having driven Davis home,
Amaro hit a shot to right center that
just cleared the fence and made the
score 10-5
Rick Dietz relieved Kunkel with

two outs and the bases filled in the
top of the eighth and picked up his
fourth save of the season. Kunkel
earned his first win of the season to
go 1-1 overall.
Marquess praised his team's ability
to overcome the early five-run deficit,
saying, "It was a great offensive effort
for us to come back."
"I broke out today," Amaro said
after his performance in Sunday's
game at Sunken Diamond. Amaro,
who went 3-for-3, was personally re
sponsible for six of Stanford's runs in
their 9-3 win at Sunken Diamond.
Jeff Ballard went the distance in
the victory over the Bulldogs, giving
up eight hits while raising his record
to 3-0. "I brought out the slider today
and got big outs on all of them," he
said.
Hard-throwing Fresno State
pitcher Mike Goff seemed to have
Stanford off balance early in the con
test. At the start of the fifth inning the
Bulldogs were ahead 2-1 on a
ground-out RBI by shortstop Joe
Xavier and a solo home run by third
baseman Rob Bafia. But in the bot
tom of the inning. Cook's walk with
one out ignited a four-run rally that
put the Cardinal ahead to stay.
Verducci's single after Cook's base
on balls placed runners on first and
second. The next batter, Stanicek,
singled Cook home to tie the score,
and Amaro drove in the go-ahead
and winning runs with a single off the
first pitch he saw. Lundblade built up
the lead to 5-2 with a sacrifice fly that
scored Amaro.
Stanford extended the lead in the
seventh inning. Verducci led off with
a single and moved to second on a
wild pitch. Amaro doubled and went
to third on an error to score Verducci.
That chased Fresno's Goff from the
mound. Ramos followed with an RBI
single. After Lundblade walked,
Deßenon singled Ramos home to
raise the Cardinal lead to 8-2.
After that, it was Ballard's pitching
that held the Bulldogs in check for
the remainder of the game. "He
(Ballard) can be sharper," Marquess
said, "but he had good control
(today)."
Mark Davis closed out the scoring
with a leadoff homer, his third of the
year, in the bottom of the eighth in
ning.
The Cardinal squelched two Fresno
State rally attempts in the eighth and
ninth innings with two perfect
around-the-horn double plays started
by third baseman Ken Green. "We
played great defense today . . . fan
tastic," Marquess said.
Saturday's game, at Fresno, was a

different situation. It was a clear ex
ample of how pitching and hitting
must balance in order for a team to
win. Bulldog pitcher Ken Crew held
the Cardinal to three hits and Fresno
State coasted to a 7-2 victory.
Marquess said, "He (Crew) stuck it to
us pretty good."
Stanford starter Jack McDowell
had a game in which he didn't pitch
badly, but also didn't have a few
breaks go his way. The loss dropped
McDowell's record to 1-2. Two other
freshman pitchers, Lee Plemel and
Ugo Colella, got a little work during
the latter stages of the contest.
Davis, Harris and Stanicek were
the only Cardinal players able to mar
Crew's pitching performance with
hits. Davis and Verducci were
credited with Stanford's two RBIs.
Marquess said about the two games

in Fresno, "We essentially traded
great pitching performances." He was
able to say that because of Rob Was
senaar's effort on the hill in the series
opener on Friday.
"Wassenaar kind of handled
them," Marquess said. He and Dietz
combined for an eight-hitter en route
to an 8-4 victory. Along the way the
two Stanford pitchers also struck out
12 Bulldogs — Wassenaar lead the
way with 10 whiffs.
Stanford jumped out to a 3-0 lead
in the third inning and never looked
back. Lundblade and Deßenon led
the way, each driving in two runs.
Ramos, Harris and Davis rapped two
hits apiece off three Fresno State
pitchers.
The victory improved Wassenaar's
record to 2-0 and Dietz tallied an
other save.

credited with Stanford's two RBIs.
Marquess said about the two games

in Fresno, "We essentially traded
great pitching performances." He was
able to say that because of Rob Was
senaar's effort on the hill in the series
opener on Friday.
"Wassenaar kind of handled
them," Marquess said. He and Dietz
combined for an eight-hitter en route
to an 8-4 victory. Along the way the
two Stanford pitchers also struck out
12 Bulldogs — Wassenaar lead the
way with 10 whiffs.
Stanford jumped out to a 3-0 lead
in the third inning and never looked
back. Lundblade and Deßenon led
the way, each driving in two runs.
Ramos, Harris and Davis rapped two
hits apiece off three Fresno State
pitchers.
The victory improved Wassenaar's
record to 2-0 and Dietz tallied an
other save.

The players on the Stanford bench tried to help out their teammates on Sunday with a bit of superstitious hat
twisting that produced what are known as "rally caps."

Cardinal third baseman Ruben Amaro prepares to high-five teammate
Rick Lundblade (No. 15) after the first home run of his collegiate career
yesterday. The homer, which just barely cleared the fence in right
center field, came in the fifth inning and gave Stanford a 10-5 lead.
Amaro's heroics came on the heels of a fine 3-for-3 performance in Sun
day's game against Fresno State.
