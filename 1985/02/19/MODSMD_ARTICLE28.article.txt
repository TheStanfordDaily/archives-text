## Cardinal gymnasts produce top finishes 
### CAROLYN TARKINGTON Staff sportswriter 
Senior Merilyn Cfeipman and junior Randy Be
sosa put in excellent performances to lead the Stan
ford men and women's gymnastics teams to first
and second place team finishes this weekend.
The women made a clean sweep in the second
annual Cardinal Classic, finishing first as a team
and taking firsts on all four events, including the
all-around, which Chapman won with a 37.10 total.
In the men's five-way competition at Berkeley,
the Cardinal team finished second to California,
totaling a team score only .05 of a point off last
week's team record.
"After Friday's performance we'll be unofficially
ranked in the top 10 for the second week in a row,"
Women's Coach Homer Sardina said. "Our team
depth and improved consistency is starting to pay
off for us."
The Cardinal women easily beat lOth-ranked
Washington with a total of 182.30 points. The
Huskies scored 179.00, while San Diego State and
California totaled 176.40 and 175.60 respectively.
In the individual events. Chapman took a first
and third place on floor and beam with scores of
9.30 and 9.35, respectively, and tied Stanford
sophomore Nanci Goldsmith for first on bars with a
9.50. Goldsmith also placed first on beam with a
9.50, and freshman Beth Pope set a new Stanford
record in placing first on vault with a 9.60.
In the men's competition, Stanford finished with
a 277.60 team total, second to the Bears' 279.15.
Behind them were San Jose State (253.40), Long

Beach City College (248.85), UC-Davis (228.10)
and Washington (183.45).
"It was a bit of a surprise that California heat us.
They scored almost eight points better than they
did against us last time," Coach Sadao Hamada
said. "It would have been nice to beat them again,
but they really hit well this time, so they deserved
to win. Our main concern was to score a 275.00
total or better at an away meet, and we accom
plished that. I'm really proud of the team."
Hamada said that the downfall of the team's per
formance was on the pommel horse. There were
more misses than hits, except for freshman Chuck
Gerardo's 9.30 performance and second-place
finish.
In the other individual events, junior Jon Levy
placed first and second on rings and high bar with a
9.60 and a 9.75. Freshman Mike Matzek and soph
omore Mark Arnold tied for third on rings with
9.405. Junior Gary Smith placed third on vault with
a 9.55.'
Besosa had an excellent meet, placing second in
the rings, parallel bars and the all-around with
scores of 9.45, 9.40 and 56.45, respectively. Besosa
was first on the high bar with 9.85 points.
Besosa's 9.85 high bar routine was the high score
of the meet and a personal individual event record.
It also tied Stanford's high bar record set by Levy
last year.
The women were to compete against No. 8-
ranked UCLA and No. 1-ranked Utah over the
weekend, but had to cancel that meet because of
flights fogged in at San Francisco International Air
port.
