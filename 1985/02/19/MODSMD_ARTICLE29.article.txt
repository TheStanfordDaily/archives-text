# Swimmers dunk Cal
## Card closes out with win 
### INGRID SEYER Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford women's swimming
team ended its dual-meet season with
a 5-1 record as it defeated California
77-63 Saturday at Berkeley.
"I was quite pleased with the per
formance of the team," Coach
George Haines said. "It was awfully
close, but we won the meet, and that's
what it really comes down to in the
end."
Before Stanford pulled away
strongly near the end of the meet, the
score was tied twice and the lead
changed hands five times. It wasn't
until the 200-yard backstroke that
the Cardinal actually began to break
away from the Bears, now 7-3, and
take control of the meet.
Trailing 40-39, Stanford went one
two in the 200 backstoke with Patty
Gavin and Jennifer Pokluda to take a
47-41 lead. Stanford's Kathy Smith
went on to win the 200 breaststroke
with a season-best 2:17.45, followed
by a one-two Cardinal victory in the
500 freestyle with Marybeth

Linzmeier and Stacy Shupe. The vic
tories in these two events opened up a
60-46 lead for Stanford.
Although California won the 100
butterfly and the 200 freestyle relay,
the Cardinal's one-two victories in
the 400 individual medley (Gavin and
Jenny Rapp) and 3-meter diving
(Kim Jones and Jean Meyer) helped
to seal the Stanford victory.
Earlier in the meet Jones and
Sharon Daly went one-two in the 1-
meter diving competition with scores
of 241.20 and 236.25, respectively.
The Cardinal swimmers also went
one-two in both the 100 backstroke
(Pokluda and Gavin) and the 1,000
freestyle (Linzmeier and Lisa Hazen)
earlier in the meet.
Stanford swimmers not only led the
Cardinal to its 25th victory in the last
27 outings, but also set 10 season
best and one personal-best times
during the meet.
Smith lowered her previous
lifetime best of 1:02.90 in the 100
breaststroke to 1:02.42 as she won
the event for the Cardinal. Smith also

had a season-best swim in the 100
breaststroke.
"Kathy's swim in the 100
breaststroke was outstanding,"
Haines said. "I was very happy with
her performance that event and in the
200 breaststroke. She really came
through when we needed her."
Other Cardinal swimmers to have
season-best times were Linzmeier
(9:49.07) and Hazen (10:05.73) in
the 1,000 freestyle, Lisa Buese in the
200 freestyle (1:53.47), Pokluda
(57.90) and Gavin (58.49) in the 100
backstroke, Diana Zock in the 50
freestyle (23.82) and Jenny Rapp in
the 400 I.M. (4:25.00).
The 200 freestyle relay also had a
season-hest time ( 1:35.37) while
meeting the NCAA cut-off time of
1:35.79.
The Cardinal will compete in the
Western Collegiate Athletic Associa
tion Championships March 1 and 2
and in two invtiatonal meets before
advancing to the NCAA Champion
ships March 21-23 at Alabama.
