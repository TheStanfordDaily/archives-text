Visiting Emeritus Music Prof. John Robinson
Pierce has been named one of two recipients of a
prestigious new prize from the Japanese govern
ment.
Pierce and Prof. Ephraim Katzir of the Weiz
mann Institute in Israel will each receive 50 million
yen — approximately $190,000 — for "significant
and revolutionary achievements of originality" in
science and technology. The Japan Prize is spon
sored by the Science and Technology Foundation
of Japan.
"It is very encouraging," Pierce told The Daily.
"I am not a wealthy man. This will give me more
freedom in my life."
"I've admired Japan and the Japanese," he said.
"1 feel particularly honored and pleased to receive
this award."

Founders of the Japan Prize hope the award will
someday rival the Nobel Prizes in prestige.
Pierce is noted for his continuous involvement in
and advancement of satellite communications. He
designed Echo I, the first communication satellite,
which was launched by the United States Aug. 12,
1960.
Pierce was also instrumental in the launching of
Telestar I on July 10, 1962, which transmitted the
first live television signals across the Atlantic
Ocean.
Science-fiction authur Arthur Clarke is
recognized as the instigator of these satellites. In
1945, Clarke suggested that orbiting satellites
could serve as relays for radio transmissions.
Pierce is also noted for his contributions in the
field of computer music. He is currently ex
perimenting with sound perception at the Center
for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics

(CCRMA).
Pierce is collaborating with Earl Schubert, a pro
fessor of surgery at the Stanford Medical Center,
on experiments in pitch. He is also trying to
develop a new musical scale.
Pierce's inventions include the Pierce Gun, a
vacuum tube that transmits electrons, and the
Pierce Ring, which interconnects data communica
tions systems. The Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center uses the Pierce Gun in the klystrons that
power its accelerator.
Before coming to Stanford in December 1983,
Pierce worked for Bell Labs, in Murray Hill, N.J.,
for 35 years. He then went to the California In
stitute of Technology in 1971 and retired in 1980.
He was the chief technologist at Cal Tech's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory during 1982
and 1983.
Katzir, a former president of Israel,
is an expert in enzymes and biotech

nology.
The prizes will be awarded in
Tokyo in April by Konosuke Matsus
hita, the chairman of the Japan Prize.
The prime minister, the Ministry of
Education and the Ministry for
Foreign Affairs direct the efforts to
choose the recipients.
