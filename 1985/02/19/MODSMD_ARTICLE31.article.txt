## Men's volleyball Cardinal spikes Cal, Chico St. 
### ROB GRAHAM Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford men's volleyball
team, ranked sixth in the nation,
beefed up its overall record over the
weekend with non-league victories
over California and Chico State, both
dub teams.
On Friday, the men traveled to
Chico and hammered the Wildcats in
three sets. The Cardinal returned to
Maples Pavillion Saturday evening
and, playing before a large crowd left
from the afternoon basketball game,
took Cal 15-8, 15-9, 15-8. The loss
dropped the Bears to 10-8.
Cardinal Co-coach Don Shaw,
whose team is now 14-4 overall and
still 3-3 in California Intercollegiate
Volleyball Association play, used the
matches to rest some of his tired
starters and give his bench playing
time. "It's been a rough two or three
weeks," Shaw said. "We have some
nagging injuries and we really appre
ciate this little break. Besides, game
time is always helpful."
Shaw felt the weekend matches
went according to plan. "We played
pretty well," he said. "But we were a
little lethargic. We played silent vol
leyball — and we really do have to
communicate out there." Despite the
silence, though, Shaw said, "We
really controlled the matches."
The two gimmmies at least gave the
men a chance to relax and enjoy
playing volleyball. Shaw has feared
that especially after its surprise vic
tory in the Santa Barbara/Michelob
Light Invitational, his squad has
taken itself too seriously. "We're still
learning how to concentrate on the
right things out there and not dwell
on our mistakes."
If the many smiles on the Stanford
bench were any indication, the Card
inal was indeed concentrating on the
right things. Junior Brett Monello, an

outside hitter, was so entertained, in
fact, that at the end of the third game
against California he tried to serve
out the set from atop a rickety table
behind the court. Though Monello
was up to the task, the table was not
and collapsed before he could get his
serve away.
After his regulars had staked Stan
ford to a two-sets-to-none lead, Shaw
inserted some substitutes. Freshmen
Mark Amstutz and Brad Nelson, in
particular, came off the pine to log
some playing time. "Their job is al
most just as important to our effort as
the guys who are out there on the
floor," Shaw said.
Sophomore Stephen Blue, an
outside hitter/middle blocker who
will replace members of the front line
in the event of an injury, also contrib
uted in the second and third sets of
Saturday's contest, showing that
Stanford has some depth.
The Cardinal's next action is
Thursday at 4 p.m. at Maples against
visiting Hawaii, 0-1 in the CIVA. The
teams meet again the following even
ing at 7.
"We used these matches (Cal and
Chico) to prepare for Hawaif," said
Shaw. The Cardinal, which lost twice
last year to the Rainbows on the road,
is looking to avenge those defeats and
at the same time solidify its hold on
fifth place in the CIVA.
Currently, Stanford trails league
leaders USC (4-0), UCLA (3-0),
Fepperdine (2-0) and UC-Santa Bar
bara (4-2). The top four teams in the
CIVA will advance to the Western
Regionals, meaning that the Cardinal
finds itself in a must-win situation for
the rest of its conference schedule.
The next CIVA game for the Stan
ford after this week's matches against
Hawaii will be against Pepperdine in
Maples Pavilion on March 6.
