# Golfers take fourth
## Robinson wins Burns Invitational 
### KEN STEVENS Staff sportswriter 
Shooting consecutive 70s on the par-72 Mid-
Pacific Golf Course, Stanford senior Tim Robinson
captured his first individual championship of the
season and led the Cardinal men to a fourth-place
finish at the rain-shortened John Burns Intercol
legiate in Kailua, Hawaii last week.
While Stanford's top five were playing in Hawaii,
the second five took first place at the Silverado In
vitational in Napa on Friday. Sophomores Rich
Marik and Cole Thompson tied for individual
honors at 147 in the one-day 36-hole tournament.
A rainout of Thursday's second round forced the
scheduled 54-hole John Burns Intercollegiate to be
reduced to a 36-hole tournament. The postpone
ment had little effect on Robinson's game,
however, as he finished at 140, one shot ahead of

Lamar's Trevor Dodds and Fresno State's Kevin
Sutherland.
As a team the Cardinal finished at 584, five shots
in back of tournament champion Lamar. San Jose
State captured second place at 580 and Arkansas
finished in third place at 582.
Robinson has played consistently well through
out the season and last week's victory improves his
chances of gaining All-America honors again, ac
cording to Stanford Head Coach Tim Schaaf.
"I think the best thing (about the Burns Intercol
legiate) was that Tim (Robinson) won the tourna
ment," Schaaf said. "Getting a win in there really
improves his credentials."
Schaaf was pleased with the team's play in
Hawaii. "I was a little disappointed in the fact that
we finished fourth ... but not in the way we
played," he said. "We played well enough to

win. .. . The teams that finished ahead of us were
very good."
The competition was not as strong at the Sil
verado Invitational, but Schaaf was nevertheless
satisfied with the second team's victory. The Card
inal shot 766, finishing five shots ahead of Califor
nia* t-
Because the Cardinal had five golfers playing in
Hawaii at the same time, the team was only able to
send five men to Napa. While the other teams were
able to drop their low score, Stanford had to count
each of its scores. These circumstances allowed the
Cardinal "no margin for error," according to
Schaaf, yet the team came away victorious.
Due to a cancellation in this weekend's Lamar
Invitational, the Cardinal men have two weeks off
before resuming action March 7-8 in the
Sacramento State Invitational at Rancho Murieta.
