# Sub netters beat No. 8 LSU, 8-1
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
After the Stanford men's tennis
team's 5-4 victory over eighth
ranked Louisiana State Thursday,
Coach Dick Gould fielded his
"second string" against winless
Santa Clara Friday afternoon.
Stanford won handily, 8-1, and
extended its record to 8-0. But for
the shortest moment of moments,
it appeared Gould's strategy of
resting five of the seven netters
who played against LSU might
backfire.
Early in the opening set of the
six singles matches, no fewer than
three Cardinal netters trailed â€”
Eric Rosenfeld at No. 1, Jeremy
Semple at No. 5 and Darryl Lee at
No. 6.
"Yeah, it was tough," Gould
said after Rosenfeld, Semple and
Lee all recovered to win in straight
sets. "The problem is the guys are
getting a chance to play and
there's an amazing amount of
pressure on them to do well, to
impress the coach."
Though four of the first singles
sets were decided by two games or
fewer, the Cardinal recovered
enough from its early problems to
win three of them. The only Stan
ford loss came at No. 4 singles,
where Santa Clara's Don Ballow
beat Paul Robinson 7-6, 6-3.
Although Stanford swept the
doubles, Gould expressed skep
ticism about his doubles teams this
season. "I'm not sure our doubles

combinations are right yet," he
said. "I'm really not sure about
second and third doubles. We just
can't afford to lose second and
third doubles every time we play a
tough match."
That's exactly what happened
against LSU, as the No. 2 team of
Rosenfeld and Patrick McEnroe
and the No. 3 team of Dan Goldie
and Scott Moody both lost.
Against Santa Clara, Gould
tried some new combinations. The
No. 1 and No. 3 teams won easily,
but the No. 2 team of Mark Jacob
son and Rod Coull struggled
before winning 6-2, 2-6, 6-1.
Gould said his top doubles team
of Jim Grabb and John Letts may
be the best in the country.
However, he also said he may con
sider breaking up the duo to give
the Cardinal better overall
doubles play.
Stanford gets a week off from
dual matches, but not from indi
vidual competition, as it plays in
the Northern California Intercol
legiates at San Jose State through
Thursday.
Players from all the Bay Area
schools are arranged in a huge lad
der, with each victory scoring a
point for the player's school. All
six Stanford entrants received first
round byes, so they will get two
points if they win their second
round matches today.
Gould said Goldie probably will
miss the NorCals because he will
be playing in a singles tournament
in La Quinta.
