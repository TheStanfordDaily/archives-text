## Runners fall short in Va. 
### PAT FOX 
The Stanford men's distance runners took to the road
this weekend for the Bud Light Indoor Track Invitational
at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va. As team cap
tain Jeff Atkinson put it,"It was a long way to travel for
such a mediocre performance," echoing the disappoint
ment of failing to qualify for the national indoor meet.
Competing in the distance medley, the Cardinal dem
onstrated its depth, speed and tenacity by fighting for a
down-to-the-tape third place. Running a time of 9:49, the
team just missed the national standard of 9:43.
Leading off for Stanford was senior Brian Pettingill on
the 800-meter leg. Pettingill, finding himself in the first
lane with a full-turn stagger, was in danger of being boxed
in before the gun even sounded.
Pettingill said, "I went out as hard as 1 could and
thought I could beat the guy to the straight. But instead of
being aggressive I let him have the inside position in a mo
ment of tentativeness. 1 won't let it happen again."
But biding his time, he waited for the small opening he
needed and Hew out of the hole in hot pursuit of the
leader. Showing a fine kick, he brought the Cardinal in at
the half in second place with a 1:52.2, handing the baton
to Terry Parks for the 400 leg.
Parks headed out into the first turn with speed no one in
the field could match. Running smoothly and relaxed, he
gained on the leader and ground him into the track,
sprinting the Cardinal into the lead.
Freshman Steve Schadler then took the baton down the
track for his 1,200 leg of the medley, and held his own

against the older and more experienced field.
Coming through with 400 meters to go, the Cardinal
was still hanging tough, now in the middle of the pack.
Schadler fought through the last quarter and handed off to
senior Jeff Atkinson in heavy traffic, leaving Stanford
with some fighting left to do. Schadler recorded a fine split
for a newcomer to the collegiate scene of 3:04.
Atkinson, taking the baton on its last trips around the
track for the 1,600, found himself 30 meters behind the
frontrunning pack of four. Running intelligently, he
slowly pulled Stanford back up to the pack with 800
meters remaining in the race. Having tired himself in the
chase, he momentarily lost concentration, leaving himself
behind the pack by 10 meters.
Atkinson said, "I was feeling sorry for myself with a lap
to go, so I got my shit together and walked them down."
Shifting gears once more with only half a lap remaining,
Atkinson fought through the pack and outleaned the
nearest competitor for third place, leaving himself with a
4:06 split and the Cardinal with 9:49 overall. Atkinson
summed up the team's feelings, "I was marginally satisfied
with my race, but since the team failed to qualify, I guess
I'm generally disappointed."
Also running for Stanford this weekend in Fairfax was
junior Ryan Stoll in the 3,000 meters. Stoll competed in a
race featuring seven Olympic athletes. Stoll. one of only
two American collegians in the race, fought hard through
the first mile, clocking a 4:20 split. He managed to finish
with a respectable 8:19.
