## Scholarships help to conquer social ills 
### GEORGE LeMAITRE 
University President Donald Ken
nedy s emphasis on public service
during the past two years has given
rise to three separate public-service
scholarships designed to give students
the chance to work in the public sec
tor without financial hardship.
Graduates and undergraduates are
eligible to apply for stipends sponsor
ing jobs in the public sector after
graduation, summer internships in
Washington, D.C., and self-designed
community projects.
The John Gardner Fellowship Pro
gram, new in 1985, will provide three
graduating seniors from Stanford and
three from Berkeley with a $12,000
stipend each for 11 months work in
government or voluntary agencies. A
top-level mentor from the public sec
tor will be matched with each
recipient.
The fellowship is named to honor
John Gardner, a former secretary of
the Department of Health, Education
and Welfare and an alumnus of both
Stanford and Berkeley.
Initial funding for the program will
come from a gift from the Walter and
Elise Hass fund. Program coordinator
Jeanne Halleck said continued fund
ing is still being sought for the future.
Applicants for the scholarships will
be judged on the basis of "leadership
potential, interest in and a committ
ment to public services, a sense of en
thusiasm and previous activity," Hal
leck said. . ,

Application for the Gardner fel
lowships are due by March 15.
Awards will be announced by April
12.
Another fellowship program will
offer undergraduates the chance to
work in Washington, D.C. for the
summer. Fellows will have intern
ships with the Office of Technology
Assessment, Sen. Edward Kennedy
(D-Mass.), the House Judiciary Com
mittee and the House Rules Commit
tee.
For the second consecutive year,
Stanford-ln-Government (SIG) will
offer these undergraduate fellow
ships. The winners will receive
$1,000 stipends from SIG.
The third public-service scholar
ship is earmarked for student
designed community service projects.
Students can apply for fellowships of
up to $1,200 for work on community
problems at the local, state, national
or international level.
Funds for the program are pro
vided through the Public Service
Center in Owen House. Both under
graduates and graduates may propose
eight-week projects for this summer.

Fourteen students participated in
the program last summer on projects
ranging from teaching junior high
students in East Palo Alto to working
for Mother Teresa in Calcutta, India.
Last year was the first year the
student-designed public-service fel
lowships were awarded. Kennedy
praised the participating students for
making the programs a success.
"With the enormously positive
response (to the program), the stu
dents have told us clearly that our
faith in them is more than justified,"
he said.
Project coordinator Rudy
Rodriguez, who was a 1984 public
service fellow, said, "The fellowships
help students who want very much to
serve but who need the financial as
sistance as well as the legitimization
which a Stanford fellowship pro
vides."
Project applications for the
student-designed public-service in
ternships are due April 12 and are
available at Owen House.
