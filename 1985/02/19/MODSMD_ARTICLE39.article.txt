## SURE seeks to avoid a 'macho' image 
### TRACEY BANKS 
As a result of fear that a male
dominated staff promotes sexism,
Stanford United for Rape Elimina
tion (SURE) is actively recruiting
women to drive irtf" evening escort
carts.
"Feminists had raised some con
cerns that we would become sort of a
macho organization," said Andy
Frisch, director of SURE. "If we just
have men employees, we're saying
Hey, we're men; we have to protect
women.' That fosters the kinds of at
titudes that can cause rape," he said.
Zoe Sutton, currently the only
female driver for SURE, said she
agrees with this analysis. Sutton said
her job is two-fold: In addition to
providing a service for women, she
hopes to help people understand that
rape and sexism are related.
"I wanted to educate any of the
men I might be working with about
feminism," Sutton said. She added
many men are under the misconcep
tion that "rape is terrible, but not
connected to sexism."
Although the Women's Center did
not specifically request that SURE
hire more women, staff member
Jennifer Watson expressed the same
concerns as Frisch and Sutton.
"SURE can be looked at as kind of a
protection racket — men protecting
women from other men," Watson
said. She said the Women's Center
was involved only indirectly with the

recruitment efforts, but she is pleased
with the change.
Recruiting women is not the only
goal SURE members have set for
themselves. Frisch said SURE is
striving to continue raising the num
ber of calls it gets each night.
Calls for escorts have risen from an
average of seven per evening to 14
since last year, Frisch said. He attri
butes the increase to greater knowl

edge of the potential dangers in the
Stanford community. "I think it's just
a general awareness about security,"
he said.
Frisch pointed out that SURE
picks up a majority of its riders at its
regular library stops each night. Thus
SURE serves more than just 14 stu
dents per night, he said.
Frisch said SURE is planning to
launch a publicity campaign to ensure

that calls continue to go up.
"We're trying to get more involved
with the Women's Center and other
groups that should be involved with
us," he said. These groups include
SWOPSI self-defense classes and
Aurora, the feminist newspaper.
Frisch says he hopes to help these or
ganizations to "sponsor some kind of
forums on rape or rape-related is
sues."
