# COP gives up on Berg recall
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
In a surprising turn of events yes
terday, the Council of Presidents
withdrew its petition to recall ASSU
Senate Chair Eric Berg and expressed
a willingness "to work together with
the senate in order to resolve the
problems that led to this incident."
The decision to end the recall was
reached at a Saturday meeting of the
COP, Berg and some members of the
senate, according to a statement
issued yesterday by the three
member COP.
"The Council regrets launching a
personal attack which could have
damaged Eric Berg's reputation," the
statement said, adding that "the
ASSU plans to improve communica
tions between the executive and
legislative branches."
And in a special session Friday, the
senate voted to override a COP veto
of a measure to split the Band's
budget into separate fee assessment
requests on the spring quarter ASSU
ballot.
Present at the meeting Saturday
were the members of the COP, Berg,
and five senators: Jim McGrath, Sue
Uhland, Jim Delahunt, B.G. Porter
and Carey White. Also in attendance
was former COP member Mark Van
Tresca, who held the position four
years ago, according to McGrath.
McGrath said those at the meeting
agreed there "was a lack of communi
cation between the principles," add
ing that the participants were
"forthright and honest" about their
complaints.
As result of the Saturday meeting,
McGrath said each branch of the
ASSU will probably endeavor to
make sure that the lines of communi
cation will be open.
COP member Melissa Auchard
said that the move to withdraw the
petition was"clearly our own deci
sion."
"We felt good about the conversa
tion that occurred and needed to oc
cur," she said. Auchard called the
outcome of the whole affair
"positive," although "the personal
attack was unfortunate."
Berg said he thought the COP
members had "pretty much already
come to that conclusion (to retract
the petition) before they came to the
meeting."
Berg said he is "more convinced
that it will be possible" to work with

the COP now than he thought possi
ble after the petition drive was
launched last week.
The petition was issued Wednesday
by Auchard, David Porter and Todd
Kerr. At the time, Porter told The
Daily that Berg had politicized "what
should be an apolitical position. . . .
A senate chair who is political can use
that position to decide the fate of
most bills. He hasn't been apolitical,
and he's used his power to affect deci
sions."
Berg called the petition a case "of
sour grapes" initiated by a
"frustrated" COP that had seen a
number of its proposals defeated on
the senate floor.
At the Friday meeting, the
senate overrode the COP's veto of a
senate order calling for the reorgani
zation of the Band's budget. Mo
ments later, the meeting was closed to
the press and general public for
debate on the COP-backed petition
asking for the removal of Berg.
Before the session closed. Berg
made a lengthy statement defending
himself as senate chair, stating that he
had invested "a substantial amount of
my time, energy and talent" in the
position.
He also criticized the COP-backed
petition, telling the senate that the
COP's argument should "be with the
senate rather than with me."
Of the COP's charge that Berg has
politicized the senate chair, Berg
responded that he was never aware
that the position was supposed to be
apolitical.
"It was not my understanding of
the position when 1 sought it,"he
said. He said the complaint "seems to
be not that I'm too political, but too
effective," often preventing the pas
sage of COP-backed proposals.
Because the senate has refused to
pass many COP motions, the COP
"solution is simple: Get rid of Eric,"
Berg said. He said he was "quite
prepared to face the recall campaign
David and Melissa have initiated
against me."
Berg then told the senate he would
resign his position if senators felt that
would be best. He called for a vote by
secret ballot to determine his fate.
According to one senator who
asked not to be identified, the senate
voted 16-to-l in support of Berg
during the closed session.
