On Feb. 13, The Daily incorrectly
reported a number of facts regarding
the Board of Trustees. The trustees
serve five-year terms and can serve
for more than two terms as long as
there is a hiatus of at least one year
after every second term. Finally, the
board meets eight times each year.
The Daily regrets the errors.
