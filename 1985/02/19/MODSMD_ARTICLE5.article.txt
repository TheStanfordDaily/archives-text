Law Prof. Marc Franklin, an expert on media
law, said he believes retired Gen. William
Westmoreland made a wise decision this
weekend when he abandoned his $120 million
libel suit against CBS. The decision came after
18 weeks of testimony and millions of dollars in v
legal expenses.
"Somewhere along the way things started
turning sour for him," Franklin said. "If he just
walked away from it (rather than signing an
agreement with CBS) . . . the judge would have
declared CBS the victor."
Had CBS won, Westmoreland could have
been forced to pay about $200,000 in court fees
that CBS incurred. This does not include attor
ney fees, which cannot be recovered. Franklin
said. Under the terms of the agreement, CBS
will not ask Westmoreland to pay any of its legal
fees, and CBS will not apologize to
Westmoreland or pay him damages for the al
leged libel.
Both sides claimed vindication but not vic
tory.
"Winning and losing is part of the story, but
it's not the whole thing." Franklin said.
Even though Westmoreland dropped the
case, he "got what he wanted," Franklin said,
referring to CBS's statement that
Westmoreland, commander of U.S. ground
forces in Vietnam, was not disloyal and was
doing what he considered to be best for U.S. in
terests.
Likewise. CBS said it was vindicated because
Westmoreland had not shown that its 1982 doc

umentary, "The Uncounted Enemy: A Vietnam
Deception," was false.
"I have a guess on this: Westmoreland lost
control of his lawsuit," Franklin said.
To win the libel suit, Westmoreland would
have had to prove false the documentary's
charges that he purposely underestimated
enemy troop size in reports to President
Johnson, and that CBS perpetrated the fal
sehood with deliberate or reckless disregard for
the truth.
"I think Westmoreland had a hard road on
question one (falsity) and a nearly impossible
one on question two (deliberate or reckless dis
regard for the truth)," Franklin said.
Franklin noted parallels between
Westmoreland's case and former Israeli
Defense Minister Ariel Sharon's libel suit
against Time magazine. He said both CBS and
Time may have displayed some bias in their
reporting.
"It was clearly a slanted performance in both
cases." Franklin said.
But Franklin said he thinks "Time got it
wrong; CBS got it right."
In the Sharon case, the jury had to decide if
Time's allegations that Sharon discussed
revenge with the family of slain Lebanese Presi
dent Amin Gcmavel were true. The jury found
that they were not. and thus found that Sharon
had been defamed. But the jury did not find
deliberate or reckless disregard for the truth,
and Sharon lost his libel suit.
case . . . was a relatively precise
Franklin said.
In the Westmoreland case, however, the issue
was not precise, Franklin said. "Here
. . . we're trying to look at a course of
(Westmoreland's) conduct," he said.
Although many who follow libel
law hoped that the case would go to

jury, Franklin said he is no more dis
appointed about the suit being
dropped than he is about the world
chess championship being cancelled.
But, he said, "It's painful that it has
taken $7 million to reach this conclu
sion."
"The case just ran out of control,"
Franklin said. "I'm sure there will be
autopsies in the weeks to come."
