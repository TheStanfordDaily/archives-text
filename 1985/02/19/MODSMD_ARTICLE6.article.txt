South African prelate acquitted
PRETORIA. South Africa — Archbishop Denis Hurley, president of
the Southern African Catholic Bishops Conference, was acquitted here
yesterday of charges that he defamed a special counterinsurgency police
unit in Namibia by accusing it of continuing atrocities, including the
murders of suspected opponents of the government there.
In a case widely seen as an attempt to silence the Roman Catholic
Church in its outspoken criticism of South Africa's apartheid policies of
racial segregation, the state prosecutor announced at the start of Hur
ley's trial in Pretoria regional court that the government had no evidence
to back its charges. Some of Hurley's harshest comments, the original
basis for the case, had been exaggerated by the press and misquoted
after a news conference here two years ago, the prosecutor said.
Magistrate W. J. Vandenbergh promptly acquitted Hurley, 70, who
might have been sentenced to five years in prison and fined $5,000 if
convicted under a South African law making deliberate defamation of
the police a crime.
Despite widespread international opposition. South Africa continues
to administer Namibia, also known as South-West Africa, under an
outdated United Nations mandate.
Frans Roets, the prosecutor, made no attempt to defend the coun
terinsurgency unit against the allegations of continuing atrocities but
said Hurley, the archbishop of Durban, had "wallowed in the glamor at
tributed to him" by the case.
Hurley said later that he hoped his acquittal would help bring an end
to the alleged atrocities by the 2,000-man Koevoet police unit in
Namibia and also to the continuing conflict in the territory where guer
rillas of the South-West Africa People's Organization have fought an
18-year war against South African rule.
Kuwaiti ship attacked
ABU DHABI ~ A Kuwaiti container ship was set ablaze yesterday
after being attacked by warplanes, believed to have been Iranian, north
of the United Arab Emirates coast.
The United Arab Emirates news agency WAM said salvage tugs had
reached the scene of the attack, about 90 miles from here, and that the
fire had been brought under control.
The news agency said one seaman was missing but that there were no
injuries.
Shipping sources said the 35,616-ton ship was hit by a missile and can
non fire from a raiding plane that was believed to have been Iranian.
The area of the attack was way beyond the usual range of Iraqi jets,
prompting speculation about the possibility of a terrorist sabotage act for
the first time in the gulfs so-called tanker war, initiated by Iraq last year
in an attempt to throttle Iran's oil exports.
Iran, which does not announce retaliatory attacks on the Arab side of
the gulf, had unilaterally suspended its counterraids since late Decem
ber.
The Kuwaiti container ship was the 10th vessel hit in the gulf since the
beginning of last month-
Ii said the ship, flying the Kuwaiti flag, was heading from Bahrain to
Abu Dhabi when it came under attack.
The ship is owned by the United Arab Shipping Company. The share
holders are the governments of Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Oatar,
Bahrain and Iraq.
More Americans disappear
GUADALAJARA, Mexico — The disappearance of two more
Americans was reported to police here Saturday by friends who said the
missing men had not been seen for more than two weeks.
A spokesman for the American Consulate confirmed that U.S. offi
cials were aware of the case of John Walker, an American resident of
Guadalajara, and Alberto Radelat, who was visiting Walker from the
United States.
The reported disappearances come at a time when the U.S. Embassy
in Mexico remains concerned about the kidnapping in Guadalajara 10
days ago of an agent of the Drug Enforcement Administration and other
reports of violent crimes here involving American victims.
Radelat failed to show up as scheduled at a travel agency on Jan. 31 to
pick up an airline ticket to return home the following day, said Carlos
Turver, a friend of Walker who reported the disappearances to authori
ties.
Turver, a naturalized Mexican citizen, operates a sandwich shop called
Uncle Sam's Kitchen. He said Walker's landlady reported that the lights
had been left on in Walker's residence and that all his clothes were there.
He described Walker as a Vietnam veteran from Minnesota who had
been living in Guadalajara for about a year on his military disability pen
sion.
A U.S. consular officer who visited the residence found an open jar of
peanut butter on the table and other signs to indicate that Walker had
not intended to leave for a prolonged period. Walker's car is also gone.
Officials said they knew of no connection between the disappearances
and the kidnapping of Enrique Camarena, a American DEA agent who
remains the object of an intense police search throughout this western
Mexico city of 3.6 million residents.
Camarena, 37, was grabbed by armed men just a few yards from the
U.S. Consulate in the middle of the day, moments after leaving the
building to meet his wife for lunch. He was seen being put into a waiting
car that sped away.
The U.S. Embassy is now considering asking the State Department to
issue a travel advisory for Guadalajara and the nearby Pacific resort of
Puerto Vallarta.
U.S. hostage sentenced to death
BEIRUT. Lebanon — Concern for four Americans still missing in
Lebanon rose Saturday when the shadowy group that claims to hold
them captive said one of the four has been sentenced to death.
Meanwhile, former world heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad
Ali arrived in Beirut after a flight from Paris, hoping to meet with the
kidnappers in a bid to seek release of the hostages.
"With respect to the people who are keeping the hostages, we have to
keep what's on our mind quiet 'til we meet the right people," Ali said.
He did not say who they were.
Last week, one of the Americans missing here, Cable News Network
correspondent Jeremy Levin, said he escaped from the kidnappers in
Lebanon's Bekaa valley after 11 months in captivity.
Levin was turned over to American authorities in Damascus by the
Syrian government Friday and flew to Weisbaden, West Germany,
where he was reunited with his wife and family.
The four Americans still missing are William Buckley, a U.S.
diplomat; Benjamin Weir, a Presbyterian minister, Peter Kilburn, a li
brarian at the American University of Beirut, and Father Lawrence
Jenco, head of the Catholic Relief Services offices here.
An anonymous caller claiming to represent the group known as Is
lamic Jihad (Islamic Holy War), which claims to hold the Americans, said
Saturday that Levin had been released and that he did not escape.
"As for the other detainees we are holding, one of them has been sen
tenced to death," the caller said.
When pressed for more information, the caller replied, "When he is
executed you will all know about it."
The caller said Levin's release was arranged after the intervention of
an American Moslem, whom he did not name, and after being found in
nocent by an Islamic court.

after being attacked by warplanes, believed to have been Iranian, north
of the United Arab Emirates coast.
The United Arab Emirates news agency WAM said salvage tugs had
reached the scene of the attack, about 90 miles from here, and that the
fire had been brought under control.
The news agency said one seaman was missing but that there were no
injuries.
Shipping sources said the 35,616-ton ship was hit by a missile and can
non fire from a raiding plane that was believed to have been Iranian.
The area of the attack was way beyond the usual range of Iraqi jets,
prompting speculation about the possibility of a terrorist sabotage act for
the first time in the gulfs so-called tanker war, initiated by Iraq last year
in an attempt to throttle Iran's oil exports.
Iran, which does not announce retaliatory attacks on the Arab side of
the gulf, had unilaterally suspended its counterraids since late Decem
ber.
The Kuwaiti container ship was the 10th vessel hit in the gulf since the
beginning of last month-
Ii said the ship, flying the Kuwaiti flag, was heading from Bahrain to
Abu Dhabi when it came under attack.
The ship is owned by the United Arab Shipping Company. The share
holders are the governments of Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Oatar,
Bahrain and Iraq.
More Americans disappear
GUADALAJARA, Mexico — The disappearance of two more
Americans was reported to police here Saturday by friends who said the
missing men had not been seen for more than two weeks.
A spokesman for the American Consulate confirmed that U.S. offi
cials were aware of the case of John Walker, an American resident of
Guadalajara, and Alberto Radelat, who was visiting Walker from the
United States.
The reported disappearances come at a time when the U.S. Embassy
in Mexico remains concerned about the kidnapping in Guadalajara 10
days ago of an agent of the Drug Enforcement Administration and other
reports of violent crimes here involving American victims.
Radelat failed to show up as scheduled at a travel agency on Jan. 31 to
pick up an airline ticket to return home the following day, said Carlos
Turver, a friend of Walker who reported the disappearances to authori
ties.
Turver, a naturalized Mexican citizen, operates a sandwich shop called
Uncle Sam's Kitchen. He said Walker's landlady reported that the lights
had been left on in Walker's residence and that all his clothes were there.
He described Walker as a Vietnam veteran from Minnesota who had
been living in Guadalajara for about a year on his military disability pen
sion.
A U.S. consular officer who visited the residence found an open jar of
peanut butter on the table and other signs to indicate that Walker had
not intended to leave for a prolonged period. Walker's car is also gone.
Officials said they knew of no connection between the disappearances
and the kidnapping of Enrique Camarena, a American DEA agent who
remains the object of an intense police search throughout this western
Mexico city of 3.6 million residents.
Camarena, 37, was grabbed by armed men just a few yards from the
U.S. Consulate in the middle of the day, moments after leaving the
building to meet his wife for lunch. He was seen being put into a waiting
car that sped away.
The U.S. Embassy is now considering asking the State Department to
issue a travel advisory for Guadalajara and the nearby Pacific resort of
Puerto Vallarta.
U.S. hostage sentenced to death
BEIRUT. Lebanon — Concern for four Americans still missing in
Lebanon rose Saturday when the shadowy group that claims to hold
them captive said one of the four has been sentenced to death.
Meanwhile, former world heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad
Ali arrived in Beirut after a flight from Paris, hoping to meet with the
kidnappers in a bid to seek release of the hostages.
"With respect to the people who are keeping the hostages, we have to
keep what's on our mind quiet 'til we meet the right people," Ali said.
He did not say who they were.
Last week, one of the Americans missing here, Cable News Network
correspondent Jeremy Levin, said he escaped from the kidnappers in
Lebanon's Bekaa valley after 11 months in captivity.
Levin was turned over to American authorities in Damascus by the
Syrian government Friday and flew to Weisbaden, West Germany,
where he was reunited with his wife and family.
The four Americans still missing are William Buckley, a U.S.
diplomat; Benjamin Weir, a Presbyterian minister, Peter Kilburn, a li
brarian at the American University of Beirut, and Father Lawrence
Jenco, head of the Catholic Relief Services offices here.
An anonymous caller claiming to represent the group known as Is
lamic Jihad (Islamic Holy War), which claims to hold the Americans, said
Saturday that Levin had been released and that he did not escape.
"As for the other detainees we are holding, one of them has been sen
tenced to death," the caller said.
When pressed for more information, the caller replied, "When he is
executed you will all know about it."
The caller said Levin's release was arranged after the intervention of
an American Moslem, whom he did not name, and after being found in
nocent by an Islamic court.

South African prelate acquitted
PRETORIA. South Africa — Archbishop Denis Hurley, president of
the Southern African Catholic Bishops Conference, was acquitted here
yesterday of charges that he defamed a special counterinsurgency police
unit in Namibia by accusing it of continuing atrocities, including the
murders of suspected opponents of the government there.
In a case widely seen as an attempt to silence the Roman Catholic
Church in its outspoken criticism of South Africa's apartheid policies of
racial segregation, the state prosecutor announced at the start of Hur
ley's trial in Pretoria regional court that the government had no evidence
to back its charges. Some of Hurley's harshest comments, the original
basis for the case, had been exaggerated by the press and misquoted
after a news conference here two years ago, the prosecutor said.
Magistrate W. J. Vandenbergh promptly acquitted Hurley, 70, who
might have been sentenced to five years in prison and fined $5,000 if
convicted under a South African law making deliberate defamation of
the police a crime.
Despite widespread international opposition. South Africa continues
to administer Namibia, also known as South-West Africa, under an
outdated United Nations mandate.
Frans Roets, the prosecutor, made no attempt to defend the coun
terinsurgency unit against the allegations of continuing atrocities but
said Hurley, the archbishop of Durban, had "wallowed in the glamor at
tributed to him" by the case.
Hurley said later that he hoped his acquittal would help bring an end
to the alleged atrocities by the 2,000-man Koevoet police unit in
Namibia and also to the continuing conflict in the territory where guer
rillas of the South-West Africa People's Organization have fought an
18-year war against South African rule.
