# Unrest rocks South Africa
## 
### 
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Five
people were killed and more than 60 injured in a
black South African settlement yesterday as a
resurgence of racial unrest shook many parts of the
country.
The worst clashes were in Crossroads, outside
Cape Town, where residents reacted violently to a
government statement that sparked fears that they
were about to be removed from their homes.
Yesterday's violence, part of a flareup of distur
bances over a widening front in the past few days,
contributed to a growing sense that South Africa
may be in danger of sliding into a state of chronic
racial unrest.
Four months of major unrest, which subsided
briefly through January, followed the introduction
of a controversial new constitution last August.
Now some senior security officials are saying
privately that unrest must now be considered
"endemic" in some black areas, particularly ghetto

townships to the south and east of Johannesburg.
In Crossroads yesterday, riot police opened fire
with rubber bullets and birdshot. Tear-gas
launchers as well as helicopters hovered as angry
crowds gathered in the streets, with men refusing to
go to work because they said they feared their
families would be uprooted while they were away.
This followed a day of trouble in Katlehong
township, east of Johannesburg, Sunday, when
police opened fire on a crowd of 2,000 black resi
dents demons*'ating against the banning of a
meeting to protest a rent increase. Two of the
demonstrators were killed and one was wounded.
In a separate incident Sunday, rampaging stu
dents set fire to their school in a black township
outside the town of Kroonstad, in Orange Free
State province. The day before that, riot police
opened fire with shotguns on a crowd of striking
black workers at a gold mine west of Johannesburg,
wounding 100.
An undisclosed number of striking miners were

injured when police opened fire on them with rub
ber bullets at a colliery near Witbank in eastern
Transvaal Province on Saturday.
What worries security officials even more than
the violence in the ghetto townships is that the
trouble is spreading into the smaller towns of South
Africa's central farming areas — this country's
equivalent of the American Midwest — where for
generations the black communities have been iso
lated from the political consciousness of the cities.
Now, a number of these communities are also
staging angry demonstrations and clashing with
police.
Authorities fear that if this kind of trouble con
tinues to spread, the security resources of the ruling
white minority could start to become thinly
stretched.
There appears to be no single issue behind the
latest surge of unrest, except for a seemingly per
vasive mood of black anger.
