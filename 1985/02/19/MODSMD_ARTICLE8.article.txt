# Islamics raid Lebanese city
## 
### 
BEIRUT — Thousands of armed
Shiite Moslem militants and their
fundamentalist supporters descended
on the port city of Sidon yesterday,
tearing down the Lebanese flag and
calling for the Islamization of
Christian-led Lebanon and the over
throw of President Amin Gemayel.
Brandishing weapons and chanting
slogans against Gemayel, a Christian,
the demonstrators, who drove to
Sidon in a convoy of 300 cars and
buses, went on a rampage, smashing
liquor stores and demanding the crea
tion of an Iranian-style Islamic
republic, according to reports from
the city, 20 miles south of Beirut.
The demonstration, which ended
when the militants returned to their
Shiite sections of Beirut, came two
days after Israeli forces left Sidon in
the first stage of their withdrawal

from Lebanon and a day after Sidon's
residents gave Gemayel and other of
ficials of the central government a
jubilant welcome in their first visit to
Sidon since the Israeli occupation
began two-and-a-half years ago.
Troops of the Lebanese army, who
had moved into Sidon when the Is
raeli forces left, appeared powerless
to stop the rampaging militants yes
terday and made little attempt to in
tervene.
While the militants demonstrated,
the mainstream Shiite Moslem Amal
militia held a separate rally more in
tune with the expressed wishes of the
city's Christian and Moslem leaders
and the central government to
prevent communal hostilities in the
wake of the Israeli departure.
It is not clear yet whether yester
day's outbreak by the Shiites from

Beirut will cause tensions among the
communities in Sidon, where Moslem
and Christian leaders had agreed in
advance of the Israeli pullout to ban
armed militiamen from the streets
and to rely on the Lebanese army for
security. Sidon, Lebanon's third
largest city, has about 70,000 Sunni
Moslems, 20,000 Shiite Moslems and
10,000 Christians.
The gunmen who swarmed into
Sidon yesterday said they were mem
bers of Hezbollah, or the "party of
God," one of the most militant of the
Shiite fundamentalist factions that
has formed in Lebanon since the
Iranian revolution.
Honking their horns and chanting,
"God is great — we want a Moslem
city and an Islamic republic," in a
frenzied two-hour demonstration, the
militants dampened the festive spirit

that had enlivened the streets of
Sidon for the past two days.
Lebanese army soldiers who had
marched triumphantly into Sidon and
all the way south to the Litani River,
near Tyre, Israel's new defense line,
stood by and made no attempt to stop
the demonstration.
At one point, demonstrators ripped
down one of the many Lebanese na
tional flags that have adorned Sidon
for the past two days. A Lebanese
soldier tried to rehang it, but a defiant
demonstrator pulled it down again.
The resistance movement, initially
begun by leftist organizations, had
assumed a largely Shiite Moslem
character in the last few months as
operations against Israeli soldiers and
their Lebanese allies were stepped up
in a push to drive Israel out. The
majority of southern Lebanon's pop
ulation is Shiite.
