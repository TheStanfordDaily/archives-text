General drops CBS suit
NEW YORK — A lawyer for William
Westmoreland told a judge yesterday he had
dropped his $120 million libel suit against CBS,
and the retired general declared, "I got what I
wanted." The network said it was vindicated but
stopped short of claiming victory.
The settlement was announced to U.S. District
Judge Pierre Leval yesterday, a few days before
testimony was to have ended in the 18-week trial.
The suit stemmed from a documentary accusing
Westmoreland of suppressing the true strength of
communist forces in Vietnam in 1967 to maintain
political support for the war.
Both sides believe "their respective positions
have been effectively placed before the public for
its consideration" and continuing the case
"would serve no further purpose," the joint
statement dated Sunday said.
The statement said CBS "respects General
Westmoreland's long and faithful service to his
country" and never meant to imply that
Westmoreland "was unpatriotic or disloyal in
performing his duties as he saw them."
"If that statement had been made after the
CBS program had been aired, it would have fully
satisfied me," Westmoreland said later.
"I got what I wanted," he said. "That is what I
asked for originally.... I consider that I've won by
virtue of that statement."
Without the statement, "we would be going
back to court tomorrow," said Dan Burt,
Westmoreland's attorney. "The general has
wanted one thing from the beginning of the case.
He wanted his reputation back. He believes he

has that now."
But Van Gordon Sauter, executive vice presi
dent of CBS Broadcast Group, said he did "not
view that statement as an apology."
CBS lawyer David Boies said he told jurors ba
sically the same thing in his opening statement.
"If that's all they wanted, they didn't have to sue
for $120 million. They didn't have to ask for an
apology," he said.
Westmoreland, 70, commanded American
forces in Vietnam from 1964 to 1968. He filed
suit in 1982 after CBS broadcast its documen
tary, "The Uncounted Enemy: A Vietnam
Deception."
The documentary said Westmoreland insisted
that intelligence reports show no more than
300,000 communist troops despite evidence
pointing to a figure in excess of 500,000.
Westmoreland maintained that CBS distorted
an honest disagreement among intelligence
analysts to make it appear that he had
deliberately misled his superiors.
CBS, which conceded no factual errors, said in
a statement that "nothing surfaced" during the
trial "that in any way diminishes our conviction
that the broadcast was fair and accurate."
Heart recipient recovers
LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Murray Haydon, in his
second day with a mechanical heart, is making a
"very excellent" recovery, but the only other
living artificial-he art recipient, William
Schroeder, is "weak, tired and discouraged" and
may never leave the hospital, the head of the

Humana Hospital heart program said yesterday.
Dr. Allan Lansing described Haydon's speedy
progress after Sunday's surgery as remarkably
"uneventful." Unlike Schroeder, who needed a
second operation to correct massive bleeding
within hours of his heart implant on Nov. 25,
Haydon has had no complications.
"His condition is so good that it's frighten
ing. ... He looks remarkably bright," Lansing
said. %
He reported that the 58-year-old retired auto
worker, the world's third artificial-heart patient,
was taken off a respirator, spoke briefly with
family members and gave hospital staff members
the thumbs-up sign.
"His spirits are excellent. ... Everybody is
pleased," said Lansing, chairman and chief
spokesman for Humana Heart Institute Interna
tional.
But Lansing said Schroeder's strength has been
sapped over the past two-and-a-half weeks by a
fever that has left him "weak, tired and dis
couraged." In mid-December, Schroeder suf
fered a stroke that caused speech and memory
problems.
Lansing said the combination of physical
weakness and loss of spirit is a threat to
Schroeder's life.
"I am very concerned about the apparent dis
couragement to Mr. Schroeder," Lansing said.
"We are doing everything we can to give him
some encouragement. But if he does not get
stronger, if he does not get over the fever, then
he will remain discouraged and that could be a
threat to his life, no question about it."
