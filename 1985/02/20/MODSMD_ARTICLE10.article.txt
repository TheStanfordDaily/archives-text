# Court rules on wage laws
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Supreme
Court, widening federal authority
over the states, reversed a landmark
1976 decision yesterday and ruled 5-
4 that the federal government could
impose minimum wage and overtime
laws on transit systems operated by
state and local agencies.
The decision specifically paved the
way for increased federal control over
the wages and hours of all state and
municipal employees — an action
that could prove costly to taxpayers
and transit riders as new revenues are
required to support higher labor
costs.
The ruling also removed an 8-year
old legal precedent that had proved
one of the few barriers to the far
ranging power of Congress to force
state and local agencies to comply
with federal laws.
The court majority concluded that

the 1976 ruling — which had ex
empted fire, police, sanitation and
other "traditional" state functions
from such federal regulation — had
proved too difficult to implement,
producing confusion among the lower
courts as they tried to apply it to a
wide range of governmental services.
Dissenters expressed dismay at the
court's unusually abrupt reversal of
itself, saying that it undermined the
stability of judicial decision making.
While the court on occasion recon
siders and overrules itself, few rever
sals have been rendered so quickly,
they pointed out.
In other decisions yesterday, the
Supreme Court let stand a California
case that prosecutors say will require
virtual retrials for scores of defen
dants sentenced to death and life im
prisonment.

With no recorded dissents or expla
nation, the high court refused to hear
the California attorney general's peti
tion to take up the case of Lawrence
Garcia, whose life sentence was upset
by the stpte Supreme Court last Au
gust.
In Garcia's case, the state high
court made retroactive a 1983 deci
sion that prosecutors must prove and
jurors must find that defendants in
tended to murder their victims before
a sentence of death or life in prison
without parole may be imposed.
California Attorney General John
Van de Kamp has said that the court's
decision will require virtual retrials in
California for as many as 95 defen
dants sentenced to death and 85
defendants sentenced to life in prison
without parole.
The Supreme Court also agreed

yesterday to decide whether public
high school students can meet volun
tarily for prayer and religious discus
sion in the classroom.
The justices said that they would
review a program in Williamsport,
Pa., that allowed other extracurric
ular student meetings for non
religious purposes, but barred religi
ous gatherings as a violation of the
separation of church and state.
The Reagan administration had
asked the court to hear the case,
saying that a decision invalidating vo
luntary student religious meetings
could threaten the constitutionality of
the federal Equal Access Act. The
act, passed last year, prohibits public
high schools that receive federal aid
from barring student gatherings be
cause of their religious, political or
philosophical nature.
