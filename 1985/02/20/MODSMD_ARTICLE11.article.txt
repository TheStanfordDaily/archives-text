Shultz defends rebel aid
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State George
Shultz yesterday described the Sandinista leader
ship in Nicaragua as a "bad news government"
and said the Reagan administration is deter
mined to prevent the permanent installation of a
Soviet-dominated regime anywhere in Central
America.
"I see no reason why we shbflld slam the door
on people just because they have been taken be
hind the Iron Curtain," Shultz said.
Defending the administration's policy of covert
aid for rightist "contra" guerrillas, the secretary
said he rejects the idea that once a Soviet
supported government is established in Latin
America, it can never be changed.
"We do have a moral duty to support people
who are trying to bring about freedom in their
country," Shultz said. "While we are promoting
democratic reform throughout Central America,
the Soviet Union and Cuba are abetting the es
tablishment of a Communist dictatorship in
Nicaragua."
Shultz said the Sandinista leaders have
repeatedly failed to meet pledges for making
democratic reforms and have never taken U.S.
efforts to arrange peace negotiations seriously.
The administration supports the need for
negotiations to end the fighting, he said, but
added it should not be done without guarantees
that Nicaragua would remain free of Soviet con
trol and initiate democratic reforms.
Shultz testified before the House Foreign Af
fairs Committee on the administration's $14.8
billion military and economic foreign aid package
for fiscal year 1986.

1 here is deep opposition to a resumption of aid
to the contras among members of the
Democratic-controlled committee, and Shultz
fended off questions from a number of members
critical of administration policies in Central
America.
In about a month, Congress is expected to vote
on whether to restore $14 million in £ overt aid to
the Nicaraguan guerrillas.
Mengele hunt continues
WASHINGTON — Nazi war criminal Josef
Mengele was known to be alive in 1982 and
living as a beekeeper in Paraguay, a leader of the
hunt for the Auschwitz death camp doctor told
Congress yesterday.
Mengele, known as the "Angel of Death" in
the Polish death factory where an estimated 3
million Jews perished in the Holocaust during
World War 11, was living at a site 40 miles outside
the Paraguayan capital of Asuncion, said Rabbi
Marvin Hier at a congressional hearing.
Two years earlier, Mengele had been sending
Christmas cards from Portugal, Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato (R-N.Y.) told the hearing.
Hier, dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center of
Los Angeles and a leader of the recently intensi
fied effort to find Mengele, testified along with
D'Amato at a meeting of the Senate Judiciary
juvenile justice subcommittee.
A West German warrant for Mengele's arrest
is still outstanding and Attorney General William
French Smith last month ordered the Justice De
partment to try to locate Mengele.
Mengele, who would be 73 if he is still alive,
lived for some time in Paraguay, according to in

formation at the hearing, despite official state
ments by that South American government that
Mengele has long since moved away.
Hier said he believes Mengele is still alive, an
opinion echoed by Allan Ryan, former director
of the Justice Department's office of special in
vestigations, formed in 1979 to track down Nazi
fugitives who may be living in the United States.
D'Amato added in his testimony that Mengele
may have financed his life and travels as a
fugitive in South America by trafficking heavily
in cocaine.
Cables and other documents indicate that
Mengele "had a network available to him in
raising large sums of money" and that "high offi
cials (in South America) gave him protection,"
D'Amato said. He declined to tell Sen. Arlen
Specter (R-Pa.), the subcommittee chairman, the
source of the documents but promised: "We are
hopeful they can be made public in a few days."
Robert Feldkamp, a spokesman for the Drug
Enforcement Administration, said later, "We do
not know what Sen. D'Amato is referring to. We
have no information along those lines."
Market down again
The stock market posted its third straight loss
yesterday with a modest decline in the slowest
trading in more than six weeks.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials,
down 15.90 points Thursday and Friday before
the long Presidents' Day weekend, slipped an
other 1.43 to 1,280.59.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange
came to 90.40 million shares, down from 106.47
million last Friday and the lightest total since an
86.19 million-share day on Jan. 7.

Shultz defends rebel aid
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State George
Shultz yesterday described the Sandinista leader
ship in Nicaragua as a "bad news government"
and said the Reagan administration is deter
mined to prevent the permanent installation of a
Soviet-dominated regime anywhere in Central
America.
"I see no reason why we shbflld slam the door
on people just because they have been taken be
hind the Iron Curtain," Shultz said.
Defending the administration's policy of covert
aid for rightist "contra" guerrillas, the secretary
said he rejects the idea that once a Soviet
supported government is established in Latin
America, it can never be changed.
"We do have a moral duty to support people
who are trying to bring about freedom in their
country," Shultz said. "While we are promoting
democratic reform throughout Central America,
the Soviet Union and Cuba are abetting the es
tablishment of a Communist dictatorship in
Nicaragua."
Shultz said the Sandinista leaders have
repeatedly failed to meet pledges for making
democratic reforms and have never taken U.S.
efforts to arrange peace negotiations seriously.
The administration supports the need for
negotiations to end the fighting, he said, but
added it should not be done without guarantees
that Nicaragua would remain free of Soviet con
trol and initiate democratic reforms.
Shultz testified before the House Foreign Af
fairs Committee on the administration's $14.8
billion military and economic foreign aid package
for fiscal year 1986.

1 here is deep opposition to a resumption of aid
to the contras among members of the
Democratic-controlled committee, and Shultz
fended off questions from a number of members
critical of administration policies in Central
America.
In about a month, Congress is expected to vote
on whether to restore $14 million in £ overt aid to
the Nicaraguan guerrillas.
Mengele hunt continues
WASHINGTON — Nazi war criminal Josef
Mengele was known to be alive in 1982 and
living as a beekeeper in Paraguay, a leader of the
hunt for the Auschwitz death camp doctor told
Congress yesterday.
Mengele, known as the "Angel of Death" in
the Polish death factory where an estimated 3
million Jews perished in the Holocaust during
World War 11, was living at a site 40 miles outside
the Paraguayan capital of Asuncion, said Rabbi
Marvin Hier at a congressional hearing.
Two years earlier, Mengele had been sending
Christmas cards from Portugal, Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato (R-N.Y.) told the hearing.
Hier, dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center of
Los Angeles and a leader of the recently intensi
fied effort to find Mengele, testified along with
D'Amato at a meeting of the Senate Judiciary
juvenile justice subcommittee.
A West German warrant for Mengele's arrest
is still outstanding and Attorney General William
French Smith last month ordered the Justice De
partment to try to locate Mengele.
Mengele, who would be 73 if he is still alive,
lived for some time in Paraguay, according to in

formation at the hearing, despite official state
ments by that South American government that
Mengele has long since moved away.
Hier said he believes Mengele is still alive, an
opinion echoed by Allan Ryan, former director
of the Justice Department's office of special in
vestigations, formed in 1979 to track down Nazi
fugitives who may be living in the United States.
D'Amato added in his testimony that Mengele
may have financed his life and travels as a
fugitive in South America by trafficking heavily
in cocaine.
Cables and other documents indicate that
Mengele "had a network available to him in
raising large sums of money" and that "high offi
cials (in South America) gave him protection,"
D'Amato said. He declined to tell Sen. Arlen
Specter (R-Pa.), the subcommittee chairman, the
source of the documents but promised: "We are
hopeful they can be made public in a few days."
Robert Feldkamp, a spokesman for the Drug
Enforcement Administration, said later, "We do
not know what Sen. D'Amato is referring to. We
have no information along those lines."
