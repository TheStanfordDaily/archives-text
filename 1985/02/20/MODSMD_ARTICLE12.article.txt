Jury finds Cooper guilty
SAN DIEGO— Prison escapee Kevin Cooper
was found guilty yesterday of four counts of first
degree murder in the June 1983 slayings of three
members of a Chino Hills family and a visiting
neighbor boy.
The seven women and five men on the jury
deliberated for 24 hours over six days before
reaching the verdict about 11 a.m. yesterday.
The jury will begin considering evidence
tomorrow in the penalty phase of the trial, and
could recommend death in the California gas
chamber for Cooper because he was found guilty
of a special circumstance — committing more
than one murder.
The hacked and stabbed bodies of Doug and
Peg Ryen, both 41; their daughter, Jessica, 10;
and visiting neighbor boy, Christopher Hughes,
11, were found the next day in the Ryens' nearby
home. Joshua Ryen, 8 at the time, survived a
slashed throat.
Waste fouls scenic river
SANTA ROSA, Calif. — An illegal, three-day
flood of 600 million gallons of waste flowed yes
terday from brimming sewage ponds into one of
California's most beautiful rivers, fouling the
drinking water source for 8,000 residents.
It will take at least nine days before the 22-
mile stretch of the Russian River, from Santa
Rosa to the Pacific Ocean at Jenner, 60 miles
north of San Francisco, is clean again, according
to Ben Kor, assistant executive officer of the
North Coast Region Water Quality Control

Board.
The non-stop flow of sewage through Friday at
more than 10 times the legal rate of 1 percent of
the river's flow could result in stiff penalties
against Santa Rosa, Kor said.
At a public hearing March 6, the board is ex
pected to impose fines and perhaps restrictions
on future sewage connections, a move that might
slow or halt growth of one of the state's fastest
growing cities.
After meetings between the city, the water
quality board, and county and state health
agencies, the illegal dumping was permitted
rather than risk a worse spill this spring or sum
mer during the tourist season, Kor said.
Fifty hurt in plane drop
SAN FRANCISCO — A China Airlines
jumbo jet dropped 32,000 feet in less than two
minutes yesterday, injuring as many as 50 pas
sengers and forcing the pilot to make an emer
gency landing.
The Boeing 747 was about 300 miles away
from San Francisco when it apparently hit a patch
of turbulence known as a wind shear — a rapid
change in wind speed and direction — and
dropped from a cruising altitude of 41,000 feet to
9,000 feet, said Ron Wilson, a spokesman at San
Francisco International Airport.
The flight, with more than 250 people aboard,
was en route to Los Angeles from Taipei,
Taiwan, but the pilot made a safe landing at San
Francisco International at 11 a.m.
At least 50 people were treated at the airport
medical clinic for minor injuries, and another

five, including a pilot, were transported to hospi
tals with injuries ranging from a possible
fractured spine to shock, Wilson said.
Minor injuries included head and neck strain,
dizziness and nausea, he said, noting that several
people passed out when the plane landed.
Lottery bills approved
SACRAMENTO — An Assembly panel ap
proved three lottery-related bills yesterday
despite a warning that Gov. George Deukmejian
could use them as ammunition to attack the
legislature.
Debate on a fourth lottery bill was postponed
so that it could be amended to bolster competi
tive bidding for multimillion-dollar lottery con
tracts. Assembly Richard Alatorre (D-Los An
geles) is adding provisions that would ease the
controversial financial disclosures required of po
tential lottery suppliers.
The Assembly Governmental Organization
Committee approved bills banning the transfer of
state funds to the lottery, making it a mis
demeanor to sell lottery tickets without state
permission and authorizing local governments as
ticket-sale outlets over opposition from As
semblyman Richard Floyd (D-Hawthorne.)
Today's weather
Today will be mostly sunny in the Stanford
area, with afternoon highs in the 60s. There will
be light winds inland and heavier northwesterly
winds in the 15-30 mph range along the ocean.
Tonight will be clear with lows in the 40s.

SAN FRANCISCO — A China Airlines
jumbo jet dropped 32,000 feet in less than two
minutes yesterday, injuring as many as 50 pas
sengers and forcing the pilot to make an emer
gency landing.
The Boeing 747 was about 300 miles away
from San Francisco when it apparently hit a patch
of turbulence known as a wind shear — a rapid
change in wind speed and direction — and
dropped from a cruising altitude of 41,000 feet to
9,000 feet, said Ron Wilson, a spokesman at San
Francisco International Airport.
The flight, with more than 250 people aboard,
was en route to Los Angeles from Taipei,
Taiwan, but the pilot made a safe landing at San
Francisco International at 11 a.m.
At least 50 people were treated at the airport
medical clinic for minor injuries, and another

five, including a pilot, were transported to hospi
tals with injuries ranging from a possible
fractured spine to shock, Wilson said.
Minor injuries included head and neck strain,
dizziness and nausea, he said, noting that several
people passed out when the plane landed.
Lottery bills approved
SACRAMENTO — An Assembly panel ap
proved three lottery-related bills yesterday
despite a warning that Gov. George Deukmejian
could use them as ammunition to attack the
legislature.
Debate on a fourth lottery bill was postponed
so that it could be amended to bolster competi
tive bidding for multimillion-dollar lottery con
tracts. Assembly Richard Alatorre (D-Los An
geles) is adding provisions that would ease the
controversial financial disclosures required of po
tential lottery suppliers.
The Assembly Governmental Organization
Committee approved bills banning the transfer of
state funds to the lottery, making it a mis
demeanor to sell lottery tickets without state
permission and authorizing local governments as
ticket-sale outlets over opposition from As
semblyman Richard Floyd (D-Hawthorne.)
