## Microscope uses sound waves to get images 
### NIKO SCHIFF Editorial staff 
Research and development in
acoustic imaging devices at Stanford
has led to a commercially available
acoustic microscope. The ELSAM
microscope produced by the German
optics firm, Leitz, was awarded the
Frankfort Innovations Prize of Ger
man Industry on Jan. 19, 1985.
The microscope was chosen for the
prestigious award, given to innovative
technology, from nearly 100 highly
qualified candidates. Leitz
spokesperson Urs Scheller said, "It is
a great honor to accept the 1984 in
novations prize but it is also a duty
and a commitment to uphold the high
standard of the label 'Made in Ger
many' on precision instruments."
Leitz officials plan to visit Stanford
later this month.
The theoretical groundwork for
this microscope was done by Calvin
Quate, professor of applied physics
and electrical engineering. Quate's
lab in the applied physics building
houses the high resolution acoustic
microscope that is based on the use of
sound waves vibrating at ultrasonic
frequencies.
While frequencies of sound mea
sured at 20,000 hertz (cycles per
second) are in the range of human
hearing, the ultrasonic waves used in
the acoustic microscope have fre
quencies around eight gigahertz
(billions of cycles per second). The
wavelength of sounds in human
speech is measured in meters, while
the wavelength of sound used in the
acoustic microscope is measured in
micrometers (millionths of a meter)
and is in the same range of
wavelength as visible light.
The use of waves at these high
ultrasonic frequencies requires that
they are moved through liquid or
solid media because such frequencies
are quickly attenuated and dispersed
in gas and air. The technology needed
to effectively use acoustic waves in
the gigahertz range involves the use
of liquid helium at temperatures low
enough to reduce vibrations in the
liquid that would otherwise scatter
the sound waves.

The microscope itself is about a
foot long, with a lens assembly of
about a half inch. It is hooked up to a
large refrigerator system that is used
to keep the assembly enclosed in liq
uid helium, at one-tenth of one
degree Kelvin (minus 273.25 degrees
Celsius). Using ultrasonic waves and
cold liquid media, the operating
wavelength of the acoustic micro
scope has been reduced to .02
micrometers.
Images are formed by the acoustic
microscope in a way similar to the op
eration of a standard optical micro
scope. In the case of acoustic imaging,
the change in the velocity of the
sound waves as they move from one
type of material to another is used to
create the image. Light wave
velocities are used in the same way in
an optical microscope. In acoustic im
aging, however, there is a tenfold
greater fluctuation in velocity when
the waves move from one material to
another. This greater range of
velocity gives more distinct contrasts
of the phase properties of the ob
served objects, explained a re
searcher in Ouate's lab.
The lens assembly consists of a sap
phire and liquid helium interface. The
helium is used as a liquid to get to the
operating wavelength. The acoustic
signal used for imaging starts out as
an electric signal, which is then trans
formed into sound waves by a trans
ducer. an instrument analogous to a
telephone receiver that receives an
electric signal and transforms it into
sound.
The acoustic signal, or echo, then
travels through the lens of the micro
scope and is focused on a small spot
in the plane of the object. The image
is formed by moving that focused
point along the plane of the object
and essentially scanning the object
with a beam of ultrasound. The
acoustic signal that returns is then
reconverted by the transducer and
the final image is formed by scanning
an electron beam across a video
screen while scanning the observed
object with the acoustic beam.
The images produced by the acous
tic microscope are of greater resolu

tion than those produced by optical
microscopes. However, the more im
portant advantages of the different
kind of contrast available with acous
tic imaging are what set this tech
nique apart.
The greater fluctuation in the
velocity of the sound waves allows the
elastic properties of materials to be
examined. Sound waves move much
faster in solids than in liquids. Light
refraction in glass displays a similar,
but weaker, effect. Metals appear
only as many grains of crystals with
cemented boundaries under optical
microscopes, while under an acoustic
microscope they reveal phase differ
ences, differences in the elasticity of
the individual grains.

I he acoustic microscope views ob
jects in dimensions of micrometers,
rhe kinds of objects usually under
view are metal alloys, microelectronic
circuits and biological cells. For all
these objects the acoustic microscope
yields a micrograph that gives a very
fine contrast of topography, ex
plained a graduate student who works
in Quate's lab. The surface heights on
a membrane are good examples of
the microscope's capabilities: The mi
croscope detects subtle changes in
surface elevations of the membranes.
Membrane surface characteristics
previously undetectable are now
visible with the new technique. The
microscope is also advantageous in
membrane surface studies as the

samples do not need to be plated or
stained. When optical microscopes
are used to view objects with
diameters in the range of five
micrometers, the objects must first be
carefully stained because they are too
transparent.
Micrographs of electronic circuitry
show details of the layered surfaces of
microchips in greater detail than opti
cal microscope image. They also
reveal different height distinctions as
the distance between the object and
the lens is adjusted.
The ELS AM microscope uses a
water interface, instead of helium,
that allows the observation of living
cells and processes such as the defen
sive reactions of living cells to poisons

and drugs. The microscope at Stan
ford operates at temperatures too low
to observe living cells.
Researchers are now working to
further improve the resolution of the
microscope. It is hoped that the
wavelength of eight gigahertz now
used will be increased to 96 gigahertz,
giving the microscope an operating
resolution of .005 micrometers.
When the microscope enters this
range, it will be competitive with the
scanning electron mircoscope for the
highest image resolution.
The research to date has concen
trated on improving the technology of
the acoustic images. Extensions of
this technology into biology and engi
neering are just beginning.

further improve the resolution of the
microscope. It is hoped that the
wavelength of eight gigahertz now
used will be increased to 96 gigahertz,
giving the microscope an operating
resolution of .005 micrometers.
When the microscope enters this
range, it will be competitive with the
scanning electron mircoscope for the
highest image resolution.
The research to date has concen
trated on improving the technology of
the acoustic images. Extensions of
this technology into biology and engi
neering are just beginning.

Research and development in
acoustic imaging devices at Stanford
has led to a commercially available
acoustic microscope. The ELSAM
microscope produced by the German
optics firm, Leitz, was awarded the
Frankfort Innovations Prize of Ger
man Industry on Jan. 19, 1985.
The microscope was chosen for the
prestigious award, given to innovative
technology, from nearly 100 highly
qualified candidates. Leitz
spokesperson Urs Scheller said, "It is
a great honor to accept the 1984 in
novations prize but it is also a duty
and a commitment to uphold the high
standard of the label 'Made in Ger
many' on precision instruments."
Leitz officials plan to visit Stanford
later this month.
The theoretical groundwork for
this microscope was done by Calvin
Quate, professor of applied physics
and electrical engineering. Quate's
lab in the applied physics building
houses the high resolution acoustic
microscope that is based on the use of
sound waves vibrating at ultrasonic
frequencies.
While frequencies of sound mea
sured at 20,000 hertz (cycles per
second) are in the range of human
hearing, the ultrasonic waves used in
the acoustic microscope have fre
quencies around eight gigahertz
(billions of cycles per second). The
wavelength of sounds in human
speech is measured in meters, while
the wavelength of sound used in the
acoustic microscope is measured in
micrometers (millionths of a meter)
and is in the same range of
wavelength as visible light.
The use of waves at these high
ultrasonic frequencies requires that
they are moved through liquid or
solid media because such frequencies
are quickly attenuated and dispersed
in gas and air. The technology needed
to effectively use acoustic waves in
the gigahertz range involves the use
of liquid helium at temperatures low
enough to reduce vibrations in the
liquid that would otherwise scatter
the sound waves.

The microscope itself is about a
foot long, with a lens assembly of
about a half inch. It is hooked up to a
large refrigerator system that is used
to keep the assembly enclosed in liq
uid helium, at one-tenth of one
degree Kelvin (minus 273.25 degrees
Celsius). Using ultrasonic waves and
cold liquid media, the operating
wavelength of the acoustic micro
scope has been reduced to .02
micrometers.
Images are formed by the acoustic
microscope in a way similar to the op
eration of a standard optical micro
scope. In the case of acoustic imaging,
the change in the velocity of the
sound waves as they move from one
type of material to another is used to
create the image. Light wave
velocities are used in the same way in
an optical microscope. In acoustic im
aging, however, there is a tenfold
greater fluctuation in velocity when
the waves move from one material to
another. This greater range of
velocity gives more distinct contrasts
of the phase properties of the ob
served objects, explained a re
searcher in Ouate's lab.
The lens assembly consists of a sap
phire and liquid helium interface. The
helium is used as a liquid to get to the
operating wavelength. The acoustic
signal used for imaging starts out as
an electric signal, which is then trans
formed into sound waves by a trans
ducer. an instrument analogous to a
telephone receiver that receives an
electric signal and transforms it into
sound.
The acoustic signal, or echo, then
travels through the lens of the micro
scope and is focused on a small spot
in the plane of the object. The image
is formed by moving that focused
point along the plane of the object
and essentially scanning the object
with a beam of ultrasound. The
acoustic signal that returns is then
reconverted by the transducer and
the final image is formed by scanning
an electron beam across a video
screen while scanning the observed
object with the acoustic beam.
The images produced by the acous
tic microscope are of greater resolu

tion than those produced by optical
microscopes. However, the more im
portant advantages of the different
kind of contrast available with acous
tic imaging are what set this tech
nique apart.
The greater fluctuation in the
velocity of the sound waves allows the
elastic properties of materials to be
examined. Sound waves move much
faster in solids than in liquids. Light
refraction in glass displays a similar,
but weaker, effect. Metals appear
only as many grains of crystals with
cemented boundaries under optical
microscopes, while under an acoustic
microscope they reveal phase differ
ences, differences in the elasticity of
the individual grains.

I he acoustic microscope views ob
jects in dimensions of micrometers,
rhe kinds of objects usually under
view are metal alloys, microelectronic
circuits and biological cells. For all
these objects the acoustic microscope
yields a micrograph that gives a very
fine contrast of topography, ex
plained a graduate student who works
in Quate's lab. The surface heights on
a membrane are good examples of
the microscope's capabilities: The mi
croscope detects subtle changes in
surface elevations of the membranes.
Membrane surface characteristics
previously undetectable are now
visible with the new technique. The
microscope is also advantageous in
membrane surface studies as the

samples do not need to be plated or
stained. When optical microscopes
are used to view objects with
diameters in the range of five
micrometers, the objects must first be
carefully stained because they are too
transparent.
Micrographs of electronic circuitry
show details of the layered surfaces of
microchips in greater detail than opti
cal microscope image. They also
reveal different height distinctions as
the distance between the object and
the lens is adjusted.
The ELS AM microscope uses a
water interface, instead of helium,
that allows the observation of living
cells and processes such as the defen
sive reactions of living cells to poisons

and drugs. The microscope at Stan
ford operates at temperatures too low
to observe living cells.
Researchers are now working to
further improve the resolution of the
microscope. It is hoped that the
wavelength of eight gigahertz now
used will be increased to 96 gigahertz,
giving the microscope an operating
resolution of .005 micrometers.
