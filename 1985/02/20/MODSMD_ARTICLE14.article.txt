## The 						Stanford Daily Sweet-sounding split 
### 
The decision by the ASSU Senate to override
the veto of the Council of Presidents (COP) and
separate the Band's fee-assessment request into
two parts is a sound one.
The controversy over how the Band's fee
assessment request will appear on this spring's
ballot began last Tuesday when the senate voted
to slice the budget submitted by the Band into
two parts. Splitting the budget allows students to
decide — with separate votes — whether they
want to fund the Band's fall quarter road trip and
whether they want to help offset the Band's oper
ating costs. The COP veto, overridden during a
special senate session Friday, would have
restored the Band's comprehensive all-or
nothing entry on the ballot, forcing students to
choose between funding all Band activities or
none at all.
The ASSU had essentially three choices for
ways to enter the Band's budget on the fee
assessment ballot: dividing the operating ex
penses and road trip, entering them as one, or
dropping the road trip entirely and entering just
the operating expenses. The move to divide the
budget was the best choice of the three.
With regard to the first two options, separating
the budget into two parts is more logical and will
be less confusing for student voters than forcing

them to vote all-or-nothing for the Band's oper
ating expenses and road trip.
The only controversial aspect of the Band's fee
assessment request is tiie road trip. Many people
question the validity of having the student body
fund the trip — which ate "well over half' of the
Band's special fee this school year, according to
Senate Chair Eric Berg — because the student
body does not benefit directly from the activity.
Mowever, students have never expressed any
serious doubt about the desirability of helping to
pay the operating expenses of this popular group.
Separating the real issue of the road trip from the
non-issue of operating expenses therefore
presents students with a more straightforward
and less confusing choice on the spring ballot.
The third option, in which the senate would
decide unilaterally to cut the road trip from the
Band's budget, would have unnecessarily
centralized a decision-making process that should
include the student body.
One of the best features of the current fee
assessment system is that it allows students to
decide directly how much to tax themselves and
how to spend the tax money that is collected. Al
lowing all students, rather than just senators, to
make the decision on funding the Band's road
trip preserves this benefit.
