# The 						media's subtle shaping
## 
### 
The power of the press is, in a word, awesome. The re
sponsibility that the press must exercise is correspondingly
immense. And an accompanying skepticism on the part of
media consumers is an essential, though far from certain,
insurance policy against manipulation of the public.
These facts are monumental revelations to none of us.
We all are aware of them. But they are easily forgotten by
the individual seeking his daily information fix from tele
vision news or a newspaper.
It is obvious that the slightest misuse of media power by
less than responsible journalists and a simultaneous ab
sence of the necessary reader (or viewer) skepticism is a

dangerous combination. But
rarely is one able to observe
firsthand a situation charac
terized by this combination.
An occurrence on campus
last week and the press
coverage it received,
however, demonstrates the
ability of the media to subtly
mislead and the possible
consequences of the inade
quacies of the so-called
"skeptic" insurance policy.

On Tuesday of last week, several students staged a sit
in to protest apartheid practices in South Africa. I
watched as fewer than 20 "demonstrators" (eight of them
boasting such creative signs as "Divest Now") at the
Hoover Institution drew the attention of almost as many
members of the press.
Cameramen from local television stations appeared ut
terly engrossed in the uneventfulness of the sparsely at
tended meeting! They hopped from corner to corner of
the small foyer of the Hoover Memorial Building in a
search for the camera angle that would lead viewers to
believe that a substantial event had actully occurred.
Newspaper reporters hurriedly scribbled down the
tedious rhetoric that the leaders of the event fed to the
seemingly sensitized people present: Most stared blankly
with expressions that seemed to say, "We've heard this so
many times before we can't even manage to look inter
ested."
I asked one of the organizers of this demonstration
what she thought of all the press attention that this un
impressive sit-in was receiving. She looked horrified and
offended at my inquiry and replied: "This is not for the
press. This is to show that Stanford students support the
oppressed people of South Africa." (Though these were
her actual words, the manner of her utterance of them
conveyed certain unmentionable sentiments about my
character.)
Well, if this is what she really believed, then her and her
cohorts' efforts failed miserably. With all their organizing
and inciting, they managed to assemble a relatively insig
nificant number of people — I counted 19. I would wager
that almost as many people would show up for a meeting
of Stanford students from North Dakota (no slight against
North Dakotans intended).

As an event staged to attract press attention, however,
it was extremely successful — even in the utter triviality of
the number of attendants. Stories and photographs ap
peared in local newspapers (including The Daily) and
television stations shot extensive footage. But was this sit
in by a few students that attracted few of the sponsoring
groups' members and virtually no members of the Stan
ford community not associated with the groups really
worthy of the media attention it received?
Journalists need not blatantly misrepresent the facts of
actual events to influence media consumers. In fact, bla
tant misrepresentation is usually least effective because it

is so easny provaoie ano
noticeable. The most effec
tive — and the most in
sidious — misrepresentation
occurs when the facts re
ported are accurate.ln these
cases, although reported
facts may be correct, other
essential ones may carelessly
or intentionally remain un
reported. Or emphasis may
be misplaced: An insignifi-

cant story can easily be made to seem more critical.
For example, it is simple to make into an apparently
substantial event an inconsequential news story that
should have appeared at the bottom of page 18 (or not at
all): An editor needs simply to place a photo with it and
run it on page 3. And one can easily manipulate a reader's
(or viewer's) perceived impact of a demonstration (or sit
in) by conveniently neglecting to report the number.
This sort of subtle disinformation contrived to artifi
cially heighten the impact of an event on viewers or
readers is extremely dangerous because it is difficult to
document and nearly impossible to prove: An editor may
easily defend a questionable decision by saying, "I
thought the story was significant enough to warrant the
treatment given it."
None of us is completely impervious to this sort of
subtle manipulation. We cannot practically approach each
article and news broadcast we see as continually question
ing skeptics: Few of us have the time or the resources to
conduct our own independent search for "the truth." Out
of convenience, most must depend on the mass media for
daily information. We can only make certain that a
homogeneous group of journalists with similar attitudes
and views toward events never gain control over multiple
media sources.
Many would argue that this has already happened:
They persist that journalists of the more "liberal" view
dominate the media today, and that their common atti
tudes influence the overall reporting of events. If this is
true then we face a serious danger as a free people. Con
scious or unconscious slanting of the news by a free press
is potentially as manipulative as blatant state censorship.
We must fear each and work to prevent both with equal
energy.
