## Terra won't be the same as a self-op 
### 
I'm a grad student, and I came here this year
without ever having seen the place where I live
now, which is Terra House. Having lived there and
enjoyed it, however, I know that Rodger Whitney's
assertion that changing Terra to a self-op " . . .
would make it very similar to a co-op" is wrong in
several important respects (yes, Mr. Whitney, there
is more to Terra than baking bread).
First, cooperative living engenders a spirit of
community among its members that is rarely found

in dormitory living. I spent three years at my col
lege living in a dorm and my last year living in a
house I rented with six other students. I acknowl
edge the fact that there are many instances of
groups growing quite close together in a dorm sit
uation, but the fact is that when one has to rely on
the other members of a household to cook and
clean there is a far greater sense that you are living
in a home rather than just a place to study, sleep
and party occasionally.
The opportunity to get to know a group of
people as the members of a commbn home, in my
opinion, far outweighs the four or so hours a week
it costs to do so. A U-op or a self-op structure
would inhibit that opportunity by eliminating the
essential foundation of cooperative community: the
necessary time spent with other people cooking and
cleaning.
Second, cooperative living is the cheapest form
of housing. The cost was not my reason for choos
ing Terra, but it was the deciding factor for many of
my housemates. Palo Alto housing costs being what
they are and the necessary overheads in running a
food service or a cleaning service being what they

are, it is clear that cooperative housing on Univer
sity property is a reasonable and, indeed, desirable
utilization of the available resources. Terra as a U
op or a self-op would necessarily be more expen
sive and, hence, less desirable to some students.
Third, Terra House offers an important
alternative among the co-ops in terms of its politi-

cal and social atmosphere. According to "Graduate
Student Housing at Stanford 1984-85," the
publication we entering grads are given and upon
which we must make our housing decisions for the
upcoming year, "Columbae is traditionally
vegetarian" and believes in "social change through
non-violence," "Synergy residents share a .. . con
cern for the environment," "Theta Chi prides itself
on not being 'PC (politically correct). ..." With
all due respect to my colleagues in other co-ops. the
only choice among the five which seemed to strike
some sort of middle ground was Terra. Indeed, the
single thing which has made this year surprisingly
enjoyable for me is the great political and cultural
diversity of its members this year. We have art

majors and engineers, business grads and un
decided undergrads. Deadheads and soul lovers,
outspoken liberals and quiet conservatives. Sure,
other on-campus housing might have equal diver
sity, but absolutely none of them provides the so
cial forum that actually forces you to get to know
your fellows as does cooperative living.
Finally, a very strong personal point to me is that
as a self-op Terra House, under the proposed rules,
would not be open to grads at all. I believe that to
many graduates coming to Stanford, dormitory
life is unattractive because they have seen that a sit
uation in which they have a degree of control over
their cooking and cleaning is far more rewarding.
On the other hand, they must realize as well that
group living provides greater opportunity to make
friends than, say, living in an apartment. I believe
that cooperative living is the perfect compromise
between these two sentiments. The elimination of
Terra as a co-op would decrease the choices
available to future entering grads.
Because Terra House is more of a home than
other living situations, because it is less expensive,
because it provides an alternative to the more ex
treme co-ops, and because it has several features
attractive to graduate students in particular, I
believe that Terra as a co-op is substantially differ
ent than it would be as a U-op or a self-op and that
it should remain a co-op. I have enjoyed the time I
have spent at Terra, and I think that it would be a
genuine loss to deny future students the opportu
nity of living here in a cooperative. If Terra House
seems like the kind of situation in which you'd like
to live, come by and check it out for yourself. I
think that Terra has its place: as a co-op.
