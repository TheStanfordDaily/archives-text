Students will decide
I would like to clarify and explain
exactly what the ASSU Senate did
last Tuesday when it voted on the
Band's fee-assessment request
("COP vetos senate vote on Band
fee," The Daily, Feb. 14). At the
time, the senate voted to decide the
Band's request and place both parts
on the ballot for the spring quarter
election.
Last fall the student body ap
proved a constitutional amendment
allowing the senate to divide a stu
dent organization's special fee re
quest into two parts. Students could
then vote separately on these parts at
the polls, possibly defeating one and
approving another. The statements
in the elections handbook made it
clear that this would be used to
divide the Band's request into one
part funding their operating expenses
and another part funding their road
trips.
At the beginning of this quarter
the Band presented to the senate a
fee request that used some "creative
bookkeeping" to minimize the im
pact of a possible defeat of their
"road trip fee" by the student body.
Under their proposal, such a defeat
would have allowed them, through
the skillful juggling of their books, to
still go on these road trips using
student fees.
Representatives of the Band pre
sented their case to the Senate Ap
propriations Committee and the
senate, and both bodies debated the
matter at great length. Finally the
senate decided to divide the Band's
request into two parts, one that
would fund their operating expenses
and another that would fund their
road trips.
Last Wednesday the Council of
Presidents vetoed the senate's
action, basically asserting that the
ASSU should allow the Band to foist
off a deceptive budget on the student
body. Friday the senate, in a special
session, overrode this veto by a vote
of 15-2, with three abstentions.
All the senate has tried to do is to
let the student body decide whether
or not it wants to fund Band road

trips. The senate has not tried to
block the Band's access to the ballot
— it actually voted to place both
parts of its request on the ballot.
Rather it has been the Band (and
now the COP) that has tried to deny
the students the option this spring of
voting separately on the quite differ
ent questions of funding the Band's
operating expenses and funding its
road trips.
The Band fears that while students
will almost certainly approve of
funding the Band's operating budget,
they will not approve of funding road
trips. Rather than allow the students
this option, it wants to combine these
two issues, "blackmailing" students
either into voting for the Band's
operating expenses and its road trips,
or into voting against all funding for
the Band.
If students want to fund all of the
Band's expenses, including its road
trips, then they can simply approve
both parts of the Band's request at
the polls. But if they do not, then the
students should have the option of
approving one and not approving the
other. In any event, the senate's
action leaves the final decision in the
hands of the students — not the
senate, the COP or the Band. And
that is where it belongs.

Power-trip padding
I am fed up with the ASSU Sen
ate. For a long time. I was growing
weary of their antics, the way they
take themselves so seriously, the way
they try to exert their power, and the
way they act so terribly important as
they pad their resumes. Their secrecy
and paranoia regarding the Coffee
House deficit, for example, have
been ludicrous.
Their behavior with the fee assess
ments, however, goes too far. We,
the students, are the ASSU; our
senate is to check over budgets
before putting them on the ballot for
our decision. Nothing more. Instead,
the senate has been approving only
those organizations it deems
"worthy." It reeks of power-

grubbing of the most lowly sort, and
is unacceptable.
i I ask you, the students, to stop the
senate. Do not re-elect any of this
group. And if you are considering
running for the senate, you must
publicly denounce such behavior. We
must vote only for candidates who
will act responsibly.

Don't ignore Jim
As Rachana Kamtekar pointed out
(The Daily, Feb. 15), shouting in
sults and obscenities at an evangelist
is an uncivilized and intolerant form
of behavior, no matter how bizarre
his preaching may be.
Nevertheless, I disagree with her
remark that those who were offen
ded by Brother Jim should have
responded by not giving him an
audience. Enlightened, well
educated people are offended, I
hope, by the ideas of the so-called
Moral Majority. Does it follow that
they should ignote Jerry Falwell and
his followers? Of course not, if only
because the political influence of
these evangelicals is far from
negligible.
What's more, many representa
tives of the fundamentalist Christian
movemen' (such as Falwell) espouse
theocratic doctrines that are
frighteningly similar to Brother
Jim's. For instance, much of their
seemingly innocent campaign for
"traditional family values" is pure
hate propaganda against liberated
women and gay people.
My conclusion is that whoever is
concerned about civil liberties in this
country would be well advised to pay
careful attention to those evangelical
preachers. Being offended by their
views should not prevent anyone
from understanding this political
force, which is quite formidable in
certain states, and threatens to un
dermine the libertarian tradition on
which the American system of gov
ernment is based.

way they act so terribly important as
they pad their resumes. Their secrecy
and paranoia regarding the Coffee
House deficit, for example, have
been ludicrous.
Their behavior with the fee assess
ments, however, goes too far. We,
the students, are the ASSU; our
senate is to check over budgets
before putting them on the ballot for
our decision. Nothing more. Instead,
the senate has been approving only
those organizations it deems
"worthy." It reeks of power-

grubbing of the most lowly sort, and
is unacceptable.
i I ask you, the students, to stop the
senate. Do not re-elect any of this
group. And if you are considering
running for the senate, you must
publicly denounce such behavior. We
must vote only for candidates who
will act responsibly.

Don't ignore Jim
As Rachana Kamtekar pointed out
(The Daily, Feb. 15), shouting in
sults and obscenities at an evangelist
is an uncivilized and intolerant form
of behavior, no matter how bizarre
his preaching may be.
Nevertheless, I disagree with her
remark that those who were offen
ded by Brother Jim should have
responded by not giving him an
audience. Enlightened, well
educated people are offended, I
hope, by the ideas of the so-called
Moral Majority. Does it follow that
they should ignote Jerry Falwell and
his followers? Of course not, if only
because the political influence of
these evangelicals is far from
negligible.
What's more, many representa
tives of the fundamentalist Christian
movemen' (such as Falwell) espouse
theocratic doctrines that are
frighteningly similar to Brother
Jim's. For instance, much of their
seemingly innocent campaign for
"traditional family values" is pure
hate propaganda against liberated
women and gay people.
My conclusion is that whoever is
concerned about civil liberties in this
country would be well advised to pay
careful attention to those evangelical
preachers. Being offended by their
views should not prevent anyone
from understanding this political
force, which is quite formidable in
certain states, and threatens to un
dermine the libertarian tradition on
which the American system of gov
ernment is based.

Students will decide
I would like to clarify and explain
exactly what the ASSU Senate did
last Tuesday when it voted on the
Band's fee-assessment request
("COP vetos senate vote on Band
fee," The Daily, Feb. 14). At the
time, the senate voted to decide the
Band's request and place both parts
on the ballot for the spring quarter
election.
Last fall the student body ap
proved a constitutional amendment
allowing the senate to divide a stu
dent organization's special fee re
quest into two parts. Students could
then vote separately on these parts at
the polls, possibly defeating one and
approving another. The statements
in the elections handbook made it
clear that this would be used to
divide the Band's request into one
part funding their operating expenses
and another part funding their road
trips.
At the beginning of this quarter
the Band presented to the senate a
fee request that used some "creative
bookkeeping" to minimize the im
pact of a possible defeat of their
"road trip fee" by the student body.
Under their proposal, such a defeat
would have allowed them, through
the skillful juggling of their books, to
still go on these road trips using
student fees.
Representatives of the Band pre
sented their case to the Senate Ap
propriations Committee and the
senate, and both bodies debated the
matter at great length. Finally the
senate decided to divide the Band's
request into two parts, one that
would fund their operating expenses
and another that would fund their
road trips.
Last Wednesday the Council of
Presidents vetoed the senate's
action, basically asserting that the
ASSU should allow the Band to foist
off a deceptive budget on the student
body. Friday the senate, in a special
session, overrode this veto by a vote
of 15-2, with three abstentions.
All the senate has tried to do is to
let the student body decide whether
or not it wants to fund Band road

trips. The senate has not tried to
block the Band's access to the ballot
— it actually voted to place both
parts of its request on the ballot.
Rather it has been the Band (and
now the COP) that has tried to deny
the students the option this spring of
voting separately on the quite differ
ent questions of funding the Band's
operating expenses and funding its
road trips.
The Band fears that while students
will almost certainly approve of
funding the Band's operating budget,
they will not approve of funding road
trips. Rather than allow the students
this option, it wants to combine these
two issues, "blackmailing" students
either into voting for the Band's
operating expenses and its road trips,
or into voting against all funding for
the Band.
If students want to fund all of the
Band's expenses, including its road
trips, then they can simply approve
both parts of the Band's request at
the polls. But if they do not, then the
students should have the option of
approving one and not approving the
other. In any event, the senate's
action leaves the final decision in the
hands of the students — not the
senate, the COP or the Band. And
that is where it belongs.
