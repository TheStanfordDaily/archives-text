# Class illustrates ways of coping with cancer
## 
### LARKY WEBER 
Cancer affects the lives of nearly
everyone. For many, their way of
coping with cancer is to distance
themselves from the often fatal
disease. However, the fact that ap
proximately one in five Americans
will be diagnosed with some form of
cancer makes this distancing difficult.
One must understand the com
plexity of physical and emotional
traumas that cancer inflicts upon the
individual and his or her family so
that, if and when it hits, they may be
dealt with as positively as possible.
The American Cancer Society
sponsored "I Can Cope" class, cur
rently offered at Stanford Hospital,
teaches patients and their families
about cancer and how to live with it,
so that they may assume a sense of
control over this uniquely destabiliz
ing disease.
The class serves to increase
patients' knowledge of cancer so that
they may more easily articulate con
cerns to technically oriented
physicians and to improve communi
cation between them and family
members and friends.
"The class is half didactic and half
sharing feelings and ideas," said
Beverly Zenk Wheat, a registered on
cology nurse at Stanford Hospital and
one of three facilitators of the eight
week lecture course.
"The most important thing to learn
is to ask questions," said Miriam
Beinin, a social worker and co
facilitator.
The newly diagnosed cancer pa
tient, however, is usually not
equipped with enough understanding
to cut through the doctor's arsenal of
scientific language and explanation to
express true concerns within the brief
time of a doctor's appointment, ac
cording to Wheat.
"Because the doctors I deal with
are very busy, the class gives me a
chance to ask questions that there
otherwise is no time for," said course
enrollee Diane Kanerva, who was
diagnosed with cancer of the ovaries
last December.
According to Wheat, who worked
in Minnesota with the two women

founders of "I Can Cope" before
coming to Stanford, the feeling of in
adequacy in talking with doctors is
one of many patient concerns voiced
in the introductory class. "We went
around the room and asked,' What do
you want to get out of this class?' "
she said.
A common element in the answers
was the importance of managing
stress and how some of it may be al
leviated with the constructive support
of spouses, children and friends,
Wheat said. To manage stress, one
must understand its sources.
"It is a question of vulnerability,"

said Beinin. "The notion that some
thing is going on inside your body
that you can't control is very frighten
ing for people in our society, who
have relative control over their lives."
In addition, Beinin emphasized the
difficulty the cancer patient has in
identifying himself or herself as a
chronically ill person.
"It is hard to think of yourself as a
sick person," said Kanerva. "But I
had to get a lot of information so that
I knew what I could do to improve my
chances."
"I Can Cope" is a source of infor

mation for Kanerva and other class
members that clarifies the adjust
ments in lifestyle and relationships
needed to deal with cancer as comfor
tably as possible.
Lecture topics include, "Learning
to Live with Daily Health Problems:
Nutrition," "Expressing Your
Feelings: Communicating More Ef
fectively," "Maximizing Physical Fit
ness" and "Body Image and
Sexuality."
"You just don't get this at a doc
tor's office," said a woman whose
husband has prostate cancer.
By bringing people with cancer to

gether, "I Can Cope" helps them to
meet cancer's challenges by
demonstrating that no one is alone
with his or her illness.
"People are very eager to reach out
and help each other," said Susan
Weisberg, a social worker in Stanford
Hospital's radiology department and
the third facilitator for the class.
"What 1 like most is watching them
have sparks fly between them and get
some lasting connection out of it."
Weisberg, who is teaching her third
"I Can Cope" class, added that
"there's a depth of relationship that
comes to the group very quickly. Our

last group got down to a solid core of
people that still remains in contact."
Inevitably, however, the cancer pa
tient must face moments alone when
the "1 Can Cope" class is not con
vened.
"1 tell myself to relax first."
Kanerva said, "and that getting dis
couraged is natural and expected, but
it will not be as helpful to getting
healthy as being hopeful."
"It is a very challenging time of life
despite the stresses and pains," said
Weisberg. "It is rewarding to see
people when they're turning their
lives around, for the first time setting
priorities."
Having felt the fear that follows a
diagnosis of cancer, Kanerva, a
mother of three grown children and a
grandmother of a not-so-grown one,
advised, "Let a person suffering from
cancer know that you are still friends
and that you care. Cancer patients are
just ordinary people with this extra
problem to deal with."
"I Can Cope" ensures that this
problem is not dealt with alone, with
out the empathy of fellow cancer
patients or with the patient on the
sidelines while doctors huddle in the
middle of the field planning strategies
for treatment.
"It is vital that patients become ac
tive participants in the health care
team," Bcinin said.
Stanford Hospital and other medi
cal facilities and agencies offer sup
port groups that have specific empha
ses, such as a particular form of can
cer or a counseling-only format, while
the"I Can Cope" class represents
what Weisberg calls the "first major
educational effort to reach the people
en masse."
The class is taught in each of the 50
states. After it ends at Stanford, it will
move to El Camino Hospital in
Mountain View in March and on to
two San Jose locations in April and
May.
All newly diagnosed cancer
patients and their families are eligible
and can enroll by contacting the local
American Cancer Society office or by
