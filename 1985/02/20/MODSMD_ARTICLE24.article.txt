## Stanford women host No. 12 USC It's Miller time at Maples 
### PABLO MORALES Staff sportswriter 
All-American and Olympic gold medalist Cheryl Miller
is generally recognized as the consummate women's bas
ketball player. Tonight at 7:30 in Maples Pavilion, the
Stanford women's basketball team squares off against
Miller and the rest of the 12th-ranked, two-time defend
ing national champion USC Trojans.
To borrow a line from the commercial: It's Miller time.
Miller's numbers this year— 26 points and 16 rebounds
per game — are as outstanding as ever. Her play this
season is the main reason the Trojans have been able to
compile a 15-6 overall record despite losing All-
Americans Pam and Paula McGee to graduation.
Without the McGees, a revamped Trojan attack
struggled through the first part of the season, losing two
early Western Collegiate Athletic Association games to
San Diego State and conference leader Long Beach State.
Miller was the only bright spot for the Trojans, but even
she cannot win games all by herself, usually.
Currently, however, the Trojans are on a roll. With a
win over Fullerton State, 54-51, and a rematch victory
over third-ranked Long Beach State, 70-65, USC appears
to have regained the form that led it to two consecutive
national championships.
A major reason for this turnaround has been the emer
gence of 5-foot-8 senior guard Yolanda Fletcher and 6-0
freshman center Holly Ford in the Trojan attack.
Fletcher's 13 points and four rebounds per game, along
with Ford's 11 and five, have taken a great deal of pres
sure off Miller.
In their rematch with Long Beach, Fletcher's 12 points
and Ford's 14 combined with Miller's 23 points and 15
rebounds to create a well-rounded Trojan onslaught.
Against Fullerton State, all claims that the Trojans were
a one-player team were put to rest as USC overcame a
six-point deficit in the final two minutes to win. And it
did so Without the services of Miller, who had fouled out
earlier in the half.
After five straight conference losses, it would be easy
for next-to-last Stanford to give up and coast through the
remainder of the WCAA season. This is one of Head
Coach Dotty McCrea's biggest concerns.
"It would be easy for our players to take the rest of the
