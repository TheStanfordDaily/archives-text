# Women netters to get first test
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
The waiting is finally over for
the Stanford women's tennis team.
After five pushover matches
and then a week off, the Cardinal
gets its first test of the season
today against eighth-ranked Cali
fornia. The match begins at 1:30
p.m. in Stanford Tennis Stadium.
"We're ready," Stanford Coach
Frank Brennan said while survey
ing practice yesterday."I think
we're really playing well and I
think the team is anxious to play."
Stanford improved its record to
5-0 and extended its school-record
match-winning streak to 31 with
early-season victories over Fuller
ton State, the University of the
Pacific, San Jose State, UC-Davis
and UC-Santa Clara. Three of the

matches were 9-0 whitewashings
and the closest any team came was
7-2.
However, most of those
matches were played without
Stanford's best lineup, a luxury
Brennan won't be afforded today.
"Cal's a good team," he said.
"They haven't played up to their
potential this year, but they may
pop out of it against us."
For the first time in a few weeks,
all 11 Cardinal netters are healthy.
Freshmen Anna Ivan and Cari
Hagey just recovered from bouts
with the flu and are available
today, but Brennan said he may
give them the day off. "She is
feeling pretty good," Brennan said
of Ivan, who was a force before
she got sick, "but she doesn't have all
her stamina back yet."
If Ivan and Hagey sit out, Brennan
will probably go with a singles lineup
of one senior (Linda Gates), a junior
(Alyce Werdel), three sophomores
(Patty Fendick, Leigh Anne F.ldredge
and Stephanie Savides) and one
freshman (Kay Tittle). Savides' sister
plays for Cal, but the chances of a
sibling showdown are slim.
In the practices leading up to
today's match, Brennan said he em
phasized "mainly concentration," es
pecially after playing against oppo
nents where absolute concentration
hasn't been necessary.
"I've been pleased with the way
we've played against some of the
weaker opponents," he said. "I just
hope they can keep that up today
against Cal."
