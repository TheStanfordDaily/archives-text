# Ruggers sweep four
## 
### 
The Stanford women's rugby team
continued its winning ways Satur
day, going undefeated in a tourna
ment held here on Maloney Field.
The "Ladies' Luncheon," an an
nual Stanford tournament, attracted
seven local club teams as well as a
squad from Santa Monica. Stanford
went 4-0, beating Sacramento,
BASH (Bay Area She-Hawks) and a
tough Santa Monica team, twice. The
Cardinal defeated Santa Monica in
the finals by a score of 18-0.
The weekend's play leaves the
team with an unblemished overall
record and a league-leading mark of
3-0.
This year's team is once again led

by All-Leaguer Jennifer Crawford.
Her stellar performance earned her
the Most Valuable Back honor for
this weekend's tourney. Joining her in
the forward ranks are standout
graduate students Joan Saunders and
Jennifer Chue and junior Satela Fer
nandez.
Saunders and Chue add to the large
number of returning players on this
year's experienced squad. Several
first-year players, including Lisa Yan
nay and Susie Shimek, have also con
tributed to this year's team.
The ruggers will have this weekend
off, but will be hosting BASH on
March 2. *
