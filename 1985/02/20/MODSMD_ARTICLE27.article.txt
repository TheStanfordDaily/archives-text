# Gymnasts to compete in key six-way meet
## 
### CAROLYN TARKINGTON Staff sportswriter 
lonight the Stanford men's gymnastics team will com
pete in what may prove its toughest competition of the
season so far. The Cardinal will travel to Fullerton State
for a six-way competition against Illinois, Minnesota, New
Mexico, Nebraska and the host Titans.
"It will be significant for us to beat any of these teams,"
Coach Sadao Hamada said, "because right now they are
all ranked ahead of us, except for Cal State-Fullerton."
Nebraska and New Mexico will be the toughest teams
to beat, as they are currently ranked fourth and fifth,
respectively.
As of Feb. 2, the Cardinal men were ranked 13th, but
Hamada said that the past two meet scores recorded by
the Cardinal — 277.65 and 277.60 points — should raise

Stanford's ranking to seventh or eighth.
"Our aim is to hit in this meet like we have been in the
past few meets," Hamada said. "We need three good
away-meet scores to average with two good home-meet
scores in order to have a chance at the NCAAs.
"Our away-meet team total at Berkeley last week was
very good, and with three away meets left, every one of
them is going to be important to us."
All-around gymnast Randy Besosa said, "We want to
show the teams tonight that a school that is strong in
academics can also have strong athletic teams.
"In the recruiting process, some of these schools that
we'll be competing against tonight spread the rumor that
Stanford has good academics but will never be able to
produce a strong gymnastics team. We want to show them
that this just isn't true."
