## Writer Albee talks on fools and education 
### LISA LYNCH 
"The function of a formal education is to do two
things,' playwright Edward Albee told a capacity crowd
last night in Kresge Auditorium. "It teaches you how to
educate yourself, and how to make a fool out of yourself
in public."
The world-famous author of more than 25 plays
(including the Broadway hit, "Who's Afraid Of Virginia
Woolf') said that as an artist, the latter lesson is especially
important. "Anyone involved in the arts is going to make
a fool of themselves many times over," he said. "I cer
tainly have."
Albee read from his works, and briefly explained to the
audience "... who I am and how I got that way." A
refugee of several exclusive prep schools, Albee said that
he had "resisted formal education." He spent time at
Choate, Lawrenceville and Valley Forge Military
Academy. Describing Valley Forge, he said, "Only two
writers have come out of that school: J.D. Salinger and
me. Unfortunately, we were not there at the same
time. ... At the time I was there, the school only offered
two courses — sadism and masochism. These were com
pulsory. I passed both, developing a preference for one
over the other."
After graduating from Choate, Albee attended Trinity
for two years, but left after refusing to complete any re
quired courses. "These were not courses that 1 required,"
he said. "These were courses that were required of me."
Albee said he decided to become a writer when he was
very young. "1 hope I was six years old," he said. "That
would be wonderful; the year before the age of reason and
all of that." He wrote poetry from the age of six to 26, and
wrote two novels which he imagines to be among "the
worst literature written in English by anyone under 21."
After becoming disillusioned with poetry, Albee said he
found himself, at the brink of 30, a writer without a
medium.
It was at this time that he wrote "Zoo Story," his first
play. "It revealed to me that I'd been a playwright all my
life," he said, "and I hadn't known it because I hadn't

written a play."
"I like being a playwright — which is good, because that
is what I am," Albee said. "There are some things I don't
like about contemporary theater, but I like drama's im
mediacy. Drama at its best is an act of aggression against
society. ... It holds a mirror up to people and says, 'This
is who you are and how you act.' "
Albee read scenes from "Zoo Story," "A Delicate Bal
ance," "All Over" and "Seascape."
In an earlier interview, Albee told The Daily that he
thought campus readings were valuable "if they are well
done." He said he had known both good and terrible
readers, and he considered himself to be fairly good. "A
good reader can tell you something about how the author
feels about his own work," he added.
When asked how he would advise would-be
playwrights, Albee said, "Make sure it's something you
have to do, or else you simply would not be complete." A
college degree is not required, "just as long as one is
aware of the competition from Sophocles on."
Albee said he would describe himself as a playwright
"in progress," and commented that the "theater of the ab
surd" label often given to his work is a philosophical, not
artistic, definition. "Almost anyone who thinks and writes
in a post-existential age is going to be absurd," he said.
Albee said that theater in America exists, "with few ex
ceptions," only in small, experimental venues. "On
Broadway, people seem to want to pay more and more
dollars for less and less truth,"he said. On the other hand,
he said, "there seem to be more interesting young
playwrights around than ever before. The public is just
misinformed."
Albee's contributions to aspiring playwrights include
seeing "too many" new plays, and teaching in several one
month stints at universities around the country. "I don't
do lectures," he said. "I prefer craft work."
Albee's work habits include "artificial deadlines, which
I frequently miss, a long time thinking about my work
(anywhere from six months to 10 years) and a short time
writing."

he had "resisted formal education." He spent time at
Choate, Lawrenceville and Valley Forge Military
Academy. Describing Valley Forge, he said, "Only two
writers have come out of that school: J.D. Salinger and
me. Unfortunately, we were not there at the same
time. ... At the time I was there, the school only offered
two courses — sadism and masochism. These were com
pulsory. I passed both, developing a preference for one
over the other."
After graduating from Choate, Albee attended Trinity
for two years, but left after refusing to complete any re
quired courses. "These were not courses that 1 required,"
he said. "These were courses that were required of me."
Albee said he decided to become a writer when he was
very young. "1 hope I was six years old," he said. "That
would be wonderful; the year before the age of reason and
all of that." He wrote poetry from the age of six to 26, and
wrote two novels which he imagines to be among "the
worst literature written in English by anyone under 21."
After becoming disillusioned with poetry, Albee said he
found himself, at the brink of 30, a writer without a
medium.
It was at this time that he wrote "Zoo Story," his first
play. "It revealed to me that I'd been a playwright all my
life," he said, "and I hadn't known it because I hadn't

written a play."
"I like being a playwright — which is good, because that
is what I am," Albee said. "There are some things I don't
like about contemporary theater, but I like drama's im
mediacy. Drama at its best is an act of aggression against
society. ... It holds a mirror up to people and says, 'This
is who you are and how you act.' "
Albee read scenes from "Zoo Story," "A Delicate Bal
ance," "All Over" and "Seascape."
In an earlier interview, Albee told The Daily that he
thought campus readings were valuable "if they are well
done." He said he had known both good and terrible
readers, and he considered himself to be fairly good. "A
good reader can tell you something about how the author
feels about his own work," he added.
When asked how he would advise would-be
playwrights, Albee said, "Make sure it's something you
have to do, or else you simply would not be complete." A
college degree is not required, "just as long as one is
aware of the competition from Sophocles on."
Albee said he would describe himself as a playwright
"in progress," and commented that the "theater of the ab
surd" label often given to his work is a philosophical, not
artistic, definition. "Almost anyone who thinks and writes
in a post-existential age is going to be absurd," he said.
Albee said that theater in America exists, "with few ex
ceptions," only in small, experimental venues. "On
Broadway, people seem to want to pay more and more
dollars for less and less truth,"he said. On the other hand,
he said, "there seem to be more interesting young
playwrights around than ever before. The public is just
misinformed."
Albee's contributions to aspiring playwrights include
seeing "too many" new plays, and teaching in several one
month stints at universities around the country. "I don't
do lectures," he said. "I prefer craft work."
Albee's work habits include "artificial deadlines, which
I frequently miss, a long time thinking about my work
(anywhere from six months to 10 years) and a short time
writing."

Playwright Edward Albee read from his works and spoke to his audience about formal education last night,
telling it that "anyone involved in the arts is going to make a fool of themselves many times over."
