# Researcher discusses Soviet objectives
## 
### KATHLEEN O'ROURKE 
David Holloway, a senior research
associate at the Center for Interna
tional Security and Arms Control,
told a small audience at the Bechtel
International Center yesterday after
noon that the proposed U.S. "Star
Wars" defense program will ad
versely affect Soviet objectives in up
coming arms control negotiations.
He noted, though, that the "Soviet
return to the negotiating table is
probably due mostly to concern over
the U.S. proposed Strategic Defense
Initiative (SDI)."
The Soviet concern must be signifi
cant since the Soviets had "previously
said that they would not come back
(to negotiations) unless the United
States removed the missiles deployed
to Western Europe," Holloway said.
Holloway said the Soviet newspa

per Pravda reported that the Soviets
accuse the United States of "trying to
take away an assured retaliation in
the event of a first strike by building
defense systems."
It could "open floodgates to an
arms race in offensive and defensive
systems. As a result, war will become
more likely by giving the illusion of
invulnerability to the United States
and increase the probability of a U.S.
first strike," said Holloway, quoting
Pravda.
He said there is a "certain degree
of irony to the situation" because the
Soviet arguments against U.S.
defense development are exactly the
same as the ones the United States
used on the Soviets in earlier anti
ballistic missile (ABM) limitation
treaties.
Those were the days when the

United States felt that increased So
viet defense meant a retaliatory in
crease in offense to ensure a certain
percentage of warheads reach their
targets, he noted. The end result? An
escalation in the arms race.
The Reagan initiative to "deploy
research on a system (SDI) that
would render an offensive strike inef
fective" has left the Soviets three pos
sible counter-measures, he said.
"First, they can improve their of
fensive force so that they can he sure
to always bre'ak through any defense
system. Second, they can develop an
anti-satellite weapons system, and it
looks like that has already been
stepped up. Third, they can deploy
ABM systems themselves, which
their scientists have recommended
against," he said.
