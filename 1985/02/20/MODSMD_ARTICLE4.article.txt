# Humane societies try for new ways to fight cruelty
## 
### BARBARA SCHULER Staff writer 
The efforts of local humane societies to improve the
care received by the University's laboratory animals have
shifted but not abated, as a result of the recent dismissal of
an animal-cruelty lawsuit brought against Stanford and
four other defendants.
The complaints of animal rights activists about condi
tions at the Palo Alto Veteran's Administration Medical
Center and assertions of Stanford's complicity in the
death of a research dog there have not been quelled by the
Feb. 5 ruling of Federal Judge Stanley Weigel.
While the question of whether to appeal the case to a
higher court has yet to be decided by the plaintiffs, their
emphasis seems to be changing from litigation to legisla
tion,
"We must fight for legislation that will include re
searchers and research institutions under state anti
cruelty statutes," said Lise Giraud, member of
the Paio Alto Humane Society's board of directors.
Currently, all "properly conducted research" is exempt
from these statutes — a difficult qualification to disprove,
according to Giraud.
In addition to legislation targeting the exempt status of
researchers, animal rights activists will likely back state
Sen. David Roberti's bill when it is re-introduced
during the new session of the senate. The bill, which
would prevent pound animals from being used for re
search purposes, has twice failed to pass.
Stanford Medical School Assoc. Dean David Mendelow
agrees that the courts aren't the place to resolve such
disputes. "It's not the job of the courts to set standards in
a case like this. It's the job of authorized legislation."
As far as any new legislation is concerned. "There are
significant statutes on the books, and Stanford's animal
care program more than complies with them." he added.
On this point, he and the humane societies are not in

agreement. Complaints lodged by the plaintiffs include
the irresponsibility of the University's internal policing
mechanism — the animal care committee — and specifi
cally, the lack of representation on that committee by
anyone from the animal rights community.
"Their animal care committee, they're all doctors and
researchers. They don't have anyone from the
humanitarian community (on the committee). They've
refused to consider it. NASA, UCSF, UC-Berkeley and
the University of Southern California all have someone
from the animal rights community on their committees,"
said Warren Brodrick, executive director of the Humane
Society of Santa Clara Valley.
But according to the animal care committee chair,
Frances Connelly, committee members not only have con
sidered it, but they have added to the 10-member com
mittee "an outside veterinarian . . . who has his feet firmly
entrenched in the humane society mainstream." She
describes him as "wear(ing) two hats. Not only is he an
outside veterinarian who has a private practice, but he is
the vet who takes care of all the humane society's
animals."
The committee, which reviews between 30 and 80 re
search protocols each month, includes "one law professor,
the dean of the chapel, one Stanford student, one outside
veterinarian and one public member," as well as five prin
ciple investigators from both the medical center and the
University-at-large whose research involves the animals,
Connelly said.
She added, however, that she was unsure whether the
current composition of the panel is "found acceptable" by
the animal rights community.
Ciiraud says it is not. "No animal care committee is
really truly representative of people who care about
animals unless it has more than one token member from
