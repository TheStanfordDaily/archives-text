# Senate plans committee charge
## Draft to Stanford-Hoover group emphasizes academics over politics 
### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
When the Faculty Senate agreed
Feb. 7 to examine the effects of
strengthening ties between Stanford
and the Hoover Institution, the ques
tion remained as to how broad — or
narrow — the senate's investigation
would be.
Would the senate committee hide
behind the shadow of the Ward
Report recommendations, limiting its
scope to a study of how joint appoint
ments between Stanford and Hoover
might affect the University? Or
would the senate, picking up where
Profs. John Manley and Ronald Reb
holz left off, launch a full-scale inves
tigation into the propriety of housing
a partisan think tank on campus?
Senators moved to answer these
questions recently when two senate
committees released a draft of their
charge to the senate Committee on
Stanford-Hoover Academic Re
lationships. According to that
document and comments from its
authors, the new committee will
indeed venture beyond the issues
raised by the Ward recommendations
— and yet it will also confine itself
strictly to academic, not political,
questions.
Microbiology Prof. Leon Rosen
berg, a member of the senate's Com

mittee on Committees, characterized
this middle route best.
"If you review the Ward recom
mendations in a critical way, you have
to take a broader view," Rosenberg
said. But, he emphasized, the com
mittee will not go so far as to "look at
the supposition that either
(University) departments or Hoover
are to the left or right of where
anybody would like them to be."
Rosenberg said he could not sup
port such a "political witch hunt."
Craig Heller, professor of biology
and author of the resolution, agreed
that "such a committee must take a
broader view" than the Ward Com
mittee did, but he too stops short of
endorsing a political investigation.
"Manley and Rebholz are essen
tially asking the faculty to investigate
the Hoover," Heller said. "The fac
ulty has no authority to investigate
the Hoover. It's like saying the Fac
ulty Senate should investigate Mayor
Feinstein's office. It's something we
have no authority to do."
The charge, issued in draft form by
the senate's Steering Committee and
Committee on Committees, will come
before the full senate tomorrow for a
vote. The charge calls for the new
committee, which will be staffed by
seven voting senators and one ex of
ficio member, to investigate, among

other things, "the relationship of the
Hoover Institution to the academic
structure of Stanford University."
According to the charge, the com
mittee should " make certain (through
hearings, etc.) that the academic is
sues which should bear on these
relationships are frankly and fully and
publicly addressed."
The committee will also be charged
to investigate the benefits and costs of
implementation of the Ward recom
mendations, and determine "what, if
anything, can be done to maximize
the benefits and minimize the costs in
each case."
Senate Chair John Merryman, pro
fessor of law, said the relevant ques
tion is not whether the charge is de
signed with the Ward recommen
dations in mind, but if it is an accurate
reflection of the resolution which led
to the creation of the committee.
"The primary concern was the dis
cussion at the last Faculty Senate
meeting," Merryman said.
Merryman, too, is careful to note
that the committee will not enter the
political arena.
"This is not to be considered some
sort of faculty adoption of the Manley
petition or the Manley-Rebholz let-,
ter," Merryman said.
Manley and Rebholz sent a letter
to all senators just before the Feb. 7

meeting urging them to create a com
mittee to examine the Ward Report
and the broader issue of Stanford-
Hoover relations.
Merryman said the senate "took
some trouble to separate itself from
the Manley-Rebholz letter" during its
discussion of the issue.
Philosophy Prof. John Perry, chair
of the senate's Committee on Com
mittees, said, "I don't see this is a
full-scale investigation of the Hoover
Institution of the sort that has been
called for by Manley and Rebholz."
But Manley praised the senators
for writing a charge that attempts "to
engender a full and open discussion"
on Stanford-Hoover relationships;
particularly in its call for hearings.
"The only Manley-Rebholz ball
there is, is an attempt to force these
issues into public discussion," Manley
said last night. "Now we have a forum
within which the questions and con
cerns of people like (Political Science
Prof.) David Abernethy — not just
Manley-Rebholz — can be heard."
Responding to assertions that the
senate committee will not consider
the political history of Hoover, Man
ley said, "1 really can't believe that if
this committee has hearings it will at
tempt to constrain the free and open
. . . views regarding the issue."
Manley called the hearings a
"major change and a major improve
ment on this campus."
Perry said although the committee
will not examine the political issues of
"whether the Hoover Institution is
predominantly conservative," it will

carefully assess the relationship be
tween Stanford and Hoover.
"Many faculty members for a long
time have been perplexed by exactly
what the relationship" between the
two parties should be, Perry said.
"And by perplexity we don't mean
impropriety," he added.
Last November, a six-member
resource group headed by Robert
Ward, a professor of political science
and & senior research fellow at

Hoover, said in a report that more
joint appointments between Stanford
and Hoover could create a prestigious
social sciences program here that
would rival Harvard's John F. Ken
nedy School of Government.
The senate voted unanimously at
its last meeting to create the Commit
tee on Stanford-Hoover Academic
Relationships to assess how the Ward
recommendations, if implemented,
would affect the reputation of the
University.
