Harvard University's divestment from Baker In
ternational Corp. last week may cause Stanford of
ficials to consider selling 2,000 shares of stock in
the City of Orange-based mining equipment corpo
ration.
Harvard divested in response to Baker's "policy
to not permit us to investigate what we wanted to,"
according to Harvard Treasurer Roderick
McDougal.
In December Harvard officials had a "dialogue"
with Baker, but the "corporation would not supply
information" that the university requested, said
John Shattuck, Harvard's vice president for gov
ernment communications and public affairs. The
company was unwilling to prove that it is adhering
to the Sullivan and Tutu Principles, Shattuck said.
"Harvard has a blanket policy on all of its in
vestments" stipulating that all firms in which it
owns stock must comply with the Sullivan and Tutu
Principles, Shattuck said.
Harvard was holding 60,000 shares worth $1.1
million, he said.
Mark Landesmann, a member of Stanford's
Committee on Investment Responsibility (C-IR),

said the Baker issue will be considered at a C-IR
meeting tomorrow, but said consideration would be
hampered by the short notice the committee had of
Harvard's action.
But C-IR Chairman Richard Brody said there is
no mention of Baker on the agenda. "We already
have a policy based on the Sullivan principles," he
said, but added that the Baker case "will probably
be mentioned."
"I'm very glad that Harvard has addressed this
issue," Landesmann said.
Rodney Turner,, a corporate vice president for
Baker, said," I certainly am not pleased" with Har
vard's decision to divest. "We're distressed that
Harvard felt that our posture was inadequately dis
closed.
"Harvard is a representation of an attitude"
toward divestiture, he added.
"I wouldn't have known Harvard had any of our
stock if this hadn't occurred. ... I don't know who
has our stock." the Baker official said.
The Sullivan principles, developed by Rev. Leon
Sullivan of Philadelphia, are designed as an equal
opportunity code for blacks. The Tutu principles
"really call on corporations to take action in South
Africa .. . (and) call for companies to take a much

more active role in combating apartheid," Shattuck
explained.
William Massy, Stanford's vice president for
business and finance, said he would not comment
extensively on the case because "I don't know the
basis of Harvard's action and the nature of our
holdings."
Stanford Treasurer Rod Adams noted that the
Baker stock was acquired when a company in
which the University owned stock merged with
Baker.
Stanford tried to sell the stock shortly after it was
acquired but was not successful. Now the stock has
dropped so much in value that the University is no
longer trying to sell it, Adams said.
The University's 2,000 shares in Baker were ac
tually given to Stanford as a gift and were subse
quently placed in a "special fund," Massy said. The
special fund prohibits the University from selling
the stock unless permission is granted by the donor.
Harvard's action was viewed favorably by the
student body, according to Harvard Crimson News
Editor Joe Menn. "Generally students responded
with praise for the university," he said.
Menn said he believes the divest
ment has caused some students to
reconsider their positions on the
issue. Some people who are totally

opposed to business ties to South
Africa considered Harvard's action
"only a tiny step in the right direc
tion," he said.
Brian Melendez, chairman of Har
vard's undergraduate council, said,
"We're not going to know for months
if it (the divestment) is significant."
