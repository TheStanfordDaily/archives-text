Airliner crash in Spain kills 151
MADRID, Spain — An Iberia Airline Boeing 727 crashed into a
mountain on approach to Bilbao airport yesterday, apparently killing all
151 persons aboard, including a Bolivian Cabinet minister and a former
Spanish foreign minister.
As a 70-man rescue party began combing the smoldering wreckage
on 3,385-feet-high Monte Oiz mountain, rumors spread through Madrid
that the Madrid-Bilbao flight, as well as one on Monday, had been
delayed by Basque terrorist bomb threats.
The cause of the crash, however, was not immediately known.
Rescuers, arriving on foot and by helicopter, soon gave up hope of fin
ding any survivors among the 144 passengers and seven crew members
in this the third major air disaster in Spain in 15 months.
Basque television said the aircraft strafed television transmission tow
ers atop the mountain, possibly causing the crash. Residents of nearby
Makina village said the airliner immediately burst into flames upon
crashing.
Rescue teams spotted wreckage shortly after the plane was reported
missing at 10 a.m. and immediately said there were no-survivors, al
though an Iberia Airline spokesman held out hope for a time that per
haps 40 could have survived.
Bolivian Labor Minister Gonzalo Equez was on board the aircraft, ac
cording to the passenger list. He was on his way to visit the Babcock-
Wilcox company near the Basque provincial capital of Bilbao.
Gregorio Bravo, a minister for industry and foreign affairs under
Generalismo Francisco Franco, was also on board. His family confirmed
that he was on his way to Bilbao for business as a director of the Banco
Espanol De Credito.
The Boeing 727' left the Madrid Barajas Airport at 8:41 a.m. for Bil
bao without any problems. Radio contact with the pilot, Jose Luis
Patino, was lost after about 45 minutes when the plane was already des
cending for its landing in Bilbao.
The Bilbao-Sondica Aiiport is considered dangerous because it is sur
rounded by mountains and often experiences, poor visibility caused by
frequent rainfall and fog.
However, Capt. Patino, the pilot, knew the airport well and was re
garded as an experienced pilot, his colleagues said. And the weather was
also described as "normal," with a light haze below the clouds.
Furor continues over missing agent
MEXICO CITY — Paralyzing customs inspections of Mexican border
traffic and other expressions of U.S. dissatisfaction with Mexico's search
for a kidnapped* U.S. narcotics agent have angered Mexican leaders,
prompting the delivery of a diplomatic protest note.
For the past four days, Mexican motorists crossing into the United
States have been subjected to exhaustive inspections by U.S. customs of
ficers, said to be seeking clues to the Feb. 7 abduction in Guadalajara of
Enrique Camarena Salazar, a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration
official. The resulting massive border tie-ups have been "clearly a way of
putting pressure on the Mexicans to shape up and get something going"
in the Camerena investigation, one informed U.S. source said.
In response, Foreign Minister Bernardo Sepulveda ordered Mexico's
ambassador in Washington, Jorge Espinoza de los Reyes, to present to
the State Department a diplomatic note demanding an explanation of
the measures, Sepulveda said Monday night. Breaking with precedent
the United States did not inform the Mexican government of the border
action beforehand, Sepulveda said.
A State Department spokeswoman in Washington declined to com
ment on the report of the diplomatic protest.
Pope, Peres at odds but cordial
VATICAN CITY — Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres and Pope
John Paul II disagreed in a meeting here yesterday on some steps toward
Middle East peace but parted cordially, in contrast to the last meeting
between a pope and an Israeli head of government 12 years ago.
In a 40-minute private meeting with Peres, the pontiff, according to a
Vatican spokesman, did not budge from his position of last April in favor
of an "internationally guaranteed" status for Jerusalem, a Palestinian
homeland and security for Israel.
"I told His Holiness that Jerusalem remains the unified capital of Is
rael," Peres reported to journalists after the papal audience.
"It was clear in our discussion that we must distinguish between the
religious and the political parts of the question of Jerusalem, " he said.
"Our government respects the religious rights, needs and expectations of
all religions."
Although the Vatican had indicated that it would make no public
comment after the meeting, the senior Vatican spokesman, Joaquin
Navarro, reacted to Peres' remarks by reminding reporters that the posi
tion of the Holy See remains unchanged. Implying continued disagree
ment between the pontiff and the Israeli government, Navarro chose a
diplomatically low-key phrase and characterized the respective positions
as "not identical." He said the meeting was "cordial."
The last Israeli prime minister to meet a pope was the late Golda
Meir, who visited Pope Paul VI in 1973. During her audience, the
Vatican issued a statement in support of Arab nations in conflict with Is
rael, and Mrs. Meir reacted angrily.
Gulf shippers expect new attacks
ABU DHABI — Gulf shippers braced yesterday for a new round of
escalation in the Iran-Iraq tanker war after alleged Iranian attacks killed
a Japanese sailor and damaged two ships earlier this week.
The Japanese helmsman of the Kuwaiti-registered container ship Al-
Manakh was killed and two fellow Japanese sailors were seriously
injured Monday when warplanes believed to be Iranian raided the vessel
north of the Abu Dhabi coast.
Shipping sources said a South Korean tanker was hit by an Iranian air
to-ground missile Monday as it sailed close to the crippled Al-Manakh,
but damage was slight and there were no casualties among its 28-
member crew.
The attacks apparently ended an eight-week unilateral cease-fire by
Iran.
The attacks occurred just next to a floating offshore rig in the United
Arab Emirates oilfield of Abu Bakoush, which extends over 75 square
miles along the territorial water line dividing the UAE and Iran at the
eastern end of the Persian Gulf.
The Al-Manakh, which is registered in Kuwait but belongs jointly to
Iraq and live other Arab countries along the gulf, arrived for repairs
early yesterday at the UAE port of Rashid.
Arab press reports said, meanwhile, that Iraq was threatening to ex
tend its gulf air raids to cover all Iranian ports.
Vietnam waging chemical war?
BANGKOK. Thailand — Thailand yesterday accused Vietnam of
using toxic chemicals in battles against Cambodian resistance guerrillas
along the Thai-Cambodian border and said it Would lodge a protest at
the United Nations.
The Thai military supreme commander, Gen. Arthit Kamlang-ek, said
the Army Scientific Department had found evidence for the first time
that rocket rounds fired by Vietnamese forces contained illegal chemi
cals.
The charge coincided with a claim by the Khmer Rouge guerrilla
group that 11 of its fighters were in serious condition suffering from the
effects of chemical rounds fired at them Monday.
Neither charge could immediately be confirmed independently. An
official of the Army Scientific Department in Bangkok said he had no
evidence that the rockets contained banned chemicals. Western relief of
ficials cautioned that recent mysterious deaths and illnesses of Cam
bodians along the border required further investigation before a cause
could be pinpointed.
The U.S. Embassy in Bangkok has sent members of its special
chemical-biological warfafe investigative unit to look into the charges,
diplomats said.
The United States has accused Vietnam of using illegal chemical
weapons in Camb<xlia and Laos against resistance groups for several
years, but has said that incidents dropped off sharply in 1984.

VATICAN CITY — Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres and Pope
John Paul II disagreed in a meeting here yesterday on some steps toward
Middle East peace but parted cordially, in contrast to the last meeting
between a pope and an Israeli head of government 12 years ago.
In a 40-minute private meeting with Peres, the pontiff, according to a
Vatican spokesman, did not budge from his position of last April in favor
of an "internationally guaranteed" status for Jerusalem, a Palestinian
homeland and security for Israel.
"I told His Holiness that Jerusalem remains the unified capital of Is
rael," Peres reported to journalists after the papal audience.
"It was clear in our discussion that we must distinguish between the
religious and the political parts of the question of Jerusalem, " he said.
"Our government respects the religious rights, needs and expectations of
all religions."
Although the Vatican had indicated that it would make no public
comment after the meeting, the senior Vatican spokesman, Joaquin
Navarro, reacted to Peres' remarks by reminding reporters that the posi
tion of the Holy See remains unchanged. Implying continued disagree
ment between the pontiff and the Israeli government, Navarro chose a
diplomatically low-key phrase and characterized the respective positions
as "not identical." He said the meeting was "cordial."
The last Israeli prime minister to meet a pope was the late Golda
Meir, who visited Pope Paul VI in 1973. During her audience, the
Vatican issued a statement in support of Arab nations in conflict with Is
rael, and Mrs. Meir reacted angrily.
Gulf shippers expect new attacks
ABU DHABI — Gulf shippers braced yesterday for a new round of
escalation in the Iran-Iraq tanker war after alleged Iranian attacks killed
a Japanese sailor and damaged two ships earlier this week.
The Japanese helmsman of the Kuwaiti-registered container ship Al-
Manakh was killed and two fellow Japanese sailors were seriously
injured Monday when warplanes believed to be Iranian raided the vessel
north of the Abu Dhabi coast.
Shipping sources said a South Korean tanker was hit by an Iranian air
to-ground missile Monday as it sailed close to the crippled Al-Manakh,
but damage was slight and there were no casualties among its 28-
member crew.
The attacks apparently ended an eight-week unilateral cease-fire by
Iran.
The attacks occurred just next to a floating offshore rig in the United
Arab Emirates oilfield of Abu Bakoush, which extends over 75 square
miles along the territorial water line dividing the UAE and Iran at the
eastern end of the Persian Gulf.
The Al-Manakh, which is registered in Kuwait but belongs jointly to
Iraq and live other Arab countries along the gulf, arrived for repairs
early yesterday at the UAE port of Rashid.
Arab press reports said, meanwhile, that Iraq was threatening to ex
tend its gulf air raids to cover all Iranian ports.
Vietnam waging chemical war?
BANGKOK. Thailand — Thailand yesterday accused Vietnam of
using toxic chemicals in battles against Cambodian resistance guerrillas
along the Thai-Cambodian border and said it Would lodge a protest at
the United Nations.
The Thai military supreme commander, Gen. Arthit Kamlang-ek, said
the Army Scientific Department had found evidence for the first time
that rocket rounds fired by Vietnamese forces contained illegal chemi
cals.
The charge coincided with a claim by the Khmer Rouge guerrilla
group that 11 of its fighters were in serious condition suffering from the
effects of chemical rounds fired at them Monday.
Neither charge could immediately be confirmed independently. An
official of the Army Scientific Department in Bangkok said he had no
evidence that the rockets contained banned chemicals. Western relief of
ficials cautioned that recent mysterious deaths and illnesses of Cam
bodians along the border required further investigation before a cause
could be pinpointed.
The U.S. Embassy in Bangkok has sent members of its special
chemical-biological warfafe investigative unit to look into the charges,
diplomats said.
The United States has accused Vietnam of using illegal chemical
weapons in Camb<xlia and Laos against resistance groups for several
years, but has said that incidents dropped off sharply in 1984.
Airliner crash in Spain kills 151
MADRID, Spain — An Iberia Airline Boeing 727 crashed into a
mountain on approach to Bilbao airport yesterday, apparently killing all
151 persons aboard, including a Bolivian Cabinet minister and a former
Spanish foreign minister.
As a 70-man rescue party began combing the smoldering wreckage
on 3,385-feet-high Monte Oiz mountain, rumors spread through Madrid
that the Madrid-Bilbao flight, as well as one on Monday, had been
delayed by Basque terrorist bomb threats.
The cause of the crash, however, was not immediately known.
Rescuers, arriving on foot and by helicopter, soon gave up hope of fin
ding any survivors among the 144 passengers and seven crew members
in this the third major air disaster in Spain in 15 months.
Basque television said the aircraft strafed television transmission tow
ers atop the mountain, possibly causing the crash. Residents of nearby
Makina village said the airliner immediately burst into flames upon
crashing.
Rescue teams spotted wreckage shortly after the plane was reported
missing at 10 a.m. and immediately said there were no-survivors, al
though an Iberia Airline spokesman held out hope for a time that per
haps 40 could have survived.
Bolivian Labor Minister Gonzalo Equez was on board the aircraft, ac
cording to the passenger list. He was on his way to visit the Babcock-
Wilcox company near the Basque provincial capital of Bilbao.
Gregorio Bravo, a minister for industry and foreign affairs under
Generalismo Francisco Franco, was also on board. His family confirmed
that he was on his way to Bilbao for business as a director of the Banco
Espanol De Credito.
The Boeing 727' left the Madrid Barajas Airport at 8:41 a.m. for Bil
bao without any problems. Radio contact with the pilot, Jose Luis
Patino, was lost after about 45 minutes when the plane was already des
cending for its landing in Bilbao.
The Bilbao-Sondica Aiiport is considered dangerous because it is sur
rounded by mountains and often experiences, poor visibility caused by
frequent rainfall and fog.
However, Capt. Patino, the pilot, knew the airport well and was re
garded as an experienced pilot, his colleagues said. And the weather was
also described as "normal," with a light haze below the clouds.
Furor continues over missing agent
MEXICO CITY — Paralyzing customs inspections of Mexican border
traffic and other expressions of U.S. dissatisfaction with Mexico's search
for a kidnapped* U.S. narcotics agent have angered Mexican leaders,
prompting the delivery of a diplomatic protest note.
For the past four days, Mexican motorists crossing into the United
States have been subjected to exhaustive inspections by U.S. customs of
ficers, said to be seeking clues to the Feb. 7 abduction in Guadalajara of
Enrique Camarena Salazar, a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration
official. The resulting massive border tie-ups have been "clearly a way of
putting pressure on the Mexicans to shape up and get something going"
in the Camerena investigation, one informed U.S. source said.
In response, Foreign Minister Bernardo Sepulveda ordered Mexico's
ambassador in Washington, Jorge Espinoza de los Reyes, to present to
the State Department a diplomatic note demanding an explanation of
the measures, Sepulveda said Monday night. Breaking with precedent
the United States did not inform the Mexican government of the border
action beforehand, Sepulveda said.
A State Department spokeswoman in Washington declined to com
ment on the report of the diplomatic protest.
