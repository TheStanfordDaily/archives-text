# Seven killed near Cape Town
## 
### 
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — Seven
more blacks were killed yesterday in a second day
of running battles with South African police at the
Crossroads squatter settlement outside Cape
Town. The deaths brought the official toll there to
13 dead and more than 200 people injured.
Meanwhile, the government charged six
prominent anti-apartheid activists with high
treason yesterday and detained seven others for in
terrogation in a new crackdown on opposition
groups.
The fiercest clashes at Crossroads occurred in
late afternoon as several thousand rioters, hurling
stones and flaming bottles of gasoline, advanced on
government offices and electric power transmission
facilities near the settlement, protecting themselves
with makeshift shields of corrugated steel taken
from the shantytown's shacks.
The police, reinforced by heavily armed
paramilitary units, fired volleys of tear gas
grenades, rubber bullets and birdshot to turn back
the rioters. Later, automatic rifle fire was heard

from around the settlement, according to residents
reached by telephone, and more casualties were
feared.
By nightfall, however, the fighting had subsided
and an uneasy truce prevailed. Crossroads leaders
were working with local government officials to
restore calm, and the police promised to withdraw
from the immediate vicinity in return for a commu
nity pledge to clear barricaded roads and halt the
attacks on administration offices.
The treason arrests did not appear to be directly
connected to the unrest near Cape Town. The six
charged with treason include three top officials of
the United Democratic Front, a coalition of 645
groups opposed to South Africa's apartheid policy
of racial segregation, two labor union organizers
and an Indian community leader.
Arrested in pre-dawn raids by security police on
more than 25 offices and residences across the
country, the six will be tried with eight other anti
apartheid activists, all affiliated with the multi
racial United Democratic Front, who were charged

with treason in December. A preliminary hearing
in the case is scheduled for March 29, but the trial
is not expected to start until June.
The immediate impact of the arrests was to
diminish what modest hopes had been engendered
by recent government promises of political reforms
giving blacks a voice in decision-making and the
planning of the country's future.
The focus of the Crossroads dispute in Cape
Town is the fear of the shantytown's 65,000 resi
dents that they will be forcibly moved to a new
settlement being constructed for blacks farther
from Cape Town and that some will be taken back
to the rural tribal homelands they left in order to
find work in the metropolitan area.
The unrest at the squatter settlement is the worst
that South Africa has experienced in three months,
and it has raised fears both within and outside the
government that the country may be slipping into a
new spiral of escalating racial violence that would
make even modest reforms virtually impossible be
cause of a conservative white backlash.
