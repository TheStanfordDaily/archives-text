Now is the time for undergraduates and
graduates thinking of applying for
resident staff (RA)
positions
to talk with current RFs and RAs about job
responsibilities and the relative advantages
of the different types of residences (all
frosh, four-class, upperclass, apartments).
Before the information meetings on
MARCH 5, 6, and 7
from 4:15-5:15
in Cubberley 133
take time to ask questions so that you will make
informed decisions once staff selection begins.
