Pentagon talks tough
WASHINGTON — The Pentagon is studying
"possible options" that include going beyond
current arms control treaties on offensive nuclear
weapons and hastening development of "missile
defenses of our own" if the Soviets break away
from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty,
Richard Perle, assistant secretary of defense, said
yesterday.
His testimony before the Senate Armed
Services Committee went further than any ad
ministration official has before in suggesting how
the government might respond to a Soviet
"breakout" from the terms of the ABM pact,
which limits both powers to one major ABM site.
The administration says there are signs that the
Soviets may be moving instead toward a
nationwide defensive system.
That is one of a number of arms treaty viola
tions U.S. officials have charged to the Soviets in
recent months. Officials now have begun to use
these reported violations in Congress to justify
the president's defense budget and his proposed
Strategic Defense Initiative — his "Star Wars"
research plan to develop a futuristic missile
defense system in space.
Perle cited a long string of what he called

"militarily significant" Soviet arms violations,
then told the committee, "We must now create
penalties for violations that deny the benefits of
the violations to the U.S.S.R. . . . This could in
volve research, development or deployments
which at least offset the advantage obtained by
the Soviets.'"
He warned that such actions would be expen
sive, but added that unless Congress appears
ready to endorse retaliatory steps, "we would
simply encourage the Soviet Union to further
erode the ABM treaty."
Zaccaro guilty of fraud
NEW YORK — John Zaccaro, whose finan
cial dealings cast a pall over his wife's vice presi
dential campaign, was sentenced yesterday to
perform 150 hours of community service for his
part in a fraudulent real estate loan scheme.
"I have learned my lesson, judge, the hard
way," said Zaccaro, husband of former Rep.
Geraldinc Ferraro (D-N.Y.). "1 will serve
whatever your decision is, and 1 know it will be
fair."
Acting Justice George Roberts of state su
preme court, a trial court in New York, said the
loan scheme appeared to be an isolated incident

and he felt there was "little or no chance" that
Zaccaro would be involved in criminal activity
again.
But "that does not mean some sanction should
not be imposed," he added. Zaccaro was assured
that he would serve no jail time as part of the
bargain under which he pleaded guilty Jan. 7 to
one count of scheming to defraud.
The judge ordered him to serve 50 hours each
at the Andrew Glover Youth Program, St.
Francis House — a home for the aged in the
Herald Square area — and the Legal Aid Society
Ferraro, who made history when Demo
crat Walter Mondale chose her as the first
woman on a major national ticket, was not in the
courtroom. Zaccaro has said he pleaded guilty to
spare his family the anguish and publicity of a
trial.
Market gains slightly
The stock market eked out some scattered
gains yesterday, halting the decline of the past
three sessions.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, off
17.33 in the three previous trading days,
rebounded 2.54 to 1,283.13.
