Voters to decide on ban
FRESNO — If voters approve, Fresno will
become the second-largest city in the nation to
declare itself a "nuclear-free zone."
The electorate will decide at a municipal elec
tion March 5 whether to adopt an ordinance
making the central California city of 275,000 the
latest community to adopt that designation.
Councilman Chris Petersen, who gained coun
cil approval for the vote, explained it would ban
the private manufacture, storage and transporta
tion of nuclear weapons and their primary com
ponents within the city.
The practical effects would be to bar compan
ies whose prime business is nuclear components
and erect signs at city boundaries declaring a
nuclear-free zone.
However, the primary effect would be to send
a symbolic message against the nuclear arms
race.
The term nuclear-free zone is slightly deceiv
ing. Medical, educational, agricultural and indus
trial uses of radiation will go on as usual.
Petersen said it also would not interfere with
operations at the Air National Guard base in
Fresno because of federal supremacy.

Tom Marsella, a cit> council candidate who
opposed the measure in a recent debate at Fresno
State University, questioned the basic premise of
the ordinance and the city's enforcement powers
if it passes.
"We're totally against the measure — ab
solutely, adamantly against it — for the simple
reason that if every community made itself a
nuclear-free zone, the result would be unilateral
disarmament, which is hardly anyone's idea of
American security," he said.
The chamber of commerce executive commit
tee opposes the measure but has launched no ac
tive opposition campaign.
Berkeley offers haven
BERKELEY — The city council voted Tues
day night to give sanctuary to refugees from war
torn Central America, and the mayor called on
the federal government to "do its own job."
The resolution approved 8-1 forbids police and
other city officials from assisting immigration
agents pursuing the refugees.
Council members passed a similar resolution in
1971, during the Vietnam War. The resolution
offered sanctuary to sailors from the aircraft car
rier Coral Sea. Two sailors jumped ship.

Eleven churches in Berkeley, site of the Uni
versity of California, have already offered sanc
tuary to refugees.
The only dissenting vote came from Council
woman Barbara Lashley, the lone remaining
member of the moderate-conservative All
Berkeley Coalition. The other members belong
to the leftist Berkeley Citizens Action.
"The first sanctuary system this country ever
knew was the Underground Railroad for black
slaves," said Mayor Gus Newport, who is black.
"They were black people who lived in this
country," Lashley shot back. "Not people from
outside."
Lashley said it was "outlandish" and possibly
illegal to declare the entire city a sanctuary from
the federal government.
"Let the federal government do its own job,"
Newport said.
