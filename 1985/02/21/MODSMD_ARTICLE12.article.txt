## USW and feminism put Crouse to work 
### SHIRISH DATE Staff writer 
For much of last year, life was hec
tic for Linda Crouse. She would wake
up every morning at 6, come to work
at Stanford and spend the next'eight
hours setting up and tearing down
furniture arrangements at Tresidder
Union as a member of the Univer
sity's labor crew.
Lunch hours were spent working at
the union office, holding shop
meetings or conducting rallies. After

'On campus, any time a women's issue
came up . . . the union leaders were
right there supporting us.'

Grouse's day at Tresidder was done,
she'd spend another five to eight
hours working at the United Stanford
Workers union office before going
home, only to get up early again the
following morning.
Crouse's dedication is understand
able. For much of last year, the union
was fighting for its life, and she was its
president.
"It was a very hard job working as
full-time Stanford workers and, be
cause of the situation, working a
second job in the union office,"
Crouse said. "It was the kind of situa
tion that would either do you in or
make you stronger."
Through its tenacious nine-month
long struggle against University man
agement, USW showed that it was no
ordinary union. Further, Crouse's
leadership proved that she was no or
dinary union president.
But union activism and a spot on
Stanford's labor crew were probably
not in Crouse's mind when she en
tered college nearly 30 years ago. She
was, in fact, an anthropology and psy
chology major at UC-Berkeley from
1956 to 1959.
She had no real career goals back
then, knowing only that she'd have to
support herself upon leaving Cal. "I
knew I was going to have to earn my
own living," she said. "The courses I
took didn't really contribute to that,"
she added with a smile.
Crouse left college before earning
her bachelor's degree, opting instead
to work full time. She worked as a
cashier, waitress, store clerk and
warehouse clerk, all the while taking
computer courses to learn program
ming.
In 1967, her computer literacy
brought her to the University with a
job processing and entering informa
tion into a Stanford Medical Center

databank.
She called the Stanford of 18 years
ago "a lively place," with first the
civil-rights and then the anti-war
movements. But though she sym
pathized with both, she had found her
own cause: "The thing that was
closest to my heart was the women's
movement," she said.
Crouse attributes her feminism in
large part to her 1959 marriage that
lasted two years, saying it
"politicized" her. "I became a

women's liberationist before that
phrase was used.
"My husband pushed me around. I
don't like to use the term 'battered
wife' because that sounds passive.
When I was hit, I fought back. Unfor
tunately, I weighed three-fifths of
what my husband did."
In addition, the social climate of
the time contributed to to her
politicization.
"In those days, if your husband
pushed you around in front of people
and you yelled for help, few people
would . . . interfere in a 'domestic'
dispute. Some even thought it was the
husband's 'prerogative.'
"I have never been pushed around
again. 1 think this is more because of
a change in my attitude than because
of a change in the attitude of the men
I've lived with. I have told [all of
themj that if they lift a finger against
me 1 will defend myself by whatever
means necessary."
Just as her marriage politicized her,
so did her early experiences in the job
market, which she says awakened her
to the humiliating effects of discrimi
nation.
"I cannot express how often your
intelligence and pride as a person
[were] wounded because you were a
woman. When I worked at the phone
company in San Francisco tabulating
checks, 1 was soon told that at most I
could expect to become a 'service
representative.' The younger delivery
boy, however, could expect to be
promoted over me and eventually
become my boss.
"When I complained, one of the
managers assured me there was no
discrimination and drove me across
town to meet the only woman
manager, who also assured me there
was no discrimination. I said that I
was not stupid, and quit.

"As I continued to encounter this
kind of discrimination over the years,
my anger increased. Women had no
access to positions of power or posi
tions of respect or even positions of
real challenge. People laughed at the
idea of women astronauts and presi
dents. Worse, they laughed in your
face because even your pride as a
woman was supposed to be non
existent."
Crouse's frustrations turned to ac
tion when she came to Stanford and
joined with medical center co
workers to organize one of the first
women's "consciousness-raising''
groups on campus.
"For the first time we had words
like 'chauvinism' and 'sexism' to
describe what was happening to us. It
was an emotional time; many
meetings ended up with us crying, as
for the first time we shared a rage that
had been pent up for many years."
The support group led to the first
National Organization for Women
chapter at Stanford in 1970; the ini
tial members: Crouse, her boyfriend
and two female colleagues from the
med center. It was with NOW that
Crouse had her first contact with
Stanford union activists.
"On campus, any time a women's
issue came up, such as abortion or
equal pay for equal work, the union
leaders were right there supporting
us. Very quickly, I became active in
the union."
To be more precise, Crouse
became active in union organizing, as
there was no certified union at Stan
ford at the time. She describes the
strategy she and other organizers
used as building a union "from the
ground up."
Most unions are organized by a
large union sending professional or
ganizers to gather membership
pledges from workers and then sub
mitting a proposal to the National

'My husband pushed me around. I
don't like to use the term "battered
wife" because that sounds passive.
When I was hit, I fought back.'

Labor Relations Board to hold an or
ganizing election: a process Crouse
calls "top down."
At Stanford, Crouse and a handful
of activists relied on several tactics to
establish United Stanford
Employees, the original name of

USW. Some of the more effective
strategies included representing their
fellow employees in grievance
hearings and helping them file com
plaints with the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission.
The organizers were rewarded in
1974 when a USE negotiating team
— of which Crouse was the only
female member — brought Stan
ford's technical, maintenance and
service workers their first University
and NLRB-recognized union con
tract.
Crouse's life took a new turn in
1980, when a part of the med center
clinic she worked in was closed.
Along with other clinic employees,
Crouse was laid off. It was then she
/decided she didn't want to work be
hind a desk ever again.
"After 20 years of working mostly
in an office, I just had to get out.
Being in an office had become like
being in a prison. I told (Stanford)
Employee Relations that I would like
a job on an outdoors crew."
After brief stints on the gardening
and labor crews, she wound up as a
laborer on the maintenance crew at
Tresidder. She says she likes what she
does now so much that she turned
down an offer to be a
"miscellaneous" technician in an
other department.
"People think it (manual labor) is
dumb work, but it isn't. In order to
make up for size, you have to think
things out, using leverage and your
balance. . . . Plus while working on
the labor crew, I can think about
books, about the union, about
newspapers I've read . . . not like
while sitting and adding up numbers
all day.
"I love physical work and wouldn't
go back into an office for all the
money in the world. As long as I earn
enough to survive decently and to
keep me in jeans and shirts, I'm
satisfied."

Manual laborer and union presi
dent may seem an odd mix, but at
USW, the combination is com
monplace. While most unions hire
professional officers, USW's leader
ship consists solely of full-time
bargaining-unit members.

"That's how we designed the
union," Crouse explains. "Several
times in our history there have been
attempts to take away leadership
from the membership; we've stopped
that each time.
"As long as the union is in the
hands of the rank and file — the
entire rank and file, not just certain
members of it — then the union will
be an effective force on behalf of its
members. The running of unions top
down, by highly paid professional
staff or by perpetually elected presi
dents, has been a disaster to the labor
movement."
Crouse's term as USW president
ended in January. She then ran for
and won the chief stewardship, a job
as important as the union presidency
in enforcing the union contract.
She says the woman leadership —
three presidents and two chief
stewards in 11 years — has had a ben
eficial impact on male-female rela
tions in the union.

"It is clear to me that the active
role women have played in USW has
changed the attitudes of union mem
bers, whether the members are con
scious of this change or not. I can see
the contrast when I deal with union
members from unions that have few
women and fewer women leaders."
Crouse has fought long and hard
for both women's and workers' rights
at Stanford. She sees improvements
in both, but also sees much room for
change.
"In the past 20 years, it has been a
joy to see the changes in attitudes
toward women. I cannot express how
much better it is than it was 25 years
ago when I began working. Although
it has improved, we have a very long
way to go. There is still a tremendous
wage gap. The pop culture of this
country — TV, movies and magazines
— [is] still one big insult to women."
But even in the face of this, Crouse
remains undaunted.
"There is a lot of work to do."
