With the release of the information that the Phi
Psi co-op is facing a debt of more than $10,000,
questions have been raised about autonomous
financial management in University housing.
This year's Phi Psi residents shouldn't have to
pay for debts created in years past. In all housing
arrangements except fraternities, residents have
no allegiance to the organization of the house and
should not be held responsible for past mis
management.
The Phi Psi debt is a result of previous resi
dents not paying room-and-board bills and of
questionable loans and dealings by past house
managers.
The rights of the residents of a house to spend
money in ways they see fit is important and must
be preserved, but action needs to by taken to
ensure that a situation like that at Phi Psi does not
happen again.
As a first step, the University should develop a
framework to educate financial managers on
simple bookkeeping skills. A brief but mandatory
course could be arranged by Residential Educa
tion and could include basic instruction on all
aspects of financial management for the houses.

There should also be a mechanism by which
financial records are checked periodically.
Reportedly, very few members of Phi Psi knew of
the financial situation until recently. Virtually no
one knew that a previous financial manager had
"borrowed" and "lent" large sums of money for
what he describes as "personal reasons."
Houses such as Phi Psi deal with more than
$100,000 each year. To entrust the management
and collection of so much money to a student with
little financial background and supervision
demonstrates dubious responsibility on the part
of other house members and the housing system.
House records should be reviewed a few times
each year for errors, oversights and questionable
uses of funds. The purpose would not be to ques
tion expenditures, but to ensure all funds are ac
counted for and to catch problems while those in
volved are still at Stanford.
To control those who don't pay, room-and
board charges should be placed on the Permit to
Register to ensure payment. In this way, houses
could both receive and control the funds they
need.
