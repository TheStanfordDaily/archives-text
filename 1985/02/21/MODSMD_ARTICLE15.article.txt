# A
						real-world primer for the Farm
## 
### 
Many of you, no doubt, are curious as to what
the "Real World" is like. I'm often asked, "What's
it like?" or, "Is it true that nothing we learn here is
relevant?" or more to the point, "Why are you
back?" Most students seem to picture the real
world in terms of one-third contingency fees or
record numbers of gall bladders operated upon or
other such mixed-up notions. It's evident that most
Stanford students, especially the grad students,
haven't the vaguest idea of what life on the outside,
off the Farm in the quaint local parlance, is like.
I'm glad you asked. Imagine the best professor
you've ever had. Recall the most interesting class
you've ever taken. Now pretend that your favorite
professor is giving that interesting class at 8 in the
morning Monday through Friday all year round
with a two-week break in late August; the real
world is much worse than that. Hold on now, slow
down, don't go running for the graduate school ap
plications before you hear the entire story.
You'll be surprised to learn that besides the su
perb academic training you've received at Stanford,
you're actually much better prepared for the real
world than the average recent graduate. For in
stance, the registration procedure at Stanford has
more than prepared you for the mysteries of the
IRS's 1040 Long Form and LOTS is actually quite
compatible with the average Bolivian computer
facility. With only a few tips from an old hand, such
as myself, I'm sure that you will more than just
survive in the real world; you will triumph.
A few words about the office. Now the average
professor doesn't care what you look like. So if you
happened to spend the night on the floor because
the bed looked like it was just too damn high, and
you wake up at quarter to 10 and run to class in
your, by now, crusty party togs (Bermuda shorts
and a Berkeley sweatshirt), that's swell. This will
not fly at the office. Some corporation is going to
be paying you big, by their standards, bucks and
they're going to expect corporate image. That
means suit and tie, polished shoes, fresh shave (if
appropriate), American flag lapel pin and that hard
"Buster I mean Business" look in your eye.
Beta amphetamines help, but they're no substi
tute for being related to the chairman of the board.
So if you're going to be at work by 8, the last 9-to-5
job having been eliminated in 1973, figure on get
ting up at 6, 256 mornings a year. Of course there
are short cuts; sleeping in your best suit, however,
is not one of them.
The first thing that goes is breakfast. Let's be
serious: Would you rather spend 30 minutes mes
sing up dishes that will eventually have to be
thrown out, or sleeping? Sleep, regardless of what

ungodly hour you set the alarm clock, wins every
time. This is not to say that you'll ever go hungry,
heavens no. After only a few months you'll have
the office coffee cart's schedule down to the mil
lisecond. Not only will the deep-fat-fried sugar
toroids that you will soon become addicted to

satisfy your hunger (for about 30 minutes anyway),
they will provide you with an excuse to not be
doing your job. After about a week, any excuse is a
good excuse.
The second thing to go is shaving. You will enjoy
having a nice neat beard to strain your meals
through, and more important you'll save five
minutes every morning. You may have good inten
tions, but eventually you'll tire of having people
snicker at the bloody toilet paper (ever shaved
before daybreak?) gruesomely plastered all over
your face.
The third thing that goes is your suburban apart
ment, the one with the grass and the trees and the
parking space right outside the door. After a month
in which you've seen the dawn around 20 times,
you'll do anything to avoid commuting. That in
cludes living in a studio apartment downtown in a
building you will share with six students with whom
you'll have nothing in common; a retired couple,
who evidently despise each other even more than
they despise you; a wino who sleeps in the back
hall; a nurse or three who work the night shift; and
22,000 cockroaches. Hey, who knows, you may en
joy yuppiehood.
The last thing that'll have to be jettisoned is your
social life. Nobody else at the office will have one,
and it'll just piss them off if you manage to keep
yours. You might as well say good-bye to David
Letterman while you're at it.
A few words about nutrition. Because your typical
breakfast will be cake (a Danish by any other
name, etc., etc.) and black coffee, and your typical
lunch will be a sub and a beer, dinner will become
all-important in your nutritional scheme. Luckily,
due to the progressive nature of the U.S. tax code,

there exists a plethora of fine restaurants for you to
frequent. By simply varying the restaurants you eat
in, you will be able to maintain a diet that is com
plete in all of the major food groups and most of
the industrial chemicals your body's become ac
customed to here at Stanford.
A few words about exercise. One morning as
you're noisily masticating your sugar toroids and
slurping your coffee, while your office mate ex
plains how the movie ended, a thought will spring
unbidden. It will suddenly occur to you that every
man in the office more than 35 years old has sag
ging pectorals and a pot belly. It may first occur to
you that the only women over 35 who've kept their
figures claim that they haven't eaten breakfast or
lunch in 12 years. Regardless of which thought oc
curs to you first, your sugar toroid will suddenly
lose its imitation flavor and exercise will become a
big part of your life. Unfortunately, by the time
you've gotten home, exercised, read the letters
from various banks who've suddenly taken a keen
interest in your financial future, and eaten some
Chinese takeout, it's too late to go out and you end
up asleep in your easy chair.
A few words about budgeting. After a few
months of racing to the bank to deposit your pay
check before the rent check bounces, the need for a
household budget becomes self-evident. I suggest
you use the following as a guide: 40 percent payroll
deduction?, 25 percent rent, 15 percent car/car in
surance and 20 percent for restaurant bills. Any
other miscellaneous expenses, clothes, furniture,
student-loan repayments and the like will just have
to come out of your savings. Sooner or later the
company will realize how valuable you are and give
you a big raise. Generally companies evaluate new
employee performance after a year or so, but until
then that money you socked away while you were
at Stanford is going to come in real handy.
A few final words about your future. You will
learn new survival skills on the outside. You'll
amaze yourself with the quantity of beer that you
can drink during a 45-minute lunch break. You'll
acquire an uncanny eye for colleagues who slink in
wearing the same outfit they had on the day before.
You'll become frugal, avoiding bars that don't
supply free munchies during happy hour. You'll
become worldly; it won't surprise you to learn that
organized crime controls the dry cleaning industry.
But most important of all, you'll pay taxes, boy will
you pay taxes, to the government that's subsidizing
my continuing education. Thank you and good
luck.
