Peace, not marriage
Bunzel and Nosanchuck's rebuttal
(The Daily, Feb. 13) of John
Rosenblum's viewpoint (The Daily,
Feb. 6) sadly failed to address the
main point in Rosenblum's article.
Rosenblum had mainly argued that
no peaceful resolution of the Israeli-
Palestinian problem could be
achieved unless the rights of both
peoples — including the right of the
Palestinians to self-determination —
were respected. He showed in his
article that Israeli policies under Col.
Menechim Milson did not reflect any
respect for this principle.
Instead of addressing this issue,
Bunzel and Nosanchuck dismissed
the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion, the representative of the Pales
tinian people, as a "terrorist" organi
zation that uses intimidation to
master its support among the Pales
tinians. A Time magazine (Sept.24
1982) poll showed that 86 percent of
the West Bank Palestinians aspire
for an independent Palestinian state
run by the PLO; this poll was carried
out by an Israeli agency. If anything,
this points to the fact that the
legitimacy of the PLO is derived
from the mainstream of the Palestin
ian people, and not from "extremists
refusing any conciliation." The sys
tematic Israeli efforts to create an
alternative Palestinian people and
efforts to create an alternative Pales
tinian leadership on the West Bank
have proved to be an utter failure;
the Village League appointees of the
Israeli occupation have no trace of
support among the Palestinian
people.
It is sad to see a viewpoint by a
courageous Israeli calling for a just
solution of the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict based on respect for the
rights of both peoples elicit reactions
involving name-calling and mis
representation of truth. As Pales
tinians who share Rosenblum's

search for justice and peace, we were
hoping for a more serious and ra
tional discussion that would address
the issue of coexistence. We certainly
do not like Col. Milson's practices,
or for that matter the repression of
all Israeli occupation administra
tions. It is also not possible to forget
the terrorist past of many Israeli
leaders and the Israeli state
sponsored terrorism. But the Pales
tinians and the PLO have come to
realize the need to negotiate with the
chosen representatives of Israel.
When will Israel and its supporters
come to realize the need to negotiate
with the PLO? What we are discus
sing, and in our opinion Rosenblum
was discussing, is peace between
enemies and not marriage relation
ships. It is with your enemies that
you need to make peace with, not
your friends.

Boomerang challenge
With due respect to Stanford
University engineer Alan Adler, I
dispute his claim that his ring-shaped
plastic invention called the Aerobie
is the longest-flying thrown object in
the world.
Boomerang wizard Peter Ruhf can
throw a boomerang 125 yards (114
meters) out and return for a flying
distance of 250 yards plus arc
turning radius of approximately 20
yards for a total flying distance of
270 yards.
Rufh can also throw a plywood
boomerang for flying loft time of 105
seconds and catch it upon return.
Would Prof. Adler care to chal
lenge either of these two already
established and witnessed records?
