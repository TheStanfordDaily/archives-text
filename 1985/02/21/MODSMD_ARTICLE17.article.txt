## Give the poor guns, not just food stamps 
### 
And they say academics are all talk and no ac
tion. Everyone these days seems to be talking
about Bernhard Goetz, the "subway vigilante."
Apparently fearing a robbery attempt, Goetz shot
four young people in New York City and
skyrocketed into national attention. The topic
lends itself well to endless debate as it involves
many deeply cherished institutions, such as the rule
of law, the right to self-defense and the Charles
Bronson movie. Recently in these pages, though, a
graduate student in political science finally
translated all this idle chatter into a definite pro
posal for legislative action (Bill Evers' column. The

VIEWPOINT

Daily, Feb. 11). Bravo!
What the Goetz incident really indicates, he tells
us. is the need for repealing gun laws. You see, "If
you believe that people have a right to self-defense,
then it is reasonable to conclude that people have a
right to carry handguns and other appropriate self
defense technology." Unfortunately, he does not
elaborate on the nature of the "other appropriate
self-defense technology" (perhaps he has President
Reagan's "Star Wars" plan in mind), but in any
case his call for an end to handgun control
represents the most ingenious proposal I know of
for implementing the lessons of the "subway
vigilante" episode.
Strange as it may seem, some people fail to un
derstand this conclusion. These are the "Volvo
Class" — undoubtedly just new. fuel-efficient ver
sions of the old Limousine Liberals. They live in
safe neighborhoods and observe the real world of
crime only through the closed windows of their ex
pensive cars. Not only do the Volvo Class betray
their union allies by refusing to buy American, but
they also insist on letting only the police deal with
crime. Typically, they put their confidence in Big
Government instead of individual initiative.
What we need, Evers argues, is to get govern
ment off the backs of the American people, who

just want to exercise their constitutional right to
bear arms. After all, freedom is not guaranteed by
dusty law books and lawmakers in Washington, but
by a revolver in the belt of each and every Ameri
can.
There are some Nervous Nellies who believe that
gun control reduces violent crimes. Hogwash! As
Evers points out, "Handgun-banning states have
the same or higher levels of violent crime than
states that allow handguns — even though the
states that ban handguns are demographically less
crime-prone." I can vouch for this, since I come
from New York, which has tight gun restrictions
and much crime. I did not know that New York was
"demographically less crime-prone." I assume this
is because of its balance of the very rich and the
very poor. But the conclusion is clear. The real way
to fight crime is to let the people have guns and
fight it themselves. If it was good enough for John
Wayne, it's good enough for us.
Evers even provides that interesting historical
note that liberals pushed gun control laws after the
failure of their first experiment in fighting crime —
Prohibition. Liberal leaders have certainly realized
the folly of the latter and must now recognize the
failure of the former. You're not in favor of return
ing to prohibition, are you Tip?
But here the writer's argument runs into a snag.
There are people who cannot afford to buy even a
cheap .22 caliber pistol, what I like to call the
"Second Amendment Special." Does the constitu
tion of the United States apply only to the rich?
Does lack of wealth disqualify someone from the
full protection of the Bill of Rights? Of course not.
I would, therefore, like to offer a modest addi
tion to Evers' remarkable proposal. It is time to
turn the gun control law on its head. Specifically,
we should cut some more fat from the fraud-ridden
food stamp program and channel the funds into a
broader "Safety Stamp" (SS) program. Through
the SS, needy families could get government assis
tance to buy food or firearms.
The mechanics of the SS would be very simple.

Through the existing food stamp framework, indi
gent Americans would receive coupons that could
be used to purchase groceries or handguns. This
plan seems to accord well with the president's goal
of assuring a "safety net." How could people really
enjoy their government-assisted nourishment, if
they have to walk down the street without a
weapon? As the saying goes, man does not live by
bread alone. We could finally overcome that old di
lemma of economics by providing both guns and
butter.
Unlike the current food stamp program, safety
stamps would not be a fiscal black hole. The gov
ernment gives food aid one month, and the next
month it has to give it again. People just keep on
needing food. Like diamonds, though, firearms are
forever.
The ownership of a gun might also enable a job
less person to try a new line of work. Armed people
clearly have more options for getting off the
welfare rolls. The SS would thus honor the impor
tant principle of helping people to help themselves.
It is better to give people fishing rods than to give
them fish. How much better still it would be to give
them Colt .45 Peacemakers. Instead of demanding
"hand-outs," they could demand "hands-up."
Think of the boon to American industry. A solid
gun-buying craze could create thousands of jobs for
firearms manufacturers, not to mention related
fields, such as ammunition companies, bullet-proof
vest producers, handgun summer camps for
teenagers — the list is endless.
Under normal circumstances, I would have little
hope for the adoption of my Safety Stamp program.
But these are not ordinary times. In his state of the
union address, the president hearkened back to the
theme of America as an "arsenal of democracy."
What better way of bringing this goal to realization
than by guaranteeing to each and every citizen of
this fair land that greatest of American dreams, the
dream of handgun ownership.
