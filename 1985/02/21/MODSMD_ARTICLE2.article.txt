# Changes planned at post office
## 
### DAVID RISSER Senior staff writer 
In an effort to solve the perennial
problem of post office box demand,
the University has expanded its
dialogue with the Stanford branch
of the U.S. Postal Service.
Council of Presidents member
Melissa Auchard met with Univer
sity and postal officials last week to
address everything from the long
term goal of resolving the post of
fice box problem to the immediate
goal of improving the capacity and
accessibility of stamp-vending
machines.
Three hundred freshmen were
unable to claim post office boxes
when they arrived here this year,
and according to Jean Kruse, direc
tor of Mail Services for the Univer
sity, "It is an issue the University
wants to resolve."
While the Stanford post office
boasts more boxes than most sta
tions in the Bay Area and provides
24-hour access to them, postal offi
cials estimate that only half are held
by students.
"A lot of outsiders possess
boxes," said Ray Chun, manager of
the Stanford branch. He estimates
that 30 percent of Stanford's ap
proximately 7,000 boxes are held by
local businesses, many desiring the
prestige of a Stanford address.
Demand problems increase when
students graduate and continue to
keep their boxes while current un
dergraduates who are able to have
their mail delivered to a street ad
dress keep a box for convenience.
Summer session students use
their boxes for 90 days and then
leave, tying up boxes for an addi

tional three months, according to
Chun. The six-month minimum
rental period on post office boxes is
a national policy.
"I wonder if people holding on to
boxes realize that other people can't
have them," Auchard said.
'T recommend that those who
have no use for boxes release them
to individuals who have an actual
need for them," Chun said." We are
trying to serve students but we can
not discriminate."
He plans to notify all box holders
of the demand problem in an effort
to serve those most in need.
"There is no way to stop (the
problem) short of getting the Uni
versity to handle it," according to

Gene Conroy, a postal clerk here
since 1967. "It will get worse and
worse. We have a bottleneck here
and the University wants no part of
it."
At most universities, an off
campus post office delivers mail to
each residence, where it is dis
tributed to boxes by
hired sorters.
"The University doesn't want to
take that responsibility," Chun said.
If the University would provide the
necessary staff and comply with
postal service regulations, Chun
said he thinks such a system could
be successfully instituted here.
"It would work provided the Uni
versity would show a commitment

to maintain it. I have been asking
them to do it,"he said.
''We are looking at all the alter
natives; there aren't any solutions at
the moment," Kruse said.
One proposal to alleviate the
familiar long lines at the post office
is a s>elf-service station that would
Include rate charts and scales for
weighing packages. A self-service
station to be placed near Wilbur
Hall was suggested a few years ago,
but was never realized.
Another potential solution that
has been experimented with here is
an express line for the many cus

The ASSU helped alleviate the long lines at the post office Tuesday by selling stamps. This won't continue,
but other practices are planned to improve the branch's efficiency.
