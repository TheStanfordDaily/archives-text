# Changes planned at post office
## 
### DAVID RISSER Senior staff writer 
In an effort to solve the perennial
problem of post office box demand,
the University has expanded its
dialogue with the Stanford branch
of the U.S. Postal Service.
Council of Presidents member
Melissa Auchard met with Univer
sity and postal officials last week to
address everything from the long
term goal of resolving the post of
fice box problem to the immediate
goal of improving the capacity and
accessibility of stamp-vending
machines.
Three hundred freshmen were
unable to claim post office boxes
when they arrived here this year,
and according to Jean Kruse, direc
tor of Mail Services for the Univer
sity, "It is an issue the University
wants to resolve."
While the Stanford post office
boasts more boxes than most sta
tions in the Bay Area and provides
24-hour access to them, postal offi
cials estimate that only half are held
by students.
"A lot of outsiders possess
boxes," said Ray Chun, manager of
the Stanford branch. He estimates
that 30 percent of Stanford's ap
proximately 7,000 boxes are held by
local businesses, many desiring the
prestige of a Stanford address.
Demand problems increase when
students graduate and continue to
keep their boxes while current un
dergraduates who are able to have
their mail delivered to a street ad
dress keep a box for convenience.
Summer session students use
their boxes for 90 days and then
leave, tying up boxes for an addi

tional three months, according to
Chun. The six-month minimum
rental period on post office boxes is
a national policy.
"I wonder if people holding on to
boxes realize that other people can't
have them," Auchard said.
'T recommend that those who
have no use for boxes release them
to individuals who have an actual
need for them," Chun said." We are
trying to serve students but we can
not discriminate."
He plans to notify all box holders
of the demand problem in an effort
to serve those most in need.
"There is no way to stop (the
problem) short of getting the Uni
versity to handle it," according to

Gene Conroy, a postal clerk here
since 1967. "It will get worse and
worse. We have a bottleneck here
and the University wants no part of
it."
At most universities, an off
campus post office delivers mail to
each residence, where it is dis
tributed to boxes by
hired sorters.
"The University doesn't want to
take that responsibility," Chun said.
If the University would provide the
necessary staff and comply with
postal service regulations, Chun
said he thinks such a system could
be successfully instituted here.
"It would work provided the Uni
versity would show a commitment

to maintain it. I have been asking
them to do it,"he said.
''We are looking at all the alter
natives; there aren't any solutions at
the moment," Kruse said.
One proposal to alleviate the
familiar long lines at the post office
is a s>elf-service station that would
Include rate charts and scales for
weighing packages. A self-service
station to be placed near Wilbur
Hall was suggested a few years ago,
but was never realized.
Another potential solution that
has been experimented with here is
an express line for the many cus

tomers waiting to pick up packages.
Forty percent of those in line are
waiting to pick up parcels, according
to Chun.
"The express line is a good idea,
but not too beneficial," he said. "You
have to sacrifice on one end to serve
the other. It's a no-win situation."
The most frequent complaint
lodged against the post office is the
lack of clerks working at any one
time.
"People don't realize we can't arbi
trarily put a person on window
(service)," Chun said. Postal clerks
working the window must undergo
120 hours of training, then pass an
exam.
"There is a misperception that the
work is easy. Few realize that the
worker is financially accountable for
any stamp losses," Chun said.
Chun said he will attempt to

moderate the problem by restructur
ing the lunch-hour schedules and
training more employees for the win
dow work. Eleven people operate the
station, with eight trained to work
windows. Three of the eight are sup
port personnel who must sort mail
into boxes and prepare the 3,324
daily deliveries; most employees have
Sunday and one other day off.
He said he would like to have four
employees working the windows at all
times.
Kruse will meet with University of
ficials in a few weeks to discuss the
post office box problem, and Chun
plans to see his Palo Alto supervisor
next week to present his recommen
dations for the Stanford station.
"On a positive note, we are talking
and Stanford University is starting to
listen to us. We may be able to
resolve problems. Hopefully the Uni
versity will cooperate and assist,"
Chun said. "All will eventually bene
fit, it's just a matter of time."
