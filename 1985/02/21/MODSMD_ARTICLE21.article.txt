## Miller's 36 lifts USC to 80-68 win 
### JOHN LIS Editorial staff 
The USC women's basketball show
starring Cheryl Miller rolled into
Maples Pavilion last night, but didn't
quite roll over Stanford. Miller
played an outstanding game, but the
supporting cast didn't turn in quite as
good a performance and the Trojans
left with an KO-68 victory before the

largest home crowd of the season.
Things aren't like they were last
year, when the Trojans blew out the
Cardinal 86-44. Sure. Miller had her
36 points and 22 rebounds, but gone
were Cynthia Cooper, Pam McGee
and Paula McGee from a team that
had won back-to-back NCAA cham
pionships.
"We rebounded better than we

ever have against them," Stanford
forward Mary Bradach said. "There's
a big difference without the two
McGees in there.
"Last year, she (Miller) took more
outside shots. This year they have to
keep her close to the basket."
Cardinal Coach Dotty McCrea
agreed. "Their front line wasn't as ef
fective." she said.

USC only outrebounded Stanford
by a 40-39 margin despite Miller's 22
boards and a height advantage on the
Cardinal. Bradach had eight
rebounds and center Karen
Goedewaagen had seven to lead
Stanford.
"1 thought the competition inside
was pretty even without Cheryl,"
Goedewaagen said. "Cheryl was the
difference."
"During one of our timeouts, coach
let us have it because they were get
ting the boards on us," Bradach said.
"For the rest of the second half, we
rebounded well."
Stanford also had a new look this
year. Two starters — forward Kami
Anderson and guard Charli Turner —
were in high school last year when the
Trojans were compiling a 29-4 record
before defeating Tennessee in the
NCAA final.
Turner hit 5-of-6 shots for 10
points in the first half, and the Card
inal trailed 30-40 at the intermission.
Anderson finished with 17 points to
lead Stanford along with guard Vir
ginia Sourlis.
Stanford is now 2-7 in the Western
Collegiate Athletic Association, 9-14
overall. USC is 6-2 in the WC'AA,
16-6 overall.
For. a while in the first half, it ap
peared Stanford might make the
impossible a reality. After 13
minutes, Stanford led 22-20. Then
Miller took charge, scoring 11 points
as USC ran off a 20-8 burst to close
the half.
With 10 minutes left in the game,
the Trojans seemed in control,
leading 65-48. The Cardinal fought
back and, when Miller came out of
the game after picking up her fourth
foul with 8:44 remaining, seemed to
have a chance to close things.
Stanford pulled back to 66-56 as
USC went almost six minutes without
a field goal. The Cardinal had gone to
a man-to-man defense that seemed to
take the Trojans out of their game.
"It was all or nothing," Sourlis
said. "To come back we knew we'd
have to go all out. We boxed out well,
which gave us momentum — then
Cheryl went to work."
Miller broke the Trojans' slump
with .a left-hand layup at the 4:25
mark. Stanford pulled it to 70-62
with 2:21 left when Sourlis hit a 17-
foot baseline jumper, but then Miller
took the ball in the backcourt,
dribbled through the Stanford
defense, drove for the basket, and
drew a foul on Bradach, her fifth.
Miller made the foul shot, and the
only question that remained was by
how many the Trojans would win.
"That's the closest we've come to

beating them since I've been here,"
said Bradach, the Cardinal's only
senior. "That's still not much con
solation. We'd like to win it."
The Trojans are no longer the
cream of women's basketball, as they
had been since Miller came out of
high school three years ago and led
them to consecutive national titles.
They're currently ranked No. 12.
Freshman center Holly Ford, one
of the nation's top high schoolers last
year, scored 15 points. Guard
Rhonda Windham, who scored 12,
was the only other Trojan in double
figures.
Stanford was paced by Anderson
and Sourlis, with 17 each, and
Turner, who finished with 12.

Bradach and center Kim Mercer had
10 points each.
The Stanford players weren't down
despite losing. "To stay this close
with the No. 12 team in the country,
we did well," Goedewaagen said.
"We played with a lot of intensity,"
McCrea said. "We played well to
gether, which helps."
"If we play this well against UCLA
or Fullerton (State), we could pull out
a win or two," Bradach said. "We
have to keep up playing as well as
tonight."
The Cardinal will get a chance to
find out Saturday, when the team
travels to Fullerton for a game with the
Titans. Fullerton won the first
meeting here 66-51.
