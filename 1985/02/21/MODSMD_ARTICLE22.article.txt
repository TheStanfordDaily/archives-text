There are certain special athletes
who possess the uncanny ability to
generate a great deal of public in
terest in their sport. Such talents
are often labeled "impact players."
Cheryl Miller is an impact player,
though you might be hard pressed
to get her to admit it.

"I don't see myself as the main
catalyst in raising interest for
women's basketball," she said.
"One person cannot move the sport
by herself."
Maybe not. But Miller comes aw
fully close.
After watching her glide to the
basket, bury outside jumpers, sky

Bradach replied, "It's nice to play
in front of so many, but we know
they came to see Cheryl play."
Her impact on the usual Cardinal
home-game attendance was ob

sport extends beyond the spectator
realm. Miller believes she has
helped push women's basketball to
higher physical levels.
"I've shown that women can
leap, that we can touch the rim,"
she said. "Hopefully my example
will inspire others."
Her example has inspired others,
and her physical talent has left
Stanford Asst. Coach Mike Kehoe
in awe.
"Miller has all the tools," Kehoe
said. "She's heady. She's tall and
she has springs on her feet. At
times it seemed as though we had
her contained, but she would take
that first step and be gone. She's a
quick cat."
Miller is very concerned with the
status of women's basketball in
America. As it did for many un
recognized sports, the Olympics
had a profound effect on the

in addition to scoring 36 points against Stanford last night. Widely
regarded as the best women's basketball player in the country, Mil
