## Women's tennis vs. Cal Card wins Big Match 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
The wind that rocked Stanford yes
terday morning didn't really affect
the Cardinal women's tennis match
against California. But darkness did.
The second and third doubles
matches were halted due to darkness
at 6:15 p.m., four-and-a-half hours
after the match began.
No matter, though. The No. 1-
ranked Cardinal had long since
clinched the match and was ahead 7-
0 when the coaches decided dusk had
turned to dark. So it goes in the
record books as a 7-0 victory for the
defending NCAA champs, which im
proved their record to 6-0 this season
and 32-0 including last season.
The match was supposed to be
Stanford's first test of the season â€”

Cal was ranked eighth in the nation
and had defeated third-ranked San
Diego State, 6-3. Even with freshman
Anna Ivan, rated sixth nationally in
the preseason rankings, out of the
lineup, the Big Match was nothing
more than a big blow-out.
"I didn't get a piece of the pie,"
said Cardinal Coach Frank Brennan,
who is 11-0 against Cal. "I got the
whole pie today. Usually, you come
away disappointed with one or two
(individual) matches. Today, I was
pleased with all of them."
Stanford swept the six singles
matches and then won No. 1 doubles
before darkness mercifully put Cal
out of its misery. At the time, the
Cardinal led, 7-6, 4-2, at No. 2
doubles and had split the first two
sets, 2-6, 6-2, at No. 3.

Cardinal netters cruised in four of
the six singles matches, as only Leigh
Anne Eldredge at No. 3 and Alyce
Werdel at No. 6 struggled. Eldredge
lost the first set to Linda Oechsle in a
tiebreaker, but then recovered to win
the second and third sets easily, 6-2
and 6-1.
"Leigh Anne had a tough match,"
Brennan said. "She had a very shaky
start and then came back. She and
Oechsle have had a (competitive)
thing going since (they played)
juniors, so there was a little tension
out there."
Eldredge's match, which was more
than three hours long, was nothing
compared to Werdel's. Had Werdel
not pulled away in the third set to win
7-5, 4-6, 6-3, she and Cal's Ellie
Compton might still be playing. As it
was, the match lasted four hours.
"Alyce Werdel's match was really
great," Brennan said. "She just hung
on and wouldn't let go. She was really
competitive out there and I was
pleased with that."
Other than Werdel's and
Eldredge's matches, Cal netters won
a total of nine games in the other four
singles matches. Linda Gates was her
usual awesome self at No. 1, whip
ping Jennifer Prah, 6-0, 6-1, while
Patty Fendick blanked Heather Ettus
at No. 2, 6-0, 6-0. Stephanie Savides
routed Colette Kavanagh at No. 4 by
the same score (6-4, 6-0) that her
sister, Stacy, lost to Cardinal fresh
man Kay Tittle at No. 5.
"I think the team was really up for
the match and played really well,"
Gates said. "But I think our level of
intensity could even be greater. Since
it was our first tough match, I think
people were a little nervous because
they didn't know what to expect."
The Cardinal plays the seventh of
eight straight home matches Saturday
at 10 a.m. against UC-Santa Barbara,
a team Brennan says is in the "top 25
in the nation." Stanford closes out the
home stand Monday at 1:30 p.m.
against lOth-ranked Pepperdine.
Then the Cardinal hits the road, as
eight of the next ten matches are
away from home. That includes
matches at No. 3-ranked San Diego
State March 3, No. 2-ranked USC
March 27 and No. 7-ranked UCLA
March 28.
