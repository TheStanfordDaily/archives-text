# Low finish for gymnasts
## 
### CAROLYN TARKINGTON Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford men's gymnastics
team did not log in its best effort
last night as it finished nearly three
points below the past two meet
team totals. The Cardinal scored
274.80 points for a fifth-place
finish in the Fullerton State Invita
tional.
Before leaving for the competi
tion, Coach Sadao Hamada said
that it would be significant for the
Cardinal to beat any of the five
other teams in the invitational. All
the competing teams except the
host Titans were ranked higher
than Stanford. The Cardinal
managed to place fifth out of the six
teams, scoring 1.15 points ahead of
last-place Illinois.
In the final team standings,
fourth-ranked Nebraska placed
first with 279.75 points, Fullerton
took second with 277.90, fifth
ranked New Mexico placed third
with a 277.45, Minnesota was
fourth with 275.80, Stanford
finished fifth with 274.80, and Illi
nois finished sixth with 273.65.
The final results were not in
dicative of the Cardinal men's po
tential as a team. In the past two
competitions Stanford totaled
277.65 and 277.60 total team
points. Had it scored a similar total
at Fullerton, the Cardinal would
have finished third. With two away
meets and only one home meet left
to count toward NCAA qualifica
tion, the Cardinal cannot afford to
score lower than 275.00 points.
All-arounders Jon Levy and

Randy Besosa turned in outstand
ing individual performances for the
Cardinal. Levy took first place on
the vault with a 9.70, and Besosa

placed first on the parallel bars with
a 9.60.
None of the Cardinal gymnasts
placed in the top six all-around.


Freshman Mike Matzek and the rest of the Stanford men's gymnas
tic team could only manage a fifth-place finish in last night's meet at
Fullerton State.
