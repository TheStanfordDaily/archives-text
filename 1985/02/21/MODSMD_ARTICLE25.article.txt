# Broer joins National Team
## 
### 
After completing her finest season of volleyball, Stan
ford's Bobbie Broer was among nine players named to the
U.S. National Women's Volleyball Team. Broer was one
of 65 players trying out for the team at the Olympic Train
ing Center in Colorado Springs, Colo, last week.
Broer, a 6-foot middle blocker from Palm Springs,
completed her senior season at Stanford by leading the
Cardinal to a second-place finish in the NCAA Cham
pionships. She was accorded numerous post-season
honors, including the Coaches' All-America team, All-
Western Collegiate Athletic Association and All-
Tournament at the NCAA Final Four.
"It hasn't really sunk in yet," Broer said. "It's an honor
to make the team, especially since I was one of the first
four selected. To have that consensus by the coaches

means a lot to me."
Also chosen in the top four by U.S. Olympic Coach
Terry Liskevych were Caren Kemner of Arizona, Cathy
Noth of Nebraska and Karolyn Kirby, a graduate of Ken
tucky.
"Bobbie has developed into one of the finest middle
blockers in the country," Stanford Co-coach Don Shaw
said. "She has a winning attitude and was a stabilizing
force for us throughout the year.
"She's still learning the game and she knows there is al
ways room for improvement. She still hasn't reached her
peak," he said.
The team, which will train in San Diego, is scheduled to
play South Korea on March 25.
