## Cardinal tries to end skid 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportwriter 
The Stanford men's basketball
team, 2-11 in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence and losers of six straight, can't
do much more to spoil its own season.
It can, however, spoil everyone else's.
Stanford already knocked USC out
of first place once when it defeated
the Trojans, 60-54, in Los Angeles
last month. The Cardinal can do it
again tonight at 7:30 in Maples
Pavilion, as USC is 16-6 overall and
back in the Pac-10 lead at 10-3.
"I think the big thing we did
against USC was the thing we didn't
do two nights before against UCLA,"
Stanford Assoc. Head Coach
Bruce Pearl said, referring to the
100-71 beating the Cardinal took at
UCLA Jan. 26. "Losing by 29 points
was embarrassing and not indicative
of this team.
"So they went out against USC to
prove that they belong, that they
could beat the top team in the
league."
The victory, perhaps the biggest
road triumph in Davis' three years at
Stanford, was also Stanford's last this
season. With six straight losses, four
of them in double figures, the Card
inal might feel like it has to prove it
self all over again.
While the Cardinal hasn't been
winning, the Trojans have. They are

5-1 since the loss to Stanford and
have regained a share of the Pac-10
lead in the process. The Trojans have
been doing most of that winning on
the road, where they are 6-0 in the
Pac-10 — including victories at
Arizona, at Oregon State and at
Washington.
USC, which starts a one-guard
lineup, has relied on its three starting
forwards for most of its scoring
punch. Senior Wayne Carlander leads
the team with an average of 15.7
points per game, while senior Ron
Holmes and sophomore Derrick
Dowell average 15.5 and 12.4,
respectively.
"One of their biggest offensive
weapons they have is just hitting the
offensive boards," Pearl said.
"They're the finest offensive
rebounding team that we'll face all
year."
One thing Stanford will have on its
side tonight that it hasn't had lately is
confidence. "I think beating a team of
USC's caliber and seeing them con
tinue to play well has to give the
players a little confidence," Pearl
said. "And now we've got them on
our home court."
Maples Pavilion has been a trouble
spot for Trojan teams in recent years.
USC has lost its last two straight,
three of its last five and six of its last
10 games at Maples.

John Paye's expression after Stanford's loss to Cal Saturday says it all
— the Cardinal has spent a very frustrating few weeks since beating
USC on Jan. 28.
