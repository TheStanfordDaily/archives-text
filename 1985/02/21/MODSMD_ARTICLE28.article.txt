# Spikers aim for Rainbows' end
## 
### ROB GRAHAM Staff sportswriter 
After this weekend's cakewalk
victories over California and
Chico State, two club teams, the
Stanford men's volleyball team
returns to serious action this after
noon against Hawaii in a match
that begins at 5 p.m. in Maples
Pavilion. The teams meet again to
morrow night at 7.
Stanford, ranked sixth nation
ally, currently stands alone in fifth
place in the California Intercol
legiate Volleyball Association
with a 3-3 record. The Cardinal
boasts a 14-4 overall record.
Hawaii, which is in the middle of
its annual West Coast tour, sports
a 0-2 CIVA mark but is still
ranked No. 7 nationally.
The Rainbows and the Cardinal
are surely aware that the top five
teams in the CIVA are tradition
ally awarded post-season tourna
ment invitations. With that in
mind, the contests this afternoon
and tommorrow assume added
significance. Stanford's position in
that fifth slot is extremely
precarious — right behind in sixth
is San Diego State at 2-3.
Both teams trail CIVA leaders
USC (5-0), Pepperdine (3-0),
UCLA (5-1) and UC-Santa Bar
bara (4-3).
Hawaii, which has lost twice this
week to four-time defending na
tional champ UCLA, comes to
Stanford still looking for a victory
to hang its hat upon. But the Rain
bows were able to extend the
Bruins to four sets Tuesday —

something the Cardinal was
unable to do two weeks ago —
eventually falling 10-15, 15-8, 15-
12, 15-10.
What's more, Hawaii can be ex
pected to turn things around. Last
year, the Rainbows ripped the
Cardinal in two four-set matches
in Honolulu.
Leading the visitors will be pre
season All-American outside hit
ter Pono Maa. Maa averaged 15.6
kills and and 2.8 blocks per game
last year. Moreover, the 6-foot-3,
205-pound junior played on the
U.S. Junior National Team last
summer.
Also returning for the Rainbows
are Bill Via, a middle blockcr who
averaged 9.9 kills and 5.4 blocks
per game a year ago. Setter John
Ribarich will lead the attack and
his credentials suggest he is more
than capable. His 386 assists
paced the Rainbows last year.
Stanford, a surprise victor last
month in the Santa Bar
bara/Michelob Light Invitational,
fields a squad which features only
one senior, Craig Lauchner,
among the regular six. But junior
Jon Root, a pre-season All-
American and the Most Valuable
Player in the Santa Barbara tour
ney, and freshman Scott Fortune,
the country's top recruit this year,
make up for that lack of experi
ence with talent.
Steady sophomore John
McDermott, Brett Monello, a
junior who is back after last year's
injury problems, and flashy Chris
Braun, an outside hitter, round
out the Stanford attack.
