# Most frosh plan graduate degrees
## 
### ERIC HEALY 
Ninety-five percent of Stanford's
current freshmen plan to obtain
degrees beyond their bachelor's, ac
cording to a recent survey here. The
figure is an all-time high for freshman
projections at Stanford.
The number of freshmen expecting
to earn a Ph.D. or Ed.D. has also in
creased to a near-record level â€” 22.2
percent of men and 33.3 percent of
women plan to seek these degrees,
according to the survey, which was
completed by freshmen during fall
quarter and compiled by the Dean of
Student Affairs office.
Ninety-six percent of thp freshman
class also named Stanford's academic
reputation as a governing influence in
their decision to matriculate, a 5 per
cent increase over 1979, the survey
said.
Approximately 64 percent said the
fact that Stanford "graduates go on to
top graduate schools" was a reason
for enrolling. A slightly larger num
ber of students, 69 percent, also cited
the improved chances of attaining

more desirable employment after
graduation.
These claims are substantiated in
part by other surveys which show that
approximately four out of five
graduating seniors are successful in
applying to business or professional
schools by spring of their senior year.
Although more than half of Stanford
seniors intend to work after receiving
their diplomas, nine out of 10 plan, at
some time, to resume their studies
and attain advanced degrees.
The freshman survey revealed that
although the largest group of frosh
(21 percent) remain undecided about
probable careers, 19 percent said
they were looking to medicine, 18
percent named engineering, 11 per
cent said they looked to business and
7 percent named law.
The statistics from Stanford are vir
tually analagous to a similar survey at
UC-Berkeley. At Cal, 91 percent of
incoming freshmen said they are
seeking advanced degrees. This fig
ure, like Stanford's, is an all-time
high.
