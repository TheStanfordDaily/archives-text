Grandmaster Flash — They Said It
Couldn't Be Done ★ ★ 1
The pure rap days of Flash and
Friends seem to be over, forsaken
for choruses, melodies and other
appallingly musical things. To a les
ser extent, the group's quest for
commercial success has led to less
social commentary in its music;
only one song addresses the issues
that pervaded earlier songs like
"The Message" and "White Lines"
— songs that made rap more than
bad movies and clothes with too
many zippers. A fair amount of
lyrical time is devoted to proclama

tions of Flash's predominance in
the rap field (not the right things to
say to rock critics), leaving little
time for the Grandmaster to furnish
proof. Most of the cuts are
mediocre dance tracks dealing with
the plain old themes of love, dan
cing and "rocking the house" —
themes that take away the only
edge Flash ever had over any other
rap group. The few satisfying songs
here are sustained by clever effects
and well-thought-out scratching; it
would have served the group better
to release worthwhile singles — as
it has in the past — rather than to

put out a "filler" album that leaves
the group no better than any of the
look-alikes.

Shriekback — Jam Science
★ ★ ★
Hey, kids! Wanna be British pop
stars? Just go out and buy a drum
machine, a cheap synth, turn them
on, chant along as you play lots of
pretty simple melodies and record
it all. Then you too can make post
gloom rap just like Shriekback
does. While this stuff is never really
great, it's not bad either — the
rather monotonous but creatively
programmed percussion and spacey
vocal styles make for interesting
mood music to dance to. (This is

more than most mood music can
accomplish.) The lyrics are prob
ably meaningless, but you sing

along anyway; the rhythms are
basic, but still effectively syn
copated enough to make your foot
tap involuntarily and even catch
your attention once in a while.
Though the sound can get tiresome
at first (or under one's undivided
attention), repeated playings make
the songs discernable from one an
other; some are even able to stand
out on their own. "Jam Science" is
never as good as Shriekback's first,
"Care" — but it should satisfy fans
until the group and its once-dance
music fade away completely.

The Alan Parsons Project —
Vulture Culture ★ ★ i
Sing along these lines to yourself:

"I am the eye in the sky, looking
at you ..."
Got it? Good. You've just
reviewed "Vulture Culture" for
yourself. In his 10 years of
songwriting, once-and-always en
gineer Alan Parsons has gone from
making classics like "I Robot" and
"Pyramid" to making shelf-music
like the above. No creative effort
whatsoever has gone into his music
(or lyrics) since "Turn of a Friendly
Card." Not that that's all bad — the
happy little pop melodies (or
should we say melody?) are catchy
enough to listen to a couple of
times. In fact, they'd be downright
pleasant if they weren't so predic

table. The project's once-art rock is
now nothing but silky smooth
regurgitate spiced with meaningless
background effects a la Pink Floyd
or Frankie for sci-fi value, and
cutesy Flashdance riffs for, well,
substance. At least the songs here
are better than those from
"Ammonia Avenue," his most
recent and all-time most forget
table. If the moderately improved
music quality is a hint that A1 is
making an effort to take his music
back to where it was in the first
place, his fans will be waiting. And
waiting.
