# 'That's Dancing!': A fun look at some great film moments
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG Editorial staff 
Francis Coppola, take note: Fred
Astaire insisted that his numbers be
shot in as few takes as possible and
that his entire figure (and that of his
partner) be visible at once. This.in
structive piece of information is
revealed in the delightful M-G-M
compilation, "That's Dancing!,"
along with respectfully edited clips
from some of the best dance numbers
in the history of movies. And though
most of the directors credited with
the films that produced the numbers
are not Vincente Minnellis and Stan
ley Donens, I can't recall a single one
that made me feel I'd been cheated
by a roving camera or a thoughtless
cut.
Not all of them are equally good, of
course. Eleanor Powell's heartiness
— that overbright smile that smacks
of too many vitamins — doesn't in
spire much enthusiasm in tliii lover of
movie musicals, nor do the virtuoso
styles of Agnes de Mil le tin
"Oklahoma!," 1955) and Jerome
Robbins (in "West Side Story,"
1961). The "Red Blues" number
from "Silk Stockings" (1957), featur
ing Qyd Charisse in Garbo's old
Ninotchka role, furnishes a reminder
of the more labored second- and
third-rank products of the Golden
Age of M-G-M musicals (roughly the
decade following the Second World
War). Though the voice-over narra
tion heralds the expensive, long-in
the-making "Invitation to the
Dance" (1957) as a major achieve
ment in dance on film, a sample from
it, which pairs Gene Kelly off with an
animated prima ballerina, turns out
to be limp and saccharine in the worst
Disney manner, and a straitjacket on
Kelly's terpsichorean talents. But it's
easy to forgive these low points —
and even the inclusion of numbers
from "Fame" and "Flashdance" —
considering how intelligently the
great majority of clips has been cho
sen. It's easy to forgive, too, the
fatuities in the narration (spoken
variously by Kelly, Sammy Davis,
Mikhail Baryshnikov, Ray Bolger
and Liza Minnelli), which tells us that
Ruby Keeler was "the screen's first
great dancing star" while we break up
watching her hoof leadenly through
the title song from "42nd Street"

(1933), and which suffers from a sur
feit of superlatives — because no
matter what it is being said, we can al
ways watch the dancers.
"That's Dancing!" contains the
requisite number of familiar numbers
from the 1930s musicals of Busby
Berkeley and Astaire and Rogers,
from "Singin' in the Rain" and"The
Band Wagon" — though, who would
complain about seeing Gene Kelly
and Donald O'Connor tapping to
"Moses" again, or Astaire's "Shine
on Your Shoes" extravaganza in the
penny arcade with the superb black
dancer Leroy Daniels, or (best of all)
Fred and Ginger in the finest of their
pas de deux, "Night and Day"? (I'd
actually forgotten the moment when,
just as the orchestra builds into the
final chorus, Fred pulls Ginger's arm
as if it were a pump handle to whirl
her into the most dramatic phase of
the dance.) Besides, much of the film
is devoted to dances less frequently
seen — "I Won't Dance" by Astaire

(from "Roberta," 1935), and Bill
"Bojangles" Robinson in an uniden
tified minstrel show bit; the astonish
ing Nicholas Brothers in a
breathtaking display of acrobatic
pyrotechnics from "Down Argentine
Way" (1940); and the dance with the
garbage can lids from the marvelous,
neglected "It's Always Fair Weather"
(1955), with Kelly, Dan Dailey and
Michael Kidd — which made me
want to see the rest of the picture
again. The biggest treat, though, is
some resurrected footage from Ray
Bolger's "If 1 Only Had a Brain"
number in "The Wizard of Oz," cut
on the film's release in 1939 for
reasons (according to the voice-over)
that no one remembers. When you
see what Bolger does in this sequence
(with the aid of some special effects
prodigies), you can't believe anyone
could have been stupid enough to let
so much of it go. The UCLA Film
Preservation people ought to restore
it to "The Wizard of Oz" perma
nently.


"That's Dancing!" includes this footage of Michael Kidd and Gene
Kelly in a number from the film "It's Always Fair Weather."
