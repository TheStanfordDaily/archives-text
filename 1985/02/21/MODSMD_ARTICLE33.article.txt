John Hughes' "The Breakfast Club"
bristles with the self-importance of a movie
that thinks it has something earth-shattering
to say about teenagers. The charm of last
summers 16 Candles" emerged from
Hughes skill at locating a pocket of high
school experience, both platonic and roman
tic, and reproducing it accurately in the
dialogue and in several of the characters.
That's not a negligible achievement for a
comic writer-director, but it hardly makes
Hughes J.D. Salinger or Carson McCullers, as
The Breakfast Club, a chamber drama in

which five teenagers who seem to have little
in common reach out to each other and dis
cover themselves, indicates.
The five protagonists, stuck together for
eight hours in an unorthodox Saturday deten
tion, are an athlete, Andrew (Emilio Estevez,
of " Repo Man"); a juvenile delinquent, John
(Judd Nelson); a prom queen, Claire (Molly
Rmgwald); an 'A' student, Brian (Andrew
Michael Hall); and an eccentric girl named
Allison (Ally Sheedy, of "War Games" and
"Bad Boys"), who remains silent for the first
half hour and then garners the attention of the
others by devouring a Cap'n Crunch
sandwich for lunch. In the course of the day,

they form alliances, engage in confrontations
of various kinds, get stoned, discuss sex,
reveal their hang-ups, become friends and
pair off; they also deal with the principal
(Paul Gleason, in an unplayable role) and
receive a lecture from the school janitor (John
Kapelos, who also gets to lecture the prin
cipal).
Occasionally Hughes' talent for adolescent
conversation surfaces — "Yeo, wastoid!
You're not blazing up in here!" Andy chal
lenges John when he sneaks a packet of grass
into the detention room — but most of the
dialogue is of a confessional nature, which
strands most of the actors. Judd Nelson, as the
hurt-eyed rebel, plays antagonist for much of
the movie and Rebel Without a Cause for all
of it; he has a strong presence, but the role
forces him on us in a way that is not pleasant.
Emilio Estevez seems straitjacketed by his
good-boy role, especially after "Repo Man,"
and Ally Sheedy is simply miscast as the
"basket case." (This "kook" role is oddly
anachronistic, too — it's something Liza Min
nelli might have played in the laie 19605.)
Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall,
who were terrific as unlikely friends in "16
Candles," fare better, though her perfor
mance gets lost in all the crying she has to do
in the second hour, and you feel cheated that
they only have a fragment of a scene together.
Hall has the advantage of playing comic relief
in almost all the big emotional numbers, and
he's so appealing that he almost carries off his
own confession scene; he's a wonderful com
edian.
This movie is heavy-handed and preten
tious; it even begins with an epigraph, a quote
from David Bowie that sounds like "My Gen
eration" without the put-ons. But at the sneak
preview I saw, several of the teenagers in the
audience were obviously impressed by its self
seriousness. Hughes has certainly discovered
something new — psychodrama for the
juvenile set; in form, the movie is part" Who's
Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" and part "A
Chorus Line." I'm afraid that if he has a hit
with it, he'll never go back to comedy.
