# No go on 'Tape Talk'
## 
### ANDREW CROWELL 
A music magazine on cassette? You must
be joking.
No, really. It's the latest thing. You know,
exploration of a medium through the utiliza
tion of that medium .. . that sort of thing.
It'll never go. I just don't think there's
demand for a music magazine on a 90-
minute cassette.
Well, friends, ol' Country Joe Mac Donald
sure thought there was demand for this
product when he started "Tape Talk" maga
zine. As host Country Joe explains, "My
purpose for starting 'Tape Talk' magazine
was to give exposure to music normally un
heard except in limited circles. (Some of
these circles can be rather large — defined
not only by radio play and sales lists but by
the boundaries of culture, politics and lang
uage.)"
Issue No. 3 of "Tape Talk" gives an over
view of some domestic and foreign music
that definitely reaches only small listening
circles.
Side one presents "The Punk Scene"
through music, interviews and commentary.
Social Distortion, Minor Threat, Millions of
Dead Cats, Suicidal Tendencies, Black Flag
and more pound out thrashing, ear-piercing,
feedback-layered slam tunes leaving the lis
tener in a state of mind which might inspire a
group name smiliar to one of the above. This
is music that frustrates, haunts and pos
sesses; music that comes from the gut and
often makes the listener sick there. As men
tioned in one of the interviews, "Punk is a
statement against traditional rock 'n' roll."
One should correct, however, that it is a
statement against tradition in general.
Heavy stuff?
Well, not all that heavy. In fact, some of
the songs are actually downright mindless.
Hearing that the group Millions of Dead
Cats, commonly referred to as MDC,
"organizes and does painstaking research
into political issues to better inform its lis
teners of what's going on in the country,"
one expects an insightful and informative

piece of music. Right? Unfortunately, their
song "John Wayne Was a Nazi" doesn't
quite hit the mark. "In School," from Die
Kreutzen's profoundly titled "Cows and
Beer" album, tells almost as effectively of
"the mindless boredom often found in public
schools."
Where are the hardcore anti-tradition
tracks?
They're here, too. The aggressive and
polemical "Kill from the Heart" and "Moral
Threat" present the darker side of punk
dogma. Lyrics like "You can't fight justice,
but it'll fight you" only emphasize what the
song and group names fail to tell you about
the problems in contemporary society. Un
fortunately, while this punk music does
make a tremendous amount of noise in com
plaining, it rarely (if ever) proposes solutions
— save anarchy.
Side two is infinitely more intereresting
listening. Featuring international artists and
their music, this section of "Tape Talk" con
tains only one song in English; as a result of
this language barrier, I was only able to fully
appreciate the music and the sound of the
lyrics. The opening cut, "Sally Free and
Easy" by Alan Stivell, is a delightfully
melodic folk song which contrasts ever so
sharply with the grating sounds heard on the
flip side of the tape. Stivell's other song, "Tri
Martolod," is a lovely, Gallic folk song.
Werner Lamerhirt's "Greensleeves" con
tains some incredible acoustic guitar work
while the two cuts by the German techno
pop band Phudy's resemble Kraftwerk both
in song title ("Computer-karriere," for ex
ample) and sound.
"Tape Talk No. 3" does expose some little
heard music though it fails to answer any
questions or make any definitive statements
concerning the music industry. The maga
zine is varied in content but also becomes
uselessly offensive at times.
Is there a market for "Tape Talk"?
Country Joe says yes, but then again,
maybe Country Joe hasn't met Brother
Jim. .. .
