# John Cale gives soul-searching performance
## 
### TONY TRAN 
John Cale has been called the
"great lost rocket of the 19705."
Mention his name and you're likely to
get responses like, "Who's that?" or.
"That sounds really familiar. . . .
Where, have 1 heard that mame
before?" If you go a little further and

John Cale's post-
Velvet Under
ground works deal
with the darker
side of the human
experience. The
themes of isola
tion, alienation
and fear permeate
his music.

say, "He was one of the founders of
the 1960s seminal New York avant
garde band, the Velvet Under
ground," you'll probably get the
reply, "Oh yes, of course. ... He was
one of the people in Lou Reed's
group."
John Cale's musical efforts have al
ways been overshadowed by those of
former bandmate Lou Reed. This
goes all the way back to the split be

tween the two innovators in 1968,
when Cale left the Velvet Under
ground because of artistic and leader
ship conflicts with Reed. This wits
after the group had made its first two
landmark albums — "The Velvet Un
derground and Nico" and "White
Light White Heat" — that contained
much of the basis and inspiration for
all subsequent counter-cultural rock
movements, from techno-rock and
punk to New Age and thrash. It's un
fortunate that Cale's solo recordings
have never been as well-known or
successful with fans and critics as
Reed's. The fact is that in the 19705,
Cale made at least as much good
music, if not more, than Uncle Lou.
Furthermore, Cale deserves more
respect and acclaim, if only for his
considerable accomplishments as a
producer of important punk and new
wave artists such as Patti Smith.
In essence. Cale's post-Velvet
works deal with the darker side of the
human psychological and emotional
experience. The themes of isolation,
alienation, anger, frustration and fear
permeate his compositions. This also
reflects in the brilliantly neurotic
music that is heavy, twisted and dis
cordant in all the right places. Ironi
cally, the words and music combine to
produce in the listener a reponse that
is ultimately inspiring and soul
searching. In short, it's perfect rock
'n' roll —just what you need — if you
ever feel like turning into a nervous
wreck, if you ever desire to experi
ence something akin to a mental
breakdown or if you are fed up with
the usual lightweight sameness on
American top 40.

Upon first entering Wolfgang's
Nightclub in San Francisco the night
of Cale's concert, 1 was a little
surprised and disappointed to see that
the tables reached all the way to the
stage. For the first time in my club
going experience there was no space
for dancing or for just hanging loose
near the stage. The curtains parted to
reveal John Cale alone, sitting on a
stool and strumming a guitar next to
an electric piano. 1 guess I had always
expected a top-notch rock band to
back him up onstage, just as on the
records: for me, the fact that this was

going to be a "solo" concert was
going to take sometime to get used to.
But as the show proceeded, 1
realized my fears and disappoint- '
ments were unfounded. The presence
of a supporting rock band would have
diminished the riveting, startling
force of the awesome spectacle of
John Cale all alone on stage. The ef
fect of seeing and hearing the 6-foot -
plus, heavy-set musician in his shades
— jerking his pick across the guitar
strings, slamming away at the piano
keys (sometimes with open palms) as
if he wished to smash the life out of

them and. all the while, bellowing out
the songs as if he were scared to death
of them —can be compared to seeing
the stereotype of the mad, demonic
scientist at work in his lab or the
phantom of the opera at the grand or
gan.
There was a great deal of im
provisation in the show; Cale kept us
on edge by sometimes sputtering a
song to an abrupt and early end or by
launching into a passage of
proficiently played classical music on
the piano. His playing and singing
tended to oscillate between extremes

of intensity. Several of the songs pei -
formed — notably "Guts, Fear is a
Man's Best Freind." "Leaving It All
Up to You" and his extraordinary
cover version ot Elvis Presley s
"Heartbreak Hotel" — featured a
soft, delicate beginning and gradually
built up in tension and volume to
reach unbelievable peaks of power.
To provide relief from the " heavy
handedness" and psyche-related ma
terial, Cale talked and joked with the
crowd between the songs. He even
spoke of his old buddy Lou Reed:
"You know. It's been said that the
main difference between Lou and me
is that we'd both fuck rattlesnakes,
but Lou would enjoy it."
Thus, his tendency to improvise
and the sense of the unpredictable —
besides the unforgettable visual effect
— would have been greatly restricted
by the external "constrictions" of a
supporting band. The content and
style of the concert helped to explain
the lack of dancing space. The es
sence of John Cale's rock music is to
challenge the mind and emotions; it is
not particularly conducive to dancing.
I could make the small complaint
that the show was too short (an hour
and 15 minutes, including encores).
But 1 won't, because I could actually
have suffered a nervous breakdown
from intensity overload if it had con
tinued much longer. Go see John
Cale in concert — but only if you
have a strong heart, strong, unbiased
ears and a weakness for good, honest
rock 'n' roll that contains more than a
little touch of "madness."

the tables reached all the way to the
stage. For the first time in my club
going experience there was no space
for dancing or for just hanging loose
near the stage. The curtains parted to
reveal John Cale alone, sitting on a
stool and strumming a guitar next to
an electric piano. 1 guess I had always
expected a top-notch rock band to
back him up onstage, just as on the
records: for me, the fact that this was

going to be a "solo" concert was
going to take sometime to get used to.
But as the show proceeded, 1
realized my fears and disappoint- '
ments were unfounded. The presence
of a supporting rock band would have
diminished the riveting, startling
force of the awesome spectacle of
John Cale all alone on stage. The ef
fect of seeing and hearing the 6-foot -
plus, heavy-set musician in his shades
— jerking his pick across the guitar
strings, slamming away at the piano
keys (sometimes with open palms) as
if he wished to smash the life out of

them and. all the while, bellowing out
the songs as if he were scared to death
of them —can be compared to seeing
the stereotype of the mad, demonic
scientist at work in his lab or the
phantom of the opera at the grand or
gan.
There was a great deal of im
provisation in the show; Cale kept us
on edge by sometimes sputtering a
song to an abrupt and early end or by
launching into a passage of
proficiently played classical music on
the piano. His playing and singing
tended to oscillate between extremes

of intensity. Several of the songs pei -
formed — notably "Guts, Fear is a
Man's Best Freind." "Leaving It All
Up to You" and his extraordinary
cover version ot Elvis Presley s
"Heartbreak Hotel" — featured a
soft, delicate beginning and gradually
built up in tension and volume to
reach unbelievable peaks of power.
To provide relief from the " heavy
handedness" and psyche-related ma
terial, Cale talked and joked with the
crowd between the songs. He even
spoke of his old buddy Lou Reed:
"You know. It's been said that the
main difference between Lou and me
is that we'd both fuck rattlesnakes,
but Lou would enjoy it."
Thus, his tendency to improvise
and the sense of the unpredictable —
besides the unforgettable visual effect
— would have been greatly restricted
by the external "constrictions" of a
supporting band. The content and
style of the concert helped to explain
the lack of dancing space. The es
sence of John Cale's rock music is to
challenge the mind and emotions; it is
not particularly conducive to dancing.
I could make the small complaint
that the show was too short (an hour
and 15 minutes, including encores).
But 1 won't, because I could actually
have suffered a nervous breakdown
from intensity overload if it had con
tinued much longer. Go see John
Cale in concert — but only if you
have a strong heart, strong, unbiased
ears and a weakness for good, honest
rock 'n' roll that contains more than a
little touch of "madness."

John Cale has been called the
"great lost rocket of the 19705."
Mention his name and you're likely to
get responses like, "Who's that?" or.
"That sounds really familiar. . . .
Where, have 1 heard that mame
before?" If you go a little further and

John Cale's post-
Velvet Under
ground works deal
with the darker
side of the human
experience. The
themes of isola
tion, alienation
and fear permeate
his music.

say, "He was one of the founders of
the 1960s seminal New York avant
garde band, the Velvet Under
ground," you'll probably get the
reply, "Oh yes, of course. ... He was
one of the people in Lou Reed's
group."
John Cale's musical efforts have al
ways been overshadowed by those of
former bandmate Lou Reed. This
goes all the way back to the split be

tween the two innovators in 1968,
when Cale left the Velvet Under
ground because of artistic and leader
ship conflicts with Reed. This wits
after the group had made its first two
landmark albums — "The Velvet Un
derground and Nico" and "White
Light White Heat" — that contained
much of the basis and inspiration for
all subsequent counter-cultural rock
movements, from techno-rock and
punk to New Age and thrash. It's un
fortunate that Cale's solo recordings
have never been as well-known or
successful with fans and critics as
Reed's. The fact is that in the 19705,
Cale made at least as much good
music, if not more, than Uncle Lou.
Furthermore, Cale deserves more
respect and acclaim, if only for his
considerable accomplishments as a
producer of important punk and new
wave artists such as Patti Smith.
In essence. Cale's post-Velvet
works deal with the darker side of the
human psychological and emotional
experience. The themes of isolation,
alienation, anger, frustration and fear
permeate his compositions. This also
reflects in the brilliantly neurotic
music that is heavy, twisted and dis
cordant in all the right places. Ironi
cally, the words and music combine to
produce in the listener a reponse that
is ultimately inspiring and soul
searching. In short, it's perfect rock
'n' roll —just what you need — if you
ever feel like turning into a nervous
wreck, if you ever desire to experi
ence something akin to a mental
breakdown or if you are fed up with
the usual lightweight sameness on
American top 40.
