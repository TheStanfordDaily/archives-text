## Education dean looks to future 
### GEORGE LeMAITRE 
Citing increased research into artificial intelligence and
an expanding teacher-education program, Myron Atkin,
dean of the School of Education, told a very small gather
ing at Manzanita Park Lounge yesterday that his school is
undergoing a "vigorous period."
The school considered entering the field of artificial in
telligence tor a long time, Atkin said, but since the deci
sion was reached the program has been energetically
pursued.
One of the benefits of this type of research "is its analy
sis into the nature of mistakes,' Atkin said. Artificial-in
telligence research may aid research on learning dis
abilities and other mental processes.
As the school moves toward computers and artificial in
telligence, it also moves away from its former concentra
tion on subject specialization, Atkin said. Atkin said stu
dents are training less and less to work in "specific subject
areas such as social studies, science or mathematics."'
Stanford's Teacher Education Program (STEP) is also
in the midst of change.
In 1979 there were 29 students in the program and
there was talk of phasing it out entirely," Atkin said.
Since then, however, the program has been revitalized
and there are now 65 students, with the quality of appli
cants "going up dramatically," Atkin said.
Contrary to popular belief, Atkin said, "There is still a
core of people who are interested in teaching."
The number of people going into teaching is still not as
large as it was 20 years ago, but Atkin believes this is a
result of increasing job opportunities for women.
" Twenty years ago, women were going into teaching by
default. I here was an extraordinarily high percentage of
women in the field because there were fewer career op
tions," Atkin said.

Before the 19705, men entered education because of in
terest and talent while women entered teaching because
of limited options. As women were increasingly able to
enter professions of their choice, the quality of women
going into education began to equal that of their male
counterparts.
The School of Education is trying to lessen the effect of
one barrier in the way of students there â€” tuition, which
is $9,705 this academic year.
The school makes funds available in a number of ways,
offering students fellowships and the opportunity to be
teaching assistants and resident assistants.
Atkin estimates that the School of Education makes
close to $900,000 available to defray the cost of the tui
tion; 65 to 70 percent of the students receive funding in
one form or another.
One problem in the past, Atkin said, was that people
would stay at the school longer than necessary and would
continue to receive University funding. To change this the
school has moved in the past few years to cut off financial
aid after the fifth year, Atkin said.
I his has had the effect of encouraging people to finish
earlier than they might have, Atkin said.
A Ph.D. normally takes four years to finish, Atkin said,
although some people finish in three
Due to the relatively low salary levels of graduates,
loans are not a truly feasible alternative, Atkin said.
'["hough many of the school's graduates go into teach
ing, there are many other options, according to Atkin.
Many become school administrators, legislative aids for
education policy-making boards, and school-system
evaluators.
Atkin praised the school's students for their superior
abilities with "a touch of idealism."

Dean Myron Atkin says a plethora of changes are taking place at the School of Education. Foremost is the ex
pansion of research in artificial intelligence and the growth in the Stanford Teacher's Education Program.
