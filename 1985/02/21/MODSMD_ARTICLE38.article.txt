I rustees approve hometel project
The Stanford Board of Trustees on Feb. 12 au
thorized construction of a $23.5 million, 150-unit
combined apartment and "hometel" project.
Originally a portion of the Stanford West
housing project, it will be located on a 4.3-acre site
at 1100 Welch Rd., at the intersection of Pasteur
Drive near Stanford Medical Center.
Still subject to approval by Palo Alto, the project
may be cleared to start construction by June, with
completion slated for 18 months later.
It will include 108 condominium apartments,
designated for rental to University and medical
center faculty and staff, and 42 leasehold con
dominiums, to be transfered to the Santa Clara As
sistance League for operation as a "hometel." This
portion of the project would be funded from the
proceeds of a $3,725,000 grant from the William
and Flora Hewlett Foundation to the league.
I he 108 condominium units would be held by
the University and rented out for at least 10 years.
Originally intended entirely for the medical cen
ter, 18 of the units would be aailable for scientific
visitors at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
and IS available to the provost for assignment to
faculty or to scholarly visitors. These would substi
tute for Peter Coutts Hill units now rented for this
purpose which the University expects will be sold
by the time the Welch Road project is completed.
Kennedy places in influence survey
University President Donald Kennedy placed
third on the list of private-sector leaders in higher
education, according to a survey of public college
and university presidents.
The survey was conducted by the State Univer
sity of New York in cooperation with the National
Association of State University and Land-Grant
Colleges (NASULGC) and the American Associa
tion of State Colleges and Universities (AASCU).
It was sent to 507 public college and university
presidents around the country last fall, of which
242 responded.
The presidents surveyed named Derek Bok,
president of Harvard University, the most influen
tial higher-education leader in the private sector.
The survey conclude that President Reagan has the
most overall influence in higher education.
Professional journalism program gets new director
James Risser, Pulitzer Prize-winning Washington
bureau chief of The Des Moines Register, has been
named the new director of the John Knight Fellow
ships for journalists here, succeeding Lyle Nelson,
who is stepping down June 1.
Nelson will be on sabbatical during 1985-86 and
will retire in June 1986.
Risser, 46, was the unanimous choice of a
faculty-professional committee, which considered
nearly 30 names in its nationwide search. His ap
pointment was announced Feb. 12 by the Stanford
Board of Trustees.
Harry Press will continue as the program's
managing director.
The Knight program offers up to 12 fellowships
each year to U.S. journalists who have demon
strated uncommon excellence in their work and
who have the potential of reaching the top ranks in
their specialities. During their nine months at Stan

ford, they have the opportunity to make use of the
University's full educational and cultural resources
as auditors in classes and special seminars.
Risser, a journalism fellow at Stanford in 1973-
74, won Pulitzer Prizes for national reporting in
1976 and again in 1979. The first was for stories
disclosing corruption in the U.S. grain export in
dustry; the second was for a series on environmen
tal damage caused by modern U.S. agriculture. Ris
ser joined The Register as a reporter in 1964,
moved to the Washington bureau in 1969, and has
headed the bureau since 1976.
Risser and his wife, Sandi, who is assistant direc
tor of public affairs for the national office of the
League of Women Voters, have two sons.
Reagan awards medal to Landau
President Reagan awarded the National Medal
of Technology Tuesday to Ralph Landau, consult
ing professor of economics and chemical engineer
ing here and vice president of the National
Academy of Engineering.
Landau was presented the award at the White
House "for his technical leadership and
entrepreneurial roles in the development of com
mercially successful petrochemical processes which
have been licensed or jointly developed and have
helped maintain U.S. leadership in petrochemical
processing."
Landau is one of 12 recipients of this newly es
tablished award, which will be given annually by
the president.
In 1983, Landau was named by the American In
stitute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) as one of
30 eminent chemical engineers who are "prime ex
amples of the achievements the AIChE has stood
for since it was founded in 1908."
He has served as chairman and chief executive
office of Halcon International, the firm he helped
found in 1946 as Scientific Design Company.
Landau holds major patents in organic oxidation
chemistry, has published more than 80 papers and
has championed innovation and industrial
entrepreneurship worldwide.
Landau is also a life member of the MIT Corp.; a
trustee of the University of Pennsylvania; chair
man, Advisory Boards of the Engineering Schools
at both Princeton University and the University of
Pennsylvania; trustee of the American Health
Foundation; and a member of the 1001 Club (a na
ture trust), the American Academy of Arts and
Sciences and the Directors of Industrial Research.
He also is a director of the Aluminum Company of
America.
Stage director joins Drama Department
Carl Weber, an internationally known stage
director who studied with Bertolt Brecht, has been
appointed professor in the Stanford Department of
Drama, effective Feb. 1.
Weber, 59, was professor of directing at New
York University from 1966 to 1984. He teaches a
variety of courses on directing.
Weber served as Brecht's major assistant in the
playwright-director's final years at the Berliner En
semble in East Berlin. After Brecht's death in
1956, Weber became resident director at the en
semble.

He came to the United States in the 1960s and
for a time directed in the Brechtian style, eventu
ally emerging as a major figure in his own right.
He has been responsible for the American
premieres of some of the foremost post-Brechtian
playwrights. His productions of European classics
and new American plays have earned him a reputa
tion as a highly experimental director with a facility
to work in a variety of periods and styles.
Weber's professional directing experience
encludes work with the Deutsches Theater in Ber
lin, the Schaubueehne in Berlin, the San Francisco
Actors Workshop, the Lincoln Center Repertory in
New York, the Arena Stage in Washington D.C.,
the Yale Repertory Theatre, the Chelsea Theater
Center in New York and the Badisches
Staatstheater in Karlsruhe.
Faculty representatives support catalog conversion
Faculty representatives have backed faster con
version to electric cataloging at the Stanford libra
ries.
The committee on libraries has already voted
unanimously in favor of more funding to speed the
conversion, committee chairman History Prof.
Peter Paret told the Faculty Senate.
The library staff would welcome faculty advice
on areas for early processing, he added.
The present online system, called Socrates, con
tains little coverage of items received prior to 1972.
Starting in June, bibliographic records no longer
will be entered in the card catalog at Green Library
and branches, a move expected to save about
$100,000 annually.
This means scholars often must search both the
card file and the electronic catalog for their re
search.
History Prof. Carl Degler has urged an expan
sion of terminals at the libraries during the transi
tion toward a more complete electronic catalog.
Currently, 30 terminals for public use have been
put in place at 13 library locations. Another 25
lines and terminals are being ordered. These may
be available by this summer for use, as needed, in
reducing excessive queuing for library users.
Researcher receives Markey award
Michael Cleary, a graduate of the University of
Cincinnati College of Medicine and currently en
gaged in research at Stanford University, has been
selected as one of 16 biomedical scientists to
receive a 1985 Markey Scholar Award.
Authorities have recognized Cleary's work as
having a major impact on diagnostic pathology and
pointing toward a new approach to the diagnosis
and characterization of human tumors.
The principal author of more than a dozen scien
tific papers, Cleary will share in this year's more
than $700,000 in grants. The aware program was
established by the Lucille Markey Charitable Trust
to provide research funds and salary support for
each recipient's three to four years of advanced and
specialized study.
"The Markey Scholar grants are particularly at
tractive since they provide generous salary and re
search support for promising biomedical scientists
at a most important phase of their careers," accord
ing to Robert Glaser, a former dean of the Stanford
University Medical School who now serves as the
trust's director for medical science.

Stage director joins Drama Department
Carl Weber, an internationally known stage
director who studied with Bertolt Brecht, has been
appointed professor in the Stanford Department of
Drama, effective Feb. 1.
Weber, 59, was professor of directing at New
York University from 1966 to 1984. He teaches a
variety of courses on directing.
Weber served as Brecht's major assistant in the
playwright-director's final years at the Berliner En
semble in East Berlin. After Brecht's death in
1956, Weber became resident director at the en
semble.

He came to the United States in the 1960s and
for a time directed in the Brechtian style, eventu
ally emerging as a major figure in his own right.
He has been responsible for the American
premieres of some of the foremost post-Brechtian
playwrights. His productions of European classics
and new American plays have earned him a reputa
tion as a highly experimental director with a facility
to work in a variety of periods and styles.
Weber's professional directing experience
encludes work with the Deutsches Theater in Ber
lin, the Schaubueehne in Berlin, the San Francisco
Actors Workshop, the Lincoln Center Repertory in
New York, the Arena Stage in Washington D.C.,
the Yale Repertory Theatre, the Chelsea Theater
Center in New York and the Badisches

Faculty representatives support catalog conversion
Faculty representatives have backed faster con
version to electric cataloging at the Stanford libra
ries.
The committee on libraries has already voted
unanimously in favor of more funding to speed the
conversion, committee chairman History Prof.
Peter Paret told the Faculty Senate.
The library staff would welcome faculty advice
on areas for early processing, he added.
The present online system, called Socrates, con
tains little coverage of items received prior to 1972.
Starting in June, bibliographic records no longer
will be entered in the card catalog at Green Library
and branches, a move expected to save about
$100,000 annually.
This means scholars often must search both the
card file and the electronic catalog for their re
search.
History Prof. Carl Degler has urged an expan
sion of terminals at the libraries during the transi
tion toward a more complete electronic catalog.
Currently, 30 terminals for public use have been
put in place at 13 library locations. Another 25
lines and terminals are being ordered. These may
be available by this summer for use, as needed, in
reducing excessive queuing for library users.
Researcher receives Markey award
Michael Cleary, a graduate of the University of
Cincinnati College of Medicine and currently en
gaged in research at Stanford University, has been
selected as one of 16 biomedical scientists to
receive a 1985 Markey Scholar Award.
Authorities have recognized Cleary's work as
having a major impact on diagnostic pathology and
pointing toward a new approach to the diagnosis
and characterization of human tumors.
The principal author of more than a dozen scien
tific papers, Cleary will share in this year's more
than $700,000 in grants. The aware program was
established by the Lucille Markey Charitable Trust
to provide research funds and salary support for
each recipient's three to four years of advanced and
specialized study.
"The Markey Scholar grants are particularly at
tractive since they provide generous salary and re
search support for promising biomedical scientists
at a most important phase of their careers," accord
ing to Robert Glaser, a former dean of the Stanford
University Medical School who now serves as the
trust's director for medical science.
I rustees approve hometel project
The Stanford Board of Trustees on Feb. 12 au
thorized construction of a $23.5 million, 150-unit
combined apartment and "hometel" project.
Originally a portion of the Stanford West
housing project, it will be located on a 4.3-acre site
at 1100 Welch Rd., at the intersection of Pasteur
Drive near Stanford Medical Center.
Still subject to approval by Palo Alto, the project
may be cleared to start construction by June, with
completion slated for 18 months later.
It will include 108 condominium apartments,
designated for rental to University and medical
center faculty and staff, and 42 leasehold con
dominiums, to be transfered to the Santa Clara As
sistance League for operation as a "hometel." This
portion of the project would be funded from the
proceeds of a $3,725,000 grant from the William
and Flora Hewlett Foundation to the league.
I he 108 condominium units would be held by
the University and rented out for at least 10 years.
Originally intended entirely for the medical cen
ter, 18 of the units would be aailable for scientific
visitors at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
and IS available to the provost for assignment to
faculty or to scholarly visitors. These would substi
tute for Peter Coutts Hill units now rented for this
purpose which the University expects will be sold
by the time the Welch Road project is completed.

Professional journalism program gets new director
James Risser, Pulitzer Prize-winning Washington
bureau chief of The Des Moines Register, has been
named the new director of the John Knight Fellow
ships for journalists here, succeeding Lyle Nelson,
who is stepping down June 1.
Nelson will be on sabbatical during 1985-86 and
will retire in June 1986.
Risser, 46, was the unanimous choice of a
faculty-professional committee, which considered
nearly 30 names in its nationwide search. His ap
pointment was announced Feb. 12 by the Stanford
Board of Trustees.
Harry Press will continue as the program's
managing director.
The Knight program offers up to 12 fellowships
each year to U.S. journalists who have demon
strated uncommon excellence in their work and
who have the potential of reaching the top ranks in
their specialities. During their nine months at Stan

ford, they have the opportunity to make use of the
University's full educational and cultural resources
as auditors in classes and special seminars.
Risser, a journalism fellow at Stanford in 1973-
74, won Pulitzer Prizes for national reporting in
1976 and again in 1979. The first was for stories
disclosing corruption in the U.S. grain export in
dustry; the second was for a series on environmen
tal damage caused by modern U.S. agriculture. Ris
ser joined The Register as a reporter in 1964,
moved to the Washington bureau in 1969, and has
headed the bureau since 1976.
Risser and his wife, Sandi, who is assistant direc
tor of public affairs for the national office of the
League of Women Voters, have two sons.
Reagan awards medal to Landau
President Reagan awarded the National Medal
of Technology Tuesday to Ralph Landau, consult
ing professor of economics and chemical engineer
ing here and vice president of the National
Academy of Engineering.
Landau was presented the award at the White
House "for his technical leadership and
entrepreneurial roles in the development of com
mercially successful petrochemical processes which
have been licensed or jointly developed and have
helped maintain U.S. leadership in petrochemical
processing."
Landau is one of 12 recipients of this newly es
tablished award, which will be given annually by
the president.
In 1983, Landau was named by the American In
stitute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) as one of
30 eminent chemical engineers who are "prime ex
amples of the achievements the AIChE has stood
for since it was founded in 1908."
He has served as chairman and chief executive
office of Halcon International, the firm he helped
found in 1946 as Scientific Design Company.

Stage director joins Drama Department
Carl Weber, an internationally known stage
director who studied with Bertolt Brecht, has been
appointed professor in the Stanford Department of
Drama, effective Feb. 1.
Weber, 59, was professor of directing at New
York University from 1966 to 1984. He teaches a
variety of courses on directing.
Weber served as Brecht's major assistant in the
playwright-director's final years at the Berliner En
semble in East Berlin. After Brecht's death in
1956, Weber became resident director at the en
semble.

He came to the United States in the 1960s and
for a time directed in the Brechtian style, eventu
ally emerging as a major figure in his own right.
He has been responsible for the American
premieres of some of the foremost post-Brechtian
playwrights. His productions of European classics
and new American plays have earned him a reputa
tion as a highly experimental director with a facility
to work in a variety of periods and styles.
Weber's professional directing experience
encludes work with the Deutsches Theater in Ber
lin, the Schaubueehne in Berlin, the San Francisco
Actors Workshop, the Lincoln Center Repertory in
New York, the Arena Stage in Washington D.C.,
the Yale Repertory Theatre, the Chelsea Theater
Center in New York and the Badisches
Staatstheater in Karlsruhe.
Faculty representatives support catalog conversion
Faculty representatives have backed faster con
version to electric cataloging at the Stanford libra
ries.
The committee on libraries has already voted
unanimously in favor of more funding to speed the
conversion, committee chairman History Prof.
Peter Paret told the Faculty Senate.
The library staff would welcome faculty advice
on areas for early processing, he added.
The present online system, called Socrates, con
tains little coverage of items received prior to 1972.
Starting in June, bibliographic records no longer
will be entered in the card catalog at Green Library
and branches, a move expected to save about
$100,000 annually.
This means scholars often must search both the
card file and the electronic catalog for their re
search.
History Prof. Carl Degler has urged an expan
sion of terminals at the libraries during the transi
tion toward a more complete electronic catalog.
Currently, 30 terminals for public use have been
put in place at 13 library locations. Another 25
lines and terminals are being ordered. These may
be available by this summer for use, as needed, in
reducing excessive queuing for library users.
Researcher receives Markey award
Michael Cleary, a graduate of the University of
Cincinnati College of Medicine and currently en
gaged in research at Stanford University, has been
selected as one of 16 biomedical scientists to
receive a 1985 Markey Scholar Award.
Authorities have recognized Cleary's work as
having a major impact on diagnostic pathology and
pointing toward a new approach to the diagnosis
and characterization of human tumors.
The principal author of more than a dozen scien
tific papers, Cleary will share in this year's more
than $700,000 in grants. The aware program was
established by the Lucille Markey Charitable Trust
to provide research funds and salary support for
each recipient's three to four years of advanced and
specialized study.
"The Markey Scholar grants are particularly at
tractive since they provide generous salary and re
search support for promising biomedical scientists
at a most important phase of their careers," accord
ing to Robert Glaser, a former dean of the Stanford
University Medical School who now serves as the
trust's director for medical science.
