# More senators to leave ASSU
## 
### JOYA WESLEY Staff writer 
Saying he doesn't "believe the
ASSU does anything useful," Derek
Passarelli resigned this week, the
fourth ASSU senator to quit his posi
tion since September. Another
senator, Gloria Johnson, says she'll
quit her post next week.
But while resignations appear to be
a trend, past and present senate and
executive officials disagree over
what's causing students to leave the
ASSU. And Senate Chair Eric Berg
says the resignations are a form of
"self-selection" that can be cxpected
at this time of year.
Passarelli said the senate does
more damage than good io student
organizations and their projects. He
advocates eliminating the ASSU as a
whole and setting up a series of com
mittees, which would run such pro
grams as the Sunday Flicks.
He also said he he feels he can ac
complish more as a student working
for other organizations.
Johnson said conflicting time com
mitments as well as frustration are
her reasons for leaving her post.
"I wanted to represent minority in
terests in the senate but I don't feel
I've had an opportunity to do that,"
she said. Johnson, the only black
senator, says the senate is too
"bureaucratic and pcd&ntic" .to pro

vide the right services for the student
body.
Berg said the senate as a whole has
not been hurt by these resignations.
All of the leadership positions are
filled and things are still running
smoothly, he said.
The senate chair explained that
there are a number of resignations
every year. He said the current rash
of resignations is a function of the
self-selection process that takes place
every year at this time. Senators, he
said, realize exactly what the job en
tails and decide whether they have
time for it.
"I would have been surprised if we
finished the year with everyone we
started with," he said.
Former Senator Bob Slater also
spoke positively about the senate,
saying he resigned because he didn't
want to perform his job half
heartedly. Slater said he had a busy
schedule and wanted to devote more
time to other activities during his last
quarter at Stanford.
Alice Wells, a former member of
the Council of Presidents who
resigned earlier this year, said she
feels senators experience a great deal
of frustration. She said this did not,
however, play a part in her own resig
nation, which was for academic and
financial reasons alone.
"There's very little infrastucture in
the ASSU Senate," she said. A
senator must assume total responsi
bility for any project he or she in
itiates. This means doing practically
all of the work from beginning to end,
according to Wells.
Jay Alter, currently a senator, said
he feels frustration in the senate
stems from a lack of knowledge of the
issues about which the senate makes
decisions.
"If senators were given more in
volvement with getting information,
they would have a greater under

standing from which to make deci
sions," he said.
He cited as examples those issues
with which senators have a direct
link, such as the Guest Professorship
Bureau, the Program Board and the
Publications Board. These issues take
less time to handle, Alter said.
Graduate Senator Roland Van
Gaalen, who resigned earlier this
quarter, had positive comments.
"I'm very impressed with this
year's senate," he said. Van Gaalen, a
three-year veteran, said he was
forced to resign for academic reasons.
"I realized that the ASSU doesn't
grant Ph.D.s," he said.
George Ramos, an undergraduate
senator, resigned earlier this year
when he stopped out of school.
