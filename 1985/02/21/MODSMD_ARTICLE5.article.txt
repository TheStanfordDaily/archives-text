# Conklin, fraternities clash over selectivity

### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Staff writer 
"l'm not convinced that you can't
have a fraternal organization whose
standards for selection are expressed
clearly and objectively," Diana Con
klin, the director of the Row, said last
night at a forum on residential educa
tion and fraternities at Stanford.
"1 think there are objective ways to
measure commitment and interest,"
Conklin said in discussing the subject
of whether subjective selectivity used
by fraternities is appropriate. The
forum, which was sponsored by Phi
Kappa Psi, Residential Education
and host Yost House, was attended
by 25 people.
Conklin was joined by Keith Light,
the associate director of admissions
and Sigma Chi chapter adviser, and
Danny Parker, Phi Delta Theta resi
dent assistant.
Light challenged Conklin to com
pare the admissions process with the
selective process used by fraternities.
"Of course we use subjective
criteria in admissions," Conklin
replied, "but once you're in Stanford
everything the University has ought
to be pretty equally available to you
based on your own initiative and your
own interests. It's a tight front door,
but it's wide open once you get in."
Parker said, "I don't think we can
get away without subjective selec
tivity and still have them be fraterni

ties. What I think would be useful is
to clarify some of the myths sur
rounding how people are selected."
Parker said what struck him about
the selection process was that it is not
as mythical as everyone thinks.
"What it really boils down to is
how well someone is known," Parker
said. "1 think most people were given
a fair shake."
Conklin, in her opening remarks,
said the common perception that fra
ternities are being "forced out" be
cause the University wants stricter
control of housing is incorrect.
"We now have 35 houses devoted
to the proposition that we believe in
student initiative and student-run
housing," Conklin said. "We believe
in this, but that doesn't mean that
they are apart from the University
and immune from certain basic stand
ards that we have for all."
All three panelists agreed that fra
ternities can play a positive role in
residential education.
"I really believe students should
have a large measure of control,"
Conklin said. "What they learn from
each other can surpass anything in the
classroom."
"Much of what you learn is just a
matter of serendipity," Light said.
"There is a limit to whether or not we
should try to make residential cduca
