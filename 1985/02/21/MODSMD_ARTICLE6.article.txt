# Zare, Berg win National Medals of Science
## 
### CAMERON KALLER Senior staff writer 
Profs. Paul Berg and Richard Zarc will be
awarded the National Medal of Science, one of
the nation's highest scientific honors, Wednesday.
President Reagan will present the award to 19
scientists and engineers this year in honor of their
achievements and contributions to the current
state of physical, biological, mathematical, engi
neering, behavioral or social sciences.
Berg, the Willson Professor of Biochemistry at
Stanford Medical School, is being honored "for
fundamental contributions to understanding the
mechanisms of gene expression, for the develop
ment of recombinant DNA and for a deep con
cern for its safe and humane application to
medicine," according to a press release from the
Stanford News Service.
Zare, the Shell Distinguished Professor of
Biochemistry at the medical center, is being
honored "for his seminal contributions to
molecular spectroscopy, photochemistry and
chemical reaction dynamics, especially for his in

cisive theoretical methods and the development
of the experimental technique of laser-induced
flourescence," the release said.
Zarc told The Daily he is "very excited and
thrilled about getting the award" and says he
thinks he is "one of the youngest people to
receive it."
Zare explained that his research "is on the bor
derline between chemistry and physics," and in
the "general area of trying to understand how
chemical reactions occur, collision by collision."
"It's 'fundamental research' that cannot be
commercialized." he said.
Berg told I he Daily that the award was "a nice
honor since it presumably comes from fellow sci
entists and colleagues.
"Nominations are given, then there is a com
mittee who reads them and selects some number
of candidates," Berg said.
The Committee on the National Medal of Sci
ence receives approximately 150 nominations for
the award each year.
Berg graduated from Pennsylvania State IJni

versity and was awarded a Ph.D. in biochemistry
from Western Reserve University in 1952. He
received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1980.
He is currently researching the "mcchanism of
gene expression in higher organisms, particularly
the interplay of viral and cellular genes in
regulating growth and division." according to the
news service release.
Berg has been a Stanford professor for 26
years.
/are was a Harvard Scholar from 1957-61 and
received his Ph.D. in chemistry and physics from
Harvard in 1964. He received a National
Acadcmy of Science award in 1976.
/.are came to Stanford eight years ago. He is
presently on sabbatical, but will return in the
spring to teach Chemistry 123.
All of the elected candidates will go to Wash
ington Tuesday for a dinner given by the
National Academy of Sciences, and the next day
to a brief ceremony at the White House where
the president will present the medals. Berg said.
