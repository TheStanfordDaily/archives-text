U.S. reacts to New Zealand move
WASHINGTON — T he United States is in the process of withdraw
ing from nearly all military cooperation with New Zealand because of its
refusal to accept port calls from U.S. nuclear warships, administration
officials said yesterday.
Secretary of State George Shultz, sketching the rationale for the unus
ual if not unprecedented U.S. action, told the Senate Budget Committee
Tuesday that "New Zealand has basically taken a walk" from the
ANZUS military alliance because of its refusal to accept port calls from
U.S. nuclear-armed or nuclear-powered warships.
The ANZUS Treaty, signed in 1951, binds Australia, New Zealand
and the United States in a defense relationship. Shultz said the treaty
will be kept intact formally, at least on paper, so that "if there is a change
of mind at some point down the road (by New Zealand), it is there to be
made operative again."
New Zealand Prime Minister David Lange, whose anti-nuclear Labor
Party was voted into power last July, is to be met in Los Angeles Tues
day by William Brown, deputy assistant secretary of state, the State De
partment announced. Lange, who will be en route to a conference in
London, is to make a speech in California defending his government's
nuclear views.
When he gets to London, according to reports in the British press,
Lange will be told that his anti-nuclear policies will prevent British war
ships from visiting New Zealand ports. Britain, like the United States,
refuses to say whether its warships are carrying nuclear weapons.
Overt aid for contras?
WASHINGTON — The Reagan administration, faced with stiff op
position in Congress to covert aid for rebels fighting Nicaragua's leftist
government, appears to be moving toward funding them overtly, accord
ing to the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) said that administration officials are
reviewing a variety of alternatives for funding the rebels, known as
"contras," in an attempt to circumvent congressional opposition to the
president's request for $14 million in covert aid for fiscal 1986. Overt
aid is the leading alternative now being considered by Reagan, he indi
cated.
"The conditions that were tied around that $14 million proposal (by
Congress) are not going to fly because they do get back into the covert
thing and the Intelligence Committee," he said. "But another program
might (pass Congress) and might still involve the contras."
Congressional Democrats last year cut off the officially secret CIA
funding for the rebels after spending more than $73 million since 1981
on the covert war against Nicaragua's Sandinista regime. Last October,
Congress again refused to provide the money but set aside $14 million to
be available in March if both the Senate and House vote to release the
funding.
Rain welcomed in southern Africa
HARARE, Zimbabwe — The 3-year-long drought that halved food
production and crippled national economies in this region appears to be
lifting for Zimbabwe and some of its southern Africa neighbors.
Two months of steady, drenching rainfall has doused parched
farmlands and filled to capacity two-thirds of Zimbabwe's reservoirs,
setting the stage for what agricultural officials cautiously predict may be
one of the country's best food crop years ever.
According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO), rain has also fallen in sufficient quantities in Malawi, Swaziland,
Angola, Zambia and parts of Mozambique. Nonetheless, because har
vests are not due for several months, the latter three countries and Zim
babwe remain on the FAO's list of 28 African nations most seriously af
fected by drought.
In Washington, meteorologist Douglas Le Comte of the National
Oceanographic and Atmospheric Agency, confirmed that there had
been heavy rain in those countries, adding: "You could almost say the
. . . drought is over in southern Africa."
Although there have also been scattered rains in central Africa,
analyists say the forecast for the rest of the continent, including Et
hiopia, is still in doubt. A senior U.N. official, Bradford Morse, director
of the Office for Emergency Operations, said earlier this month that 34
million Africans remain critically affected by drought and famine.
U.S., Soviets end Mideast talks
VIENNA — The United States and the Soviet Union concluded their
first major consultations on the Middle East in more than seven years
here yesterday but gave no indication whether the talks could lead to
new peace negotiations to break the impasse in the Arab-Israeli conflict.
The two delegations, composed of senior diplomatic specialists in
Middle East affairs, held five hours of discussions at the U.S. Embassy
yesterday meeting at the Soviet Embassy for five hours on Tuesday.
In Washington, a State Department spokesman said there would be
no statement until the U.S. delegation head, Richard Murphy, assistant
secretary for Near Eastern and South Asian affairs, has returned to the
United States.
The discussions were considered significant because they extended
U.S.-Soviet dialogue beyond arms control to an area of vital regional in
terest. The last time the two countries held high-level talks dealing with
the region was in 1977.
State Department officials have insisted that the meeting was intended
chiefly to provide an exchange of views about respective Middle East
policies and not to engage in actual negotiations that could lead to super
power cooperation in a new peace conference.
Israel raids Lebanese village
JERUSALEM — Israeli troops raided a Shia Moslem village six miles
east of Tyre in southern Lebanon yesterday, killing two persons, wound
ing at least one and destroying three buildings, an Israeli army spokes
man said.
The Christian Voice of Lebanon radio station reported that the Is
raelis searched three additional southern Lebanese villages yesterday
but there was no immediate confirmation from the army.
The actions came one day after Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Rabin issued what a senior security source called "new guidelines" for
occupation troops. The guidelines, calling for stronger measures against
villages harboring mostly Shia Moslem guerrillas opposed to the occupa
tion, were issued in response to a wave of attacks that have left seven Is
raeli soldiers dead in the last 10 days, the source said. He said there
would be no shelling of villages but promised: "We'll make sure things
are a lot more difficult for them."
Last Saturday, Israel completed the first stage of a three-phase
withdrawal from southern Lebanon, which they have occupied since
their June 1982 invasion. Since the invasion, 619 Israeli soldiers have
been killed.
The withdrawal plan was approved by the government Jan. 14. But
guerrilla attacks have increased since the decision, particularly in areas
from which the Israelis are not scheduled to evacuate until the final
phase of the pullout.
As a result, conflicting political pressures have emerged in Jerusalem,
with some officials arguing that the army should withdraw immediately
to the international border while others press for permanent Israeli oc
cupation of southern Lebanon between the border and a new fortified
line along the Litani River.
"In a country like Lebanon . .. you are respected and there is law and
order if it is known that you take tough measures whenever anything
happens." said Yuval Neeman. an Israeli Parliament member from the
rightist Tchiya party and one advocate of a permanent Israeli presence
in the south.
Speaking yesterday in an interview with Radio Israel, he added: "If
you believe that by being nice and forgiving you make people love you,
it's just the contrary."
In a radio interview Tuesday night, Maj. Gen. Yehoshua Saguy,
former director of military intelligence, said withdrawal to a fortified line
along the Litani would probably cause an international political furor,
but added that the political price is preferable to "the price in blood" of
the current situation.

vests are not due for several months, the latter three countries and Zim
babwe remain on the FAO's list of 28 African nations most seriously af
fected by drought.
In Washington, meteorologist Douglas Le Comte of the National
Oceanographic and Atmospheric Agency, confirmed that there had
been heavy rain in those countries, adding: "You could almost say the
. . . drought is over in southern Africa."
Although there have also been scattered rains in central Africa,
analyists say the forecast for the rest of the continent, including Et
hiopia, is still in doubt. A senior U.N. official, Bradford Morse, director
of the Office for Emergency Operations, said earlier this month that 34
million Africans remain critically affected by drought and famine.
U.S., Soviets end Mideast talks
VIENNA — The United States and the Soviet Union concluded their
first major consultations on the Middle East in more than seven years
here yesterday but gave no indication whether the talks could lead to
new peace negotiations to break the impasse in the Arab-Israeli conflict.
The two delegations, composed of senior diplomatic specialists in
Middle East affairs, held five hours of discussions at the U.S. Embassy
yesterday meeting at the Soviet Embassy for five hours on Tuesday.
In Washington, a State Department spokesman said there would be
no statement until the U.S. delegation head, Richard Murphy, assistant
secretary for Near Eastern and South Asian affairs, has returned to the
United States.
The discussions were considered significant because they extended
U.S.-Soviet dialogue beyond arms control to an area of vital regional in
terest. The last time the two countries held high-level talks dealing with
the region was in 1977.
State Department officials have insisted that the meeting was intended
chiefly to provide an exchange of views about respective Middle East
policies and not to engage in actual negotiations that could lead to super
power cooperation in a new peace conference.
Israel raids Lebanese village
JERUSALEM — Israeli troops raided a Shia Moslem village six miles
east of Tyre in southern Lebanon yesterday, killing two persons, wound
ing at least one and destroying three buildings, an Israeli army spokes
man said.
The Christian Voice of Lebanon radio station reported that the Is
raelis searched three additional southern Lebanese villages yesterday
but there was no immediate confirmation from the army.
The actions came one day after Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Rabin issued what a senior security source called "new guidelines" for
occupation troops. The guidelines, calling for stronger measures against
villages harboring mostly Shia Moslem guerrillas opposed to the occupa
tion, were issued in response to a wave of attacks that have left seven Is
raeli soldiers dead in the last 10 days, the source said. He said there
would be no shelling of villages but promised: "We'll make sure things
are a lot more difficult for them."
Last Saturday, Israel completed the first stage of a three-phase
withdrawal from southern Lebanon, which they have occupied since
their June 1982 invasion. Since the invasion, 619 Israeli soldiers have
been killed.
The withdrawal plan was approved by the government Jan. 14. But
guerrilla attacks have increased since the decision, particularly in areas
from which the Israelis are not scheduled to evacuate until the final
phase of the pullout.
As a result, conflicting political pressures have emerged in Jerusalem,
with some officials arguing that the army should withdraw immediately
to the international border while others press for permanent Israeli oc
cupation of southern Lebanon between the border and a new fortified
line along the Litani River.
"In a country like Lebanon . .. you are respected and there is law and
order if it is known that you take tough measures whenever anything
happens." said Yuval Neeman. an Israeli Parliament member from the
rightist Tchiya party and one advocate of a permanent Israeli presence
in the south.
Speaking yesterday in an interview with Radio Israel, he added: "If
you believe that by being nice and forgiving you make people love you,
it's just the contrary."
In a radio interview Tuesday night, Maj. Gen. Yehoshua Saguy,
former director of military intelligence, said withdrawal to a fortified line
along the Litani would probably cause an international political furor,
but added that the political price is preferable to "the price in blood" of
the current situation.
U.S. reacts to New Zealand move
WASHINGTON — T he United States is in the process of withdraw
ing from nearly all military cooperation with New Zealand because of its
refusal to accept port calls from U.S. nuclear warships, administration
officials said yesterday.
Secretary of State George Shultz, sketching the rationale for the unus
ual if not unprecedented U.S. action, told the Senate Budget Committee
Tuesday that "New Zealand has basically taken a walk" from the
ANZUS military alliance because of its refusal to accept port calls from
U.S. nuclear-armed or nuclear-powered warships.
The ANZUS Treaty, signed in 1951, binds Australia, New Zealand
and the United States in a defense relationship. Shultz said the treaty
will be kept intact formally, at least on paper, so that "if there is a change
of mind at some point down the road (by New Zealand), it is there to be
made operative again."
New Zealand Prime Minister David Lange, whose anti-nuclear Labor
Party was voted into power last July, is to be met in Los Angeles Tues
day by William Brown, deputy assistant secretary of state, the State De
partment announced. Lange, who will be en route to a conference in
London, is to make a speech in California defending his government's
nuclear views.
When he gets to London, according to reports in the British press,
Lange will be told that his anti-nuclear policies will prevent British war
ships from visiting New Zealand ports. Britain, like the United States,
refuses to say whether its warships are carrying nuclear weapons.
Overt aid for contras?
WASHINGTON — The Reagan administration, faced with stiff op
position in Congress to covert aid for rebels fighting Nicaragua's leftist
government, appears to be moving toward funding them overtly, accord
ing to the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) said that administration officials are
reviewing a variety of alternatives for funding the rebels, known as
"contras," in an attempt to circumvent congressional opposition to the
president's request for $14 million in covert aid for fiscal 1986. Overt
aid is the leading alternative now being considered by Reagan, he indi
cated.
"The conditions that were tied around that $14 million proposal (by
Congress) are not going to fly because they do get back into the covert
thing and the Intelligence Committee," he said. "But another program
might (pass Congress) and might still involve the contras."
Congressional Democrats last year cut off the officially secret CIA
funding for the rebels after spending more than $73 million since 1981
on the covert war against Nicaragua's Sandinista regime. Last October,
Congress again refused to provide the money but set aside $14 million to
be available in March if both the Senate and House vote to release the
funding.
Rain welcomed in southern Africa
HARARE, Zimbabwe — The 3-year-long drought that halved food
production and crippled national economies in this region appears to be
lifting for Zimbabwe and some of its southern Africa neighbors.
Two months of steady, drenching rainfall has doused parched
farmlands and filled to capacity two-thirds of Zimbabwe's reservoirs,
setting the stage for what agricultural officials cautiously predict may be
one of the country's best food crop years ever.
According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO), rain has also fallen in sufficient quantities in Malawi, Swaziland,
Angola, Zambia and parts of Mozambique. Nonetheless, because har
vests are not due for several months, the latter three countries and Zim
babwe remain on the FAO's list of 28 African nations most seriously af
