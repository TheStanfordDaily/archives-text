# Filibuster blocks Meese vote
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Senate Democrats yester
day launched a filibuster to block the expected con
firmation of Attorney General-designate Edwin
Meese 111 until an emergency farm-credit aid pro
gram is worked out. prompting sharp protests from
President Reagan and Senate Majority Leader
Robert Dole (R-Kan.).
Reagan called the move "ridiculous." Dole,
faced with his first major political challenge since
becoming majority leader last month, called it
"blackmail."
The Democratic-led Senate filibuster came as
House Democrats moved toward approval of $ 1
billion in farm-loan guarantees and additional
funds to help speed processing of loans. The legis
lation, drafted by an appropriations subcommittee,
is expected to be approved by the Appropriations
Committee today and by the House Tuesday.
It was the first time since the 99th Congress con
vened last month that Democrats, licking their
wounds after Reagan's landslide re-election, have
seized political initiative on a major issue and
thrown the Republicans on the defensive.
Their move was especially painful for Dole, who
faces re-election in wheat-growing Kansas in 1986
but must fight a filibuster that directly challenges
his reputation as a skilled legislative manager — a
major factor in his election as majority leader.
He was facing additional embarrassment in that
some of his Republican farm-state colleagues were
supporting the Democratic filibuster, at least tem
porarily.
Dole lost little time, however, in trying to regain
the initiative on the issue.

Accusing Democrats of "posturing on the farm
crisis," Dole said, "If they want to work it out, it's
one thing. If they want to play politics, we can do
that, too."
In a series of meetings with farm-state
Republicans and Agriculture Secretary John Block,
GOP lawmakers attempted to extract enough ad
ministration concessions to put together a relief
package that would break the filibuster and win
Senate approval.
Some Republicans said the strategy was to devise
a Republican compromise to resolve the problem,
thereby relegating Democrats to the wings again.
"There's no reason these fellows who are
grandstanding should get all the credit," said Sen.
Thad Cochran (R-Miss.), chairman of the Senate
Appropriations subcommittee dealing with
agriculture and related agencies.
But as evening approached, Dole and Block
began meeting separately with members of both
parties. Sen. David Boren (D-Okla.), leading the
filibuster, shrugged off the political implications,
saying that, if politics determines the outcome, "I'll
say 'Hallelujah,' and we'll shut this thing down and
go on to the Meese nomination."
As he headed for this third round of meetings.
Dole said he was optimistic about a settlement that
would match or exceed the legislation moving
through the House.
Late yesterday, it was not clear whether the ef
fort would succeed. At a mid-afternoon meeting.
Block assured senators that existing operating-loan
obligations would be met, which appeared to pacify
at least some of the Republicans.

Still to t>e resolved were loan guarantees to allow
farmers to refinance debts at lower rates, relaxation
of conditions for the guarantees, advance payment
of price-support money and other protections for
thousands of farmers threatened with foreclosure
as they face the customary financial squeeze of
early spring.
Unless there is agreement. Dole said yesterday,
the Senate should be prepared to meet "tonight,
tomorrow, Friday and Saturday." He also warned
that, until the Meese vote, no action will be taken
on a long-delayed $7 billion highway-construction
bill that holds the promise of hundreds of
thousands of jobs nationwide.
Asked if he had found a solution to the impasse
in talks with the filibustered. Dole responded
heatedly, "Blackmail — that's not a solution. . . .
They (the filibusterers) don't even have a bill. They
just have a sheet of paper with points on it."
He contended that many of the proposals would
"just bail out the bankers" without helping hard
pressed farmers.
Reagan, asked during an impromptu meeting
with reporters what he thought of the filibuster,
responded, "You know what I think of it. I think
it's ridiculous."
White House spokesman Larry Speakes said
Reagan wants the Senate to act on the Meese nom
ination "promptly, on the merits," and added:
"There are the votes there to confirm Ed Meese
... the president thinks the Senate should get down
to the business of voting on Ed Meese and do so
promptly."
