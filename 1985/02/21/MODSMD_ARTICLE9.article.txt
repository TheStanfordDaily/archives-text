# Thatcher backs 'Star Wars' plan
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher yester
day seconded President Reagan's de
termination to press ahead with his
"Star Wars" research program, al
though she said the Soviet Union may
refuse to limit offensive nuclear arms
unless the United States agrees to re
strictions on the anti-missile defense
effort.
"If we are to maintain deterrence,
as we must, it is essential that our re
search and capacity do not fall behind
the work being done by the Soviet
Union," Thatcher said in a speech to
a joint session of Congress. "That is
why I firmly support President
Reagan's decision to pursue research
into defense against ballistic nuclear
missiles — the Strategic Defense Ini
tiative," as the "Star Wars" plan is
formally known.
But during a two-and-a-half hour
working lunch at the White House,
Thatcher and Reagan agreed that the
Soviets were very likely to try to link
offensive weapons talks to their effort
to block the administration's missile
defense plan when the superpowers
resume arms control talks next month
in Geneva. A senior State Depart
ment official said Thatcher used the

phrase "hold hostage" in describing
the probable linkage.
Thatcher, making her second U.S.
visit in two months, and Reagan em
phasized the close relations between
the two countries and their own per
sonal and political friendship. The
president called Thatcher "a dear
friend and respected leader" and the
prime minister said she could work
effectively with Reagan "because we
see so many things in the same way."
Thatcher became the first British
prime minister to address the U.S.
Congress since Winston Chruchill ap
peared before a joint session Jan. 17,
1952. Her speech, interrupted by ap
plause 24 times and met with a stand
ing ovation of almost three minutes at
the end, consisted largely of praise for
U.S. policy.
But despite her endorsement of re
search on anti-missile defense sys
tems, Thatcher drew a distinction be
tween research and actual deploy
ment. The United States should not
attempt to deploy the weapons with
out first engaging in a new round of
negotiations with the Soviets, she
said.
The lynchpin of the talks must be a

commitment to deterrence. "Wars
are not caused by the buildup of
weapons," Thatcher said. "They are
caused when an aggressor believes he
can achieve his objectives at an ac
ceptable price. . . . Our task is to see
that potential aggressors from
whatever quarter understand plainly
that the capacity and the resolve of
the West would deny them victory in
war, and that the price they would
pay would be intolerable.
"That is the basis of deterrence,"
she said. "It is the same whatever the
nature of the weapons. Let us never
forget the horrors of conventional
wars. . .. Our task is not to prevent
nuclear war, but conventional war as
well."
She said the nuclear balance of ter
ror has kept the peace in Europe for
almost 40 years, "one of the longest
periods without war in all our his
tory."
As Thatcher spoke, several
hundred Irish-Americans sympa
thetic with the Irish Republican
Army marched outside the Capitol,
chanting, "Brits out; peace in." While
ignoring the protesters, the prime
minister denounced the IRA and
Americans who give it financial or

political support.
"The problems of Northern Ireland
will not be solved by the assassin's
gun or bomb," she said." Be under no
illusions about the Provisional IRA.
They terrorize their own communit
ies. They are the enemies of
democracy — and of freedom too."
If a majority of the citizens of
Northern Ireland wanted to cut their
links to Britain, she said, "I believe
that our Parliament would respond
accordingly."
Although the emphasis throughout
Thatcher's brief visit was on agree
ments between her and Reagan, the
prime minister chided the United
States for its budget deficit, high in
terest rates and the soaring value of
the dollar, which she said creates
problems for governments around the
world.
In her talks with Reagan and with
other administration officials,
Thatcher called for a gradual decline
in dollar values, arguing that a rapid
decline would cause almost as many
problems for the world economy as
the present strength of the U.S. cur
rency, the senior State Department
official said.

peared before a joint session Jan. 17,
1952. Her speech, interrupted by ap
plause 24 times and met with a stand
ing ovation of almost three minutes at
the end, consisted largely of praise for
U.S. policy.
But despite her endorsement of re
search on anti-missile defense sys
tems, Thatcher drew a distinction be
tween research and actual deploy
ment. The United States should not
attempt to deploy the weapons with
out first engaging in a new round of
negotiations with the Soviets, she
said.
The lynchpin of the talks must be a

commitment to deterrence. "Wars
are not caused by the buildup of
weapons," Thatcher said. "They are
caused when an aggressor believes he
can achieve his objectives at an ac
ceptable price. . . . Our task is to see
that potential aggressors from
whatever quarter understand plainly
that the capacity and the resolve of
the West would deny them victory in
war, and that the price they would
pay would be intolerable.
"That is the basis of deterrence,"
she said. "It is the same whatever the
nature of the weapons. Let us never
forget the horrors of conventional
wars. . .. Our task is not to prevent
nuclear war, but conventional war as
well."
She said the nuclear balance of ter
ror has kept the peace in Europe for
almost 40 years, "one of the longest
periods without war in all our his
tory."
As Thatcher spoke, several
hundred Irish-Americans sympa
thetic with the Irish Republican
Army marched outside the Capitol,
chanting, "Brits out; peace in." While
ignoring the protesters, the prime
minister denounced the IRA and
Americans who give it financial or

political support.
"The problems of Northern Ireland
will not be solved by the assassin's
gun or bomb," she said." Be under no
illusions about the Provisional IRA.
They terrorize their own communit
ies. They are the enemies of
democracy — and of freedom too."
If a majority of the citizens of
Northern Ireland wanted to cut their
links to Britain, she said, "I believe
that our Parliament would respond
accordingly."
Although the emphasis throughout
Thatcher's brief visit was on agree
ments between her and Reagan, the
prime minister chided the United
States for its budget deficit, high in
terest rates and the soaring value of
the dollar, which she said creates
problems for governments around the
world.
In her talks with Reagan and with
other administration officials,
Thatcher called for a gradual decline
in dollar values, arguing that a rapid
decline would cause almost as many
problems for the world economy as
the present strength of the U.S. cur
rency, the senior State Department
official said.
