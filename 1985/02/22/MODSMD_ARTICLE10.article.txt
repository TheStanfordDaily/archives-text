Farm agreement fizzles
WASHINGTON — A tentative agreement be
tween the Reagan administration and Farm Belt
senators to provide emergency credit relief for
farmers fizzled last night when Senate Democrats
refused to go along with it.
The impasse meant a continuation of the
Democratic-led filibuster that has held up the
confirmation vote on Attorney General
designate Edwin Meese 111 for two days.
Senate Democrats said they objected to the
adequacy of the credit relief program and to a
letter from Agriculture Secretary John Block
spelling out the administration's position. They
called it "insulting," "bush league" and
"provocative."
They complained that the letter should have
come from President Reagan rather than Block
and protested that it failed to recognize the bi
partisan nature of the agreement, saying it imp
lied instead that the administration alone was re
sponsible for liberalizing farm credit.
Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-Kan.)
said he would continue to try to work out an
agreement with the Democrats to end the
filibuster on Meese and pass a farm relief bill and
vowed to keep the Senate in session into the
weekend if necessary to break the impasse.
"Every day that we waste here is another day
the farmers aren't going to get relief or the bank
ers. . . Dole said, adding that "the question is
whether we want to get some relief or whether
we want to get into a partisan wrangle on the first
issue of the year." Said Sen. Joseph Biden (D-
Del.) of the filibuster organizers: "They're ready
to go to the wall. There's absolute unanimity that
they're not going to yield the filibuster absent
many more concessions from the administra
tion."

The accord was hammered out in 24 hours of
behind-the-scenes negotiations between farm
state senators of both parties and Secretary
Block, with the Senate Republican leadership
acting as mediators.
It was aimed largely at encouraging banks,
through expanded loan guarantees and other
provisions, to participate in existing credit-aid
programs.
Senate Democrats objected to Block's asser
tion in the letter.that the administration would
"oppose any additional legislation because it is
unnecessary and would harm farmers by delaying
implementation of our programs."
In addition to yesterday's assurances, many of
the Democrats said they want congressional ac
tion on more far-reaching legislation, such as a
bill approved yesterday by the House Agriculture
Committee that, among other things, would ad
vance payment of farm price-support loans.
The House farm credit bill, which is expected
to reach the floor next Wednesday, is estimated
by Agriculture Department officials to cost be
tween $1.6 billion and $9 billion over the next
two years, depending on whether farmers can
repay the loans.
Sanctuary workers tried
HOUSTON — Two members of the church
sanctuary movement accused of smuggling Sal
vadoran aliens into the United States were con
victed by a federal jury yesterday, but both
vowed to continue their refugee work even in the
face of possible long-term jail sentences.
Jack Elder, 41, and Stacey Lynn Merkt, 30,
were convicted after four hours of jury delibera
tion. Elder was found guilty on six counts of il
legally transporting aliens. Merkt was convicted
of conspiracy to smuggle the refugees into the

country.
Elder and Merkt said that they were shocked
at the verdict but will continue to work at Casa
Oscar Romero, a San Benito, Texas, shelter for
Central Americans funded by the Catholic
Church.
"I expected to be judged by a jury of my
peers," Elder said. "That did not happen."
Merkt was more emphatic. "It's inconceivable
to me to me that I'm convicted when I am inno
cent."
The two were found guilty after the prosecu
tion called only one witness who identified them
as persons who helped Salvadorans enter the
country illegally. The witness, Salvadoran Jose
Mendez-Valle, said that both helped him and
several other aliens across the border. But he also
testified that border agents told him that he could
visit relatives in the United States if he
cooperated with the investigation.
Merkt faces a maximum of five years in prison
and a $10,000 fine. She was already on probation
for a similar conviction last May. At the time,
Judge Filemon Vela, who also presided over this
week's trial, said that she would be jailed if she
ever came before him again.
Elder, who was acquitted in Corpus Christi last
month in another refugee case, could be given a
30-year prison sentence and a $28,000 fine. Sen
tencing was set for March 27.
Stocks decline
The stock market declined broadly yesterday,
yielding to the pressure of rising interest rates.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up
2.54 on Wednesday, dropped 4.09 to 1,279.04.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange
slowed to 104.02 million shares from 118.21 mil
lion Wednesday.
