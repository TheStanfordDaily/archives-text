Shultz cites cooperation
SAN FRANCISCO — Emerging economic
cooperation among the market-oriented nations
of the Pacific Basin has brought the region to the
verge of a "new era of reconciliation, progress
and peace," Secretary of State George Shultz
said last night.
In a speech prepared for the newly formed
U.S. National Committee for Pacific Economic
Cooperation, Shultz said it is not yet clear what
form Asian cooperation will take. But the United
States is prepared to play a major role, he said —
although it does not seek to control the process.
"The Pacific cooperative process is still in its
infancy, and it is too early to predict its ultimate
form or direction," Shultz said. "The United
States has no preconceived notion as to how this
process should continue or where it may ulti
mately lead."
"In the Pacific today there is a new reality,
though the world may not fully comprehend it,"

he said. "The Pacific region has rapidly emerged
as a leading force on the world stage."
To he sure, the region faces some severe prob
lems, both social and military. "The slow growth
of political liberalization could set back Asia's
hard-won successes," he said.
Senate 'repairs' lottery
SACRAMENTO — The Senate gave over
whelming approval yesterday to a state lottery
"repair bill" that would reduce disclosure re
quirements in hopes of setting off a lucrative bid
ding war among potential lottery suppliers.
Sen. Ralph Dills (D-Gardena) said he hoped
his proposal would result in suppliers' contracts
that leave more lottery proceeds "for schools and
bettors."
He said the bill, sent to the Assembly on a 33-1
vote, "makes the bidding process available to

more than one or perhaps two bidders."
Dills' measure, 5835, would ease disclosure
requirements for officials and stockholders of
companies and parent corporations that want to
bid on contracts to supply tickets and computer
ized equipment for the games.
The lottery initiative approved by California
voters last November requires top officials and
major owners of bidding companies and their
parent companies to disclose detailed financial
information, including their income tax state
ments.
Dills' bill would allow the new Lottery Com
mission to decide exactly how much information
a bidder would have to disclose.
