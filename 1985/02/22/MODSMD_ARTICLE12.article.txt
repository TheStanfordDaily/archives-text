## Senators explain lack of knowledge on ASSU 
### JOYA WESLEY Staff writer 
Although certain ASSU events —
such as the recent attempt by the
Council of Presidents to recall Senate
Chair Eric Berg — receive broad
media coverage, the bulk of its activi
ties remain a mystery to most mem
bers of the student body. Because
most of its functions are routine and
not particularly interesting, few stu
dents venture to explore the intricate
structure of the organization which
handles almost a million dollars of
student money each year.
Berg feels this lack of knowledge
and interest is not unique to the
ASSU. Students, he said, have as
little knowledge about such structures
as the Faculty Senate and the Board
of Trustees as they have about the
ASSU.
"It's just not something that at
tracts a lot of attention," Berg said.
Because the routine functions of the
ASSU do not receive much attention,
those events that are widely
publicized are taken out of propor
tion and out of context by the stu
dents, he said.
"They only see us when we do
something controversial or foolish,"
he said. Because of this, students of
ten don't understand many of the
senate's purposes in making its deci
sions, according to Berg.
Often the media, and consequently
the student body, misunderstand the
senate's intentions, either because
they were poorly communicated or
poorly received. Berg said.
"The kind of image that comes
across may not be contingent with
what's actually happening," Berg
said.
In addition to the uninteresting na
ture of some of the important work
the ASSU does, Berg also stresses the
complexity of the ASSU's structure

as a factor in students' lack of infor
mation.
Because the scale of the ASSU has
grown — it now collects just under
$700,000 each year — the organiza-r
tion has necessarily become more
complicated, Berg said. He thus feels
that accusations that the ASSU is too
bureaucratic should, be put into this
context.
"You can't be casual about some
thing that adds up to a million dol
lars, Berg said, including in his sum
the ASSU's operating budget of
$260,000.
Aside from the financial aspects of
the ASSU, it also interests itself with
student representation and the
protection of student rights.
Graduate Senator Mark Landesmann
echoes Berg's opinions, saying ASSU
business is "useful, but not interest
ing."
Landesmann explained that during
the late '60s and early '70s the ASSU
was more instrumental in focusing on
socio-political issues than it is now.
Because issues of humanitarian interest

have not been as prominent in the
past four or five years, the ASSU's
representative efforts have been of a
mediocre type and therefore have not
gotten much press coverage, he said.
Landesmann hopes that the current
issues of apartheid and military re
search will bring the ASSU to the
forefront once again as a
humanitarian organization.
Deputy Chair B.G. Porter sees a
lack of knowledge about the ASSU,
but not a lack of interest.
"I don't think that students are
apathetic about it,"he said. Because
the system is so intricate, students see
only the external part and don't know
all the services the ASSU offers, he
said.
Porter cites the representative
functions of the ASSU among the
under-publicized services. "It's the

only voice students have in the Uni
versity," he said.
Porter and Berg have been in
volved in finding ways to inform stu
dents about the ASSU. Among their
efforts have been informational
meetings, newsletters and dorm out
reach programs.
"I think a first step towards in
creasing student awareness should be
to have The Daily and the ASSU
work together," Porter said, noting
that he would like to see better rela
tions between the two parties.
Last week, the ASSU held an in
formational meeting about business
and financial positions, and one last
night about running for ASSU
offices. Last night's meeting will
probably be repeated in order to
reach a larger portion of the student
body.
Also, the ASSU has experimented
over the past couple of years with
various publications. Two years ago,
it published the "ASSU Correspon
dent," a monthly tabloid. The
"ASSU News," a bi-quarterly

newsletter, has since replaced it.
Other formats, such as regular ad
vertisements in The Daily and a
registration-pack type of publication,
are being considered.
"We're always interested in finding
more ways to get information
across," Berg said.
A final method used by the ASSU
to communicate information to stu
dents is a program in which under
graduate senators visit house
meetings twice a month to report
ASSU news and to answer students'
questions.

but not a lack of interest.
"I don't think that students are
apathetic about it,"he said. Because
the system is so intricate, students see
only the external part and don't know
all the services the ASSU offers, he
said.
Porter cites the representative
functions of the ASSU among the
under-publicized services. "It's the

only voice students have in the Uni
versity," he said.
Porter and Berg have been in
volved in finding ways to inform stu
dents about the ASSU. Among their
efforts have been informational
meetings, newsletters and dorm out
reach programs.
"I think a first step towards in
creasing student awareness should be
to have The Daily and the ASSU
work together," Porter said, noting
that he would like to see better rela
tions between the two parties.
Last week, the ASSU held an in
formational meeting about business
and financial positions, and one last
night about running for ASSU
offices. Last night's meeting will
probably be repeated in order to
reach a larger portion of the student
body.
Also, the ASSU has experimented
over the past couple of years with
various publications. Two years ago,
it published the "ASSU Correspon
dent," a monthly tabloid. The
"ASSU News," a bi-quarterly

newsletter, has since replaced it.
Other formats, such as regular ad
vertisements in The Daily and a
registration-pack type of publication,
are being considered.
"We're always interested in finding
more ways to get information
across," Berg said.
A final method used by the ASSU
to communicate information to stu
dents is a program in which under
graduate senators visit house
meetings twice a month to report
ASSU news and to answer students'
questions.

Although certain ASSU events —
such as the recent attempt by the
Council of Presidents to recall Senate
Chair Eric Berg — receive broad
media coverage, the bulk of its activi
ties remain a mystery to most mem
bers of the student body. Because
most of its functions are routine and
not particularly interesting, few stu
dents venture to explore the intricate
structure of the organization which
handles almost a million dollars of
student money each year.
Berg feels this lack of knowledge
and interest is not unique to the
ASSU. Students, he said, have as
little knowledge about such structures
as the Faculty Senate and the Board
of Trustees as they have about the
ASSU.
"It's just not something that at
tracts a lot of attention," Berg said.
Because the routine functions of the
ASSU do not receive much attention,
those events that are widely
publicized are taken out of propor
tion and out of context by the stu
dents, he said.
"They only see us when we do
something controversial or foolish,"
he said. Because of this, students of
ten don't understand many of the
senate's purposes in making its deci
sions, according to Berg.
Often the media, and consequently
the student body, misunderstand the
senate's intentions, either because
they were poorly communicated or
poorly received. Berg said.
"The kind of image that comes
across may not be contingent with
what's actually happening," Berg
said.
In addition to the uninteresting na
ture of some of the important work
the ASSU does, Berg also stresses the
complexity of the ASSU's structure

as a factor in students' lack of infor
mation.
Because the scale of the ASSU has
grown — it now collects just under
$700,000 each year — the organiza-r
tion has necessarily become more
complicated, Berg said. He thus feels
that accusations that the ASSU is too
bureaucratic should, be put into this
context.
"You can't be casual about some
thing that adds up to a million dol
lars, Berg said, including in his sum
the ASSU's operating budget of
$260,000.
Aside from the financial aspects of
the ASSU, it also interests itself with
student representation and the
protection of student rights.
Graduate Senator Mark Landesmann
echoes Berg's opinions, saying ASSU
business is "useful, but not interest
ing."
Landesmann explained that during
the late '60s and early '70s the ASSU
was more instrumental in focusing on
socio-political issues than it is now.
Because issues of humanitarian interest

have not been as prominent in the
past four or five years, the ASSU's
representative efforts have been of a
mediocre type and therefore have not
gotten much press coverage, he said.
Landesmann hopes that the current
issues of apartheid and military re
search will bring the ASSU to the
forefront once again as a
humanitarian organization.
