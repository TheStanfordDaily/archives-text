## The 						Stanford Daily Divestment indeed 
### 
Last week. Secretary of Education William
Bennett performed wonders in reviving the
memory of Marie Antoinette. Antoinette never
actually said, "Let them eat cake," but Bennett
did the next best thing.
A week ago Monday, Bennett defended the
Reagan administration's proposal to curb federal
loan guarantees for college students by saying
that it would only force students to make certain
divestments. He termed it a "divestiture of cer
tain sorts: stereo divestiture, automobile
divestiture, three-weeks-at-the-beach di
vestiture."
Bennett further questioned the need for so
many people to go to college and accused the
education system of falling short of its expecta
tions, claiming colleges "are not delivering on
their promises."
It is apparent that significant changes are going
to be made as far as government support for edu
cation is concerned. The Reagan administration
is bent on cutting back aid to students and trying
to make colleges cut waste.
Some members of academia accept that fact.
At hearings held by Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San

Mateo), Robert Freelen, Stanford's vice presi
dent for Public Affairs, suggested possible
changes that would reduce government expendi
tures and also ease the effects on students.
But as a spokesman for this effort, Bennett
may be creating problems before the administra
tion even gets started.
Bennett's statements not only alienate the
people he is supposed to represent, but also
create a combative atmosphere between the ad
ministration and academia. "It certainly would
hurt us if this is a sneak preview of what the next
four years holds for us," said Bill McNamara,
communications director for the National Associ
ation of Independent Colleges and Universities.
That atmosphere must be broken down
for the two sides to work together. Bennett
must realize that academia is willing to work to
tighten the belt on spending, as long as the belt is
not around its neck.
Bennett must realize that his actions should not
be reminiscent of Antoinette's, whose lack of
compassion and understanding contributed to an
unfortunate meeting between her neck and a
guillotine.
