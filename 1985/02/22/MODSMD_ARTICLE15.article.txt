## A 						defense of the Palestinian state 
### 
I would like to thank the editors of
The Daily for the forum they have
provided recently for the expression
of different viewpoints on the Middle
East conflict. Hopefully, the heat of
the debate will not cause them to ter
minate it prematurely. The elements
of a compromise may very well
emerge as the respective positions are

VIEWPOINT

clarified. I take this opportunity to
respond to some of the points raised
in Bunzel and Nosanchuk's viewpoint
(The Daily, Feb. 13). The object of
the article was to establish that the
PLO is a terrorist organization which
"rejects the need for a compromise
solution," and to defend Col.
Menahem Milson — former adminis
trator of the Israeli-occupied West
Bank and currently visiting at Hoover
— against charges made in John
Rosenblum's Feb. 6 viewpoint.
Bunzel and Nosanchuk devote al
most half their viewpoint to
documenting PLO violence, yet a
number of actions they attribute to
the PLO were carried out by other
parties. For example, the bombing of
synagogues in Europe is known to be
the responsibility of a group led by a
man expelled from the PLO many
years ago. Issam Sartawi's assassina
tion was also carried out by this Abu
Nidal group. (Flora Lewis of The
New York Times made the charge
that the PLO leadership was behind
the killing, but had to retract it soon
after.)
However, the main point to be
made here is that violence as such is
not a dimension along which the two
sides in the Middle East conflict can
•be distinguished. The Deir Yassin
of 250 civilians by Menac
'hem Begin's Irgun just prior to the
•creation of Israel is just one example
)from the other side. Another more
•recent one is the invasion of
► Ixbanon, which led to the death of an
19,000 people. If anything,
has the undoubted, though
distinction of having caused
*a greater number of deaths, both mil
itary and civilian. Without necessarily
justifying PLO violence, it needs to
be recalled that the Palestinians were
rendered homeless by the creation of

Israel. The cycle of violence — shell
ing of Israeli settlements and bomb
ing of Palestinian refugee camps —
has to be viewed against this histori
cal background.
Bunzel and Nosanchuk's purpose
in claiming the PLO killed Sartawi is
to demonstrate that Palestinians who
want negotiations with Israel tend to
get bumped off, Mafia-style, and that
the PLO is not a democratic institu
tion which would allow the airing of
positions at odds with its own intran
sigent ones. But if the mainstream
PLO leadership rejects compromise,

Without necessarily justifying PLO
violence, it needs to be recalled that
the Palestinians were rendered home
less by the creation of Israel.

it is difficult to account for the
Arafat-Hussein talks in Amman, or
to explain Arafat's declaration at the
conference of non-aligned nations in
New Delhi that the PLO is ready to
exchange recognition of Israel for an
independent Palestinian state on the
West Bank and Gaza. And if the PLO
were as undemocratic as Bunzel and
Nosanchuk make out, there would
have been no reason for the meeting
of the delegates of the Palestine Na
tional Council to vote on Arafat's
platform. It is quite immaterial that
the delegates are not elected in a for
mal election like members of the Is
raeli Knesset — the World Zionist
Organization had no popular elec
tions before a state was created.
The group Bunzel and Nosanchuk
believe represents the Palestinians of
the West Bank is the Israeli-created
Village Leagues. Actually the
Leagues are virtually defunct and are
viewed by West Bankers as col
laborators with the occupation. Ac
cording to a Time magazine poll, they
receive the support of no more than
0.2 percent of the population. In light
of the fact that the Leagues were
created to bypass the popularly
elected West Bank mayors sympa
thetic to the PLO, it seems that Bun

zel and Nosanchuk's attachment to
the principle of democratic represen
tation is rather selective.
The defense of Milson's removal of
these mayors is perhaps the most in
teresting part of Bunzel and
Nosanchuk's article. The fact that the
Israeli Supreme Court did not
criticize him is supposed to show Mil
son's "deep respect for the law." It is,
however, patently clear that justifying
the actions of an administrator of oc
cupied territories with decisions of
the courts of the occupying power is,
let us say, tendentious. Bunzel and

Nosanchuk do not leave it at that and
quickly get down to basics: The
removal of the elected mayors is n6w v
justified because it resulted in the
"calmest period in the history of the
Israeli-occupied West Bank." Can
this be anything other than a
pleasant-sounding euphemism for,
"Eliminate the resistance to the occu
pation, and let democracy go to the
devil"? For the record, what actually
followed were widespread
demonstrations and violent clashes
with the Israeli army.
It is not necessary to go over the
unedifying details of Milson's admin
istration of the West Bank. Those in
terested are referred to Rosenblum's
original viewpoint, which has yet to
receive a rebuttal. Bunzel and
Nosanchuk's attempt contains mis
statements of fact and inconsis
tencies, some of which I have
mentioned. But Bunzel and
Nosanchuk border on the ridiculous
when they wax poetic on how "into
the West Bank rode Menahem Mil
son." Those on the West Bank have
made it sufficiently clear that they do
not think that he, or the soldiers and
the settlers, have any business there
— on horseback or in armored
vehicles.

For all the accusations regarding
the PLO's purported rejection of
compromise, Bunzel and Nosanchuk
provide little information on what Is
rael is offering the PLO, short of
complete capitulation. Israel has
rejected the Fez Peace Plan, which
calls for security guarantees for all
states in the region, including an in
dependent Palestinian state on the
West Bank and Gaza. The PLO was
actually involved in drafting the text
of the plan.
The PLO's rejection of the Camp
David accords is based on the fact
that the "autonomy plan" for the oc
cupied territories gives Israel veto
power over their future. It is not
equivalent to a refusal to look for a
middle ground. Leaders of Israel's
Labor Alignment, with whom Bunzel
and Nosanchuk seem to identify,
have stated that they would retain
control over 60 percent of the West
Bank, hardly a compromise when it is
remembered that this leaves only a
part of a part of historical Palestine
for the Palestinians. Perhaps Bunzel
and Nosanchuk would care to write a
non-polemical piece detailing what
they think a just and viable compro
mise would entail. (And perhaps The
Daily would be kind enough to print
it.)

John Rosenblum, an Israeli student
at Stanford, has suggested what he
believes a compromise involves and
he has also been willing to discuss this
with Palestinian and other Arab stu
dents. Bunzel and Nosanchuk's
charged reaction to his article reveals
a sentiment similar to what lies be
hind the case of the two Knesset
members who met with PLO leaders
a couple of weeks ago and now face
the possibility of legal action begin
taken against them. Bunzel and
Nosanchuk dismiss John Rosenblum
as a "PLO supporter," as if that
settled anything. He has taken a prin
cipled position on the occupation and
the national rights of the Palestinians;
and he advocates a solution that does
not trample over either side of the
conflict. Writing him off as an enemy
is supposed to be what the PLO does
to Palestinians who suggest compro
mise.

Menahem Milson — former adminis
trator of the Israeli-occupied West
Bank and currently visiting at Hoover
— against charges made in John
Rosenblum's Feb. 6 viewpoint.
Bunzel and Nosanchuk devote al
most half their viewpoint to
documenting PLO violence, yet a
number of actions they attribute to
the PLO were carried out by other
parties. For example, the bombing of
synagogues in Europe is known to be
the responsibility of a group led by a
man expelled from the PLO many
years ago. Issam Sartawi's assassina
tion was also carried out by this Abu
Nidal group. (Flora Lewis of The
New York Times made the charge
that the PLO leadership was behind
the killing, but had to retract it soon
after.)
However, the main point to be
made here is that violence as such is
not a dimension along which the two
sides in the Middle East conflict can
•be distinguished. The Deir Yassin
of 250 civilians by Menac
'hem Begin's Irgun just prior to the
•creation of Israel is just one example
)from the other side. Another more
•recent one is the invasion of
► Ixbanon, which led to the death of an
19,000 people. If anything,
has the undoubted, though
distinction of having caused
*a greater number of deaths, both mil
itary and civilian. Without necessarily
justifying PLO violence, it needs to
be recalled that the Palestinians were
rendered homeless by the creation of

Israel. The cycle of violence — shell
ing of Israeli settlements and bomb
ing of Palestinian refugee camps —
has to be viewed against this histori
cal background.
Bunzel and Nosanchuk's purpose
in claiming the PLO killed Sartawi is
to demonstrate that Palestinians who
want negotiations with Israel tend to
get bumped off, Mafia-style, and that
the PLO is not a democratic institu
tion which would allow the airing of
positions at odds with its own intran
sigent ones. But if the mainstream
PLO leadership rejects compromise,

Without necessarily justifying PLO
violence, it needs to be recalled that
the Palestinians were rendered home

it is difficult to account for the
Arafat-Hussein talks in Amman, or
to explain Arafat's declaration at the
conference of non-aligned nations in
New Delhi that the PLO is ready to
exchange recognition of Israel for an
independent Palestinian state on the
West Bank and Gaza. And if the PLO
were as undemocratic as Bunzel and
Nosanchuk make out, there would
have been no reason for the meeting
of the delegates of the Palestine Na
tional Council to vote on Arafat's
platform. It is quite immaterial that
the delegates are not elected in a for
mal election like members of the Is
raeli Knesset — the World Zionist
Organization had no popular elec
tions before a state was created.
The group Bunzel and Nosanchuk
believe represents the Palestinians of
the West Bank is the Israeli-created
Village Leagues. Actually the
Leagues are virtually defunct and are
viewed by West Bankers as col
laborators with the occupation. Ac
cording to a Time magazine poll, they
receive the support of no more than
0.2 percent of the population. In light
of the fact that the Leagues were
created to bypass the popularly
elected West Bank mayors sympa
thetic to the PLO, it seems that Bun

zel and Nosanchuk's attachment to
the principle of democratic represen
tation is rather selective.
The defense of Milson's removal of
these mayors is perhaps the most in
teresting part of Bunzel and
Nosanchuk's article. The fact that the
Israeli Supreme Court did not
criticize him is supposed to show Mil
son's "deep respect for the law." It is,
however, patently clear that justifying
the actions of an administrator of oc
cupied territories with decisions of
the courts of the occupying power is,
let us say, tendentious. Bunzel and

Nosanchuk do not leave it at that and
quickly get down to basics: The
removal of the elected mayors is n6w v
justified because it resulted in the
"calmest period in the history of the
Israeli-occupied West Bank." Can
this be anything other than a
pleasant-sounding euphemism for,
"Eliminate the resistance to the occu
pation, and let democracy go to the
devil"? For the record, what actually
followed were widespread
demonstrations and violent clashes
with the Israeli army.
It is not necessary to go over the
unedifying details of Milson's admin
istration of the West Bank. Those in
terested are referred to Rosenblum's
original viewpoint, which has yet to
receive a rebuttal. Bunzel and
Nosanchuk's attempt contains mis
statements of fact and inconsis
tencies, some of which I have
mentioned. But Bunzel and
Nosanchuk border on the ridiculous
when they wax poetic on how "into
the West Bank rode Menahem Mil
son." Those on the West Bank have
made it sufficiently clear that they do
not think that he, or the soldiers and
the settlers, have any business there
— on horseback or in armored
vehicles.

For all the accusations regarding
the PLO's purported rejection of
compromise, Bunzel and Nosanchuk
provide little information on what Is
rael is offering the PLO, short of
complete capitulation. Israel has
rejected the Fez Peace Plan, which
calls for security guarantees for all
states in the region, including an in
dependent Palestinian state on the
West Bank and Gaza. The PLO was
actually involved in drafting the text
of the plan.
The PLO's rejection of the Camp
David accords is based on the fact
that the "autonomy plan" for the oc
cupied territories gives Israel veto
power over their future. It is not
equivalent to a refusal to look for a
middle ground. Leaders of Israel's
Labor Alignment, with whom Bunzel
and Nosanchuk seem to identify,
have stated that they would retain
control over 60 percent of the West
Bank, hardly a compromise when it is
remembered that this leaves only a
part of a part of historical Palestine
for the Palestinians. Perhaps Bunzel
and Nosanchuk would care to write a
non-polemical piece detailing what
they think a just and viable compro
mise would entail. (And perhaps The
Daily would be kind enough to print
it.)

John Rosenblum, an Israeli student
at Stanford, has suggested what he
believes a compromise involves and
he has also been willing to discuss this
with Palestinian and other Arab stu
dents. Bunzel and Nosanchuk's
charged reaction to his article reveals
a sentiment similar to what lies be
hind the case of the two Knesset
members who met with PLO leaders
a couple of weeks ago and now face
the possibility of legal action begin
taken against them. Bunzel and
Nosanchuk dismiss John Rosenblum
as a "PLO supporter," as if that
settled anything. He has taken a prin
cipled position on the occupation and
the national rights of the Palestinians;
and he advocates a solution that does
not trample over either side of the
conflict. Writing him off as an enemy
is supposed to be what the PLO does
to Palestinians who suggest compro
mise.
