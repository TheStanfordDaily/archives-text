Annoying bug
A wise man once said it is better
for one to remain silent and let the
world wonder if he is a fool than to
open his mouth and remove all
doubt. The moral of this, of course,
is think before you speak. I am refer
ring to the unfortunate statement
made in last Tuesday's Daily in the
"Bug Me" column.
In the last Column the writer
states, "Actually operators are really
very polite while they spend 10
minutes deciding that they don't
know the answer to your question."
It is surprising how rude, insecure
and uninformed people can be when
talking over the phone with someone
they can't see. But let's get back now
to the first column, where a silly
question is asked. The answer is, "I
don't know the answer, I couldn't
find the answer, I couldn't make up
an answer and I don't care if there is
an answer. How's that for guilt." The
last sentence should more correctly
read, "How's that for an attempt at
cutsie, sarcastic, wet-nosed humor."
We are grateful we have no one with
that sort of attitude working in our
office.
There are seven information
providing desks in our office which
are filled throughout the day and at
peak time average about 125 calls an
hour each. Our staff includes people
who have been with the University
for years and are knowledgeable and
do care about helping people with
their questions. Our students arrive
late in the afternoon and work
evenings and weekends. They are
smart, sensible people who do their
work diligently and are a pleasure to
have around. We have new people
occasionally, but they are carefully

chosen, willing to learn and
cooperative.
Now about our new phone system,
to answer another question. A $20
million new system does not happen
overnight. The best system and time
has come and we will have it very
shortly. We are all looking forward
to it. No doubt, though, within the
next 20 years, someone will write in,
"How can the best school in the
country have such an archaic phone
system?" New and better systems are
developed faster than they can be
installed. In the meantime, hang in
there, Marilyn. However, in the
future, if you should ever need a job
(and it can happen to anyone),
please look elsewhere for employ
ment. You just don't meet the re
quirements for our office. We
consider only people who care.
Baby, you've got a lot to learn and a
long way to go!

An excellent example of misuse of
the press is the printing of Jason
Matherly's most recent colummn
(The Daily, Feb. 20). His words
deserved none of the space they
received, and showed the potential
for public abuse at the hands of
misguided media. Matherly at
tempted to trivialize the work of
groups supporting the liberation
struggle of oppressed black people in
South Africa. All that Matherly
succeeded in demonstrating was that
racism and insensitivity are alive and
well at Stanford as well as in South
Africa.
