# He's bonkers about Yonkers
## 
### 
During Brother Jim's recent ramblings in White
Plaza, I was witness to a scene that amused me
greatly. After being outshone by a Stanford stu
dent. Jim requested from his victorious counterpart
the remainder of the quotation that had ridiculed
him. After she complied willingly, Jim extended his
congratulations and attempted to present her with
the "grand prize," Jim's very own life story. The
student, in return, was not entirely enthused with
her reward, and refused it with jocularity.
It is with this general type of frivolity that I am
faced each time I even mention my place of origin:
Yonkers, N Y.
Now granted, we cannot all come from Palm
Springs, and many of us do get mocked at for little
trivialities that our hometown may be known for
(e.g. San Francisco: homosexuality: Cleveland:
filth and pollution; Albuquerque: complete noth
ingness). However, the majority of us are not
faced with near hysteria at the mere mention of the
name.
To begin with, we current inhabitants of Yonkers
had no part in the naming of our city, but instead
can thank the Dutch for this dubious honor. And
even though its pronounciation may sound rather
ridiculous to those of you unfamiliar with the
Dutch language (I've been told it sounds like a
duck noise), with a little practice it can flow from
you lips with relative ease. No kidding!
This is particularly true for we New Yorkers who
also must put up with other such remarkable names
as Poughkecpsie. Flushing. Bronx. Rye. Tuckahoe
and my all-time favorite, Schenectady. However,
similarly amusing names can be found throughout
this country: Boise, Ann Arbor and Honolulu to
name a few. and even in this beloved state of Cali

fornia — Huron, Yuba City, Los (iatos and
Cucamunga — are some of the prime culprits.
Indeed, it cannot be the name alone that is the
prime source of all this unwarranted laughter.
Another reason for the response that is typically
encountered may be a general lack of knowledge as
to the size of our humble city. Many of you who
agree that Yonkers is not purely mythical often
believe it must be some hick town located far off in
the boonies. (Where else could they dream up such

an outrageous name?) Still others who are aware of
Yonkcrs' proximity to New York City insist it for
sure must have been incorporated into one of the
five boroughs by now. Again, these individuals are
mistaken.
Yonkers is instead an independent entity of
nearly 200,000 residents, according to the latest
census count. Its notoriety is based in part as the
setting of the Broadway musical "Hello Dolly" and
— to those of you who are really up on your trivia
— as the home of New York City's maniacal mur
derer, Son of Sam. Again, these credentials are
nothing to be laughed at.

The last topic with which I intend to deal is the
average person's misconceptions regarding New
York in general. Again this can only hinder one's
perceptions of Yonkers.
Although many New Yorkers appear to be com
municating on a different wavelength than that
which you may be accustomed to, we are in ac
tuality all members of the same breed.
In fact, most New Yorkers still put their pants on
one leg at a time, and often take them off in a
similar fashion.
Likewise, one cannot necessarily find a hotdog
stand on every New York street corner. Some cor
ners instead are inhabited by hot pretzel vendors,
and those who are most fortunate may find a corner
possessing both with little effort.
Regarding crime and violence, one really needn't
be concerned with these problems, provided the
proper precautions are taken. All this takes is some
common sense. One does not stroll aimlessly
through East Harlem at night. This is indeed like
writing your own will. One is sure to be issuing an
invitation that a hoodlum cannot refuse.
In general, all ideas that are foreign to one's
native thinking should be pondered carefully
before a decision is rendered. Just as one should
not "judge a book by its cover," one should exam
ine all those traits that an entity possesses before a
final judgement is made. Maybe with this in mind,
Yonkers can finally receive the respect for the
qualities things possess. Perhaps we can consider
these same criteria in our critical analysis of
Brother Jim.
