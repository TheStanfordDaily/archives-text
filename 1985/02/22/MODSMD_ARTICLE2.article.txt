# Card stomps USC — again
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
You almost have to feel sorry for the USC
men's basketball team.
The Trojans work themselves into first place in
the Pacific 10 Conference and then they play
last-place Stanford.
And lose.
Twice.
In the same season.
Last month, Stanford beat USC in Los Angeles
by six. Last night, before 5,664 fans at Maples
Pavilion, Stanford beat USC by 21, 86-65.
"We just tried to stay calm, knowing that we're
going to have stretches when we don't run our of
fense right and get in trouble," said Cardinal
Coach Tom Davis, who popped out of the locker
room almost immediately after the game. "But
there weren't many dead spots tonight.

"Thai has to be the best we've played all year
by far."
Meanwhile, across the way, USC Coach Stan
Morrison spoke to his players for nearly 30
minutes following the loss, which cost the
Trojans a chance to take a one-game lead in the
Pac-10 race. Then, after speaking briefly with
reporters, Morrison brought his team back on the
Maples Pavilion floor for a postgame practice at
10:45 p.m.
"I think we have a legitimate reason to expect
more effort from our players," said Morrison,
whose Trojans have lost two straight to drop
their record to 16-7 overall and 10-4 in the Pac
-10. "Tonight, we didn't deserve to wear the card
inal and gold. Our problems are from the neck
U P"
Morrison abruptly ended his brief interview
session when a reporter asked him if Arizona's

loss to Oregon, which kept USC in a first-place
tie with the Wildcats, was any consolation for the
loss to Stanford.
"There's no damn consolation at all when you
lose," Morrison snapped. "The only consolation
is when you give a good effort."
Then he paused and said, "The absurdity of
that question makes me not want to talk
anymore."
There were no complaints from Davis, who
was more relieved than anything else to get a vic
tory after six straight defeats. Stanford improved
to 11-13 overall and 3-11 in the Pac-10, moving
into a ninth-place tie with Washington State.
"It's really important for them to catch a win
because they've been playing well lately," Davis

said. "It was an important win to keep their
Enthusiasm going for the rest of the season."
Stanford put together its best 20 minutes of
basketball of the year in the first half. Then it
played better in the second. All those shots
that didn't fall during the six-game losing spin
finally did. And all those shots that were fall
ing for the Cardinal's opponents finally didn't.
Stanford shot 68 percent from the floor, in
cluding 86 percent in the second half, when it
was 19-for-22. USC shot 42 percent.
Junior forward Andy Fischer led the Card
inal barrage with a career-high 22 points on
8-for-ll shooting. "We shot an outlandish
percentage tonight," Fischer said. "All those
good shots we were missing went in. I got a
few open shots early, and once you start
scoring, you want to score more."
Senior center Kent Seymour also had a
career night — 17 points on 6-for-6 shooting
— and got a broken nose in the process.
Seymour's nose had elbow sex with teammate
Earl Koberlein when the two ran into each
other with 5-39 remaining in the game.

The nose-breaking incident came just
minutes after Seymour made what KSFO-
Radio announcer Bob Murphy called "the
shot of the year." With Stanford ahead 53-48,
Seymour drove baseline, got caught behind
the basket in mid-air, and somehow looped
and scooped the ball up and in.
"I got bumped with a hip when I went up,"
Seymour said. "It probably was an ill-advised
shot, but it went in so 1 didn't look too bad."
It also was the shot that took the wind out
of USCs sails. Following Seymour's heroics, a
befuddled USC team took the ball to the
other end, missed, Seymour grabbed the
rebound and started a fast break that ended
with a layup by Fischer.
That put Stanford in front 57-48, and on
the next trip down court the Cardinal went
into Davis' famed delay game. The Roll.
"It was a nice feeling to get into The Roll,"
said Ramee, who with 12 points was the third
Cardinal in double figures. "We're a very
good free-throw shooting team, and if we get
a lead, we'll go into The Roll and make teams
foul us."

A pair of free throws and a 25-foot jumper
by USC's Ron Holmes, who scored most of
his game-high 27 points from the Mountain
Time Zone, cut Stanford's lead to 57-52. The
Trojans, however, never got closer.
After Ramee missed the front end of a one
and-one and then the first of a two-shot
charity attempt, USC was able to narrow it to
68-62 on a top-of-the-key jumper by Glenn
Smith, who scored 16 of his 20 points in the
second half.
But after two free throws by Ramee and
one by USC's Kevin Steward made it 70-63,
something funny happened. The Trojans,
conference co-leader and winners of all six of
their previous Pac-10 road games, lost their
composure.
The Trojans muffed shots, muffed free
throws, muffed passes, muffed everything.
They lost it. Meanwhile, Stanford capitalized
on USC's mistakes and turned them into free
throws and uncontested layups.
In all, the Cardinal ran off 14 straight
points and transformed what was going to be
a polite five- or six-point victory into an ugly
rout. A blowout, if you will.
"They started to get a little impatient at the
end," said Ramee, who finished with five of
Stanford's nine steals, "and they started to
throw longer passes. 1 just went for them and
got a couple. A lot of their passes were low
and easy to get to."
Take away Stanford's 14-point run in the
final two minutes, and it was a close game.
Stanford only led 31-30 at the half and USC
even held a 34-33 advantage early in the
second half. But the Cardinal scored 12 of the
next 16 points to move out to a 45-38 lead,
one it never relinquished.
As if the Pac-10 schedule planners knew
Stanford would defeat USC last night, the
Cardinal has the weekend off. Stanford
travels to Oregon State Thursday and to
Oregon a week from tomorrow before return
ing home to close out the season against
Washington and Washington State.
Card notes
In other Pac-10 action last night, Oregon beat
Arizona, Oregon State beat Arizona State
and UCLA beat Cal (for the 52nd straight
time). That left USC and Arizona tied for first
place at 10-4, Oregon State a half-game back
at 9-4, and Washington and UCLA tied for
fourth at 9-5.
Stanford's role of spoiler might not have
ended last night. Of the Cardinal's four
remaining games, two — the Oregon State
and Washington games — are against teams
still vying for the Pac-10 title.

Card notes
In other Pac-10 action last night, Oregon beat
Arizona, Oregon State beat Arizona State
and UCLA beat Cal (for the 52nd straight
time). That left USC and Arizona tied for first
place at 10-4, Oregon State a half-game back
at 9-4, and Washington and UCLA tied for
fourth at 9-5.
Stanford's role of spoiler might not have
ended last night. Of the Cardinal's four
remaining games, two — the Oregon State
and Washington games — are against teams
still vying for the Pac-10 title.

You almost have to feel sorry for the USC
men's basketball team.
The Trojans work themselves into first place in
the Pacific 10 Conference and then they play
last-place Stanford.
And lose.
Twice.
In the same season.
Last month, Stanford beat USC in Los Angeles
by six. Last night, before 5,664 fans at Maples
Pavilion, Stanford beat USC by 21, 86-65.
"We just tried to stay calm, knowing that we're
going to have stretches when we don't run our of
fense right and get in trouble," said Cardinal
Coach Tom Davis, who popped out of the locker
room almost immediately after the game. "But
there weren't many dead spots tonight.

"Thai has to be the best we've played all year
by far."
Meanwhile, across the way, USC Coach Stan
Morrison spoke to his players for nearly 30
minutes following the loss, which cost the
Trojans a chance to take a one-game lead in the
Pac-10 race. Then, after speaking briefly with
reporters, Morrison brought his team back on the
Maples Pavilion floor for a postgame practice at
10:45 p.m.
"I think we have a legitimate reason to expect
more effort from our players," said Morrison,
whose Trojans have lost two straight to drop
their record to 16-7 overall and 10-4 in the Pac
-10. "Tonight, we didn't deserve to wear the card
inal and gold. Our problems are from the neck
U P"
Morrison abruptly ended his brief interview
session when a reporter asked him if Arizona's

loss to Oregon, which kept USC in a first-place
tie with the Wildcats, was any consolation for the
loss to Stanford.
"There's no damn consolation at all when you
lose," Morrison snapped. "The only consolation
is when you give a good effort."
Then he paused and said, "The absurdity of
that question makes me not want to talk
anymore."
There were no complaints from Davis, who
was more relieved than anything else to get a vic
tory after six straight defeats. Stanford improved
to 11-13 overall and 3-11 in the Pac-10, moving
into a ninth-place tie with Washington State.
"It's really important for them to catch a win
because they've been playing well lately," Davis

said. "It was an important win to keep their
Enthusiasm going for the rest of the season."
Stanford put together its best 20 minutes of
basketball of the year in the first half. Then it
played better in the second. All those shots
that didn't fall during the six-game losing spin
finally did. And all those shots that were fall
ing for the Cardinal's opponents finally didn't.
Stanford shot 68 percent from the floor, in
cluding 86 percent in the second half, when it
was 19-for-22. USC shot 42 percent.
Junior forward Andy Fischer led the Card
inal barrage with a career-high 22 points on
8-for-ll shooting. "We shot an outlandish
percentage tonight," Fischer said. "All those
good shots we were missing went in. I got a
few open shots early, and once you start
scoring, you want to score more."
Senior center Kent Seymour also had a
career night — 17 points on 6-for-6 shooting
— and got a broken nose in the process.
Seymour's nose had elbow sex with teammate
Earl Koberlein when the two ran into each
other with 5-39 remaining in the game.

The nose-breaking incident came just
minutes after Seymour made what KSFO-
Radio announcer Bob Murphy called "the
shot of the year." With Stanford ahead 53-48,
Seymour drove baseline, got caught behind
the basket in mid-air, and somehow looped
and scooped the ball up and in.
"I got bumped with a hip when I went up,"
Seymour said. "It probably was an ill-advised
shot, but it went in so 1 didn't look too bad."
It also was the shot that took the wind out
of USCs sails. Following Seymour's heroics, a
befuddled USC team took the ball to the
other end, missed, Seymour grabbed the
rebound and started a fast break that ended
with a layup by Fischer.
That put Stanford in front 57-48, and on
the next trip down court the Cardinal went
into Davis' famed delay game. The Roll.
"It was a nice feeling to get into The Roll,"
said Ramee, who with 12 points was the third
Cardinal in double figures. "We're a very
good free-throw shooting team, and if we get
a lead, we'll go into The Roll and make teams
foul us."

A pair of free throws and a 25-foot jumper
by USC's Ron Holmes, who scored most of
his game-high 27 points from the Mountain
Time Zone, cut Stanford's lead to 57-52. The
Trojans, however, never got closer.
After Ramee missed the front end of a one
and-one and then the first of a two-shot
charity attempt, USC was able to narrow it to
68-62 on a top-of-the-key jumper by Glenn
Smith, who scored 16 of his 20 points in the
second half.
But after two free throws by Ramee and
one by USC's Kevin Steward made it 70-63,
something funny happened. The Trojans,
conference co-leader and winners of all six of
their previous Pac-10 road games, lost their
composure.
The Trojans muffed shots, muffed free
throws, muffed passes, muffed everything.
They lost it. Meanwhile, Stanford capitalized
on USC's mistakes and turned them into free
throws and uncontested layups.
In all, the Cardinal ran off 14 straight
points and transformed what was going to be
a polite five- or six-point victory into an ugly
rout. A blowout, if you will.
"They started to get a little impatient at the
end," said Ramee, who finished with five of
Stanford's nine steals, "and they started to
throw longer passes. 1 just went for them and
got a couple. A lot of their passes were low
and easy to get to."
Take away Stanford's 14-point run in the
final two minutes, and it was a close game.
Stanford only led 31-30 at the half and USC
even held a 34-33 advantage early in the
second half. But the Cardinal scored 12 of the
next 16 points to move out to a 45-38 lead,
one it never relinquished.
As if the Pac-10 schedule planners knew
Stanford would defeat USC last night, the
Cardinal has the weekend off. Stanford
travels to Oregon State Thursday and to
Oregon a week from tomorrow before return
ing home to close out the season against
Washington and Washington State.

throws and uncontested layups.
In all, the Cardinal ran off 14 straight
points and transformed what was going to be
a polite five- or six-point victory into an ugly
rout. A blowout, if you will.
"They started to get a little impatient at the
end," said Ramee, who finished with five of
Stanford's nine steals, "and they started to
throw longer passes. 1 just went for them and
got a couple. A lot of their passes were low
and easy to get to."
Take away Stanford's 14-point run in the
final two minutes, and it was a close game.
Stanford only led 31-30 at the half and USC
even held a 34-33 advantage early in the
second half. But the Cardinal scored 12 of the
next 16 points to move out to a 45-38 lead,
one it never relinquished.
As if the Pac-10 schedule planners knew
Stanford would defeat USC last night, the
Cardinal has the weekend off. Stanford
travels to Oregon State Thursday and to
Oregon a week from tomorrow before return
ing home to close out the season against
Washington and Washington State.
Card notes
In other Pac-10 action last night, Oregon beat
Arizona, Oregon State beat Arizona State
and UCLA beat Cal (for the 52nd straight
time). That left USC and Arizona tied for first
place at 10-4, Oregon State a half-game back
at 9-4, and Washington and UCLA tied for
fourth at 9-5.
Stanford's role of spoiler might not have
ended last night. Of the Cardinal's four
remaining games, two — the Oregon State
and Washington games — are against teams
still vying for the Pac-10 title.
