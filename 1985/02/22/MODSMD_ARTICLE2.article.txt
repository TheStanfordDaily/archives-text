# Card stomps USC â€” again
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
You almost have to feel sorry for the USC
men's basketball team.
The Trojans work themselves into first place in
the Pacific 10 Conference and then they play
last-place Stanford.
And lose.
Twice.
In the same season.
Last month, Stanford beat USC in Los Angeles
by six. Last night, before 5,664 fans at Maples
Pavilion, Stanford beat USC by 21, 86-65.
"We just tried to stay calm, knowing that we're
going to have stretches when we don't run our of
fense right and get in trouble," said Cardinal
Coach Tom Davis, who popped out of the locker
room almost immediately after the game. "But
there weren't many dead spots tonight.

"Thai has to be the best we've played all year
by far."
Meanwhile, across the way, USC Coach Stan
Morrison spoke to his players for nearly 30
minutes following the loss, which cost the
Trojans a chance to take a one-game lead in the
Pac-10 race. Then, after speaking briefly with
reporters, Morrison brought his team back on the
Maples Pavilion floor for a postgame practice at
10:45 p.m.
"I think we have a legitimate reason to expect
more effort from our players," said Morrison,
whose Trojans have lost two straight to drop
their record to 16-7 overall and 10-4 in the Pac
-10. "Tonight, we didn't deserve to wear the card
inal and gold. Our problems are from the neck
U P"
Morrison abruptly ended his brief interview
session when a reporter asked him if Arizona's

loss to Oregon, which kept USC in a first-place
tie with the Wildcats, was any consolation for the
loss to Stanford.
"There's no damn consolation at all when you
lose," Morrison snapped. "The only consolation
is when you give a good effort."
Then he paused and said, "The absurdity of
that question makes me not want to talk
anymore."
There were no complaints from Davis, who
was more relieved than anything else to get a vic
tory after six straight defeats. Stanford improved
to 11-13 overall and 3-11 in the Pac-10, moving
into a ninth-place tie with Washington State.
"It's really important for them to catch a win
because they've been playing well lately," Davis


USC Coach Stan Morrison was so upset with the performance of his
league-leading Trojans in last night's 86-65 loss to Stanford that

little practice.
