## Netters win NorCal team title 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
The No. 1-ranked Stanford men's tennis team
won 39 matches this week to finish first at the
39th Annual Northern California Intercollegiate
Tournament at San Jose State.
California placed second with 26 wins, followed
by Fresno State with 23, San Jose State with 17 and
Hayward State with 15.
Stanford's Jim Grabb won the singles title 7-5, 6-
2 over teammate Mark Jacobson. In doubles,
Patrick McEnroe and Derrick Rostagno of Stan
ford will play Paul Roybal and Bill Wakefield of
Fresno State today at 3 p.m. in the finals.
In the tournament, collegiate team members
from all the Bay Area schools were arranged in a
128-player ladder, with each victory scoring a point
for the player's school.
All six Stanford entrants were seeded and
received first-round byes. Grabb was seeded first,
Jacobson third, Eric Rosenfeld fourth. John Letts
fifth and Patrick McEnroe eighth.
The seedings were one indication of Stanford's
dominance in the tournament and in national col

legiate competition in general.
In the most recent Intercollegiate Tennis
Coaches Association Rankings, Stanford is the No.
1 team in the nation. In preseason polls, Stanford
was No. 2 behind UCLA, last year's NCAA cham
pion.
The move up is a result of Stanford's victory in
the ITCA team championship three weeks ago in
Louisville, Ky.
Stanford last held the No. 1 ranking in last year's
preseason poll, following its 1983 national champi
onship. The Cardinal held the No. 2 spot during
most of last season behind UCLA.
The Cardinal's top player, Dan Goldie, did not
play in the NorCals because he has been competing
in a singles tournament in La Quinta.
Goldie also saw his preseason ranking rise this
week from No. 2 to No. 1 in the nation, after
defeating the preseason No. 1 pick, Michael
Pernfors of Georgia, in the ITCA Individual In
door Championships two weeks ago.
Stanford Coach Dick Gould was very pleased
with his team's performance in the tournament, es
pecially in singles competition.

"Our singles play was outstanding. Jim Grabb
didn't lose a single set â€” that really says some
thing," Gould said.
Grabb saw his national ranking jump from No.
22 to No. 3 this week. He attributed the rise to
having reached the semifinals of the ITCA Individ
uals.
"I don't think it (the ranking) will affect my
playing. It might give me a little more confidence,
but you still have to prepare for each match the
same way. . . . Rankings don't really count all that
much," Grabb said.
Gould was equally impressed with the play of
Jacobson and sophomore Scott Moody. Jacobson
entered the tournament at the last moment to
replace Derrick Rostagno in singles competition.
Moody took Goldie's spot.
The doubles finals should be "a real test" for
McEnroe and Rostagno, Gould said. Roybal and
Wakefield, their opponents, were the Pacific Coast
Athletic Association doubles champions last year.
Stanford returns to dual match play Tuesday
against San Diego State. That match will start at
1:30 p.m. on the Varsity Courts.
