# Card spikers take Hawaii in four games
## 
### ROB GRAHAM Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford men's volleyball team
saved its best efforts for the critical
moments yesterday as it dumped
Hawaii in a two-hour, 15-minute
match here, 18-16, 15-17, 15-13 15.
8.
The victory boosted Stanford's
mark in the California Intercollegiate
Volleyball Association to 4-3. The
Cardinal, ranked sixth in the country,
sports a 14-4 overall record.
The first three games of yesterday's

marathon saw leads change hands
with dazzling suddeness. With each
team siding-out well, the match was
transformed into somewhat of an en
durance contest. And neither squad
was able to build, much less protect, a
substantial lead — until the Cardinal
began to dominate in the fourth
game.
"It was a good effort all around,"
Stanford. Co-coach Don Shaw said.
"In those tight moments you try to go
after it, and we did.
"We didn't have many letdowns

and we were able to come back after
our mistakes —we didn't let them get
us down. We were able to separate
the plays and take the points one at a
time."
With the match tied at a set apiece
and the third set even, Stanford cap
tain Craig Lauchner, the lone senior
starter, came through with his vicious
jump serve.
His serve at 13-13 was not
returned, and at 14-13 his serve
forced a weak return, allowing the
Cardinal to set up its offense. After a
delicate set, Lauchner himself fit
tingly did the honors with a set
winning kill.
After falling behind 2-6 in the
fourth set, Stanford regrouped and
powered to victory. An unanswered
run of 10 points staked the Cardinal
to a commanding 12-6 advantage and
the Rainbows were unable to
respond.
"We kind of broke down in that
last game," said Jim Smoot, Hawaii's
first-year coach. "We simply fell
apart." From then on, the Cardinal
coasted.
The difference in the match might
be traced to a noticeable decline in
the effectiveness of Hawaii's hitters.
After posting reasonable hitting per
centages of .416 and .380 in the first
two sets, the Rainbows were able to
muster less spectacular marks of .169
and .171 in the last two sets.
Both coaches attributed the trend
to an improvement in Stanford's
blocking and digging. "(Scott)
Fortune helped with a couple of great
digs," Shaw said.
"(Jon) Root played really well —
he had a lot of crucial digs," Smoot
added. On the evening Stanford
notched 17 unassisted blocks while
Hawaii recorded but seven.
Smoot sensed another factor,
besides a fall in hitting effectiveness
which hurt his squad. "We're not
happy with the play of the linesmen,"
he said. "I know the bad calls evened
out, but they seemed to affect my
guys a little more."
