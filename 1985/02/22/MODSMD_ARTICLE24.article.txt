Tonight, the Stanford women's gymnastics team will be
in Corvallis, Ore., to compete in the Oregon State Invita
tional. The five-way competition will feature lOth-ranked
Washington, Utah State, New Mexico and the host
Beavers.
Oregon State, ranked fifth in the nation, will be the
highest-ranked team the Cardinal has faced this season.
As of Feb. 13, the Stanford women were ranked seventh
in a tie with Penn State.
"We're not looking to win or lose in this competition,"
Head Coach Homer Sardina said. "We're aiming to hit
our routines. The results will take care of themselves."
"We go from meet to meet," Sardina continued. "1 feel
it's better to concentrate on the meet that we're compet
ing in rather than to look too far ahead to future goals. It's
a step-by-step, meet-by-meet process."

The Cardinal has been consistently scoring team totals
between 180.00 and 184.00 points. Sardina predicts that
if the Cardinal women hit their routines well in tonight's
invitational, they are capable of setting a new team
record.
"A team total of 184.00 to 185.00 points is a very real
istic aim," Sardina said. "It will take a strong team effort,
but we have the potential to do it."
The invitational will be split up into two evenings. The
team competition will be held tonight and the individual
event finals will be held tomorrow night. Because gymnas
tics is such a popular spectator sport at Oregon State, the
crowd is likely to be the largest the Cardinal has seen so
far this season.
"Attendance has reached as high as 8,000 there in the
past," Sardina said. "1 think it will have a positive effect
on the team, because it should be a real adrenalin boost —
but of course this will be true for all of the teams there."
