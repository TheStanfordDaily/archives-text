# McDermott is no star, but he's still 'fired up'
## 
### BETH KLEID Senior sportswriter 
Sophomore John McDermott
could be called Mr. Personality of
the Stanford men's volleyball team.
The outside hitter is no star of
the team, though. And for now that
doesn't bother him. "In a way it's
better not to be the star — it's kind
of nice to go out and do your
best without having that responsi
bility," McDermott said. "It's al
ways nice to be a star, but if you're
not you just have to go out and play
your role."
McDermott does just that, and
his role seems to involve maintain
ing his undying enthusiasm. He
may not be known as a volleyball
standout, but he is known for his
cheerful personality and his upbeat
attitude.
In a word, McDermott is
"psyched."
"You could say I'm pretty fired
up," he said. "I do run around and
yell a lot."
But his attitude is not always
contagious to his team members.
"Everyone takes it differently.
Some guys play better when they're
calm and relaxed. I think I do bet
ter when I'm pumped — it's just my
personality," he said.
McDermott said that last season
his team could have used a bit more
life. "We were really dead, and we
didn't do that well."
He attributes some of the prob
lems his team had to the rift be
tween the players who were
"pumped" and the calmer players.
Last season, the team beat top
rated Pepperdine, but its success
did not continue.
According to McDermott, the
reason the talented team finished
the season with a 6-12 league
record is "hard to focus on."
"This year, we are all really
trying to be more of a team. We're
aware there's a problem, and we
can't be a solid, cohesive unit until
we solve it. Our main goal right
now is to stick together as a team."
McDermott said that this year his
team is doing "a lot, lot better."
The Cardinal is 4-3 in the Califor
nia Intercollegiate Volleyball Asso
ciation and 15-4 overall.
His goal for this season is to see
his team finish as one of the top five
in its league — which includes vol
leyball powers like Pepperdine,
UCLA, USC and UC-Santa Bar
bara — and eventually to make the
Final Four.
"It's a very realistic goal," he
said. "We just have to be aware —
and not mess up and go downhill
like last year."
The sophomore likes this season
better than last for more personal

reasons. As a freshman, it was hard
for him to let his personality shine.
"I didn't really know where I
stood. They don't take you
seriously when you're a freshman. 1
didn't feel it my right place to start
leading the team," he recalled. He
was a starter as a freshman, which
helped to boost his confidence.
McDermott said that this year he
is more comfortable with his role
on the team. And he has noticed
improvements in his game. "The
coaches are working with me on my
technique, and I'm changing my
game habits and my style," he said.
"I'm learning how to play with
more freedom in the way I do
things — high school was really
restrictive in that area."
According to McDermott, his
back-row game is his strongest
point, i'lt gives me confidence," he
said.
He is still polishing his blocking
skills. "Blocking is what I'm
working on most — it's a lot easier
to put the ball away that to block.
And the guys hit so hard in college
volleyball," he said.
Volleyball has not always been
McDermott's sport. "I was a tennis
player," he said. Indeed, he was
ranked in the top five in Hawaii in
singles and doubles play.
But when a volleyball-playing
friend of his at Punahou High

School in Honolulu introduced him
to volleyball, McDermott fell in
love. "It was more the sport for me
— a team sport is more fitting to my
personality." He and his friend,
who now plays for No. 1-ranked
Pepperdine, went on to lead their
high school team to the Hawaii
State Championships.
His parents, however, were not
so happy at first about this switch
away from tennis.
"They kept telling me not to
throw my tennis away, but when
they realized what volleyball meant
to me, they were encouraging.
"Tennis gave me a good back
ground for volleyball," McDermott
said. It is easier for him to learn
volleyball skills when Coaches Don
Shaw and Fred Sturm make
analogies to tennis. "Tennis and
volleyball have a lot in common —
like being low and footwork —
footwork is critical," McDermott
added.
Now that McDermott has found
volleyball, he doesn't plan on
leaving the sport. He said he would
like to coach part-time in the
future. His other plans are up in
the air, as is his major. "I'm at
that point where I've got to decide
what I want to do."
