# Card faces San Jose in three-game set
## 
### TOM SENF Staff sportswriter 
Coming off an impressive series with 20th
ranked Fresno State, the Stanford baseball team
looks to improve its 8-3 record this weekend as it
takes on San Jose State in a three-game set.
After the Spartans host today's game, the two
teams will play a double-header here tomorrow at
noon.
Last weekend, Stanford took three out of four
games from the defending Northern California
Baseball Association champion Bulldogs. The
Cardinal broke out of its early season batting slump
and poured 29 runs across the plate in the four
games.
Leading the onslaught were outfielders Walt
Harris and Mark Davis. Harris, who has led the
team in hitting for almost the entire year, has a six
game hitting streak and is now batting .378.
In each of the last five games, Davis has at least
one hit and one RBI — including three home runs.
During his streak, he has increased his batting
average by more than 100 points to .357.
Catcher John Ramos has also added offensive
punch to go with his solid play behind the plate. In
the last eight games, he is hitting .343 with two
homers and six RBIs.
The diversified Cardinal attack has been a
welcome sight for Stanford Coach Mark Marquess,
whose offense was carried solely by first baseman
Rick Lundblade early in the season.
"Lundblade is cooling off a little bit, and the
pitchers are pitching around him," Marquess said
of the senior, who has walked 13 times so far.
"Some other guys have picked up the slack, and
that's what you need."

One thing that isn't cooling off is the Cardinal
pitching. Rob Wassenaar and Jeff Ballard have
combined for a 5-0 record, and reliever Rick Dietz
has a win and four saves in his six appearances.
Dietz, whose ERA is 0.82, allowed his only earned
run of the season on Monday.
With league play only a week away. Marquess is
happy about the way his team has progressed.
"We've improved from week to week, and that's
what you want to see," he said. "If we can keep im
proving, we should be ready to contend for the Pac
-10 championship."
The Spartans bring a 5-4 record into this
weekend's play. Coach Gene Menges has gotten
tough , rformances from his pitching staff, but his
lineup has produced little offensively. The Spartans
have hit only three home runs. One bright spot has
been outfielder Mark Saucedo, who is hitting .393.
Good pitching and poor hitting are a familiar
scenario to Marquess. "They're a lot like we were
early in the year," he said. "They've pitched well
and played good defense, but they haven't hit so
far. We're hoping to keep them down."
Those who like double-headers should not miss
this one — it is the only one on the Cardinal's home
schedule. The reason is simple: "I hate them,"
Marquess said. "It's just a real long day."
Nevertheless, Marquess wants his team to have
played a twin-bill in case it is necessary later in the
season. "We may have to do it in league, so it's nice
to have done it once," he said. "Also, with mid
terms going on, it's important to give the players a
day off without classes on Sunday."
Wassenaar, Ballard and Jack McDowell will be
the Cardinal starters.
