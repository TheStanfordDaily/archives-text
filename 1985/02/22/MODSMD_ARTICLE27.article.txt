# Stanford's biggest baseball fan 'lives and dies with the team'
## 
### JENNIFER KOCH 
Urgent, husky cries of "Come on boys, we
can do it!" punctuate the action of virtually
every baseball game played at Stanford's
Sunken Diamond. The source of this friendly
support? Not the coach, as might be expected,
but a 29-year-old fan named Pam Perry.
The cheers come from the set of bleachers
above the dugout where Perry, wearing a
Stanford baseball cap, leans forward to watch
the action on the field. The cap, as well as a
season's pass for all home games, was given to
her by Cardinal third-base coach Dean Stotz.
Saying that she has always followed
baseball, both on the professional and college
level, Perry lists the San Francisco Giants and
the Oakland A's as her favorite major league
teams. She also enjoys football, and attends
all Cardinal games at Stanford Stadium.
Perry explains that her enjoyment of the
sport as well as her knowledge of the rules
contribute to her interest in baseball. The
close proximity of her Palo Alto home and the
opportunity she has had to become better ac
quainted with the players have brought about
her interest in baseball at Stanford.
"1 thought why not come to Stanford and
get to know the players," Perry said. "It's
really fun and gives me something to do."

Perry lives with her parents and younger
brother and rides her bike a great deal to keep
herself busy. She used that bike to transport
her to all but one Stanford home game last
season.
The players and coaches apparently appre
ciate Perry's support and encouragement.
After a recent Stanford victory. Perry waited
in the bleachers for the team, ready to heap
congratulations on them. As the players left
the field, several of them called out her name.
Pitcher Kevin Kunkel paused to talk with
Perry before heading for the lockerroom.
The general atmosphere of the team seems
to be friendly and good-natured toward their
enthusiastic fan. Perry herself firmly believes
that "they like having me out there."
"Its fun to know people on the team," she
said, adding that shortstop John Verducci and
catcher Darrcll Cass are her favorite Cardinal
players. She feels she knows f bese players the
best, as they are "really friendly and take time
to talk to me."
"She's a great fan," Cass said. "All the
players can hear her cheering us on, and we
appreciate her support."
Perry believes the Cardinal is playing better
so far in the 1985 season than it did last year.
"They look pretty good," she said. "They
struggle here and there but every team does.

They learn a lot, and I do, too."
The coaches, as well as the players, realize
how important the Cardinal team is in Perry's
life. Apparently proud of the fact that all the
coaches know her. Perry smiles as she says
that they all say hello and talk to her when she
comes to the games.
"She's pretty unique," Stotz said. "No mat
ter what the situation, she tries not to let us
get too down."
"We're in this together," Perry says, and
she takes any kind of rebuff from a team
member personally. After a recent Cardinal
loss, some of the players were discouraged
and walked past Perry without stopping to
talk. She was evidently very upset, because
she had wanted to share her feelings with the
players. As Stotz says, "She lives and dies
with the team."
Perry's enthusiastic cheers have become a
characteristic part of an afternoon at Sunken
Diamond. Any spectator can find her al
ternately concentrating on the game, clapping
her hands and yelling out her own special en
couragements to the team. Don't ask her to
take her eyes off the field very often, though
— the most important thing about an after
noon at Sunken Diamond for Perry is
"watching my buddies play out there."
