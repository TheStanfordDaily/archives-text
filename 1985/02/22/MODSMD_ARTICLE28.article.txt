If the Cardinal performs as well as it did during the
second half of Wednesday nighfs 80-68 loss to USC, the
Htans may be hard-pressed to stop Stanford from ending
its six-game losing streak.
During the second half of the game with the No. 12-
ranked I rojans, the Cardinal was outscored only 40-38
and displayed quick ball movement and overall aggressive
cohi iveness — both offensive and defensive — that had
been lacking in the previous five losses.
The fourth-place Titans, 5-5 in conference, 14-9 over
| all, enter tomorrow's game in the midst of a psychological
skid. winning live of its first six conference match
ups, Fullerton has fallen on hard times, losing four in a
j row.
The Titans lost a close battle to conference leader Long
Beach State, 62-60, back on Feb. 8. Losing to the No. 4-
ranked 49ers isn't exactly traumatizing. The following 54-
51 loss to USC was.

With two minutes to play, and with Cheryl Miller sitting
on the bench after fouling out, Fullerton had what ap
peared to be a safe four-point lead. Despite this, the
Trojans came back to win 54-51.
The loss may have broken the Titans' backs. After
back-to-back losses to UCLA, 78-69, and San Diego
State, 83-73, it appears they have lost some of the inten
sity they had earlier when they beat the Cardinal here, 66-
51.
With Fullerton suffering from a possible lack of motiva
tion, the Cardinal has a real chance for an upset. But no
team likes to lose its fifth game in a row, especially to one
that has lost six straight, so Stanford will have to play its
best.
"In order to upset any of the remaining teams, we have
to be perfect," Stanford Asst. Coach Eileen Roche said
after the USC game. "I think we can beat Fullerton State.
We have to take them out of their running game, and, of
course, rebounding is a must."
The Cardinal, 2-7 in the WCAA, 9-14 overall, proved
against the Trojans it is capable of rebounding against any
team. Stanford pulled down 39 boards to USC's 40.
