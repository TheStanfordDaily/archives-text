# Senate ballot OKs charge
## 
### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Staff writer 
The Faculty Senate voted unani
mously yesterday to approve, with a
few modifications, the charge to the
senate committee that will examine
the academic relationship between
Stanford and the Hoover Institution.
The charge, drafted by the senate's
Committee on Committees and
Steering Committee, calls for the new
group to ensure "that the issues
which should bear on academic
relationships between the Hoover In
stitution and the Stanford profes
soriate are frankly and fully and
publicly addressed."
Provost James Rosse, in a prepared
statement to the senate, said one of
the committee's primary tasks "will
be helping to create a climate where
cooperation is possible when mutual
interest dictates, but where joint ac
tion can be honorably and honestly
declined when that interest is lack
ing."
Rosse, who as the University's top
academic officer will sit but not vote
on the seven-member committee,
said, "The problem is to create the
means for organizational units with
quite different institutions to
cooperate towards common ends
where commonality of interest
exists."
The senate voted to create the
committee on Feb. 7 in response to
criticism of the Ward Committee
report, which said that strengthening
ties between the University ar|d
Hoover could lead to a prestigious so
cial sciences program here. At that
meeting, senators expressed concern
over the academic costs of imple
menting the Ward recommendations.
Yesterday the senate voted to
change the name of the committee
from the Committee on Stanford-
Hoover Academic Relationships, to
the Committee on the Relation be
tween the Hoover Institution and the
Stanford Professoriate, saying the lat

ter avoids the implication that Stan
ford and Hoover are not separate and
independent bodies.
The charge stresses the academic
relationship between the two parties
and intentionally avoids the more
controversial — and inappropriate —
political question, senators say.
University President Donald Ken
nedy said in his report to the senate
that the divestiture recommendation
by the Commission on Investment
Responsibility (C-IR) in the
Motorola Corp. case was a correct
one, but cautioned against the liberal
use of this practice.
Kennedy favored neither blanket
nor formula divestiture. He ques
tioned whether divestiture is the cor
rect approach to take and the propri
ety of divestiture as a method to in
fluence and modify corporate behav
ior.
Kennedy said no examination of
Baker International Corp. stock has
been made, but the shares were a gift
given with the stipulation that they
not be sold without donor consent.
He said the University does not nor
mally accept gift stock under these
conditions.
Harvard University recently
divested from Baker, a City of
Orange-based mining equipment
company, in response to Baker's not
allowing Harvard officials to investi
gate company adherence to the Sul
livan principles.
The senate also heard Tjeerd van
Andel, chairman of the committee on
undergraduate admissions and finan
cial aid and a professor of geology,
give his Annual Report for 1983-84.
Andel told the senate that admission
to the University would still be
granted without regard to intended
major.
"Financial aid is canceled only in
the event that a student is
suspended," the report stated.
"During the 1982-83 academic year,
out of a total of $14 million in aid,
$300,000 was awarded to students on
provisional registration."
"Secretary (of Education William)
Bennett is seeing a different group of
students than I am," van Andel said.
"Most students are operating on a
frugal budget."
He also discussed questions regard
ing how long undergraduates are eli
gible to receive financial aid, espe
cially students entering their fifth

year at Stanford and those electing to
enter the co-terminal program.
Political Science Prof. Hans Weiler
stressed the importance of the co
terminal arrangement and said it
should be included in the financial aid
report. He also expressed concern
over the percentage of applicants ad
mitted who are strong in their quan
titative abilities, but who choose to go
to other institutions.
Dean of Admissions Jean Fetter
acknowledged Weiler's concern and
said her office is recruiting mathema
tically oriented high school students.
Some faculty members cited merit
scholarships as a means other schools
use to attract the most qualified ap

plicants. Stanford does not currently
award scholarships based on aca
demic excellence.
English Prof. John Bender sugges
ted that Stanford award a type of
"prize fellowship" for academic ex
cellence.
"We are rewarding high levels of
athletic achievements," Bender said.

few modifications, the charge to the
senate committee that will examine
the academic relationship between
Stanford and the Hoover Institution.
The charge, drafted by the senate's
Committee on Committees and
Steering Committee, calls for the new
group to ensure "that the issues
which should bear on academic
relationships between the Hoover In
stitution and the Stanford profes
soriate are frankly and fully and
publicly addressed."
Provost James Rosse, in a prepared
statement to the senate, said one of
the committee's primary tasks "will
be helping to create a climate where
cooperation is possible when mutual
interest dictates, but where joint ac
tion can be honorably and honestly
declined when that interest is lack
ing."
Rosse, who as the University's top
academic officer will sit but not vote
on the seven-member committee,
said, "The problem is to create the
means for organizational units with
quite different institutions to
cooperate towards common ends
where commonality of interest
exists."
The senate voted to create the
committee on Feb. 7 in response to
criticism of the Ward Committee
report, which said that strengthening
ties between the University ar|d
Hoover could lead to a prestigious so
cial sciences program here. At that
meeting, senators expressed concern
over the academic costs of imple
menting the Ward recommendations.
Yesterday the senate voted to
change the name of the committee
from the Committee on Stanford-
Hoover Academic Relationships, to
the Committee on the Relation be
tween the Hoover Institution and the
Stanford Professoriate, saying the lat

ter avoids the implication that Stan
ford and Hoover are not separate and
independent bodies.
The charge stresses the academic
relationship between the two parties
and intentionally avoids the more
controversial — and inappropriate —
political question, senators say.
University President Donald Ken
nedy said in his report to the senate
that the divestiture recommendation
by the Commission on Investment
Responsibility (C-IR) in the
Motorola Corp. case was a correct
one, but cautioned against the liberal
use of this practice.
Kennedy favored neither blanket
nor formula divestiture. He ques
tioned whether divestiture is the cor
rect approach to take and the propri
ety of divestiture as a method to in
fluence and modify corporate behav
ior.
Kennedy said no examination of
Baker International Corp. stock has
been made, but the shares were a gift
given with the stipulation that they
not be sold without donor consent.
He said the University does not nor
mally accept gift stock under these
conditions.
Harvard University recently
divested from Baker, a City of
Orange-based mining equipment
company, in response to Baker's not
allowing Harvard officials to investi
gate company adherence to the Sul
livan principles.
The senate also heard Tjeerd van
Andel, chairman of the committee on
undergraduate admissions and finan
cial aid and a professor of geology,
give his Annual Report for 1983-84.
Andel told the senate that admission
to the University would still be
granted without regard to intended
major.
"Financial aid is canceled only in
the event that a student is
suspended," the report stated.
"During the 1982-83 academic year,
out of a total of $14 million in aid,
$300,000 was awarded to students on
provisional registration."
"Secretary (of Education William)
Bennett is seeing a different group of
students than I am," van Andel said.
"Most students are operating on a
frugal budget."
He also discussed questions regard
ing how long undergraduates are eli
gible to receive financial aid, espe
cially students entering their fifth

year at Stanford and those electing to
enter the co-terminal program.
Political Science Prof. Hans Weiler
stressed the importance of the co
terminal arrangement and said it
should be included in the financial aid
report. He also expressed concern
over the percentage of applicants ad
mitted who are strong in their quan
titative abilities, but who choose to go
to other institutions.
Dean of Admissions Jean Fetter
acknowledged Weiler's concern and
said her office is recruiting mathema
tically oriented high school students.
Some faculty members cited merit
scholarships as a means other schools
use to attract the most qualified ap

plicants. Stanford does not currently
award scholarships based on aca
demic excellence.
English Prof. John Bender sugges
ted that Stanford award a type of
"prize fellowship" for academic ex
cellence.
"We are rewarding high levels of
athletic achievements," Bender said.
