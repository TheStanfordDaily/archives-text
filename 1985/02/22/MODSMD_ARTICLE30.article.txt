## Card faces San Jose in final dual match 
### ERIK ESELIUS Staff sportswriter 
After a two-week layover, the
Stanford men's and women's fencing
teams will complete their final dual
match of the season today against San
Jose State, the West Coast's No. 2-
ranked team.
The Spartans should be
"psychologically high," according to
Cardinal Coach Buzz Hurst, because
Mike D'Asaro, the San Jose State
coach for 15 years, will retire after
the match. D'Asaro and Hurst were
also "arch rivals" when they fenced in
their collegiate days at Navy and New
York University, respectively.
The Spartan women's team will be
led by Katie Koombs, who placed
second at the regional championships
last year behind Stanford's Jennifer
Yu.
San Jose's loss of Debbie Gross
man, its No. 2-see,ded fencer, to a
muscle pull should increase the prob
ability for a Cardinal win.
Hurst expects a "high-intensity,
highly emotional" match for the 15-1
Stanford men's team, which narrowly
defeated the Spartans 14-13 earlier in
the season.

"We're hoping to go out with a
bang and they are just as deter
mined,". Hurst said. "I'm sure they
would like to win the final one for
their coach."
The toughest and most competitive
match of the meet should he between
Stanford captain Elliott Cheu and the
Spartan's Dean Hinton, who defeated
Cheu in their last match when San
Jose came away with a 5-4 decision
over the Cardinal.
Cheu hopes to be "a little more in
tense" against his Spartan rival —
their rivalry has been going for three
years, with the two trading victories.
As the Cardinal men's season
comes to a close, Cheu called it a suc
cess. "We started off slowly, but we
are getting more intense now. Every
one started peaking at the same time
— everyone came together.
"We've come a long way — we've
only suffered one defeat, and that was
really close."
Regionals will be held at Cal Tech
in Pasadena. The Cardinal women
begin regionals next weekend while
the men compete the following
weekend.
