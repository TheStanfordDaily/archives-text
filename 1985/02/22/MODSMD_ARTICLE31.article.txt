# Swimmers close season with Big Meet
## 
### INGRID SEYER Staff sportswriter 
California is going to be a very
lough team for the Stanford men's
swimming team to beat. The Bears'
record may not show it, but its swim
mers do.
California, 1-6 this season, will
host the Cardinal tomorrow at 1
p.m. Although the Bears have only
defeated one team this year, UCLA,
Stanford Men's Swimming Coach
Skip Kenney is certain that this
record is not indicative of Cal's
strength in the pool.
"The times on paper show that we

can beat California fairly easily, but
previous times are not going to affect
this meet very much," Kenney said.
"The Stanford at California meet is
never easy, and this year won't be any
exception."
California's poor record and com
paratively low times are due in part to
the Bears' heavy weight program, ac
cording to Kenney.
"The Cal swimmers have a very in
tense weight program and conse
quently they swim very tired through
out most of their regualar season,"
Kenney said. "Their weight training
just ended and they are starting to

taper now, so their times are going to
improve drastically in the next few
weeks.
"California has trained in this man
ner for many years, and every year
they swim their best times at the end
of the season, in the NCAAs."
Because tomorrow's meet is the
last one of the season, the Cardinal
swimmers will be pushing themselves
extra hard to bring home a victory.
"The seniors on our team have
never lost to Cal and are very
motivated to keep it that way," Ken
ney said. "This is also the last dual
meet our seniors will swim in for
Stanford, so that will add a very emo
tional slant to the meet.
"Our team goal is to keep the
power that we had in the USC
UCLA weekend rolling all the way
through Saturday's meet, the Pac-lOs
and the NCAAs"
Stanford has a strong chance of
rolling through the butterfly and
breaststroke events tomorrow, but
many of the other races should be
close. There will be key match-ups
between Stanford and California
swimmers in at least three events.
In the 200-meter freestyle, David
Louden will face Cal's Olympian
Matt Biondi. Biondi, favored to win
the 200 in the NCAA Champion
ships, swam on the gold medal 400-
meter freestyle relay in Los Angeles
this summer.
Stanford's Jeff Kostoff and Cal's
John Mykkennen will meet in the
500- and 1,000-yard freestyle events.
Mykkannen won a silver medal in the
400-meter freestyle in 1984 and Kos
toff placed sixth in the 400 individual
medley.
In the backstroke events, Stan
ford's Dave Bottom will face Swedish
Olypiam Pengt Baron. Baron won a
gold medal in the 100 backstroke in
Moscow five years ago.
Cal fields very strong relay teams
and consequently, the relays are one
area the Cardinal will be focusing on.
"Cal's 400-yard freestyle relay is
the fastest in the nation and it is going
to be tough to beat," Kenney said.
"We will keep some swimmers out of
their normal events in order to save
them for that last relay. Our relay
competition against them will give us
a good indication of how we can do in
the NCAAs."
Stanford's divers are expected to
dominate both the 1- and 3-meter
diving events.
