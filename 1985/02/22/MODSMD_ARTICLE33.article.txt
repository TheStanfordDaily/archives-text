## Diner or cafe? Fanny and Alexander can't decide 
### 
Fanny and Alexander
271 University Ave.
Palo Alto
328-7700
A classic student hang out, the
University Creamery, and the elegant
Italian spot, Trattoria Romana, span
the extremes in restaurant selection
in the University Avenue neighbor
hood. But the recently renamed
Fanny and Alexander, also on Uni
versity, cannot decide whether to em
ulate the homey small-town diner or
the classy suburban nightspot.
Fanny and Alexander, known as Le
Normandie Cafe Francais until two
weeks ago, proudly proclaims its
Parisian roots. Traditional blue-and
white-checked tablecloths, red tulips
and dusty wine bottles suggested we
were in for an authentic French meal.
A menu featuring a wide selection of
crepes, quiches and entrees covered
in rich cream sauces reinforced our
first impressions.
But a closer examination revealed
some flaws.
A wine glass broken to its stem, un
matched silverware, paper napkins,
an incomplete place setting, spotted
water glasses, half-empty salt shakers
partially filled with grains of pepper
and a tacky tin sugar tray forced us to
re-evaluate just what kind of place we
were in.
Undaunted, we ordered a glass of
the house white wine in keeping with
the French theme. The wine list was
somewhat limited, but the selection
was very good, with prices ranging
$1.50 to $4.50 per glass.
Although the restaurant does not
have a full bar with hard alcohol, it
serves wine, champagne and beer by
the bottle. Prices run $10 to $20 for a
bottle of wine, and up to $90 for a
bottle of Dom Perignon.
With our drinks, the busboy
brought a basket of bread and butter.
The bread was French, but it was pre
sliced and cold, and the butter was
wrapped in individual foil pats.
The menu offers a diverse range of
appetizers and salads. We opted for
cheese fondue — $ 11 for two — over
the smoked salmon, liver pate and es
cargot. These were all reasonably

priced around $5.
The fondue, with a delicious winey
flavor, arrived in its own pot over a
sterno burner accompanied by a pair
of fondue forks and a heaping basket
of bread slices. The waiter warned us
it was a meal in itself, but we had no
trouble scraping the very bottom, as
well as doing away with a small din
ner salad of lettuce, tomatoes and
cucumbers, at $2.50. Other salads in
cluded a lyonnaise and a nicoise.
The thousand island dressing was
tasty, but the bleu cheese seemed ar
tificial. There were no other dressing
selections on this particular evening.
This refrain from the waiter— "I'm
sorry, but we're out of that tonight"
— came as no surprise as earlier he
told us they were also out of two
brands of bottled beer.
As we waited for our entrees, we
remained somewhat ambivalent
about the restaurant. After our initial
disappointment with some of the
details — the diner-style setting and
the relatively slow service (there was
only one waiter and one busboy for
10 tables) — we had been heartened
by the French decor and the quality
of the food, particularly the fondue.
For dinner we chose from fresh
fish, poultry, liver, lamb, veal and
beef. The entrees ranged from $7.50
for the poultry dishes to $13.50 for
some of the steaks. Several fresh fish
specials are also offered.
The sole in white wine sauce
($8.95), complete with head, tail and
lots of bones, was light and flavorful.
The chicken scampi ($7.50), highly
recommended by the waiter, featured
chunks of chicken in a zesty tomato
and mushroom sauce and was quite
good. Both dinners came with rice
and green beans.
For dessert, our waiter rattled off a
variety of options, including choco
late mousse, several tortes and cakes,
and flan au caramel. We ordered
crepe suzette for $5.50. Our choice
was very sweet in a thick, marmalade
like syrup. And, yes, we polished that
off, too.
A wide variety of espresso and cap
pucino were also available, but we

had finally found our limit. Other
choices we passed up included fruit
juices, soups, breakfast items and
baguette and croissant sandwiches.
The waiter told us these sandwiches
are popular at the restaurant's busy
lunch hour.
Pleasantly satiated, we decided that

we could overlook the superficial
problems. The quality of the food and
large servings were a great value. In
fact, the couple sitting next to us,
regulars who ordered and ate their
entrees quickly, really enjoyed their
dinner and recommended the loca
tion for a casual meal with a cozy at

mosphere. The outdoor patio and live
piano music Tuesdays through Satur
days also adds personality.
Once Fanny and Alexander
decides what kind of restaurant it
wants to be — diner or classy cafe —
it will become a popular Palo Alto
eatery. Until then, its fine cuisine and

charm will remain overshadowed by
its inattention to detail. But with a
new name and newer menu still to
come, the future still holds promise
for French food on University Avenue.

With outside patio tables for sunny afternoon enjoyment, Fanny and
Alexander emulates the streetside-cafe style popular in France. Inside,

the restaurant strives to produce fine French cuisine while overcoming
the problems associated with new management.
