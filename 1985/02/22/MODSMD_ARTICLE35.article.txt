Getting tired of the same old food
service cuisine? Looking for an easy
change of pace without embarking on
a major expedition or spending next
quarter's tuition? Want to just do
something? Fear not! Your salvation
lies in King Chuan Restaurant, right
across El Camino Real in the Town
and Country village, serving the best
in Peking and Szechuan Chinese
cuisine.
The restaurant, tucked in among all

Definitely the
champions of the
menu, King
Chuan's beef
dishes are
prepared with
sauces so special
that the chef is not
at liberty to reveal
their ingredients.

the other stores in the Village, may be
a hit difficult to find at first. Upon en
tering, we found the fairly subdued
decor and good number of tables the
perfect place for a fun, informal din
ner. King Chuan opens for dinner at 5
p.m., and although reservations are
not necessary, we suggest arriving
fairly early: Between 6 and 6:30 the
restaurant began to fill up rapidly. If
your entire dorm hall spontaneously
decides to bag food service and go for
something different, by all means call
in to reserve one of the large tables

capable of seating 10 or so.
Don't worry about deciding what
to order: You won't go wrong with
anything on the menu. If you're one
who prefers easy-to-order combina
tion dinners, King Chuan offers 10
separate dinner plans for two to 10
people, serving its most popular
dishes from the menu. These cost
from $7 to $10 per person.
Otherwise, choose from the menu
of more than 100 dishes ranging from
hot and cold appetizers and sizzling
rice, through pork, beef and poultry
specialities, to seafood, vegetable,
chow mein and fried rice selections.
King Chuan offers several hot and
spicy dishes in the Szechuan style,
and there's an ample supply of potent
hot sauce at every table. The friendly
staff will be glad to help if you have
any questions about selecting dishes.
We decided to start with some ap
petizers. The egg rolls (four for
$2.50) and the potstickers (six for
$2.85) arrived very quickly, hot out
of the pan. These were demolished in
short order, and we moved on to the
main course. We were hard-pressed
to figure out what to order, but
decided to sample a dish from each
category on the menu. With just two
people, this elicited many long
glances from the other patrons, and
resulted in a lot of take-home
goodies.
All the dishes were served at once,
keeping the food hot and ensuring
proper enjoyment of the meal. The
shrimp with snowpeas ($5.75), lemon
chicken ($5.25) and the chicken with
almonds ($4.75) all tasted great. The
individual sauces of each dish added
the extra flavor, making each entree
delicious. The mo-shu dishes are a
specialty of the house (meat and veg
tables are spread over plum sauce on
a flour tortilla, rolled up), and taste as
good as the waiter promised.
However, the undisputed cham
pions of the menu are the beef dishes.
The beef with broccoli or the beef
with oyster sauce (both $5.25) are
definite musts. The beef is so tender it
feels as if it were just melting in your
mouth, leaving a lingering pleasure
for the taste buds. Once again. King

Chuan's mastery of sauces shines
through in these dishes.
Top all this off with some fried rice
or chow mein (King Chuan also
serves beer and wine), and you've got
a repast that not only will beat any
thing comparable you are likely to
find in the immediate area, but won't

deplete your funds either. Assuming
a standard dinner of appetizers and
one dish per person with everyone
sharing samples, the average dinner
may run $5 to $7.
Unfortunately, we came nowhere
close to covering King Chuan's exten
sive menu; there is certainly some

thing for everyone.
If you are in a hurry or would
rather eat at home, King Chuan of
fers take-out available for the entire
menu. Just call in and they'll take it
from there. King Chuan is also open
tor lunch Monday through Friday
from 11:30 until 2:30.

So again, if the impulse to dine out
hits you over the head, if you're
looking for something different and
delicious, just take the short hop
across El Camino to King Chuan.

Getting tired of the same old food
service cuisine? Looking for an easy
change of pace without embarking on
a major expedition or spending next
quarter's tuition? Want to just do
something? Fear not! Your salvation
lies in King Chuan Restaurant, right
across El Camino Real in the Town
and Country village, serving the best
in Peking and Szechuan Chinese
cuisine.

the other stores in the Village, may be
a hit difficult to find at first. Upon en
tering, we found the fairly subdued
decor and good number of tables the
perfect place for a fun, informal din
ner. King Chuan opens for dinner at 5
p.m., and although reservations are
not necessary, we suggest arriving
fairly early: Between 6 and 6:30 the
restaurant began to fill up rapidly. If
your entire dorm hall spontaneously
decides to bag food service and go for
something different, by all means call
in to reserve one of the large tables

capable of seating 10 or so.
Don't worry about deciding what
to order: You won't go wrong with
anything on the menu. If you're one
who prefers easy-to-order combina
tion dinners, King Chuan offers 10
separate dinner plans for two to 10
people, serving its most popular
dishes from the menu. These cost
from $7 to $10 per person.
Otherwise, choose from the menu
of more than 100 dishes ranging from
hot and cold appetizers and sizzling
rice, through pork, beef and poultry
specialities, to seafood, vegetable,
chow mein and fried rice selections.
King Chuan offers several hot and
spicy dishes in the Szechuan style,
and there's an ample supply of potent
hot sauce at every table. The friendly
staff will be glad to help if you have
any questions about selecting dishes.
We decided to start with some ap
petizers. The egg rolls (four for
$2.50) and the potstickers (six for
$2.85) arrived very quickly, hot out
of the pan. These were demolished in
short order, and we moved on to the
main course. We were hard-pressed
to figure out what to order, but
decided to sample a dish from each
category on the menu. With just two
people, this elicited many long
glances from the other patrons, and
resulted in a lot of take-home
goodies.
All the dishes were served at once,
keeping the food hot and ensuring
proper enjoyment of the meal. The
shrimp with snowpeas ($5.75), lemon
chicken ($5.25) and the chicken with
almonds ($4.75) all tasted great. The
individual sauces of each dish added
the extra flavor, making each entree
delicious. The mo-shu dishes are a
specialty of the house (meat and veg
tables are spread over plum sauce on
a flour tortilla, rolled up), and taste as
good as the waiter promised.
However, the undisputed cham
pions of the menu are the beef dishes.
The beef with broccoli or the beef
with oyster sauce (both $5.25) are
definite musts. The beef is so tender it
feels as if it were just melting in your
mouth, leaving a lingering pleasure
for the taste buds. Once again. King

Chuan's mastery of sauces shines
through in these dishes.
Top all this off with some fried rice
or chow mein (King Chuan also
serves beer and wine), and you've got
a repast that not only will beat any
thing comparable you are likely to
find in the immediate area, but won't

deplete your funds either. Assuming
a standard dinner of appetizers and
one dish per person with everyone
sharing samples, the average dinner
may run $5 to $7.
Unfortunately, we came nowhere
close to covering King Chuan's exten
sive menu; there is certainly some

thing for everyone.
If you are in a hurry or would
rather eat at home, King Chuan of
fers take-out available for the entire
menu. Just call in and they'll take it
from there. King Chuan is also open
tor lunch Monday through Friday
from 11:30 until 2:30.
