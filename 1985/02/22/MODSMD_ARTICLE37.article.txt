## 'The Eyes, The Mouth': a drama of survival 
### STEVE VINEBERG Editorial staff 
The Italian director Marco Belloc
chio has been making movies for 20
years, yet he is still almost unknown
in this country. None of his work has
ever received a general release here;
unless you haunt the film festivals in
Montreal or New York or Los An
geles, or you happen to be in a city
where a particularly ambitious revival
house screens his amazing first film,
"Fists in the Pocket," you're unlikely
to have seen anything he's done.
Richard Roud's "Critical Dictionary
of the Cinema" includes no more
than a scant three paragraphs on him.
But he's a phenomenal filmmaker —
perhaps a great filmmaker, though
none of the four movies I've been for
tunate enough to catch ("Fists in the
Pocket, the Name of the
Father," "The Eyes, The Mouth" and
"Henry IV," an adaptation of Piran
dello's play) has quite crossed that
line. Along with Francesco Rosi and

the Taviani brothers, he is — as far as
one can tell from this admittedly in
adequate vantage point — doing the
most exciting work in Italian movies;
his films have a combination of highly
charged temperament, intellectual
density and supreme control that
qualify him as a true original.
In his youth, he was a satirist.
"Fists in the Pocket," made while he

was still in his twenties, featured the
bourgeoisie as a race of lustful, mur
derous monsters. The appalling fam
ily he depicted bore resemblance to
characters in Cocteau and Bunuel
(and Visconti's "Conversation
Piece," which came later), but per
haps they were too outrageous to ap
peal to even an art house audience;
when the most pernicious of them,
the incestuous Alessandro (Lou Cas
tel), began to kill off the others, a
viewer could begin to see the validity
in this Swiftian solution to the prob
lem of the middle class. In "The Eyes,
The Mouth," which has finally earned
a limited engagement in the Bay Area
(at the York Theatre in San Fran
cisco, Friday through next Wednes
day), Bellocchio no longer sees his
characters as monsters, but rather as
life-embracers, their peculiarities and
madnesses signposts on the road to
survival.
The road to survival literally leads
away from the grave. The film begins
with the gathering of three genera
tions of a family after one of the sons,
Pippo, has committed suicide. His
mother (Emmanuelle Riva) has been
told his death was an accident, and
her brother (Michel Piccoli) and her
two surviving sons (Lou Castel and
Antonio Piovanelli) — one a bach
elor, the other a widower with three
children of his own — plan to keep
her from discovering the truth. To
that end they urge Pippo's fiancee
Vanda (Angela Molina), who is car
rying his child, to appear at the
memorial service and at the funeral
breakfast, behaving in a "normal"
fashion, but she is distraught and un
controllable — even though her
greedy, socially ambitious father
believes that with a little effort she
can redeem her losses and gain access
to Pippo's wealthy family through the
unwed Giovanni. Vanda and
Giovanni do in fact become lovers,
but their relationship is far from the
crass business transaction her father's
schemes point to; the romance has
the beauty of a "found" connection
between two fiercely eccentric indi
viduals.
The title alludes to a prank
Giovanni and Pippo enjoyed playing

as teenagers to entertain the neigh
borhood girls. They used to dive into
the water, shutting themselves off and
flirting with death ("We'd close our
eyes, our mouths"); now Giovanni
realizes, "That's no way to impress a
girl." "The Eyes, The Mouth" (which
Bellochio co-wrote with Vincenzi

Cerami) is about how you keep your
self from plunging so deep into
despair that you can't come up —
how you keep breathing. According
to Giovanni, the promise of a home
and family represented for Pippo the
end of all his suffering; though we

don't know what precipitated his
suicide, presumably at some point he
ceased to have faith in that solution.
Giovanni grew up close to his
brother, and identifies with him
strongly enough to fantasize lying in
his coffin, to make Move to his girl, and
even — in the movie's most ex-

traordinary scene — to masquerade
as his ghost and visit their grieving
mother. In the world of the film, this
identification is seen as a positive
step: Giovanni, an actor by profes
sion, "doubles" for Pippo in an effort
to bring the carelessly abandoned

threads of Pippo's life to some sort of
completion, and in doing so to affirm
his own survival.
For Bellocchio, it doesn't matter
how neurotic you are — everyone in
the movie is, to a greater or lesser
degree, with the possible exception of
the Michel Piccoli character — as
long as your neuroticism allows you a
means of reaching for dry land, of
keeping your eyes and mouth open.
Vanda — played by the magnificent
Angela Molina as the young Anna
Magnani might have played her .—
hurls herself from room to room,
screams and struggles with her father,
refuses to abide by the rules of social
convention, and her total immersion
in love, over and over again, contin
ues to bring her heartbreak. But she
can tell Giovanni, "I won't kill
myself," and mean it; crazily over
committed to life, she is actually out
of danger.
For Giovanni, survival is all tied up
with acting. He was a 1960s rebel
who became a movie star for a brief
period because his fugitive looks and
uncompromising attitude spoke artic
ulately for an audience of his peers.
"They needed an angry, anti-social
type," he tells Vanda after she has
seen him act for the first time — in
"Fists in the Pocket"; showing at a
local repertory theater. (Bellocchio's
use of his own debut film is the most
overt — and the most suggestive —
example of cinematic self
reflexiveness since Erich von
Stroheim and Gloria Swanson, in
"Sunset Boulevard," watched a scene
from a film he had directed her in two
decades earlier.) "But I haven't
changed," he goes on. "I'm dated.
Your generation doesn't know I ex
ist." With his unfashionable long hair,
Lou Castel (who gives a superb per
formance) really looks like a young
rebel who has never grown out of that
phase. His refusal to play dead for
hack directors — his insistence on re
taining his integrity as an actor — has
cost him dearly, and even his uncle is
weary of his obstinately unseemly,
"clownish" behavior: "Enough of
fists in the pocket," he castigates him.
However, we understand that
Giovanni's apologia for his wrecked

career — "Even in the tackiest, the
dumbest films I always tried to con
vey something — a detail, a joke —
so I wouldn't be cancelled out, so I
would exist" — is the cry of the crea
tive artist in the wilderness (that is, in
the industry), the cry of a young Mar
lon Brando.
And not only is it admirable in it
self, not only is it Giovanni's means of

staying alive, but it also allows him to
reach out to others. While his uptight,
celibate brother frets about his
children, Giovanni plays wild,
preposterous games with them,
swinging them through the halls of
the mourning household on rugs; he's
not afraid to act the fool in order to
enchant them, or to strip in the
fireplace of Vanda's apartment and
crawl along the floor. His actor's
freedom and inventiveness culminate
in his greatest role — as his brother's
ghost, bringing solace to his damaged,
anxious mother. Vanda calls the
scene from "Fists in the Pocket" in
which the protagonist pushes his
mother into a ravine "too cruel";
Giovanni's final performance in "The
Eyes, The Mouth" turns cruelty to
pity.


After returning to his family's home in Milan at the news of his brother
Pippo's suicide, Giovanni soon finds himself in love with his brother's
former fiance, Vanda.
