## Di Piero resists the suasions of sweet speech 
### W.S. Di Piero 
Early Light

University of Utah Press, 58 pp.
Early in "The Cantos" Ezra Pound
dissolves a reference to the
Neoplatonic philosopher of light into
two passages from Dante:
lambilichus' light, and
the souls ascending,
Sparks like a partridge covey,
Like the "ciocco," brand struck in
the game.
"fit omniformis": Air, fire, the pale
soft light.

W.S. Di Piero's 'Early Light' is a book
to return to, ponder, mull over. In this
gloomy time of referential illusion,
unanchored images, extreme referents,
it's bracing to read a vigorous book
about the perils of abstraction, a book
that is, albeit grudgingly, self
revelatory.

In theory this "impartible light of the
Gods ... is everywhere one and the
same whole and is impartibly present
with all things that are able to partici
pate of it." But in a later, smokier
world, divine sparks and the ambigu
ous undulations of coveys disperse
with something like Brownian mo
tion.

The fire? always, and the vision
always,
Ear dull, perhaps, with the vision
flitting
And fading at will. Weaving with
points of gold. . . .
At moments in Stanford English
Prof. W.S. Di Piero's "Early
Light" we are struck by "Fire's per
fect light / when the dance of outside
is the dance inside/and we all
emerge entirely where we are," but
more often his sceptical emphasis is
on the transitory and occasional

manifestations of "what's near and
going," "unrecorded stars, the happy
chaos cry / of galaxies," and, in the
beautiful conclusion to "Summer in
Winter," "these disorderly
stars, / twisted fiery rags, / glasses,
divine strays."
Di Piero's epigraph, a passage from
Whitehead, declares that a mountain

worn away is gone forever, whereas
"a colour is eternal. It haunts time
like a spirit. It comes and goes. ... It
appears where it is wanted." The
coming and going of the light that
gave Dickinson her "heavenly hurt"
provokes much of the meditative
scrutiny of "Early Light": "light
denied will hurt us, though hurt
us / into greater attention."
The book opens with a fine poem,
"Canada," in which another person is
able to "hear annunciation / in the
passing trace" of a "swoon of Canada
geese" that "widened above
against / the gray unstirred heights."
And in the concluding poem, which
gives the collection its title, he
realizes, after a nostalgic recollection
of Russian Orthodox worshippers
"inside the oniondome's shade," that
their light will not come to him:
"Moon, stars, soon day break
ing, / the grave dream dreamed else
where / never, I now know, for me."
Between these points he describes a
curve in pursuit of spiritual insights
that his own solitary and secular na
ture seems nearly to forbid. Some of
the best of these poems are "To
Suffice," "On Mt. Philo in Novem
ber," "Poor Home," "Late Day,"
"Riverwork," *'The Incineration"
and "Flowering," a poem that looks
back in subject and procedure to Di
Piero's previous book, "The Only
Dangerous Thing."
These poems draw their strength in
part from their resistance to influence
and, more important, from their
resistance to the easy suasions of
sweet speech. They often display a
kind of rudeness in phrase and
rhythm that is meant, I think, to
declare the integrity of the poet's way
of seeing. If I have any reservations
about some of these poems it is that
many of them seem unnecessarily
clotted or constricted: "It's what he
hears / in the infinite covered space
stuffed with song / that curves un
settled inside his desperate ear."
Related to this point of unneces
sary contrivance is the sense I have
that the solitary and demanding na
ture of the poet's calling, in this book
and elsewhere, gets excessive empha
sis. One result is that some of the
poems seem melodramatic ("This is
the Fable" and "Revision"), but a
more fortunate consequence is a kind
of trial of Barthes' proposition that "a
violent drive towards autonomy
destroys any ethical scope." Poems
like "The Husband's Song,"
"Settling" and the"The Call" pro
vide a subplot that tests the conse
quences of self-willed isolation, with
the suggestion that the poet himself
may have conceived of his calling in
terms that are too strait.
"The Call," one of Di Piero's best
poems, opens with the speaker's iso
lation from his family: "They sit and
talk two rooms away, / mother and
daughter in the morning. /I don't
know what they say. ..." Then he
recalls another scene of familial isola

tion: "my parents grumbling in their
room, / words sucked down into the
swamp." The second half of the poem
is a meditation upon Orpheus, who
"could not have known / it wasn't
that bright girl's voice / that called
him. All he knew . . . was his compul
sion / to turn." Preoccupied with his
calling, perhaps he wondered "What
blood-seamed rock/[would]
welcome, then return, her vague
speech. ..." What Eurydice "may

have meant to tell him" is a charge
that rings throughout the rest of the
book:
A man will listen to the worst
and wait, wanting more, because
of what he thinks he needs to know.
You never loved me so much
as you loved voices from the dark.
Pitch and burr were always more
to you than any touch or sight.
For this / loved you, in my way.
For this vou will not know me.

"Early Light" is a book to return
to, ponder, mull over. In this gloomy
time of referential illusions, un
anchored images, and the absence of
external referents, it is bracing to read
a vigorous book about the perils of
abstraction, a book that is, albeit
grudgingly, self-revelatory. "In the
gloom, the gold gathers the light
against it. 1 '
