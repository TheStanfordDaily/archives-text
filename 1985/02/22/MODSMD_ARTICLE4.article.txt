# C-IR discusses further action on South Africa
## 
### KRISTEN CHRISTOPHER Senior staff writer 
In separate actions yesterday, the Commis
sion on Investment Responsibility (C-IR) dis
cussed the possibility of acting against South
African-operating corporations in which
Stanford owns stock, and the United Stanford
Workers (USW) decided to call for the Uni
versity to divest from all corporations which
do business in South Africa.
C-IR member Mark Landesmann said the
commission decided yesterday to draft a letter
to five or six non-signatories of the Sullivan
Principles, a code of ethics for companies that
have plants in South Africa. The C-IR is plan

ning to investigate the non-signatories to
ensure they are adhering to the code, he said.
But C-IR Chairman Richard Brody said,
"We made no decisions. . . . These (the C-IR
actions) are in the middle of being crafted."
Margaret Miller, also a C-IR member, said
the idea of a letter had been discussed at the
meeting and explained that "everybody wants
the same ends, it's just a matter of the
means."
"We're looking at better avenues to investi
gate the companies in the Stanford portfolio,"
Miller said. "The problem in South Africa is
that it's not going anywhere. . . . You have to
look at it case by case."

Stanford currently invests in 21 companies
that have not signed the Sullivan Principles.
"It's difficult to say that pulling out would
improve the situation. ... It might make it
worse; the black leaders do not want a
massive pullout," Miller added.
The C-IR also began "preliminary talks on
shareholder resolutions," Landesmann said.
The C-IR discussed "how to vote on share
holder resolutions," Landesmann said, but
added, "If Stanford votes up or down it
doesn't really matter."
Brody, a political science professor, said he
considers the shareholding issue the topic the
C-IR should be discussing at this time.

At a membership meeting yesterday, USW
voted unanimously to endorse a Black Stu
dent Union call for total divestment from all
corporations that have plants in South Africa.
"We supported the BSU's position on Stan
ford divesting from corporations in South
Africa," said USW President Dennis Blake.
"I don't think the University will consider it
(the USW action) very seriously, but it's one
more section of the Stanford community"
speaking out on the issue, Blake said.
BSU Chair Steve Phillips said his group
opposes the presence of the American corpo
rations in South Africa. "We don't buy the
argument that they (the corporations) are

progressive forces," Phillips said.
Violations of the Sullivan Principles were
not a cause of the BSU's recommendation for
total divestment, said Phillips, who called the
code "ineffective."
He said his group will try to take its call for
total divestment to other universities in the
area, namely UC-Berkeley.
At its Feb. 12 meeting, the Board of Trus
tees decided to follow a C-1R recommenda
tion of conditional divestment from Motorola
Corp., an Illinois-based electronics firm that
in the past has been accused of selling equip
ment to the South African military and police.
