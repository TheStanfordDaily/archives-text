"The Four Wise Men"

Translated by Ralph Manheim
Random House, 255 pp., $8.95.
There are some novels that we read
to remind oureselves who we are and
where we live. Much contemporary
literature fits this description.

However, some novelists choose to
take us outside of ourselves, intro
ducing us to places we'll never see
and characters we'll never know. Of
ten, these works of fantasy and sci
ence fiction rely so heavily on con
fronting us with the unfamiliar that
they forget they are novels and
become wearisome exercises in show
and-tell.

Michel Tournier's revision of the
Nativity story, "The Four Wise
Men," has its feet planted firmly in
the realm of fantasy literature. But
where most fantastic literature
fails, Tournier's work succeeds
beautifully. "The Four Wise Men"
goes as far as a Calvino or Pynchon
novel in proving that there is room in
literature for the fanciful.
Tournier likes to work with
"found" material; the framework of
the novel is taken from the gospel of
Matthew 2:1-16. Modifying the
gospel somewhat, Tournier adds a
fourth king, an "eternal latecomer."
For each king, Tournier gives a
brief "case study" told in the first
person, which explains the king's
journey to the Holy City. Their four
narratives describe entirely different
worlds. Gaspar is African. Balthasar
and Melichor come from the Middle
East, but one is rich and the other im
povershed. Taor, the fourth and im
aginary king, is Indian. What they all
have in common are fatal weaknesses
which eventually drive them out of
their homelands in search of fulfill
ment.
Tournier is a master of description.
By looking through the eyes of the
four kings, he manages to make the
reader see not an ancient, distant
place, but something fresh and im
mediate. When Gaspar happens on
the inhospitable town of Hebron,
which he describes as the oldest town
in the world, we see it as he does:
Gateway of the desert of Idumea,
Hebron mounts guard over three ver
dant little hills, planted with olive, fig
and pomegranite trees. Its white
houses are shut tight. Not a sign of life
emerges from them. Not an open win
dow, not a stitch of laundry drying on
the line, not a living soul in the
narrow-staired streets, not even a dog.
In their narratives, the kings tell
the reader things which they probably
never confessed to their contem
poraries; they are brutally honest
about their weaknesses and failures.
It is these weaknesses which make a
contemporary reader most identify
with the kings. Gaspar, a black man,
is deeply in love with a white slave
who is repelled by his blackness. Bal
thasar has retreated from society,
preferring instead to live in a world of
curios and statues. Melichor,
dethroned by enemies, is both afraid
and vengeful. And Taor is a powerful
man with a powerful sweet tooth.
After the kings reveal themselves
to the reader as people, they are free
to behave as historical figures. They

travel to Jerusalem guided both by
the North Star and their desires. By
the time Tournier is ready to become
historically explicit (three kings, a
stable, ox and so forth), we are so
caught up in the story we don't
question authenticity of the myth.
Tournier pays most attention to the
story of Taor, the fourth king who
arrives late on the scene. Taor travels
to the Holy Land in search of a piece
of candy, and stumbles into the
Nativity. He meets three greatly
changed kings, who tell Taor that
they have seen Christ (Taor assumes
at first they are talking of the Divine
Confectioner), and they plan to dedi
cate their lives to the service of the
child.
Taor's reaction to all of this is per
haps the least engaging part of the
book. Almost immediately, he makes
an uncharacteristic sacrifice for the
sake of a Christ he does not under
stand.
Tournier begins mixing philosophy
and storytelling at the end of his
book; he is making a point by the
time we reach Taor's last, dramatic
vignette, but I'm not sure what it is.
Although Tournier realizes that fan
tasy must be grounded in reality
(particularly in realistic characters),
he fails to explain or justify the faith
of the three kings. In view of the ra
tional, realistic personalities of the
kings, their acts of devotion seem al
most the equivalent of unexplained
flying saucers in the typical science
fiction novel.
Of course, the religious reader
might find the end of the novel
plausible — just as the spiritualist
might believe absolutely in the latest
ghost novel. But within the context of
the story, the religious end of the
novel doesn't seem to work as well as
the realist beginning.
The disappointment I felt at the
end of "The Four Wise Men" is more
a tribute to the excellent beginning
than a putdown of the book; I
enjoyed it immensely. It is one of the
few works I've read recently that
made me pause and reread passages.
Ralph Manheim's translation is
graceful, to say the least, and it didn't
leave me wondering how the book
must have sounded in its original lan
gauge. Hopefully, the other novels in
Random Houses new "Aventura" li
brary of translated contemporary
novels are this well-chosen. "The
Four Wise Men" is like an inexpen
sive vacation — though not a cheap
one. Tournier travels in style.

the North Star and their desires. By
the time Tournier is ready to become
historically explicit (three kings, a
stable, ox and so forth), we are so
caught up in the story we don't
question authenticity of the myth.
Tournier pays most attention to the
story of Taor, the fourth king who
arrives late on the scene. Taor travels
to the Holy Land in search of a piece
of candy, and stumbles into the
Nativity. He meets three greatly
changed kings, who tell Taor that
they have seen Christ (Taor assumes
at first they are talking of the Divine
Confectioner), and they plan to dedi
cate their lives to the service of the
child.
Taor's reaction to all of this is per
haps the least engaging part of the
book. Almost immediately, he makes
an uncharacteristic sacrifice for the
sake of a Christ he does not under
stand.
Tournier begins mixing philosophy
and storytelling at the end of his
book; he is making a point by the
time we reach Taor's last, dramatic
vignette, but I'm not sure what it is.
Although Tournier realizes that fan
tasy must be grounded in reality
(particularly in realistic characters),
he fails to explain or justify the faith
of the three kings. In view of the ra
tional, realistic personalities of the
kings, their acts of devotion seem al
most the equivalent of unexplained
flying saucers in the typical science
fiction novel.
Of course, the religious reader
might find the end of the novel
plausible — just as the spiritualist
might believe absolutely in the latest
ghost novel. But within the context of
the story, the religious end of the
novel doesn't seem to work as well as
the realist beginning.
The disappointment I felt at the
end of "The Four Wise Men" is more
a tribute to the excellent beginning
than a putdown of the book; I
enjoyed it immensely. It is one of the
few works I've read recently that
made me pause and reread passages.
Ralph Manheim's translation is
graceful, to say the least, and it didn't
leave me wondering how the book
must have sounded in its original lan
gauge. Hopefully, the other novels in
Random Houses new "Aventura" li
brary of translated contemporary
novels are this well-chosen. "The
Four Wise Men" is like an inexpen
sive vacation — though not a cheap
one. Tournier travels in style.

"The Four Wise Men"

Translated by Ralph Manheim
Random House, 255 pp., $8.95.
There are some novels that we read
to remind oureselves who we are and
where we live. Much contemporary
literature fits this description.

However, some novelists choose to
take us outside of ourselves, intro
ducing us to places we'll never see
and characters we'll never know. Of
ten, these works of fantasy and sci
ence fiction rely so heavily on con
fronting us with the unfamiliar that
they forget they are novels and
become wearisome exercises in show
and-tell.

Michel Tournier's revision of the
Nativity story, "The Four Wise
Men," has its feet planted firmly in
the realm of fantasy literature. But
where most fantastic literature
fails, Tournier's work succeeds
beautifully. "The Four Wise Men"
goes as far as a Calvino or Pynchon
novel in proving that there is room in
literature for the fanciful.
Tournier likes to work with
"found" material; the framework of
the novel is taken from the gospel of
Matthew 2:1-16. Modifying the
gospel somewhat, Tournier adds a
fourth king, an "eternal latecomer."
For each king, Tournier gives a
brief "case study" told in the first
person, which explains the king's
journey to the Holy City. Their four
narratives describe entirely different
worlds. Gaspar is African. Balthasar
and Melichor come from the Middle
East, but one is rich and the other im
povershed. Taor, the fourth and im
aginary king, is Indian. What they all
have in common are fatal weaknesses
which eventually drive them out of
their homelands in search of fulfill
ment.
Tournier is a master of description.
By looking through the eyes of the
four kings, he manages to make the
reader see not an ancient, distant
place, but something fresh and im
mediate. When Gaspar happens on
the inhospitable town of Hebron,
which he describes as the oldest town
in the world, we see it as he does:
Gateway of the desert of Idumea,
Hebron mounts guard over three ver
dant little hills, planted with olive, fig
and pomegranite trees. Its white
houses are shut tight. Not a sign of life
emerges from them. Not an open win
dow, not a stitch of laundry drying on
the line, not a living soul in the
narrow-staired streets, not even a dog.
In their narratives, the kings tell
the reader things which they probably
never confessed to their contem
poraries; they are brutally honest
about their weaknesses and failures.
It is these weaknesses which make a
contemporary reader most identify
with the kings. Gaspar, a black man,
is deeply in love with a white slave
who is repelled by his blackness. Bal
thasar has retreated from society,
preferring instead to live in a world of
curios and statues. Melichor,
dethroned by enemies, is both afraid
and vengeful. And Taor is a powerful
man with a powerful sweet tooth.
After the kings reveal themselves
to the reader as people, they are free
to behave as historical figures. They

travel to Jerusalem guided both by
the North Star and their desires. By
the time Tournier is ready to become
historically explicit (three kings, a
stable, ox and so forth), we are so
