# Sequoia magazine gives a 'good mix'
## 
### 
The winter edition of Sequoia
— a Stanford University literary
quarterly that publishes short
stories, poetry, criticism and inter
views — has just been issued and
is now available at the Stanford
Bookstore.
Featured are poems by world
renowned poet and political ac
tivist Denise Levertov and by En
glish Prof. Arturo Islas, author of
the recently published "The Rain
God"; fiction by Andrew
Hudgins, a recent Stegner Fellow
in the Creative Writing Depart
ment; an essay by John Felstiner
on "Poetry and Political Experi
ence"; and a long, wide-ranging
interview with controversial poet
James Merrill, author of "The
Changing Light at Sandover," an
Ouija Board trilogy.
According to Gordon Harvey,
the editor of the magazine and a
graduate student in the English
Department, Sequoia is "an at
tempt to bridge the abyss between
the scholarly and creative. Stan
ford has strong communities of
both kinds — and too often they
are isolated from each other."
In his two-year tenure as editor,

Harvey has seen the magazine's
readership expand. Sequoia can
now be found in libraries and
bookstores all over the country.
"Ninety percent of our submis
sions come from other places," he
says, "but the best stuff comes
from the Stanford writers, often
because we solicit material from
them."
In recent issues, Sequoia has
published such important authors
as Seamus Heaney, J.V. Cunnin
gham, Edgar Bowers, Timothy
Steele and Janet Lewis.
Perhaps the most impressive
change Harvey effected has been
the creation of a section of essays
and reviews. "We look for critical
prose that writers might want to
read," he says, "lively pieces that
aren't too limited or specialized."
And likewise, "we're trying to
print short stories that aren't so
mannered that students of
literature wouldn't want to look at
them," Harvey says.
"I think we are providing a good
mix."
