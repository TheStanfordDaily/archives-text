## Freshman Discovery Day draws groups to Branner 
### DEBORAH KEHLE Staff writer 
More than 40 campus organiza
tions set up tables yesterday in Bran
ner Hall's dining room to inform
freshmen about the range of extra
curricular activities available at Stan
ford.
"I knew of very few clubs on
campus 'til I came here," said fresh
man Jeff Mewborne about the club
fair.

The event, billed as "Freshman
Discovery Day," was organized by
Tony James and David Youmans,
advising associates for Branner Hall.
"We try to expand the horizons of
freshmen," said James. Too often
there's a club "blitz" that hits fresh
men, after which there is no further

contact until the following year, he
said.
The advantage of having the Dis
covery Day in February is that
"freshmen are settled into classes,"
Youmans said.
"It's past the fall quarter crazi
ness," said Lynne Mason, one of the
representatives for the Career Plan
ning and Placement Center at the
event.
"You never go to this stuff," said

freshman Mario Queiroz, except
"when they come to you." He cited
the campus sprawl as part of the
deterrent.
"Bringing it here (Branner) makes
it much more accessible," said James.
Freshman Patrick McGannon
agreed, saying, "It has been helpful

that they (the clubs) are all in one
place.
Campus organizations had various
reasons for being there. Felicia Wong
of the Concert Network said her or
ganization wanted to let freshmen
know what it does, to determine frosh
music preferences using surveys and
to "tell them about our spring recruit
ing."
Carolyn Weisz of the Bridge said
she hoped to inform freshmen about
the peer counseling and workshops
her group provides.
The representatives from the
CPPC were concerned about chang
ing the organization's image. "Most
people think it's only for seniors" said
Jessica Herbold, a student represen
tative. Actually, the CPPC provides
help in finding "a wide range" of em
ployment opportunities, she said.
"Don't wait until your senior year" to
come to the CPPC, advised Mason.
The freshmen also had a variety of
reasons for attending. "I just want to
start being involved in the Univer
sity," said freshman Kurt Schreder.
"My friend asked me to come,"
said freshman Eve Hernandez.
"We just wanted to check out what
some of the clubs were," said fresh
man Ellen Meyer. However, she des
cribed the event as "sort of disap
pointing."
Jacqueline Marchan of the Bridge
agreed. Pointing out that she had only
talked to five or six people in a span
of two hours, Marchan blamed the
poor attendance on insufficient ad
vertising. She said few people were
present even when the event began at
noon. "It would have been nicer
outside," she said.
