The Wizard of Oz (1939)
Festival, Palo Alto
Victor Fleming and a trio of writers
(Noel Langley, Florence Ryerson, Edgar
Allen Woolf) turned L. Frank Baum's
beloved children's story into one of
Hollywood's few great musical fantasies.
It triumphs precisely because it is such a
squarely American movie — its heart lies
in the vaudeville/Broadway revue roots
of two of its stars, Bert Lahr (The
Cowardly Lion) and that incomparable
comic dancer Ray Bolger (The
Scarecrow). Judy Garland, then a pudgy,
earnest teenager, sings the Harold
Arlen-E.Y. Harburg songs so sweetly
that the most obstinate hearts crack and
melt. Everyone can recite the cast by
heart: Jack Haley as The Tin Man, Billie
Burke as Glinda the Good Witch of the
North, Clara Blandick and Charley
Grapewin as Auntie Em and Uncle
Henry, and — memorably — Frank Mor
gan as The Wizard and Margaret Hamil
ton as The Wicked Witch of the West.
Bobby Connelly staged the numbers,
Harold Rosson photographed, and
Cedric Gibbons and William A. Horning
supervised the art direction.
Plays through Wednesday with
"Singin' in the Rain."
Five Easy Pieces (1970)
Kresge Auditorium
Bob Rafelson directed this famous
study in end-of-the- 1960s alienation,
from a screenplay by Adrien Joyce. It
was the movie to see when it came out;
Rafelson and Joyce made the fury and
torment of the hero, a gifted pianist who
has turned his back on his aristocratic
family and the promise of a career, ex
tremely romantic, and many at that time
shared his cynical vision of America.
Jack Nicholson's embodiment of this new
kind of angry young man made him a
star. With Susan Anspach and Karen
Black as the two women who can't make
him happy, and Lois Smith, Billy Green
Smith and Fannie Flagg.
Plays tonight at 9.
Rebecca (1940)
Faculty Lounge (Building 300-303)
The Academy Award for best picture
went to this enthralling high-style Got
hic, which was Alfred Hitchcock's first
American movie. The story — about a
bride who returns to her husband's
manor to find that the spirit of his first
wife hovers over everything — is out of
Daphne Du Maurier, adapted by Robert
E. Sherwood and Joan Harrison.
Laurence Olivier plays the haunted
widower, Maxim de Winter; he throws
too many soulful glances, and his perfor
mance doesn't make a great deal of
sense, but he's marvelous to watch
anyway. Joan Fontaine is surprisingly
good as his put-upon second wife. The
vibrant supporting cast includes George
Sanders, Gladys Cooper, Reginald
Denny, Nigel Bruce, Florence Bates, C.
Aubrey Smith, Melville Cooper, Leo G.
Carroll, and Judith Anderson in a classi
cally preposterous, scene-stealing turn as

creepy Mrs. Danver*, de Winter's
housekeeper.
Plays Thursday at 7.
The Deep (1977)
History Corner, Room 2
This movie has a Moray eel, voodoo,
an underwater treasure hunt for buried
heroin and Jacqueline Bisset in a soaked
T-shirt — and still it isn't any good. It is
so openly derivative (of "Jaws," which
came from the pen of the same author,
Peter Benchley, of "Thunderball" and of
"To Have and Have Not," with Eli Wal
lach stuck in the old Walter Brennan
role) that nobody's heart seems to be in it
— not the director's (Peter Yates) or the
editor's (Robert Wolfe) or the actors'.
(There is some suspense in the climactic
underwater battle scene.) Bisset's
starched English beauty and Nick Nolte's
all-American jock good looks are well
matched; they could be the House Beau
tiful couple of 1-977. With Robert Shaw
and Louis Gossett. Tracy Keenan Wynn
collaborated with Benchley on the script
and John Barry contributed a really ob
noxious score.
Plays Thursday at 7 and 9:30.
Annie Hall (1977)
Kresge Auditorium
This Oscar-winner lacks the wild in
ventiveness of Woody Allen's earlier
comedies, but it is warmly funny and
beautifully made. (Gordon Willis shot
it.) Not quite everything it is reputed to
be, "Annie Hall" is nonetheless a focal
movie for many moviegoers who were
between 25 and 35 when it was released:
It seems to locate the source of much of
the anxiety of that generation. Diane
Keaton giv£s a memorable performance
as Annie, and the cast is filled with other
interesting people, too — Colleen
Dewhurst, Shelley Duvall, Janet Mar
golin, Carol Kane, Paul Simon, Christop
her Walken, Tony Roberts and Jeff
Goldblum. Allen co-authored the
screenplay with Marshall Brickman.
Plays tomorrow at 7 and 9.
Invasion of the Body Snatchers
(1956)
U.C. Theater, Berkeley
This is the first film version of the Jack
Finney book, written by Daniel Main
waring and directed by Don Siegel, and it
has a tawdry effectiveness. The premise
is that people are being replaced by
vegetables from another planet — an ap
propriate parable For the conformist'sos.
Kevin McCarthy gives a very intense,
Oscar-bid performance opposite darkly
pretty Dana Wynter, and Sam Peckinpah
has a tiny part. This version isn't as witty

or gorgeous as the remake (directed by
Philip Kaufman) but it is very scary.
Plays Sunday with "The Day the Earth
Stood Still," "The War of the Worlds"
and"The Thing."
Cutter's Way (1981)
U.C. Theater, Berkeley
Originally titled "Cutter and Bone,"
Jeffrey Alan Fiskin's script (out of a
Richard Thornburg novel) revolves
around an embittered Vietnam vet (Alex
Cutter, overplayed by John Heard) and
his best friend (Rich Bone, played by Jeff
Bridges), whom he involves in a crazy
scheme to locate a murderer. Though the
movie has a very dense, hard-to
remember plot (for most of the movie we
don't know if Cutter's accusations are
just paranoid fantasy), the director, Ivan
Passer, tries for a surreal style and a jar

ring, out-of-sync feeling in some se
quences (the opening credits are
amazing); the movie is saturated with
melancholia. Unfortunately, the charac
ters never lighten up, and you realize
you've landed on a dead-end street
within the first five minutes. With Lisa
Eichhorn, employing a tiny tremolo as
Cutter's wife, Stephen Elliott, Ann
Dusenberry and Nina Van Pallandt in a
cameo; beautifully shot by Jordan
Cronenweth.
Plays Wednesday with "Who'll Stop
the Rain?"
Jonah Who Will Be 25 in the Year
2000(1976)
Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley
Too few people know this ineffably
sweet post '60s comedy by the Swiss
director Alain Tanner — a one-of-a-kind

movie about a group of radicals whose
non-conformity binds them. (The closest
equivalent in theme, if not in mood,
among American films would be John
Sayles' "Return of the Secaucus Seven.")
Miou-Miou is a cashier who under
charges her customers; Raymond Bus
sieres is a retired trainman she befriends;
Jacques Denis is an inventive history
teacher; Jean-Luc Bideau is a one-time
political organizer who now specializes in
roulette; Roger Jendly is a primitive
painter and a gardener; Rufus runs a
school in his greenhouse; Myriam
Meziere is into Eastern thought and
Dominique Labourier into organic farm
ing. Part of what makes the movie so
charming is that this octet is naturally
non-conformist; the picture validates any
point of view that affirms life. The spar
kling script, which sustains an astonish
ingly high level of imagination, is by
Tanner and John Berger.
Plays Tuesday evening.
Freaks(l932)
U.C. Theater, Berkeley
Tod Browning's chiller, set in the tan
talizing milieu of the circus, begins with a
prefatory title that begs compassion for
the typically mocked and mistreated un
fortunates compelled to seek employ
ment as sideshow freaks. But the horror
of the picture — and it is one of the
scariest movies Hollywood has ever
produced — is the function of the very
deficiencies and distortions that we were
told should make us sympathetic to these
characters. Willis Goldbeck and Leon
Gordon adapted the fatuous, amateurish
script from a Tod Robbins story called
"Spurs." Olga Baclanova plays the
cheap, manipulative circus star who
marries one of the "freaks," cuckolds
him and elects herself the target of a
'monstrous revenge. Wallace Ford and
Leila Hyams co-star.
Plays Thursday. with "He Who Gets
Slapped."
SingiiT in the Rain (1952)
Festival, Palo Alto
Most people's choice for the bfeft musi
cal film ever made. The script, by IBfuy
Com den and Adolph Green, is in the
tradition'of the great Kaufman and Hart
comedy "Once in a Lifetime": Both are
set in Hollywood in the panicky, hap
hazard days of the early talkies.
(Producer Joseph Schenck once said,
"The trouble with the whole industry is
that it talked before it thought.") Gene
Kelly — who co-directed and co
choreographed, with Stanley Donen —
plays a romantic star of silent pictures
who must make the transition to sound
films along with his partner, Jean
who has the most appalling voice Holly

wood has ever known. (Hagen gives a
classic comic performance.) Donald
O'Connor, whose acrobatic "Make 'Em
Laugh" number is the high point of the
picture, plays his best friend, and Debbie
Reynolds is the girl he loves. As in all of
the memorable M-G-M musicals of this
period, one knockout number follows
another— Kelly's "Singin' in the Rain,"
his duet with Reynolds on "You Were
Meant for Me," "Moses" by Kelly and
O'Connor, etc.
Plays through Wednesday with "The
Wizard of Oz."
Vertigo (1958)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Alfred Hitchcock's film has an eerie,
seductive romanticism; the combination
of a richly suggestive narrative, Kim
Novak's other-worldly beauty in the first
half of the film, the heady Bernard
Herrmann music, and the hypnotic
camerawork in the most famous se
quences is extremely powerful, on a pop
level. Despite what its many devotees
have said of it, the movie doesn't really
address the topics of necrophilia and
death wish (it's more Freudly than
Freudian), but you watch it with the
same fascination and impatience with
which you might read a sexy murder
mystery that keeps you awake half the
night. With James Stewart, who has one
fine scene, as the ex'cop who falls in love
with the haunted woman he was hired to
follow (Novak), and Barbara Bel Geddes
(who gives the best performance). Alec
Coppel and Samuel Taylor adapted the
screenplay from a novel called "D'entre
les Morts" by Pierre Boileau and
Thomas Narcejac; Robert Burks shot it,
in Technicor, in and around San Fran
cisco.
Plays Tuesday and Wednesday with
"Rope."
Diva (1982)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The high-tech chic of this picture, di
rected by Jean-Jacques Beinix and shot
by Philippe Rousselot, is dazzling; all the
surfaces glitter. It's a Versailles of a
movie. Beinix's chief virtue, aside from
his dexterity, is his determination not to
take himself seriously: The witty,
freewheeling way in which he has put the
picture together, making his camera
double back on itself with tantalizing
self-consciousness, seems to be based on
the careless assumption that this little
thriller about stolen tapes is inconse
quential. You can't complain that
"Diva" doesn't mean anything, because
Beinix's style and the weightless, hollow
shimmer of Hilton McConnico's interior
design declare it in every frame. With
Frederic Andrei, who recalls the Jean-
Pierre tscaud of the middle and late '60s;
Thuy who has the unflappable
cool of a Godard gamine; and the black
singer Wilheiminia Wiggins Fernandez.
Beinix and Jean Van Hamme adapted a
novel by Delacorta, and Vladimir Cosma
supplied a terrific jazzy score.
Plays Thursday with "The Family
Game."

you've landed on a dead-end street
within the first five minutes. With Lisa
Eichhorn, employing a tiny tremolo as
Cutter's wife, Stephen Elliott, Ann
Dusenberry and Nina Van Pallandt in a
cameo; beautifully shot by Jordan
Cronenweth.
Plays Wednesday with "Who'll Stop
the Rain?"
Jonah Who Will Be 25 in the Year
2000(1976)
Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley
Too few people know this ineffably
sweet post '60s comedy by the Swiss
director Alain Tanner — a one-of-a-kind

movie about a group of radicals whose
non-conformity binds them. (The closest
equivalent in theme, if not in mood,
among American films would be John
Sayles' "Return of the Secaucus Seven.")
Miou-Miou is a cashier who under
charges her customers; Raymond Bus
sieres is a retired trainman she befriends;
Jacques Denis is an inventive history
teacher; Jean-Luc Bideau is a one-time
political organizer who now specializes in
roulette; Roger Jendly is a primitive
painter and a gardener; Rufus runs a
school in his greenhouse; Myriam
Meziere is into Eastern thought and
Dominique Labourier into organic farm
ing. Part of what makes the movie so
charming is that this octet is naturally
non-conformist; the picture validates any
point of view that affirms life. The spar
kling script, which sustains an astonish
ingly high level of imagination, is by
Tanner and John Berger.
Plays Tuesday evening.
Freaks(l932)
U.C. Theater, Berkeley
Tod Browning's chiller, set in the tan
talizing milieu of the circus, begins with a
prefatory title that begs compassion for
the typically mocked and mistreated un
fortunates compelled to seek employ
ment as sideshow freaks. But the horror
of the picture — and it is one of the
scariest movies Hollywood has ever
produced — is the function of the very
deficiencies and distortions that we were
told should make us sympathetic to these
characters. Willis Goldbeck and Leon
Gordon adapted the fatuous, amateurish
script from a Tod Robbins story called
"Spurs." Olga Baclanova plays the
cheap, manipulative circus star who
marries one of the "freaks," cuckolds
him and elects herself the target of a
'monstrous revenge. Wallace Ford and
Leila Hyams co-star.
Plays Thursday. with "He Who Gets
Slapped."
SingiiT in the Rain (1952)
Festival, Palo Alto
Most people's choice for the bfeft musi
cal film ever made. The script, by IBfuy
Com den and Adolph Green, is in the
tradition'of the great Kaufman and Hart
comedy "Once in a Lifetime": Both are
set in Hollywood in the panicky, hap
hazard days of the early talkies.
(Producer Joseph Schenck once said,
"The trouble with the whole industry is
that it talked before it thought.") Gene
Kelly — who co-directed and co
choreographed, with Stanley Donen —
plays a romantic star of silent pictures
who must make the transition to sound
films along with his partner, Jean
who has the most appalling voice Holly

wood has ever known. (Hagen gives a
classic comic performance.) Donald
O'Connor, whose acrobatic "Make 'Em
Laugh" number is the high point of the
picture, plays his best friend, and Debbie
Reynolds is the girl he loves. As in all of
the memorable M-G-M musicals of this
period, one knockout number follows
another— Kelly's "Singin' in the Rain,"
his duet with Reynolds on "You Were
Meant for Me," "Moses" by Kelly and
O'Connor, etc.
Plays through Wednesday with "The
Wizard of Oz."
Vertigo (1958)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Alfred Hitchcock's film has an eerie,
seductive romanticism; the combination
of a richly suggestive narrative, Kim
Novak's other-worldly beauty in the first
half of the film, the heady Bernard
Herrmann music, and the hypnotic
camerawork in the most famous se
quences is extremely powerful, on a pop
level. Despite what its many devotees
have said of it, the movie doesn't really
address the topics of necrophilia and
death wish (it's more Freudly than
Freudian), but you watch it with the
same fascination and impatience with
which you might read a sexy murder
mystery that keeps you awake half the
night. With James Stewart, who has one
fine scene, as the ex'cop who falls in love
with the haunted woman he was hired to
follow (Novak), and Barbara Bel Geddes
(who gives the best performance). Alec
Coppel and Samuel Taylor adapted the
screenplay from a novel called "D'entre
les Morts" by Pierre Boileau and
Thomas Narcejac; Robert Burks shot it,
in Technicor, in and around San Fran
cisco.
Plays Tuesday and Wednesday with
"Rope."
Diva (1982)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The high-tech chic of this picture, di
rected by Jean-Jacques Beinix and shot
by Philippe Rousselot, is dazzling; all the
surfaces glitter. It's a Versailles of a
movie. Beinix's chief virtue, aside from
his dexterity, is his determination not to
take himself seriously: The witty,
freewheeling way in which he has put the
picture together, making his camera
double back on itself with tantalizing
self-consciousness, seems to be based on
the careless assumption that this little
thriller about stolen tapes is inconse
quential. You can't complain that
"Diva" doesn't mean anything, because
Beinix's style and the weightless, hollow
shimmer of Hilton McConnico's interior
design declare it in every frame. With
Frederic Andrei, who recalls the Jean-
Pierre tscaud of the middle and late '60s;
Thuy who has the unflappable
cool of a Godard gamine; and the black
singer Wilheiminia Wiggins Fernandez.
Beinix and Jean Van Hamme adapted a
novel by Delacorta, and Vladimir Cosma
supplied a terrific jazzy score.
Plays Thursday with "The Family
Game."

The Wizard of Oz (1939)
Festival, Palo Alto
Victor Fleming and a trio of writers
(Noel Langley, Florence Ryerson, Edgar
Allen Woolf) turned L. Frank Baum's
beloved children's story into one of
Hollywood's few great musical fantasies.
It triumphs precisely because it is such a
squarely American movie — its heart lies
in the vaudeville/Broadway revue roots
of two of its stars, Bert Lahr (The
Cowardly Lion) and that incomparable
comic dancer Ray Bolger (The
Scarecrow). Judy Garland, then a pudgy,
earnest teenager, sings the Harold
Arlen-E.Y. Harburg songs so sweetly
that the most obstinate hearts crack and
melt. Everyone can recite the cast by
heart: Jack Haley as The Tin Man, Billie
Burke as Glinda the Good Witch of the
North, Clara Blandick and Charley
Grapewin as Auntie Em and Uncle
Henry, and — memorably — Frank Mor
gan as The Wizard and Margaret Hamil
ton as The Wicked Witch of the West.
Bobby Connelly staged the numbers,
Harold Rosson photographed, and
Cedric Gibbons and William A. Horning
supervised the art direction.
Plays through Wednesday with
"Singin' in the Rain."
Five Easy Pieces (1970)
Kresge Auditorium
Bob Rafelson directed this famous
study in end-of-the- 1960s alienation,
from a screenplay by Adrien Joyce. It
was the movie to see when it came out;
Rafelson and Joyce made the fury and
torment of the hero, a gifted pianist who
has turned his back on his aristocratic
family and the promise of a career, ex
tremely romantic, and many at that time
shared his cynical vision of America.
Jack Nicholson's embodiment of this new
kind of angry young man made him a
star. With Susan Anspach and Karen
Black as the two women who can't make
him happy, and Lois Smith, Billy Green
Smith and Fannie Flagg.
Plays tonight at 9.
Rebecca (1940)
Faculty Lounge (Building 300-303)
The Academy Award for best picture
went to this enthralling high-style Got
hic, which was Alfred Hitchcock's first
American movie. The story — about a
bride who returns to her husband's
manor to find that the spirit of his first
wife hovers over everything — is out of
Daphne Du Maurier, adapted by Robert
E. Sherwood and Joan Harrison.
Laurence Olivier plays the haunted
widower, Maxim de Winter; he throws
too many soulful glances, and his perfor
mance doesn't make a great deal of
sense, but he's marvelous to watch
anyway. Joan Fontaine is surprisingly
good as his put-upon second wife. The
vibrant supporting cast includes George
Sanders, Gladys Cooper, Reginald
Denny, Nigel Bruce, Florence Bates, C.
Aubrey Smith, Melville Cooper, Leo G.
Carroll, and Judith Anderson in a classi
cally preposterous, scene-stealing turn as

creepy Mrs. Danver*, de Winter's
housekeeper.
Plays Thursday at 7.
The Deep (1977)
History Corner, Room 2
This movie has a Moray eel, voodoo,
an underwater treasure hunt for buried
heroin and Jacqueline Bisset in a soaked
T-shirt — and still it isn't any good. It is
so openly derivative (of "Jaws," which
came from the pen of the same author,
Peter Benchley, of "Thunderball" and of
"To Have and Have Not," with Eli Wal
lach stuck in the old Walter Brennan
role) that nobody's heart seems to be in it
— not the director's (Peter Yates) or the
editor's (Robert Wolfe) or the actors'.
(There is some suspense in the climactic
underwater battle scene.) Bisset's
starched English beauty and Nick Nolte's
all-American jock good looks are well
matched; they could be the House Beau
tiful couple of 1-977. With Robert Shaw
and Louis Gossett. Tracy Keenan Wynn
collaborated with Benchley on the script
and John Barry contributed a really ob
noxious score.
Plays Thursday at 7 and 9:30.
Annie Hall (1977)
Kresge Auditorium
This Oscar-winner lacks the wild in
ventiveness of Woody Allen's earlier
comedies, but it is warmly funny and
beautifully made. (Gordon Willis shot
it.) Not quite everything it is reputed to
be, "Annie Hall" is nonetheless a focal
movie for many moviegoers who were
between 25 and 35 when it was released:
It seems to locate the source of much of
the anxiety of that generation. Diane
Keaton giv£s a memorable performance
as Annie, and the cast is filled with other
interesting people, too — Colleen
Dewhurst, Shelley Duvall, Janet Mar
golin, Carol Kane, Paul Simon, Christop
her Walken, Tony Roberts and Jeff
Goldblum. Allen co-authored the
screenplay with Marshall Brickman.
Plays tomorrow at 7 and 9.
Invasion of the Body Snatchers
(1956)
U.C. Theater, Berkeley
This is the first film version of the Jack
Finney book, written by Daniel Main
waring and directed by Don Siegel, and it
has a tawdry effectiveness. The premise
is that people are being replaced by
vegetables from another planet — an ap
propriate parable For the conformist'sos.
Kevin McCarthy gives a very intense,
Oscar-bid performance opposite darkly
pretty Dana Wynter, and Sam Peckinpah
has a tiny part. This version isn't as witty

or gorgeous as the remake (directed by
Philip Kaufman) but it is very scary.
Plays Sunday with "The Day the Earth
Stood Still," "The War of the Worlds"
and"The Thing."
Cutter's Way (1981)
U.C. Theater, Berkeley
Originally titled "Cutter and Bone,"
Jeffrey Alan Fiskin's script (out of a
Richard Thornburg novel) revolves
around an embittered Vietnam vet (Alex
Cutter, overplayed by John Heard) and
his best friend (Rich Bone, played by Jeff
Bridges), whom he involves in a crazy
scheme to locate a murderer. Though the
movie has a very dense, hard-to
remember plot (for most of the movie we
don't know if Cutter's accusations are
just paranoid fantasy), the director, Ivan
Passer, tries for a surreal style and a jar

ring, out-of-sync feeling in some se
quences (the opening credits are
amazing); the movie is saturated with
melancholia. Unfortunately, the charac
ters never lighten up, and you realize
you've landed on a dead-end street
within the first five minutes. With Lisa
Eichhorn, employing a tiny tremolo as
Cutter's wife, Stephen Elliott, Ann
Dusenberry and Nina Van Pallandt in a
cameo; beautifully shot by Jordan
Cronenweth.

Five Easy Pieces (1970)
Kresge Auditorium
Bob Rafelson directed this famous
study in end-of-the- 1960s alienation,
from a screenplay by Adrien Joyce. It
was the movie to see when it came out;
Rafelson and Joyce made the fury and
torment of the hero, a gifted pianist who
has turned his back on his aristocratic
family and the promise of a career, ex
tremely romantic, and many at that time
shared his cynical vision of America.
Jack Nicholson's embodiment of this new

Black as the two women who can't make
him happy, and Lois Smith, Billy Green
Smith and Fannie Flagg.

Rebecca (1940)
Faculty Lounge (Building 300-303)
The Academy Award for best picture
went to this enthralling high-style Got
hic, which was Alfred Hitchcock's first
American movie. The story — about a
bride who returns to her husband's
manor to find that the spirit of his first
wife hovers over everything — is out of
Daphne Du Maurier, adapted by Robert
E. Sherwood and Joan Harrison.
Laurence Olivier plays the haunted
widower, Maxim de Winter; he throws
too many soulful glances, and his perfor
mance doesn't make a great deal of
sense, but he's marvelous to watch
anyway. Joan Fontaine is surprisingly
good as his put-upon second wife. The
vibrant supporting cast includes George
Sanders, Gladys Cooper, Reginald
Denny, Nigel Bruce, Florence Bates, C.
Aubrey Smith, Melville Cooper, Leo G.
Carroll, and Judith Anderson in a classi
cally preposterous, scene-stealing turn as

creepy Mrs. Danver*, de Winter's
housekeeper.
Plays Thursday at 7.
The Deep (1977)
History Corner, Room 2
This movie has a Moray eel, voodoo,
an underwater treasure hunt for buried
heroin and Jacqueline Bisset in a soaked
T-shirt — and still it isn't any good. It is
so openly derivative (of "Jaws," which
came from the pen of the same author,
Peter Benchley, of "Thunderball" and of
"To Have and Have Not," with Eli Wal
lach stuck in the old Walter Brennan
role) that nobody's heart seems to be in it
— not the director's (Peter Yates) or the
editor's (Robert Wolfe) or the actors'.
(There is some suspense in the climactic
underwater battle scene.) Bisset's
starched English beauty and Nick Nolte's
all-American jock good looks are well
matched; they could be the House Beau
tiful couple of 1-977. With Robert Shaw

Invasion of the Body Snatchers
(1956)
U.C. Theater, Berkeley
This is the first film version of the Jack
Finney book, written by Daniel Main
waring and directed by Don Siegel, and it
has a tawdry effectiveness. The premise
is that people are being replaced by
vegetables from another planet — an ap
propriate parable For the conformist'sos.
Kevin McCarthy gives a very intense,
Oscar-bid performance opposite darkly
pretty Dana Wynter, and Sam Peckinpah
has a tiny part. This version isn't as witty

or gorgeous as the remake (directed by
Philip Kaufman) but it is very scary.
Plays Sunday with "The Day the Earth

and"The Thing."
Cutter's Way (1981)
U.C. Theater, Berkeley
Originally titled "Cutter and Bone,"
Jeffrey Alan Fiskin's script (out of a
Richard Thornburg novel) revolves
around an embittered Vietnam vet (Alex
Cutter, overplayed by John Heard) and
his best friend (Rich Bone, played by Jeff
Bridges), whom he involves in a crazy
scheme to locate a murderer. Though the
movie has a very dense, hard-to
remember plot (for most of the movie we
don't know if Cutter's accusations are
just paranoid fantasy), the director, Ivan
Passer, tries for a surreal style and a jar

ring, out-of-sync feeling in some se
quences (the opening credits are
amazing); the movie is saturated with
melancholia. Unfortunately, the charac
ters never lighten up, and you realize
you've landed on a dead-end street
within the first five minutes. With Lisa
Eichhorn, employing a tiny tremolo as
Cutter's wife, Stephen Elliott, Ann
Dusenberry and Nina Van Pallandt in a

Cronenweth.
Plays Wednesday with "Who'll Stop

Jonah Who Will Be 25 in the Year
2000(1976)
Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley
Too few people know this ineffably
sweet post '60s comedy by the Swiss
director Alain Tanner — a one-of-a-kind

movie about a group of radicals whose
non-conformity binds them. (The closest
equivalent in theme, if not in mood,
among American films would be John
Sayles' "Return of the Secaucus Seven.")
Miou-Miou is a cashier who under
charges her customers; Raymond Bus
sieres is a retired trainman she befriends;
Jacques Denis is an inventive history
teacher; Jean-Luc Bideau is a one-time
political organizer who now specializes in
roulette; Roger Jendly is a primitive
painter and a gardener; Rufus runs a
school in his greenhouse; Myriam
Meziere is into Eastern thought and
Dominique Labourier into organic farm
ing. Part of what makes the movie so
charming is that this octet is naturally
non-conformist; the picture validates any
point of view that affirms life. The spar
kling script, which sustains an astonish
ingly high level of imagination, is by
Tanner and John Berger.
Plays Tuesday evening.
Freaks(l932)
U.C. Theater, Berkeley
Tod Browning's chiller, set in the tan
talizing milieu of the circus, begins with a
prefatory title that begs compassion for
the typically mocked and mistreated un
fortunates compelled to seek employ
ment as sideshow freaks. But the horror
of the picture — and it is one of the
scariest movies Hollywood has ever
produced — is the function of the very
deficiencies and distortions that we were
told should make us sympathetic to these
characters. Willis Goldbeck and Leon
Gordon adapted the fatuous, amateurish
script from a Tod Robbins story called
"Spurs." Olga Baclanova plays the
cheap, manipulative circus star who
marries one of the "freaks," cuckolds
him and elects herself the target of a
'monstrous revenge. Wallace Ford and
Leila Hyams co-star.
Plays Thursday. with "He Who Gets
Slapped."
SingiiT in the Rain (1952)
Festival, Palo Alto
Most people's choice for the bfeft musi
cal film ever made. The script, by IBfuy
Com den and Adolph Green, is in the
tradition'of the great Kaufman and Hart
comedy "Once in a Lifetime": Both are
set in Hollywood in the panicky, hap
hazard days of the early talkies.
(Producer Joseph Schenck once said,
"The trouble with the whole industry is
that it talked before it thought.") Gene
Kelly — who co-directed and co
choreographed, with Stanley Donen —
plays a romantic star of silent pictures
who must make the transition to sound
films along with his partner, Jean
who has the most appalling voice Holly

wood has ever known. (Hagen gives a
classic comic performance.) Donald
O'Connor, whose acrobatic "Make 'Em
Laugh" number is the high point of the
picture, plays his best friend, and Debbie
Reynolds is the girl he loves. As in all of
the memorable M-G-M musicals of this
period, one knockout number follows
another— Kelly's "Singin' in the Rain,"
his duet with Reynolds on "You Were
Meant for Me," "Moses" by Kelly and
O'Connor, etc.
Plays through Wednesday with "The
Wizard of Oz."
Vertigo (1958)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Alfred Hitchcock's film has an eerie,
seductive romanticism; the combination
of a richly suggestive narrative, Kim
Novak's other-worldly beauty in the first
half of the film, the heady Bernard
Herrmann music, and the hypnotic
camerawork in the most famous se
quences is extremely powerful, on a pop
level. Despite what its many devotees
have said of it, the movie doesn't really
address the topics of necrophilia and
death wish (it's more Freudly than
Freudian), but you watch it with the
same fascination and impatience with
which you might read a sexy murder
mystery that keeps you awake half the
night. With James Stewart, who has one
fine scene, as the ex'cop who falls in love
with the haunted woman he was hired to
follow (Novak), and Barbara Bel Geddes
(who gives the best performance). Alec
Coppel and Samuel Taylor adapted the
screenplay from a novel called "D'entre
les Morts" by Pierre Boileau and
Thomas Narcejac; Robert Burks shot it,
in Technicor, in and around San Fran
cisco.
Plays Tuesday and Wednesday with
"Rope."
Diva (1982)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The high-tech chic of this picture, di
rected by Jean-Jacques Beinix and shot
by Philippe Rousselot, is dazzling; all the
surfaces glitter. It's a Versailles of a
movie. Beinix's chief virtue, aside from
his dexterity, is his determination not to
take himself seriously: The witty,
freewheeling way in which he has put the
picture together, making his camera
double back on itself with tantalizing
self-consciousness, seems to be based on
the careless assumption that this little
thriller about stolen tapes is inconse
quential. You can't complain that
"Diva" doesn't mean anything, because
Beinix's style and the weightless, hollow
shimmer of Hilton McConnico's interior
design declare it in every frame. With
Frederic Andrei, who recalls the Jean-
Pierre tscaud of the middle and late '60s;
Thuy who has the unflappable
cool of a Godard gamine; and the black
singer Wilheiminia Wiggins Fernandez.
Beinix and Jean Van Hamme adapted a
novel by Delacorta, and Vladimir Cosma
supplied a terrific jazzy score.
Plays Thursday with "The Family
Game."

The Wizard of Oz (1939)
Festival, Palo Alto
Victor Fleming and a trio of writers
(Noel Langley, Florence Ryerson, Edgar
Allen Woolf) turned L. Frank Baum's
beloved children's story into one of
Hollywood's few great musical fantasies.
It triumphs precisely because it is such a
squarely American movie — its heart lies
in the vaudeville/Broadway revue roots
of two of its stars, Bert Lahr (The
Cowardly Lion) and that incomparable
comic dancer Ray Bolger (The
Scarecrow). Judy Garland, then a pudgy,
earnest teenager, sings the Harold
Arlen-E.Y. Harburg songs so sweetly
that the most obstinate hearts crack and
melt. Everyone can recite the cast by
heart: Jack Haley as The Tin Man, Billie
Burke as Glinda the Good Witch of the
North, Clara Blandick and Charley
Grapewin as Auntie Em and Uncle
Henry, and — memorably — Frank Mor
gan as The Wizard and Margaret Hamil

Jonah Who Will Be 25 in the Year
2000(1976)
Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley
Too few people know this ineffably
sweet post '60s comedy by the Swiss
director Alain Tanner — a one-of-a-kind

movie about a group of radicals whose
non-conformity binds them. (The closest
equivalent in theme, if not in mood,
among American films would be John
Sayles' "Return of the Secaucus Seven.")
Miou-Miou is a cashier who under
charges her customers; Raymond Bus
sieres is a retired trainman she befriends;
Jacques Denis is an inventive history
teacher; Jean-Luc Bideau is a one-time
political organizer who now specializes in
roulette; Roger Jendly is a primitive
painter and a gardener; Rufus runs a
school in his greenhouse; Myriam
Meziere is into Eastern thought and
Dominique Labourier into organic farm
ing. Part of what makes the movie so
charming is that this octet is naturally
non-conformist; the picture validates any
point of view that affirms life. The spar
kling script, which sustains an astonish
ingly high level of imagination, is by
Tanner and John Berger.
Plays Tuesday evening.
Freaks(l932)
U.C. Theater, Berkeley
Tod Browning's chiller, set in the tan
talizing milieu of the circus, begins with a
prefatory title that begs compassion for
the typically mocked and mistreated un
fortunates compelled to seek employ
ment as sideshow freaks. But the horror
of the picture — and it is one of the
scariest movies Hollywood has ever
produced — is the function of the very
deficiencies and distortions that we were
told should make us sympathetic to these
characters. Willis Goldbeck and Leon
Gordon adapted the fatuous, amateurish
script from a Tod Robbins story called
"Spurs." Olga Baclanova plays the
cheap, manipulative circus star who
marries one of the "freaks," cuckolds
him and elects herself the target of a
'monstrous revenge. Wallace Ford and
Leila Hyams co-star.
Plays Thursday. with "He Who Gets
Slapped."
SingiiT in the Rain (1952)
Festival, Palo Alto
Most people's choice for the bfeft musi
cal film ever made. The script, by IBfuy
Com den and Adolph Green, is in the
tradition'of the great Kaufman and Hart
comedy "Once in a Lifetime": Both are
set in Hollywood in the panicky, hap
hazard days of the early talkies.
(Producer Joseph Schenck once said,
"The trouble with the whole industry is
that it talked before it thought.") Gene
Kelly — who co-directed and co
choreographed, with Stanley Donen —
plays a romantic star of silent pictures
who must make the transition to sound
films along with his partner, Jean
who has the most appalling voice Holly

wood has ever known. (Hagen gives a
classic comic performance.) Donald
O'Connor, whose acrobatic "Make 'Em
Laugh" number is the high point of the
picture, plays his best friend, and Debbie
Reynolds is the girl he loves. As in all of
the memorable M-G-M musicals of this
period, one knockout number follows
another— Kelly's "Singin' in the Rain,"
his duet with Reynolds on "You Were
Meant for Me," "Moses" by Kelly and
O'Connor, etc.
Plays through Wednesday with "The
Wizard of Oz."
Vertigo (1958)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Alfred Hitchcock's film has an eerie,
seductive romanticism; the combination
of a richly suggestive narrative, Kim
Novak's other-worldly beauty in the first
half of the film, the heady Bernard
Herrmann music, and the hypnotic
camerawork in the most famous se
quences is extremely powerful, on a pop
level. Despite what its many devotees
have said of it, the movie doesn't really
address the topics of necrophilia and
death wish (it's more Freudly than
Freudian), but you watch it with the
same fascination and impatience with
which you might read a sexy murder
mystery that keeps you awake half the
night. With James Stewart, who has one
fine scene, as the ex'cop who falls in love
with the haunted woman he was hired to
follow (Novak), and Barbara Bel Geddes
(who gives the best performance). Alec
Coppel and Samuel Taylor adapted the
screenplay from a novel called "D'entre
les Morts" by Pierre Boileau and
Thomas Narcejac; Robert Burks shot it,
in Technicor, in and around San Fran
cisco.
Plays Tuesday and Wednesday with
"Rope."
Diva (1982)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The high-tech chic of this picture, di
rected by Jean-Jacques Beinix and shot
by Philippe Rousselot, is dazzling; all the
surfaces glitter. It's a Versailles of a
movie. Beinix's chief virtue, aside from
his dexterity, is his determination not to
take himself seriously: The witty,
freewheeling way in which he has put the
picture together, making his camera
double back on itself with tantalizing
self-consciousness, seems to be based on
the careless assumption that this little
thriller about stolen tapes is inconse
quential. You can't complain that
"Diva" doesn't mean anything, because
Beinix's style and the weightless, hollow
shimmer of Hilton McConnico's interior
design declare it in every frame. With
Frederic Andrei, who recalls the Jean-
Pierre tscaud of the middle and late '60s;
Thuy who has the unflappable
cool of a Godard gamine; and the black
singer Wilheiminia Wiggins Fernandez.
Beinix and Jean Van Hamme adapted a
novel by Delacorta, and Vladimir Cosma
supplied a terrific jazzy score.
Plays Thursday with "The Family
Game."
