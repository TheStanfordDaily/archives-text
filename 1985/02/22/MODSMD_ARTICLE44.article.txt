## Construction continues with still more planned 
### BAIE NETZER Senior staff writer 
In addition to construction work that began here last
summer and continues in some places, the upcoming
year promises another $ 11 million of campus improve
ments.
The $10.6 million package of improvements for
1985-86 was approved by the Board of Trustees at a
meeting last week. The total includes $3.25 million for
parking structures, $500,000 for roads, paths and
lighting and $5 million for campus" utility systems.
Owing to an increase in traffic, the stretch of Santa
Teresa Street that lies between Lomita Drive and
Campus Drive West will be repaved. But because the
street runs in front of Lagunita Court, Roble Hall and
Governor's Corner, work will not begin until the sum
mer, according to John Lerry, project manager for the
Santa Teresa improvement.
Lerry said construction on Santa Teresa would have
to be scheduled around an important summer program
whose participants reside in Lagunita. Construction
will presumably begin after Commencement and may
be done by the start of fall quarter, he said.
Other road improvements approved by the trustees
include the extension of Roth Way from Lomita to
Palm Drive and the straightening of the intersection of
Lomita Drive and Campus Drive.
The largest single project scheduled for 1985-86 is
the start of work on a parking structure at the intersec
tion of Roth Way and Campus Drive West near the

museum and the chemistry buildings. Although the
trustees voted $3.25 million for initial funding, the
total cost of the project is estimated at $8 million to
$10 million. The cost of an interim parking lot needed
to replace spaces lost during construction is estimated
at $250,000.
The Board of Trustees also approved $200,000 in
special projects. Among these are the visual screening
of the Tresidder Union loading dock, the installation of
islands at the intersection of Lomita and Santa Teresa,
and reforestation.
To prevent possible flooding of Governors Corner,
the overflow channel of Lake Lagunita will be
regraded and the dam will be strengthened.
The east-side path of Palm Drive and the West
Campus parking lot will receive lighting. Improve
ments in pedestrian and bicycle paths along Campus
Drive, from Encina Gym to Maples Pavilion and from
Via Ortega to Panama Street, will cost $15,000.
The road improvements approved by the trustees
will be funded through fees on residential real estate
development. A charge on facilities projects will cover
the cost of the parking structures.
Scheduled improvements also include installation of
emergency electrical power at the new Children's
Hospital, the replacement of deteriorated steam lines
and water mains, and a new storm sewer at Campus
Drive East designed to protect Braun Music Center
and Green Library.
