# Ely explains proposal in letter
## Law students act on aid cuts 
### CAMERON KALLER Senior staff writer 
In the wake of proposed cuts in federal financial aid.
Law School Dean John Ely has circulated a memorandum
to law students urging them to write the president and
their congressional representatives to "make their views
known" on the subject.
In addition, the Stanford Law Association has sched
uled a rally for next Thursday and Friday to gather
signatures from all University students for petitions pro
testing the proposed budget cuts. The petitions will be
sent to district congressmen, federal senators and the
president, according to Barbara Biagas, vice president of
the association.
In his Feb. 13 memo, Ely indicated that "the $4,000
cap on federal aid would probably have the greatest im
pact on law students."
"It the federal assistance that each student receives
were to be capped at $4,000, this would mean a loss of
$829,955 in federal funds to Stanford Law School stu
dents," according to the memo.
Biagas said, "Basically we're going to have a petition
expressing our disapproval and fear regarding the budget
cuts and the repercussions that would occur."
"Our formal reaction was that people would pick up the
memo from Ely, think that they ought to do this, and then
stick it in a drawer where it wouldn't turn up until April.
We thought it would be a lot easier for law students to do
it this way," Biagas said.
Biagas stressed that the group wants to gather
signatures from all students, not just law students. "We'd
love to get the entire undergraduate population to sign the
petitions," she said.
Law School students clearly will not be the only ones
touched by the budget cuts if they pass without any modi
fications. Many undergraduates as well as graduate stu
dents in the Business and Medical Schools would also be
greatly affected, according to Biagas.
Fifth-year senior Sara Davis said that if she "were en

tering now as an undergraduate, there would be no way
that 1 could afford tuition if I didn't have the GSLs
(Guaranteed Student Loans). Without them, I never
would have made it."
"It's a penny-wise, pound-foolish idea," said Ted Tues
cher, a first-year graduate student in Health Services Re
search.
"The problem with this particular cut is that it has some
serious welfare implication. . . . The only people who will
be able to afford the excellent schools will be those from
wealthy backgrounds. The cuts should somehow be scaled
so those with higher demands have a higher cutoff level.
"Even with some scaling, many people are still going to
be inhibited from applying," he said.
Biagas also said she "didn't know how the graduate
schools are going to keep admissions policies independent
of students' ability to pay."
Gordon Wright, a third-year law school student, con
tradicted the general opposition to the cuts, however. "I
don't know that they'll do that much [that is] negative,"
he said.
Wright expressed concern about where "they're
drawing the line," but said, "On the other hand, I have
seen abuses of the program that cause me to raise
eyebrows."
"1 tend to be more in favor of the budget cuts than
against them," he said. "If everybody else is taking a 'shot
in the arm,' so should we."
But he added that he doesn't feel "really strongly one
way or the other. ... I have no problem with Ely urging
students to write letters ... to get some support."
The changes as outlined in the memo are: (1) that no
student receive more than $4,000 per year in federal aid;
(2) that students from families with incomes greater than
$32,500 receive no in-school interest subsidy for federally
guaranteed student loans; (3) that the interest rate for
Guaranteed Student Loans be set at the rate of 91-day T
bills; and (4) that the federal interest subsidies paid to
lenders be reduced, making the loans less attractive to
lenders.
