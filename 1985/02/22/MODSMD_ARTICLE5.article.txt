# Profs, win science award

Eight Stanford science and engineering faculty have
been named Young Investigators for 1985 by the National
Science Foundation (NSF). The awards are given each
year to 200 U.S. university scholars who have received
doctorates within the last seven years.
Stanford's award winners are David Freyberg, assistant
professor of civil engineering; Gerald Fuller, assistant
professor of chemical engineering; Mark Horowitz; assis
tant professor of electrical engineering ; and lain Johnson,
assistant professor of statistics.
Also Michael Pirrung, assistant professor of chemistry;
Peter Sarnak, associate professor of mathematics; Rich
ard Schcller, assistant professor of biological sciences; and
Raymond Seed, assistant professor of civil engineering.
In its second year, the Young Investigator program
recognizes individuals of outstanding potential in research
and teaching. The honor can firing up to $500,000 in re
search funds to each recipient over the course of five
years.
Stanford was exceeded in award winners only by UC-
Berkeley, with 17 recipients. MIT with 10 and Cornell
with nine.
The awards are intended to address the problem of
growing faculty shortages in the highly competitive fields
of engineering and the physical sciences. Of the 200
awards, more than three quarters went to scholars in engi
neering and the physical sciences.
Each recipient will receive $25,000 a year from the
NSF. The foundation will pay up to $37,500 per year to
match the contributions given by industry sources. The

total support available from the award is $100,000 a year
for five years, with the individual universities responsible
for raising the non-federal funds. Up to $10,000 a year
may be used for indirect costs.
Michael Pirrung, 29, received his doctorate in 1980
from UC-Berkeley and has been at Stanford since 1981.
Pirrung's research centers on organic synthesis and bio
organic chemistry. He is currently investigating the
biosynthesis of ethylene, a plant-ripening hormone. Some
of his work also uses biosynthetic processes to create small
organic molecules useful in disease treatment.
Pirrung is very pleased with the award, as it will relieve
some pressure to get grant money, the limiting factor in
research, he explained. It will also allow him to expand his
lab, adding more post-doctoral assistants.
Gerald Fuller, 31, a resident fellow in Rinconada,
received his doctorate in chemical engineering from the
California Institute of Technology in 1980. His work on
the fluid mechanics of polymer liquids is directed toward
understanding the processes that allow complex molecules
like polymers to flow. While a lot of research is done to
measure the mechanical properties of the polymers. Fuller
plans to use his award money to develop new optical tech
niques to detect changes in light in flowing polymers.
David Frevburg, 35, received his doctorate in civil engi
neering from Stanford in 1981. Freyburg researches
ground-water contamination involving hazardous or
ganisms and flow through porous rock. He intends to use
his award to support graduate students in the field and to
purchase materials necessarv in his own research.
Richard Scheller, 31, also received his doctorate from
Cal Tech in 1980. Scheller, who just returned from over
seas, said that he was very glad to get the award and that
the money would be very helpful. His research at Stanford
centers on understanding the processes of gene expression
in nerve cells and eventually tie down the molecular
changes involved in learning and memory.
Scheller is also the recipient of the $100,000 Esther A.
and Joseph Klingenstin Fellowship in the Neurosciences
and a young investigator award from the Society of
Neuroscience.
lain Johnson, 28, received his doctorate in statistics from
Cornell in 1981. Johnson researches statistical techniques
suggested by computer-intensive data analysis. He is also
interested in the mathematical connections and charac
terizations of resulting classical decision theory. The
money will probably be used for graduate student training
and equipment.

Peter Sarnak, 31, received his doctorate in mathematics
from Stanford in 1980. Sarnak is an authority on analytic
number theory, especially prime numbers. His teaching
covers all levels from beginning calculus to advanced
graduate courses and the direction of doctoral disserta
tions.
Sarnak was said he was "obviously delighted" with the
award; he plans to use the money to invite scholars to
Stanford and develop regular summer mathematics con
ferences.
Mark Horowitz is in the Electrical Engineering Depart
ment; his research is centered on integrated circuit design
and computer tools for integrated circuits. Horowitz is not
sure yet how the money will be used. "I have been inter
ested in doing some work in CAD (computer-assisted)
tool design for integrated circuits as well as interconnect
technology for integrated circuits," he said.
Raymond Seed, 28, received his doctorate from UC-
Berkeley in 1983. His areas of expertise in civil engineer
ing include soil dynamics, earthquake engineering and soil
structure interaction.
