# Two talk on danger from cults
## 
### MARK LAWRENCE 
"There are thousands of
destructive groups and cults you are
vulnerable to," Adrian Greek told
an audience of 120 last night in the
Roble Hall lounge.
He and his wife Ann, co
directors of the Positive Action
Center, a counseling organization
for cult victims and their families in
Portland. Ore., gave the first in a
series of five presentations on mind
control and cults co-sponsored by
Roble Hall and Residential Educa
tion.
The Greeks became concerned
with the nearly 3,000 "destructive
cults" operating in the United
States and founded their own cen
ter after two of their own children
— one a Stanford student —
became members of the Unification
Church of the Rev. Sun

Myung Moon.
Moon is the self-proclaimed
Messiah allegedly bent on world
rule.
The Greeks also helped start the
Citizens' Freedom Foundation, a
national cult-awareness network
with more than 60 affiliates.
According to Ann Greek, these
organizations help "get people
back on their feet again and back
on their way" after thev or some

one in their families has become in
volved in a cult.
In their presentation, the GreelA
first shared the experiences of their
two children who became in
doctrinated by the Moonies, and
then explained that they believe
cults use mind control and
manipulation to brainwash healthy,
educated people.
