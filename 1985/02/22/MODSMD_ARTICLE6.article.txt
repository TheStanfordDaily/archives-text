# Two talk on danger from cults
## 
### MARK LAWRENCE 
"There are thousands of
destructive groups and cults you are
vulnerable to," Adrian Greek told
an audience of 120 last night in the
Roble Hall lounge.
He and his wife Ann, co
directors of the Positive Action
Center, a counseling organization
for cult victims and their families in
Portland. Ore., gave the first in a
series of five presentations on mind
control and cults co-sponsored by
Roble Hall and Residential Educa
tion.
The Greeks became concerned
with the nearly 3,000 "destructive
cults" operating in the United
States and founded their own cen
ter after two of their own children
— one a Stanford student —
became members of the Unification
Church of the Rev. Sun

Myung Moon.
Moon is the self-proclaimed
Messiah allegedly bent on world
rule.
The Greeks also helped start the
Citizens' Freedom Foundation, a
national cult-awareness network
with more than 60 affiliates.
According to Ann Greek, these
organizations help "get people
back on their feet again and back
on their way" after thev or some

one in their families has become in
volved in a cult.
In their presentation, the GreelA
first shared the experiences of their
two children who became in
doctrinated by the Moonies, and
then explained that they believe
cults use mind control and
manipulation to brainwash healthy,
educated people.

Ann Greek, co-director of the Positive Action Center, speaks to a
Roble Hall audience last night on the dangers of cults and their
mind-control tactics.
Ann Greek told the audience
that in October 1975 their son Phil,
then a Stanford student, became a
Moonie after being recruited on
campus by a "really cute girl."
Greek said the girl showed great
interest in Phil, described by his
mother as an active, athletic, "all
around OK guy." They "spent a
couple of hours talking" before she
invited him to her "family's" house
in San Francisco for dinner, Greek
said.
Phil accepted and found that the
girl's "family" was a group of
young people. They gave him a
warm welcome, and Greek said her
son felt that the people he met
"seemed to really care about each
other."
The dinner was followed by a
lecture and slide show including
idealized pictures of "The Land," a
farm 100 miles north of San Fran
cisco. Phil was invited to spend an

inexpensive weekend there. He did
go for the weekend, quit school
and, following a 21-week in
doctrination period, became a
Moonie.
Only after Phil came home 15
months later were the Greeks able
to get him out of the Moonies by
obtaining a temporary guardianship
from an Oregon court and carefully
"deprogramming" him, Ann Greek
said.
In his time as a Moonie, Phil —
like all members of that cult —
worked as a fund-raiser for the
Unification Church and as a
recruiter of new members. One of
his successful recruits was his sister,
who was attending a small college
in Spokane, Wash., at the time.
Ann Greek said of her son's
deprogramming, "We feel it's a real
success." Phil returned to Stanford
and now works as a musician.
The Greeks' daughter, however,
has been a Moonie now for nine
years and "has been moved all over
the United States and Canada."
Adrian Greek said, "Destructive

cults use very sophisticated mind
control to use a person's mind
against his very self," and because
"most (cults) become a church or
religion, they seem legitimate."
He went on to explain the many
factors of cult indoctrination that
he believes make people suscepti
ble. "Cults create an impossible
magical dream, something which
they say they can provide for you.
When you fail, it's your fault —
you're not doing enough," he said.
In this way, cult members are
caught in a vicious cycle that keeps
them working for the good of the
cult while never being able to
realize the "dream."
Adrian Greek explained that
cults create a "polarization of the
world into two extremes — good
and bad." The good and God are
associated with the cult and the bad
and Satan with the outside world.
Greek said that cult members
hesitate to leave because of the
belief that "people on the outside
are not going to be saved, that
they're not good people."
