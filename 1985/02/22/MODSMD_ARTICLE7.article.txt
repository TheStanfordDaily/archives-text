Mexico protests border searches
WASHINGTON — Friction over stepped-up border searches for a
kidnapped U.S. drug agent flared yesterday into a full-blown diplomatic
dispute, with Mexico filing a formal protest and U.S. drug officials com
plaining that a court in Guadalajara is hampering their investigation.
Mexican Ambassador Jorge Espinosa, expressing his government's
>'deep concern" in a protest note delivered to Deputy Secretary of State
Kenneth Dam, complained that the border crackdown is "inconsistent
with the spirit of'friendship and understanding."
U.S. officials indicated that the thorough searches of Mexican
registered automobiles crossing the border may be relaxed soon, prob
ably in an announcement by U.S. Ambassador John Gavin, who is in
Washington for consultations.
The searches were instituted last week mainly in an effort to turn up
clues in the Feb. 7 disappearance in Guadalajara of Drug Enforcement
Administration agent Enrique Camarena. But U.S. officials acknowl
edge privately that the step also was designed to put pressure on
Mexican authorities to vigorously investigate the kidnapping.
An announcement of steps "to make sure the flow of automobile traf
fic (over the border) is maintained" is expected in the next few days, ac
cording to Alan Nelson, commissioner of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service.
At the same time, however, DEA officials expressed extreme frustra
tion over a Mexican federal court's invoking of amparo, the legal equiva
lent of a writ of habeas corpus, on behalf of suspected drug traffickers in
Guadalajara.
The suspects' claim of amparo, which U.S. officials familiar with the
case said had blocked the questioning of 10 to 12 suspects, has so
stymied DEA investigators that the agency took the highly unusual step
of summoning home Edward Heath, its top official in Mexico.
Earlier in the investigation, Attorney General William French Smith
cabled his counterpart in Mexico to protest the response of Mexican offi
cials to Camarena's abduction. In addition, President Reagan has writ
ten to Mexican President Miguel de la Madrid expressing his concern.
Thatcher berates New Zealand
WASHINGTON — British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
sharply criticized yesterday New Zealand's refusal to permit a port call
by a U.S. destroyer because the United States would not say whether it
was carrying nuclear weapons, and she vowed that she would not dis
close whether British warships had similar armaments.
Thatcher's vigorous criticism of the decision by the Wellington gov*
ernment was the first time during her three-day U.S. visit that she had
commented on the issue, which has deeply divided the ANZUS alliance,
composed of Australia, New Zealand and the United States.
"I was as disappointed as you" at the position taken by New Zealand
Prime Minister David Lange, she told a questioner at a news conference
at the British Embassy. "He knows my view: that all our ships are
seconded (committed) to NATO, and I have no intention of revealing
whether nuclear weaponry is part of their armory."
Britain and other members of the Commonwealth share defense ties
as well as political ones, and Thatcher warned that those allies should
not ask questions involving British ships' nuclear capabilities.
"And, if they ask, I won't say," she declared. But, she added, "I
should be very disappointed if our naval ships cannot visit New
Zealand."
Thatcher cast doubt on whether Lange's decision — which he is ex
pected to defend during a visit to the United States next week — is sup
ported by his own public, saying, "The people of New Zealand are very
close to the people of Great Britain."
Islamic fundamentalists lose ground
KUWAIT — Islamic fundamentalism, regarded since the Iranian
Revolution as a potent and growing political force throughout the Mos
lem world, has suffered a setback in elections for Kuwait's tiny but in
fluential legislature.
Election returns made public yesterday indicated that the two prin
cipal spokesmen for the fundamentalist movement in Kuwait, Khaled
Sultan and Issa Shaheen, lost their re-election bids for seats in the Na
tional Assembly.
With 50 elected members and 15 appointed by the executive, the Na
tional Assetnbly is the only functioning parliament in the oil-rich Arab
states that line the Persian Gulf.
Two candidates with leanings toward Sunni Moslem fundamentalism
were elected in other districts, helping to offset the losses by Sultan, a
leader of the Islamic Revival Society, and Shaheen, head of the Social
Reform Society, a leading fundamentalist group.
However, two Shia Moslem fundamentalists were defeated and
replaced by Shias with what diplomats described as less sectarian and
more moderate views.
Diplomatic analysts said the failure of the Kuwaiti fundamentalists,
who scored major gains in the last election in 1981, to expand their
power base in Kuwait suggested that their influence may have reached a
plateau.
"Islam is now a secondary issue," said a Western diplomat who asked
that he not be identified by name. "The perception in Kuwaiti society is
that the tide of fundamentalism has peaked and turned."
Israelis raid Lebanese villages
JERUSALEM — Israeli troops killed one guerrilla yesterday and
confiscated a large number of weapons in raids on four tillages in occu
pied southern Lebanon, an Israeli army spokesman said.
Thirteen houses, allegedly belonging to anti-Israeli Shia Moslems,
were destroyed and a number of persons involved in recent attacks on
Israeli forces in southern Lebanon were arrested in the villages, the army
spokesman said.
The action was monitored by French troops of the United Nations
peacekeeping force in Southern Lebanon. The spokesman said the four
villages were chosen for the raids because a number of Israeli soldiers
had died during bomb attacks in the area.
Armed guerrillas were traced to Deir Qanoun al Nahr and one was
killed in a shootout and two others injured, the spokesman said.
In Esrerje, a number of suspects were arrested and four houses
detonated, and in Arab-Slim, a large Shia town along the Litani River,
eight homes were destroyed, the spokesman said.
The four towns raided yesterday are situated east of the occupied port
city of Tyre. 1
An Israeli spokesman said the troops had left the villages before sun
set but further raids would be made during the next few days in search of
Shia guerrillas.
Soviets spending less on defense?
WASHINGTON — The Soviet Union's defense expenditures have
been growing about 2 percent a year since 1976, a slower rate than ear
lier believed and a much slower rate than overall U.S. defense outlays,
according to a Central Intelligence Agency report released yesterday.
In the continuation of an intelligence dispute, the CIA estimate of So
viet spending also conflicts with a much higher Defense Department es
timate that made headlines last June and with various Pentagon state
ments citing an unrelenting Soviet buildup as the justification for U.S.
military increases.
Sen. William Proxmire of Wisconsin, ranking Democrat on the Joint
Economic subcommittee that released the CIA estimate, said, "It is time
for Washington to take official notice that Soviet military procurement
has been stagnant for the past seven years and to stop acting like nothing
has changed." The subcommittee's senior Republican has not been des
ignated.
" Before 1976, growth in total (Soviet) defense spending had averaged
about 4 to 5 percent per year; after 1976. the rate of increase in spend
ing dropped appreciably, to about 2 percent a year," Robert Gates, CIA
deputy director for intelligence, testified to the international trade,
finance and security economics subcommittee in a secret session last
Nov. 21.
The CIA testimony, which has since been declassified for public
release, said the "main source" of the slowdown in Soviet military
growth was "a stagnation in spending for military procurement since
1976."

Islamic fundamentalists lose ground
KUWAIT — Islamic fundamentalism, regarded since the Iranian
Revolution as a potent and growing political force throughout the Mos
lem world, has suffered a setback in elections for Kuwait's tiny but in
fluential legislature.
Election returns made public yesterday indicated that the two prin
cipal spokesmen for the fundamentalist movement in Kuwait, Khaled
Sultan and Issa Shaheen, lost their re-election bids for seats in the Na
tional Assembly.
With 50 elected members and 15 appointed by the executive, the Na
tional Assetnbly is the only functioning parliament in the oil-rich Arab
states that line the Persian Gulf.
Two candidates with leanings toward Sunni Moslem fundamentalism
were elected in other districts, helping to offset the losses by Sultan, a
leader of the Islamic Revival Society, and Shaheen, head of the Social
Reform Society, a leading fundamentalist group.
However, two Shia Moslem fundamentalists were defeated and
replaced by Shias with what diplomats described as less sectarian and
more moderate views.
Diplomatic analysts said the failure of the Kuwaiti fundamentalists,
who scored major gains in the last election in 1981, to expand their
power base in Kuwait suggested that their influence may have reached a
plateau.
"Islam is now a secondary issue," said a Western diplomat who asked
that he not be identified by name. "The perception in Kuwaiti society is
that the tide of fundamentalism has peaked and turned."
Israelis raid Lebanese villages
JERUSALEM — Israeli troops killed one guerrilla yesterday and
confiscated a large number of weapons in raids on four tillages in occu
pied southern Lebanon, an Israeli army spokesman said.
Thirteen houses, allegedly belonging to anti-Israeli Shia Moslems,
were destroyed and a number of persons involved in recent attacks on
Israeli forces in southern Lebanon were arrested in the villages, the army
spokesman said.
The action was monitored by French troops of the United Nations
peacekeeping force in Southern Lebanon. The spokesman said the four
villages were chosen for the raids because a number of Israeli soldiers
had died during bomb attacks in the area.
Armed guerrillas were traced to Deir Qanoun al Nahr and one was
killed in a shootout and two others injured, the spokesman said.
In Esrerje, a number of suspects were arrested and four houses
detonated, and in Arab-Slim, a large Shia town along the Litani River,
eight homes were destroyed, the spokesman said.
The four towns raided yesterday are situated east of the occupied port
city of Tyre. 1
An Israeli spokesman said the troops had left the villages before sun
set but further raids would be made during the next few days in search of
Shia guerrillas.
Soviets spending less on defense?
WASHINGTON — The Soviet Union's defense expenditures have
been growing about 2 percent a year since 1976, a slower rate than ear
lier believed and a much slower rate than overall U.S. defense outlays,
according to a Central Intelligence Agency report released yesterday.
In the continuation of an intelligence dispute, the CIA estimate of So
viet spending also conflicts with a much higher Defense Department es
timate that made headlines last June and with various Pentagon state
ments citing an unrelenting Soviet buildup as the justification for U.S.
military increases.
Sen. William Proxmire of Wisconsin, ranking Democrat on the Joint
Economic subcommittee that released the CIA estimate, said, "It is time
for Washington to take official notice that Soviet military procurement
has been stagnant for the past seven years and to stop acting like nothing
has changed." The subcommittee's senior Republican has not been des
ignated.
" Before 1976, growth in total (Soviet) defense spending had averaged
about 4 to 5 percent per year; after 1976. the rate of increase in spend
ing dropped appreciably, to about 2 percent a year," Robert Gates, CIA
deputy director for intelligence, testified to the international trade,
finance and security economics subcommittee in a secret session last
Nov. 21.
The CIA testimony, which has since been declassified for public
release, said the "main source" of the slowdown in Soviet military
growth was "a stagnation in spending for military procurement since
1976."
Mexico protests border searches
WASHINGTON — Friction over stepped-up border searches for a
kidnapped U.S. drug agent flared yesterday into a full-blown diplomatic
dispute, with Mexico filing a formal protest and U.S. drug officials com
plaining that a court in Guadalajara is hampering their investigation.
Mexican Ambassador Jorge Espinosa, expressing his government's
>'deep concern" in a protest note delivered to Deputy Secretary of State
Kenneth Dam, complained that the border crackdown is "inconsistent
with the spirit of'friendship and understanding."
U.S. officials indicated that the thorough searches of Mexican
registered automobiles crossing the border may be relaxed soon, prob
ably in an announcement by U.S. Ambassador John Gavin, who is in
Washington for consultations.
The searches were instituted last week mainly in an effort to turn up
clues in the Feb. 7 disappearance in Guadalajara of Drug Enforcement
Administration agent Enrique Camarena. But U.S. officials acknowl
edge privately that the step also was designed to put pressure on
Mexican authorities to vigorously investigate the kidnapping.
An announcement of steps "to make sure the flow of automobile traf
fic (over the border) is maintained" is expected in the next few days, ac
cording to Alan Nelson, commissioner of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service.
At the same time, however, DEA officials expressed extreme frustra
tion over a Mexican federal court's invoking of amparo, the legal equiva
lent of a writ of habeas corpus, on behalf of suspected drug traffickers in
Guadalajara.
The suspects' claim of amparo, which U.S. officials familiar with the
case said had blocked the questioning of 10 to 12 suspects, has so
stymied DEA investigators that the agency took the highly unusual step
of summoning home Edward Heath, its top official in Mexico.
Earlier in the investigation, Attorney General William French Smith
cabled his counterpart in Mexico to protest the response of Mexican offi
cials to Camarena's abduction. In addition, President Reagan has writ
ten to Mexican President Miguel de la Madrid expressing his concern.
Thatcher berates New Zealand
WASHINGTON — British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
sharply criticized yesterday New Zealand's refusal to permit a port call
by a U.S. destroyer because the United States would not say whether it
was carrying nuclear weapons, and she vowed that she would not dis
close whether British warships had similar armaments.
Thatcher's vigorous criticism of the decision by the Wellington gov*
ernment was the first time during her three-day U.S. visit that she had
commented on the issue, which has deeply divided the ANZUS alliance,
composed of Australia, New Zealand and the United States.
"I was as disappointed as you" at the position taken by New Zealand
Prime Minister David Lange, she told a questioner at a news conference
at the British Embassy. "He knows my view: that all our ships are
seconded (committed) to NATO, and I have no intention of revealing
whether nuclear weaponry is part of their armory."
Britain and other members of the Commonwealth share defense ties
as well as political ones, and Thatcher warned that those allies should
not ask questions involving British ships' nuclear capabilities.
"And, if they ask, I won't say," she declared. But, she added, "I
should be very disappointed if our naval ships cannot visit New
Zealand."
Thatcher cast doubt on whether Lange's decision — which he is ex
pected to defend during a visit to the United States next week — is sup
ported by his own public, saying, "The people of New Zealand are very
close to the people of Great Britain."
