# Reagan eyes farm policy changes

### 
WASHINGTON — President Reagan said last
night he would not "pull the rug out . . . instantly"
from under the nation's farmers, but that govern
ment agricultural programs have not worked and
he wants to return the "farm economy into the free
marketplace."
He said he plans to retain his controversial
budget director, David Stockman, who angered
embattled farmers by questioning their right to
government bailouts. "I can understand a fellow
blowing his cool," Reagan said of Stockman.
Asked if he wanted Stockman to stay on the job,
Reagan said yes.
At the first news conference of his second term in
office, Reagan also said his goal in Nicaragua is to
remove the Sandinista government "in the sense of
its present structure," but said he would not seek to
oust the government "if they say uncle."
"It is not a government chosen by the people . . .
we believe we have an obligation to be of help
where we can . .. and we're going to try to per
suade the Congress that we can legitimately go for
ward," he said.
Congress last year imposed a ban on covert aid to
the Nicaraguan rebels known as "contras" and
Reagan has said he will seek to reinstate the finan
cial assistance.
And Reagan said he will decide in a couple of
months whether the United States will join the So

viet Union "in violating" the unratified SALT II
arms control treaty.
The administration previously had alleged that
Moscow had violated the treaty, which was
negotiated in 1979, by, among other things, testing
two new kinds of missiles when only one 'was
allowed. The Soviets have denied it.
Reagan also renewed his calls for Congress to
pass tax overhaul legislation this year, and to sum
mon the "political courage" needed to enact his
program of spending cuts.
With the Senate embroiled in a dispute over
emergency aid to cash-strapped farmers, the presi
dent told the nationally televised news conference
he supports a "short-term" program including
$650 million in loans and loan guarantees.
In addition, he said his administration would be
presenting legislation on Friday "hopefully getting
the farm economy back into the free marketplace."
"We won't pull the rug out from under anyone
instantly" who relies on government programs, he
said. But, the president added quickly, "the gov
ernment programs did not succeed. Many of the
problems they (farmers) face today are the result of
government involvement."
Reagan also repeated his opposition to a tax in
crease, saying, "that issue was debated and decided
on Nov. 6. We intend to pioceed with the
mandate" he received when he was re-elected in a
49-state landslide.

The president strode into the East Room of the
White House with a smile on his face to begin the
question-and-answer session, and read a prepared
statement claiming that 1984 had seen "the
strongest performance in a single year in the Amer
ican economy since 1951," with economic growth
slightly under 7 percent.
The Commerce Department's latest statistics
showed the gross national product, the broadest
measure of economic health, grew at a robust 4.9
percent rate from October through December.
"We intend to prolong and to protect this expan
sion," Reagan said, declaring that "historic (tax
overhaul) legislation can and should be passed this
year."
Reagan has called on Congress to enact nearly
$50 billion in spending cuts in his 1986 fiscal year
budget, and while many of his proposals have
provoked sharp controversy in Congress, he said,
"protecting recovery will require political
courage."
Since his last news conference, six weeks ago,
Reagan was inaugurated for a second term and
proposed a fiscal 1986 budget calling for sweeping
cuts in federal spending for nearly everything but
defense and elimination of some well-entrenched
programs, including the Small Business Adminis
tration and the national passenger railroad
Amtrak.
