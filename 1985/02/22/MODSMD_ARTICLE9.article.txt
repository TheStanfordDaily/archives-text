# Soviets allow on-site inspections

### 
VIENNA, Austria — In a move
that could influence future arms con
trol negotiations, the Soviet Union
formally agreed yesterday to allow in
ternational on-site inspection of some
domestic nuclear reactors.
The accord between the Soviet
government and the Vienna-based
International Atomic Energy
Agency, which permits agency in
spectors to personally check a limited
number of civilian Soviet nuclear
plants, marks only the second time
that Moscow has formally agreed to
independent verification.
The first such Soviet commitment,
contained in a pact in the mid-1970s
covering peaceful nuclear explosions
with the United States, was never
tested because the United States did
not ratify the treaty.
Ostensibly, yesterday's inspection
agreement is only aimed at confirm
ing that fuel from the reactors is not
being redirected for military use.
But because only some of Mos
cow's approximately 40 civilian nu
clear plants and none of its military
reactors will be subject to the accord,
it is largely a symbolic gesture in non

proliferation terms, bringing the
Soviets level with the three Western
nuclear-power states — the United
States, Britain and France — which
already permit such controls.
However, some Western diplomats
here believe that Soviet acceptance of
the principle of on-site inspection in
such a sensitive area could eventually
be used as leverage with Moscow in
future arms control negotiations to
win commitments for closely super
vised on-site checks.
Others, however, noting that the
new inspection agreement, which
permits the Soviets to choose which
plants are checked, is a far cry from
effective arms control verification.
That, they said, would require Mos
cow to open up areas labeled as suspi
cious by the United States.
"You can see it as a step in the
right direction," a Western diplomat
with experience in the disarmanent
field said. "Beyond that, it's hard to
tell."
Soviet refusal to accept stringent
verification has been a key stumbling
block in negotiations on reductions of

conventional forces in Europe. The nearly three years ago and it has
