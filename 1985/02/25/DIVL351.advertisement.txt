We ask your support in denouncing the apartheid system in South Africa, join people all over
the country to protest the moral indecency that the people of South Africa are suffering under
this government. Come to our program for up to date information and discussion on what we
can do and how the struggle in South Africa relates to our own struggle for freedom.
STOP THE RACIST SOUTH AFRICAN GOVERNMENT'S
OPPRESSION OF THE BLACK MAJORITY!
