Gasoline prices rise
LOS ANGELES — The rising cost of
wholesale gasoline nudged pump prices up for
the first time since October, signaling the end of a
gas price war that gave motorists the lowest
prices since 19N0, an industry analyst said yester
day.
The average retail price nationwide for all
grades of gasoline rose a half-cent per gallon to
just under $1.14 during the past two weeks, Dan
Lundberg said.

Regular unleaded was selling for $1.09 per gal
lon at self-serve pumps, while premium unleaded
was selling for $1.23 per gallon, Lundberg said.
The average price for leaded regular was $1.01
per gallon.
A Memphis, Tenn., dealer offered the lowest
price nationwide — 91.9 cents for regular leaded
at self-serve pumps.
"As modest as a half-cent increase is,"
Lundberg said, it is the first dealer response to a
month of climbing wholesale costs.

The wholesale price for all grades of gasoline
increased 1.6 cents per gallon during the past two
weeks, Lundberg said. •
Today's weather
The sun will continue to shine in the Stanford
area today, with highs in the mid 60s to mid 70s
range. Low clouds will hug the coastline. The af
ternoon will bring northerly winds from 10 to 20
mph in velocity. Tonight's lows will be in the mid
40s to mid 50s range.
