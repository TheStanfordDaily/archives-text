## English Prof. Packer writes on 'small canvas' 
### BARBARA SCHULER Staff writer 
"I didn't choose Stanford, I didn't
choose teaching. ... I often think my
career is a matter of leaning against a
door and somebody accidently un
latched it and I fell in."
To many who have been in class
with English Prof. Nancy Packer, this
revelation may come as a surprise.
Her animated, information-packed
lectures have become legendary, and
her dedication to teaching seems the
certain outgrowth of a natural calling.
Yet it wasn't until relatively late in
her life that, without much
premeditation, she "fell into" teach
ing.
It was her fiction which first earned
Packer an entree into the English De
partment. Having received one of the
coveted Stegner Fellowships in crea
tive writing, Packer proceeded to
make a real tan of writing-program
founder and then director Wallace
Stegner.
Stegner describes Packer's
"complete, unsentimental directness"
as what initially attracted him to her
writing. "Every story she writes is a
kind of probe, a surgical operation,"
he says.
Having started writing at the age of
24, Packer was 27 when her first pub
lished story, "Povera Baby," ap
peared in Harper's Magazine. Since
then, she says, "I've published 30
stories. That's not much to show for
(the ensuing years) — I'm very un
prolific."
Stegner puts it another way: "Her
writing has been, shall we say,
frugal. . . . She simply doesn't tell a
story until she has a story to tell, just
as she doesn't open her mouth unless
she has something to say."
John L'Heureux, the writing pro
gram's current director, echoes this
assessment of Packer and her fiction.
"She has a view of life that is
largely uncompromising. And, of
course, living life for any of us neces
sarily involves compromise, and
sometimes moral compromise, and I
think that what happens . . . through
out all her fiction is an attempt to deal
with this essentially tragic situation —

that we want to be good, we want to
do good, and we aren't and we don't.
"Also, her stories are a lot of fun.
That should be said in addition to all
this heavy-handed stuff," L'Heureux
concludes.
The majority of Packer's stories
have appeared in literary quarterlies,
but she insists she hasn't shunned the
commercial magazines. On the con
trary, she says she would "love to"
publish in them.
"I'm not going to bend a sentence
for a commercial magazine, but if I
could make the New Yorker, I'd be
delighted. Money, fame, yeah, I'd be
delighted. ... 1 want fame and
fortune . . . but on my terms."
Packer's view of her own fiction
sheds light on the title she chose for
her 1976 collection of stories, "Small
Moments." She says that some
people, her son among them, cannot
always appreciate the "small canvas"
on which she works.
She calls her work "just boy
meets-girl type stuff. Well, not boy
meets girl, but middle-aged woman
meets middle-aged man. ... I'm not
talking about Western civilization, I
don't have a large canvas. It's a small
one, human relations on a fairly im
mediate, individual level.
"I don't want to compare myself —
obviously I don't — with Jane Aus
ten, but she talks about the little piece
of ivory, the little miniature on which
she writes her works. And there are
people who think that's trivial, and
that Stendhal talking about the "Red
and the Black" is larger, has more
depth, more intellectuality. Maybe.
Maybe."
Despite Packer's conviction about
what she wants to do in her fiction,
she says that criticism does matter to
her. "You mean does it hurt my
feelings? Yeah, you bet. I've only
published one book (ot my own
stories). And I got only one negative
review, and it's the only one I remem
ber. I remember the name of the guy
who did it, where it appeared, and
what he said. And the things that
were pretty good ... I don't remem
ber them." Her concession is wistful,
and she shrugs slightly.

Influenced by "probably every
body I've ever read," Packer
says that although "it sounds terribly
old-fashioned and old hat and all that,
Chekhov is the writer I'd like to be
like."
Packer would also like to publish a
novel someday, but "I don't seem to
be able to think that way," she says.
"Some people are sprinters and some
are marathoners and I don't seem to
have the endurance or something. I
see things in 1 2-page units."
Packer took the step from author
to teacher in 1960 when, having
finished her year as a Stegner Fellow,
she was offered the follow-up prize —
a position as a Jones lecturer leading
undergraduate fiction-writing
workshops.
She admits that all her reasons for
accepting the appointment were not
the most noble. She felt she had to get

a job to justify hiring someone to help
around the house. "I really started
teaching so I wouldn't have to do the
housework," she says.
But it seemed to grow on her. "I
liked teaching, and I liked that teach
ing particularly," she says. She
remained an ad hoc lecturer until
1968, when she was named an assis
tant professor. Three years later,
upon Stegner's retirement, she took
over teaching the class for which cur
rent students know her best, "The
Development of the Short Story."
For both style and content, the
class gets rave reviews. One non-
English major who enrolled this
quarter said. "My roommate took her
class on the novel last spring and he
said she was great. It's true. She's
feisty and robust, and a very enter
taining lecturer."
But along with het reputation for

lively lectures usually goes the caveat
that she is a tough and demanding
teacher. According to a former teach
ing assistant for the class, this is part
of the course's draw. "It's popular be
cause it's a serious course and you
come away with a lot."
This TA qualifies the conventional
wisdom about Packer's standards:
"It's true, she's extremely demanding
. . . but 1 think an adjective that
describes her even better is fair.'
She's not erratic at all. But Nancy is
very tough and I think she likes stu
dents to believe that."
Packer confirms this guess.
"1 try to be demanding and 1 think
I am demanding and people complain
about it. . . . But when I got student
evaluations back from my novel class,
two people said they spent much less
time on my course than average. That
just infuriated me, and boy, next
quarter,' Duck!'"
First offered last spring, Packer's
class on the novel is one of her favor
ite recent projects because she has
"had to work so hard on it."
Hard work is the way she explains
her relaxed classroom style. "In front
of the class 1 do seem pretty spontan
eous because I'm not bound to my
notes. The reason I'm not is because
I've been studying all morning."
One creative writing major in the
short story class says her spontaneity
is one of the qualities which make her
such an endearing figure.
"Sometimes she'll get to something
that seems boring and everyone
senses it. And so does she, and she
just says 'Let's skip this.' "
Although she enjoys the challenge
of her lecture classes, Packer regrets
that her contact with undergraduate
fiction-writing students has been lim
ited to such large classes.
"I feel kind of lost there," she says.
"It used to be that even seven, eight
years ago, there was not a single crea
tive writing major 1 had not had in
[workshop]. ... I knew them and I
don't know any of them anymore, ex
cept very occasionally and mostly on
their initiative."
Stegner attests to her "great rap

port" with students, saying they
"practically lived in her pocket. They
were always around and found her
very easy to be with."
Packer attempts to counter the dis
tance that lecture classes impose by
inviting students to evening gather
ings at her house. "I must say that al
most every quarter, I'm feeling busy,
and i think maybe 1 won't do it. And
then 1 see the faces out there and I'd
sort of like to get to know them and I
think they have a right to get to be
known," Packer laughs. "Also, once
you start something like that, it ain't
easy to quit."
Although she is not on intimate
terms with as many of the English
majors as she has been, Packer likes
what she sees in the department
today. "I look at them and 1 see that
they're not pre-yuppies, or at least
not yet pre-yuppies, or at least recog
nize that there's something in the
world besides yuppie-ism, and that
really pleases me a lot."
Before coming to the Stanford En
glish Department, Packer's career
had taken her in several directions.
She is a one-time theology instructor,
mother of two, and was, briefly, a
congressional aspirant.
Daughter of the former Alabama
Rep. George Huddleston, Packer
spent the first 12 years of her life in
Washington, D.C., where politics got
into her blood. When she was in her
late 2()s she contemplated running for
the 9th district seat vacated by her
father nearly two decades earlier. She
abdicated the race, however, in favor
of her brother, whose subsequent vic
tory appeared more likely in the
195()s South.
She seems puzzled by her drift
away from organized politics. "1 do
consider myself political and I'm
surprised at how unpolitical my ac
tions are. I guess it's the same thing as
with women," Packer says, referring
to her minimal involvement with such
developments as the Feminist Studies
Program.
"I guess I haven't been as active as
a woman on the faculty as I might

have been, and I don't even want to
try to analyze why," she says wryly.
"My spirit's always been there,
though."
Many at Stanford would disagree
with Packer's assessment of her ac
tions as "unpolitical." According to
academic secretary Clara Bush, "She
has the reputation of being a respon
sible, incisive and productive person
in the governance of the University."
But perhaps the most visible exam
ple of her political acumen has been
at the department level. Her unprece
dented success in reforming the
Freshman English Program has
brought accolades from her col
leagues.
Her predecessor in the job, Wilfred
Stone, lauds Packer's performance as

director, saying that she "performed
as the kind of full-time director that I
had always thought we needed. . . .
Nobody ever has done as much tor
Freshman English as she has."
During her tenure from '76 to '84
as director of the program. Packer
made several controversial changes
including a reduction in the size of the
composition classes from an unruly
26 to 28 students per section to what
she describes 'as "a more manageable
number" in the mid-teens.
In addition, she instituted, de
signed and taught a required pedag
ogy class for second-year doctoral
students who teach composition.
According to English Department
Chairman George Dekker, ""I here
were some grumbles of protest at the
outset. But within a year. Nancy had
really won people to her way of doing
things . . . partly because her ideas in
practice turned out to be so good,
partly because her dedication to the

job was so obvious and partly because
they found that Nancy was such a
warm and supportive person, and that
far from being a martinet, she was
really a good friend and someone
they could go to when they had prob
lems."
Within the English Department.
Packer's other responsibilities include
sitting on the writing program's ad
missions committee, a job to which
she brings extreme care, according to
L'Heureux.
He describes one of its final
meetings: "Very often we'll have got
ten it down to two people we really
do want and there's some doubt
about the other two or three, and at
that point Nancy will say. 'Well, let's
look at number 17 again. It seems to
me that number 17 has a certain in
dividuality, a certain quirkiness that
might be good for our program."
"And suddenly, we find ourselves
plummetted back into a part of the

discussion we were at 30 minutes ear
lier. Sometimes, of course, that can
be very distressing and I frequently
leap at her throat with bare hands and
try to strangle her." L'Heureux says.
While it is widely acknowledged
that "she is in the thick of everything
that goes on in English Department."
as L'Heureux puts it. she has also
chaired committees as diverse as a
study group on the dean of admis
sions* role at Stanford and CAPER
(Committee on Athletics. Physical
Education and Recreation).
Packer's involvement with CAPER
indicates something about her that
many students may not know. * I'm a
real sports fan. 1 adore watching bas
ketball. 1 love tn watch Stanford bas
ketball. I'm aware of all sports with
the possible exception of boxing and
wrestling," she says."I read 'The
Green.' "
But "The Green" isn't the only
section of the newspaper Packer

pores over. Over the past four \ears.
she has developed an avid interest in
the stock market, but just enough to
keep her out of trouble. She says."I
read the stock market page every day.
I read the Wall Street Journal. ... I
don't ever do anything with the mar
ket. but 1 know what's going on."
Packer's new-found interest in the
country's economy, which she says
she finds "fascinating." and her talk
of a desire to travel to India. China
and back to Africa, lead one to
wonder if she won't end up in politics
yet.
She describes her first trip to Africa
two years ago to visit her son at his
Togo Peace Corps post as "wonderful
and horrible." For Packer, seeing a
part of Africa that "just being a
tourist 1 would not have seen." makes
it "very warming and very chilling to
think about the future. ... II 1 were
younger," she says,"it would change
my life."
