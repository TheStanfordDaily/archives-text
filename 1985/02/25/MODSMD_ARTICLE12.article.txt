## The Stanford Daily Rock 'n' roll revival
### 
Those of us who saw the Grateful Dead per
form in Oakland last week have a piece of advice
for the Stanford Concert Network: Bring back
the Dead.
In years past Grateful Dead concerts at Frost
Amphitheatre have been a recreational highlight
for Stanford students. Two years ago the fes
tivities were brought to an abrupt end as Univer
sity officials felt that the influx of outsiders com
ing onto campus for such events posed serious se
curity problems. We now have a green light to
book popular concerts. After hosting the Super
Bowl, it seems only reasonable that the Univer
sity extend this privilege to the students. It is now
up to the Concert Network to book quality
performers to play here.
Anyone who has ever seen the Dead can testify
that one of its shows will add quite a bit of color
to the environment here at Stanford. Anyone
who has not seen one of these spectacles should
have the opportunity to do so. The Grateful

Dead are an important part of the Bay Area's
cultural history. Those of us who saw them last
week can testify that the Dead are alive and well.
The Concert Network would be hard-pressed to
find an act which would bring Frost Amphit
heatre to life as the Dead would.
Last spring the directors of the Concert Net
work asked students for a on-time fee assessment
to provide the necessary capital to underwrite a
number of shows in the coming year. Students did
their part and approved the request; now we're
all waiting for the Concert Network to hold up its
part of the deal.
The Frost Amphitheatre concert season runs
from April 1 to Oct. 31. Earlier this month the
Concert Network expressed concern over the fin
ancial risks involved with being the exclusive
promoters of concerts in the 9,500-seat theater.
From a financial as well as a public-relations
standpoint, the Grateful Dead seems to be an ex
cellent choice.
