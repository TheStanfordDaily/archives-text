# Dorkapolis helps explain the ubiquitous crush
## 
### 
You probably won't believe me. The other
night 1 was standing outside a beautiful girl's
window and minding my own business when I
heard a voice.
"Hey, Steve, wouldn't you like to get to
know that girl?"
1 thought the voice came from within
myself until I heard it again. "Well?" And I
realized that it was coming from behind me. I
spun around and saw an incredible sight.
There before me stood a man with leaves on
his head, a bedsheet draped over his body and
a rope tied around his waist. I assumed that he
was drunk and had gotten lost on his way
home from a toga party.
"Who are you?" I asked. "And how did
you know my name?"
"My name is Dorkapolis. Perhaps you've
heard of me."
"Well .. . no," I said.
"I was once a famous Greek philosopher. I
was considered to be the best mind in my area
of philosophy."
"What area was that?" 1 asked, playing
along with this guy's game.
"The irrational," he stated proudly.
"Oh. . . . And why are you here?"
"I have been sent here to lead you on a
journey into the mind," he said, "into that
part of the mind that led you here to gape into
that young lady's window."
"I wasn't gaping into that girl's window," I
protested. "I was looking for my contact
lens."
"In the middle of the night?" he asked.
"Accept yourself, Steve. Come with me, and
together we'll discover what causes your inex
plicable behavior."
Well, by that time the girl 1 hadn't been
watching had gone to bed, so I decided to
humor this Dorkapolis fellow. He told me to
close my eyes, and, immediately after I did so.

Dork and I were in a strange place. It was like
the inside of a snail.
"Welcome to the brain," explained Dork.
"Where are we?" 1 asked.
"We are in that part of the brain called the
Bureau of Befuddlement. The Bureau
handles everything from simple sexual arousal
to falling in love, but the main thrust here is
the übiquitous crush."
"Ah, I know these things," 1 said to myself.

"I know you do, Steve, that's why we're
here."
Dork and I trudged through the grey
sponginess until we came to a doorway in
scribed with the words "Realm of Realiza
tion." We knocked on the door and a
plain-looking man dressed in a white smock
opened the door for us. I would soon realize
that all of the workers in the brain looked
alike. Dork explained to this fellow who we
were and why we were here, and the worker's
face lit up.
"I must say," he said, "we don't see too
many visitors down here. Well, let me show
you around.
"We're quite proud of our section," he
boasted. "We are, of course, the key depart
ment in the bureau. We handle one's awaken
ing to the fact that he has developed a

preoccupation with a certain individual — we
break the news to the rest of the brain. And,
as 1 am sure you know, we work very fast."
"Yes, I know," 1 sighed. "But how do you
decide who to target?"
*'Uh, well. ..." He looked down and
squeezed some grey matter between his
shoes. "We, uh . . . well, the truth is that we
haven't perfected that part yet. Right now the
decisions are made rather randomly with a
little help from the boys over at Sight."
I wasn't surprised. Dork thanked the man
and suggested that we move on. The next
door we came to had the words
"Interpretation Institute" engraved on it.
This time we walked in without knocking and
I could only stand and stare.
Dozens of perplexed-looking men rushed
aimlessly about stopping occasionally to con
sult with each other. We accosted one of these
men and he looked exactly like the man we
had talked with at the Realm. Dork explained
our situation and asked the man to give me a
brief summary of the operation of the In
stitute.
"Like our name suggests," he began, "we
are here to interpret. Our job is to scrutinize
the actions of the crush objective to detect the
existence of possible reciprocal feelings. We
analyze everything from inflection in the ob
jective's voice to how long the objective looks
back at us when stretching out a goodbye. We
also monitor the objective's whereabouts 24
hours a day. It's quite a task."
"Sounds like you have your hands full," I
said.
"But that's not all," he added. "We have a
secondary mission that deals with behavior
modification. Not only do we analyze the ob
jective's actions, but we have to modify our
own so that the objective won't detect our

true feelings. We become less friendly for the
most part."
"But isn't that counterproductive?" I
asked.
"Could be. Don't know. That's not our
job," he answered.
I looked at Dork in disbelief. He smiled and
suggested that we continue on our journey.

We walked for several minutes until we came
to another door which read "Hamlet House."
Dork signaled me to be quiet ant* slowly
opened the door.
Three men sat in the room with their heads
buried in their hands. They were groaning
softly.
"This is the room where the big decision is
made," Dork whispered, "the decision
whether or not to tell the objective of one's
true feelings. One man, the one on the right,
groans out of desire to reveal the truth. That

man, on the left, groans out of the possibility
that the objective will reject one's feelings.
The man in the middle acts as the final deci
sion maker and groans because he dreads the
decision he must make."
"I can relate," I said.
"Yes, Steve, 1 know you can," Dork stated.
"We have all experienced the effects that the

Bureau has on our lives, but now you have
seen the mechanism behind the madness of a
crush."
"But 1 still don't understand."
"And so it is," he said, and was gone.
I stood outside staring at a darkened win
dow. I zipped up my jacket and turned to go
home. It was late. And no one would ever
believe me.

whether or not to tell the objective of one's
true feelings. One man, the one on the right,
groans out of desire to reveal the truth. That

man, on the left, groans out of the possibility
that the objective will reject one's feelings.
The man in the middle acts as the final deci
sion maker and groans because he dreads the
decision he must make."
"I can relate," I said.
"Yes, Steve, 1 know you can," Dork stated.
"We have all experienced the effects that the

Bureau has on our lives, but now you have
seen the mechanism behind the madness of a
crush."
"But 1 still don't understand."
"And so it is," he said, and was gone.
I stood outside staring at a darkened win
dow. I zipped up my jacket and turned to go
home. It was late. And no one would ever
believe me.

You probably won't believe me. The other
night 1 was standing outside a beautiful girl's
window and minding my own business when I
heard a voice.
"Hey, Steve, wouldn't you like to get to
know that girl?"
1 thought the voice came from within
myself until I heard it again. "Well?" And I
realized that it was coming from behind me. I
spun around and saw an incredible sight.
There before me stood a man with leaves on
his head, a bedsheet draped over his body and
a rope tied around his waist. I assumed that he
was drunk and had gotten lost on his way
home from a toga party.
"Who are you?" I asked. "And how did
you know my name?"
"My name is Dorkapolis. Perhaps you've
heard of me."
"Well .. . no," I said.
"I was once a famous Greek philosopher. I
was considered to be the best mind in my area
of philosophy."
"What area was that?" 1 asked, playing
along with this guy's game.
"The irrational," he stated proudly.
"Oh. . . . And why are you here?"
"I have been sent here to lead you on a
journey into the mind," he said, "into that
part of the mind that led you here to gape into
that young lady's window."
"I wasn't gaping into that girl's window," I
protested. "I was looking for my contact
lens."
"In the middle of the night?" he asked.
"Accept yourself, Steve. Come with me, and
together we'll discover what causes your inex
plicable behavior."
Well, by that time the girl 1 hadn't been
watching had gone to bed, so I decided to
humor this Dorkapolis fellow. He told me to
close my eyes, and, immediately after I did so.

Dork and I were in a strange place. It was like
the inside of a snail.
"Welcome to the brain," explained Dork.
"Where are we?" 1 asked.
"We are in that part of the brain called the
Bureau of Befuddlement. The Bureau
handles everything from simple sexual arousal
to falling in love, but the main thrust here is
the übiquitous crush."
"Ah, I know these things," 1 said to myself.

"I know you do, Steve, that's why we're
here."
Dork and I trudged through the grey
sponginess until we came to a doorway in
scribed with the words "Realm of Realiza
tion." We knocked on the door and a
plain-looking man dressed in a white smock
opened the door for us. I would soon realize
that all of the workers in the brain looked
alike. Dork explained to this fellow who we
were and why we were here, and the worker's
face lit up.
"I must say," he said, "we don't see too
many visitors down here. Well, let me show
you around.
"We're quite proud of our section," he
boasted. "We are, of course, the key depart
ment in the bureau. We handle one's awaken
ing to the fact that he has developed a

preoccupation with a certain individual — we
break the news to the rest of the brain. And,
as 1 am sure you know, we work very fast."
"Yes, I know," 1 sighed. "But how do you
decide who to target?"
*'Uh, well. ..." He looked down and
squeezed some grey matter between his
shoes. "We, uh . . . well, the truth is that we
haven't perfected that part yet. Right now the
decisions are made rather randomly with a
little help from the boys over at Sight."
I wasn't surprised. Dork thanked the man
and suggested that we move on. The next
door we came to had the words
"Interpretation Institute" engraved on it.
This time we walked in without knocking and
I could only stand and stare.
Dozens of perplexed-looking men rushed
aimlessly about stopping occasionally to con
sult with each other. We accosted one of these
men and he looked exactly like the man we
had talked with at the Realm. Dork explained
our situation and asked the man to give me a
brief summary of the operation of the In
stitute.
"Like our name suggests," he began, "we
are here to interpret. Our job is to scrutinize
the actions of the crush objective to detect the
existence of possible reciprocal feelings. We
analyze everything from inflection in the ob
jective's voice to how long the objective looks
back at us when stretching out a goodbye. We
also monitor the objective's whereabouts 24
hours a day. It's quite a task."
"Sounds like you have your hands full," I
said.
"But that's not all," he added. "We have a
secondary mission that deals with behavior
modification. Not only do we analyze the ob
jective's actions, but we have to modify our
own so that the objective won't detect our

true feelings. We become less friendly for the
most part."
"But isn't that counterproductive?" I
asked.
"Could be. Don't know. That's not our
job," he answered.
I looked at Dork in disbelief. He smiled and
suggested that we continue on our journey.

We walked for several minutes until we came
to another door which read "Hamlet House."
Dork signaled me to be quiet ant* slowly
opened the door.
Three men sat in the room with their heads
buried in their hands. They were groaning
softly.
"This is the room where the big decision is
made," Dork whispered, "the decision
whether or not to tell the objective of one's
true feelings. One man, the one on the right,
groans out of desire to reveal the truth. That

man, on the left, groans out of the possibility
