I think I have come up with a
solution for the intellectual void that
is called the ASSU.
The problem is a group of people
getting together and playing
"Bureaucracy." If one could get
some units for it that might be a
good reason to let the ASSU remain;
we could call it "Applied Pedantics
101" or "Introductory Bullshit."
But the facts remain.
The ASSU is an oversized organi
zation that is basically collecting a lot
of time and energy and giving few
results.
In a motivated, diverse and intel
ligent community, various groups

and committees, such as the Band,
the Black Student Union and The
Daily, can and should have direct
access to the Stanford community
without dealing with people like Eric
Berg.
Anyway, back to my idea.
Instead of a messy reorganization
effort, why don't we resort to basic
psychology.
Phase 1: Switch the title of
Senator to "Beginning Beauracrat."
Personally, I prefer the title
"Shithead" but some people might
misunderstand my intentions. For
example, "Beginning Beauracrat
B.G. Porter, would you please tell us
why the Coffee House cannot bal
ance a checkbook?"

Phase 2: The Council of Presidents
will be changed to the"Council of
Jerk-Offs." This title, I hope, would
prevent their meeting together.
Result: No one would want to
become anything resembling the
above forcmcntioned. Various
groups would have to ask the stu
dents directly for money they want
to spend. Wc could all learn to live
like responsible individuals.
That's what a university is de
signed to do.

USW and divestiture
On Feb. 21. members of United
Stanford Workers voted to support

the Black Student Union call for
immediate divestment of Stanford s
stock in Motorola and other corpora
tions operating in South Africa un
der apartheid.
We supported the BSU position
for several reasons which we would
like to share with you.
Most important, we support the
anti-apartheid movement because it
is a just cause. Apartheid is just
another word for 20th-century labor
slavery. What else can you call a
system which pays black workers a
small fraction of what others get, for
doing the toughest, dirtiest, longest,
most dangerous work, and which
then discards them in arrid

"homelands" to starve when they are
no longer useful?
Second, USW members wanted to
show support for workers and union
leaders in South Africa who have
heen on the cutting edge of the
anti-apartheid movement and who
for this reason are being shot,
beaten, arrested and charged with
treason.
Third, we want to join with the
Longshoremen, the AFL-CIO and
the Service Employees International
Union, which USW is part of, in
their condemnation of apartheid. For
workers here apartheid is a double
edged sword. Because apartheid
keeps labor very cheap, U.S. corpo

rations export jobs to South Africa.
Fourth, we supported the BSU
motion because we thought it was
appropriate to support than organi
zation's position on this issue.
Finally, USW's voice is one among
many. When the voices of all seg
ments of the Stanford community are
raised, in numbers, loudly and
clearly, with words and with actions,
then the Stanford administration is
likely to listen more seriously and
take more serious steps towards
divestment.
