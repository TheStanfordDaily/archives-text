## Divestiture is a means, not a solution 
### 
In response to a column titled "Divestiture won't
help black workers," (The Daily, Feb. 13) I want to
to provide another perspective and explain the na
ture of the divestiture appeal.
In South Africa, the black majority is silenced
through systematic bannings, detentions and
jailings of black leaders. Black Americans and
other concerned citi/ens are speaking out for the
interests of the black majority of South Africa.
Through divestiture appeals, a message is given:

VIEWPOINT

Allow the black South Africans to speak. The
message is one of self-determination. Only in a
framework where black leaders are allowed com
munication and discussion, only in an ongoing
forum where all South Africans are represented
can the details and mechanisms of removing apar
theid and instituting democratic politics be
deliberated.
Divestiture is a tool. It is a means of communi
cating to Pierre Botha and his South African ad
ministration that black Americans and other con
cerned peoples in America will stand for the black
South African.
Apartheid is sustained through the repression of
communication. Opinion leaders are banned:
confined to their houses and allowed to speak to
one person at a time; detained: held in a jail cell
for an indeterminate amount of time while the state
processes charges of treason or disruption; and
jailed: placed in a prison with no outside contact.
With this government interference, opinions,
consensus and objectives cannot form. Without
communication people cannot determine their
common interests or acquire the means for mutual
action to redress grievances. So whenever a leader

with a compelling plan for action is identified, the
government isolates him, and the link of communi
cation is broken.
Strains of thought that lead to cooperation and
self-determination of the black populace are
quickly isolated and contained. Steve Biko, for ex-

Whenever a leader with a
compelling plan for ac
tion is identified, the gov
ernment isolates him, and
the link of communica
tion is broken.

ample, was an organizer of the Black Conscious
ness Movement, a strain of thinking that
threatened to unite the black tribes of South
Africa. While this idea spread across campuses
throughout South Africa, Biko was arrested and
jailed. He mysteriously died in prison shortly there
after.
And black workers are regulated by passbooks,
making it easy for the government to disperse
groups that build camaraderie. The many tribal af
filiations are separated and manipulated to in
crease tribal tensions and keep blacks factionalized.
In the face of mounting pressure against these
policies. Botha has instituted changes in South

Africa. The most consequential change is the
legalization of black trade unions. These organiza
tions have the potential for transforming the politi
cal and economic context of black South Africa.
The black trade unions are independent organiza
tional structures that provide a collective voice: a
means of communication. Collective bargaining
units to rival the white workers' collective bargain
ing units and force employers to deal fairly with
black as well as white workers. Above all, they are
becoming conduits of information.
To Americans, with newspapers, radios, televi
sion news and freedom of speech, information is a
commodity. But to the black South Africans, where
newspapers are governmentally monitored and
governmentally dissoved when desirable, informa
tion is more scarce and precious than the gold
produced by the thousands of black miners.
Botha's reaction to the progress of the black
trade unions is to ban and jail the union leaders. He
cuts the information How at the source. One step
forward, one step back. Therein lies an objective
for African-Americans: Pressure Botha to free the
union leaders. Allow the black leaders of South
Africa the freedom to lead.
Divestment, then, is a tactical issue. Can pressure
be brought to bear on Pierre Botha through the
divestment of U.S. funds from South Africa?
Divestment is not a solution, it is a means to an
end. And it will end when the natural process of
communication is allowed to develop among the
black people of South Africa. It is in a forum where
all of South Africa's people are represented that
the details and mechanism of democratic politics
will be discussed.
