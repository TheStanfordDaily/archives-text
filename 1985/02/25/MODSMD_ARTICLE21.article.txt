## Wassenaar's 1-hitter sparks sweep 
### TOM SENF Staff sportswriter 
Coming into this season, Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess needed only 11 wins to become the winningest
manager in Cardinal history. Now, only 14 games later,
the record is his. »
After Stanford completed its three-game sweep of San
Jose State by winning both ends of Saturday's
double-header. Marquess surpassed Ray Young's mark of
323 wins.
Marquess, in his ninth year at the helm, has never had a
losing season at Stanford. His .648 winning percentage is
second on the all-time Cardinal list behind Young's .664.
Following the game, the Cardinal seniors presented
Marquess with the game ball, signed by each team mem
ber.
The Cardinal skipper was happy about the record, but
downplayed its significance. "1 guess if you stick around
long enough, you're bound to win a few," he said. "It's
nice, but the main thing is to keep winning."
Winning is something Stanford has done quite a bit of
lately. After a 4-0 victory on Friday, the Cardinal ex
tended its winning streak to five games by taking the twin
bill by scores of 7-3 and 12-6.
Next to Marquess' record, the big story of the weekend
was Rob Wassenaar's dazzling performance on Friday.
The sophomore right-hander threw a one-hit shutout at
the over-matched Spartans. Wassenaar allowed only three
base runners and struck out six.
Wassenaar's bid to become only the third Stanford
pitcher since 1970 to throw a no-hitter ended in the bot
tom of the eighth on an infield single by Steve Ochoa.
Shortstop John Verducci was able to field Ochoa's
grounder through the hole, but couldn't get enough on the
ball to throw him out.

Wassenaar, who is now 3-0 with a 1.74 ERA. was
philosophical about losing his no-hitter in such frustrating
fashion. "Those things are just gonna happen.'' he said.
"John made a good play, but he just couldn't get him."
Verducci might have gotten him had he been playing
closer to third. "I was asking myself why I wasn't playing a
step closer to the hole," he said. "But you can go crazy
thinking about those things."
As the hitless innings went on, Wassenaar tried to put
the no-hitter out of his mind. "I tried not to think about
it,"he said. "1 wasn't really nervous."
His teammates tried to help out by following an old
baseball rule: Never talk to a pitcher about his no-hitter.
"Nobody talked about it," Wassenaar said.
Pitching Coach Tom Dunton added, " That's an old su
perstition. I didn't even go near him."
Because he didn't know much about the Spartans, Was
senaar basically went with his best pitch — his curveball.
"They're a completely different team from last year," he
said. "When you don't know anything about them, you
just go with your power."
Although his main strength is his curve, Wassenaar's
success this year has been due to his ability to mix his
pitches. "He's got good command of all his pitches," Dun
ton said. "He can throw his curve regardless of the count,
and his fastball is better this year."
Mark Davis summed things up: "Wassenaar's a stud."
The Cardinal offense wasn't overpowering, but it didn't
have to be. Pete Stanicek led an 11 -hit attack with a
single, a double and a triple. Verducci gave Wassenaar the
only run he would need in the fifth with the second home
run of his Stanford career.
On Friday, Stanford got just enough offense to go with
brilliant pitching. Saturday, it was the hitters' turn to carry

the pitching staff.
Although Terry Conway's homer
gave the Spartans a 2-1 lead after
four innings, the Cardinal exploded
for five runs and five hits in the fifth.
Rick Lundblade's two-run double,
RBI singles by Davis and Verducci,
and Walt Harris's sacrifice fly chased
Spartan starter Steve Olson.
With a 6-2 lead, Stanford starter
Jeff Ballard cruised to a complete
game win. Ballard, now 4-0, pitched a
solid eight-hitter with six strikeouts
and only one walk. The only run

scored off him after Conway's homer
was unearned.
Fortunately for the Spartan pitch
ing staff, the second game of the
double-header was only seven innings
long. Stanford averaged two runs
every inning it batted. Four freshmen
pitched for the Spartans and received
a rude welcome to college baseball.
Lundblade began the barrage in
the second with his sixth homer of the
year — a tremendous drive to left
center that landed beneath the soccer
bleachers outside Sunken Diamond.
Telford didn't make it through the
three-run Cardinal third, which was
highlighted by Ruben Amaro's two
run single through a drawn-in infield.

After a walk to Mike Deßenon,
Coach Gene Menges decided that
Telford had had it.
After seeing the way his relievers
performed, he may have regretted his
decision.
In the fourth, Stanford had its
second biggest inning of the year,
scoring seven runs — five with two
men out. Verducci turned what was
supposed to be a hit-and-run into and
hit-and-trot by slamming a Jim
Bowles fastball over the fence in left.
With two outs, reliever Mike Roza
faced Deßenon with the bases
loaded. Five consecutive curveballs
ran the count to 3-2. By the time the
sixth curve came in, Deßenon was

ready. With the runners going, he
lined a shot to left-center for a three
run double.
The only negative aspect of the in
ning was that it forced Cardinal
starter Jack McDowell to sit and cool
off. When he returned to the mound
for the fifth, it was obvious that he
wasn't the same pitcher who had
thrown the previous four innings.
Conway hit his second homer of
the day — a three-run blast to
right-center that rivaled Lundblade's
for distance. Marquess let McDowell
finish the inning, but Lee Plemel and
Rick Dietz hurled the last two frames.

Rick Dietz hurled the last two frames.
Coming into this season, Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess needed only 11 wins to become the winningest
manager in Cardinal history. Now, only 14 games later,
the record is his. »
After Stanford completed its three-game sweep of San
Jose State by winning both ends of Saturday's
double-header. Marquess surpassed Ray Young's mark of
323 wins.
Marquess, in his ninth year at the helm, has never had a
losing season at Stanford. His .648 winning percentage is
second on the all-time Cardinal list behind Young's .664.
Following the game, the Cardinal seniors presented
Marquess with the game ball, signed by each team mem
ber.
The Cardinal skipper was happy about the record, but
downplayed its significance. "1 guess if you stick around
long enough, you're bound to win a few," he said. "It's
nice, but the main thing is to keep winning."
Winning is something Stanford has done quite a bit of
lately. After a 4-0 victory on Friday, the Cardinal ex
tended its winning streak to five games by taking the twin
bill by scores of 7-3 and 12-6.
Next to Marquess' record, the big story of the weekend
was Rob Wassenaar's dazzling performance on Friday.
The sophomore right-hander threw a one-hit shutout at
the over-matched Spartans. Wassenaar allowed only three
base runners and struck out six.
Wassenaar's bid to become only the third Stanford
pitcher since 1970 to throw a no-hitter ended in the bot
tom of the eighth on an infield single by Steve Ochoa.
Shortstop John Verducci was able to field Ochoa's
grounder through the hole, but couldn't get enough on the
ball to throw him out.

Wassenaar, who is now 3-0 with a 1.74 ERA. was
philosophical about losing his no-hitter in such frustrating
fashion. "Those things are just gonna happen.'' he said.
"John made a good play, but he just couldn't get him."
Verducci might have gotten him had he been playing
closer to third. "I was asking myself why I wasn't playing a
step closer to the hole," he said. "But you can go crazy
thinking about those things."
As the hitless innings went on, Wassenaar tried to put
the no-hitter out of his mind. "I tried not to think about
it,"he said. "1 wasn't really nervous."
His teammates tried to help out by following an old
baseball rule: Never talk to a pitcher about his no-hitter.
"Nobody talked about it," Wassenaar said.
Pitching Coach Tom Dunton added, " That's an old su
perstition. I didn't even go near him."
Because he didn't know much about the Spartans, Was
senaar basically went with his best pitch — his curveball.
"They're a completely different team from last year," he
said. "When you don't know anything about them, you
just go with your power."
Although his main strength is his curve, Wassenaar's
success this year has been due to his ability to mix his
pitches. "He's got good command of all his pitches," Dun
ton said. "He can throw his curve regardless of the count,
and his fastball is better this year."
Mark Davis summed things up: "Wassenaar's a stud."
The Cardinal offense wasn't overpowering, but it didn't
have to be. Pete Stanicek led an 11 -hit attack with a
single, a double and a triple. Verducci gave Wassenaar the
only run he would need in the fifth with the second home
run of his Stanford career.
On Friday, Stanford got just enough offense to go with
brilliant pitching. Saturday, it was the hitters' turn to carry

the pitching staff.
Although Terry Conway's homer
gave the Spartans a 2-1 lead after
four innings, the Cardinal exploded
for five runs and five hits in the fifth.
Rick Lundblade's two-run double,
RBI singles by Davis and Verducci,
and Walt Harris's sacrifice fly chased
Spartan starter Steve Olson.
With a 6-2 lead, Stanford starter
Jeff Ballard cruised to a complete
game win. Ballard, now 4-0, pitched a
solid eight-hitter with six strikeouts
and only one walk. The only run

scored off him after Conway's homer
was unearned.
Fortunately for the Spartan pitch
ing staff, the second game of the
double-header was only seven innings
long. Stanford averaged two runs
every inning it batted. Four freshmen
pitched for the Spartans and received
a rude welcome to college baseball.
Lundblade began the barrage in
the second with his sixth homer of the
year — a tremendous drive to left
center that landed beneath the soccer
bleachers outside Sunken Diamond.
Telford didn't make it through the
three-run Cardinal third, which was
highlighted by Ruben Amaro's two
run single through a drawn-in infield.

After a walk to Mike Deßenon,
Coach Gene Menges decided that
Telford had had it.
After seeing the way his relievers
performed, he may have regretted his
decision.
In the fourth, Stanford had its
second biggest inning of the year,
scoring seven runs — five with two
men out. Verducci turned what was
supposed to be a hit-and-run into and
hit-and-trot by slamming a Jim
Bowles fastball over the fence in left.
With two outs, reliever Mike Roza
faced Deßenon with the bases
loaded. Five consecutive curveballs
ran the count to 3-2. By the time the
sixth curve came in, Deßenon was

ready. With the runners going, he
lined a shot to left-center for a three
run double.
The only negative aspect of the in
ning was that it forced Cardinal
starter Jack McDowell to sit and cool
off. When he returned to the mound
for the fifth, it was obvious that he
wasn't the same pitcher who had
thrown the previous four innings.
Conway hit his second homer of
the day — a three-run blast to
right-center that rivaled Lundblade's
for distance. Marquess let McDowell
finish the inning, but Lee Plemel and
Rick Dietz hurled the last two frames.
