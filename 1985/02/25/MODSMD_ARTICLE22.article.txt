# Netters blank UCSB, streak at 33
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
The first thing you learn about the members of
the Stanford women's tennis team is that they like
to win. The second thing you learn is that they like
to win big.
Cardiac kids they're not. Coming from behind is
what their opponents do, or rather, what their op
ponents try to do.
The top-ranked and undefeated
since-1983 Stanford netters were true to form Sat
urday against UC-Santa Barbara in the seventh of
an eight-match homestand. You guessed it — the
score was 9-0.
Santa Barbara became Stanford's seventh victim
this season and 33rd straight dating back to last
season. The Gauchos were also the fourth straight
team to leave Stanford Tennis Stadium with a
goose egg under "Visitor" on the scoreboard.
The Cardinal can extend that shutout streak to
five today when it hosts Pepperdine at 1:30 p.m.
The Waves are ranked 14th nationally, but if Stan
ford's darkness-shortened 7-0 victory over ninth

ranked California is any indication, they might be
hard-pressed to even win a set.
"We have a lot of depth," said Cardinal Coach
Frank Brennan, who shifted his lineup around from
Wednesday's match with Cal. "We have a better
team than I thought."
In singles, freshmen Anna Ivan and Cari Hagey
played Saturday for the first time since early in the
season, as both were sidelined with the flu. Ivan
played No. 2 and beat June Angus in straight sets,
6-2, 7-5, although she struggled in the second set.
Hagey had no problems at No. 6, blanking Hemel
Meghani, 6-0, 6-0.
"It's great to have Ivan back in the lineup,"
Brennan said. "We're a great team with her in
there. Physically, she's fine, but mentally she's got
to get a little match-tougher. So in a secret way, I
was pleased she had a tough match and gof some
thing out of it."
Ivan is one of three Cardinal netters in the top
five of the Head-Intercollegiate Tennis Coaches
Association's latest rankings. Patty Fendick is

ranked third and Leigh Anne Eldredge is fourth.
Three-time Ail-American Linda Gates is a
surprising 32nd. but the rankings are dated Feb. IS
and do not reflect Gates' recent 6-0, 6-1 victory
over Cal's Jennifer Prah, who is ranked 18th.
In the new team rankings, it came as no surprise
that Stanford was on top. However, the Cardinal
had 215 total points and No. 2 USC had 214. Are
the teams really that even?
Santa Barbara Coach Angie Minnissian seems to
think so. "They're both very deep," said Minnis
sian. whose Gauchos have lost to both Stanford and
USC by identical 9-0 scores. "I think it's a toss-up
on any given day. It'll be a dogfight.
"Both teams are very strong in singles, but I
think Stanford might have the edge in No. 1 and
No. 2 doubles."
The first scheduled Stanford-USC showdown is
March 27 in Los Angeles, while the second is April
20 at Stanford. However, the two teams could meet
a week earlier at the Longhorn Invitation, an eight
team tournament in Austin. Texas, featuring most
of the top-10 teams in the nation.
