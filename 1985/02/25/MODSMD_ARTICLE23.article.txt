### INGRID SEYER Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford men's swimming team ended its
regular season with an unblemished 9-0 record on
Saturday as it defeated California, 68-45, at
Berkeley.
Though the victory was the Cardinal's 34th
straight dual-meet triumph and fourth in a row
over California, the team will not he stopping to
look back at its record. Instead, it must begin
looking toward the Pacific 10 Conference and
NCAA Championships.
"The regular-season meets are certainly very im
portant, and it is great to have a winning season,
but the NCAA Championship is our ultimate team
goal," Kenney said.
Stanford dominated most of the meet, winning
nine of the 13 events and placing second in six of
them.
The Cardinal opened up the meet with a victory
in the 400-yard medley relay. The team of Dave
Bottom, John Moffet, Pablo Morales and Dave
Louden finished almost two seconds ahead of Cal
with the nation's second-fastest time, 3: 1K.43. That
team also holds the nation's fastest time in that
event.
Stanford's Jeff Kostoff easily captured the next
event, the 1,650 freestyle, with a NCAA qualifying
time of 15:17.56. The sophomore went on to win
the 500 freestyle and an exhibition 400 individual
medley.
"I feel I swam very well and the team as a group
did super," Kostoff said. "Now that the regular
season is over it will be a lot easier to start looking
ahead and preparing for the really big meets."
Freshmen Anthony Mosse and Sean Murphy
came in with two of the Cardinal's best times as
they each won an individual event.
Mosse, a member of the 19K4 New Zealand
Olympic Team, won the 200 butterfly in 1:47.13,
the nation's second-fastest time. Stanford's

Morales is the national leader in that event with a
time of 1:47.01.
"I was quite pleased with my swimming and with
the team's victory as a whole," Mosse said.
Murphy, the nation's leader in the 200 hack
stroke, improved his national best time to 1:48.24
as he won the event, followed by teammate Dave
Bottom.
Overall, Stanford went one-two in five events,
outscoring Cal 8-1 each time. Kostoff and Louden

dominated the 500 freestyle, Mosse and Denney
captured the top two spots in the 200 butterfly and
Morales and Matt Nance did the same in the 200
individual medley.
In the diving competition, Thor Johnson and
Tom Rothenbucher went one-two in the 1-meter
event. Johnson also won the 3-meter competition.
The Cardinal's next competition is the Pac-10
Championships March 7-9 at Tualitin Hills, Ore.
