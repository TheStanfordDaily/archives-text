# Hoopsters lose at Fullerton St.
## 
### PABLO MORALES Staff sportswriter 
After its NCAA playoff hopes
were dashed by four straight con
ference losses, the Fullerton State
women's basketball team entered
Saturday night's game against
Stanford on an emotional low.
However, with five seniors playing
in their final home game, the
Titans managed to muster enough
motivation to defeat the Cardinal,
80-66.
All told, it was rebounding and
turnovers — the lack of the former
and the abundance of the latter —
which led to Stanford's demise.
The Titans simply dominated
the rebounding department, pull
ing down 44 boards to Stanford's
20. The Cardinal wasn't lacking in
fundamentals, it's just that when
an opponent's smallest player
stands six feet tall, it tends to put a
team at a physical disadvantage.
"Oh, sure. We were boxing-out
well," said Stanford Coach Dotty
McCrea. "It's just difficult to
rebound when, for example, (5-
foot-2 guard) Virginia (Sourlis)
and (5-6 guard) Charli (Turner)
have to do their boxing-out at
their opponents' knees."
This statistic was especially tel
ling in light of the fact that the
Cardinal shot especially well from

the field — 59 percent compared
to the Titans' 50 percent. The
Fullerton rebounding advantage,
especially on the offensive boards,
allowed them many second oppor
tunities to convert.
And if two chances weren't
enough, the Cardinal turned the
ball over to the grateful Titans 20
times— 14 in the first half— pro
viding still more chances to score.
Despite its lack of rebounding
and abundance of turnovers, the
Cardinal managed to stay close at
the half, 39-35, on the strength of
Kami Anderson's I 1 points and
Mary Bradach's nine.
"In the first half, we were able
to handle their man-to-man really
well, and our outside shots were
falling," McCrea said. "But in the
second half, we experienced the
same old five- or six-minute offen
sive drought."
The Titans forced this offensive
drought with a 1-3-1 half-court
trap to open the second half, and
the Cardinal offense could not
cope with it. Stanford's shooting
dropped from 65 percent in the
first half to 52 percent in the
second.
Sourlis' 12 second-half points
brought her total to 19, enough to
lead all Cardinal scorers. Ander
son finished with 17.
