### JOHN LIS Editorial staff 
The Stanford Softball team
returned home to Roble Field Friday
for a double-header with San Jose City
College and dropped a pair of games.
San Jose won a tight pitchers' duel in
the first game, 2-1, and took the
nightcap 9-5.
Sophomore Lisa Buchanan was the
hard-luck loser in the opener. Buc
hanan surrendered only three hits,
but the Stanford bats were more
anemic, as the Cardinal managed only
a pair of hits.

Sophomore Betsy Watson lost the
second game. Watson pitched four in
nings before being relieved by Buc
hanan in the fifth.
San Jose banged out 1 1 hits in the
victory and also benefited from six
Stanford errors.
Senior outfielder Cathy Taft forged
a 5-5 tie in the fourth inning of the
nightcap with a two-RBI single.
San Jose, though, came back with
three runs in the fifth to chase Wat
son and provide the winning margin.
Stanford fell to 5-9 on the season,
while San Jose improved to 4-0.
