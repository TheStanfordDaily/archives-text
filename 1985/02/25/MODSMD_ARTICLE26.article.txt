# Card spikers down Hawaii in 4 — again
## 
### ROB GRAHAM Staff sportswriter 
I he Stanford men's volleyball team, ranked
sixth nationally, outclassed Hawaii Friday
evening in four sets. 15-5, 15-9, 10-15, 15-
10, to complete a sweep of a two-match series
with the visiting Rainbows. The Cardinal had
taken Hawaii in four sets the previous after
noon.
Though both went four sets, Friday's con
test bore little resemblance to the tough, well
played game on Thursday. Whereas Stanford
and Hawaii appeared well-matched on
Thursday, the Cardinal was able to regroup on
Friday after the one-day lay over. Meanwhile,
the Rainbows seemed sluggish, especially in
the first two sets.
Stanford made the best of the interim be
tween matches. During that time, the Card
inal coaching staff was able to solve the
Hawaii attack. "After playing them last night.

we had a real good idea of what to expect."
said Co-coach Don Shaw.
With that knowledge, Cardinal blockers
were able to anticipate the movement ot the
Rainbow's hitters, Shaw said, and position
themselves to interfere with Hawaii's kills.
Hawaii, on the other hand, didn't learn
much from Thursday's meeting. "'We were
pathetic in those first two games," Rainbow
Co-coach Jim Smoot said.
Smoot, who is in his first year in charge ol
the Hawaii volleyball program after taking
over in January, also suggested that his lack of
familiarity with his players and with the type
of game played in the California Intercol
legiate Volleyball Association has had an im
pact.
"It (unfamiliarity) is definitely a factor
right now," he said, "it's hard for me to take
people out and to know how they'll react un
der pressure."

Despite Hawaii's triumph in the third set.
Stanford was in control throughout.
in that third game we had a lapse," Shaw
explained. "It's a kind of natural in volleyball
that the team that eventually wins loses the
third set. We were thinking about winning
and not concentrating on the job at hand,
which is to win the set."
Hawaii's Smoot saw it differently. "We
were playing so poorly in those first two
games that we might have put Stanford to
sleep in the third set."
Somnolent Stanford was able to awake in
time for the final set. The Cardinal's five
point run turned an 8-7 Hawaii lead into a 12-
8 Stanford advantage, and when junior Chris
Braun delivered a kill at 14-10, the men had
completed the sweep.
With the two victories. Stanford — now 5-3
in CIVA and 16-4 overall — avenged last
year's pair of four-set losses to the Rainbows

in Honolulu. More important, the Cardinal
remained tied with UC-Santa Barbara, a
sqaud which pounded Stanford here a week
ago, for fourth place in the CIVA.
Ihe playoff picture for the fourth-place
Cardinal is looking up — the top five teams in
the league are traditionally awarded post
season playoff invitations. Stanford, once just
another member of the CIVA chorus, is
poised for its first invitation to the NCAA
e nd - of-1 hey -y ear p a r ty.
In contrast. Hawaii, at 0-4 in the CIVA and
5-6 overall, faces an uphill struggle.
Stanford was paced by Braun, with 17 kills
and a .375 hitting percentage, and junior All-
American Jon Root, 17 and .256. Freshman
Scott Fortune added 13 kills (.379). For the
night, the Cardinal mustered a collective hit
ting percentage of .267. The Rainbows
managed only .177.
Stanford, with a measurable heieht advan

tage, <vas able to dominate the game with its
blocking. "Stanford is very tall," Smoot la
mented.
Stanford continued Friday where it left off
Thursday afternoon, notching 11 unassisted
blocks compared to Hawaii's four. Root again
led the way. as he did Thursday, recording a
team high four blocks.
The serving of senior team captain Craig
Lauchner was again effective. His run of four
points to start the first game fired up the team
and set the tempo for the entire evening. All
told, his jump serve was good enough to score
five service aces. No other player on either
squad was able to record an ace.
And it should frighten opponents that
Lauchner's serve is as yet unperfected. "He
developed it (the jump serve) the last two
weeks. Now it's really starting to come
around," Shaw said.

I he Stanford men's volleyball team, ranked
sixth nationally, outclassed Hawaii Friday
evening in four sets. 15-5, 15-9, 10-15, 15-
10, to complete a sweep of a two-match series
with the visiting Rainbows. The Cardinal had
taken Hawaii in four sets the previous after
noon.
Though both went four sets, Friday's con
test bore little resemblance to the tough, well
played game on Thursday. Whereas Stanford
and Hawaii appeared well-matched on
Thursday, the Cardinal was able to regroup on
Friday after the one-day lay over. Meanwhile,
the Rainbows seemed sluggish, especially in
the first two sets.
Stanford made the best of the interim be
tween matches. During that time, the Card
inal coaching staff was able to solve the
Hawaii attack. "After playing them last night.

we had a real good idea of what to expect."
said Co-coach Don Shaw.
With that knowledge, Cardinal blockers
were able to anticipate the movement ot the
Rainbow's hitters, Shaw said, and position
themselves to interfere with Hawaii's kills.
Hawaii, on the other hand, didn't learn
much from Thursday's meeting. "'We were
pathetic in those first two games," Rainbow
Co-coach Jim Smoot said.
Smoot, who is in his first year in charge ol
the Hawaii volleyball program after taking
over in January, also suggested that his lack of
familiarity with his players and with the type
of game played in the California Intercol
legiate Volleyball Association has had an im
pact.
"It (unfamiliarity) is definitely a factor
right now," he said, "it's hard for me to take
people out and to know how they'll react un
der pressure."

Despite Hawaii's triumph in the third set.
Stanford was in control throughout.
in that third game we had a lapse," Shaw
explained. "It's a kind of natural in volleyball
that the team that eventually wins loses the
third set. We were thinking about winning
and not concentrating on the job at hand,
which is to win the set."
Hawaii's Smoot saw it differently. "We
were playing so poorly in those first two
games that we might have put Stanford to
sleep in the third set."
Somnolent Stanford was able to awake in
time for the final set. The Cardinal's five
point run turned an 8-7 Hawaii lead into a 12-
8 Stanford advantage, and when junior Chris
Braun delivered a kill at 14-10, the men had
completed the sweep.
With the two victories. Stanford — now 5-3
in CIVA and 16-4 overall — avenged last
year's pair of four-set losses to the Rainbows

in Honolulu. More important, the Cardinal
remained tied with UC-Santa Barbara, a
sqaud which pounded Stanford here a week
ago, for fourth place in the CIVA.
Ihe playoff picture for the fourth-place
Cardinal is looking up — the top five teams in
the league are traditionally awarded post
season playoff invitations. Stanford, once just
another member of the CIVA chorus, is
poised for its first invitation to the NCAA
e nd - of-1 hey -y ear p a r ty.
In contrast. Hawaii, at 0-4 in the CIVA and
5-6 overall, faces an uphill struggle.
Stanford was paced by Braun, with 17 kills
and a .375 hitting percentage, and junior All-
American Jon Root, 17 and .256. Freshman
Scott Fortune added 13 kills (.379). For the
night, the Cardinal mustered a collective hit
ting percentage of .267. The Rainbows
managed only .177.
Stanford, with a measurable heieht advan

tage, <vas able to dominate the game with its
blocking. "Stanford is very tall," Smoot la
mented.
Stanford continued Friday where it left off
Thursday afternoon, notching 11 unassisted
blocks compared to Hawaii's four. Root again
led the way. as he did Thursday, recording a
team high four blocks.
The serving of senior team captain Craig
Lauchner was again effective. His run of four
points to start the first game fired up the team
and set the tempo for the entire evening. All
told, his jump serve was good enough to score
five service aces. No other player on either
squad was able to record an ace.
And it should frighten opponents that
Lauchner's serve is as yet unperfected. "He
developed it (the jump serve) the last two
weeks. Now it's really starting to come
around," Shaw said.
