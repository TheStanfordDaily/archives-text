### CAROLYN TARKINGTON Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford women's gymnastics team put in a strong
team effort Friday night for a third-place finish at the six
team Oregon State Invitational.
I he host Beavers took first place, setting a new team
record with 185.85 points, the fourth highest total in the
nation this season.
"As a team Oregon looked really strong and they
deserved to win." Head Coach Homer Sardina said, "but
all ot the coaches there agreed that Oregon was
hometowned quite a hit. They were probably overscored
by about two points."
In second place was Washington with 181.40 points.
Stanford totaled 179.00 for third place. New Mexico
totaled 178.25, and in a tie for fifth were Utah State and
San Diego State with 174.00 points each.
"We all telt really good about how we performed as a
team. Cardinal senior Angie Barnes said, "but I think we
all felt the scoring was inconsistent."
I he Cardinal women are currently ranked fourth in the
Western Region, behind OSU, Fullerton State and Wash
ington. I he top team in each region qualifies for the

NCAAs, along with the next five teams.
"It's going to be a dog fight between Washington and
Stanford for the third-place regional ranking," Sardina
said. "Going in at third would obviously be an advantage
toward NCAA qualification."
In Saturday night's individual event finals, Stanford's
Nanci Goldsmith put in an excellent performance for a
second-place finish on beam with a 9.55. Other Stanford
finals qualifiers were Angie Barnes, Merilyn Chapman,
Alison McGann and Robin Close.
OSU dominated the event finals taking a first place on
every event and in the all-around.
Sardina said all the visiting teams were under
scored. "We were underscored at least one or two tenths
per gymnast on all of the events except for balance beam,
and floor exercise was scored especially low.
"It is really unfortunate because OSU didn't really have
anything to do with it. It was an officiating problem that
OSU can't be blamed for. Our sport has always had this
problem and it's often prevelant in competitions at the in
ternational level. We're just glad that there will only be
two Oregon judges at the regionals."
