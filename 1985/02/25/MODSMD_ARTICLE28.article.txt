### ERIK ESELIUS Staff sportswriter 
In their final dual meets of the
season, the Stanford men's and
women's fencing teams finished on
different notes. The Cardinal
women defeated San Jose State 1 1-
5 to raise their record to 14-2,
while the Stanford men dropped to
15-2 with their 14-13 loss to the
Spartans.
Led by the 4-0 records of Holly
Tailor and Jennifer Yu, the Card
inal women put together what Stan
ford Head Coach Buzz Hurst called
"the most decisive victory of the
season."
"For the first time, I felt that I
got a top performance from the
whole team instead of just individ
uals," Hurst said. "I was pleased

with the way the team jelled to
gether."
The Spartan's top fencer, Katie
Koombs, whose only previous loss
was a 5-4 decision to the Cardinal's
Yu, was shut down 5-3 by Tailor
and 5-0 by Yu.
Yu, who finished the season with
a 58-2 record, said she had "no
problems" with the Spartans.
The same cannot be said for the
Cardinal men, who for the second
this season lost on the last touch of
the final bout. The foil team came
away with a 5-4 victory, while the
epee team won 6-3. The saber
team, though, finished uncharac
teristically on the bottom end of a
7-2 score.
"Essentially, the saber team col

lapsed," said Hurst candidly. "The
foil and epee teams both fenced
very well. Both teams lost 5-4
before."
Saber team captain Andy
Goorno agreed with Hurst's senti
ment. "The saber team was really
the team to blame. Their saber
team was really psyched. They got
the momentum and kept it rolling
their way. The epee and foil fenced
fabulously."
Though Hurst was disappointed
with the loss, he kept things in posi
tive perspective, "I think this may
in the long term be good for us.
Sometimes it helps to have a cold
shower.
"It would be difficult to go into
regionals without feeling cocky
after beating everyone."
