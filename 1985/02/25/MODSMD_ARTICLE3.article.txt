# Coffee House petition calls for student support
## Accompanying flyer defends financial status 
### BRYAN WALSER Staff writer 
The management of the Coffee House has initiated a
petition drive to try to demonstrate student support for
the restaurant, aecording to Mark Thornburgh, president
of the Coffee House. The petition drive began Wednesday
evening and will continue through the end of this week in
White Plaza and in the Coffee House itself.
So far, Thornburgh estimates that the petition has 500
signatures encouraging "Tresidder Union to continue
contracting the right of operating of the Coffee House,
Inc., to the Associated Students of Stanford University
(ASSU)." The petition will be presented to the University
representative for Tresidder Union along with the
ASSU's bid for continued control of the Coffee House.
"We hope our bid is accepted on its merit alone," says
Thornburgh. "We are not using this petition to push a bad
bid, but simply out of some concern that Tresidder is tired
of the inconsistency of dealing with students and is not
sure that it is worth the trouble. We want to show that stu
dents care enough to justify the extra effort, not to ramrod
a contract through."
Thornburgh says that student reaction to the petition
drive has been extremely positive. According to
Thornburgh, Coffee House workers reported only one
person who refused to sign the petition Thursday.
Thornburgh emphasized the student-owned nature of
the restaurant as a reason for the petition. "It is unique
because it is entirely student-run, except for a full

time manager, unlike the Corner Pocket or Baker Street.
They have student employees there, but they have to an
swer to some higher authority. With the Coffee House,
the students are that higher authority."
In addition to the petition, the Coffee House manage
ment is circulating a flyer explaining its position on the
controversy surrounding the restaurant's finances. The
flyer states that the Coffee House is running in the black,
and that the amount of the debt is closer to $50,000, not
$80,000, the figure given to ASSU senators in a confiden
tial report on the Coffee House.
The management also states in light of allegations to
the contrary, that the Coffee House's finances have al
ways been a matter of public record.
The flyer cites a June 28, 1983, story in The
Daily as an example of previous public disclosure of Cof
fee House finances. The article in question acknowledges
that a debt exists, but makes no mention of its size, and
gives no details about the restaurant's operating budget.
ASSU Graduate Senator Jim McGrath refused to
respond to the flyer's allegation that the $80,000 figure is
a "creation" of McGrath and The Daily on the grounds
that the documents involved "remain confidential." The
Daily obtained the figure from the confidential report
McGrath prepared for the senate.
The flyer ends with a plea to "help keep the Coffee
House in student hands, away from the tacky grip of Ser
vomation," the other likely bidder for the Coffee House.
