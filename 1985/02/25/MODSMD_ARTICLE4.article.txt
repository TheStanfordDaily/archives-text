# Reception honors heart team, patient
## 
### MARK LAWRENCE Staff writer 
Piotr Sternik, the 6-year-old boy from Gdansk,
Poland, who recently underwent open-heart surgery
here, returned to Stanford yesterday to thank those
who made his $25,000 operation possible
Surgeons waived their fees but hospital officials
demanded payment before the surgery could take
place. This sum, needed to cover hospital expenses,
was raised by the Polish Assistance League and
private donations.
Before the operations on Jan. 25 and 27, Piotr
suffered from a congenital heart defect that
prevented much of his blood from reaching his
lungs. The surgery neccessary to save his life is un
available in Poland, so Piotr was brought to Stan
ford in December.
The reception, according to Zyg /ins, chairman
of the league, was to "express gratitude to the
physicians who performed the surgery and to the
donors who made it possible." About 70 donors
and members of the medical staff attended.
When Piotr arrived with his mother, Helina, the

gathering broke out in applause and the chorus of a
Polish celebration song.
In an impromptu news conference, Piotr, who
does not speak English, said through an inter
preter. "I'm feeling much better but I'm still a little
hoarse."
Piotr said he hopes most of all to "play ball"
when he returns to Poland next month and said he
feels as though he could "outrun everybody right
now."
Helina Sternik said, also through an interpreter,
that she has found "wonderful people and a won
derful hospital at Stanford." She added, "1 will
worship the (doctors') hands for the rest of my
life."
Dr. John Macoviak, a member of the surgery
team under the direction of Dr. Norman Shumway,
chairman of cardiovascular surgery at Stanford
Hospital, said Piotr "is a great guy and we all feel
glad he's very well." He added, "You didn't have
to go to medical school to figure that out." Piotr
greeted Macoviak with a hug and presented him
with a wrapped gift.

Macoviak said, "We hope to keep in touch"
when Piotr returns to Poland. He said Piotr will
need a "routine following-up there but we don't
anticipate he will need any special care."
Piotr spent his first week of recovery in Carmel
and has since been "enjoying his new energy" at
the San Carlos home of Peter Wasowski, a friend of
the Sterniks who originally brought Piotr to the
United States.
Piotr will continue his recuperation there until
March 1 1 when he and his mother will leave for a
brief visit to Disneyland. They will then return to
Gdansk.
Macoviak said, "It's nice to have a success. This
particular procedure could be done elsewhere but it
couldn't be done better. Dr. Shumway happens to
be an incredible surgeon."
Czeslaw Lawilski, a member of the Polish Assis
tance League of California, said, "Stanford is the
most wonderful place. It's the only place where
they can cure all these things. They have all the
facilities."
