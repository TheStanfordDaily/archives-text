Pop a video of Stanford quarters into
your VCR. Start the tape at fall quarter.
Fast forward past the rain and chilly gray
days of winter quarter until you get to
spring. Stop. Hold.
You see scenes of people lying out in the
sun "bagging rays." People clad in shorts,
swimsuits and sunglasses. And. on their
faces, you see the cheerful attitude of
spring. You arc viewing a tilm of this
weekend.
But wait. This is winter quarter. The
calendar says February, but this weekend s

75- to 80-degree weather could have
fooled anyone.
The Store sold "a lot more sodas," and at
the Corner Pocket people waited for re
freshing fro-yos.
In all. students took full advantage of the
fair-weathered weekend. "I blew off ev
erything." said sophomore Catherine
Carlson. "The sun took precedence over
anything else."
Students flocked to their favorite sunning
spots. The Oval, Mem Hoop in front of
Green Library. Meyer Library's sundeck
and DcGuerre Pool were crowded with sun
worshippers. "The lawn around the pool

was completely jammed." said Carlson, a
regular at DeGuerre. "The pool was
crowded with people who never, ever swim
in winter — the regulars got pushed out."
Many brought books out with good in
tentions. "I attempted to read out in the
sun and fell asleep." said junior Diane
Morris. "It felt like spring, and it was really
hard to get motivated."
Others played their favorite sports com
fortably. "I headed over to the golf course
— it was fantastic," said junior Pete Peter
son.


Who would believe that spring quarter is still five weeks
off? From the looks of these men at Saturday's baseball

Rod Searcey/Daily
game, winter quarter has been all but forgotten in the en
joyment of unseasonably warm weather.
