# Released Time Program promotes public service
## Stanford employees get time off to volunteer 
### MITCH JUDD Editorial staff 
Certain Stanford employees can now receive
up to three hours a week off their jobs to
volunteer in local schools through a program
recently instituted by the Stanford Volunteer
Network and Palo Alto Unified School Dis
trict.
The Release Time Program "shows that the
University is not just paying lip service to the
idea of community service," according to Peter
Spivack, the network's director.
With approval from their supervisors. Uni
versity staff members receive regular pay while
volunteering to do everything from advising
high school newspapers to assisting teachers at
all grade levels.
Catherine Milton, special assistant to the
president, said she feels the program "relieves
the frustrations of the Stanford staff that aren't
able to teach."
Laura Selznick, a participant in the Release
Time Program, said she feels that tht program
helps her take a break from her usual duties as
director of Undergraduate Research Opportu
nities (URO). Selznick said that "the Univer
sity is very understanding" but that it is also
understood that "you'll get your (University)
job done."
Last summer, the school district's External
Resources Center suggested the program to
Milton. Milton approached University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy and Director ot Person
nel Robert Parker, received their approval and
created the framework for the program.
According to Milton, the school district

has a similar program using the per
sonnel resources of large companies in the
area. When district administrators realized
Stanford was the largest employer in Palo
Alto, it became the next obvious target.
Although this type of program is not new to
larger companies, Spivack said he believes that
"it may be the only one of its kind for a uni
versity. ... It's totally new and pretty unusual."
He said he feels the program is a "pretty sig
nificant commitment to the community by
Stanford. ... I think it's great; they're letting a
lot of man-hours go to this."
With the large class sizes and cutbacks in
programming funds for the schools, these
man-hours are much needed. Milton said.
The program provides the 1 1 schools in the
district with extra help while allowing Stanford
staff members to contribute to the community
as parents, like Selznick, and as advisers in
their fields of knowledge, ranging from
Japanese to journalism.
September marked the beginning of the pro
gram's experimental first year. According to
Spivack, the program started with only 12 par
ticipants to make sure there would be no prob
lems. In January the program was opened up
to the faculty, secretaries, laborers and tech
nicians of the University.
So far the program has proceeded with only
a few snags. Some of the volunteers have had
to stop participating because of increases in
their University workloads as a result of pro
motions or unforeseen time-commitment prob
lems. But, Milton said. "In terms ot trying to
be a good neighbor, it's a good thing for Stan
ford to be doing."
