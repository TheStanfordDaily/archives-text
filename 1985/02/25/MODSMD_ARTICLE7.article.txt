Saudis approve Jordan-PLO accord
MANAMA, Bahrain — Saudi Arabia appeared to give its tacit ap
proval to the Jordanian-Palestinian accord 011 Mideast peace when it
transferred $28.5 million to the Palestine Liberatioh Organization yes
terday.
But Syria and Libya both accused the PLO and Jordan of forming an
axis and plotting terror attacks against Syrian and Libyan interests in
Lebanon and Europe.
Newspapers in the moderate Arab countries of the Gulf generally
avoided taking a di-rect stand on the five-point accord, unveiled in Am
man on Saturday and hailed in Egypt, the only Arab country not offi
cially at war with Israel.
State-run radio stations throughout the region, however, gave
prominence to a call by Jordanian King Hussein for prompt action by the
United States to launch meaningful Arab-Israeli peace talks before an
other "explosion" occurs in the Middle East.
Kuwait radio said Israeli Foreign Minister Itzhak Shamir would try to
thwart any European backing for the accord during his current trip to
Europe.
"Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesmen have said they rejected the ac
cord's call for an international Mideast peace conference and for
negotiations with a joint Jordanian-Palestinian team," the radio noted.
It said Israel's insistence on direct negotiations with individual Arab
parties, notably Jordan, combined with ongoing Arab differences to
make it appear that "no formula for peace can be implemented for years
to come."
The Saudi transfer to the PLO was announced by Rafik Natcheh, the
PLO representative in Riyadh, who said it was made in accordance with
previous Arab summit resolutions on financial backing for the Pales
tinians.
The Syrian-Libyan attitude was spelled out by the Libyan news agency
Jana and by Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq A 1 Sharaa and House
Speaker Mahmoud Zoubi, with the latter vowing that the accord would
"meet the same fate" as last May's Lebanon-Israeli agreement.
That accord, which was intended to govern security in Southern
Lebanon after an Israeli withdrawal, fell through because of Syrian op
position.
Saudi Arabia, which is trying to arrange an Arab summit in Riyadh,
meanwhile issued a statement in which it categorically denied
"unbelievable allegations" by a reputedly Libyan-funded magazine in
Beirut about shifts in the Saudi Mideast position.
U.N. peacekeepers face problems
NAQURA, Lebanon — United Nations peace-keepers, long ac
customed to playing th 2 thankless man in the middle in the tangled
politics of southern Lebanon, are finding themselves hard-pressed as Is
rael's withdrawal from the area turns into a bloody confrontation with
Shiite Moslems.
Symptomatic of the new tensions were two recent incidents.
In the first, French troops of the 10-nation, 5,900-man force were
manhandled as they sought to stop Israeli soldiers, responding to an at
tack on one of their patrols, from destroying houses in a Shiite village
last week.
The other incident involved a near shoot-out at the Qasmiyeh bridge
over the Litani River on the coastal highway when an Israeli in
fantryman fired at French guards protecting a routine U.N. convoy to
prevent its moving north to Beirut.
The incidents were not judged serious in themselves, although in the
first case a formal protest was lodged with Israeli authorities.
But they recalled the almost constant bad relations between Israel and
the lightly armed U.N/Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) from its in
ception during the Israeli invasion of the south in 1978 until last sum

Five U.S. bishops visit Nicaragua
MANAGUA, Nicaragua — Five American Roman Catholic leaders
arrived in Nicaragua yesterday for what one of them, Archbishop John
O'Connor of New York, called a visit "to listen and learn" about Central
American conflicts involving the church.
Others in the delegation, which also will visit El Salvador during a
one-week trip, are Cardinal Joseph Bernardin of Chicago, Archbishop
James Hickey of Washington. D.C., Bishop Rene Garcida of Corpus
Christi, Texas, and Bishop Sean O'Malley of the U.S. Virgin Islands.
The governments of Nicaragua and El Salvador have been criticized
by local church leaders, but the church-government conflict is stronger
in Nicaragua than in El Salvador. The leftist government of the Sandi
nista National Liberation Front and the church have clashed openly, and
the government accuses the church hierarchy of trying to sabotage its
revolutionary goals.
Speaking at Managua's airport, O'Connor said the Roman Catholic
Church in the United States "has always urged political rather than mili
tary solutions" to any conflict.
The church in Nicaragua says the Sandinistas have deviated from the
original purposes of the revolution which overthrew the late rightist
strongman Anastasio Somoza and are trying to impose a Marxist regime.
Iraqi planes hit Iranian positions
BAGHDAD. Iraq — Iraqi jet fighter pilots, in one of their most ac
tive days in the four-and-one-half-year-old war, made 141 strikes
against Iranian positions yesterday, an Iraqi military communique reported.
It said "all Iraqi jet fighters returned safely after scoring direct and ef
fective hits on the enemy targets in the central and southern sectors" of
the 730-mile battle line.
The communique also said an Iraqi army unit "ambushed" five enemy
boats on a river in the central sector and destroyed four.
It gave no casualty figures for that action, but said two Iranian soldiers
were killed and an ammunition dump and mortar position were
destroyed by Iraqi artillerymen.
In the northern battle zone, "civilian Iranian citizens fleeing the
oppression of the Iranian regime sought refuge with our forward posi
tions and were safely evacuated to rear lines," the communique said. It
did not give any figure on the number of civilians.
A dispatch from Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency,
received in Nicosia, Cyprus, said Iranian forces repulsed an Iraqi attack
in the southern sector.
It said the assault was launched late Saturday on the town of Fakkeh,
75 miles northwest of Ahwaz, the capital of the southern Iranian prov
ince of Khuzistan. and the Iraqis suffered "a large number of casualties."
Foreign reporters are barred from the battle zones by both Iran and
Iraq and there was no independent confirmation of the reports.
Violence increases in Ireland
LONDONDERRY, Northern Ireland — A former auxiliary
policeman was shot to death last night as he sat in a parked car in Lon
donderry. and officials said they believed the gunmen were Irish Repub
lican Army guerrillas.
He was the eighth person to be slain in sectarian violence in this
British province in eight days.
A police spokesman identified the victim as Douglas James McElhin
nev. a Protestant in his earl\ 40s. He said McElhinncy, who left the
Ulster Defense Regiment in 1979, had been visiting friends in
Rosemont, a Roman Catholic district of west Londonerry, before he was
slain. The Ulster Defense Regiment is Northern Ireland's predominantly
Protestant auxiliary police force.
No group asserted responsibility for the killing.
The spokesman said the shooting occurred near the site where mem
bers of the outlawed IRA killed an unemployed laborer, 24-vear-old
Kevin Coyle, on Saturday, claiming he was a police informer.
Police denied that allegation.
The IRA. which is waging a guerrilla war to end British rule in
Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland, sent a statement to news or
ganization saying Coyle was killed for passing information to the police
that led to the arrests of a number of IRA suspects.
