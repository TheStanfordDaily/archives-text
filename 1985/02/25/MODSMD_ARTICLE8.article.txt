# Chernenko appears on Soviet TV

MOSCOW — President Konstan
tin Chernenko appeared on Soviet
television yesterday for the first time
in almost two months to cast his vote
in local elections.
The film on an evening news pro
gram showed a visibly weak Cher
nenko seated near a ballot box in a
small room. Chernenko was shown
later standing, receiving flowers and
giving a message to election day
workers, surrounded by officials in
cluding Politburo member and Mos
cow party chief Viktor Grishin.
A commentator said Chernenko
was voting in the Krasnopresinski dis
trict in Moscow where he lives, al
though the room on television did not
resemble the polling station where he
normally votes.
Chernenko, dressed in a blue suit,
spoke only a few words and appeared
to have trouble walking. His gaze
looked tired and unfocused.
The scene on television was remi
niscent of the late Soviet leader
Leonid Brezhnev's last years, when
he would make brief public appear
ances designed to dampen specula
tion that he was gravely ill.
Chernenko's reappearance yester

day came as something of a surprise;
on Friday his constituents in another
Moscow district were told that he
could not deliver a traditional elec
tion campaign speech "on doctor's
recommendation."
Friday's announcement had been
the first official confirmation to the
Soviet public that the leader was ill.
By appearing on television today,
even briefly, Chernenko was able to
quash some rumors, circulating in the
diplomatic community here, that he
was permanently incapacitated.
Chernenko, 73, who suffers from
some form of lung ailment, possibly
emphysema, was last seen publicly on
Dec. 27, although he was reported to
have attended a meeting of the Polit
buro on Feb. 7.
His attendance at that meeting and
his appearance today suggested to
some diplomats that his health is
variable, that he has good days and
bad days.
On Christmas Eve, Chernenko was
missing from the lineup on top of the
Lenin mausoleum during the funeral
of the late defense minister Dmitri
Ustinov. The day was bitterly cold
and it was widely assumed that Cher
nenko had been advised to stay in

doors.
He reappeared on television three
days later to give awards to Soviet
writers and then disappeared from
view for 59 days.
Until Friday's announcement,
there had been conflicting reports
from Soviet officials about the state
of his health. One had him on winter
vacation near Moscow; another said
he had been ill.
When he did not meet with visiting
Greek Prime Minister Andreas
Papandreou, Greek officials said they
were told the meeting did not take
place because of Chernenko's poor
health, but Soviet officials withheld
direct comment.
An election day appearance is a
traditional one for Soviet leaders, and
earlier yesterday, as western cor
respondents gathered at Chernenko's
local polling station on a side street in
central Moscow, it became apparent
that the president would not appear
before the foreign press.
Instead, attention was focused on
Mikhail Gorbachev, second in rank
behind Chernenko in the Communist
Party hierarchy and possible succes
sor to Chernenko.

Gorbachev, who lives in the same
district as Chernenko and other
members of the leadership, cast his
ballot under the cameras of both
foreign and Soviet television.
Gorbachev, at 53 the Politburo's
youngest member, performed his role
with ease, even informality. When a
photographer asked him for another
picture at the ballot box. he quipped,
"More than one vote is not allowed."
He was accompanied by his wife,
Raisa. daughter lrina and
granddaughter Oksana — or
Sanochka, as her grandmother called
her, answering a question put to her
in English.
Yesterday's elections, held across
the Soviet Union, were for delegates
to republics' parliaments and city and
district councils. As in all Soviet elec
tions, turnout today was expected to
be close to 99 percent, with only one
candidate for each post.
Chernenko and other members of
the leadership were elected delegates
to various republics' Supreme
Soviets, or parliaments. Chernenko
was elected to the Supreme Soviet of
the Russian Federation, the largest of
the country's 15 republics.
