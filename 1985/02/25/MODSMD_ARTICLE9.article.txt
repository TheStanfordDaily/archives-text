Dole promises farm help
WASHINGTON — Senate majority leader
Robert Dole (R-Kan.) yesterday advised a con
ference on the nation's farm crisis that the ad
ministration is prepared to spend whatever is re
quired to carry out its emergency farm credit pro
gram, but warned that it will not "help every
farmer in every state."
"We're serious about it, we're concerned
about farmers," Dole said. "But I also believe we
have to be very candid: We're not going to be
able to help every farmer in every state."
Dole addressed the meeting, made up
primarily of legislators and officials from mid
western grain-growing states, after Secretary of
Agriculture John Block promised during a televi
sion interview to that "there will be adequate
funding" to ensure that loans called for in the
emergency program which the administration put
into action Friday will be available to help farm
ers with spring planting.
"We will implement these programs ag
gressively, immediately," Block said during an
interview on NBC News' televised "Meet the
Press."
The secretary and the senator were reinforcing
administration positions that will be challenged
next week when the Republican-run Senate fol
lows through on a compromise agreement to con
sider four amendments offered by each party for
additional emergency farm relief. The agree
ment, which ended a filibuster by farm-belt
senators that held up confirmation of Edwin
Meese 111 as attorney general for four days, will
offer Democrats a new opportunity to score poli
tical points against the Republican administra
tion in the once solidly Republican farm belt.
Although the amount currently earmarked for
short-term credit programs is $625 million,
Block said in announcing the decision to press
the emergency program that more funds would
be made available as needed. Dole hammered
the point home yesterday.
"We had a program in place," Dole said.
"There's no cap on it. .. . It's not $625 million.
It's going to be adequate resources . If it's going
to be $1 billion, it's going to be $1 billion. If it's
going to be $2 billion, it's going to be $2 billion."
Subject to possible changes by next week's ac
tion, the emergency farm loans under discussion
are available under two programs. One, run by
the Farmers Home Administration, offers direct
loans to farmers. The other uses government
guarantees to encourage banks to extend more
loans. Agriculture department regulations were
relaxed last week to meet complaints that loan
applications had been blocked and delayed by
red tape.
Dole was skeptical in his talk to the farm group
about chances for passage of amendments to the
program, advising his audience: "If you don't like
what you have, I'm not certain you're going to
get much more."
Ouestioning the wisdom of one pending
amendment to the emergency program which
would allow speeding up of loan payments. Dole
asked: "If you start advancing farmers a third or
a half, what are they going to have when they
harvest? Nothing."
Khadafy: Destroy U.S.
CHICAGO — Libyan leader Moammar
Khadafy urged black U.S. servicemen yesterday
to leave the military and create a separate army
because the United States "must be destroyed."
Khadafy, in a 40-minute speech sent live to a
Nation of Islam convention via satellite from

Libya, urged U.S. blacks to fight for an indepen
dent state because they have been excluded by
whites from political and social life in the United
States.
"This country (the United States) must be
destroyed," Khadafy said. "They (whites) refuse
to accept you as American citizens. This means
you are obliged to create a separate and indepen
dent state. The whites force you to do this by
refusing you in political and social life."
The Rev. Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the
Nation of Islam, called Khadafy "a fellow
struggler in the cause of liberation" of blacks.
"Brother Khadafy is a man the world does not
understand," said Farrakhan, whose approxi
mately 10,000 followers are one faction of the
Black Muslim movement in the United States.
He claims Islam as his religion and preaches
black supremacy and separatism.
Farrakhan, who supported the 1984 presiden
tial campaign of the Rev. Jesse Jackson, founder
of Operation PUSH, said the news media distorts
Khadafy's views, making him into "a living mon
ster."
The Rev. Willie Barrow, acting director of Op
eration PUSH, was among the crowd, made up
mostly of blacks, who attended the 1 985 Interna
tional Savior's Day Convention at an armory on
the city's South Side.
Attendance was estimated at 12,000 by Abdul
Wali Muhammad, a Farrakhan spokesman.
NASA blasts Air Force
WASHINGTON — The head of the space
agency criticized the Air Force and the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for a
plan to launch some satellites aboard surplus
missiles rather than using the space shuttle, and
said it will cost NASA $500 million.
"I don't want to suggest that anything dark is
going on here, but some people think this whole
affair may be a heavy-handed scheme by the Air
Force to give the shuttle a black eye," said
NASA Administrator James Beggs. "You know,
the old syndrome that if it wasn't invented here
(at the Air Force), it can't be all that good."
"I don't like it," Beggs told The Washington
Post. "It is not good for our short-term future
and makes it that much more difficult for us
(NASA) to get on an even footing in the next five
years."
At the heart of the feud is an Air Force deci
sion to refurbish and redevelop obsolete Titan II
intercontinental ballistic missiles to launch up to
12 Air Force satellites and three NOAA
satellites that the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration had assumed would be
flying on its shuttle.
Beggs said he had long assumed that NOAA
and the Air Force were committed to using the
shuttle although no formal agreement had been
signed.
"I'm not worried about the long-term effects
of this decision because there's a limit on the
number of Titan lis they have to move in on our
business," Beggs said. "What bothers mc is that
they decided to move in on us in the first place. It
doesn't help NASA any."
The Air Force last year decided to decommis
sion its 51 remaining Titan lis after a fire in 1982
destroyed one of them in its silo in Arkansas. The
Air Force has removed 23 of the missiles from
silos in Arkansas, Kansas and Arizona and sent
them to Norton Air Force Base in San Bernar
dino, for storage.
When NOAA heard about the Air Force
move, its acting administrator, Anthony Calio, a
former NASA official, contacted the Air Force

about launching three advanced weather
satellites called Metsat (for Meteorological
Satellite) into polar orbit over the next seven
years.
"The Air Force has offered me a deal that's
going to save me $90 million, and I'm going to
take it," Calio said in an interview. "This agency
has a budget ot $1 billion a year so we're talking
about 10 percent of our annual budget. This is
strictly a business deal and nothing more than
that."
Calio said the agency would have to spend
$100 million to redesign the Metsats to fly on the
shuttle, plus $105 million in launch fees. Calio
said the Air Force will charge NOAA $115 mil
lion for the three Titan II launches, a net saving
of $90 million.
Beggs said he does not think NOAA will save
that much. He also said the Air Force is going to
bear the refurbishment cost to redevelop the
Titan 11, a cost Beggs said could reach $100 mil
lion.
"I believe what we're talking here is a savings
to NOAA and a net loss to the U.S. Treasury,"
Beggs said. "I think this whole scheme should be
looked at very carefully by the administration
and by Congress."
Taking these satellites off the shuttle will cost
NASA more than $500 million in lost business,
he said.
Beggs said he is concerned that the Air Force
plan could set a dangerous precedent. He said he
worries that the new geographical survey Landsat
satellite, not yet approved by the Reagan admin
istration, might move to a Titan II and that some
commercial customers might back away from the
shuttle onto Titan lis.
"All these people can argue that they're flying
cheaper if they don't have to reconfigure their
satellites for the shuttle," Beggs said. "But all 1
know is that this trend means fewer payloads for
the shuttle and the more missions we fly the
cheaper we get."
An Air Force spokesman declined comment.
A boost for tax plan
WASHINGTON — House Ways and Means
Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D
-111.), quiet until now on tax simplification, said
yesterday he would cooperate with the adminis
tration in moving a bill through his committee.
Rostenkowski's decision, to be announced in a
speech to the New York Economics Club tonight,
is a boost to President Reagan's hopes for bipar
tisan cooperation on legislation to simplify the
tax code.
"I would like very much to see a Ways and
Means product in cooperation with Treasury and
the House Democratic and Republican leader
ship," Rostenkowski said in an inteview.
"I d like to see us do a good job of tax reform
or simplification, and I'd like ultimately to have
my committee considered the tax-writing com
mittee rather than the revenue-raising com
miteee," he said in a reference to the tax bills of
the last three years.
Rostenkowski's decision was somewhat a
surprise. Since he took over the House tax
writing committee in 1981, he has not been
known as an activist chairman, and there were
suggestions he was biding his time, waiting to try
for a leadership post.
When the Treasury Department proposed its
tax-simplification plan last November, Ros
tenkowski endorsed the general idea of reform
but said any legislation would require presiden
tial leadership.

Khadafy: Destroy U.S.
CHICAGO — Libyan leader Moammar
Khadafy urged black U.S. servicemen yesterday
to leave the military and create a separate army
because the United States "must be destroyed."
Khadafy, in a 40-minute speech sent live to a
Nation of Islam convention via satellite from

Libya, urged U.S. blacks to fight for an indepen
dent state because they have been excluded by
whites from political and social life in the United
States.
"This country (the United States) must be
destroyed," Khadafy said. "They (whites) refuse
to accept you as American citizens. This means
you are obliged to create a separate and indepen
dent state. The whites force you to do this by
refusing you in political and social life."
The Rev. Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the
Nation of Islam, called Khadafy "a fellow
struggler in the cause of liberation" of blacks.
"Brother Khadafy is a man the world does not
understand," said Farrakhan, whose approxi
mately 10,000 followers are one faction of the
Black Muslim movement in the United States.
He claims Islam as his religion and preaches
black supremacy and separatism.
Farrakhan, who supported the 1984 presiden
tial campaign of the Rev. Jesse Jackson, founder
of Operation PUSH, said the news media distorts
Khadafy's views, making him into "a living mon
ster."
The Rev. Willie Barrow, acting director of Op
eration PUSH, was among the crowd, made up
mostly of blacks, who attended the 1 985 Interna
tional Savior's Day Convention at an armory on
the city's South Side.
Attendance was estimated at 12,000 by Abdul
Wali Muhammad, a Farrakhan spokesman.
NASA blasts Air Force
WASHINGTON — The head of the space
agency criticized the Air Force and the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for a
plan to launch some satellites aboard surplus
missiles rather than using the space shuttle, and
said it will cost NASA $500 million.
"I don't want to suggest that anything dark is
going on here, but some people think this whole
affair may be a heavy-handed scheme by the Air
Force to give the shuttle a black eye," said
NASA Administrator James Beggs. "You know,
the old syndrome that if it wasn't invented here
(at the Air Force), it can't be all that good."
"I don't like it," Beggs told The Washington
Post. "It is not good for our short-term future
and makes it that much more difficult for us
(NASA) to get on an even footing in the next five
years."
At the heart of the feud is an Air Force deci
sion to refurbish and redevelop obsolete Titan II
intercontinental ballistic missiles to launch up to
12 Air Force satellites and three NOAA
satellites that the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration had assumed would be
flying on its shuttle.
Beggs said he had long assumed that NOAA
and the Air Force were committed to using the
shuttle although no formal agreement had been
signed.
"I'm not worried about the long-term effects
of this decision because there's a limit on the
number of Titan lis they have to move in on our
business," Beggs said. "What bothers mc is that
they decided to move in on us in the first place. It
doesn't help NASA any."
The Air Force last year decided to decommis
sion its 51 remaining Titan lis after a fire in 1982
destroyed one of them in its silo in Arkansas. The
Air Force has removed 23 of the missiles from
silos in Arkansas, Kansas and Arizona and sent
them to Norton Air Force Base in San Bernar
dino, for storage.
When NOAA heard about the Air Force
move, its acting administrator, Anthony Calio, a
former NASA official, contacted the Air Force

about launching three advanced weather
satellites called Metsat (for Meteorological
Satellite) into polar orbit over the next seven
years.
"The Air Force has offered me a deal that's
going to save me $90 million, and I'm going to
take it," Calio said in an interview. "This agency
has a budget ot $1 billion a year so we're talking
about 10 percent of our annual budget. This is
strictly a business deal and nothing more than
that."
Calio said the agency would have to spend
$100 million to redesign the Metsats to fly on the
shuttle, plus $105 million in launch fees. Calio
said the Air Force will charge NOAA $115 mil
lion for the three Titan II launches, a net saving
of $90 million.
Beggs said he does not think NOAA will save
that much. He also said the Air Force is going to
bear the refurbishment cost to redevelop the
Titan 11, a cost Beggs said could reach $100 mil
lion.
"I believe what we're talking here is a savings
to NOAA and a net loss to the U.S. Treasury,"
Beggs said. "I think this whole scheme should be
looked at very carefully by the administration
and by Congress."
Taking these satellites off the shuttle will cost
NASA more than $500 million in lost business,
he said.
Beggs said he is concerned that the Air Force
plan could set a dangerous precedent. He said he
worries that the new geographical survey Landsat
satellite, not yet approved by the Reagan admin
istration, might move to a Titan II and that some
commercial customers might back away from the
shuttle onto Titan lis.
"All these people can argue that they're flying
cheaper if they don't have to reconfigure their
satellites for the shuttle," Beggs said. "But all 1
know is that this trend means fewer payloads for
the shuttle and the more missions we fly the
cheaper we get."
An Air Force spokesman declined comment.
A boost for tax plan
WASHINGTON — House Ways and Means
Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D
-111.), quiet until now on tax simplification, said
yesterday he would cooperate with the adminis
tration in moving a bill through his committee.
Rostenkowski's decision, to be announced in a
speech to the New York Economics Club tonight,
is a boost to President Reagan's hopes for bipar
tisan cooperation on legislation to simplify the
tax code.
"I would like very much to see a Ways and
Means product in cooperation with Treasury and
the House Democratic and Republican leader
ship," Rostenkowski said in an inteview.
"I d like to see us do a good job of tax reform
or simplification, and I'd like ultimately to have
my committee considered the tax-writing com
mittee rather than the revenue-raising com
miteee," he said in a reference to the tax bills of
the last three years.
Rostenkowski's decision was somewhat a
surprise. Since he took over the House tax
writing committee in 1981, he has not been
known as an activist chairman, and there were
suggestions he was biding his time, waiting to try
for a leadership post.
When the Treasury Department proposed its
tax-simplification plan last November, Ros
tenkowski endorsed the general idea of reform
but said any legislation would require presiden
tial leadership.
Dole promises farm help
WASHINGTON — Senate majority leader
Robert Dole (R-Kan.) yesterday advised a con
ference on the nation's farm crisis that the ad
ministration is prepared to spend whatever is re
quired to carry out its emergency farm credit pro
gram, but warned that it will not "help every
farmer in every state."
"We're serious about it, we're concerned
about farmers," Dole said. "But I also believe we
have to be very candid: We're not going to be
able to help every farmer in every state."
Dole addressed the meeting, made up
primarily of legislators and officials from mid
western grain-growing states, after Secretary of
Agriculture John Block promised during a televi
sion interview to that "there will be adequate
funding" to ensure that loans called for in the
emergency program which the administration put
into action Friday will be available to help farm
ers with spring planting.
"We will implement these programs ag
gressively, immediately," Block said during an
interview on NBC News' televised "Meet the
Press."
The secretary and the senator were reinforcing
administration positions that will be challenged
next week when the Republican-run Senate fol
lows through on a compromise agreement to con
sider four amendments offered by each party for
additional emergency farm relief. The agree
ment, which ended a filibuster by farm-belt
senators that held up confirmation of Edwin
Meese 111 as attorney general for four days, will
offer Democrats a new opportunity to score poli
tical points against the Republican administra
tion in the once solidly Republican farm belt.
Although the amount currently earmarked for
short-term credit programs is $625 million,
Block said in announcing the decision to press
the emergency program that more funds would
be made available as needed. Dole hammered
the point home yesterday.
"We had a program in place," Dole said.
"There's no cap on it. .. . It's not $625 million.

dent state. The whites force you to do this by
refusing you in political and social life."
The Rev. Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the
Nation of Islam, called Khadafy "a fellow
struggler in the cause of liberation" of blacks.
"Brother Khadafy is a man the world does not
understand," said Farrakhan, whose approxi
mately 10,000 followers are one faction of the
Black Muslim movement in the United States.
He claims Islam as his religion and preaches
black supremacy and separatism.
Farrakhan, who supported the 1984 presiden
tial campaign of the Rev. Jesse Jackson, founder
of Operation PUSH, said the news media distorts
Khadafy's views, making him into "a living mon
ster."
The Rev. Willie Barrow, acting director of Op
eration PUSH, was among the crowd, made up
mostly of blacks, who attended the 1 985 Interna
tional Savior's Day Convention at an armory on
the city's South Side.
Attendance was estimated at 12,000 by Abdul
Wali Muhammad, a Farrakhan spokesman.
NASA blasts Air Force
WASHINGTON — The head of the space
agency criticized the Air Force and the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for a
plan to launch some satellites aboard surplus
missiles rather than using the space shuttle, and
said it will cost NASA $500 million.
"I don't want to suggest that anything dark is
going on here, but some people think this whole
affair may be a heavy-handed scheme by the Air
Force to give the shuttle a black eye," said
NASA Administrator James Beggs. "You know,
the old syndrome that if it wasn't invented here
(at the Air Force), it can't be all that good."
"I don't like it," Beggs told The Washington
Post. "It is not good for our short-term future
and makes it that much more difficult for us
(NASA) to get on an even footing in the next five
years."
At the heart of the feud is an Air Force deci
sion to refurbish and redevelop obsolete Titan II
intercontinental ballistic missiles to launch up to
12 Air Force satellites and three NOAA
satellites that the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration had assumed would be
flying on its shuttle.
Beggs said he had long assumed that NOAA
and the Air Force were committed to using the
shuttle although no formal agreement had been
signed.
"I'm not worried about the long-term effects
of this decision because there's a limit on the
number of Titan lis they have to move in on our
business," Beggs said. "What bothers mc is that
they decided to move in on us in the first place. It
doesn't help NASA any."
The Air Force last year decided to decommis
sion its 51 remaining Titan lis after a fire in 1982
destroyed one of them in its silo in Arkansas. The
Air Force has removed 23 of the missiles from
silos in Arkansas, Kansas and Arizona and sent
them to Norton Air Force Base in San Bernar
dino, for storage.
When NOAA heard about the Air Force
move, its acting administrator, Anthony Calio, a
former NASA official, contacted the Air Force

about launching three advanced weather
satellites called Metsat (for Meteorological
Satellite) into polar orbit over the next seven
years.
"The Air Force has offered me a deal that's
going to save me $90 million, and I'm going to
take it," Calio said in an interview. "This agency
has a budget ot $1 billion a year so we're talking
about 10 percent of our annual budget. This is
strictly a business deal and nothing more than
that."
Calio said the agency would have to spend
$100 million to redesign the Metsats to fly on the
shuttle, plus $105 million in launch fees. Calio
said the Air Force will charge NOAA $115 mil
lion for the three Titan II launches, a net saving
of $90 million.
Beggs said he does not think NOAA will save
that much. He also said the Air Force is going to
bear the refurbishment cost to redevelop the
Titan 11, a cost Beggs said could reach $100 mil
lion.
"I believe what we're talking here is a savings
to NOAA and a net loss to the U.S. Treasury,"
Beggs said. "I think this whole scheme should be
looked at very carefully by the administration
and by Congress."
Taking these satellites off the shuttle will cost
NASA more than $500 million in lost business,
he said.
Beggs said he is concerned that the Air Force
plan could set a dangerous precedent. He said he
worries that the new geographical survey Landsat
satellite, not yet approved by the Reagan admin
istration, might move to a Titan II and that some
commercial customers might back away from the
shuttle onto Titan lis.
"All these people can argue that they're flying
cheaper if they don't have to reconfigure their
satellites for the shuttle," Beggs said. "But all 1
know is that this trend means fewer payloads for
the shuttle and the more missions we fly the
cheaper we get."
An Air Force spokesman declined comment.
A boost for tax plan
WASHINGTON — House Ways and Means
Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D
-111.), quiet until now on tax simplification, said
yesterday he would cooperate with the adminis
tration in moving a bill through his committee.
Rostenkowski's decision, to be announced in a
speech to the New York Economics Club tonight,
is a boost to President Reagan's hopes for bipar
tisan cooperation on legislation to simplify the
tax code.
"I would like very much to see a Ways and
Means product in cooperation with Treasury and
the House Democratic and Republican leader
ship," Rostenkowski said in an inteview.
"I d like to see us do a good job of tax reform
or simplification, and I'd like ultimately to have
my committee considered the tax-writing com
mittee rather than the revenue-raising com
miteee," he said in a reference to the tax bills of
the last three years.
Rostenkowski's decision was somewhat a
surprise. Since he took over the House tax
writing committee in 1981, he has not been
known as an activist chairman, and there were
suggestions he was biding his time, waiting to try
for a leadership post.
When the Treasury Department proposed its
tax-simplification plan last November, Ros
tenkowski endorsed the general idea of reform
but said any legislation would require presiden
tial leadership.
Dole promises farm help
WASHINGTON — Senate majority leader
Robert Dole (R-Kan.) yesterday advised a con
ference on the nation's farm crisis that the ad
ministration is prepared to spend whatever is re
quired to carry out its emergency farm credit pro
gram, but warned that it will not "help every
farmer in every state."
"We're serious about it, we're concerned
about farmers," Dole said. "But I also believe we
have to be very candid: We're not going to be
able to help every farmer in every state."
Dole addressed the meeting, made up
primarily of legislators and officials from mid
western grain-growing states, after Secretary of
Agriculture John Block promised during a televi
sion interview to that "there will be adequate
funding" to ensure that loans called for in the
emergency program which the administration put
into action Friday will be available to help farm
ers with spring planting.
"We will implement these programs ag
gressively, immediately," Block said during an
interview on NBC News' televised "Meet the
Press."
The secretary and the senator were reinforcing
administration positions that will be challenged
next week when the Republican-run Senate fol
lows through on a compromise agreement to con
sider four amendments offered by each party for
additional emergency farm relief. The agree
ment, which ended a filibuster by farm-belt
senators that held up confirmation of Edwin
Meese 111 as attorney general for four days, will
offer Democrats a new opportunity to score poli
tical points against the Republican administra
tion in the once solidly Republican farm belt.
Although the amount currently earmarked for
short-term credit programs is $625 million,
Block said in announcing the decision to press
the emergency program that more funds would
be made available as needed. Dole hammered
the point home yesterday.
"We had a program in place," Dole said.
"There's no cap on it. .. . It's not $625 million.
It's going to be adequate resources . If it's going
to be $1 billion, it's going to be $1 billion. If it's
going to be $2 billion, it's going to be $2 billion."
Subject to possible changes by next week's ac
tion, the emergency farm loans under discussion
are available under two programs. One, run by
the Farmers Home Administration, offers direct
loans to farmers. The other uses government
guarantees to encourage banks to extend more
loans. Agriculture department regulations were
relaxed last week to meet complaints that loan
applications had been blocked and delayed by
red tape.
Dole was skeptical in his talk to the farm group
about chances for passage of amendments to the
program, advising his audience: "If you don't like
what you have, I'm not certain you're going to
get much more."
Ouestioning the wisdom of one pending
amendment to the emergency program which
would allow speeding up of loan payments. Dole
asked: "If you start advancing farmers a third or
a half, what are they going to have when they
harvest? Nothing."
Khadafy: Destroy U.S.
CHICAGO — Libyan leader Moammar
Khadafy urged black U.S. servicemen yesterday
to leave the military and create a separate army
because the United States "must be destroyed."
Khadafy, in a 40-minute speech sent live to a
Nation of Islam convention via satellite from

Libya, urged U.S. blacks to fight for an indepen
dent state because they have been excluded by
whites from political and social life in the United
States.
"This country (the United States) must be
destroyed," Khadafy said. "They (whites) refuse
to accept you as American citizens. This means
you are obliged to create a separate and indepen
dent state. The whites force you to do this by
refusing you in political and social life."
The Rev. Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the
