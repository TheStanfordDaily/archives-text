"A child, conceived by artificial insemination, is born to a couple.
Federal law holds that the biological father is not responsible for
children conceived by donated sperm; California law assumes a
husband to be the father of his wife's children, and responsible for
them. The husband in this case is the biological father, the child has
two mothers, a genetic mother and the women who bore him.
Whose child is it?"
