Senate debates farm aid
WASHINGTON — The Senate, amid pleas
for help from visiting rural state legislators,
opened debate yesterday on farm-credit legisla
tion designed to ensure that American farmers
mired in debt have enough money to plant crops
this spring.
Senate Democrats introduced the relief mea
sure in the form of an amendment to a bill auth
orizing $175 million in non-food drought aid to
African nations. A vote on that bill was sched
uled for today.
The amendment, offered by Sen. Edward
Zorinsky (D-Neb.), provides $1.85 billion in ad
ditional federal guaranteed farm loans and
eliminates a requirement that farmers show they
can generate a profit before obtaining such loans.
It also authorizes the Farmers Home Administra
tion to provide $100 million to buy down loan in
terest rates.
"Without the type of credit assistance I have
outlined, thousands of farmers will be faced with
financial ruin," said Zorinsky, ranking Democrat
on the Senate Agricultural Committee.
"Unless we act quickly to assist our nation's
farmers, what is now an agricultural credit crisis
will develop into an economic disaster for all of
rural America,"he said.
Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-Kan.)
reluctantly agreed to allow the amendment to
end a filibuster on Saturday by farm-state
Democrats against Senate confirmation of Edwin
Meese 111 as attorney general.
As yesterday's session began, Dole continued
to speak against changing this year's federal farm
aid program to provide emergency assistance.

"We have a good farm program in place,"
Dole said. "I don't believe we do the American
farmer any good by advancing more loan pay
ments to him. We would be accomplishing more
by concentrating on the nation's top priority —
getting the deficit down."
Throughout the day, meanwhile, hundreds of
farmers, state legislators, and governors from the
Farm Belt testified at hearings and met with con
gressmen to plea for federal help.
"Some farmers took bad risks and got them
selves into credit trouble, but most farmers didn't
get into crises on their own." South Dakota Gov.
Bill Janklow told a House-Senate farm caucus
chaired by Zorinsky.
"It is our government policy of deficit spending
which increased interest rates and overvalued the
dollar. The farmer isn't to blame for that," said
Janklow, a Republican.
Court refuses gay case
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court,
despite strong objections from the court's two
liberals, yesterday declined to hear the appeal of
a high school guidance counselor fired from her
job after she revealed she was bisexual.
Justice William Brennan Jr., joined by Justice
Thurgood Marshall, said the court should decide
the case because it "starkly presents" a
homosexual-rights issue that has "swirled
nationwide for many years."
They argued that this case was significant be
cause it involved a woman who was fired not only
because of her sexual preference but also for re
vealing her bisexuality to colleagues. The justices
fell two votes short of the four votes needed to

grant review.
I he counselor, Marjorie Rowland, sued the
Mad River (Ohio) School Board after her dismis
sal. A federal jury in 1981 ordered the hoard to
pay her more than $50,000 in damages. The 6th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that
ruling, saying the dismissal did not violate
Rowland's constitutional rights to equal protec
tion or freedom of speech.
The appeals court, Brennan said, was ruling
that public employees could he fired simply for
expressing a sexual preference. "Nothing in our
precedents requires that result," he said;
"indeed, we have never addressed the topic."
Justice Lewis Powell Jr., stil! recuperating from
prostate surgery, did not take part in the decision
in Rowland v. Mad River Local School District.
Powell is not expected to take the bench this
week for oral arguments, according to the court
press officer, Toni House.
