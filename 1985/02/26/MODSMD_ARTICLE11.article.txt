Mengele reward offered
LOS ANGELES — A $1 million reward was
offered yesterday for information leading to the
capture and prosecution of accused Nazi war
criminal Josef Mengele. the so-called "Angel of
Death" of Auschwitz.
A group of Americans who have requested
anonymity established the reward fund, said
Martin Mendelsohn, attorney for the Simon
Wiesenthal Center for Holocaust Studies.
The offer was prompted by recent reports that
Mengele may have been arrested after World
War II by U.S. authorities, but somehow escaped
justice, he said.
"That was what impelled the people to come to
us and say, 'Do something. " Mendelsohn said.
In January, an Army document was made
public that quoted an intelligence officer as
saying Mengele may have been arrested in
Vienna. On Feb. 14. former Army soldier Walter
Kempthorne, 59, of Riverside, Calif., said he saw
a man at a prison camp in Germany in July 1945
who was identified to him as Mengele.
"We're getting him in shape to get hung."
Kempthorne said he was told by guards who were
forcing the man to exercise.
A Senate subcommittee is holding hearings on
the Mengele case and attempting to determine if
he was in U.S. custody and. if so, why he was
released.
Mengele is believed to be alive, 73 years old.

and living somewhere in Paraguay. He is accused
of participating in the murder of at least 400,000
people, mostly Jews, and conducting horrifying
medical experiments on inmates at Auschwitz in
Poland.
The $1 million, which has been placed in a
bank, would be paid after Mengele is extradited
to either West Germany or Israel.
