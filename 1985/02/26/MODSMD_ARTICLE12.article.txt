## Timing your anxieties at the post office 
### 
Dear Bug Me:
When do the post office people put
out mail? When should I give up? Is
there an optimum time to check for
mail? How long does it take a letter to
get across the country? - A concerned
student
Maybe it's because of the new price
for postage stamps, but I've noticed
an unusual increase in interest in the
local P.O. this week.
I've heard that politicians regard
each complaint from a constituent as
representative of 100 other people
who have the same gripe but don't
have any 22-cent stamps to put on
their irate letters.
By that calculation, there are about
300 brilliant Stanford students out
there who would like to impose order
on the movements of millions of
pieces of paper — thick acceptance
letters, thin thank you notes, pastel
love letters and brown phone bills —
so that they can predict with an ac
curacy of a quarter hour when their
300 P.O. boxes will be full.
To do a small test experiment of
this theory, I checked my mail box
every day fgr a week at different
times each day, but my results
weren't very conclusive because I
didn't get any mail.
Looking for less depressing ways to
answer this question, I called Bob
Hewitt, general supervisor of delivery
and collections for the main post of
fice servicing Palo Alto and Stanford
University.
According to Hewitt, the four or
five sorters at Stanford's post office
have a 10 a.m. goal for getting the
mail into the boxes. Their ability to
reach this goal depends on the
volume of mail that day.
They continue working until all the
mail is put out and the loads that
come later in the day have been put in
boxes, usually by 1:30 p.m.

Some sections get finished earlier
than others. There are groupings by
number around the walls of the build
ing, and the separate section on the
outside of the building, which they af
fectionately term "the outhouse," is
one of these. My box happens to be in
this section, but Hewitt didn't tell me
if I'm on some sort of once-monthly
delivery schedule or not.
With these goals, you should plan
trips to your box depending on which
day's mail you want to get.
All of your yesterday's mail will be
ready and waiting before 9 p.m., but

if you're interested in timeliness, a
trip with an ETA of 1 0:15 or so might
be optimum. These two approached
could be combined to good effect by a
2 p.m. run, which would give you the
complete load of today's mail.
I wouldn't presume to be able to
choose the best combination for your
particular biorhythmic and metabolic
rates. This is a very individual deci
sion. I would even go so far as to
advise that people who enjoy radi
cally different mail collection
schedules probably shouldn't plan to
get married.
About your other question, Hewitt
says the official time required for a
letter to go across the country is three
to four days. I didn't test this theory
like the other one because no one 1

know on the East Coast has written to
me in the last week.
In the last 25 years, how many fra
ternities have been thrown of)
campus? Which fiat has the highest
record? - J R.
You should be shot for asking that
question. It took me about five hours
of leaving messages in Dean oj Some
thing or Other Norm Robinson's of
fice and wading through yard-long
card catalog drawers in University
Archives (a bizarre time capsule in a
Victorian sitting room) to find what is
probably an incomplete answer.
It's not that there were so many
incidents of suspension, but that to
find them you have to search through
all the other reports of rowdy and
semi-illegai behavior that fraternity
brothers have ever exhibited.
My tally is four suspensions for
three different frats since 1960. The
Delta Tau Deltas were evicted the
first time in 1973, but ended their
two-year hiatus after one year.
Then again in 1976, they held a
bachelor party for an active and cele
brated by attacking the Beta Theta Pi
and Delta Upsilon houses, effectively
losing their housing privileges.
This was the highest number of
evictions I could find. The other two
suspensions were given to Zeta Psi
and Phi Delta Theta. In 1981, the
Zetes bound a Mills College woman
and dunked her in the house pond,
hitting her head. The Phi Delts were
less picky, offending a whole gather
ing of Mills College women at an ex
change party in 1966.
The Zetes petition to return on
campus has just recently been turned
down, with Robinson predicting an
other two rush/pledge/initiation
cycles will have to go by before they
will be allowed back.

Why is the clock tower five minutes
fast? - Shirley Wang
David Beach, the mechanical engi
neering professor who winds the
clock, didn't know why the clock
might be fast. It must be wound every
fourth day, and if he forgets, it may
be slow.
In fact, I called time and
synchronized my watch with this au
thority and then checked the clock
tower to my watch's reading, only to
find that it was two minutes slow.
This is a strange warping of time that
I can't explain. I'm not a physics
major and don't plan to be.
Rewinding the antique clock takes
about 15 minutes, and Beach would
be happy to train volunteers inter
ested in the process of winding the

three capstans that control the clock,
chime and strike mechanisms that run
the clock hands, play the tune, and
mark the hours respectively.
Betty Grass, whose husband re
pairs the clock when it needs it. told
about a time when they were finishing
a job last October and had to ask a
passing student for the correct time,
so they could reset the clock. His an
swer was off by a whole hour, and
they almost didn't notice it because it
was dark outside. Betty guessed that
maybe Stanford students have trou
ble getting the right time. I agree; I
think we're cursed somehow by
Einstein's ghost.
But then, it would be difficult to
hang Mickey Mouse hands on an in
vincible digital clock.

Why is it that when you want to
know the time, you haven't heard the
clock tower bells ring in the last two .
hours, but when you 're taking a mid
term you hear them every quarter of •
an hour? Why can they be heard from
houses on May field Avenue, but can't
be from Green Library?
Anonymous
I refer you to my theory about
Einstein in the last question's answer.
Whether my explanation is right or
not, I think your description of the
phenomenon is true, or at least my
experience concurs with it. Maybe I
should do some more rigorous ex
periments.

of leaving messages in Dean oj Some
thing or Other Norm Robinson's of
fice and wading through yard-long
card catalog drawers in University
Archives (a bizarre time capsule in a
Victorian sitting room) to find what is
probably an incomplete answer.
It's not that there were so many
incidents of suspension, but that to
find them you have to search through
all the other reports of rowdy and
semi-illegai behavior that fraternity
brothers have ever exhibited.
My tally is four suspensions for
three different frats since 1960. The
Delta Tau Deltas were evicted the
first time in 1973, but ended their
two-year hiatus after one year.
Then again in 1976, they held a
bachelor party for an active and cele
brated by attacking the Beta Theta Pi
and Delta Upsilon houses, effectively
losing their housing privileges.
This was the highest number of
evictions I could find. The other two
suspensions were given to Zeta Psi
and Phi Delta Theta. In 1981, the
Zetes bound a Mills College woman
and dunked her in the house pond,
hitting her head. The Phi Delts were
less picky, offending a whole gather
ing of Mills College women at an ex
change party in 1966.
The Zetes petition to return on
campus has just recently been turned
down, with Robinson predicting an
other two rush/pledge/initiation
cycles will have to go by before they
will be allowed back.

Why is the clock tower five minutes
fast? - Shirley Wang
David Beach, the mechanical engi
neering professor who winds the
clock, didn't know why the clock
might be fast. It must be wound every
fourth day, and if he forgets, it may
be slow.
In fact, I called time and
synchronized my watch with this au
thority and then checked the clock
tower to my watch's reading, only to
find that it was two minutes slow.
This is a strange warping of time that
I can't explain. I'm not a physics
major and don't plan to be.
Rewinding the antique clock takes
about 15 minutes, and Beach would
be happy to train volunteers inter
ested in the process of winding the

three capstans that control the clock,
chime and strike mechanisms that run
the clock hands, play the tune, and
mark the hours respectively.
Betty Grass, whose husband re
pairs the clock when it needs it. told
about a time when they were finishing
a job last October and had to ask a
passing student for the correct time,
so they could reset the clock. His an
swer was off by a whole hour, and
they almost didn't notice it because it
was dark outside. Betty guessed that
maybe Stanford students have trou
ble getting the right time. I agree; I
think we're cursed somehow by
Einstein's ghost.
But then, it would be difficult to
hang Mickey Mouse hands on an in
vincible digital clock.

Why is it that when you want to
know the time, you haven't heard the
clock tower bells ring in the last two .
hours, but when you 're taking a mid
term you hear them every quarter of •
an hour? Why can they be heard from
houses on May field Avenue, but can't
be from Green Library?

I refer you to my theory about
Einstein in the last question's answer.
Whether my explanation is right or

phenomenon is true, or at least my
experience concurs with it. Maybe I
should do some more rigorous ex

Dear Bug Me:
When do the post office people put
out mail? When should I give up? Is
there an optimum time to check for
mail? How long does it take a letter to
get across the country? - A concerned
student
Maybe it's because of the new price
for postage stamps, but I've noticed
an unusual increase in interest in the
local P.O. this week.
I've heard that politicians regard
each complaint from a constituent as
representative of 100 other people
who have the same gripe but don't
have any 22-cent stamps to put on
their irate letters.
By that calculation, there are about
300 brilliant Stanford students out
there who would like to impose order
on the movements of millions of
pieces of paper — thick acceptance
letters, thin thank you notes, pastel
love letters and brown phone bills —
so that they can predict with an ac
curacy of a quarter hour when their
300 P.O. boxes will be full.
To do a small test experiment of
this theory, I checked my mail box
every day fgr a week at different
times each day, but my results
weren't very conclusive because I
didn't get any mail.
Looking for less depressing ways to
answer this question, I called Bob
Hewitt, general supervisor of delivery
and collections for the main post of
fice servicing Palo Alto and Stanford
University.
According to Hewitt, the four or
five sorters at Stanford's post office
have a 10 a.m. goal for getting the
mail into the boxes. Their ability to
reach this goal depends on the
volume of mail that day.
They continue working until all the
mail is put out and the loads that
come later in the day have been put in
boxes, usually by 1:30 p.m.

Some sections get finished earlier
than others. There are groupings by
number around the walls of the build
ing, and the separate section on the
outside of the building, which they af
fectionately term "the outhouse," is
one of these. My box happens to be in
this section, but Hewitt didn't tell me
if I'm on some sort of once-monthly
delivery schedule or not.
With these goals, you should plan
trips to your box depending on which
day's mail you want to get.
All of your yesterday's mail will be
ready and waiting before 9 p.m., but

if you're interested in timeliness, a
trip with an ETA of 1 0:15 or so might
be optimum. These two approached
could be combined to good effect by a
2 p.m. run, which would give you the
complete load of today's mail.
I wouldn't presume to be able to
choose the best combination for your
particular biorhythmic and metabolic
rates. This is a very individual deci
sion. I would even go so far as to
advise that people who enjoy radi
cally different mail collection
schedules probably shouldn't plan to
get married.
About your other question, Hewitt
says the official time required for a
letter to go across the country is three
to four days. I didn't test this theory
like the other one because no one 1

know on the East Coast has written to
me in the last week.

ternities have been thrown of)
campus? Which fiat has the highest
