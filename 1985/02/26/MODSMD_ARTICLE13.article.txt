## The 						Stanford Daily Talk with Nicaragua 
### 
President Reagan's tough talk on the Sandi
nista government last week makes more urgent
the need for the United States and Nicaragua to
enter into formal negotiations aimed at ending
bloodshed in Latin America and political turmoil
at home.
At the first news conference of his second term
in office, Reagan launched his sharpest attack on
the Sandinista regime to date, saying "it is not a
government chosen by the people."
But by vowing not to oust the Sandinistas "if
they say uncle" to U.S. pressure, the president
tacitly affirmed that the Sandinistas have cul
tivated a considerable political following in their
own country and among several of their Latin
American neighbors. Rhetoric aside, Reagan's
pledge that "we have an obligation to be of help
where we can" in resolving Nicaragua's problems
should be extended to involving the Sandinista
government in negotiations that would legitimize
the concerns of both countries.
The Reagan administration stands to gain from
a negotiated settlement in Nicaragua. By impos
ing a ban on covert aid to the Nicaraguan
"contra" rebels in fiscal year 1984, Congress
dealt the administration a powerful bi-partisan
blow from which Reagan, judging from his deter
mination to increase aid this year despite contin
ued opposition, has yet to recover. Formal
negotiations would offer the president a chance
to save face, especially if Congress decides to
continue the ban on aid in FY 1985.

The president's Nicaraguan policy must protect
the 12,000 or more contras — the so-called
"freedom fighters" — with which the United
States has sought to oppose the Sandinistas. The
Ortega government has said it would offer am
nesty to the contras if they would lay down their
arms. Formal negotiations could make peace a
reality and offer sanctuary to rebel forces cur
rently cut off from congressional support.
To put it politely, the current U.S. policy in
Nicaragua could stand improvement. There is no
indication that U.S. support of the contras helps
"moderate" Sandinista policies. If anything,
Reagan's drive for renewed congressional aid
threatens to drive Nicaragua toward a closer rela
tionship with the Soviet Union, if only to obtain
the weapons the Sandinistas say they need for
defense.
Within a formal negotiating framework, the
president would have an opportunity to suggest a
greatly expanded U.S. trade policy with
Nicaragua that gives the Sandinista government
an incentive to reassess its relations with Mos
cow. And there is the possibility of a new U.S.-
Nicaraguan defense pact that, if intergrated
within a larger Latin American alliance, could
help control arms transfer in this hemisphere,
fostering greater global stability.
Before Congress votes on renewing aid to the
contras, it's time for the president to inaugurate a
diplomatic initiative true to the ideals for which
the Nicaraguan people waged a revolution.
