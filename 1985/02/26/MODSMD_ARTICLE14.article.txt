## What's hot and what's not on the Farm 
### 
Some people believe that humans
have basic needs: food, decent
housing, a decent education (oh,
yawn) and so forth. While I don't
quibble with the basic notion, I do
take exception to the particulars. The
main premise of this viewpoint will be
as follows: What people want more

VIEWPOINT

than anything else is to know what's
hot and what's not. Therefore, I will
present a list of five items that are hot
and five items that are not. Hence,
without further delay, 1 offer the cur
rent entries, in no particular order.
What's hot?
1. Bulky bicycles: So what if your
$450 12-speed is faster, lighter and
better looking? Does it have a hand
lebar bell like those 1940 look-a-like
bikes? Does it have rounded, semi
circular handlebars and goofy tires
like a mountain bike? Two years ago
the only people who would even look
at bikes like these were poverty
stricken grad students. Now, I think
we'll all see the tiny minority of S.U.'s
15,000 cyclists that hasn't yet made
the change conforming toute de suite.
2. One-hundred percent cotton
clothing: Still have those lingering
vestiges of the polyester '70s? Get rid
of them. Read those labels when
Mom takes you shopping. Throw
those cotton-poly blends (ugh!),
acrylics (disgusting!) and man-made
fibers (gross!) off the rack.
3. Referring to San Francisco as the
"the City": Of course, getting all
sorts of jargon into your vocabulary
(Ouad. MemChu, LSJUMB) is an in

tegral part of a Stanford education,
but this is an especially important
one. Most critical is to talk about "the
City" knowledgably and favorably,
but never, ever go there.
4. Flat shoes with no socks: This is
especially important during the
coldest and rainiest days in winter.
Women can wear pumps, especially
the perforated leather ones to allow
more exposure to the elements, or
loafer type shoes. For the fellows,
loafers, boat moccasins or the like are
the rage The hottest of the hot have
shorts and short-sleeve shirts to fur
ther demonstrate their impervious
ness to the cold that has the not-hot
shivering.
5. Thinly veiled sexism, homop
hobia and racism: Why, you ask,
would such ignorant pastimes be
popular among America's educa
tional elite? Because they're fun.

Every little incident brings letters of
protest pouring into The Daily. Let's
hope this coming academic year starts
with another review of the incoming
freshwomen's physical attributes.
What's not?
1. Being political: Not only are po
litical issues impossible to resolve,
they're a total bore. Those dreamy
headed, '60s leftovers who jump at
any opportunity to recreate the
halycon days gone by are totally passe.
My advice to them is to consider what
happened to the Stanford Progressive
Alliance. Get with the apathetic
mainstream, buddy, or get off
campus.
2. United Stanford Workers: They
want to be paid a decent wage which
will only raise our tuition. They're
liable to go on strike at any moment,

disrupting our already tenuous con
nection to the outside world. Why
don't they just do what Don Kennedy
says? After all, he does have a doc
torate.
3. Campus scuplture: Granted not
all of them are ugly, misplaced and
meaningless, but given sheer num
bers, whoevef is responsible was
bound to get lucky sooner or later.
The ones without water flowing
through them are even worse than
those with water. At least the
fountain-type ones can be filled with
sudsy detergent occasionally or
double as wading pools.
4. Fratspeak: I don't care if it was
written up by The Daily, it's still not
hot. First of all, it's another language,
which makes it difficult. If it's not En
glish, spoken the way I was brought
jjup speaking it, I don't want to hear it.
Second, it's spoken by a minority of
the campus. As this year's election
demonstrated amply (Remember the
bilingual ballot proposition? Of
course you don't.), the minority had
better learn to speak our language.
Stanford, speak upper-middle-class
English, or get out!
5. Co-ops: My mother and father
don't pay all this money for me to
have to come here and cook my own
meals. Why should 1 have to clean the
kitchen? Isn't that why we tolerate
USW? I never did dishes at home,
why should I do them here?
There you have it, people. Ten
things to think about until our minds
meet again. Just remember, in the
meantime, I'll be watching you;
you're my inspiration.

clothing: Still have those lingering
vestiges of the polyester '70s? Get rid
of them. Read those labels when
Mom takes you shopping. Throw
those cotton-poly blends (ugh!),
acrylics (disgusting!) and man-made
fibers (gross!) off the rack.
3. Referring to San Francisco as the
"the City": Of course, getting all
sorts of jargon into your vocabulary
(Ouad. MemChu, LSJUMB) is an in

tegral part of a Stanford education,
but this is an especially important
one. Most critical is to talk about "the
City" knowledgably and favorably,
but never, ever go there.
4. Flat shoes with no socks: This is
especially important during the
coldest and rainiest days in winter.
Women can wear pumps, especially
the perforated leather ones to allow
more exposure to the elements, or
loafer type shoes. For the fellows,
loafers, boat moccasins or the like are
the rage The hottest of the hot have
shorts and short-sleeve shirts to fur
ther demonstrate their impervious
ness to the cold that has the not-hot
shivering.
5. Thinly veiled sexism, homop
hobia and racism: Why, you ask,
would such ignorant pastimes be
popular among America's educa
tional elite? Because they're fun.

Every little incident brings letters of
protest pouring into The Daily. Let's
hope this coming academic year starts
with another review of the incoming
freshwomen's physical attributes.
What's not?
1. Being political: Not only are po
litical issues impossible to resolve,
they're a total bore. Those dreamy
headed, '60s leftovers who jump at
any opportunity to recreate the
halycon days gone by are totally passe.
My advice to them is to consider what
happened to the Stanford Progressive
Alliance. Get with the apathetic
mainstream, buddy, or get off
campus.
2. United Stanford Workers: They
want to be paid a decent wage which
will only raise our tuition. They're
liable to go on strike at any moment,

disrupting our already tenuous con
nection to the outside world. Why
don't they just do what Don Kennedy
says? After all, he does have a doc
torate.
3. Campus scuplture: Granted not
all of them are ugly, misplaced and
meaningless, but given sheer num
bers, whoevef is responsible was
bound to get lucky sooner or later.
The ones without water flowing
through them are even worse than
those with water. At least the
fountain-type ones can be filled with
sudsy detergent occasionally or
double as wading pools.
4. Fratspeak: I don't care if it was
written up by The Daily, it's still not
hot. First of all, it's another language,
which makes it difficult. If it's not En
glish, spoken the way I was brought
jjup speaking it, I don't want to hear it.
Second, it's spoken by a minority of
the campus. As this year's election
demonstrated amply (Remember the
bilingual ballot proposition? Of
course you don't.), the minority had
better learn to speak our language.
Stanford, speak upper-middle-class
English, or get out!
5. Co-ops: My mother and father
don't pay all this money for me to
have to come here and cook my own
meals. Why should 1 have to clean the
kitchen? Isn't that why we tolerate
USW? I never did dishes at home,
why should I do them here?
There you have it, people. Ten
things to think about until our minds
meet again. Just remember, in the
meantime, I'll be watching you;
you're my inspiration.

Some people believe that humans
have basic needs: food, decent
housing, a decent education (oh,
yawn) and so forth. While I don't
quibble with the basic notion, I do
take exception to the particulars. The
main premise of this viewpoint will be
as follows: What people want more

VIEWPOINT

than anything else is to know what's
hot and what's not. Therefore, I will
present a list of five items that are hot
and five items that are not. Hence,
without further delay, 1 offer the cur
rent entries, in no particular order.
What's hot?
1. Bulky bicycles: So what if your
$450 12-speed is faster, lighter and
better looking? Does it have a hand
lebar bell like those 1940 look-a-like
bikes? Does it have rounded, semi
circular handlebars and goofy tires
like a mountain bike? Two years ago
the only people who would even look
at bikes like these were poverty
stricken grad students. Now, I think
we'll all see the tiny minority of S.U.'s
15,000 cyclists that hasn't yet made
the change conforming toute de suite.
2. One-hundred percent cotton
clothing: Still have those lingering
vestiges of the polyester '70s? Get rid
of them. Read those labels when
Mom takes you shopping. Throw
those cotton-poly blends (ugh!),
acrylics (disgusting!) and man-made
fibers (gross!) off the rack.
