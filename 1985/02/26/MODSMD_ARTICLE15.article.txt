# Aid, not acquiescence, for Afghan rebels
## 
### 
For the past five years, bands of disorganized,
out-numbered and ill-equipped Afghan Muslim
guerrillas have held a powerful Soviet force of
more than 120,000 soldiers to a stand-off in the
most brutal conflict of rccent memory.
The Soviet occupation of Afghanistan continues
to ruin an economy which neared agricultural self
sufficiency and industrial development on the eve
of the invasion. The Soviets have adopted a
scorched-earth policy in order to destroy peasant
villages which supply-food, shelter and intelligence
to the rebels. They have effectively depopulated
much of the countryside through forced emigration
or extermination. Three million Afghans, fully 30
percent of the pre-invasion population, have fled to
refugee camps in neighboring Pakistan and Iran.
More than 500.000 Afghans have starved or been
killed or wounded by Soviet high-altitude bombing
and the use of MiG-24 "Hind" helicopter gunships,
which saturate the target area with rockets and
gattling-gun fire.
Recent moves to consolidate power in Afghanis
tan indicate that the Soviets plan to stay. Soviet of
ficials staff key positions in the government of Pres
ident Babrak karmal, developing an Afghan com
munist bureaucracy based on the Soviet model.
While the Afghan army dwindles from desertion,
karmal's secret police, the KHAD, has grown to
20.000 under the control of KGB officers. And last
tall 900 seven-to-nine-year-old Afghan children
were sent to Soviet Central Asia for 10 years of po
litical education in the first of many such shipments
designed to train the next generation of Afghans in
communist party organization.
Worldwide condemnation of the invasion was
immediate and unified. The United States. China
and other nations of the region have provided
humanitarian assistance to the refugees in Pakistan
(more than $1 million per day from U.S. and U.N.
organizations) and have insisted on a negotiated
withdrawal of Soviet troops and a return to a non
aligned. self-determined Afghan government.
Weapons and medical supplies, however, have
been slow in coming and meager in amount.
Limited aid to the rebels reflects current U.S.
policy, which maintains that there is little hope of
militarily dislodging the Soviets. Policy makers
believe that increased aid to the Afghan rebels will

only draw in the Soviets more heavily, potentially
escalating the conflict beyond Afghanistan's bor
ders. The Reagan administration, therefore, has
resisted Democratic calls for a doubling of covert
military aid to the rebels to include shoulder-fired
missiles and light anti-tank weapons. The current
aid policy is one of damage control. Levels are suf
ficient to keep alive Afghan resistance while not

substantial to provoke Soviet reprisals against
Pakistan, the route of aid, nor upset renewed U.S.-
Soviet relations.
It is clear that Soviet and Afghan ambitions, un
der the Karmal government, do not end at Af
ghanistan's borders. Pakistan's President Zia Ul
haq recognizes that a strong and unchecked Soviet
force in Afghanistan and a Karmal government
backed by Soviet tanks pose a threat to his country.
Zia, therefore, has allowed arms shipments to the
Mujihadeen rebels to pass through his country at
great risk of Soviet retaliation. De facto extension
of Soviet southern borders through Afghanistan
has improved Soviet strategic access to the Arabian
Sea and to the Straits of Hormuz from airfields
recently constructed by the Soviets in the Helmand
Valley. President Karmal himself is not blind to the
power his country now wields in the region. As
Karmal said in 1981, with Soviet help "our army
will become a strong and energetic army capable of
defending peace and security not only in Afghanis
tan but in the region as well."
It is not clear, however, whether increased aid to
the Mujihadeen would draw the Soviets into Pakis
tan or hurt overall U.S.-Soviet relations. Strong
rebel resistance, bolstered by U.S. aid, would
prevent the Soviets and the Karmal regime from

seeking further gains in the region. The so-called
"pragmatists," who argue that escalated aid U.S.
military support for the Mujihadeen will damage
U.S.-Soviet relations, forget that detente between
the United States and the Soviet Union was main
tained while the Soviets openly supplied arms to
the North Vietnamese during a war which took
54,000 American lives.
In fact, an aggressive U.S. response to the Af
ghan conflict might clarify U.S.-Soviet relations.
During the Cuban Missile Crisis, President Ken
nedy's response to the Soviet Union was clear and
resolute. The result was an improvement of rela
tions based on renewed respect.
Given the current stand-off between the rebel
and Soviet forces, there is little chance of a
negotiated settlement. The Soviets require a guar
antee that a "friendly" government remain in
Kabul. President Karmal insists that Soviet forces
stay as a deterrent to western incursions. These
demands are unacceptable to the rebels and to the
other nations of the region (and should remind one
of Soviet conditions in the Yalta Accords which
ensured Soviet contol of Eastern Europe). The
Soviets will not withdraw from Afghanistan as
America did from Vietnam. World opinion has
little effect on their policies. The Soviets will be in
clined to negotiations more favorable to the
Mujihadeen only when the costs of occupying Af
ghanistan approach the strategic benefits.
Rebel resistance, stiffened by substantial U.S.
military and medical aid, will improve the chances
of a negotiated end to the war and secure the bor
ders of Pakistan and other countries neighboring
Afghanistan by preventing the Karmal government
and Soviet forces from consolidating power.
Regardless of these considerations of U.S. interests
in the region, increased United States assistance to
the Afghan rebels is justified on moral principles
alone: America should demonstrate an unwavering
commitment to genuine freedom movements.
The Mujihadeen rebels stand alone against the
might of the Soviet army. They do not believe that
their defeat is inevitable. That they stake their lives
in a fight for freedom is sufficient call for our sup
port. How long must they wait?
