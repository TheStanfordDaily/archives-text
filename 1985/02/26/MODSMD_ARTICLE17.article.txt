ASSU re-assessment
I am writing in response to Robert
Johnson's letter of indictment against
the ASSU Senate (The Daily, Feb.
20). While 1 cannot possibly address
all of his charges, including those of
"paranoia and secrecy," I would like
to express my viewpoint of the sub
ject of special fee assessments.
Johnson contends that it is the job
of the senate simply to "check over"
budgets before placing them on the
ballot and "nothing more." How
does he define "check[ingj over"?
The soundness of a budget is contin
gent upon more than a mindless
addition of numerical figures. In my
opinion, the senate and its appropri
ations committee must also investi
gate the validity and strength of the
programs offered by student organi
zations. 1 would assume that students
oppose the allocation of funds to
groups which, because of organiza
tional or other weaknesses, run a risk
of bankruptcy the following year. In
addition, the senate must look into
the cost of the program in relation to
the benefits gained by the student
body. I stand opposed, for example,
to relinquishing a net amount of
$40,000 to an organization which

provides benefits to only 120 stu
dents. In this sense, 1 would argue
that such an organization is not
"worthy" of receiving student funds.
The decision to place a fee assess
ment request on the ballot ultimately
rests with the students. A group can
earn a place on the ballot by gaining
the approval of the senate and col
lecting the signatures of 10 percent .
of the student body. In the case
where a group does not gain the
approval of the senate, the organiza
tion may circulate a petition and
collect the signatures of 20 percent "
of the students, thus earning a place*
on the ballot.
I cannot argue with the fact that
the students are the ASSU. But *•
similarly, the ASSU is the students:!
as representatives, we seek to
promote the interests of the entire "
student community. One way we -*
attempt to do so is by carefully
reviewing and monitoring the finanv
cial strength of student organiza- «•*
tions. After all, it is the students
money they are spending.
