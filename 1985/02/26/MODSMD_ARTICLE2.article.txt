# University recognizes Tri Delts
## 
### LYNDA JOHNSON-TATE Editorial staff 
Ihe Delta Delta Delta sorority,
better known as the Tri Delts, has
been recognized by the University,
Director of the Row Diana Conklin
said yesterday.
Ihe Tri Delts have been seeking
recognition from the University sThce
the end of December so they may
hold meetings and spring rush on
campus and use the University's
name for their activities.
To obtain University recognition,
the sorority had to submit a letter
from the National Tri Delt organiza
tion to Residential Education stating
the Stanford chapter would be an au
tonomous group, which would only
be advised — and not governed — by
the national organization. They also
had to submit a petition promising to
abide by the University's rules.
Junior Stacy Torres, president of
the Tri Delts, said the group has been
careful recently in its activities,
hoping good behavior would increase
chances of recognition. After learning
the Tri Delts had gained recognition,
Torres said she was looking forward
to "having mixers with fraternities,
using the University's name in
philanthropic events and meeting on
campus instead of in alumni's
houses." When asked what the
sorority would do first, Torres
replied, "Celebrate."
Delta Delta Delta is the seventh
sorority to receive University
recognition. The other six are Alpha
Kappa Alpha, Alpha Phi. Delta
Gamma, Kappa Alpha Theta, Kappa
Kappa Gamma and Pi Beta Phi.
Torres said she and the 40 other
pledges were excited about being the
charter chapter at Stanford and were
grateful for "the excellent alumni ad
visers," including Tri Delt field rep
resentative Michelle Popp, who has
spent the past month helping and en
couraging the chapter.
