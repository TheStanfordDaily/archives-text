## Women netters get by Pepper dine, 6-3 Card staves off upset bid 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
For the first time this season, the
Stanford women's tennis team was
tested yesterday. The team that
seemed so invincible suddenly wasn't.
Stanford did beat visiting Pep
perdine 6-3 and upped its record to
X-0 and match-winning streak to 34.
Hut a cakewalk it wasn't.
The Waves, 14th ranked and
owners of a 7-9 record, took Cardinal
netters to three sets in three singles
matches and won two of them. Then
they went the distance at No. 1
doubles and won that, too.
It was a big change, maybe even a
shock, to Stanford, which had won its
first seven dual matches by a
combined 58-3 margin and entered
yesterday's match with four straight
shutouts.
"1 think they have to realize it's not
a 9-0 world," Cardinal Coach Frank
Brennan said of his No. 1-ranked
team. "In fact, it's kind of nice to
break the ice a little bit and take the
presure off.
"I'm not happy they (some Stan
ford players) lost by any means, hut
streaks can put a lot of pressure on
you, and we took some of that off
today."
During the match, though, the
pressure was on. especially in the
doubles matches. Yesterday marked
the first time all season Stanford
didn't win five singles matches and
clinch the victory before the doubles.
"I'm secretly very happy we didn't
clinch it after the singles," Brennan
said. "There's a big difference playing
doubles after you've clinched it and
playing doubles when you haven't. So
1 got to see my doubles teams under
pressure for a little while."
The pressure on the doubles teams

lasted until Patty Fendick and Anna
Ivan disposed of Pepperdine's Carole
Bertand and Margaret Hopkins, 6-1,
6-4, at No. 2. Minutes later, Step
hanie Savides and Kay Tittle won at
No. 3, 6-4, 6-3.
Meanwhile, at No. 1 doubles, the
fifth-ranked team of Leigh Anne
Eldredge and Linda Gates was strug
gling. Although Eldredge was slowed
by a pulled leg muscle and Gates
never really warmed up after not
playing singles, the Cardinal pair
managed to win the second set, 6-2,

after losing the first, 7-5.
But as darkness decended on the
courts, Pepperdine's Pam Jung and
Nicola Lusty pulled away for the 7-5,
2-6, 6-3 victory.
It was Jung's second triumph of the
afternoon over an opponent ranked
fifth nationally. The 46th-rated Jung
came from behind to beat fifth-rated
Anna Ivan at No. 1 singles, 2-6, 6-2,
6-4.
"I think I probably should have
held her back one more match,"
Brennan said of his decision to play

Ivan, a freshman who missed most of
the season with the flu, at No. 1. "I
should have played her at No. 2 today
and given her a little easier match.
"But I was very pleased with her
because she took her hiss very well,
and then came back and played very
well in the doubles."
Yesterday's match was the last of
an eight-match homestand for Stan
ford. Now the Cardinal takes its show
on the road, first to Fullerton State
Saturday and then to ninth-ranked
San Diego State Sunday.
