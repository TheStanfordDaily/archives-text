# Baseball hosts Stanislaus State

On the surface, today's game here between Stan
ford and Stanislaus State would seem to be a mis
matcn. On the surface. In the middle. And on the
bottom.
However, Stanford Coach Mark Marquess, who
became the winningest manager in Cardinal history
this weekend, is not taking the Warriors too lightly.
"They've won the Division 111 championship a
couple of times," he said. "We're obviously the
better club, but they can beat us if they get a good
pitching performance."
Indeed, Stanislaus has fielded some impressive
teams over the past nine years. During that time,
the Warriors have won two Division 111 titles and

have been runners-up twice, but only three starters
return this year.
Unfortunately for Coach Jim Bowen, the
chances of getting the good pitching performance
Marquess spoke of are slim. The Warriors are 4-8
— 3-6 in the Northern California Athletic Confer
ence — mainly because of their weak pitching. The
one bright spot has been Bob Tidwell (2-1), who
may start today.
Stanford is riding a five-game winning streak and
has an 1 1-3 overall record. The key to the Card
inal's recent success has been the emergence of an
offense that includes more than the powerful bat of
Rick Lundblade.
"We're on a nice winning streak now," said
Lundblade. "When everyone chips in, it makes it

easier because you get better pitches to hit."
One Cardinal who has been chipping in lately is
shortstop John Verducci. Verducci hit more home
runs — two — this weekend than he had hit in his
three previous years on the Farm.
Verducci believes that the team's slow start of
fensively may have been due to early season jitters.
"Most of this game is mental," he said. "You can
outthink yourself instead of just going up there and
swinging."
The Cardinal has shown lately that hitting can be
contagious — a disease that could spell trouble for
the beleaguered Warrior pitching staff.
Stanford continues its preparation for its
weekend Pacific 10 Conference opener with a
game against U.S. International tomorrow at
Sunken Diamond.
