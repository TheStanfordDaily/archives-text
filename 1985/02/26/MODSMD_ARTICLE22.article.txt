### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
Stanford Men's Tennis Coach
Dick Gould is using some unusual
criteria to choose his lineup
against San Diego State and the
University of San Diego today and
tomorrow.
Because both matches are at
home, Gould would like to see as
many of his players as possible
make their 1:15 p.m. classes.
Those without classes, or who
have not missed many early after
noon classes, will play.
"We've had a lot of kids miss
classes, so I'm just going to take a
count and see who needs to go,"
Gould said.
Gould did say he would like to
play four of his top six players in
the singles matches, but the
doubles competition should get
more attention this week in partic
ular because Stanford is sending
its doubles teams to I.a Jolla
Friday through Sunday for the
Pacific Coast Doubles Champion
ships.
"We're still experimenting with
our doubles teams. We've made
some progress, but we still have a
long way to go, too," Gould said.

Gould had no complaints with
the way the doubles team of Pat
McEnroe and Derrick Rostagno
defeated Paul Roybal and Bill
Wakefield of Fresno State 6-4, 6-4
in the finals of the Northern Cali
fornia lntercollegiates Friday.
"It was one of our better
matches — very solid against a
solid opponent," Gould said. "Pat
and Derrick will play together all
this week and will be one of our
three doubles teams in the doubles
championships."
San Diego State's overall record
is 14-9. Julio Noriega of Peru, for
merly the top junior player in
South America, leads the Aztecs
in singles and doubles play. The
match begins today at 1:30 p.m.
on the Varsity Courts.
Tomorrow, the Cardinal plays
USD, currently 8-3. USD's toug
hest competition thus far has been
against Brigham Young and
Northeastern Louisiana. USD lost
to both those teams, but has won
eight matches relying on the top
singles and No. 1 doubles matches.
Jim McNamee. in particular, has
had much success this season for
USD at No. 1 singles and doubles.
He is 10-2 overall, 5-1 in singles.
