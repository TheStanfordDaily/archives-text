## 'Mrs. Soffel': a self-assured, masterful drama 
### STEVE VINEBERG Editorial staff 
The title character in "Mrs. Suffer (played by Diane
Keaton) is the wife of a prison warden (Hdward Her
rmann) in turn-of-the-century Pittsburgh. When she isn't
sick with tever — a malady she seems peculiarly prone to
— she brings the prisoners little comforts, like blankets in
the cold weather and Bibles which, a devoutly religious
woman, she sometimes reads aloud to them. A pair of
brothers convicted of murder, Jack and Ed Biddle, arrive
to the accompaniment ol much romantic h\steria from
young women in the city; even one ol Kate Soffel's
daughters keeps a scrapbook ol their trial and protests
their innocence. And before long Ed (Mel Gibson) has
captivated Kate, too, through a series of challenges to her
religious faith and a sort ol melancholic magnetism, l-irst
she pleads his cause to the governor, to the extreme con
sternation of her rigid husband, anil then, when Ed
professes his love for her, she helps him to escape.

Ron Nyswaner based his screenplay on a true story; the
director, Gillian Armstrong, and the two stars. Diane
Keaton and Mel Gibson, have welded its sensational ele
ments into a hard, dense, pure film with something ol the
agonized intensity of a Dostoevski novel. In that way it
resembles another picture suggested by a real-life charac
ter. Truffaut's 1975 "The Story of Adele H." Though the
neuroticism ol Isabeilc Adjani s Adele, who chases
halfway across the world after a man scandalously un
worthy ol her. is certainly different in motivation and
form from that of Kate Soffel. both women surrender
themselves to a romantic passion that represents a release
from the incarceration of respectability (Adele is the
of Victor Hugo) and ultimately defines them.
Kate, trapped in a miserable marriage, responds to the
romantic misery of a lost man; when he tiptoes up the
stairs to her bedroom and asks her to run away with him
and his brother (Matthew Modine). she accedes and flings
away the chance of ever returning to her home and three
children.
Kate Soffel is one of those characters who acts with a
kind of daring that is both impulsive and compulsive. She
behaves in a way that not only contradicts what she knows
to be legally wrong and understands to be abhorrent to so
ciety — like Nora in Ibsen's " A Doll's I louse" — but also
removes her forever, she believes, from God's mercy. Fas
cinated by the darkest corner of human existence, the cor
ner she is sure God's grace will never illuminate, she casts
herself into it. severing every tie to her old life in a single
motion. Making love to Ed, who races through the
fugitive weeks in a state of unrelieved terror, she repeats
the credo she taught her children when they were fright
ened — that God would protect them. " I guess God won't
protect me anymore, will he, Ed?" she asks him. Kate acts
with such conviction, such completeness, that she takes
your breath away.
On the strength of her performances in "Reds," "Shoot
the Moon." "The 1 ittle Drummer Girl" (the last half
hour) and now "Mrs. Soflel," Diane Keaton has climbed

to the highest plane in the pantheon of current American
actresses; no one except for Blythe Danner (whose work
is mostly confined to the stage and television) equals her.
At some point — after "Annie Hall," 1 think — the comic
tentativencss, the charming self-consciousness of the
Woody Allen movies began to turn to a fresh commit
ment, originally a professional decision to expanding her
range (in "Interiors," where she failed to triumph over the
constraints of Allen's writing and direction, and in
"Manhattan," where she succeeded) and then an emo
tional immersion that only our greatest performers have
ever exposed themselves to. She no longer makes conces
sions to the audience; in the great, neglected domestic
tragedy "Shoot the Moon," where she plays a wife who
throws her philandering husband out, and in "Mrs. Sof
fel," she doesn't fuss with gracious flourishes that might
make her look more attractive or come across as more
sympathetic, and she refuses to lead us gently into the tur
moil of the character's consciousness— she plunges right
in, and that means we have to jump in too or else remain
detached and displeased on the sidelines.
I suspect that the unshaded power of her acting (and of
Albert Finney's) in "Shoot the Moon" may have scared
off a lot of viewers and forced them to take cover bv mini-

mizing the difficulty and danger of her achievement; one
woman I know described her most amazing scene in that
picture, in which she gets high and stirs up painful
memories hy singing Beatles songs to herself, as
"ridiculous." But Keaton brings emotional states to the
screen that I've never seen anyone reproduce before,
though they certainly occur in life — in "Shoot the Moon"
the sudden, painful discovery that the nostalgic longing in
a silly old lyric can evoke real and recent experience, and
in "Mrs. Softer a joy in sexual abandonment that co
exists with the doomed feverousness we saw in her first,
sickbed scene. In Diane Keaton's performance, Kate Sof
fel flies from fever to fever.
In "Shoot the Moon" Keaton and Albert Finney were
former lovers and present adversaries of equal strength.
Mel Gibson matches Keaton's erotic intensity — their
scenes smolder even before there is any actual physical
contact between them — but his sexual potency here, as in
"The Bounty," derives from a crippled handsomeness, a
passiveness, so that Keaton is the stronger partner in their
romance. (We assume that is part of his appeal to Kate;
she flees a man whose repressed emotions make him
strong in a cold, concealed way.) The amazing rapport be
tween the two stars recalls the movies Katharine Hepburn
made in the 1930s with a succession of less aggressive men
(notably, of course, Gary Grant), but it places this sort of
relationship in a perilous setting and takes it much farther
— into the bedroom.
If what is most extraordinary about Keaton's portrayal
is how much she lays on the table, the beauty ol Mel Gib
son's acting is in how much he keeps hidden. We know
that Ed is using Kate to gain the instruments for his escape
— she is aware of it. too — but we can't be sure how great
a part his love for her plays in his behavior, or indeed if his
passion is all a brilliant performance. When he appears in
her home to sweep her up in his escape, we are as startled
as she is — by his audacity, and by his willingness to risk
capture so that he can have her with him. Also, the
filmmakers hold back the crucial information about
whether or not the Biddies are guilty of the murder
they've been jailed for, until very late — long after we've
stopped wondering about it.and (more importantly) past
the point at which we've begun to think we understand Ed
completely. Mel Gibson's Fletcher Christian in "The
Bounty" also deepened in the most surprising places at
the most unanticipated moments; almost unheralded, the
man whom People Magazine chose last week as the
sexiest male in the world has become a major actor.
Gibson's growth and the reaffirmation of Keaton's pre
eminence are not the movie's only good news. Gillian

Armstrong's first feature, "My Brilliant Career," was one
of the first imports to publicize the arrival of the
Australian film industry, but 1 found its style and several
of its incidents derivative and its proto-feminist heroine
baffling; her declarations of independence struck me as
willful rather than liberated, petty insurrections by a
poutv princess. And though Armstrong's second effort,
the spiky musical "Star Struck," was very bright and en
tertaining, and exuded confidence, 1 would never have
predicted she had a "Mrs. Soffel" in her. This isn't merely
a self-assured film; ii is a masterful one, directed and shot
(by the endlessly gifted Russell Boyd, who photographed
"Star Struck" and most of Peter Weir's movies) with a
poet's feeling for images The opening — a flash of indus
trial fire against an inky sky — is the most impressive in
troduction to a picture since "Iceman" (by another
Australian emigre, Fred Schepisi), and the sequences that
follow demonstrate the same impressionistic vividness.
Boyd seems to have lit the film by lightning: The snow
that mutes the Biddies' and Kate's flight from their sepa
rate prisons, an early morning landscape, the chase in

which the outlaws' sleigh struggles to steer clear of a rifle
shooting posse, are magical visions, and though they
reminded me of scenes from "McCabe and Mrs. Miller"
and "My Uncle Antoine" and"The Grey Fox," they
don't repeat anything we've seen — they are newly
painted canvasses, freshly snatched from an artist's exper
ience.
Several reviews of the film have criticized it for being
too "dark." but in Armstrong's conception industrial Pit
tsburgh is as much a character in "Mrs. Soffel" as indus
trial London was in David Lynch's "The Elephant Man."
Ron Nyswaner doesn't actually suggest this element in his
screenplay, but when you see those smokestacks at the
outset, and then move into the murky prison corridors
where Kate's two younger children play at murderer and
executioner, you can't help seeing Kate and the Biddies as
products of a tainted, claustrophobic environment. A shot
of a prepubescent newsboy with a stubby cigarette butt in
his mouth might be the emblem of this stunted period, as
much as the children in Walker Evan's photographs in
"Let Us Now Praise Famous Men" are of theirs.
Armstrong's worst mistake (and certainly Nyswaner's)
may be in not developing Kate's family more. Edward
Herrmann, who looks a little like Hitler with his foolish
moustache and his slicked hair parted on the side and
combed over his forehead, announces his gnarled, un
happy character the moment he appears. The two girls,
proper, conventional Irene (Trini Alvarado, who has mel
ting Carol Kane eyes), a bride-to-be at 16, and Margaret
(Jennie Dundas, Lilly in "The Hotel New Hampshire"),
who has a streak of her mother's rebellious nature, are
more suggestively drawn, but we don't see enough of
them; we just begin to understand how they reflect the
conflicts within and between their parents when the film
strays away from them. On the other hand, though Jack
Biddle is a supporting character in this story, Armstrong
gives Matthew Modine (the star of "Birdy") enough to
do; hij is a simpler performance than Keaton's and Gib
son's, but it's a very fine one on its own terms. He carries
the scars of a corrupted childhood on his face; both touch
ing and scary, he charges his acting with some of the dis
turbing tension between possible victim and possible killer
that Mel Gibson addresses in his.
There are miscalculations in rhythm in the second half
of the film, and an ill-judged comic scene involving two
kindly old people who take the fugitives in. but none of
these complaints seems terribly significant in retrospect,
considering what a superb movie "Mrs. Soffel" is. 1 must
confess that once the stars left the prison, I felt let down;
the filmmakers appeared to have spent all their best ideas
arid without the Soffel girls in the background. 1 thought
there were fewer layers of meaning, and yet the intensity
continued, exhaustingly — Armstrong wouldn't lighten
up. But the stunning denouement forces you to rethink
the experience of the second half of the movie; it's all of a
piece, and Armstrong is right (and courageous) not to
compromise by letting the audience off the hook. She
gambles every thing on her instincts, and keeps her camera
trained on those shadowy corners. You sometimes have
the impression that it was Kate Soffel who made her own
movie.
