# The
						modern world confronts the Amish in 'Witness'
## 
### Steve Vineberg 
At what point docs fine filmmaking become
expert manipulation? Peter Weir's "Witness,"
set in Philadelphia and Lancashire County, the
heart of Amish country, straddles the line. In
the men's room of a Philly train station, Samuel
Lapp, a little Amish boy (Lukas Haas) on his
first trip away from home, witnesses a cop's
brutal murder; taken in for questioning along
with his reluctant mother, Rachel, a recent
widow (Kelly McGillis), he identifies one of the
killers — another cop — in a newspaper photo
in a display case. Within a few hours, the
detective in charge of the case, John Book
(Harrison Ford), has figured out the motive —
the victim was attempting to obstruct a ring
dealing speed (seized in a bust four years ear
lier) — and, when Book narrowly escapes being
shot to death himself, he realizes that his chief,
Paul Sehaeffer (Josef Sommer), is in the thick
of it. Wounded, but conscious of the danger to
the child if Sehaeffer tracks either of them

down, he takes the Lapps home and
hides out with them when his injury
prevents him from further traveling.
Buried deep among the Amish,
when: there are no phones and doz
ens of families with names like
"I app," Book can recover his health
and remain concealed from his pur
suets.
Peter Weir didn't select the
William kelkv-l.arl Wallace script;
he replaced the director originally
signed for the project. But you
wouldn't guess that from looking at
the results, nor would you say that the
absence of Weir s usual collaborator,
the photographer Russell Boyd,
caused a disjunction of any kind. Shot
bv John Scale, "Witness ' is a beauty.
I he Amish li\ e as they did in the I Nth
century, tilling the rich Pennsylvania
soil without the conveniences of the
modern age, and so for the Lan
cashire C ounty scenes, which make
up the major portion of the picture,
Seale has returned to the indirect
lighting of the Dutch Masters for in
spiration, and Weii gives them the
hushed purity of Nativity scenes.
(You wish the purity had extended to
the contribution of the composer,
Maurice Jarre, whose music is typi
cal Iv and constantly intrusive. Is there
a retirement age for film composers?)
Amish characters figured impor
tantk in the plot of the 1968 comedy
"Tlu Night 7he\ Raided Minsky's,"

but as far as I know, no movie before
"Witness" has actually depicted the
Amish lifestyle — certainly no direc
tor before Weir has made his way into
this part of the country to shoot it —
and his awareness that he has caught
something new on film is apparent in
the rapt, wondrous tone of especially
the early sequences. (A 1950 Broad
way musical drama called "Plain and
Fancy" took as its subject the conflict
between the Amish old world and the
new, represented by visiting New
Yorkers, but the play never reached
the screen.) When Daniel. Rachel's
blond, wide-eyed suitor (the dancer
Alexander Godunov, in a charming
Jebut) drives Rachel and Samuel into

town to catch the train, his horse
drawn wagon stands at a traffic
clogged intersection, an observer
from a calmer age patiently waiting
for the madness to stop. The train
pulls out, and the Lapps watch a grin
ning Daniel on the road, showing off
for their entertainment, racing his
wagon like a Rpman charioteer with
one arm raised toward the sky and his
feet planted on the driver's seat.
These images are as memorable as
the Javanese puppet play at the
opening of Weir's last movie, " The
Year of Living Dangerously"like
the ham-raising scene in the middle
of the picture, which concludes with a
flowing shot of the home-bound

farmers, filling the dusk with hymns,
they have the startling freshness of
something just discovered. (There
was a barn-raising number in Stanley
Donen's big-hearted 1954 musical
"Seven Brides for Seven Brothers,"
but it looked different — shinier,
more robust — and felt like what it
was: choreography.)
The juxtaposition of Old World
values and New World "preoccupa
tions — far from a new idea but cer
tainly a serviceable one — is the
filmmakers' modus operandi here,
Mftnd ostensibly their theme as well.
Some of its applications are predic
tably cute — the Lapps saying grace
at a hot dog joint in Philadelphia, the

city slicker Book forced to rise before
dawn and milk the cows — but Weir
achieves a few genuinely funny ef
fects by placing this tense, ironic
Philly cop in what is essentially a time
warp. When he wakes from his bullet
induced delirium, he is in Rachel's
father-in-law's home, and a convoca
tion of Amish elders with stern, quiz
zical faces and Old Testament beards
are peering down at him, like the
Brobdingnagians scrutinizing Gul
liver. Decked out in Rachel's hus
band's clothes to avoid looking con
spicuous. Harrison Ford's trans
planted urban hero resembles a goofy
scarecrow. In one scene, having
begun to feel drawn to Rachel, he ap
proaches the house purposefully but
then, seeing Daniel courting her on
the front porch swing, he can only
hang around foolishly — a neglected
swain in a comic pastoral.
In part because of the talent of his
two stars. Weir is able to obtain an
unexpected intensity in the romance
that develops between them. Kelly
McGillis (who played the college stu
dent in love with Tom Conti in
"Reuben, Reuben") has an al 1 -
American face that works against her
believability, but she's actually a good
actress, and Harrison Ford hasn't
performed with this much conviction
in a few years (since before he
switched onto automatic pilot for
"Blade Runner" and the latest "Star
Wars" and "Indiana Jones" install
ments); as Book, he gives his best
sustained performance. Quite apart
from the familiar set-up of this part of
the plot, they maintain a tension in
their scenes together that we under
stand from the outset must end in a
sexual release. Weir continues the
controlled wonderment of the intro
ductory glimpses of Amish life into
these scenes, too, so we experience
the burgeoning relationship as part of
the newness Book encounters when
he crosses the line into Rachel's
world. (It is also, of course, a revela
tion for Rachel, who shatters a taboo
when she takes an illicit lover — but
the movie declines to deal with the
real implications of her actions.)
If Weir weren't such a prodigious
filmmaker, the schematic script
would declare the picture's liberal
conscience in every scene. That must
be what Josef Sommer is doing in it:
A veteran of "Absence of Malice"
and "Silkwood," he seems to have
become a "problem" movie fixture.
He's usually very good, but he can't
do much with the chief villain role in
"Witness," who furnishes one half of
the message — "VIOLENCE IS—,"
which the old Amish patriarch, Eli.
completes lor our benefit: " — VERY
BAD." The movie posits a hero
whose life revolves of necessity
around guns and murders, who sud

denly finds himself living in a society
that abjures these in support ot an
uncorrupted Christian ethic ot resis
tance and passivity; and — more
suggestively — a child raised under
that ethic whose cruel awakening to
the workings of the outside world
start him thinking in terms ot good
gins and bad gu>s. Schaefter. the rep
resentative of modern-day corrup
tion, and Eli. the Bible spouter, oc
cupy the two poles fixing the message
drama structure. Schaefter has
Book's partner killed; Eli lectures
Samuel on Christian tenets while
Rachel hides Book's revolver so the
child can't play with it. I lie first con
frontation between these two schools
of thought is Samuel's unwitting in
volvement in murder; the second
erupts when a trip into town brings
Book in contact with the mockery ot
intolerant bullies — a common occur
rence to the Amish. but one that fires
Book's temper and provokes him to
take (violent) action. The third and
ultimate face-off. we know, awaits
the moment when Schaefter and his
cohorts finally track Book (and the
Lapps) down.
Whatever the shortcomings of this
kind of social-conscience movie, it
does have the potential for addressing
an interesting topic in resonant ways,
and the unusual choice of setting is a
strong point in the film's favor. I an
cashirc County is surely a fine place
to begin discussing the merits and
failings of contemporary society,
However, underneath this fairly
transparent structure lurks another
one — and the real (tin) heart of
"Witness." When Book knocks down
the belligerent townies, we can see
the filmmakers setting a narrative
trap as well as a thematic one: That
third confrontation between opposing
value systems is going to take place
because Book has drawn attention to
himself, allowing Schaefter to locate
him. It's a clumsy piece of exposition,
but necessary to get the picture back
on its real track — as a police thriller.!.
The appearance of the three killers,
carrying firearms into the peaceful
Amish dawn, is frightening!) well di
rected, and so is one man's demise --
even if the mode of death does derive
from Frank Morris (and has already
made it to the screen via D.W. Grif
fith and Carl Dreyer). The problemlis
that, as the movie is constructed, the"
most dramatically effective part ot it
is the violence of the last few minutes,
because the filmmakers have with
held it for so long. In the final analy
sis, "Witness" skirts the issue it
pretends to raise, reducing it to a tan
talizing element in the scheme of a
beautifully made cops-and-killers tale.
