# 'Uncle Vanya' worth seeing despite traditional approach
## 
### NANCY HENRY 
The Stanford Drama Department's
production of Anton Chekhov's
"Uncle Vanya" is a conventional
presentation of a traditional play. It
offers little innovation in interpreta
tion or staging, hut as conventional
theater goes, it has much to offer. The
most striking aspects of this produc-

'Uncle Vanya deals poignantly with
the universal themes of human passion
and reason, the profundity and
triviality of life, and the value of
material and spiritual reward.
Each of the main characters is in a
period of critical self-analysis. Each
questions his past and prospects for
the future.

tion, and perhaps those into which
the most artistic energy was invested,
are the costumes, designed by John
Wilson, and tlie set, designed by
Geoffrey Eroe.
Exceptional attention seems to
have been paid to every aspect of the
19th century Russian dress; striking
gowns, furs, as well as simple peasant
work clothes are consistently and im
pressively authentic. The stage con
struction is quite elaborate, with full
set changes after every act; somber
lighting on dark paneled wood, hung
with religious art work and tools of

daily life, contributes to the al
ternately somber and mystical atmo
sphere director Michael Ouinn
creates in each scene. The one draw
back to this otherwise professionally
crafted production is the makeup. It
is necessary that the actors look much
older than they are; this is a story
about age and aging. The excessive

and obvious application of wrinkles
and powder is only distracting and
unnecessary when the burden of
making us beiieve these are old men
and women should fall on the
performers, some of which ac
complish this more thoroughly than
others.
"Uncle Vanya" offers us several
"scenes from country life.'" This is a
portrait of both aristocratic and
simple life in rural Russia. It also
deals with such universal themes as
human passion and reason, the
profundity and triviality of life, and

the value ot material and spiritual
reward. Each of the main characters
is in a period of critical self-analysis.
Each questions the success of his past
life and prospects for the future. For
tunately, it is the primary characters
that turn in the best performances.
Some of the supporting actors are
quite simply undeveloped and unin
teresting; the most important roles
are the strongest.
Carol Alexander, as a 27-year-old
woman trapped in a marriage to
haughty, parsimonious and
manipulative professor whose intel
lect she once admired, is convincing
as she gives in, if only temporarily, to
passion. Martin Robinson as Astrov,
the young, self-righteous and
handsome doctor manages to strike a
balance which conveys his simulta
neous desire to devote himself to
helping others and satisfying his own
needs. Vanya, played by Tom
Lindblade, is the misplaced rebel and
tragic character â€” tragic because he
seems to realize too late that each
person must make meaning of his
own life. He is romantically rejected,
financially deceived and, like the
others, metaphysically discontent
with life.
This is definitely a play of mo
ments. That is, at a few times in the
production quite a unique intensity is
acheived. The final scene in particu
lar, when Vanya finds the only solu
tion and salvation this unjust life has
offered him, is an emotional and
moving one. The use of music and of
lighting here are the most effective
I've seen at Stanford, and well suited
for the intimate "Little Theatre."
Uncle Vanya is indeed a classic play
and is presented here with respect
and discretion. It plays tomorrow
through Saturday.


Tom Lindblade as Uncle Vanya and Johanna Dickety as Sonya share a tender moment in Anton Chekov's
"Uncle Vanya," a classic portrayal of growing old in rural Russia.
