## Seeing AIDS for what it really is 
### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Senior staff writer 
"Everyone is at risk," said Dennis
McShane, associate professor of Im
munology in describing acquired
immune deficiency syndrome
(AIDS) at a discussion last night at
Roble Hall.
Since 1979, 8,400 Americans
have been diagnosed as having
AIDS, a disease that destroys the
immune system. Approximately 50
percent are white, 25 percent are
black, IK percent are Spanish
American and fewer than 2 percent
are either Asian or Native Ameri
can. Of those diagnosed, approxi
mately 45 percent have died from
the virus.
The gay community, which has
been the most severely affected so
far, has gone through significant
change, McShane said. There is a
"sense of a cloud hanging over the
community," he said.
In the 19705, the gay community
advocated freedom of sexual exper
ience, he said. Since the discovery of
AIDS, this attitude has decreased
dramatically and has been replaced
by a more "adult" one.
In addition, the gay community
has been the nucleus of many of the
movements designed to help those

who already have AIDS.
But McShane said government
funding has not been as forthright.
AIDS "wasn't taken seriously
when it first developed," he said.
The Reagan administration's cut
backs in human services has
lowered the National Institute of
Health's (NIH) budget by 23 per
cent, McShane said. NIH is one of
the major centers doing research on
AIDS.

To fill the void. Congress and the
states are looking to increase fund
ing.
"As the disease finally gets to be
a disease and not a social and politi
cal statement," people will become
increasingly sympathetic to the vic
tims, McShane said. It could prove
to be an integrati -j feature of the
gay community into society.
McShane described numerous
symptoms of the underlying infec

tion. including heavy sweating at
night, diarrhea, a dry cough, fatigue,
bruises that do not go away, con
tinous fevers and shortness of
breath.
Blood donors are now screened
for AIDS, but McShane strongly
discourages anyone from using the
screening to determine if he has
AIDS.
"It is not a test for AIDS," he
said. If the test is positive it means
the person has come in contact with
the virus, but he is not necessarily
infected. "A lot of people will have
the virus, but live perfectly fine," he
said.
McShane warned that another
possible repercussion could be a list
citing all those who have tested
positively. Insurance agencies and
other similar companies could use
the information to raise personal
rates or increase the difficulty of
getting a policy. He encourages any
man who has had sexual contact
with another man since 1979 not to
give blood.
McShane also gave a brief, al
though speculative, history of the
disease. "AIDS originated in
Zaire," he said. "No one knows for
sure" how it was transmitted to the
United States.

During a talk at Roble Hall last night, Dr. Dennis McShane stressed
the need for AIDS to be viewed as not only a homosexual problem.
