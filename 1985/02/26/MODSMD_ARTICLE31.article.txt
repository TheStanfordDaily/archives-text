# Senate to decide on divestment issues
## 
### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
The ASSU Senate tonight is ex
pected to vote on three separate
resolutions concerning the Univer
sity's investments in corporations that
do business with the apartheid gov
ernment of South Africa.
One of the resolutions asks
senators to request that the Board of
Trustees clarifies how it will respond
to a refusal by Motorola Corp. to pro
vide information on its sales practices
to the South African police or mili
tary.
The trustees voted on Feb. 12 to
divest of 124,000 shares of Motorola
if the company resumes sales to the
South African government. A com
pany spokesman says no equipment
has been sold to the military or police
since 19K3. But company officials
refuse to comment on future sales in
tentions. making enforcement of the
board's decision difficult.
William Massy, Stanford vice presi
dent for business and finance, said
after the trustee meeting that the
University would rely on outside spe
cial interest groups as well as its own
resources to monitor Motorola's
sales. The senate resolution, noting
Motorola's past intransigence with

tlitÂ» I 'niversitv. requests an official
response to this lack of cooperation.
A second resolution asks senators
to request that the trustees "re
evaluate Stanford investment policy,
and adopt criteria which define unac
ceptable corporate behavior as
grounds for divestiture."
This resolution is essentially a
restatement of the second part of the
October ASSU referendum on
divestment, which was approved by
the students by a 2,045 to 485 mar
gin. That referendum, in addition to
asking for immediate divestment of
Motorola, called for the University to
"formulate a responsible investment
policy. ..."
A third resolution asks senators to
thank the trustees for approving con
ditional divestment from Motorola.
Senators Jon Adelstein and Mark
Landesmann co-authored the three
resolutions. Both have been active in
anti-apartheid issues since last year.
Adelstein and Landesmann said
each of the resolutions have received
a positive recommendation from the
Senate's Student Affairs Committee,
but Senate Chair Eric Berg pointed
out that only two senators were pres
ent at the committee meeting.
