# Views differ on what's best for South Africa
## Divestment may backfire, warns African tribal leader 
### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
When the Stanford Board of Trus
tees recently voted to soil the Univer
sity's stock in Motorola Corp. under
certain conditions, most pro
divestment, anti-apartheid activists
on campus heralded the decision as a
positive step toward eliminating black
oppression in South Africa.
University President Donald Ken
nedy, a relative moderate on the
issue, declared that conditional
divestment was necessary as a last
resort because Motorola's past sales
to the South African military and
police "constitute substantial social
injury."
But a prominent black South
African leader maintains that
withdrawing vital U.S. capital from
the country — a potential corporate
response to the threat of mass stock
holder divestment — will result in
even more social injury. Statements
made by Zulu Chief Gatsha Buthelezi
in a Feb. 15 New York address to the
United States Council for Interna
tional Business create questions
about the divestment campaigns
raging at Stanford and on a handful of
other campuses across the country .
Buthelezi said disinvestment of
U.S. money would only compound
the economic distress suffered by
South African blacks.
"Millions already live in slum con
ditions." said Buthelezi, "and deeply
biting economic sanctions against
South Africa will condemn a great
many millions and a whole new gen
eration to continue living in appalling
slum conditions."
Buthelezi. chief of the six-million
member Zulu tribe, the largest in
South Africa, was quoted in The New

York Fimes as saying divestment
"would rob American businessmen of
the positive role they could play —
the only role, in tact, that Americans
can play."
These assertions raise an interest
ing question: Are Stanford activists,
in an effort to improve the plight of
blacks in South Africa, actually con
tributing to their duress?
"I certainly don't want to be doing
something that's against the purposes
I want to accomplish," said Jon
Adelstein, co-author of an October
ASSU referendum calling for divest
ment from Motorola and advocating
a more responsible investment policy.
Most supporters of the trustees'
Motorola decision point out that
there is an important distinction be
tween what they want — divestment
— and what Buthelezi fears — disin
vestment.
"1 have no interest in Motorola
getting out of South Africa." said Po
litical Science Prof. Richard Biudy.
chairman of the University's Com
mittee on Investment Responsibility
(C-IR). "I have an interest in stop
ping their sales to the (South African)
police."
Brody said there is a difference be
tween a Stanford decision to sell
stock and a corporation's decision to
disinvest from a country. He dis
counted the theory that divestment
encourages disinvestment because "if
you sell it (stock), someone else had
to buy it."
In January, the 12-member C-IR.
in response to the overwhelmingly
successful ASSU referendum, unani
mously recommended to the board
that Stanford sell its 124.000 shares
