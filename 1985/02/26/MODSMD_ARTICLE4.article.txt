# Views differ on what's best for South Africa
## Divestment may backfire, warns African tribal leader 
### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
When the Stanford Board of Trus
tees recently voted to soil the Univer
sity's stock in Motorola Corp. under
certain conditions, most pro
divestment, anti-apartheid activists
on campus heralded the decision as a
positive step toward eliminating black
oppression in South Africa.
University President Donald Ken
nedy, a relative moderate on the
issue, declared that conditional
divestment was necessary as a last
resort because Motorola's past sales
to the South African military and
police "constitute substantial social
injury."
But a prominent black South
African leader maintains that
withdrawing vital U.S. capital from
the country — a potential corporate
response to the threat of mass stock
holder divestment — will result in
even more social injury. Statements
made by Zulu Chief Gatsha Buthelezi
in a Feb. 15 New York address to the
United States Council for Interna
tional Business create questions
about the divestment campaigns
raging at Stanford and on a handful of
other campuses across the country .
Buthelezi said disinvestment of
U.S. money would only compound
the economic distress suffered by
South African blacks.
"Millions already live in slum con
ditions." said Buthelezi, "and deeply
biting economic sanctions against
South Africa will condemn a great
many millions and a whole new gen
eration to continue living in appalling
slum conditions."
Buthelezi. chief of the six-million
member Zulu tribe, the largest in
South Africa, was quoted in The New

York Fimes as saying divestment
"would rob American businessmen of
the positive role they could play —
the only role, in tact, that Americans
can play."
These assertions raise an interest
ing question: Are Stanford activists,
in an effort to improve the plight of
blacks in South Africa, actually con
tributing to their duress?
"I certainly don't want to be doing
something that's against the purposes
I want to accomplish," said Jon
Adelstein, co-author of an October
ASSU referendum calling for divest
ment from Motorola and advocating
a more responsible investment policy.
Most supporters of the trustees'
Motorola decision point out that
there is an important distinction be
tween what they want — divestment
— and what Buthelezi fears — disin
vestment.
"1 have no interest in Motorola
getting out of South Africa." said Po
litical Science Prof. Richard Biudy.
chairman of the University's Com
mittee on Investment Responsibility
(C-IR). "I have an interest in stop
ping their sales to the (South African)
police."
Brody said there is a difference be
tween a Stanford decision to sell
stock and a corporation's decision to
disinvest from a country. He dis
counted the theory that divestment
encourages disinvestment because "if
you sell it (stock), someone else had
to buy it."
In January, the 12-member C-IR.
in response to the overwhelmingly
successful ASSU referendum, unani
mously recommended to the board
that Stanford sell its 124.000 shares

of Motorola, worth $4.7 million, if
the company resumes sales to the
South African military or police. A
Motorola spokesman maintains no
such sales have occurred since 1983.
Mark Landesmann, a member of
the C-1R and co-author of the refer
endum, said his goal — and the goal
of the ASSIJ referendum, the C-IR
recommendation and the board's
decision — is to improve Motorola's
behavior.
"We're not providing incentive (for
companies) to pull out; we're provid
ing incentives for Motorola to im
prove its behavior," Landesmann

said.
Landesmann agrees in part with
Buthelezi, saying, "I don't think a
pullout of all companies in South
Africa will lead to a positive situation
in South Africa."
But Landesmann said he supports
disinvestment if Motorola and other
corporations that are "unwilling to
abide by any ethical standards" per
sist in their pro-apartheid practices.
"It's much better for Motorola to
pull out of South Africa than to con
tinue its practices," he said with some
hesitation. "I see Motorola as playing
a negative role, and that's why they
should pull out."
Adelstein said he agrees "with the
fundamental assertion that pulling

out all American capital from South
Africa would have an adverse effect
on South Africa."
Both Landesmann and Adelstein
concede that Buthelezi presents a
compelling argument, but one they
have heard before. Landesmann said
he first encountered this line of
reasoning when he became active in
anti-apartheid measures more than a
year ago.
"The inherent fallacy in that argu
ment was essentially the starting
point in my activity on this issue," he
said.
Adelstein supports divestment of
worst-case companies, saying, "I
don't think this chieftain's arguments
hold up for companies like

Motorola."
Both students advocate the Uni
versity's case-by-case approach to
divestment, rejecting, as do Kennedy
and William Massy, vice president for
business and finance, blanket divest
ment of all companies doing business
in South Africa. Adelstein indicated
that this so-called divestment by for
mula "doesn't draw the necessary dis
tinction" and therefore its adherents
might be at odds with Buthelezi's
goals.
Members of the Black Student
Union (BSU) favor blanket divest
ment as a means of achieving total
disinvestment of U.S. capital in South
Africa, according to BSU President
Steve Phillips. Phillips admitted this

plan is contrary to what Buthelezi re
quested, but he called the Zulu chief
"a puppet of the South African
regime."
"This guy is purported to be
financed by the South African gov
ernment," Phillips said. He said the
white ruling minority has propped up
Buthelezi and others who supposedly
represent black concerns, but are ac
tually nothing more than mouth
pieces for the government.
"We want the corporations to
come out so we can hasten the advent
of majority rule," Phillips said.
Stanford political experts on South
African could not be reached to com
ment on Buthelezi's status in the
apartheid system.

made by Zulu Chief Gatsha Buthelezi
in a Feb. 15 New York address to the
United States Council for Interna
tional Business create questions
about the divestment campaigns
raging at Stanford and on a handful of
other campuses across the country .
Buthelezi said disinvestment of
U.S. money would only compound
the economic distress suffered by
South African blacks.
"Millions already live in slum con
ditions." said Buthelezi, "and deeply
biting economic sanctions against
South Africa will condemn a great
many millions and a whole new gen
eration to continue living in appalling
slum conditions."
Buthelezi. chief of the six-million
member Zulu tribe, the largest in
South Africa, was quoted in The New

York Fimes as saying divestment
"would rob American businessmen of
the positive role they could play —
the only role, in tact, that Americans
can play."
These assertions raise an interest
ing question: Are Stanford activists,
in an effort to improve the plight of
blacks in South Africa, actually con
tributing to their duress?
"I certainly don't want to be doing
something that's against the purposes
I want to accomplish," said Jon
Adelstein, co-author of an October
ASSU referendum calling for divest
ment from Motorola and advocating
a more responsible investment policy.
Most supporters of the trustees'
Motorola decision point out that
there is an important distinction be
tween what they want — divestment
— and what Buthelezi fears — disin
vestment.
"1 have no interest in Motorola
getting out of South Africa." said Po
litical Science Prof. Richard Biudy.
chairman of the University's Com
mittee on Investment Responsibility
(C-IR). "I have an interest in stop
ping their sales to the (South African)
police."
Brody said there is a difference be
tween a Stanford decision to sell
stock and a corporation's decision to
disinvest from a country. He dis
counted the theory that divestment
encourages disinvestment because "if
you sell it (stock), someone else had
to buy it."
In January, the 12-member C-IR.
in response to the overwhelmingly
successful ASSU referendum, unani
mously recommended to the board
that Stanford sell its 124.000 shares

of Motorola, worth $4.7 million, if
the company resumes sales to the
South African military or police. A
Motorola spokesman maintains no
such sales have occurred since 1983.
Mark Landesmann, a member of
the C-1R and co-author of the refer
endum, said his goal — and the goal
of the ASSIJ referendum, the C-IR
recommendation and the board's
decision — is to improve Motorola's
behavior.
"We're not providing incentive (for
companies) to pull out; we're provid
ing incentives for Motorola to im
prove its behavior," Landesmann

said.
Landesmann agrees in part with
Buthelezi, saying, "I don't think a
pullout of all companies in South
Africa will lead to a positive situation
in South Africa."
But Landesmann said he supports
disinvestment if Motorola and other
corporations that are "unwilling to
abide by any ethical standards" per
sist in their pro-apartheid practices.
"It's much better for Motorola to
pull out of South Africa than to con
tinue its practices," he said with some
hesitation. "I see Motorola as playing
a negative role, and that's why they
should pull out."
Adelstein said he agrees "with the
fundamental assertion that pulling

out all American capital from South
Africa would have an adverse effect
on South Africa."
Both Landesmann and Adelstein
concede that Buthelezi presents a
compelling argument, but one they
have heard before. Landesmann said
he first encountered this line of
reasoning when he became active in
anti-apartheid measures more than a
year ago.
"The inherent fallacy in that argu
ment was essentially the starting
point in my activity on this issue," he
said.
Adelstein supports divestment of
worst-case companies, saying, "I
don't think this chieftain's arguments
hold up for companies like

Motorola."
Both students advocate the Uni
versity's case-by-case approach to
divestment, rejecting, as do Kennedy
and William Massy, vice president for
business and finance, blanket divest
ment of all companies doing business
in South Africa. Adelstein indicated
that this so-called divestment by for
mula "doesn't draw the necessary dis
tinction" and therefore its adherents
might be at odds with Buthelezi's
goals.
Members of the Black Student
Union (BSU) favor blanket divest
ment as a means of achieving total
disinvestment of U.S. capital in South
Africa, according to BSU President
Steve Phillips. Phillips admitted this

plan is contrary to what Buthelezi re
quested, but he called the Zulu chief
"a puppet of the South African
regime."
"This guy is purported to be
financed by the South African gov
ernment," Phillips said. He said the
white ruling minority has propped up
Buthelezi and others who supposedly
represent black concerns, but are ac
tually nothing more than mouth
pieces for the government.
"We want the corporations to
come out so we can hasten the advent
of majority rule," Phillips said.
Stanford political experts on South
African could not be reached to com
ment on Buthelezi's status in the
apartheid system.
When the Stanford Board of Trus
tees recently voted to soil the Univer
sity's stock in Motorola Corp. under
certain conditions, most pro
divestment, anti-apartheid activists
on campus heralded the decision as a
positive step toward eliminating black
oppression in South Africa.
University President Donald Ken
nedy, a relative moderate on the
issue, declared that conditional
divestment was necessary as a last
resort because Motorola's past sales
to the South African military and
police "constitute substantial social
injury."
But a prominent black South
African leader maintains that
withdrawing vital U.S. capital from
the country — a potential corporate
response to the threat of mass stock
holder divestment — will result in
even more social injury. Statements
made by Zulu Chief Gatsha Buthelezi
