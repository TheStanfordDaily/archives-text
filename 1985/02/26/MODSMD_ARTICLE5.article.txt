# ASSU officials discuss future
## 
### BAIE NETZER Senior staff writer 
Reflecting on recent resignations,
petition drives and fee-assessment
battles, Senate Chair Eric Berg,
Council of Presidents member David
Porter and former Senator Derek
Passarelli debated the problems and
the future of the ASSU in a KZSU
program last night.
Passarelli, who resigned from the
senate last week, said the structure of
the ASSU has caused many prob
lems. "1 believe that it often gets
caught in bureaucratic politics," he
said. "The way it's designed, students
just don't have enough say."
Passarelli advocates eliminating the
senate and replacing it with a number
of smaller committees. "I think we
need to have smaller groups of people
working on more specific issues," he
said.
Porter said the ASSU sometimes
"gets mired in our own rules."
Recently the senate has spent more
time administering programs rather
than passing legislation, according to
Porter.
"The senate is so bogged down in
doing executive things it doesn't
have time to legislate," Porter said.
Berg said available information
makes it easy to focus on mistakes of
the senate rather than on mistakes by
other organizations.
Berg stressed the public-service ac
tivities of the senate this year in fur
thering weekend check-cashing
services to students and in working to
improve the services of the local post
office.
"I do think there are ways in which
we could have had better communi
cation between the senate, the senate
chair and the COP," Berg said.
After a disagreement over the
proper procedures for bringing issues
to the senate floor, COP members
began a petition drive to oust Berg
from the senate chairmanship. The
COP abandoned the drive four days
later, and Berg stated last night that
the senate has shown itself capable of
weathering a "major political crisis."

"In the long run, I think the senate
will be pretty good in putting the tur
moil of the. past few weeks behind
us," Berg said.
Passarelli said the disagreement
over the Band budget — the senate
voted to split the fee-assessment re
quest, the COP vetoed the vote, then
the senate overturned the veto — was
a product of the ASSU's structure
and was "just magnified because of
who was there."
Passerelli said committees carefully
scrutinize organizations' budgets

before allowing them to reach the
senate, but senators "nitpick on is
sues."
"Senators who are uninformed and
who have no idea what an organiza
tion does are supposed to vote on the
budgets," he said. "Then the senate,
for no apparent reason, shoots down
a budget.
"A lot of us should have more trust
in what our fellow senators are
doing," Passarelli said.
When questioned on the extent of
student involvement in the ASSU,
Berg said last year's election showed
a relatively low number of students,
especially undergraduates, running
tor the senate. Though not all of the
graduate senate positions were filled
in the spring. Berg said the graduate
senators elected in a special fall clec-
