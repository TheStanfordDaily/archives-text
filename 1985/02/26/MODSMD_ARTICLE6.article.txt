# Students differ on policy, but agree on trustee move

### KRISTEN CHRISTOPER Senior staff writer 
Although students have shown
widespread support for the Board of
Trustees decision to divest from
Motorola Corp. if it renews sales to
South African military or police, not
all agree that the University should
completely divest from all corpora
tions that do business in South Africa.
Steve Dauber, president of College
Republicans, said he would "strongly
object" to divestment if Motorola
resumed sales to the South African
military.
Dauber said he would not object if
the University divested from
Motorola if it was proved it was sel
ling military equipment. But he
would object if the University began
blanket divestment from all the com
panies involved in South Africa.
Dauber explained his position: "I
can't sec the University divesting of
all its IBM stock, for instance. I don't
believe that doing business in South
Africa is strongly immoral." Cur
rently, IBM conducts business in
South Africa.
Sophomore Eric Schwartz, also a
member of College Republicans, said
if Motorola is selling equipment to
the South African military "then the
University should divest." He added,
"People in the United States have not
really found out what the people in
South Africa feel about it."
Talking on a more general basis.
Schwartz said, "I don't think South
Africans would care if the University
divested, but if the United States did.
they would."
The sophomore continued. "I don't
think South Africa alone is going to
change; changes have to come from
within the country if things are going

to change."
In a recent book, "Why South
Africa Will Survive," Hoover Senior
Fellow and South African expert
Peter Duigan wrote, "South Africa
stands in need of a fully fledged
capitalistic transformation that will
slowly but deliberately dismantle the
vast machinery of state control that
prevents South Africans of all colors
from selling their goods, their land
and their labor to their own best ad
vantage. from moving where they
want to move, from dwelling where
they want to dwell."
In Duigan's book, which he co
authored with Hoover Senior Fellow
L.H. Gann. he describes the "new
Botha plan. ' The plan involves div id
ing the country into three main
"parliaments." the three divisions,
white, colored and Indians, would
each be in charge of its own people.
Duigan and Gann described the
idea more fully. "The country's af
fairs are to be run by a cabinet council
of seven whites, four colored and
three Asians under the chairmanship
of the executive state president.
"The president, who will be elected
by a multi-racial assembly of 50
whites, 25 colored, and 14 Asians,
would have the deciding vote in the
cabinet council."
The Board of Trustees, following a
recommendation from the Commis
sion on Investment Responsibility,
voted two weeks ago to sell the Uni
versity's stock in Motorola if the
Illinois-based electronics firm renews
sales to South African military or
poiice. According to a Motorola
spokesman, no such sales have been
made since 1983.
