Israel welcomes Egypt's call for talks
JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres expressed
"great interest" yesterday in a proposal by Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak for preliminary, U.S.-sponsored talks between Israel and a
joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation.
Speaking in an interview published yesterday by The New York
Times, Mubarak said such meetings could lay the groundwork for
broader Arab-Israeli peace negotiations.
"The piime minister read President Mubarak's proposals with great
interest," according to a statement released by Peres spokesman. "They
merit positive and precise examination."
Speaking in a television interview here last night, Peres said the pro
posal for a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation "is acceptable to us"
as long as "it does not include PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization)
representatives." The Israeli premier charged that "the PLO is still in
volved in terror. They cannot come (to negotiations) with both a
microphone and a pistol."
Peres also cautioned that "we have to hear the views of the Jordanians
and others" regarding the Mubarak proposals.
In an English-language news program widely viewed in Israel, Jordan
television reported last night only that portion of Mubarak's New York
Times interview in which the Egyptian leader praised the Feb. 11 agree
ment between King Hussein and PLO leader Yasser Arafat for joint ac
tion toward Middle East peace. It did not mention the call for U.S.-
sponsored talks.
Peres also confirmed yesterday that he had met in Bucharest last week
with Mohammed Abdullah, chairman of the Egyptian Parliament's
Foreign Relations,and Defense Committee, who acted as an envoy from
Mubarak. Israeli Radio suggested last night that Abdullah briefed Peres
on Mubarak's proposals at that time.
Poland expels U.S. diplomat
WARSAW, Poland — Polish authorities caught the U.S. military at
tache and his wife taking pictures of military installations and ordered
them out of the country for spying, the chief government spokesman said
yesterday.
Jerzy Urban said the Foreign Ministry declared Col. Frederick Myer
"persona non grata" and ordered him and his wife to leave within 48
hours,
"The Foreign Ministry has firmly protested against the activities (of
Myer), which constitute a serious abuse of diplomatic status," Ur
ban told a news conference in his office, to which Western correspon
dents were especially invited.
In Washington, State Department spokesman Bernard Kalb would
not say whether Myer had engaged in espionage. "We do not comment
on intelligence matters," he said. "I add to that there was absolutely no
justification for the actions taken by Polish officials against Myer and his
wife."
Kalb said the explusion represents "a most serious violation of the
Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations" to which the United States
and Poland are signatories.
Urban said security officers detained Myer and his -wife, Barbara, after
they were seen taking pictures from their car in a "prohibited military
zone" near the town of Przasnysz, 60 miles north of Warsaw, last
Thursday.
Diplomatic sources in Warsaw said the Myers had until tomorrow
afternoon to leave Poland.
Asked whether the incident will affect U.S.-Polish relations, Kalb
said, "Of course it will."
New Zealand leader visits U.S.
WELLINGTON, New Zealand — New Zealand Prime Minister
David Lange left yesterday on a trip to the United States and Europe to
explain his government's anti-nuclear policy which has led to tension
with Washington.
Lange, speaking to reporters before his departure, said he wanted to
"correct misunderstandings" which have resulted because of his govern
ment's policy in banning ships from entering its ports which are powered
by nuclear energy or have nuclear weapons on board.
The prime minister said his anti-nuclear stand was supported by the
majority of New Zealanders at the last election and in recent opinion
polls.
Lange will first hold talks in Los Angeles with U.S. government repre
sentatives. in London he will meet with Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher. In Geneva, Switzerland, he is scheduled to speak to the
United Nations Conference On Disarmament.
Gromyko arrives in Italy for talks
ROME — Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko arrived in Rome
yesterday for meetings with Italian officials and Pope John Paul II at the
outset of what diplomatic observers called a "traveling sales trip" to
oppose President Reagan's "Star Wars" strategic defense initiative.
The Soviet Politburo member's trip to Italy and, later this week, to
Spain, also appeared to be intended as a demonstration that there is no
immediate leadership crisis in the Kremlin, where the health of Presi
dent Konstantin Chernenko has appeared to be a major concern.
Gromyko declined to comment on his trip when he arrived in Rome
and seemed to be in no hurry to get down to business, scheduling only a
40-minute sightseeing visit with his wife to the ancient Roman port of
nearby Ostia during the afternoon and no official meetings in the even
ing.
A light plane circled slowly overhead as he arrived, bearing a banner
that proclaimed "Liberty for Sakharov," referring to the physicist and
Nobel Prize winner whose internal exile in the Soviet Union has sparked
a worldwide campaign for his freedom.
Gromyko's meeting with the pope, which was not announced by the
Vatican until the Soviet foreign minister arrived, will take place tomor
row and is expected to cover a broad range of issues, including the sub
ject of space weapons and restrictions against Roman Catholics in the
Soviet Union.
Papal contacts with the Kremlin, which became almost routine in the
late 1960s anil early 19705, have been limited in recent years. Gromyko
met John Paul II during his last visit to Rome six years ago and had met
five times with Pope Paul VI.
Although the pontiff has not taken a public position on Reagan's plan
for research into a space-based defense system, he is now studying the
report of the Vatican's Pontifical Academy of Sciences, which examined
the subject of the "weaponization of space" last month.
The academy's experts agreed that such a research program could
produce useful new technologies and is technically possible, according to
their chief, Brazilian biophysicist Carlos Chagas. But Chagas added that
in his opinion the Reagan program would have "a dubious value."
Large voter turnout in Pakistan
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — An opposition boycott of the parliamen
tary election called by martial-law ruler Gen. Mohammed Zia ul-Haq
appeared to have crumbled last night as large numbers of voters turned
out for the first national elective balloting since Zia seized power in a
military coup more than seven years ago.
Incomplete returns from Pakistan's four provinces indicated that Zia,
who extended his presidency five more years on the basis of a controver
sial referendum in December, would meet or exceed the 40 percent
voter turnout minimum lie set for himself in establishing a "new political
order" without rival parties vying for the 207-seat National Assembly.
Leaders of the 1 I-party opposition alliance, the Movement for the
Restoration of Democracy, had predicted a turnout of as low as 10 per
cent of Pakistan's 35 million registered voters because of their call to
boycott what the\ termed a "sham" election designed to perpetuate
Zia's military rule.
Unofficial returns from the most populous areas of the country
pointed to a victory for Zia in that voter participation was at least as
strong as it was in the 1970 and 1977 elections — the only other free
polls held since Pakistan was created 37 years ago with the partition of
the Indian Subcontinent. Turnouts in those elections averaged about 45
percent.

Gromyko arrives in Italy for talks
ROME — Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko arrived in Rome
yesterday for meetings with Italian officials and Pope John Paul II at the
outset of what diplomatic observers called a "traveling sales trip" to
oppose President Reagan's "Star Wars" strategic defense initiative.
The Soviet Politburo member's trip to Italy and, later this week, to
Spain, also appeared to be intended as a demonstration that there is no
immediate leadership crisis in the Kremlin, where the health of Presi
dent Konstantin Chernenko has appeared to be a major concern.
Gromyko declined to comment on his trip when he arrived in Rome
and seemed to be in no hurry to get down to business, scheduling only a
40-minute sightseeing visit with his wife to the ancient Roman port of
nearby Ostia during the afternoon and no official meetings in the even
ing.
A light plane circled slowly overhead as he arrived, bearing a banner
that proclaimed "Liberty for Sakharov," referring to the physicist and
Nobel Prize winner whose internal exile in the Soviet Union has sparked
a worldwide campaign for his freedom.
Gromyko's meeting with the pope, which was not announced by the
Vatican until the Soviet foreign minister arrived, will take place tomor
row and is expected to cover a broad range of issues, including the sub
ject of space weapons and restrictions against Roman Catholics in the
Soviet Union.
Papal contacts with the Kremlin, which became almost routine in the
late 1960s anil early 19705, have been limited in recent years. Gromyko
met John Paul II during his last visit to Rome six years ago and had met
five times with Pope Paul VI.
Although the pontiff has not taken a public position on Reagan's plan
for research into a space-based defense system, he is now studying the
report of the Vatican's Pontifical Academy of Sciences, which examined
the subject of the "weaponization of space" last month.
The academy's experts agreed that such a research program could
produce useful new technologies and is technically possible, according to
their chief, Brazilian biophysicist Carlos Chagas. But Chagas added that
in his opinion the Reagan program would have "a dubious value."
Large voter turnout in Pakistan
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — An opposition boycott of the parliamen
tary election called by martial-law ruler Gen. Mohammed Zia ul-Haq
appeared to have crumbled last night as large numbers of voters turned
out for the first national elective balloting since Zia seized power in a
military coup more than seven years ago.
Incomplete returns from Pakistan's four provinces indicated that Zia,
who extended his presidency five more years on the basis of a controver
sial referendum in December, would meet or exceed the 40 percent
voter turnout minimum lie set for himself in establishing a "new political
order" without rival parties vying for the 207-seat National Assembly.
Leaders of the 1 I-party opposition alliance, the Movement for the
Restoration of Democracy, had predicted a turnout of as low as 10 per
cent of Pakistan's 35 million registered voters because of their call to
boycott what the\ termed a "sham" election designed to perpetuate
Zia's military rule.
Unofficial returns from the most populous areas of the country
pointed to a victory for Zia in that voter participation was at least as
strong as it was in the 1970 and 1977 elections — the only other free
polls held since Pakistan was created 37 years ago with the partition of
the Indian Subcontinent. Turnouts in those elections averaged about 45
percent.
Israel welcomes Egypt's call for talks
JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres expressed
"great interest" yesterday in a proposal by Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak for preliminary, U.S.-sponsored talks between Israel and a
joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation.
Speaking in an interview published yesterday by The New York
Times, Mubarak said such meetings could lay the groundwork for
broader Arab-Israeli peace negotiations.
"The piime minister read President Mubarak's proposals with great
interest," according to a statement released by Peres spokesman. "They
merit positive and precise examination."
Speaking in a television interview here last night, Peres said the pro
posal for a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation "is acceptable to us"
as long as "it does not include PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization)
representatives." The Israeli premier charged that "the PLO is still in
volved in terror. They cannot come (to negotiations) with both a
microphone and a pistol."
Peres also cautioned that "we have to hear the views of the Jordanians
and others" regarding the Mubarak proposals.
In an English-language news program widely viewed in Israel, Jordan
television reported last night only that portion of Mubarak's New York
Times interview in which the Egyptian leader praised the Feb. 11 agree
ment between King Hussein and PLO leader Yasser Arafat for joint ac
tion toward Middle East peace. It did not mention the call for U.S.-
sponsored talks.
Peres also confirmed yesterday that he had met in Bucharest last week
with Mohammed Abdullah, chairman of the Egyptian Parliament's
Foreign Relations,and Defense Committee, who acted as an envoy from
Mubarak. Israeli Radio suggested last night that Abdullah briefed Peres
on Mubarak's proposals at that time.
Poland expels U.S. diplomat
WARSAW, Poland — Polish authorities caught the U.S. military at
tache and his wife taking pictures of military installations and ordered
them out of the country for spying, the chief government spokesman said
yesterday.
Jerzy Urban said the Foreign Ministry declared Col. Frederick Myer
"persona non grata" and ordered him and his wife to leave within 48
hours,
"The Foreign Ministry has firmly protested against the activities (of
Myer), which constitute a serious abuse of diplomatic status," Ur
ban told a news conference in his office, to which Western correspon
dents were especially invited.
In Washington, State Department spokesman Bernard Kalb would
not say whether Myer had engaged in espionage. "We do not comment
on intelligence matters," he said. "I add to that there was absolutely no
justification for the actions taken by Polish officials against Myer and his
wife."
Kalb said the explusion represents "a most serious violation of the
Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations" to which the United States
and Poland are signatories.
Urban said security officers detained Myer and his -wife, Barbara, after
they were seen taking pictures from their car in a "prohibited military
zone" near the town of Przasnysz, 60 miles north of Warsaw, last
Thursday.
Diplomatic sources in Warsaw said the Myers had until tomorrow
afternoon to leave Poland.
Asked whether the incident will affect U.S.-Polish relations, Kalb
said, "Of course it will."
New Zealand leader visits U.S.
WELLINGTON, New Zealand — New Zealand Prime Minister
David Lange left yesterday on a trip to the United States and Europe to
explain his government's anti-nuclear policy which has led to tension
with Washington.
Lange, speaking to reporters before his departure, said he wanted to
"correct misunderstandings" which have resulted because of his govern
ment's policy in banning ships from entering its ports which are powered
by nuclear energy or have nuclear weapons on board.
The prime minister said his anti-nuclear stand was supported by the
majority of New Zealanders at the last election and in recent opinion
polls.
Lange will first hold talks in Los Angeles with U.S. government repre
sentatives. in London he will meet with Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher. In Geneva, Switzerland, he is scheduled to speak to the
