# Reagan meets with governors

WASHINGTON â€” President
Reagan asked the nation's governors
yesterday to help him reduce huge
federal budget deficits, but he
spurned their requests that he con
sider trimming Pentagon spending
and Social Security and increasing
taxes.
The governors also disputed
Reagan's implication that the states
are running budget surpluses that will
allow them to take over many federal
programs the president wants to cut.
"It's clear from the president this
morning that Social Security, the
defense budget (and) revenue (are)
all off the table," said Kansas Gov\
John Carlin, chairman of the National
Governors' Association. "So, at least
to this point, we haven't made that
much progress."

Carlin. a Democrat, spoke follow
ing a half-hour White House session
between Reagan and his top aides
and the governors, who are holding
their winter meeting in Washington.
Reagan, himself a former governor
of California, opened the meeting
saying he welcomed the advice of the
nation's governors. 34 of whom are
Democrats. And he defended his
proposals for about $50 billion in
spending reductions next year, many
of which would cut back or eliminate
fedeial aid programs and subsidies
that state and local governments have
long cherished.
"I hope you can understand that
these tough calls have to he made
now at the federal level." Reagan
said.
"These proposals are rooted both

in economic necessity and common
sense," he said. "There's simply no
justification, for example, for the
federal government, which is running
a deficit, to be borrowing money to
be spent by state and local govern
ments. some of which are now run
ning surpluses."
Following Reagan's remarks,
reporters were ushered out of the
White House East Room, where the
president and governors had a
question-and-answer session.
Afterward. Wisconsin Gov. An
thony Earl, a Democrat, said Reagan
was "asked very directly" by New
York Gov. Mario Cuomo, another
Democrat, "what value it was for the
governors to try to persuade the
Congress and others to take hard
steps when he.the president, refused

to budge."
"The president simply repeated
that he thought it could all be done
without addressing any of those
major topics," such as defense spend
ing. tax increases and the govern
ment's benefit programs for individ
uals such as Social Security. Earl
added.
Republican Gov. Lamar Alexander
of Tennessee, vice chairman of the
governors' group, said. "1 respectfully
asked him (Reagan) not to talk about
the surpluses that we (states) had be
cause while he clearly understands
what they are, a lot of other people
don't."
"Surpluses are not pots of money
to spend," Alexander said, "they are
fund balances that we have so that we
chin't unbalance our budget."
