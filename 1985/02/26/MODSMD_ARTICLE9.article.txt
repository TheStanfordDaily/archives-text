# Administration eyes contra aid

### 
WASHINGTON — The Reagan administration
is considering a controversial new plan to fund the
rebels fighting Nicaragua's leftist regime by divert
ing money originally intended as economic aid for
Central America, officials said yesterday.
President Reagan and Secretary of State George
Shultz still hope to persuade Congress to approve
$14 million in covert funding to be provided to the
rebels, known as contras, by the CIA, the officials
said. But because congressional leaders have said
the covert aid is unlikely to pass, several alternative
funding plans are being worked out, including the
diversion of economic aid.
Under one version of the idea, officials said, U.S.
money would flow to Honduras as economic aid
with a "gentleman's agreement" obliging the Hon
durans to turn some of the money over to the con
tras. The administration already has $147 million
in economic aid that Congress has appropriated for
Honduras, but it has never been spent because of a
series of disputes with the Honduran government.
However, both administration aides and mem
bers of Congress have already raised objections to
the plan. Using economic development aid to fund
the rebels "could simply be illegal," even if it is
used solely for non-military aid to the contras, said
an official who asked not to be identified.
House Democrats have already said they will

fight aid to the contras in any form. And the in
fluential Republican chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, Sen. Richard Lugar
of Indiana, said last week he was concerned that
the United States could "lose control" of the rebels
if their funding were routed through another gov
ernment like Honduras.
Shultz outlined the idea to the Senate Intelli
gence Committee last week and got a mixed recep
tion, congressional sources said. Shultz said he
would prefer that such an arrangement remain offi
cially covert, but some Republicans said they would
insist on overt funding and some Democrats said
they wanted no funding at all.
The economic aid idea "is one of four or five op
tions that we are discussing," a senior State De
partment official said. Others reportedly include
withdrawing U.S. diplomatic recognition from the
Managua regime and extending open military aid
to the contras, as well as providing "humanitarian"
aid to the estimated 30,000 dependents of contra
guerrillas while encouraging other countries anil
private organizations to extend military aid.
The official said the administration has not yet
settled on any single option, "because as soon as we
do that you'll see constituencies form up against
it." Instead, he said, the renewal of CIA funding
will be pursued first and an alternative plan

adopted only if the covert scheme fails.
' We'll go with whatever we can find a majority
in Congress to approve." he said.
Contra officials have said they are already re
ceiving modest amounts of help from the govern
ments of Honduras, El Salvador and Israel, all of
which are heavily dependent on U.S. aid. But they
say much of that help has been intended only as a
stopgap until the Reagan administration can win
new funding from Congress.
White House spokesman Larry Speakes said a
vote on the covert $14 million could come
sometime in April. Meanwhile, he said, the admin
istration will continue its campaign to change the
terms of the public debate on Nicaragua, possibly
including more speeches on the subject by Reagan.
"We will be. in the coming weeks, presenting our
case to the Congress, presenting our case to the
people," Speakes said. "We are hopeful that once
the public realizes the seriousness of the situation,
that there will be support both in the country and in
Congress.
"Basically, it is not something that the public is
devoting a kit of attention to at the moment,"
Speakes said. "However, once . . . the public does
understand the seriousness of the situation and the
fact that we do face a Marxist-type government in
Central America, then they do support our ap
proach to it.'
