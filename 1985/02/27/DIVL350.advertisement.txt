We are Residential, the core division which spawned a giant — Honeywell Inc., a
multinational Fortune 100 corporation. For a century,, we've distinguished ourselves
as a world class leader in the design, production and sale of devices which control
energy.
Our cohtinued growth objectives are highly aggressive, but achievable through
integration of microelectronic technologies into our energy management systems.
For example, we are strategically positioned to capture the rapidly expanding
markets in intelligent small building controls, by not only providing for comfort and
safety in their use of energy, but new efficiencies and conservation as well.
Internally, our applications of advanced technologies are equally exciting, as we
outfit our factories with state-of-the-art computer integrated manufacturing (CIM)
systems. CIM will allow us to be even more flexible and responsive to the changing
needs of our customers.
Select, high-talent employees have always been key to Residential's success. Our
representatives will be on your campus March 7 to interview MBA candidates who
have an Operations interest. Check with your placement office and/or send your
resume in advance to: Bettye J. Wilson, Manager, Staffing, HONEYWELL
RESIDENTIAL, 1985 Douglas Drive North, Golden Valley,
MN 55422.
PS. Learn about our MBA opportunities in the February 27 edition.
Together, we can find the answers. I
