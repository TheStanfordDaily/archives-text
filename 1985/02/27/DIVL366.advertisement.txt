USING A MACINTOSH?
YOU'LL LOVE THE
STANFORD FLYING CLUB!
Nothing more logical than that; there is brilliancy and simplicity in the wonders
of a computer. Just look at your Macintosh..
But sometimes it's time to break away from that computer screen! Take a
breather! And find out how simple it is to Learn to Fly with the ingenious Stan
ford Flying Club integrated flight training program and user-friendly aircraft.
Most students obtain their Solo Licenses through the Stanford Flying Club with
only 9 to 18 hours of flight time. Many pilots have soloed for less than $572.
So join the Stanford Flying Club. Learn to fly. To schedule a lesson, or for
more information, call Leslie today: 851-2400 (1:00-5:30), and decide for your
self. You'll find out in a hurry why Macintosh users love the Stanford Flying Club.
