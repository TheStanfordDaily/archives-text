# Farm aid stalled

WASHINGTON — Senate Re
publican leaders, facing mounting
difficulties on two crucial fronts,
yesterday resorted to delaying tac
tics to fend off possible defeat on
farm-credit legislation and ac
knowledged that their deficit
reduction effort is in serious trou
ble.
With Democrats and dissident
farm-state Republicans within
striking distance of passing farm
credit legislation opposed by the
Reagan administration, Majority
Leader Robert Dole (R-Kan.) put
off a vote on the issue and hinted
at further delaying tactics if it ap
pears the measure will pass.
Less than a week ago, it was
Dole who fretted at the farm-state
coalition for holding up confirma
tion of Edwin Meese as attorney
general to force action on farm
legislation. Dole had been con
fidant of his votes for Meese, who
was confirmed by a 2-to-l
majority Saturday. He acknowl
edged yesterday that he was not
sure he had the votes to
pigeonhole the farm legislation.
The farm bill at issue yesterday
would go considerably beyond
steps taken by the administration
last week by further easing credit
terms, providing $100 million for
federally subsidized interest pay
ments and increasing funds
available for loan guarantees by
$1.8 billion.
A controversial provision that
could result in government as

sumption of bad loans, with the
banks bearing little or no share of
the cost, was expected to be
shelved, increasing prospects for
Republican support of the mea
sure.
Dole was pressing hard to dis
suade Republicans from support
ing the measure, and the delay ap
peared aimed at giving the admin
istration time to step up its lobby
ing against it.
Agriculture Secretary John
Block said yesterday in a letter to
Minority Leader Robert Byrd (D-
W.Va.) that he would recommend
a veto if the legislation is ap
proved.
One problem is that the Senate
farm legislation is tied to a bill
providing famine relief for starv
ing Africans, which Republicans
would not like to see President
Reagan veto.
Pulling Republicans in the op
posite direction were hundreds of
farmers and farm-state public offi
cials, including nearly the entire
South Dakota state legislature,
who milled around the Capitol
lobbying for the relief.
Concerning the budget, Pete
Domenici (R-N.M.), Senate
budget committee chariman, ac
knowledged after a Republican
discussion of deficit-reduction
prospects that "the chances of get
ting anything are not very
good. . . . We've got a long way to
go on the whole thing."
