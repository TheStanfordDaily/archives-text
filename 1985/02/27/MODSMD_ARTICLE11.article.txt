Survey cites hunger
BOSTON — Despite the economic recovery,
millions of Americans regularly don't get enough
to eat, and cuts in social programs have left more
people hungry than at any time since the 19305,
according to a study released yesterday.
"Hunger is a problem of epidemic proportions
across the nation," said the report by the
Physician Task Force on Hunger in America.
"While no one knows the precise number of
hungry Americans, available evidence indicates
that up to 20 million citizens may be hungry at
least some period of time ea.h month."
J. Larry Brown, task force chairman and pro
fessor at the Harvard School of Public Health,
told a news conference the figure was "a conser
vative estimate," based on federal statistics
documenting poverty and access to food stamps.
He estimated that it would cost up to $7 billion
a year to eliminate hunger by restoring federal
funding for welfare, food stamps, school lunches
and programs that feed infants, the elderly and
pregnant women.
The 147-page study, titled "Hunger in
America: The Growing Epidemic," was the
result of a year-long investigation by the
Physician Task Force, whose 22 members include
some of the most prominent names in American
medicine.
They reasoned that the 15.5 million Americans

who live below the official poverty line —
$ 10,178 for a family of four — and do not receive
food stamps are unable to secure an adequate
diet at least part of every month.
To that number they added subgroups of
Americans living near the poverty line without
food assistance for a grand total of 22.85 million,
which they rounded to 20 million.
That result was in line with a Harris Survey
done in January 1984 that estimated there were
nearly 21 million hungry Americans.
Mob arrests made
NEW YORK — The five reputed leaders of
the city's Mafia families were rounded up over
night and charged yesterday in a federal indict
ment with being the "ruling body" of a criminal
enterprise that deals in murder, labor racketeer
ing and extortion.
Officials predicted the federal indictment
would encourage crime victims to cooperate with
police and would touch off a violent struggle
within the families.
"This is a bad day, probably the worst ever, for
the Mafia," said U.S. Attorney Rudolph
Giuliani. Never before, he said, had a federal in
dictment charged so many bosses.

Mengele linked to drugs
WASHINGTON — Nazi war criminal Josef
Mengele was involved in drug trafficking while
he moved among South American countries
during the 19705, according to declassified CIA
documents released yesterday by two senators.
The documents were heavily censored and
were unsubstantiated, but they painted an in
triguing picture of the purported movements of
the most wanted World War II criminal still at
large.
Included among the documents was a report
that in 1973, "Israel terrorists" beat to death a
former German soldier in Paraguay in the mis
taken belief he was Mengele. The man's wife
"lost portions of one of her ears and her stomach
was cut open" in the attack, the documents said.
Market advances
NEW YORK — The stock market staged a
broad advance in active trading yesterday, helped
by new signs of economic strength, a slide in
open-market interest rates and an interruption of
the dollar's historic rally.
Nearly two stocks rose in price for every one
that fell on the New York Stock Exchange.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up
1.66 points Monday, gained another 8.61 points
to finish at 1,286.11.
