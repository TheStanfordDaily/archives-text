SACRAMENTO — Black legislators yester
day renewed their efforts to impose economic
penalties on South Africa because of the racist
policies followed by the country's white govern
ment.
But one of the bills in a legislative package
backed by the Legislature's Black Caucus would
go beyond South Africa and attempt to penalize
"any nation with a totalitarian form of govern
ment."
That measure, SB9 by Sens. Bill Greene and
Diane Watson, both Los Angeles Democrats,
would impose a five-year ban on the investment
of state or local government retirement funds in
any corporation that does business with South
Africa or another totalitarian regime.
Despite repeated questioning, Watson refused
to specify which nations might be affected by the
bill. And she denied that the bill would leave the
retirement funds with few places to invest.
Other measures in the package would:
• ban investment of state funds in the stock of
American companies that do business in South
Africa.

• protest the sale of South African Krugcrrand
coins in the United States.
• call for the release of black leader Nelson Man
dela from a South African prison.
• call for federal legislation to prevent federal
agencies from doing anything that would increase
the ability of the South African government to
deveJop an atomic bomb.
• bar privately owned public utilities from invest
ing retirement funds in financial institutions that
have loaned money to the South African govern
ment.
• ban California utilities from providing any nu
clear energy technology to the South Africans or
any company doing business in the country.
• urge the University of California to avoid sci
entific or cultural exchanges with South Africa.
• urge the federal government to prevent South
African athletes from entering the U.S.
• call for free elections in South Africa.
Reps, act on Liu killing
SAN FRANCISCO — A California congress
man, reacting to published reports that

Taiwanese government officials helped plot the
slaying of journalist Henry Liu, has called for a
federal grand jury probe of the murder.
"Certainly there should be a federal grand jury
in San Francisco," said Rep. Don Edwards (D-
San Jose), chairman of the House civil and con
stitutional rights subcommittee. "There should
be indictments here in the U.S. regardless of the
position of the alleged co-conspirators."
Edwards' comments came in the wake of a San
Francisco Examiner story that said unnamed
U.S. officials confirmed an admission by alleged
Bamboo Gang leader Chen Chi-li that he
repeatedly discussed plans to kill Liu with Vice
Admiral Wang Hsi-ling.
At the time, Wang was head of the Intelligence
Bureau of the Taiwan Ministry of Defense. The
Taiwanese government placed Wang and two of
his deputies under military arrest last month for
possible involvement in the Oct. 15 killing of Liu.
Today's weather
C ontinued warm, but with some early morning
fog. Highs in the 70s, lows in the 40s.
