## Scientists seek ways to lessen quake damage 
### KELSEY DENTON 
Earthquakes are nothing new to
Stanford. Situated close to the San
Andreas fault and near several
smaller ones, the University has ex
perienced numerous earthquakes and
sustained much damage throughout
its history. Many would consider this
reason enough to focus research here
on finding new ways to lessen the
destructiveness of seismic occur
rences in the Bay Area.
But researchers at Stanford's John
A. Blume Earthquake Engineering
Center are concerned with
earthquakes worldwide, not just at
Stanford.
Faculty members and graduate stu
dents from many departments con
duct research at the center — named
for structural engineer and benefac
tor John Blume — identifying regions
of the world where the seismic hazard
is high and developing ways to reduce
the damage caused by earthquakes.
"Research at the center involves
the systematic analysis of all aspects
of earthquakes and their ramifica
tions," said Civil Engineering Prof.
Haresh Shah, one of the center's
directors and a leading authority in
earthquake engineering. "We exam
ine all aspects of the seismic hazard
— the likelihood of an earthquake's
occurrence, the type of magnitude
that can be expected, and the
probable effects of such an event on
society and its infrastructure — in or
der to enable us to come up with con
crete ways to lessen the detrimental
effects of seismic occurrences."
Risk analyses begin with a deter
mination of the seismicity, or seismic
activity, of a given region. One way of
accomplishing this, Shah said, is to
examine historical records of the fre
quency and severity of earthquakes in
the area. From such data, the proba
bility of a seismic event of given
specifications occurring in a given
time period can be statistically deter
mined.
These data, however, do not exist
in sufficient quantity for many
earthquake-prone areas of the world;
seismic records for California, for ex
ample, exist for only the last 200

years, according to a recently pub
lished book, "Terra Non Firma," by
Shah and Civil Engineering Prof.
James Gere. A geological approach
must be employed in such areas.
A systematic look at the geological
composition of a given region yields
information vital to the determina
tion of seismic risk. Researchers em
ploy various methods of analyzing the
stress on active faults so that the
probability of movement along the
fault can be determined.
Because earthquakes leave distinc
tive changes in the earth near the
fault line along which they occur, the
historical frequency of earthquakes
can be determined by excavating
trenches along the fault and noting
the number of times that anomalies in
the earth associated with earthquakes
are encountered, Gere and Shah ex
plain.
This technique gives an accurate
account of the number of
earthquakes that have occurred in the
recent geologic past. Shah and Gere
noted work by geologist Kerry Sieh,
who, while a graduate student at
Stanford, performed such a study on
the San Andreas Fault near Los An
geles. He determined that eight large
earthquakes had occurred in the past
1,200 years — an average of one
every 140 years.
If a study of the seismic history of
an area shows a strong tendency for
the frequent occurrence of
earthquakes, it is necessary to predict
when the next earthquake may occur.
Although there are many ways of
making these predictions, it is not yet
possible to determine precisely when
and where the next earthquake will
occur, Shah and Gere said.
Researchers determine the proba
bility of an earthquake's occurrence
in a given time frame based on the
historical time period between
earthquakes. An area that has gone
longer than expected without experi
encing an earthquake is described as
having a "seismic gap." Population
centers that lie in regions of seismic
gaps have the highest potential for
suffering damage as a result of a seis
mic occurrence, so earthquake en

gineers give high priority to damage
containing measures in such areas,
according to Shah and Gere.
Researchers at the Blume Center
contribute significantly to the dis
covery and analysis of regions of the
world where the seismic risk is high.
In recent years, the center has
produced comprehensive seismic risk
analyses for many countries, includ
ing Algeria, Costa Rica, Guatemala
and Nicaragua.
The identification of areas that
possess a high seismic risk pays consi
derable dividends. The Oaxaca
region of Mexico had been identified
as overdue for an earthquake for a
relatively short period of time when a
large earthquake struck in 1978.
Damage-control measures instituted
by the Mexican government lessened
the damage caused by it and saved a
number of lives.
Engineers at the center assist in the
lessening of earthquake damage by
helping communities in high-risk
areas design appropriate programs of
action. "Most community land-use
and zoning laws in earthquake-prone
areas fail to take all of the appropri
ate steps necessary to minimize the
risk of earthquake damage," said
Shah.
After looking at all the specific
hazards to a community posed by
earthquakes, analysts at the center
make specific recommendations for
revisions in planning and zoning laws,
building codes and other community
laws that might have a direct effect on
lessening earthquake damage.
The bulk of the center's research is
devoted to the actual design of
earthquake-resistant structures. En
gineers consider all of the potential
stresses on a structure posed by large
earthquakes in order to create the
strongest, most feasible design.
They build scale models of
structures whose constituent compo
nents carry the same proportional
loads as their real counterparts would
and use specially constructed lab
equipment to subject the models to
the same stresses that the actual
structure would encounter in a real
earthquake.

The data collected from such ex
periments help engineers construct
the most durable structure possible,
according to Gere and Shah.
Earthquakes also cause ground dis
tortions such as landslides and
liquefaction of soils that cause the
earth to no longer support adequately
buildings. "No matter how well a
structure has been designed and con
structed," said Shah, "there is little
chance that it will withstand an
earthquake if the ground fails
beneath it and it loses its support."
If structures must be located in
areas where the risk of ground failure
is high, countermeasures can be
taken. Builders drain ground water,
drill wells that allow ground water
escape to the surface in the event of a
sudden pressure rise caused by an
earthquake, treat soils with chemicals
to increase their viscosity in the event

of liquefaction and build foundations
on bedrock piles to combat the risk of
liquefaction.
Pile foundations also serve to give
support in the event of a landslide.
These precautions, Shah said, repre
sent considerable capital outlays and
generally are not employed unless the
structure needs a very high degree of
stability.
Engineers at the center use their
analysis of the specific risks to
structures in a given location to deter
mine the appropriate amount of
precautions. "It is theoretically possi
ble to build a structure in a suitable
location that is capable of withstand
ing the strongest earthquakes im
aginable, but economic considera
tions make this impossible," accord
ing to Shah.
The purpose of the structure is
taken into account when its seismic

resistance is being determined in
design. Some structures, such as dams
and nuclear power plants, would
themselves pose significant secondary
hazards if they failed and need to be
made as resistant as possible, even at
tremendous cost.
Structures that are vital to a com
munity should also be designed to
withstand strong earthquakes so that
they can be used to provide necessary
emergency services, Shah and Gere
said.
Other buildings must be resistant
enough to prevent them from collaps
ing on their occupants during an
earthquake. Structures are also made
earthquake-resistant in proportion to
their capital cost in order to reduce
insurance costs and prevent the ex
penditure of a comparable sum of
money to build a replacement, Shah
and Gere said.
