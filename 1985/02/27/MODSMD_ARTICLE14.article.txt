"Please don't put your name on your blue
book."
When a professor first gives this instruction it
sounds like a crazy experiment, but what the pro
fessor is doing actually makes a lot of sense.
Several professors now ask students to put
numbers instead of names on their test books.
The numbers are on master sheets which students
sign as an acknowledgment of the honor code.
The sheets of names are not matched with corres
ponding blue books until after the tests are
graded. This simple measure serves well to make
grading of tests more objective than it is now.
Although discrimination in grading of exams is
not necessarily a large problem at Stanford,
enough subjectivity in grading exists to make it a
potential problem. Some teaching assistants or
professors may have a bias toward a student who
makes a certain argument. They may, for in
stance, bolster the scoring of an exam if they
know it was written by a student they like, per
haps an individual they know outside of class.

Graders sometimes say they had to guess what
a person meant on a certain answer, and they of
ten use outside criteria to make that guess. Using
numbers eliminates this bias and makes graders
judge on what is contained in an exam rather
than guessing what a certain student means,
based on extrinsic factors.
This does not mean professors should not use
in-class participation as a criterion in grading, but
rather that the grader's knowledge of and feelings
about individual students should not affect the
scoring of exams. Depersonalizing the process
also makes graders and students less vulnerable
to claims of unfair treatment. Graders in the
number system need not fear accusations that
they are grading on outside factors. Students who
befriend their professors or TAs are less subject
to criticism of "brown-nosing" if their tests
remain anonymous.
Numbering exams may not be the best method
for all classes. The professors should be the ones
to decide, but we encourage them to give it a try.
