# Any racial or religious group can be an oppressor
## 
### 
Two issues have dominated this page
recently — apartheid in South Africa and
Palestinians in Israel. Though these situations
differ in many important ways, both revolve
around the same problem: the failure to rec
ognize that no racial or religious group is any
more human than any other.
South Africa is easier to talk about, because
it doesn't carry the emotional significance that
Isfael does for many people. Almost everyone
agrees that apartheid is wrong. The question
is, what to do about it?
Divestiture — either by the University as a
symbolic gesture, or by all U.S. companies as
a serious economic sanction — is one answer.
This approach has been questioned — most
important, by the people who guide
Stanford's investment policies. "It's difficult
to say that pulling out would improve the sit
uation," Margaret Miller, of the Commission
on Investment Responsibility, said. "It
might make it worse: The black leaders do not
want a pullout."
The main justification for continued invest
ment in South Africa is that it provides jobs
for the blacks, so divestiture would hurt them
more than help them. A similar argument
would have advocated buying cotton from the
Confederacy, so as to avoid putting slaves out
of work. Both arguments are equally self
serving.
American companies are not in South
Africa out of humanitarianism. They are
there because of cheap black labor, which
provides phenomenal profit rates — two or
three times what one could get in the United
States or Europe. These profit rates are de

pendent on the ability of apartheid to keep
the workers unorganized, ignorant and ex
ploitable. South African racism and U.S. capi
tal actually are in a symbiotic relationship, as
apartheid brings in investment and the invest
ment keeps the economy stable enough for in
vestment to continue.
As for the "black leaders" opposed to
divestiture, these are largely people who have

chosen to live with apartheid, who are widely
regarded as quislings. As an example, one
anti-divestiture figure, the mayor of Soweto,
was "chosen" in elections with less than 4
percent of the eligible voters participating —
hardly a manifestation of the voice of the
people.
The real black leaders aren't allowed to tell
us their feelings about the subject. Calling for
divestiture is a crime in South Africa.
The alternatives to divestiture are not
pleasant. Keep in mind that South Africa is a
police state, where the press is censored and
individuals are subject to arbitrary arrest for

their beliefs. Appeals to morality and sweet
reason are unlikely to be effective in such a
situation. If apartheid — a system upon which
the whole economy of South Africa is based
— is to be changed, force must be used. One
can only hope that economic force will work
before military force is necessary.
But aren't efforts by privileged American
students to change the political system in
South Africa just liberal hypocrisy? Perhaps
they would be, if Stanford students didn't di
rectly benefit from the high profit rates result
ing from the exploitation of the South African
people. Our position is not that of superior
outsiders pointing out the sins of others — we
are participants in an immoral system and we
have to stop receiving the rewards of it if we
want to act like members of the human fam
ily.
The problem of South Africa is the same
problem we find, in a somewhat less virulent
form, in Israel. There it is not blacks, but the
Palestinians who lived and are living on
Israeli-controlled land, who are not treated as
real human beings.
It is not a question of who uses violence
against whom — yes, the PLO has committed
terrible crimes, and so have Israelis, through
their government and as individual terrorists.
Each retaliation leads to another, in the cycle
of an eye for an eye for an eye. One must go
beyond the violent acts of both sides to the
sources of the conflict.
Nor is it a question of who has "historic
rights" to the land. People argue, as though it
mattered, about whether the Palestinians
were evicted from lands they had worked for

thousands of years, or merely for six genera
tions. It really doesn't matter, nor does it mat
ter what the Bible or the Koran says, or who
inhabited the territories in the first century.
The conflict is between the living, not the
dead.
The central source of the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict is this: that Israel is an officially
Jewish state, and a Jewish state occupying ter
ritory inhabited by non-Jews is bound to be
oppressive.
That it is Jewish is incidental. One could
substitute Islamic, or Catholic, or White or
Anglo-Saxon or Great Russian. Any state
which denies the equality of some of its
people is by definition undemocratic.
"There is no Israeli nation apart from the
Jewish people," the High Court of Israel has
ruled. This leaves the Arabs who constitute
15 percent of Israel's citizens rather left out.
This does not include refugees and those
living in the occupied territories— if these are
counted, only half the inhabitants of the
Jewish state are actually Jews.
This discrimination exhibits itself con
cretely and brutally. Ninety-two percent of
the land in Israel is controlled by the Jewish
National Fund, an institution with official
policies of discrimination against non-Jews.
Most Arabs are denied citizenship and are
subjected to gross violations of civil rights, in
cluding land seizures, arbitrary arrests,
beatings and worse. In many areas Arabs are
officially segregated, and even intermarriage
between the two groups is forbidden by law.
These abuses flow inevitably from the un
consciously racist idea that the Jewish people

can be at home only in a Jewish state.
Some, like one right-wing (some would say
fascist) Knesset member, take this to its logi
cal conclusion, and call for the expulsion of
"Arab dogs" from "Greater Israel." Most Is
raelis, however, reject this proposal, out of
either decency or a recognition of the need
that Israel has for Arab labor.
The status quo, however, is worse. To keep
the Arabs as a permanent underclass, either
under direct Israeli rule or in some sort of
puppet homeland, is to destroy the spirit of Is
rael. To become an oppressor kills the soul of
a people.
The Jewish people have been persecuted
for centuries and suffered a tragedy in the
Holocaust beyond all understanding. But
surely, the peasants of Palestine should not be
blamed for this. The solution to the
master/slave problem is not to turn oneself
into a master, but to transcend the institution
of slavery. The Jews must not let themselves
become like the people who oppressed them,
and the only way to avoid that is to let the
refugees return to their homes and to share
the land of Israel/Palestine with them as fel
low citizens.
The day this will happen is a long way off.
But the first step in achieving it is for support
ers of Israel to recognize the moral impos
sibility of setting up a Jewish state in a half-
Arab nation.

conflict is this: that Israel is an officially
Jewish state, and a Jewish state occupying ter
ritory inhabited by non-Jews is bound to be
oppressive.
That it is Jewish is incidental. One could
substitute Islamic, or Catholic, or White or
Anglo-Saxon or Great Russian. Any state
which denies the equality of some of its
people is by definition undemocratic.
"There is no Israeli nation apart from the
Jewish people," the High Court of Israel has
ruled. This leaves the Arabs who constitute
15 percent of Israel's citizens rather left out.
This does not include refugees and those
living in the occupied territories— if these are
counted, only half the inhabitants of the
Jewish state are actually Jews.
This discrimination exhibits itself con
cretely and brutally. Ninety-two percent of
the land in Israel is controlled by the Jewish
National Fund, an institution with official
policies of discrimination against non-Jews.
Most Arabs are denied citizenship and are
subjected to gross violations of civil rights, in
cluding land seizures, arbitrary arrests,
beatings and worse. In many areas Arabs are
officially segregated, and even intermarriage
between the two groups is forbidden by law.
These abuses flow inevitably from the un
consciously racist idea that the Jewish people

can be at home only in a Jewish state.
Some, like one right-wing (some would say
fascist) Knesset member, take this to its logi
cal conclusion, and call for the expulsion of
"Arab dogs" from "Greater Israel." Most Is
raelis, however, reject this proposal, out of
either decency or a recognition of the need
that Israel has for Arab labor.
The status quo, however, is worse. To keep
the Arabs as a permanent underclass, either
under direct Israeli rule or in some sort of
puppet homeland, is to destroy the spirit of Is
rael. To become an oppressor kills the soul of
a people.
The Jewish people have been persecuted
for centuries and suffered a tragedy in the
Holocaust beyond all understanding. But
surely, the peasants of Palestine should not be
blamed for this. The solution to the
master/slave problem is not to turn oneself
into a master, but to transcend the institution
of slavery. The Jews must not let themselves
become like the people who oppressed them,
and the only way to avoid that is to let the
refugees return to their homes and to share
the land of Israel/Palestine with them as fel
low citizens.
The day this will happen is a long way off.
But the first step in achieving it is for support
ers of Israel to recognize the moral impos
sibility of setting up a Jewish state in a half-
Arab nation.

Two issues have dominated this page
recently — apartheid in South Africa and
Palestinians in Israel. Though these situations
differ in many important ways, both revolve
around the same problem: the failure to rec
ognize that no racial or religious group is any
more human than any other.
South Africa is easier to talk about, because
it doesn't carry the emotional significance that
Isfael does for many people. Almost everyone
agrees that apartheid is wrong. The question
is, what to do about it?
Divestiture — either by the University as a
symbolic gesture, or by all U.S. companies as
a serious economic sanction — is one answer.
This approach has been questioned — most
important, by the people who guide
Stanford's investment policies. "It's difficult
to say that pulling out would improve the sit
uation," Margaret Miller, of the Commission
on Investment Responsibility, said. "It
might make it worse: The black leaders do not
want a pullout."
The main justification for continued invest
ment in South Africa is that it provides jobs
for the blacks, so divestiture would hurt them
more than help them. A similar argument
would have advocated buying cotton from the
Confederacy, so as to avoid putting slaves out
of work. Both arguments are equally self
serving.
American companies are not in South
Africa out of humanitarianism. They are
there because of cheap black labor, which
provides phenomenal profit rates — two or
three times what one could get in the United
States or Europe. These profit rates are de

pendent on the ability of apartheid to keep
the workers unorganized, ignorant and ex
ploitable. South African racism and U.S. capi
tal actually are in a symbiotic relationship, as
apartheid brings in investment and the invest
ment keeps the economy stable enough for in
vestment to continue.
As for the "black leaders" opposed to
divestiture, these are largely people who have

chosen to live with apartheid, who are widely
regarded as quislings. As an example, one
anti-divestiture figure, the mayor of Soweto,
was "chosen" in elections with less than 4
percent of the eligible voters participating —
hardly a manifestation of the voice of the
people.
The real black leaders aren't allowed to tell
us their feelings about the subject. Calling for
divestiture is a crime in South Africa.
The alternatives to divestiture are not
pleasant. Keep in mind that South Africa is a
police state, where the press is censored and
individuals are subject to arbitrary arrest for

their beliefs. Appeals to morality and sweet
reason are unlikely to be effective in such a
situation. If apartheid — a system upon which
the whole economy of South Africa is based
— is to be changed, force must be used. One
can only hope that economic force will work
before military force is necessary.
But aren't efforts by privileged American
students to change the political system in
South Africa just liberal hypocrisy? Perhaps
they would be, if Stanford students didn't di
rectly benefit from the high profit rates result
ing from the exploitation of the South African
people. Our position is not that of superior
outsiders pointing out the sins of others — we
are participants in an immoral system and we
have to stop receiving the rewards of it if we
want to act like members of the human fam
ily.
The problem of South Africa is the same
problem we find, in a somewhat less virulent
form, in Israel. There it is not blacks, but the
Palestinians who lived and are living on
Israeli-controlled land, who are not treated as
real human beings.
It is not a question of who uses violence
against whom — yes, the PLO has committed
terrible crimes, and so have Israelis, through
their government and as individual terrorists.
Each retaliation leads to another, in the cycle
of an eye for an eye for an eye. One must go
beyond the violent acts of both sides to the
sources of the conflict.
Nor is it a question of who has "historic
rights" to the land. People argue, as though it
mattered, about whether the Palestinians
were evicted from lands they had worked for

thousands of years, or merely for six genera
tions. It really doesn't matter, nor does it mat
ter what the Bible or the Koran says, or who
inhabited the territories in the first century.
The conflict is between the living, not the
dead.
