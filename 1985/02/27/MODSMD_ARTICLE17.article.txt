## The 						human cost of our dirty little war 
### 
Nine days before I arrived in Nicaragua this past
December for a month-long visit, 22 state
employees, most of them belonging to TELCOR,
the national communications agency, were killed in
an ambush as they traveled through the country's
northern region on their way to do voluntary work
in the coffee harvest. The truck in which they were

riding was rocketed and sprayed with machine-gun
fire by a force of 200 contras, as the U.S.-backed
counterrevolutionaries who are fighting to over
throw Nicaragua's government are known. Then
the contras moved in and bayoneted the survivors.
To finish the job off, the contras poured gasoline
over the truck and set it afire. A number of the oc
cupants who were still alive at this point were
burned to death. A handful of the passengers
escaped to bear witness to the massacre.
The day before I left, a little barrio of Managua
where I had many friends received the news that 12
of its young men, aged 16 to 23, who had been ser
ving in the army, had just been killed in another am
bush in the northern part of Nicaragua.
These two events bracketed my stay in
Nicaragua, but they were distinctive only in that
they were especially dramatic. Not a day went by
without reports of more people, both soldiers and
civilians, getting killed and wounded by the con
tras.
It quickly became evident to me that the contra
war had greatly intensified since my previous visit
to Nicaragua in the summer of 1983. The figures
bear this out. In 1984, according to an end-of-the
year government summary, at least 1,000 soldiers
and 1,500 civilians, including 300 children under
12, were killed by the contras (who themselves al
legedly lost 3,000 dead), bringing to approximately
8,000 the number of Nicaraguans who have died in
the three-year-old war. Of this total, more than
half have been civilians. Thousands of other com
batants and non-combatants were wounded by
contra attacks in 1984. This in a country of less
than three million.
The stepped-up war is exacting a devastating ma
terial toll on Nicaragua's economy ($250 million in
direct destruction of productive facilities alone).
But still more tragic is its human cost, and it is this
aspcct of the war I want to focus on here.
In the United States, the war the contras are
waging is usually referred to as "the secret war,"
even though it has long since been an open secret.
The Nicaraguans have another name for it — they

call it "la guerra sucia," "the dirty war." This
reflects their view that the contras' mode of warfare
is cruel and cowardly.
The contras tend to rely on assaults on civilians,
sneak attacks on inexperienced young militia units
and economic sabotage, while avoiding doing battle
with the regular army; they almost always retreat
into the mountains or across the border with Hon
duras or Costa Rica as soon as the regular army ap
pears on the scene.
Such tactics should not be confused with those
employed in classic guerrilla warfare of the sort

Reagan may eulogize
them as 'freedom
fighters,' but in
Nicaragua the contras
are commonly referred
to as 'las bestias' — 'the
beasts.'

currently going on in El Salvador, for the contras,
enjoying very little popular support, make the
people the target of their war, rather than its base;
their goal is to make the people suffer so much that
they turn against the Sandinista regime, or else
simply to frighten them into quiescence. The fact
that the contras are out to terrorize the populace,
rather than to gain its backing, explains why they
routinely rob, kidnap, rape, torture and kill
civilians.
These practices have led the great bulk of the
Nicaraguan population to regard the contras with a
mixture of fear and hatred. President Reagan may
eulogize them as "freedom fighters," but in
Nicaragua they are commonly referred to as "las
bestias" — "the beasts."
While traveling in northern Nicaragua, I had the
opportunity to view some of the contras' handi
work. In the course of visiting several hospitals, I
saw:
• a civilian woman in her 20s, unconscious, who
had been badly wounded in a contra ambush;
• an 11-year-old boy who had been so badly

traumatized by a contra attack that he had not
spoken a word since;
• a 14-year-old militia member, shot while helping
repel a contra attack on his village, who was
recovering from major surgery on his intestinal
tract;
• an agronomy student, age 26, who had been
severely wounded in both legs during a battle with
the contras. At best, one of his legs will now be
shorter than the other; at worst, the more badly
damaged leg will have to be amputated.
These are the immediately obvious human costs
imposed on Nicaragua by the war. But the war is
also taking a more insidious toll. A whole genera
tion of Nicaraguans is growing up with the war as
the central fact in their lives. While the abnormal,
emergency situation in which these young people
find themselves coming of age has some positive ef
fects on them, evoking a spirit of responsibility and
self-sacrifice, its impact is on balance profoundly
unhealthy. Sustained hatred of the sort inevitably
entailed in a national war effort cannot help but
have a malign influence on their psyches. The enor
mous reserves of idealism and creative energy
which the revolution has unleashed in Nicaragua's
youth ought to be going into constructive activities
like the literacy and health campaigns of recent
years, instead of being expended on the ugly,
destructive business of warfare.
But as long as the United States supports the
contras, Nicaragua is destined to watch its most
committed and talented young people, its best hope
for the future, consumed year after year by a
seemingly endless war. Instead of acquiring the
skills Nicaragua desperately needs, they will volun
teer to fight on the frontiers; many of them will die,
many more will return physically crippled, and all
will be to some degree psychologically scarred by
the experience.
It is up to us Americans to alter this state of af
fairs, to compel the Reagan administration to bring
this immoral, senseless, bullying aggression to a
prompt halt. It is time that we took responsibility
for our government's actions abroad, and for these
actions' human consequences. Nicaraguans have
just the same right as we do to lead normal, peace
ful, productive lives. Let us bring their protractcd
suffering to an end.
Asking Congressman Ed Zschau and other rep
resentatives to vote against the upcoming adminis
tration request for renewed aid for the contras
would be a good place to start.

find themselves coming of age has some positive ef
fects on them, evoking a spirit of responsibility and
self-sacrifice, its impact is on balance profoundly
unhealthy. Sustained hatred of the sort inevitably
entailed in a national war effort cannot help but
have a malign influence on their psyches. The enor
mous reserves of idealism and creative energy
which the revolution has unleashed in Nicaragua's
youth ought to be going into constructive activities
like the literacy and health campaigns of recent
years, instead of being expended on the ugly,
destructive business of warfare.
But as long as the United States supports the
contras, Nicaragua is destined to watch its most
committed and talented young people, its best hope
for the future, consumed year after year by a
seemingly endless war. Instead of acquiring the
skills Nicaragua desperately needs, they will volun
teer to fight on the frontiers; many of them will die,
many more will return physically crippled, and all
will be to some degree psychologically scarred by
the experience.
It is up to us Americans to alter this state of af
fairs, to compel the Reagan administration to bring
this immoral, senseless, bullying aggression to a
prompt halt. It is time that we took responsibility
for our government's actions abroad, and for these
actions' human consequences. Nicaraguans have
just the same right as we do to lead normal, peace
ful, productive lives. Let us bring their protractcd
suffering to an end.
Asking Congressman Ed Zschau and other rep
resentatives to vote against the upcoming adminis

would be a good place to start.

Nine days before I arrived in Nicaragua this past
December for a month-long visit, 22 state
employees, most of them belonging to TELCOR,
the national communications agency, were killed in
an ambush as they traveled through the country's
northern region on their way to do voluntary work
in the coffee harvest. The truck in which they were

VIEWPOINT

riding was rocketed and sprayed with machine-gun
fire by a force of 200 contras, as the U.S.-backed
counterrevolutionaries who are fighting to over
throw Nicaragua's government are known. Then
the contras moved in and bayoneted the survivors.
To finish the job off, the contras poured gasoline
over the truck and set it afire. A number of the oc
cupants who were still alive at this point were
burned to death. A handful of the passengers
escaped to bear witness to the massacre.
The day before I left, a little barrio of Managua
where I had many friends received the news that 12
of its young men, aged 16 to 23, who had been ser
ving in the army, had just been killed in another am
bush in the northern part of Nicaragua.
These two events bracketed my stay in
Nicaragua, but they were distinctive only in that
they were especially dramatic. Not a day went by
without reports of more people, both soldiers and
civilians, getting killed and wounded by the con
tras.
It quickly became evident to me that the contra
war had greatly intensified since my previous visit
to Nicaragua in the summer of 1983. The figures
bear this out. In 1984, according to an end-of-the
year government summary, at least 1,000 soldiers
and 1,500 civilians, including 300 children under
12, were killed by the contras (who themselves al
legedly lost 3,000 dead), bringing to approximately
8,000 the number of Nicaraguans who have died in
the three-year-old war. Of this total, more than
half have been civilians. Thousands of other com
batants and non-combatants were wounded by
contra attacks in 1984. This in a country of less
than three million.
The stepped-up war is exacting a devastating ma
terial toll on Nicaragua's economy ($250 million in
direct destruction of productive facilities alone).
But still more tragic is its human cost, and it is this
aspcct of the war I want to focus on here.
In the United States, the war the contras are
waging is usually referred to as "the secret war,"
even though it has long since been an open secret.
The Nicaraguans have another name for it — they

call it "la guerra sucia," "the dirty war." This
reflects their view that the contras' mode of warfare
is cruel and cowardly.
The contras tend to rely on assaults on civilians,
sneak attacks on inexperienced young militia units
and economic sabotage, while avoiding doing battle
with the regular army; they almost always retreat
into the mountains or across the border with Hon
duras or Costa Rica as soon as the regular army ap
pears on the scene.
Such tactics should not be confused with those
employed in classic guerrilla warfare of the sort

Reagan may eulogize
them as 'freedom
fighters,' but in
Nicaragua the contras
are commonly referred
to as 'las bestias' — 'the
beasts.'

currently going on in El Salvador, for the contras,
enjoying very little popular support, make the
people the target of their war, rather than its base;
their goal is to make the people suffer so much that
they turn against the Sandinista regime, or else
simply to frighten them into quiescence. The fact
that the contras are out to terrorize the populace,
rather than to gain its backing, explains why they
routinely rob, kidnap, rape, torture and kill
civilians.
These practices have led the great bulk of the
Nicaraguan population to regard the contras with a
mixture of fear and hatred. President Reagan may
eulogize them as "freedom fighters," but in
Nicaragua they are commonly referred to as "las
bestias" — "the beasts."
While traveling in northern Nicaragua, I had the
opportunity to view some of the contras' handi
work. In the course of visiting several hospitals, I
saw:
• a civilian woman in her 20s, unconscious, who
had been badly wounded in a contra ambush;
• an 11-year-old boy who had been so badly

traumatized by a contra attack that he had not
spoken a word since;
• a 14-year-old militia member, shot while helping
repel a contra attack on his village, who was
recovering from major surgery on his intestinal
tract;
• an agronomy student, age 26, who had been
severely wounded in both legs during a battle with
the contras. At best, one of his legs will now be
shorter than the other; at worst, the more badly
damaged leg will have to be amputated.
These are the immediately obvious human costs
imposed on Nicaragua by the war. But the war is
also taking a more insidious toll. A whole genera
tion of Nicaraguans is growing up with the war as
the central fact in their lives. While the abnormal,
emergency situation in which these young people
find themselves coming of age has some positive ef
fects on them, evoking a spirit of responsibility and
self-sacrifice, its impact is on balance profoundly
