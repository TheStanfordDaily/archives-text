Stereotyping Indians
There are very few Native
Americans on campus. We would
like very much to be heard, but we
are just too small of a voice to hear.
Nevertheless, the Indian community
here does exist and does request and
deserve the recognition that all the
different groups on campus receive.
Native Americans have been
misunderstood since the landing of
Columbus. Today there are people
who know nothing of Indians, their
heritage, customs and ways of life.
Many have never met or interacted
with a Native American. What most
people do know is what the media
have easily managed to condition into
the minds of millions through false
and ridiculous stereotypes. It is time,
and has been time for a long while,
for non-Indians to be allowed to see
what Indians are really like.
For a start. Native Americans have

a distinct understanding of what we
call Mother Earth. This Earth is
beautiful, it's alive and growing. It is
a place of peace and strength.
Respect and honor are held for the
Earth and all living and non-living
things that walk on it, fly over it,
swim in it and rest upon it.
Next quarter the Stanford Ameri
can Indian Organization will be
sponsoring the 14th Annual Stanford
Pow Wow. As a member of the
Indian community at Stanford, I
offer to all of you my most enthusi
astic invitation to this celebration. I
also ask for your support so that this
year's Pow Wow will be the best, and
for your diligence in trying to
become aware and understand
America's first people.
