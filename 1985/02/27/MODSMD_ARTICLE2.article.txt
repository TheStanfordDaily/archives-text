# Killer up for parole
## But Streleski says he will not agree to conditions 
### BAIE NETZER Senior staff writer 
Theodore Streleski, a former doctoral candidate who
beat to death a Stanford mathematics professor, will have
his third chance at parole next week, but plans to remain
in prison for six more months.
Streleski, sentenced to eight years imprisonment for the
1978 killing of Mathematics Prof. Karel deLeeuw, is
scheduled to be released on parole March 8. On March 7,
he will be asked to sign papers outlining the conditions of
parole.
However, Streleski, 48, has indicated he will refuse to
sign a parole agreement that restricts his entering the Bay
Area, according to Les Johnson, spokesman for the State
Department of Corrections. Johnson said that Streleski's
intentions were made clear in a memo from Robert Gore,
assistant director of the Corrections Department.
Under California law, Streleski, convicted of second
degree murder, first became eligible for parole last March
after serving two-thirds — or five-and-one-half years —
of his sentence. He refused last March to abide by parole
conditions and had his parole revoked for six months by
the Board of Prison Terms. In Semptember he again
opted to remain in prison rather than agree to parole con
ditions. Now he is up for the third — and most likely the
final — parole of his sentence.

The board may extend his sentence for another six
months if Streleski again refuses the parole conditions on
March 7. But the killer's sentence — shortened one year
for good behavior — ends on Sept. 8, meaning he will be
released then with no conditions.
On Aug. 18, 1978, Streleski bludgeoned deLeeuw to
death with a two-pound hammer, explaining later that he
killed the professor to protest the way Stanford treats its
graduate students.
One year after the murder, Streleski told the San Jose
Mercury News he felt no remorse over the murder. In
March of last year, Streleski said he refused to sign the
parole agreement to emphasize his statement against
Stanford.
"The practical justification is that 1 committed murder
to make a statement against Stanford," he said. "I under
cut that statement if I go back on it in any way."
When Streleski first became eligible for parole last
March, University President Donald Kennedy and San
Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein objected to Streleski's
release in the Bay Area. The Department of Corrections
then inserted a parole restriction that prevented Streleski
from returning to four Bay Area counties surrounding
Stanford. Officials planned to release Streleski in Orange
County, California, but he opted to remain in prison until
the time of his unconditional discharge.
