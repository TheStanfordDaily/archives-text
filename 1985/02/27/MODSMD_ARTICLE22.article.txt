## Stanford coasts by Warriors 
### JOHN LIS Editorial staff 
A three-run homer by Pete
Stanicek keyed a five-run second in
ning, and Kevin Kunkel, Lee Plemel
and Rick Dietz combined on a six
hitter as the Stanford baseball team
breezed past Stanislaus State 7-2 yes
terday at Sunken Diamond.
The win was Stanford's sixth
straight and raised the Cardinal's
season record to 12-3. Stanislaus fell
to 4-9.
Stanicek's home run was his first of
the season, and he finished the day
with two hits in four at-bats.
Kunkel pitched five shutout in
nings, surrendering only two hits, in
raising his record to 3-1.
Asked whether he thought beating
the Division 111 Warriors would be so
routine, Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess replied, "You'd hope so.
We could have scored more, but we
left some people on base." Stanford
stranded nine baserunners.
Marquess treated the game as a
warm-up for this weekend's confer
ence opener against Arizona State at
Sunken Diamond.
"We weren't going to go with
Kunkel for more than five innings,"
Marquess said. "We figure he has to
go for us this weekend. We were just
giving him a workout. We also
wanted Plemel and Dietz to throw
some."
Plemel gave up two hits in one in
ning of work, allowing an unearned
run. Dietz finished up the last three
innings, surrendering one run on two
hits. It was Dietz's second earned run
in 14 innings this year.
"They were after me," the sopho
more right-hander said. "They swung
the bats well, and I didn't pitch that
well."
The Cardinal also swung the bats
well, banging out 12 hits. Third
baseman Ruben Amaro went 2-for-4,
including his second home run of the
season. Mark Davis also had a pair of
hits, and first baseman Rick
Lundblade added his seventh homer
of the season in the seventh inning.

"I don't have a lot of them,"
Amaro said of his own round-tripper,
his second of the year. "It was in the
only place that 1 can hit it out — a
fastball out in the middle of the plate,
a little up — almost the exact place
the other one was."
Amaro's homer climaxed the Card
inal's big second inning. Mike
Deßenon started things off when
Stanislaus starter Peter Maldonado
hit him with a pitch. Deßenon moved
to second on Walt Harris' groundout
and scored on a single by Davis.
Shortstop John Verducci singled
Davis to third with two outs, then
Stanicek parked one over the left
field fence before Amaro hit his solo
shot to make it 5-0.
"Pete has been swinging the bat
well," Marquess said of Stanicek.
"He's been playing well, both of
fensively and defensively. He's
started to hit the ball the way we
know he can."
Stanford picked up a pair of runs in
the seventh off Warrior reliever Jim
Massey. Lundblade opened with his
24th career homer to center field.
Deßenon then singled, moved to
second on a groundout, and scored on
a Toi Cook single.
For Stanislaus, right fielder Jeff
Hintz was 2-for-2 with an RBI and
second baseman Bert McAfee went
2-for-3 with an RBI double.
The Warriors used five pitchers in
the losing effort. "They really weren't
that bad," Amaro said. "They're not
overpowering. They try to hit spots
and throw breaking pitches to try to
keep you off stride."
Stanford finishes its pre-conference
schedule today when U.S. Interna
tional comes up from San Diego for
one game, beginning at 2:30 p.m. at
Sunken Diamond.
"I don't know much about them,"
Marquess said. "They're a Division I
school trying to build their program.
Marquess said he will start Ugo
Colella on the mound today, and will
also use David Harris, Jack
McDowell and Dietz.
