# Card lands 2 recruits
## 
### GEOFF SANBORN Editorial staff 
In less than one week, the Stanford basketball pro
gram has taken two huge steps in its long, hard climb
toward Pacific 10 Conference respectability.
First, the Cardinal walked all over Pac-10 leader
USC on Thursday night, 86-65. Then, two highly re
garded recruits made official what had been probable
for more than two months: Terry Taylor and Howard
Wright will attend Stanford next fall.
"Both offer some different dimension from what we
have had this year," Cardinal Basketball Coach Tom
Davis said yesterday. "This completes our recruiting
season ... and I think we did about as fine a job as we
could."
Earlier, Stanford had received letters of intent from
three other high school players â€” 6-foot-10, 240-
pound center Derek Bruton from Gilroy, 6-4 guard
Todd Lichti from Concord and 6-7 forward Bryan
McSweeney from Dana Hills.
Taylor, a 6-1 point guard from Rangeview High in
Aurora, Colo., was named the Street and Smith
preseason high school All-America team. Not only did
he score close to 26 points per game this season, but
according to Davis, he has already locked up valedic
torian honors from his school.
"With Keith Ramee going into his senior year, we
knew we had to have a point guard,' Davis said.
Taylor is "a great outside shooter, and that's some
thing we haven't had."
Wright, a 6-8 forward/center with "a quickness di
mension that some of our players just don't have," ac
cording to Davis, is from Patrick Henry High in San
Diego, the alma mater of injured Cardinal forward
Steve Brown.
Davis believes that the success Brown has had at
Stanford "probably had an influence on (Wright's)
decision." The fact that Wright's father, former San
Diego Charger lineman Ernie Wright, was able to warn
him to avoid the hard-sell approach of some college
recruiters didn't hurt, either.
Taylor's father, a former college basketball coach,
also helped his son steer clear of the more high
powered basketball schools, leaving Stanford a less
cluttered path toward the prize recruit.
Davis is excited about his acquisitions, but he does
not expect any of them to step in and contribute heav
ily next season.
"With all freshmen, we realize it will take some time
to adjust to Pac-10 play," Davis said. "Next year,
we're only going to be as good as our seniors are."
