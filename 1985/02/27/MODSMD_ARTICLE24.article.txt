## Geiger: Ticket prices stand 
### JOHN LIS Editorial staff 
Student football ticket prices for the 1985 season
will stay the same as last year's for a home
schedule that includes a match-up with perennial
Southwest Conference power Texas, Athletic
Director Andy Geiger announced at a press confer
ence yesterday.
"This is our crass promotional announcement."
Geiger said.
The game with the Longhorns Sept. 28 will be
the first in the five-game student season-ticket
package. The package also includes games with
conference rivals UCLA, Arizona and Oregon
State, as well as Big Game here against California.
The traditional Orientation Weekend game with
San Jose State has been moved back a week to
Sept. 14, so there will be no football game the
weekend freshmen arrive.
A season-ticket package will cost $26. Individual
game tickets will cost $5, and a Big Game ticket
will cost $10. Tickets for the San Jose State game
will be $4.
For the traditional road trip to USC, tickets will
be $7.50.
The game with Texas will start at 3 p.m., a

departure from the usual 1:30 p.m. kickoff time.
"We're intrigued with the 3 o'clock start and
eager to see how it works," Geiger said.
The change was made on the basis of last
season's late afternoon kickoff for the USC game,
which was televised by CBS and brought lights to
Stanford football for the first time.
Jim Colton, director of marketing, said, "When
we hosted the USC game last season, we received
much favorable reaction from people in the Bay
Area."
Because the Texas game is earlier in the fall, no
lights will be necessary this year. The first home
game against San Jose State will also begin at 3
p.m.
Geiger also promised that there will be less Stan
ford football on television this season. Last year
there were six Stanford games televised, four of
those home contests.
"We're concerned with the proliferation of foot
ball on television," he said. "We're concerned
about approaching the level of a studio sport."
Stanford averaged only 50,942 spectators per
game in 1984 in a stadium that has been expanded
to seat 85,934 for this year. The increase in seating
is due to the removal of the fence along the top of

the stadium, which will allow seating in Row 80,
the last row.
Geiger said that Stanford should be on CBS
regional or national telecasts "a couple of times" in
1985, and maybe once as part of a syndicated
Pacific 10 Conference package.
"I will not permit more than one home game to
be televised outside of CBS," he said.
"We think less TV is better than more TV. We
think more schools should follow the lead we're
setting and say no to TV."
The Athletic Department is aiming its marketing
campaign this year at families, offering half-price
season packages for seats in the corners of Stanford
Stadium, seats that were often empty last year.
The family plan, which admits four family mem
bers to the general admission section of the end
zone, will be offered again this season. Cost is $69
for the first five games.
The department has mailed 70,000 brochures to
prospective ticket-buyers in areas defined by ZIP
codes that are in residential areas and likely to have
children.
"This is a very active area," Geiger said, "and
there are a great many options people have."

Stanford students will pay the same amount for football tickets next
year, but in two scheduled 3 p.m. games, they will miss out on the peak
Stanford Stadium tanning hours.
