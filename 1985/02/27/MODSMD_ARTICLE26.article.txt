# Netters shut out SDSU
## Card 'workmen' get job done 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford men's tennis team, ranked No. 1 in
the country, defeated San Diego State with
"workman-like" efficiency yesterday, 9-0, for its
seventh consecutive dual match win of the season.
Coach Dick Gould was especially pleased with
the concentration his players showed on the court
against one of the Cardinal's weaker preseason op
ponents.
The day's "typical" score, accounting for three
of the nine matches, was a Stanford victory, 6-2, 6-
2. Jim Grabb's No. 2 singles win over San Diego
State's Brent Zimmerman was one of those three.
"I'm really pleased with the way Danny and Jim
played," Gould said. (Dan Goldie won his No. 1
singles match, 6-1, 6-0.) "They came out and did a
workman-like job. Sometimes that's easier said
than done. If you're not careful, you can end up
winning against an easier opponent 6-3 in the
third. . . . You can get careless," he said.
Goldie's opponent, Julio Noriega, was at one
time the top junior player in South America.
Goldie's defeat of the Peruvian in straight sets
raises his string of consecutive dual-match wins to
11, including 21 consecutive set wins. At 5-0 in

dual matches, 11-2 overall and owner of the No. 1
ranking in collegiate tennis from the Intercollegiate
Tennis Coaches Association, the junior has
definitely enjoyed a golden season thus far.
In the No. 3 singles match, Stanford's Eric
Rosenfeld broke opponent Lance Lareau's three
match winning streak with a 7-5, 6-4 win. One of
the Cardinal's two set losses occurred in the last
singles match, where Paul Robinson dropped a
second set tiebreaker to Jim Kellogg.
Kellogg usually plays No. 4 or No. 5 singles for
the Aztecs, but said he hasn't been playing his best
tennis, and was therefore placed in the No. 6 spot.
"In my last two matches I haven't played up to
my potential like I did today," Kellogg said. "I
played well today, except the worst aspect of my
game has been my return of serve, and he
(Robinson) had a big serve."
Kellogg also played in the No. 1 doubles match
with teammate Zimmerman. Derrick Rostagno and
Pat McEnroe won the match, 6-2, 6-2, despite
Rostagno's playing with a visible limp, and
McEnroe did not get to warm up in any singles
match.
Rostagno injured his ankle in a court collision
with McEnroe in a match against San Jose State.

Kellogg did not seem to notice that the injury both
ered his opponent.
"Rostagno is really a great player — he hits fan
tastic angles. They are a good (doubles) team.
McEnroe just rips on his backhand," Kellogg said.
A new doubles team of Rod Coull and Daryl Lee
had an unexpectedly easy time in the third doubles
match defeating San Diego State's Noriega and
Nicki Getz, 6-4, 6-2.
Replacing Georgie McKee, who is overseas in
Tours, Lee is Stanford's newest addition to the
team roster. Gould had no complaints with the
match, especially because Noriega is the Aztecs'
top player.
Stanford has another match today against the
University of San Diego, currently 8-3. Its No. 1
player is Jim McNamee, 10-2 overall, and 5-1 in
singles as well as in doubles, with partner Maris
Luters. Alejandro Ramos is currently 2-3 at No. 2
singles, and 3-2 in No. 2 doubles with Doug Brad
ley.
Gould will probably play four of his top six
singles and doubles players against USD, similar to
what he did against San Diego State. Stanford's
next home game after today's will be against Foot
hill College March 6.

Replacing Georgie McKee, who is overseas in
Tours, Lee is Stanford's newest addition to the
team roster. Gould had no complaints with the
match, especially because Noriega is the Aztecs'
top player.
Stanford has another match today against the
University of San Diego, currently 8-3. Its No. 1
player is Jim McNamee, 10-2 overall, and 5-1 in
singles as well as in doubles, with partner Maris
Luters. Alejandro Ramos is currently 2-3 at No. 2
singles, and 3-2 in No. 2 doubles with Doug Brad
ley.
Gould will probably play four of his top six
singles and doubles players against USD, similar to
what he did against San Diego State. Stanford's
next home game after today's will be against Foot
hill College March 6.

Eric Rosenfeld, one of Coach Dick Gould's "workman-like" players,
beat SDSU's Lance Loreal yesterday afternoon, 7-5, 6-4.
