# Spikers host winless Loyola
## 
### ROB GRAHAM Staff sportswriter 
After sweeping the visiting Hawaii
Rainbows in a two-game series over
the weekend, the Stanford men's vol
leyball team, ranked sixth nationally,
lines up tonight against league op
ponent Loyola-Marymount. The
match begins at 7:30 p.m. in Maples
Pavilion.
The Cardinal is looking to improve
its 5-3 mark in the California Inter
collegiate Volleyball Association and
its 16-4 overall record. The squad is
tied for fourth place with UC-Santa
Barbara and is chasing Pepperdine
(5-0), UCLA (5-1) and USC (5-1).
San Diego State, at 2-4, is two games
behind Stanford.
With 16 wins already in the bag
and only 12 more games left on its
slate, the Cardinal men's team is
assured of its first winning season
ever. Moreover, Stanford is making
its first credible challenge for a bid in
the postseason regional tournament.
The top five teams from the CIVA
are traditionally awarded invitations.
Just as the Stanford program is
beginning to improve, its Loyola-
Marymount counterpart is in the
midst of turmoil. Tonight's visitors
sport an 0-5 CIVA mark and stand in
ninth place, a half game better than
Long Beach State (0-6). Stanford,

which ended last year's CIVA play in
the eighth spot at 6-12, twice downed
the Lions in three quick sets a year
ago.
To turn things around, Loyola-
Marymount hired Kevin Cleary, a
one-time All-America setter at San
Diego State, as its new coach. Card
inal Co-coach Don Shaw called
Cleary a "kind of beach player who
has recruited more beach players
from the area to play for him." So far,
it would seem that Cleary and his
troop of surfers prefer the sun and the
sand to the lights and the hard surface
of the indoor game.
In January, Stanford pounded the
-Lions in an early round match of the
Santa Barbara/Michelob Light Invita
tional, 15-7, 15-13. Stanford went on
to a surprise victory in the tourna
ment, defeating UCLA in the final.
Still, Loyola-Marymount has
shown indications of improvement.
It has managed to take a game
each off league leaders UCLA and
Pepperdine. Oddly, Stanford, with its
playoff aspirations, was dumped in
three straight games by the Bruins in
a CIVA match a month ago.
Stanford will be paced by junior
Chris Braun, who leads the team in
kills with 121. He has combined those
kills with a hitting percentage of .325.
