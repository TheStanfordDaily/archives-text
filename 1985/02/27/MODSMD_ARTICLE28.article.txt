# Softballers face unknown in Cal
## 
### DAVE DUTCHER Staff sportswriter 
If Coach Kathy Lincoln gets
what she expects, Stanford's
softball double-header against
California at Berkeley tomorrow
will be a "typical Cal-Stanford
game."
"They're high for us and we're
high for them," said Lincoln,
whose team fell to 5-9 when it lost
a double-header to San Jose City
College this weekend. The Card
inal will get a chance for revenge
at San Jose Friday.
Lincoln said she doesn't know a
lot about Cal, which plays in the
Northern Pacific Conference.
Stanford, which will play its first
Western Collegiate Athletic Asso
ciation game March 15 at Fuller
ton State, last played the Bears
last year in the Libby Matson
tournament at Lodi and lost 7-0.
"I don't know much about
them, except for the line scores in
the paper," Lincoln said. "It's
hard to get an indication from
that." Lincoln said the Cardinal
might face one of Cal's top recruits

from last season, sophomore Kim
Moe, tomorrow at 2 p.m.
However, Bears Coach Donna
Terry declined to say whether
Moe would pitch.
"1 don't set the lineup until
game time," Terry said. "It
depends on how they look in work
outs and how they're playing."
Terry said she also doesn't know
much about her team's opponent.
"Stanford was just getting
started as a club team" last year,
when the Cardinal play,ed in the
Libby Matson tournament,
Terry said. "I respected them.
They were solid. I'm anticipating a
contest with them."
Against the 6-4 Bears, Stanford
will be looking to improve its con
sistency and hitting, in addition to
its record, Lincoln said.
"We need to work on our con
sistency. We were hitting well last
weekend, but our bats went silent
last Friday (in a 2-1 first-game loss
to San Jose City College)," Lin
coln said. "Their pitching wasn't
strong, we're just not getting the
key hits when we need them."
