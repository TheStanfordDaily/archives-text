# Card golfers challenge Tulsa
## 
### KEN STEVENS Staff sportswriter 
Following what Coach Tim
Baldwin labeled a "hotly contested"
qualifying round, the Stanford
women golfers return to action today
in a dual match against perennial
powerhouse Tulsa at Cypress Point.
With only sophomore Kathleen

McCarthy exempt from qualifying for
this week's action, eight golfers
battled for four spots on the roster.
Junior Julie Carmichael and fresh
men Kay Cornelius, Trish McGonigle
and Stephanie Kondik were vic
torious, with Kondik edging sopho
more Adrienne Gilmartin and fresh
man Anna Oxenstierna for the fifth

spot by one stroke. Oxenstierna had
held the fifth position at the last
tournament, in Arizona.
Today's match against Tulsa is a
"once-in-a-lifetime opportunity" for
the Cardinal golfers, according to the
Stanford coach. "Tulsa, year in and
year out, has the No. 1 golf team in
the country," Baldwin said.

The two schools have been playing
in dual matches for the past few
seasons, but last year's match had to
be canceled because of rain. Baldwin
said he would like to make the match
a tradition. "They (Tulsa) are tradi
tionally No. 1 and we're trying our
darnedest to become No. 1," he said.
McCarthy was eagerly anticipating
today's challenge. "They've got girls
with a little more experience, but that
shouldn't be a big factor," McCarthy
said. "It'll be a lot of fun."
One of Tulsa's experienced golfers
is British Amateur Champion Jody
Rosenthal, whom Baldwin considers to
be the top amateur woman in the
United States. "Day in and day out,
she's the best," Baldwin said.
Following today's match, the Card
inal women will stay in the Monterey
area for this weekend's Lady Spartan,
at Fort Ord and Pebble Beach.
Baldwin expects a very competitive
field at the tournament, which opens
Friday at Fort Ord.
Among the strong teams that will
be competing at the Lady Spartan this
weekend are Tulsa, Furman, North
Carolina, San Jose State, UCLA and
USC. "Any one of us has the ability
to win it," Baldwin said.
Currently, Stanford stands at No.
14 in the national computer rankings,
a precarious position as far as the
Cardinal's chances for a berth in the
NCAA championships in Cape Cod,
Mass., are concerned. In May, the top
14 teams in the final computer stand
ings will advance to the champion
ships.
Since winning the Stanford Inter
collegiate on its home course, the
Cardinal has been able to turn in no
better effort than its fourth-place
finish in the Desert Classic at Palm
Springs. A strong finish in the Lady
Spartan would go a long way toward
cementing Stanford's place in the
NCAA tournament.
