# ASSU debates refunds
## 
### JOYA WESLEY Staff writer 
A proposal to have students vote on the elimination of
fee refunds received a favorable response and was
referred to committee at last night's ASSU Senate
meeting.
The bill, introduced by Senator Mark Soble, would
place the issue before student voters in this spring's ASSU
election.
The senate also voted to place the fee assessment re
quests of KZSU and SURE on the spring ballot. The fee
requests of the Axe Committee and the Chaparral were
also placed on the ballot, but were divided. Only one part
of the divided Chaparral request was placed on the ballot.
The other portion, which would fund extra Chaparral ex
penses if the staff offers the magazine at no cost, will re
quire a successful petition drive to get onto the ballot.
In other business, a set of three resolutions on the
Board of Trustees' recent actions on divestiture was intro
duced, and a constitutional amendment requiring the fil
ling of vacancies on the Council of Presidents (COP) was
placed on the spring ballot.
Soble cited the inflation of the special fee during the
past few years as the major motivating force behind the
introduction of his bill.
â€¢ "Special fees are going up and they're going up fast," he
said. The reason for this is that the Senate Appropriations
Committee budgets between 20 and 25 percent over
groups' actual fee requests in order to compensate for
refunds.
This system, according to Senate Chair Eric Berg,
causes the entire student population to pay one-third
more than it would otherwise need to, solely to provide
refunds for the third of the student body that takes them.

In addition to this financial consideration, Soble said he
feels it is unethical to connect the refund system to voting.
"As a rule, democratic countries give citizens an option
to vote; only a few nation-states make voting mandatory,"
he stated in a letter supporting his bill. By making refunds
available only to voting students, those who fail to vote
lose access to a "substantial sum of money."
Soble's amendment does provide for a means by which
students may remove money from a group to which they
morally object. This money, instead of being refunded to
the student, would go into a separate buffer fund.
"I think that (the right to morally object) is a valuable
right to protect," Soble said.
As to the effect such a bill would have on future voter
turnout, which was greatly increased by the introduction
of fee refunds. Berg was ambivalent.
Berg was also unsure of the effect Soble's measure
could have on the number of fee requests students ap
prove.
"It could be that more people vote 'no' because they
would not get a refund, or that more people vote 'yes' be
cause the overall fee would be less," he said.
The resolutions concerning the Board of Trustees' com
mittment to conditional divestiture from Motorola Corp.
included thanking the board and making two requests.
The first request calls for a clarification of the conditions
for divestment. The second request calls on the board to
address the second part of last quarter's referendum,
which asked for the development of a more responsible
investment policy that would adopt criteria for unaccepta
ble corporate behavior.
The senate voted to commit the two "request" resolu
tions to committee, but passed the resolution thanking the
