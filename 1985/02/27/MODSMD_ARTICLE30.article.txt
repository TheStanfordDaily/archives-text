# Ruggers beaten
## 
### 
The struggling Stanford men's
rugby club fell this weekend to the
visiting University of British Co
lumbia, 34-7, and to Santa Clara,
26-4, lowering its conference and
season records to 2-3 and 3-8,
respectively.
Coming off a much-needed 12-
day break, the Cardinal fell behind
the stronger and more experi
enced ÜBC early before playing
the Canadian side more evenly in
the second half. Andy McTavish's
penalty kick was the only Stanford
score as ÜBC rolled up a 20-3
halftime advantage. Then, as the
Cardinal built up more intensity,
Shannon Pekary fell on the ball in
the try zone during a ruck for the
only other Stanford score.
Against Santa Clara, the first
team came out very flat and again
fell behind early, this time trailing
18-0 at the half. Despite the Card
inal's stronger effort in the second
half, SCU still won handily, 26-4.

The lone Stanford score belonged
to Doug Rigg, who picked up a
kick that Damian Varni had
blocked and tool it in for a try.
Stanford's second team played
extremely well against SCU,
building a 7-4 halftime advantage
through hustle by the forwards
and fine backline play that
resulted in Robert Lewis' try and
Bob Levinstein's penalty kick.
But, because of an injury, the
Cardinal was forced to play the
last 20 minutes of the match one
player short, enabling SCU to
storm back for a 14-7 victory.
The third team fell to Santa
Clara, 42-3, with Levinstein's
penalty kick accounting for Stan
ford's scoring.
The Marin Lions, a club side,
visit Stanford Saturday. The
first teams play at 1 p.m., the
second teams at 3 p.m., and the
third side plays San Jose at 11 a.m.
All at Maloney Field.
