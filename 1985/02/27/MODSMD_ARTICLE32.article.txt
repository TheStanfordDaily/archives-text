## Writer discusses Jonestown 
### DAVID RISSER Senior staff writer 
John Jacobs, a reporter for the San
Francisco Examiner, attacked the
myths surrounding Jim Jones and his
People's Temple the group associ
ated with the deaths of more
than 900 people in Jonestown,
Guyana — before a crowd of about
50 last night in Roble Hall.
Jacobs spent four years reporting
on the People's Temple, which was
headquartered in San Francisco
before moving to the remote location
in South America. He has also co
authored a book on the Jonestown
tragedy, titled "Raven."
Jacobs opposes labeling the deaths
by cyanide-laced Kool-Aid a mass
suicide, prefering to term the event
"murder."
"No one can ever convince me that
children can choose to voluntarily
end their lives," he said. "I call that
murder." Jones forced the young to
drink, first from the poisoned cup.
Jacobs described the mind games
employed by Jones to create the ten
sion necessary for the tragedy to oc
cur. Every few weeks Jones con
vinced his people they were under at
tack, even staging trial suicides. Jones
attached positive values such as im
mortality to the act.
His conditioning succeeded, as his
subjects blamed themselves for not
living up to Jones' example, accord
ing to Jacobs. "Jones had twisted
people with guilt. To even con-

San Francisco Examiner reporter
template trouble in paradise would be
incapacitating."
"Jones had so stacked the deck that
death became preferable. I would
argue that that is murder." Death had
become preferable to both the horrid
conditions at Jonestown and the con
ditions that Jones convinced his sub
jects awaited any return to the
outside world.
Jacobs also attempted to dispel the
"myth that Jim Jones was a good man
who suddenly went wrong." "He was
profoundly disturbed at an early age
in life," he said.
When National Public Radio
(NPR) reported that Jones had

accused his Jonestown congregation
of attempting to murder him by
placing glass in his food, it only
related half of the story, according to
Jacobs. He found that Jones had
accused a previous congregation of
the same offense. Jones had already
discovered that he could captivate
people with words. The "lunatic
ravings of a madman" that NPR des
cribed had controlled Jim Jones for
some time, according to Jacobs.
"Jones was all things to all people
in his movement. To old blacks he of
fered salvation; to young whites and
blacks ... a social and political move
ment."
Jacobs feels that on one level Jones
was an integrationist who truly
wanted to help blacks, yet he clearly
exploited people with a theology that
"made no sense." It was "an aspect of
Jones' personality that all members of
the church were an extension of him
self," Jacobs said.
Jacobs portrayed Jones as an ex
tremely shrewd man who managed to
persuade then-San Francisco Mayor
George Moscone that his people had
provided the margin of election.
Jones was appointed to the city's
Housing Authority.
Jones admired the Soviet Union
and particularly Stalin, according to
Jacobs. "He identified (his efforts)
with the seige at Stalingrad in World
War II." At one point Jones asked for
permission to emigrate to the Soviet
Union with his disciples.
