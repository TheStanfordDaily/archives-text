Taking the guessing out of dating
Tired of taking your date to the same old, boring res
taurants? Do you rack your brain trying to think up witty
conversation topics while your date is in the powder
room? Do you cringe when it comes to thinking up new
ideas for after-dinner entertainment? Is the good-night
kiss routine getting stale?
Mark Breier, a Stanford Business School student, and
Jeff Pinsker, a 1983 Stanford economics graduate, would
like to change all that.
In the true spirit of entrepreneurship, Breier and
Pinsker have come up with the "Insta-Date Kit," a
pocket-sized product they promise will "revolutionize the
way that couples go out for the evening."
Two versions of the kit exist: one for San Francisco and
one for the Mid-Peninsula.
"Insta-Date" is designed to lead a couple through the
five stages of a date: drinks, dinner, conversation, post
dinner entertainment and the "grand finale."
At each of these stages, the couple must choose from
among eight printed destinations or activities. The catch is
that all of the choices are printed in invisible ink. Partici
pants use a "magic developer pen" to reveal their secret
destination or conversation topic, and each player is
allowed only one veto during the evening.
Socrates available 24 hours a day
Free access to Socrates, the online catalog of the libra
ries of Stanford, expands to 24 hours a day for all faculty,
students and staff beginning March 1, under a new plan
implemented by Information Technology Services (ITS)
and the University libraries.
Through this new expanded access, anyone whose ter
minal or microcomputer can communicate with the Data

Center in Forsythe Hall or anyone whose host computer
can connect to the Forsythe node on the campus network,
will be able to search Socrates free of charge at any hour
of the day.
All those with ITS accounts on the Data Center can use
the account they now have for free Socrates access.
Anyone who would like a free account for Socrates use
only can obtain one at the circulation desk in Green Li
brary or at most branch and coordinate libraries.
Staff comfortable with automation
Stanford staffers have "far more favorable" views
toward office automation than administrators nationally,
but nearly a third lack confidence in their own ability to
use computers, a new survey shows.
Overall, more than a third of administrative tasks are
now automated, according to a study on "Departmental
Office Systems" published by Department Information
Systems of Information Technology Services at Stanford.
Findings are based on questionnaires returned from
more than 420 administrative staff members.
These showed great variance in the type and degree of
automation among administrative offices, with central
offices having a higher degree of automation than aca
demic administrative units.
Automation of word processing and spreadsheets is
more common than automated database management and
online communications.
Financial analysts are the highest automators, using a
computerized system to perform nearly three-fourths of
their tasks (72 percent).
Administrative service managers used automation in
about half their tasks, followed by secretaries (41 percent)
and accountants (38 percent).
