In an article in yesterday's Daily on
student reaction to the University's
policies regarding South Africa, Steve
Dauber's views on the Board of Trus
tees decision on divesting from
Motorola Corp. were incorrectly pre
sented. The Daily reported that
Dauber would "strongly object" to
the University's divestment from
Motorola should the company renew
sales to $outh African military or
police. Actually, Dauber said he
would "not strongly object" to the
move. Also, Dauber was incorrectly
identified as the president of College
Republicans; he left that post on Feb.
14, when Jason Matherly became
president. Further, Dauber said he
was speaking as an individual, not as
a representative of the Republican
group. The Daily regrets the errors.
