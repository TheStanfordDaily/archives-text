# Co-ops get 2nd chance

### FRANK LESTER Editorial staff 
Dean of Residential Education
Norm Robinson said last night that he
has accepted in principle a proposal
to prevent Terra and Synergy from
being turned into University
operated housing.
The proposal, a form of which
was presented to Robinson last
week by Jack Chin, a senior who
has been a resident assistant for both
Terra and Synergy, is to put both co
ops on probationary status going into
this year's Draw. If more than 10 per
cent of the "assignable undergradu
ate spaces" in either house are left
vacant by the end of the Draw's
second round, the houses will become
self-operated, according to the pro
posal.
In last year's Draw, 19 of 43 spaces
in Terra were unfilled by the end of
the second round. Under the pro
posed system, the highest allowable

number of vacancies this year would
be four.
The reason that Synergy and the
French House are now also being
considered for restructured status is
that they, like Terra, have failed to fill
in previous draws. Chin, in his pro
posal, acknowledged that people in
his own house, Synergy, "may not be
happy" about being included in the
probationary status, but he added,
"Terra and Synergy have fallen short
by approximately the same numbers
over recent years. Why punish one if
both were equally guilty of not fil
ling?"
Robinson, at a meeting last night at
Terra House, emphasized that the
way for Terra to avoid the problem of
failing to fill was to intensify its
"outreach" program. The co-op net
work in the past several weeks has
been escalating its efforts to make co
op housing an attractive alternative to
upper-class dorms and Sterling Quad.

Co-op residents have been dis
tributing flyers, going to dorms and
inviting students to dinner. They plan
to intensify their outreach program in
coming weeks by holding a fair, or
ganizing a co-op week and inundating
dorms with flyers.
Robinson indicated that all this and
more would be in keeping with the
necessity for the co-ops to engage in
what he called a "special-priority
house rush" to "generate interest"
among the student body for listing co
ops as priority choices in the Draw.
Chin told The Daily that the co-op
outreach program has been successful
but "problematic." He said a student
cannot know the "incredible sense of
community" in co-ops by being told
about it by co-op residents, or even
by visiting a house.
Chin added that the outreach pro
gram has resulted in a degree of com
