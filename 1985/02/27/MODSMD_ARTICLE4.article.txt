# Co-ops get 2nd chance
## 
### FRANK LESTER Editorial staff 
Dean of Residential Education
Norm Robinson said last night that he
has accepted in principle a proposal
to prevent Terra and Synergy from
being turned into University
operated housing.
The proposal, a form of which
was presented to Robinson last
week by Jack Chin, a senior who
has been a resident assistant for both
Terra and Synergy, is to put both co
ops on probationary status going into
this year's Draw. If more than 10 per
cent of the "assignable undergradu
ate spaces" in either house are left
vacant by the end of the Draw's
second round, the houses will become
self-operated, according to the pro
posal.
In last year's Draw, 19 of 43 spaces
in Terra were unfilled by the end of
the second round. Under the pro
posed system, the highest allowable

number of vacancies this year would
be four.
The reason that Synergy and the
French House are now also being
considered for restructured status is
that they, like Terra, have failed to fill
in previous draws. Chin, in his pro
posal, acknowledged that people in
his own house, Synergy, "may not be
happy" about being included in the
probationary status, but he added,
"Terra and Synergy have fallen short
by approximately the same numbers
over recent years. Why punish one if
both were equally guilty of not fil
ling?"
Robinson, at a meeting last night at
Terra House, emphasized that the
way for Terra to avoid the problem of
failing to fill was to intensify its
"outreach" program. The co-op net
work in the past several weeks has
been escalating its efforts to make co
op housing an attractive alternative to
upper-class dorms and Sterling Quad.

Co-op residents have been dis
tributing flyers, going to dorms and
inviting students to dinner. They plan
to intensify their outreach program in
coming weeks by holding a fair, or
ganizing a co-op week and inundating
dorms with flyers.
Robinson indicated that all this and
more would be in keeping with the
necessity for the co-ops to engage in
what he called a "special-priority
house rush" to "generate interest"
among the student body for listing co
ops as priority choices in the Draw.
Chin told The Daily that the co-op
outreach program has been successful
but "problematic." He said a student
cannot know the "incredible sense of
community" in co-ops by being told
about it by co-op residents, or even
by visiting a house.
Chin added that the outreach pro
gram has resulted in a degree of com
petition among the co-ops to disas
sociate themselves from the
stereotype of being packed with
vegetarian hippies. The result has
been some "friction" and "tension"
because each house wants to put itself
in the best light, he said, but "it hasn't
gotten to a confrontational stage."
Junior Tim Self, who lives in Terra,
agreed that the house's desire to pres
ent itself as a unique residence has
brought about some tension with
other co-ops. "I don't think anyone's
trying intentionally not to be other
co-ops, but there have been prob
lems. We're definitely trying to keep
the tension low."
But junior Hae Kim, another Terra
resident, said the outreach program
has helped change students' precon
ceptions about co-op housing. "They
see how it is. Everyone seems to
really enjoy it," she said. "They can't
believe that Res Ed would want to
change anything like this."
Some Terra residents feel that Res
Ed officials might have simply fol
lowed the Feb. 6 proposal of the
Committee on Student Services-
Residences (COSS-R) to convert
Terra into a University-operated
house if it hadn't been for vocal
protests from Terra residents.
Self said that Terra had a meeting
with Rodger Whitney, director of the
Housing Center, and Diana Conklin,
director of the Row, a few days after
COSS-R made its decision.
Kim added that Res Ed was prob

ably inclined to change Terra into a
University-operated house at first be
cause it was the "most normal" of the
six co-ops and therefore the "easiest"
to change. "I think we suffer from
identifying ourselves with the other
co-ops," Kim said. She added that the
prevalent stereotype of co-ops is that
they are filled with "long-haired
Deadheads, people who are throw
backs to the '605," and that "we just
don't happen to have those kind of
people" at Terra.
Robinson remarked at last night's
meeting that the usual criterion by
which Res Ed measures whether a
house is succeeding in generating in
terest is if there are four times as
many priority choices as there are

available spaces in the house. If the
ratio is two to one, he said, "you
should start to worry."
"So go out there and do it to them
before they do it to you," he advised
the Terra audience. "As we've said to
anyone who will listen, it's not us who
have to be convinced, it's the stu
dents. It's our hope that a large back
log of people will be beating at the
door to get in at Terra."
The next several days will see a
process of what Chin's proposal
termed a "hammering out" of the in
tricacies of the agreement between
Terra and Res Ed. This will include
presenting in writing a statement of
the house's desire to be converted
into a self-op rather than a U-op.
