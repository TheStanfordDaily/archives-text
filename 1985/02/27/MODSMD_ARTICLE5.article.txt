# 'Malicious joke' spurs fake story

### JULIE RYAN Editorial staff 
A joke by a Stanford sophomore
has resulted in a newspaper story
which inaccurately portrays a senior
here as a "rich jerk" who lives high
on the hog but receives financial aid
nonetheless, the victin* of the prank
said yesterday.
The Times Tribune will run a cor
rection today on the Feb. 24 front
page story, which quoted senior
Huntley Castner as claiming that he
leads a "comfortable" life at Stanford
while receiving $723 per quarter of
financial aid. Castner, however, said
he never talked to the Times Tribune
reporter who wrote the story; rather.
University officials say sophomore
Andrew Beyer, claiming that he was
Castner, gave the false information to
the reporter.
Castner. who said he gets no finan
cial aid, said virtually every fact about
him in the article was untrue.
The article said Castner receives
$723 per quarter in financial aid,
drives a BMW, goes skiing every
weekend and eats at Ming's or
Mac Arthur Park once a week. It also
said he could "get along fine" without
the aid.
"It made me look like a rich jerk
taking from the University and not
giving them anything."' he said. "The
most ironic thing is that I'm the direc
tor of the Heritage Fund, an organi
zation which raises scholarship
money for students with financial
need.
On Monday, Beyer told The Daily

that he was not involved. "Some
people around did get involved. The
people involved gave really random
names. ... 1 definitely was not one of
them." He said the whole incident
was brought about by "the ridiculous
actions of the press."
Beyer could not be reached for
comment yesterday, after Castner
and Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said Beyer was involved.
Castner said he called the article's
author, Times Tribune reporter Ruth
ann Richter, when he saw the arti
cle. "She wants to correct the error,"
Castner said. "I'm not really satisfied
with a page 37 retraction and I've
asked her to write a new article," he
added.
Richter. who received a master's
degree in journalism from Stanford in
1979, said she interviewed a student
whom she thought was Castner last
week. She said she went to the Delta
Upsilon house looking for one stu
dent. but when he wasn't there she
talked to two other students instead.
"I clearly identified myself," she said.
"I was asking serious questions, and
then I asked for names." It was then,
she said, that the student identified
himself as Castner.
She said she even saw the student
the next day on campus and said that
he gave her his phone number and
they set up a photo session, which the
student missed.
She said that the specificity of the
student's answers, such as using the
