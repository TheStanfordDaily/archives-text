# 'Malicious joke' spurs fake story
## 
### JULIE RYAN Editorial staff 
A joke by a Stanford sophomore
has resulted in a newspaper story
which inaccurately portrays a senior
here as a "rich jerk" who lives high
on the hog but receives financial aid
nonetheless, the victin* of the prank
said yesterday.
The Times Tribune will run a cor
rection today on the Feb. 24 front
page story, which quoted senior
Huntley Castner as claiming that he
leads a "comfortable" life at Stanford
while receiving $723 per quarter of
financial aid. Castner, however, said
he never talked to the Times Tribune
reporter who wrote the story; rather.
University officials say sophomore
Andrew Beyer, claiming that he was
Castner, gave the false information to
the reporter.
Castner. who said he gets no finan
cial aid, said virtually every fact about
him in the article was untrue.
The article said Castner receives
$723 per quarter in financial aid,
drives a BMW, goes skiing every
weekend and eats at Ming's or
Mac Arthur Park once a week. It also
said he could "get along fine" without
the aid.
"It made me look like a rich jerk
taking from the University and not
giving them anything."' he said. "The
most ironic thing is that I'm the direc
tor of the Heritage Fund, an organi
zation which raises scholarship
money for students with financial
need.
On Monday, Beyer told The Daily

that he was not involved. "Some
people around did get involved. The
people involved gave really random
names. ... 1 definitely was not one of
them." He said the whole incident
was brought about by "the ridiculous
actions of the press."
Beyer could not be reached for
comment yesterday, after Castner
and Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said Beyer was involved.
Castner said he called the article's
author, Times Tribune reporter Ruth
ann Richter, when he saw the arti
cle. "She wants to correct the error,"
Castner said. "I'm not really satisfied
with a page 37 retraction and I've
asked her to write a new article," he
added.
Richter. who received a master's
degree in journalism from Stanford in
1979, said she interviewed a student
whom she thought was Castner last
week. She said she went to the Delta
Upsilon house looking for one stu
dent. but when he wasn't there she
talked to two other students instead.
"I clearly identified myself," she said.
"I was asking serious questions, and
then I asked for names." It was then,
she said, that the student identified
himself as Castner.
She said she even saw the student
the next day on campus and said that
he gave her his phone number and
they set up a photo session, which the
student missed.
She said that the specificity of the
student's answers, such as using the
number $723 for the amount he
received every quarter, made his
story "seem quite plausible."
"Stanford has a policy of giving out
no information on which students are
on financial aid," she said, "so basi
cally we had no means of confirming
it."
"I consider it a malicious joke, one
that's not even mildly amusing," she
said. Richter said the incident is dis
turbing because it reflects badly on
the newspaper and on newspapers in
general because "it confirms readers'
suspicions that they can't trust what
they read in newspapers," and be
cause it puts Stanford in a bad light as
well.
Judy Miller, the Times Tribune's
metropolitan editor, said she will
meet with the editor of the paper
today about any further action the
Times Tribune might want to take. "1
think that we'll be talking about com
munication we'll want to make with
people at Stanford or fraternity offi
cials," she said.
University Ombudsman John
Goheen said that Beyer went to the
Ombudsman's office Monday and
talked with Sara Stephenson,
Goheen's assistant. Goheen said
Stephenson sent Beyer to talk to
Lyons.
Lyons said both Castner and Beyer
talked with him about the incident.
He said he is planning to call the

reporter about it. "When you read
the story it's almost prototypical
foolishness," he said. "1 know enough
about financial aid to know that's not
normal. People get financial aid be
cause parents can't make it up."
Lyons called Beyer's story a
"prank" and said that he did not
foresee taking any action against
Beyer. "He doesn't need any
reminder of the bad outcome," Lyons
said. "Andy was very forthcoming.
He felt lousy about the whole thing."
Castner went through the Times
Tribune story last night and pointed
out its errors. He said, "My name is
spelled with a C not a K, my dad's not
a tax attorney, I'm not on financial
aid, I don't have a brother and my
mom doesn't go to college. I drive a
beat-up station wagon and not a
BMW, I've only been to Ming's once
and Mac Arthur Park once ... my
lifestyle doesn't cost $1,000 per quar
ter and I'm not going to Hawaii for
spring break. My parents don't know
that, so I guess that's the only part of
the article that's true."
The story also identified Castner as
a sophomore and a member of the
DU fraternity, though he is actually a
senior and a member of Phi Delta
Theta.
Castner said that he is concerned
about the effect of the story on his
reputation. "I'm interviewing with a
lot of firms in the Bay Area," he said,
"and they would probably think I was
a jerk because of what the article
connoted."

"I consider it a malicious joke, one
that's not even mildly amusing," she
said. Richter said the incident is dis
turbing because it reflects badly on
the newspaper and on newspapers in
general because "it confirms readers'
suspicions that they can't trust what
they read in newspapers," and be
cause it puts Stanford in a bad light as
well.
Judy Miller, the Times Tribune's
metropolitan editor, said she will
meet with the editor of the paper
today about any further action the
Times Tribune might want to take. "1
think that we'll be talking about com
munication we'll want to make with
people at Stanford or fraternity offi
cials," she said.
University Ombudsman John
Goheen said that Beyer went to the
Ombudsman's office Monday and
talked with Sara Stephenson,
Goheen's assistant. Goheen said
Stephenson sent Beyer to talk to
Lyons.
Lyons said both Castner and Beyer
talked with him about the incident.
He said he is planning to call the

reporter about it. "When you read
the story it's almost prototypical
foolishness," he said. "1 know enough
about financial aid to know that's not
normal. People get financial aid be
cause parents can't make it up."
Lyons called Beyer's story a
"prank" and said that he did not
foresee taking any action against
Beyer. "He doesn't need any
reminder of the bad outcome," Lyons
said. "Andy was very forthcoming.
He felt lousy about the whole thing."
Castner went through the Times
Tribune story last night and pointed
out its errors. He said, "My name is
spelled with a C not a K, my dad's not
a tax attorney, I'm not on financial
aid, I don't have a brother and my
mom doesn't go to college. I drive a
beat-up station wagon and not a
BMW, I've only been to Ming's once
and Mac Arthur Park once ... my
lifestyle doesn't cost $1,000 per quar
ter and I'm not going to Hawaii for
spring break. My parents don't know
that, so I guess that's the only part of
the article that's true."
The story also identified Castner as
a sophomore and a member of the
DU fraternity, though he is actually a
senior and a member of Phi Delta
Theta.
Castner said that he is concerned
about the effect of the story on his
reputation. "I'm interviewing with a
lot of firms in the Bay Area," he said,
"and they would probably think I was
a jerk because of what the article
connoted."
A joke by a Stanford sophomore
has resulted in a newspaper story
which inaccurately portrays a senior
here as a "rich jerk" who lives high
on the hog but receives financial aid
nonetheless, the victin* of the prank
said yesterday.
The Times Tribune will run a cor
rection today on the Feb. 24 front
page story, which quoted senior
Huntley Castner as claiming that he
leads a "comfortable" life at Stanford
while receiving $723 per quarter of
financial aid. Castner, however, said
he never talked to the Times Tribune
reporter who wrote the story; rather.
University officials say sophomore
Andrew Beyer, claiming that he was
Castner, gave the false information to
the reporter.
Castner. who said he gets no finan
cial aid, said virtually every fact about
him in the article was untrue.
The article said Castner receives
$723 per quarter in financial aid,
drives a BMW, goes skiing every
weekend and eats at Ming's or
Mac Arthur Park once a week. It also
said he could "get along fine" without
the aid.
"It made me look like a rich jerk
taking from the University and not
giving them anything."' he said. "The
most ironic thing is that I'm the direc
tor of the Heritage Fund, an organi
zation which raises scholarship
money for students with financial
need.
On Monday, Beyer told The Daily

that he was not involved. "Some
people around did get involved. The
people involved gave really random
names. ... 1 definitely was not one of
them." He said the whole incident
was brought about by "the ridiculous
actions of the press."
Beyer could not be reached for
comment yesterday, after Castner
and Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said Beyer was involved.
Castner said he called the article's
author, Times Tribune reporter Ruth
ann Richter, when he saw the arti
cle. "She wants to correct the error,"
Castner said. "I'm not really satisfied
with a page 37 retraction and I've
asked her to write a new article," he
added.
Richter. who received a master's
degree in journalism from Stanford in
1979, said she interviewed a student
whom she thought was Castner last
week. She said she went to the Delta
Upsilon house looking for one stu
dent. but when he wasn't there she
talked to two other students instead.
"I clearly identified myself," she said.
"I was asking serious questions, and
then I asked for names." It was then,
she said, that the student identified
himself as Castner.
She said she even saw the student
the next day on campus and said that
he gave her his phone number and
they set up a photo session, which the
student missed.
She said that the specificity of the
student's answers, such as using the
number $723 for the amount he
received every quarter, made his
story "seem quite plausible."
"Stanford has a policy of giving out
no information on which students are
on financial aid," she said, "so basi
cally we had no means of confirming
it."
"I consider it a malicious joke, one
that's not even mildly amusing," she
said. Richter said the incident is dis
turbing because it reflects badly on
the newspaper and on newspapers in
general because "it confirms readers'
suspicions that they can't trust what
they read in newspapers," and be
cause it puts Stanford in a bad light as
well.
