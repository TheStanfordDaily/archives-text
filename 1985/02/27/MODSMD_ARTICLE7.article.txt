New Zealand leader sees U.S. chill
LOS ANGELES — The Reagun administration intends to "scale
down" its cooperation with New Zealand on defense and intelligence in
retaliation for its banning U.S. nuclear ships from its harbors, Prime
Minister David Lange said yesterday.
Lange said he was shown a series of measures limiting cooperation by
a top State Department official. He called the measures serious and
damaging. -
"Those measures relate primarily*to the intelligence-sharing and
defense fields," Lange said at a news conference. "They amount, in ef
fect, to a drastic scaling down of cooperation with New Zealand in those
areas."
"They are not, in my view, the kind of actions which a great power
should take against a small, loyal ally," added Lange.
Reagan administration officials have blasted Lange's recent decision
to ban U.S. nuclear-powered ships and those carrying nuclear weapons,
saying the action threatens the military alliance between the United
States, New Zealand and Australia, known as ANZUS.
But Lange let it be known before meeting Brown that he intended to
hold fast to his country's stance.
In Washington, the State Department said Brown's remarks would be
the only public response to Lange.
Report says Nicaragua not a threat
WASHINGTON — A report on Central America's military balance,
co-authored by a former CIA analyst, concludes that Nicaragua's leftist
government has bolstered its armed forces to defend against a feared
U.S. attack, not to invade neighboring countries.
"The truth is that the only Central American nation in danger of an
invasion by regular forces is Nicaragua," said the 28-page report
released yesterday by a private group that has been critical of President
Reagan's Latin American policies. "The only nation likely to do that is
the United States.
"Nicaragua believes that the most important deterrent it possesses
against that threat is a level of modern armament sufficient to inflict se
vere casualties on an attacking U.S. force."
The Reagan administration has charged repeatedly that Nicaragua's
military build-up, supported by the Soviet Union and its allies, is a threat
to other Central American countries and indirectly to U.S. national se
curity.
The report, challenging that assumption, was written by former CIA
analyst David Mac Michael and Colin Danby and Franz Schneiderman,
two researchers for the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, which released
the study. *
Mac Michael was an analyst under contract to the CIA from 1981 to
1983 and left after disputing U.S. allegations that Nicaragua's Sandinista
government was shipping large stocks of weapons to leftist guerrillas in
El Salvador. Mac Michael, who went public with his dispute in June
1984, claimed that evidence of a significant weapons flow "just disap
peared" after the spring of 1981.
Administration officials, however, insisted that the evidence of
Nicaraguan complicity was convincing, and Secretary of State George
Shultz said Mac Michael "must be living in some other world."
Asked about the new report yesterday, a State Department official,
who insisted on anonymity, said that even if Nicaragua does not invade
neighboring countries, its build-up ailows the leftist regime to back sub
version and to "effectively blackmail" weaker countries into making
concessions.

Israel tightens 'iron fist' policy
JERUSALEM —- The Israeli army imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew
on villages throughout much of southern Lebanon on yesterday as it in
tensified the new "iron fist" policy aimed at curbing resistance to its con
tinued occupation of the region.
The army also announced in leaflets dropped by helicopter on villages
south of the Litani River that it is forbidden to travel in the area by
motorcycle or alone in any vehicle. Any car found unattended by the
roadside will be immediately blown up, the leaflets added.
In Jerusalem, meanwhile, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin told
the Knesset (Parliament) Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee that
since the new "iron fist" policy was instituted a week ago, 15 Lebanese
have been killed, 22 wounded, and 19 expelled from the area still under
Israeli control. He described those killed and wounded as "terrorists"
and said those deported had incited local residents against the Israeli
defense forces.
Israel completed the first stage of a planned three-phase withdrawal
from Lebanon on Feb. 17, but up to 20,000 of its troops continue to oc
cupy nearly one-fourth of the country.
The army intensified actions against hostile, mostly Shia Muslim,
villages in southern Lebanon last week after a spate of guerrilla attacks
that left seven Israeli soldiers dead and about 20 wounded in one 10-day
period earlier this month. It has raided about a dozen villages since the
new policy went into effect and arrested more than 150 local residents.
Gromyko urges Italy to oppose U.S.
ROME — Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko attempted yes
terday to drive a wedge between the United States and one of its closest
North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies by asking Italy to oppose Pres
ident Reagan's "Star Wars" strategic defense initiative.
Warning that the U.S. administration is made up of "people who, like
sleepwalkers, proceed obliviously to the brink of the abyss," Gromyko
asked Italians to "raise their voice against the take-off of the arms race
towards outer space."
In luncheon remarks devoted almost entirely to the forthcoming re
sumption of U.S.-Soviet arms talks in Geneva, Switzerland, Gromyko
also warned Italy and other NATO nations of their responsibility for
permitting American cruise and Pershing 2 missiles to be deployed on
their territories, the issue that precipitated a Soviet walkout from arms
talks in November 1983.
But the Soviet foreign minister's warnings, which came in the midst of
a full day of talks with Italian leaders, apparently left his hosts
unimpressed.
Italian Foreign Minister Giulio Andreotti, who had just completed al
most three hours of talks with Gromyko, replied at the luncheon that
Italy's decision to base American cruise missiles in Sicily was
"responsibly taken ... in order to rebalance the vastly uneven nuclear
forces of Europe" of which the Soviets have a heavy preponderance.
Although he skirted the "Star Wars" issue, on which Italy has so far
taken an equivocal position, Andreotti expressed the diplomatic hope
for an American-Soviet agreement at the resumed Geneva talks, which
begin March 12, that would end the arms race in space as well as on
Earth.
Pakistan returns to democracy?
ISLAMABAD. Pakistan — Pakistan's first national election in seven
years has moved the country closer to a restoration of democracy, but
also has posed for President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq formidable risks
when he fulfills his pledge to lift martial law, U.S. Ambassador Deane
Hinton said yesterday.
Hinton. in an interview following Zia's victory Monday over an oppo
sition boycott of the parliamentary elections he called, said that if mar
tial law is lifted, it would be a "big plus" in making Pakistan more
palatable to congressional and other U.S. critics of massive aid to what
the United States sees as the frontline bulwark against Soviet expan
sionism in the region.
But, he cautioned, Pakistan's history of political instability, coupled
with an inexperienced parliament and a gradually deteriorating eco
nomic situation, could strain a new civilian administration to the break
ing point.
Hinton's comments came as a boycott of the National Assembly elec
tion called by the 11-party opposition coalition, the Movement for the
Restoration of Democracy, collapsed under a surprisingly high voter
turnout by Pakistanis who had not been able to vote during more than
seven years of martial-law rule after Zia overthrew the popularly elected
government of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in July 1977.
