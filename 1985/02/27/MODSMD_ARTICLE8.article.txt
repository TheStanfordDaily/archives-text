# Reagan campaigns for MX
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — President Reagan launched
a new campaign yesterday to obtain funding for
more MX missiles, declaring that continued con
gressional support of the nuclear weapons system is
vital to the "pace and quality" of upcoming U.S.-
Soviet arms negotiations.
"I have no idea whether we can achieve an arms
control agreement even if we move forward with
the MX — but I'm utterly convinced that we cannot
get a sound agreement without it," Reagan told the
Senate Armed Services and Appropriations com
mittees during a late afternoon meeting at the
White House.
That private session capped a day of all-out lob
bying for the 10-warhead MX by both Reagan and
his top advisers.
Reagan also appealed personally to Republican
congressional leaders for MX funds while Secretary
of State George Shultz and Secretary of Defense
Caspar Weinberger made a rare joint appearance
on Capitol Hill before the Senate Armed Services
Committee on behalf of the weapon.

"This is no time to cast doubt on our national
resolve," Shultz admonished committee members.
Max Kampelman, Reagan's chief arms
negotiator, also took up the cause in the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, asserting: "It would
be damaging to our negotiating position were the
Congress not to fund the MX. As a negotiator, I
would like to have as much on my side of the table
as is practical, responsible and reasonable."
Reagan's uphill, four-year battle to build an ar
senal of 100 intercontinental MX missiles clearly
was being given a boost by the coincidental timing
of the resumption of U.S.-Soviet arms talks in
Geneva March 12, to be followed a week or two
later by the long-ago scheduled congressional
voting on MX funds.
"The president strongly believes that the pace
and quality of the negotiations in Geneva will be
related to the outcome of the MX vote," White
House spokesman Larry Speakes said, presenting
the administration's current principal argument for
continuing the controversial missile program.

The amount ot money being sought is $1.5 bil
lion, to be spent during the current fiscal year.
Reagan is also asking for $4 billion to build 48
more MX missiles during fisca' 1986, which begins
Oct. 1.
"The $1.5 billion is going to be very hard to get.
And until we get that, we're not even thinking
about the other 48 missiles," said one White House
official, who asked not to be identified.
Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-Kan.)
cautiously predicted after a meeting with Reagan
that the $ 1.5 billion would be approved by the Sen
ate. He noted that a dozen senators, as well as
several House members, were going to Geneva to
observe the start of arms talks and added: "I would
hope we'd come back then and let the negotiators
decide what to offer on the table and not take it off
ourselves."
But House Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill (D-
Mass.) said yesterday that Reagan did not have the
votes yet in his chamber. And he called the MX "a
piece of equipment we don't need."
