LOS ANGELES â€” Sultry soul
singer Tina Turner, whose sinewy
body and husky voice helped make
her album "Private Dancer" a come
back smash, won three Grammy
awards last night, including record of
the year and best female pop vocalist.
Best remembered as the high
voltage shimmy dance partner of
former husband Ike in the 19605,
Turner also won best female rock
vocalist for her song, "Better Be
Good to Me."
The gutsy "What's Love Got to Do
With It," written by Graham Lyle
and Terry Britten and recorded by
Turner, was named song of the year
and record of the year.
Veteran songwriter and singer
Lionel Richie's "Can't Slow Down,"
a slick melange of pop ballads and
easy dance tunes, was named album
of the year at the more than three
hour show, which televised live from
the Shrine Auditorium to an esti
mated audience of 140 million
worldwide.
"It was a bit of a shock, I must
say," the 43-year-old Turner said
backstage after winning record of the
year. Her last Grammy was with Ike
for their version of "Proud Mary."
Richie, who also shared the
producer of the year award with
David Foster, said he was surprised to
v,in. "You never know how it's going
to turn out," he said. "It's really a
sweet, sweet feeling."

At last year's awards of the Na
tional Academy of Recording Arts
and Sciences, superstar Michael Jack
son won a record eight awards and
dominated the show. No one came
close this year.
Cyndi Lauper, the unruly rocker
with carrot-colored hair and flea mar
ket clothes, was honored as best new
artist of the year.
Prince, the reclusive superstar of
the hit summer movie "Purple Rain,"
won or shared three awards.
Prince and his band, the Revolu
tion, won best rock performance by a
duo with vocal for the "Purple Rain"
LP. The group also won for best al
bum of original score written for a
motion picture or TV special for the
album, which was the soundtrack for
the hit summer movie. The album
sold 9 million copies.
The 26-year-old Minneapolis
rocker whose raunchy concert gyra
tions contrast sharply with an intense
offstage privacy also won for writing
the best rhythm and blues song, "I
Feel For You." The song was re
corded by Chaka Khan, who was
named best female rhythm and blues
artist.
Blue-collar rocker Bruce
Springsteen, who had never won a
Grammy despite his decade-long
leadership in American rock music,
won his first award as best rock male
vocalist for his sensuous "Dancing in
the Dark."
