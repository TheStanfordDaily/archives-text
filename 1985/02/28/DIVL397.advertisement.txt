What's better than sitting in the sun
sipping lemonade? Why, sitting in the
sun sipping lemonade and reading your
letter to the editor in The Daily, of
course. So take a break from the heat;
go inside and type a letter and send it to
The Stanford Daily, Storke Publications
Building, Stanford, CA 94305. Then
grab that glass of lemonade and head
back outside. You'll be bagging rays
again in no time at all.
