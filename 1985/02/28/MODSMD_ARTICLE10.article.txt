# Congress passes farm-relief bills
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The House
and Senate, ignoring the wishes of
President Reagan, endorsed sepa
rate legislation yesterday to pro
vide credit-poor farmers with
federal loan money in time for
spring planting.
By 54-45, the Republican
controlled Senate approved a
measure that would provide $100
million to "buy down" interest
rates for farmers who have ex
hausted their loan sources. It later
also approved, 50-48, legislation
to give farmers immediate ad
vances on crop loans that normally
would not come until harvest.
At the same time, the
Democrat-dominated House
voted 318-103 for a bill, similar to
one of the Senate amendments,
offering advances of up to 50 per
cent of next fall's price-support
loans to farmers unable to get
loans to plant this spring. That
measure was sponsored by Rep.
Tom Daschle (D-S.D).
The Senate amendments were
tacked onto a bill offering $175
million in non-food aid for
drought-ravaged African
countries, similar to one passed by
the House. The House credit bill
still must go to the Senate for a
vote.
Senate Majority Leader Robert
Dole (R-Kan.) predicted the
amendments passed over his op
position are "never going to
become law" and administration
officials said Reagan might veto

the bill.
After the action on the first
amendment. Deputy White House
Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater,
expressing disappointment at the
outcome of the Senate vote, said:
"In all likelihood, we'll veto" the
bill if it reaches Reagan with the
amendment still attached.
The spokesman said the admin
istration remains "steadfast in the
belief there is a program out there
that should be utilized."
"The old coalition comes back
when a segment of the nation gets
in problems," House Speaker
Thomas O'Neill (D-Mass.) said of
the House effort to help farmers.
The White House had lobbied
against any changes in federal
credit help for farmers. The ad
ministration is rushing to put in
place its own much-modified loan
guarantee program, which Presi
dent Reagan contends is adequate
to save those farmers with the best
chance of long-term survival.
As senators backing the farm
credit changes sensed growing
support for their amendments,
Dole said new legislation would
only cause delays in implementing
any credit program, and"the
farmer's not going to know what
he can do."
The vote had been seen as so
close that Vice President George
Bush had delayed a scheduled trip
to Texas to be present in the Sen
ate in case his vote were needed to
break a tie.
