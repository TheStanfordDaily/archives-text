No U.S. intervention
WASHINGTON — Americans oppose by al
most 4 to 1 any U.S. involvement in attempts to
overthrow the leftist government of Nicaragua, a
new nationwide Washington Post-ABC News
poll has found.
In the survey, conducted Friday through Tues
day, 70 percent said they oppose U.S. involve
ment in efforts to topple the Nicaraguan govern
ment, 18 percent said they favor it, and 12 per
cent expressed no opinion.
On other issues:
• More than three out of every five interviewed
judged that the average farmer is worse off finan
cialFy than most Americans, and four of five think
the government should extend to farmers at least
as much special aid as the administration is
proposing.
• One of every three interviewed said an immedi

ate family member will be affected if the adminis
tration succeeds in cutting back loans to middle
income college students. Among that third, ore
in three said the result would be abandonment of
plans to attend college.
• Citizens are sharply divided over the designa
tion of Edwin Meese 111 as attorney general, with
43 percent saying they disapprove, 38 percent
saying they approve, and 19 percent expressing
no view. Meese was confirmed by the Senate Sat
urday, 63 to 31, with all the "no" votes coming
from Democrats.
