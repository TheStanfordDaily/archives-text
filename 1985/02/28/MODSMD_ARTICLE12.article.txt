Bradley wants clean air
LOS ANGELES — Mayor Tom Bradley pro
posed reducing inhalable pollutants in the city by
one-third yesterday and threatened to slap a 13-
cent-a-gallon tax on "dirty" diesel fuel if neces
sary to get the job done.
"We are prepared to use the city's taxing au
thority to force refineries to clean up the fuels if
the state Air Resources Board and the federal
Environmental Protection Agency don't act,"
said the mayor, who is seeking election to a
fourth term.
Diesel fuel is a major cause of airborne pollu
tants, he said.
He noted that diesel vehicles now are exempt
from mandatory annual smog checks that other
cars and trucks must undergo and that half the

dicsel fuel used in the city is produced by small
independent refineries that are exempt from
some pollution rules.
Bradley said the "dirty" diesel fuel produced
by those small refineries creates more pollutants
but is widely used because it sells for about 13
cents a gallon less than cleaner diesel fuel
produced by major refineries that must adhere to
smog rules.
The mayor said his plan would reduce in
halable pollutants by 33 percent and improve
visibility by 10 percent.
Bradley's plan calls for:
• Ending the smog-rule exemption for small
refiners immediately;
•Setting comprehensive anti-pollution rules for
all refiners by May 1985;

• Enacting state legislation to require that diesel
vehicles undergo mandatory smog checks;
• Resisting any attempt by the EPA to back away
from strict anti-pollution rules for heavy trucks
involved in interstate commerce and hence
governed by federal instead of local authorities;
• Imposing the special tax on small refiners if
state and federal officials don't act;
• Directing city agencies to buy only "clean" die
sel fuel;
