## Students, employees urge support for Coffee House 
### JEANNE COOPER 
Council of Presidents member
Todd Kerr does not care for the idea
of a large food-service corporation
running the Coffee House. "The at
mosphere would be a lot different if a
company like Servomation would be
there. I couldn't say it would turn im
mediately into a pink-and-green
vinyl Sambo's pancake palace, but
the fact is that now students know
that they own the Coffee House, and
the philosophy of the Coffee House is
based on that."
Of course, his concern may stem
from his position as chairman of the
Coffee House's Board of Directors, a
management responsibility that
would most likely be unavailable to
students should the ASSU lose its

'I get coffee here and I study here. I
like the intimate atmosphere the way
it is; we don't really want two
Tresidders.'

contract with Tresidder Union in up
coming bidding.
Nevertheless, members of the stu
dent clientele have also expressed
concern that the Coffee House's am
biance might suffer if the manage
ment changes hands. Oriana Elia, a
senior living off campus, says she uses
the Coffee House as a hangout when
she doesn't have classes.
"I get coffee here and I study here.
1 like the intimate atmosphere the
way it is; we don't really want two
Tresidders," she said, refering to the
concessions in Tresidder Union
operated by Servomation, Inc.
Larry Wertman, a graduate student
in industrial engineering, agrees that
the Coffee House serves a different
purpose than the other Tresidder
concessions. "This is warmer," he
said. "Tresidder is better for some
types of studying: Because of the
music, you can't do all of your study

ing here, but the main thing is it's
more relaxing than Tresidder."
The Coffee House's "nice atmo
sphere," according to Wertman, may
be even more valuable because of its
rarity. "There aren't too many places
off campus that duplicate it, as there
are in Berkeley or other universities
that I visited."
English graduate student Liz Davis
likes the current Coffee House set-up
but doesn't foresee alterations in am
biance should management change.
"They've got a successful mode of
operation for the clientele; I don't see
why they would change it too much,"
she said.
Student employees and supporters,
however, have convinced nearly
1,000 members of the Stanford com

munity that ASSU management is
best, according to Coffee House Pres
ident Mark Thornburgh. Thornburgh
initiated a petition drive with Kerr
last week to show Tresidder Union
that student customers' concern for
the restaurant justifies "any extra ef
fort" Tresidder may have in dealing
with student management. Students
have circulated the petitions at dorm
meetings, in classes and in White
Plaza "because they care about the
Coffee House," Thornburgh said. "I
sat out in White Plaza (Monday) and
got some good responses; there was
some discussion, but it was mostly a
positive experience."
Coffee House officers freely dis
cuss the "extra effort" their manage
ment entails. "We're competing
against huge national corporations
with a lot of depth; we're mostly all
students," Kerr said. "Servomation
can call George Smith or Tim Brown
and tell them, 'You're moving up to

assistant manager' and there's no
problem shipping them over when
times get tough, if a manager gets
killed or something.
"If something happened to
(professional operational manager)
Gary Versani, who's been great, we
would have a hard time. It happened
this summer for a few weeks. Al
though the students did well, it's diffi
cult and frightening," Kerr said.
Mary Woten, one of six shift
managers and a senior in her fifth
quarter at the Coffee House, noted
that students have a bad image as ad
ministrators. "I can understand that

Tresidder would be worried, since
students have a reputation for being
flaky and willing to blow off work for
classes instead of having a strict cor
porate structure."
Nevertheless, Woten feels that at
Stanford the reputation is un
deserved. "Gary (Versani) told us
Saturday that he had worked ... in
Stockton and at Cal, and Stanford has
been the only place where he can go
home at 4:30 p.m. and know that
everything will run great and be intact
in the morning."
The Coffee House keeps 60 to 70
part-time student employees in its

hire, in addition to Versani and four
full-time employees, creating difficul
ties most corporations would avoid,
Kerr said. But Woten compares the
situation to that of admissions at
Stanford.
"The Coffee House purposely
looks for the problems of training and
putting so many people on the
payroll. When looking at academics
in it students, Stanford Admissions
always says they don't go for all the
perfect students but for diversity.
Tresidder should do the same," she
said.
Shift Manager Daniel Rosen, also a
senior working his fifth quarter at the
Coffee House, says student
"ownership" through the ASSU leads
to an increased sense of responsibility

on the part of student workers. "It's a
bit like cleaning your own kitchen:
you do it well because you live there.
If it's someone else's you may leave
some of it to be cleaned later."
Kerr predicted that student em
ployment would be reduced drasti
cally at all levels in the Coffee House
if an outside company took over. "A
lot of corporations would not want
the hassles of 60 to 70 students on
their payroll; they want nine or 10
full employees who do their jobs
methodically and get out." He
believes that "having students around
and staffing it affects how students
see the Coffee House."
Thornburgh and Woten also think
student workers contribute to the
Coffee House's atmosphere. Accord
ing to Thornburgh, "Students are en
ergetic, keyed up, psyched; they care
about their jobs and are more attuned
to customers' needs more than a per
son who does it 40 hours a week for

three years. Their short shifts are
more like a study break than a chore
for them."
Woten commented, "Students add
a lot to the atmosphere. You can
come in and talk to them behind the
counter. You see them in your classes
or at the movies; you have some kind
of rapport or relationship with them
that you can't with someone who goes
to work just for the $5 an hour."
Besides the benefits to the custom
ers, student management offers
valuable experiences to the managers
themselves. "The leadership oppor
tunities are incredible," Thornburgh
said. "I learned a lot about myself
and how to deal with other people.
Especially if you're a supervisor or
shift manager, it's up to you to make

that place run."
Of the part-time employees, ap
proximately 20 students are super
visors aside from the six managers.
Students serve as program and mar
keting coordinators and sit on the
board of directors. "All you have to
do is go next door and look at the
(Union) Crossroads. Employees
never go any further up in the
hierarchy. Here students have the op
portunity to move up and take more
responsibility instead of just doing
duties," Woten said.
She elaborated, "Once you get to
know the place, if you wish to you can
recognize things that need to be
done; those people who do can then
become managers ... at the end of
each quarter we make nominations
for people to move up to supervisors
and then to managers if they've
shown a lot of initiation and feelings
for the Coffee House and they're very
responsible."

Council of Presidents member
Todd Kerr does not care for the idea
of a large food-service corporation
running the Coffee House. "The at
mosphere would be a lot different if a
company like Servomation would be
there. I couldn't say it would turn im
mediately into a pink-and-green
vinyl Sambo's pancake palace, but
the fact is that now students know
that they own the Coffee House, and
the philosophy of the Coffee House is
based on that."
Of course, his concern may stem
from his position as chairman of the
Coffee House's Board of Directors, a
management responsibility that
would most likely be unavailable to
students should the ASSU lose its

contract with Tresidder Union in up
coming bidding.
Nevertheless, members of the stu
dent clientele have also expressed
concern that the Coffee House's am
biance might suffer if the manage
ment changes hands. Oriana Elia, a
senior living off campus, says she uses
the Coffee House as a hangout when
she doesn't have classes.
"I get coffee here and I study here.

concessions in Tresidder Union
operated by Servomation, Inc.
Larry Wertman, a graduate student
in industrial engineering, agrees that
the Coffee House serves a different
purpose than the other Tresidder
concessions. "This is warmer," he
said. "Tresidder is better for some
types of studying: Because of the
music, you can't do all of your study

ing here, but the main thing is it's
more relaxing than Tresidder."
The Coffee House's "nice atmo
sphere," according to Wertman, may
be even more valuable because of its
rarity. "There aren't too many places
off campus that duplicate it, as there
are in Berkeley or other universities
that I visited."
English graduate student Liz Davis
likes the current Coffee House set-up
but doesn't foresee alterations in am
biance should management change.
"They've got a successful mode of
operation for the clientele; I don't see
why they would change it too much,"
she said.
Student employees and supporters,
however, have convinced nearly
1,000 members of the Stanford com

munity that ASSU management is
best, according to Coffee House Pres
ident Mark Thornburgh. Thornburgh
initiated a petition drive with Kerr
last week to show Tresidder Union
that student customers' concern for
the restaurant justifies "any extra ef
fort" Tresidder may have in dealing
with student management. Students
have circulated the petitions at dorm
meetings, in classes and in White
Plaza "because they care about the
Coffee House," Thornburgh said. "I
sat out in White Plaza (Monday) and
got some good responses; there was
some discussion, but it was mostly a
positive experience."
Coffee House officers freely dis
cuss the "extra effort" their manage
ment entails. "We're competing
against huge national corporations
with a lot of depth; we're mostly all
students," Kerr said. "Servomation
can call George Smith or Tim Brown
and tell them, 'You're moving up to

assistant manager' and there's no
problem shipping them over when
times get tough, if a manager gets
killed or something.
"If something happened to
(professional operational manager)
Gary Versani, who's been great, we
would have a hard time. It happened
this summer for a few weeks. Al
though the students did well, it's diffi
cult and frightening," Kerr said.
Mary Woten, one of six shift
managers and a senior in her fifth
quarter at the Coffee House, noted
that students have a bad image as ad
ministrators. "I can understand that

Tresidder would be worried, since
students have a reputation for being
flaky and willing to blow off work for
classes instead of having a strict cor
porate structure."
Nevertheless, Woten feels that at
Stanford the reputation is un
deserved. "Gary (Versani) told us
Saturday that he had worked ... in
Stockton and at Cal, and Stanford has
been the only place where he can go
home at 4:30 p.m. and know that
everything will run great and be intact
in the morning."
The Coffee House keeps 60 to 70
part-time student employees in its

hire, in addition to Versani and four
full-time employees, creating difficul
ties most corporations would avoid,
Kerr said. But Woten compares the
situation to that of admissions at
Stanford.
"The Coffee House purposely
looks for the problems of training and
putting so many people on the
payroll. When looking at academics
in it students, Stanford Admissions
always says they don't go for all the
perfect students but for diversity.
Tresidder should do the same," she
said.
Shift Manager Daniel Rosen, also a
senior working his fifth quarter at the

"ownership" through the ASSU leads

on the part of student workers. "It's a
bit like cleaning your own kitchen:
you do it well because you live there.
If it's someone else's you may leave
some of it to be cleaned later."
Kerr predicted that student em
ployment would be reduced drasti
cally at all levels in the Coffee House
if an outside company took over. "A
lot of corporations would not want
the hassles of 60 to 70 students on
their payroll; they want nine or 10
full employees who do their jobs
methodically and get out." He
believes that "having students around
and staffing it affects how students
see the Coffee House."
Thornburgh and Woten also think
student workers contribute to the
Coffee House's atmosphere. Accord
ing to Thornburgh, "Students are en
ergetic, keyed up, psyched; they care
about their jobs and are more attuned
to customers' needs more than a per
son who does it 40 hours a week for

three years. Their short shifts are
more like a study break than a chore
for them."
Woten commented, "Students add
a lot to the atmosphere. You can
come in and talk to them behind the
counter. You see them in your classes
or at the movies; you have some kind
of rapport or relationship with them
that you can't with someone who goes
to work just for the $5 an hour."
Besides the benefits to the custom
ers, student management offers
valuable experiences to the managers
themselves. "The leadership oppor
tunities are incredible," Thornburgh
said. "I learned a lot about myself
and how to deal with other people.
Especially if you're a supervisor or
shift manager, it's up to you to make

that place run."
Of the part-time employees, ap
proximately 20 students are super
visors aside from the six managers.
Students serve as program and mar
keting coordinators and sit on the
board of directors. "All you have to
do is go next door and look at the
(Union) Crossroads. Employees
never go any further up in the
hierarchy. Here students have the op
portunity to move up and take more
responsibility instead of just doing
duties," Woten said.
She elaborated, "Once you get to

said. "I learned a lot about myself
and how to deal with other people.
Especially if you're a supervisor or
shift manager, it's up to you to make

that place run."
Of the part-time employees, ap
proximately 20 students are super
visors aside from the six managers.
Students serve as program and mar
keting coordinators and sit on the
board of directors. "All you have to
do is go next door and look at the
(Union) Crossroads. Employees
never go any further up in the
hierarchy. Here students have the op
portunity to move up and take more
responsibility instead of just doing
duties," Woten said.
She elaborated, "Once you get to
know the place, if you wish to you can
recognize things that need to be
done; those people who do can then
become managers ... at the end of
each quarter we make nominations
for people to move up to supervisors
and then to managers if they've
shown a lot of initiation and feelings
for the Coffee House and they're very
responsible."
