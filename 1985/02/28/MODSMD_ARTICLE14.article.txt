## The 						Stanford Daily Increasing frosh choice 
### 
A recent recommendation by a Residential
Education subcommittee to increase the amount
of all-freshman housing on campus has sparked
debate on the merits of all-freshman residences
versus four-class dormitories. Proponents of both
living arrangements cite good reasons for fresh
men to live in their preferred setting.
On the all-frosh dorm side, the argument is
that freshmen should develop a sense of unity
with their class. Freshman dorms foster that unity
and offer a degree of spirit and enthusiasm not
found in any other residences on campus. In ad
dition, freshmen have similar concerns and often
take the same classes — most notably Western
Culture — and thus may share thoughts and ideas
that are of less interest to upperclassmen.
On the four-class dorm side, the argument is
that freshmen should be exposed to upperclass
men, not just to freshmen, so that they meet a
diverse group of individuals and receive a wide
array of views. Four-class dorms provide the bet
ter opportunity for freshmen to grow and learn.
In addition, freshmen may benefit from interac
tion with upperclassmen who once had freshman
concerns — they all took Western Culture, too —
and now have perspective to add to their fresh
man experience.
Both arguments are sound, yet debatable. The
all-frosh dorm will usually foster unity, but is this

type of bonding, and often insulation, desirable?
The four-class dorm does include residents with
greater perspective on the freshmen experience,
but does this added perspective translate into
constructive dialogue or cynicism and apathy?
There are no clear-cut answers. But there's an
office — Residential Education — that has the
responsibility of deciding how many all-freshman
dorms to maintain. The decision should not be
made by this office.
Given that there are no correct answers, only
one fair decision-making method is available: Let
the incoming freshmen hear the arguments on
both sides and decide for themselves which living
arrangement is best for them.
Under the current system, incoming freshmen
request a form of housing and usually, but not al
ways, receive what they request. The reason
some do not get their first choice is that, in recent
years, more freshmen have asked to live in all
frosh dorms than the University's all-frosh dorms
can accommodate. Increasing the University's
supply of all-frosh housing to meet the excess
demand from incoming freshmen would rectify
the situation. Continuing in future years to use
demand as the criterion for determining supply
would place this important housing decision in
the proper hands.
