# Take some of Stanford with you to the 'real world'
## 
### 
Stanford students — especially the cynical
ones, like myself — like to complain every
once in awhile about how university life, uni
versity concerns and even university educa
tion are far removed from and little resemble
the demands and pressures of the "real
world." We grumble about it a little more
with each successive year. The euphoria of
freshman year dwindles, the monotony and
disillusionment that often accompany
familiarity mount, and maturity (or some
semblance of it) seems to beckon us toward
things beyond the bounds of the lecture hall.
At times, after several hours feverishly
memorizing facts and figures, we wonder
sourly where on earth we will ever encounter
a situation outside a college campus in which
we'll be required to spew out loads of infor
mation onto the pages of a little blue book.
Sometimes it's difficult to imagine what is
more inane than spending one's day sitting in
chairs with half-desks, listening to someone
talk while you paraphrase his or her words on
notebook paper. We realize that we won't re
member much of what we're taking notes on
even if we/want to, just as we realize that the
midterm we agonize over today will be forgot
ten tomorrow. The sense of immediacy we
bring to a problem set pales in comparison to
the broad responsibilities of adulthood. Even
when we're less than intense, the quality of

our nonchalance is markedly different from
that of the real world. We look around and
see people lying in the sun reading
Nietzsche, getting into heated discussions

about relationships while eating fro-yo, and
placing a backpack full of books they won't
read into the trunk of a Tahoe-bound rented
car. We all know that this isn't real; it's sur
real.
Or so we believe. Indeed, it is true that the
real world offers most of us a more meaning
ful (or more lucrative, take your pick) exis
tence, a chance to think independently, to
become a user and giver of information rather
than a receiver. But I find the prospect of
leaving university life behind more disturbing
than not. It is not just that my leisure time will
be considerably more constricted. It is some
thing more. If the real world is a place where

people don't endure endless cycles of
notetaking, memorizing and exam-taking, it is
also a place where people believe they
become informed by watching the "CBS
Evening News," where people confine the ex
tent of their reading to the sports section and
The National Enquirer (People magazine, for
the more sophisticated) and where an over
whelming majority of people can in good con
science elect a man who quotes the Bible to
justify arms spending as president — twice.
The real world boasts people with very nar
row minds, very narrow concerns and, most
unfortunate of all, very narrow experience.
(Stanford has its share of these types, too, but
luckily the proportion is relatively low.)
The problem is not too little of the real
world in the university experience, but too
little of the university life in the real world.
That is not to say they ought to start handing
out blue books at Hewlett-Packard. The real
worth of a university education lies not so
much in memorizing facts but in becoming
aware of the complexity of our society, our
culture, our technology, our very thought. In
the best of circumstances, such an awareness
promotes a constant questioning and critical
evaluation of problems and assumptions that,
hopefully, allows us to draw intelligent con
clusions about ourselves and our world.
Where except at a university can you expect

to find such a range of diverse people with
diverse opinions? Where except at a univer
sity can you get the exchange of ideas, the ex
posure to the brightest minds of the past and
present, and the appreciation of the finer
products of the human spirit that enrich and
inspire our lives?
There is something rather tragic about the
distinction we correctly draw between the real
world and the university. Here, a great por
tion of our energy is channeled into learning.
It is not so on the outside. Too often, the
focus of life after college becomes earning a
paycheck. The emphasis is on providing —
providing for the future, providing for one's
family. These are not unworthy concerns, nor
are they necessarily mundane. But some
where along the line thinking gets lost. I see
"real people" walking around on automatic
pilot; when you have to pay bills, you don't
have time to think critically. That the self
examination and pursuit of knowledge which
are so commonplace in college become
devalued as soon as you graduate is apparent
in our attitudes. We look disapprovingly on
the professional student who never seems to
stop taking classes. University scholars are
scorned as speaking from ivory towers. Edu
cation is viewed in almost ever}' quarter as
primarily a means to future security. (Almost
all of us have had the experience of telling

someone our major and getting the response,
"Oh. And what do you plan to do with
that?") While there is nothing wrong with
using education in such a fashion, this attitude
and others reflect an underlying thought
process: The dedication of one's time to
learning, formally or informally, is not worthy
in and of itself. It's escapist. It's not real.
It is unfortunate that such a perception per
sists. Learning about the world and develop
ing skills to analyze it should not be a luxury
difficult to afford and confined to the enjoy
ment of a relative few for a relatively short
time. College should not be the first and last
place we get the chance to move beyond the
simplistic notions and narrow mindsets that
seem to dominate the real world. I think it is
the challenge of those of us who graduate
from institutions like Stanford to resist the
real-world pressures that iron out the sharp
edges of critical thought. If we can think here,
we can think out there, too. We have to, if
anything truly good and truly lasting is to
come from our years here. When we
graduate, instead of thinking about leaving
Stanford behind to face reality, it might be
better to think about taking a little of Stan
ford with us to transform reality.

about relationships while eating fro-yo, and
placing a backpack full of books they won't
read into the trunk of a Tahoe-bound rented
car. We all know that this isn't real; it's sur
real.
Or so we believe. Indeed, it is true that the
real world offers most of us a more meaning
ful (or more lucrative, take your pick) exis
tence, a chance to think independently, to
become a user and giver of information rather
than a receiver. But I find the prospect of
leaving university life behind more disturbing
than not. It is not just that my leisure time will
be considerably more constricted. It is some
thing more. If the real world is a place where

people don't endure endless cycles of
notetaking, memorizing and exam-taking, it is
also a place where people believe they
become informed by watching the "CBS
Evening News," where people confine the ex
tent of their reading to the sports section and
The National Enquirer (People magazine, for
the more sophisticated) and where an over
whelming majority of people can in good con
science elect a man who quotes the Bible to
justify arms spending as president — twice.
The real world boasts people with very nar
row minds, very narrow concerns and, most
unfortunate of all, very narrow experience.
(Stanford has its share of these types, too, but
luckily the proportion is relatively low.)
The problem is not too little of the real
world in the university experience, but too
little of the university life in the real world.
That is not to say they ought to start handing
out blue books at Hewlett-Packard. The real
worth of a university education lies not so
much in memorizing facts but in becoming
aware of the complexity of our society, our
culture, our technology, our very thought. In
the best of circumstances, such an awareness
promotes a constant questioning and critical
evaluation of problems and assumptions that,
hopefully, allows us to draw intelligent con
clusions about ourselves and our world.
Where except at a university can you expect

to find such a range of diverse people with
diverse opinions? Where except at a univer
sity can you get the exchange of ideas, the ex
posure to the brightest minds of the past and
present, and the appreciation of the finer
products of the human spirit that enrich and
inspire our lives?
There is something rather tragic about the
distinction we correctly draw between the real
world and the university. Here, a great por
tion of our energy is channeled into learning.
It is not so on the outside. Too often, the
focus of life after college becomes earning a
paycheck. The emphasis is on providing —
providing for the future, providing for one's
family. These are not unworthy concerns, nor
are they necessarily mundane. But some
where along the line thinking gets lost. I see
"real people" walking around on automatic
pilot; when you have to pay bills, you don't
have time to think critically. That the self
examination and pursuit of knowledge which
are so commonplace in college become
devalued as soon as you graduate is apparent
in our attitudes. We look disapprovingly on
the professional student who never seems to
stop taking classes. University scholars are
scorned as speaking from ivory towers. Edu
cation is viewed in almost ever}' quarter as
primarily a means to future security. (Almost
all of us have had the experience of telling

someone our major and getting the response,
"Oh. And what do you plan to do with
that?") While there is nothing wrong with
using education in such a fashion, this attitude
and others reflect an underlying thought
process: The dedication of one's time to
learning, formally or informally, is not worthy
in and of itself. It's escapist. It's not real.
It is unfortunate that such a perception per
sists. Learning about the world and develop
ing skills to analyze it should not be a luxury
difficult to afford and confined to the enjoy
ment of a relative few for a relatively short
time. College should not be the first and last
place we get the chance to move beyond the
simplistic notions and narrow mindsets that
seem to dominate the real world. I think it is
the challenge of those of us who graduate
from institutions like Stanford to resist the
real-world pressures that iron out the sharp
edges of critical thought. If we can think here,
we can think out there, too. We have to, if
anything truly good and truly lasting is to
come from our years here. When we
graduate, instead of thinking about leaving
Stanford behind to face reality, it might be
better to think about taking a little of Stan
ford with us to transform reality.

Stanford students — especially the cynical
ones, like myself — like to complain every
once in awhile about how university life, uni
versity concerns and even university educa
tion are far removed from and little resemble
the demands and pressures of the "real
world." We grumble about it a little more
with each successive year. The euphoria of
freshman year dwindles, the monotony and
disillusionment that often accompany
familiarity mount, and maturity (or some
semblance of it) seems to beckon us toward
things beyond the bounds of the lecture hall.
At times, after several hours feverishly
memorizing facts and figures, we wonder
sourly where on earth we will ever encounter
a situation outside a college campus in which
we'll be required to spew out loads of infor
mation onto the pages of a little blue book.
Sometimes it's difficult to imagine what is
more inane than spending one's day sitting in
chairs with half-desks, listening to someone
talk while you paraphrase his or her words on
notebook paper. We realize that we won't re
member much of what we're taking notes on
even if we/want to, just as we realize that the
midterm we agonize over today will be forgot
ten tomorrow. The sense of immediacy we
bring to a problem set pales in comparison to
the broad responsibilities of adulthood. Even
when we're less than intense, the quality of

our nonchalance is markedly different from
that of the real world. We look around and
see people lying in the sun reading
Nietzsche, getting into heated discussions

about relationships while eating fro-yo, and
placing a backpack full of books they won't
read into the trunk of a Tahoe-bound rented
car. We all know that this isn't real; it's sur
