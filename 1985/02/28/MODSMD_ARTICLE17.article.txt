Phi Psi's finances
The editorial "Fiscal responsibil
ity" (The Daily, Feb. 21) presents an
inaccurate picture of the financial
operation of Phi Psi. While it is true
that we have had problems, as a
co-op we have collectively and
responsibly dealt with them.
The Daily alleges that our debt is
"more than $10,000," and implies
that nonpayment by previous resi
dents is chiefly responsible for it. In
fact, the debt is currently about
$9,000 and will be under $4,000 by
the end of March. The money will
come from current residents who
have not yet paid for this quarter.
This is nothing new at Phi Psi; our
flexible payment policy allows resi
dents to temporarily defer payment
without penalty. We emphasize the
word "temporarily." In the handful
of cases in which people have not

paid by the end of the quarter, holds
have been placed on Permits to
Register (PTRs), and people who
would have otherwise graduated
have not. This has been effective; we
expect our entire debt to be paid off
in the near future.
The Daily suggests that our
"room-and-board charges should be
placed on the Permit to Register to
ensure payment." This would
severely reduce our flexibility and
make matters difficult for some of
our residents. Furthermore, it is not
at all clear that PTR billing would
ensure payment; we take the same
action the University does when
students have outstanding debts. We
are prepared, if necessary, to take
legal action; the University can do
no more. While PTR billing would
certainly relieve us of a great deal of
responsibility, it is not responsibility
we wish to be relieved of.

As The Daily points out, we han
dle more than $100,000 each year.
There have been problems, but these
have been dealt with, and by Phi Psi,
not the University.
Finally, we are curious as to why
The Daily singled out Phi Psi for
scrutiny, as many other houses have
debts to the University, some sub
stantially greater than ours. It is
especially ironic in light of the fact
that our debt is well on its way to
being completely eliminated.

I must say, some of the more
stimulating moments at the readings
by Edward Albee in Kresge
Auditorium Tuesday night were
provided by The Daily's (I presume
they were The Daily's) staff photog
raphers. Expensive-sounding clicks

from the expensive-looking reflex
cameras punctuated the earlier parts
of Albee's talk. A truly impressive
display that raised my annoyance
hackles.
Clickety clickety . . . click.
Umpteen-thousand-millimeter
cannon-sized lenses pointed at Albee
from only 10 feet away. Camera
persons squatting to change the film
in their cameras. By the time the
massacre was over Albee was well
into his talk and it took me a good
while to pick up the thread. I was
expecting no less than a full-page
photo expose. All that for the one
small photo that eventually appeared.
Hey . . . why not get some
motordrives, so those babies can
really cut loose. And more telephoto
lenses: I want to see the speaker's
nasal hairs in the next edition.
