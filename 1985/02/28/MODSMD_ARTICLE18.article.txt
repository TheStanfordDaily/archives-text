## The 						Band is more than just road trips

It is time that the Band finally
respond to the recent articles, letters
and editorials concerning next year's
budget. The picture which has been
painted up to now is one of a
"blackmailing" Band which wishes to

VIEWPOINT

deceive students and force them into
paying for an entire road trip. Let us
explain how things really stand.
To begin with, the Band doesn't
oppose the splitting of our budget and
never has opposed it. This year's
management agrees that budgets
from past years did unfairly ask the
students to finance the entire
road trip. It is our opinion that stu
dents should be taxed for operating
expenses and a small percentage of
the road trip. (After all. when we
travel out of state we are not just
going to play for University President
Donald Kennedy â€” we are inspiring
the team, entertaining the visiting
Stanford fans and representing stu
dent interests.)
With this thought in mind, we sub
mitted a budget to the ASSU that did
the following It took the operating
costs that the University had previ
ously funded and asked the students
(ASSU) to pay for them. In addition,
it asked the ASSU to pay for one
quarter of the road trip, thus cutting
the proportion of ASSU road trip
costs down to $5,000 (a $40,000

decrease from this year's budget).
Our total budget proposal (excluding
road trip) was also approximately
$3,000 less than this year's budget.
The budget allocated $ 10,500 of Uni
versity money and $2,500 from indi
vidual members of the Band to pay
for the remaining three quarters of
the trip. We considered this (and still
do) a very fair compromise from past
years and we were ready to accept a
senate vote to split off the $5,000 in
order to let the students decide if they
wished to pay for one quarter of the
trip.
When our budget finally emerged
from the Appropriations Committee
(the group which recommends a yes

or no vote to the senate on a budget),
we were confounded. The committee
made the expected split, but also told
us that we couldn't have the Univer
sity fund three quarters of the trip.
The committee's rationale was that if
the Band didn't go on a road trip then
the students wouldn't have to pay for
the extra operating costs which were
transferred from the University to the
ASSU. In other words, if the Univer
sity didn't use the money to pay for
three quarters of a road trip, it could
pick up those operating costs and
save students money.
Our response is the following: The
ASSU has not only meddled with our
University money (which it had no

right to do) hut has also, in the
process, made it look as if the Band
was trying to once again unfairly
overtax the students by asking them
to pay for the entire trip. The Council
of Presidents veto last week (which
was later overridden by the senate)
was essentially a protest against this
overextended authority of the ASSU,
which has succeeded in making the
Band's budget appear as unfavorable
as possible. We are only asking that
the students assume our operating
costs previously funded by the Uni
versity (such as Dollie uniforms, hats,
uniform cleaning, etc.) so that the
University can pay for the majority of
our travel. In sum: We ask for an
equitable redistribution of funding to
more adequately reflect financial re
sponsibility.
The Band is continuing to fight this
reorganization by the ASSU but it is
very possible that we will be unable to
penetrate through its bureaucratic
stubbornness. If this does turn out to
be the case and the ASSU version of
our budget continues to ask the stu
dents to finance the entire trip, then
the Band makes a request: Remem
ber as you vote that we have made
great attempts to conform to student
requests to reduce the road trip costs
and that if the road trip passes the
University will finally assume its fair
financial share of the trip.
