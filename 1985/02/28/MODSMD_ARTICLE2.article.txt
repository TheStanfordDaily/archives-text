# Robinson discusses role of fraternities

### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
Fraternities seeking University
housing will have to wait for a
report from a special task force
before a decision is made on the
future status of fraternal groups at
Stanford, according to Norm Rob
inson, assistant dean for Residential
Education.
Robinson, speaking at a forum
last night at Yost House on the roles
Residential Education and fraternal
groups at Stanford, said the prob
lem of housing privileges "became
clear as we continued to recognize
non-residential fraternities and
sororities."
"There isn't a plan right now in
terms of how to address the prob
lem," Robinson said, adding that it
is "a matter of waiting to get that
report" from the Task Force to
Study Fraternities and Sororities at
Stanford.
The task force made several gen
eral recommendations last spring,
including one that called into ques
tion the future of the current frater
nity housing policy. That recom
mendation said student housing
"may not be denied based on the
subjective judgment of current or
former residents."
Robinson called the reports
"statements of principle and ideas
without any real substance."
He acknowledged there is "a
problem" with providing University
resources to unhoused fraternities

and sororities that want to hold par
tics on campus and have a place to
store files. He said the University's
hiring of a fraternal affairs adviser
should help the situation, making
communication between the Inter
fraternity Council (IFC) and the In
tersorority Council (ISC) and the
University much smoother.
John Even, co-chair of an IFC
ISC task force and a panelist at the
meeting, called the University's
move to hire a fraternal affairs ad
viser "'really a positive step" to deal
with fraternal problems.
Chris Reid, the other IFC-ISC
task force chair, said building new
housing to meet the demands of
those wanting housing is not a
reasonable solution. "We can't keep
going until we get to the ocean," she
said.
Reid said one "hypothetical" so
lution to the problem could be a
lodge where unhoused groups could
have parties and keep records of
group affairs. She also noted an
"adopt-an-unhoused-group" pro
posal in which row houses would
provide space for a particular frater
nity or sorority.
The panelists, including James
Quillinan, president of the Alumni
Interfraternity Council (AIFC) and
a past member of the Delta Kappa
Epsilon fraternity, also discussed
the role of alumni in the future of
fraternities at the Universtiy.
Although Robinson said the
alumni compose a group "whose in

terest is very real . . . one cannot
make all of the decisions based
solely on what the alumni want."
"The University has to take into
account (a) whole range of con
stituencies," including the feelings
of all members of the University
community, Robinson said.
Ouillinan said the AIFC has
begun to work closely with Res Ed
the past nine months to improve the
relationship between fraternities
and the University. .
Ouillinan also said the AIFC is
trying to bring seminar programs
back to housed fraternities and im
prove community service efforts.
He said the AIFC worked with fra
ternities last fall to establish an
adopt-a-school program in which
fraternity members donate their

time and services to Ravenswood
School.
Even said many in the Stanford
community believe fraternities take
part in community service efforts
only to "make up ground" with the
University when they are faced with
suspension or other University ac
tion.
Ouillinan said an effort is being
made to increase alumni interest in
fraternities, particularly among
alumni who belonged to houses that
are now considered to be "weak.''
Ouillinan called the alumni "the
cement that holds the bricks to
gether in this thing."
Robinson said that while alumni
can advise present fraternities, they
cannot "run the show."
