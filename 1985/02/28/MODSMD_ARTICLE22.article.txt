## USIU stuns Stanford, 5-4 
### TOM SENF Staff sportswriter 
On paper, the 1-9 Gulls of United
States International University of San
Diego had no chance to beat the
nationally ranked Stanford Cardinal
at Sunken Diamond yesterday.
Unfortunately for the home team,
the game wasn't played on paper.
On the strength of a dramatic two
out comeback in the ninth inning, the
Gulls pulled off a shocking 5-4 upset,
ending Stanford's six-game winning
streak. Rightfielder Steve Hendricks'
bases-loaded single off Rick Diet/
drove the tying and winning runs
across the plate.
Although it may have just been a
tune-up game for Stanford, the game
was a crucial one for the USIU pro
gram. "This could be a big turn
around for us, especially for a school
trying to get into the WCAC (West
Coast Athletic Conference)," Coach
Alan Everest said.
In short, the Gulls had nothing to
lose and everything to gain, and they
played like it, jumping out to a 2-0
lead after the top of the third. First
baseman David Kachigian opened
the scoring in the second with a home
run off Stanford starter Ugo Collela.
Realizing it was in a ballgame, the
Cardinal struck back quickly. Mark
Davis smashed the first pitch of the
Stanford half of the third inning
for his fourth homer of the year. In
the fifth, Pete Stanicek put Stanford
ahead 3-2 with a two-run single to
left.
The Gulls were stymied during the
middle innings, thanks to the out

standing relief work of David Harris.
Harris, who hadn't pitched since Jan.
3 1 against Fullerton State, came on in
the fourth and threw four shutout in
nings.
Harris" performance was one of the
few things Cardinal Coach Mark
Marquess was happy about after the
game. "David Harris threw very well
today," he said. About the prospects
of Harris throwing more than once
every four weeks. Marquess said,
"He certainly helped his chances
today."
Jack McDowell took over for Har
ris in the eighth, and the Gulls' of
fense suddenly came back to life.
Four of the five men McDowell faced
hit the ball solidly — especially Paul
Zimmerman, whose opposite-field
homer to right cut the Cardinal lead
in half.
Dietz was called on to try to save
the win for Harris in the ninth. All
appeared well as he quietly retired
the first two hitters. Then the roof fell
in.
Pinch hitter Andre Jackson kept
the Gulls alive by lining a 1-2 pitch
into center. Shortstop Joe Canales
followed with a single between third
and short. Marquess made a trip to
the mound to settle Dietz down, but it
didn't do any good. After a walk to
Ron Green, Hendricks found the
same hole as Canales, who beat Walt
Harris' throw home to score the
game-winner.
"Dietz and I are from San Diego,
so we've faced each other before,"

Mitrk Davis' 2-for-3 day — including a home run — didn't ease the dis
appointment of the upset loss to USIU.
