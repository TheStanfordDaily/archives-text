# Lions no match for Card spikers
## 
### ROB GRAHAM Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford men's volleyball
team, ranked sixth nationally, over
matched Loyola-Mary mount in a
league contest last night at Maples
Pavilion. 15-8, 15-12, 8-15, 15-8.
With its victory, the Cardinal im
proved its mark in the California In
tercollegiate Volleyball Association
to 6-3 and moved, for the moment at
least, into fourth place in the league,
a half game ahead of UC-Santa Bar
bara. The men, who have an overall
record of 17-4, trail Pepperdine,
UCLA and USC.
The Lions, meanwhile, suffered
their sixth league set-back in a row
and fell into the CIV A cellar. Over
all, Loyola-Marymount stands at 13-
8.
Stanford Co-coach Don Shaw was
not ecstatic with his lackluster vic
tory. He was particulary disappointed
with what he perceived as a letdown
at the end of the second game and
throughout the third set.
"We have to learn to play as well as
we can regardless of the opponent,"
Shaw said. "We had a noticeable lack
of concentration. I don't think we
respected them enough."
Stanford fell prey to a familiar vol
leyball trap — collapsing in the third
game. Craig Lauchner, the team's
senior cantain. said. "We were readv

to play at the beginning. But in the
third game, we thought we had it
wrapped up. We lost the momentum,
and after all, it's basically a game of
momentum."
Though the Cardinal played down
to the Lions' level, Shaw was never
theless pleased that his team could
play poorly and still come away with a
victory.
"When we needed it, we could bear
down," Shaw said."But great teams
don't let the opponent bring them
down — they always play up to their
potential. Right now we're just a
pretty good team.
"But then again, we don't want to
peak to soon in the season. We'd like
to save our best volleyball for post
season play. We have a lot of poten
tial and should be able to play with
the best teams."
Stanford was paced by junior
outside hitter Brett Monello, who
notched 16 kills with a hitting
percentage of Scott Fortune
(.233), Chris Braun (.258) and Jon
Root (.176) each added 11 kills.
Loyola-Marymount was led by
Orly Sorlie and Chris Phair with 14
kills apiece. Matt Frohoff contributed
13 kills.
Stanford's next action is this af
ternoon as the Cardinal travels to
Moraga for a non-league match with
St. Mary's that begins at 4.
