Two softball streaks were in
creased to four games yesterday at
Berkeley.
Stanford lost a double-header to
California, 5-2 and 6-0, for its
third and fourth straight losses.
Cal, N-4, has now won four con
secutive games.
Lisa Buchanan, who pitched the
final four outs of the second game,
was the loser in the first. Buc
hanan, 3-5, said the first game
should have been closer.
"It would've been 2-2 without
our mental errors," Buchanan
said. Cal scored three unearned
runs in the first, and Kim Moe, 4-

2, was the winning pitchcr. Moe
had nine strikeouts. The Cardinal
committed one error and gave up
no unearned runs in the second
game but struck out nine times.
Stanford scored its first-game
runs in the fourth inning. Laura
Buchanan walked, Lisa, her sister,
singled and the Buchanans ad
vanced on a fielder's-choice
grounder by Christy Fiscalini.
Laura Buchanan scored on a wild
pitch by Moe. After a flyout, Lisa
Buchanan scored on Anna
Sanchez's groundout.
Stanford will get a chance to end
its losing streak against the team
that started it. The Cardinal plays
at San Jose City College today.
