# Hoop team in Beaver country

### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
Just when it appeared the remainder of the Stan
ford men's basketball season was to be left for the
Pacific 10 Conference vultures to pick over, the
Cardinal rose to scare away the scavengers.
Stanford, mired in the worst conference cam
paign of the Coach Tom Davis era, beat Pac-10 co
leader USC last Thursday — for the second time
this season. The victory ended a six-game Cardinal
losing streak and was an effective reminder to the
rest of the league that Stanford can — and will —
ruin a team's season.
The Cardinal gets its second chance in as many
games to play spoiler tonight when it travels to
Oregon State. Gametime at 10,500-seat Gill
Coliseum, a sure bet to be sold out, is 7:30 p.m.
Oregon State, which lost a non-conference home
gavne to New Mexico Tuesday night, enters
tonight's contest 19-7 overall and in third place
in the Pac-10 at 9-5. How important is the game to
the Beavers?
Coach Ralph Miller laid it on the line Monday in
a phone interview. "If we intend to remain alive at

all in the conference race, we can't afford any more
(conference) losses."
But after last night's 72-65 loss to New Mexico
— which marked the first time the Beavers have
lost more than four home games in Miller's 15-year
tenure there — Miller knows that just staying alive
in the Pac-10 might not be enough to make it to the
NCAA post-season tournament.
Since this year's selections are based on each
conference's performances in last year's tourna
ment, the Pac-10 is rated below most other confer
ences. Two teams — Washington and Oregon State
— were invited last year and this year the league
can expect three, but probably not four.
That doesn't leave Miller's Beavers with much
margin for error, especially with five teams within
two games of the conference lead. So unless
Oregon State wins its remaining four Pac-10
games, it's National Invitational Tounament time
for the Beavers.
Meanwhile, Stanford thrives on all of this tourn
ament talk, even if it only concerns its opponents.
"We can say a lot about the conference race,"
said Cardinal forward Andv Fischer, who scored a

career-high 22 points against USC. "Washington
(which plays at Stanford next week) and Oregon
State are still in it and we can affect where they end
up. We also can affect where we end up."
Stanford heads into the Oregon road trip at 11-
13 overall and tied for ninth in the Pac-1() with
Washington State at 3-11. Three victories in the
final four games would prevent Davis from suffer
ing the first losing season of his coaching career,
while two"Ws" could move the Cardinal as high as
eighth in the Pac-10.
When the Cardinal traveled to Corvallis last
year, the Beavers were coming off an 0-2 road trip
in Washington. When they met at Maples Pavilion
earlier this season, Oregon State was coming off
consecutive losses to Arizona State and California.
Both times, the Beavers didn't drop three straight.
And tonight, for the third time in a row, Oregon
State enters the game with a two-game losing
streak.
"When you come off a loss, you're angry and we
don't play very well against teams that are angry,"*j
Davis explained, "because they just come out and!
hang us."
