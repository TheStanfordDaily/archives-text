# Club team is No. 5 in nation
## Synch swimmers rising to top 
### JENNIFER KOCH Staff sportswriter 
At six in the morning, strains of Madonna, the
Blues Brothers and the soundtrack from
"Beverly Hills Cop" can be heard coming from the
direction of DeGuerre Pool. The source of this
music? The uncelebrated, unpublicized but ex
tremely talented Stanford women's synchronized
swimming team.
Led by coaches Vickey Weir, Andy Maisel and
Maggie Keep, the 14-member club sport team beat
California earlier this month and is currently
ranked fifth in the nation. This weekend the team
travels to Tuscon, Ariz., to face Arizona, Ohio
State and Michigan, the top three finishers in the
Intercollegiate Nationals last year. Stanford took
fifth place in that competition.
Stanford team members feel their lack of
recognition is partly due to the fact that they have
no home meets this season. The Cardinal hopes to
remedy this by giving an exhibition on the second
or third weekend of spring quarter.
The sport has gained popularity since becoming
an Olympic event this year. Team captain Marcia
Fetterman says the Stanford program is expanding
as well: More women tried out this fall and the
team is larger than in previous seasons.
Practice for team members began in the fall; it
generally has been held at the less-than-desirable
times of 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. As a club sport,
synchronized swimming has had to work around
the varsity swimming teams, swimming classes

and recreational swimmming.
The workouts consist both of conditioning and
working on routines. Team members swim laps on
the surface, usually 1,500 to 2,000 yards total, and
laps underwater.
"One of the hardest parts of the sport is holding
your breath for so long," says sophomore Kathy
Reeves, a novice swimmer. Fetterman agrees,
saying: "It's hard to convince the judges that you
aren't dying. You can't gasp!"
The team routine, created primarily by the
coaches, is performed by eight women and includes
all the novice swimmers. This routine is inter
spersed with underwater segments, some lasting as
long as 35 seconds.
In addition to the group routine, the Stanford
team also has two trios, one duet, and two solo
routines. These routines are made up by the swim
mers themselves. The swimmers are also allowed to
choose their own music, which usually consists of
wordless segments of popular songs.
There are two phases of judging at a
synchronized swimming meet. First, swimmers
complete six compulsory figures, divided into
novice, junior or senior categories, then perform
the actual routines. Two sets of scores are awarded,
based on the content and the execution of the per
formance. According to Fetterman, the judges look
for "strength, skill, grace and confidence."
The team wears solid black suits and white caps
for the compulsory figures. The individual routines
have flashier suits, however, and the group routine

is performed in red-and-white suits with multi
colored stripes.
A common team complaint is the hair gel neces
sary for every performance. This gel is Knox
gelatin, and it serves to keep the swimmer's hair
out ot her face, as well as to create a more uniform
team appearance.
The Stanford team consists mainly of women
with experience in swimming, although not neces
sarily in synchronized swimming. Some team mem
bers have taken a synchronized swimming class or
competed with a club for a few years, but most of
the women got started here.
Reeves, who says the team is "a great way to
meet people and stay in shape," competed on her
high school swimming team before trying out for
synchronized swimming at Stanford.
Next weekend, Stanford competes in the West
ern Regionals at Berkeley. In all likelihood, the
Cardinal will then travel to Indianapolis to compete
in the Intercollegiate Nationals on March 21-24, to
which the top three teams from each region are
invited.
Fetterman sums up the feelings of the Stanford
team, the judges and the audience toward
synchronized swimming, saying, "It's such a pretty
sport. And if you do it well enough, it looks easy."
Among universities that don't give synchronized
swimming scholarships, Stanford is the best in the
nation and the Cardinal has a good shot at a third
place finish in Indianapolis next month, Fetterman
said.

your breath for so long," says sophomore Kathy
Reeves, a novice swimmer. Fetterman agrees,
saying: "It's hard to convince the judges that you
aren't dying. You can't gasp!"
The team routine, created primarily by the
coaches, is performed by eight women and includes
all the novice swimmers. This routine is inter
spersed with underwater segments, some lasting as
long as 35 seconds.
In addition to the group routine, the Stanford
team also has two trios, one duet, and two solo
routines. These routines are made up by the swim
mers themselves. The swimmers are also allowed to
choose their own music, which usually consists of
wordless segments of popular songs.
There are two phases of judging at a
synchronized swimming meet. First, swimmers
complete six compulsory figures, divided into
novice, junior or senior categories, then perform
the actual routines. Two sets of scores are awarded,
based on the content and the execution of the per
formance. According to Fetterman, the judges look
for "strength, skill, grace and confidence."
The team wears solid black suits and white caps
for the compulsory figures. The individual routines
have flashier suits, however, and the group routine

is performed in red-and-white suits with multi
colored stripes.
A common team complaint is the hair gel neces
sary for every performance. This gel is Knox
gelatin, and it serves to keep the swimmer's hair
out ot her face, as well as to create a more uniform
team appearance.
The Stanford team consists mainly of women
with experience in swimming, although not neces
sarily in synchronized swimming. Some team mem
bers have taken a synchronized swimming class or
competed with a club for a few years, but most of
the women got started here.
Reeves, who says the team is "a great way to
meet people and stay in shape," competed on her
high school swimming team before trying out for
synchronized swimming at Stanford.
Next weekend, Stanford competes in the West
ern Regionals at Berkeley. In all likelihood, the
Cardinal will then travel to Indianapolis to compete
in the Intercollegiate Nationals on March 21-24, to
which the top three teams from each region are
invited.
Fetterman sums up the feelings of the Stanford
team, the judges and the audience toward
synchronized swimming, saying, "It's such a pretty
sport. And if you do it well enough, it looks easy."
Among universities that don't give synchronized
swimming scholarships, Stanford is the best in the
nation and the Cardinal has a good shot at a third
place finish in Indianapolis next month, Fetterman
said.

Synchronized swimmer Ruth Weinberg, selected to the national te ni
Tuesday, is one of the reasons why the Cardinal is ranked No. 5 in the
country.
