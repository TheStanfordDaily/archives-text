The Stanford men's tennis team, ranked No. 1 in the
nation, continued its rampage through its early season
warm-up schedule yesterday afternoon at Stanford Tennis
Stadium as it dropped the University of San Diego, 8-1.
With the victory, which was the Cardinal's eighth in a
row, Stanford upped its overall mark to an unblemished
8-0. But the only real test so far has been the match with
then-No. 8 Louisiana State. The Tigers are no longer
ranked in the top 10.
Although these preseason matches are of little signifi
cance — Pac-10 play does not begin for another month —
and even less of a challenge, Cardinal Coach Dick Gould
and his players still value them. "Against these fair teams
that aren't great teams," Gould said, "I'm looking for
solid efforts and concentration. In that respect, I'm ex
tremely pleased with my guys."
Mark Jacobson, Stanford's No. 6 singles player who
dumped Curtis Dadian 6-3, 6-0, was also satisfied. "We

use these matches to build confidence and work on our
games," he said. "Without them, we would get rusty."
Jacobson, coming off his second-place finish a week ago
in the Northern California Intercollegiate, was also able to
work on his doubles. "I haven't played doubles in a while
and I'm just getting back into it,"he said after teaming
with senior Jeremy Semple in the No. 2 doubles for a 6-4,
4-6, 6-4 victory over Alejandro Ramos and Chris Smith.
Up and down the singles lineup there were no surprises.
Dan Goldie, the country's top individual player, sent
Jim McNamee to an early shower, 6-4, 6-2. Jim Grabb —
No. 3 in the nation — dispensed with Ramos, 6-1, 6-0.
Only Eric Rosenfeld in the third singles spot struggled.
After losing the first set 6-3, the junior had to regroup,
and cruised through the second and third sets 6-0 and 6-2.
Gould attributed Rosenfeld's early troubles to "a little
nervousness."
The Titans' lone bright spot was its triumph in the third
doubles. Stanford's Rod Coull and Daryl Lee fell to
Dadian and Bradley in three tough sets, 6-4, 3-6, 2-6.
