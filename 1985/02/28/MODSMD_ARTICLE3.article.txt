While members of the Stanford
Concert Network say they continue
to lay the groundwork for a long-term
organization tailored to student
needs, rock promoter Bill Graham
said yesterday the group is fettered by
a bureaucracy that has turned at
tempts at bring performers here into
"commitee non-decision."
In a telephone interview yesterday,
Graham, the leading rock promoter
in Northern California, told The
Daily that the Concert Network has
demonstrated "a seeming unwilling
ness to be realistic" about booking
big-name rock 'n' roll entertainers.
Should the University give the green
light, Graham said he "guarantees"
to bring the Grateful Dead to Frost
Amphitheatre this spring.
"If the Concert Network joins with
us (Bill Graham Presents), we will
bring the Grateful Dead to Frost,"
Graham said in a telephone inter
view. "Speaking on their (the Grate
ful Dead's) behalf, I can tell you they
like that facility. They would like to
play Frost, especially since this year is
the 20th anniversary of the Grateful
Dead."
Bui Derek Passarelli, chairman of
the Concert Network Advisory
Board, sees it differently. "We would

like to work with Bill Graham or any
other promoter," he said. But, "The
Grateful Dead will not play at Stan
ford University.
"We're operating on very soft
ground. For now we have to prove to
the University that we can put on re
sponsible concerts," he said.
The first step to bringing quality
performances here is to establish
credibility with the University, and
Grateful Dead concerts "have
alienated University officials and
people in Palo Alto," Passarelli said.
"I don't want to take that risk," he
said.
Concert Network Director Aaron
Persky concurred, saying, "There is
the perception that some people
within the University have that the
Grateful Dead attract an unwanted
element."
Passarelli cited a 1983 Grateful
Dead concert here that resulted in
more than a dozen arrests, damage to
University facilities and traffic
congestion in Palo Alto.
"We think this is indicative of the
kind of people a Grateful Dead con
ccrt attracts," he snicf. "Carlos San
tana played also here in 1983 ...
without the same kind of wear and
tear."
