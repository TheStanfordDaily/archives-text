# Promoter says student group blocks concerts

### TROY EID Editorial staff 
While members of the Stanford
Concert Network say they continue
to lay the groundwork for a long-term
organization tailored to student
needs, rock promoter Bill Graham
said yesterday the group is fettered by
a bureaucracy that has turned at
tempts at bring performers here into
"commitee non-decision."
In a telephone interview yesterday,
Graham, the leading rock promoter
in Northern California, told The
Daily that the Concert Network has
demonstrated "a seeming unwilling
ness to be realistic" about booking
big-name rock 'n' roll entertainers.
Should the University give the green
light, Graham said he "guarantees"
to bring the Grateful Dead to Frost
Amphitheatre this spring.
"If the Concert Network joins with
us (Bill Graham Presents), we will
bring the Grateful Dead to Frost,"
Graham said in a telephone inter
view. "Speaking on their (the Grate
ful Dead's) behalf, I can tell you they
like that facility. They would like to
play Frost, especially since this year is
the 20th anniversary of the Grateful
Dead."
Bui Derek Passarelli, chairman of
the Concert Network Advisory
Board, sees it differently. "We would

like to work with Bill Graham or any
other promoter," he said. But, "The
Grateful Dead will not play at Stan
ford University.
"We're operating on very soft
ground. For now we have to prove to
the University that we can put on re
sponsible concerts," he said.
The first step to bringing quality
performances here is to establish
credibility with the University, and
Grateful Dead concerts "have
alienated University officials and
people in Palo Alto," Passarelli said.
"I don't want to take that risk," he
said.
Concert Network Director Aaron
Persky concurred, saying, "There is
the perception that some people
within the University have that the
Grateful Dead attract an unwanted
element."
Passarelli cited a 1983 Grateful
Dead concert here that resulted in
more than a dozen arrests, damage to
University facilities and traffic
congestion in Palo Alto.
"We think this is indicative of the
kind of people a Grateful Dead con
ccrt attracts," he snicf. "Carlos San
tana played also here in 1983 ...
without the same kind of wear and
tear."
Graham said "the facts" indicate
"that we were not responsible for
what happened" at the 1983 Grateful
Dead concert.
The Grateful Dead was the last
group to play before the 1983 concert
moritorium, Persky said. The rock
group has come to be identified with
that University-instituted mora
torium, which was lifted in April
1984, opening a place for the Concert
Network on the spring ASSU ballot.
The network was subsequently ap
proved for a three-year fee assess
ment.
"The Grateful Dead has played the
most at Stanford," Persky said. "We
would better serve the students by
trying for a different group."
Danny Sher, a Bill Graham
Presents official, said yesterday that

the Grateful Dead is "the best group
to bring to the Bay Area because
they're a sure thing and their audi
ence is mature — between 25 and 30
years old."
"Dead concerts are always
lucrative," Sher said.
But the Concert Network "isn't a
business," according to Passarelli.
"The ultimate goal is education to the
students."
Graham, however, said the inex
perience of Concert Network mem
bers and the youth of the organiza
tion are to blame for" the lack of con
certs" at Stanford.
"The Network continues to try to
find ways to do things they haven't
earned," Graham said. "I don't want
to sound derogatory, but . . . never
having promoted shows, the network
is telling us we should just move over
while (they) experiment being
promoters.'
"We have a 20-year relationship
with them (the Grateful Dead). We

should work with the network to
bring them to Stanford," he said.
Sher agreed, saying his company
"goes to work" while the Concert
Network "has meetings."
"The network is too big," Sher
said. "The only thing worse than
meeting with 13 of them is meeting
with 13 lawyers."
Passarelli and Persky disputed the
charge that the Concert Network has
failed to be effective.
Last week, the advisory board, a
group of students and University staff
that governs the Concert Network,
voted to approve six Frost shows
through Sept. 1, Passarelli said.
"We must be doing something
right," Passarelli said. "We're really
excited that we have some shows
coming up.
Neither Persky nor Passarelli
would say what acts were being con
sidered for the six Frost shows.
"If Bill Graham is a little patient,
we'll have a strong network," he said.

group has come to be identified with
that University-instituted mora
torium, which was lifted in April
1984, opening a place for the Concert
Network on the spring ASSU ballot.
The network was subsequently ap
proved for a three-year fee assess
ment.
"The Grateful Dead has played the
most at Stanford," Persky said. "We
would better serve the students by
trying for a different group."
Danny Sher, a Bill Graham
Presents official, said yesterday that

the Grateful Dead is "the best group
to bring to the Bay Area because
they're a sure thing and their audi
ence is mature — between 25 and 30
years old."
"Dead concerts are always
lucrative," Sher said.
But the Concert Network "isn't a
business," according to Passarelli.
"The ultimate goal is education to the
students."
Graham, however, said the inex
perience of Concert Network mem
bers and the youth of the organiza
tion are to blame for" the lack of con
certs" at Stanford.
"The Network continues to try to
find ways to do things they haven't
earned," Graham said. "I don't want
to sound derogatory, but . . . never
having promoted shows, the network
is telling us we should just move over
while (they) experiment being
promoters.'
"We have a 20-year relationship
with them (the Grateful Dead). We

should work with the network to
bring them to Stanford," he said.
Sher agreed, saying his company
"goes to work" while the Concert
Network "has meetings."
"The network is too big," Sher
said. "The only thing worse than
meeting with 13 of them is meeting
with 13 lawyers."
Passarelli and Persky disputed the
charge that the Concert Network has
failed to be effective.
Last week, the advisory board, a
group of students and University staff
that governs the Concert Network,
voted to approve six Frost shows
through Sept. 1, Passarelli said.
"We must be doing something
right," Passarelli said. "We're really
excited that we have some shows
coming up.
Neither Persky nor Passarelli
would say what acts were being con
sidered for the six Frost shows.
"If Bill Graham is a little patient,
we'll have a strong network," he said.
While members of the Stanford
Concert Network say they continue
to lay the groundwork for a long-term
organization tailored to student
needs, rock promoter Bill Graham
said yesterday the group is fettered by
a bureaucracy that has turned at
tempts at bring performers here into
"commitee non-decision."
In a telephone interview yesterday,
Graham, the leading rock promoter
in Northern California, told The
Daily that the Concert Network has
demonstrated "a seeming unwilling
ness to be realistic" about booking
big-name rock 'n' roll entertainers.
Should the University give the green
light, Graham said he "guarantees"
to bring the Grateful Dead to Frost
Amphitheatre this spring.
"If the Concert Network joins with
us (Bill Graham Presents), we will
bring the Grateful Dead to Frost,"
Graham said in a telephone inter
view. "Speaking on their (the Grate
ful Dead's) behalf, I can tell you they
like that facility. They would like to
play Frost, especially since this year is
the 20th anniversary of the Grateful
Dead."
Bui Derek Passarelli, chairman of
the Concert Network Advisory
Board, sees it differently. "We would

like to work with Bill Graham or any
other promoter," he said. But, "The
Grateful Dead will not play at Stan
ford University.
"We're operating on very soft
ground. For now we have to prove to
the University that we can put on re
sponsible concerts," he said.
The first step to bringing quality
performances here is to establish
credibility with the University, and
Grateful Dead concerts "have
alienated University officials and
people in Palo Alto," Passarelli said.
"I don't want to take that risk," he
said.
Concert Network Director Aaron
Persky concurred, saying, "There is
the perception that some people
within the University have that the
Grateful Dead attract an unwanted
element."
Passarelli cited a 1983 Grateful
Dead concert here that resulted in
more than a dozen arrests, damage to
University facilities and traffic
congestion in Palo Alto.
"We think this is indicative of the
kind of people a Grateful Dead con
ccrt attracts," he snicf. "Carlos San
tana played also here in 1983 ...
without the same kind of wear and
tear."
Graham said "the facts" indicate
"that we were not responsible for
what happened" at the 1983 Grateful
Dead concert.
The Grateful Dead was the last
group to play before the 1983 concert
moritorium, Persky said. The rock
group has come to be identified with
that University-instituted mora
torium, which was lifted in April
1984, opening a place for the Concert
