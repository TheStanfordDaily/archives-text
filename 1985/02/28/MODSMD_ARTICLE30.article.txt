# Golfers shot down

### KEN STEVENS Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford women's golf
team was overwhelmed by a pow
erful Tulsa squad yesterday, losing
11-4 in a rare dual match at Cy
press Point.
Playing by the Nassau scoring
system, with five individual head
to-head matches each worth three
points (one point for low score on
the front nine, one for low score
on the back nine and one for low
overall score), Tulsa looked pow
erful on the course, according to
Stanford Coach Tim Baldwin.
"Tulsa is rounding into champi
onship form," Baldwin said.
"They looked awfully good."

Though the score was lopsided,
the individual matches were close,
according to Baldwin. "The
matches were ... all within a shot
or two," he said.
In the Wo. 1 match, Tulsa's
sensational Jody Rosenthal edged
Stanford's Kathleen McCarthy 2-
1, with McCarthy missing a short
putt on the 18th green that would
have tied the match.
The Cardinal women take today
off and resume action tomorrow in
the opening round of the Lady
Spartan at Fort Ord and Pebble
Beach. The weekend tournament
is an important one for the Card
inal in its quest to reach the
NCAA tournament in May.
