KZSU will air the most promising tracks from these albums tonight at 6
The rating scale is from one to five stars.

Phil Collins — iVo Jacket Required
*★ ★ 4
Phil Collins will continue to sell
millions of records until he runs out
of different ways to photograph his
own face. Each of his three solo al
bums blesses us with another mug
shot. Not that he isn't cute, of
course. And the similarities be
tween the albums don't stop at the
pictures. Every song on this album
could be renamed . . part 2."
There are oh-so-tender ballads, I
can-be-Peter-Gabriel-too progres
sive tracks, a few (too few) hot
dance cuts with the Phenix Horns

of Earth, Wind & Fire fame, and
enough in between to guarantee
success into the next fiscal year.
Okay, we're being kinda harsh on
the guy. But after his slow decline
into commercial success with
Genesis, and after the third album
of the same stuff, it all gets a little
frustrating to compare what we're
hearing with what we cduld be
hearing. When the Master Drum
mer plugs in a machine to provide
drum tracks on three songs, it's just
depressing. And all this after
hearing "Easy Lover" with Philip
Bailey. Phooey. Sure, "No Jacket

Required" is still good, but if it
were more like the good old days,
it'd be great.

"The Breakfast Club" soundtrack
★ ★
First of all, only one song on
"The Breakfast Club" is performed
by Simple Minds. And it's terrific.
In fact, its appearance is enough to
warrant two stars automatically.
Unfortunately (as can be seen by
the two stars above), all the other
songs tend to cancel out. The
Footloose-Flashdance filler is as
unbearable as always, the thought
provoking instrumentals are
boring, tedious and immediately
forgotten, and the only song left
over (by Wang Chung) is mediocre

at best. (Most of these "extra"
songs are almost nowhere in the

movie, except for that stupid dance
segment, so we have to figure it was
to save the soundtrack from being a
$5.98 list EP.) The extended single
of "Don't You (Forget About
Me)" is a few bucks less and much
more enjoyable. So consider the
main purpose of this review to be a
warning. Don't buy it expecting all
Simple Minds songs. You will be
severely disappointed and more
than a bit enraged. And that isn't
healthy for any of us. Just relax, go
buy the single and see the movie
($2.50 matinees) with the money
you save.

Johnson's Revue ★ V
Y'know the part in " Jungle Love'

by The Time where Morris Day
goes, "Hey Jesse! Now Jerome!
Yeeesss!" Well, this is Jesse. An
other member of Minneapolis'
Royal Family. If you consider
Prince to be first string, The Time
second string, Jesse himself would
have to be third and his backing
band a distant fourth — even
though they all look exactly like His
Royal Shortness himself. (Actually,
Jesse dresses in a stunning pink,
with pink lipstick and a pink guitar
with "Jesse" on it. And he drives a
pink T-Bird with "Jesse" license
plates.) The music, by the way, is
second-rate Time without Morris
Day's jokes. Which isn't much ex

cept for drum machining and funky
synths and boring, whiny semirap
vocals. Danceable, sure; purple, al
most — but distinctive? Engaging?
Worth it? No. No. No. Everybody's
getting tired of this stuff, the coup
d'etat is coming and Minneapolis is
soon to be back in the hands of
Mary Tyler Moore. (Hey! Why
doesn't Mary do an album too?)
Eventually, when Jesse and Apol
lonia and Vanity and all the rest are
forgotten, Prince and The Time will
still be selling like they should.
That's justice. That's America.

Prince to be first string, The Time
second string, Jesse himself would
have to be third and his backing
band a distant fourth — even
though they all look exactly like His
Royal Shortness himself. (Actually,
Jesse dresses in a stunning pink,
with pink lipstick and a pink guitar
with "Jesse" on it. And he drives a
pink T-Bird with "Jesse" license
plates.) The music, by the way, is
second-rate Time without Morris
Day's jokes. Which isn't much ex

cept for drum machining and funky
synths and boring, whiny semirap
vocals. Danceable, sure; purple, al
most — but distinctive? Engaging?
Worth it? No. No. No. Everybody's
getting tired of this stuff, the coup
d'etat is coming and Minneapolis is
soon to be back in the hands of
Mary Tyler Moore. (Hey! Why
doesn't Mary do an album too?)
Eventually, when Jesse and Apol
lonia and Vanity and all the rest are
forgotten, Prince and The Time will
still be selling like they should.
That's justice. That's America.
