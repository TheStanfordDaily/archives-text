# Grateful Dead uplifts crowd in performance
## 
### MARK BABSKI ROB MACAULAY 
In the turbulent world of rock 'n' roll music, the Grate
ful Dead have remained in the forefront, playing at sold
out concert halls for almost 20 years now.
The key to the Dead's success cannot be found in the
recording studio; they have never had a top-10 album or
single (except for the hit "Truckin' "). It has been their in
credible live performances that have brought them ex
tremely devoted fans. Unlike other big bands, their
concert recipe does not produce a prefabricated 95-
minute wham-bam-thank-you-mam show. Instead, a
Dead concert is a dynamic event where the audience is as
much a part as the band itself.
The three Chinese New Year concerts that the Dead
performed at the Henry J. Kaiser Convention Center in
Oakland on Feb. 18, 19 and 20 confirmed yet again why
the Dead have such an avid following. The shows were a
tour de force for Jerry Garcia and company. The atypi
cally red-shirted Garcia exhibited more energy than has
been seen from him since the pre-Dead-Goes-To-Heaven
days. Was there anything for him to prove in the light of
the recent drug rumors? The Dead have nothing at all to
prove to anyone. As Bob Weir said during "Turn on Your
Love Light," "We're getting old, but we can get better or
we can get worse, it's up to you to help us along." That
pretty much sums up the importance of the synergistic re
lationship between the Dead and their near-maniacal
fans. The Dead's music uplifts the crowd, whose ex
uberance enables such fabulous music to be made in the
first place.
The Dead established the tone for the three perfor
mances early on Monday night. The first set included an
invigorating "C.C. Rider" that featured strong solos by
Garcia, Weir and Mydland. Other highlights before the
intermission were "Cassidy," "Ramble on Rose" and
"Me and My Uncle." They closed the set with a great
"China Cat Sunflower" that went into the powerful tradi
tional favorite, "I Know You Rider."
After the break, the Dead came groovin' right back
with "He's Gone" which went straight into Willie Dixon's
number "Spoonful." During the bluesy "Spoonful," Gar
cia let loose with a few stinging guitar licks that had the
crowd rocking. After "Sampson and Delilah," "Eyes of
the World" and a customarily elaborate, tandem drum
solo, the Dead had everyone moving during the beautiful
"Sugar Magnolia." The positive energy generated by the
crowd and the band during this last tune was absolutely
incredible.
The Dead were definitely tight on Monday night, and
they continued their nice habits on Tuesday, the Chinese
New Year. This show was noticeably shorter than most
Dead shows, but that was more than compensated for by
the high quality of music. The group opened with an ex
hilarating rendition of the classic "Jack Straw" and after
that the show only got hotter. Memorable songs from the
first set included "Mama Tried," "Terrapin Station" and
a protracted version of "Bird Song." The crowd was en
tertained even during intermission when a local Kung Fu
organization put on a martial arts demonstration. Then,
choreographed with the drumming of the Rhythm Devils

(drummers Bill Kreutzmann and Mickey Hart), the same
group staged an authentic Chinese dance, complete with a
mock duel between ornately decorated "dragons."
The second hit in this show was vintage Grateful Dead.
During the popular hit "Truckin,' " an exchange of
grimaces between Weir and Garcia when they sang
"busted, down on Bourbon Street" sent the crowd into ut
ter pandemonium. From there on, with the help of tunes
like "Ashes Ashes" and "Touch of Glory" (also known as
"I Will Survive"), the show was nothing but high-energy
entertainment. The band ended with a sizzling rendition
of "Johnny B. Goode" and sent the audience home
anxiously anticipating that which was in store for the third
and final night.
The last evening of Grateful Dead music was excellent.
Garcia was quickly in fine form, making for a rousing

"Cold Rain and Snow," which opened the show. The
Beatles' "Day Tripper" was next, bringing back memories
of flower power and Captain Trips. After "Big River" and
"Tennessee Jed," the first set ended with Bob Weir and
the whole Kaiser Convention Center singing "... it looks
like rain, it feels like rain, oh here comes the rain."
Weir continued his strong vocals in the final set of these
three Chinese New Year concerts. His singing and Gar
cia's playing, along with the necessary contributions of
Mydland, Lesh, Kreutzmann and Hart, brought the crowd
to an emotional high in "Turn on Your Love Light."
"Scarlet Begonia" and "Fire on the Mountain" also
served to keep the show going in grand style. They closed
the performance with a fantastic my-oh-my "U.S. Blues"
that had everyone on his feet and dancing. It was a fit
ting end to a fine concert.
The three shows the Dead played in Oakland showed
that they are as strong as, or stronger than, ever. Maybe
the concerts don't last as long as they used to, but there is
no doubt that the Grateful Dead (and especially Jerry
Garcia) are in top musical form.

days. Was there anything for him to prove in the light of
the recent drug rumors? The Dead have nothing at all to
prove to anyone. As Bob Weir said during "Turn on Your
Love Light," "We're getting old, but we can get better or
we can get worse, it's up to you to help us along." That
pretty much sums up the importance of the synergistic re
lationship between the Dead and their near-maniacal
fans. The Dead's music uplifts the crowd, whose ex
uberance enables such fabulous music to be made in the
first place.
The Dead established the tone for the three perfor
mances early on Monday night. The first set included an
invigorating "C.C. Rider" that featured strong solos by
Garcia, Weir and Mydland. Other highlights before the
intermission were "Cassidy," "Ramble on Rose" and
"Me and My Uncle." They closed the set with a great
"China Cat Sunflower" that went into the powerful tradi
tional favorite, "I Know You Rider."
After the break, the Dead came groovin' right back
with "He's Gone" which went straight into Willie Dixon's
number "Spoonful." During the bluesy "Spoonful," Gar
cia let loose with a few stinging guitar licks that had the
crowd rocking. After "Sampson and Delilah," "Eyes of
the World" and a customarily elaborate, tandem drum
solo, the Dead had everyone moving during the beautiful
"Sugar Magnolia." The positive energy generated by the
crowd and the band during this last tune was absolutely
incredible.
The Dead were definitely tight on Monday night, and
they continued their nice habits on Tuesday, the Chinese
New Year. This show was noticeably shorter than most
Dead shows, but that was more than compensated for by
the high quality of music. The group opened with an ex
hilarating rendition of the classic "Jack Straw" and after
that the show only got hotter. Memorable songs from the
first set included "Mama Tried," "Terrapin Station" and
a protracted version of "Bird Song." The crowd was en
tertained even during intermission when a local Kung Fu
organization put on a martial arts demonstration. Then,
choreographed with the drumming of the Rhythm Devils

(drummers Bill Kreutzmann and Mickey Hart), the same
group staged an authentic Chinese dance, complete with a
mock duel between ornately decorated "dragons."
The second hit in this show was vintage Grateful Dead.
During the popular hit "Truckin,' " an exchange of
grimaces between Weir and Garcia when they sang
"busted, down on Bourbon Street" sent the crowd into ut
ter pandemonium. From there on, with the help of tunes
like "Ashes Ashes" and "Touch of Glory" (also known as
"I Will Survive"), the show was nothing but high-energy
entertainment. The band ended with a sizzling rendition
of "Johnny B. Goode" and sent the audience home
anxiously anticipating that which was in store for the third
and final night.
The last evening of Grateful Dead music was excellent.
Garcia was quickly in fine form, making for a rousing

"Cold Rain and Snow," which opened the show. The
Beatles' "Day Tripper" was next, bringing back memories
of flower power and Captain Trips. After "Big River" and
"Tennessee Jed," the first set ended with Bob Weir and
the whole Kaiser Convention Center singing "... it looks
like rain, it feels like rain, oh here comes the rain."
Weir continued his strong vocals in the final set of these
three Chinese New Year concerts. His singing and Gar
cia's playing, along with the necessary contributions of
Mydland, Lesh, Kreutzmann and Hart, brought the crowd
to an emotional high in "Turn on Your Love Light."
"Scarlet Begonia" and "Fire on the Mountain" also
served to keep the show going in grand style. They closed
the performance with a fantastic my-oh-my "U.S. Blues"
that had everyone on his feet and dancing. It was a fit
ting end to a fine concert.
The three shows the Dead played in Oakland showed
that they are as strong as, or stronger than, ever. Maybe
the concerts don't last as long as they used to, but there is
no doubt that the Grateful Dead (and especially Jerry
Garcia) are in top musical form.

In the turbulent world of rock 'n' roll music, the Grate
ful Dead have remained in the forefront, playing at sold
out concert halls for almost 20 years now.
The key to the Dead's success cannot be found in the
recording studio; they have never had a top-10 album or
single (except for the hit "Truckin' "). It has been their in
credible live performances that have brought them ex
tremely devoted fans. Unlike other big bands, their
concert recipe does not produce a prefabricated 95-
minute wham-bam-thank-you-mam show. Instead, a
Dead concert is a dynamic event where the audience is as
much a part as the band itself.
The three Chinese New Year concerts that the Dead
performed at the Henry J. Kaiser Convention Center in
Oakland on Feb. 18, 19 and 20 confirmed yet again why
the Dead have such an avid following. The shows were a
tour de force for Jerry Garcia and company. The atypi
cally red-shirted Garcia exhibited more energy than has
been seen from him since the pre-Dead-Goes-To-Heaven
days. Was there anything for him to prove in the light of
the recent drug rumors? The Dead have nothing at all to
