# 'Art Ensemble' interesting, but fails to break boundaries
## 
### ANDREW CROWELL 
OK, trivia fans, who was the first
black man to serve in the United
States Army?
That's right. William Appleby en
listed in 1776.
All right, who was the first black to
serve and die for Her Majesty, the
Queen of England?
A little harder, huh? Well, before
you call up the information desk at
Green Library, it was none other than
Jimbo Kwesi.
"The Third Decade" is the latest
effort by the Art Ensemble of
Chicago, a quintet of black musicians
who, in their own words, attempt "to
circulate consciousness, as our con
sciousness is circulated, pivoting
through all forms of the sound." The
&lbum possesses a patriotic zeal for
not only blacks but musicians in gen
eral. Back cover notes like "the
music, the Joy, the wonderful happi
ness that our lives are all about" rein
force this latter, more universal
theme.
The album opens with "Prayer for
Jimbo Kwesi" in a reflective wash of
synthesizer tones. The striking
similarity of this introduction with

that of Brian Eno's recent works
made me want to retitle the song
"Ambient No. 5" though my clever
intentions were erased when the song
changed to a fusion jazz tune. As the
band notes, "This prayer for him
(Jimbo Kwesi) is a commemorative
offering to all the black heroes who
gave their greatest gift for the
freedom of their peoples and
countries, bonded by the empires of
England and United States." The
progressive and missionary-like
quality of the ending of this song
serves as foreshadowing for the
remaining 75 percent of the album.
"Funky AECO" and "Zero" are
the two probable hits on the record.
Their slightly more mainstream
sound reminds me of Tresidder con
certs on Friday afternoons. Actually,
however, there are some subtle
nuances in this music that more
closely resemble feke jazz (i.e., the
Lounge Lizards) than fusion jazz.
Words can't really describe it, but
doesn't that sound more like John
Lurie on saxophone than Roscoe
Mitchell?
The melodic nature of "Walking in
the Moonlight" provides a refreshing

change of pace to the slightly
monotonous nature of improvisa
tional cuts like those mentioned
above. As the band explains in the
liner notes, "Before the pentagon,
but as the points converged, song
seed flowed through us and is here
shared after 50 years (1934 to 1984)
patiently waiting to be sown and
delivered, as if by chance to drift into
the ear of the sons, who understand
ing the prophet, embrace the flower
and offer it with love."
"The Bell Piece" has perhaps the
most interesting origin: "As the
peoples of the Earth move into the
21st century, where hi-tech moves
them deeper and deeper into realms
of the unknown, visions of the ancient
chime and bell remind us of the lyri
cal power that remains at the heart of
mankind's quest for fulfillment."
Really? Although perhaps a bit
presumptuous, the song combines
wild sax solos and Fripp/Summers
guitar-like sounds to form a thought
provoking piece more like a movie
score than a Chuck Mangione pop
tune.
The album closes with a rhythm
layered rock track entitled, appropri

ately enough, "Third Decade." The
first half of the eight-minute song is
nothing but solos by Famoudou Don
Moye, the "Sun Percussion" king. In
an innovative transformation, the
song becomes yet another jazz track
but with the percussion playing the

improvisational lines over a regular
and relatively stagnant brass accom
paniment.
It's hard to predict if the Art En
semble of Chicago will be around for
a fourth decade. While most of its
material fails to break any musical

boundaries, its members patriotically
remind the listener of where black
music is now and where it has been.
Rather than try to prophesize where
music will go, the Art Ensemble ot
Chicago inspires all musicians to
simply "keep the music strong."

but as the points converged, song
seed flowed through us and is here
shared after 50 years (1934 to 1984)
patiently waiting to be sown and
delivered, as if by chance to drift into
the ear of the sons, who understand
ing the prophet, embrace the flower
and offer it with love."
"The Bell Piece" has perhaps the
most interesting origin: "As the
peoples of the Earth move into the
21st century, where hi-tech moves
them deeper and deeper into realms
of the unknown, visions of the ancient
chime and bell remind us of the lyri
cal power that remains at the heart of
mankind's quest for fulfillment."
Really? Although perhaps a bit
presumptuous, the song combines
wild sax solos and Fripp/Summers
guitar-like sounds to form a thought
provoking piece more like a movie
score than a Chuck Mangione pop
tune.
The album closes with a rhythm
layered rock track entitled, appropri

ately enough, "Third Decade." The
first half of the eight-minute song is
nothing but solos by Famoudou Don
Moye, the "Sun Percussion" king. In
an innovative transformation, the
song becomes yet another jazz track
but with the percussion playing the

improvisational lines over a regular
and relatively stagnant brass accom
paniment.
It's hard to predict if the Art En
semble of Chicago will be around for
a fourth decade. While most of its
material fails to break any musical

boundaries, its members patriotically
remind the listener of where black
music is now and where it has been.
Rather than try to prophesize where
music will go, the Art Ensemble ot
Chicago inspires all musicians to
simply "keep the music strong."


"The Third Decade" is the latest album of Art Ensemble of Chicago, a quintet of Black jazz musicians who at
tempt "to circulate consciousness" in their music.
