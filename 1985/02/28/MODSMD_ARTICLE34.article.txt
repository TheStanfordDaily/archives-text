# 'Tartuffe': delightul and witty
## 
### MARY POINDEXTER 
When I mentioned to a friend that I had an extra
ticket to West Valley College's presentation of
"Tartuffe," his reaction was less than enthusiastic.
"A 17th-century French comedy about religious
hypocrisy? No, thank you." An understandable re
action, and one 1 am sure many would share.
However, don't succumb to first impressions and
make the mistake of passing up this opportunity to
see a delightful production of Moliere's"Tartuffe."
The play is set in 17th-century France, in the ele
gant home of Monsieur Orgon, a member of the
French aristocracy. Monsieur Tartuffe is intro
duced and quickly revealed as an imposter and
swindler, cloaked in false piety and spiritual zeal.
Using this guise, he dupes Monsieur Orgon into
worshipping him and relinquishing all his worldly
goods to Tartuffe. Believing that Tartuffe is ab
solutely pure and chaste. Monsieur Orgon dis
regards family protests and refuses to accept their
accusations until he has personally witnessed Tar
tuffe's abhorrent behavior. This of course leads to
Monsieur Orgon's disillusionment, and finally to
fear of Tartuffe's financial power over the family.
The plot lends itself to many humorous situa

tions, and the cast takes full advantage of each one.
Larry Barrott as the fraudulent Tartuffe is very
believeable as he switches instantaneously from
pious sufferer to wicked imposter. He possesses a
marvelous sense of comic timing in addition to a
very expressive face and body, and his use of both
results in many of the most humorous scenes in the
play. Jennifer Cachopo gives another striking per
formance as Dorine, a lady's maid. With a brassy
voice and impudent manner, she uses the sarcastic
dialogue to create a no-nonsense, likeable charac
ter. Anthony Harding as Monsieur Orgon, the rash,
obstinate patriarch, is effectively overbearing, but
he often lacks variety in his tone and thus his
responses become rather monotonous. However,
other strong performances include those of Joshua
Marchesi as Cleante, Orgon's brother-in-law, and
Sheila Savage as Elmire, Orgon's wife. Both pres
ent convincing characters who convey clear pur
pose and intention without overacting or
self-dramatizing. Some of the lesser characters do
not achieve that as well; their motives at times
seem uncertain.
Overall, the play is very entertaining and engag
ing. My only criticism is that it occasionally

becomes slapstick and resorts to cheap gags to get a
laugh. It is unfortunate that such means are used,
because the talented actors and the witty dialogue
alone would be capable of creating an enjoyable
comedy.
In spite of this, "Tartuffe" is a success. The play
is very well-staged, easy to listen to and a pleasure
to watch. Surprisingly, it requires little effort to
become accustomed to the dialogue spoken in
verse, and, in fact, after the first scene it seems al
most essential. In addition, the play successfully
captures the wit and energy of Moliere necessary to
embody its lively and whimsical nature. Most im
portant, though, there are many moments of both
inspired acting and saucy humor, and on that basis I
recommend that you take some time out and see
this fresh, humorous version of "Tartuffe." By the
way, my skeptical friend who accompanied me was
glad that he did.
"Tartuffe" will be presented tomorrow and Sat
urday at 8:15 p.m. and Sunday at 7:30 p.m. at West
Valley College Theater, 14000 Fruitvale Ave., in
Saratoga.


Anthony Harding plays Mssr. Orgon and Larry Barrott plays Tartuffe
