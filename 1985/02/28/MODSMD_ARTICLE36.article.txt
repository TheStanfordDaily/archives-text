# Good acting makes ' The Elephant Man' a powerful drama

### KARY ANTHOLIS 
Theme is secondary to human
drama in Bernard Pomerance's "The
Elephant Man." The primacy of the
drama is effectively captured by the
Theatreworks production at the
Burgess Theatre in Menlo Park.
Nevertheless, Pomerance's play
lends itself to thematic interpretation.
One cannot leave the Burgess
rheatre without thinking about our
attempts to impose our conceptions
of pu r ity on people whom we find
impure. "The Elephant Man" reflects
our insensitivity to the effects of these
attempts â€” pain and dehumaniza
tion.
"The Elephant Man" is based on
the life of John Merrick. Merrick was
a hideously disformed man who lived
in Oueen Victoria's England. During
the early part of his life, he was ex

ploited as a carnival freak. In 1884.
he was adopted by a prominent
British surgeon, Frederick Treves,
who cared for him in London Hospi
tal. While at London Hospital, Mer
rick was visited by a number of
eminent Victorians, all of whom
found him extraordinarily intelligent
and sensitive.
Yet as the playbill notes," 'The El
ephant Man' goes beyond docu
drama." The play renders an acutely
emotional image of a man at the limit
of his being. Pomerance calls for the
role of Merrick to be played without
makeup. He requires the actor to
contort his body in a way which sim
ulates Merrick's disformities. The ac
tor must try to capture the audience's
imagination of Merrick's physical
ugliness, while seeking to gain its
respect for Merrick's remarkable en

durance. Anthony Haney is excellent
in the role. Haney. a black actor,
brings a racial dimension to the play,
yet that dimension is appropriately

One cannot leave the theater without
thinking about our attempts to impose
our conceptions of purity on people
whom we find impure.

understated, as Haney convincingly
creates the illusion of a beautiful,
witty man trapped within an ugly
body.
In a scene which captures the es
sence of the Merrick character.

Treves interviews for the position of
nursing Merrick. The applicant claims
that she has seen the worst of disfor
mities and offers to take Merrick his

lunch for their first meeting. Treves
insists that he take the lunch this one
time. The applicant then goes to meet
Merrick. Upon seeing him, she
becomes nauseous and runs from the
room, appalled at the thought of nur-

sing this "monster." Merrick
responds to the situation with good
humor. "Thank you for saving the
lunch tiiis time," he says. Haney
delivers the line with meek wit and
the moment is perfect.
Pomerance focuses on Merrick's
relationship with three people: Ross,
his exploitive manager; Treves;
and Mrs. Kendall, a clever and caring
actress. Ross expresses all of the
anger which we might expect from
Merrick. He believes that God and
society have dealt him an unfair lot in
life, and he sees it as his right to be a
"pimp" in a world of "whores." Erik
Alenz gives an adequate performance
as Ross, though he is a bit too bois
terous and his fits of consumptive
coughing sometimes seem contrived.
Pomerance writes Treves as an au
thoritarian over-achiever who, in

caring for Merrick, also confines the
Elephant Man's spirit. Tom Woos
nam effectively expresses Treves'
prudishness.
Sandy Hoffman plays Mrs. Kendall
with grace and well-timed wit. Her
scenes with Haney are tender and
seem to capture the essence of
Pomerance's script. In a climactic
scene, Merrick laments his never
having seen a naked woman. In an act
of profound trust and kindness, Mrs.
Kendall reveals her breasts to Mer
rick. Hoffman and Haney render the
scene with the understated charm
which marks the entire production, it
is the key to the "Elephant Man's"
success.
"The Elephant Man" plays
through Sunday at the Burgess
Theatre in Menlo Park.
