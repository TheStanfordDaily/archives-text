## University to have access to â€˜Supercomputer' 
### GEORGE LeMAITRE Staff writer 
Stanford will have access to a federally
sponsored "supercomputer" located at the
UC-San Diego, the National Science Founda
tion (NSF) announced Monday.
The San Diego facility will be part of a
$200 million program sponsored by the NSF
to promote non-military research at the na
tion's universities.
The program is perceived by many as an at
tempt to keep the United States from falling
behind Japan and Europe in computer re
search. This project is the government's larg
est non-military effort to date in supercom
puters.
Princeton, Cornell and the University of Il
linois will also receive supercomputers.
Each of these four systems will be tied to a

number of other universities. Stanford will
join 17 other schools in a consortium based
on the San Diego computer.
The advantage of supercomputers is their
speed. Most can process in days what tradi
tional mainframe computers take years to do.
Currently, however, most of the supercom
puters in the United States are owned by the
government for military research and are un
available to private and academic sectors.
San Diego's supercomputer is scheduled to
begin operation in one-and-a-half years, said
Susan Lansdale, assistant to the vice provost
for Academic Computing and Information
Systems (ACIS) at Stanford. However, both
Lansdale and Mike Roberts, deputy director
of Information Technology Services (ITS),
agree that a linkup between the supercom
puter and Stanford by then is doubtful.
Direct linkup with San Diego, however, is

inevitable, Roberts said. "This has got to hap
pen. It is not a question of whether this will be
done, but rather when.
"The whole (computer) process is getting
very powerful; it's just a matter of time before
we get a linkup," he said.
Lansdale said a number of systems, includ
ing a satellite hookup, are currently being
studied.
Until a linkup is worked out, however,
Stanford researchers will have to settle for
going to San Diego to use the supercomputer.
"We'll be able to use it soon . . . and we'll
be able to use it better later " Lansdale said.
Stanford researchers needing speedy com
puting currently use the supercomputer at the
National Center for Atmospheric Research in
Boulder, Colo. There are supercomputer
facilities located in Los Alamos, N.M., and

Livermore, but Roberts said Stanford re
searchers do not use these because defense
related research is conducted there.
The advantage to the San Diego supercom
puter is that system time will be free to mem
bers of the consortium, whereas it is expen
sive in Boulder, Lansdale said.
The research benefiting most from the su
percomputer will be in electrical engineering,
mechanical engineering, geophysics, plasma
physics, petroleum engineering and computer
science, Lansdale said.
Lansdale said a "supercomputer working
group composed of faculty is analyzing how to
most effectively use this (supercomputer)."
"Basically, it will benefit anyone who
manages lots of numerical data and who does
a lot of number-crunching and simulations,"
she said.

Lansdale said the allotted research time
would be almost entirely dedicated to faculty
research, noting that "it would be extremely
unlikely that an undergraduate would need
the supercomputer."
Stanford never applied to be one of the
supercomputer sites, Lansdale said, because
"we just weren't particularly interested in
taking on the responsibilities."
"Getting the supercomputer is a mixed
blessing," Roberts said. "It would require
Stanford to provide the project with land and
research space. And we are very short on re
search space."
Other California schools in the San Diego
consortium include UC-San Francisco,
UCLA, the California Institute of Technology
and San Diego State. San Diego's computer
will also be used by schools outside Califor
nia.
