# History prof. links '60s activism to '80s
## Frustrated activists turn to Reaganism 
### BARBARA SCHULER Staff writer 
"Extremism in defense of liberty is
no vice. . . . Moderation in pursuit of
justice is no virtue," History Prof.
Clay Carson said yesterday, quoting
Barry Goldwater's 1964 GOP con
vention speech.
But Carson added, "If you follow
the far left far enough, you run into
the far right."
Carson's talk, "Reaganism: A
Legacy of the '60s?" examined the
roots of 1980s conservatism in the so
cial activism of two decades ago.
Carson said the dichotomy be
tween the individual and the group
caused rifts in the civil-rights and the
anti-war movements. He classifies the
two major factions as "hard-liners"
and "freedom-high types."

The latter, whose creed was to
"follow your conscience wherever it
leads you." found "centralized au
thority within radical movements an
tithetical" and unacceptable, accord
ing to Carson.
Disaffection led many of these
"individualists" away from the task of
social reform on a grand scale, and
toward more localized, personalized
politics. Carson cited as one example
the emphasis of the women's move
ment on consciousness-raising.

While many '60s activists "dropped
out," the majority altered their goals,
setting their sights on "self
improvement" rather than societal
transformation. Describing their po
sition, Carson said, "If you can't
change the world, at least you can
change yourself to get along better in
it."
The "personal improvement move
ments" of the '70s "fed right into the
conservatism of the '80s. .. . The em
phasis on individual change and the
belief that if you're a failure in Amer
ican society, it's because you haven't
prepared yourself to be a success" not
only "fits very well into conservative
rhetoric," according to Carson, "but
also grows out of the '70s thrust
toward self-improvement."
A strong anti-government senti
ment also unites the two eras, Carson
pointed out. " The 'freedom-high' po
sition in opposition to the centralized
state fed into the movement of anti
federalism which the right-wing has
picked up." he said.
Carson contends the Reagan
landslide did not occur "because
(voters) favor Reagan's policies. . . .
but because he spoke in a vocabulary
that has deep appeal in American so
ciety and that goes beyond traditional
political boundaries."
Carson also said, however, that
while Reagan appears to champion
the individual, "he is for corporate
America and its collective needs. He
is not for individual freedom, al
though the rhetoric is there."
Carson talked about the consis
tency of Republican politics over the
past twenty years, pointing out that
the landslide defeat of Goldwater did
not causc a move further left. The
Republicans "have remained
ideologically consistent since 1964.
but they've brought the country with
them and now they run the show." he
said.
He suggested the Democrats could
learn from this example. "Those who
oppose Reagan have to be very clear
about what they'd like the country to
be like in 20 years. Searching after a
majority, trying to discover what is
popular at the moment is a self
defeating strategy."
