# ASSU senator resigns
## 
### MICHAEL GOFF Editorial staff 
Sophomore Jay Alter has become the sixth
ASSU senator to resign this year.
Alter had talked often this quarter of resign
ing from the senate, complaining that there has
been little direction to the senators from the
leadership of the ASSU.
"Senators are outsiders in their own organi
zation," he told The Daily in a prepared state
ment last night. He said he holds the Council of
Presidents and Senate Chair Eric Berg respon
sible for leaving senators out of the decision
making by preserving control over all the duties
involved with running the ASSU.
Berg disagrees. According to Berg, senators
play an integral role in the performance of the
ASSU's three major working areas â€” services
to students, representation of the concerns of
.the student body and legislation on student
needs.
Alter handed Berg a scrap of paper with his
one sentence resignation on it Tuesday evening

at the senate meeting. The note said Alters res
ignation was effective immediately and that he
had "more productive uses" for his time.
Alter told I he Daily in a phone interview last
night that his resignation is not due to academic
reasons or other extracurricular interests but
because the legislation performed by the senate
"is worse than doing nothing at all."
Berg told The Daily last night that he as
sumes Alter's priorities are not with the senate.
Alter must think "the time he spends on Club
Big Way is more productive" than his work for
the ASSU, Berg said.
Alter currently spearheads Club Big Way, a
campus philanthropic organization.
At the senate meeting Tuesday evening, "Jay
was one of a number of senators that came in at
the beginning of the meeting to try to get the
agenda changed so they could vote on what they
were interested in at the beginning of the
meeting," Berg said.
