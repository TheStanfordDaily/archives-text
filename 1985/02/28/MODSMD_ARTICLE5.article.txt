# ASSU senator resigns
## 
### MICHAEL GOFF Editorial staff 
Sophomore Jay Alter has become the sixth
ASSU senator to resign this year.
Alter had talked often this quarter of resign
ing from the senate, complaining that there has
been little direction to the senators from the
leadership of the ASSU.
"Senators are outsiders in their own organi
zation," he told The Daily in a prepared state
ment last night. He said he holds the Council of
Presidents and Senate Chair Eric Berg respon
sible for leaving senators out of the decision
making by preserving control over all the duties
involved with running the ASSU.
Berg disagrees. According to Berg, senators
play an integral role in the performance of the
ASSU's three major working areas â€” services
to students, representation of the concerns of
.the student body and legislation on student
needs.
Alter handed Berg a scrap of paper with his
one sentence resignation on it Tuesday evening

at the senate meeting. The note said Alters res
ignation was effective immediately and that he
had "more productive uses" for his time.
Alter told I he Daily in a phone interview last
night that his resignation is not due to academic
reasons or other extracurricular interests but
because the legislation performed by the senate
"is worse than doing nothing at all."
Berg told The Daily last night that he as
sumes Alter's priorities are not with the senate.
Alter must think "the time he spends on Club
Big Way is more productive" than his work for
the ASSU, Berg said.
Alter currently spearheads Club Big Way, a
campus philanthropic organization.
At the senate meeting Tuesday evening, "Jay
was one of a number of senators that came in at
the beginning of the meeting to try to get the
agenda changed so they could vote on what they
were interested in at the beginning of the
meeting," Berg said.

Jay Alter has become the sixth senator to resign from
the ASSU Senate this school year.
"Shortly after we finished voting
on the thing he (Alter) was interested
in, he left the meeting and handed me
a note saying he was resigning," he
said.
Berg said he feels Alter "showed a
cavalier and callous attitude toward
his collegues."
Alter's statement yesterday ex
plained in more detail his reasons for
his dissatisfaction with the senate.
"It has become clear to me during
my tenure that a primary purpose of
the senate is not to help student prob
lems nor is it to be creative and
develop new services to benefit stu
dents; rather, its primary function is
writing bylaws, constitutional amend
ments, referendums, recalls and
reports in order to control its internal
operation," Alter said.

He then continued with an attack
on the basic structure of the senate.
Alter said the activity of the ASSU is
"not at all constructive. It is wasteful.
It wastes the senate's energy, the stu
dents' money, and space in The
Daily. This internal legislative over
kill is crippling. The ASSU's great
potential for contribution to the Stan
ford community is being smothered
by a massive self-created bur
eaucracy."
Berg said, however, that the
"senate has managed a number of ac
complishments this year in terms of
services to students." According to
Berg, these include senate action in
the areas of post office problems,
check cashing availability and ex
tended hours for the Marguerite
shuttle service.
Citing this year's South African
legislation as the direct result of work
by Senator Mark Landesmann, Berg
spoke of a concerted effort on the
part of the chair and the COP to

"ensure that the senate has made all
of the real policy decisions."
Berg told The Daily yesterday that
there would be no major structural
changes in the senate Ss a result of the
recent rash of resignations. Accord
ing to Berg, minutes of the Feb. 14,
1984 senate meeting report that at
the same time last year 12 senators had
resigned or been dropped for not
showing up at meetings.
George Ramos resigned from the
senate in the fall when he stopped out
of school; Roland van Galen resigned
earlier this quarter for academic
reasons; Bob Slater left this quarter,
saying other time commitments
would force him to perform his job
half-heartedly; Gloria Johnson said
she would leave last week because
she wasn't able to represent minority
opinions in the senate as effectively as
she had hoped; and Derek Passarelli
resigned last week, saying he didn't
"believe the ASSU does anything
useful."
