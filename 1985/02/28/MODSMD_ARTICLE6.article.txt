# Panel tackles U.S. deficit problem
## 
### MARK LAWRENCE Staff writer 
Five Stanford professors discussed
their opinions on U.S. financial issues
and presented possible solutions to
the national budget deficit last night
in a panel discussion entitled "Trade,
Deficit and the Dollar: the Econom
ics of Foreign Policy."
The participating professors were
Ronald McKinnon and Bert Hick
man. Economics Department, Scott
Pearson of the Food Research In
stitute and Stephen Krasner and
Judith Goldstein of the Political Sci
ence Department.
Pearson began the discussion by
providing the gathering of 20 with the
economic background neccessary to
understand the problem of the na
tional deficit.
He explained that the United
States government, in order to
finance its debt, offers high interest
rates in return for domestic and inter
national loans. Hickman said,' There
is an intimate relationship between
what happens to the deficit and what
happens to interest rates.
The high interest rates offered by
the government attract many interna
tional investors. The rates then create
a dollar that is valued "50 percent too
high." according to McKinnon.
The overvalued dollar, Pearson
continued, results in decreased U.S.
exports because foreign countries must
now pay high prices for lI.S. gomls.

The high value of the dollar also
creates great difficulties for poorer
nations, who have to pay more to
finance their debts to the United
States, he said.
Pearson stressed the delicate na
ture of the present situation. "If the
whole thing goes bust, the United
States economy will drag down poor
countries with it,"he said.
Krasner continued. "Having the
dollar at such a high value is not a
very attractive proposition."
In addition to the problems created
lor Third World nations, he detailed
the problem faced by American cor
porations with foreign markets."The
United States has turned itself into a
debtor nation. For the first time in 50
years, we're an importer nation," he
said.
The panelists were all in basic
agreement on the causes of the finan
cial problems. However, they differed
sharply in their proposed solutions.
Following statements by each profes
sor. an impromptu debate began
among the panelists in response to
questions from the audience.
Hickman suggested that the United
States should "be pursuing a tighter
fiscal policy."
By increasing taxes or decreasing
spending — both possible answers to
the deficit problem — "you get a
smaller deficit and lower interest
rates, but at the expense of economic
productivity." he cautioned.

Goldstein proposed that the
United States try to model itself after
its trading partners and allow more
government regulation of business.
"We have lost control of our own
economy," she said.
U.S. institutions are currently
"very poorly equipped to deal with

this set of problems." she added. "In
the United States, we have no control
apparatus to deal with problems of
trade. We think free trade is good, in
tervention is bad. but the things we
sec as legitimate for a government to
do may not be productive in coming
years," she said.
