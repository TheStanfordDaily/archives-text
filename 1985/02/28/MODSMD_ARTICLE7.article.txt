Lebanese troops, Israeli patrol clash
BEIRUT, Lebanon — army troops opened fire on an Israeli
patrol that had ventured across newly drawn front lines yesterday and
clashed with a tank-supported Israeli force, hitting two of its armored
personnel carriers, local journalists in southern Lebanon said.
Thfc Lebanese army command said that the Israeli patrol advanced to
the village of Kawthariyet Siyad, located northeast of Tyre and about
two miles west of Israel's latest defense line as it runs north from the
Litani River to the western part of the Bekaa Valley.
Lebanese army troops opened fire, forcing the Israeli patrol to halt,
the Lebanese command said. The Israelis then moved up a motorized
patrol supported by tanks, and the two sides exchanged fire until the Is
raelis withdrew after an hour and a half, according to the Lebanese com
mand. The Lebanese statement listed no army casualties but said one ci
vilian was wounded,
Israeli military officials said the incident took place within the Israeli
controlled area. According to the Israeli account, an Israeli foot patrol
east of Kawthariyet Siyad fired at "two terrorists armed with an AK-47
rifle and rocket-propelled grenades who were advancing toward our
forces." When a Lebanese army unit responded by firing at the patrol
from the village, the Israeli officials said, the patrol "took cover and
waited for the Lebanese to cease fire. Since the Lebanese continued to
fire," the patrol fired "several bursts" and later "a single tank round was
fired as a warning . , . aimed wide so as not to hit the Lebanese," Israeli
officials said.
This month's pullback by Israeli troops to the Litani, though largely
credited to guerrilla operations against Israeli soldiers and their local
allies, has heartened the Lebanese army command and buoyed its confi
dence in extending its much challenged authority.
Mubarak optimistic on Israeli talks
CAIRO, Egypt — President Hosni Mubarak said yesterday he was
relatively encouraged by a continuing flurry of high-level contacts be
tween Egypt and Israel and called on the United States to lend its weight
to new Middle East peace efforts.
"The United States is a superpower. The United States cannot con
tinue to sit with its hands folded" as both Israel and moderate Pales
tinians show increased flexibility, the Egyptian leader said in an inter
view. Moments before, he had received an Israeli Cabinet minister and
shortly afterward he dispatched the third envoy he has sent to Israeli
Prime Minister Shimon Peres in the past week.
The developing dialogue is the most serious Israeli-Egyptian exchange
since the 1982 invasion of Lebanon cast a pall over the U.S.-sponsored
peace treaty that links the two former enemies and caused Egypt to halt
high-level contacts with Israel. Mubarak said the exchange had helped
persuade him that Peres "wants to be much more flexible" in seeking
peace than were his predecessors, Menachem Begin and Yitzhak
Shamir.
in the wide-ranging interview, one of a series of press declarations
Mubarak is making as he prepares for an official visit to Washington in
10 days, the Egyptian president specified that the exchanges with Peres
primarily concern "bilateral relations" between the two countries, in
cluding deadlocked negotiations over the return of a four-acre strip of
land at Taba, a coastal resort on the Gulf of Aqaba, to Egyptian
sovereignty.
The Egyptian leader's remarks made clear, however, that he sees a
fresh opportunity to improve relations with Israel created by the arrival
of the Labor Party's Peres at the top of a coalition government, the
beginning of a complete Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon and move
ment by the Palestine Liberation Organization toward a full acceptance
of Israel.
Mubarak expects to arrive in Washington on March 9 also bolstered
by a meeting next Wednesday in Egypt with Jordan's, King Hussein,
whom p*res has offered'"fa"m'etrfbr thl'tralSWnto '
Israeli-occupied West Bank. ' _
Soviets say U.S. 'poisoning' talks
MOSCOW — The Soviet Union yesterday accused the United States
of undercutting hopes for success in next month's arms talks in Geneva
with "slanderous" charges of Soviet violations of past arms-control
agreements.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Lomeiko said at a press brief
ing here that the Soviet Embassy in Washington had protested an ad
ministration report Feb. 1 accusing the Soviet Union of "a clear viola
tion" of the 1972 antiballistic missile (ABM) treaty.
"The unsubstantiated and groundless charges in the White House
'report' have been categorically rejected," Lomeiko said in a prepared
statement.
He said the timing of the report, six weeks before the start of new
negotiations on weapons reductions, was designed "with the clear intent
to poison from the outset the atmosphere surrounding those talks, to
hamper businesslike and constructive consideration of the issues to be
resolved."
The United States and the Soviet Union agreed in early January to
start new arms talks, covering strategic, medium-range and space-based
weapons. Those talks are scheduled to begin March 12 in Geneva.
Although yesterday's statement ran through a list of Soviet complaints
and questions about the U.S. approach to the talks, it did not rule out
prospects for progress at the bargaining table.
Syrians hijack German airliner
VIENNA, Austria — Two Syrians being deported from West Ger
many today hijacked a Lufthansa airliner carrying 43 people on a flight
from Frankfurt to Damascus and forced it to land at the Schwechat Air
port. officials said.
Twenty-one passengers were released from the Boeing 727 after an
hour of negotiations between the hijackers and Lufthansa officials, said
airport spokeswoman Hildegard Ehmsen. Those released included 16
men, four women and a child, who were taken to a closed-off waiting
room.
She said the other 14 passengers and eight crew members remained
onboard.
The hijackers were believed armed with knives and a broken bottle,
and were threatening two flight attendants, Schwechat Airport authori
ties said. ,
One of the hijackers told negotiators "if somebody approaches less
than 150 meters (yards) the captain will be killed," according to Ger
hard Kastelic, an airport spokesman.
Hans Birkenbeul, spokesman for the Berlin Interior Ministry,
declined to identify the two by name or say why they were being
deported.
Birkenbeul said the two Syrians boarded the plane under guard, but
were left unguarded once aboard because "it is a direct flight to
Damascus, and that's why a guard wasn't necessary."
Pope, Gromyko exchange views
VATICAN, — Pope John Paul and Soviet foreign minister, Andrei
Gromyko, held an apparently cordial conversation for nearly two hours
yesterday about world peace and "situation" of Catholics in the Soviet
Union.
Neither side gave details of the unusually long audience. It was John
Paul's first with a Kremlin official since the martial law crackdown in his
native Poland in 1981 and the attempt on his life, which some reports
have linked to the Soviet secret police.
Gromyko. 75, got a rcd-carpet welcome for his first visit to the
Vatican in six years. He said it was a "good" meeting, and that the ques
tion of a papal visit to the Soviet Union did not come up.
Presenting his gift of a small lacquered box to John Paul, Gromyko
said, "It's a small memento, as the Americans say."
Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro said only that the two men dis
cussed "peace in the world and the situation of Catholics in the Soviet
Union."
Advance expectations were that Gromyko would seek papal support
for the Kremlin campaign against President Reagan's space-based
defense proposal, commonly called Star Wars, and that John Paul would
press his guest about religious liberty in the Soviet Union.
