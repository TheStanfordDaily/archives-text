# Battle erupts over Nicaraguan aid
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” The fight over further U.S.
aid to Nicaraguan rebels intensified yesterday as
the Reagan administration accused the leftist San
dinista government of waging a "show-and-tell
propaganda offensive" and Democratic congress
men, in turn, accused the administration of "red
baiting" and "demagoguery."
At the White House, spokesman Larry Speakes
heaped scorn on the "so-called peace initiative" of
Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, who invited a
bipartisan U.S. congressional delegation to visit his
country "without restrictions" to see that military
preparations there are "strictly defensive." In
words similar to those used recently by President
Reagan, Speakes said that while Ortega was talking
peace, the Nicaraguan government was consolidat
ing "a totalitarian Marxist-Leninist state in this
hemisphere."
Meanwhile, Secretary of State George Shultz
became involved in an extraordinary confrontation
with a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee at a
hearing where critics complained that the adminis
tration was equating a vote against covert aid with a
vote for communism in Central America.
"You have a lot of nerve to come before this
committee and criticize the members of this com
mittee for being demagogues," Rep. Peter
Kostmayer (D-Pa.) told Shultz after several rounds
of stormy testimony. "It is really, after all, you and
the president that began this escalation of rhetoric.
. . . There has been a lot of red-baiting going on in
the administration. I think it began at the White
House and I hope it will end very soon."
At the same hearing another committee mem
ber, Rep. Ted Weiss (D-N.Y.) accused Shultz of
"twisting facts, distorting facts and misstating
facts" about Nicaragua and compared Shultz's tac
tics to those used by the late Sen. Joseph

McCarthy. Shultz, red-faced and angry, called the
charge "the ultimate perversion" and refused to
answer further questions from Weiss until he
apologized, which he later did.
This confrontation came on a day when a
prominent administration official acknowledged
that the administration lacks the votes in the House
to win approval of $14 million that it seeks in aid
for the rebels, whom the president calls "freedom
fighters" and has referred to as "our brothers."
Langhorne (Tony) Motley, the State Depart
ment's chief Latin American expert, said in answer
to a reporter's question at a White House briefing
that it was "a fair assessment" to say that the ad
ministration lacked the support in the House to
overturn a congressional prohibition on aid to the
rebels.
Motley added that the administration intends to
abide "strictly" by the prohibition against direct or
indirect aid to the rebels unless Congress can be
persuaded to reverse itself.
Officials who discussed the administration's
strategy on condition they not be identified said
that Reagan and Shultz were "trying to turn the
heat up" on Congress but would not move ahead
with a formal request for aid to the rebels until
after key votes in March on another priority issue,
the MX missile.
These officials said the president was trying to
put public pressure on Congress in behalf of pro
viding aid to the rebels, but added that administra
tion officials probably would not press for a vote
before "the April-May time frame" because they
currently lack support in the House. Congressional
opposition to aiding the rebels is so great that the
administration has refused to discuss a lesser al
ternative, which one official said would mean
"certain defeat" for any plan reviving aid to the

rebels.
In keeping with this campaign to generate hack
ing for a policy that currently lacks widespread
public support, Speakes yesterday used the daily
White House briefing to attack Ortega's letter call
ing for renewed peace talks with the United States.
"We would welcome any new peace proposal
that would meet our concerns," he said. "They (the
Sandinistas) know about concerns over their mili
tary buildup, their subversion of their neighbors,
their Cuban and Soviet-bloc ties and their repres
sion of their people, the church, the press and the
democratic elements within the country. In our
view, an appropriate peace offensive by them
would be one that contains concrete actions to
meet these concerns rather than a show-and-tell
propaganda offensive. ..."
While the administration lobbied for public sup
port, Nicaragua conducted its own campaign for
congressional backing. Congressional sources said
that Deputy Foreign Minister Hugo Tinoco had
visited at least 10 congressmen to discuss Ortega's
latest proposal for a congressional group to visit his
country and set the stage for renewed U.S.-
Nicaraguan talks.
Motley was sharply critical of this lobbying,
saying that Tinoco was behaving in highly irregular
fashion because he had not even talked to the State
Department during his several days in Washington.
Ortega's letter is scheduled to be made public on
Friday in Montevideo, where both he and Shultz
will be for the inauguration of Uruguay's new pres
ident. Congressional sources said the letter outlines
what the Nicaraguans regard as concessions on
such points as the elimination of foreign military
advisers and procedures for verifying the Sandi
nista contention that arms are not being sent to the
guerrillas opposing the government of El Salvador.
