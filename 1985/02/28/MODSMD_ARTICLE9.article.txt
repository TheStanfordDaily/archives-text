# Farmers hold rally
## 
### 
AMES, lowa — About 15,000
angry Midwestern farmers staged one
of the largest farm protest rallies in
American history yesterday, filling a
giant basketball fieldhouse that thun
dered with jeers and boos at the men
tion of President Reagan and budget
director David Stockman.
The four-hour rally at the Hilton
Coliseum at lowa State University
opened with prayers asking for salva
tion from a "calloused administra
tion" and ended with chants of "we
will win."
"Let this meeting serve notice on
Washington that a crisis exists and
federal assistance is needed now,"
said Minnesota banker Pat Dubois to
a standing ovation.
"It is unacceptable . . . when those
chosen to govern blame those who
produce food ... for their inability or
unwillingness to govern properly,"
Cy Carpenter, National Farmers
Union president, told the gathering,
the second largest of its kind since thq
turn of the century.
"Reagan Policy: Let Them Eat
Cake" read one banner not far from a
hanging effegy of Stockman. The
budget director, the son of Michigan
farmers, has enraged rural mid-
America with his stand against addi
tional federal aid to help farmers
plant crops this spring.
One sign, referring to the U.S. Sec
retary of Agriculture, read "Get rid
of John 'Auction 1 Block." Another
read "Farms not Arms," and one
simply asked "Why Us, Lord?"
The rally was distinguished by the
absence of politicians on the podium.
lowa's Gov. Terry Branstad and two
thirds of the members of the lowa
legislature sat on the sidelines while a
parade of farmers, farm protest

leaders, union members and commu
nity leaders addressed the crowd.
At one point, one speaker asked
how many farmers were in
foreclosure or on the brink of it.
Hundreds of hands in the audience
went up.
A coalition of farm and rural or
ganizations— ranging from moderate
to militant, and often unable to agree
in the past — joined to call the rally
to draw national attention to eco
nomic conditions which are driving
farmers off the land and threatening
many mid-America rural communit
ies with extinction.
"This is not just a farm rally. We
are talking about the rising up of the
American heartland," said Jon
Wefald. chancellor of the Minnesota
state university system and a former
state agriculture commissioner.
"This marks an historic turning
point for rural America," added
Dixon Terry, a leader of the lowa
Farm Unity Coalition. "We're ready
to fight back, to organize to protect
our business and our way of life.
"Within 48 hours, news of this rally
will be in the living room of every
home in America," National Farmers
Organization President DeVon
Woodland said as he looked at 25
television cameras and hundreds of
reporters and photographers on hand
to record the event.
Bishop Maurice Dingman, the
head of the Roman Catholic diocese
of Des Moines and the decendent of a
pioneering lowa farm family, told the
crowd, "I come before you today to
tell you that if we do nothing, the
bells will have tolled for the end of an
American dream."
