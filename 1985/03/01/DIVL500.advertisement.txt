II The Technology Of Tomorrow? I
|| Testing Tomorrow's Technology Today... I
II Megatest is a leader in the ATE industry be- I
II cause we are a leader in developing computer tech- I
II nology. Semiconductor companies cannot develop I
|| and design the integrated circuitry of the future I
II without tools to test the devices. These test tools I
11 must be very powerful super-mini computers with ■
11 firmware and software that push the limits of exist- I
II ing technology. In the last nine years we have in- ■
II vested in hiring some of the best engineers in the H
II world to help us push these limits. The results H
II have been tremendous: sales doubling almost I
II every two years, sales offices around the world ■
II and the US, growth from a two-man operation in ■
II 1975 to over 450 people in 1984. 1
11 But we have not forgotten the key to our sue- m
II cess: talented people. Megatest believes excel- I
I lence will grow at a company that values trust I
| and friendship as an operating philosophy. We I
| promote this philosophy by keeping company deci- I
| sions in the open not in the board room, by keep- I
| ing engineering teams small, and rewarding results I
I over form. We firmly believe office politics and 9
| status symbols are counterproductive to our goals. ■
| If you believe as we do, that your job should ■
| be exciting and fun, watch for future Megatest ads I
| that will describe in more detail about our jobs for ■
I college graduates. Don't forget to view our video H
