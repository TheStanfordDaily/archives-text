Jury charges governor
WASHINGTON — Louisiana Gov. Edwin
Edwards, who has described himself as the most
investigated governor in his state's corruption
plagued history, was indicted by a federal grand
jury yesterday on charges of using the state's
highest office to benefit himself and former busi
ness associates.
Edwards, 57, a third-term Democrat, had
proclaimed his innocence in advance of the grand
jury's action and depicted himself as the
"political" victim of U.S. Attorney John Volz in
New Orleans, a Republican. He becomes the
third governor to be indicted while in office in the
last 50 years and has vowed that he will not step
down.
The 51-count indictment accused Edwards and
six other men, including his brother, Marion, 56,
and his nephew, Charles David Isbell, 40, of a
racketeering conspiracy and wire and mail fraud
in a multimillion-dollar hospital and nursing
home development scheme.
The alleged conspiracy began Feb. 10, 1982,
when Edwards, then out of office and between
terms as governor, joined with two, other defen
dants in forming an enterprise to obtain certif
icates for corporations to build federally aided
health care facilities.
The two others were Ronald Falgout, 45, vice
president of Health Services Development Corp.,
who was a state Health and Human Resources
official in an earlier Edwards administration, and
James Wyllie, 36, president of Health Services
Development.

Edwards, Falgout and Wyllie, aided by the
other defendants, would sell the corporations
that obtained the health care facility certificates
to persons interested in building such facilities in
Louisiana, the grand jury charged.
Edwards' true involvement in the enterprise
was concealed to utilize the powers and influence
of his position as governor, according to the in
dictment. Edwards was elected to his third term
on Oct. 22, 1983 and took office the following
March 12.
Between February 1982 and now, the enter
prise obtained certificates for 15 medical centers,
hospitals and nursing homes.
The governor received $1.95 million through
the enterprise, and Falgout and Wyllie, more
than $2.6 million each, according to the indict
ment.
Edwards, who was not charged in six previous
grand jury investigations, has often been in legal
difficulties during his stormy political career. He
is also under investigation by a federal grand jury
in Baton Rouge on matters unrelated to yester
day's indictment, according to law enforcement
sources.
Goetz case considered
NEW YORK — The case of subway gunman
Bernhard Goetz could be resubmitted to a grand
jury following revelations that he calmly plotted
his line of fire and shot twice at one of four vic
tims, officials said yesterday.
"We have been considering" resubmitting the
case, said Mary de Bourbon, a spokeswoman for

District Attorney Robert Morgenthau.
"This is not to say we will do it. You have to
have a substantial basis to do it, a basis other than
you didn't like the first result," she said.
The revelations about the shootings included a
statement from a New Hampshire police officer,
C.T. Domian, who said Goetz told him "he shot
each of the individuals once and then went back
to the last individual and shot that individual
again, thinking he had missed him the first time
because there wasn't any evidence of blood on
the person."
Goetz, who turned himself in in New
Hampshire, told Domian that before firing the
fifth shot, he said to the youth, "You seem to be
all right, here's another."
Meanwhile, Justice Stephen Crane of state Su
preme Court, the trial court, said he would con
sider permitting Morgenthau to resubmit the
case.
Goetz was indicted only on weapons posses
sion charges by a grand jury that also considered
charges up to attempted murder in the Dec. 22
shootings.
