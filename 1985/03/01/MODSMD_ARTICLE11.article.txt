Dumping plan protested
SANTA CRUZ — Santa Cruz officials, blast
ing a plan to dump the treated sewage of two
Santa Clara County cities into Monterey Bay, say
they don't want the hay used as "a garbage can."
The comments came Wednesday night at the
last of five sessions on an environmental impact
report on the controversial plan by Gilroy and
Morgan Hill. All of the speakers at the sparsely
attended meeting opposed the plan.
"Monterey Bay is not a garbage can," said
Santa Cruz Mayor Mardi Wormhoudt. "One of
the first principles of good planning is that you
don't export your problems."
Gilroy and Morgan Hill sparked debate with
their proposal to build a wastewater treatment
facility to replace the trouble-plagued facility
built in Gilrov in 1981.

"We are going to proceed in a responsible way
so we can solve our needs and not at your ex
pense," said Gilroy Mayor Roberta Hughan.
Four of five options studied in the EIR would
allow dumping treated sewage into Monterey
Bay either directly or via the Pajaro River. The
other proposes that the cities dispose of the
sewage on land in their own county.
Scientists find galaxies
PASADENA — Astronomers have made the
first calculations proving six distant galaxies are
among the most powerful in the universe, bring
ing to eight the number of barely visible galaxies
that nevertheless glow with the energy of up to 5
trillion suns.
The vast collections of stars are 2 billion to 3
billion light years from Earth, or about 12 to 18

trillion billion miles away, and are roughly the
size of our own Milky Way galaxy — some
600,000 trillion miles across, the researchers
report in today's issue of Astrophysical Journal
letters.
The study is the first to demonstrate three of
the objects actually are galaxies, said Tom Soifer
of the California Institute of Technology.
It also the first in which scientists calculated
the tremendous energy emitted by all six
galaxies, mostly in the form of invisible, infrared
light — which is heat — instead of visible light, he
said.
