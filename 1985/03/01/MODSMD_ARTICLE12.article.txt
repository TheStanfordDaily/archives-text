## Zurcher recalls 1971 Daily search by police 
### XAVIER BRIAND 
Nearly 14 years after he ordered a
search of The Daily's editorial office,
Palo Alto Police Chief James Zurcher
is still trying to live down his
reputation among journalists.
• April 1971 was a time of campus
unrest and demonstrations. The Roll
ing Stones' documentary "Gimme
Shelter," which captured the malaise
of the era, played in theaters across
the country. The Vietnam War con
tinued unabated.
On April 9 at Stanford, nine police
officers were injured in a clash with

Zurcher said he was faced with two
alternatives: to get a subpoena to
force the paper to turn over the
photos, or go into the news room with
a search warrant.

about 60 demonstrators barricaded
inside Stanford Medical Center.
I hree days later, four Palo Alto
police officers and two Stanford offi
cers armed with a search warrant
rummaged through The Daily edito
rial office seeking photos that would
identify the assailants.
They left empty-handed, but the
search touched off a long and bitter
court battle between The Daily and
Palo Alto over the constitutionality of
serving warrants in news rooms.
As the named defendant in the
lawsuit, Zurcher earned a permanent
place in law books after the U.S. Su
preme Court decided in 1978 to up
hold the use of warrants to search
private property for evidence of a
crime, even if the owner is uncon
nected with the case.
Zurcher, who is 51, recently
conceded he had no idea the search

would cause such an uproar in media
circles. Top editors nationwide as
sailed his "quick-warrant-and
ransack" police search, and their cries
grew louder when the Supreme Court
ruled in his favor.
Today, Zurcher says,"I have more
experience. I'm wiser." But he
vigorously defends his decision to
search The Daily.
Determined to prosecute the
demonstrators who had assaulted his
officers, Zurcher said he was faced
with two alternatives: get a subpoena
to force the paper to turn over the

photos, or go into the news room with
a seurch warrant.
After consulting with city attorneys
and the judge who would later issue
the warrant, Zurcher took the un
precedented step because "we felt
The Daily would not be cooperative,"
he explained.
Zurcher said The Daily had a
policy of non-cooperation with the
police. Indeed, in an editorial the day
after the search. The Daily acknowl
edged it routinely "destroyed all
potentially incriminating unpublished
photographic material" to avoid
"becoming a filing service for
evidence to be used in civil or crimi
nal courts "
Knowing The Daily's policy, Zur
cher said he reasoned that only a war
rant would prevent the editors from
destroying whatever evidence, if any,
existed.

Others disagree. The Daily's policy
had nothing to do with Zurcher's
decision to search the news room, ac
cording to Bob Beyers, director of the
Stanford University News Service
and an eyewitness to the assaults on
the police at the medical center.
Beyers said he personally told /ur
cher after the clash that the only per
son with pictures of the assaults was
Stanford Police photographer Nick
Bruno, who is now a sergeant on the
force.
"If Zurcher had listened and re
ported the events properly . . . that
incident (the search) would never
have happened," Beyers said.
Because of Zurcher's move,
police can now search lawyers' and
psychiatrists' offices for evidence, he
said.
Legislation passed by Congress in
19K0 limits the situations where a
warrant may be used to search a news
room, but still allows a search if there
is reason to believe the material in
question would be destroyed if sub
poenaed.
The search controversy erupted
only two months after Zurcher
moved to Palo Alto from Sierra
Madre, a quiet town outside
Pasadena with a population of
12,000. As police chief there, his only
exposure to demonstrations had been
from "media accounts. ... I saw it on
TV," he said.
Zurcher received a master's degree
in public administration from the
University of Southern California in
1970, and he considered Palo Alto a
good career move as well as an op
portunity to leave Southern Califor
nia for "a cooler, greener climate
with fewer people."
Zurcher says he has no fond
memories of his experiences with
demonstrators, recalling only the long
hours and the stress caused by being
"in constant readiness." He said
"community support" and "an extra
gene that carries a positive outlook
on life" allowed him to ride out that
turbulent era.
Zurcher said he caused a stir one
day when he turned the tables on
demonstrators who regularly gave his
officers handbills. He began passing

out leaflets of his own with advice on
how to stage a peaceful demonstra
tion. His fliers featured a pig sporting
a police uniform and flashing a "V"
peace sign.
Some officers on the force
reportedly were not amused when
Zurcher called his cartoon likeness
"Super Pig" because, by extension, it
made them "piglets."
While Zurcher may never win
popularity contests with the press, he
has gained the respect of many Palo
Alto citizens. City Council member

Ellen Fletcher described him as "a
top professional who isn't given to
getting excited [or) accusatory" when
facing crises. Of his early days as
police chief, she said, "He really did
an incredible job working with
citizens in a difficult situation."
Currently a Los Altos resident, the
chief has no plans to leave his job.
Remarried in 1981 and with two
children from a previous marriage, he
said he has roots in the area and
"enough to do to keep me busy."
Zurcher has a lot of off-duty activi

ties to keep himself occupied. He
runs 25 to 30 miles a week — 70
miles when training for marathons —
lifts weights and plays the guitar,
"country mostly," he said.
He has learned to work with
stained glass — one of his creations
hangs over the window in his office -j
and recently began teaching himself
French. In addition, he's an expert
marksman, ranked among the top 20
on the "governor's list."
"I'm probably the best shooter in
the department," he said.


On May 31, 1978, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the 1971 police search of The Daily's news room did not
violate the constitution. The following day, the front page of The Daily was devoted to the ruling and reac
tions from the Palo Alto Police department, as well as from newspaper editors across the nation.
