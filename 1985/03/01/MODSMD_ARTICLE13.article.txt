## The Stanford Daily Respect New Zealand
### 
Amid action and inaction, threats and coun
terthreats, New Zealand is making a strong and
controversial stand on nuclear weapons.
In early February, in accordance with govern
ment policy under New Zealand Prime Minister
David Lange, the USS Buchanan was denied
docking privileges when the U.S. government
refused to divulge whether it was carrying nuclear
weapons or was nuclear powered.
The denial raised the ire of the Reagan admin
istration, which has canceled military exercises
with New Zealand, threatened to annul the 34-
year-old ANZUS treaty (a defense pact among
Australia, New Zealand and the United States)
and warned it may deny New Zealand information
regarding Soviet movements. Some senators and
congressmen have started to ask about trade
restrictions against New Zealand.
Lange, who is currently visiting the United
States, countered by saying his country would
withhold security information about Southeast
Asia and surrounding areas. He also said that
Washington should not be "so extraordinarily
heavy" in its reaction to the policy.

The administration's anger is certainly justi
fied. To release information identifying ships that
are carrying nuclear weapons would be a major
threat. The stability of the nuclear triad may be,
by creating a precedent, highly jeopardized.
But if arguments can be decided by morality and
virtue rather than pragmatism. New Zealand's
policy is commendable and correct. Lange's
defense of the policy is simple. "It is a matter
very much of showing that New Zealanders are a
responsible people. This government has a
policy. That policy is not to have nuclear weapons
in New Zealand.
"Now, you don't compromise on that," he con
tinued. "You don't have them half in New
Zealand. You don't have them sometimes in New
Zealand." For the United States to fight this
policy is to endorse hypocrisy and deny another
country the right to act on its own behalf.
New Zealand, quite simply, is trying to control
its own destiny. It would like to have a larger
margin of safety between itself and nuclear
holocaust than the distance between someone's
finger and a button.
