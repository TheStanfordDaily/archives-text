# What has happened to ads?
## 
### 
It was once the boast of American advertisers that they
could sell anything to anyone. Dead cats to the board of
health, iceboxes to Eskimos, color televisions to the Am
ish. Anything. Once upon a time advertising was an art
form in its own right, an integral part of our society, one of
the great forces in our culture. It was exciting, glamorous,
fascinating, amusing. . . .
But then the fools got hold of it. And kept hold. Today
advertising is, by and large, pathetic. A laughing stock.
The men of vision have* been replaced by used-car sales
men in need of bifocals, men with no esthetic sense, men
who think that excitement can be induced by dropping
pickup trucks out of the sky and using lots of exclamation
points whenever the words "sale" or "credit" appear on
the screen. They're wrong, of course. They are facing a
generation that has been raised on this kind of advertising.
This generation knows that it's all hype. It won't be easily
swayed by the desperately cheerful little people who ap
pear for .30 seconds in the middle of "The A-Team."
Chances are it won't even be watching the little people,
just as it doesn't really watch the little people who appear
in "The A-Team."
Like "The A-Team" — like "The Love Boat," like
"Silver Spoons," like "Riptide," like etc. — most com
mercials are in the short-term-memory category of enter
tainment. They are remembered only for as long as is
necessary to understand them, and then promptly forgot
ten. Do you remember the plot of the last episode of
"Love Boat" you saw? Do you remember who was trying
to sell pickup trucks bv dropping thenr onto the parking
lot?
Even if you do remember things like that, you probably
have the good taste to he embarrassed about it. But ad
vertising should not be embarrassing. Remember Burma
Shave? No, of course not You're not old enough. But
even if you don't remember, you've almost certainly
heard of it. "John lost face/ Because he tried / To
sandpaper whiskers/Off his hide./ Burma Shave." Re
member? The product doesn't even exist anymore, and
millions of people know about it. And they're not embar
rassed about knowing. Now that was a real advertising
campaign.
For I believe that advertising need not be bad, need not
be stupid, need not be merely a convenient excuse to turn
down the sound on your television set and go check out
the refrigerator. Advertising can be fun. It can be made
respectable. But drastic measures are necessary. Advertis
ing must be taken out of the hands of the prostitutes and
mercenaries and hypocrites — or at least, it must be put
back into the hands of the creative prostitutes, the artistic
mercenaries and the hypocrites who have a sense of
humor. To this end, I have a modest proposal.
1 propose that advertisers be licensed, subject to a
board of review like the Federal Communications Com
mission or the state bar associations. This is only fair: Doc
tors and lawyers have to take tests and must be licensed to
practice; real estate agents have to pass tests before they
are licensed; television and radio stations need permission
from the FCC before they are allowed to broadcast. In the
hands of unscrupulous practitioners, advertising can be at

least as dangerous as, say, the law — and infinitely more
annoying. Isn't it time that someone imposed some stand
ards?
1 want to start with some guidelines for television ad
vertising, because television is not only the most powerful
medium for advertising, it is also currently the most
abused. Once television has been set to rights, the other
media can be easily taken care of.
Some sample guidelines:
• Anyone wishing to make advertisements shall be re-

quired to know the meanings of the words "huge,"
"giant," "large," "grand," "massive," "enormous,"
"immense," "monstrous" and "big." Also the meanings
of "sale" and "bargain."
• People who sound like game-show hosts shall be barred
fipm narrating advertisements. ■%,
• Fxcessivdlv cute children and animals are not accep*-
table, ever.
• Children who cannot sing shall not be allowed to sing.
• Automobile manufacturers shall be allowed to devote a
maximum of 20 percent of their advertising time to scenes
involving pylons, race tracks, rough back-country roads or
cheap shots at the Japanese.
• Advertisements for panty liners, disposable douches,
tampons, the Army, etc. shall be banned until the parties
responsible demonstrate that they have acquired a
modicum of taste and esthetic judgment.
• Animated creatures that pop out of cereal boxes or
jump off the boxes shall be banned unless it can be shown
that they have some redeeming social value.
• No jingle shall be allowed that fails to scan, or which
contains a forced rhyme, or whose presentation involves a
bouncing dot or a chorus of dedicated employees.
• Advertisers for beer and coffee shall not be allowed to
pretend that their products taste good.
• Schematic diagrams of sinuses, throats, stomachs and
other internal body parts shall be restricted to advertise
ments for fast-food franchises.
These are but a few of the more obviously necessary re
quirements. If you have others that you believe are
necessary, I urge you to contact the FCC and the networks
with your suggestions.
With your help, we will bring back the kind of advertis
ing that made America famous.

It was once the boast of American advertisers that they
could sell anything to anyone. Dead cats to the board of
health, iceboxes to Eskimos, color televisions to the Am
ish. Anything. Once upon a time advertising was an art
form in its own right, an integral part of our society, one of
the great forces in our culture. It was exciting, glamorous,
fascinating, amusing. . . .
But then the fools got hold of it. And kept hold. Today
advertising is, by and large, pathetic. A laughing stock.
The men of vision have* been replaced by used-car sales
men in need of bifocals, men with no esthetic sense, men
who think that excitement can be induced by dropping
pickup trucks out of the sky and using lots of exclamation
points whenever the words "sale" or "credit" appear on
the screen. They're wrong, of course. They are facing a
generation that has been raised on this kind of advertising.
This generation knows that it's all hype. It won't be easily
swayed by the desperately cheerful little people who ap
pear for .30 seconds in the middle of "The A-Team."
Chances are it won't even be watching the little people,
just as it doesn't really watch the little people who appear
in "The A-Team."
Like "The A-Team" — like "The Love Boat," like
"Silver Spoons," like "Riptide," like etc. — most com
mercials are in the short-term-memory category of enter
tainment. They are remembered only for as long as is
necessary to understand them, and then promptly forgot
ten. Do you remember the plot of the last episode of
"Love Boat" you saw? Do you remember who was trying
to sell pickup trucks bv dropping thenr onto the parking
lot?
Even if you do remember things like that, you probably
have the good taste to he embarrassed about it. But ad
vertising should not be embarrassing. Remember Burma
Shave? No, of course not You're not old enough. But
even if you don't remember, you've almost certainly
heard of it. "John lost face/ Because he tried / To
sandpaper whiskers/Off his hide./ Burma Shave." Re
member? The product doesn't even exist anymore, and
millions of people know about it. And they're not embar
rassed about knowing. Now that was a real advertising
campaign.
For I believe that advertising need not be bad, need not
be stupid, need not be merely a convenient excuse to turn
down the sound on your television set and go check out
the refrigerator. Advertising can be fun. It can be made
respectable. But drastic measures are necessary. Advertis
ing must be taken out of the hands of the prostitutes and
mercenaries and hypocrites — or at least, it must be put
back into the hands of the creative prostitutes, the artistic
mercenaries and the hypocrites who have a sense of
humor. To this end, I have a modest proposal.
1 propose that advertisers be licensed, subject to a
board of review like the Federal Communications Com
mission or the state bar associations. This is only fair: Doc
tors and lawyers have to take tests and must be licensed to
practice; real estate agents have to pass tests before they
are licensed; television and radio stations need permission
from the FCC before they are allowed to broadcast. In the
hands of unscrupulous practitioners, advertising can be at

least as dangerous as, say, the law — and infinitely more
annoying. Isn't it time that someone imposed some stand
ards?
1 want to start with some guidelines for television ad
vertising, because television is not only the most powerful
medium for advertising, it is also currently the most
abused. Once television has been set to rights, the other
media can be easily taken care of.
Some sample guidelines:
• Anyone wishing to make advertisements shall be re-

quired to know the meanings of the words "huge,"
"giant," "large," "grand," "massive," "enormous,"
"immense," "monstrous" and "big." Also the meanings
of "sale" and "bargain."
• People who sound like game-show hosts shall be barred
fipm narrating advertisements. ■%,
• Fxcessivdlv cute children and animals are not accep*-
table, ever.
• Children who cannot sing shall not be allowed to sing.
• Automobile manufacturers shall be allowed to devote a
maximum of 20 percent of their advertising time to scenes
involving pylons, race tracks, rough back-country roads or
cheap shots at the Japanese.
• Advertisements for panty liners, disposable douches,
tampons, the Army, etc. shall be banned until the parties
responsible demonstrate that they have acquired a
modicum of taste and esthetic judgment.
• Animated creatures that pop out of cereal boxes or
jump off the boxes shall be banned unless it can be shown
that they have some redeeming social value.
• No jingle shall be allowed that fails to scan, or which
contains a forced rhyme, or whose presentation involves a
bouncing dot or a chorus of dedicated employees.
• Advertisers for beer and coffee shall not be allowed to
pretend that their products taste good.
• Schematic diagrams of sinuses, throats, stomachs and
other internal body parts shall be restricted to advertise
ments for fast-food franchises.
These are but a few of the more obviously necessary re
quirements. If you have others that you believe are

with your suggestions.
