Media distortion
In Jason Matherly's column (The
Daily, Feb. 20), critical points were
made regarding "the ability of the
media to subtly mislead." In the
column, Matherly was referring to a
student sit-in protesting apartheid,
but with his thoughts he also inad
vertantly described the potential of
The Daily's Feb. 26 coverage of the
divestment question to mislead those
non-skeptical "media consumers"
among us. The two articles alleging
to represent differing views under
the headline "What's best for South
Africa?" actuall) led some of us to
assume that differing views would be
addressed. Unfortunately, The Daily
virtually ignored the arguments from
groups and individuals calling for
total divestment, thereby
"misleading" those progressive
individuals hoping for fair coverage
of this issue.
In the first article. Zulu Chief
Gatsha Buthelezi is quoted as saying
that divestment will backfire and
cause black South Africans addi
tional social injury. While the article
represented one South African's
viewpoint, it made no attempt to
represent opposing viewpoints ad
hered to by, among others, Nelson
Mandela and Nobel laureate Bishop
Desmond Tutu, who have both
called for total divestment. In addi
tion, it questions whether Stanford
activists are "contributing to their
(South Africans') duress'' and then
attempts to answer this query by
soliciting responses solely from adv
ocates of selective divestment —
advocates who agree with the chief s
assessment of the consequences of
disinvestment. A fairer journalistic
approach would have included
responses from groups advocating
total divestment as well.
The second article, entitled
"Students differ on policy," leads the
unwary reader to believe the spec
trum of opinions of the student body
will be expounded upon in the en
suing paragraphs. But, once again,
The Daily reporting "demonstrates
the ability of the media to subtly
mislead" (to reiterate Matherly's
sentiments). The representatives of
student sentiment included in the
report consist of two sophomore

members of the College Republicans
(a diverse group, no doubt). Next,
the article proceeds to present the
views of Hoover Fellow Peter
Duigan, also under the pretense of a
discussion of students' views on the
subject of divestment. Notably ab
sent from the article are the views of
students who have called for total
divestment.
The point of this letter has not
been to elucidate the journalistic
inadequacies of the two articles, but
rather to address what we perceive
as a dangerous shift in the discussion
of policy alternatives toward South
Africa. The national rightward trend
of the discussion on South Africa,
mirrored by The Daily's latest
coverage, has left the viewpoints of a
great number of the students con
cerned with this issue outside the
sphere of the debate. This protrayal
of the South Africa debate suggests
that caiis for total divestment come
only from fringe elements. This
"fringe," however, includes the
Black Student Union, Students
Against Reaganism (STAR), Coali
tion Against Apartheid, the United
Stanford Workers, the fall quarter
editorial board of The Stanford
Daily and a group of 1,000 Stanford
students who signed a petition calling
for total divestment. We sincerely
hope that The Daily will refrain from
using its position of influence to
perpetrate misconceptions on issues
as vital and serious as the issue of
human rights in South Africa.

I am writing concerning the inci
dent that occurred at the Delta Tau
Delta house on Tuesday night. Feb.
26. The Delts spent much time,
effort and resources preparing to
facilitate a discussion with all of the
University's resident fellows con
cerning fraternities and their role at
Stanford. We chose the resident
fellows because they seemed to be
the ones most critical of the system.

Other students would have been
surprised to see the Delt House: It
never looked better. We moved all
of our cars out of the parking lot to
provide spaces for the resident fel
lows to park, installed a bike rack
and neatly lined up all our mopeds.
The condition of the house, however,
was not nearly as impressive as the
condition of the Delts. We all
donned our best cowboy boots and
button-down collar shirts. We even
had name tags on! Moreover, there
was plenty of wine, cheese and hors
d'oeuvres served, even though most
of us do not consume these particu
lar food items very often.
We all waited patiently for our
guests to arrive between 7 and 10
p.m. But Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons, Dean of Residential
Education Norm Robinson and
Director of the Row Diana Conklin
were the only distinguished people •
who bothered to show up. Not one
resident fellow appeared the entire '•
night. Some of us were angry, but
most were disappointed: It seemed
that an excellent opportunity to I
discuss the issue of fraternal organi-j
zations with our mentors had just
been wasted.
This unfortunate event should be
looked upon as a lesson. A lesson to
both fraternities and the institutional
leaders of this university. Fraternity
reform is badly needed, but it cannojt
be achieved through the effort of one!
constituency. Both sides must work
to shape the fraternal system into an
active, responsible and valuable part ]
of residential education.
Fraternities are listening. We only',
hope that in the future the people •'
who criticize the system most are
more willing to share their opinions
and advice so that we may more
effectively work toward becoming art*
asset rather than a liability to Stan- *"

I am writing concerning the inci
dent that occurred at the Delta Tau
Delta house on Tuesday night. Feb.
26. The Delts spent much time,
effort and resources preparing to
facilitate a discussion with all of the
University's resident fellows con
cerning fraternities and their role at
Stanford. We chose the resident
fellows because they seemed to be
the ones most critical of the system.

Other students would have been
surprised to see the Delt House: It
never looked better. We moved all
of our cars out of the parking lot to
provide spaces for the resident fel
lows to park, installed a bike rack
and neatly lined up all our mopeds.
The condition of the house, however,
was not nearly as impressive as the
condition of the Delts. We all
donned our best cowboy boots and
button-down collar shirts. We even
had name tags on! Moreover, there
was plenty of wine, cheese and hors
d'oeuvres served, even though most
of us do not consume these particu
lar food items very often.
We all waited patiently for our
guests to arrive between 7 and 10
p.m. But Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons, Dean of Residential
Education Norm Robinson and
Director of the Row Diana Conklin
were the only distinguished people •
who bothered to show up. Not one
resident fellow appeared the entire '•
night. Some of us were angry, but
most were disappointed: It seemed
that an excellent opportunity to I
discuss the issue of fraternal organi-j
zations with our mentors had just
been wasted.
This unfortunate event should be
looked upon as a lesson. A lesson to
both fraternities and the institutional
leaders of this university. Fraternity
reform is badly needed, but it cannojt
be achieved through the effort of one!
constituency. Both sides must work
to shape the fraternal system into an
active, responsible and valuable part ]
of residential education.
Fraternities are listening. We only',
hope that in the future the people •'
who criticize the system most are
more willing to share their opinions
and advice so that we may more
effectively work toward becoming art*
asset rather than a liability to Stan- *"

Media distortion
In Jason Matherly's column (The
Daily, Feb. 20), critical points were
made regarding "the ability of the
media to subtly mislead." In the
column, Matherly was referring to a
student sit-in protesting apartheid,
but with his thoughts he also inad
vertantly described the potential of
The Daily's Feb. 26 coverage of the
divestment question to mislead those
non-skeptical "media consumers"
among us. The two articles alleging
to represent differing views under
the headline "What's best for South
Africa?" actuall) led some of us to
assume that differing views would be
addressed. Unfortunately, The Daily
virtually ignored the arguments from
groups and individuals calling for
total divestment, thereby
"misleading" those progressive
individuals hoping for fair coverage
of this issue.
In the first article. Zulu Chief
Gatsha Buthelezi is quoted as saying
that divestment will backfire and
cause black South Africans addi
tional social injury. While the article
represented one South African's
viewpoint, it made no attempt to
represent opposing viewpoints ad
hered to by, among others, Nelson
Mandela and Nobel laureate Bishop
Desmond Tutu, who have both
called for total divestment. In addi
tion, it questions whether Stanford
activists are "contributing to their
(South Africans') duress'' and then
attempts to answer this query by
soliciting responses solely from adv
ocates of selective divestment —
advocates who agree with the chief s
assessment of the consequences of
disinvestment. A fairer journalistic
approach would have included
responses from groups advocating
total divestment as well.
The second article, entitled
"Students differ on policy," leads the
unwary reader to believe the spec
trum of opinions of the student body
will be expounded upon in the en
suing paragraphs. But, once again,
The Daily reporting "demonstrates
the ability of the media to subtly
mislead" (to reiterate Matherly's
sentiments). The representatives of
student sentiment included in the
report consist of two sophomore

members of the College Republicans
(a diverse group, no doubt). Next,
the article proceeds to present the
views of Hoover Fellow Peter
Duigan, also under the pretense of a
discussion of students' views on the
subject of divestment. Notably ab
sent from the article are the views of
students who have called for total
divestment.
The point of this letter has not
been to elucidate the journalistic
inadequacies of the two articles, but
rather to address what we perceive
as a dangerous shift in the discussion
of policy alternatives toward South
Africa. The national rightward trend
of the discussion on South Africa,
mirrored by The Daily's latest
coverage, has left the viewpoints of a
great number of the students con
cerned with this issue outside the
sphere of the debate. This protrayal
of the South Africa debate suggests
that caiis for total divestment come
only from fringe elements. This
"fringe," however, includes the
Black Student Union, Students
Against Reaganism (STAR), Coali
tion Against Apartheid, the United
Stanford Workers, the fall quarter
