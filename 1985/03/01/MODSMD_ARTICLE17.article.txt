## Divestment helps blacks in the long run

I he article "Divestment may backfire, warns
African tribal leader'' (The Daily, Feb. 26) raises a
question: "Are Stanford actixists, in an effort to
improve the plight of blacks in South Africa, actu
ally contributing to their duress?" This question
was raised in response to comments made to the
U.S. Council for International Business by

VIEWPOINT

South African tribal chief Gatsha Buthclezi. who
claims that U.S. divestment from South Africa
would greatly increase the suffering of black South
Africans. A more serious question is. Why do we
hear from Buthelezi when so many other black
South African leaders are silenced?
Buthelc/i publicly supports I S. investments in
South Africa for some compelling reasons, For
South Africans, it is a criminal offense punishable
by a minimum of five years in prison and a maxi
mum of death to publicly oppose foreign invest
ments in South Africa.
Buthelezi also has a prominent position within
the South African apartheid system. He is allowed
a voice within and outside the government
precisely because he has collaboiated with the
apartheid regime in its policy of creating
Bantustans," or reservations lor ihc African
populations. He is the chief of Kwazulu. the
reservation created tor the Zulu people.
The South African government set up Bantus
tans as "independent * nations, to which Africans
are moved and denied anx tuturc claim to citizen
ship in South Africa. Neither South African libera
tion leaders nor any country in the world recognize
these reservations as the "independent homelands
the South African government claims them to be.

l eaders such as Nelson Mandela or Steve Biko.
who represent the South African liberation move
ments, are forcibly silenced in detention or death.
Others live underground or in exile. We do not
have many opportunities to hear them state their
positions publicly. While the U.S. Council for In
ternational Business does not invite them to speak,
many have openly denounced U.S. investments in
South Africa.
Steve Biko, the late leader of the Black Con
sciousness Movement in South Africa, encouraged
divestment. " I hc argument is often made that the
loss of foreign investment would hurt blacks the
most. It would undoubtedly hurt blacks in the short
run. because many of them would stand to lose
their jobs. But it should be understood in Europe
and North America that foreign investment sup
ports the present system ot political injustice. ... If
Washington is really interested in contributing to
the development of a just society in South Africa, it
would discourage investment in South Africa. We
blacks are perfectly willing to suffer the conse
quences! We are quite accustomed to suffering."
While being held in detention in 1977, Steve Biko
was murdered by the South African police.
Buthelc/i claims that "economic sanctions will
condemn a great many millions and a whole new
generation to continue living in slum conditions."
However, as Biko said, blacks are already con
demned to suffer in slum conditions. This is not be
cause of a lack of U.S. investments but rather
because of the policies of apartheid that foreign in
vestments support.
U.S. investments have tripled since 19f>(), but
have inspired no real progressive' Change. In fact,
there has been a systematic increase in repression
since 1960. Various government acts have ex

tended the period of time for which people can he
held without trial. At least 5,000 people have been
detained without trial since 1963. At least 8 million
people have been arrested under pass laws since
1961 (only Africans can be arrested on such
charges since they are required to carry a pass at all
times). With 440 out of every 100,000 people in
prison. South Africa has the highest per capita
prison population in the world.
Such political oppression is accompanied by
more insidious brutality More than 2.9 million
black children under age 15 suffer from malnutri
tion. Infant mortality is also a rampant problem
among the black South Africans. It was estimated
in 1980 that while only 1 2 out of every 1,000 white
infants die. more than 280 out of every 1,000 black
infants die in the rural areas. The virulence of in
fant mortality and malnutrition can be attributed to
the poverty in which the African population is kept.
Blacks' wages are one-third of whites' wages for
similar jobs. More than b0 percent of urban blacks
earn less than necessary for poverty-level subsis
tence. For rural blacks, the situation is worse.
Activists calling for divestment recogni/e that
the only way to improve the plight of blacks in
South Africa is to remove support for their oppres
sors. The liberation struggle itself is being waged
and can only be won by South Africans themselves.
We in the United States can aid the South Africans
in their struggle for self-determination through ur
ging our government, corporations and public insti
tutions like Stanford to end their economic and
political support for the racist regime of South
Africa. ,

Others live underground or in exile. We do not
have many opportunities to hear them state their
positions publicly. While the U.S. Council for In

many have openly denounced U.S. investments in
South Africa.
Steve Biko, the late leader of the Black Con
sciousness Movement in South Africa, encouraged
divestment. " I hc argument is often made that the
loss of foreign investment would hurt blacks the
most. It would undoubtedly hurt blacks in the short
run. because many of them would stand to lose
their jobs. But it should be understood in Europe
and North America that foreign investment sup
ports the present system ot political injustice. ... If
Washington is really interested in contributing to
the development of a just society in South Africa, it
would discourage investment in South Africa. We
blacks are perfectly willing to suffer the conse
quences! We are quite accustomed to suffering."
While being held in detention in 1977, Steve Biko
was murdered by the South African police.
Buthelc/i claims that "economic sanctions will
condemn a great many millions and a whole new
generation to continue living in slum conditions."
However, as Biko said, blacks are already con
demned to suffer in slum conditions. This is not be
cause of a lack of U.S. investments but rather
because of the policies of apartheid that foreign in
vestments support.
U.S. investments have tripled since 19f>(), but
have inspired no real progressive' Change. In fact,
there has been a systematic increase in repression
since 1960. Various government acts have ex

tended the period of time for which people can he
held without trial. At least 5,000 people have been
detained without trial since 1963. At least 8 million
people have been arrested under pass laws since
1961 (only Africans can be arrested on such
charges since they are required to carry a pass at all
times). With 440 out of every 100,000 people in
prison. South Africa has the highest per capita
prison population in the world.
Such political oppression is accompanied by
more insidious brutality More than 2.9 million
black children under age 15 suffer from malnutri
tion. Infant mortality is also a rampant problem
among the black South Africans. It was estimated
in 1980 that while only 1 2 out of every 1,000 white
infants die. more than 280 out of every 1,000 black
infants die in the rural areas. The virulence of in
fant mortality and malnutrition can be attributed to
the poverty in which the African population is kept.
Blacks' wages are one-third of whites' wages for
similar jobs. More than b0 percent of urban blacks
earn less than necessary for poverty-level subsis

Activists calling for divestment recogni/e that
the only way to improve the plight of blacks in
South Africa is to remove support for their oppres

and can only be won by South Africans themselves.
We in the United States can aid the South Africans
in their struggle for self-determination through ur

political support for the racist regime of South

I he article "Divestment may backfire, warns
African tribal leader'' (The Daily, Feb. 26) raises a
question: "Are Stanford actixists, in an effort to
improve the plight of blacks in South Africa, actu
ally contributing to their duress?" This question
was raised in response to comments made to the
U.S. Council for International Business by

VIEWPOINT

South African tribal chief Gatsha Buthclezi. who
claims that U.S. divestment from South Africa
would greatly increase the suffering of black South
Africans. A more serious question is. Why do we
hear from Buthelezi when so many other black
South African leaders are silenced?
Buthelc/i publicly supports I S. investments in
South Africa for some compelling reasons, For
South Africans, it is a criminal offense punishable
by a minimum of five years in prison and a maxi
mum of death to publicly oppose foreign invest
ments in South Africa.
Buthelezi also has a prominent position within
the South African apartheid system. He is allowed
a voice within and outside the government
precisely because he has collaboiated with the
apartheid regime in its policy of creating
Bantustans," or reservations lor ihc African
populations. He is the chief of Kwazulu. the
reservation created tor the Zulu people.
The South African government set up Bantus
tans as "independent * nations, to which Africans
are moved and denied anx tuturc claim to citizen
ship in South Africa. Neither South African libera
tion leaders nor any country in the world recognize
these reservations as the "independent homelands
the South African government claims them to be.
