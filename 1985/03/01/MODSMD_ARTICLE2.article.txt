# Plans raise opposition
## Crothers residents miffed 
### DAVID S. GOLDSTEIN Staff writer 
The Stanford Law School plans to build a recreation
center between Crothers and Crothers Memorial halls,
but some residents have expressed concerns about its use
fulness.
The center, which would include a weight room,
showers, a lounge and a fireplace, will be built with a $1
million donation from an anonymous source, pending
final approval by the Stanford Board of Trustees. The
proposal comes before the board March 12.
The donor promised to give the money to the law
school if the building is approved.
The facility will be open to law students, law faculty and
to residents of both dorms, according to Margo Smith, as
sociate dean of the law school.
Smith said the donor hoped the facility would "enhance
the living of the Crothers Hall residents," and would
promote mixing between law students and non-law stu
dents in both dorms.
Of the 355 residents of both dorms, 92 are law students,
nearly all of whom live in Crothers. Cro Mem is primarily
for engineering students.
Although the facility will be open to them, several non
law residents of Cro Mem expressed opposition to the
proposal.
"It's not that useful," Nelson Tamplin, president of Cro
Mem, said. "What the heck do we residents need with
showers?" Dorm residents live only a few feet from the
hall showers, he said. Others said they already have access
to weight room facilities in the dorms and the money
would be better spent upgrading them.
Some residents complained that the building will cut
about 10 feet into the grassy area between the two dormi
tories.
Dean of Residential Education Norm Robinson said
the 10-foot strip of grass lost to the building will be made
up at the other end of the field, which is currently paved.
Hut Tamplin said that although plans call for replacing the
grass, the field will no longer be rectangular. This may
cause problems for residents who play football there.
"You can smash into a wall." he said.
Carol Muller, resident director of the Crothers dormi
tories and Manzanita Park and a member of the center's
planning committee, said two special meetings were held
for dorm residents. One was held Nov. 28 in Crothers; the
other was Jan. 7 in Cro Mem. Both were widely ad
vertised in resident newsletters and on posted flyers. She
said residents' concerns were heard and were considered
in the plans.
"To be fair, they have given us the opportunity" to ex
press opinions, Cro Mem Resident Assistant Brian
YVestcott said, but "I'm not sure they've ever really gotten
the students' opinions "
Cro Mem resident Dave Pier said few dorm residents
attended the special meetings because one was just before
autumn quarter final exams and the other was before
classes began this quarter.
Pier also said that only law students were formally sur
veyed about what they wanted in the facility. Not all dorm
residents were surveyed.
Westcott said residents' opinions were not sought until
the project was well underway, and no student vote was
taken, he said.
Westcott also said Cro Mem is "boxed in" on three
sides by streets, and placing a building in the courtyard
will add a fourth side to the box.
Tamplin said he and Pier helped circulate a survey
among Cro Mem residents. Surveys were given to all resi
dents. and of the 60 percent response, he said students
were against the facility about 2-to-l.
Robinson said that although residents were not for
mally surveyed, they were asked at the special meetings
what they would like in the building. According to Robin
son, they most wanted a fitness facility and a room for
meetings and other uses. These were incorporated into
