## Artist says the Claw is a celebration of life 
### LEE CLINE 
Anyone who is familiar with the
Stanford campus has seen White
Memorial Fountain, affectionately
dubbed "the Claw." Annually used
as a spear on which to impale an ef
figy of Cal's Golden Bear, it is actu
ally a distinguished work of art by
prominent Bay Area artist Aristides
Demetrios.
Built of bronze on copper with
about 80 separate water jets, the
sculpture stands 16 feet above a pool
of water that spans 35 feet.
White Memorial Fountain, in
stalled in the summer of 1963, was
funded by Raymond White and his
wife to honor their sons, John Barber
White II and William Nicholas White,
who both died a few years after their
studies here at Stanford, in a plane
crash and a surfing accident,
respectively. Demetrios was chosen
to create a centerpiece for White
Plaza after a search that reached as
far as Europe.
"The shape of the arms could make
a sphere, and they could make an up
ward spiral. The water complements
the sculpture form," Demetrios said
of the sculpture. He claimed his inspi
ration came directly from the White
brothers: "The death of young people
is a very tragic thing." The expression
of the sculpture is intended as a gen
eral celebration of life, he said.
Other factors also influenced the
design of the sculpture. "I built it to
complement the surroundings. I took
into account the fact that the plaza
would often be filled with people, so I
designed it taller than six feet. I took
into account the trees in the area —
the shape of the boughs is important.
The trees still are not fully grown.
When they grow around it, the
sculpture will work even better."
Demetrios said he spends about
two months working on each of his

sculptures. The initial idea is
developed into a scale model, ranging
in height from a few inches to a foot.
The height of the final piece can be
anywhere from a few feet to ninety
feet, the size of one of his tallest
works. The model is very precise, and
the artist spends a significant amount
of time ensuring that the proportions
in the final work are correct. Most of
the welding of the various metals is
done in his shop with the aid of a few
other workers and, frequently, his
daughter Lisa.

Demetrios works on the sculpture
until it is nearly done: it is then
taken out to the site, where he
makes final decisions on the propor
tion in accordance with the surround
ings. "If you want to honor the site,
you've got to examine it closely and
consider the position of the sun at
every time during the day and year,
the winds, the leaf canopy, the
branches and, of course, the sur
rounding architecture," Demetrios
explained.
He said he designs about one foun

tain a year: "I like to use water. I
used to play in a brook all the time
when I was a kid."
Demetrios grew up in an "artists'
town" in Massachusetts. Both his
parents were artists, and his father
ran his own sculpture school.
Demetrios graduated from Harvard
in 1953 with a degree in literature
and history and then entered the
Navy for three years.
"I've known I've been an artist all
along," he said, but his initial intent

was to be a painter. "I painted quite a
bit in the Navy ... at first, I didn't
want to be a sculptor. I didn't want to
be like my father."
He said he also had architecture in
mind, but eventually found himself
attending his father's sculpture school
for a few years following his time in
the Navy. He no longer seriously
paints, although he does bring into his
metal works a certain element of
painting — the use of color — with
oxidation and the use of patina.
Demetrios is renowned in part for

his treatment of wind, water and
flame. However, his newer works
seem to have a different emphasis
that he calls "discontinuity." Rather
than the fluid lyricism visible in the
White Plaza sculpture, he says he has
been working on sharper, more an
gular. "industrial" shapes in each
work that interact with each other
only in a minimal sense.
"This discontinuity is more a sym
bol for real life nowadays,"
Demetrios said. "Images are thrown
at us that just don't fit together. Tele
vision is a prime example." He adds
that a play on expression of dimen
sion and perspective is also inherent
in his more recent works.
When asked what he thought of
Stanford's sculpture collection,
Demetrios replied, "It's great, it's all
great. (Art Prof. Albert) Elsen is fan
tastic. incredible. His aquisition of the
Rodins is a major triumph."
He is enthusiastic and optimistic
regarding the new directions art is
taking. "The hard-edge stuff is get
ting rigid. Now we have some mar
velous whimsical art trying to break
this rigidity. It is a welcome return of
a mixture of passion and intellect."
On being an artist, Demetrios said.
"I am always questioning, constantly
questioning everything. It's nerve
racking, but it's vital. Five years ago 1
realized 1 knew nothing. I totally
retrained myself.
"One thing I don't want to do is
repeat myself. I could have done an
other 25 Claws. I had that chance and
it would've been easy for me to do,
but I didn't. 1 don't want my works to
seem mass produced. . . . Each indi
vidual work is unique."
His advice to young potential ar
tists: "Do it. Don't live life too safely.
The payoff is incredible. A piece will
start to pay you back in power and
love."
