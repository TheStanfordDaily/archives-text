## Stanford's upset bid at OSU fails 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
CORVALLIS, Ore. — The Stanford
men's basketball team didn't play spoiler
last night against Oregon State. Just scarer.
Oregon State, in a must-win situation to
keep its NCAA tournament hopes alive,
got its victory, 54-49. But the Beavers, who
improved to 20-7 overall and 10-5 in the
Pacific 10 Conference, also got a scare.
And if one rebound in particular had
bounced Stanford's way, they easily could
have gotten a loss.
"We did about everything we could do
to win the game, " Stanford Coach Tom
Davis said. "We were playing about as
close to the high level of our ability as a
coach could ask.
"I've been so proud of this team in the
last month, although we don't have many
wins to show for it,"he continued.
"Considering our record, they (the
players) haven't thrown in the towel."
The loss dropped Stanford to 11-14
overall and 3-12 in the Pac-10. However,
other than forcing the Cardinal to win all
three of its remaining games it it hopes to
salvage a non-losing season, last night's
game meant virtually nothing to Stanford.
To Oregon State, it meant lots.
"We just looked at the game and said,
'What the hell,' " commented Cardinal
forward Andy Fischer, who led Stanford
with 14 points. "We had nothing to lose,
and they had lots to lose."
Stanford let Oregon State know in the
first half that its 20th win of the season
would not come easily, and the Cardinal
trailed only by two, 26-24, at halftime.
Stanford took a one-point lead early in the
second half before Oregon State moved
out to a 43-35 advantage with 7:19
remaining.
But Stanford wasn't finished scaring the
Beavers. The Cardinal charged back, out
scoring the Beavers 12-4 in the next three
minutes to tie it at 47-47. Oregon State
Coach Ralph Miller decided he had seen
enough comebacks for one night and put
his team in a four-corners delay game with
3:58 to go.
"We were playing for a good shot,
looking for a lay-in," said Beaver center
Steve Woodside, one of two Oregon State
players who scored 14 points. "I think they
(Stanford) thought we were going to hold
it until 15 seconds were left."
Oregon State did hold it for three
minutes, and just as the clock ticked under
the one-minute mark, forward A.C. Green
found Woodside streaking toward the bas
ket on a back-door cut. Woodside made
the layup to make it 49-47 and was fouled

on the shot by Earl Koberlein.
Davis called a timeout to ice Woodside,
and it worked. Woodside's tree throw was
short. The rebound, however, bounced
long, out of the hands of two Cardinal
players and into those of Beaver guard
Eric Knox.
Twenty-one seconds later. Dean Derrah
passed to a streaking Green, who scored,
was fouled, made the free throw, and
ended the game for all practical purposes.
"That's always the kind of rebound you
like to think back and say, T'd like to have
that rebound,' " Davis said.
Meanwhile, Miller was breathing a sigh
of relief, as a loss would have been the
Beavers' third straight and fifth in six
home games.
"It was a good win," Miller said of his
599 th career victory. "It just proves a
point: that defense can do a lot of good for
you, even if you miss easy shots."
Indeed, the Beavers missed wide-open
shot after shot over a sagging Cardinal
zone. All told, they shot 45 percent from
the floor, while the Cardinal shot 47 per
cent.
Though Oregon State's aggressive man
to-man defense might have been respon
sible for the win, it was Stanford's defense
that made it a game. Stanford played in the
usual zone, but added a new twist by drop
ping the middle man down low to cover
Green.
"We found out in the first game (against
Oregon State) that not only is A C. Green
bigger than any of our guys inside, he's
also quicker," said Davis, who also found
out in that game that Green can score 39
points. "So we had to drop somebody
down with more quickness."
That somebody was the Cardinal's small
forward, or Fischer for 29 minutes and
freshman Scott Meinert for 11. The defen
sive ploy worked OK — Green only had
11 points and six rebounds — but stirred
up some controversy in the process.
Did Green take a beating? "I think
anybody that sat there and watched the
game would have an answer for that,"
Miller cracked. "That was brutal.
"He certainly did take a tremendous
physical beating," Miller said. "He
(Green) had two or three people on him all
the time. Plus, every time he moved, he
was shoved, kicked or knocked down. And
there were no calls."
Fischer denied Miller's accusations of
illegal activity, but didn't deny that there
was contact. "It was a war out there," Fisch
er said. "There was a lot of contact be
tween the two of us all night."
All things considered, Davis was pleased

with his team's performance and emerged
from the locker room just minutes after
the game.
"We've been getting better," Davis
began. "I don't think there's any question
we've improved since the last time we
played Oregon State."
Fischer couldn't agree more. "We're
playing so much better than we have all
year," he said. "We're peaking now, but
unfortunately, it's just a little late in the
season."

Card notes
Although last night's attendence at Gill
Coliseum was 9,214, it was the second
worst crowd and only the fifth non-sellout
in the last 80 games at the 10,400-seat
arena. The smallest crowd in that six-year
stretch was Tuesday against New Mexico,
when 9,015 showed up.
Once again, Stanford did not work the
ball inside, and consequently got little pro
duction from its big men.
