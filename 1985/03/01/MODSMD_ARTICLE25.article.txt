CORVALLIS, Ore. — The had news ahout the Stan
ford men's basketball game against Oregon tomorrow at 1
p.m. is that it's on the road, where the Cardinal is 1-8 this
season. >,
The good news is that the game will be played at McAr
thur Court, where Stanford will feel right at home. Over
the last half-decade, Stanford has a better winning
percentage at Mac Court than it does at Maples Pavilion.
If the Cardinal hadn't lost 91-71 at Oregon last season, it
would be a perfect 5-0. <_
" 'The Pit' is a smaller version of the Boston Garden in
structure and, in some ways, tradition," said Stanford As
soc. Head Coach Bruce Pearl, who coached at Boston
College with Tom Davis before coming west.
McArthur Court was built in 1926 with an original
capacity of 6,000. Since then, three different sets pf
renovations have jncreased the capacity to 10,099, and
the noise level has increased right along with the seating.
With two upper balconies, the fans are virtually on top,of
the court.
Besides a great arena, Oregon has fans to match "The
basketball fans at Oregon are by far the most
knowledgable in the league," Pearl said. "They know the
game. That's something we're trying to get our fans to be
like. They're getting better, but we ultimately want them
to be like they are in Oregon." I,
If Oregon had a team on the same level as its arena and
fans, it would be in business. To say the least, the Ducks ys
basketball players have been a disappointment this
season.
After a 70-53 victory over California last night, Oregrth
improved to only 14-14 overall and 7-8 in the Pacific fO
Conference, good for sole possession of sixth place. ''
"They had everybody back except (forward David)
Brantley, and they had some good freshmen coming in, so
I'm a little surprised they're not doing better," Stanford
Asst. Coach Gary Close said. "But they lost a lot of tight
games this year, and they won all those close games last
year."
The Ducks finished 15-13 overall and 11-7 in the Pac
-10 last year, before losing to Santa Clara 66-53 in the
opening round of the National Invitational Tournament,
Oregon's first postseason tournament since 1977.
Oregon's chances of making the NIT this year are slim,
and if it doesn't win all three of its remaining games, they
are non-existent. After Stanford, Oregon plays at USC
next week and then closes the season at home against
UCLA. .
Although the Ducks have been a disappointment, most
of their problems took place early in the season. The
Ducks are playing easily their best basketball of the year
now, and they're coming off an excellent road trip to
Arizona last weekend.
