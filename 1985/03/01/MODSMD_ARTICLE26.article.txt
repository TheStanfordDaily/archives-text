# ASU here for 3 as Six-Pac season opens

### TOM SENF Staff sportswriter 
Stanford baseball will open its Pacific 10 Conference
season today at 2 p.m. when it takes on traditional confer
ence power Arizona State in the beginning of a three
game series at Sunken Diamond.
Despite Wednesday's 5-4 loss to U.S. International
University of San Diego, Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
is not worried about his team's preseason progress. "You
can't say we're not improving just because of one game,"
he said. "We're playing well in spite of what happened
[Wednesday]."
Before the season started, Marquess was confident in
his pitching and defense but was concerned about the hit
ting. Now, before the league opener, he is happy with the
offense's progress. "That's the thing we're trying to im
prove, and it's coming along well," he said.
ASU, ranked No. 3 in one preseason poll, has struggled
to an 8-14 record. However, don't expect the Sun Devils
to stay below .500 for long. Their early season woes have
mainly been the result of injuries and the ineligibility of
four key players, including All Pac-10 selection Todd
Brown.
Last year, ASU ran away with the Pac-10 Southern
Division, finishing five games ahead of Stanford and USC.
In December, the Sun Devils were forced to forfeit the
title because of violations in their work-study program.
Under NCAA rules, money received by players on
work-study must be counted against the 13 full baseball
scholarships a school is permitted to give. After ASU al
legedly misinterpreted this rule and went over the limit, it
was put on probation by the NCAA.
In addition to forfeiture of the 1984 Six-Pac champion
ship, ASU was declared ineligible to win this year's title or
participate in NCAA tournament action. Future scholar
ship allotments were also cut back. Finally, the four

players involved were forced to sit out the first 16 games
of the 1985 schedule.
The penalties are one of the few ' irk spots on the
record of Sun Devil Coach Jim Brock. During his 13 years
at the helm, ASU has the best winning percentage in the
nation at .762.
Why are the Sun Devils always so tough?
"It's simple." Marquess said. "They get better athletes
than everyone else."
This year is no exception. Despite the loss of co-Pac-10
Player of the Year Oddibe McDowell, ASU is loaded with
talent. Centerfielder Barry Bonds — son of former San
Francisco Giant star Bobby Bonds — hit .360 last year
with 11 home runs, 55 RBIs and 30 stolen bases. Like
Brown, Bonds was an All Pac-10 choice.
i he ASU pitching staff has had its problems so far. but
Marquess expects a tough time from the Sun Devil veter
ans the Cardinal will be facing. "All the pitchers they will
be using against us are experienced and have won in the
past," he said.
The pitchers Marquess referred to are Jeff Roberts (1-
0), Gilbert Villanueva (0-3) and Doug Henry (2-2).
According to Marquess, the key to the series will be
whether the Cardinal pitchers can shut down the potent
Sun Devil attack. "Their record is deceiving," he said.
"They're always a good offensive team. We've got to keep
the ball in the ballpark. They can really hurt you with the
home run."
They certainly can. In 1984, the Sun Devils belted 108
round-trippers, compared to 35 for the Cardinal. This
year, Stanford is doing better'in the longball department
with 20 to ASU's 23.
Rob Wassenaar (3-0) will oppose Roberts in the
opener, Jeff Ballard (4-0) will take on Villanueva tomor
row, and Kevin Kunkel (2-1) will throw against Henry
in the series finale on Sunday.

Second baseman Pete Stanicek has "been playing well, both offensively and defensively," according to Coach
Mark Marquess. Stanicek hit a three-run homer Tuesday against Stanislaus State to lead the Cardinal to a 7-
2 win.
