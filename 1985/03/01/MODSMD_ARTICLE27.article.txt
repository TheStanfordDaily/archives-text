# Wrestlers hope for 3rd at Pac-10s

This season has been filled with many firsts for
the Stanford wrestling team, but the first that the
team would like most of all would be a third-place
finish in the Pacific 10 Conference Championships
on Sunday at Arizona State.
The team finished fourth last year, its highest
finish ever.
"I'm hoping for third if we have a great day â€” if
we don't we'll finish fourth," Stanford Coach Chris
Horpel said. "The trouble is that it is a small tourn
ament, so everyone has to do well."
There are only five schools in the Pac-10 with
wrestling programs: Arizona State, Oregon,
Oregon State, Washington State and Stanford.
The Cardinal finished its dual meet season with a
8-6-1 record and suffered only one convincing
defeat all season, 34-6 at the hands of Arizona
State. Stanford narrowly lost to Oregon State 20-
18 and upset Oregon 19-15. In tournaments, Stan
ford has performed even better.
The host Sun Devils are heavily favored to take

the team crown, but will be challenged by defend
ing champion Oregon State. ASU finished the
season with a 20-2 record against some of the na
tion's best teams and is ranked among the top five
in the country.
The secondary battle will be the one for third
place, between Stanford, Oregon and Washington
State.
The top two finishers in each weight class plus
one third-place finisher this weekend will go on to
the NCAA Championships on March 14-16 in
Oklahoma City. The Cardinal has five wrestlers
who have a good chance to place in the top two.
Jeff Bradley (134 pounds) and Dave Lee (167)
will probably be seeded first. Bradley is undefeated
against Pac-10 opponents, while Lee has suffered
only one defeat. Against Arizona State Feb. X,
Bradley and Lee were the only Cardinal wrestlers
to win.
This could be the last collegiate competition for
senior Tom Mullen (177), who Horpel said has
been very tough in practice recently. He lost a close

match to the Sun Devils' Tom Kolopus. who is
ranked third in the nation. Mullen could sneak into
the finals.
Scott Wiggen (142) will have a battle in his class,
and Horpel believes Wiggen could upset the first
two seeds from Arizona State and Oregon State.
Pete Rogers (158) has looked better as the
season has progressed and has had some minor up
sets.
Oregon State Coach Dale Thomas said of the
tournament: "It will be easily won by Arizona
State. We don't have a snowball's chance in hell."
ASU Coach Bobby Douglas is not so sure. His
team was also heavily favored last year, but lost the
crown to the Beavers.
"1 don't agree with that," he said when told of
Thomas' prediction. "He's just blowing smoke to
take the pressure off his team and place pressure on
us."
Horpel noted that the Beavers always seem to
rise to the occasion, and in many years have been
underdogs and still won the team crown.
