# Whitsitt finds that early practice pays off
## 
### BETH KLEID Senior sportswriter 
It was 6 a.m. when the alarm went
off, and seven-year old Novian Whit
sitt, his four-year old brother Damon
and their father went out into the
chilly, dark morning to play basket
ball at the local playground near their
San Pedro home.
I his scene was repeated day after
day, year after year, until Whitsitt left
home for Stanford.
The word playground took on a
new meaning for the Whitsitts. It was
not merely play that occurred on
those mornings — it was serious
practice that got more serious as time
passed.
The sophomore said that he feels a
chill when he remembers the alarm.
"It was the worst feeling in the world
when that alarm went off," Whitsitt
said. "The sound was blood
curdling."
But young Whitsitt became condi
tioned to the sound. "It was like an
automatic response— I would get up,
get dressed and go to the playground.
"At first, we hated it. And I hated
my dad," he said. "We were too
voung to understand what was going
on. Our friends thought we were
crazy, they couldn't put it together. . .
we couldn't either."
However, there was no complain
ing, and no rebellion. "Dad is Dad —
you don't complain," said Whitsitt,
with a mixed note of fear and respect
in his voice.
Whitsitt explained the reason for
the early morning workouts. "My
dad said we had to pick some sport to
be actively involved in — he thought
it was healthy." He and his brother
could have chosen any sport except
football. "But since my dad was a
gym-rat, and we followed him around
all the time, basketball was the natu
ral choice."
As soon as Whitsitt began to play
on organized boys' league teams, he
found that practice pays off. "We saw
that we had an edge on these
people," he said. "And we were
happy to have a slight advantage."

For Whitsitt, this advantage helped
to justify the morning practices. "But
at the same time we dreaded them. It
was so cold out there, our hands were
so cold. It hurt just to catch the ball,"
he said.
By the time he was in seventh
grade, he no longer had to deal with
the elements when his alarm rang.
His father found a gym to use for the
practices.
And by the time he was in high
school at Chadwick Prep, Whitsitt no
longer dreaded the mornings on the
court. In fact, he said that he began to
look forward to them.
"For the first time, in ninth grade, 1
could say to myself, 'I really know
why I'm here,' " Whitsitt recalled.
"My dad pushed and pushed me, but
then you get to like it."
In addition to stressing sports, his
father stressed academics, and
therefore Whitsitt attended Chadwick,
a private school, from seventh to 10th
grade. The sophomore said that there
he learned "the right habits." But he
switched to a public school, San
Pedro High, in eleventh grade be
cause his father thought he needed a
"new social environment."
"At San Pedro, I was confident
about my basketball, very happy,"
said Whitsitt. And so was his father.
"I reached all of the goals we set for
me."
In addition to being a mentor, his
father was Whitsitt's greatest fan.
"My dad followed my playing avidly
— he would watch even if I was just
shooting around on a Sunday."
Whitsitt had others who followed
his high school career — namely,
Stanford basketball coaches. "They
expressed interest in me during my
junior year, and when I was
recruited it was like a dream come
true," said Whitsitt.
Has his Stanford basketball experi
ence lived up to his dream?
"It definitely has, " said Whitsitt.
"Here, I love basketball like I always
have."
He said that he thinks he has grown
as a player from last season to this

season. He attributes this growth
"partly to experience and partly be
cause 1 worked hard all last spring
and summer."
According to Whitsitt. his sopho

more season has been somewhat
easier than his first year as a Card
inal.'When you're a freshman, every
thing is coming at you 100 miles per
hour, and it's a shock."

He said that there is still room to
grow. "There are so many things to
improve," he said. For Whitsitt. one
of these things is consistency.
"I'm a little sporadic," he ex
plained. "Some days I feel it —
everything is working — defensively,
mentally, shotwise. But other days
. . . things don't work and I get
frustrated too easily . . . and it has a
snowball effect."
The 6-foot-1 guard is aware of his
strengths. "I'm a shooter — my
jumpshot is my trademark — but even
that lacks consistency."
Indeed, Whitsitt is a shooter. This
season he is leading the team with an
average of 10.7 points per game, and
is often a leading scorer. His career
high this season occurred against
Seattle — Whitsitt scored 23 points.
He said he also has "speed and
quickness." But he noted that he
doesn't take advantage of these skills
as much as Coach Tom Davis would
like, especially on defense and in
rebounding.
In general, though. Whitsitt said
that he is satisfied with his perfor
mance this season. He is also pleased
with his team and its coaches. "I have
been treated fairly in all respects," he
said.
"The coaches have a positive atti
tude, even though we haven't had the
greatest season," he continued.
"Davis is the type of coach who al
ways looks to the next game."
The team has learned so much this
season, Whitsitt said, and "we wish
we could do the Pac-10 over."
His favorite game this year was the
match against LaSalle in the Apple
Invitational at Stanford in December.
Whitsitt describes it as "very sweet."
He said, "No one expected us to beat
them, but we pulled together and won
our own tournament's champion
ship."
He explains that this year's team is
more cohesive than last year's. "We
don't have the standouts — the
leaders — we had last year, like
Revelli and Jones," he said. "We
know we're a team, and we'll win be

cause we're a team.
Looking to the future, he dreams of
playing NBA ball. But for now, ''1
just want to become the best basket
ball player I'm capable of becoming."
Of course, Whitsitt has learned
about dedication and disipline be
cause of his sport. As an international
relations major, he said that he puts
in study hours daily. "Basketball
makes you budget your time," he
said.
Another area where Whitsitt shows
his discipline is the flute, which he
began playing in fifth grade and
practiced every day after afternoon
basketball practices. "1 played here in
the spring last year. It was great — 1
took lessons. I'm going to do it again
this spring."
Looking back, Whitsitt has no
regrets about his childhood. He said
that those early mornings of basket
ball practice helped to bring his fam
ily closer together. "My brother and 1
learned to look out for each other.
We tried not to get Dad too mad."
Currently, Damon Whitsitt is leading
his own high school team to the city
finals.
Whitsitt's mother entered into the
family's basketball mania as a result
of trying to hold the household to
gether. "Mom was the glue," he said.
"She knew both sides of it — we com
plained to her a lot and she knew
what Dad was trying to do.
Sometimes she would come down and
watch us practice. I really want to
thank her for easing the tension."
The sophomore did not formally
thank his father until after his last
game in high school, when he knew
that he would be going out into the
basketball world on his own.
Whitsitt harbors no resentment at
all toward his father. In fact, he is
grateful; "If it wasn't for Dad, I
wouldn't be here." Instead of creat
ing a rebellious and hostile son, his
father created a self-assured basket
ball player. Or rather, his father laid
the foundations, but Novian Whitsitt
is ultimately responsible for the
player and person he has become.
