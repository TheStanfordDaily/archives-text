# Women hoopsters look to end skid
## UCLA, 49ers visit Maples 
### PABLO MORALES Staff sportswriter 
By Jan. 25, the Stanford women's
basketball team had amassed a total
of nine victories and — in the midst of
a four-game winning streak —
seemed well on the way of exceeding
its team goal of 10 wins for the
season.
One month later, the Cardinal still
hasn't been able to notch win No.
10, and with games against league
leading Long Beach State and UCLA
at Maples Pavilion tonight and to
morrow, reaching the decade mark
won't be any easier.
The 49ers enter tonight's game at
Maples with a 22-2 overall record.
Ranked fourth in the nation, Long

Beach sits atop the Western Col
legiate Athletic Association with a
10-1 league mark.
A 70-65 Long Beach loss to USC
two weeks ago is the only blemish on
an otherwise perfect WCAA record.
However, it was only a minor set
back. With consecutive victories over
ASU, 88-76, Arizona, 85-55, and
Northern Arizona, 95-61, the 49ers
appear to have established a firm grip
on an NCAA tournament bid.
The 49ers' potent offensive attack
is spearheaded by the duo of 6-foot
-2 forward Cindy Brown and 6-3 cen
ter Kirsten Cummings. They are two
main reasons why the 49ers have one
of the most prolific scoring offenses in
the nation.

Only in her second year. Brown has
emerged as a dominant force in the
WCAA. Deadly accurate from the
outside — shooting 58 percent from
the field — she leads the team with a
20.4 points per game average. She
also leads the 49ers in rebounding,
pulling down an average of 10.2
boards an outing.
Cummings contributes a solid 16
points and 10 rebounds a game for
Long Beach. Her strong inside game
adds another dimension to the 49er
scoring machine, and at 56 percent,
her shooting percentage isn't'too
shabby either.
The 8-4 Bruins have been relent
less in their drive for an NCAA
tournament bid. After losing their

first three conference games, the
Bruins have since won eight of nine
WCAA matchups.
The most noteworthy of these was
an 86-64 victory over San Diego
State, a win which bolted the Bruins
into third place and solidified their
chances for postseason action.
The play of 5-10 junior guard
Anne Dean is the main reason for the
recent Bruin surge. She leads the
team in scoring at 14.4 points a game,
and on the free-throw line there is no
equal. Her 91.3 percent (63-of-69)
from the foul line is the highest mark
in the nation.
Game time both nights at Maples is
7:30 p.m.
