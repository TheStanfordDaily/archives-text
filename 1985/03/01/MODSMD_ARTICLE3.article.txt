"It is a marvelous opportunity for us to
have one of Auguste Rodin's greatest
pieces," Art Prof. Albert Elsen said yester
day morning while watching the installation
of one of Rodin's most famous and contro
versial works, "Monument to Balzac."
The 3,000-pound cast likeness of Honore
Balzac was installed atop a tall pedestal on
the west side of Meyer Library in a three
hour operation.
"It's fitting that it is put in front of the li
brary because this man (Balzac) wrote
enough books to fill a library." Elsen said.
"It's a monument not just to a writer, but to
a creator, a man who holds the world in his
brain."
Rodin's monument to the French writer
also represented his worst critical defeat. El
sen said.
"When it was first exhibited in 1898, it
was a disaster," he said. "The people who
commissioned it rejected it.and thev thouuht

Balzac had lost his skill and that the whole
thing was a bad joke. They felt it was ugly
and badly made because it looked like it was
about to fall over."
Rodin was commissioned by a literary so
ciety headed by French writer Emile Zola to
design a fitting monument to Balzac that
would be placed in the square between the
Louvre and the Palais Royale in Paris. Be
cause Rodin never met Balzac, who had died
30 years earlier, he compensated by studying
numerous drawings, prints and paintings of
his subject. Many of the more than 50
studies of Balzac made by Rodin are perma
nently displayed in the Cantor Rotunda of
the Stanford Art Museum.
Elsen said the reaction of the commis
sioners and the public was so adverse that
the monument was never erected and Rodin
returned the money advanced to him. Rodin
felt humiliated by the entire episode, and all
bronze castings were made bv the French

government after his death.
Despite the criticism. Rodin resisted the
temptation to conform his vision of Balzac to a
customary portrait pose.
"Rodin always felt what he had done was
right and he felt really strongly that he had
captured the essential Balzac," Elsen said.
According to Elsen, the very qualities of the
sculpture that the critics disliked are what make
it "a symbol of artistic creation.
"In the sculpture, Balzac is walking, meditat
ing and looking up," Elsen said. "His concep
tion was of a Balzac working at night in his
bathrobe during a glimpse of inspiration. The
exaggerated tilt is caused by the movement of
taking a step, which also sculpturally produces a
very powerful diagonal form."
The sculpture's exaggerated features, particu
larly the nose and bushy eyebrows, were
dramatically emphasized by Rodin. Elsen said
the silhouette was very important, particularly
the way the flowing robe builds to the head, ac
centing Balzac's prominent features.

"When he modeled Balzac. Rodin kept in
mind that (the figure) would not be seen close
up," Elsen said. "That's why he took a lot of
liberties in the modeling of the anatomy. That
makes the sculpture 'carrv' from a distance and
Balzac's identity would be more apparent."
Elsen said placing the cast on a pedestal is im
portant to achieve the perspective Rodin in
tended.
"The pedestal is necessary because the
sculpture was conceived to be seen from below
and from a distance. Pedestals have been used
since antiquity to get sculptures off the ground
so that they can be better seen, so that in a
public space they're above the heads of the
crowd.
This sculpture is considered an important ad
dition to the University's burgeoning collection
of Rodin works, including design papers and the
recently installed "Gates of Hell."
The Balzac cast will be at the University for
only a year, however, as it is on loan from the Los
Angeles County Museum of Art. The museum
is currently building a new wing on the site of
the sculpture's previous location, and the
sculpture will be returned when the construc
tion is complete.

Balzac's identity would be more apparent."
Elsen said placing the cast on a pedestal is im
portant to achieve the perspective Rodin in
tended.
"The pedestal is necessary because the
sculpture was conceived to be seen from below
and from a distance. Pedestals have been used
since antiquity to get sculptures off the ground
so that they can be better seen, so that in a
public space they're above the heads of the
crowd.
This sculpture is considered an important ad
dition to the University's burgeoning collection
of Rodin works, including design papers and the
recently installed "Gates of Hell."
The Balzac cast will be at the University for
only a year, however, as it is on loan from the Los
Angeles County Museum of Art. The museum
is currently building a new wing on the site of
the sculpture's previous location, and the
sculpture will be returned when the construc
tion is complete.
