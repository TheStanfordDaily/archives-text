"It is a marvelous opportunity for us to
have one of Auguste Rodin's greatest
pieces," Art Prof. Albert Elsen said yester
day morning while watching the installation
of one of Rodin's most famous and contro
versial works, "Monument to Balzac."
The 3,000-pound cast likeness of Honore
Balzac was installed atop a tall pedestal on
the west side of Meyer Library in a three
hour operation.
"It's fitting that it is put in front of the li
brary because this man (Balzac) wrote
enough books to fill a library." Elsen said.
"It's a monument not just to a writer, but to
a creator, a man who holds the world in his
brain."
Rodin's monument to the French writer
also represented his worst critical defeat. El
sen said.
"When it was first exhibited in 1898, it
was a disaster," he said. "The people who
commissioned it rejected it.and thev thouuht

Balzac had lost his skill and that the whole
thing was a bad joke. They felt it was ugly
and badly made because it looked like it was
about to fall over."
Rodin was commissioned by a literary so
ciety headed by French writer Emile Zola to
design a fitting monument to Balzac that
would be placed in the square between the
Louvre and the Palais Royale in Paris. Be
cause Rodin never met Balzac, who had died
30 years earlier, he compensated by studying
numerous drawings, prints and paintings of
his subject. Many of the more than 50
studies of Balzac made by Rodin are perma
nently displayed in the Cantor Rotunda of
the Stanford Art Museum.
Elsen said the reaction of the commis
sioners and the public was so adverse that
the monument was never erected and Rodin
returned the money advanced to him. Rodin
felt humiliated by the entire episode, and all
bronze castings were made bv the French
