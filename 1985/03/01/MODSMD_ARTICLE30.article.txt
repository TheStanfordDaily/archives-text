# Netters focus on doubles
## 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
If you were forced to name one aspect of the
No. 1-ranked Stanford men's tennis team that
perhaps needs more stability or consistency, the
answer would probably be in doubles.
So this weekend, attention will be focused on
the Pacific Coast Doubles Tournament in La
Jolla, where all the "biggies" — including three
Cardinal doubles teams — will battle it out.
Heading into regular season play soon against
opponents like UCLA and USC, the time for
defining winning doubles teams is fast approach
ing. The tournament this weekend should give
Coach Dick Gould a good indication of where his
players-stand in relation to each other as
teammates — and in relation to other top Cali
fornia doubles teams.
One doubles pair Stanford does appear to have
securely intact is that of Jim Grabb and John
Letts. They are 4-0 in dual match competition
and 7-2 overall.
"The tournament is really good because we go
down there and just concentrate on doubles,
nothing else," Grabb said. "All the good teams
will be there."
Stanford has entered the teams of Dan Goldie

and Eric Rosenfeld at No. 2 and Derrick Ros
tagno and Pat McEnroe at No. 3.
McEnroe said the No. 3 doubles spot is under
scrutiny from Gould, and the way he and Ros
tagno play this weekend is important to main
taining the position.

"He (Gould) pretty much has the first two
teams, so this should be a good test for us,"
McEnroe said. "If we can play well, we'll prob
ably end up playing together, but you never
really know — coach knows better than I do."
Rostagno is also looking forward to the chance
to play well. "Pat and I have a lot of potential. In
the past few weeks we've made some big im
provements. We've had a couple of good matches
that were challenging and that we won. We got
some confidence," he said.
Rostagno was referring to the doubles title he
and McEnroe won in the Northern California In
tercollegiates at San Jose State a week ago with a
straight set victory over Fresno State's Paul
Roybal and Bill Wakefield.
When asked how it feels to play with a partner
— McEnroe — who gets more attention because
of his name, Rostagno said it really doesn't affect
his playing.
" We're a team out there. I know he's a popular
guy with or without his name," Rostagno said.
"Actually, I think it puts a lot of pressure on him.
He seems to accept it, though, and doesn't talk
much about it."
Stanford's next dual match is at San Jose State
Tuesday at 2 p.m.
