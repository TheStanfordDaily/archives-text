# Women fencers at West Regionals

Stanford Women's Fencing Coach
Buzz Hurst and his squad of five fen
cers left yesterday afternoon for the
NCAA Western Regionals in
Pasadena, fully expecting to fence in
the team competition today and the
individual competition tomorrow.
Problem is, as Hurst discovered an
hour before leaving on Thursday, the
meet doesn't start until tomorrow. So.
Hurst and his team will probably be
doing nothing more than catching a
little HBO in a Pasadena motel
tonight, and getting ready to defend
their No. 1 seeding in the eight-team
tournament tomorrow.
The other teams in the meet are

l ong Beach State, Air Force, Texas,
Fullerton State, San Jose State, UC-
San Diego and host Cal Tech.
Stanford enters the regionals with a
13-2 record, marred only by losses to
Wisconsin and Air Force. In the latter
defeat, the Cardinal was hurt by the
injury-related absence of No. 2 fen
cer Holly Taylor, who is healthy now
and should make a difference in the
rematch against the Falcons.
Taylor, who sports a record of 45-
10, placed 12th in the National Junior
Olympics in February.
Stanford's biggest weapon in the
tournament, and the best bet to take
individual honors, is Ail-American
Jennifer Yu. She has won 55 matches
against only two losses this season.
