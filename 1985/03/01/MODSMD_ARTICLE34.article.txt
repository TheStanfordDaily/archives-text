Some volleyball games are decided before the
teams walk out on the court. I his afternoon's non
league contest pitting sixth-ranked Stanford against
St. Mary s in Moraga is one of those games. The
match will begin at 4 p.m. and should end shortly
thereafter.
To get an idea about the weakness of the Gaels, a
team that was elevated to varsity status just last
year and competes as an independent, one could
observe that they fell to Loyola-Marymount last
week in three sets. Ihe Cardinal manhandled the
Lions Wednesday in a league match, 15-8, 1 S-) 2,
8-15, 15-8.
Or, one might look back to last year, when Stan
lord spiked St. Mary s in three sets — twice. In the
first meeting, the Gaels lost 15-1, 15-3. 15-2. But
as the year progressed, the St. Mary's squad im
proved. It managed to take eight games from
Stanford in their second match, eventually crum
bling, 15-4, 1 5-3, 15-1.
They're building very rapidly," said Cardinal
Co-coach Don Shaw, whose team boasts a 6-3
record in the California Intercollegiate Volleyball
Association, good enough for fourth place.
" I hey're coached by a Russian defector who really
seems to know his volleyball. They're an improved
team, but they just don't have the talent."
Shaw pointed to a B-league intramural basket
ball game that was being played on the Maples
Pavilion floor. "The first year, it was it he |ust
pulled six guys from ovei there," lie said.
Shaw will look for Ins team to put in a good, hard
effort. After Wednesday's game with Loyola
v Mary mount, he was disappointed that the men
* played down to their opponent's level. "We didn't
respect them enough," he said. "Great teams don't
let the opponent bring them clown. Right now
we're just a pretty good team."
