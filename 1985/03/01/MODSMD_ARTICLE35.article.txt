The Stanford men's and women's gymnastics
teams will both compete in four-way meets
tonight in Southern California. Because the
dual meet season is nearing an end, the outcomes
will be important to both teams' chances at NCAA
qualification.
I he men will face seventh-ranked UCLA in Los
Angeles, along with Fullerton State and California,
while the women face fourth-ranked Fullerton
State, USC and Nebraska.
"We're not looking to win this meet," said Asst.
Coach I'aul Hausladen of the women's team. "We
are going to put an effort into being consistent and
hopefully stay as close behind Fullerton as we pos
sibly can. We would like to break our team record
of 183.25. This would definitely improve our
regional seeding."
Currently, the Cardinal women are battling for
the No. 3 ranking in the Western Region with
Washington. Fullerton is seeded No. 2 and Oregon
State is No. I. The Cardinal women were unoffi
cially ranked 10th nationally as of Feb. 15.
"Tonight's competition is important to us be
cause two home meets and three away meet scores
count toward NCAA qualification," Hausladen
said. "So tar we have one good away meet score, so
tonight's competition is crucial."
Hie Cardinal women will have another meet to
morrow night at San Diego State against Utah
State and Long Beach and the A/tecs.
" This should be a relatively low key competition,
but that depends on how we do at Fullerton,"
Ilausladen said. "It we do well tonight, we will alter
the lineup in tomorrow's meet so some of the all
arounders can have a rest while other team mem
bers get a chance to compete."
The Cardinal men are currently ranked 10th na
tionally based on the past few meet scores.
