I he Stanford softball team will he trying to break
a season-long trend today and tomorrow and get
started on what its coach says should he a respec
table first season in the Western Collegiate Athletic
Association.
The Cardinal, 5-11, will play at San Jose City
College today at 3 p.m. before returning to Ruble
112 ield tomorrow for a double-header against
Nevada-Reno that begins at noon.
"We have a tendency to play to the level of our
opponent," Stanford Coach Kathy Lincoln said.
"We play well against the better teams and not as
well as we should against the lesser teams.
"With our lirst league game March 15, we need
to start beating the teams we should, because I
think we can finish in the middle of the WCAA."
I he Cardinal will get a chance to do so — and
avenge a Feb. 22 double-header loss to San Jose
City — tomorrow. Against the 7-0 Jaguars, Stan
ford might face Jeanette Booth, 5-0, who is a
probable starter, according to Coach Sam Huerta.
Booth won the lirst game against the Cardinal Feb.
Lincoln said Stanford needs to match the
Jaguars' high enthusiasm and intensity.
"We should be up for it." she said, "because we
lost two to them and because they're a city college
and they get up when they play four-year schools.
I hen strength is that they're young and they get
excited. ... It wouldn't be cool to lose to them."
The Cardinal, however, must improve its hitting,
Lincoln said. "Unfortunately, we're in a total team
slump. Against Sonoma State (Feb. Hi), Hayward
State (Feb. 15) and San Francisco State (Feb. 14).
we were hitting the ball well. But we only had three
hits against Cal."
Among regulars, sophomore catcher Margaret
Pezzini leads the Cardinal with a .2<Sf> batting
average. Sophomore third baseman Christy Fis
calini has a team-leadinp six RBls.
