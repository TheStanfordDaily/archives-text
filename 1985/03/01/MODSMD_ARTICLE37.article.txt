After eight straight home vic
tories hy a combined 64-4 margin,
the Stanford women's tennis team
takes its No. I -ranked show on the
road this weekend.
Though tomorrow's match at
Fullerton State — a team Stanford
opened the season by beating 9-0
— should be a pushover, Sunday's
contest at San Diego State will be
any thing but a breeze.
The Aztecs were ranked third in
the preseason poll and have since
dropped to a tie for ninth with
California — a team Stanford
defeated 7-0 — but that doesn't
make them any easier to beat, ac

cording to Cardinal Couch Frank
Brennan.
"It's always a little difficult to
play the hard teams any place."
Brennan said. "But playing San
Diego State at San Diego State has
always been tough for lis.
"There usually is a hostile
crowd and we've never had a
match there when we haven't had
an argument on a line call or a
score or something."
Assuming Stanford beats
Fullerton tomorrow, it will enter
Sunday's match with an 9-0 record
and a 35-match winning streak,
something the Aztecs — twice
losers to the Cardinal last year —
would love to break.
