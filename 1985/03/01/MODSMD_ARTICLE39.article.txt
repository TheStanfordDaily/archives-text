## Showers add to atmosphere at the Tonga Room

Tonga Room Restaurant
Fairmont Hotel
950 Mason
San Francisco
772-5278
Sitting atop Nob Hill in San Fran
cisco, the Fairmont Hotel takes up an
entire block with its imposing archi
tecture. But in one corner it harbors a
re-creation of South Sea island ex
otique — the Tonga Room Restau
rant — complete with the requisite
palms, open thatched huts, a "coral
reef' and friendly service.
The restaurant grew up around a
swimming pool that used to be called
"The Plunge" in the early 1900s.
Masts, yardarms and other hardware
were brought in from the dismantled
S.S. Forester, a four-masted lumber
schooner that sailed the South Seas
from 1900 to 1932. The ship was
built by Hay and Wright of Alameda
and has come to a fitting resting
place, at least in part.
The pool has been painted on the
bottom to look like a mass of coral
reefs, but it's actually just strangely
mottled. The tables are arranged
around it, and a three-person band
plays easy music in a boat in the
middle.
In the actual islands about 3,000
miles southwest of Honolulu, the
tropical days are mild, with frequent
rainstorms. It is no different at the
Tonga Room, where every ten
minutes or so there are selective
showers and thunder and lightning —
sprinklers above the edge of the pool
simply start pouring, it seems, every
time another party is seated around
the pool. The effect is quaint at first,
but can interfere with conversation
after a while.
There is, however, no occasion for
annoyance; there is a long list of tall,
cool cocktails to choose from to begin
the evening. The bracing concoctions
of fruit juices and rum, gin or what

not ($4 to $6) are fun drinks — my
companion's Royal Hawaiian came in
a hollowed pineapple with two bright
miniature umbrellas, and my Hur
ricane arrived in an unusually shaped
glass with a two-foot straw (you keep
the glass). Each was $6.
The Tonga Room is celebrating the
Chinese Lunar New Year through
Sunday with a special dinner, which
occasioned our visit. During the rest
of the year it is still a basically
Chinese restaurant with a few
Polynesian pretensions. In addition to
tofu, egg rolls, won ton and sweet and
sour pork, the Tonga serves curry
dishes such as Tahitian Prawns
($14.50), as well as South Sea desserts
and cocktails.
The Year of the Ox dinner starts
with four appetizers: Silver Dragon
Roll, a finely chopped shrimp roll;
Drum of Heaven, a batter-fried
chicken drumstick; Siew Mi, a minced
pork dumpling; and Ha Gow, a
shrimp dumpling. This is a tasty com
bination, and very well-prepared —
probably the best part of the dinner.
(There's a fine, varied list of ap
petizers on the a la carte menu, too,
including: barbecued spareribs
($6.75), crispy won ton ($4.25), im
perial egg rolls ($4.75), butterfly
prawns ($8), pork bom bom ($4.50);
and Peking pot stickers ($3.75), mu
shui pork ($5.25) and minced squab
($7.75) as specialty appetizers.)
The New Year dinner's pike maw
soup — diced pike maw with crab
meat in "succulent" chicken broth —
was so delicately flavored as to be
tasteless. The ingredients were
generous, but the tastes just didn't
bud during cooking.
The entrees featured a seasonal
Chinese vegetable plate — a combi
nation of vermicelli, bean curd, bam
boo shoots and fat choy, which the
maitre'd told us had Buddhist origins
— plus a choice of two other main
dishes. We chose the pineapple duck.

slices of roast duckling with sweet and
sour pineapple sauce, and pork
Macao, sliced barbecued pork, stir
fried with snow pea pods, onions and
baby corn ears.
The other choices were twin mush
room chicken (thin strips of chicken,
stir fried with straw mushroom, black
mushroom and water chestnut in a
hot spicy sauce), the seafood combi
nation (with sauteed slices of sea
cucumbers, prawns, scallops and
fresh squid with Chinese vegetables
in a ginger and garlic sauce), and
double squid (fresh squid and dried
squid with a julienne of ginger and
green onion).
Dinner was served with a choice of
chef s fried rice or plain steamed rice,
followed by a choice of dessert —
Chinese Jade, creme de menthe over
pineapple sherbet, or Tropical Snow
ball, vanilla ice cream rolled in
shredded coconut with chocolate
sauce — neither of which is particu
larly Chinese nor exciting. The more
traditional might be to serve fruit or a
sweet soup, rather than a rich dessert.
The New Year's meal is $ 16.50 per
person and generally savory. Dishes
are carefully prepared and presented
beautifully, with impeccable service.
But they are stock Chinese meals
regardless of the exotic-sounding
names; these are common dishes. It is
the atmosphere and the sheer kick of
having it "rain" inside that makes the
Tonga Room an evening of fun (the
enormous cocktails may have some
thing to do with it, too). In one sense,
it's all too hokey, but we got caught
up with it all and even danced to an
old song.
Even if you don't make it to the
Fairmont Tonga Room for the New
Year's celebration — when the lobby
of the hotel is decorated with fans,
bamboo and rickshaw — the Tonga
serves other dinners throughout the
year.
The Tonga Specialty ($13.00 per
person for two or more persons)
serves two appetizers, egg flower

soup and three entrees. The Golden
Gourmet ($17.75 per person for two
or more) has the same number of
dishes, but with more "luxurious"
main dishes such as the lichee prawns,
large prawns, pineapple, green pep
pers and lichee nuts in sweet and sour
sauce.
The Empress Delight ($18.75 per
person for two or more) features
three appetizers, soup and three
entrees including the Dragon and
Phoenix, cubes of chicken and prawns
in a sweet and sour sauce. The Im
perial Banquet, served for three or
more persons ($35 per person) tops
the dinner specialties; there are six
appetizers and a whole array of
entrees. All dinners end with Jasmine
tea, fortune cookies and mints.
Any of the dinners would be a solid
experience in Chinese food, if you
aren't familiar with it; there is at least
one sweet and sour dish and one stir
fried dish in each menu, two of the
requisite ways of preparing Chinese
food.
The rest of the menu consists of a
wide range of seafood, meats, curries
and the usual chow mein and chop
suey (which is more American than
Chinese). Peking duck is available at
$27.50 and 24 hours notice, and
Hawaiian eggs and ham is offered at
$6.75.
Next time at the Tonga Room I
would probably try the Whole Bay
rock cod steamed with fresh ginger,
soy sauce and green onions — among
other things — because steamed fish is a
Cantonese specialty. (In case the dis
tinction means anything, the Tonga
Room primarily serves dishes from
the Canton province of China.)
If the Chinese food isn't what
thrills you, assuming you're there for
the showers, then there are lamb chops
($l3) or New York strip steak ($l6).
Either way, the Tonga Room is worth
a visit next time you're in San Fran
cisco.

The Year of the Ox is just beginning, and the Tonga Restaurant is
joining with the rest of San Francisco to celebrate the New Year. To
morrow night is the climax of the festivities, with the 150-foot Golden
Dragon parading through downtown.
