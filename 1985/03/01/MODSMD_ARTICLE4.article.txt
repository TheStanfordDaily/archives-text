Norm Robinson will make a decision
this morning on whether to accept an
Interfraternity Council (IPC) recom
mendation to end the probation of
the Phi Delta Theta fraternity.
The report, issued by a four
member IFC special judicial commit
tee, "recommends the immediate ter
mination of the Phi Delt suspension,"
citing "increased awareness in the
house towards hazing" and greater
"discipline and responsibility towards
social events."
The Phi Delts were put on proba
tion Jan. 25 after Robinson alleged
that the fraternity pressured its
pledges "to drink large amounts of al
cohol in a short time span" during the
first week of winter quarter. While on
probation, the Phi Delts were
restricted from throwing any open or
ciosed parties or holding any social
gatherings, but Res Ed granted them
special permission to throw a non
alcoholic party.
IFC President Rick Hoskins ex
plained that the recommendation to
end the probation is based on the
positive steps the Phi Delts have
taken in the past month.
"Since the Pln Delta have been put
on probation, they've taken steps to
ensure that this would not happen
again in the future," he said. "In my

opinion, they've shown themselves to
he incredibly responsive and respon
sible. That's our main reason for
recommending that they be taken off
probation."
Both Robinson and Phi Delt Presi
dent Andy Cohen, scheduled to meet
together this morning, refused to
comment on the report yesterday.
The report commended specific
ways that the Phi Delts responded to
the probation. The fraternity pro
posed to next year's Phi Delt pledge
trainers that the drinking game in
question be terminated, along with
any other event that "is likely to
cause bodily danger, physical harm
or personal degradation or disgrace
resulting in physical or mental harm."
But one section of the report asks,
"Is it so desirable to reduce entirely
(peer) pressure when a definite part
of our Stanford experience will hope
fully be to have learned to cope with
outside pressures that will inevitably
confront us when we leave Stan
ford?"
In response to the University's
placing the Phi Delts on probation, an
IPC committee is currently attempt
ing to define precisely what con
stitutes hazing. Hoskins explained
that hazing is not currently well
dclincd, noting that harmless drink
ing games could easilv fall under the
