# ABT's 'Coppelia' is an exuberant ballet experience
## 
### STEPHANIE SANDBERG 
The biggest difference between an
evening of full-length ballet and one
of repertory ballet is the ability of the
full-length score to engage the audi
ence beyond the impressive mechan
ics of the dancers themselves.
Repertory dance challenges the
audience to summon critical reserve
when faced with titles such as "Airs,"
"Theme and Variations" and "Field,
Chair and Mountain"; such involve
ment on the part of the observer
makes for greater exhilaration and
greater disappointments.
Classical scores and choreography,
such as last Thursday night's
"Coppelia," at the Opera House, are
a lot of fun. With a company such as
the American Ballet Theater, there is
unlikely to be much to fault with the
dancing. However, when one is
caught up with the story of the dance,
however simple it may be, the stun
ning skill of the dancers comes as a
repeated, startling surprise.
"Coppelia," written in 1870 by the
French composer Delibes, is as ex

überant as the story and dance which
accompany it. Based on a story by
E.T.A. Hoffman — the same tale that
moved Offenbach to stage the Doll
Act in his opera, "The Tales of Hof
fman" — the ballet is fast-moving,
adventurous, romantic and funny.
George Balanchine called it "ballet's
great comedy," and there are indeed
sections near the end which border on
the slapstick.
The principal dancers in last
Thursday night's show were Martine
van Hamel and Patrick Bissell, who
complemented each other well and,
in their solos, showed why they were
chosen as the principal performers.
Van Hamel danced a brilliant second
act, in which she must win back the
love of Franz by standing in for the
"Coppelia," a mechanical doll that
Franz has fallen for when he saw her
at the balcony in Act I. She kicks
high, overturns things and ultimately
fools the doctor and wins back the
love of Franz. Occasional unsteady
moments came when she had to hold
a pose on toe without using Bissell's

help. We were told by a bartender
that when Cynthia Gregory had done
it the night before, even the dancers
paused to admire.
Bissell's role was less spectacular,
but he executed it with a vigorous
boyishness that was exactly appropri
ate for a young man about to marry.
He is exceptionally tall, which made
him seem the leader of the pack, as
well as the corps de ballet, when he
danced with the other men in the
group of his village friends. He wasn't
allowed to show off until Act 111,
during the wedding feast of Swan
hilda and Franz, but it was worth the
wait: His height on the jumps and his
extension were breathtaking.
Michael Owen played a wonder
fully comic crotchety Dr. Coppelius,
the dollmaker. Other soloists gave
good performances as well, most
notably Christine Spizzo as Aurora,
and Chrisa Keranaidas in the dance
of the prayer, as well as the women
who played Swanhilda's close village
friends.
The ballet corps as a whole was in

fine form, and the Delibes score,
played by the San Francisco Opera
Orchestra, was well conducted by
ABTs Alan Barker. The finest mo
ments of the ballet were in Act 11,
when both the comedy and perfor
mance level of the dancing lent a
magic that was notably absent in Acts
I and 111. The dolls, the half-crazed
doctor who thinks his Coppelia has fi
nally come to life, drunken Franz and
charming Swanhilda all swept the au
dience into their fantasy in a way that
the village scenes, except for the
obligatory leaps by the principals in
the finale, couldn't compare. It was a
wonderfully eerie moment when the
curtain closed on Act (I and the Doc
tor sat with his hands at his head, and
his mechanical inventions rolled on
the stage around him, out of control.
The American Ballet Theater will
perform at the War Memorial Opera
House in San Francisco through Sun
day. Repertory evenings are Tuesday
through Friday; "Don Quixote" will
show tomorrow and Sunday at 2
and K p.m.
