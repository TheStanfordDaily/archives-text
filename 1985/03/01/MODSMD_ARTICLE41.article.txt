# The 						whales are parading through Monterey Bay

So you've been to the Monterey Bay Aquarium. You
brushed the batrays and coddled the chitons; you learned
that "squids like orgies but octopuses like close
encounters," and absorbed other marine sex-life trivia; you
watched dolphin MTV and looked through a dark glass at
the frolicking sea otters. Now must you "go down to the
seas again, to the lonely sea and sky?"
Of course you must. Just when you thought the Pacific
had revealed all its mysteries to you, via the well-planned
but eminently "safe" aquarium, the Monterey shores of
fer a more adventurous outing for marine lovers. Al
though you won't be venturing into Soviet waters with
Greenpeace to save the whales, you can easily take to
the rolling waves of Monterey Bay to watch the whales.
The typical whale-watching cruise takes a boatload of
20 to 60 people a few miles offshore for about two
hours. With the aid of a "naturalist," passengers keep a
lookout for the telltale plume of water from a whale's

possible to the sighted whale, and the passengers grab
their cameras in hopes of another spectacular spouting.
(A zoom lens is not required.)
Although a variety of whales may put in appearances
off the California coast, the most likely of the mammoth
mammals to cavort near a cruise ship is the gray whale.
Known to biologists as Eschrichtius robust us, the gray
whale averages 45 feet when full grown and is a paragon
of predictability. From December to March gray whales
migrate from Alaska to their calving lagoons in the Baja
region, in a progression of groups segregated by age and
i sex; the order of the groups reverses in March when the
whales head home to the feeding grounds in the Bering
Sea, completing their journey around June.
Because the migration southward peaked as predicted in
mid-February, marine biologists expect with similar cer
tainty that the whales' northern migration will reach its
height the first two weeks of March. According to one
naturalist's estimate, the gray whales should pass through
Monterey Peninsula waters at a rate of 20 per hour during
that period, guaranteeing some exciting close encounters.
The whales' regularity in coming up for air is another
plus for whale-watchers. You may catch in the corner of
your eye only the last flip of a gray tail, but you can
count on getting a better view in approximately seven
minutes for most whales. They do move around, of
course, but that only ensures that you don't have to worry
about finding a single favorable spot on ship.
Other marine mammals, including sea otters, sea lions
and different species of whales and dolphins, may also

fndeed, the tour leaders welcome opportunities to fill up
no-whale lulls with alternative animal sightings or inter

esting details about the gray whales and recent develop
ments in legislation concerning them. But unlike the
aquarium, with its plethora of colloquial but fact-filled
placards, the whale-watching cruises provide a much
more "take it or leave it" approach to their scientific
sides. You can soak in rays as easily as knowledge, should
you choose.
Don't, however, expect to work on an all-body tan
while on deck. Most cruise companies recommend
wearing warm clothing, soft-soled shoes and sunglasses —
sunscreen if you burn easily. Although trips may be can
celed due to inclement weather and sea conditions, the
boats will lurch and lean from time to time; avoiding
eating greasy foods or drinking alcohol will prevent sea
sickness for most people, but if you are sensitive to motion

sickness or "gastric awareness," you probably should stick
to looking at the whale models in the aquarium.
Several companies operate whale-watching cruises from
Monterey's Old Fisherman's Wharf with competitive
prices. For instance, Monterey Sport Fishing charges
$8 for adults and $5 for children under 12, and ac
cepts the major credit cards. If you're a card-carrying
member of a non-profit environmental organization, such
as the Monterey Bay Aquarium or California Academy of
Sciences, the fare is $1.00 less. Reservations are recom
mended for the cruises, which depart between 10 a.m. and
4 p.m. daily, and passengers should check in a half hour in
advance.

To get to Monterey, take Highway 101 south to exit

156 west (several miles past 156 east). Stay on 156 as it
joins Highway 1 leading into the city. Look for the well
placed pale brown signs that give directions to a variety of
tourist spots, obtain a map in advance or ask one of the
reasonably friendly natives or military types milling about
how to get to the wharf; you can also operate on the
premise "wharfs are near water and water is west." Take
quarters for parking meters.
Weekend time near the end of the quarter is precious,
but a one-day trip to Monterey combining whale watch
ing, the aquarium and its Cannery Row environs is not
only possible but worth it. If you're caught up in your
classes, make it a two-day trip and take in nearby Carmel
and a celebrity- and crowd-less Pebble Beach.


The first two weeks of March are expected to bring multitudes of whales through
the waters around Monterey Bay. Whale-watching cruises provide an excellent

alternative or complement to the Monterey Bay Aquarium, and can be arranged
for any day of the week.
