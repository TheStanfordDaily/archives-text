## Medical school focuses on Third World problems 
### JOEL BELLENSON 
Stanford Mcdical Center is joining
the trend toward addressing the
medCcal problems of Third World
countries with the creation of a
"geographic medicine" division and
the inception of a research group to
study parasitic diseases, according to
medical school officials.
Dr. Tag Mansour, chairman of the
medical school's Department of
Pharmacology, said that during the
past two years a renewed interest has
emerged in the diseases afflicting the
three billion people living in less
developed countries.
Mansour and six Stanford col
leagues will join researchers from
11 other institutions in a study of
parasitic diseases financed by a $20
million grant from the John D. and
Catherine T. Mac Arthur Foundation,
a Chicago-based philanthropic group.
'The medical center has received $1.5
million of this for parasite research.
The research will take an interdis
ciplinary approach, drawing together
specialists in parasitology and experts
in other fields. According to Man
sour. this team will use the techniques
of molecular biology and bio
chemistry to study parasite develop
ment and survival, potency and
reproduction.
In addition, a new "geographic
medicine" division, distinct from the
Mac Arthur Foundation study, has
been set up at the medical school to
investigate Third World diseases.
"By committing new resources and
technology toward finding solutions
for medical problems largely ignored
bv Western medicine, we have the

potential for bringing new aid to a
large portion of the world's people,"
said Dr. Gary Schoolnik, the divi
sion's chief and assistant professor of
medicine and medical microbiology.
Faculty members involved with the
new division are already conducting
molecular and genetic studies of the
organisms that cause the deadly liver
disease schistomiasis, African sleep
ing sickness, diarrhea, cholera,
gonorrhea and fungal diseases en
demic to South America, Schoolnik
said.
Collaboration with researchers in
the Third World will result in "oil
location" testing of potential drug or
vaccine products. Schoolnik said af
filiations with health workers in
South America, Bangladesh and
Kenya are under consideration.
The new division also will focus on
medical training and clinical care.
The overseas affiliates could permit
students and researchers to study and
train abroad and allow foreign re
searchers to train at Stanford, School
nik said.
According to Mansour, when the
colonial powers relinquished control
of many Third World countries in the
19605, the already small amount of
money spent on research of exotic
diseases virtually vanished.
Mansour said the "lack of support
by developed countries may have
been shortsighted even in their own
interests, since international tourists
and businessmen are consistently
exposed to exotic diseases . . . offer
ing the possibility of spreading the
often-debilitating conditions here."
More than 300 travelers each year

contract a parasitic infection. Man
sour said. The 500,000 Southeast
Asian refugees and the large influx of
Central American refugees pose po
tential health care problems in the
United States.
Eradicating these diseases makes
good economic sense, according to
Mansour. The interest of organiza
tions such as the World Bank con
firms that hypothesis, he said.
"Stanford, as one of the great in
ternational centers for biological and
medical research, has a responsibil
ity to do research in neglected areas,"
Mansour said. "There is already
much research being performed for
affluent society diseases such as can
cer, stroke and diabetes."
Mansour said he rejects the notion
that overpopulation is the primary
cause of disease. California's climate
is similar to East Africa's anil would
have similar problems of hunger and
disease if not for the differential of
wealth, he said. "In addition, if par
ents could have a guarantee that their
children could survive beyond five
years of age. they would not have to
have as many."
Mansour also said he thinks
mosquito extermination campaigns
and other public health campaigns ul
timately fail because insects "learn
biochemistry faster than we do." He
said agricultural improvements such
as the Aswan Dam in Egypt, his
native country, have helped spread
parasites widely, especially the snail,
the intermediate host of schis
tomiasis.

often-debilitating conditions here."
More than 300 travelers each year

contract a parasitic infection. Man
sour said. The 500,000 Southeast
Asian refugees and the large influx of
Central American refugees pose po
tential health care problems in the
United States.
Eradicating these diseases makes
good economic sense, according to
Mansour. The interest of organiza
tions such as the World Bank con
firms that hypothesis, he said.
"Stanford, as one of the great in
ternational centers for biological and
medical research, has a responsibil
ity to do research in neglected areas,"
Mansour said. "There is already
much research being performed for
affluent society diseases such as can
cer, stroke and diabetes."
Mansour said he rejects the notion
that overpopulation is the primary
cause of disease. California's climate
is similar to East Africa's anil would
have similar problems of hunger and
disease if not for the differential of
wealth, he said. "In addition, if par
ents could have a guarantee that their
children could survive beyond five
years of age. they would not have to
have as many."
Mansour also said he thinks
mosquito extermination campaigns
and other public health campaigns ul
timately fail because insects "learn
biochemistry faster than we do." He
said agricultural improvements such
as the Aswan Dam in Egypt, his
native country, have helped spread
parasites widely, especially the snail,
the intermediate host of schis
tomiasis.
