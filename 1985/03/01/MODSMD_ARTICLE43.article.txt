## Natalie Cole takes the spotlight with ease The 						legendary Nat King Cole's daughter proves she can hold her own 
### R. TAEZA PIERCE Editorial staff 
Clad in a sleeveless red sequin
trimmed dress, Natalie Cole strutted
onto the narrow stage at the Fairmont
Hotel's Venetian Room last Tuesday
night and proved, once again, that she
is far more than the daughter of the
legendary crooner Nat King Cole
(famous for such classics as "The
Christmas Song").
Cole was striking against the ornate
background of the Venetian Room,
with its high ceilings, red brocade cur
tains and elegant chandeliers. For an
hour and a half she wooed the nearly
capacity crowd (about 450 people)
with jazz, rhythm and blues, melodic
ballads and witty dialogue. By the
end of her opening night she had her
fans clapping, swaying, tapping their
feet and generally having an uni
nhibited good time â€” no small feat
considering the crowd spanned at
least three generations and comprised
people of various ethnic groups.
No stranger to performing. Cole
first took the stage at the age of five
on tour with her father. Her
familiarity with crowds emerged as
she comfortably took the spotlight
and belted out song after song,
seemingly aware of her talent and not
the least bit uneasy as she teased,
joked and flirted with the audience.
Cole's program consisted of her
two best known hits, "Love on My
Mind" and "This Will Be" as well as
several remakes of old hits like the
Guess Who's "These Eyes," and"I
Am What I Am" from the Broadway
musical "La Cage Aux Folles."
Her versatile alto in full form. Cole
moved easily from the upbeat opener
"Parade" to the classic "Mr.
Melody," a song she coyly dedicated

to "all the guys in the house." As the
tune wound down she slid into an Ella
Fitzgerald style scat, tripping up and
down the scale with resonant grace.
Cole introduced the reflective
"Don't Look Back" by drawing in the
audience with a simple plea: "Let's
use our hindsight . . . and see where
we've been and then look ahead to
where we're going." Yet every way

No stranger to
performing,
Natalie Cole first
took the stage
with her father
at the age of five.

Cole looks she sees success.
Hardship is one side of life Cole
says she hasn't seen very often. Her
only real struggle being, in the early
days, to disassociate herself from the
great, but cumbersome, name she in
herited from her father. She grew up
in the affluent Hancock Park district
of Los Angeles, where her neighbors
included former California Govs. Pat
and Jerry Brown.
She describes her childhood as
relatively normal, filled with private
schools, summer camps and part-time
jobs that were less than glamorous
(switchboard operator, file clerk and
sales girl, among others). The hardest
blow she received as an adolescent
was the death of her father when she
was 15.
Since her debut album

"Inseparable" won her two Grammys
for the smash hit "This Will Be" in
1975, Cole has shown herself to be a
true performer, both doing justice to
her father and carving a definite niche
for herself in the entertainment
world. This has culminated in another
Grammy, six gold and two platinum
albums, the grand prize at the Tokyo
Music Festival and her own star on
Hollywood's Walk of Fame.
Announcing that "I'm gonna make
love to you tonight," Cole looked out
at the crowd and said, "I've still got
love on my mind." Belting out the
first line of "I've Got Love on My
Mind," Cole was met with spontan
eous applause, whistles and cheers
that continued throughout the true
to-the-original version of her'7os hit.
"Love on My Mind" was the ob
vious show stopper of the evening,
followed closely by "This Will Be."
But every song was well received and
not once did her voice or charisma
falter. Her rendition of "These Eyes"
was slow and soulful, using her full
range. The story-song "Annie Mae,"
about a girl who grows up too hard
and too fast, was touchingly beautiful,
ending softly with the question,
"Does anybody know where Annie
Mae is today?" Moments later we felt
the pressure and the pain of the
thoughtful "Catching Hell."
She sang her last number, "I Am
What I Am" with depth and feeling,
succeeding at the difficult task of
singing a classic tune without evoking
a memory of the original version. The
ballad fit Natalie Cole perfectly,
reflecting her self-confidence and her
sense of being at ease with herself.
While Cole need share the spotlight
with no one, she brought her backup

singers. Katrina Perkins and Yasmine
Peoples, forward and stood back as
they displayed their own vocal talents.
She laughed at the few opening
night flaws that marred her otherwise
stunning performance. OK. so the
band did play a bit too loud in the
beginning, and all the cues were not
perfectly smooth and the orchestra
did botch up the false exit she was
supposed to make, leaving her stand
ing on stage looking mildly per
plexed. Cole got through those mo
ments with a smile and a few witty
remarks, admitting that the false exits
were just "an ego thing. You knew
my ego was too big. I had to come
back anyway."
Any flaws were forgotten by the
end of the evening, having been over
shadowed by Cole's first class
delivery of rhythm and blues and
jazzy scats. When she moved into the
closing number, she had won the
crowd over. Alone on center stage,
one hand on her hip, she sung, "If
you don't like it, you can lump it."
Glancing out into the crowd, she
finished loud and strong, "Life's not
worth a good hot damn until you can
say. ... I am what I am." What
Natalie Cole is is a performer of the
highest caliber with an untapped au
dience out there, which hopefully she
will reach on this 1985 tour.
Taking her bows to the late but
timely bow music. Cole exited stage
right to respectful applause. The
lights and music faded, followed by a
full five seconds of awed silence.
Natalie Cole will perform two
shows nightly at the Fairmont Hotel's
Venetian Room at 9:30 and 11:30
p.m.through Sunday.


Moving easily from rhythm and blues, to ballads, to jazz, Natalie Cole
displays the elegance and sheer vocal talent of a true star at home in her
medium.
