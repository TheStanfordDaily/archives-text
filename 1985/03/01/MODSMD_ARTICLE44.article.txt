The Grapes of Wrath (1940)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Like the John Steinbeck novel, John
Ford's famous screen version isn't as
good as its reputation, but it's made with
such integrity and singleness of vision,
and it's so emotionally charged, that you
remember it more vividly than a lot of
better pictures. The biblical-hillbilly
dialogue is impossible, and most of the
acting is arresting in all the wrong ways,
but Henry Fonda is a terrific Tom Joad.
Gregg Toland photographed, the year
before he did "Citizen Kane"; it's easy to
see why he was the hottest young
cameraman in Hollywood. (His death in
1948, at the age of 44, was a real
tragedy.) With Jane Darwell, John Car
radine, Charley Grapewin, Dorris Bow
don, Russell Simpson, Zeffie Tilbury,
O.Z. Whitehead, John Qualen and Eddie
Quillan.
Plays Tuesday and Wednesday with
"El Norte."
Dial 4 M' for Murder (1954)
Terman Auditorium
Frederick Knott's thriller is one of
those devilishly clever but irritatingly
complacent plays (like "Sleuth") that
doesn't come off half as well on screen as
it does in a theater, and Alfred Hitchcock
couldn't do much with it. The wit isn't
really dry — it's arid; and Bob Cum
mings' performance as the duped lover is
hopeless. But audiences usually derive
some pleasure from the plot, and from
the combined personalities of Ray Mil
land (as the cuckolded husband out for
revenge) and John Williams (as the
police detective). Grace Kelly plays the
wife; it's not much of a role.
Plays tomorrow at 7:30 and 9:30.
Suspicion (1941)
Kresge Auditorium
Francis lies' novel "Before the Fact"
concerned a young woman who marries a
murderer, discovers his secret, but loves
him too much to give him up. Alfred
Hitchcock and his writers (Samson Rap
haelson, Joan Harrison and Alma
Reville) had something like this in mind
for the film version, but RKO, appalled
at the thought of casting the leading man.
Cary Grant, as a killer, insisted on a
revised ending. The result is a mess,
though a fascinating one, because for
much of the movie Grant really seems to
be playing the original conception of his
character. (One of the producers at RKO
realized this, too, and tried to solve the
problem by editing, but when the cut
turned out to be only 55 minutes long,
Hitchcock took over and restored the
deleted footage.) Joan Fontaine, playing
the dopey wife, received an Oscar, prob
ably as compensation for the one she
hadn't won the previous year for
"Rebecca"; her acting in "Suspicion,"
ironically, seems to be made up of
recycled bits from "Rebecca." With
Cedric Hardwicke, Nigel Bruce, May
Whitty, Isabel Jeans, Heather Angel and
Leo G. Carroll. Cleverest device: To
focus on the glass of milk Grant brings to
his bride, which may or may not be
poisoned, Hitchcock installed a light
inside the glass.
Plays tonight at 9.
Lost Horizon (1937)
Festival, Palo Alto
James Hilton's enormously popular
Utopian novel was filmed by Frank
Capra, from a screenplay by Robert Ris
kin. The movie's notion of an ideal exis
tence (Shangri-La) is fairly excruciating:
The inhabitants of a Tibetan mountain

community, assured of longevity, dodder
about in smiling lethargy while their
leader, the High Lama (Sam Jaffe),
intones lethal platitudes. But the film has
passages of suspense and fantasy that
cling to the memory for decades; Capra
was nothing if not a master craftsman.
Unhappily, it also has long soporific
stretches, and it isn't very well acted.
Ronald Colman, speaking in that un
earthly cultivated voice, stars as the
questing outsider, Robert Conway, and
the crew stranded alongside him includes
a consumptive (Isabel Jewell), a go
getter (Thomas Mitchell), a fussy paleon
tologist (Edward Everett Horton), and
Conway's malcontent brother (John
Howard). Among the residents of
Shangri-La are H.B. Warner, Margo
(with her faraway eyes) and Jane Wvatt,
smiling her cloying little smiles. (She
didn't change much between this movie
and her "Father Knows Best" days.)
Shot by the amazing Joseph Walker.
Plays through Wednesday with
"Topper Returns."
All of Me (1984)
Memorial Auditorium
A classic comedy: Carl Reiner directs
Steve Martin and Lily Tomlin in Phil Al
den Robinson's script (out of a novel by
Ed Davis called "Me Two") about a
wealthy spinster whose soul, when she
expires, leaps into the body of her
lawyer. In the first 20 minutes, while they
remain separate entities, Martin and
Tomlin each have an opportunity to es
tablish a fully thought-out character, and
while Martin accomplishes this during
the credits, with a few physical strokes,
Tomlin really takes the screen, proving
once again that she is one of the best
actresses in the country, simultaneously
sending up the entire class of cinematic
dowagers and suggesting the authentic
loneliness of a woman who has con
fronted the absolute failure of everything
valuable in her life. As soon as the
heiress, Edwina, becomes part of the
lawyer, Roger, Steve Martin moves into
the center of the movie, conveying the
struggle of the two personalities inside
him. For comparisons to the kind of
delicacy and strategic genius Martin dis
plays when Roger walks down the street
for the first time with Edwina inside him,
you'd have to go all the way back to
Chaplin. Reiner's direction is at best per
functory, at worst miscalculated, and it
doesn't help that Victoria Pennant, as
the woman intended to receive Edwina's
soul, acts mesmerical!v. like Trilby
waiting for Svengali to tell her what to
do. But there are strong contributions
from Richard Libertini and Madolyn
Smith, and Steve Martin and Lily Tomlin
are a match made in heaven.
Plays Sunday at 7 and 9:30.
Macbeth (1948)
Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley
Orson Welles filmed Shakespeare's
tragedy in a matter of weeks on a Gene
Autry set at Republic Pictures. (That ex
plains much of the desperately sweeping
camera movement.) It would be nice to
say that he turned out a gem under these
atrocious conditions, but visually auda
cious as this "Macbeth" is — it's seldom
boring — it cannot fairly be called a good

movie. Welles gives a distracted perfor
mance in the title role; his peculiar deci
sion to outfit everyone with Scottish
accents really blocks him, and it finishes
off Jeanette Nolan's Lady Macbeth. She
is perhaps the worst Lady Macbeth of
our century: Can you imagine Shake
speare's lines reduced to "Ah ha' given
sook an' know what 't is/Tlove the
behhb tha' milks me. . . . "? The sole sur
vivor of this mesmerizing mess is Dan
O'Herlihy, who brings something very
fine and subtle to the role of Macduff.
Plays Wednesday evening.
Henry V (1944)
U.C.Theater, Berkeley
Laurence Olivier's directorial debut
film begins as a play-within-a-movie, a
production of "Henry V" as an audience
at the Globe Theatre might have seen it,
and gradually, magically, it passes from
filmed theater into cinema. Though for
from Shakespeare's best history, "Henry
V" is certainly the most cinematic, and
perhaps none of his other plays has
received such imaginative treatment on
the screen. (It's also his most controver
sial: In the 1960s and early '70s, direc
tors like Terry Hands of the Royal
Shakespeare Company interpreted it as a
scathing attack on the corruption and
cynicism of men in power, while Olivier's
version, commissioned by the British
government as a piece of wartime
propaganda, is rousingly patriotic.)
Olivier, looking surpassingly handsome,
gives a superbly heroic reading of the
role of the young king. The cast also in
cludes Robert Newton, Leslie Banks,
Renee Asherson, Esmond Knight, Leo
Genn, Felix Aylmer and Ernest
Thesiger. William Walton wrote the
justly famous music.
Plays Sunday with "Falstaff."
Falstaff (Chimes at Midnight) (1967)
U.C.Theater, Berkeley
Orson Welles had his usual problems
financing this film version of the two
parts of Shakespeare's "Henry IV" (with
interpolations from "Richard II" and
"Henry V"), and they show up, as in his
"Othello," in the dreadful aural quality
of much of the picture. And still it's a
near-masterpiece. Welles gives arguably
his best performance as Falstaff. and the
supporting cast is formidable — John
Gielgud as Henry, Keith Baxter as Hal,
Margaret Rutherford as Mistress
Ouickly, Jeanne Moreau as Doll Tear
sheet and Alan Webb as a touching,
wizened clown Shallow. Ralph Richard
son reads the narration (from
Holinshed's "Chronicles"). The Battle of
Shrewsbury sequence is the film's high
light — perhaps the highlight of an entire
decade of American filmmaking.
Plays Sunday with "Henry V."
Force of Evil (1948)
Cedar, San Francisco
The director, Abraham Polonsky (who
was blacklisted shortly after this first
film), strives for a '30s agit-prop atmo
sphere, but everything in the movie looks
strained, and the star, John Garfield, is
miscast — both as a lawyer and as a vice
figure. The character he plays, Joe

Morse, is the "force of evil" of the title,
corrupting every decent character he can
sink his claws into. Polonsky's over
heated style — the actors hit the peak of
their anger a second or two into every
scene — and the impossible, sloganeer
ing script he and Ira Wolfert provided
(which runs to lines like "II I ever
thought of loving you. it was to love
something rotten and corrupt in myself")
leave Garfield stranded. He tries to rely
on his youthful energy, hut he doesn't
Ux)k especially youthful bv I^4B,and his
speeches, reeled off with his customary
speed, sound distressingly like cant. The
cast includes Beatrice Pearson. Thomas
Gomez. Marie Windsor. Howland
Chamberlin and Rov Roberts.
Plays Sunday and Monday with
"Nightmare."
Romancing (he Stone (1984)
New Varsity . Palo Alto
A very entertaining adventure spoof
about a successful writer of romantic
novels who finds herself swept up in a
more elaborate, more implausible plot
than any of her own devising. Diane
Thomas wrote some terrific dialogue;
Robert Zemeckis, the director, employs
his camera as a jokester narrator, setting
up and unfolding the story and punctuat
ing it with visual punch lines. The picture
is a beauty: Dean Cundey, the photog
rapher. has shot the jungle scenes (filmed
on location in Mexico) with a nearly hy
perbolic vividness and clarity, and
Zemeckis gives the adventure sequences
the deluxe treatment. With the gifted
comedienne Kathleen Turner. Michael
Douglas (who tries but doesn't quite fill
the Harrison Ford-style hero role), and
Danny DeVito as a hilariously foreshor
tened comic villain.
Plays Thursday with "Protocol."
The Cotton Club (1984)
New Varsity . Palo Alto
The Cotton Club occupied a unique lo
cation at the crossroads of white society
and black culture (which met on the
whim of white savants), of gangland and
the New York aristocracy (which met as
a result of Prohibition). It's a great sub
ject for the movies: One imagines a
sumptuous, provocative, deliriously en
tertaining musical drama, filled with
fabulous numbers and scintillating per
sonalities and amazing incidents. But
Francis Ford Coppola, who directed
"The Cotton Club." had a different idea:
to star himself, star his technical razzle
dazzle and his spendthrift virtuosity —
nearly $50 million worth. The movie isn't
about the Cotton Club, any more than
"Apocalypse Now" was about Vietnam
or "The Outsiders" and "Rumble Fish"
were about teenagers. Written by Pulit
zer Prize-winner William Kennedy; with
Richard Gere and Diane Lane (as char
acters whose oddball love story obviously
doesn't belong in the movie); James
Remar as "Dutch" Schultz; Nicolas
Cage; Gregory and Maurice Mines and
Lonette McKee, whose joyous numbers
are almost always spoiled by Coppola's
disinterest in them; and Fred Gwynne,
Bob Hoskins and Julian Beck, who come
off well despite everything.
Plays tomorrow through Monday with
"Cotton Club Fra."

are a match made in heaven.
Plays Sunday at 7 and 9:30.
Macbeth (1948)
Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley
Orson Welles filmed Shakespeare's
tragedy in a matter of weeks on a Gene
Autry set at Republic Pictures. (That ex
plains much of the desperately sweeping
camera movement.) It would be nice to
say that he turned out a gem under these
atrocious conditions, but visually auda
cious as this "Macbeth" is — it's seldom
boring — it cannot fairly be called a good

movie. Welles gives a distracted perfor
mance in the title role; his peculiar deci
sion to outfit everyone with Scottish
accents really blocks him, and it finishes
off Jeanette Nolan's Lady Macbeth. She
is perhaps the worst Lady Macbeth of
our century: Can you imagine Shake
speare's lines reduced to "Ah ha' given
sook an' know what 't is/Tlove the
behhb tha' milks me. . . . "? The sole sur
vivor of this mesmerizing mess is Dan
O'Herlihy, who brings something very
fine and subtle to the role of Macduff.
Plays Wednesday evening.
Henry V (1944)
U.C.Theater, Berkeley
Laurence Olivier's directorial debut
film begins as a play-within-a-movie, a
production of "Henry V" as an audience
at the Globe Theatre might have seen it,
and gradually, magically, it passes from
filmed theater into cinema. Though for
from Shakespeare's best history, "Henry
V" is certainly the most cinematic, and
perhaps none of his other plays has
received such imaginative treatment on
the screen. (It's also his most controver
sial: In the 1960s and early '70s, direc
tors like Terry Hands of the Royal
Shakespeare Company interpreted it as a
scathing attack on the corruption and
cynicism of men in power, while Olivier's
version, commissioned by the British
government as a piece of wartime
propaganda, is rousingly patriotic.)
Olivier, looking surpassingly handsome,
gives a superbly heroic reading of the
role of the young king. The cast also in
cludes Robert Newton, Leslie Banks,
Renee Asherson, Esmond Knight, Leo
Genn, Felix Aylmer and Ernest
Thesiger. William Walton wrote the
justly famous music.
Plays Sunday with "Falstaff."
Falstaff (Chimes at Midnight) (1967)
U.C.Theater, Berkeley
Orson Welles had his usual problems
financing this film version of the two
parts of Shakespeare's "Henry IV" (with
interpolations from "Richard II" and
"Henry V"), and they show up, as in his
"Othello," in the dreadful aural quality
of much of the picture. And still it's a
near-masterpiece. Welles gives arguably
his best performance as Falstaff. and the
supporting cast is formidable — John
Gielgud as Henry, Keith Baxter as Hal,
Margaret Rutherford as Mistress
Ouickly, Jeanne Moreau as Doll Tear
sheet and Alan Webb as a touching,
wizened clown Shallow. Ralph Richard
son reads the narration (from
Holinshed's "Chronicles"). The Battle of
Shrewsbury sequence is the film's high
light — perhaps the highlight of an entire
decade of American filmmaking.
Plays Sunday with "Henry V."
Force of Evil (1948)
Cedar, San Francisco
The director, Abraham Polonsky (who
was blacklisted shortly after this first
film), strives for a '30s agit-prop atmo
sphere, but everything in the movie looks
strained, and the star, John Garfield, is
miscast — both as a lawyer and as a vice
figure. The character he plays, Joe

Morse, is the "force of evil" of the title,
corrupting every decent character he can
sink his claws into. Polonsky's over
heated style — the actors hit the peak of
their anger a second or two into every
scene — and the impossible, sloganeer
ing script he and Ira Wolfert provided
(which runs to lines like "II I ever
thought of loving you. it was to love
something rotten and corrupt in myself")
leave Garfield stranded. He tries to rely
on his youthful energy, hut he doesn't
Ux)k especially youthful bv I^4B,and his
speeches, reeled off with his customary
speed, sound distressingly like cant. The
cast includes Beatrice Pearson. Thomas
Gomez. Marie Windsor. Howland
Chamberlin and Rov Roberts.
Plays Sunday and Monday with
"Nightmare."
Romancing (he Stone (1984)
New Varsity . Palo Alto
A very entertaining adventure spoof
about a successful writer of romantic
novels who finds herself swept up in a
more elaborate, more implausible plot
than any of her own devising. Diane
Thomas wrote some terrific dialogue;
Robert Zemeckis, the director, employs
his camera as a jokester narrator, setting
up and unfolding the story and punctuat
ing it with visual punch lines. The picture
is a beauty: Dean Cundey, the photog
rapher. has shot the jungle scenes (filmed
on location in Mexico) with a nearly hy
perbolic vividness and clarity, and
Zemeckis gives the adventure sequences
the deluxe treatment. With the gifted
comedienne Kathleen Turner. Michael
Douglas (who tries but doesn't quite fill
the Harrison Ford-style hero role), and
Danny DeVito as a hilariously foreshor
tened comic villain.
Plays Thursday with "Protocol."
The Cotton Club (1984)
New Varsity . Palo Alto
The Cotton Club occupied a unique lo
cation at the crossroads of white society
and black culture (which met on the
whim of white savants), of gangland and
the New York aristocracy (which met as
a result of Prohibition). It's a great sub
ject for the movies: One imagines a
sumptuous, provocative, deliriously en
tertaining musical drama, filled with
fabulous numbers and scintillating per
sonalities and amazing incidents. But
Francis Ford Coppola, who directed
"The Cotton Club." had a different idea:
to star himself, star his technical razzle
dazzle and his spendthrift virtuosity —
nearly $50 million worth. The movie isn't
about the Cotton Club, any more than
"Apocalypse Now" was about Vietnam
or "The Outsiders" and "Rumble Fish"
were about teenagers. Written by Pulit
zer Prize-winner William Kennedy; with
Richard Gere and Diane Lane (as char
acters whose oddball love story obviously
doesn't belong in the movie); James
Remar as "Dutch" Schultz; Nicolas
Cage; Gregory and Maurice Mines and
Lonette McKee, whose joyous numbers
are almost always spoiled by Coppola's
disinterest in them; and Fred Gwynne,
Bob Hoskins and Julian Beck, who come
off well despite everything.
Plays tomorrow through Monday with
"Cotton Club Fra."

The Grapes of Wrath (1940)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Like the John Steinbeck novel, John
Ford's famous screen version isn't as
good as its reputation, but it's made with
such integrity and singleness of vision,
and it's so emotionally charged, that you
remember it more vividly than a lot of
better pictures. The biblical-hillbilly
dialogue is impossible, and most of the
acting is arresting in all the wrong ways,
but Henry Fonda is a terrific Tom Joad.
Gregg Toland photographed, the year
before he did "Citizen Kane"; it's easy to
see why he was the hottest young
cameraman in Hollywood. (His death in
1948, at the age of 44, was a real
tragedy.) With Jane Darwell, John Car
radine, Charley Grapewin, Dorris Bow
don, Russell Simpson, Zeffie Tilbury,
O.Z. Whitehead, John Qualen and Eddie
Quillan.
Plays Tuesday and Wednesday with
"El Norte."
Dial 4 M' for Murder (1954)
Terman Auditorium
Frederick Knott's thriller is one of
those devilishly clever but irritatingly
complacent plays (like "Sleuth") that
doesn't come off half as well on screen as
it does in a theater, and Alfred Hitchcock
couldn't do much with it. The wit isn't
really dry — it's arid; and Bob Cum
mings' performance as the duped lover is
hopeless. But audiences usually derive
some pleasure from the plot, and from
the combined personalities of Ray Mil
land (as the cuckolded husband out for
revenge) and John Williams (as the
police detective). Grace Kelly plays the
wife; it's not much of a role.
Plays tomorrow at 7:30 and 9:30.
Suspicion (1941)
Kresge Auditorium
Francis lies' novel "Before the Fact"
concerned a young woman who marries a
murderer, discovers his secret, but loves
him too much to give him up. Alfred
Hitchcock and his writers (Samson Rap
haelson, Joan Harrison and Alma
Reville) had something like this in mind
for the film version, but RKO, appalled
at the thought of casting the leading man.
Cary Grant, as a killer, insisted on a
revised ending. The result is a mess,
though a fascinating one, because for
much of the movie Grant really seems to
be playing the original conception of his
character. (One of the producers at RKO
realized this, too, and tried to solve the
problem by editing, but when the cut
turned out to be only 55 minutes long,
Hitchcock took over and restored the
deleted footage.) Joan Fontaine, playing
the dopey wife, received an Oscar, prob
ably as compensation for the one she
hadn't won the previous year for
"Rebecca"; her acting in "Suspicion,"
ironically, seems to be made up of
recycled bits from "Rebecca." With
Cedric Hardwicke, Nigel Bruce, May
Whitty, Isabel Jeans, Heather Angel and
Leo G. Carroll. Cleverest device: To
focus on the glass of milk Grant brings to
his bride, which may or may not be
poisoned, Hitchcock installed a light
inside the glass.
Plays tonight at 9.
Lost Horizon (1937)
Festival, Palo Alto
James Hilton's enormously popular
Utopian novel was filmed by Frank
Capra, from a screenplay by Robert Ris
kin. The movie's notion of an ideal exis
tence (Shangri-La) is fairly excruciating:
The inhabitants of a Tibetan mountain

community, assured of longevity, dodder
about in smiling lethargy while their
leader, the High Lama (Sam Jaffe),
intones lethal platitudes. But the film has
passages of suspense and fantasy that
cling to the memory for decades; Capra
was nothing if not a master craftsman.
Unhappily, it also has long soporific
stretches, and it isn't very well acted.
Ronald Colman, speaking in that un
earthly cultivated voice, stars as the
questing outsider, Robert Conway, and
the crew stranded alongside him includes
a consumptive (Isabel Jewell), a go
getter (Thomas Mitchell), a fussy paleon
tologist (Edward Everett Horton), and
Conway's malcontent brother (John
Howard). Among the residents of
Shangri-La are H.B. Warner, Margo
(with her faraway eyes) and Jane Wvatt,
smiling her cloying little smiles. (She
didn't change much between this movie
and her "Father Knows Best" days.)
Shot by the amazing Joseph Walker.
Plays through Wednesday with
"Topper Returns."
All of Me (1984)
Memorial Auditorium
A classic comedy: Carl Reiner directs
Steve Martin and Lily Tomlin in Phil Al
den Robinson's script (out of a novel by
Ed Davis called "Me Two") about a
wealthy spinster whose soul, when she
expires, leaps into the body of her
lawyer. In the first 20 minutes, while they
remain separate entities, Martin and
Tomlin each have an opportunity to es
tablish a fully thought-out character, and
while Martin accomplishes this during
the credits, with a few physical strokes,
Tomlin really takes the screen, proving
once again that she is one of the best
actresses in the country, simultaneously
sending up the entire class of cinematic
dowagers and suggesting the authentic
loneliness of a woman who has con
fronted the absolute failure of everything
valuable in her life. As soon as the
heiress, Edwina, becomes part of the
lawyer, Roger, Steve Martin moves into
the center of the movie, conveying the
struggle of the two personalities inside
him. For comparisons to the kind of
delicacy and strategic genius Martin dis
plays when Roger walks down the street
for the first time with Edwina inside him,
you'd have to go all the way back to
Chaplin. Reiner's direction is at best per
functory, at worst miscalculated, and it
doesn't help that Victoria Pennant, as
the woman intended to receive Edwina's
soul, acts mesmerical!v. like Trilby
waiting for Svengali to tell her what to
do. But there are strong contributions
from Richard Libertini and Madolyn
Smith, and Steve Martin and Lily Tomlin
are a match made in heaven.

sonalities and amazing incidents. But
Francis Ford Coppola, who directed
"The Cotton Club." had a different idea:
to star himself, star his technical razzle
dazzle and his spendthrift virtuosity —
nearly $50 million worth. The movie isn't
about the Cotton Club, any more than
"Apocalypse Now" was about Vietnam
or "The Outsiders" and "Rumble Fish"
were about teenagers. Written by Pulit
zer Prize-winner William Kennedy; with
Richard Gere and Diane Lane (as char
acters whose oddball love story obviously
doesn't belong in the movie); James
Remar as "Dutch" Schultz; Nicolas
Cage; Gregory and Maurice Mines and
Lonette McKee, whose joyous numbers
are almost always spoiled by Coppola's
disinterest in them; and Fred Gwynne,
Bob Hoskins and Julian Beck, who come
off well despite everything.
Plays tomorrow through Monday with
"Cotton Club Fra."

The Grapes of Wrath (1940)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Like the John Steinbeck novel, John
Ford's famous screen version isn't as
good as its reputation, but it's made with
such integrity and singleness of vision,
and it's so emotionally charged, that you
remember it more vividly than a lot of
better pictures. The biblical-hillbilly
dialogue is impossible, and most of the
acting is arresting in all the wrong ways,
but Henry Fonda is a terrific Tom Joad.
Gregg Toland photographed, the year
before he did "Citizen Kane"; it's easy to
see why he was the hottest young
cameraman in Hollywood. (His death in
1948, at the age of 44, was a real
tragedy.) With Jane Darwell, John Car
radine, Charley Grapewin, Dorris Bow
don, Russell Simpson, Zeffie Tilbury,
O.Z. Whitehead, John Qualen and Eddie
Quillan.
Plays Tuesday and Wednesday with
"El Norte."
Dial 4 M' for Murder (1954)
Terman Auditorium
Frederick Knott's thriller is one of
those devilishly clever but irritatingly
complacent plays (like "Sleuth") that
doesn't come off half as well on screen as
it does in a theater, and Alfred Hitchcock
couldn't do much with it. The wit isn't
really dry — it's arid; and Bob Cum
mings' performance as the duped lover is
hopeless. But audiences usually derive
some pleasure from the plot, and from
the combined personalities of Ray Mil
land (as the cuckolded husband out for
revenge) and John Williams (as the
police detective). Grace Kelly plays the
wife; it's not much of a role.
Plays tomorrow at 7:30 and 9:30.
Suspicion (1941)
Kresge Auditorium
Francis lies' novel "Before the Fact"
concerned a young woman who marries a
murderer, discovers his secret, but loves
him too much to give him up. Alfred
Hitchcock and his writers (Samson Rap
haelson, Joan Harrison and Alma
Reville) had something like this in mind
for the film version, but RKO, appalled
at the thought of casting the leading man.
Cary Grant, as a killer, insisted on a
revised ending. The result is a mess,
though a fascinating one, because for
much of the movie Grant really seems to
be playing the original conception of his
character. (One of the producers at RKO
realized this, too, and tried to solve the
problem by editing, but when the cut
turned out to be only 55 minutes long,
Hitchcock took over and restored the
deleted footage.) Joan Fontaine, playing
the dopey wife, received an Oscar, prob
ably as compensation for the one she
hadn't won the previous year for
"Rebecca"; her acting in "Suspicion,"
ironically, seems to be made up of
recycled bits from "Rebecca." With
Cedric Hardwicke, Nigel Bruce, May
Whitty, Isabel Jeans, Heather Angel and
Leo G. Carroll. Cleverest device: To
focus on the glass of milk Grant brings to
his bride, which may or may not be
poisoned, Hitchcock installed a light
inside the glass.
Plays tonight at 9.
Lost Horizon (1937)
Festival, Palo Alto
James Hilton's enormously popular
Utopian novel was filmed by Frank
Capra, from a screenplay by Robert Ris
kin. The movie's notion of an ideal exis
tence (Shangri-La) is fairly excruciating:
The inhabitants of a Tibetan mountain

community, assured of longevity, dodder
about in smiling lethargy while their
leader, the High Lama (Sam Jaffe),
intones lethal platitudes. But the film has
passages of suspense and fantasy that
cling to the memory for decades; Capra
was nothing if not a master craftsman.
Unhappily, it also has long soporific
stretches, and it isn't very well acted.
Ronald Colman, speaking in that un
earthly cultivated voice, stars as the
questing outsider, Robert Conway, and
the crew stranded alongside him includes
a consumptive (Isabel Jewell), a go
getter (Thomas Mitchell), a fussy paleon
tologist (Edward Everett Horton), and
Conway's malcontent brother (John
Howard). Among the residents of
Shangri-La are H.B. Warner, Margo
(with her faraway eyes) and Jane Wvatt,
smiling her cloying little smiles. (She
didn't change much between this movie
and her "Father Knows Best" days.)
Shot by the amazing Joseph Walker.
Plays through Wednesday with
"Topper Returns."
All of Me (1984)
Memorial Auditorium
A classic comedy: Carl Reiner directs
Steve Martin and Lily Tomlin in Phil Al
den Robinson's script (out of a novel by
Ed Davis called "Me Two") about a
wealthy spinster whose soul, when she
expires, leaps into the body of her
lawyer. In the first 20 minutes, while they
remain separate entities, Martin and
Tomlin each have an opportunity to es
tablish a fully thought-out character, and
while Martin accomplishes this during
the credits, with a few physical strokes,
Tomlin really takes the screen, proving
once again that she is one of the best
actresses in the country, simultaneously
sending up the entire class of cinematic
dowagers and suggesting the authentic
loneliness of a woman who has con
fronted the absolute failure of everything
valuable in her life. As soon as the
heiress, Edwina, becomes part of the
lawyer, Roger, Steve Martin moves into
the center of the movie, conveying the
struggle of the two personalities inside
him. For comparisons to the kind of
delicacy and strategic genius Martin dis
plays when Roger walks down the street
for the first time with Edwina inside him,
you'd have to go all the way back to
Chaplin. Reiner's direction is at best per
functory, at worst miscalculated, and it
doesn't help that Victoria Pennant, as
the woman intended to receive Edwina's
soul, acts mesmerical!v. like Trilby
waiting for Svengali to tell her what to
do. But there are strong contributions
from Richard Libertini and Madolyn
Smith, and Steve Martin and Lily Tomlin
are a match made in heaven.
Plays Sunday at 7 and 9:30.
Macbeth (1948)
Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley
Orson Welles filmed Shakespeare's
tragedy in a matter of weeks on a Gene
Autry set at Republic Pictures. (That ex
plains much of the desperately sweeping
camera movement.) It would be nice to
say that he turned out a gem under these
atrocious conditions, but visually auda
cious as this "Macbeth" is — it's seldom
boring — it cannot fairly be called a good

movie. Welles gives a distracted perfor
mance in the title role; his peculiar deci
sion to outfit everyone with Scottish
accents really blocks him, and it finishes
off Jeanette Nolan's Lady Macbeth. She
is perhaps the worst Lady Macbeth of
our century: Can you imagine Shake
speare's lines reduced to "Ah ha' given
sook an' know what 't is/Tlove the
behhb tha' milks me. . . . "? The sole sur
vivor of this mesmerizing mess is Dan
O'Herlihy, who brings something very
fine and subtle to the role of Macduff.
Plays Wednesday evening.
Henry V (1944)
U.C.Theater, Berkeley
Laurence Olivier's directorial debut
film begins as a play-within-a-movie, a
production of "Henry V" as an audience
at the Globe Theatre might have seen it,
and gradually, magically, it passes from
filmed theater into cinema. Though for
from Shakespeare's best history, "Henry
V" is certainly the most cinematic, and
perhaps none of his other plays has
received such imaginative treatment on
the screen. (It's also his most controver
sial: In the 1960s and early '70s, direc
tors like Terry Hands of the Royal
Shakespeare Company interpreted it as a
scathing attack on the corruption and
cynicism of men in power, while Olivier's
version, commissioned by the British
government as a piece of wartime
propaganda, is rousingly patriotic.)
Olivier, looking surpassingly handsome,
gives a superbly heroic reading of the
role of the young king. The cast also in
cludes Robert Newton, Leslie Banks,
Renee Asherson, Esmond Knight, Leo
Genn, Felix Aylmer and Ernest
Thesiger. William Walton wrote the
justly famous music.
Plays Sunday with "Falstaff."
Falstaff (Chimes at Midnight) (1967)
U.C.Theater, Berkeley
Orson Welles had his usual problems
financing this film version of the two
parts of Shakespeare's "Henry IV" (with
interpolations from "Richard II" and
"Henry V"), and they show up, as in his
"Othello," in the dreadful aural quality
of much of the picture. And still it's a
near-masterpiece. Welles gives arguably
his best performance as Falstaff. and the
supporting cast is formidable — John
Gielgud as Henry, Keith Baxter as Hal,
Margaret Rutherford as Mistress
Ouickly, Jeanne Moreau as Doll Tear
sheet and Alan Webb as a touching,
wizened clown Shallow. Ralph Richard
son reads the narration (from
Holinshed's "Chronicles"). The Battle of
Shrewsbury sequence is the film's high
light — perhaps the highlight of an entire
decade of American filmmaking.
Plays Sunday with "Henry V."
Force of Evil (1948)
Cedar, San Francisco
The director, Abraham Polonsky (who
was blacklisted shortly after this first
film), strives for a '30s agit-prop atmo
sphere, but everything in the movie looks
strained, and the star, John Garfield, is
miscast — both as a lawyer and as a vice
figure. The character he plays, Joe

Morse, is the "force of evil" of the title,
corrupting every decent character he can
sink his claws into. Polonsky's over
heated style — the actors hit the peak of
their anger a second or two into every
scene — and the impossible, sloganeer
ing script he and Ira Wolfert provided
(which runs to lines like "II I ever
thought of loving you. it was to love
something rotten and corrupt in myself")
leave Garfield stranded. He tries to rely
on his youthful energy, hut he doesn't
Ux)k especially youthful bv I^4B,and his
speeches, reeled off with his customary
speed, sound distressingly like cant. The
cast includes Beatrice Pearson. Thomas
Gomez. Marie Windsor. Howland
Chamberlin and Rov Roberts.
Plays Sunday and Monday with
"Nightmare."
Romancing (he Stone (1984)
New Varsity . Palo Alto
A very entertaining adventure spoof
about a successful writer of romantic
novels who finds herself swept up in a
more elaborate, more implausible plot
than any of her own devising. Diane
Thomas wrote some terrific dialogue;
Robert Zemeckis, the director, employs
his camera as a jokester narrator, setting
up and unfolding the story and punctuat
ing it with visual punch lines. The picture
is a beauty: Dean Cundey, the photog
rapher. has shot the jungle scenes (filmed
on location in Mexico) with a nearly hy
perbolic vividness and clarity, and
Zemeckis gives the adventure sequences
the deluxe treatment. With the gifted
comedienne Kathleen Turner. Michael
Douglas (who tries but doesn't quite fill
the Harrison Ford-style hero role), and
Danny DeVito as a hilariously foreshor
tened comic villain.
Plays Thursday with "Protocol."
The Cotton Club (1984)
New Varsity . Palo Alto
The Cotton Club occupied a unique lo
cation at the crossroads of white society
and black culture (which met on the
whim of white savants), of gangland and
the New York aristocracy (which met as
a result of Prohibition). It's a great sub
ject for the movies: One imagines a
sumptuous, provocative, deliriously en
tertaining musical drama, filled with
fabulous numbers and scintillating per
sonalities and amazing incidents. But
Francis Ford Coppola, who directed
"The Cotton Club." had a different idea:
to star himself, star his technical razzle
dazzle and his spendthrift virtuosity —
nearly $50 million worth. The movie isn't

Tomlin really takes the screen, proving
once again that she is one of the best
actresses in the country, simultaneously
sending up the entire class of cinematic
dowagers and suggesting the authentic
loneliness of a woman who has con
fronted the absolute failure of everything
valuable in her life. As soon as the
heiress, Edwina, becomes part of the
lawyer, Roger, Steve Martin moves into
the center of the movie, conveying the
struggle of the two personalities inside
him. For comparisons to the kind of
delicacy and strategic genius Martin dis
plays when Roger walks down the street
for the first time with Edwina inside him,
you'd have to go all the way back to
Chaplin. Reiner's direction is at best per
functory, at worst miscalculated, and it
doesn't help that Victoria Pennant, as
the woman intended to receive Edwina's
soul, acts mesmerical!v. like Trilby
waiting for Svengali to tell her what to
do. But there are strong contributions
from Richard Libertini and Madolyn
Smith, and Steve Martin and Lily Tomlin
are a match made in heaven.
Plays Sunday at 7 and 9:30.
Macbeth (1948)
Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley
Orson Welles filmed Shakespeare's
tragedy in a matter of weeks on a Gene
Autry set at Republic Pictures. (That ex
plains much of the desperately sweeping
camera movement.) It would be nice to
say that he turned out a gem under these
atrocious conditions, but visually auda
cious as this "Macbeth" is — it's seldom
boring — it cannot fairly be called a good

movie. Welles gives a distracted perfor
mance in the title role; his peculiar deci
sion to outfit everyone with Scottish
accents really blocks him, and it finishes
off Jeanette Nolan's Lady Macbeth. She
is perhaps the worst Lady Macbeth of
our century: Can you imagine Shake
speare's lines reduced to "Ah ha' given
sook an' know what 't is/Tlove the
behhb tha' milks me. . . . "? The sole sur
vivor of this mesmerizing mess is Dan
O'Herlihy, who brings something very
fine and subtle to the role of Macduff.
Plays Wednesday evening.
Henry V (1944)
U.C.Theater, Berkeley
Laurence Olivier's directorial debut
film begins as a play-within-a-movie, a
production of "Henry V" as an audience
at the Globe Theatre might have seen it,
and gradually, magically, it passes from
filmed theater into cinema. Though for
from Shakespeare's best history, "Henry
V" is certainly the most cinematic, and
perhaps none of his other plays has
received such imaginative treatment on
the screen. (It's also his most controver
sial: In the 1960s and early '70s, direc
tors like Terry Hands of the Royal
Shakespeare Company interpreted it as a
scathing attack on the corruption and
cynicism of men in power, while Olivier's
version, commissioned by the British
government as a piece of wartime
propaganda, is rousingly patriotic.)
Olivier, looking surpassingly handsome,
gives a superbly heroic reading of the
role of the young king. The cast also in
cludes Robert Newton, Leslie Banks,
Renee Asherson, Esmond Knight, Leo
Genn, Felix Aylmer and Ernest
Thesiger. William Walton wrote the
justly famous music.
Plays Sunday with "Falstaff."
Falstaff (Chimes at Midnight) (1967)
U.C.Theater, Berkeley
Orson Welles had his usual problems
financing this film version of the two
parts of Shakespeare's "Henry IV" (with
interpolations from "Richard II" and
"Henry V"), and they show up, as in his
"Othello," in the dreadful aural quality
of much of the picture. And still it's a
near-masterpiece. Welles gives arguably
his best performance as Falstaff. and the
supporting cast is formidable — John
Gielgud as Henry, Keith Baxter as Hal,
Margaret Rutherford as Mistress
Ouickly, Jeanne Moreau as Doll Tear
sheet and Alan Webb as a touching,
wizened clown Shallow. Ralph Richard
son reads the narration (from
Holinshed's "Chronicles"). The Battle of
Shrewsbury sequence is the film's high
light — perhaps the highlight of an entire
decade of American filmmaking.
Plays Sunday with "Henry V."
Force of Evil (1948)
Cedar, San Francisco
The director, Abraham Polonsky (who
was blacklisted shortly after this first
film), strives for a '30s agit-prop atmo
sphere, but everything in the movie looks
strained, and the star, John Garfield, is
miscast — both as a lawyer and as a vice
figure. The character he plays, Joe

Morse, is the "force of evil" of the title,
corrupting every decent character he can
sink his claws into. Polonsky's over
heated style — the actors hit the peak of
their anger a second or two into every
scene — and the impossible, sloganeer
ing script he and Ira Wolfert provided
(which runs to lines like "II I ever
thought of loving you. it was to love
something rotten and corrupt in myself")
leave Garfield stranded. He tries to rely
on his youthful energy, hut he doesn't
Ux)k especially youthful bv I^4B,and his
speeches, reeled off with his customary
speed, sound distressingly like cant. The
cast includes Beatrice Pearson. Thomas
Gomez. Marie Windsor. Howland
Chamberlin and Rov Roberts.
Plays Sunday and Monday with
"Nightmare."
Romancing (he Stone (1984)
New Varsity . Palo Alto
A very entertaining adventure spoof
about a successful writer of romantic
novels who finds herself swept up in a
more elaborate, more implausible plot
than any of her own devising. Diane
Thomas wrote some terrific dialogue;
Robert Zemeckis, the director, employs
his camera as a jokester narrator, setting
up and unfolding the story and punctuat
ing it with visual punch lines. The picture
is a beauty: Dean Cundey, the photog
rapher. has shot the jungle scenes (filmed
on location in Mexico) with a nearly hy
perbolic vividness and clarity, and
Zemeckis gives the adventure sequences
the deluxe treatment. With the gifted
comedienne Kathleen Turner. Michael
Douglas (who tries but doesn't quite fill
the Harrison Ford-style hero role), and
Danny DeVito as a hilariously foreshor
tened comic villain.
Plays Thursday with "Protocol."
The Cotton Club (1984)
New Varsity . Palo Alto
The Cotton Club occupied a unique lo
cation at the crossroads of white society
and black culture (which met on the
whim of white savants), of gangland and
the New York aristocracy (which met as
a result of Prohibition). It's a great sub
ject for the movies: One imagines a
sumptuous, provocative, deliriously en
tertaining musical drama, filled with
fabulous numbers and scintillating per
sonalities and amazing incidents. But
Francis Ford Coppola, who directed
"The Cotton Club." had a different idea:
to star himself, star his technical razzle
dazzle and his spendthrift virtuosity —
nearly $50 million worth. The movie isn't
about the Cotton Club, any more than
"Apocalypse Now" was about Vietnam
or "The Outsiders" and "Rumble Fish"
were about teenagers. Written by Pulit
zer Prize-winner William Kennedy; with
Richard Gere and Diane Lane (as char
acters whose oddball love story obviously
doesn't belong in the movie); James
Remar as "Dutch" Schultz; Nicolas
Cage; Gregory and Maurice Mines and
Lonette McKee, whose joyous numbers
are almost always spoiled by Coppola's
disinterest in them; and Fred Gwynne,
Bob Hoskins and Julian Beck, who come
off well despite everything.
Plays tomorrow through Monday with
"Cotton Club Fra."
