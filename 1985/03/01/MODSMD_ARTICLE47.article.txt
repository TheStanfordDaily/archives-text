Another in a long line of
often-aborted attempts at Daily
volleyball happens today at

wed primate expert Jane
Goodall, has signed a multi-

an autobiographical teleplay for
a future Mutual of Omaha "Wild
Kingdom" program.

And, of course, all the
monkeys in the world, typing on
all the typewriters in the world,
would certainly produce a
message wishing K.C. a speedy
return to these pages.
