# Committee fixes stance on ethics
## 
### TODD RAMMING Staff writer 
The Stanford Medical Center's
Committee on Medical Ethics is
scheduled to release later this month
a two-page statement aimed at clari
fying official hospital policy on "do
not resuscitate" (DNR) orders, ac
cording to Pamela Perkins, a member
of the committee staff.
DNR orders are directives by
physicians "that heroic or extraordi
nary means should not be employed
on behalf of the patient," according
to an official hospital policy state
ment. "Resuscitation does not mean
or refer to ordinary or routine meth
ods used to maintain life," the state
ment said.
"We must be sure that DNR orders
are consistently executed," said
Jeanne Kennedy, director of commu
nity and patient relations at the medi
cal center and a member of the ethics
committee.
In normal circumstances, a
physician "must have the informed
consent of the patient" to issue a
DNR order, according to Dr. Tom
Raffin. a member of the ethics com
mittee and assistant professor of res
piratory medicine. When a patient
becomes incompetent to judge,
however, physicians must obtain a
"substituted judgment," a best es

timation of what the patient would
want based upon any instructions left
by the patient to relatives or in
writing. Raffin said.
Questions still remain between ex
traordinary and standard life support.
"1 don't think it's reasonable to dis
criminate between extraordinary and
just life support.'" Raffin said. In a
recent case, for example, the New Jer
sey Supreme Court upheld a decision
not to give "prolonged nasal feeding"
to a patient in an irreversible coma,
Raffin said.
Official hospital policy does in
clude such a process, termed
"intubation," among its list of ex
traordinary means to maintain life.
The ethics committee was estab
lished in September 19K3 by Dr.
Lawrence Crowley, professor of sur
gery and president of Stanford Hospi
tal, and is chaired by Dr. Thomas
Gonda, professor of psychiatry and
humanities special programs. Mem
bers include physicians, nurses, medi
cal students, chaplains, economists,
lawyers, social workers, sociologists
and philosophers.
The ethics committee is charged to
"suggest policies and practices aimed
to ensure sound decisionmaking with
respect to ethically difficult situa-
tions,' Kennedy said. "We are not a com
mittee that deals with issues on the spot,"
she said. "Individual cases are
retrospectively rather than prospectively
discussed."
The committee's first efforts were aimed
at analyzing a touchy ethical incident pre
sented by committee member Dr. John
Ruark, chief resident in psychiatry.
A leukemia patient who was "not inclined
to initiate conversation about what he
wanted to have happen" in the event of an
emergency suddenly developed severe com
plications, Ruark said. The patient had ex
pressed his wishes to the nursing staff but
not to the attending physician. The
physician had not asked the patient his
wishes, and the complications made further
communication with the patient impossible,
Ruark said.
"Problems that have a probability of
arising need to be dealt with before they
become acute," Ruark said. But, "The
desire to maintain an optimistic attitude can
sometimes color a physician's view," he
said.
"There's evidence to support that com
plete disclosure (of all possibilities) versus
no disclosure has no effect at all on sur
vival," Ruark said. Statistics show that
patients tullv aware of their situation are

"more engaged with important people in
their lives," he said.
The committee's first action involved in
forming patients of their legal rights. At the
committee's recommendation, the Office of
Community and Patient Relations has
become a central location from which hospi
tal patients and citizens of the entire com
munity can obtain documents expressing
whether they desire extraordinary life sup
port withdrawn or withheld in the event of
terminal illness.
These documents include a living will, a
California Natural Death Act directive, and
a form to assign durable power of attorney
for health care in California.
The living will carries no legal force. The
California Natural Death Act, passed in
1976, is legally binding, but only when a pa
tient files the form at least two weeks after
two physicians have certified the patient ter
minally ill. Such requirements render the
directive "impractical" and its usage is
"uncommon," Kennedy said.
The new durable power of attorney
"allows competent adults to name other
persons as their 'attorneys in fact," who are
empowered to make virtually all medical
decisions for patients who become mentally
incompetent," according to an official letter
from the ethics committee.
The second mailing, to be issued in mid-
March to the medical community, contains a
complete list of patient rights in addition to
a discussion of DNR orders.

"It wasn't until my internship that I
realized what the patient's rights were,"
Ruark said. With the great complexity of
modern medicine, "to take the time to do
things properly ethically is difficult," he
said.
Health care, however, is becoming a more
"consumer-oriented" process, Ruark said.
"The image of doctor as God is through."*
Doctors would appreciate a group that
could "identify overall concepts and policies
for how one might approach larger issues,"
Raffin said.
With new interest stirred by the recent
Baby Doe regulations that render it illegal
to remove life support from impaired new
borns, Raffin said the committee now finds
itself faced with the task of carefully study
ing "the ethics of dealing with critically ill
and/or impaired infants."

The new durable power of attorney
"allows competent adults to name other
persons as their 'attorneys in fact," who are
empowered to make virtually all medical
decisions for patients who become mentally
incompetent," according to an official letter
from the ethics committee.
The second mailing, to be issued in mid-
March to the medical community, contains a
complete list of patient rights in addition to
a discussion of DNR orders.

"It wasn't until my internship that I
realized what the patient's rights were,"
Ruark said. With the great complexity of
modern medicine, "to take the time to do
things properly ethically is difficult," he
said.
Health care, however, is becoming a more
"consumer-oriented" process, Ruark said.
"The image of doctor as God is through."*
Doctors would appreciate a group that
could "identify overall concepts and policies
for how one might approach larger issues,"
Raffin said.
With new interest stirred by the recent
Baby Doe regulations that render it illegal
to remove life support from impaired new
borns, Raffin said the committee now finds
itself faced with the task of carefully study
ing "the ethics of dealing with critically ill
and/or impaired infants."
The Stanford Medical Center's
Committee on Medical Ethics is
scheduled to release later this month
a two-page statement aimed at clari
fying official hospital policy on "do
not resuscitate" (DNR) orders, ac
cording to Pamela Perkins, a member
of the committee staff.
DNR orders are directives by
physicians "that heroic or extraordi
nary means should not be employed
on behalf of the patient," according
to an official hospital policy state
ment. "Resuscitation does not mean
or refer to ordinary or routine meth
ods used to maintain life," the state
ment said.
"We must be sure that DNR orders
are consistently executed," said
Jeanne Kennedy, director of commu
nity and patient relations at the medi
cal center and a member of the ethics
committee.
In normal circumstances, a
physician "must have the informed
consent of the patient" to issue a
DNR order, according to Dr. Tom
Raffin. a member of the ethics com
mittee and assistant professor of res
piratory medicine. When a patient
becomes incompetent to judge,
however, physicians must obtain a
"substituted judgment," a best es

timation of what the patient would
want based upon any instructions left
by the patient to relatives or in
writing. Raffin said.
Questions still remain between ex
traordinary and standard life support.
"1 don't think it's reasonable to dis
criminate between extraordinary and
just life support.'" Raffin said. In a
recent case, for example, the New Jer
sey Supreme Court upheld a decision
not to give "prolonged nasal feeding"
to a patient in an irreversible coma,
Raffin said.
Official hospital policy does in
clude such a process, termed
"intubation," among its list of ex
traordinary means to maintain life.
The ethics committee was estab
lished in September 19K3 by Dr.
Lawrence Crowley, professor of sur
gery and president of Stanford Hospi
tal, and is chaired by Dr. Thomas
Gonda, professor of psychiatry and
humanities special programs. Mem
bers include physicians, nurses, medi
cal students, chaplains, economists,
lawyers, social workers, sociologists
and philosophers.
The ethics committee is charged to
"suggest policies and practices aimed
to ensure sound decisionmaking with
respect to ethically difficult situa-
tions,' Kennedy said. "We are not a com
mittee that deals with issues on the spot,"
she said. "Individual cases are
retrospectively rather than prospectively
discussed."
The committee's first efforts were aimed
at analyzing a touchy ethical incident pre
sented by committee member Dr. John
Ruark, chief resident in psychiatry.
A leukemia patient who was "not inclined
to initiate conversation about what he
wanted to have happen" in the event of an
emergency suddenly developed severe com
plications, Ruark said. The patient had ex
pressed his wishes to the nursing staff but
not to the attending physician. The
physician had not asked the patient his
wishes, and the complications made further
communication with the patient impossible,
Ruark said.
"Problems that have a probability of
arising need to be dealt with before they
become acute," Ruark said. But, "The
desire to maintain an optimistic attitude can
sometimes color a physician's view," he
said.
"There's evidence to support that com
plete disclosure (of all possibilities) versus
no disclosure has no effect at all on sur
vival," Ruark said. Statistics show that
patients tullv aware of their situation are

"more engaged with important people in
their lives," he said.
The committee's first action involved in
forming patients of their legal rights. At the
committee's recommendation, the Office of
Community and Patient Relations has
become a central location from which hospi
tal patients and citizens of the entire com
munity can obtain documents expressing
whether they desire extraordinary life sup
port withdrawn or withheld in the event of
terminal illness.
These documents include a living will, a
California Natural Death Act directive, and
a form to assign durable power of attorney
for health care in California.
The living will carries no legal force. The
California Natural Death Act, passed in
1976, is legally binding, but only when a pa
tient files the form at least two weeks after
two physicians have certified the patient ter
minally ill. Such requirements render the
directive "impractical" and its usage is
"uncommon," Kennedy said.
