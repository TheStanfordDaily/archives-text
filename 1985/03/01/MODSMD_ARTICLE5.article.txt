### TODD RAMMING Staff writer 
The Stanford Medical Center's
Committee on Medical Ethics is
scheduled to release later this month
a two-page statement aimed at clari
fying official hospital policy on "do
not resuscitate" (DNR) orders, ac
cording to Pamela Perkins, a member
of the committee staff.
DNR orders are directives by
physicians "that heroic or extraordi
nary means should not be employed
on behalf of the patient," according
to an official hospital policy state
ment. "Resuscitation does not mean
or refer to ordinary or routine meth
ods used to maintain life," the state
ment said.
"We must be sure that DNR orders
are consistently executed," said
Jeanne Kennedy, director of commu
nity and patient relations at the medi
cal center and a member of the ethics
committee.
In normal circumstances, a
physician "must have the informed
consent of the patient" to issue a
DNR order, according to Dr. Tom
Raffin. a member of the ethics com
mittee and assistant professor of res
piratory medicine. When a patient
becomes incompetent to judge,
however, physicians must obtain a
"substituted judgment," a best es

timation of what the patient would
want based upon any instructions left
by the patient to relatives or in
writing. Raffin said.
Questions still remain between ex
traordinary and standard life support.
"1 don't think it's reasonable to dis
criminate between extraordinary and
just life support.'" Raffin said. In a
recent case, for example, the New Jer
sey Supreme Court upheld a decision
not to give "prolonged nasal feeding"
to a patient in an irreversible coma,
Raffin said.
Official hospital policy does in
clude such a process, termed
"intubation," among its list of ex
traordinary means to maintain life.
The ethics committee was estab
lished in September 19K3 by Dr.
Lawrence Crowley, professor of sur
gery and president of Stanford Hospi
tal, and is chaired by Dr. Thomas
Gonda, professor of psychiatry and
humanities special programs. Mem
bers include physicians, nurses, medi
cal students, chaplains, economists,
lawyers, social workers, sociologists
and philosophers.
The ethics committee is charged to
"suggest policies and practices aimed
to ensure sound decisionmaking with
respect to ethically difficult situa-
