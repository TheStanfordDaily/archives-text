### INDRA SEHDEV Staff writer 
People passing hy the north addition of
Stanford Hospital on Blake Wilbur Road
have probably noticed a rather large hole in
the middle of the hospital grounds. That
hole, the result of the excavation of 80.000
cubic yards of dirt, is the beginning of stage
two of the Hospital Modernization Project
(HMP).
"In general terms we're redoing our
hospital in a more than $100 million proj
ect." according to Mike Goodkind, director
of the Medical Center News Sen ice.
Elvia Garwood. HMP deputy director,
said the project is scheduled for completion
in the fall of 1987 at an estimated cost of $ 112
million.
"It is a two-stage project." Garwood ex
plained "The first stage involves the com
pletion of the stage one building and the
second stage involves new construction."
Patients should not incur any significant
increases in their hospital bills as a result of

the modernization, according to Garwood.
Sources of funding for HMP arc varied.
The hospital will use approximately $30 mil
lion from internal sources and gifts. The
Stanford Hospital Board, faculty and com
munity physician groups, as well as the
hospital staff, have organized task forces for
fund raising.
By the project's completion, donations
are expected to provide $8 million. The total
goal for donations is $15 million.
The balance, about $82 million, has been
provided by a tax-exempt bond issue
The stage one building of the hospital is
the north addition that was built in 1975.
Garwood explained. "When the stage one
addition was built, some areas were left un
finished." she said. Stage one. which began
last summer, involves completion of the un
finished areas.
Early stage one projects will complete the
cardiovascular-angiography area and in
patient radiology. Stage one projects also in
volve remodeling the hospital cafeteria and

dietary preparation area, creating a new
galleria dining area and expanding the ma
terials handling areas. These projects are
scheduled to be completed by October 19N6.
Stage two began in December.
Where the NO.OOO cubic yards of dirt once
were, a four-story building will he built.
The new construction will increase the
number of private rooms from 1 1 percent to
33 percent of total beds. Garwood said. Fur
thermore. the building will consolidate adult
intensive care, provide a new 20-room sur
gery suite, establish a new clinical laboratory
and expand diagnostic and treatment areas.
HMP was designed to keep up with
changing technology in the field of
medicine, according to Garwood. The
hospital, which was built in the 19505, cur
rently lacks space and flexibility. The
modernization will correct deficiencies and
functional difficulties.
