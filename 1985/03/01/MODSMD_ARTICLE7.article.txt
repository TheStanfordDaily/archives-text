Soviets exclude U.S. from contracts
MOSCOW *■— The Soviet Union is now preparing its econpmic plan
for the rest of this decade and there are clear signs that virtually all big
Soviet contracts for major development projects are going to be
awarded to West European and Japanese companies, to the virtual ex
clusion of U.S. industry.
While Moscow has long been used to dealing with the Western
Europeans and Japanese on major commercial contracts, with most U.S.
trade being in grain and other commodities, Kremlin planners in the past
appeared to have been at least open to discussing projects with
America lis. But Soviet sources, in a major departure in planning and de
velopment here, indicate that the Kremlin is leaning toward or perhaps
already has made a decision not to include U.S. companies in long-term
development contracts.
The stakes are substantial. As the Soviet economy has begun to show
modest growth alter the slump of the early 1980s, several projects worth
$1 billion or more will be built, for the first time, by foreign firms from
design to start-up under so-called "turnkey contracts." Virtually no U.S.
firms are involved in current commercial negotiations for such
multimillion-dollar projects.
Well-informed Soviet trade officials say this pattern has prompted an
internal debate here, with important elements in the foreign and foreign
trade ministries arguing for U.S. economic participation, both for eco
nomic and political reasons.
But the prevailing view among high officials in the Central Commit
tee, the State Planning Commission and the Foreign Trade Ministry is
that commercial relations with the United States should be limited to
specific, short-term contracts.
According to,this prevailing view, the myriad political differences be
tween the two superpowers rule out any guarantee that politics will not
once again be injected into East-West trade. Consequently, it is argued,
the Soviet Bloc nations should develop their economic plans in a way to
reduce their vulnerability to any possible future U.S. boycott.
IRA guerrillas mortar police base
NEWRY, Northern Ireland ~» At least six police officers were killed
yesterday when IRA guerrillas mortared the heavily fortified police base
at Newry, police reported.
At least three shells that exploded inside the base on the border with
the Irish Republic hit a canteen packed with officers on an evening tea
break, said a police spokesman, who declined to be identified.
At least six other officers were seriously wounded in the attack, the
spokesman said. Three or four officers received minor wounds.
A spokeswoman at police headquarters in Belfast reported "at least
17 casualties, some of them serious" in the attack.
The outlawed Irish Republican Army said in a statement telephoned
to news organizations in Belfast, the capital, that its fighters carried out
the attack.
"This was a major and well-planned operation, indicating our ability
to strike where and when we decide," the IRA statement said.
Police said the mortars were fired by remote control from the back of
a hijacked truck parked several blocks from the police post, which is in
the center of the mainly Roman Catholic town and ringed by houses.
Rescue teams dug through the rubble searching for bodies. They
worked in darkness because authorities feared lights would enable IRA
snipers to fire on the officers.
Heavily armed troops and police sealed off Newry, but the attackers
were believed to have slipped back across the border into the Republic
before the mortars were fired.
The reported death toll was believed to be the worst single casualty
count suffered by the predominantly protestant Royal Ulster Con
stabulary since Northern Ireland's sectarian and political bloodshed
erupted in August 1969.
! The mortar attack was the latest instance in a surge of violence in the
. . province, where eight people have beertHritted-in the last todays.
Middle East diplomacy intensifies
WASHINGTON — Middle East diplomacy appeared yesterday to
reach its most feverish pace since the historic Camp David conference in
1978, but U. S. officials talked skeptically about "a gap between words
and deeds" and rebuffed calls from all sides to serve as intermediaries in
possible negotiations.
"These are beginning positive steps but there remains a long road
ahead," State Department spokesman Edward Djerejian said of the
sudden flurry of diplomatic activity.
Within the last three weeks, Israel, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and
the Palestine Liberation Organization have called for negotiations to
settle the Arab-Israeli conflict although each side attached conditions
that made its overature unacceptable to at least one other party. In the
past, the United States has sought to play the role of mediator in such
situations, attempting to underline the agreements and to gloss over the
disagreements.
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak plans to visit Washington later
, this month to urge President Reagan to do just that. His visit comes on
' • the heels of calls from leaders of Israel, Jordan and Saudi Arabia for the
* United States to take a more active role.
But, judging from the comments of U.S. officials yesterday, the Egyp
' tian leader faces a difficult task in persuading the Reagan administra
* tion.
"We are ready to step in and be helpful when the time is appropriate,
' (but)... it is up to them (the Arabs and the Israelis) to get started, to set
* the tone," White House spokesman Larry Speakes said.
Tanker war in Gulf resumed
r, A i
BAGHDAD, Iraq — Iraq resumed attacks against tankers in the Per
- sian Gulf Wednesday by announcing a raid on a large naval target near
v Iran's main oil export terminal at Kharg Island.
A military spokesman quoted by the official Iraqi news agency said
the target sustained "accurate and effective hits" and that all attack
* planes returned safely to base.
The spokesman said the attack was the 126 th by Iraq since it initiated
. the tanker war one year ago to disrupt Iran's exports from the gulf.
* There was no independent confirmation from shipping sources who
said earlier in the day that a Greek tanker came under machine-gun fire
I- attack by three unidentified warplanes in the central part of the gulf.
* The 123,648-ton Captain John Livanos headed to the United Arab
Emirates port of Dubai to repair damages. There were no casualties
among its 29 Greek and Pakistani crew,
The last reported Iraqi attack was on Feb. 14 against the Greek tanker
Ncptunia, which exploded three days later near Iran's Bushehr Island.
One crew member was killed and three others were injured.
Wednesday's attack appeared to signal another round in the tanker
1 war. in keeping with an Iraqi pattern maintained over the past year. Nine
* ships were damaged by Iraq in the last round, which started in January,
with Iran subsequently retaliating with three attacks on the Arab side of
the gulf that killed one Japanese seaman and injured two others.
Japanese arrest reputed gangsters
TOKYO — Police have arrested 891 gangsters and seized 46 guns in
the past month to suppress a feud between two gangs following the fatal
shooting of Japan's most powerful underworld boss, police said yester
day.
A national police spokesman who asked not to be identified said that
since Masahisa Takenaka's murder on Jan. 26, there have been at least
15 incidents between the two organizations.
Last Saturday, two members of a group affiliated with the Ichiwa-kai
gang were killed in Kochi, southwestern Japan, allegedly by members of
the Yamaguchi-gumi, the biggest of Japan's organizations of "yakuza,"
or gangsters, with a reported 10.400 members.
The Ichiwa-kai split from the Yamaguchi-gumi after Takenaka
assumed the leadership.
The spokesman said list of arrests and seizures was compiled Wed
nesday and did not include an M-16 automatic rifle and 19 bullets seized
today from the home of Masumi Furukawa, a reputed gangster police
say is affiliated with the Yamaguchi-gumi.

to strike where and when we decide," the IRA statement said.
Police said the mortars were fired by remote control from the back of
a hijacked truck parked several blocks from the police post, which is in
the center of the mainly Roman Catholic town and ringed by houses.
Rescue teams dug through the rubble searching for bodies. They
worked in darkness because authorities feared lights would enable IRA
snipers to fire on the officers.
Heavily armed troops and police sealed off Newry, but the attackers
were believed to have slipped back across the border into the Republic
before the mortars were fired.
The reported death toll was believed to be the worst single casualty
count suffered by the predominantly protestant Royal Ulster Con
stabulary since Northern Ireland's sectarian and political bloodshed
erupted in August 1969.

Middle East diplomacy intensifies
WASHINGTON — Middle East diplomacy appeared yesterday to
reach its most feverish pace since the historic Camp David conference in
1978, but U. S. officials talked skeptically about "a gap between words
and deeds" and rebuffed calls from all sides to serve as intermediaries in
possible negotiations.
"These are beginning positive steps but there remains a long road
ahead," State Department spokesman Edward Djerejian said of the
sudden flurry of diplomatic activity.
Within the last three weeks, Israel, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and
the Palestine Liberation Organization have called for negotiations to
settle the Arab-Israeli conflict although each side attached conditions
that made its overature unacceptable to at least one other party. In the
past, the United States has sought to play the role of mediator in such
situations, attempting to underline the agreements and to gloss over the
disagreements.
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak plans to visit Washington later
, this month to urge President Reagan to do just that. His visit comes on
' • the heels of calls from leaders of Israel, Jordan and Saudi Arabia for the
* United States to take a more active role.
But, judging from the comments of U.S. officials yesterday, the Egyp
' tian leader faces a difficult task in persuading the Reagan administra
* tion.
"We are ready to step in and be helpful when the time is appropriate,
' (but)... it is up to them (the Arabs and the Israelis) to get started, to set
* the tone," White House spokesman Larry Speakes said.
Tanker war in Gulf resumed
r, A i
BAGHDAD, Iraq — Iraq resumed attacks against tankers in the Per
- sian Gulf Wednesday by announcing a raid on a large naval target near
v Iran's main oil export terminal at Kharg Island.
A military spokesman quoted by the official Iraqi news agency said
the target sustained "accurate and effective hits" and that all attack
* planes returned safely to base.
The spokesman said the attack was the 126 th by Iraq since it initiated
. the tanker war one year ago to disrupt Iran's exports from the gulf.
* There was no independent confirmation from shipping sources who
said earlier in the day that a Greek tanker came under machine-gun fire
I- attack by three unidentified warplanes in the central part of the gulf.
* The 123,648-ton Captain John Livanos headed to the United Arab
Emirates port of Dubai to repair damages. There were no casualties
among its 29 Greek and Pakistani crew,
The last reported Iraqi attack was on Feb. 14 against the Greek tanker
Ncptunia, which exploded three days later near Iran's Bushehr Island.
One crew member was killed and three others were injured.
Wednesday's attack appeared to signal another round in the tanker
1 war. in keeping with an Iraqi pattern maintained over the past year. Nine
* ships were damaged by Iraq in the last round, which started in January,
with Iran subsequently retaliating with three attacks on the Arab side of
the gulf that killed one Japanese seaman and injured two others.
Japanese arrest reputed gangsters
TOKYO — Police have arrested 891 gangsters and seized 46 guns in
the past month to suppress a feud between two gangs following the fatal
shooting of Japan's most powerful underworld boss, police said yester
day.
A national police spokesman who asked not to be identified said that
since Masahisa Takenaka's murder on Jan. 26, there have been at least
15 incidents between the two organizations.
Last Saturday, two members of a group affiliated with the Ichiwa-kai
gang were killed in Kochi, southwestern Japan, allegedly by members of
the Yamaguchi-gumi, the biggest of Japan's organizations of "yakuza,"
or gangsters, with a reported 10.400 members.
The Ichiwa-kai split from the Yamaguchi-gumi after Takenaka
assumed the leadership.
The spokesman said list of arrests and seizures was compiled Wed
nesday and did not include an M-16 automatic rifle and 19 bullets seized
today from the home of Masumi Furukawa, a reputed gangster police
say is affiliated with the Yamaguchi-gumi.
Soviets exclude U.S. from contracts
MOSCOW *■— The Soviet Union is now preparing its econpmic plan
for the rest of this decade and there are clear signs that virtually all big
Soviet contracts for major development projects are going to be
awarded to West European and Japanese companies, to the virtual ex
clusion of U.S. industry.
While Moscow has long been used to dealing with the Western
Europeans and Japanese on major commercial contracts, with most U.S.
trade being in grain and other commodities, Kremlin planners in the past
appeared to have been at least open to discussing projects with
America lis. But Soviet sources, in a major departure in planning and de
velopment here, indicate that the Kremlin is leaning toward or perhaps
already has made a decision not to include U.S. companies in long-term
development contracts.
The stakes are substantial. As the Soviet economy has begun to show
modest growth alter the slump of the early 1980s, several projects worth
$1 billion or more will be built, for the first time, by foreign firms from
design to start-up under so-called "turnkey contracts." Virtually no U.S.
firms are involved in current commercial negotiations for such
multimillion-dollar projects.
Well-informed Soviet trade officials say this pattern has prompted an
internal debate here, with important elements in the foreign and foreign
trade ministries arguing for U.S. economic participation, both for eco
nomic and political reasons.
But the prevailing view among high officials in the Central Commit
tee, the State Planning Commission and the Foreign Trade Ministry is
that commercial relations with the United States should be limited to
specific, short-term contracts.
According to,this prevailing view, the myriad political differences be
tween the two superpowers rule out any guarantee that politics will not
once again be injected into East-West trade. Consequently, it is argued,
the Soviet Bloc nations should develop their economic plans in a way to
reduce their vulnerability to any possible future U.S. boycott.
IRA guerrillas mortar police base
NEWRY, Northern Ireland ~» At least six police officers were killed
yesterday when IRA guerrillas mortared the heavily fortified police base
at Newry, police reported.
At least three shells that exploded inside the base on the border with
the Irish Republic hit a canteen packed with officers on an evening tea
break, said a police spokesman, who declined to be identified.
At least six other officers were seriously wounded in the attack, the
spokesman said. Three or four officers received minor wounds.
A spokeswoman at police headquarters in Belfast reported "at least
17 casualties, some of them serious" in the attack.
The outlawed Irish Republican Army said in a statement telephoned
to news organizations in Belfast, the capital, that its fighters carried out
the attack.
"This was a major and well-planned operation, indicating our ability
to strike where and when we decide," the IRA statement said.
