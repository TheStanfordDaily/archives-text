# Reagan defends education policies

WASHINGTON â€” Pre' it Reagan said yes
terday that the nation's colleges have gained far
more from the economic recovery than they will
ever lose in budget cuts and called on educators to
give young children "a picture of America that is
balanced and full" by teaching good things about
the country as well as bad.
In a speech that ranged over some of the touch
iest issues in U.S. education, Reagan declared,
"We cannot allow our curricula to be determined
by narrow interest groups."
Children should learn that air and water pollu
tion have decreased, he said, and "our children
should know that, because Americans abhor dis
crimination, the number of black families living in
our suburbs has grown more than three times the
rate of white families living in the suburbs, and
that, between 1960 and 1982, the number of black
Americans in our colleges more than quadrupled."
Reagan said the economic recovery has
produced the largest one-year increase in 17 years
in the value of college endowments, to $29.6 billion
in 1983. He also said that, thanks to the decline in
inflation, the purchasing power of total U. S.
spending on education has increased $18 billion in
his administration even with cuts in federal aid. In
the Carter administration, he said, when inflation
reached double digits, this purchasing power
decreased $17 billion.
Addressing the National Association of Indepen
dent Schools, Reagan also defended his budget
proposals to cut college student aid. Education Sec
retary William Bennett fueled the fight over that
issue two weeks ago when he acknowledged there
might be hardships for some families, but the cuts
might simply force some students to give up cars,
stereos and vacations.
Reagan said the cuts are tilted so the neediest
would not suffer. He called them "prudent.

reasonable and just." And he opened his speech
with several humorous asides to the combative new
education secretary, calling him "an authority on
rock n' roll" and chiding him for "mincing your
words" in interviews.
In other remarks the president decried a
"learning gap" between students in this country
and in the Soviet Union, where he said children are
taught algebra and geometry in elementary school;
called for a back-to-basics curriculum to ensure
that all students "become fully conversant with sci
ence and math, as well as history, reading and
writing"; and called for a return to "discipline" in
classrooms, saying "there's no need to call in a
grand jury every time a principal needs to check a
student locker."
Reagan said he was instructing Bennett and At
torney General Edwin Meese to review federal
laws and suggest any changes that might help state
and local school officials "maintain effective dis
cipline." He also renewed his call for tuition tax
credits and educational vouchers as two proposals
to "expand parental choice" and "foster greater di
versity" in the education system.
Reagan's speech was partly aimed at quelling the
brushfire of criticism over the administration's
proposals to cut student college aid by about 25
percent while knocking an estimated one million
students off the federal aid rolls. That plan has
been roundly attacked by the higher education
community and by both parties on Capitol Hill, and
yesterday appeared headed for some drastic revi
sion.
Shortly after Reagan's speech. Sen. Robert Staf
ford (R-Vt.) chairman of the Senate Education
subcommittee, told a separate conference of trade
and technical schools that Senate Republican
leaders are weighing an alternative "freeze" in
spending on all education programs, with a modest

7 percent reduction in student loan funds that could
he achieved mostly through administrative
changes.
Earlier yesterday. Bennett came under sharp
criticism from the House committee on Education
and Labor. Bennett told the panel that the loan
program had provided "a windfall" of profits for
many banks while many students were falsely call
ing themselves independent of their parents to
qualify for more loans.
Reagan picked up on that theme in his speech.
"In our proposal," he said, "we have recom
mended reserving aid for the needy, limiting aid
per student to a level we can afford, closing
loopholes that lead to abuse and error, and cutting
excessive subsidies to banks and others."
Reagan criticized the current system that he said
gives federal aid to some students from families
earning more than $ l()0,()()()-a-year. "This defies
common sense, insults simple justice, and must
stop," Reagan said. "Government has no right to
force the least affluent to subsidize the sons and
daughters of the wealthy."
Reagan's proposals include an income ceiling of
$32,5()()-a-year for access to the popular
guaranteed student loan program. Critics have said
that those limits would cause a "redistribution" of
students from the more expensive private colleges
into the public universities.
Reagan did not address the issue of whether his
programs would deny students the choice of at
tending a more expensive private college. But he
did advocate choice on the elementary and second
ary level by making a strong push for tuition tax
credits.
"Parents should have greater freedom to send
their children to the schools they desire," he said,
"and to do so without interference by local, state or
federal levels of government."
