# Bush denounces Ortega's offer
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Led by Vice
President George Bush, the Reagan
administration belittled Nicaragua's
latest peace initiative as insignificant
yesterday but contended that for the
Sandinista regime even to announce
it proved the success of U.S. policy in
Central America.
Administration spokesmen main
tained that Nicaraguan President
Daniel Ortega's offer was evidence
that support for the leftist Managua
government was declining among
Nicaragua's citizens, that his nation's
economy was collapsing under the
weight of militarism and that the
people were hungering for
democracy.
"His (Ortega's) so-called 'peace
initiative' — he's not doing it simply
because he's fat and happy down
there. ... He recognizes there is a
wave of change within Central
America, and he is seeking to see he
does not become a part of it,"
asserted White House spokesman
Larry Speakes, stepping up the ad
ministration's tough anti-Sandinista
rhetoric of the past two weeks.
"For some reason, he (Ortega) has

launched what appears to he a fairly
sophisticated offensive to influence
the United States Congress," Speakes
said.
On Wednesday, Ortega offered to
send 100 Cuban military advisers
home, declare a moratorium on ac
quisition of new weapons systems and
allow U.S. congressmen to visit
Nicaraguan military bases "without
restrictions." The Sandinista leader
said that his immediate goal was to
resume U.S.-Nicaraguan peace talks,
broken off last month by the adminis
tration.
What Speakes characterized as
"the definitive administration
response" was delivered yesterday by
Bush before the Austin, Texas,
Council on Foreign Affairs. In an un
precedented action, the vice presi
dential address was piped into the
White Hpuse press room and a tran
script of his remarks was distributed
here. In many respects. Bush's com
ments mirrored those of Speakes.
But even as the vice president and
the presidential spokesman dismissed
Ortega's overtures as non

substantive, Secretary of State
George Shultz was quoted in Ecuador
as expressing a willingness to meet
with the Nicaraguan leader today in
Montevideo, Uruguay, and to discuss
his ideas. Both men will he in the
Uruguayan capital to attend the in
auguration of President Julio San
guinetti.
Citing U.S. efforts to strengthen
struggling democracies in Central
America, and referring to Ortega's
peace initiative, Bush declared that
"something must be working when
changes like this — if indeed they are
changes — occur.
"On the face of it," Bush contin
ued, "offering to remove about 1 per
cent of the Cuban presence or to
pause in their imports of arms, which
they acknowledge could not be ab
sorbed at this time, do not appear to
represent significant moves. But it is
relevant to ask why they bother.
"Is it because Nicaraguan young
men are refusing to serve in the army
out of revulsion at their government's
policies and are joining the (U.S.-
backed) resistance? Is it because of
the outrage being expressed by the

(Roman Catholic) Church in
Nicaragua? Is it because of the col
lapse of their economy under the
weight of Sandinista militarism and
corruption? Is it because their people
see what is going on in neighboring
countries and want it for them
selves?"
Then, answering his own rhetorical
questions. Bush added: "Perhaps it is
because of all these reasons. Perhaps
it is because (U.S. economic and mili
tary aid) is working. Perhaps it is be
cause the struggling freedom fighters
appeal to the people of Nicaragua.
Whatever the cause, we would surely
welcome genuine Nicaraguan interest
in peace.
"All we are asking is that the San
dinistas commit themselves to spe
cific, concrete actions that would
show their good-faith interest in
peace, . . . stop exporting subversion
to their neighbors, reduce their
bloated military to restore regional
balance, sever military ties With Cuba
and the Soviet Bloc and begin to
honor their promises to the Organiza
tion of American States to create a
democratic, pluralistic system."
