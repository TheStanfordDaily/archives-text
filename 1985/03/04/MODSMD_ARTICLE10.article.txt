Selma march re-enacted
SELMA, Ala. — Blacks celebrated the 20th
anniversary of the voting-rights march from
Selma to Montgomery with a new pilgrimage yes
terday to "resurrect the spirit" of the civil-rights
struggle.
"We have unfinished business," said the Rev.
Jesse Jackson as several hundred blacks as
sembled for a symbolic mass crossing of the Ed
mund Pettus Bridge to start the five-day journey.
Police clashed with black marchers at the bridge
across the Alabama River on "Bloody Sunday"
in 1965.
The march ends Thursday at Alabama's
Capitol and follows the route that helped change
the nation's political landscape by opening poll
ing booths across the South to blacks.
What became known as "Bloody Sunday" in
the annals of the civil-rights movement inspired
an even larger march, backed by a federal court
order and National Guardsmen, on March 21
1965.
That 50-mile journey from Selma to Ala
bama's capital, in which King joined blacks and
whites from across the country, prompted
Congress to pass the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
The law made illegal the intimidation used to
deny the ballot to blacks or discourage them from
going to Deep South courthouses to register to
vote.

In the 20 years since, the number of black
elected officials in the 11 Southern states has
grown from fewer than 100 to more than 4,000,
according to the Atlanta-based Voter Education
Project, which organized the anniversary event
along with the SCLC.
Reagan debt blame seen
WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, W.Va. —
David Gergen, a former top aide to President
Reagan, told House Democrats yesterday that
most Americans still blame Congress — and not
the president — for the nation's $200 billion def
icit.
"It may not be true. I don't want to argue with
you about it. But it's the perception," Gergen,
the White House communications director until
January 1984, said at the concluding session of a
three-day Democratic issues conference at the
Greenbrier Hotel.
Gergen said Reagan remains the most popular
president since Franklin D. Roosevelt because of
the economic recovery, his ability as a "natural
communicator" and his knack for "making things
simple and understandable."
During a question-and-answer session, Rep.
Jack Brooks (D-Texas) noted that the federal
deficit had soared to more than $200 billion
during Reagan's presidency and asked: "How

does Reagan beat the rap? How does he comes
off like Jesus Christ?"
Goetz in trouble?
NEW YORK — Bernhard Goetz may be
"digging a very deep hole" for himself by speak
ing publicly about his shooting of four youths on
the subway, New York Police Commissioner
Benjamin Ward said yesterday.
Ward's comments came as prosecutors consid
ered seeking a more serious indictment against
Goetz, and as polls showed a majority of respon
dents in New York and nationwide supporting
Goetz's action.
Ward, who appeared on WNBC-TV's
"News4orum" program, said public comments
by Goetz suggested that he might have "a Mes
siah complex," a wish to be viewed as a savior.
"Now that he has decided to become public
and make these public statements, it just kind of
reminds me of someone who's digging a very
deep hole, and at some point the sides are going
to collapse on him, and we're going to find out a
lot more about Bernhard Goetz than we knew in
the past."
Goetz was indicted Jan. 19 for illegal weapons
possession by a grand jury that declined to charge
him with more serious offenses recommended by
prosecutors, such as attempted murder.
