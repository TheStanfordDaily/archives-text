Student dies in SJS fire
SAN JOSE — A young woman who was too
frightened to jump 25 feet from an upstairs win
dow died yesterday when fire swept through a
fraternity house near San Jose State.
Seven people who fled the burning Victorian
building yelled at Lori Jean Potter, 22, to jump.
"We were yelling, screaming, trying to get her
out," said Dwayne Graybill, president of Alpha
Tau Omega fraternity.
Firefighters found the unconscious woman in
an upstairs bedroom. Potter, of Burlingame,
was pronounced dead at a hospital.
The flames trapped Potter and two men, one of
them Bob Mercado, her boyfriend.
The two men jumped out windows, but could
not get Potter, a senior majoring in business mar
keting, to follow.
"She was apparently concerned about jumping
from that level," said fire Capt. Gerry Hubbard.
The blaze was started by "cigarette materials"
that smoldered in a love seat, Hubbard said.
Writers prepare walkout
BEVERLY HILLS — A strike against movie
and television producers appears certain as East
Coast members of the Writers Guild of America
vote today on a proposed $84 million contract
already rejected by West Coast members.
"They are more militant than we are," Writers
Guild Executive Director Naomi Gurian said of
the guild's East Coast members. In California,
guild members voted 1,255 to 803 Saturday for a
strike.

A strike, set to begin at 9:01 p.m. tonight,
would affect all motion picture and television
script writing, as well as any entertainment scripts
for radio. Radio and television newswriters
would be unaffected.
Movie studios and networks have been stock
piling scripts in anticipation of a walkout. The
taping season for prime-time television has
ended, and there will not be an immediate impact
there. The most likely area to show strain first
will be soap operas televised five times a week.
The last Writers Guild strike lasted 13 weeks
in 1981. Preceded by a 67-day actors' strike, it
permanently reduced network television viewer
ship.
Tug crew still not found
SAN FRANCISCO — After sighting one body
from a sunken tugboat, the Coast Guard
searched yesterday in rough seas off the North
ern California coast for five other missing crew
members who miglu be alive because of their sur
vival suits, officials said.
Coast Guard Lt. Tom Rydell said the crew of
the tugboat Willamette Pilot 111 told authorities
they were donning their rubberized survival suits
— a kind of super-insulated wet suit — when
they notified them that the boat was sinking at
just after midnight on Saturday.
"We still have hope for them," said Burke
Cummings, dispatcher for Western Tug and
Barge Corp. in San Francisco, which operates the
vessel. "The survival suits are designed for cold
water. They'll get hungry before they get cold in
50-degree water. They could last three days in

those suits."
Three airplanes and a Coast Guard cutter
searched in rough seas yesterday in an area about
50 miles west of Point Arena and 100 miles
northwest of San Francisco.
The seven-year-old, 115-foot Willamette sank
after it went out to recover a 365-foot barge that
had broken free from another tug, the Pacific
Challenge, the Coast Guard said. The reason for
the sinking still was under investigation.
U.S. closes border posts
SAN DIEGO — Nine remote U.S.-Mexico
border crossings were closed yesterday and im
migration officials armed themselves, determined
not to "tuck tail and run" after a tip that Mexican
drug dealers planned to kidnap and kill immigra
tion or customs officials.
"The public can be assured that customs is
going to protect the border as we have histori
cally done," spokesman Mike Fleming said.
"And we can also assure those intent on threat
ening customs service or any other law enforce
ment officer we're not going to tuck tail and
run."
Today's weather
The Stanford area is likely to be hit with a
rainstorm today. The storm and southwesterly
winds up to 20 mph will keep high temperatures
down in the 50s. Tonight's lows will be in the up
per 30s to 40s range, showers becoming oc
casional tonight and tomorrow. Tomorrow's
highs will be in the 50s.
