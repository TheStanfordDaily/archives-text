## Computer abuse spurs laws and technology 
### LARRY WEBER 
Computers have been around since the late 19505. So
have computer hackers and security forces to foil them.
Laws to punish those who illegally access information
stored in computers, however, are relatively new.
In 1979, a California state law made it a felony to gain
"unauthorized computer access" with malicious intent to
destroy data, to attempt to defraud, or to access consumer
credit information. Within the last two years, the law has
been modified to include trespassers, or those who merely
access without proper authorization regardless of their in
tent.
For the computer hacker, "the situation is totally differ
ent now, said Joan Birkhead, security administrator for
Stanford s computing facilitators, Information Technol
ogy Services (ITS).
"When you go around destroying data bases or stealing
information, that's not funny, that's crime," said Santa
Clara County District Attorney Doug Southard, founder
of a high-technology crime task force called DATTA
(District Attorney's Technology Theft Association).
The possibility ot such crime turned up on the Univer
sity of Southern California campus early last month, forc
ing officials there to investigate allegations that fake
transcripts were created and placed into the school's com
puter records and that phony degrees were being sold for
as much as $25,000. Although USC Vice Provost Sylvia
Manning said the investigation has yet to turn up any
evidence, the allegations raise general questions concern
ing the vulnerability of an educational institution's
computer-stored information.
"We see a lot of attempts to gain the system," said
Birkhead of ITS. "But they're like grains of sand against
the side of a house."
Stanford's computer system, according to Birkhead, is
like a mansion of information that has many entrances.
Each entrance requires fewer or more passwords or access
codes to get through it depending on the sensitivity of the
data behind its doors. After the necessary initial account
identification — a single password — some information
can be summoned and read. More sensitive information,
such as student academic records, requires knowledge of
access codes to get through three or more doors.
When an unauthorized person attempts to access with
out knowing the proper codes, the computer's security
detects a disturbance in the system and can boot the

would-be hacker. A disturbance can be felt at any level of
access, whether an individual gets through "door one' or
"door two."
The security system is "a built-in means of waving Hags
for us in cases where attention needs to be paid,"
Birkhead said.
She cited the case of the Homestead High School stu
dent who reportedly recently tried to access his academic
record, information stored in the computer banks of 11 S,
as an example of security in action. According to
Birkhead, the young man had somehow caught a glance ot
the correct password, but had forgotten it. Once the com
puter alerted ITS officials that someone was tumbling

around Homestead's privileged information, the password
was changed ahead of schedule.
"Passwords are not static. In that case, we changed it
immediately," Birkhead said. As a result, the student was
caught before he was able to access the information he
was reportedly seeking.
I he student's glimpsing of the access code brings up the
issue of internal breaches of trust. They are a constant n«k
to information security, according to Stanford Registrar
Sally Mahoney.
"The problem of inside abuse is a general problem that
exists with records, whether they are in manuscript or
computers," she said. "Record systems are largely depen

dent on the integrity of individuals."
USC's Manning confirmed Mahoney's view, saying that
more than 20 cases of grade changing occurred at the
school as the result of university employees accepting
money bribes from students. "There is always the chance
that someone is corruptible," she said. According to Man
ning, the implicated employees were quickly fired.
" Cirkhead indicated that at Stanford, the student wan
ting grade changes is one brand of hacker among a poten
tial many, owing to the diverse types of information ITS
stores here.
"Stanford is like any business. Our computers have a lot
of applications," she said.
She said that Stanford the corporation, Stanford the
educational institution, Stanford the private grant
receiving university and Stanford the hospital all place
information-storing demands on ITS.
Because of the recognized responsibility that ITS faces,
"Everyone in the University administrative community is
interested in maintaining computer security needs at ap
propriate levels," Birkhead said.
The situation is different at LOTS, according to student
computer consultant David Chen. "We can always restore
material here from back-up tapes," he said.
Stating that although LOTS would be easier to access
than University computers due to its lack of obscure
passwords, Chen said there is no reason for excessive
precaution at LOTS. "We have no sensitive information
stored here," he said.
On trying to get through ITS' security, he said, "It
would be pretty hard."
According to Birkhead. it is also getting harder. "As the
operating environment gets upgraded for new features
available to the market, so does the security surrounding
it," she said. "We keep enhancing it (ITS security)."
The toughness of security measures and new laws
protecting data bases have been the results of a new tech
nology with new demands, said District Attorney Sout
hard.
"Up to now. it has been a relatively unfamiliar technol
ogy, and we are trying to establish what is right and wrong
to establish an effective deterrent to unnacceptable be
havior," he said.
"There are criminal remedies available and society has
to treat this kind of behavior as a crime when the facts are
present," he added.

available to the market, so does the security surrounding
it," she said. "We keep enhancing it (ITS security)."
The toughness of security measures and new laws
protecting data bases have been the results of a new tech
nology with new demands, said District Attorney Sout
hard.
"Up to now. it has been a relatively unfamiliar technol
ogy, and we are trying to establish what is right and wrong
to establish an effective deterrent to unnacceptable be
havior," he said.
"There are criminal remedies available and society has
to treat this kind of behavior as a crime when the facts are
present," he added.

Computers have been around since the late 19505. So
have computer hackers and security forces to foil them.
Laws to punish those who illegally access information
stored in computers, however, are relatively new.
In 1979, a California state law made it a felony to gain
"unauthorized computer access" with malicious intent to
destroy data, to attempt to defraud, or to access consumer
credit information. Within the last two years, the law has
been modified to include trespassers, or those who merely
access without proper authorization regardless of their in
tent.
For the computer hacker, "the situation is totally differ
ent now, said Joan Birkhead, security administrator for
Stanford s computing facilitators, Information Technol
ogy Services (ITS).
"When you go around destroying data bases or stealing
information, that's not funny, that's crime," said Santa
Clara County District Attorney Doug Southard, founder
of a high-technology crime task force called DATTA
(District Attorney's Technology Theft Association).
The possibility ot such crime turned up on the Univer
sity of Southern California campus early last month, forc
ing officials there to investigate allegations that fake
transcripts were created and placed into the school's com
puter records and that phony degrees were being sold for
as much as $25,000. Although USC Vice Provost Sylvia
Manning said the investigation has yet to turn up any
evidence, the allegations raise general questions concern
ing the vulnerability of an educational institution's
computer-stored information.
"We see a lot of attempts to gain the system," said
Birkhead of ITS. "But they're like grains of sand against
the side of a house."
Stanford's computer system, according to Birkhead, is
like a mansion of information that has many entrances.
Each entrance requires fewer or more passwords or access
codes to get through it depending on the sensitivity of the
data behind its doors. After the necessary initial account
identification — a single password — some information
can be summoned and read. More sensitive information,
such as student academic records, requires knowledge of
access codes to get through three or more doors.
When an unauthorized person attempts to access with
out knowing the proper codes, the computer's security
detects a disturbance in the system and can boot the

would-be hacker. A disturbance can be felt at any level of
access, whether an individual gets through "door one' or
"door two."
The security system is "a built-in means of waving Hags
for us in cases where attention needs to be paid,"
Birkhead said.
She cited the case of the Homestead High School stu
dent who reportedly recently tried to access his academic
record, information stored in the computer banks of 11 S,
as an example of security in action. According to
Birkhead, the young man had somehow caught a glance ot
the correct password, but had forgotten it. Once the com
puter alerted ITS officials that someone was tumbling

around Homestead's privileged information, the password
was changed ahead of schedule.
"Passwords are not static. In that case, we changed it
immediately," Birkhead said. As a result, the student was
caught before he was able to access the information he
was reportedly seeking.
I he student's glimpsing of the access code brings up the
issue of internal breaches of trust. They are a constant n«k
to information security, according to Stanford Registrar
Sally Mahoney.
"The problem of inside abuse is a general problem that
exists with records, whether they are in manuscript or
computers," she said. "Record systems are largely depen

dent on the integrity of individuals."
USC's Manning confirmed Mahoney's view, saying that
more than 20 cases of grade changing occurred at the
school as the result of university employees accepting
money bribes from students. "There is always the chance
that someone is corruptible," she said. According to Man
ning, the implicated employees were quickly fired.
" Cirkhead indicated that at Stanford, the student wan
ting grade changes is one brand of hacker among a poten
tial many, owing to the diverse types of information ITS
stores here.
"Stanford is like any business. Our computers have a lot
of applications," she said.
She said that Stanford the corporation, Stanford the
educational institution, Stanford the private grant
receiving university and Stanford the hospital all place
information-storing demands on ITS.
Because of the recognized responsibility that ITS faces,
"Everyone in the University administrative community is
interested in maintaining computer security needs at ap
propriate levels," Birkhead said.
The situation is different at LOTS, according to student
computer consultant David Chen. "We can always restore
material here from back-up tapes," he said.
Stating that although LOTS would be easier to access
than University computers due to its lack of obscure
passwords, Chen said there is no reason for excessive
precaution at LOTS. "We have no sensitive information
stored here," he said.
On trying to get through ITS' security, he said, "It
would be pretty hard."
According to Birkhead. it is also getting harder. "As the
operating environment gets upgraded for new features
available to the market, so does the security surrounding
it," she said. "We keep enhancing it (ITS security)."
