## The 						Stanford Daily Resigning ourselves 
### 
When a few dozen students declared last year
that they wanted to be part of this year's student
government, each promised to work toward one
or another set of individual goals: obtaining
photo identification cards, shortening the lines at
the post office, beginning a shuttle-bus service to
San Francisco, improving University Food Ser
vice, cutting the ASSU's red tape, making a
deader Dead Week, and on and on and on.
Maybe we didn't expect the candidates to
achieve all their goals. But we did expect that all
the students we elected would at least stick with
their positions for the full year.
Seven of those students have let us down.
Council of Presidents member Alice Wells and
ASSU Senators George Ramos, Roland van
Galen and Bob Slater have all resigned their
posts for personal and academic reasons. Van
Galen and Wells said they had academic commit
ments, Ramos stopped out of school, and Slater
said outside interests would keep him from
devoting the time he should to the senate.
Why didn't they realize the conflicts before
they ran for office? It could be that none of them
knew the time commitment serving in the ASSU
would require — unlikely, given that Van Galen,
Slater and Wells had all been involved heavily in
the ASSU before — or it could be that none of

them ever planned to devote the time necessary
for their positions, which is the least we should
expect from our elected officials.
Senators Gloria Johnson, Jay Alter and Derek
Passarelli all cited frustrations they felt in the
senate as their reasons for resigning. Johnson said
she couldn't represent minority viewpoints as ef
fectively as she had hoped, Passarelli said he
doesn't "believe the ASSU does anything use
ful," and Alter said the senate is "not at all con
structive" and "wasteful."
Maybe all that is true. But it doesn't excuse
leaving the job halfway through. If there are
problems with the ASSU, how does quitting
make them go away? Certainly it's a beautiful
symbolic gesture, but as senators they were in the
best position to try to reform the ASSU. If they
didn't do it, who will?
In the end, we are left feeling cheated. Cheated
by the people who promised so much, but in the
end couldn't even fulfill the minimum of a full
term.
As the spring ASSU election nears, we hope
the students who run for office will at least con
sider what they're getting into before they toss
their proverbial hats into the ring. That's the least
we can expect.
