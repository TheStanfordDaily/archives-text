# Cut back U.S. military policy
## 
### 
In my last column, 1 defended the right to carry hand
guns and the right to use them against muggers in life
threatening situations.
Just when my faithful readers were convinced that they
had me correctly pigeonholed as an extreme conservative,
1 have decided that these loyal readers need to be kept off
balance. So today we are going to cut the Pentagon's
budget.
We're not going to do anything truly exciting — like re
ducing the military budget to zero and turning over provi
sion of defense to private enterprise.
Instead, 1 am simply going to propose a few modest
cuts. These cuts will reduce the burden of military spend
ing on the taxpayer and reduce the Pentagon's socialistic
distortion of the American

economy.
People with long memories
will recall that California state
legislator Tom Hayden, back
in his early radical days, once
called the American military
industrial complex one of the
world's largest socialist
economies.
The first important thing to
realize about cutting the mili
tary budget is that there isn't a

lot of fat. Of course, there is waste. But waste is inherent
in public procurement.
The problem with the easy solution of cutting the fat is
that you can't really do it. This was explained very well in
a Feb. 27 Wall Street Journal column by economist Her
bert Stein.
Stein's explanation points out that if you cut a $300 bil
lion military budget with X percent waste in it to a $270
billion budget with the same incentive structure, you will
still have the same X percent waste.
Other easy options are similarly illusory. "Stretching
out" acquisition drives up the cost per item. Targeting
particular weapons systems (B-l, MX, etc.) will not
remove the need for a similar weapon so long as the mis
sion is retained as necessary.
There are two basic remaining ways of cutting the mili
tary budget. The first is cutting (really disguising) labor
costs; the second is cutting military missions. Cutting mis
sions means cutting back objectives, goals that U.S.
foreign policy requires the military to be able to ac
complish.
Cutting labor costs would be done through the sleight of
hand of imposing some sort of military draft. Draftees
would be paid below-mt 1 rket wages, and the difference
would be cut out of the Pentagon's wage bill.
Real labor costs to society are just as high under a draft
as without one. (They may even be higher because some
draftees are forced to do less productive work than they
otherwise would do.) The principal victim is the young
draftee, who is forced to bear a hidden tax in lost wages
and a disrupted life.

The draft remains attractive to politicians and
bureaucrats because it allows the Pentagon to cut its
budget on paper while retaining current (or higher) man
power levels.
But we should resist a return of the draft in any form.
We should also insist on a repeal of draft registration.
(Reagan promised in 1980 to end registration. But who's
counting Reagan's broken promises?)
A draft in any form is simply short-term slavery. As
such, it is antithetical to a free society.
The only remaining way to cut the military budget is to
cut missions. This is a truth many liberals are unwilling to
face.
This unwillingness is quite understandable. Liberals

share, with a few minor differ
ences, the foreign policy goals
of the Reagan administration.
After all, the fundamental
U.S. foreign policy directive
has remained the same since
the Truman administration:
containment of the Soviet
Union.
Liberals, like conservatives,
are basically global meddlers.
True, liberals talk more about

the importance of diplomacy
before they send in the Marines. But that is about the only
difference.
The current U.S. arms buildup was begun not by
Reagan but by Carter, shortly after the fall of the shah.
Reagan's weapons programs are essentially a continuation
(in a few cases slightly accelerated) of plans put in place in
the Carter years.
Thus, the military budget is the price we taxpayers are
forced to pay for U.S. foreign policy, and the place to
begin in cutting the budget is cutting back the policy.
Today, the U.S. military perimeter stretches around the
world. It encompasses the Western Hemisphere, Western
Europe, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Australia, New
Zealand, the Persian Gulf — and probably China'and
Yugoslavia. Wars or changes of government in at least
these areas (what about Pakistan. Zaire, South Africa or
Egypt?) arc defined as threats to the United States that
will be responded to with U.S. military force if necessary.
I propose that instead the U.S. military be confined to
the protection of American shores. Former Pentagon
analyst Earl Ravenal has sketched in a 1984 booklet en
titled "Defining Defense" how this could be done.
If we cut missions, we can cut the force structure. Solely
by cutting general purpose forces that would no longer be
needed under a noninterventionist foreign policy,
Ravenal shows that we could have a military budget in the
$150 billion range instead of in the $300 billion range.
That's about the only kind of cut that would really make
a dent in military spending.

called the American military
industrial complex one of the
world's largest socialist
economies.
The first important thing to
realize about cutting the mili
tary budget is that there isn't a

lot of fat. Of course, there is waste. But waste is inherent
in public procurement.
The problem with the easy solution of cutting the fat is
that you can't really do it. This was explained very well in
a Feb. 27 Wall Street Journal column by economist Her
bert Stein.
Stein's explanation points out that if you cut a $300 bil
lion military budget with X percent waste in it to a $270
billion budget with the same incentive structure, you will
still have the same X percent waste.
Other easy options are similarly illusory. "Stretching
out" acquisition drives up the cost per item. Targeting
particular weapons systems (B-l, MX, etc.) will not
remove the need for a similar weapon so long as the mis
sion is retained as necessary.
There are two basic remaining ways of cutting the mili
tary budget. The first is cutting (really disguising) labor
costs; the second is cutting military missions. Cutting mis
sions means cutting back objectives, goals that U.S.
foreign policy requires the military to be able to ac
complish.
Cutting labor costs would be done through the sleight of
hand of imposing some sort of military draft. Draftees
would be paid below-mt 1 rket wages, and the difference
would be cut out of the Pentagon's wage bill.
Real labor costs to society are just as high under a draft
as without one. (They may even be higher because some
draftees are forced to do less productive work than they
otherwise would do.) The principal victim is the young
draftee, who is forced to bear a hidden tax in lost wages
and a disrupted life.

The draft remains attractive to politicians and
bureaucrats because it allows the Pentagon to cut its
budget on paper while retaining current (or higher) man
power levels.
But we should resist a return of the draft in any form.
We should also insist on a repeal of draft registration.
(Reagan promised in 1980 to end registration. But who's
counting Reagan's broken promises?)
A draft in any form is simply short-term slavery. As
such, it is antithetical to a free society.
The only remaining way to cut the military budget is to
cut missions. This is a truth many liberals are unwilling to
face.
This unwillingness is quite understandable. Liberals

share, with a few minor differ
ences, the foreign policy goals
of the Reagan administration.
After all, the fundamental
U.S. foreign policy directive
has remained the same since
the Truman administration:
containment of the Soviet
Union.
Liberals, like conservatives,
are basically global meddlers.
True, liberals talk more about

the importance of diplomacy
before they send in the Marines. But that is about the only
difference.
The current U.S. arms buildup was begun not by
Reagan but by Carter, shortly after the fall of the shah.
Reagan's weapons programs are essentially a continuation
(in a few cases slightly accelerated) of plans put in place in
the Carter years.
Thus, the military budget is the price we taxpayers are
forced to pay for U.S. foreign policy, and the place to
begin in cutting the budget is cutting back the policy.
Today, the U.S. military perimeter stretches around the
world. It encompasses the Western Hemisphere, Western
Europe, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Australia, New
Zealand, the Persian Gulf — and probably China'and
Yugoslavia. Wars or changes of government in at least
these areas (what about Pakistan. Zaire, South Africa or
Egypt?) arc defined as threats to the United States that
will be responded to with U.S. military force if necessary.
I propose that instead the U.S. military be confined to
the protection of American shores. Former Pentagon
analyst Earl Ravenal has sketched in a 1984 booklet en
titled "Defining Defense" how this could be done.
If we cut missions, we can cut the force structure. Solely
by cutting general purpose forces that would no longer be
needed under a noninterventionist foreign policy,
Ravenal shows that we could have a military budget in the
$150 billion range instead of in the $300 billion range.
That's about the only kind of cut that would really make
a dent in military spending.

In my last column, 1 defended the right to carry hand
guns and the right to use them against muggers in life
threatening situations.
Just when my faithful readers were convinced that they
had me correctly pigeonholed as an extreme conservative,
1 have decided that these loyal readers need to be kept off
balance. So today we are going to cut the Pentagon's
budget.
We're not going to do anything truly exciting — like re
ducing the military budget to zero and turning over provi
sion of defense to private enterprise.
Instead, 1 am simply going to propose a few modest
cuts. These cuts will reduce the burden of military spend
ing on the taxpayer and reduce the Pentagon's socialistic
distortion of the American

economy.
People with long memories
will recall that California state
legislator Tom Hayden, back
