## In support of the 'freedom fighters' 
### 
In its editorial "Talk with Nicaragua" (Feb. 27),
The Daily proposed that the United Stated
negotiate with the Sandinista regime. There are
many flaws in the editorial which I would like to
discuss.
The Daily claims that negotiations would "end
the bloodshed in Latin America and political tur
moil at home." First of all, talks will not add to
Central American security. On the contrary, they

VIEWPOINT

will further deteriorate it. The Sandinistas, un
checked by American pressure in the persons of the
contras, will continue to spread their tyrannical
views to their neighbors, thereby adding to the hos
tility in the region. On the home front, while it is
true that aid for the contras is a querulous issue,
this does not mean that we should abandon the
freedom fighters. The issue might provoke contro
versy. but then, so did entering World War I, so did
arming for World War 11, so did the implementa
tion of the New Deal. Divided opinion does not
assume error in politics.
Discussing the congressional opposition to the
contras. The Daily suggests that "Formal negotia
tions would offer the president a chance to save
face, especially if Congress decides to continue the
ban on aid in FY 19X5." To begin with, The Daily
assumes that there is something to be ashamed of in
supporting those who are fighting for freedom. The
president is following the correct path and should,
therefore, push all the harder for the approval of
funds. Without this aid, the Sandinistas will have a
free hand in both exporting their revolution and in
punishing the contras. Congress will then see the
errors of its ways. Perhaps renewing aid now will

allow Congress to avoid a future loss of face.
The Daily, in the editorial, makes two ludicrous
statements. First, The Daily states that "within a
formal negotiating framework, the president would
have an opportunity to suggest a greatly expanded
U.S. trade policy with Nicaragua that gives the San
dinista government an incentive to reassess its rela
tions with Moscow." There is no reason to believe
that Nicaragua, because it can get the bulk of its
needs from the Soviet Union at subsidized prices,
would come running with open arms to greet
American merchants. Trade with another country
does not ensure harmony. Furthermore, trading
with the Sandinista government does not have to
mean that Nicaragua will turn away from Marxism.
We trade extensively with the Soviet Union, yet the
Soviets are not about to renounce communism.
Then, incredibly, The Daily suggests the
"possibility of a new U.S.-Nicaraguan defense pact
that, if integrated with a larger Latin American al
liance, could help foster greater global stability."
Amazingly, The Daily desires that the LJnited
States join with and aid a government which is
diametrically opposed to American principles of
government and economy and one which looks to
undermine American allies in the region. The Daily
has conceived of the brilliant idea of aiding your
enemies in becoming stronger so that they can be in
a better and mightier position to attack you and
your allies Finally, The Daily's proposal for some
form of Latin American alliance ignores deep
seated animosities which exist between the various
Central American countries. The alliance, along
with American collaboration with the Sandinistas,
will lead only to hemispheric instability.
Critics claim that the Reagan administration, by
aiding the contras. acts contrary to the cause of

liberty. I ask how this can be. The contras are striv
ing to institute the democracy that the Sandinistas
originally promised before the imposition of the
oligarchy. It is within the bounds of democratic
governments to support and aid those who attempt
to overthrow tyranny. Let us not chop off the hands
of those reaching out to us for aid in throwing off
the shackles of oppression.
The United States must support the contras for
two reasons. Ideologically, the United States has an
obligation to promote the cause of freedom.
However, on a far more practical level, the
United States must back the freedom fighters in or
der to ensure the stability of the region and
therefore, the security of America. Allowing for
the continuance of the Sandinista regime sets a
dangerous precedent in a region so vital for the
safety of the United States.
Aid to the contras must be continued. Yet this
does not mean that diplomatic avenues should not
be explored. In politics, every option must be
weighed. But, with regard to Nicaragua, the U.S.
must not sign away the contra movement. America
can never compromise democracy in its accords. To
abandon the fight for freedom of the resistance
fighters would be to do just that.
The Daily concludes by stating that "it's time for
the president to inaugurate a diplomatic initiative
true to the ideals for which the Nicaraguan people
waged a revolution." The Sandinistas no longer
represent the aspirations and goals of their own
rebellion. They are a totalitarian, repressive
regime. The original Nicaraguan uprising was
fought for freedom. President Reagan must not set
tle for less. We must continue to support the con
tras, therefore, until democracy is established.

diametrically opposed to American principles of
government and economy and one which looks to
undermine American allies in the region. The Daily
has conceived of the brilliant idea of aiding your
enemies in becoming stronger so that they can be in
a better and mightier position to attack you and
your allies Finally, The Daily's proposal for some
form of Latin American alliance ignores deep
seated animosities which exist between the various
Central American countries. The alliance, along
with American collaboration with the Sandinistas,
will lead only to hemispheric instability.
Critics claim that the Reagan administration, by
aiding the contras. acts contrary to the cause of

liberty. I ask how this can be. The contras are striv
ing to institute the democracy that the Sandinistas
originally promised before the imposition of the
oligarchy. It is within the bounds of democratic
governments to support and aid those who attempt
to overthrow tyranny. Let us not chop off the hands
of those reaching out to us for aid in throwing off
the shackles of oppression.
The United States must support the contras for
two reasons. Ideologically, the United States has an
obligation to promote the cause of freedom.
However, on a far more practical level, the
United States must back the freedom fighters in or
der to ensure the stability of the region and
therefore, the security of America. Allowing for
the continuance of the Sandinista regime sets a
dangerous precedent in a region so vital for the
safety of the United States.
Aid to the contras must be continued. Yet this
does not mean that diplomatic avenues should not
be explored. In politics, every option must be
weighed. But, with regard to Nicaragua, the U.S.
must not sign away the contra movement. America
can never compromise democracy in its accords. To
abandon the fight for freedom of the resistance
fighters would be to do just that.
The Daily concludes by stating that "it's time for
the president to inaugurate a diplomatic initiative
true to the ideals for which the Nicaraguan people
waged a revolution." The Sandinistas no longer
represent the aspirations and goals of their own
rebellion. They are a totalitarian, repressive
regime. The original Nicaraguan uprising was
fought for freedom. President Reagan must not set
tle for less. We must continue to support the con
tras, therefore, until democracy is established.

In its editorial "Talk with Nicaragua" (Feb. 27),
The Daily proposed that the United Stated
negotiate with the Sandinista regime. There are
many flaws in the editorial which I would like to
discuss.
The Daily claims that negotiations would "end
the bloodshed in Latin America and political tur
moil at home." First of all, talks will not add to
Central American security. On the contrary, they

will further deteriorate it. The Sandinistas, un
checked by American pressure in the persons of the
contras, will continue to spread their tyrannical
views to their neighbors, thereby adding to the hos
tility in the region. On the home front, while it is
true that aid for the contras is a querulous issue,
this does not mean that we should abandon the
freedom fighters. The issue might provoke contro
versy. but then, so did entering World War I, so did
arming for World War 11, so did the implementa
tion of the New Deal. Divided opinion does not
assume error in politics.
Discussing the congressional opposition to the
contras. The Daily suggests that "Formal negotia
tions would offer the president a chance to save
face, especially if Congress decides to continue the
ban on aid in FY 19X5." To begin with, The Daily
assumes that there is something to be ashamed of in
supporting those who are fighting for freedom. The
president is following the correct path and should,
therefore, push all the harder for the approval of
funds. Without this aid, the Sandinistas will have a
free hand in both exporting their revolution and in
punishing the contras. Congress will then see the
errors of its ways. Perhaps renewing aid now will

allow Congress to avoid a future loss of face.
The Daily, in the editorial, makes two ludicrous
statements. First, The Daily states that "within a
formal negotiating framework, the president would
have an opportunity to suggest a greatly expanded
U.S. trade policy with Nicaragua that gives the San
dinista government an incentive to reassess its rela
tions with Moscow." There is no reason to believe
that Nicaragua, because it can get the bulk of its
needs from the Soviet Union at subsidized prices,
would come running with open arms to greet
American merchants. Trade with another country
does not ensure harmony. Furthermore, trading
with the Sandinista government does not have to
mean that Nicaragua will turn away from Marxism.
We trade extensively with the Soviet Union, yet the
Soviets are not about to renounce communism.
Then, incredibly, The Daily suggests the
"possibility of a new U.S.-Nicaraguan defense pact
that, if integrated with a larger Latin American al
liance, could help foster greater global stability."
