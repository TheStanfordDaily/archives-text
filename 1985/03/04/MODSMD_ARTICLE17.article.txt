Double standard
Jew-haters have for centuries
maintained a double standard with
which to judge Jews and non-Jews.
Jim Naureckas follows in their
footsteps by holding Israel and Jews
to standards which he does not apply
to other nations.
In his column titled "Any racial or
religious group can be an oppres
sor," (The Daily, Feb. 27)
Naureckas asserted that Israel is
"oppressive" because it is "an offi
cially Jewish state."
But Naureckas expressed no in
dignation or sense of "oppression"
that every state with an Arab
majority is officially an Arab state.
The Arab nation of nearly 200
million people enjoys national
sovereignty in 22 states, and oc
cupies an area as large as Central
America, Mexico, the United States
(including Alaska) and half of
Canada combined. But the problem
in the Middle East, according to
Naureckas, is that Israel exists —
although Israel has a population of
4.5 million and an area the size of
New Jersey and Delaware.
Naureckas asserted that Israel
oppresses its non-Jewish minority,
but he is strangely silent on Arab
oppression of non-Arab minorities:
• Although 11 million of Egypt's 44
million people are non-Arab Copts,
the Arab government of Egypt
prohibits these descendants of the
ancient Egyptians from building or
repairing their houses of worship
without special government permis
sion — permission which is usually
denied. Naureckas ignores Arab
Egyptian oppression.
• Although the Arab Republic of
Iraq has liquidated thousands of
Kurdish tribesmen — using napalm
and forced "relocation" of Kurds to
desert areas — Naureckas was silent
about this oppression of non-Arabs,
who number 25 percent of Iraq's
population of nine million.
• Although the white, Moslem Arab
government of the Sudan has
proclaimed an Islamic Arab
"republic" in that state, and has
killed hundreds of thousands of

non-Moslem blacks in the south of
the country in a lengthy civil war,
Naureckas was silent.
And when Naureckas wrote about
racism, he compares Israeli "racism"
to South Africa's apartheid — falsely
reporting that Israeli law prohibits
intermarriage between Jews and
Arabs. But Naureckas neglected to
mention that the Arab nation of
Mauritania abolished black slavery
only in 1980, that Saudi Arabia
abolished black slavery in 1962, and
that there are reports of black
slavery in "progressive" Algeria.
Naureckas was also silent c.n Saudi
Arabia's multi-billion dollar annual
trade with South Africa, which sup
ports South Africa's apartheid
policies.
Although Naureckas was offended
by "the racist idea that the Jewish
people can be at home only in a
Jewish state," he was not offended
that it is illegal to be a Jew in the
"moderate"' Arab kingdoms of Saudi
Arabia and Jordan, nor was he of
fended that it is dangerous to be a
Jew in every other Arab state.
And Naureckas forgot that 80
percent of Israel's Jews fled racism,
forced ghettoization, and second
class citizenship in the Arab
countries where their ancestors had
lived for centuries before Arabs
conquered the Middle East.
Clearly, it is the Arab racists and
Jew-haters — as well as their
European and American counter
parts — who have made the exis
tence of a Jewish state a necessity.
And just as clearly, Naureckas
damages his credibility — and the
search for justice in the Middle East
— by ignoring Arab oppression of
non-Arabs (including Jews), and by
holding Jews and Israel to standards
he does not apply to other peoples
and nations.

Superiority complex
Do you really want to scold me?
Do you really want to make me cry?

These are the musical questions I'd
like Stephen Mezias to answer.
Mezias' viewpoint analyzing what's
hot and what's not on the Farm (The
Daily, Feb. 26) is not only merciless,
but also exemplifies in the extreme
much of what appears on The Daily's
Opinions page.
Scold, scold, scold — why do so
many contributors to The Daily's
Opinions page seem to believe that
they are entitled to condescend to
their peers?
Here's what I've seen lately:
"How dare you Stanford students
attend Brother Jim's performance in
White Plaza?!"; "How dare you
Stanford students tattle-tale on that
interviewer from Goldman-Sachs?!";
"How dare you Stanford students
enthuse over fashion trends like flat
shoes with no socks?!"
They scold us as if we were little
kids who wet our pants on purpose.*
While I am sensitive to the good
intentions of these authors and ap-i
preciate their concerns, I would
nonetheless like to suggest to them
that their intended messages may be
obscured by unintented messages
communicated through their tone of
voice: Anger? Intolerance? Superi
ority?
In Mezias's viewpoint, for exam
ple, he writes of his concerns regard
ing Stanford's undergraduates, but
he expresses his concerns by deliver
ing some low blows, and he writes
with a heaping helping of condescen
sion and overheated cynicism. What
a great way to educate people!
Mezias closes his viewpoint with a
snide reminder to Stanford's under
graduates: "Just remember, in the
meantime, I'll be watching you;
you're my inspiration." Speaking as
one such inspiration, I would like to
offer, in conclusion, the following:
Before you enlighten your peers
again with your next viewpoint, take
care that you are also content with
the message we receive about you in
your tone of voice.
