# NCAA schools advise limits on frosh athletes

### GEOFF SANBORN Editorial staff 
After a two-day meeting at the
University of Miami (Fla.), officials
from 30 NCAA Division I-A schools
recommended Saturday that fresh
men be declared ineligible for varsity
football and basketball.
"In some cases there has been an
imbalance between academics and
athletics," said Edward Foote 11,
president of the University of Miami.
Foote, who called for the conference,
said a college freshman should not
practice football "before he knows
where the library is, before he knows
where the first class is."
Representatives of the Stanford
Athletic Department have opposed
the resolution, which will be sent to
the NCAA president's commission
and acted on at the NCAA conven
tion in June. Stanford did not have a
representative at the conference.
"It's stupid," Athletic Director
Andy Geiger said yesterday. "To say
that freshman A is the same as fresh
man B who is the same as freshman C

is unreasonable.
"I would be in favor of (the resolu
tion) only if no freshmen were writing
for The Daily, taking pictures for The
Daily, singing in the glee club and so
on," Geiger said.
Recruiting Coordinator Dick
James was concerned about the effect
the recommendation would have on
the Stanford football program. Ban
ning freshmen from the playing fields
would mean that more than 20 spots
on the football team would have to be
taken over by walk-on players.
"Freshmen are a valuable part of
our football program," James said.
"They have proven that they can play
and go to school . . . and we need to
count on them for depth and quality."
Among the schools represented at
the conference were Georgia, North
Carolina, Penn State, Nebraska, In
diana, Michigan, Alabama, UCLA
and Washington State. According to
James, none of these schools would
have as much trouble as Stanford in
finding walk-on players to take the
place of their freshmen.

"Because of our tuition and aca
demic standards ... we would be put
at much more of a disadvantage (by
this resolution)," James said. "We
don't have as many non-scholarship
players as state schools."
Faculty Athletic Representative
Jack Friedenthal also opposed the
committee's recommendation. He
favors an NCAA rule already on the
books that is scheduled to take effect
in 1986. The rule requires all fresh
men to have earned a 2.0 high school
grade-point average, to have com
pleted 11 specific core courses in high
school and to have scored at least a
combined 700 on the Scholastic Apti
tude Test in order to compete on the
football or basketball team.
"It's much better to have a rule dis
tinguishing between those who have
intellectual capabilities and those that
need help," Friedenthal said. The
new proposal "would mean that a

presidents would prohibit freshmen, like Stanford's
Scott Meinert, from competing in varsity basketball
or football.
thing," hriedenthal said. Paye, now a
sophomore, was a starter on the var
sity football and , basketball teams
during his freshman year here.
The reaction of Stanford freshman
football and basketball players to the
resolution was equally negative.
"I'm totally against it," said punter
Doug Robison. Robison said he
didn't know of any freshman football
players who found juggling academics
and athletics too difficult to manage.
"I hope they don't do it," said bas
ketball guard Scott Meinert. "I can
see where vour larger programs mijÂ»ht
need it . . . but personally, I don't
like the idea."
Basketball Coach Tom Davis
backed the resolution but did not
give it much chance of passing at the
NCAA convention.
"I think it's a good idea," he said.
"It might not benefit Stanford, but
it's a step in the right direction na
tionally."
