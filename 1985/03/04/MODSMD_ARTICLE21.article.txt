## Card sweeps ASU to open Six-Pac 
### TOM SENF Staff sportswriter 
Sound fundamental baseball took on ath
leticism this weekend at Sunken Diamond.
The fundamentals won.
Stanford played tough, hard-nosed baseball
as it got the Pacific 10 Southern Division
season off to a roaring start with a three-game
sweep of Arizona State, winning 9-8 Friday,
11-7 Saturday and 10-7 Sunday. The Card
inal had to come from behind in all three of
the high-scoring games.
At the plate, ASU showed why it is one of
the most feared offensive teams in the nation.
In the field and on the mound, however, the
Sun Devils showed why their record has fallen
to 8-17.
The wins gave Stanford a 3-0 record in the
Six-Pac, 15-4 overall. UCLA has an early
season half-game lead at 5-1 after sweeping
No. 4-ranked Arizona this weekend. Arizona
State is now 0-3 in the Six-Pac.
Stanford will travel to UCLA to face the
Bruins in a three-game series this weekend.
During the three games here, ASU hit nine
home runs, had 42 hits and scored 24 runs.
How could a team lose with hitting like
that?
With a pitching staff that allowed 30 runs
and 41 hits and a defense that committed 12
errors.
Yesterday, the Sun Devils must have
thought Stanford starter Kevin Kunkel was
one of the teammates they abuse during inter
squad games. Barry Bonds' leadoff triple and
Rick Morris' homer were the key hits in a
three-run, five-hit first inning.

After Mike Devereaux led off the second
with another round-tripper to left, Stanford
Coach Mark Marquess decided that Kunkel
had had enough for the day. Jack McDowell
came on and turned in a gutsy eight-inning
perfomance to raise his record to 3-2.
Meanwhile, the Cardinal had some
fireworks of its own going against ASU starter
Doug Henry. Ruben Amaro got Stanford on
the board in the first with a homer to straight
away center — his third of the year.
"It was a great feeling," Amaro said. "The
wind was blowing out for everybody, so I'll
take it."
Two batters later, Rick Lundblade hit a ball
that a hurricane couldn't have kept in the ball
park. His tremendous blast onto the soccer
field behind the stadium was estimated at
around 500 feet.
"Those are fun," Lundblade said. "It was
by far the longest one I've ever hit — and
probably ever will."
After John Verducci's RBI double brought
the Cardinal within one at 4-3, the Sun Devils
nicked McDowell for two runs in the fourth.
Catcher Brent Hahn drove in one run with a
double and scored the other on a groundout
by George Lopez.
Stanford scored single runs in the fourth
and fifth to close the gap to one. Amaro drove
in Pete Stanicek with a single, and Mark
Davis created a run on his own by being hit by
a pitch, stealing second, going to third on an
error and scoring on a wild pitch.
As it was all weekend, the seventh was the
big inning for the Cardinal. Stanford scored
four runs in the seventh inning of each game.

This time, the victim vyras ASU reliever
Charles Scott.
After Lundblade and Mike Deßenon sin
gled, Davis was walked intentionally — for
the second of three times in the game — to
load the bases for Toi Cook.
Scott got exactly what he wanted out of
Cook — a double-play ball to second
baseman Morris. Unfortunately for the Sun
Devils, Morris booted it and got no one.
"That was the ballgame right there,"
Marquess said.
The game was tied, but not for long. Ver
ducci fought off an inside fastball from Scott
and muscled it into center for a two-run
single.
Scott was replaced by Bill Dodd, but the
Cardinal wasn't through. Amaro matched
Verducci's three-RBI day with a single that
made the score 9-6.
Yesterday's intentional walks were an ac
knowledgment of the way Davis terrorized
the ASU pitching staff all weekend. The
junior center fielder went 6-for-10, scored six
runs and drove in four more, raising his bat
ting average to .403.
After Vince Cook's two-run homer put
ASU ahead 3-1 in the fourth on Saturday,
Davis walked and raced home all the way
from first on a two-run double by Toi Cook.
Pete Stanicek's sacrifice fly later in the inning
drove Cook home, putting Stanford ahead 4-
3.
In the fifth, right fielder Todd Brown
stroked a RBI single — one of four hits he
