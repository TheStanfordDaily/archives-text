# Swimmers 2nd at WCAAs

### INGRID SEYER Staff sportswriter 
It isn't often that a team loses a swim meet in the
very first race of the meet, but for the Stanford
women's swimming team, that is exactly what hap
pened as the Cardinal fell to the University of
Southern California, 800.5 to 788.5, in the Western
Collegiate Athletic Association Championships
this weekend.
"Our 200-yard medley relay team was disquali
fied in the first race of the meet and that loss was
what eventually lost the meet for us," Stanford
Coach George Haines said. "If we had won that
race, we would have won the meet."
Stanford was disqualified for an early jump from
the butterfly to the freestyle leg of the relay. If
Stanford had won the race, it would have received
40 points, but instead USC was able to capture
second place and open up a 34-0 lead over the
Cardinal. UCLA won the event, eventually placing

third in the championships with 582.5 points.
"Overall, I feel very good about the way our
team swam," Haines said. "We won 10 events to
USC's eight, which says a lot in itself."
Stanford trailed USC 278 to 235.5 after the first
day of competition Thursday. Junior Patty Gavin
was the team's leading scorer on Thursday, winning
the 200 individual medley (2:04.15) and tying for
first place in the 200 backstroke. Gavin went on to
win the 400 IM on Friday and placed third in the
200 butterfly on Saturday.
"Patty's swimming was suberb this weekend,"
Haines said. "A lot of times she is overlooked be
cause she swims in so many different events, but
her performance this weekend is certainly not one
to be overlooked."
Freshman Stacy Shupe was also victorious for the
Cardinal on Friday, with a victory in the 500
freestyle. Shupe, who also swam the lead leg of the
second-.place 800 freestyle relay that day, went on

to win the 1,650 freestyle on Saturday.
Although USC widened its lead to more than
100 points on Friday, winning three of that day's
six events, Stanford was victorious in two.
Junior Kathy Smith won the 100 breaststroke for
the Cardinal that day, and she went on to win the
200 breaststroke on Saturday. Smith's time
(2:16.11) in that event is a new national best and a
new WCAA record. Smith's previous season best
was 2:17.45.
"1 was pleased with my swimming, but 1 was es
pecially excited about the way the team pulled to
gether and supported each other," Smith said. "It
was rewarding to be able to swim a national-best
time unshaved and untapered. Hopefully that is an
indication that there are better things to come
during the NCAAs."
"Kathy's swimming was outstanding all
