# Hoopsters' comeback falls short at OU

### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
EUGENE, Ore. — When Coach Tom Davis puts
together next year's men's basketball team, talent
is one thing he'll have to find. But he won't have to
look far for character — he's already found that
this year.
Stanford once again proved in its 68-61 loss to
Oregon Saturday that there are many things on the
basketball court it doesn't do. It also proved that
quitting isn't one of them.
Stanford trailed the Ducks 37-20 with 15:39
remaining in the regionally televised game. Two
and-a-half minutes later, the Cardinal closed it to
to 39-32. With eight minutes to go, it was a five
point game. And with just under three minutes left,
Oregon's lead was down to three.
"We might make mistakes and be inefficient at
times out there, but character is one thing not lack
ing on this team," Davis said. "They just find a way
to climb back into the game.
"I've seen other teams get down and sometimes
come back," he continued, "but this team's been
doing it all season. This is the rule rather than the
exception."
Character, however, doesn't win games on its
own, and Saturday's contest was no exception. The
loss lowered Stanford's road record to 1-9, its
Pacific 10 Conference record to 3-13, and its over
all record to 11-15, assuring the Cardinal a losing
season.
And assuring Davis his first losing season in 14
years of head coaching.
"It really isn't a big thing," Davis said of his first

losing campaign. "I think I knew it could happen
when I took the job at Stanford.
"It was almost a miracle that we didn't have one
my first year here," he continued, referring to the
1982-83 season, when Stanford had to win its final
two games to finish 14-14. "So I've been resigned
to the fact that it could be a reality."
Though Davis has been saying all season long
that the near inevitability of his first losing season
did not bother him, it did bother his players.
"It was in all of our minds," said junior forward
Earl Koberlein, who led Stanford with 15 points
Saturday. "We started realizing that a few weeks
ago and seeing how many games we'd have to win.
That we didn't do it is just another disappointing
part of this season."
Perhaps the most disappointing part of the
season is Stanford's inability to play a full 40
minutes of basketball. Stanford played about 30
against the Ducks, who improved to 15-14 overall
and 8-8 in the Pac-10.
With 8,178 fans rocking McArthur Court — a
scaled-down version of the Boston Garden —
Oregon hit six of its first eight shots en route to a
14-4 lead five minutes into the game. In the same
span, Stanford was 2-for-6 from the floor and had
three turnovers and no rebounds.
A television timeout settled Stanford down, but
the Cardinal still couldn't get closer than eight
points and trailed 30-18 at the end of the half, its
poorest of the season offensively.
"Oregon played an excellent first half," Davis
said, noting that the Ducks shot 65 percent from
the floor to Stanford's 37 percent. "They got the

ball down low to (7-foot center) Blair Rasmussen
and then hit some outside jumpers as well."
The beginning of the second half was just a
replay of the beginning of the first. Oregon hit 3-
of-4 shots and Stanford made l-of-5. Oregon had
five rebounds and Stanford had none. And with
15:39 remaining, Oregon had a 17-point lead, 37-
20.
Then the Ducks, well, almost drowned.
Stanford scored seven straight points and 12 of
the next 14. And, thanks to two three-point plays,
it took all of 2:44 for Stanford to narrow it to 39-32
and cancel the impending rout.
Oregon Coach Don Monson, who at this point
was tugging at what hair he has left on his head,
called a timeout to regroup his beleaguered troops
and figure out a way to break, as he called it, Stan
ford's "torrid press."
"It's so typical now that when you get a lead, it's
harder to protect and maintain," Monson said after
the game. "Give Stanford credit for their hustle
and determination to come back."
Stanford didn't end its comeback at 39-32. After
Rasmussen, who led all scorers with 23 points, sank
a pair of free throws, Stanford's John Williams
drove left and scored on a lean-in 10-footer.
Oregon then turned the ball over against the
"torrid press," Williams hit a 19-footer from the
left side, and it was 41-36.
Williams, playing for the first time since a stress
fracture sidelined him in December, had a chance
moments later to cut it to three, but lost the ball on
