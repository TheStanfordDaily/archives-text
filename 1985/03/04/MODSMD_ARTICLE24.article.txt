# Hoopsters lose two

### PABLO MORALES Staff sportswriter 
You're a coach. Your team is strug
gling. With consecutive games against
two of the best teams in the confer
ence and probably the nation, things
are looking awfully bleak.
What do you tell your players?
If you're Dotty McCrea, coach of
the Stanford women's basketball
team, you preach improvement,
regardless of the level of opposition
or the final outcome.
"I tell them not to waste a single
game-time minute," said McCrea.

"Against any opponent, every minute
provides an individual with a chance
to perfect some part of her game."
This weekend, as expected, the
Cardinal fell to two good teams —
UCLA, 75-61, and Long Beach
State, 79-61. However, based on
McCrea's criterion, the Cardinal was
successful.
UCLA came into Saturday night's
game red hot after demolishing San
Diego State — a top-20 team — last
week, but the Cardinal showed from
the outset that it wasn't going to roll
over to the women from Westwood.

Feisty guard Charli Turner led an
inspired Cardinal onslaught with
some brilliant outside shooting,
burying her last four attempts of the
half.
A Turner three-point play gave the
Cardinal a 29-26 lead with 2:02 left
in the half, but two fast-break baskets
by guard Jaime Brown and forward
Jackie Joyner helped the Bruins cling
to a 30-29 lead at the intermission.
Leading 48-47 with 10:09 left to
play, the Bruins adjusted their defen
sive scheme by pressuring guards Vir
ginia Sourlis and Turner. The plan
worked. Under pressure, the Stan
ford guards were unable to find their
open teammates cutting to the posts.
Turnovers followed. So did a few
more Joyner baskets. Five minutes
later, the Bruins had the game well in
hand, leading 64-51. It would have
been easy for the Cardinal to chalk
this one up as a great effort, but
McCrea wasn't satisfied.
"Normally, you would be happy
(about the final outcome)," she said.
"But you should never be satisfied,
especially when we were so close. We
shouldn't have let them get away like
that."
Joyner finished with 14 points, as
did Brown and Anne Dean. Sourlis led
Stanford with 18 points, followed by
Turner's 15. In her final home game
for the Cardinal, senior forward Mary
Bradach tossed in 11 points.
Long Beach settled the game with
Stanford rather early, shooting a blis
tering 22-of-33 from the field on the
way to a 44-28 halftime lead. The
49ers controlled every facet of the
game the way you might expect the
fourth-best team in the nation to do.
In short, they made it look easy.
A good deal of the second half
pitted the second units of both teams,
and although they were in there to
gain game experience, the intensity
never diminished.

Senior forward Mary Bradach scored six points and grabbed four
rebounds in Stanford's 75-61 loss to UCLA Saturday night at Maples
Pavilion. It was Bradach's last game at Maples as the Cardinal ended
its home schedule.
