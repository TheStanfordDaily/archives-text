Entering the tournament as the
No. 1-seeded team and defending
champion, the Stanford women's
fencing team successfully defended
last year's title by defeating San
Jose State 9-7 in the Western
Regional final at Cal Tech this
weekend.
Placed in one of two four-team
pools, the Cardinal responded by
sweeping past all three of its oppo
nents. In its first match, Stanford
recorded a 16-0 shutout against
host Cal Tech. The Cardinal fol
lowed by defeating rival San Jose
State 12-4, then finished with a

close 9-7 victory over Fullerton
State.
Both the Cardinal and San Jose
State moved on to the final four,
where the loser of each match was
eliminated. Stanford came away
with a 9-3 decision over Long
Beach State, and the Spartans
ousted Air Force.
In a close match, Stanford
captured its second consecutive
championship. According to Coach
Buzz Hurst, "the star of the show"
was Karen Kwong, who won the
deciding bout and finished the
tournament with 13-5 record. Last
year, Kwong was the women's fen
cing team manager, Hurst said.

Hurst was pleased with the per
formance and the generated mo
mentum going into the NCAAs.
"I'm very encouraged with the way
the team pulled together — we're
on a roll right now," he said.
In the individual competition, the
Cardinal's Jennifer Yu and Holly
Tailor both qualified for the
NCAAs by virtue of their
respective first and third placings.
Yu and Tailor will be two of the 24
competitors at the nationals.
Yu's first-place finish marks the
first time in the last 10 years that a
women's fencer has recorded con
secutive championships.
