### CAROLYN TARKINGTON Staff sportswriter 
It was a successful weekend in Southern California for
both the men's and women's gymnastics teams. The Card
inal men set a new team record in their second-place
finish in Saturday's four-way competition at UCLA, and
the women's team met six teams over the weekend and
took five victories to end the dual-meet season with a 15-
6 record.
Junior Jon Levy and sophomore Randy Besosa had es
pecially outstanding individual performances, leading the
Cardinal men to a 280.70 team record, more than three
points higher than the record set earlier in the season.
"We were hoping to score around 280.00 and accom
plished that," Coach Sadao Hamada said. "This will put
us in a very good position for NCAA qualification, espe
cially if we can score like this in our next two meets."
Leading the competition was UCLA, with a score of
285.70 points. Following Stanford were Fullerton State,
with 279.10, and California, with 277.45.
Both Levy and Besosa set personal records in the all

around. Besosa totaled 56.90 points for a fifth-place finish
in the all-around, and Levy totaled 57.40 points for a
second-place finish.
In the individual events, Levy took second place on
floor with a 9.55 and tied Besosa for second place on
pommel horse with a 9.55.
"I was pleased with my performance but think there is
room for improvement," Levy said. "Scoring our highest
as a team made me happier than scoring my own personal
best. My main concern is that we qualify to nationals as a
team."
The Cardinal women scored 180.90 points Friday night
to fourth-ranked Fullerton's 186.40. USC totaled 175.95
and Nebraska scored 174.10 points.
In Saturday evening's competition, Stanford won with a
176.70 total ahead of San Diego State, Utah State and
Long Beach. The top all-arounders were Stanford's
Merilyn Chapman and Beth Pope. Sardina said that he
was also pleased with performances by Vicky Worden and
Lisa Weinstock.
