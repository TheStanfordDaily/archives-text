TEMPE, Ariz. — Stanford Wrestling
Coach ( hris Horpel put it best in commenting
on his team's showing yesterday in the Pacific
10 Conference Championships here.
"All in all it was a great performance," he
said.
It was a day of firsts for Stanford. For the
first time in 21 years the Cardinal had two
Pac-10 individual champions, and the team
placed third in the team standings with 58.5
points.
Host Arizona State easily won the team
crown with 114.75 points, as the Sun Devils
had nine of their 10 wrestlers in the finals.
The first conference champion for Stanford
in two years was Jeff Bradley at 134 pounds.
Bradley first had an overtime battle in the
semifinals against Ted Parker of Washington
State. After regulation the score was tied 5-5.
In the first period of overtime, Bradley fell
behind 2-0, but managed to tie the score at 3-

3 at the end of the period. Ten seconds into
the second period, Bradley scored a reversal
for a 5-3 lead, and in the final period Parker
only managed an escape, which gave Bradley
a 5-4 victory.
In the finals, Bradley defeated Oregon
State's Cliff Berger 6-5. The match did not
look good for Bradley — after two-and-a-half
periods Berger held a 4-2 lead.
With 30 seconds remaining in the match,
Bradley scored a takedown for the tie, and 15
seconds later scored a two-point near-fall.
Dave Lee (167) captured Stanford's other
individual crown. In his first match, he
defeated the Ducks' Pat Gibson 5-2.
In the finals, he edged the Sun Devils' Jim
Gressley, 7-6.
Lee led 6-3 into the third period aftei Gres
sley let him escape to try to score a takedown.
Lee was then penalized for stalling — for the
third time — narrowing the score to 6-4. With
the crowd yelling for a takedown, Lee again
backed up and was called for stalling —

penalized two points this time to tie the
match.
In order to avoid his fifth stallling call and
disqualification, Lee began to go on the offen
sive and run out the clock. He won the match
by virtue of the one-point riding-time advan
tage.
Scott Wiggen (142) came as close as
anyone could get to winning in his overtime
defeat for first place to ASU's Adam Cohen.
At the end of two periods, Wiggen led 3-1,
but he was called for stalling, which narrowed
the score to 3-2. With 15 seconds left in
regulation, Cohen scored an escape to tie the
score at 3-3.
In the first overtime period, Wiggen ap
peared to score a takedown, but the referee
ruled that the pair was off the mat. At the end
of overtime the score remained tied 0-0.
Cohen was awarded the victory on the basis of
criteria, as Wiggen was cautioned for stalling
in the overtime, the seventh criterion on the
list.
