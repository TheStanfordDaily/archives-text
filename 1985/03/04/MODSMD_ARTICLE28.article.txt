### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
Stanford Women's Tennis Coach
Frank Brennan thought yesterday's
match at San Diego State would be
the long, close contest his team
usually has with the Aztecs. So he
booked the team on a 10:30 p.m.
flight home.
"Well, we were slam, bam, thank
you ma'am, and we caught a 6:40
flight," Brennan said of the Card
inal's 7-2 victory over San Diego
State. With Stanford's 8-1 victory
over Fullerton State Saturday, that
makes it 10-0 this season and 36 in
a row.

"That was a really nice surprise,"
Brennan said of the ease with which
Stanford whipped the ninth-ranked
Aztecs. "We won the first set in
every match, so things went really
well right from the start."
Stanford clinched the match
early by winning the first five
singles, four of them in straight sets.
The Cardinal was as dominant at
No. 1 and No. 2 doubles, winning
those in straight sets as well.
At No. 1 doubles, Leigh Anne
Eldredge and Linda Gates beat San
Diego State's Linda Howell and
Cynthia MacGregor, the nation's
third-ranked doubles team, 7-6, 6-

2. And at No. 2, Patty Fendick and
Anna Ivan blasted the Aztec pair of
Cathy Berry and Anne Moeller, 6-
2, 6-4. The only losses came at No.
6 singles, where freshman Kay
Tittle fell in three sets, and at No. 3
doubles, where Cari Hagey and
Alyce Werdel lost in two.
On a very windy day at Fullerton
State, the only losers were, surpris
ingly, Gates and Eldredge in
doubles. "In doubles, you have the
capacity to be doubly good or bad,"
Brennan said. "When you're off
and your partner's the same, it's
awful. But luckily, it was not an im
portant match."
