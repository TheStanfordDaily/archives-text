## Grabb, Letts win title 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
Stanford Men's Tennis Coach Dick Gould has some
thinking to do after his doubles team of Jim Grabb and
John Letts defeated teammates Pat McEnroe and Derrick
Rostagno in the finals of the 96th Annual Pacific Coast
Doubles Tournament in La Jolla yesterday.
To have two Stanford teams in the finals of such a pres
tigious event was a good sign for Gould's No. 1-ranked
scjuad. Gould is now left with the task of best organizing
Stanford's doubles players.
His main concern is in finding three strong doubles
teams instead of one "great" team and two mediocre
ones. Whether or not that means breaking up a pair like
Grabb and Letts, 5-0 in dual-match competition and 14-2
overall, is yet to be decided.
Gould was especially pleased to see McEnroe and Ros
tagno, the No. 7 seeds, get into the finals.
"They haven't played together too much. Winning the
NorCals (Northern California Intercollegiates) and

having two teams in the finals here should give us more
confidence as a team," Gould said. McEnroe and Ros
tagno won the NorCals a week ago with a 6-4, 6-4 victory
over Fresno State's Bill Wakefield and Paul Royhal.
The competition in La Jolla was tougher, though. To
reach the finals, McEnroe and Rostagno had to beat
UCLA's top doubles team of Ken Diller and Mark Bas
ham. Diller and Basham eliminated the third Stanford
team in the tournament, Dan Goldie and Eric Rosenfeld,
6-0, 6-3, but McEnroe and Rostagno avenged their
teammates' loss with a 6-3, 6-4 win.
McEnroe said he and Rostagno reached the finals
playing their "good all-around game." They played
equally well in the finals in front of 150 spectators at the
La Jolla Beach and Tennis Club.
The finals were characterized by intense net play,
smashes and a total of five aces. The score was tied 5-5 in
the second set before McEnroe's service was broken at 6-
5 to give Grabb and Letts, seeded No. 2, the tournament
title.
