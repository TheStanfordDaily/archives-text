### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Staff writer 
Jospeh Pisano, the fraternity affairs co
ordinator at Washington University in St.
Louis, will become Stanford's fraternal af
fairs adviser in June, Director of the Row
Diana Conklin announced Friday.
"The time is right for a new approach,"
Pisano said this weekend in a telephone in
terview from St. Louis.
Although the exact duties associated
with the new position are not clear, Pisano
said there are many similarities between
his new job and his current position at
Washington University.
In his post at Washington University,
Pisano is an adviser to undergraduate fra
ternity men on house/chapter operations,
management and finances. "My position
here encompasses what Diana (Conklin)
does and what a Stanford fraternal affairs
adviser will do," he said.
At Washington University, Pisano also
advises the Interfraternity Council (IFC)
and all campus fraternity chapters on edu
cational, social and service programs as

well as administering discipline in conjunc
tion with other school officials.
Fraternity members here appear opti
mistic about Pisano's appointment.
"I'm incredibly excited. He left an in
credible impression" when he visited here,
said Stanford IFC President Rick Hoskins.
"I'm sorry I'm not going to be here next
year to work with him. He'll be an in
credible asset to the fraternity system."
After meeting Pisano, former Phi Delt
President Ed Bendy called him a "nice
guy"
"I think he'll do a good job," Bendy
said. "He might be a little too gung-ho, but
once he comes here he'll settle down."
Bendy explained that his reservations
stemmed from Pisano's background. "I
think (Stanford) fraternities like to main
tain a low profile," he said. "I hope he
doesn't want to increase our exposure with
'Greek Weeks' and other events. I'm
afraid he might also bring bureaucratic
nonsense with his educational and admin
istrative backround."

However, Sigma Alpha Epsilon Presi
dent Jerry Morgan called Pisano his "top
choice."
"I was very impressed with him," Mor
gan said. "He was very knowledgeable
about fraternities in general. As a person,
he was a very good listener and grasped
problems and issues very quickly. I think
he'll do a very good job."
Pisano said that he was hired at Wash
ington University to solve the same types
of problems that exist at Stanford.
"1 think the frats at Washington Univer
sity suffered from 'benign neglect' from
the administration," he said. "Like Stan
ford, there wasn't a position to help with
this problem. There was no structure, no
administrational support.
"Largely what I did was to institution
alize programs that turned out to be very
successful. I was making up the job
description as I went along."
Pisano's first task at Washington Uni
versity was to solve the housing dilemma
among the fraternities. Twenty-eight per
cent of Washington University students

ure members of fraternities. Pisano said.
He explained that soon after he set out
to solve the problem, eight of the 10
housed fraternities were renovated and
two were constructed to improve the
housing situation.
According to Pisano, his experience at
Washington University will be good train
ing for his job here because it forced him
"to quickly learn how to work with a lot of
different people."
Pisano admitted that his job will be chal
lenging and that he had much to learn
about the Stanford fraternity system.
"Fraternal organizations at Stanford are
very complex," he said. "I can't say I'm
familiar with all of the problems right
now."
Pisano has been involved with fraternities
since his own undergraduate days at the
University of Rochester. The 1982 cum
laude graduate was president of
Rochester's Theta Delta Chi chapter.
He went on to work as adviser-in
residence to UCLA's Theta Delta Chi
chapter before taking his current position.
