# Softball 1-2 on weekend
## 
### DAVE DUTCHER Senior sportswriter 
What started out as a potentially great weekend Friday
turned sour Saturday for the Stanford softball team.
I he Cardinal's pitching, hitting and defense came to
gether at San Jose City College Friday, and the result was
a 3-0 victory. Stanford's triumph was highlighted by a
one-hit, two-walk performance by sophomore
right-hander Lisa Buchanan. The Cardinal, 6-13, lost two
at home to the Jaguars two weeks ago.
On Saturday, however, Stanford played well 12 of 14
innings but lost a double-header to Nevada-Reno, 6-4
and 9-4. at Roble Field. In the two subpar innings, the
Cardinal's defensive play was one facet of its game that
differed between Friday and Saturday.
"We played flawless defense (against San Jose City),"
Stanford Coach Kathy Lincoln said. "It was our first no
error game and our first shutout."
Buchanan said, "We just weren't making mistakes, and
when you don't make mistakes you don't lose."
Defense, again, was on Lincoln's mind after the double
header loss Saturday. "Errors are contagious. They are
lor everyone. They just tend to multiply, and it tends to
happen to us in one inning." Stanford had three errors in
the first game and four in the second.

In the first game against Nevada-Reno, the bad inning
for the Cardinal was the Wolfpack's five-run sixth.
The Cardinal scored one in the sixth. In the bottom of
the seventh, it scored three on consecutive singles by Mar
garet Pezzini, Monique Bautista and Anna Sanchez, a
flyout and a three-run homer by Cathy Taft, one of two
Stanford seniors.
Two innings into the second game, the Cardinal again
gave up a five-run inning, which erased a 3-1 lead Stan
ford had taken in the first.
The first inning seemed to be the last for Wolfpack
pitcher Beth Pierpoint, who had given up eight hits en
route to the first-game victory. But Pierpoint settled, and
Stanford managed only one hit — a third-inning double
by Fiscalini — until the sixth inning. The Cardinal got its
final run then when Bautista singled, went to second on an
error and scored on Taft's double, Stanford's sixth and
final hit of the second game.
"She (Pierpoint) was slower in the second game, and we
had to get used to it," said Bautista, who suggested that
the Cardinal hitters might have lacked concentration
during the second game. Lincoln disagreed.
"Against San Jose City it happened to us — the pitcher
was slow, but we were trying to kill the ball," Lincoln said.
"We had line drives, but they were hit right at people."
