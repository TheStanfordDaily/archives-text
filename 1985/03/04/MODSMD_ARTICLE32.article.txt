The sixth-ranked Stanford men's
volleyball team had little trouble
dispensing with St. Mary's at
Moraga Friday, 15-8, 15-4, 15-10.
The Cardinal approached the
match with two goals in mind: first,
to warm up for Wednesday's con
test with Pepperdine, the country's
top-ranked team, and second, to
help the cause of volleyball in
Northern California.
As for helping to popularize vol
leyball, team captain Craig Lauch
ner said, "A goal of the Stanford
program is to help the programs at
other schools."
St. Mary's elevated volleyball to
varsity status this year and, as an in
dependent without a league, has
been looking for serious competi

tion. By giving the Gaels a match
with the country's sixth-ranked
team, the schedulers hoped to give
the fledgling program some
legitimacy.
Stanford's altruism ended,
though, when the teams walked on
the court."It was a quick match
and not too exciting," Lauchner
said. "We got the job done.
"We didn't play inspired volley
ball â€” we were sort of silent. Con
centration should be expected each
match. But you can't expect a stel
lar performance against a team like
St. Mary's."
Stanford Co-coach Don Shaw
had earlier expressed dismay that
his team sometimes played down to
the level of lesser opponents.
Stanford, now 18-4 overall and

in third place in the California In
tercollegiate Volleyball Association
with a 6-3 mark, will take a six
game winning streak into its show
down with league-leader Pep
perdine. The Waves sport a 7-0
record in the CIVA, a half game
better than second-place UCLA
(7-1). At the moment USC (5-1) is
secure in the third spot.
Because the top five teams in the
CIVA are traditionally awarded
post-season tournament bids,
fourth-place Stanford can, for the
first time in its history, rightfully
discuss playoff prospects.
Before this year the Cardinal
men had never posted a winning
season. With only 10 games
remaining on its slate, that mile
stone will be passed.
