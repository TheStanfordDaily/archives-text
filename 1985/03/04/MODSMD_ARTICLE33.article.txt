## McGonigle 3rd at tourney 
### KEN STEVENS Staff sportswriter 
Freshman Trish McGonigle's third-place finish in indi
vidual competition was the bright spot in an otherwise dis
appointing weekend for the Stanford women golfers rs
they finished in ninth place at the Patty Sheehan Invita
tional at Fort Ord and Pebble Beach.
The Cardinal's three-day team total of 964 was a dis
tant 42 shots behind tournament champion Tulsa, which
thoroughly dominated a strong field throughout the
weekend, finishing at 922. UCLA captured second place
at 946 and U.S. International finished in third at 952.
According to Stanford freshman Stephanie Kondik, the
Cardinal continues to be hurt by a lack of experience.
"The main problem with our team is that we're playing
three freshmen, and we all have experience in junior golf,
but college golf is so much different," she said.
McGonigle, however, seemed undaunted by any lack of
experience this weekend as she tied for third place. Her

three-day total of 230 was just four shots back of tourna
ment champion Jody Rosenthal of Tulsa. Rosenthal is the
reigning British Amateur Champion and a member of that
country's Walker Cup team.
Other Stanford finishes included sophomore Kathleen
McCarthy at 240, junior Julie Carmichael and freshman
Kay Cornelius at 249, and Kondik at 255.
McGonigle attributed her success both to her ability to
consistently hit the greens and to a change in her mental
approach. "1 felt like my attitude was a lot better," she
said. "I was playing with a lot more confidence."
Despite her good performance this weekend,
McGonigle agrees with Kondik that part of the Cardinal's
recent struggles has been due to the inexperience. "It
makes a big difference," she said, noting that playing
against juniors and seniors can be intimidating.
McGonigle said that the team has the talent to win but
needs to be patient. "I think it's going to take a little
while," she said. "We're kind of going downhill now."
