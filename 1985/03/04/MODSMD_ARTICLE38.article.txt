## Zschau speaks on current issues 
### MARK WILSON 
U.S. intentions toward Central America
dominated the discussion during a town
meeting held in Saratoga by Congressman
Ed Zschau Saturday afternoon. The
meeting, one of two held over the weekend,
took place at Saratoga High School.
At the town meeting, Zschau, a Republi
can beginning his second term in the House
of Representatives, restated his opposition
to funding the Nicaraguan contras in their
effort to overthrow the Sandinista govern
ment.
The 12th-district congressman also of
fered his belief that chances of Congress ap
proving a bill to supply the contras with $14
million in military aid are slim.
Though convinced that a negotiated
settlement to problems in Nicaragua is
preferable to a military resolution, Zschau
gave no endorsement to the Contadora
process. He also did not endorse the recent
efforts at conciliation offered by Nicaraguan
President Daniel Ortega.
Zschau did say he would welcome an op

portunity for an unrestricted tour of
Nicaragua.
During the hour-and-a-half meeting,
Zschau addressed a wide range of political
issues of recent concern, including:
• Defense and arms control. Zschau reaf
firmed his campaign pose against the MX
missile system. He said arms negotiations
with the Soviet Union should not be made
conditional to human-rights reforms, to So
viet presence in Afghanistan or to any other
issue.
• Farm debt and tobacco subsidies.
He said he sees the current plight of small
farmers in America as an inevitable conse
quence of faulty subsidy planning on the
part of the government. In addition, he
blames farmers for poor investment judg
ment. Although he is discouraged by the
government's long history of subsidies for
the tobacco industry, Zschau said budget
cuts would correct the situation.
• Tax reform. He stated no preference for
any of the tax-simplification plans now cir
culating through Congress, but he did ex

press his support for the idea in general.
• Media bias. When asked what he felt
was a citizen's best recourse to a
predominantly liberal/socialist news media,
Zschau suggested the First Amendment's
guarantee of a free press.
The meeting did have its entertaining mo
ments. Laughter and lively discussion were
prompted by the frustrations of a con
stituent whose 10-year-old son had been
amassing charges on the parent's telephone
bill by dialing a pornographic message ser
vice in San Francisco.
The woman's efforts at finding someone
responsible for regulating the service led her
from the City of San Francisco, through the
regional telephone company and the
Federal Communications Commission and
finally to her representative, Zschau.
After a brief discussion of the case's
details and a few remarks from other mem
bers of the assembly on the general state of
society's moral fabric, Zschau said jokingly,
"I never thought I'd be running an X-rated
town meeting."
