# GSL cuts may help push public service

The proposed Guaranteed Student
Loan (GSL) cuts may have some pos
itive impact on the Stanford Law
School, according to its dean, John
Ely.
Rather than rely on GSLs, Ely is
encouraging students to take part in
recently developed low-interest loan
programs which charge below-market
interest rates to students taking sum
mer or post-graduate jobs in public
interest or charity-law work.
Currently, between 94 and 97 per
cent of the law school's graduates go
into practice with large law firms
rather tnun entering public-interest
law or working for government
agencies.
According to Ely, there are two
primary reasons for this high
percentage. One is the financial pres
sure on law students to find summer
jobs in the larger law firms, whose
high pay scales help students finance
their schooling. Large loan debts
upon graduation also create a finan
cial disincentive for students to enter
public-interest work.
To lure a higher percentage of stu
dents away from corporate law. the
law school is offering low-interest
loan programs.
At this time, 65 percent of the stu
dents receive some form of financial
assistance. Of these recipients,
around 33 percent are on scholar
ships, the average receiving slightly
more than $5,000.
Under the Montgomery Public In
terest Loan Program, instituted two
summers ago, students do summer
work for a government agency or

charity. In return, the law school
lends money to them below the mar
ket rate. If the student continues in
the same area of work after gradua
tion, the school will excuse the loan,
said Assoc. Dean Thomas Mcßride.
Ely said at least 75 percent of the
20 such loans made available each
summer are used.
According to Mcßride, the law
school also offers a forgiveness pro
gram. the Public Interest Low Income
Protection Program, which alleviates
the debts of graduates who go into
public-interest or government work.
Mcßride explained that the Uni
versity provides low-interest loans to
the students to pay off government
loans. If the graduate continues in the
public-interest or government law
fields for over three years, these loans
will be forgiven.
However, few students take advan
tage of this program, Ely said.
Currently, students "rationalize"
their decisions to enter corporate law
by blaming the University, Ely said.
They say the University forces them
into their decisions through course
emphasis and faculty dedication to
the teaching of corporate law.
Mcßride noted that another way
the law school is attempting to lessen
some of the potential financial prob
lems caused by the Reagan adminis
tration's proposed budget cuts is
through a scholarship fund drive. The
law school is encouraging donors to
give money not only for scholarships,
but for loans as well.
This would increase the school's
flexibility, which is dependent on
federal aid, he said.
