# Phi Delt probation terminated
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
Dean of Residential Education Norm Robinson ac
cepted an lnterfraternity Council (IFC) recommendation
to lift the probation of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity
Friday, ending a five-week suspension of the fraternity's
party privileges.
The fraternity had been on probation since Jan. 25,
when Robinson alleged that Phi Delt members pressured
pledges "to drink large amounts of alcohol in a short time
span" during the first week of winter quarter.
According to Director of the Row Diana Conklin, Rob
inson was satisfied the Phi Delts "had come up with a
means to ensure it (such a drinking incident) wouid not
occur again." Robinson was in San Diego over the
weekend and could not be reached for comment.
Phi Delt President Andy Cohen said he was "really
pleased" by Robinson's decision, although he questioned
the initial implementation of the probation.
Cohen said the fraternity took a number of positive
steps while on probation. One of those steps was the crea
tion of a set of guidelines by outgoing Phi Delt President
Ed Bendy to prevent similar events that could raise con
cern with Res Ed. Cohen said copies of Bendy's proposals
were sent to Robinson, Conklin and IFC President Rick
Hoskins.
Bendy said he would "rather not comment" on the
guidelines, although Cohen said that one of the points
called for a meeting between the fraternity president,
pledge trainers and pledges in which the pledges would be
advised of their rights on alcohol consumption.
Cohen said the proposals also called for more emphasis
on pledge involvement in community-service projects.
Cohen yesterday called the probation "a wrong that
was waiting to be righted," adding that the fraternity con
sidered the event in question to be a drinking game rather
than an instance of hazing. "We didn't look at it as hazing
from the beginning," Cohen said.
An IFC report on the incident agreed with Cohen's
view, stating that "the participants understood that the
event was voluntary, and some did not partake. Others
drank shots of water. Food and non-alcoholic beverages
were provided, and several Phi Delts remained to monitor
the event."
During the probation, the Phi Delts were prohibited
from having any parties or holding any social gatherings,
although Res Ed granted the fraternity permission for a
non-alcoholic party featuring milkshakes.
The IFC recommendation noted the fraternity had
taken positive steps during the five-week period. Hoskins
told The Daily last week that the fraternity members have
"shown themselves to be incredibly responsive and re
sponsible. That's our main reason for recommending that
they be taken off probation."
Conklin said she was "quite satisfied" with the behavior
of the fraternity during the probation.
