Major earthquake strikes Chile
SANTIAGO, Chile, — A strong earthquake struck the most pop
ulated part of Chile last night, leaving at least 83 people dead and more
than 1,200 injured and causing heavy damage, officials reported.
The capital, where 53 were known dead, was the worst hit, said auth
orities surveying damage this morning. But the quake also struck hard at
such cities as Valparaiso, Vina Del Mar, Rancagua and San Antonio in a
region which is home to three-quarters of the more than 11 million
Chilean population.
The center of the quake, which registered 8.0 on the 12-point Mercalli
scale of intensity, was reported in the Pacific Ocean, 25 miles off the
Chilean coast.
A first strong tremor at 7:48 p.m. was followed within three hours by
two others, then do/ens of aftershocks. Electricity failed in many cities
and firemen fought blazes in blacked-out blocks.
During the night, electricity was gradually restored in the capital,
where police reported a number of arrests of looters who moved into
residential districts where people had fled from their homes.
Official sources said a number of bridges and rail tunnels had been
destroyed. Radio monitors in Lima, Peru, heard broadcast appeals for
blood, plasma and tents for the homeless.
The quake was felt in Argentina, on the other side of the Andes
mountain chain, and shook a 1,000-mile stretch of Chile from Copiapo
in the north to Valdivia in the south.
The quake was the worst in 15 years in a country where earthquakes
have killed some 62,000 people since the turn of the century.
Gunman kills Catholic policeman
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — A lone gunman shot to death a
Roman Catholic police sergeant as he went to mass yesterday at Ennis
killen near the border jwith the Irish Republic, officials reported. He was
the 10th police officer killed by guerrillas in four days.
A police spokeswoman said Sgt. Hugh McCormac, 40, wqs shot as he
entered a monastery called St. Gabriel's Retreat with his wife and their
16-year-old daughter and 15-year-old son.
Witnesses said the killer opened fire with a pistol at point-blank range,
then fired several more bullets into the sergeant as he lay bleeding on the
ground beside his screaming family.
The gunman fled in a car driven by another man, the police spokes
woman said. Police sources said they believed the gunmen drove across
the border into the Irish Republic.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but police blamed
terrorists of the outlawed Irish Republican Army. It is fighting to drive
the British out of Northern Ireland, a British province with a Protestant
majority, and unite it with the predominantly Roman Catholic Irish
McCormac, a training officer at the Royal Ulster Constabulary's
academy in Enniskillen in County Fermanagh, was locking the door of
his car as he was shot, witnesses said.

stabulary officers who perished in an IRA mortar attack Thursday on a
border police base at Newry. Nine officers were killed in the attack.
Sudan will halt attacks on rebels
CAIRO, Egypt — President Gaafar Nimeiri of Sudan announced yes
terday that his troops were halting "offensive attacks" against rebels in
southern Sudan, Egypt's official Middle East News Agency reported.
Some Christians and non-Moslem tribesmen in the south took up
arms in 1983 after Nimeiri imposed Islamic law throughout the country
and reorganized the southern region administratively.
The Middle East News Agency reported that Nimeiri, in a speech yes
terday, said the unilateral cease-fire would show his government's good
intention, but if the rebels do not respond favorably, "we would act to
ensure security, peace, stability and preserve the unity of our country."
In a dispatch from Khartoum, the Sudanese capital, the news agency
quoted Nimeiri as saying he will form a high-level committee made up of
representatives from the south and the predominantly Moslem north to
help conduct negotiations for a peaceful settlement.
Vice President George Bush is scheduled to arrive in Khartoum today
to begin a three-nation tour of drought-stricken north-central Africa.
He is to meet with Nimeiri tomorrow and then visit Niger and Mali
before flying to Geneva, Switzerland, to address a U.N. conference on
the African famine on March 11.
Western diplomats in Khartoum believe the largest rebel group, the
Sudanese Peoples' Liberation Army, formed mainly by members of the
Dinka tribe, has about 10,000 to 15,000 fighters. They have been at
tacking Nile River steamers and staging hit-and-run attacks in the
provinces of Upper Nile, Equatoria and Bahr El-Ghazal.
French hostages in Ethiopia freed
PARIS — The five-man crew of a French air force plane flying relief
supplies in Ethiopia, held hostage at the town of Lalibela yesterday,
were released and flew their aircraft to the Ethiopian capital early this
morning, the French Foreign Ministry announced.
It said the French Embassy in the capital Addis Ababa reported the
crew arrived "during the night."
Earlier, French diplomatic sources in the Ethiopian capital of Addis
Ababa had said a "group of unidentified rebels" seized the crew minutes
after the plane landed yesterday morning at Lalibela, about 190 miles
north of Addis Ababa, and took them to an unknown location.
The French sources in Addis Ababa said the plane was carrying 8.5
tons of food to Wollo province, and it was surrounded by armed rebels
when it landed.
The Ministry said it had no information on four medical workers, two
French and two Belgian, who had flown into Lalibela with the Transall
transport.
An official of the embassy in Ethiopia, interviewed by telephone
today by a French radio station, said he understood the medical workers
"were free to move in Lalibela and were never taken hostage."
The official, identified by the station only as Mr. Farouk, said the
identities of the kidnappers were not known. He said it appeared to be
"a means to get publicity.^
The embassy had reported that all nine people on board the plane
were French.

Bonn, the West German capital, said he would go to Moscow and also
squeeze in a six-hour trip to Warsaw, Poland, between already sched
uled visits to Helsinki, Finland, and the Bulgarian capital, Sofia.
The last-minute additions to Genscher's itinerary reflected renewed
West German efforts to mend relations with the Soviet bloc damaged
recently by NATO deployment of medium-range nuclear missiles and by
bloc accusations that Bonn wants to recover German territory lost in
World War 11.
Diplomats in Moscow, who, like the Bonn sources, spoke on condition
they not be identified, said Genscher would meet Gromyko today, then
travel to Helsinki.
The talks will mark Gromyko's third meeting with a West European
foreign minister in a week. He returned Saturday from a trip to Spain
and Italy during which he reinforced Kremlin protests against U.S. plans
for a space-based missile defense.

Sudan will halt attacks on rebels
CAIRO, Egypt — President Gaafar Nimeiri of Sudan announced yes
terday that his troops were halting "offensive attacks" against rebels in
southern Sudan, Egypt's official Middle East News Agency reported.
Some Christians and non-Moslem tribesmen in the south took up
arms in 1983 after Nimeiri imposed Islamic law throughout the country
and reorganized the southern region administratively.
The Middle East News Agency reported that Nimeiri, in a speech yes
terday, said the unilateral cease-fire would show his government's good
intention, but if the rebels do not respond favorably, "we would act to
ensure security, peace, stability and preserve the unity of our country."
In a dispatch from Khartoum, the Sudanese capital, the news agency
quoted Nimeiri as saying he will form a high-level committee made up of
representatives from the south and the predominantly Moslem north to
help conduct negotiations for a peaceful settlement.
Vice President George Bush is scheduled to arrive in Khartoum today
to begin a three-nation tour of drought-stricken north-central Africa.
He is to meet with Nimeiri tomorrow and then visit Niger and Mali
before flying to Geneva, Switzerland, to address a U.N. conference on
the African famine on March 11.
Western diplomats in Khartoum believe the largest rebel group, the
Sudanese Peoples' Liberation Army, formed mainly by members of the
Dinka tribe, has about 10,000 to 15,000 fighters. They have been at
tacking Nile River steamers and staging hit-and-run attacks in the
provinces of Upper Nile, Equatoria and Bahr El-Ghazal.
French hostages in Ethiopia freed
PARIS — The five-man crew of a French air force plane flying relief
supplies in Ethiopia, held hostage at the town of Lalibela yesterday,

morning, the French Foreign Ministry announced.
It said the French Embassy in the capital Addis Ababa reported the

Earlier, French diplomatic sources in the Ethiopian capital of Addis
Ababa had said a "group of unidentified rebels" seized the crew minutes

north of Addis Ababa, and took them to an unknown location.
The French sources in Addis Ababa said the plane was carrying 8.5
tons of food to Wollo province, and it was surrounded by armed rebels
when it landed.
The Ministry said it had no information on four medical workers, two
French and two Belgian, who had flown into Lalibela with the Transall

The official, identified by the station only as Mr. Farouk, said the
identities of the kidnappers were not known. He said it appeared to be
"a means to get publicity.^
The embassy had reported that all nine people on board the plane
were French.

bloc accusations that Bonn wants to recover German territory lost in
World War 11.
Diplomats in Moscow, who, like the Bonn sources, spoke on condition

Major earthquake strikes Chile
SANTIAGO, Chile, — A strong earthquake struck the most pop
ulated part of Chile last night, leaving at least 83 people dead and more
than 1,200 injured and causing heavy damage, officials reported.
The capital, where 53 were known dead, was the worst hit, said auth
orities surveying damage this morning. But the quake also struck hard at
such cities as Valparaiso, Vina Del Mar, Rancagua and San Antonio in a
region which is home to three-quarters of the more than 11 million
Chilean population.
The center of the quake, which registered 8.0 on the 12-point Mercalli
scale of intensity, was reported in the Pacific Ocean, 25 miles off the
Chilean coast.
A first strong tremor at 7:48 p.m. was followed within three hours by
two others, then do/ens of aftershocks. Electricity failed in many cities
and firemen fought blazes in blacked-out blocks.
During the night, electricity was gradually restored in the capital,
where police reported a number of arrests of looters who moved into
residential districts where people had fled from their homes.
Official sources said a number of bridges and rail tunnels had been
destroyed. Radio monitors in Lima, Peru, heard broadcast appeals for
blood, plasma and tents for the homeless.
The quake was felt in Argentina, on the other side of the Andes
mountain chain, and shook a 1,000-mile stretch of Chile from Copiapo
in the north to Valdivia in the south.
The quake was the worst in 15 years in a country where earthquakes
have killed some 62,000 people since the turn of the century.
