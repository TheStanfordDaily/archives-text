# Israel approves further pullout
## 
### 
JERUSALEM — The Israeli Cabinet voted
unanimously yesterday to approve the second stage
of Israel's planned three-stage withdrawal from
southern Lebanon and ordered the Israeli army to
begin the pullout immediately.
The second stage in the withdrawal plan that was
authorized yesterday calls for the Israeli army to
evacuate positions in eastern Lebanon and to pull
back to a line that runs just north of the town of
Hasbayyah. The first stage of the withdrawal, in
which Israeli troops left the Lebanese port city of
Sidon and the surrounding area in the west, was ac
complished on Feb. 16.
The first-stage pullback was followed by an esca
lation in the attacks on Israeli soldiers by Lebanese
Moslem Shiite guerrillas in the area still occupied
by Israel. The Israeli army responded to the attacks
with a severe crackdown, during which a number of
people have been killed, villages have been
searched and houses destroyed, and dozens of per
sons arrested.
These initial first- and second-stage pullbacks
will still leave the Israeli army well north of the
border, posing no immediate threat to northern Is
rael. Thus, the second-stage vote was neither as

risky nor as controversial as will be a decision to
complete the withdrawal plan.
Nevertheless, yesterday's unanimous Cabinet
vote was evidence of the strong sentiment in Israel
to complete the withdrawal as soon as possible. The
only indication of continuing opposition came from
two former Likud defense ministers — Ariel
Sharon, now the minister of industry and trade, and
Moshe Arens, now a minister without portfolio —
who did not vote on the issue, according to a senior
government official.
Sharon, however, told an audience in Jerusalem
last night that he had voted for the second stage of
the withdrawal plan. There was no immediate ex
planation for the differing versions of his vote.
The decision was supported by Foreign Minister
Yitzhak Shamir, the leader of the right-wing Likud
bloc in the national unity government here, who
said he reversed his earlier vote opposing the
withdrawal plan because there was "no use in
making proposals without any chance of getting
them through the Cabinet."
But Shamir stressed that he still had doubts
about the wisdom of the timing of the withdrawal
and indicated that he was reserving judgment on

supporting the final stage of withdrawal to the in
ternational border until he learns how the army
proposes to protect civilians living in northern Is
rael from terrorist attacks.
"I hope the army will find an answer to this
before we reach the international border, Shamir
said. "We still have a few months."
Shamir, a senior member of the Likud govern
ment that approved the invasion of Lebanon in
1982 and that did not draw up its own withdrawal
plan, had joined five other Likud members of the
Cabinet in voting against the withdrawal plan pre
sented on Jan. 14. Sixteen ministers voted for the
three-stage plan.
The Cabinet set no date for completion of the
second stage pullback, but the tentative target has
been around April. A senior official told reporters
that the army "has a free hand" in executing the
withdrawal, which will be affected by such factors
as the weather in the mountains of eastern
Lebanon that are now covered with snow.
"The pace depends on the army," the official
said. "It does not depend on politics." The official
added that Israel "will make no attempt to coor
dinate" this portion of its withdrawal plan with the
Lebanese.
