# Coal miners end British strike
## 
### 
LONDON — Britain's longest and
most violent strrke ended here yester
day, when coal miners' delegates
voted 98-91 to return to work tomor
row despite having failed to reach a
settlement with the state-run Na
tional Coal Board.
The vote to end the year-long
strike went against the recommen
dations of the executive committee of
the 186,000-member National Union
of Mineworkers and its fiery leader,
Arthur Scargill, who has been the
strikers' driving force.
But the delegates voting
represented the entire membership
and the result is likely to be viewed as
a victory for the Conservative gov
ernment of Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher. She expressed
"overwhelming relief" with the
result, saying, "We had to make sure
that violence and intimidation and
impossible demands could not win."
The delegates have not ruled out
local regions fighting against coal pit

closures and job losses — the issues
of the strike — by other means. Scar
gill warned not to underestimate the
union's ability to take further action.
Some militant officials have talked
about "guerrilla-type warfare" in the
pits and work-to-rule slowdown
schemes. But coal board officials said
they did not think this would happen
and that talks on retroactive wage in
creases would not begin until the
mines were working normally again.
Coal board spokesman Michael
Eaton welcomed the vote but said he
would have preferred that it end with
an agreement, and he did not
welcome Scargill's assertion that the
battle would go on by other means.
He said he believed most miners "are
frankly fed up with being in battle.
They would like to return to work
and lead a normal life and I don't
think they will welcome the state
ments of Mr. Scargill."
The strike has produced extraordi
nary hardships for the miners and

their families. The union provides no
strike pay, so a year's salary, about
$9,000, has been lost in strikers'
families, of which virtually all are
deeply in debt.
The strike was provoked by the
coal board's plan to close the 20 of
Britain's 174 coal pits that were
losing substantial sums of money. The
resultant loss of 20,000 jobs would
come mostly through retirements, the
coal board said.
As the strike evolved, however, the
key issue became the board's broader
general proposal to close what it con
sidered to be "uneconomic pits."
Money-losing pits had been closed
during all previous governments as
Britain's markets for coal dwindled.
But Scargill maintained that pits
should close only when they were ex
hausted of coal or unsafe.
The strike, which began in most
areas on March 12, 1984, has cost at
least $1.6 billion, according to the
government. But other economists

put the figure at about $3 billion, in
cluding imported oil and coal, police
costs and lost revenues.
Police have estimated that about
1,700 miners and police were injured,
and at least one death has been at
tributed to the strike.
Although there were no power
shortages or inconveniences to the
vast majority of the British public, the
strike dominated a year of politics
here. It served as a backdrop to other
disputes and as a focus of attention on
the record 13.9 percent unemploy
ment and rich-poor, south-north divi
sions in this country. It exposed
Britons to an almost nightly dose of
TV violence as pickets and police
clashed in scenes that unnerved the
population.
Many observers say that with the
strike over, attention will turn to
other issues, which could spell trouble
for Thatcher, who has not reduced
unemployment and has made little
progress on reviving the economy.
