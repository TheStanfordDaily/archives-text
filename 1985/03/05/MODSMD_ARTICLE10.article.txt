EPA to cut lead levels
WASHINGTON — The Environmental
Protection Agency announced yesterday that it
will slash allowable gasoline lead levels more
than 90 percent by Jan. 1 and will consider a total
ban as early as 1988 in light of evidence that air
borne lead poses substantial health threats.
The EPA's decision, generally praised by both
environmentalists and the oil industry, will re
quire the lead content to be reduced from the
current 1.1 grams per gallon of leaded gasoline to
0.1 grams next January. An interim standard of
0.5 grams will take effect in July.
Several studies by the federal Centers for
Disease Control, the EPA and various univer
sities have shown a strong correlation between
lead levels in gasoline and lead levels in blood,
particularly in children. In combination with lead
from other sources, such as chipping paint, air
borne lead can cause brain and nerve damage,
mental retardation, anemia and kidney disorders,
EPA studies show.
The Centers for Disease Control recently
lowered the definition of lead toxicity in humans
from 30 micrograms — or .00003 grams — to 25
micrograms per one-tenth liter of blood. In the
absence of the new EPA standards, it was esti
mated that more than 300,000 children would
have such toxic blood levels next year.
Environmental groups generally praised the
EPA's decision but expressed disappointment
that a total ban would not take place immedi
ately.
The government ordered the first round of
reductions in gasoline lead content in 1973 but
revised the standard upward in 1982 to the cur
rent 1.1 grams per gallon.

Boeing bills questioned
WASHINGTON — The Boeing Co.
billed the American taxpayer for at least
$126,847 in 1982 political contributions, adding
the cost to the price of weapons systems it built
for the Pentagon.
Pentagon auditors called the charges
"questionable" and "unallowable," and the
Defense Department thus far has refused to re
imburse the contractor.
While not challenging the legality of the contri
butions, Rep. Fortney Stark (D-Calif.) said,
"Charging the taxpayer for political contribu
tions is criminal and it ought to be treated that
way."
The charges are among $14.9 million in bills
submitted by selected defense contractors that
have been challenged by the Defense Contract
Audit Agency. Among them are $4.6 million for
General Dynamics, $4.5 million for Rockwell In
ternational and $1.5 million for United Technol
ogies Corp.
Last year, Pentagon auditors told the House
Government Operations Committee that defense
contractors are "incurring over $140 million an
nually in public relations costs under defense
contracts."
Stark plans to introduce legislation this week
to prohibit defense contractors from claiming
certain public relations expenses on their federal
income taxes.
A Boeing spokesman, Harold Carr, confirmed
the charges listed by the auditors, saying such ex
penses are billed to the government routinely as
part of the company's overall cost of doing busi
ness.

Justice's home attacked
WASHINGTON — Supreme Court Justice
Harry Blackmun, who has received numerous
threats since writing the court's controversial
1973 decision legalizing abortion, said yesterday
that a bullet was fired through the window of his
suburban Virginia apartment last Thursday night.
In a statement released by his office, Blackmun
confirmed that a single shot was fired through a
window in his home on the third floor of a 12-
story apartment building in Arlington, Va.,
across the Potomac River from Washington.
Both Blackmun, 76, and his wife, Dorothy, were
at home at the time, but neither was injured.
William Baker, assistant director of the FBI,
which is investigating the incident, said that there
are no suspects in the shooting, which occurred
after 10 p.m. "No one has claimed credit," he
said.
Blackmun has been under constant guard in
public since he received a death threat last Octo
ber from the Army of God, an anti-abortion
group that has claimed responsibility for attacks
against abortion clinics throughout the country.
Market slumps
The stock market turned downward yesterday,
retreating from last week's new high near the
1,300 level in the Dow Jones industrial average.
Issues involved in takeover developments pro
vided most of the excitement in a session of
moderately active trading.
Dow Jones's average of 30 blue chips, which
wound up last week at a record closing high of
1,299.36, dropped back 9.83 to 1,289.53.

ban as early as 1988 in light of evidence that air
borne lead poses substantial health threats.
The EPA's decision, generally praised by both
environmentalists and the oil industry, will re
quire the lead content to be reduced from the
current 1.1 grams per gallon of leaded gasoline to
0.1 grams next January. An interim standard of
0.5 grams will take effect in July.
Several studies by the federal Centers for
Disease Control, the EPA and various univer
sities have shown a strong correlation between
lead levels in gasoline and lead levels in blood,
particularly in children. In combination with lead
from other sources, such as chipping paint, air
borne lead can cause brain and nerve damage,
mental retardation, anemia and kidney disorders,
EPA studies show.
The Centers for Disease Control recently
lowered the definition of lead toxicity in humans
from 30 micrograms — or .00003 grams — to 25
micrograms per one-tenth liter of blood. In the
absence of the new EPA standards, it was esti
mated that more than 300,000 children would
have such toxic blood levels next year.
Environmental groups generally praised the
EPA's decision but expressed disappointment
that a total ban would not take place immedi
ately.
The government ordered the first round of
reductions in gasoline lead content in 1973 but
revised the standard upward in 1982 to the cur
rent 1.1 grams per gallon.

Boeing bills questioned
WASHINGTON — The Boeing Co.
billed the American taxpayer for at least
$126,847 in 1982 political contributions, adding
the cost to the price of weapons systems it built
for the Pentagon.
Pentagon auditors called the charges
"questionable" and "unallowable," and the
Defense Department thus far has refused to re
imburse the contractor.
While not challenging the legality of the contri
butions, Rep. Fortney Stark (D-Calif.) said,
"Charging the taxpayer for political contribu
tions is criminal and it ought to be treated that
way."
The charges are among $14.9 million in bills
submitted by selected defense contractors that
have been challenged by the Defense Contract
Audit Agency. Among them are $4.6 million for
General Dynamics, $4.5 million for Rockwell In
ternational and $1.5 million for United Technol
ogies Corp.
Last year, Pentagon auditors told the House
Government Operations Committee that defense
contractors are "incurring over $140 million an
nually in public relations costs under defense
contracts."
Stark plans to introduce legislation this week
to prohibit defense contractors from claiming
certain public relations expenses on their federal
income taxes.
A Boeing spokesman, Harold Carr, confirmed
the charges listed by the auditors, saying such ex
penses are billed to the government routinely as
part of the company's overall cost of doing busi
ness.

Justice's home attacked
WASHINGTON — Supreme Court Justice
Harry Blackmun, who has received numerous
threats since writing the court's controversial
1973 decision legalizing abortion, said yesterday
that a bullet was fired through the window of his
suburban Virginia apartment last Thursday night.
In a statement released by his office, Blackmun
confirmed that a single shot was fired through a
window in his home on the third floor of a 12-
story apartment building in Arlington, Va.,
across the Potomac River from Washington.
Both Blackmun, 76, and his wife, Dorothy, were
at home at the time, but neither was injured.
William Baker, assistant director of the FBI,
which is investigating the incident, said that there
are no suspects in the shooting, which occurred
after 10 p.m. "No one has claimed credit," he
said.
Blackmun has been under constant guard in
public since he received a death threat last Octo
ber from the Army of God, an anti-abortion
group that has claimed responsibility for attacks
against abortion clinics throughout the country.
Market slumps
The stock market turned downward yesterday,
retreating from last week's new high near the
1,300 level in the Dow Jones industrial average.
Issues involved in takeover developments pro
vided most of the excitement in a session of
moderately active trading.
Dow Jones's average of 30 blue chips, which
wound up last week at a record closing high of
1,299.36, dropped back 9.83 to 1,289.53.
