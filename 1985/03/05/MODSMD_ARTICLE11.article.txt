Officials stop AIDS test
SAN FRANCISCO — Worried that potential
acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)
victims will rush to blood banks to be tested,
public health officials said yesterday they will
impose an emergency moratorium on the release
of results from the new AIDS blood test.
Officials also asked for quick action on laws
pending before the Legislature to delay donor
results and offer free screening at other sites.
Kenneth Kizer, deputy director of the state
Department of Health Services, told an Assem
bly AIDS task force in Sacramento that his de
partment plans to impose the regulations by to
morrow.
Kizer said the moratorium on release of the
results would be imposed so potential AIDS vic
tims would not be encouraged to donate blood
just to see if they pass the screening.
Kizer said the moratorium would last several
months as an "interim step" while legislation is
debated on test confidentiality and other AIDS
issues.
"Our primary concern is protecting the state's
blood supply," Kizer said.

The tests, approved by the federal government
late last week and designed to detect the pres
ence in blood of the antibody to the suspected
AIDS virus, are expected to be in use at Irwin
Memorial Blood Bank this week.
"We do not want to do anything to encourage
people at high risk for having AIDS to go to
blood banks and donate blood in hopes of finding
out if they've been exposed to the (AIDS) virus,"
said Mervyn Silverman, San Francisco's AIDS
consultant.
Meanwhile, Assemblyman Art Agnos (D-San
Francisco) urged Gov. George Deukmejian to
issue an executive order blocking release of test
results.
There was no immediate response from the
governor's office.
Court bars poorhouse
SAN FRANCISCO — The state Supreme
Court barred Sacramento County yesterday from
requiring certain welfare recipients to live in a so
called poorhouse, saying a strong case had been
made that the program was inhumane and vio
lated privacy rights.

The program, watched closely by welfare offi
cials across the state and nation, required
"employable" unmarried recipients of general
assistance to give up their $199 monthly .hecks
and live at a 67-bed dormitory, where they were
given meals and clothing while they looked for
work.
The requirement, intended to save money,
took effect in October 1982. County officials es
timated 300 to 400 people a month refused to
live in the Bannon Street facility and were denied
benefits.
Superior Court Judge Fred Marler and a state
appeals court refused to interfere, but the Su
preme Court granted a hearing to 20 welfare
recipients and two welfare-rights groups and,
pending a ruling, told the county in June 1983 to
make residence voluntary.
Today's weather
Rain likely this morning. Partly cloudy with
scattered showers in the afternoon. Highs in the
upper 40s and 50s. Partly cloudy tonight and to
morrow, with scattered showers. Lows in the up
per 30s and low 40s.
