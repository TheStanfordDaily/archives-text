## Naming bollards and frequency vs.duration 
### 
Dear Bug Me,
What's more important - fre
quency or duration? - F.D.
Good question.
Now for an attempt at a good,
printable answer.
I assume you're asking for
something a bit more authoritative
or comprehensive than my
opinion, which I'm not going to
divulge here anyway.
In an informal and slightly em
barrassing survey I conducted of
people in my all-freshman dorm,
frequency beat out duration by
about 2-to-l. I don't know
whether this will be considered a
conclusive answer about your
comparison as much as a state
ment about the nature of fresh
men, God bless us.

I called the Physics Department
and talked to Prof. Ted Hansch in
an attempt to get an expert
opinion.
Hansch's scientific definition of
frequency is the time it takes for
whatever you are describing to oc
cur again.
Of course, I guess this definition
would imply that if whatever-it-is
has never happened to you, it
would be pretty difficult to achieve
any sort of frequency. Likewise,
duration would have a certain im
possibility.
Hansch used the example of a
pendulum to explain the terms
further. One tick-tock is the dura
tion of the cycle and the number of
tick-tocks per second is the fre
quency.
He wisely pointed out that
things that occur only once have
no frequency to speak of, giving
the origin of the universe as an ex
ample.
But when you're having a tooth
pulled, duration probably takes on
a good deal of importance.
Yet in things like breathing, fre
quency is a nice quality to have.
There are good arguments for
either choice. Why not try both? ,
Do any Stanford dormitories
have co-ed showers? - Anonymous
That depends on how co-ed you
like your hygiene.
There's a co-ed bathroom on
the third floor of Trancos in Wil
bur Hall that has one door and
common sinks and mirrors, but
separate sides for men and women
to shower.
This arrangement was an ex
periment by Res Ed a few years
ago to try to even out the ratio of
the sexes in the Wilbur dorms.
Wilbur was originally a single-sex
hall and was built with only one
bathroom on each floor.
All the other Wilbur dorms
have two floors of one sex and one
of the other because of this
original plan.
According to Ed Kavazanjian,
resident fellow at Trancos, the
remodeling required converting
one room to bathroom space and
spending several hundred
thousand dollars.
He characterized the co-ed
bathroom as generally well
received and said it is no problem

for the freshmen living on that
floor. He added that he thought
keeping a dorm 50 percent women
and 50 percent men is good for
"lots of obvious reasons."
As for any other co-ed
bathrooms on campus, Terry
McGovern, manager of the
Housing Facilities Project, said that
Row houses may have bathrooms
that aren't designated for either
sex, and that "it's up to them how
they use them."
How many bollards are there on
campus? - Anonymous
I wish I knew why you want to
know this. It's not a big deal to me,
whatever your reason is, except
for the fact that the only way to
count the bollards on campus is to
go out and count the bollards on
campus.
There are no bollard
configuration maps. There are no
unified records of all bollard in
stallations. It's almost criminal.
It's as if no one besides you cares
about all those lonely midget tele
phone poles.
But it was nice out this
weekend, so 1 went for a two-hour
tour of the 186 non-residential
bollards that impede vehicular
movements and add to the
sculptural landscape of this institu
tion.
You wouldn't believe the vari
ety of bollards. Well, maybe you
would, given that you're so con
cerned about them. There are rot
ting wooden bollards with pie
wedges cut out of their sides, hi
tech cement ones with razor
square edges, bollards that protect
nothing except the possible ero
sion of the patch of soil they cover,
white Q-tip bollards that are too
skinny to bother counting and six
corsetted Victorian bollards in the
Quad, standing daintily aloof from
their lumpier counterparts.
Bollards cost between $85 and
$100 each, plus about $75 to in
stall, according to Glen Carroll,
manager of Governor's Corner.
The removable type that stands
on little metal plates and the
carved ones at Governor's Corner
cost more than the abbreviated
telephone pole version.
Carroll guessed that there are
about 50 bollards around Gover
nor's Corner alone, and that if you
multiply that by the number of
dorms, you might get a more accu
rate number of all the bolfards on
campus — somewhere in the
thousands.
"There's a lot of wood out
there," Carroll said. And he didn't
even have to ride around on his
bike all afternoon to figure it out.
Why are bollards called bol
lards? - B.M. and W.S.
Is this a conspiracy? I'm becom
ing a bollard expert.
The word "bollard" is usually
defined in its nautical sense: "a
post around which a mooring rope
is fastened."
I can see how one restraint of
vehicular movement might be ap
plied to another.
An etymological dictionary
claims that bollard derives from
the French word "bole," meaning
trunk of a tree.
My own opinion is that bollards
are called bollards because that's
the noise people make when they
ride into them on their bikes. I
don't plan on checking that out for
you. though.

to shower.
This arrangement was an ex
periment by Res Ed a few years
ago to try to even out the ratio of
the sexes in the Wilbur dorms.
Wilbur was originally a single-sex
hall and was built with only one
bathroom on each floor.
All the other Wilbur dorms
have two floors of one sex and one
of the other because of this
original plan.
According to Ed Kavazanjian,
resident fellow at Trancos, the
remodeling required converting
one room to bathroom space and
spending several hundred
thousand dollars.
He characterized the co-ed
bathroom as generally well
received and said it is no problem

for the freshmen living on that
floor. He added that he thought
keeping a dorm 50 percent women
and 50 percent men is good for
"lots of obvious reasons."
As for any other co-ed
bathrooms on campus, Terry
McGovern, manager of the
Housing Facilities Project, said that
Row houses may have bathrooms
that aren't designated for either
sex, and that "it's up to them how
they use them."
How many bollards are there on
campus? - Anonymous
I wish I knew why you want to
know this. It's not a big deal to me,
whatever your reason is, except
for the fact that the only way to
count the bollards on campus is to
go out and count the bollards on
campus.
There are no bollard
configuration maps. There are no
unified records of all bollard in
stallations. It's almost criminal.
It's as if no one besides you cares
about all those lonely midget tele
phone poles.
But it was nice out this
weekend, so 1 went for a two-hour
tour of the 186 non-residential
bollards that impede vehicular
movements and add to the
sculptural landscape of this institu
tion.
You wouldn't believe the vari
ety of bollards. Well, maybe you
would, given that you're so con
cerned about them. There are rot
ting wooden bollards with pie
wedges cut out of their sides, hi
tech cement ones with razor
square edges, bollards that protect
nothing except the possible ero
sion of the patch of soil they cover,
white Q-tip bollards that are too
skinny to bother counting and six
corsetted Victorian bollards in the
Quad, standing daintily aloof from
their lumpier counterparts.
Bollards cost between $85 and
$100 each, plus about $75 to in
stall, according to Glen Carroll,
manager of Governor's Corner.
The removable type that stands
on little metal plates and the
carved ones at Governor's Corner
cost more than the abbreviated
telephone pole version.
Carroll guessed that there are
about 50 bollards around Gover
nor's Corner alone, and that if you
multiply that by the number of
dorms, you might get a more accu
rate number of all the bolfards on
campus — somewhere in the
thousands.
"There's a lot of wood out
there," Carroll said. And he didn't
even have to ride around on his
bike all afternoon to figure it out.
Why are bollards called bol
lards? - B.M. and W.S.
Is this a conspiracy? I'm becom
ing a bollard expert.
The word "bollard" is usually
defined in its nautical sense: "a
post around which a mooring rope
is fastened."
I can see how one restraint of
vehicular movement might be ap
plied to another.
An etymological dictionary
claims that bollard derives from
the French word "bole," meaning
trunk of a tree.
My own opinion is that bollards
are called bollards because that's
the noise people make when they
ride into them on their bikes. I
don't plan on checking that out for

Dear Bug Me,
What's more important - fre
quency or duration? - F.D.
Good question.
Now for an attempt at a good,
printable answer.
I assume you're asking for
something a bit more authoritative
or comprehensive than my
opinion, which I'm not going to
divulge here anyway.
In an informal and slightly em
barrassing survey I conducted of
people in my all-freshman dorm,
frequency beat out duration by
about 2-to-l. I don't know
whether this will be considered a
conclusive answer about your
comparison as much as a state
ment about the nature of fresh
men, God bless us.

I called the Physics Department
and talked to Prof. Ted Hansch in
an attempt to get an expert
opinion.
Hansch's scientific definition of
frequency is the time it takes for
whatever you are describing to oc
cur again.
Of course, I guess this definition
would imply that if whatever-it-is
has never happened to you, it
would be pretty difficult to achieve
any sort of frequency. Likewise,
duration would have a certain im
possibility.
Hansch used the example of a
pendulum to explain the terms
further. One tick-tock is the dura
tion of the cycle and the number of
tick-tocks per second is the fre
quency.
He wisely pointed out that
things that occur only once have
no frequency to speak of, giving
the origin of the universe as an ex
ample.
But when you're having a tooth
pulled, duration probably takes on
a good deal of importance.
Yet in things like breathing, fre
quency is a nice quality to have.
There are good arguments for
either choice. Why not try both? ,
Do any Stanford dormitories

That depends on how co-ed you
