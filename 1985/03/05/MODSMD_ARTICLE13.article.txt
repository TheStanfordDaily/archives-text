# Risser brings excellence to Farm
## Winner of two Pulitzers takes over Knight journalism program 
### SHIRISH DATE Staff writer 
Renown means a great deal to
Stanford. The University boasts
Nobel laureates in the natural
sciences, engineering, the social
sciences and medicine. The business,
law and medical schools are
recognized as at or near the top of
their categories. So when a winner of
two Pulitzer Prizes is chosen as the
head of the professional journalism
program here, it comes as little
surprise.
James Risser, Washington bureau
chief of The Des Moines Register,
will move onto the Farm next month,
becoming the new director of the
John S. Knight Fellowship program
when current director Lyle Nelson
steps down June 1.
A former journalism fellow him
self, Risser says he looks forward to
coming to Stanford and is enthusiastic
about heading the Knight program.
"Programs like this can do a lot to
help the journalism profession," he
says.
Knight fellows are career jour
nalists chosen to spend a year at Stan
ford, auditing classes and attending
weekly seminars. The fellowships are
designed to allow "outstanding
people at a mid-career level" to take
some time off from their jobs, return
to a university setting and "reflect on
their work," according to Risser.
Each year, there are about 80 to
100 applicants for the 12 fellowships,
so competition is stiff. Applicants
must have at least seven years of pro
fessional experience, outstanding ref
erences and the blessings of their
employers to take a year off.
The dozen winners are given a
$20,000 stipend and free reign of
Stanford's educational offerings. In
addition, Risser cites the intangibles
of the time off. "There's no kidding
yourself; it's a lot of fun. . . . Jour
nalism is a high-pressure profession,
and it's a lot of fun to come back to
college for a year."
At the same time, Risser says the
year is filled with a great deal of
"hard work," remembering his own
fellowship in 1973-74. "They (the
fellows) have worked long enough
that they have solid experience but
are young enough to . . . come back
into a college setting and learn some
thing.
"A lot of them : take more than a
full jffad; I know I did. . ... I've never
done as much reading in my life as I
did that year."
The Knight program is often
compared with Harvard's Neiman
Fellowships for journalists. Risser
says the Harvard program has the
longest tradition, but Stanford is
"equal in quality."
"This program, I think, is just as
good as the Neiman program. ... [It
had] a major impact on my life, both
personally and ... on my perfor
mance as a journalist.
"It really [contributed to] me win
ning some of those awards."
To Risser, "some" includes the
Raymond Clapper Memorial Award
and the Society of Professional Jour
nalists/Sigma Delta Chi for Washing
ton reporting, the Worth Bingham
Prize for investigative reporting, the
Associated Press Managing Editors
Public Service Award, the Thomas L.
Stokes Award for environmental
reporting and Pulitzer Prizes for na
tional reporting in 1976 and 1979.
Unlike many career journalists,
Risser more or less stumbled into the
vocation. "I didn't start out to be a
journalist," he recalls.
A native Nebraskan, he attended
the University of Nebraska, where he

majored in psychology. As the result
of a senior-year decision, he attended
law school at the University of San
Francisco. After graduation, he
worked for two years practicing gen
eral law in Nebraska.
The transition to journalism was
sparked by his wife Sandi — currently
the assistant director of public affairs
for the League of Women Voters' na-

largest newspaper chain and publisher
of USA Today) was the top bidder, I

pendent newspaper was one of (The
Register's) strengths.'

tional office and a journalist by train
ing.
"It seemed to me all the people she
was around were more interesting
than the people I was around," he
says.
His second year of law practice was
a part-time job while he attended
journalism classes at Nebraska. After
earning a "professional certificate in
journalism" from the school, Risser
moved to lowa and joined the staff of
The Des Moines Register in 1964, a
daily newspaper regarded by many as
one of the country's best.
After five years of covering city
and state government, Risser trans-

ferred to the Washington bureau in
1969, joining a staff of three Pulitzer
Prize-winning reporters. Risser's
coverage included national politics,
agriculture and environmental issues.
In 1976, he was made bureau chief.
That same year, he won his first
Pulitzer for exposing corruption in
the grain export industry. His 1979
award was for a series exploring the

environmental damage of modern
agriculture.
So after winning two Pulitzers him
self, it seems only appropriate that
Risser was chosen as one of the jurors
for this year's awards. He says his job
is to narrow down applications —
more than 100 are received in each
category — to a handful which will be
passed on to the central committee
that chooses the winners.
"It'll be a good chance to see some
interesting things being written
around the country that you don't
normally get a chance to read."
After more than two decades with
The Register, Risser feels an almost

personal attachment to the paper, so
when the newspaper went up for sale
last year, Risser felt somewhat dis
concerted. "I was sorry that the paper
had to be sold at all," he says.
"When 1 heard Gannett (the na
tion's largest newspaper chain and
publisher of USA Today) was the top
bidder, I was a little wary. . . . Being
an independent newspaper was one
of (The Register's) strengths."
But after Gannett promised to
keep The Register's current high
level editors, not to cut any staff, to
keep the paper's statewide distribu
tion pattern and to maintain its inde
pendent Washington bureau — all
other Gannett papers share a com
mon Washington bureau — Risser
said he is now guardedly optimistic.
"1 have not heard of any resigna
tions. ... The attitude (among staff
ers) is much more positive than it was
when the sale was announced."
Still, Risser prefers independent
papers to chain operations. "My ori
entation is toward independent
newspapers, just as I'm opposed to
concentration in any business. ... 1
think it's especially important in jour
nalism to have many independent
voices."
For Risser, the move to Stanford
will mean an end — for least the
foreseeable future — of a 21-year
reporting career with The Register.
Instead of filing stories for a living, he
will administer the Knight program
and teach one class a year in the De
partment of Communication.
And although Risser says he will
miss reporting, he is eager to take on
a new assignment. "I hope to con
tinue writing," he says. "But I'm not
being employed to write.
"The combination of this job and
teaching is going to keep me busy."
