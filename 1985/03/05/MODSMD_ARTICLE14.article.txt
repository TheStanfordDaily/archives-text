## The 						Stanford Daily Here's another for Goetz 
### 
Bernhard Goetz, who shot four young men on
a New York subway train in December, was in
dicted by a grand jury last month, not for at
tempted murder, but for the much less serious
charge of possessing an illegal weapon. The grand
jury apparently believed that Goetz feared he
was being mugged and was acting in self-defense.
But things have changed. According to a police
report made public last week, Goetz fired a shot
at each of the four youths, then "checked" each
one's condition. Three were lying on the floor of
the train, but the fourth was slumped on a bench.
Seeing no blood on the victim, Goetz said, "You
don't look so bad; here's another," and fired
again, according to the report.
Goetz may or may not have acted out of fear
when he first shot the four youths. We have
doubts, particularly in light of some of the things
Goetz told the New York Post after the incident,
such as: "I wanted to kill those guys. I wanted to
maim those guys."
But now it seems obvious that Goetz's actions
went far beyond self-defense.
Goetz reportedly explained to the Post that he
fired twice at the one victim because he could not
tell if the youth was wounded. It seems to us that

Goetz was no longer in danger, that he
recognized that fact but chose to fire again for
some reason. Clearly, this was no longer self
defense.
Although the police report alleging that Goetz
fired at one youth twice was just made public, the
grand jury knew those facts all along. We're not
sure why the grand jury did not indict Goetz for
attempted murder right away, but we would 112
guess the reason was lack of evidence — the
youths initially refused to testify unless the dis
trict attorney granted them immunity from
charges of attempted robbery. But now that one
of the victims, Troy Canty, has decided to testify
against his assailant without asking for immunity,
the way is cleared for the grand jury to indict
Goetz for attempted murder.
Whatever the resultant verdict, at least we
would get to the bottom of this disturbing case.
But not to indict and try him on attempted mur
der charges would be outrageously injust. We
urge the grand jury to make that additional
charge, and let a jury decide if Goetz had at
tempted murder just as a jury will decide if the
four youths are guilty of attempted robbery.
