## Sandinistas are controlled by elite Castro followers

A common statement by supporters of the
Nicaraguan government is that the Sandinista
government is a popular democratic govern
ment that allows an opposition to operate ef
fectively. According to apologists for the
Sandinistas, any repression in Nicaragua is
only due to the pressures of dealing with a

VIEWPOINT

United States, which is intent on destroying
the government. The apologists claim that the
Sandinista regime's coziness with Cuban
leader Fidel Castro is due to the fact that he is
its only ally in the face of unremitting hostility
from the United States.
Implicit in all their arguments is that the
Carter and Reagan administrations have been
bent on destroying the Sadinistas ever since
they chased Somoza out of Nicaragua in July
1979. A look at the facts shows that these
claims are simply untrue.
The Sandinistas take their name from
Augusto Cesar Sandino, born on May 18,
1895, the illegitimate son of a plantation
owner in the town of Niquinhiomo. Between
the years of 1927 and 1933, he waged a brutal
guerrilla war in the countryside aimed against
the government.
The Sandinista National Liberation Front is
named after Sandino. It was founded in 1962
by two university-educated men, Carlos Fon

seca and Tomas Borge. Fonseca had been a
comrade of Che Guevara during the latter's
guerrillas wars in Latin America. Both he and
Borge were, as the Sandinistas admit in their
book "The Sandinistas," Marxists and
Fidelistas, whose aim was to topple Somoza
and set up a new society based on Fidel
Castro's Cuban model.
By their own admission, the Sandinistas'
closeness to Fidel Castro is not the result of
U.S. pressure. The leaders have been friends,
and self-confessed disciples, of Castro since
the beginning of their organization.
The Sandinistas themselves, again in their
book "The Sandinistas," admit that one of the
reasons they could not gain support in the
countryside, nor win over converts from the
National Guard, was that they were not
peasants. However, the National Guard was
made up essentially of all peasants. This is
why so few defected to the Sandinistas. The
fact that the National Guard had a peasant
base, while the Sandinistas didn't, is impor
tant. The Sandinistas themselves as the
party of the peasantry £pd working class, and
yet as they themselves admit, not one of their
leaders stems from these classes.
Around the time of Fonseca's death, the
FSNL split into three factions. One of the fac
tions, the Terceristas, garnered the support of
important prominent Nicaraguan business
men, professionals, academics and priests,

who, in October 1977, issued a declaration
supporting the Sandinistas and calling for
popular insurrection against Somo/a Without
these groups' support, and the support of
various labor unions which called nationwide
strikes, the Sandinistas couldn't have chased
Somoza out of the country in July 1979. Upon
winning victory, the Sandinistas set up the
Government of National Reconciliation.
Almost immediately, the Sandinistas
started quashing any opposition by forcing
out members of the National Reconstruction
who weren't willing to toe their line. One of
the first to be forced out was Violeta Barrios
de Chamorro, the widow of Pedro Joaquin
Chamorro. He was murdered by Somoza in
1978. The Chamorro family ran Nicaragua's
most respected and widely read opposition
newspaper, La Prensa. Other notable
Nicaraguans who were originally part of the
National Reconstruction Government and
have also been forced out include such
notables as Arturo Cruz and even Edej* Pas
tora. 1 -j— - 7 v
Sandinista attenjjpts to quash opposition
weren't limited to outspoken members of the
government. They moved against the
populace as well. With Cuban and East Ger
man advisers, they established a state security
organization, called the Sandinista Defense
Committees (CDSs), and a system of neigh
borhood surveillance. These organizations

systematically harassed the Catholic church
hierarchy, opposition political parties, inde
pendent human-rights group* and labor uni
ons not under Sandinista control.
During the campaigning in the elections of
last year, the Sandinistas also systematically
harassed all parties not under their control. A
typical tactic was to break up campaign
meetings with goon squads. This type of activ
ity was so frequent that the leading opposition
party, whose candidate was Arturo Cruz,
withdrew and boycotted the elections. Under
these circumstances one can only consider the
Sandinista candidate Daniel Ortega's election
as president of the government to be a sham.
Recently the Sandinistas have been making
some conciliatory gestures to opposition par
ties and freeing up some of the more perni
cious controls on the society. This is a
response to the pressure created by a war
against the U.S.-sponsored contras and Eden
Pastora's fighters which uses up 40 percent of
their government budget and which the San
dinistas are finding impossible to win
militarily. However, at the same time they
have instituted a highly unpopular national
draft.
Equally false is the claim by apologists for
the Sandinistas that the United States has
been hostile to the Nicaraguan government
since the overthrow of Somoza. During 1979,

the first year of the Government of National
Reconciliation, President Carter authorized
$60 million in aid to Nicaragua. It is the San
dinistas themselves who are to blame for the
bad relations with the United States. Their
militarization of Nicaraguan society and at
tempts to form a totalitarian state using ad
visers and methods imported from the
Eastern Bloc countries and Cuba caused the
deterioration in relations between the two
countries. As the current administration has
said repeatedly, the goal of U.S. policy toward
Nicaragua is to reverse the process of
totalitarianization which started when
Chamorro and Robello were pushed out of
the government. There are signs that the pres
sure on the Sandinistas is working. They an*
nounced just last week that they will send
home 100 of the 3,000 Cuban advisers who
are currently in the country and have signaled
a willingness to meet with Secretary of State
George Shultz to discuss conditions for a
negotiated peace in Central America.
Apologists for the Sandinistas who claim
that U.S. policy is guided by a blind hatred
and unremitted hostility are wrong. U.S.
policy is to use pressure on the Sandinistas to
reverse the totalitarianization of Nicaragua.
Recent overtures by Ortega show that this
policy is succeeding.

been hostile to the Nicaraguan government
since the overthrow of Somoza. During 1979,

the first year of the Government of National
Reconciliation, President Carter authorized
$60 million in aid to Nicaragua. It is the San
dinistas themselves who are to blame for the
bad relations with the United States. Their
militarization of Nicaraguan society and at
tempts to form a totalitarian state using ad
visers and methods imported from the
Eastern Bloc countries and Cuba caused the
deterioration in relations between the two
countries. As the current administration has
said repeatedly, the goal of U.S. policy toward
Nicaragua is to reverse the process of
totalitarianization which started when
Chamorro and Robello were pushed out of
the government. There are signs that the pres
sure on the Sandinistas is working. They an*
nounced just last week that they will send
home 100 of the 3,000 Cuban advisers who
are currently in the country and have signaled
a willingness to meet with Secretary of State
George Shultz to discuss conditions for a
negotiated peace in Central America.
Apologists for the Sandinistas who claim
that U.S. policy is guided by a blind hatred
and unremitted hostility are wrong. U.S.
policy is to use pressure on the Sandinistas to
reverse the totalitarianization of Nicaragua.
Recent overtures by Ortega show that this
policy is succeeding.

A common statement by supporters of the
Nicaraguan government is that the Sandinista
government is a popular democratic govern
ment that allows an opposition to operate ef
fectively. According to apologists for the
Sandinistas, any repression in Nicaragua is
only due to the pressures of dealing with a

VIEWPOINT

United States, which is intent on destroying
the government. The apologists claim that the
Sandinista regime's coziness with Cuban
leader Fidel Castro is due to the fact that he is
its only ally in the face of unremitting hostility
from the United States.
Implicit in all their arguments is that the
Carter and Reagan administrations have been
bent on destroying the Sadinistas ever since
they chased Somoza out of Nicaragua in July
1979. A look at the facts shows that these
claims are simply untrue.
The Sandinistas take their name from
Augusto Cesar Sandino, born on May 18,
1895, the illegitimate son of a plantation
owner in the town of Niquinhiomo. Between
the years of 1927 and 1933, he waged a brutal
guerrilla war in the countryside aimed against
the government.
The Sandinista National Liberation Front is
named after Sandino. It was founded in 1962
by two university-educated men, Carlos Fon

seca and Tomas Borge. Fonseca had been a
comrade of Che Guevara during the latter's
guerrillas wars in Latin America. Both he and
Borge were, as the Sandinistas admit in their
book "The Sandinistas," Marxists and
Fidelistas, whose aim was to topple Somoza
and set up a new society based on Fidel
Castro's Cuban model.
By their own admission, the Sandinistas'
closeness to Fidel Castro is not the result of
U.S. pressure. The leaders have been friends,
and self-confessed disciples, of Castro since
the beginning of their organization.
The Sandinistas themselves, again in their
book "The Sandinistas," admit that one of the
reasons they could not gain support in the
countryside, nor win over converts from the
National Guard, was that they were not
peasants. However, the National Guard was
made up essentially of all peasants. This is
why so few defected to the Sandinistas. The
fact that the National Guard had a peasant
base, while the Sandinistas didn't, is impor
tant. The Sandinistas themselves as the
party of the peasantry £pd working class, and
yet as they themselves admit, not one of their
leaders stems from these classes.
Around the time of Fonseca's death, the
FSNL split into three factions. One of the fac
tions, the Terceristas, garnered the support of
important prominent Nicaraguan business
men, professionals, academics and priests,

who, in October 1977, issued a declaration
supporting the Sandinistas and calling for
popular insurrection against Somo/a Without
these groups' support, and the support of
various labor unions which called nationwide
strikes, the Sandinistas couldn't have chased
Somoza out of the country in July 1979. Upon
winning victory, the Sandinistas set up the
Government of National Reconciliation.
Almost immediately, the Sandinistas
started quashing any opposition by forcing
out members of the National Reconstruction
who weren't willing to toe their line. One of
the first to be forced out was Violeta Barrios
de Chamorro, the widow of Pedro Joaquin
Chamorro. He was murdered by Somoza in
1978. The Chamorro family ran Nicaragua's
most respected and widely read opposition
newspaper, La Prensa. Other notable
Nicaraguans who were originally part of the
National Reconstruction Government and
have also been forced out include such
notables as Arturo Cruz and even Edej* Pas
tora. 1 -j— - 7 v
Sandinista attenjjpts to quash opposition
weren't limited to outspoken members of the
government. They moved against the
populace as well. With Cuban and East Ger
man advisers, they established a state security
organization, called the Sandinista Defense
Committees (CDSs), and a system of neigh
borhood surveillance. These organizations

systematically harassed the Catholic church
hierarchy, opposition political parties, inde
pendent human-rights group* and labor uni
ons not under Sandinista control.
During the campaigning in the elections of
last year, the Sandinistas also systematically
harassed all parties not under their control. A
typical tactic was to break up campaign
meetings with goon squads. This type of activ
ity was so frequent that the leading opposition
party, whose candidate was Arturo Cruz,
withdrew and boycotted the elections. Under
these circumstances one can only consider the
Sandinista candidate Daniel Ortega's election
as president of the government to be a sham.
Recently the Sandinistas have been making
some conciliatory gestures to opposition par
ties and freeing up some of the more perni
cious controls on the society. This is a
response to the pressure created by a war
against the U.S.-sponsored contras and Eden
Pastora's fighters which uses up 40 percent of
their government budget and which the San
dinistas are finding impossible to win
militarily. However, at the same time they
have instituted a highly unpopular national
draft.
