# Idolizers crush individuality
## 
### 
We all have our own idols. Ancient Egyptians and
American children in the mid-1970s both worshipped the
goddess Isis. The Bacchae in ancient Greece worshipped
the grape, and early '60s suburbia worshiped wax fruit.
One of the great things about the United States is that we
are free to choose our own idols. Even President Reagan
understands this; that's why he tossed the Super Bowl
coin for a national audience only moments after his
second inauguration. He wanted to offer himself as an al
ternative.
I was grateful for the president's offer. Unlike many
Students Against Reaganism people, I like the president
simply because he is an actor. I like his hearing aid and his
cowboy ranch in Santa Barbara and his collaborations

with Frank Sinatra. Just seeing
him on TV walking with
Nancy and her Adolfo dress
makes him appear all the
more immortal.
However, despite this excit
ing opportunity, I rescinded
the president's offer. He
should have tossed the coin
about two years ago when I
had a regular mythology. In
high school, my life abounded
in mythic figures. I idolized
e, "ii " T

Serena trom Bewitched. I
idolized Pat Collins, "the hip hypnotist." I idolized almost
everything that existed. However, I paid more deference
to some idols than others. At that time my two most wor
shipped figures were Virgil Rubin Griffith and Chris
Fitch.
Sonny Griffith was from Memphis and was overweight.
He used to wear this ring bearing the initials "VRG."
Once I asked him what the "R" stood for, and he said,
"Robyn, tuh huh." He was also in my math class in my
senior year of high school. One day Vivian Bache walked
in late to class and Sonny said, "Tuh huh, we've been
waiting for you." I made that my senior quote.
I mythified Chris Fitch because he used to wear institu
tional green suit vests with maroon pants and Velcro
sneakers. After he graduated from high school he went to
Indonesia and saw a native girl on the beach. She spoke
no English, but he immediately married her. She now lives
with his family in Connecticut while he goes to Yale. I
guess they're still trying to teach her English.
I remember why 1 used to idolize these people. It was
because I used to transform these stories into myths. Zeus
would have been nothing if he hadn't slept with women
and turned them into cows to hide them from his wife.
Chris Fitch would have been nothing to me if I couldn't
imagine him on that beach seeing that native girl
bedecked in flowers and deciding to marry her.
Up until last quarter, I created elaborate mythologies
for these people. I wondered why Chris Fitch ever
married a native Indonesian whom he met once on the
beach, then imagined him introducing this woman to
his New England parents. I envisioned Sonny saying to his
Vanderbilt bandmates, "It's not that the pit's a little
small; the orchestra is too big," and saw them react in
shock to his words of wisdom.
Then one day in American Studies 50, English Prof. Jay
Fliegelman mentioned something that caused me to ex-

amine my thoughts toward my idols. He said, "Oftentimes
the things that will attract you will repulse you at the same
time." Although he made that comment in regard to "The
Scarlet Letter," I, being the egocentric child of the early
'70s that I am, thought about this comment in terms of my
own experience. I knew what attracted me to Sonny Grif
fith was his unwittingly pithy statements and what at
tracted me to Chris Fitch was his ability to marry an
Indonesian and wear maroon pants at the same time.
However, I had no problem finding aspects in Sonny
that I found less palatable. I knew that a lot of people used
to pick on Sonny because he was overweight and said "tuh
huh" all the time. And I knew that while I loved talking to

I Sonny in math or taking
photos of him during our
graduation, I was unwilling to
call him my friend. I was
unable to consider him as such
because he seemed so lonely
and I didn't want to deal with
the thought that in being his
friend I might discover that I
shared that aspect with him. I
found it more comfortable to
remove that part of him from
my memory and replace it in
stead with a large dose of my

imagination.
Likewise, I did the same with Chris Fitch, because I had
only seen him around my high school campus and had
only heard about his Indonesian wife from a high school
friend. Because I knew nothing else about him nor was
particularly interested in learning anything else about him
(besides gossipy National Enquirer-type stories that
would superficially interest any human being), I blew him
up with my imagination into a bloated caricature of him
self.
I don't find anything wrong in wanting to know more
Chris Fitch or "tuh huh" Sonny stories, because they are,
if nothing else, entertaining. However, I no longer think
that personally fabricated caricatures made from particu
lar individuals make idols, because in ignoring the whole
of one's personality you ultimately ignore the part of him
that has the best chance of being divine — himself. If you
distort a person into a caricature, you allow him as much
opportunity to achieve some type of immortality as you do
Bugs Bunny, and it's not hard to accidently destroy film.
Therefore, despite my rampant imagination, I'm basi
cally out of that idol stage. I still will fall on my face to
hear a good Sonny Griffith story; however, I no longer at
tempt to blow them out of proportion to his character. I
do have difficulties in facing the "less attractive" elements
in people's characters, because it's hard to accept that
people can get bad breath in this culture. But the attrac
tion that overrides my aversion to facing some of these
aspects is that I might share with other people a common
bond that does, in an ultimate sense, make us all immor
tal.
The only scary part for me is that in this search I might
discover that we all have a common need to make those
type of idols. If that's true, then I guess this whole train of
thought has been one vicious circle for me, tuh huh.

Serena trom Bewitched. I
idolized Pat Collins, "the hip hypnotist." I idolized almost
everything that existed. However, I paid more deference
to some idols than others. At that time my two most wor
shipped figures were Virgil Rubin Griffith and Chris
Fitch.
Sonny Griffith was from Memphis and was overweight.
He used to wear this ring bearing the initials "VRG."
Once I asked him what the "R" stood for, and he said,
"Robyn, tuh huh." He was also in my math class in my
senior year of high school. One day Vivian Bache walked
in late to class and Sonny said, "Tuh huh, we've been
waiting for you." I made that my senior quote.
I mythified Chris Fitch because he used to wear institu
tional green suit vests with maroon pants and Velcro
sneakers. After he graduated from high school he went to
Indonesia and saw a native girl on the beach. She spoke
no English, but he immediately married her. She now lives
with his family in Connecticut while he goes to Yale. I
guess they're still trying to teach her English.
I remember why 1 used to idolize these people. It was
because I used to transform these stories into myths. Zeus
would have been nothing if he hadn't slept with women
and turned them into cows to hide them from his wife.
Chris Fitch would have been nothing to me if I couldn't
imagine him on that beach seeing that native girl
bedecked in flowers and deciding to marry her.
Up until last quarter, I created elaborate mythologies
for these people. I wondered why Chris Fitch ever
married a native Indonesian whom he met once on the
beach, then imagined him introducing this woman to
his New England parents. I envisioned Sonny saying to his
Vanderbilt bandmates, "It's not that the pit's a little
small; the orchestra is too big," and saw them react in
shock to his words of wisdom.
Then one day in American Studies 50, English Prof. Jay
Fliegelman mentioned something that caused me to ex-

amine my thoughts toward my idols. He said, "Oftentimes
the things that will attract you will repulse you at the same
time." Although he made that comment in regard to "The
Scarlet Letter," I, being the egocentric child of the early
'70s that I am, thought about this comment in terms of my
own experience. I knew what attracted me to Sonny Grif
fith was his unwittingly pithy statements and what at
tracted me to Chris Fitch was his ability to marry an
Indonesian and wear maroon pants at the same time.
However, I had no problem finding aspects in Sonny
that I found less palatable. I knew that a lot of people used
to pick on Sonny because he was overweight and said "tuh
huh" all the time. And I knew that while I loved talking to

I Sonny in math or taking
photos of him during our
graduation, I was unwilling to
call him my friend. I was
unable to consider him as such
because he seemed so lonely
and I didn't want to deal with
the thought that in being his
friend I might discover that I
shared that aspect with him. I
found it more comfortable to
remove that part of him from
my memory and replace it in
stead with a large dose of my

imagination.
Likewise, I did the same with Chris Fitch, because I had
only seen him around my high school campus and had
only heard about his Indonesian wife from a high school
friend. Because I knew nothing else about him nor was
particularly interested in learning anything else about him
(besides gossipy National Enquirer-type stories that
would superficially interest any human being), I blew him
up with my imagination into a bloated caricature of him
self.
I don't find anything wrong in wanting to know more
Chris Fitch or "tuh huh" Sonny stories, because they are,
if nothing else, entertaining. However, I no longer think
that personally fabricated caricatures made from particu
lar individuals make idols, because in ignoring the whole
of one's personality you ultimately ignore the part of him
that has the best chance of being divine — himself. If you
distort a person into a caricature, you allow him as much
opportunity to achieve some type of immortality as you do
Bugs Bunny, and it's not hard to accidently destroy film.
Therefore, despite my rampant imagination, I'm basi
cally out of that idol stage. I still will fall on my face to
hear a good Sonny Griffith story; however, I no longer at
tempt to blow them out of proportion to his character. I
do have difficulties in facing the "less attractive" elements
in people's characters, because it's hard to accept that
people can get bad breath in this culture. But the attrac
tion that overrides my aversion to facing some of these
aspects is that I might share with other people a common
bond that does, in an ultimate sense, make us all immor
tal.
The only scary part for me is that in this search I might
discover that we all have a common need to make those
type of idols. If that's true, then I guess this whole train of
thought has been one vicious circle for me, tuh huh.

We all have our own idols. Ancient Egyptians and
American children in the mid-1970s both worshipped the
goddess Isis. The Bacchae in ancient Greece worshipped
the grape, and early '60s suburbia worshiped wax fruit.
One of the great things about the United States is that we
are free to choose our own idols. Even President Reagan
understands this; that's why he tossed the Super Bowl
coin for a national audience only moments after his
second inauguration. He wanted to offer himself as an al
ternative.
I was grateful for the president's offer. Unlike many
Students Against Reaganism people, I like the president
simply because he is an actor. I like his hearing aid and his
cowboy ranch in Santa Barbara and his collaborations

with Frank Sinatra. Just seeing
him on TV walking with
Nancy and her Adolfo dress
makes him appear all the
more immortal.
However, despite this excit
ing opportunity, I rescinded
the president's offer. He
should have tossed the coin
about two years ago when I
had a regular mythology. In
high school, my life abounded
in mythic figures. I idolized
