Not a dead issue
The article appearing in The Daily
(Feb.2B) concerning the Concert
Network and the Grateful Dead
really disturbed me. It appears that
the Concert Network, whose organi
zational bills the student body is
paying through fee assessments, is
actually working against the will of
many of those it represents. Accord
ing to the chairman of the Concert
Network Advisory Board, Derek
Passarelli, "The Grateful Dead will
not play at Stanford University." To
that statement I say, please resign,
Mr. Passarelli, and allow someone
who is committed to bringing the
best acts possible to run the Concert
Network.
The Grateful Dead is a cultural
institution in the Bay Area, and its

involvement with Stanford Univer
sity spans nearly two decades. As
early as 1961, the Dead played in
Arroyo, and later successful concerts
were produced in Maples Pavilion
and Frost Amphitheatre.
It saddens me to think that a
group of stubborn students, bending
to pressure from conservative Uni
versity officials, can blacklist one of
the most original and creative bands
that the Concert Network could ever
hope to book.
Please exhibit the autonomy and
strength that a strong concert organi
zation should show by not always
catering to the University's wishes.
Financial risk is certainly not the
problem. A Bill Graham Presents
spokesman confirmed that "Dead
concerts are always lucrative."
But the Concert Network can

always rely on fee assessments, I
suppose, so why risk bringing "the
kind of people that a Grateful Dead ;
concert attracts" to Stanford? Yet
those producing concerts at UC-
Berkeley are willing to take the risks
and reap the rewards.
So are traffic problems really the
issue, considering the Super Bowl
just played here and traffic for that !
enormous event ran smoothly? With
a little cooperation from the Concert
Network, Graham himself
"guarantees" to bring the Dead to
Frost. So how about it, or should we
continue to watch the great acts that
the Concert Network has booked so
far?
