# Senate may cut GPB and refunds
## 
### JOYA WESLEY Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate will vote on hills
to eliminate cash refunds of special
fee assessments and to abolish the
Guest Professorship Bureau (GPB)
at tonight's final meeting of the quar
ter.
I'he senate will also consider a hill
to restructure the procedure for
placing issues on ballots and calling
special elections. In addition, two
motions on senate procedures will be
voted on and University President
ponald Kennedy will speak.
The bills to eliminate cash refunds
of special fee assessments and to
abolish the GPB were presented at
previous meetings and received sub
stantial support from the senate, both
passing preliminary votes. The votes
tonight will determine whether the
former will be placed on the spring
ballot and whether the latter will take
effect Aug. 31.
If passed, the restructuring bill
would require sponsors of proposed
issues for spring ballots to collect
signatures of 25 percent of the stu
dent body, instead of the currently re
quired 20 percent. The bill also would
raise the required number of
signatures to call a special election.
The bill's sponsors, Graduate
Senators Arthur Mart and Richard
Beigel, say it is based on financial
concerns.
C urrently, 5 percent of the student
body, about 620 students, must sign a
petition to call a special election,
which costs the ASSU $3,000. This
bill seeks to eliminate impractical in
equities in the constitution. Hart said.
Hart defended the bill against an
accusation by Senator Mark Soble
that it gives the senate powers
currently held by students. "It's not
really restricting the students'
power," Hart said.
A number of other matters will be
discussed at tonight's senate meeting.
Senator Jon Adelstein said he will
ask Kennedy tonight about the possi
bility of inviting the Grateful Dead to
perform at Frost A\mphitheatre this
spring. Kennedy has expressed
reservations about having the group
perform because of problems with
previous Grateful Dead concerts
here. Adelstein said yesterday that he
will introduce a resolution tonight
calling for the Concert Network to
schedule a Grateful Dead concert on
campus this spring.
Graduate Senator Jim McGrath
will present a bill to limit each
senator's argument on a single issue
to two minutes. Soble strongly
opposes this measure and said he
feels it is directed toward him because
he often speaks at length.
"If the senate tries to silence me,
then they also silence the 1,000 stu
dents who voted for me," Soble said.
In other ASSU news, Senator Gus
tavo Gomez resigned from the Senate
Appropriations Committee. He cited
the treatment given to the association

fee requests of Barrio Assistance,
Chicanos in Health Education and
Stanford Volunteer Network as con
tributing to his resignation.
"I hope the members of the com
mittee realize the potential detrimen
tal effects of the numerous capricious
and callous cuts to the three organiza
tions," Gomez said in his letter of res
ignation.
