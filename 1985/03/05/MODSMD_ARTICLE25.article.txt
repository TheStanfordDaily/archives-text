## Baseball vs. San Francisco State Card faces Gator attack 
### TOM SENF Staff sportswriter 
Stanford's baseball team prepares for this
weekend's battle for first plaee with UCLA
when it it takes on San Francisco State at
Sunken Diamond today at 2:30.
After last week's season-opening sweep of
Arizona State, Stanford has a 3-0 record in
Pacific 10 Southern Division play. UCLA
holds a 5-1 Six-Pac mark on the strength of its
three-game sweep of No. 4-ranked Arizona
last weekend.
Second baseman Pete Stanicek had a one
word summary of the Cardinal's series with
the Sun Devils: "Sweet."
One key to Stanford's success against ASU
was its outstanding fundamental baseball. The
Cardinal played good defense, bunted suc
cessfully when the situation called for it, and
ran the bases aggressively, stealing nine bases.
Stanford ran the hit-and-run play to perfec
tion throughout the weekend. The most clas
sic example occurred on Sunday. With Rick
Lund blade going. Ken Green reached out and

slapped an outside pitch right through the
hole vacated by the ASU second baseman,
who was at the bag waiting for the throw that
never came.
Lundblade later scored on a sacrifice fly by
Toi Cook, providing an insurance run for win
ning pitcher Jack McDowell.
According to Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess, getting the basics right is a
specialty of his team. "We do play good
defense," he said. "Our fundamentals are
fairly consistent. We think that's one of our
strengths."
Defense is also a trademark of the San
Francisco State team. The Gators bring a 10-
6 overall record into today's game. They cur
rently lead the Northern California Athletic
Conference with a 9-3 mark.
One of the Gators' losses was a 5-4 setback
at the hands of California — a game Gators
Coach Greg Warzecka thought his team
should have won.
San Francisco State is led by Division II
All-America candidate Lorant Reeves, an

outfielder with a .444 batting average. The
ace of the pitching staff is Franz Gonzales,
who currently boasts a 5-0 record.
Gonzales will start today's game, but will
only work a few innings in order to prepare
for a league series with Hayward State this
weekend. "He'll come out after he's shut
Stanford out for four or five innings," War
zecka joked.
To have a chance, Warzecka knows his
team will have to avoid innings like the four
run outbursts ASU fell victim to in the
seventh innings of every game last weekend.
"We'll have to keep them away from the big
inning," he said. "Stanford is a very explosive
team."
If the Gators can do that, Warzecka feels
his team could pull off an upset. "If we can
stay close through seven innings, anything can
happen." he said.
Last Wednesday, U.S. International was
able to do just that — stay close and then pull
it out at the end.

If Toi Cook and his Cardinal teammates are as aggressive on the base paths against San
Francisco State today as they were in the ASU series, Stanford could run away with the
game.
