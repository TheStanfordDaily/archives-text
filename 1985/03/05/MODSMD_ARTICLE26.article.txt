### 
Men's lacrosse
Fighting off the effects of a long
road trip, the Stanford men's
lacrosse team established itself as
the top Northern Conference squad
hy downing both UC-Santa Barbara
and Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo over
the weekend.
In a rematch of last year's confer
ence championship game, which
UCSB won, Stanford had to come
from behind on Saturday to win 9-7.
Coach Jim Bedell cited the out
standing play of goalie Pete Manos
as the key to Saturday's win, as well
as Sunday's upending of Cal Poly,
9-3.
Attack man Adam Tracy, who
fired in three goals on Saturday, was
also a dominant player in both
games.
With the pair of weekend vic
tories, Stanford, now 7-0, assured
itself of the home-field advantage
for the Western States playoffs on
April 13.
In a non-conference game that
should test Stanford's ability against
a strong eastern school, the Card
inal will host Boston College today
on the field next to Maples Pavilion.
The game will start at 3:45 p.m.
Women's lacrosse
The Stanford women's lacrosse
team played in a mid-season tourn
ament at UC-Davis this weekend.
Stanford 1 beat Davis I, but lost to

California. Stanford II lost to Davis
I, but soundly defeated Davis 11.
Wendy Austin, Jennifer Porges
and Lisa Stuart were the major de
fensive figures, while Julie Murray
played a strong offensive game.
Coach Tracy Kendall said the
team played well and hopes the
Cardinal will further improve
before this weekend's tournament
in Vancouver, British Columbia.
Badminton
The Stanford men's and women's
badminton teams put in excellent
performances at the Collegiate Na
tional Badminton Championships at
Swarthmore College this weekend.
Junior Joy Kitzmiller won the
women's singles title for the second
year in a row, then teamed with
sophomore Amrita Saraiya to attain
the women's doubles title that had
evaded the Cardinal women the
year before.
Going into the doubles final, top
rival Arizona State had 38 team
points to Stanford's 37, so by win
ning the doubles Kitzmiller and
Saraiya clinched the team champi
onship as well, 41-38.
The men's tournament ran con
currently with the women's. Fresh
man Ben Wincure won his first
round match but was then knocked
down to the consolation level by a
top-seeded ASU player. Wincure
continued to play well, and he won

the lower bracket.
In the men's doubles, Wincure
teamed with junior Charlie Dicke,
and they both played impressively
to defeat a strong Indonesian team
in the first round. They were
eliminated by ASU, but eventually
were finalists in the lower bracket.
ASU won the team title, but
Stanford picked up third place and a
national ranking for the first time in
Stanford badminton history.
Men's rugby
Despite a determined second-half
charge, the Stanford men's rugby
club's comeback try fell short Satur
day, 21-20, against the visiting
Marin Lions.
The injury-riddled Cardinal
played sluggishly in the first half and
fell behind 15-4. But with 10
minutes left in the game, trailing 21-
8, Stanford came alive for its come
back charge.
After Owen Ratchye, who had
scored the Cardinal's first-half goal,
sprinted 50 yards through and
around several Marin backs, he
dished the ball off to Darrell Brooks
for the score. Neil Angelillo's extra
point conversion made it 21 -14, and
a few minutes later Sam Aronson
took the ball off a scrum and into
the try zone to make it 21-20.
Angelillo's kick would have
evened up the game, but the Card
inal ran out of time before it could
complete the comeback.

The 3-9 Cardinal faces an always
tough California side in the annual
Scrum Axe game here Saturday.
Stanford's first team will be looking
for its first victory in three years
against the Bears at 1 p.m., while
the second teams will clash at 3 p.m.
The third teams play at 11 a.m.
The games will be played on
Maloney Field, adjacent to Sunken
Diamond.
Sailing
This weekend, the Stanford
sailing team traveled to Mission Bay
near San Diego to compete in the
South Series Three and Four sailing
regattas. In Saturday's gale-force
winds of 25 to 30 knots, the Card
inal met with mixed results.
Coach Joe Petrucci called up
junior varsity skipper Albert Boyce
to crew in the two varsity divisions.
With Boyce's help, skipper Rich
Bergsund dominated A Division all
day, recording finishes of second,
first and sixth in the 17-boat fleet.
B Division skipper Tom Kuhnle
had Stanford in the lead entering
the last race of the day, but when a
severe blast of wind sent the rig,
mast, boom and sails into the water,
USC overtook the Cardinal for first
place.
On Sunday, the varsity boat
finished in the top five. The JV
squad fared better — skippers Os
car Brock and Drew Gasher took
first place in the 13-boat fleet.

With Boyce's help, skipper Rich
Bergsund dominated A Division all
day, recording finishes of second,
first and sixth in the 17-boat fleet.
B Division skipper Tom Kuhnle
had Stanford in the lead entering
the last race of the day, but when a
severe blast of wind sent the rig,
mast, boom and sails into the water,
USC overtook the Cardinal for first
place.
On Sunday, the varsity boat
finished in the top five. The JV
squad fared better — skippers Os
car Brock and Drew Gasher took
first place in the 13-boat fleet.
Men's lacrosse
Fighting off the effects of a long
road trip, the Stanford men's
lacrosse team established itself as
the top Northern Conference squad
hy downing both UC-Santa Barbara
and Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo over
the weekend.
In a rematch of last year's confer
ence championship game, which
UCSB won, Stanford had to come
from behind on Saturday to win 9-7.
Coach Jim Bedell cited the out
standing play of goalie Pete Manos
as the key to Saturday's win, as well
as Sunday's upending of Cal Poly,
9-3.
Attack man Adam Tracy, who
fired in three goals on Saturday, was
also a dominant player in both
games.
With the pair of weekend vic
tories, Stanford, now 7-0, assured
itself of the home-field advantage
for the Western States playoffs on
April 13.
In a non-conference game that
should test Stanford's ability against
a strong eastern school, the Card
inal will host Boston College today
on the field next to Maples Pavilion.
The game will start at 3:45 p.m.
Women's lacrosse
The Stanford women's lacrosse
team played in a mid-season tourn
ament at UC-Davis this weekend.
Stanford 1 beat Davis I, but lost to

California. Stanford II lost to Davis
I, but soundly defeated Davis 11.
Wendy Austin, Jennifer Porges
and Lisa Stuart were the major de
fensive figures, while Julie Murray
played a strong offensive game.
Coach Tracy Kendall said the

Cardinal will further improve
before this weekend's tournament
in Vancouver, British Columbia.
Badminton
The Stanford men's and women's
badminton teams put in excellent
performances at the Collegiate Na
tional Badminton Championships at
Swarthmore College this weekend.
Junior Joy Kitzmiller won the
women's singles title for the second
year in a row, then teamed with
sophomore Amrita Saraiya to attain
the women's doubles title that had
evaded the Cardinal women the
year before.
Going into the doubles final, top
rival Arizona State had 38 team
points to Stanford's 37, so by win
ning the doubles Kitzmiller and
Saraiya clinched the team champi
onship as well, 41-38.
The men's tournament ran con
currently with the women's. Fresh
man Ben Wincure won his first
round match but was then knocked
down to the consolation level by a
top-seeded ASU player. Wincure
continued to play well, and he won

the lower bracket.
In the men's doubles, Wincure
teamed with junior Charlie Dicke,
and they both played impressively
to defeat a strong Indonesian team
in the first round. They were
eliminated by ASU, but eventually
were finalists in the lower bracket.
ASU won the team title, but
Stanford picked up third place and a
national ranking for the first time in
Stanford badminton history.
Men's rugby
Despite a determined second-half
charge, the Stanford men's rugby
club's comeback try fell short Satur
day, 21-20, against the visiting
Marin Lions.
The injury-riddled Cardinal
played sluggishly in the first half and
fell behind 15-4. But with 10
minutes left in the game, trailing 21-
8, Stanford came alive for its come
back charge.
After Owen Ratchye, who had
scored the Cardinal's first-half goal,
sprinted 50 yards through and
around several Marin backs, he
dished the ball off to Darrell Brooks
for the score. Neil Angelillo's extra
point conversion made it 21 -14, and
a few minutes later Sam Aronson
took the ball off a scrum and into
the try zone to make it 21-20.
Angelillo's kick would have
evened up the game, but the Card
inal ran out of time before it could
complete the comeback.

The 3-9 Cardinal faces an always
tough California side in the annual
Scrum Axe game here Saturday.
Stanford's first team will be looking
for its first victory in three years
against the Bears at 1 p.m., while
the second teams will clash at 3 p.m.
The third teams play at 11 a.m.
The games will be played on
Maloney Field, adjacent to Sunken
Diamond.

This weekend, the Stanford
sailing team traveled to Mission Bay
near San Diego to compete in the
South Series Three and Four sailing
regattas. In Saturday's gale-force
winds of 25 to 30 knots, the Card

to crew in the two varsity divisions.
With Boyce's help, skipper Rich
Bergsund dominated A Division all
day, recording finishes of second,
