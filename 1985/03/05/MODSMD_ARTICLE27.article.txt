# Netters prepare for SJS, Foothill
## 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford men's tennis team
winds down its preseason play with a
match today at San Jose State and a
home match tomorrow against Foot
hill College.
San Jose State is currently 2-5 in
Pacific Coast Athletic Association
competition, and Foothill, the No. 1-
ranked community college in the na
tion, is 5-1 in the Golden Gate Con
ference.
Stanford Coach Dick Gould
"doesn't expect too much of a prob
lem" with either of the teams, but
said his team "can't just go and diddle
around."
"There's a clear difference be
tween us and the teams on paper, and
provided we go ahead and play well,
there shouldn't be too much diffi
culty," Gould said.
San Jose State is led by senior Dave
Kuhn, 5-6 in dual-match singles com
petition and 6-4 in No. 1 doubles with
partner Mark Murphy. Murphy is
currently 5-4 in his No. 2 singles
matches.
San Jose met its toughest competi
tion of the season two weeks ago
when it placed fourth in the Northern
California Intercollegiates behind

Stanford, California and Fresno
State.
The No. 1 player for Foothill is
Nelson Banes, 2-2. He plays No. 3
doubles with Cory Schultz. The No. 1
doubles team is made up of Marcelo
Pella and Layne Lyssy, currently 5-1.
Although Foothill Coach Tom
Chivington thinks his top doubles
team is a "pretty good one," he is
realistic about the probable outcome
of the match.
"Stanford had two doubles teams
in the finals of the Pacific Coast
Championships this past weekend —
that's pretty awesome," Chivington
said.
"Stanford is a pretty darn tough
team," he continued. "I'd say our po
sition is one of the underdog — if
Stanford played its second six, we'd
still have a tough time."
Coach Gould isn't exactly certain
what kind of a lineup he will have for
this week's matches, but a full one
won't be necessary.
"We're winding down into finals
and I won't have a full lineup until
Friday (against New Mexico). Then
I'll want to get the whole team
playing together at the end of the
quarter for our last match before the
break," Gould said.
