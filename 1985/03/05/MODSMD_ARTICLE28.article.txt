# 'Scooter' is back on his feet
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
Stanford guard Keith Ramee walked past
teammate John Williams in the lockerroom Satur
day following the Cardinal's 68-61 loss to Oregon,
patted him on the back, and said, "Good to have
you back."
Indeed, it has been a while since Williams, a
junior guard with an extra year of eligibility, has
played in a game. In fact, it's been a while since he's
even been in uniform.
Saturday's game was Williams' 1985 debut, as he
had missed 21 straight games with a stress fracture
in his right foot. Williams rose to the occasion with
10 points, four rebounds and three assists against
the Ducks.
In December, just four games into this season,
Williams was already enjoying his best collegiate
year. He had played in all four games, including
Stanford's upset victory over LaSalle in the finals of
the Apple Invitational Tournament. And he was
averaging 14 minutes per game, a big change from
last season, when he logged a total of 24 minutes in
eight games.
Then Williams' right foot began to hurt. He went
to the doctor thinking it was a stress fracture, but
X-rays proved negative. The foot continued to hurt
and Williams returned to the doctor. This time, a
stress fracture of the fifth metatarsal bone (the
small toe) showed up.
"Sheer disappointment was my first reaction,"
said Williams, who goes by the nickname Scooter.
"I thought I was having a pretty good year. I was
really disappointed and in a hurry to get back. But
with a stress fracture, you can't rush it or it will get
worse."
So Williams took his time. He lifted weights,
rode an exercise bike and basically did everything
except run or jump on his foot. Williams, who at 6-
foot-2 is probably Stanford's quickest player, first
tried to come back three weeks ago, before road
games against Arizona and Arizona State. He was
scheduled to make the trip, but felt pain in his foot
the day before and stayed home.
Williams did make Stanford's next road trip, to
Oregon this weekend. He sat on the bench
Thursday night against Oregon State and was
prepared to sit again Saturday against Oregon, un
til Coach Tom Davis pulled him aside at practice
Friday.
"I talked to coach at practice," Williams
recalled. "He said, 'We're going to give you a look
out there because you've had a good week of
practice. .. . How well you play will determine how
long you play."
Sure enough, Williams entered the game with
15:39 remaining in the first half. He played for 11
minutes, took no shots but scored a point on a free
throw.
"1 just wanted to get into the flow of the game
and feel comfortable out there," Williams said. "So
I just came in and passed the ball around instead of
jacking up a shot immediately."
Williams changed that philosophy in the second
half. He played 10 minutes, took six shots, made
four of them, and added a free throw for nine

second-half points. Remember, the last time he
played in a game was Dec. 1.
Two of his second-half baskets came just seconds
apart, while Stanford was rebounding from a 17-
point deficit. With Oregon ahead 41-32, Williams
scored on a lean-in 10-footer. Then, after Stan
ford's press forced a turnover, Williams hit a 19-
footer from the left side to make it 41-36.
"I thought it would be pretty tough to come
back, but it only took a couple of days and a couple
of airballs," Williams said. "I felt pretty com
fortable out there. Practice prepares you pretty
well for the games."
Davis said his biggest problem wasn't giving Wil
liams playing time, but finding some for him. "We

had played so well against Southern California (the
week before) that I didn't want to disrupt the
lineup (against Oregon State) even though he had
been playing better and better in practice.
"But I thought he at least deserved a chance
(against Oregon), although I didn't know how
much of a look he'd get."
Davis wasn't the only one who missed Williams
during his virtually season-long absence. "He's a
great defensive guard, a great outside shooter and a
great penetiator," Ramee said. "He's just a great
overall player and adds another dimension to the
team.
"Yeah, we missed him."

After 21 missed games, John "Scooter" Williams (24) has been welcomed back into the Stanford
lineup.
Stanford guard Keith Ramee walked past
teammate John Williams in the lockerroom Satur
day following the Cardinal's 68-61 loss to Oregon,
patted him on the back, and said, "Good to have
you back."
Indeed, it has been a while since Williams, a
junior guard with an extra year of eligibility, has
played in a game. In fact, it's been a while since he's
even been in uniform.
Saturday's game was Williams' 1985 debut, as he
had missed 21 straight games with a stress fracture
in his right foot. Williams rose to the occasion with
10 points, four rebounds and three assists against
the Ducks.
In December, just four games into this season,
Williams was already enjoying his best collegiate
year. He had played in all four games, including
Stanford's upset victory over LaSalle in the finals of
the Apple Invitational Tournament. And he was
averaging 14 minutes per game, a big change from
last season, when he logged a total of 24 minutes in
eight games.
Then Williams' right foot began to hurt. He went
to the doctor thinking it was a stress fracture, but
X-rays proved negative. The foot continued to hurt
and Williams returned to the doctor. This time, a
stress fracture of the fifth metatarsal bone (the
small toe) showed up.
"Sheer disappointment was my first reaction,"
said Williams, who goes by the nickname Scooter.
"I thought I was having a pretty good year. I was
really disappointed and in a hurry to get back. But
with a stress fracture, you can't rush it or it will get
worse."
So Williams took his time. He lifted weights,
rode an exercise bike and basically did everything
except run or jump on his foot. Williams, who at 6-
foot-2 is probably Stanford's quickest player, first
tried to come back three weeks ago, before road
games against Arizona and Arizona State. He was
scheduled to make the trip, but felt pain in his foot
the day before and stayed home.
Williams did make Stanford's next road trip, to
Oregon this weekend. He sat on the bench
Thursday night against Oregon State and was
prepared to sit again Saturday against Oregon, un
til Coach Tom Davis pulled him aside at practice
Friday.
"I talked to coach at practice," Williams
recalled. "He said, 'We're going to give you a look
out there because you've had a good week of
practice. .. . How well you play will determine how
long you play."
Sure enough, Williams entered the game with
15:39 remaining in the first half. He played for 11
minutes, took no shots but scored a point on a free
throw.
"1 just wanted to get into the flow of the game
and feel comfortable out there," Williams said. "So
I just came in and passed the ball around instead of
jacking up a shot immediately."
Williams changed that philosophy in the second
half. He played 10 minutes, took six shots, made
four of them, and added a free throw for nine

second-half points. Remember, the last time he
played in a game was Dec. 1.
Two of his second-half baskets came just seconds
apart, while Stanford was rebounding from a 17-
point deficit. With Oregon ahead 41-32, Williams
scored on a lean-in 10-footer. Then, after Stan
ford's press forced a turnover, Williams hit a 19-
footer from the left side to make it 41-36.
"I thought it would be pretty tough to come
back, but it only took a couple of days and a couple
of airballs," Williams said. "I felt pretty com
fortable out there. Practice prepares you pretty
well for the games."
Davis said his biggest problem wasn't giving Wil
liams playing time, but finding some for him. "We

had played so well against Southern California (the
week before) that I didn't want to disrupt the
lineup (against Oregon State) even though he had
been playing better and better in practice.
"But I thought he at least deserved a chance
(against Oregon), although I didn't know how
much of a look he'd get."
Davis wasn't the only one who missed Williams
during his virtually season-long absence. "He's a
great defensive guard, a great outside shooter and a
great penetiator," Ramee said. "He's just a great
overall player and adds another dimension to the
team.
"Yeah, we missed him."
