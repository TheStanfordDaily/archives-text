# Is frosh resolution just a red herring?
## 
### GEOFF SANBORN Editorial staff 
There's a story, probably
apocryphal, about a freshman bas
ketball star at a Midwestern col
lege who enrolls in a remedial
math course in the fall. On the first
day, the teacher explains the
framework of the course and, at
the end of the class, skims over a
few basics — one plus one is two,
two plus two is four, etc.
The next day the teacher contin
ues with basic addition, and writes
on the board: I+3=4. The
freshman basketball player raises
his hand.
"Teacher," he says,"yesterday
you told us two and two is four.
Today, you say one and three is
four. Now, which one is it?"

Analysis

The story may not be true, but
the problem it describes seems all
too real in the world of collegiate
football and basketball.
Recently, it was revealed that
North Carolina State's freshman
center Chris Washburn was ad
mitted to the university with a
combined score of 470 on the
Scholastic Aptitude Test — 270
on the math section, 200 on the
verbal. Two hundred is the lowest
possible score on a section of the
SAT.
The news rekindled a contro
versy that has been burning
steadily ever since freshmen were
allowed to compete in varsity foot
ball and basketball back in the
early '70s: Should college fresh
men be placed in the position of
having to combine academics and
intense intercollegiate athletics?
This weekend, 30 presidents
and chancellors of Division I-A
schools answered that question
with an emphatic "no." The com
mittee, convened by Edward
Foote 11, president of Miami
(Fla.), sent a resolution to the
NCAA's president's commission
asking that freshmen be declared
once again ineligible for varsity
football and basketball.
Foote said the resolution was
meant to correct an "imbalance
between academics and athletics."

A college freshman, said Foote,
should not practice football
"before he knows where the li
brary is, before he knows where
the first class is."
But is the solution to ban all
freshmen, both the Washburns
and the John Payes, the ones who
can't handle the pressure and the
ones who can?
The committee's resolution "is a
red herring," said Stanford Ath
letic Director Andy Geiger. "The
only thing to do is take in some
brighter people. Schools have to
discipline themselves.
"All they're doing is trying to
continue admitting people who are
not academically qualified."
Richard Young, the athletic
director at Washington State,
opposed the resolution, despite
the fact that Washington State was
among the group of schools that
signed the recommendation.
"It's a philosophically sound
proposal if we could afford it,"
said Young. "Problem is, we
can't."
Major college football teams
have more than 100 players on the
roster, and 95 of them are allowed
to be on scholarship. If the 20-plus
freshmen on scholarship are not
allowed to play, one of two things
will happen — either the spaces
will be filled by walk-ons, or, more
likely, the NCAA will raise the
limit on scholarship players to
around 120.
Combine the cost of the extra
scholarships with the cost of a
freshman football program —
coaches, fields, travel expenses —
and you have a severe financial
strain.
"Ideologically, I'm for (the
resolution)," said Stanford faculty
athletic representative Jack
Friedenthal. "If everybody was
barred it would put education
back in its proper place.
"However," continued Frieden
thal, "it would cost the schools a
fortune . . . and the freshmen
would still be under pressure to
perform well (on the freshman
teams) if they wanted to keep their
scholarships.
"(The resolution) would only
make things worse."
