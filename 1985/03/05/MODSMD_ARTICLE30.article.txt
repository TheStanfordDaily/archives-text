## 'Mean Season' self-righteous but solid, self-assured work 
### STEVE VINEBERG Editorial staff 
The 1981 film "Absence of
Malice" concerned a newspaper
woman who inadvertently damaged
one innocent life and destroyed an
other by pursuing a story. Though
the makers of the picture, by prac
ticing the particularly annoying vice
of passing judgment on their char
acters, ended up with melodrama,
they did start out with a clear and
plausible issue of journalistic ethics.
"The Mean Season," adapted by
Leon Piedmont from a John Kat
zenbach novel entitled "In the Heat
of the Summer," is just as sure of it
self as "Absence of Malice," but
this time I'm afraid the issue eluded
me.
Malcolm Anderson (Kurt Rus
sell), a reporter on the verge of
quitting his Miami job and moving
to a small-town paper in Colorado,
covers the murder of a teenage girl.
The killer, pleased with Anderson's
coverage, establishes a telephone
connection with him, granting him
not only exclusive interviews but
also the scoop on each fresh, grisly
homicide — and this weird liaison
naturally turns Malcolm into a
celebrity. The chief of police
(Richard Bradford) treats him like
a degenerate, his girlfriend
Christine (Mariel Hemingway, in
her worst performance) screams
that he's become a collaborator in
the crimes, and by the time the
sociopath has kidnaped her to
punish Malcolm ("You got so much
from all this — there had to be a
price," he says) the movie is clearly
confirming his point of view, if not
the measures he has taken to
promulgate it. But what in God's
name was Anderson supposed to do
— refuse to take the calls? How
would that have short-circuited the
murderous plans of a man who, by
his own admission, feels the "need"
to kill? True, he also feels a need to
talk, and (as we learn, in the

movie's only clever twist) the need
to draw attention to himself — but
as long as he continued to murder
strangers, the last urge would al
ways be gratified, and even if by an
unprecedented cooperation of all
the newsmen in Miami, everyone
hung up on him whenever he tried
to call, why would that prevent him
from continuing his rampage?
You know that the movie has a
knife out for Malcolm when his
editor (Richard Masur) tells him
with unconcealed glee that this se
ries of articles may have landed
Anderson in "Pulitzer Prize terri
tory." In the most outrageous scene
in "The Killing Fields," John
Malkovich accuses Sam Waterston
of endangering the life of his Cam
bodian associate in order to win the
Pulitzer Prize (or an award that
stands in for it). The assumption in
both cases seems to be that it's

morally wrong to win a prize for
reporting well on something that
has caused injury to others — that
in some unspecified way the action
of reporting a horror is tantamount
to instigating it.
"The Mean Season" was directed
by a Canadian, Phillip Borsos,
whose first film, "The Grey Fox,"
was visually extraordinary.
Working again with the cinematog
rapher Frank Tidy, Borsos finds as
unique a mood and style for Miami
as he provided for the Canadian
West in "The Grey Fox," and on
the whole the film is a solid, assured
piece of work, with one perfectly
acceptable piece of acting (by Kurt
Russell) and one fairly imaginative
one (by Richard Jordan). As a
rabble rouser, however, "The
Mean Season" makes a lot of self
righteous noise about very little.


Kurt Russell stars as an enterprising journalist in "The Mean
Season/' Mariel Hemingway plays his girlfriend.
