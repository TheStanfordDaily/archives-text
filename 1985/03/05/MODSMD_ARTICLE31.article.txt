# Husker Du intense

### TONY TRAN 
Husker Du's performance at the Keystone Palo Alto
Thursday night confirmed the group's position as one of
America's greatest punk bands, and also consolidated the
reputation of its label, SST, as perhaps the foremost inde
pendent recording label in the country. Palo Alto had the
honor of being the first stop for the 1985 SST California
Tour, and the Huskers played an intense, passion-filled
set that capped what was already an incredible — and his
toric — night featuring some of the very best groups in
current American "underground" rock. They were
preceded (in reverse chronological order) by fellow SST
groups the Minutemen, the Meat Puppets, Saccharine
Thrust and SWA (who first took the stage way back at 9
p.m.). All in all, it was five hours of pure heaven-on-earth
for the follower and fan of today's alternative rock music
scene.
By the time headliner Husker Du occupied the stage at
1 a.m. Friday, the crowd still had not had enough (who
could blame it?) and was packed into the front near the
stage, eagerly absorbing the sonic onslaught from the
band. Of the five top-notch bands that played that night,
Husker Du is probably the most highly acclaimed, and the
one most closely identified with hardcore punk rock. Su
perlatives have been heaped on the band from both fans
and critics (e.g. "These guys play harder, faster and louder
than anyone else. . .. ") and it did not take long to figure
out why. From the opening galvanizing guitar salvoes that
launched the anthemic "Something I Learned Today" to
the crashing end of their blistering cover of the Beatles'
"Helter Skelter" one hour later, Husker Du treated the
audience to a serving of unrelenting, maximum rock 'n'
roll that seemed to have been taken to its limits.
The three-man band from Minnesota consists of
guitarist/singer Bob Mould, drummer/singer Grant Hart
and bassist Greg Norton. In appearance they don't fit the
image of a "core" punk band (What? Not a single skin
head in the band?). The drummer could have belonged to
a 1960s hippie colony with his shoulder-length hair and
bare feet; the bassist could have come from high society
with his elegant Rollie Fingers-styled moustache; and the
singer/guitarist looked, well, ordinary. For this dedicated
band, everything was going to take a back seat to the
music — which is how any form of rock n' roll should be.
(Are you listening, MTV?) Once he started playing,
however, each Husker became a powerful force — visual
as well as musical — with distinctive individual character
istics. Hart had the time of his life thrashing away Keith
Moon-style at the drums, breaking into a hearty grin
whenever it was his turn to sing. Norton was in contin
uous, frenzied motion around the stage the whole time,
whirling and turning, pulled like all of us into the liberat
ing vortex of the music to which he contributes. Perhaps
most riveting was the presence of vocalist/guitarist Mould,
who more often growled, shrieked and screamed than
sang.
Vocal powers aside, it's Mould's guitar-playing that
gives Husker Du its unique, instantly recognizable sonic
trademark: a "metallic," dense, übiquitous sound that can

be considered hardcore's equivalent to Phil Spector s
"Wall of Sound" of the 19605. In concert, the amplified,
relentless sonic barrage of Husker Du reaches nearly un
bearable gripping levels of loudness and power that can
make even a fanatic follower of hardcore punk feel uneasy
in heart and mind. There is a palpable apocalyptic edge to
Husker Du's music that is quite menacing and intimidat
ing and, at the same time, liberating and soul-uplifting
(and I should also mention, great for slam-dancing).
Another element that sets Husker Du apart from most
of its competition is the lyrical contents of the songs,
which deal with the subliminal and unconscious spheres of

the human experience — a few song titles, for example,
are "Re-occurring Dreams," "Masochism World,"
"Beyond the Threshold" and "Pink Turns to Blue" —
rather than the usual punk territory of overtly political
and social criticism.
The band performed well-chosen cuts from each of its
three LPs— the debut "Metal Circus" (1983), the artistic
and commercial breakthrough "Zen Arcade" (1984) and
the excellent new album "New Day Rising." The only
possible gripe I might have is that the band didn't perform
its remarkable cover version of the Byrds' revolutionary
1967 single, "Eight Miles High."
As with most punk concerts, however, atmosphere and
feelings were more important than form or content, and
the whole was greater than the sum of its parts. But these
qualities had a different, special significance that night.
For although Husker Du fulfilled every expectation that I
had of it, it was still just one part (however important or
major) of a whole that included four others — the
Minutemen, the Meat Puppets, Saccharine Thrust and
SWA. Together, the five bands provided the audience
with the full, exhilarating experience of seeing the 1985
SST California Tour in action.
