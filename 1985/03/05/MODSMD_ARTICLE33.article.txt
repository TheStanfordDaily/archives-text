# Opera funny but not creative

### ELAINE WANG 
"Albert Herring" by the San Jose
Opera Company is a production of
medium highs and lows, and it is not
terribly creative. But, it is funny, as
Benjamin Britten meant it to be, and
could contribute to a fine evening on
the town.
At Loxford, a small town in turn
of-the-century East Suffolk, the vil
lagers are organizing the crowning of
a May Queen. The township leaders
gather to present the candidates to
the patroness, Lady Billows, whose
housekeeper, Florence, keeps a col
lection of gossip in a little black book.
None of the girls is deemed morally
acceptable, and the chief of police
suggests that a May King could be
crowned — that is, Albert Herring,
the green-grocer's son.
Albert is indeed a virtuous young
man, but only because he is com
pletely under his mother's thumb.
Before the crowning committee des
cends on his shop, he reflects on the
experiences he has never had —
"Golly, it's about time" — especially
the growing romance between his
friends, Sid and Nancy. He is hor
rified at the honor bestowed upon
him, but cannot argue his mother out
of it (the honor of May King brings in
25 gold pieces).
After the festivities, during which
Sid and Nancy lace Albert's
lemonade with rum, Albert returns
home and ponders his shortcomings.
Hearing Sid and Nancy talking about
him in the street, he decides to get a
taste of the world. Taking the prize
money, he slips out into the night.
Returning later, Mrs. Herring
assumes Albert is sleeping, and goes
to bed.
By the next day, the entire neigh
borhood is frantic, while Nancy tries
to comfort Mrs. Herring. Albert's
orange-blossom wreath is discovered
in the well, and everyone joins in a
song about youthful life taken early.

Then Albert swaggers in — to out
bursts and demands for explanations
from the mourners. He recounts the
profligate night and thanks them for
"providing the wherewithal." He
then turns to his nagging, sobbing
mother and commands, "That's
enough. Mum."
The San Jose production of this
popular comic opera plays for all the
laughs, and plays them well. The cast
is enthusiastic (and young) and the
voices are basically balanced. Sid
(David Cox-Cresswell), the bois
terous smooth-talker, and Nancy
(Susan Squires), the village beauty,

were particularly convincing; their
flirtation was never overly serious,
but the love scenes were passionate,
as were the fights.
The character parts, such as Lady
Billows (Barbara Detrick-Swedlow),
the elderly autocrat, and Mr. Upfold
(Ravil Atlas), the mayor, comple
mented each other. Atlas' sideways
shuffle evoked the most chuckles, al
though it was overdone in some parts.
Detrick-Swedlow gave a solid show
as the imposing matriarch, but she
lacks the clear enunciation of the
others. (Granted, however, that En
glish is troublesome in operatic sing
ing)
Grant Thompson, portraying the
titular hero, also gives a solid perfor
mance; he is theatrical and he has a
fine voice, but there's nothing ex
traordinary happening to his charac
ter. Part of this may be the direction
of the production — the ac
tors/singers aren't given enough
movement onstage, so that most of
the time they pace, scurry or fling
themselves about the stage.
The scene changes were a particu
lar problem. Britten's interim music is
varied and intriguing musically, but
San Jose does not fill in the visuals.
Between scenes the audience is faced
with one backdrop painted with a
country scene (not wholly attractive,
either). There could have been more
backdrops, or even pantomimes by
the cast.
Yet the comedy is fast-paced and
detailed; the company has fitted
some very funny bits to Britten's
music. When Lady Billow is thinking
about the suggestion for a May King,
for instance, the music swells and
subsides in a quick crescendo. Lady
Billow breathes in similar fashion and
literally billows out of her chair to
proclaim the new tradition of May
King Touches like that make this
production a good one, and worth a
try.

assumes Albert is sleeping, and goes
to bed.
By the next day, the entire neigh
borhood is frantic, while Nancy tries
to comfort Mrs. Herring. Albert's
orange-blossom wreath is discovered
in the well, and everyone joins in a
song about youthful life taken early.

Then Albert swaggers in — to out
bursts and demands for explanations
from the mourners. He recounts the
profligate night and thanks them for
"providing the wherewithal." He
then turns to his nagging, sobbing
mother and commands, "That's
enough. Mum."
The San Jose production of this
popular comic opera plays for all the
laughs, and plays them well. The cast
is enthusiastic (and young) and the
voices are basically balanced. Sid
(David Cox-Cresswell), the bois
terous smooth-talker, and Nancy
(Susan Squires), the village beauty,

were particularly convincing; their
flirtation was never overly serious,
but the love scenes were passionate,
as were the fights.
The character parts, such as Lady
Billows (Barbara Detrick-Swedlow),
the elderly autocrat, and Mr. Upfold
(Ravil Atlas), the mayor, comple
mented each other. Atlas' sideways
shuffle evoked the most chuckles, al
though it was overdone in some parts.
Detrick-Swedlow gave a solid show
as the imposing matriarch, but she
lacks the clear enunciation of the
others. (Granted, however, that En
glish is troublesome in operatic sing
ing)
Grant Thompson, portraying the
titular hero, also gives a solid perfor
mance; he is theatrical and he has a
fine voice, but there's nothing ex
traordinary happening to his charac
ter. Part of this may be the direction
of the production — the ac
tors/singers aren't given enough
movement onstage, so that most of
the time they pace, scurry or fling
themselves about the stage.
The scene changes were a particu
lar problem. Britten's interim music is
varied and intriguing musically, but
San Jose does not fill in the visuals.
Between scenes the audience is faced
with one backdrop painted with a
country scene (not wholly attractive,
either). There could have been more
backdrops, or even pantomimes by
the cast.
Yet the comedy is fast-paced and
detailed; the company has fitted
some very funny bits to Britten's
music. When Lady Billow is thinking
about the suggestion for a May King,
for instance, the music swells and
subsides in a quick crescendo. Lady
Billow breathes in similar fashion and
literally billows out of her chair to
proclaim the new tradition of May
King Touches like that make this
production a good one, and worth a
try.
