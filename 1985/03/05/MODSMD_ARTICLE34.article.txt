# Subliminal messages: hype?

Is Paul dead? Does your future lie on the whispering
wind? Do you get sexually excited from pictures of ice
cubes? Do you buy things impulsively when you listen
to Muzak? Do you get compulsions to buy popcorn at
the movies? Do you have an inclination to stop reading
this article?
Over the last couple of decades, there has been a tre
mendous amount of hype in the movie industry and
others in reference to the use of subliminal messages
and "back-masking." Subliminal messages are
messages disguised or blended into the tapestry of an
audio works — video works, too, but these will be dis
cussed later — perhaps by varying the amplitude, pitch
or tempo of the work. Back-masking is simply one
form — perhaps the most used (abused) in the music
industry — of subliminal message-sending achieved by
putting a subliminal message into an audio work back
ward; this means that the message can only be heard in
its normal, forward manner if the work is played back
ward. Some statistics show that although the mind may
not consciously discover any of these secrets, most if
not all of them — backward or forward — are picked
up and processed by the unconscious, ultimately
having an effect on the listener or viewer.
Why would anyone bother to use subliminal
messages? To send foreign-policy suggestions to
foreign countries via satellite during the "David Let
terman Show"? To send candidate suggestions for an
upcoming election to "Leave it to Beaver" fans? Actu
ally, advertisers see tremendous potential for sales of
products by inserting messages or suggestions into
movies, previews, commercials, etc. Some department
store owners who have used a subliminal "do not
steal" message in their background Muzak have re
ported lower incidence of shoplifting. In music, the
predominance of reported uses have been devil
worshipping phrases and chants. In fact, some groups
have even gone so far as to print warnings on their
record labels; a message like, "Warning!! This album
may contain backward recorded material!" seems to be
more of a sales ploy than an actual warning. I think the
exclamation points are what do it.
What about subliminal video messages? Although
the inspiration for this article was the use of subliminal
messages in reference to music, there is an equal if not
greater number of reported offenses in the visual
media. Is Round Table wasting its money or actually
amusing its customers by making napkins with little
shields spelling out "FUN"?

Are audio and video the only possible media?
If the mind can decipher a message on the back of a
song, why can't it decipher a message on the back of a
written work? And having opened up this whole new
possibility, what is the difference between symbolism
in a work and subliminal messages? What about back
ward symbolism? To give a few examples, who is to say
that Robert Frost wasn't actually paid by a State Parks
and Beaches Commission to write "The Road l.ess
Traveled" and "Stopping By the Woods On a Snowy
Evening"? What about backward messages on the
printed page? One of the most blatant offenders is the
word "and." Spelled backward, this seemingly inno-

future lie on the whispering

cent word is actually carrying secret information. Isn't
that what you thing about when you read it as an in
conspicous conjunction? How about the notorious
word "live"? Spelled backward, this word becomes a
word that Brother Jim popularized and condemned on
this campus only a few short weeks ago. A question im
mediately comes to mind. How are we to conclude that
the writer didn't intend the backward meaning of the
backward message? If he did, we run into a cyclic rein
formcement of the original spelling of the word. What
if these reversible words are spoken? A whole new
field of possibilities is opened before us.
So what's the point of this article? Nothing. There
isn't one. In fact, I'm not even going to bother to argue
the scientific facts and data surrounding subliminal
suggestion. If this concept does indeed work, I can't
say that I really appreciate advertisers and rock groups
playing with my mind. In fact, I rather dislike the idea.
What can I do, though? If I don't even know that the
messages are there, how can I complain? Should 1
assume — with a 1984-type paranoia — that sub
liminal messages are always there?
Feel a little light-headed? A little hungry perhaps? I
could be playing with your mind . . . you never know.
Check the article a little more closely if you don't
believe me. Your future may lie on this written page.
