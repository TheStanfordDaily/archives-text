# 'Biloxi Blues' strikes right balance between drama and light comedy
## 
### JUJU CHANG 
Are you a fan of Matthew Broderick or
Neil Simon? This question was asked
repeatedly at "Biloxi Blues," in which the
aforementioned men exhibit their talent as
actor and playwright, respectively.
Broderick plays a convincing "Eugene
Jerome" (Simon's autobiographical charac
ter) in the play, which runs through Saturday
at the Curran Theatre in San Francisco. It's as
though the audience gets a personal glimpse
into this man's life. Eugene comes to life on
stage. It's hard to decide if the magic is in the
soulful script or the performed characteriza
tion, but Simon and Broderick seem to act in
concert on the stage.
This successful team first impressed Broad
way with Simon's "Brighton Beach
Memoirs." In it, Broderick won a Tony for his
portrayal of Eugene Morris Jerome.
"Brighton Beach" told the story of a 14-year
old Eugene growing up dreaming of being a
New York Yankee under the hardships of the
Depression.
This character is recreated in "Biloxi'
Blues." Eugene, now five years older, in the
middle of World War 11, is on his way to basic
training in Biloxi, Miss. The story unfolds
from the pages of Eugene's journal. His three
goals for the war are to lose his virginity, fall
in love and become a writer.

The show employs standard messhall
humor and sadistic-drill-sergeant slapstick.
But in the end, the messages that surface are
far from standard.
Though the play lacks a strong plot, the in
dividual scenes have an internal structure that
allows for fluid movement. In a tense con
frontation, the audience swallows a final
laugh as the over-disciplined drill sergeant
takes on a Jewish intellectual played by Barry
Miller. Miller, who played the psychotic
friend in "Saturday Night Fever" and the dis
turbed comedian in "Fame," shifts from his
role as Broderick's straight man to a serious
commentator on anti-Semitism.
The onstage exchanges between Miller
and Broderick are wonderfully executed. The
actors' senses of timing sharpen the two sides
of the comedic as well as the ironic blade. The
show continually strikes a balance between
drama and comedy. Simon is a master of the
one-liner and can simultaneously lend new
perspective on an ironic situation. The char
acters aren't caricatures; episodes are never
stretched to the ridiculous.
The sober element reappears in dealing
with homosexuality, emotional imbalance and
racism. The attention comes in alternating
shades of light humor and weighty social
criticism.
Before going off to war, which he does
parenthetically at the end of the show.

Eugene successfully loses his virginity and
falls in love (though not with the same person,
mind you), but concedes that he has yet to
become a writer. Eugene, knowing he is in
love, confesses to the audience, "At that mo
ment I knew I wasn t ready to be a writer be
cause 1 could find no words to express how I
felt."
In "Biloxi Blues," Broderick and Simon are
again teamed with director Gene Sax — who
also won a Tony for "Brighton Beach" — to
launch another hit. Though there's no such
thing as a sure thing on Broadway, this vet
eran ensemble comes close; they are
Broadway-bound after this San Francisco en
gagement.
Simon and Broderick followed "Brighton
Beach" with a collaboration on the film "Max
Dugan Returns." Broderick, however, is
probably best known for his portrayal of a
young computer hacker who comes close to
touching off global thermonuclear war in the
1983 box-office hit, "War Games."
Neil Simon's notable works on screen in
clude "California Suite," "Barefoot in the
Park," "Seems Like Old Times" and"The
Goodbye Girl." Simon's consistency as a
playwright has been continually applauded.
His Broadway hits, including "The Odd
Couple," "They're Playing Our Song" and"I
Ought To Be in Pictures," rank him among
42nd Street's finest.
