# 'His Royal Badness' embodies sexuality
## Prince's incessant mixture of sex and religion, though, becomes tiring, and he falls short as a philosopher 
### TODD RAMMING Staff writer 
"Do you ever look up at me and say, 'That fool's got a
problem?' " asked Prince. "Well, I got news for you,
honey. We all got that same problem," he responded
defiantly Friday night before a crowd of 12,000 at the
Cow Palace in Daly City, where Prince and the Revolu
tion are finishing a sold-out six-night production tonight.
Prince's current American tour follows in the wake of
his successful motion picture, "Purple Rain," and Prince's
popularity is burning at fever level. Fans who came only to
hear the band's hits did not go away disappointed.
Opening with "Let's Go Crazy" from the "Purple Rain"
soundtrack, Prince mixed lesser-known selections from
his earlier albums with such popular tunes as "Little Red
Corvette," "1999," "I Would Die 4 U" and, of course,
"Purple Rain."
The stage set of speakers, platforms, tunnels, hydraulic
lifts and free-standing poles served as an elaborate play
ground for Prince. Disappearing in a cloud of smoke,
Prince would reappear elsewhere in a flood of lights and
sound.
Reinterpretations of songs and a second bank of
speakers at the rear of the building took advantage of the
inevitable echoing effects of the rectangular auditorium.
Overall musical quality, however, was unfortunately im
paired.
Nonetheless, squirming along the stage, baring his chest
and openly taunting the audience, the master showman
filled each song with such sexual intensity that it seems a
miracle he could repeat the performance night after night.
Upon inviting the audience to take a bath, Prince
climbed into a steam-filled tub which had risen from the
stage. Phosphorescent green strands in a vaguely feminine
form descended upon Prince as the music grew louder and
louder with a pounding beat.
As with the "Purple Rain" movie, however, the concert
served only in part as a showcase for Prince's dynamic
stage presence. Much of the two-hour performance
focused on the personality of the reclusive Prince.
In "Purple Rain," Prince's examination of his own
confused life was interesting and at times compelling. Un
fortunately, Prince's personality is not as multifaceted as

David Bowie's or Roger Waters', and his continuous in
trospection has worn thin.
"I'm so confused," bewailed Prince as the gaze of God,
in the form of a spotlight, fell upon him. "Do not be
confused. There is only one Lord — Jesus," answered an
anonymous female voice. Promising to God that he would
be good, Prince then asked the audience to join him in
bed as soon as God had turned away his gaze.
Prince's incessant mixture of sex and religion, though
intriguing at first, quickly grew tiring. "Love and lust both
have four letters but they are completely different words,"
declared Prince in one of his more profound moments.
"They dig it when I'm bad," Prince quite rightly told
his spotlight God, for as a personification of unrestrained
sexual passion on stage, Prince has few equals. His energy
was a thrill to behold, as he entirely immersed himself in
the intensity of the moment.
When Prince tried to step back from the scene and
analyze his desires, the previous excitement came quickly
to an end, leaving the audience with trite sayings and ideas
verging on the ridiculous.
Sheila E., who opened the show, tried to copy the
genuine sexual intensity of Prince. Take, for example, the
extended scene in which Sheila E. invited a member from
the audience on stage and promptly acted to seduce him.
Her appeals to the audience's libido were on the level of
sexual innuendo one hears at a fraternity party. Quite
unlike Prince, Sheila E. at no time appeared really to be
experiencing the sexual feelings she portrayed. The singer
was afraid to put herself truly into the scene. Always
remaining cautiously one step back, she was merely acting
the sex-symbol role, and badly at that. Sheila E. was
indeed foolish to try to copy the genuine sexual intensity
of Prince.
In his current show, Prince, although failing as philoso
pher, is a marvelous personification of the power and in
tensity of human sexuality. His music, both the hits and
the lesser-known material, is highly entertaining and en
joyable. Despite the weakness of Sheila E. and some
tedious moments of introspection in the main show, an
evening with Prince is worth the $17.50 ticket price.


For $17.50 a shot, 12,000 people turned out Friday to hear Prince play the Cow Palace in Daly City. This
evening the star of the 1984 film "Purple Rain" is slated to finish six nights of sold-out concerts.

his successful motion picture, "Purple Rain," and Prince's
popularity is burning at fever level. Fans who came only to
hear the band's hits did not go away disappointed.
Opening with "Let's Go Crazy" from the "Purple Rain"
soundtrack, Prince mixed lesser-known selections from
his earlier albums with such popular tunes as "Little Red
Corvette," "1999," "I Would Die 4 U" and, of course,
"Purple Rain."
The stage set of speakers, platforms, tunnels, hydraulic
lifts and free-standing poles served as an elaborate play
ground for Prince. Disappearing in a cloud of smoke,
Prince would reappear elsewhere in a flood of lights and
sound.
Reinterpretations of songs and a second bank of
speakers at the rear of the building took advantage of the
inevitable echoing effects of the rectangular auditorium.
Overall musical quality, however, was unfortunately im
paired.
Nonetheless, squirming along the stage, baring his chest
and openly taunting the audience, the master showman
filled each song with such sexual intensity that it seems a
miracle he could repeat the performance night after night.
Upon inviting the audience to take a bath, Prince
climbed into a steam-filled tub which had risen from the
stage. Phosphorescent green strands in a vaguely feminine
form descended upon Prince as the music grew louder and
louder with a pounding beat.
As with the "Purple Rain" movie, however, the concert
served only in part as a showcase for Prince's dynamic
stage presence. Much of the two-hour performance
focused on the personality of the reclusive Prince.
In "Purple Rain," Prince's examination of his own
confused life was interesting and at times compelling. Un
fortunately, Prince's personality is not as multifaceted as

David Bowie's or Roger Waters', and his continuous in
trospection has worn thin.
"I'm so confused," bewailed Prince as the gaze of God,
in the form of a spotlight, fell upon him. "Do not be
confused. There is only one Lord — Jesus," answered an
anonymous female voice. Promising to God that he would
be good, Prince then asked the audience to join him in
bed as soon as God had turned away his gaze.
Prince's incessant mixture of sex and religion, though
intriguing at first, quickly grew tiring. "Love and lust both
have four letters but they are completely different words,"
declared Prince in one of his more profound moments.
"They dig it when I'm bad," Prince quite rightly told
his spotlight God, for as a personification of unrestrained
sexual passion on stage, Prince has few equals. His energy
was a thrill to behold, as he entirely immersed himself in
the intensity of the moment.
When Prince tried to step back from the scene and
analyze his desires, the previous excitement came quickly
to an end, leaving the audience with trite sayings and ideas
verging on the ridiculous.
Sheila E., who opened the show, tried to copy the
genuine sexual intensity of Prince. Take, for example, the
extended scene in which Sheila E. invited a member from
the audience on stage and promptly acted to seduce him.
Her appeals to the audience's libido were on the level of
sexual innuendo one hears at a fraternity party. Quite
unlike Prince, Sheila E. at no time appeared really to be
experiencing the sexual feelings she portrayed. The singer
was afraid to put herself truly into the scene. Always
remaining cautiously one step back, she was merely acting
the sex-symbol role, and badly at that. Sheila E. was
indeed foolish to try to copy the genuine sexual intensity
of Prince.
In his current show, Prince, although failing as philoso
pher, is a marvelous personification of the power and in
tensity of human sexuality. His music, both the hits and
the lesser-known material, is highly entertaining and en
joyable. Despite the weakness of Sheila E. and some
tedious moments of introspection in the main show, an
evening with Prince is worth the $17.50 ticket price.


For $17.50 a shot, 12,000 people turned out Friday to hear Prince play the Cow Palace in Daly City. This
evening the star of the 1984 film "Purple Rain" is slated to finish six nights of sold-out concerts.
