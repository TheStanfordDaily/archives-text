## Stanford Press looks ahead to expansion 
### BARBARA SCHULER Staff writer 
In response to concerns about its
financial future and "its neglect of
various areas in the humanities," the
Stanford Press plans to expand into
three new areas of specialization and
more than double its annual output
by 1986, Director Grant Barnes told
the Faculty Senate recently.
The first report to the senate by a
member of the Stanford Press in 17
years came just over a year after
Barnes' arrival at Stanford from the
University of California Press.
According to Barnes' projections,
the press will be publishing at an an
nual rate of about 60 new titles by the
end of next year, adding literary the
ory, psychology and sociology to the
list of fields in which it concentrates.
By making a concerted push in
several new disciplines, the Stanford
Press would jump from its current
standing as 35th in size among U.S.
university presses to somewhere
near 17th, "still well behind Ne
braska, Louisiana State and North
Carolina," said Barnes.
Chicago, California, Harvard,
Princeton and Yale — the five major
university presses — boast outputs
averaging "well over" 100 titles each
year, Barnes told the senate. Their in
ventories of previously published
titles, or "backlists," likewise dwarf
Stanford's.
Stanford currently has about 750
active books on its backlist, Barnes
told The Daily. He compared that
with more than 3,000 at the Univer
sity of California and more than
3,500 at the University of Chicago to
give some sense of the strides he
would like to see Stanford make.
Building up a larger backlist, an in
evitable result of growth, not only
brings a press greater prestige but
also serves as an important revenue
base.

Citing some concerns that led to
these changes, Barnes said, "For the
size of our staff, we have not been
publishing enough. Thirty-five people
were on staff when I arrived in 1983,
publishing 15 to 28 books per
year. . . . That loads too much over
head cost onto every title produced.
It provides services for too few auth
ors. It results in publishing actively
in too few fields. We have been less
available to our own faculty than we
should be."
Despite the proposed changes,
concerns about the financial viability
of the press persist. Since the disman
tling of the campus printing plant,
which "in effect subsidized the
publishing operations of the press,"
the press has relied upon the annual
allocation of a University subsidy, ac
cording to Barnes.
Describing the University's
response to his plans as "generous,"
Barnes said the press has been
granted an increased subsidy to ab
sorb the losses expansion will cause.
"The University has decided ... to
give us a bit of breathing room for the
next few years while we make
changes in our program and in our
style. Year by year, they'll look at the
results and either nod their heads or
shake their heads," he said.
Although he appreciates the Uni
versity's support, Barnes wants a
firmer commitment. The press needs
either a "relatively permanent com
mitment to a subsidized operation,"
or, ideally, an endowment similar to
the one which established Harvard's
Belknap Press, he told the senate.
The Belknap Press "has become Har
vard's chief means of financing schol
arly books with small sales potential."
Barnes has requested that the Uni
versity's Office of Development in
clude this appeal in its Centennial
Fund drive. He was careful to add
that "our proposal is not necessarily

in competition with other needs of
the University," explaining that "for
some, books are in effect sacred ob

jects. . .. There may be some people
who would not be eager to have their
name on a building, . . . but who

would gladly support the publication
of our books."
Currently, the press is considered
"an auxilliary enterprise and (is) ex
pected to break even," Barnes said.
According to Norris Pope, assistant
director and chief financial officer at
the press, this expectation is unrealis
tic.
"It's misleading to think of the
press as essentially a business. Essen
tially university press publishing is a
subsidized source of publishing that
ensures that the very best scholarly
information — which is not always
very saleable — gets into print," he
said.
In such areas as Asian and Latin
American studies, Stanford Press has
accomplished this task without paral
lel in the industry, Barnes said. "But
we have published infrequently in
areas of literature, other than Russian
and Japanese. . ..
"We have done quite a lot of work
in political science and are strong also
in anthropology, but we do virtually
nothing in sociology and psychology
and very little in economics," he said.
Attempts to redress some of these
shortcomings include several new ed
itorial appointments. The promotion
of former copy editor Helen Tartar
to the position of senior editor in the
humanities has "already made a
remarkable impact," according to
Academic Secretary Clara Bush, pro
fessor of linguistics.
Tartar "has proved a magnet to
authors working in avant garde areas
of literary criticism and theory,"
Barnes told the senate.
Regarding the role of the press and
the direction of its expansion, Tartar
said, "1 feel very much that it's our
ethical duty to be more yin than yang,
to be receptive. We try to be actively
nurturing, but we're listening to cur
rents. We're listening to the wishes of
the faculty and to the intellectual cur

rents of our time. One doesn't decide
in vacuo to go into a field. We try to
pick up on it and fit into it.
English Prof. Herbert
Lindenberger, editorial board chair
man for the press, has abetted Tartar
and other editors in the search for
new works. Appointed largely be
cause of his strong interest in the
status of the humanities at Stanford,
Lindenberger has provided an impor
tant link between the press and Uni
versity faculty.
Barnes' Feb. 21 talk marked a
change in the historically distant rela
tionship between the press and the
faculty. "They (the press) kept to
themselves," Lindenberger said.
"Now, under Grant, they are not only
trying to expand but to create an
image for the press as being more
receptive."
Barnes acknowledged that the
"curious mix of diffidence and pride"
characteristic of the former leader
ship did not square with planned
growth. The press was "diffident
about soliciting new work, or compet
ing for it with other publishers; the
idea of traveling to other universities,
or even walking across campus to ap
proach our own best scholars, was
somehow infra dig" he said.
While other university presses have
long been "hustling" to search out
and secure promising manuscripts,
said Lindenberger, "Stanford has just
started ... to compete in that particu
lar style."
Tartar tried to put the recent an
nouncement of the press's expansion
into perspective, saying, "The press
doesn't want to treat this as some
kind of weird break with our past.
Editors tend to be catholic if not
openly dilettantish . . . we've always
been open to books from faculty in
diverse disciplines." What is new is
how the press has chosen to "direct
that openness," she said.

year. . . . That loads too much over
head cost onto every title produced.
It provides services for too few auth
ors. It results in publishing actively
in too few fields. We have been less
available to our own faculty than we
should be."
Despite the proposed changes,
concerns about the financial viability
of the press persist. Since the disman
tling of the campus printing plant,
which "in effect subsidized the
publishing operations of the press,"
the press has relied upon the annual
allocation of a University subsidy, ac
cording to Barnes.
Describing the University's
response to his plans as "generous,"
Barnes said the press has been
granted an increased subsidy to ab
sorb the losses expansion will cause.
"The University has decided ... to
give us a bit of breathing room for the
next few years while we make
changes in our program and in our
style. Year by year, they'll look at the
results and either nod their heads or
shake their heads," he said.
Although he appreciates the Uni
versity's support, Barnes wants a
firmer commitment. The press needs
either a "relatively permanent com
mitment to a subsidized operation,"
or, ideally, an endowment similar to
the one which established Harvard's
Belknap Press, he told the senate.
The Belknap Press "has become Har
vard's chief means of financing schol
arly books with small sales potential."
Barnes has requested that the Uni
versity's Office of Development in
clude this appeal in its Centennial
Fund drive. He was careful to add
that "our proposal is not necessarily

in competition with other needs of
the University," explaining that "for
some, books are in effect sacred ob

jects. . .. There may be some people
who would not be eager to have their
name on a building, . . . but who

would gladly support the publication
of our books."
Currently, the press is considered
"an auxilliary enterprise and (is) ex
pected to break even," Barnes said.
According to Norris Pope, assistant
director and chief financial officer at
the press, this expectation is unrealis
tic.
"It's misleading to think of the
press as essentially a business. Essen
tially university press publishing is a
subsidized source of publishing that
ensures that the very best scholarly
information — which is not always
very saleable — gets into print," he
said.
In such areas as Asian and Latin
American studies, Stanford Press has
accomplished this task without paral
lel in the industry, Barnes said. "But
we have published infrequently in
areas of literature, other than Russian
and Japanese. . ..
"We have done quite a lot of work
in political science and are strong also
in anthropology, but we do virtually
nothing in sociology and psychology
and very little in economics," he said.
Attempts to redress some of these
shortcomings include several new ed
itorial appointments. The promotion
of former copy editor Helen Tartar
to the position of senior editor in the
humanities has "already made a
remarkable impact," according to
Academic Secretary Clara Bush, pro
fessor of linguistics.
Tartar "has proved a magnet to
authors working in avant garde areas
of literary criticism and theory,"
Barnes told the senate.
Regarding the role of the press and
the direction of its expansion, Tartar
said, "1 feel very much that it's our
ethical duty to be more yin than yang,
to be receptive. We try to be actively
nurturing, but we're listening to cur
rents. We're listening to the wishes of
the faculty and to the intellectual cur

rents of our time. One doesn't decide
in vacuo to go into a field. We try to
pick up on it and fit into it.
English Prof. Herbert
Lindenberger, editorial board chair
man for the press, has abetted Tartar
and other editors in the search for
new works. Appointed largely be
cause of his strong interest in the
status of the humanities at Stanford,
Lindenberger has provided an impor
tant link between the press and Uni
versity faculty.
Barnes' Feb. 21 talk marked a
change in the historically distant rela
tionship between the press and the
faculty. "They (the press) kept to
themselves," Lindenberger said.
"Now, under Grant, they are not only
trying to expand but to create an
image for the press as being more
receptive."
Barnes acknowledged that the
"curious mix of diffidence and pride"
characteristic of the former leader
ship did not square with planned
growth. The press was "diffident
about soliciting new work, or compet
ing for it with other publishers; the
idea of traveling to other universities,
or even walking across campus to ap
proach our own best scholars, was
somehow infra dig" he said.
While other university presses have
long been "hustling" to search out
and secure promising manuscripts,
said Lindenberger, "Stanford has just
started ... to compete in that particu
lar style."
Tartar tried to put the recent an
nouncement of the press's expansion
into perspective, saying, "The press
doesn't want to treat this as some
kind of weird break with our past.
Editors tend to be catholic if not
openly dilettantish . . . we've always
been open to books from faculty in
diverse disciplines." What is new is
how the press has chosen to "direct
that openness," she said.

Stanford Press Director Grant Barnes has announced plans to expand
the press, more than doubling annual output by 1986.
In response to concerns about its
financial future and "its neglect of
various areas in the humanities," the
Stanford Press plans to expand into
three new areas of specialization and
more than double its annual output
by 1986, Director Grant Barnes told
the Faculty Senate recently.
The first report to the senate by a
member of the Stanford Press in 17
years came just over a year after
Barnes' arrival at Stanford from the
University of California Press.
According to Barnes' projections,
the press will be publishing at an an
nual rate of about 60 new titles by the
end of next year, adding literary the
ory, psychology and sociology to the
list of fields in which it concentrates.
By making a concerted push in
several new disciplines, the Stanford
Press would jump from its current
standing as 35th in size among U.S.
university presses to somewhere
near 17th, "still well behind Ne
braska, Louisiana State and North
Carolina," said Barnes.
Chicago, California, Harvard,
Princeton and Yale — the five major
university presses — boast outputs
averaging "well over" 100 titles each
year, Barnes told the senate. Their in
ventories of previously published
titles, or "backlists," likewise dwarf
Stanford's.
Stanford currently has about 750
active books on its backlist, Barnes
told The Daily. He compared that
with more than 3,000 at the Univer
sity of California and more than
3,500 at the University of Chicago to
give some sense of the strides he
would like to see Stanford make.
Building up a larger backlist, an in
evitable result of growth, not only
brings a press greater prestige but
also serves as an important revenue
base.

Citing some concerns that led to
these changes, Barnes said, "For the
size of our staff, we have not been
publishing enough. Thirty-five people
were on staff when I arrived in 1983,
publishing 15 to 28 books per
year. . . . That loads too much over
head cost onto every title produced.
It provides services for too few auth
ors. It results in publishing actively
in too few fields. We have been less
available to our own faculty than we
should be."
