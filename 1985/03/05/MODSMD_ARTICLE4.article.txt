# Petition urges no contra aid
## 
### DAVID RISSER Senior staff writer 
During the past 10 days, more than
180 Stanford faculty and administra
tors have signed a petition that calls
on the U.S. government to withdraw
all support for the contras fighting in
Nicaragua and to "return to a moral
and legal policy that pursues
diplomatic solutions and respects rule
of law."
The United States should ter
minate support "for any action which
aims to destabilize or overthrow the
government of Nicaragua," according
to the petition. It urges the govern
ment to honor and support the Con
tadora process.
The petition will be sent to local
congressional representatives and
California's senators, Democrat Alan
Cranston and Republican Pete Wil
son, in an effort to influence upcom
ing votes on aid to the contras.
A prominent Reagan administra
tion official said last week that the ad
ministration lacks the votes in the
House to win approval of the $14
million it seeks in aid to the rebels.
There is currently a congressional
prohibition on aid to the rebels.
In addition to the critical congres
sional decisions to be made this

month, the International Court of
Justice will soon hear charges brought
by Nicaragua that the United States is
waging an illegal war. The petition
urges the U.S. government to
"recognize the jurisdiction of the In
ternational Court in its pending litiga
tion. . . . The unprecedented decision
to boycott proceedings of that
tribunal is cause for alarm for those of
us who advocate diplomatic and
juridical solutions to conflict and ad
herence to established laws."
Leonard Boudin, a visiting law pro
fessor, is particularly concerned with
the legality of U.S. policy. "The fact
that the case has political considera
tions does not relieve the Interna
tional Court of jurisdiction. (The
Reagan administration's) attempt to
withdraw from litigation in the Inter
national Court is completely without
justification in international law," he
said.
The Stanford petition drive was
spearheaded by Boudin and a core
group called the Faculty Committee
on Nicaragua. Members of the Stan
ford Central American Action Net
work (SCAAN) have offered logisti
cal support.
"The response has been over
whelmingly positive," said Carol
Baume, a doctoral student on the
Stanford International Development
Education Committee (SIDEC) and
a member of SCAAN. "It's amazing
how many people are willing to
declare publicly that they don't sup
port the current U.S. policy in
Nicaragua," she said.
Similar petition drives are receiving
support on other college campuses.
According to UC-Berkeley Prof.

Pravin Varaiya, a petition calling for
an end of aid to the contras evoked a
great response on that campus, send
ing "scores" of signatures to local
congressmen and members of con
gressional committees.
Petitions have also been generated
among faculty at Harvard and MIT,
and a petition is now being circulated
to Nobel laureates.
Economics Prof. Kenneth Arrow
has signed both the Stanford and the
Nobel petitions. "The (Reagan) ad
ministration is doing everthing possi
ble to avoid any peaceful resolution,"
he said. "U.S. policy doesn't even
seem to be coherent."
While the Reagan administration

justifies its support of the contras
with evidence that Nicaragua is ex
porting revolution to its neighbors,
Arrow said he sees "no evidence of
aggression against neighboring
countries. . .. The imperfections in
Nicaraguan democracy pale to the
number of (imperfections) in govern
ments we support," he said.
Salvador Luria, a Nobel winner at
MIT, has also signed the laureate pe
tition. "I'm concerned about asking
Congress not to support any attack,
overt or covert, on Nicaragua," he
said.
Arrow predicts that U.S. citizens
will not stand for direct intervention
in Nicaragua. "The administration

can't even get a majority in Congress
for covert aid," he said.
"We want to reinforce what public
opinion polls show â€” widespread op
position to the aid," Varaiya said.
Boudin, who said he does not
usually engage in political activity on
campuses, compares the need to
speak today with the need to resort to
political activity during the Vietnam
War.
"We have always had a bad ap
proach to the Southern Hemisphere.
This administration has been much
worse than any in my history. Some
day the American people will speak
out. Maybe this will be that time,"
Boudin said.
