# Petition urges no contra aid
## 
### DAVID RISSER Senior staff writer 
During the past 10 days, more than
180 Stanford faculty and administra
tors have signed a petition that calls
on the U.S. government to withdraw
all support for the contras fighting in
Nicaragua and to "return to a moral
and legal policy that pursues
diplomatic solutions and respects rule
of law."
The United States should ter
minate support "for any action which
aims to destabilize or overthrow the
government of Nicaragua," according
to the petition. It urges the govern
ment to honor and support the Con
tadora process.
The petition will be sent to local
congressional representatives and
California's senators, Democrat Alan
Cranston and Republican Pete Wil
son, in an effort to influence upcom
ing votes on aid to the contras.
A prominent Reagan administra
tion official said last week that the ad
ministration lacks the votes in the
House to win approval of the $14
million it seeks in aid to the rebels.
There is currently a congressional
prohibition on aid to the rebels.
In addition to the critical congres
sional decisions to be made this

month, the International Court of
Justice will soon hear charges brought
by Nicaragua that the United States is
waging an illegal war. The petition
urges the U.S. government to
"recognize the jurisdiction of the In
ternational Court in its pending litiga
tion. . . . The unprecedented decision
to boycott proceedings of that
tribunal is cause for alarm for those of
us who advocate diplomatic and
juridical solutions to conflict and ad
herence to established laws."
Leonard Boudin, a visiting law pro
fessor, is particularly concerned with
the legality of U.S. policy. "The fact
that the case has political considera
tions does not relieve the Interna
tional Court of jurisdiction. (The
Reagan administration's) attempt to
withdraw from litigation in the Inter
national Court is completely without
justification in international law," he
said.
The Stanford petition drive was
spearheaded by Boudin and a core
group called the Faculty Committee
on Nicaragua. Members of the Stan
ford Central American Action Net
work (SCAAN) have offered logisti
cal support.
