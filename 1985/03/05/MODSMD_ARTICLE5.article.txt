# Measles problem shouldn't affect Stanford

Health authorities here say they do
not expect recent outbreaks of
measles at some college campuses to
affect Stanford.
As of Friday, 56 cases of the poten
tially life-threatening disease were
handled at Boston University, ac
cording to Roxanne Hurley, BU's as
sociate director of public relations.
Students and spectators at the school
have been barred from all public
events in an attempt to contain the
outbreak.
Similarly, Principia College in Fl
sah. 111., has set up an isolation ward
for the 7.4 percent of its student
population who have the measles.
The voluntary quarantine, which has
prevented students from leaving the
campus since Feb. 22, will be lifted
tomorrow for "those students who
have met the requirements of health
authorities," said a statement
released yesterday.
Principia students not meeting
these requirements by the beginning
of spring break will be asked to
remain on campus until they can be
cleared by health officials. The col
lege has planned various activities to
keep the grounded students occupied.
Carol Huntley, administrative as

sistant to the Principia's dean, was
hesitant to connect three recent stu
dent deaths there to the disease, but
she admitted the possibility was being
investigated and that the school is
"deeply concerned" about the
deaths.
"The contagion of fear is as much a

factor as anything else. Frankly,
we've had to deal with quite a lot of it
since the first passing of a Principia
student," according to the statement.
Officials at both schools said they
feel the outbreaks are beginning to
level off, crediting measures taken to
keep the measles from spreading. In

novations provided by the Boston
Department of Health and Hospitals
were administered to 4,000 BU stu
dents. Three immunization clinics
have been set up on Principia's
campus.
The probability that any measles
epidemic will spread to Stanford has

been limited by the immunization
procedures initiated in fall 1983 for
incoming freshmen, according to
John Dorman, associate director of
Cowell Student Health Center. If stu
dents don't meet the proper immuni
zation standards, then a medical hold
is placed on PTRs until they do so.
Neither BU nor Principia require
students to be immunized or show
proof of immunization, although the
outbreak at BU may spur state law
for some sort of immunization stan
dard like Stanford's, officials there
said.
Other less serious measles out
breaks have occurred at MIT, Ober
lin College and Ohio State Univer
sity. Of the three, only Oberlin re
quires proof of immunization upon
registration.
But Dorman said he feels that such
outbreaks at colleges will only be a
hazard for a few more years. Anyone
born before 1957 has probably been
exposed to the wild strain of the
disease, and those born after 1967
have probably been immunized as in
fants with "good" vaccine.
Those people born between 1957
and 1967 are the most susceptible to
the disease, as they may have been
given the inactivated vaccine, which is
now deemed ineffective.
