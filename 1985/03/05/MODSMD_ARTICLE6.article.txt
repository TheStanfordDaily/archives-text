## University drafts construction safety policy 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
Since a Stanford professor first expressed concern
over safety hazards at campus construction sites nearly
nine months ago. the University has developed the ini
tial draft of "an affirmative action policy" on construc
tion safety standards
According to Kent Peterson, associate vice president
of Business and Finance, the policy draft includes gen
eral suggestions on safety standards for both outside
contractors and the University's own employees.
Peterson said work on the safety policy began "a
month or so ago" after the urging of several faculty
members. According to Peterson, the policy will be
handed to Raymond Levitt, professor of civil engineer
ing. who brought the safety issue to the attention of
Facilities Project Management in May.
Peterson said the University would "like (Levitt's)
advice" on the policy before passing it on to University
President Donald Kennedy for final approval.
Curtis Williams, engineering manager at Facilities
Project Management, said the draft is the product of a
joint effort by the offices of Health and Safety. Project
Management and Risk Mangement. Peterson has been
commissioned to write the policy statement.
Williams said the document is "a couple of months"
from completion, adding that at this time the statement
is very general and "doesn't go into specifics."

Levitt met with University officials in August to dis
cuss his concern about campus construction projects,
which he alleged to be in violation of state and federal
safety regulations. In November, Levitt told The Daily
that the University was "dicing with fate, waiting for a
serious injury."
He pointed to several violations, including trenches
and large holes without sufficient barricades behind
Terman Engineering Center and on Panama Street,
workers without hard hats, and trucks and other
vehicles that move in reverse without an alarm sound.
Since Levitt's initial charges, the University has in
stituted a "much more aggressive" policy when choos
ing contractors, Williams said.
Bob Beth, director of Risk Management, said the
University first looks at an "experience-modification
factor" prepared by insurance companies that evaluate
a construction firm's past safety performance.
Beth said the University is "most anxious to see that
construction companies do their work safely," adding
that "when they get sued, we get sued." In addition to
worker safety, Beth said the Universtiy is concerned
with property safety, noting that floods can occur when
a water main is struck during excavation.
Beth said continuing work on a campus-wide tele
communications project is "certainly a potential
threat" to the safety of the Stanford community.
