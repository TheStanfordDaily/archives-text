Soviets warn West Germany
MOSCOW — The Soviet Union yesterday warned West Germany
against taking part in President Reagan's program to build space weap
ons, saying the "Star Wars' plan could torpedo the upcoming super
power arms talks.
Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko, in four hours of talks with his
West German counterpart, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, said the Kremlin
would view the Bonn government as "an accomplice" in violating the
1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty if it helped develop the Star Wars
weapons, the Soviet news agency Tass reported.
After the meeting, Genscher told a Moscow news conference the
U.S.-Soviet talks scheduled to begin March 12 in Geneva, Switzerland,
"could open a new chapter in East-West relations."
But th« West German minister held out little hope that new arms
» would be achieved swiftly.
Geoscher's visit to Moscow had been hastily arranged. Just a few
houoi before he left Bonn on Sunday for a previously scheduled trip to
Fitpnd, it was announced he would be making a stopover in the Soviet
capital. Asked about this yesterday, he said only that both sides had
<£emed it a good opportunity to continue dialogue.
Gromyko chose to make the meeting a forum for once again attacking
the Star Wars — or Strategic Defense Initiative — proposals for devel
oping space-based defenses againsfoffensive missiles.
In recent weeks, Kremlin officials have mounted a campaign against
the U.S. program, visiting Western capitals and repeatedly denouncing
the Reagan plan in the Soviet media.
U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said last month Washing
ton would welcome West Germany's help in developing the advanced
missile defenses. The West Germans say they have received no concrete
invitation to take part.
Blast in Lebanon mosque kills 12
BEIRUT, Lebanon — An explosion ripped through a mosque yester
day in the Shia Moslem town of Maarake in southern Lebanon, killing at
least 12 people and injuring 15 others at a prayer meeting, a United Na
tions official reported.
Bodies of 11 adults and a small child were recovered from the
mosque, the second floor of which was the worst hit, said the U.N. repre
sentative, Timur Goksel.
Israeli radio said seven of the 15 injured persons were severely hurt,
and two of them were members of the Shia Amal Militia.
U.N. and Red Cross rescue teams were searching the rubble feverishly
for more victims.
A military spokesman in Jerusalem denied Beirut reports that Israeli
forces were responsible for the blast.
"There were no Israeli soldiers in the vicinity of this village Monday,"
the spokesman said. Goksel also said he had seen no Israeli forces there.
Maarake, five miles edst of the port city of Tyre, was the scene Satur
day of the largest Israeli raid against alleged resistance locations carried
out under Israel's "iron fist" policy.
Some 800 Israeli soldiers had stormed and searched the community in
an action in which one man died and four persons were wounded. Seven
teen suspects were arrested.
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres and Defense Minister Itzhak
Rabin yesterday defended the "iron fist" policy.
In a visit to the southern Israeli port city of Eilat, Peres said the secur
ity of withdrawing Israeli troops took priority over possible negative im
plications from the policy.
Quake aftermath: homeless, looting
SANTIAGO, Chile — Thousands of people camppd in debris-strewn
streets yesterday, driven from their homes by aftershocks of a major *
earthquake that killed at least 135 people and injured 2,000 in central
Chile. Authorities imposed a curfew to stop looting.
The quake crumbled the front section of a Roman Catholic church in
San Bernardo, just outside the capital, killing 10 people who were at
tending a Sunday evening Mass. Four people perished when the roof
caved in at a small Methodist church in Valparaiso, 60 miles northwest
of Santagio.
Powerful tremors knocked down walls, cut communications and
swayed skyscrapers in Santiago and other cities along an 800-mile zone.
The death count was increased again last night when 11 more bodies
were found in the rubble of collapsed buildings, and officials said they
expected the toll to rise as communications were restored and reports
came in from outlying towns,
Francisco Cuadra, chief spokesman for the military government, an
nounced the' higher death toll and said the number of injured remained
at about 2,000. He estimated that 4,900 homes were destroyed and
21,000 damaged.
Authorities said the hardest-hit areas outside Santiago were Val
paraiso and Vina del Mar, coastal cities in this narrow country that
stretches 2,600 miles along South America's western shore. The three
cities have a combined population of about 6 million.
Hawke: Treaty no longer effective
CANBERRA, Australia — The 30-year-old Australian, New
Zealand and United States defense alliance now exists "only in name,"
Australian Prime Minister Robert Hawke told a news conference here
* yesterday.
Earlier, Hawke's government had announced that the net conference
of ANZUS foreign and defense ministers, scheduled for July in Can
berra, had been canceled.
Hawke based his government's decision on the rupture of military
cooperation between the United States and New Zealand. This resulted
from the Jatter's refusal to permit U.S. warships with nuclear
propulsion or nuclear arms to use the country's ports.
Hawke said that as a three-country alliance, the ANZUS pact was no
longer effective, and Australia now had "to do everything to guarantee
the interests of our national security."
He added that this would be done by building up Australian bilateral
defense cooperation not only with the United States but with New
Zealand.
In Wellington, the capital of New Zealand, cancellation of the
ANZUS ministerial conference was noted with regret.
But according to acting Prime Minister Geoffrey Palmer, nothing had
really changed, and he regarded he cancellation more as a
"postponement" to give the dust a chance to settle.
He said that despite differences with Washington over entry to New
Zealand's ports, Wellington continued to be a loyal U.S. ally. ,
Guatemala may get civilian leader
GUATEMALA CITY — Guatemala, which has been ruled by the
military since the retirement of President Julio Cesar Mendez Mon
tenegro 15 years ago, may soon have a civilian head of state once
again.
The head of the military government, Gen. Oscar Humberto Mejia
Victores, has announced general elections for Oct. 27 of this year.
The popularly elected president is to be inaugurated Jan. 14, with the
new parliament to start its work one month earlier.
If all this takes place, Guatemala will be following in the path of other
Latin American states which have in recent years replaced their military
regimes with civilian rule.
It would also increase the chances for an end to the country's interna
tional isolation brought about by violations of human rights.
The United States has welcomed the democratization plans.
The armed forces of Central America's most populous state had used
dubious methods to facilitate the presidential elections of three high
ranking officers since 1970.
The fourth case of ballot-rigging, in 1982, was so blatant that it upset
not only the political parties but also some of the military.
As a result. Gen. Efrain Rios Montt, a religious zealot, took power in
a March 1982 coup. But he, in turn, was ousted in August 1983 by Mejia
Victores, who has now opened the way for a return to democracy.
The conservative National Liberation Movement (MLN), the Na
tional Center Union (UCN) and the Christian Democratic Party (FDC)
are the main groups in the constitutional assembly elected in July 1984,
and their candidates arc regarded as favorites in the presidential race.

Quake aftermath: homeless, looting
SANTIAGO, Chile — Thousands of people camppd in debris-strewn
streets yesterday, driven from their homes by aftershocks of a major *
earthquake that killed at least 135 people and injured 2,000 in central
Chile. Authorities imposed a curfew to stop looting.
The quake crumbled the front section of a Roman Catholic church in
San Bernardo, just outside the capital, killing 10 people who were at
tending a Sunday evening Mass. Four people perished when the roof
caved in at a small Methodist church in Valparaiso, 60 miles northwest
of Santagio.
Powerful tremors knocked down walls, cut communications and
swayed skyscrapers in Santiago and other cities along an 800-mile zone.
The death count was increased again last night when 11 more bodies
were found in the rubble of collapsed buildings, and officials said they
expected the toll to rise as communications were restored and reports
came in from outlying towns,
Francisco Cuadra, chief spokesman for the military government, an
nounced the' higher death toll and said the number of injured remained
at about 2,000. He estimated that 4,900 homes were destroyed and
21,000 damaged.
Authorities said the hardest-hit areas outside Santiago were Val
paraiso and Vina del Mar, coastal cities in this narrow country that
stretches 2,600 miles along South America's western shore. The three
cities have a combined population of about 6 million.
Hawke: Treaty no longer effective
CANBERRA, Australia — The 30-year-old Australian, New
Zealand and United States defense alliance now exists "only in name,"
Australian Prime Minister Robert Hawke told a news conference here
* yesterday.
Earlier, Hawke's government had announced that the net conference
of ANZUS foreign and defense ministers, scheduled for July in Can
berra, had been canceled.
Hawke based his government's decision on the rupture of military
cooperation between the United States and New Zealand. This resulted
from the Jatter's refusal to permit U.S. warships with nuclear
propulsion or nuclear arms to use the country's ports.
Hawke said that as a three-country alliance, the ANZUS pact was no
longer effective, and Australia now had "to do everything to guarantee
the interests of our national security."
He added that this would be done by building up Australian bilateral
defense cooperation not only with the United States but with New
Zealand.
In Wellington, the capital of New Zealand, cancellation of the
ANZUS ministerial conference was noted with regret.
But according to acting Prime Minister Geoffrey Palmer, nothing had
really changed, and he regarded he cancellation more as a
"postponement" to give the dust a chance to settle.
He said that despite differences with Washington over entry to New
Zealand's ports, Wellington continued to be a loyal U.S. ally. ,
Guatemala may get civilian leader
GUATEMALA CITY — Guatemala, which has been ruled by the
military since the retirement of President Julio Cesar Mendez Mon
tenegro 15 years ago, may soon have a civilian head of state once
again.
The head of the military government, Gen. Oscar Humberto Mejia
Victores, has announced general elections for Oct. 27 of this year.
The popularly elected president is to be inaugurated Jan. 14, with the
new parliament to start its work one month earlier.
If all this takes place, Guatemala will be following in the path of other
Latin American states which have in recent years replaced their military
regimes with civilian rule.
It would also increase the chances for an end to the country's interna
tional isolation brought about by violations of human rights.
The United States has welcomed the democratization plans.
The armed forces of Central America's most populous state had used
dubious methods to facilitate the presidential elections of three high
ranking officers since 1970.
The fourth case of ballot-rigging, in 1982, was so blatant that it upset
not only the political parties but also some of the military.
As a result. Gen. Efrain Rios Montt, a religious zealot, took power in
a March 1982 coup. But he, in turn, was ousted in August 1983 by Mejia
Victores, who has now opened the way for a return to democracy.
The conservative National Liberation Movement (MLN), the Na
tional Center Union (UCN) and the Christian Democratic Party (FDC)
are the main groups in the constitutional assembly elected in July 1984,
and their candidates arc regarded as favorites in the presidential race.
Soviets warn West Germany
MOSCOW — The Soviet Union yesterday warned West Germany
against taking part in President Reagan's program to build space weap
ons, saying the "Star Wars' plan could torpedo the upcoming super
power arms talks.
Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko, in four hours of talks with his
West German counterpart, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, said the Kremlin
would view the Bonn government as "an accomplice" in violating the
1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty if it helped develop the Star Wars
weapons, the Soviet news agency Tass reported.
After the meeting, Genscher told a Moscow news conference the
U.S.-Soviet talks scheduled to begin March 12 in Geneva, Switzerland,
"could open a new chapter in East-West relations."
But th« West German minister held out little hope that new arms
» would be achieved swiftly.
Geoscher's visit to Moscow had been hastily arranged. Just a few
houoi before he left Bonn on Sunday for a previously scheduled trip to
Fitpnd, it was announced he would be making a stopover in the Soviet
capital. Asked about this yesterday, he said only that both sides had
<£emed it a good opportunity to continue dialogue.
Gromyko chose to make the meeting a forum for once again attacking
the Star Wars — or Strategic Defense Initiative — proposals for devel
oping space-based defenses againsfoffensive missiles.
In recent weeks, Kremlin officials have mounted a campaign against
the U.S. program, visiting Western capitals and repeatedly denouncing
the Reagan plan in the Soviet media.
U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said last month Washing
ton would welcome West Germany's help in developing the advanced
missile defenses. The West Germans say they have received no concrete
invitation to take part.
