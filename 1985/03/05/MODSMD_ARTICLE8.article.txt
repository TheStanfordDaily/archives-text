# Supreme Court eases Miranda
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — A sharply divided Supreme
Court, clashing over the controversial Miranda
rule, gave police a second chance yesterday to ob
tain confessions that can be used at trial even if a
previous admission was made before a suspect was
notified of his legal rights.
In a 6-3 decision, the court said that a suspect's
subsequent confession, made after a valid warning
of his rights to silence and to legal counsel, was ad
missible so long as the earlier statement was not
coerced by officers.
The decision was marked by an unusually acerbic
exchange between the court majority and dis
senters.
Justice William Brennan, joined by Justice Thur
good Marshall in a 46-page dissent, said the ruling
threatened "disastrous consequences." Brennan
accused the current court of engaging in a "studied
campaign" to undermine rights established when
the court under Chief Justice Earl Warren issued
the Miranda rule 19 years ago.
"Today's decision," he said, "delivers a
potentially crippling blow to Miranda and the abil
ity of the courts to safeguard the rights of persons
accused of crime."
In reply, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the au
thor of the majority opinion, accused Brennan of
taking an "apocalyptic" view of the ruling that "not
only distorts the reasoning and holding of our deci
sion, but, worse, invites trial courts and prosecutors
to do the same."
The now-famous Miranda rule emerged in the

landmark 1966 Supreme Court decision of
Miranda vs. Arizona, in which the justices ruled
that suspects held in police custody must be told
that anything they say can be used against them and
that they have the right to silence and to a lawyer
before officers may question them.
Generally, statements made in the absence of
such warnings cannot be used in court, although the
justices ruled last year that statements elicited from
suspects when "public safety" is at stake may be
admissible even when no Miranda warning is given
first.
In yesterday's case (Oregon vs. Elstad, 83-773),
officers in Polk County, Ore., investigating a
$150,000 burglary in 1981, went to the home of
18-year old Michael James Elstad, who had been
implicated by a witness to the crime. An officer
talked briefly with Elstad about the burglary, and
the youth volunteered he had heard about the
crime. When the officer said he thought Elstad was
involved, Elstad replied, "Yes, I was there."
At the sheriffs office, Elstad was advised of his
rights for the first time and then gave a formal
statement admitting guilt. At the trial for burglary,
the judge excluded Elstad's initial statement —"1
was there" — but admitted into evidence his subse
quent formal confession. He was convicted and
sentenced to five years in prison.
The Oregon Court of Appeals overturned the
conviction, saying the second statement should not
have been admitted either because it was a
"tainted" product of the first.

The Supreme Court, reversing the Oregon court,
said there was no need to bar a second statement,
after a valid warning, so long as there were no
"deliberately coercive or improper tactics" in ob
taining the first statement.
"A subsequent administration of Miranda warn
ings to a suspect who has given a voluntary but un
warned statement ordinarily should suffice to
remove the conditions that precluded admission of
the earlier statement," O'Connor wrote.
The majority reaffirmed that the court would not
condone coercive tactics that undermined a
suspect's desire to remain silent.
Nonetheless, Brennan issued a far-ranging con
demnation of the decision, accusing the court of ig
noring the "realities" of police interrogations and
failing to realize that a first confession obtained
without Miranda warnings could enable authorities
to get subsequent admissions "on a silver platter."
Brennan warned that police now may purposely
withhold a warning until the end of an interroga
tion session, getting a suspect to confess first and
then notifying him of his rights just before he takes
pen in hand to sign an incriminating statement.
In a separate dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens
expressed fear that the decision would breed
"confusion and uncertainty." He added that it
"denigrates the importance" of the Fifth Amend
ment's privilege against self-incrimination — "one
of the core constitutional rights that protects every
American citizen from the kind of tyranny that has
flourished in other societies."
