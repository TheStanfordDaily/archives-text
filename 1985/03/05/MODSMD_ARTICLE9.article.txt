# Officials urge SALT II extension
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” Some Pent
agon officials and military officers are
urging the administration to seek an
extension of some provisions of the
unratified SALT II agreement at the
Geneva arms control talks next week
to provide interim limits on arms until
substantial cuts can be negotiated, ac
cording to informed sources.
Both nuclear superpowers have
pledged not to undercut the 1979
treaty, which is due to expire at the
end of this year, but there have been
charges on both sides that some
provisions of the treaty are being vio
lated.
The United States will have more
to lose than the Soviet Union if the
treaty limits are allowed to expire
with no replacement, these officials
argue. This is because the Soviets are
more ready than the United States for
mass production of many more new
missiles.

An unrestrained and immediate of
fensive arms spurt, moreover, would
diminish the administration's hopes
that deep cuts in offensive weapons
and a meeting of minds on defensive
weapons could emerge from the new
arms negotiations starting next Tues
day.
President Reagan met with the Na
tional Security Council yesterday
morning to review options for the up
coming negotiations. One official said
later that a final presidential decision
on instructions for the delegation is
not expected until Thursday, when
Reagan meets with the U.S.
negotiators.
At the Capitol, Soviet Politburo
member Vladimir Shcherbitsky,
leader of a parliamentary delegation
that arrived here Sunday, told the
House Foreign Affairs Committee
that the Soviet Union hopes the
Geneva talks will make "a major con

tribution" to removing the threat of
nuclear war.
Up to now, U.S. preparations for
the strategic weapons part of the
Geneva negotiations have dealt
primarily with updating the most
recent U.S. proposals for deep reduc
tions before the last round of U.S.-
Soviet talks ended in December
1983.
One Pentagon official said last
week that, given planned new missile
deployments by both sides, "an in
terim framework" for strategic sys
tem limits based on the existing
SALT II limits "would be logical as a
transition from where we've been to
where we are going." But as of yes
terday, sources said, no decision on
this point has been made.
The Soviets are expected to pro
pose extension of the SALT II limits
at Geneva, an informed diplomatic
source said last week. He added that

Soviet negotiators may argue that the
United States should offer to restrain
its space weapons development in
return for Moscow's agreement on
continuing the SALT II limits.
SALT II permits each nation an
overall limit of 2,250 strategic nu
clear missiles or bombers and set a
sublimit of 1,200 on intercontinental
land-based missiles carrying more
than one warhead.
According to U.S. data, the Soviet
Union already exceeds the overall
limits of SALT II because of failure
to make reductions in 1981 as called
for in the treaty. Soviet deployments
of the new single-warhead mobile
SS-25, expected to begin late this year,
will add to the Soviet totals. This
missile is to be followed by the bigger
10-warhead rail-mobile SS-24, the
test phase for which is being com
pleted, with deployment expected to
begin in late 1986.
