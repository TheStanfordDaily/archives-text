Deaver gets discount
WASHINGTON — Michael Deaver, deputy
White House chief of staff, used his diplomatic
passport to purchase a luxury BMW automobile
at a discount while doing advance work on Presi
dent Reagan's trip to Germany recently, but he
violated no government regulations in doing so,
White House officials said yesterday.
As many as eight others in the 35-member
U.S. group, whose job was to plan Reagan's visit
to Europe in May, made similar automobile pur
chases, officials said, describing such transactions
by military officers and persons holding
diplomatic passports as "traditional" and "a
common practice."
Although government regulations prohibit
U.S. officials from receiving gifts from a foreign
government, there is no ban on their accepting
discounts or sales promotion devices from a
private company abroad if that firm has no busi
ness with the State Department, aides said.

Presidential spokesman Larry Speakes, brief
ing reporters on the Deaver case, declined com
ment on whether such a practice appeared to be
proper.
Regan defends tax plan
WASHINGTON — Donald Regan, the White
House chief of staff, doggedly defended his tax
reform proposal, which has been under heavy at
tack by business, charities and other interest
groups since he announced it more than three
months ago.
He said in an interview yesterday that at
meetings with critics of his proposal, he has
demanded that they produce "proof' to support
their contentions that they would be hurt by his
proposal. So far, he said, he has seen no proof.
The Regan proposal, which provides for a 35
percent maximum individual income tax rate,
would mean smaller tax bills for 56 percent of the

nation's individual taxpayers but higher taxes for
American business.
Despite the widespread criticism, Reagan said
he still stands behind all provisions of his pro
posal and expects the administration to soon in
troduce some version of it. He predicted
Congress would pass the tax reform measure this
year.
Market up slightly
Stock prices, which drifted lower during most
of the session yesterday, spurted late in the day,
then fell back.
Trading, although uncertain, was active.
The market's best known indicator, the Dow
Jones average of 30 industrials, managed to
finish with a gain of 2.32 points at 1,291.85.
But losers outpaced gainers 8-to-7 among New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues.
