Dornan, Downey clash
WASHINGTON — A grudge that Rep.
Robert Dornan (R-Calif.) has been harboring for
nearly two years led to the confrontation Monday
between him and Rep. Thomas Downey (D-
N.Y.) on the House floor.
Dornan, a flamboyant conservative who has
battled liberal Downey over defense weapons
systems and arms control issues over the years,
blames Downey for the fact that he lost a key
consulting job with the Arms Control and Dis
armament Agency in 1983.
The confrontation was over a newspaper story
in which Dornan was quoted as calling Downey
"a draft-dodging wimp' 1 who criticized the anti
government Nicaraguan rebels.
According to both sides, Dornan admitted he
had said it and believed it. "1 explained that I'm
sick of you and others coming on the House floor
and attacking these 'freedom fighters' and calling
them thugs," he said.
At that point, Downey said, he started to walk
away, but Dornan grabbed him by the collar. The

California congressman admitted that but said it
was only because he wanted Downey to hear him
out.
Another congressman who witnessed the
dispute, Mike Lowry (D-Wash.) said that Dor
nan "grabbed Tom forcefully by the collar. ... If
Tom had done anything else but walk away, I
don't know what would have happened."
"Downey is someone who's done me a lot of
dirt," Dornan said in an interview yesterday. " He
cost me the job. He fed me to a couple of draft
dodging wimps in the White House, and this was
all they needed to block me."
Dornan was still bitter about statements made
by Downey and another member, Rep. Howard
Wolpe (D-Mich.) that reflected on Dornan's
abilities. Until then, Dornan said, his position as
consultant had been "signed, sealed and
delivered." Added Dornan: "He ruined all that."
Downey discounted the notion that he had any
influence in the Reagan administration.
He dismissed Dornan as "a man who has deep
seated views on issues that don't comport with
reality."
