## Stanford acquires new diagnostic equipment Magnetic resonance imaging offers cross-sectional views of the body 
### PATRICK LIN Editorial staff 
This week Stanford Medical Center
will begin operation of its new mag
netic resonance imaging (MRI)
facility. MRI is a rapidly developing
technology that promises to have a
great impact on medicine in the
future.
The MRI scanner enables
physicians to look inside the human
body by providing highly detailed
cross-sectional images of anatomical
structures. The scans can be taken at
any desired angle, making it possible
to view any slice of the body.
MRI, also known as nuclear mag
netic resonance (NMR) imaging, has
its foundations in experimental work
done by Physics Prof. Felix
Bloch more than three decades ago.
Bloch, along with Edward Purcell of
Harvard, was awarded the Nobel
Prize in 1952 for his pioneering ef
forts.
Nuclear magnetic resonance is a
phenomenon that involves the behav
ior of atomic nuclei in magnetic
fields. An atom's nucleus is a
charged, spinning particle that acts
essentially like a tiny bar magnet
when placed in a magnetic field. The
tiny magnet lines up with the field in a
way similar to a compass needle
lining up with the earth's magnetic
field.
Nuclear magnetic resonance refers
to the absorption of energy by atomic
nuclei in magnetic fields. The nuclei
will absorb energy, or "resonate,"
when electromagnetic radiation of a
particular frequency is applied to the
nuclei.
This characteristic frequency,
known as the Larmor frequency,

depends on the kind of atom in the
field and the strength of the field.
Larmor frequencies fall into the
radio-wave band of electromagnetic
radiation and thus are harmless to
living cells.
When the nucleus of an atom
aborbs energy from a radio
frequency pulse, the tiny magnet as
sociated with the nucleus becomes
tipped away from the direction of the
magnetic field. Once the pulse is
stopped, a process known as
"relaxation" occurs. The magnet
starts spinning like a top and slowly
regains its alignment with the mag
netic field. As the magnet spins, it re
emits radio waves. These waves are
picked up and monitored by an an
tenna.
The time the magnet takes to
become re-aligned with the magnetic
field is known as the "relaxation
time." This can be measured by the
decay of the radio waves emitted
during relaxation.
In MRI, images are produced on
the basis of relaxation times of hydro
gen atoms. Relaxation times vary in
different parts of the body because
the magnetic field varies in different
regions of the body. The molecules in
a particular region will create local
perturbations in the magnetic field in
that region.
The perturbations in the magnetic
field are reflected in the relaxation
times of hydrogen nuclei. MRI
images therefore distinguish different
tissues by the characteristic relaxation
times of hydrogen nuclei in each
tissue.
Hydrogen atoms are used to
generate MRI scans because they are
the most abundant atoms in the body.

Seventy-five percent of the human
body, in fact, consists of water.
However, it is theoretically possible
to produce images based on other
atoms, and this is currently being
researched.
In order to produce an image with
MRI, relaxation times must be deter
mined simultaneously for a large
number of points in the body. The
process by which this is done is
therefore highly complex.
In a typical MRI scanner, the body
is placed inside a very strong magnet,
and a radio-frequency pulse is ap
plied to the body. As relaxation takes
place, a receiver coil, records a com
plex radio wave which represents the
sum total of all of the relaxation
events taking place in the body. The
problem is to use this complex radio
wave to ascertain the relaxation times
of each point in the body.
Two basic techniques are used to
make it possible to determine relaxa
tion times. One is the use of gradients
in the magnetic field — that is, the
use of non-uniform fields. This pro
vides a means to excite nuclei in just
one slice of the body at a time.
The other technique is fourier anal
ysis. This is a powerful mathematical
tool that enables one to analyze a
complex wave form by breaking it
into basic waves of different frequen
cies. This can be imagined as fitting
the curves of different known graphs
on to a complex wave function,
reconstructing it as a composite.
By using a combination of mag
netic field gradients and fourier anal
ysis, it is possible to determine relaxa
tion times for each point in the body.
Once relaxation times are known,
cross-sectional images for any slice of

the body can be reconstructed with
the aid of a computer.
The old term for MRI — nuclear
magnetic resonance imaging — was
somewhat misleading because people
tended to associate it with nuclear ra
diation. MRI does not involve harm
ful radiation.
In fact, one of the biggest advan
tages of MRI is safety.
According to Dieter Enzmann,
director of the MRI Center at Stan
ford, "to date, there is no evidence to

show that high magnetic fields are
harmful."
In contrast to MRI, computed
tomography (CT) scanning must use
X-rays to produce cross-sectional
images. X-rays are a form of ionizing
radiation and can cause chromosomal
damage.
In addition to not using harmful ra
diation, MRI is distinguished by
being a non-invasive procedure. Be
cause of this, Enzmann foresees that
MRI will replace a number of diag

nostic procedures.
"For example, it might replace a
segment of myelography (lumbar
punctures of the spine) and some an
giographs," said Enzmann. Not only
are these procedures uncomfortable
for the patient, but they are also
somewhat risky, Enzmann explained.

with any known health hazards, the

that are useful in diagnosing medical disorders.
