## The 						Stanford Daily New deal for co-ops 
### 
"We hope to resolve it before next spring's
Draw," said Rodger Whitney, director of the
Housing Center, last October.
Resolve: "To solve (a problem)," according to
the 1979 edition of Webster's New World Dic
tionary.
But the University has yet to solve the problem
of co-ops not filling in the Draw. In fact, when
Norm Robinson, the associate dean of Student
Affairs for Residential Education, decided last
week to put Terra and Synergy on a sort of Draw
probation, he created new problems.
Robinson's proposal, unveiled last week at a
Terra House meeting, allows Terra and Synergy
to remain co-ops unless more than 10 percent of
their assignable undergraduate spaces remain un
filled at the end of round two of this year's Draw.
As things now stand, if Terra fails to fill ade
quately, it will become a self-operated house, and
if Synergy fails to fill, it will become a University
operated house, according to Robinson.
The problem with this "solution" is that it
resolves nothing:
• Students are left to gamble on drawing into the
type of housing they desire, as they ask: "Should
I, trying to get into a self-op, put Terra on my
Draw card and hope it doesn't fill?" Or, "Should
I, trying to get into a co-op, put Terra on my card
and hope it does fill?"
• The future status of Terra and Synergy is uncer

tain, both for next year and in the longer term.
Synergy could be either a co-op or a University
operated house next year — two drastically dif
ferent things. And beyond next year, things are
even more gray. If Terra, for example, manages
to fill this year, it's future is still uncertain.
"We're just looking at it a year at a time," Robin
son said yesterday.
• Res Ed will still not know "whether we have
too many co-ops for student demand," a question
Director of the Row Diana Conklin has said any
solution would have to address.
The real solution is a three-year probation for
both houses.
Should either Terra or Synergy not fill in any of
the upcoming three Draws, Res Ed should leave
them as co-ops the following year, but convert
them into either self-ops or University-operated
houses the year after that.
Students would then know precisely what type
of house they would be living in when they put
Synergy or Terra on their Draw cards. In addi
tion, the futures of Terra and Synergy would be
well-defined: They fill three consecutive years or
lose their status as co-ops. And Res Ed would
have a long-term opportunity to gauge the desire
of students to live in co-ops. Even if the affected
co-ops fill only by making special recruiting ef
forts like this year's "outreach" program, such
special efforts will become beneficial permanent
programs after three years.
