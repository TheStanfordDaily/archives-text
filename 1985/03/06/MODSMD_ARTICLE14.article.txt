Chrysler Chairman Lee lacocca may have won
himself the title role in the remake of "Sybil"
with his schizophrenic performance on the pages
of The New York Times over the weekend.
On Saturday, a grim looking mug shot of
lacocca appeared on the front page of The Times
along with a statement decrying President
Reagan's decision not to ask Japanese auto
makers for further restraints on the number of
cars they sell in America.
lacocca called it "a sad day for America,"and
spokesmen for the United Auto Workers and
Ford Motor Co. agreed. They all said that the
president's decision would cost American jobs
and hurt the auto industry.
But the next day, a full-page Times ad thank
ing America for making 1984 Chrysler's best
year ever appeared above lacocca's signature.
The ad also promised that Chrysler would be
making better, more efficient cars to "beat the
Japanese at their own game."
However, lacocca and his cohorts in Detroit
have, until Friday, been playing by their rules and
not Japan's. Since 1981, the U.S. government
had "asked" the Japanese to restrict their sales in
this country. The restrictions were designed to
protect the American auto industry, which was
teetering at the time.

While the restrictions preserved the industry
and saved jobs, they also cost American consu
mers billions of dollars by artificially driving up
the cost of Japanese cars.-Some experts also
argue that Japan has responded in kind with
protectionist measures in areas such as
agriculture and electronics. As a result, the U.S.-
Japan trade deficit grew to $37 billion dollars last
year.
In the meantime, it seems that the industry has,
at the very least, steadied itself. The big three
auto makers (Chrysler, General Motors and
Ford) reported record profits of approximately
$10 billion for 1984. The industry is now in its
most competitive position ever.
Reagan's decision justly recognized this factor
and, as one Japanese spokesman put it, put a
"moral imperative" on the Japanese to recipro
cate. Reagan probably also recognized that the
Japanese will not bludgeon the American auto
industry to death. Above all else, Japanese in
dustrialists are pragmatic businessmen who
realize that if they try to take over the American
market, they will only trigger more protectionist
action by the U.S. government.
The American auto industry should realize
when it makes record-breaking profits one day, it
cannot play the role of a fledgling industry the
next.
