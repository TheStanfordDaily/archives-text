# Put the senate on the ballot
## 
### 
The recent rash of resignations by senators has finally
focused campus attention on the ASSU Senate. Students
are starting to ask some important questions, such as
"What's driving senators to resignation?"; "Why are
senators so frustrated?"; "What does the senate really do,
anyway?"; and, occasionally, "senate? What senate?"
These are questions that aren't often asked. Very few
students outside the senate have any idea what senators
are supposed to be doing, or whether or not they're even
doing it (whatever "it" is).
What word comes to mind when you think of the ASSU
Senate? If your response is anything like most students',
you think of a word like "bureaucratic," "ineffective,"
"waste," or, worse, "Nothing. I've never heard of the sen
ate."
(Once in a while someone might respond compas-'
sionately, "They try." But when you ask the person what
the senate's trying to do, even he doesn't seem to know.)
It's obvious that a severe image problem plagues the
senate; it's getting worse, not better. And senate officials
really don't seem to care. It's as though yearly student dis
satisfaction and multiple resignations are expected. The
senate seems to perceive student cynicism and hostility
and senator frustration as unavoidable and therefore ig
norable.
But students don't scoff at the senate solely for the fun
of it. Nor are senators' resignations groundless, whimsical
or "to be expected." Although the senate might not like
to believe it, these attitudes and actions are mainly a result
of the senate itself, and not of a minority of uncommitted
or cynical individuals.
Stanford students are sending unmistakable signals ex
pressing extreme dissatisfaction.
Something is seriously wrong when my roommate. Jay
Alter, who resigned last week, says: "Jason, I'd rather do
nothing at all than be a senator. The legislating for the
purpose of legislating that goes on in the senate is worse
than doing nothing at all. It diverts creative energies into a
bureaucratic black hole. Frankly, I'd rather do my laundry
or dig a ditch than attend another senate or committee
meeting."
I hardly need to point out the sweepingly condemning
nature of these words. And these feelings are not unique
to Jay Alter. Senator Derek Passarelli resigned, too,
saying he doesn't "believe the senate does anything use
ful."
It's especially unsettling that the senate chair, when
asked by a Daily reporter to outline this year's concrete
accomplishments, can point to so few achievements: sel
ling stamps for a few hours one day (some solution to our
lousy post office service), extending hours for a shuttle
bus service and making check cashing easier in the
bookstore.
These "accomplishments" don't seem too major when
you consider the gargantuan paper-pushing bureaucracy it
took to achieve them. A committee of five concerned stu
dents meeting once a month could perform the same func
tion.
So what does the senate do with its time? I asked Jay
this question a couple of days ago:
"It spends most of its time making up rules for regulat
ing its own internal operation. They pass amendments,
bylaws, rules and so on. A letter to The Daily a while ago

suggested that we make the senate a class and call it
'Beginning Bureaucrats 101." That wouldn't be far from
the truth."
When students vote for senate officials, most think they
ought to be electing representatives. But in reality, they
aren't. This is one of the senate's fundamental problems.
Once senators are elected, most act as individuals.
After their one week of campaigning in the spring, they
are sucked into the senate bureaucracy and their voters
never hear from them again. Why not? There are really no
defined groups of constituents who can hold individual
senators accountable for their actions. Nor is there an ef-

fective means through which senators and their
"constituents" (i.e., all members of the student body) can
communicate.
At present senators are assigned a "district" to visit
every couple of weeks to gather student input and report
to students. But it is too seldom that a rapport is estab
lished or that a constructive relationship develops. I'm not
sure this kind of relationship has ever developed.
Most senators don't show up for these meetings. If you
are like me, you probably didn't even know that a senator
is supposed to be representing you.
But even if a senator communicates with other students,
an almost unbreachable bureaucratic information gap
prevents him or her from doing so. To a student outside
the senate, a report that begins like the following one
doesn't mean much: "Tonight we voted for bylaw 238D
-4 which would make this section of the constitu
tion. . .
It's time senators sat down (maybe they ought to stand
up to do this â€” it could be that they sit down too much)
and define their goals and make a list of purposes. And
then follow them.
If the senate has such a list, I certainly don't know about
it. Nor do other students I've spoken with. (Not even
senators seem to know of such a list's existence: One told
me, "Maybe it's somewhere in the constitution.")
If the senate were to define its goals and objectives, it
might have a hard time finding an excuse for its existence.
So might the students. We don't need an organization that
exists to push paper. And we don't need senators who
aren't representatives.
We need an organization that is truly participatory and
responsive, and one that renders representatives ac
countable for their activity or lack of it. The current sys
tem of Stanford student government fails on both counts.
I challenge the senate to place itself on the spring ballot.
I he vote dissolving the senate would go down in history as
the New Beginning of Stanford student government.
