An effective ASSU
Successful policy has been formed
only when commitment and power
have been brought into balance.
- Walter Lippmann
Student government at Stanford
has seen brighter days. As we sit
back and watch the leadership of the
ASSU unravel, it's difficult not to
become disillusioned and disap
pointed with our student leaders. We
have now reached a new level of
discontent. Recent appellations for
our legislative and executive bodies
have included "jerk-offs," "political
egomaniacs," "beginning
bureaucrats" and "self-serving
politicos." While I'm all for a little
constructive criticism, 1 feel the
recent barrage of anti-ASSU rhetoric
to be slightly misdirected and un
productive.
The ASSU Senate has great po
tential for acting on and solving
student problems. All it takes, as
Lippmann has said, is a balance of
power and commitment. The biggest
problem with this year's senate is the
lack of commitment exhibited by a
significant number of its members.
It's now fashionable to resign from
the ASSU Senate. Again today I
picked up a Daily and found the
smiling face of yet another senator
who had chosen to join the elite class
of "senate quitters." What's amazing
to me is that the student body
condones — and even applauds —
such actions. In last spring's cam-

paign, candidates for this year's
senate promised to represent our
interests and to work for the better
ment of the Stanford community. I,
like many students, wasn't expecting
dramatic improvements from the
senate. I, again, like many students,
only expected a commitment to work
from those elected.
Less than a year later, we hear
senators claiming that the senate
doesn't represent minority groups
very effectively, that it doesn't do
anything useful and that its potential
is inhibited by massive bureaucracy.
Well, if all these claims are true, then
surely those senators committed to
working for the betterment of Stan
ford have more than enough work to
keep themselves busy.
The three senators who resigned
for non-academic reasons have
adopted a new method in solving the
problems they cite. It entails quitting
halfway through the job and aban
doning one's responsibilities. Much
as I hate to quote Hubert
Humphrey, he does provide some
wisdom in this area: "Some people
look upon any setback as the end.
They're always looking for the
benediction rather than the invoca
tion. But you can't quit. That isn't
the way our country was built."
As I've indicated, and contrary to
popular belief, much good can be
accomplished by an individual within
the ASSU Senate. It is not
impossible to attend dorm meetings
and hear student concerns. It is not

impossible to meet with University
officials and propose policy changes.
It is not impossible to sit down with a
student organization and rationally
develop a budget, and it is not
impossible to work around — or
even reduce — bureaucracy.
The ASSU Senate, by definition,
has the power to work for the better
ment of the Stanford community.
And when its power is balanced with
the commitment of its members, the
senate can function effectively for
the betterment of us all.

More concerts
In a recent article, "Promoter says
student group blocks concerts" (The
Daily, Feb. 28), the Concert Net
work and Bill Graham made a num
ber of misleading statements. We
have been in constant contact with
Bill Graham regarding the no
tion of concerts at Stanford, includ
ing the Grateful Dead. It is our goal
to bring entertainment that the stu
dents and the rest of the Stanford
community want to see.
We are constrained, however, by
the fact that we are a University
student group and, therefore, must
consider the implications of our
actions within this context. We have
been working for more than a year
and a half to bring contemporary

entertainment back to Stanford.
During this time, it has taken a lot of
effort to develop a system that will
satisfy both students and University
administrators.
In deciding to present a particular
show, we have to look at both the
costs and benefits. Sometimes a
promoter can lose money on a show
even if it sells out. For instance,
grounds damage, arrests and insur
ance costs all must be accounted for.
In addition, one wants to make sure
that the city of Palo Alto and various
University personnel are happy with
the handling of the show, such that
the future of concerts at Stanford is
not jeopardized.
In the article, it was mentioned
that there is a perception that the
Grateful Dead attracts the "wrong
element." I would like to state that
the Concert Network does not con
cur with that perception. But there
are people who saw the results of the
last Dead concert, and need as
surances that similar activity will not
happen again.
We plan to have six concerts at
Frost Amphitheatre before Sept. 1.
Whether or not the Grateful Dead is
one of those shows will depend on
the economic feasibility and how
well we can prepare the University
for such an event. We are currently
talking with Bill Graham and other
promoters to fill our available dates.
