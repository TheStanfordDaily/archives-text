# Senate abolishes GPB
## Kennedy tells senate he won't block Grateful Dead 
### JOYA WESLEY Staff writer 
The ASSU Senate abolished the Guest Professorship
Bureau (GPB) and voted to place a bill on the spring bal
lot that could eliminate special fee refunds at last night's
final meeting of the quarter in the Law School.
The senate also approved two resolutions addressed to
the Board of Trustees regarding divestment from corpora
tions operating in South Africa and a resolution to recom
mend that the Student Conduct Legislative Council
(SCLC) adopt a policy of due process in its dealings with
charges against student organizations.
In other business, five constitutional amendments were
placed on the spring ballot, and University President
Donald Kennedy, addressing the senate's questions on a
variety of issues, said he wouldn't oppose efforts to bring
the Grateful Dead back to Stanford.
"I am certainly not 'anti-Dead,' " said Kennedy. Rep
resentatives of the Concert Network have said that a
Grateful Dead concert will not occur on campus this
spring, partly because it would hinder the network's at
tempts to build credibility with the University.
But Bay Area concert promoter Bill Graham has said
he can guarantee that the band will play at Frost Amphit
heatre if he has the cooperation of the Concert Network
and the University.
In other matters, Kennedy stated that, despite tuition
increases and proposed cuts in federal financial aid, the
University will still cover all demonstrated financial need
for students.
The abolition of the GPB, effective Aug. 31, was
prompted by that group's failure to be consistently effec
tive, according to the bill's author, Graduate Senator
James McGrath. The GPB's remaining funds from this
school year will be transferred to a special buffer fund that
will reduce the "non-refundable surcharge collected by
the special fee system for 1985-86," according to the bill.
Senator Mark Soble's bill to eliminate all cash refunds

of fee assessments was approved for placement on the bal
lot by a narrow margin, requiring the positive vote of Sen
ate Chair Eric Berg. The bill required the assent of two
thirds of the senate's 21 voting members, so although it
was supported 13-2-2, it still needed Berg's vote to pass
and get onto the general election ballot.
In addition, the senate approved two resolutions on
divestment authored by Graduate Senator Mark Landes
mann following positive comments on them by Kennedy.
The first of these resolutions requests that the Board of
Trustees clarify its conditional divestiture of Mortorola
Corp., asking how the Board of Trustees will monitor the
company's sales practices, given that "Motorola . . .
refuses to disclose information regarding its sales practices
to South African police and military."
The second resolution urges the board to "adopt
criteria which define unacceptable corporate behavior as
grounds for divestiture." The bill based its call to the trus
tees upon the results of last quarter's ASSU referendum
in which "83 percent of students voting urged that Stan
ford University adopt explicit criteria for selective
divestiture from certain companies operating in South
Africa."
Senators Jeff Soukup and B.G. Porter said they pre
sented the bill on due process in response to the punish
ment of several student organizations, including fraterni
ties, before establishing guilt.
The five constitutional amendments dealt with the pro
cedure for placing issues on the ballot and for calling spe
cial elections. The controversial portions of the amend
ments, which would have raised the number of student
signatures required for certain actions, were removed.
Senators expressed concern that requiring more
signatures would take power out of the hands of students,
and in their final form the amendments do not make it any
harder for students to place issues on the election ballot.
The amendments, which will require final approval by stu
dents, do make it more difficult to call special elections.
