# Stanford police chief: maintaining law and order
## 
### NINA EBERT 
For at least a month, people who
run the Campus Drive loop have seen
it every time they round the corner by
the driving range. Maybe even some
bored motorists trapped by the
stoplight noticed it.
But whether or not they saw it, not
one of them reported the smashed
sign lying on the shoulder, pointing
toward campus.
If it were something they owned,
they certainly would have made sure
the police knew about its demolition.
It belongs to the University, however,
and the Board of Trustees can't
report every bit of damaged property
in the same way private citizens do.
The Stanford deputized peace offi
cers and community-service officers
often have nobody but themselves to
watch over the campus.
This is just one reason the Stanford
Police Department, charged with
providing law enforcement for the
University, has a unique job working
on an independently owned campus.
As police chief and director of public
safety, Marvin Herrington also has a
job that differs from most police
chiefs' because of its university con
text.
Herrington has been working with
universities since he came to Califor
nia in 1961. He rose to the position of
police chief at UC-Davis while he was
working on a business degree at
Sacramento State College.
Before that, Herrington had
worked as a police officer in Detroit
until he decided that Detroit was be
coming too dangerous and that he
really had no future there. He says he
packed up his wife and three young
daughters and left for California with

no plan in mind other than getting a
better education in hopes of going
into business.
Fed up with big cities, he moved to
Sacramento, where he could get a job
with the UC-Davis police department
and go to school at the same time.
UC-Davis has one of the few police
departments without a residency re
quirement for new officers. He spent
five years getting an undergraduate
degree; he had to support his family
at the same time. By the time he
finished he decided to stay in law en
forcement.
After a year with Northwestern
University and a year with California
State Colleges, Herrington came to
Stanford. Used to the '60s student
wildness by then, he calls the Stan
ford of 1971 a "war zone."
He recalls that there was a major
demonstration almost every day,
sometimes involving thousands of
people, and almost every night
demonstrators would "play the game
of 'let's break out what windows are
left.' " That year, he says, two or
three cars were lost to bombs, and
several buildings were burned, in
cluding Encina Hall.
Herrington most vividly remem
bers being barricaded inside the
Career Planning and Placement Cen
ter with people outside throwing
things and piling things against the
door. He says,"I began to worry, 'If
they're going to set fire to this place,
how are we going to get out?' "
Herrington's first task at that time
was to institute a police department,
defying predictions of its impos
sibility. "One of the funny things
about it is that when we initially set it
up, a lot of the people that I know in

the field said, 'It won't work, it can't
work.' "
Herrington's difficulty in organiz
ing a police force on an indepen
dently owned campus was that he has
to answer to three different people.
He has to deal with the Santa Clara
County Sheriff on legal matters, the
University president on policy mat
ters, and the vice president of busi
ness and finance on business matters.
He says he does this by keeping the
three entities separate from one an
other.
On the law enforcement side, his
deputized peace officers cruise
campus in patrol cars and on
motorbikes, exercising the same au
thority as police officers on the
outside. Herrington says the kind of

crime they see most is property
related, but they respond to every
kind of case, up through homicide, as
a city department would.
He says, "As a peace officer I have
kind of an arm's length relationship
with the University. If a crime is com
mitted ... if we have the evidence, if
we have the individual, we arrest him
— bang. That's all there is to it."
He sounds like "Hill Street Blues"
Chief Frank Furillo when he talks
about being tough with law enforce
ment. "Our goal is — and it may be a
partially selfish one — that we don't
want the crimes to happen to begin
with."
In some ways, the university con
text makes his job as a law enforcer
easier. "If one of our investigations

has a technical question, I've got the
best resources in the world within
walking distance of my office," he
notes.
Herrington says that the Home
stead High School hacker incident, for
example, "is one of those cases where
you have to rely on the technical ex
perts to even tell you a crime has
been committed."
The collective living siluation at the
University also makes law enforce
ment easier because of the high level
of communication between commu
nity members. He says that if any
crime is committed, the community is
almost immediately alerted by word
of mouth.
He says that because of this, he
sees statistics on rapes, for example,
that show that "any of the surround
ing communities has a rate at least 10
times higher than at Stanford." Her
rington says that communication
helps because, "If you get to the point
where you are on the defensive, that
will do a lot more than anything that I
could do."
In addition to the other dimensions
the university context lends to law en
forcement, it also gives Herrington
more responsibilities on policy and
business matters. One way he has
dealt with this is with his community
service officers (CSOs). To handle all
the special University security jobs
and traffic control, Herrington has a
whole group of CSOs.
CSO Ricco Alcantar says that often
his job is made light of, even by other
officers, but that his job is vital to the
University because nobody else pro
vides this everyday security-guard
service.

Campus events don't just happen
without police department planning,
either. Herringtoh's jurisdiction over
the University includes coordinating
campus events. He notes that a
nationwide crime rate decrease has
not made his job any less busy.
Looking at some of his recent respon
sibilities, it's easy to see why — the
Queen of England visited and Stanford
hosted some of the Olympic Games
and the Super Bowl, to name just a
few events.
Other special duties the Stanford
police handle are worked out between
University administrators and Her
rington as well. He leans forward in
his chair, explaining the process of
designing a program like a more ex
tensive campus patrol, as if it were
the same as planning a project for a
multinational corporation. He incor
porates his interest in business into
his organization of the department.
When a service is needed, he looks
at the minimal amount of resources
required to accomplish it and then
returns with his plans along with sug
gestions of what else can be done.
"It's like any other business or de
partment in the University in that I
have personnel problems, 1 have
planning problems, I have budget
problems. You can go right down the
list of how you run any enterprise and
it's the same with running a police de
partment," Herrington says.
The Stanford Police Department is
highly interactive with the community
by design. The unusual circumstances
demand it, but Herrington's own out
look on the role of his department
also demands it. He says the depart
ment must contribute to the educa
tional institution of which it is a part.

If it were something they owned,
they certainly would have made sure
the police knew about its demolition.
It belongs to the University, however,
and the Board of Trustees can't
report every bit of damaged property
in the same way private citizens do.
The Stanford deputized peace offi
cers and community-service officers
often have nobody but themselves to
watch over the campus.
This is just one reason the Stanford
Police Department, charged with
providing law enforcement for the
University, has a unique job working
on an independently owned campus.
As police chief and director of public
safety, Marvin Herrington also has a
job that differs from most police
chiefs' because of its university con
text.
Herrington has been working with
universities since he came to Califor
nia in 1961. He rose to the position of
police chief at UC-Davis while he was
working on a business degree at
Sacramento State College.
Before that, Herrington had
worked as a police officer in Detroit
until he decided that Detroit was be
coming too dangerous and that he
really had no future there. He says he
packed up his wife and three young
daughters and left for California with

no plan in mind other than getting a
better education in hopes of going
into business.
Fed up with big cities, he moved to
Sacramento, where he could get a job
with the UC-Davis police department
and go to school at the same time.
UC-Davis has one of the few police
departments without a residency re
quirement for new officers. He spent
five years getting an undergraduate
degree; he had to support his family
at the same time. By the time he
finished he decided to stay in law en
forcement.
After a year with Northwestern
University and a year with California
State Colleges, Herrington came to
Stanford. Used to the '60s student
wildness by then, he calls the Stan
ford of 1971 a "war zone."
He recalls that there was a major
demonstration almost every day,
sometimes involving thousands of
people, and almost every night
demonstrators would "play the game
of 'let's break out what windows are
left.' " That year, he says, two or
three cars were lost to bombs, and
several buildings were burned, in
cluding Encina Hall.
Herrington most vividly remem
bers being barricaded inside the
Career Planning and Placement Cen
ter with people outside throwing
things and piling things against the
door. He says,"I began to worry, 'If
they're going to set fire to this place,
how are we going to get out?' "
Herrington's first task at that time
was to institute a police department,
defying predictions of its impos
sibility. "One of the funny things
about it is that when we initially set it
up, a lot of the people that I know in

the field said, 'It won't work, it can't
work.' "
Herrington's difficulty in organiz
ing a police force on an indepen
dently owned campus was that he has
to answer to three different people.
He has to deal with the Santa Clara
County Sheriff on legal matters, the
University president on policy mat
ters, and the vice president of busi
ness and finance on business matters.
He says he does this by keeping the
three entities separate from one an
other.
On the law enforcement side, his
deputized peace officers cruise
campus in patrol cars and on
motorbikes, exercising the same au
thority as police officers on the
outside. Herrington says the kind of

crime they see most is property
related, but they respond to every
kind of case, up through homicide, as
a city department would.
He says, "As a peace officer I have
kind of an arm's length relationship
with the University. If a crime is com
mitted ... if we have the evidence, if
we have the individual, we arrest him
— bang. That's all there is to it."
He sounds like "Hill Street Blues"
Chief Frank Furillo when he talks
about being tough with law enforce
ment. "Our goal is — and it may be a
partially selfish one — that we don't
want the crimes to happen to begin
with."
In some ways, the university con
text makes his job as a law enforcer
easier. "If one of our investigations

has a technical question, I've got the
best resources in the world within
walking distance of my office," he
notes.
Herrington says that the Home
stead High School hacker incident, for
example, "is one of those cases where
you have to rely on the technical ex
perts to even tell you a crime has
been committed."
The collective living siluation at the
University also makes law enforce
ment easier because of the high level
of communication between commu
nity members. He says that if any
crime is committed, the community is
almost immediately alerted by word
of mouth.
He says that because of this, he
sees statistics on rapes, for example,
that show that "any of the surround
ing communities has a rate at least 10
times higher than at Stanford." Her
rington says that communication
helps because, "If you get to the point
where you are on the defensive, that
will do a lot more than anything that I
could do."
In addition to the other dimensions
the university context lends to law en
forcement, it also gives Herrington
more responsibilities on policy and
business matters. One way he has
dealt with this is with his community
service officers (CSOs). To handle all
the special University security jobs
and traffic control, Herrington has a
whole group of CSOs.
CSO Ricco Alcantar says that often
his job is made light of, even by other
officers, but that his job is vital to the
University because nobody else pro
vides this everyday security-guard
service.

Campus events don't just happen
without police department planning,
either. Herringtoh's jurisdiction over
the University includes coordinating
campus events. He notes that a
nationwide crime rate decrease has
not made his job any less busy.
Looking at some of his recent respon
sibilities, it's easy to see why — the
Queen of England visited and Stanford
hosted some of the Olympic Games
and the Super Bowl, to name just a
few events.
Other special duties the Stanford
police handle are worked out between
University administrators and Her
rington as well. He leans forward in
his chair, explaining the process of
designing a program like a more ex
tensive campus patrol, as if it were
the same as planning a project for a
multinational corporation. He incor
porates his interest in business into
his organization of the department.
When a service is needed, he looks
at the minimal amount of resources
required to accomplish it and then
returns with his plans along with sug
gestions of what else can be done.
"It's like any other business or de
partment in the University in that I
have personnel problems, 1 have
planning problems, I have budget
problems. You can go right down the
list of how you run any enterprise and
it's the same with running a police de
partment," Herrington says.
The Stanford Police Department is
highly interactive with the community
by design. The unusual circumstances
demand it, but Herrington's own out
look on the role of his department
also demands it. He says the depart
ment must contribute to the educa
tional institution of which it is a part.

A campus police department must contribute to the educational institu
tion of which it is a part, says Stanford Police Chief Marvin Her
rington.
For at least a month, people who
run the Campus Drive loop have seen
it every time they round the corner by
the driving range. Maybe even some
bored motorists trapped by the
stoplight noticed it.
But whether or not they saw it, not
one of them reported the smashed
sign lying on the shoulder, pointing
toward campus.
If it were something they owned,
they certainly would have made sure
the police knew about its demolition.
