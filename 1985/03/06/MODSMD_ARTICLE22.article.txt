## Confident spikers greet No. 1 Waves 
### ROB GRAHAM Staff sportswriter 
Everything points toward an upset this
evening, when the Stanford men's volleyball
team plays Pepperdine, the country's No. 1
team, in a league contest that begins at 7:30 in
Maples Pavilion.
The Cardinal men are on a roll — they are
riding a six-game winning streak — and Pep
perdine is coming off a loss to UCLA this
weekend. It seems that an upset is in the
cards. All the same, don't look for the Waves,
ranked No. 1 since the preseason, to fold.
"Champions, and I'm not saying I'm a
champion, don't like to lose," Pepperdine
Coach Marv Dunphy said. "The bottom line is
that I hate to lose. But you can never look
back because that's history."

On the contrary, Stanford's recent volley
ball history has definitely been worth looking
back on. The Volleyball News' panel of
coaches took a look at the Cardinal's 18-4
overall mark and 6-3 league mark and moved
Stanford up a notch from No. 6 to No. 5 in its
most recent poll.
The Cardinal, already assured of a winning
season, also appears to have solidified its hold
on fourth place in the California Intercol
legiate Volleyball Association. Because the
top five teams in the CIV A are awarded post
season playoff bids, Stanford is in good shape.
"If we don't falter and if we continue to
beat the teams we should beat, we should be
in," Cardinal Co-coach Don Shaw said.
Having passed these milestones — the men
had never before posted a winning record and

have never played in the post-season — Card
inal players have reason to strut. "They
(Pepperdine) will be a little surprised by us,"
team captain Craig Lauchner said. "We could
very well pull something off."
Pepperdine knows of the recent improve
ments in Stanford volleyball, however. "They
have a quality program. In vears past that
wasn't always the case, but they're building a
good club," Dunphy said. "They have great
athletes and it's only a matter of time before
they gel."
Tonight's match would be an ideal time for
the Cardinal to gel. Playing a national power
could very well tell Co-coaches Shaw and
Fred Sturm just what kind of team they have.
Despite Pepperdine's disappointing setback
at the hands of UCLA this weekend in the
finals of the non-league Collegiate Classic at
Pauley Pavilion, the squad certainly qualifies r
as a national power.
The Waves are comfortably in first place in
the CIVA with an unblemished 7-0 record
and they enter Maples sporting a 10-2 overall
mark. Only the recent four-set loss to UCLA
and a defeat in early January at Manitoba mar
Pepperdine's season.
Shaw is glad that UCLA demonstrated the
Waves are beatable. "It shows me they're not
totally invincible like everyone was saying,"
Shaw said.
The Cardinal coaching staff and the players
know, however, that the Waves are not
finished. "They're definitely the team to
beat," Lauchner said. Shaw agreed: "We'll
have to be at the top of our game if we are to
beat them."
"They run a very fast offense," Lauchner
said, "and that makes them tough to block. It
will be a side-out game all the way."
"They don't run a really complicated of
fense," Shaw said. "They just execute really
well. In that way, they're kind of like us. It
will be interesting to see if we can out-execute
them."
The teams split two contests last year. The
Waves took Stanford in three sets in Malibu
before the Cardinal rebounded for a gutty
five-set victory here.
"All volleyball teams, ourselves included,
keep adding new things as they progress. By
the end of the year, they're a new team, and
that makes it difficult to prepare," Shaw said.
While both Stanford and Pepperdine may
run similarly methodical and well-executing
offenses, Dunphy is able to fill his lineup card
with thoroughbreds. The Cardinal can claim
only one player with national acclaim, All-
American Jon Root.
In contrast, the Waves boast four nationally
recognized athletes. Seniors Robert McNutt
and Mike Fitzgerald, sophomore Troy Tanner
and junior Mark Arnold have all received in
dividual honors.
