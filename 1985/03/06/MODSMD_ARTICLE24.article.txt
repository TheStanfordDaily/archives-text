# 7-0 lax team aims for title
## 
### PETER HAVEN Staff sportswriter 
When you are undefeated in league play
and have already clinched a division title, it's
time to start thinking of a championship
season. And that is exactly what members of
the Stanford men's lacrosse team are doing
right now.
After this weekend's road triumphs over
UC-Santa Barbara and Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo, the Cardinal, now 7-0, stands atop
the Northern Conference of the Western Col
legiate Lacrosse League, and there is a lot of
talk on the team of an undefeated season and
a league championship.
"I think that since I've been here, this is the
best Stanford team I've ever seen," said John
Cox, a third-year player. "We're solid, deep
and good at all the positions."
Talk is cheap, but Stanford's performance
this year has been anything but cheap. After
soundly beating some lesser opponents early
on, the Cardinal looked to this weekend's
road trip as the true test of its ability.
UCSB, league champions for the last two
years, had knocked off Stanford in the North
ern Conference championship game a year
ago, and Cal Poly was considered one of the
better teams in the conference.
Stanford squeaked by UCSB, 9-7, and beat
Cal Poly by a sound 9-3 margin.
So why isn't everybody cheering? Where
are the banner headlines and the screaming
fans?
For club sport teams, those things are hard

to come by. Nevertheless, the Stanford
lacrosse program has come a long way, and its
future looks even brighter.
If you want to talk about Stanford lacrosse
history — and there is, indeed, a history to
talk about — the man to see is Sam Sadtler.
Sadtler, 48, grew up in Baltimore,
Md., a hotbed for lacrosse. He has been
a "lax" fan ever since he picked up a stick 40
years ago.
After a four-year career at Maryland,
Sadtler eventually moved to the West Coast,
where he played for the Los Angeles Lacrosse
Club and then for the Palo Alto Lacrosse
Club. His connection with the Palo Alto club
team eventually led him to Stanford.
"At the end of the 1973 season, I got asked
by a couple of kids on the team to help out,"
Sadtler said. "It was after a Cal-Stanford
game and there had been a lot of pot-smoking
on the sidelines. I told them that with a coach
and some leadership the program could really
develop."
Club sports in general, and lacrosse in par
ticular, are not exactly known for their op
pressive team rules. Sadtler, however, laid
down the law early when he took over here.
"I told them no pot and no drugs, but they
could have beer after the game," he said.
Beer drinking has been as much a part of
Stanford lacrosse as the grass on the field. It's
not uncommon to find the players sipping a
brew on the sidelines during a contest.
The Stanford team has been around since
1963, when it was primarily a sport for the

graduate students, Sadtler said. It was not un
til 1974, when Sadtler took over as coach,
that the program really took off.
In 1977, the Cardinal men made it all the
way to the league championship game before
losing. The following year was marked by the
transition from an undergraduate-graduate
program to one composed entirely of under
graduate players.
The 1978 season also marked the very
first California Collegiate Championship, in
which Stanford beat UCSB.
Sadtler gave up coaching in 1981 to
become commissioner of the newly formed
Western Collegiate Lacrosse League, which
started off with only five teams besides Stan
ford. Now the 21-team league spans as far
north as Humboldt State, extends inland to
Brigham Young University and stretches
as far as San Diego State and Arizona
State.
Though the Cardinal has w n the league
crown twice — the last time in 1982 — and
there have been many above-average seasons,
this year's squad appears to outshine the rest.
Jim Bedell, a business school student here,
is the team's current coach. Originally from
Long Island, N.Y., Bedell played lacrosse as
an undergraduate at Princeton.
"We're really playing like a team now,"
Bedell said after Saturday's victory over
UCSB. "We're playing team defense and
team offense. Right now we are a really good

team, and by the end of the season we could
be a really great team."
As a unit, the Stanford team is as diverse as
it is talented.
Cox, who went to Annapolis Senior High in
Maryland, was recruited by such big-time
lacrosse schools as Army, Navy, Virginia,
Princeton and Harvard. He says he never
really regretted his choice of Stanford, though
the program here is definitely more easygoing
than its varsity counterparts in the East.
"I don't think I'd like to see any changes
here. It's kind of nice not to have the sport be
such a big deal. It keeps sports in perspective
and keeps them from dominating your life,"
Cox said.
The common denominator among all Stan
ford lacrosse players is simply good athletic
ability. Bedell said.
"It's a contact sport that requires a lot of
physical ability and the ability to handle the
stick. It takes years to really learn to play
well," Bedell said.
Lacrosse combines the elements of many
team sports. The strategy and the field set-up
are much like soccer. But once you throw in
the violent contact of football, the fastbreak
action of basketball and the topsy-turvy chaos
of 20 players (10 on each side) scrambling for
a rubber ball the size of a baseball, you have a
sport like no other.
