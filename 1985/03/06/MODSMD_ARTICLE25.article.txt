The Stanford men's tennis team's match against San
Jose State was rained out yesterday, but. weather permit
ting, the No. 1 Cardinal will be back in action today
against another No. 1 team — Foothill College.
The match will probably not be as even as the rankings
are. Stanford is the top collegiate team in the country, and
Foothill is the nation's No. 1 community college team.
Thus, the Cardinal should not have too much difficulty
raising its perfect 10-0 record one more notch.
Foothill is currently 5-1 in Golden Gate Conference
competition. Nelson Banes, 2-2 in dual match competi
tion, plays No. 1 singles and No. 3 doubles for Foothill
with partner Cory Schultz.
Foothill's best doubles team, according to Coach Tom
Chivington, consists of Marcelo Pella and Layne Lyssy.
Pella and Lyssy have a record of 5-1, the one loss coming
at the hands of California.
Stanford proved this weekend that it has a few good
doubles teams of its own. Two Stanford doubles teams
played each other in the finals of the Pacific Coast
Doubles Championship in La Jolla.
Stanford's top doubles team, Jim Grabb and John Letts,
won the title in straight sets over the Cardinal's No. 2
doubles team, Derrick Rostagno and Pat McEnroe.
Gould will probably not play a full lineup today, nor in
Friday's home match against New Mexico. In Tuesday's
rescheduled match against San Jose State — the last
before spring break — the starters should see more action,
because Gould will want to see his full team play together
in the preseason finale.
