Stanford sophomore cyclist Russell
Mead won the Camellia Festival
criterium in Sacramento Saturday.
Mead out-sprinted the large field of
about 60 racers after 12 laps on the
fast one-mile circuit. He also won a
$ 10 prize early in the race.
Mead is a member of the Stanford
cycling club. Although the collegiate
racing season doesn't begin until
March 23, many Stanford riders are
gearing up by racing in events sanc
tioned by the cycling federation.
The Stanford cycling club, which is
co-ed, has about 40 members. The
collegiate racing season is spring
quarter and the club travels to col
leges throughout the state.
On April 27, Stanford will host a
criterium — a multi-lap race around a
circuit about one-mile long — that
encircles Stern and Wilbur dormitor
ies.
