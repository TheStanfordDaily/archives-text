## Panel clashes over divestment Group debates effectiveness of University action 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Staff writer 
"l think everybody is in agreement about
how bad apartheid is," said University Vice
President for Business and Finance William
Massy. "The question is what to do about
it."
Massy spoke last night at a Larkin House
panel on University divestment from com
panies in South Africa. The other panelists
were Political Science Prof. Richard Brody,
Education Prof. Joel Samoff, Law Prof.
William Gould and a graduate student in
the History Department, Wunyabari
Maloba. The panelists disagreed about eco
nomic and political effects of divestment.
Maloba, a native of Kenya, called for
people to "cease being cynical and skeptical
and take direct action.
"Divestment is the only solution," he
said. "Foreign investment means the black
man is being exploited. The economic posi
tion of the black man has not improved be
cause of foreign investment."
Brody, chairman of the University's Com
mission on Investment Responsibility,

argued that divestment was "an easy step to
take, but it leaves [the University] in a posi
tion of powerlessness."
"It's only after all other avenues have
been exhausted that we can recommend
divestment to the Board of Trustees,"
Brody said.
Samoff argued that the evidence was
"very clear" that divestment would be an ef
fective means of combating the "repugnant"
conditions in South Africa.
"The goal of the sanctions is not destruc
tion of the economy," Samoff said, "but
liberation of the people."
Gould called the Sullivan Principles, an
agreement promoting South African politi
cal progress, signed by American companies
active in South Africa, a "worthless sham"
that only diverts attention.
"I believe that economic pressure and the
threat of economic pressure is the one thing
the South African government under
stands," Gould said, calling on American
companies to use their influence to promote
free and autonomous trade unions, the elim
ination of the "cruel and inhumane" mi

grant labor system and the institution of a
fair and representative political system.
Massy disagreed with Gould's contention
that the Sullivan Principles were useless,
calling them "a good starting point in deter
mining the attitude of a company."
Massy explained that the University, as a
stockholder, has a variety of means to
protest South African policies.
"We should do what we can in the proxy
process as a shareholder to vote on
referenda and shareholder proposals to in
fluence the companies," Massy said. "We
have many ways to speak out."
Massy added that the University never
ruled out divestment as an appropriate ac
tion.
"We ought to consider divestment when
there is substantial social injury, after there
have been reasonable efforts to alleviate
those that have failed. That is what our cur
rent policy says."
Massy argued that divestment was not
necessarily a good means of protest.
