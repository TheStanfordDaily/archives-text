# State bill may tie draft registration to financial aid
## 
### BAIE NETZER Senior staff writer 
California aid to students will
soon be contingent on compliance
with federal draft registration laws
if a bill introduced by state Sen.
James Ellis (R-San Diego) is ap
proved by the state legislature.
If passed. Senate Bill 334 will
block state aid and aid from any
public or private post-secondary
institution in California unless stu
dent recipients provide evidence
of draft registration or exemption.
But because the Ellis bill is
similar to one defeated by the
state legislature last year, there is
no indication it will get far, ac
cording to Larry Horton, associate
vice president of Stanford's Office
of Public Affairs.
The bill has been assigned to the
Senate Education Committee, but
a date has not been set for consid
eration, according to the commit
tee's secretary.
In 1983, Congress passed the
Solomon Amendment, which ties
federal aid to students' compliance
with Selective Service regulations.
The Solomon law, an amendment
to the 1982 Defense Authoriza
tion Act, requires public and
private colleges to ask students for
verification of Selective Service
registration or exemption. Stan
ford now provides a form for stu
dents to indicate compliance or
exemption on a financial aid sup
plement sent to aid applicants.
The Ellis bill is similar to a bill
introduced to the state assembly
last year by Assemblyman Frank
Hill (R-Whittier). That bill was
killed in the Assembly Education
Committee.
Horton said the University has
opposed tying financial aid to draft
registration in the past. Horton
said the University's opposition to
the Solomon Amendment was
well known "but that [the
Solomon Amendment] passed."
"We think it's a mistake to try
and confuse these issues," Horton
said. "We don't like the confusion
of student aid with draft registra
tion."
Paul Knepprath, legislative ad
vocate for the California State
Student Association, a lobby
group representing students on the

19 state university campuses, said
the organization plans to work
against the Ellis bill.
"Our basic problem with this
bill is that it is clearly dis
criminatory," Knepprath said. "It
only affects those students who
cannot afford to pay for their own
education.
"That's a major and potentially
unconstitutional problem," he
said.
Knepprath said the bill would
put public and private universities
in the "sensitive position" of en
forcing state law.
In a verification study of forms
submitted by financial aid appli
cants last year, the U.S. Depart
ment of Education found that 95
to 98 percent of the students had
filled out their compliance forms
truthfully, according to Knep
prath.
Ellis, a retired Navy com
mander, feels strongly about re
quiring young men to register for
the draft, an assistant to Ellis told
the Times Tribune last week.
The Draft Information Service
of Menlo Park is also planning to
lobby against the bill, according to
spokeswoman Doris Jones.
"The state has no business at all
trying to enforce federal law,"
Jones said.
Because there are already
federal penalties for failing to reg
ister for the draft (five years in
prison or a $10,000 fine), Jones
said the Ellis bill is "totally un
necessary and inappropriate."
Jones also questioned how stu
dents could prove registration.
"They do get letters of verification
but when they get them, some stu
dents may not hold on to them."
she said.
According to Jones, plans for
lobbying against the Ellis bill in
clude contacting other organiza
tions throughout the state and a
call to state Sen. Rebecca Morgan
(R-Los Altos Hills), who sits on
the Senate Education Committee.
Federal draft registration law
requires males between the ages of
18 and 21 to register with the
Selective Service.
