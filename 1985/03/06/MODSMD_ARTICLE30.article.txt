Reagan nominates Moore to !NSF post
President Reagan has announced his intention to
nominate Hoover Senior Fellow John Moore as
deputy director of the National Science Foundation
(NSF).
NSF is responsible for the overall health of sci
ence and engineering across all disciplines and is
the principal federal agency supporting basic re
search in the physical sciences and engineering in
the United States.
The foundation awards grants and contracts to
more than 2,000 colleges, universities and research
institutions throughout the United States. Its
budget for the current fiscal year is approximately
$ 1.5 billion.
A senior fellow and associate director at the
Hoover Institution since 1981, Moore will be on
leave of absence while at NSF. He has served as a
member of the National Science Board since 1982,
having been appointed to that post by Reagan. The
board is the policy-making arm of the NSF.
W. Glenn Campbell, director of the Hoover In
stitution, said, "I am delighted that a member of
our senior staff has been seleted to serve the nation
in this capacity. As a former member of the Na
tional Science Board, I fully appreciate the great
importance of NSF to our scientific and engineer
ing strength."
Vaccine combats urinary tract infections
A potential vaccine to protect women against
serious complications of the most common type of

urinary tract infection has been developed by Stan
ford Medical School researchers.
The vaccine blocks bacteria that cause urinary
tract infections from spreading to the kidneys,
where they can cause more severe disease, the re
searchers said.
The vaccine, a purified protein produced through
recombinant DNA techniques, has so far been
proven effective in mice with experimentally
induced urinary tract infections.
It will be tested in people, probably within the
coming year, said Dr. Gary Schoolnik, assistant
professor of medicine and medical mirobiology at
the medical school.
Blood center to continue with own AIDS test
Stanford Blood Center plans to continue using its
own screening test for AIDS even after a newly
developed and highly publicized test becomes
available here in about a month, an official said
yesterday.
"We're very interested in this new test, and we
are anxious to begin testing it to determine if it is
effective. But we are not going to throw out the
successful and highly accurate test we have been
using for 19 months until we get some hard
evidence that the new screening is at least as accu
rate as what we have now," said Edgar Engleman,
associate professor of pathology and medicine and
medical director of the blood center.
On July 1, 1983, Stanford reportedly became the
first blood bank in the nation to begin screening
blood for the deadly AIDS, short for acquired

immune deficiency syndrome. Since then, no cases
of AIDS have been reported in Stanford Blood
Center recipients who received the screened blood,
although two recipients who had received blood
from several centers, including Stanford before the
procedure was begun here, subsequently con
tracted AIDS and one has died, Engleman said.
Kennedy named to Carnegie Forum council
University President Donald Kennedy has been
named to the Advisory Council of the newly
formed Carnegie Forum on Education and the
Economy.
Projected to have a 10-year life, the forum will
bring together leading Americans to help chart a
course for education policy that reflects a world
economy, according to David Hamburg, president
of the Carnegie Corp. of New York, who will per
sonally head the Advisory Council.
Buchanan to head operations
Ralph Buchanan has assumed the post of direc
tor of Operations, Maintenance and Utilities at the
University.
Buchanan, an electrical engineer, will direct the
activities of 250 employees responsible for plan
ning and implementing the operations, mainte
nance and preservation of facilities and grounds
and for providing reliable utility service. The
departmental budget is approximately $35 million
annually.
