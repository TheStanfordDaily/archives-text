# No stadium at Stanford
## 
### 
University President Donald Ken
nedy said yesterday that Stanford
land near Interstate 280 would not be
a possible site for a new stadium for
the San Francisco Giants professional
baseball team, according to Univer
sity News and Publications.
An article in Sunday's San Jose
Mercury News said, "Local sites . . .
all of which have been floated as
stadium possibilities by public and
private groups in recent days, include
. . . Stanford University property near

Interstate 280."
Kennedy said undeveloped Stan
ford lands are to be used for academic
purposes and a new baseball stadium
does not fit that criterion, according
to University News and Publications.
The Mercury News said the land
was under consideration because
"Giants officials have said an appro
priate stadium would have to be near
major freeways and would have to be
built on at least 100 acres of land to
accommodate surrounding parking."
