# Combiths dies at 70
## 
### 
Elizabeth Combiths, who worked
40 years at the Stanford Board of
Trustees office in San Francisco, died
Sunday night at the Marin Convales
cent and Rabilitation Home in
Tiburon. She was 70.
In an unusual resolution of ap
preciation on Combith's retirement in
1980, the Board of Trustees said she
had "contributed immeasurably to
the smooth functioning of the Uni
versity's investment operations and of
the Board of Trustees."
The trustees noted that "she was
the presence through whose sure,
street-wise hands hundreds of million
of dollars in the University's endow
ment and expendable fund assets
have been invested in the securities
markets â€” negotiations she carried

out with an eye to yield that won a
high return for the University and the
respect of brokers with whom she
dealt."
A longtime colleague described
Combiths as "Mrs. Stanford in San
Francisco. Like a city editor, she
could do an awful lot of things at the
same time."
The daughter of a newspaper
editor, Combiths was born Jan. 25,
1915, in Helena, Mont.
A memorial service is planned for 2
p.m. Saturday at the Crippen and
Flynn Chapel, 400 Woodside Rd.,
Redwood City.
The family prefers memorial con
tributions to Stanford. These may be
sent to 301 Encina Hall, Stanford,
CA 94305.
