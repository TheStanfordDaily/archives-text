# Playboy to visit Farm for pictorial

### INDRA SEHDEV Staff writer 
A representative from Playboy
magazine will visit campus early next
month to recruit Stanford women for a
photo feature on "The Women of the
Pac-10," according to Paul
Engleman, the magazine's publicity
director.
Playboy's photographers have been
to Stanford before, Engleman noted.
In 1978, Playboy published a special
issue featuring women from the col
leges of the Pacific 10 Conference.
This year's Pac-10 pictorial is
scheduled for release in October,
Engleman said.
Student reaction to Playboy's
campus visit is varied.
"I think it's really sick," said soph
omore Anne Marie Locke. "I
strongly object to it because it's really
objectifying women. I hope that none
of the women here would think that
it's an honor to be in the magazine."
"I hear that Playboy has literary
merit, though I've never read it,"
Locke added. "If that's true, I don't
see why it has to be gender
confined."
In contrast, sophomore Martie
McKinney said, "I have nothing
against them coming here. I wouldn't
look down on someone for modeling
for it."
Said sophomore Molly Smock,
"Any woman who finds it offensive
doesn't have to do it and doesn't have
to read the magazine."
Since 1977, Playboy has been visit
ing schools of athletic conferences
and photographing female students,
Engleman said. "The first time we did
it was in 1977. We photographed the
girls of the Big Ten. Since then, we
have been to the Ivy League schools,
the Atlantic Coast Conference, the
Big Eight and the Southwest and
Southeast Conferences.
"At some schools, there will be a
fairly active feminist group which
protests Playboy's being there," he

said. "The form of the opposition
usually involves picketing of the
photographer's hotel, letters to the
editor of the student paper and the
student paper's refusing to run our
advertisement."
"Over the years there has been a
decline in opposition from feminist
groups, just as there has been a
decline in political activism of any
kind on campuses," Engleman added.
David Chan, the Playboy photog
rapher assigned to photograph col
lege women of different athletic con
ferences, elaborated on opposition he
has encountered.

Chan said that when he came to
Stanford in 1978, he faced "no major
opposition. Usually we encounter
nothing on the West Coast as
compared to in the East," Chan said.
"We encountered protest at every
Ivy League school when we went
there in 1979," Chan said.
Chan offered insights into the dif
ferences in the opposition East and
West Coast schools have posed.
"In the East, they band together
and protest for something to do.
Here, they don't need to look for
things to do. They already have so

much of an outlet because of the
weather."
Chan is at UCLA this week and
will be at USC next week. "So far,
about 40 (UCLA) girls have applied.
We might get 100 applications, but
we can shoot only three or four girls
at each school," he said. Chan said he
usually gets the most applications
from women at Arizona schools.
"What we are looking for at UCLA
is a good cross section of girls," Chan
said. "Most people think of a South
ern California girl as blonde, having a
dark tan. We might shoot one girl like
that, but we want a variety.

"The Southwest Conference is my
favorite. There are a lot of beautiful
girls there, always a big response and
short distances to travel from school
to school," Chan said.
"The Pac-10 is my second favorite
area," he said. "It's more hectic,
though. There's a lot of traveling be
tween schools."
Engleman explained how Chan
operates at a school once he arrives
there. "He goes to a hotel near
campus, runs an ad in the student
paper and waits for women to
schedule an interview."

Chan noted, "The women get paid
if we shoot them, regardless of
whether we put their picture in the
magazine."
Payments fall into three categories,
he explained. "For a clothed shot, we
pay $100. For a semi-nude shot, it's
$200, and for a fully nude shot,
$400."
Sophomore Heidi Minch gave her
opinion on the money paid to women
who pose. "On the one hand, I don't
feel it exploits women because it is
their choice whether or not to do it.
On the other hand, it is exploitative
because of the money involved. Col
lege students aren't financially inde
pendent, and the money involved
might make it attractive to someone
who might not otherwise consider it,"
Minch said.
"If they decided to do an issue on
women who hold executive positions,
I doubt they'd get a good response,"
she said.
Sophomore Abe Wu offered a con
trasting view. "It's true that they're
offering four times as much incentive
for someone to pose nude," he said.
"If you have some convictions,
though, you're not going to sell out
for the extra $300. The money
doesn't really come into it.
"I don't think it's exploitative be
cause they're making it clear that it's
completely voluntary, even though I
don't support what they are doing,"
Wu said.
Engleman said that, despite oppo
sition, Playboy has never had a
shortage of college women "who
come out, at least out of curiosity."
When asked to comment on
Playboy's visit to Stanford, Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons said, "I
mark it as one of the great un-events
of the year.
"I guess I'd say that it's something
that the people in the institution don't
have much to say about," Lyons said.
"Students have the right to make up

Engleman said. "The first time we did
it was in 1977. We photographed the
girls of the Big Ten. Since then, we
have been to the Ivy League schools,
the Atlantic Coast Conference, the
Big Eight and the Southwest and
Southeast Conferences.
"At some schools, there will be a
fairly active feminist group which
protests Playboy's being there," he

said. "The form of the opposition
usually involves picketing of the
photographer's hotel, letters to the
editor of the student paper and the
student paper's refusing to run our
advertisement."
"Over the years there has been a
decline in opposition from feminist
groups, just as there has been a
decline in political activism of any
kind on campuses," Engleman added.
David Chan, the Playboy photog
rapher assigned to photograph col
lege women of different athletic con
ferences, elaborated on opposition he
has encountered.

Chan said that when he came to
Stanford in 1978, he faced "no major
opposition. Usually we encounter
nothing on the West Coast as
compared to in the East," Chan said.
"We encountered protest at every
Ivy League school when we went
there in 1979," Chan said.
Chan offered insights into the dif
ferences in the opposition East and
West Coast schools have posed.
"In the East, they band together
and protest for something to do.
Here, they don't need to look for
things to do. They already have so

much of an outlet because of the
weather."
Chan is at UCLA this week and
will be at USC next week. "So far,
about 40 (UCLA) girls have applied.
We might get 100 applications, but
we can shoot only three or four girls
at each school," he said. Chan said he
usually gets the most applications
from women at Arizona schools.
"What we are looking for at UCLA
is a good cross section of girls," Chan
said. "Most people think of a South
ern California girl as blonde, having a
dark tan. We might shoot one girl like
that, but we want a variety.

"The Southwest Conference is my
favorite. There are a lot of beautiful
girls there, always a big response and
short distances to travel from school
to school," Chan said.
"The Pac-10 is my second favorite
area," he said. "It's more hectic,
though. There's a lot of traveling be
tween schools."
Engleman explained how Chan
operates at a school once he arrives
there. "He goes to a hotel near
campus, runs an ad in the student
paper and waits for women to
schedule an interview."

Chan noted, "The women get paid
if we shoot them, regardless of
whether we put their picture in the
magazine."
Payments fall into three categories,
he explained. "For a clothed shot, we
pay $100. For a semi-nude shot, it's
$200, and for a fully nude shot,
$400."
Sophomore Heidi Minch gave her
opinion on the money paid to women
who pose. "On the one hand, I don't
feel it exploits women because it is
their choice whether or not to do it.
On the other hand, it is exploitative
because of the money involved. Col
lege students aren't financially inde
pendent, and the money involved
might make it attractive to someone
who might not otherwise consider it,"
Minch said.
"If they decided to do an issue on
women who hold executive positions,
I doubt they'd get a good response,"
she said.
Sophomore Abe Wu offered a con
trasting view. "It's true that they're
offering four times as much incentive
for someone to pose nude," he said.
"If you have some convictions,
though, you're not going to sell out
for the extra $300. The money
doesn't really come into it.
"I don't think it's exploitative be
cause they're making it clear that it's
completely voluntary, even though I
don't support what they are doing,"
Wu said.
Engleman said that, despite oppo
sition, Playboy has never had a
shortage of college women "who
come out, at least out of curiosity."
When asked to comment on
Playboy's visit to Stanford, Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons said, "I
mark it as one of the great un-events
of the year.
"I guess I'd say that it's something
that the people in the institution don't
have much to say about," Lyons said.
"Students have the right to make up
their own minds."

A representative from Playboy
magazine will visit campus early next
month to recruit Stanford women for a
photo feature on "The Women of the
Pac-10," according to Paul
Engleman, the magazine's publicity
director.
Playboy's photographers have been
to Stanford before, Engleman noted.
In 1978, Playboy published a special
issue featuring women from the col
leges of the Pacific 10 Conference.
This year's Pac-10 pictorial is
scheduled for release in October,
Engleman said.
Student reaction to Playboy's
campus visit is varied.
"I think it's really sick," said soph
omore Anne Marie Locke. "I
strongly object to it because it's really
objectifying women. I hope that none
of the women here would think that
it's an honor to be in the magazine."
"I hear that Playboy has literary
merit, though I've never read it,"
Locke added. "If that's true, I don't
see why it has to be gender
confined."
In contrast, sophomore Martie
McKinney said, "I have nothing
against them coming here. I wouldn't
look down on someone for modeling
for it."
Said sophomore Molly Smock,
"Any woman who finds it offensive
doesn't have to do it and doesn't have
to read the magazine."
