# Delta Sigma Theta receives recognition

### MARK LAWRENCE Staff writer 
The Delta Sigma Theta sorority has gained offi
cial recognition from the University, more than five
years after the sorority formed at Stanford, Direc
tor of the Row Diana Conklin said yesterday.
The 22-member sorority, a group that serves the
black community primarily but that is open to all
races, has been working on several community
projects, and now will be able to associate itself
with Stanford, use University facilities and do proj
ects on campus, sorority President Theresa Fields
said.
"We have been doing a lot of good stuff, but

nobody knows who we are. Now we can use our
name, and people will know us," said Sandi Ford,
the sorority's vice president of internal affairs.
Delta Sigma Theta began seeking recognition on
Feb. 6. 1980, when a petition was submitted to the
University by members of the unofficial Stanford
chapter, according to Conklin. However, until last
week, the Stanford chapter of the world's largest
black Greek letter organization was unable to-get a
letter from the sorority's national organization
granting it local autonomy.
Conklin said the University does not recognize
sororities and fraternities without such a letter.
"They have been in the wings for a long time. They

had to work really hard to get their letter," Conklin
said.
Fields said the national approval means that the
local chapter has the right to select its members and
that "nobody from the national organization has to
approve things you do."
The Delta Sigma Thetas now plan several proj
ects. "We've already got things in the works," Mar
tin said.
The recognition of Delta Sigma Theta follows
last week's recognition of the Delta Delta Delta
sorority and brings the total of recognized Stanford
sororities to nine.
