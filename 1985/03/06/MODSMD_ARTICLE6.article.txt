USSR threatens arms buildup
WASHINGTON — The Soviet Union "will develop and perfect (its)
strategic offensive arms" rather than negotiate reductions if the United
States continues its "Star Wars" missile-defense research program, Col.
Gen. Nikolai Chervov, a senior member of the Soviet general staff, said
here yesterday.
Chervov, accompanying Politburo member Vladimir Shcherbitsky in a
visit to the United States, said, "We are not going to sit on our hands and
wait until you decide whether or not it would be worthy to deploy such a
system.. . . You are working on your system, and that means we'll start
perfecting our strategic offensive arms.
"This is not something for the future. It is something which is going to
happen in practice," added Chervov, whose rank is equivalent to that of
a U.S. lieutenant general and who heads the branch of the Soviet general
staff with jurisdiction over military participation in arms control negotia
tions.
Amid final U.S. preparations for the arms talks, President Reagan
won a measure of support yesterday for his Strategic Defense Initiative,
dubbed Star Wars, from Italian Prime Minister Bettino Craxi in a
\ meeting find working lunch.
Reagan told reporters after the two hours of discussions that Craxi
"assured me of Italy's full understanding of the program's objectives,
and we agreed on the great potential benefits this program could pro
vide."
Last week, Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko appealed to
Craxi in Rome to oppose the SDI, saying withdrawal of the Star Wars
plan is "absolutely essential" for success in the arms control negotia
tions.
Craxi told a news conference after his White House meeting, "I think
the United States will not give up their idea of their research program"
on space defense and said "it does not seem correct" to make such a
U.S. concession a condition for broader arms control progress.

Iraq will retaliate for shelling
BAGDHAD, Iraq — Iraq announced last night that it would bomb 30
Iranian cities in retaliation for Iranian shelling of the border city of
Basra.
A statement read over official Baghdad radio urged inhabitants of the
cities, including Bushehr, Bandar Khomeini, Islamabad and Ahvaz to
leave before the bombing starts at 10 a.m. today.
Iran started shelling Basra, Iraq's second largest city, at 8 p.m. yester
day but the Iraqi radio report gave no details on casualties or damage.
A few hours before the shelling of Basra, Teheran radio warned its I
million inhabitants to flee. Iran saivi that it was retaliating for Iraqi air
raids on the city of Ahvaz Monday that killed at least 11 civilians.
The Iranian attack shattered an eight-month United Nations
sponsored agreement to suspend attacks on civilian areas.
Tehran radio quoted Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati as telling
the United Nations that it was forced to shell Iraqi cities, but he said Iran
would warn residents of each city marked for shelling.
Iran accused Iraq of attacking an unfinished nuclear plant at Bushehr
Monday, for the third time in recent months.
It ajso said that it would boycott the U.N, Security Council debate on
the condition of 50,000 prisoners held by both sides. Iran said it would
not accept trading the large number of Iraqis it holds for the much
smaller number of Iranians held by Iraq unless Iraq accounts for tens of
thousands bf Iranian civilians allegedly abducted by its forces.
Contras willing to hold teritory
WASHINGTON — Military commanders of the largest Nicaraguan
rebel group said yesterday they Would be willing to capture and attempt
to hold territory within Nicaragua if that would convince Congress to
provide them with more military aid.
If successful, such an action could lead to the establishment of an al
ternative government that the United States could formally recognize
and aid openly.
President Reagan said in a recent interview that the current leftist
Sandinista government of Nicaragua "is not a government" but "a fac
tion of the revolution," and that Congress should approve further aid to
the rebels who "want the original goals of the revolution instituted."
Enrique Bermudez, chief of military operations of the Nicaraguan
Democratic Force (FDN by its Spanish initials), said in response to ques
tions at a news conference that "no official request" had been made that
the rebel forces abandon their hit-and-run tactics in favor of holding
ground.
He said such a request would have to come "from the ones who are
going to give the funds" because it would result in an all-out military
confrontation with the vastly more powerful Sandinista army.
"We have the capacity to do it," Bermudez said. "It would be costly
for us, but we will do any sacrifice in order to get the funds."
Many members of Congress who refuse to support further covert aid
to the rebels are still highly critical of the Sandinistas, and the Reagan
administration has been hunting for some way to provide the rebels with
open assistance.
But officials have shied away from the idea of recognizing a rival gov
ernment within Nicaragua, concerned that the rebels, faced with defeat
in a pitched battle with the Sandinistas, might then demand direct U.S.
military intervention.

New Zealand policy under fire
WELLINGTON, New Zealand — Pressure is building here against
New Zealand's anti-nuclear-warship stand, with one group yesterday
calling it "worrying" and joining others seeking a referendum on the
issue that has rocked the ANZUS (Australia, New Zealand, United
States) defense alliance.
The country's war veterans yesterday began to falter in their support
for the Labor government's anti-nuclear policies, calling for an urgent
meeting with Prime Minister David Lange.
Returned Servicemen's Association President Sir William Leuchars
suid the latest developments in the ANZUS row were "worrying" and
that the country "must now decide on the issue."
"We are most disappointed in the postponement of the ANZUS coun
cil meeting because I think a lot could be discussed at that particular
meeting," Leuchars said. "Everybody says ANZUS still exists — then
why aren't we talking within it?"
(In a statement made available in Canberra yesterday, New Zealand
acting Prime Minister Geoffry Palmer announced that Australian Prime
Mimister Bob Hawke and Lange were to meet in Canberra next month
to discuss bilateral defense arrangements following the breakdown of
ANZUS.)
The 34-year-old ANZUS pact is a cornerstone of New Zealand
defense policy.
Bush visits Ethiopian relief camp
K ASSAL A. Sudan — Thousands of refugees from Ethiopia's civil war
jammed the narrow paths of a Sudanese famine relief camp yesterday
for a visit by Vice President George Bush, who was handed an appeal for
American aid in feeding up to 3 million starving people still living in that
nation's embattled northern provinces. v
The plea came in a letter given to Bush as he toured Wad Sheriffe, a
sprawling maze of thatch huts near Kassala that houses 66,000 of the
600.000 Ethiopians who have fled to Sudan. Members of an Eritrean
refugee council who wrote the letter asserted that food intended for the
drought-ravaged north has been diverted by the Ethiopian government
to feed its army, which is battling insurgents in Eritrea and Tigre
provinces.
Bush, who called the refugees' situation "a great human tragedy," told
the council he hopes there will be a role for the United States "in solving
the ugly political problem you talk about."
However, a senior American official accompanying Bush said later
that the United States "continues to support, as we always have, the ter
ritorial integrity of Ethiopia. I think what he (Bush) was saying is that
when people use famine as an instrument of war. that's unacceptable."
Bush criticized the Ethiopian government for blocking a
"reconciliation' that might allow the camp's residents to return home.
