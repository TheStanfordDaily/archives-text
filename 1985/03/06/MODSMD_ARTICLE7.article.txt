# Committee slashes defense budget
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Republican-controlled
Senate Budget Committee yesterday rebelled
against a continuation of President Reagan's mili
tary buildup and voted 18-4 to allow next year's
Defense Department budget to grow only enough
to keep pace with inflation.
In the first congressional vote of the year on defi
cit reductions, the committee approved spending
targets that would slash Reagan's proposed military
outlays of nearly $1 trillion over the next three
years by $79.3 billion, starting with $11 billion in
fiscal 1986.
The committee's action represented the heaviest
blow to the Pentagon budget since Reagan began
his defense buildup four years ago by winning con
gressional approval for an average after-inflation
increase for defense of about 9 percent a year.
The president had requested a 6 percent after
inflation increase for the next fiscal year, refusing
to compromise and saying as recently as Saturday
in his radio address that "as long as I'm president
we are not going back to the days when America
was fast becoming an impotent democracy, too
weak to meet its defense commitments."
Under the Budget Committee's plan, spending
authority for defense would rise from $293 billion
to $303 billion next year, but the increase would
cover only the costs of inflation, estimated at about
4 percent for the year.
The plan would allow "real," or after-inflation,
increases of 3 percent in each of the following two

years, which also is less than Reagan requested al
though not as dramatic a cut as the committee ap
proved for fiscal 1986.
The plan came from the Democratic side of the
table under sponsorship of Sen. Ernest Hollings
(D-S.C.). But it was backed by two-thirds of the
Republicans on the panel, including its chairman.
Sen. Pete Domenici (R-N.M.) who had proposed a
3 percent after-inflation increase only the day
before.
The only senators voting against it were
Republicans Orrin Hatch, Utah, Robert Kasten,
Wisconsin, Dan Quayle, Indiana, and Steve
Symms, Idaho.
All Democrats on the committee supported the
proposal after a move to freeze spending at this
year's level without any increase for inflation failed
14-8.
Although the committee-approved figures repre
sent only targets for inclusion in a non-binding
budget resolution, Domenici told the committee he
would push for legislation that would "to the maxi
mum extent possible" nail down the proposed
limits for the next three years.
Yesterday's vote offered the first positive sign so
far that Senate Republicans, who failed in two
months of intensive efforts to reach an accord on
deficit reductions, may yet be able to put together a
package, although major difficulties remain.
"It's the beginning of the beginning," said Senate
Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-Kan.) after the

vote.
Domenici was expected to use the big defense
cut as leverage to force major domestic spending
cuts as well, including an across-the-board freeze
on all programs but those targeted at the poor, aug
mented by more severe selective cuts proposed by
Reagan in his budget.
The fact that eight Republicans joined all 10
Democrats in supporting the Hollings proposal also
indicated that budget deals could be cut on a bipar
tisan basis, raising risks for the administration.
It may turn out to be significant that a majority
of Republicans and Democrats pulled together on
defense, despite an acrimonious fight earlier in the
day over whether to use administration economic
projections that Democrats contended would lead
to an underestimate of future deficits. Republicans
prevailed on a party-line vote on that issue, and
Democrats were infuriated. Domenici then fudged
the issue by agreeing to use the administration's
projections and less rosy ones prepared by the
Congressional Budget Office and favored by the
Democrats.
Even before the committee's action on defense,
Dole suggested strongly that it was time for the
White House to compromise on military spending.
Urging that the Budget Committee send its
budget proposal to the floor "without recommen
dation," he said congressional leaders should then
meet with Reagan and Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger to work out a compromise.
