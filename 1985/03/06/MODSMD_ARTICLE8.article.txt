# Pentagon suspends weapons payments

### 
WASHINGTON — Secretary of
Defense Caspar Weinberger, an
nouncing a tough new policy yester
day on overcharging by defense con
tractors, suspended about $35 million
in Pentagon payments to General
Dynamics Corp. pending a review of
charges that the company has consis
tently billed the government for im
proper expenses.
According to Pentagon spokesman
Michael Burch, General Dynamics
officials allegedly billed the govern
ment for such unauthorized expenses
as corporate trips and entertainment,
advertising — and, in one case,
boarding an executive's dog in a ken
nel.
Weinberger, in a speech to an
American Legion convention, said he
ordered the 30-day halt in payment
of general and administrative ex
penses because General Dynamics
was "billing us, as part of their over
head costs, (for) a lot of expenses that
did not benefit the government and
had nothing to do with the contract
involved."
He said the suspension would be
extended if the Pentagon did not
complete its inquiry within a month.
When a House subcommittee last
week held hearings on alleged over
charging by a number of defense con
tractors, "we found that General
Dynamics' testimony was nauseat
ing," Burch declared.
The disclosures in congressional
testimony "may even involve some
criminal matters," Weinberger told
the Legionnaires, and cases of possi
ble fraud are being investigated by

the Department of Justice.
If the Pentagon investigation shows
any improper billings, General
Dynamics will return the money im
mediately, company spokesman Peter
Connolly said in a statement. "The
company believes it will be able to
satisfy the Defense Department's
concerns regarding the validity of its
billing procedures," Connolly said.
General Dynamics, with
headquarters in St. Louis, is the na
tion's largest defense contractor and
was awarded $6.8 billion in govern
ment contracts in fiscal 1983. It is a
major manufacturer of F-16 jet
fighters, Trident submarines and at
tack subs, Tomahawk cruise missiles,
and Army tanks and other weapons.
The 30-day suspension affects
about 8 percent of the company's
total monthly billings to the govern
ment, according to Connolly's state
ment, an amount estimated at $35
million. The bulk of government pay
ments to General Dynamics, not af
fected by Weinberger's suspension
order, covers services and deliveries
of hardware for various weapons.
In the future, Weinberger said, all
defense contractors must "certify, un
der penalty of perjury," that their
charges do not include political, en
tertainment or other expenses not di
rectly beneficial to the government.
Such certification "will do a lot
toward eliminating these improper
charges," Weinberger said. "After
our auditors get through, we simply
will refuse to pay anything of that
kind."
