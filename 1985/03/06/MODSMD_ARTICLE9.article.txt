# Farm-relief bill goes to Reagan
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Led by
farm-state Democrats seeking a
showdown with President Reagan,
the House passed and sent to the
White House emergency farm
credit legislation that appeared
destined to be killed by a presi
dential veto.
The vote of 255 to 168 came as
hundreds of debt-plagued farmers
swarmed to Capitol, insisting that
emergency financial aid is still not
enough to help them survive their
current difficulties. An estimated
5 percent of the nation's farmers
will go bankrupt this year.
At the White House, Deputy
Press Secretary Larry Speakes
predicted Reagan would "act very
quickly" — possibly today — to
veto the measure, which he con
tends is too costly. The bill would
provide $1.85 billion in loan
guarantees to American farmers
as well as $175 million for famine
relief in Africa.
Democrats hailed the bill's pas
sage as a political victory for them
that proves Reagan does not care
about the plight of America's
farmers. Yet they held out little
hope of reversing the president's
veto because both House and Sen
ate votes for the bill fell short of
the two-thirds necessary in
Congress to override a veto.
"Reagan can veto the bill, but
he cannot veto the problem,"
declared House Speaker Thomas

"Tip" O'Neill (D-Mass). "The
president seems determined to
surprise and disappoint the people
who elected him. Maybe he wants
the farmers to say 'uncle' before
he gives them the help they need."
House Majority Leader Jim
Wright (D-Texas) argued that
Congress, which previously has
provided emergency financial help
for New York City, Chrysler Corp.
and the Penn Central rail system,
must not deny emergency aid to
farmers. He said that the
Democrats "ask no more for
American farmers than what
America has willingly done for
other segments of our society."
Farm-state Republicans, many
of them obviously uncomfortable
with the GOP stance on the credit
issue, argued against the measure
on grounds that it would be point
less to pass it in the face of
Reagan's veto threat.
Secretary of Agriculture John
Block and other administration of
ficials have argued that the
Democrats' bill is unnecessary be
cause the Department of
Agriculture already has agreed to
guarantee 90 percent of each farm
loan granted this year by banks
that will write off at least 10 per
cent of the principle or an equiva
lent amount in interest.
Democrats and Republicans
had disagreed on the cost of the
farm bail-out.
