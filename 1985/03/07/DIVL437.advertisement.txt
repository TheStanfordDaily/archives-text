TO STUDY LAW,
GO TO STANFORD LAW SCHOOL
TO LEARN TO FLY,
JOIN THE STANFORD FLYING CLUB!
Nothing more logical than that. Quality and professionalism typify the
Stanford Law School.
That excellence, quality and professionalism, and even a lot of sheer
fun, you'll also find if you obtain your pilot education through the
Stanford Flying Club.
It is easier than you think: most members obtain a Solo-Pilot License
with only 9 to 1B hours of flight time. Many pilots solo for less than $572.
Because experienced instructor-pilots and the Stanford Flying Club
are waiting for you: get your nose out of the books once in a while, and
take to the sky!
So Join the Stanford Flying Club. Leam to fly. To schedule a lesson, or
just chat or get free information, call Leslie at 851-2400 (1:00-5:30) and
decide for yourself.
You'll find out in a hurry why choosing the
Stanford Flying Club is like
choosing Stanford Law School. ft
