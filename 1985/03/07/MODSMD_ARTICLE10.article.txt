Doctors use new heart
IUCSON, Ariz. — Doctors at the University of
Arizona at Tucson yesterday announced that
they had implanted a new version of a temporary
artificial heart in a dying 32-year-old man after a
human heart transplant had failed.
A Food and Drug Administration spokesman
said last night that the operation went ahead
despite a warning that federal permission was
needed for human experimentation with un
proven medical devices.
University of Arizona spokesman Mike Letson
said the mechanical heart was developed at St.
Luke's Hospital in Phoenix. It had never before
been implanted in a human.
He said the patient "has been stabilized" fol
lowing a three-hour operation yesterday after
noon and remained in the operating room as the
search continued for a new human heart for
transplant. University of Arizona doctors said the
implant was intended to be a temporary, stopgap
measure.
Details of the surgery remained sketchy while
a press release was being prepared.
FDA spokesman David Duarte said that, in
going ahead with the surgery without federal
permission, "the concern is that the law has been
violated."
Duarte said that "we haven't gotten all the
facts," but that action against the Arizona institu
tion could range from reprimand to court action.
FDA spokesman William Grigg added:

"Congress decided that people shouldn't be ex
perimented on willy-nilly, and that's the law we
are trying to uphold. People who do experimen
tal procedures without permission could con
ceivably be banned from further experimental
work that the federal government funds or reg
ulates."
Dems back arms talks
WASHINGTON (AP) — Saying partisanship
ends at the water's edge, Democratic congres
sional leaders yesterday gave President Reagan
the support he sought as his negotiating team
prepared to depart for a new round of arms con
trol talks in Geneva.
Reagan and his negotiators met with congres
sional leaders for an hour to review the general
stance the United States intends to take when it
opens talks with the Soviets on March 12.
"The Soviets will be looking at how united we
are as a nation," Reagan told the group, accord
ing to White House spokesman Larry Speakes.
"We now see the possibility of some real hope for
progress."
House Majority Leader Jim Wright of Texas
said he and other Democrats put aside their dif
ferences with the president to express hope for
success in Geneva.
"I'm simply saying partisanship must stop at
the water's edge, and that the president and the
negotiators who are attempting to represent our

country at this time, in this very important
negotiation with the Soviet Union, enjoy the
complete, unqualified backing of all members of
the House, Democratic and Republican alike,"
Wright said.
Fed warns, stocks fall
NEW YORK — The stock market took its
sharpest drop in more than three weeks yester
day, responding to words of caution from Chair
man Paul Volckerof the Federal Reserve.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell
11.48 to 1,280.37, for its biggest decline since it
lost 13.91 points on Feb. 11.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange
came to 116.94 million shares, against 116.37
million Tuesday.
Appearing before the House Budget Commit
tee, Volcker repeated his oft-stated concerns
about deficits in the government's budget and the
nation's international trade accounts.
He said one danger raised by these circum
stances was the possibility of a "very sharp"
decline in the dollar from its recent lofty levels in
foreign exchange.
That would be likely, he suggested, to cause a
significant dropoff in foreign investors' enthusi
asm for U.S. investments — a situation he said
this country is ill prepared for.
