Moreno hearing opens
LOS ANGELES — The extradition hearing of
former Mexico City Police Chief Arturo Durazo
Moreno opened in federal court yesterday with
U.S. prosecutors charging that the once-powerful
official used his position to amass "incredible
wealth" during his six-year term that ended in
1982.
Durazo, 68, whose palatial Mexico City home
is now a federal "museum to corruption," is
charged in his homeland with extorting payments
from subordinates, failing to pay customs duty on
his imported belongings, and possessing illegal
arms.
The hearing is being held to determine if there
is probable cause to extradite Durazo to stand
trial in Mexico. The case is being heard here be
cause Durazo established residency in Los An
geles when he left Mexico in early 1983, after his
term in office expired.
Phone rate hike denied
SAN FRANCISCO — Saying telephone cus
tomers deserve to benefit from high-tech labor
savings, the state Public Utilities Commission
unanimously rejected Pacific Bell's request for a
12.8 percent rate increase yesterday and ordered
a slight rate decrease.
Pacific Bell, which has 8.2 million customers,
had asked for a $492 million increase to cover in
flation and other expenses since its last rate in

crease in mid-1984.
But the commission said inflation is down,
Pacific Bell has not proved its claims of substan
tial cost increases, and the company has overes
timated its labor costs and underestimated pro
ductivity from new high-technology equipment.
Instead, the commission ordered a rate
decrease of $18 million, or 0.31 percent.
"It is time for the ratepayer to start benefiting
from this modernization," said PUC member
Victor Calvo before the 5-0 vote.
Barge hits restaurant
OAKLAND — A 100-foot sand and gravel
barge smashed into a waterfront restaurant last
night, damaging a pier and threatening to set
nearly 100 boats adrift, authorities said.
There were no injuries reported.
The barge, wich bore the name Tidewater
Sand & Gravel, smashed into a 50-foot sailboat
at the foot of the restaurant, said Oakland Assis
tant Fire Chief Bob McGue.
The barge and the tug that pushed it, the Ellen,
apparently lost power and drifted into the
Central Basin marrina at 9:18 p.m., McGue said.
"It ripped up most of the utilities in the marina
there," he said. "There was also heavy damage to
pilings and floats that hold the boats in place."
Elections panel acts
SACRAMENTO — The Senate elections

committee voted yesterday to require greater
public scrutiny in reapportionment, make ballot
analyses easier to read and end ticket-splitting in
races for governor and lieutenant governor.
But the panel, formally known as the Elections
and Reapportionment Committee, put off a vote
on a bill that would make it a misdemeanor for
anyone to distribute campaign literature that
resembles a public document.
The ticket-splitting proposal, a constitutional
amendment by Sen. Leroy Greene (D-
Sacramento). is the latest attempt to break Cali
fornia voters of their new habit of electing top of
ficials from different political parties.
Former Gov. Jerry Brown was a Democorat
and his second lieutenant governor. Mike Curb,
was a Republican. The current governor, George
Deukmejian. is a Republican, and the lieutenant
governor, Leo McCarthy, is a Democrat.
Deukmejian and McCarthy have gotten along
fairly well in the two years they have been in of
fice, but Brown and Curb had some memorable
clashes.
