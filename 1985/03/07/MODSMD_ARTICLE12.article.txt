## Here or home? Foreign student dilemma 
### CLAIRE MOREL-SEYTOUX 
As the plane rolls to a stop at the
gate of San Francisco International
Airport, the newly arrived Stanford
foreign student exits to make his way
through a fast-paced American soci
ety and unfamiliar campus life. He
plows through a rigorous study pro
gram, celebrates its eventual comple
tion, then comes full circle to the air
port once more to reboard that plane
and return home.
Or will he reboard?
For some of the 2,078 foreign stu
dents currently enrolled at Stanford,
the circle isn't complete, and the deci
sion to stay in the United States or to
return home is a taxing dilemma.
For Meilu Ho, a junior from
Malaysia, the decision is not clear
cut. "If I were 100 percent sure I
wanted to stay here," she said, "it
would be much easier."
A history major focusing on
Chinese studies, Ho said that an un
dergraduate degree in history won't
be too useful at home.
Having a possible interest in teach
ing, Ho fears her opportunities are
slim. "It would be difficult to go back
to teach Chinese history at home,"
she said. "As far as I know, there are
no extensive programs on China and
Chinese history at home. . . . You
can't get the resources at home. If I
stay at home, the horizons kind of
narrow."
Another student, an economics
major from Iran who has been living
in the United States for the past six
years , said he wanted to go home but
doubted he would. "I would like to go
back," he said, "on condition of what
happens at home. But none of my
skills and services would be useful
back home. . . . They might not be
appreciated there."
"The focus at home is to be very
non-Western," he continued, "and
anything Western won't be appreci
ated."
The large majority of foreign stu
dents, however, do return home, ac
cording to a report by the Institute of
International Education in New York
City. Some students never entertain
any doubts that they will return
home. Such is the case for Waheed
Hassan, a Ph.D. candidate from
Maldives. Hassan plans to return
home as soon as he completes his
degree in international development
education.
Hassan feels he has an obligation to
go home. "Every government in the
Third World wants its students to
return because highly educated
people are extremely scarce," he said.
"Students should return to their
countries, particularly if the student is
being sponsored by his government,
as a matter of principle," he said.
"Many of us who come from the
Third World come on scholarships
with provisions that we return home
after finishing our studies. Scholar
ships are very scarce, so if someone
uses it and doesn't return home, it's a
loss to the country."

Feisal Khan, a sophomore from
Pakistan, agrees."l think students
should go home,'" he said, "especially
those from Third World countries.
These countries have spent so much
money on us and given us virtually
everything we need, so I feel that we
owe a debt to our countries which
should be repaid by helping the
countries improve."
"I have no sympathy," he contin
ued, "for those that say there is no
opportunity at home and no room to
achieve at home. I think they are
using a rather shabby excuse."
Khan, a political science major,
said he definitely wants to go back to

Pakistan and plans to pursue a career
in civil service upon his return.
Other foreign students, however,
may have no choice in the matter of
staying or returning. Alejo Espinosa,
a second-year business student from
the Philippines, has a returning
residency requirement on his visa.
For the two years he spends at
Stanford, Espinosa will spend seven
years working for the Philippine gov
ernment. In exchange for this service
after graduation, the government
pays for all his tuition and living ex
penses.
With or without the contract,
however, Espinosa always intended

to return home. "I always had the in
tention of pursuing a career in public
service," he said. "There are so many
opportunities here, but I have my
priorities right now, and I'll stick to
my priorities."
Espinosa thinks he will be doing in
dustrial planning for the government
when he returns, promoting emerging
export-oriented industries.
Another foreign student, a Ph.D.
candidate from Tanzania, says the di
lemma is not whether students decide
to go home or stay. Rather, he con
siders the problem to be "when stu
dents can't go home as quickly as
they'd like."

"At the moment, I am dying to go
home," he said. "I'd really love to
go-"
Not the only one to miss home, his
yearning for home is shared by a
number of foreign students. Having
foreign friends is a help for some stu
dents. One student from Malaysia,
however, said she had found it diffi
cult to meet other undergraduate
foreign students. Her trouble is not
surprising, because, despite Stan
ford's large international population,
only 5 percent of undergraduate en
rollment is comprised of foreign
studnts. In graduate and post
doctoral programs, foreign students

comprise 23 and 35 percent of enroll
ment, respectively.
Social and cultural differences can
make the adjustment to campus life
especially hard. Even scrubbing pots
may take some getting used to for
foreign students. Khan had never ex
perienced dishpan hands before com
ing to Stanford. " Having to clean pots
was definitely a culture shock," he
said. Pointing to a three-foot-high
and six-foot-long stack of pots he'd
washed as a house job, he exclaimed,
"When you get done with that
mountain-sea of pots, your hands
look like prunes."
Another student, an undergraduate
from India, said she had particularly
noted the vast differences in dating
customs and the American habits of
large consumption and waste.
Yet another cultural difference a
foreign student pointed out was the
"amount of freedom given to women
by society. Women are free to do
what they want, be what they want,"
he said. "I knew that it wouldn't be
the same as at home, but the extent of
the difference was surprising."
Arrival on campus is the first ex
perience in the United States for
some foreign students. Such was the
case for Aviva Patel, a junior biology
major from India.
Asked if she had been nervous
about coming to a country so far from
home for the first time, Patel replied,
"A little. But my parents taught me
to be self reliant, so that helped me to
get used to this country."
The most difficult adjustment for
Patel was in the arena of human
relationships. "A lot of friendships
here have not been as deep and sin
cere as the ones I have at home," she
said. "My first quarter was especially
hard, but I really enjoy it (Stanford)
now."
Ho's freshman year was her first
experience living in the United States
as well. "I had watched TV and read
books (about America)," she said,
but it turned out to be "much more
difficult (to adjust) than I'd im
agined."
"People are a lot more indif
ferent," Ho said. "They don't know
anything at all about where you're
from and they're not going to bother,
generally."
"If you're American," she contin
ued, "it's your scene and it's easy to
go around and do your own thing and
not realize what's going on anywhere
else," she said.
A number of foreign students com
mented that Americans don't know
geography very well either. One stu
dent from Cameroon keeps a map on
hand with his home country colored
in to show Americans just where his
country is.
Another foreign student said he
sometimes receives more than
surprising questions about his
homeland, Pakistan. One girl once
queried, "Excuse me, do you live in
houses?"
