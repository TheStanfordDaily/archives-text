## The 						Stanford Daily End refund system 
### 
The ASSU Senate inade a good decision Tues
day night in voting to place on the spring ballot
Senator Mark Soble's bill to eliminate all cash
refunds on fee assesments. The current system of
refunds distorts the funding process and makes
the fee assessments unfair and inefficient.
When students vote for fee assesments in the
spring, they are essentially voting on whether
they think a group's budget is sound and well
deserved. If a majority of the student body ap
proves a group's fee assessment, it becomes a tax
on the students. The payment of taxes should not
be made optional by allowing refunds.
The function of these taxes is to pay for
services to the student body. Because a student
will likely gain the benefit of these services even
if the refund is taken, there is no reason, in most
cases, for students not to take their money back.
Many students mistakenly believe that if they
don't take advantage of a given group's services,
they are justified in taking back their money.
However, they fail to realize that the size of a
group's budget — and therefore the size of its fee
request — already reflects the fact that the group
may serve only a small portion of the student
body.
The current system forces a group to guess how
much will be taken from its budget, and then pad
its budget proposal to cover those expected

losses. Therefore, the students who don't get
refunds must pay an additional tax to cover those
who do. In some cases groups probably end up
with less than they need, and in other cases they
end up with more. Eliminating cash refunds is the
way to assure realistic budgets in the first place.
Soble's bill still includes a provision for people
to remove money from a group they object to on
moral grounds. However, the money removed
does not go into the pocket of the objector, but
would reduce the non-refundable surcharge
which covers the cost of elections and fee assess
ment administration the next year. This
eliminates most of the incentive for a person to
try for refunds unless he is seriously opposed to a
group.
The refund system today — with its no-vote,
no-refund clause — works to force students who
otherwise aren't interested in the ASSU to play
at least some role. But the factors that discourage
students from taking part in the student govern
ment system at Stanford should be addressed in a
more straightforward manner and are not cured
by the system of "bribing" the students to vote.
Certainly, some of us will miss our $15 or so in
refunds each quarter, but Soble's proposal, if ap
proved by students in spring, will leave us all bet
ter off in the long run.
