# Grueling grad years should pay off in bright career
## 
### 
Graduate students get very little respect at
Stanford. The professors think of us as cheap
hired help, which we are, and the undergradu
ates perceive us to be incredibly boring. This
is just further proof that former Dean of Ad
missions Fred Hargadon didn't accept many
fools. The sad truth is that monomaniacal
devotion to an obscure branch of learning
isn't the kind of thing that gets you invited to
appear on "Real People." Nevertheless,
graduate students make up the largest seg
ment of the student body and we deserve
more attention than we get.
The Daily doesn't even know we're alive.
The only time that they even mention that
there are graduate students at Stanford is
when someone needs one to serve on a com
mittee in the fascist student government.
They send a reporter out to deliver pizzas,
return punts, hash, row crew and the like, but
do they send one out to see how graduate stu
dents live? Of course they don't. Nobody
cares. This seems particularly irrational when
you consider that a huge majority of the un
dergraduates at Stanford will eventually go on
to grad school, whereas only a few hundred
history majors will ever end up delivering piz
zas for a living. And even the pizza deliverers
will probably have at least one advanced
degree.
So, have I piqued your curiosity? Have you
taken a sudden interest in those college
catalogs that have been mouldering next to
the commode since your last trip to the career

planning center? Dying to know where
graduate students go after dark? Of course
not. You're probably more interested in the
intramural Softball standings. But those of
you graduating seniors who foolishly ne
glected to learn a trade at Stanford — tennis,
golf or electrical engineering, for instance —
had better read on.
In a nutshell, graduate students do ad
vanced course work in their particular field of
study, and if they can pass the qualifying exam

(the equivalent of the Spanish Inquisition in
some departments, less pleasant in others),
they then do basic research under the direc
tion of one of the professors in their depart
ment. It's easy to tell what stage a graduate
student is currently going through. The ones
who are taking advanced courses stay up all
night studying and look like they're constantly
being whipped, the ones doing research look
much, much worse.
Most people, when they think of graduate
courses, imagine that they must be ultra
theoretical, mind-boggling and full of arcane

material, understandable only to the most
elite of four-eyed intellectual paper-shufflers.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
Graduate school is a place to delve deep
into the field that you love and want to spend
the rest of your life studying. In grad school
you can concentrate your whole intellectual
being into a narrow field and develop a thor
ough and complete understanding of the ma
terial. Far from being harder, graduate study
is actually much easier because all of your
studies are related and build toward a holistic
understanding of the subject matter.
Well, that's the theory. The fact of the mat
ter is that most graduate-level courses are
arcane, mind-boggling and easily understand
able by only a handful of individuals, most of
whom seem to come from Berkeley. Not that
the courses are not for everyone. Professors
are happy to see large classes full of eager
faces, figuring that that's what pays the
electric bills. In return for your kind support,
they are happy to give a "B" to anyone who
tries really hard. Trying hard generally involves
about 90 hours per week of intense study.
The students that the professor really wants
are the ones who don't have to study, the ones
who derive everything during the test because
they missed the class where the professor
mentioned that it was going to be an open
book exam. You probably know at least one
of these students; they already know the ma
terial but are going to class to get a different
perspective. They either sit in the front row

and ask probing questions or sit in the back
row and spend the whole period trying to
prove Fermat's last theorem. In either case,
they will severely depress you by calling you
the night before the final to get the quarter's
reading assignments.
Graduate students also run into the Grand
Old Men of their departments, the ones who
aren't allowed to teach undergraduates for
fear of turning them into political science
majors. These are the men who consider addi
tion to be a difficult concept, best learned by
the very young, and tensor calculus to be
mere technique. Meeting your first G.O.M.
can be unsettling, especially if he turns out to
be a 22-year-old woman.
Generally G.O.M. are much too busy to
take an interest in anything but their current
research and three or four doctoral candi
dates. This is good in that having a G.O.M.
take an interest in your dissertation can add
three or four enjoyable years to your stay at
Stanford, and bad in that working for a
G.O.M. is a sure ticket to the highest halls of
academe.
The one thing that you don't want to do is
annoy a G.0.M., something that I'm
desperately trying to avoid even as I write.
Annoying a G.O.M. can result in having to
field oral exam questions like, "So, starting
with the second law of thermodynamics,
derive an expression describing the planet
Neptune in its current configuration and its
configuration 3 billion years ago." They won't

be bluffing, either; if you had read the
definitive text they wrote 20 years ago, now in
a Dover reprint, you would be able to answer
the question. You'd also be in an exclusive
club with six other people, three of whom are
now deceased.
So why, you ask, should I bust my ass for 10
to 15 years, when Domino's is hiring right
now? Go look in the faculty parking lot. All of
those Volvos and BMWs didn't materialize
during a mass hallucination experiment over
in the Psychology Department. Not only do
University professors get to live and work at a
country club, they get paid a lot to do it. Of
course it's not Stanford that's paying them.
One of my undergraduate professors
cleverly wrote the most popular engineering
textbook of all time and now vacations at his
chalet in Switzerland. Some of my current
professors are in great demand as consultants
and get to charge all the market will bear.
Many of the modern inventions that you cal
low youths take for granted — napalm, for in
stance — were invented on college campuses;
and universities, unlike corporations, let the
inventors keep the royalties.
So give a thought to the career that lies at
the end of all those grueling years. I mean
sure, you can make $6 or $7 an hour deliver
ing pizza right now, but an academic career
will last a lifetime.
