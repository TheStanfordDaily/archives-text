Just the opposite
The story "GSL cuts may help
push public service" (The Daily,
March 4) begins by stating:
The proposed Guaranteed Student
Loan (GSL) cuts may have some
positive impact on the Stanford Law
School, according to its dean, John
Ely.
Rather than rely on GSLs, Ely is
encouraging students to take part in
recently developed low-interest loan
programs which charge below-market
rates to students taking summer or
post-graduate jobs in public-interest
or charity-law work.
While I'm sure this was written in all
good faith, I'm afraid it doesn't quite
make sense.

In fact I did not — in my interview
with the story's author (or for that
matter, anywhere else) — suggest
any sort of connection between the
GSL cuts and the law school's
"public interest" loan forgiveness
and summer loan programs. The
post-graduate public service loan
forgiveness program would excuse,
gradually, a large part of a graduate's
educational loans, including GSL.
The summer public interest loan
program makes loans that are
modest compared to what the stu
dent could earn working at a law
firm for the summer. Thus, the over
all effect of GSL cuts would be ex
actly the opposite of that suggested
in the article: In fact, they are likely
to incline students away from

capitalizing on the school's public
interest initiatives.
That I think the proposed GSL
cuts would have an unambiguously
negative impact on Stanford Law
School and its students is, of course,
the reason I have taken the lead in
suggesting that students let the presi
dent and their representatives know
how seriously these cuts would affect
them (The Daily, Feb. 22).

Nicaragua petition
The following is a petition submit
ted to The Daily by the members of
the Faculty Committee on Nicaragua
and was signed by 200 members of

the Stanford faculty:
Historically, the United States has
stood for ideals of rule of law, inter
national peace and respect for
human rights throughout the world.
We, the undersigned faculty and
administrators of Stanford Univer
sity, wish to register grave concern
about the move away from those
ideals in U.S. policy toward
Nicaragua. In particular, we call
attention to the decision to withdraw
from proceedings initiated by
Nicaragua in the International Court
of Justice, the termination of
dialogue with the government of
Nicaragua, and the support of groups
seeking to destabilize and overthrow
that government.
For more than three decades, the

United States has encouraged the
use of the International Court as a
means for the peaceful resolution of
international conflict. The unprece
dented decision to boycott proceed
ings of that tribunal is cause for
alarm for those of us who advocate
diplomatic and juridical solutions to
conflict and adherence to established
laws.
As Congress debates aid to the
contras, it is especially important
to raise these concerns now. The
great toll in innocent life, and the
misery caused by acts of economic
sabotage, emphasize the moral im
perative that this policy not proceed
unexamined.
The government of Nicaragua has
expressed willingness to engage in

negotiations and to sign the Con
tadora peace treaty. We urge that
the United States return to a moral
and legal policy that pursues
diplomatic solutions and respects the
rule of law.
Specifically, we urge our govern
ment to:
• Recognize the jurisdiction of the
International Court in its pending
litigation;
• Withdraw all direct and indirect
support for the contras and for
any action which aims to destablilize
or overthrow the government of
Nicaragua;
• Pursue diplomatic and peaceful
means of resolving conflicts with
Nicaragua, and honor and support
the Contadora process.
