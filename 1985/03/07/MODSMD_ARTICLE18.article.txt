## Concert Network job isn't education 
### 
We feel it is necessary to clear up "the percep
tion that some people within the University have
that the Grateful Dead attract an unwanted ele
ment" (The Daily, Feb. 28). It is interesting that in
the very same issue of The Daily, there is an article
that describes the Dead in a more positive and real-

istic way. Now we're not saying that anyone who
doesn't appreciate the Dead is musically ignorant.
On the contrary, we realize that musical preference
is just that: preference.
We feel, therefore, it is not the type of music the
Dead play that is the issue. It seems to he the Con
cert Network leaders' and probably the Univer
sity's basic mispcrception of what they deem the
"unwanted element," i.e., hippies. What is it that
causes people to automatically associate long hair
and tie-dye with the unwanted, unintelligent, un
washed, etc.? Are they (the hippies) excessively vi
olent, uncouth or just plain disobedient?
If the only proof available to Derek Passarelli,
head of the Concert Network's Advisory Board,
that the people who choose to attend Grateful
Dead concerts are lawless is the "more than a
dozen arrests, damage to University facilities and
traffic congestion in Palo Alto." we feel it is only
fair to bring up the rather large, congestive and
(dare we say it) destructive crowds that the Univer
sity has invited to Stanford in the past. There can
be no reasonable rationale for why the crowd the
Dead attracts, which is by all accounts fairly
subdued, is singled out for creating the above prob
lems.
So, we're back at the misperception problem. A
"responsible" concert is not hard to put on, if

you're professional about it. Furthermore, a re
sponsible Concert Network would put on concerts
that the students want to attend (or just any
concerts).
That brings us to our next point â€” the role of the
Concert Network as a student-funded organization.
Is not the idea of the network somewhat like what
runs the ASSU or KZSU? The network should
provide experience and knowledge to students who
wish to be involved in concert promotion. Such an
educational project is perfectly reasonable, as it
helps students become more professional in their

long hair with the un

field of interest, in a supportive environment' As a
fledgling concert promoter, shouldn't the network
want to be businesslike? After all, no real-life
promoter wants to put on a concert where nobody
comes.
In previous years, the network has had problems
with less-than-adequate ticket sales, resulting in the
cancellation of several concerts. Obviously, the
current administration is not responsible for that,
but such occurrences should be learning experi
ences for subsequent network leaders.
As a student-funded organization, the network
should also consider the tastes and preferences of
the student body when deciding which groups to
consider for the allegedly upcoming Frost Amphit
heatre shows. We noted before that musical prefer

ence is purely subjective, especially when one is
discussing popular music. It is really pretentious,
therefore, of Passarelli to suggest that he is better
educating the students by giving a possible Dead
concert to another group.
The network does not perform the same function
as the Lively Arts; its members cannot pretend to
know which groups are musically "better," only
that certain groups tend to draw larger audiences,
which would seem to indicate popular support. If
there is agreement that the Dead would be a good
show to pursue, perhaps these aspects of popular
support and misperceptions should be brought
forth to the University by the network, as represen
tatives of the student body.
As co-presidents of the Stanford Dead Heads, a
newly formed student organization, we feel that
bringing the Dead back to Frost could only be a
positive experience for all involved. Our roster lists
more than 100 registered students, with many more
fans on campus not involved with our club.
We believe that the whole issue of campus con
certs is overblown and that the students themselves
hardly know what is being done with their fee
assessment dollars. If the University or the network
feels that the "unwanted element" is coming from
outside the campus, perhaps they could sell
restricted tickets to ID-carrying people (from any
college) before opening sales to the public.
However, if it is long hair and tie-dye they wish to
avoid, they'd be surprised to find out how many
"respectable" Stanford students harbor one or two
tie-dyed shirts in their dressers.
