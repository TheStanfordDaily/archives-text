## No. 1 Cardinal swims into Pac-10s 
### INGRID SEYER Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford men's swimming
team will be looking to win the Pacific
10 Conference Championships this
weekend, but the ulitimate goal re
quires more individual victories than
a solitary team win.
"We will be trying our hardest to
win the Pac-10 Championships, and I
think we can do that," Stanford
Coach Skip Kenney said, "but our
primary goal is to make all of our
NCAA qualifying standards."
Kenney is referring to the cut-off

times that each swimmer must meet
before he can compete in the NCAA
Championships March 28-30.
So far, eight Stanford swimmers
have qualified in a total of 11 individ
ual events and one relay. According
to Kenney, only three swimmers have
qualified in all of their events: Pablo
Morales, Jeff Kostoff and Dave Bot
tom. The other swimmers will be
working to make the cut-off times in
the events they have not yet qualified
for.
"We're taking 18 swimmers to the
NCAAs, and all but four of them have

to have qualified in order to com
pete," Kenney said. "Consequently,
the pressure to meet the cut-off times
will be very intense this weekend."
Stanford, 7-0 in dual meets and
ranked No. 1 nationally, has won the
Pac-10 title for three consecutive
years and, according to Kenney, has a
very strong chance of taking home
the title once again.
"I don't feel anyone can beat us,
unless we lose points because of a dis
qualification," Kenney said. "That is
not to say that we won't be having
some very stiff competition. To say
the least, the Pac-10 is most assuredly
the toughest conference in the nation.
Six of the nation's top 10 teams are
competing this weekend, including
California, USC, Arizona State and
Arizona."
Returning Pac-10 Champions from
Stanford are Dave Bottom (100
backstroke), John Moffet (200
breaststroke), Pablo Morales (100
butterfly) and Jeff Kostoff (400 indi
vidual medley).
All of these swimmers are expected
to score well for Stanford once again,
and Kenney is expecting help from
some of his talented freshmen,
namely Anthony Mosse, Sean
Murphy and Matt Nance.
The Cardinal should dominate all
of the stroke events, with Morales
and Mosse in the butterfly events,
Murphy and Bottom in the back
stroke events and Moffet in the
breaststroke.
In ; the freestyle events, Stanford
wilHbe swimming in some much
closer and competitive races. Kostoff,
Stanford's top distance swimmer, will
be competing in what Kenney
referred to as "the big events" of the
Pac-lOs, the 500 and 1,650
freestyles.
Kostoff will be facing former
Olympians John Mykkanen, Mike
O'Brien and George DiCarlo.
DiCarlo won a gold medal in the

400-meter freestyle this summer, and
Mykkanen captured the silver in the
same event. O'Brien was a gold
medalist in the 1,500-meter freestyle.
"Every finalist in the 100- and
1,650-yard freestyles in this year's
NCAAs could be from the Pac-10,
without a doubt," Kenney said.
Stanford will certainly be looking
for individual NCAA qualifiers, but
will also be attempting to qualify its
400 and 800 freestyle relays.
The 400 medley relay team of Bot
tom, Moffet, Morales and Dave
Louden, which currently holds the
nation's best time in the event and
has already qualified for the NCAAs,
should win it this weekend.
"Hopefully we can win the medley
relay in a sort of practice run for the

NCAAs," Kenney said.
Although much of this weekend's
competition will be a sort of "practice
run" for the NCAAs, many of the
swimmers' times will not be totally in
dicative of their eventual times in the
NCAAs.
"Many people fail to realize that a
lot of these top-notch swimmers will
be swimming unshaved this weekend
and therefore will not place as well as
they will when they shave for the
championships," Kenney said.
"Many times swimmers who don't
even make the finals in their confer
ence go on to win their events in the
NCAAs after they shave down," he
said. "All of our swimmers who have
not yet qualified in all of their events
will shave down for their races. If all

gees well, we will make all of our cut
off times and win the Pac-10 title at
the same time."
The Pac-10 diving competition that
took place earlier this week in Los
Angeles put Stanford in third place
entering the meet with 66 points, fol
lowing Arizona with 90 and UCLA
with 67.
UCLA's Doug Shaffer won the 1-
and 3-meter competitions with scores
of 520.10 and 582.65, respectively,
followed in both events by Stanford's
Thor Johnson and Tom Rothen
bucher.
Johnson scored a 458.75 in the 1-
meter and a 496.30 in the 3-meter,
and Rothenbucher scored 447.55 in
the 1-meter and 490.07 in the 3-
meter.
