## Card after 3rd at Sac State 
### KEN STEVENS Staff sportswriter 
Though several of its strongest western counter
parts will not be competing, the Stanford men's golf
team will have plenty to shoot for as it attempts to
capture the Sacramento State Invitational for the
third consecutive year today and tomorrow at
Rancho Murieta.
According to Coach Tim Schaaf, the Cardinal
men are attempting to solidify their games as the
demanding spring season approaches. "We need to
start getting sharp," Schaaf said. "With some of the
weather, the winter schedule has not worked as we
would have liked it to."
Despite the bad weather, the Cardinal has con
sistently finished among the leaders in most tourna
ments this season and will in all probability receive
a berth in the NCAA championships this May.
"Our team right now is in real good shape as far

as NCAAs," Schaaf said, noting that Stanford was
recently ranked second in a poll of the top college
teams on the West Coast. The top six West Coast
teams at the end of the season will compete at the
NCAA Championships.
The Cardinal will be challenged by two very dif
ficult courses at Rancho Murieta. "They are two of
the best courses we play on all year," Schaaf said,
adding that they should help prepare the Cardinal
for the more difficult tournaments ahead.
While Stanford's top competition in the west —
Arizona State and UCLA — will not be at Rancho
Murieta, a much-improved San Jose State team
will. The Spartans recently finished ahead of the
Cardinal at the John Burns Invitational in Hawaii.
In action for the Cardinal the next two days will
be seniors Scott Erickson, Tim Robinson and Doug
Thompson, junior Carl Wagner and sophomore
Rich Marik.

Robinson, who captured individual honors at the
John Burns Invitational, is looking to add another
strong tournament to his credentials in his attempt
to gain All-American honors again.
"He's playing in a very high group," Schaaf said.
"He's such a consistent player."
Thompson is "likewise in contention for Ail-
American honors," according to Schaaf. Thompson
started on a sizzling pace this season, placing
second, fourth and eighth in his first three tourna
ments. He will be looking to rebound, however,
from a below-average performance at the John
Burns Invitational.
After winning the Silverado Invitational Feb. 15
while playing for the second five, Marik has edged
his way back on to the top five for today's tourna
ment. He qualified ahead of junior Don
Walsworth, who had been on the traveling squad.
