# Top-ranked Waves sink Stanford spikers
## 
### ROB GRAHAM Staff sportswriter 
The Waves crashed in Maples Pavilion last
night, right on the Stanford men's volleyball
team's head. Pepperdine, the country's No. 1
team, drowned the Cardinal in four sets, 12-
15, 15-12, 15-10, 15-9.
Stanford was able to catch the Waves early,
though, and rode them for a little while.
"They played that first set with unbelievable
intensity," Pepperdine Coach Marv Dunphy
said of the Cardinal.
Stanford surged to a 9-1 lead in the first set
before the Waves could even warm up. After
that initial shock, however, Pepperdine
steadied and showed why it's considered by
many to be the team to beat this year. The
Waves went on a 10-2 tear to take the lead at
12-11.
But the Cardinal, a squad described by
Dunphy as "the best Stanford team I've ever
seen," kept its balance. "A lesser team might
have folded right then," Stanford Co-coach
Don Shaw said."But we came back and
showed them that we're for real."
Down 12-11, the Cardinal regrouped and
reeled off four unanswered points to take the
first set. Sophomore John McDermott's kill
iced it.
From then on, though, the Waves were too
high. Although the Cardinal had a chance in
each of the next three sets, Pepperdine
repeatedly rose to the occasion at the critical
moments. "They played their best when their
best was needed," Shaw said.
Even in defeat the Cardinal showed what
it's made of. "We didn't ever lack for effort,"
Shaw said. Time and again the men came
from behind when it appeared they were
finished.
Down 0-5 in the third set, Stanford rushed
back to tie it at 10. A Pepperdine run of five
points, however, staked the Waves to a com
manding two sets to one lead.

Again in the fourth set, the men could have
called it quits after falling behind. After trail
ing 6-2 and 9-6, Stanford narrowed the gap to
one at 10-9 before surrendering another five
point streak. The Cardinal fell off its wave for
the last time with that run, losing the fourth
set and the match in the process.
Both Shaw and Dunphy saw blocking as the
key to the contest. "The difference between
them and us was hitting errors — we had 22
and they only had 10," Shaw said. "That
means that they had better organized block
ing.
"You just didn't see many balls going
through their blocking."
Dunphy concurred, "We did a simply out
standing job blocking."
Dunphy also took some credit for the vic
tory. "We made some key adjustments; and
those were the best adjustments we made this
season. We mixed it up tactically in various
parts of the game," he said.
Shaw felt, too, that Pepperdine played a
nice, tight match. "To beat Pepperdine,
you've got to put out a consistent effort
throughout. You've got to sustain the effort.
"We didn't have a problem with that, but they
did execute better than we did tonight."
Shaw had earlier said that when two teams
that have relatively simple offenses like Stan
ford and Pepperdine meet, execution can de
termine the final outcome.
Stanford was paced by junior Chris Braun's
16 kills and .245 hitting percentage. McDer
mott (12 and .163), freshman Scott Fortune
(11 and .222) and Ail-American Jon Root
(10 and .087) also contributed.
Pepperdine's Matt Rigg led all hitters on
the night with 18 kills (.381) Bob Ctvrtlik
added 17 kills (.302), Mark Arnold 13 (.407)
and Mike Fitzgerald 11 (.409).
For the evening, the Waves posted a .324
team hitting percentage, compared to the
Cardinal's .177.

Shaw was nonetheless pleased with his
team's performance. "We played well and
they had to work to beat us. In that respect
I'm satisfied," he said. "It wasn't easy for
them, as some people expected; we made
them earn everything they got."
In fact, Shaw saw reason for optimism in
the loss to the country's top team. "It was a
good measuring stick for us. It tells us just
where we stand in relation to the big teams. I
think we have room for plenty of improve
ment, and some of the other top teams can't
get any better.
"We learned tonight that we're capable of
playing with anyone. But we still have to get
better in certain little phases of the game, like
blocking and ball control," he said.
With the league setback, Stanford fell to 6-
4 in the California Intercollegiate Volleyball
Association and into a tie with UC-Santa Bar
bara, 5-3, for fourth place in the CIVA. The
Cardinal now stands at 18-5 overall.
For their part, the Waves solidified their
hold on the league lead. With a 7-0 mark,
they stand a half game above UCLA. Pep
perdine is 11-2 against all competition.
The Pepperdine bunch was, like Stanford,
very satisfied. "It was a great road win," said
sophomore setter Troy Tanner. "We were
able to concentrate and the crowd didn't
bother us a bit. In fact, I sort of like screaming
crowds — for me or against me."
As if on cue, Dunphy also commented on
the crowd — likely the biggest to attend a
men's volleyball match this year. "A good
performer likes a crowd; they like to show
people what they've got."
Sadly for the Cardinal, the Pepperdine
players were as well coached in volleyball
skills as they appeared to be in their speech.
In any case, Stanford will have another
chance to test the Waves' waters next month
when it visits Malibu as part of an extended
road trip.

Pavilion.
