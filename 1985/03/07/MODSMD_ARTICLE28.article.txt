# Pac-10 hoop season closes this weekend
## Card battles WSU for cellar 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
The Stanford men's basketball
team won't be playing spoiler when it
hosts Washington State tonight at
7:30 in Maples Pavilion. Instead of
trying to knock a team out of first
place, it will be trying to knock one
into last.
Stanford and Washington State
were headed on a collision course for
a cellar showdown until the Cougars
screwed things up by beating Arizona
State last Saturday. The victory gave
Washington State, 12-14 overall, four
conference wins and gave Stanford,
11-15 overall and 3-13 in the Pac-10,
sole possession of last place with two
games left.
Now the Cardinal must win at least
one and probably both its remaining
games if it hopes to avoid a "10th"
next to it in the final standings. If
Stanford sweeps the Washington
schools and Washington defeats Cali
fornia tonight, then Cal and Washing
ton State will battle it out for cellar
dweller honors Saturday night.
Winning simply to stay out of the
Pac-10 basement, however, is not
Stanford's motivation this weekend,
at least not according to junior for
ward Earl Koberlein and his coach,
Tom Davis.
"You always want to win, but I
can't see much difference between
ninth and 10th place," Koberlein said
Monday. "We just want to go out and
win these games for the sake of win
ning."
Davis agreed. "How you finish
leaves a taste in your mouth all
spring, summer and fall," he said. "If
you win, the players will have a good
feeling all off-season long. So I think
it will be important to the team to
finish with two good efforts for that
reason."
And it's this talk of the importance
of a grand finale that prompted As
soc. Head Coach Bruce Pearl to make
a plea to Stanford fans yesterday.
"All season long, we haven't
promoted ourselves because we
haven't been able to promise any
thing," he said. "But this is the last
weekend of the 1984-85 basketball
season.
"If we beat Washington State
Thursday night and then Washington
on Saturday, that will be the only
thing that this team and our fans will
remember. And so for the first time
all year, I'd like to personally ask
them (the fans) to come to the games
and remember the team in that way."
Pearl pointed out that the Cardinal
was in a similar situation two years
ago, in Davis' first season at Stanford.
The Cardinal finished the season with
victories over Oregon and Oregon
State, the latter of which knocked the
Beavers out of the NCAA post
season tournament.
"The support that we received on
that day had as much to do with our

beating Oregon State as anything,"
Pearl said. "And all the ingredients
are there for another tremendous
weekend like that one."
One thing Stanford will have in its
favor tonight will be its home court,
where it is 9-5 and has recorded two
of its three Pac-10 victories. The first
time the teams met, Jan. 5 in Pull
man, Wash., Stanford actually led 55-
50 in the second half, only to be out
scored 21-4 in the final 10 minutes
and lose, 71-59.
But that was 14 games ago, and
since then the Cardinal has im
proved. "We know we're improved,"
Koberlein said, "and that's exciting to
see even though we don't have the
wins to show for it."
After winning their first two Pac
-10 games, the Cougars fell into deep

sleep, waking up only for home vic
tories over UCLA last month and
Arizona State last weekend. None
theless, they are 0-7 in Pac-10 road
games, losing by an average of 12
points per game.
Washington State does have one of
the Pac-10's leading scorers in sopho
more forward Joe Wallace, who is
averaging 18.2 points per game. Two
other Cougars— Keith Morrison and
Otis Jennings— are scoring in double
figures, and Morrison, a guard,
averages a team-high 7.1 rebounds an
outing.
"Their problems have been the
same as ours," Davis said of the
Cougars. "They've got some good
personnel, but they don't have a
whole lot of experience and that's
hurting them."
