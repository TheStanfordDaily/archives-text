# Five-team race for title
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
It used to be so cut and dried in the
Pacific 10 Conference when it came
to men's basketball. UCLA would
win, and all comers would battle it
out for second place.
Then Oregon State realized that
it's much easier to become good at
basketball than football — you only
have to sell five good players on the
rain instead of 22. And the Beavers
challenged for — and won — the Pac
-10 basketball title as the UCLA
dynasty began to crumble.
Now, in 1985, UCLA and Oregon
State are still at the top of the Pac-10.
But as the league winds down to its
final weekend, so are three other
teams.
USC, Washington and Arizona
join the two mainstays in a bunch of
five teams all within two games of the
lead with as many games to play.
USC is the leader with a 12-4 Pac-10
record. Washington and Oregon
State are a game back in second at
11-5. Arizona is alone in fourth at
11-6, one-and-a-half games back.
And UCLA is in fifth at 10-6, a full
two games off the pace.
In most other conferences across
the nation, a five-team race with two
games left isn't that big a deal, at least
not as far as NCAA Tournament in
vitations are concerned. In all
likelihood, no less than five teams
from the Big East, Atlantic Coast and
Big Ten Conferences will receive
invites to the NCAA's postseason
party.
Lest we forget, this is the Pac-10.
The Pac-10 might have arguably
the best football conference in the
land, but basketball recently hasn't
been up to snuff. Two teams — co
champions Oregon State and Wash

ington — went last year. Because this
year's selections are based on a
league's performance in last year's
tournament, two and maybe three
teams will be included in this year's
expanded 64-team format. Maybe
three.
And because the Pac-10 is one of
the few leagues without a conference
tournament, that makes the final
standings even more important. The
Pac-10 champion gets an automatic
berth in the NCAAs. The rest of the
teams sit by the phone on selection
day — and pray.
All of which brings us back to the
season's final weekend.
Only three teams — USC, Oregon

End of regular season

State and Washington — can win the
title outright, while the best Arizona
and UCLA can hope for is a tie at the
top. USC and Oregon State control
their own destiny. Washington will
need a little help, and Arizona and
UCLA will need a great deal to take
home the championship.
However, there is a possibility —
not a longshot, either — that every
one can finish at 12-6 and create a
five-way logjam in first. In that case,
the Pac-10's tiebreakers would take
effect to designate the conference's
representative in the NCAAs.
The first tiebreaker is the head-to
head conference games between the
teams that are tied. After that, it goes
to the teams' overall record in games
played in the continental United
States — teams are allowed to play up
to three extra games in Alaska or
Hawaii.
The third tiebreaker favors the
team which has least recently com
peted in the NCAA tournament.
Washington and Oregon State com
peted last year, UCLA in 1983, USC
in 1982 and Arizona in 1977.
The fourth and final tiebreaker, if it
comes to that, is a majority vote of
the Pac-10 athletic directors.
Obviously, with a 12-4 record and
both remaining games at home, USC
has the inside track to the title. A vic
tory tonight over Oregon, 15-14
overall and 8-8 in the Pac-10, would
assure the Trojans at worst a tie, no
matter what happens in Saturday's
showdown against Oregon State.
"Any other year, you might give
Southern California the edge because
they finish at home," Oregon State
Coach Ralph Miller said. "But the
way things have gone this year,
nobody in their right mind would pick
a favorite."
