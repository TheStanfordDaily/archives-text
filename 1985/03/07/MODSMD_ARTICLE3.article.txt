# Dead concert possible
## Concert Network continues negotiations 
### DAVIDS. GOLDSTEIN Staff writer 
An ASSU senator says the Stanford Concert Network is
negotiating with Bill Graham Presents, the Bay Area's
leading concert-promotion company, to bring the Grate
ful Dead here this spring.
And Joel Bellenson, social action chairman at Stanford
Hillel, said yesterday the Concert Network and other stu
dent groups have entered into discussions with Bill
Graham Presents to bring another big-name act for a sep
arate concert to benefit East African famine victims.
Bellenson declined to name which performers may play
for fear of jeopardizing negotiations, but said, "These are
significant acts that are capable of filling Frost or the
stadium."
According to ASSU Senator Jon Adelstein, co-chair of
the senate Student Affairs Commitee, "The Concert Net
work is making significant efforts to bring the Dead here.
"I'm real excited," Adelstein said. "It looks like there is
nothing in the way of having the Dead here this spring."
Contrary to earlier reports that the Grateful Dead
would not play here this year, Aaron Persky, director of
Concert Network, said last night. "We never ruled out to
tally the Dead, although we felt that it might not be a good
first show" for the network, which was approved for a
three-year fee assessment in last spring's elections.
Derek Passarelli, chairman of the Concert Network
Advisory Board, would not confirm that the network is in
terested specifically in the Grateful Dead, but said, "We
are pursuing big-name acts, including the Dead."
Bill Graham, Northern California's leading concert
promoter, could not be reached for comment, but told
The Daily last week he "personally guarantees" the

Grateful Dead would play here if the Concert Network
and the University administration approved.
On Monday, the Student Affairs Committee unani
mously approved a resolution authored by Adelstein call
ing for the Grateful Dead to play here. Adelstein said the
proposal originally read, "The senate urges the Concert
Network to invite the Grateful Dead to Frost this spring,"
but was changed to read, "The senate supports efforts by
the Concert Network to bring the Grateful Dead to Frost
this spring" when the committee learned that negotiations
were already underway.
Adelstein intended to present the bill to the senate, but
decided to send the approved resolution directly to Con
cert Network instead, he said.
University President Donald Kennedy said at an ASSU
Senate meeting Tuesday that he is not "anti-Dead" and
would not oppose a concert by the Grateful Dead or any
other group selected by the Concert Network to perform
here.
Assistant to the President Bob Hamrdla confirmed that
Kennedy would not stand in the way of the Concert Net
work if it chooses to sign the Grateful Dead.
Kennedy "rather liked some of their music," Hamrdla
said.
Bellenson said the concert's purpose is "to raise funds
for East Africa relief for hunger," and to raise awareness
about the hunger problem in this country and abroad.
Bellenson said Graham has offered the services of his
office free of charge, and is "morally dedicated to this
cause."
He said he has yet to hear from several performers' rep-
