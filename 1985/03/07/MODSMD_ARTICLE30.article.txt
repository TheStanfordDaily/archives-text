# USC reaps league honors
## 
### 
USC collected the Pacific 10 Conference's top two bas
ketball honors yesterday, as Coach Stan Morrison was
named Coach of the Year and senior forward Wayne
Carlander Player of the Year. I
Morrison, 45, has guided USC from an eighth-place
finish last year to the top of the Pac-10 standings with two
home games left in the regular season. The Trojans are
12-4 in conferencc play, one game ahead of Washington
and Oregon State, and 18-8 overall.
"If there were a way to cut up the trophy into 23 parts, I
know 19 players and four assistant coaches who deserve a
piece of the action," Morrison said. "Anything I receive is
a part of their efforts."
Morrison is generally well-liked by coaches around the
league, according to Stanford Assoc. Head Coach Bruce
Pearl. "Stan is as fine as person as there is in this busi
ness," Pearl said.
The Trojans could assure themselves at least a tie for
the Pac-10 title with a victory over Oregon tonight.
Carlander, a 6-foot-8, 220-pound senior from Long
Beach, played a key role in the Trojans' success this
season, leading the team in scoring with a 16.3 points-per
game average and standing second in rebounding .

"I didn't really think about it, but it's quite an honor to
receive that kind of recognition from the coaches of the
Pac-10," Carlander said. "It's a team award because of
how well we've done this year. It surely is one of the high
lights of my career."
Although few questioned the choice of Morrison,
Carlander was the object of some controversy. Oregon
State Coach Ralph Miller has been saying all season that
he feels Beaver senior A.C. Green deserved to repeat as
Player of {he Year.
Green won the award as a junior last year and many felt
he should have won it again, especially after leading the
league in both scoring and rebounding this season.
Pearl, however, defended the choice of Carlander. "At
the time of the voting, USC was in first place," he said.
"Last year, they finished eighth, so there's got to be a rea
son for the turnaround. Wayne Carlander is USC's most
valuable player and therefore he becomes the league's
MVP.
"He's not necessarily the No. 1 pro prospect in the
league," Pearl continued, "but that doesn't mean he
didn't mean more to USC's team than anyone else meant
to their team."
