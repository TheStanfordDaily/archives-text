# Stanford hockey becoming competitive
## 
### JENNIFER KOCH Staff sportswriter 
Only one home game remains for
the Stanford hockey team. That
game, scheduled primarily to keep
the team in shape for the MIT Tourn
ament in Boston over spring break, is
against California Sunday at 8 p.m. at
Belmont Iceland.
Coming off an 8-4 record in the
fall, Stanford finished third in the
Pacific Intercolligiate Hockey Con
ference after the regular season. The
team took fourth place in the confer
ence after the playoffs last weekend
at Arizona.
This is a new league for Stanford,
which has played fewer competitive
teams in the past. Included are teams
like USC and Arizona, which recruit
and practice five times a week.
Arizona's rink is in an 8,000-seat
facility which is filled at $4 a person.
Although Stanford cannot compete
with the popularity and financial sup
port of a school like Arizona, the
team has evolved into what team cap
tain Bob Mulroy calls a "fantastic
club."
With an hour-and-a-half practice
costing the team $200, the Cardinal
can seldom afford more than one
practice a week. Although the team
does not practice frequently, the
workouts are strenuous.
Held late Sunday or Tuesday
nights, they begin with general condi
tioning and skating drills. The skaters
also practice specific fundamental
drills such as checking. The last part
of practice usually consists of

scrimmages and sprints.
Team practice seems expensive,
but a Saturday afternoon game costs
approximately $500, placing quite a
strain on the club sports budget. •
The lack of funds is definitely a
limiting factor in the team's success,
yet team members do not appear to
mind their club sport status or that
they do not hold practice every day.
Mulroy calls the atmosphere of the
team "casual," while goalie Bill
Levine says that "the attitude of the
team is laid-back."

Graduate student and captain Scott
Tilley claims that he "enjoys playing
the game, but the first priority here is
the academics."
Mulroy, who played hockey for a
powerhouse high school on the East
Coast, came to Stanford for academic
reasons. He said that he was

"overjoyed and a bit surprised" to
find a hockey program at Stanford,
and was especially glad that it is not
overly time-consuming.
The traveling hockey team, cap
tained bv Mulroy, Tilley and Gary
Rothchiid and coached by Pat
Baldwin, plays approximately 27

games during the season. There is
also a recreational team which plays
about 10 games against local schools.
Mulroy calls Stanford's hockey
team "a great bunch of guys." He
says the team is playing better this
year and is also playing better compe
tition. Seven new freshmen have con
tributed to the team's success. Espe
cially notable is freshmen center Tim
Westergren, who gained most of his
hockey experience in Europe.
Other exceptional players include
senior John Zierk who has missed

several games due to knee problems
but has made numerous comeback at
tempts, and Stanford lecturer David
Lougee, head of the technical com
munication program, who has played
on the team for more than a dozen
years.
Because hockey at Stanford is not a
varsity sport, it is not limited to un
dergraduates. As a result, there is an
equal mix of graduate students on the
team, many from Canada, the Mid
west and the East, where hockey is
more popular than in California.
Tilley, for example, played hockey
in Princeton's program as an under
graduate. He claims club sports are "a
good way to have fun with your
friends," and feels that the program
at Stanford is probably comparable to
a junior varsity team at a Division I
hockey school.
Levine played hockey in North
Dakota from the fourth grade. He
said that in winter there are not many
chances to participate in other sports
and that "almost everybody grows up
playing hockey."
Judging by the casual atmosphere
of the team members, ice hockey at
Stanford will continue to be a suc
cessful club sports team, but will not
become a varsity sport in the near
future.
As Mulroy says, "That is not the
attitude of the team nor the way the
program is geared. We're becoming
more competitive and it may happen
someday, but right now we're happy
where we are."
