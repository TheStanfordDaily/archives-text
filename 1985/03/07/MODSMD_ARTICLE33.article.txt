## 'Blood Simple' mired in overstated special effects 
### STEVE VINEBERG Editorial staff 
"Blood Simple," a first-time-out
feature by Joel and Ethan Coen (they
collaborated on the script; Ethan
produced and Joel directed), derives
its film noir plot from James Cain's
novels and its black comic tone from
Hitchcock's "The Trouble with
Harry." Abby (Frances McDormand)
leaves her husbands, Marty (Dan
Hedaya), a barkeeper, to shack up
with one of his employees, Ray (John
Getz). In revenge, Marty hires a
private detective (M. Emmet Walsh)
to kill the lovers, but the gumshoe,
for reasons the film never examines,
chooses instead to alter photographs
of the sleeping couple so that it looks
like he's shot them, then collect his
fee and murder Marty instead — with
the gun he pilfered from Abby's
purse. When Ray breaks into Marty's
office to collect his back pay, he sees
the corpse and the gun, assumes
Abby is the guilty party, and proceeds
to cover up for her by mopping up the
blood, confiscating the gun, and
removing the body to bury it outside
of town. But the detective botched
the job: Marty isn't dead yet, so it is
incumbent on Ray to finish him off.
"Blood Simple" has been hailed
nationally as the debut of an auda
cious new pair of talents, and it's cer
tainly a confident film — even a
cocky one. Joel Coen and the photog
rapher, Barry Sonnenfeld, get some
wild, abstract effects: a gnarled rain
bow reflected on the windshield
during a drive through a Texas
rainstorm, light smoking suddenly
through bullet holes in a wall, a news
paper hurled through the air with
such inappropriate force that it
smashes into a window. But the ex
treme, self-conscious care with which
the filmmakers have set up each of
these "virtuoso" moments robs us of
some of the pleasure we might have
had in watching them if they — or
something in the movie — had been
arrived at spontaneously. Every
detail in "Blood Simple" is strategic,
down to the sputtering of the
electronic bug device during Marty's
tete-a-tete with the detective and the
measured drip of the faucet when
Ray returns from his bout with the
half-dead body of his lover's hus

band. And since the Coens don't
come up with anything else to fill our
senses or occupy our minds except for
these effects — moreover, since they
pause for every shot, every twist of
the uncomplicated plot to sink in —
after the first 20 minutes the film
seems to move very slowly indeed.
The Coens have a style, all right:
They overstate everything without
ever stating anything. And this ap
proach, which makes a viewer feel
he's been clobbered over the head
with a styrofoam hammer, extends to
the actors. Except for M. Emmet
Walsh, who does an amusing parody

of a profane, leering Texan, none of
them exhibits any personality, but
they act with a glazed intensity and
their meticulously rehearsed south
western accents slice the air cleanly.
Despite all the blood, this is a terribly
clean movie — "spare" and "terse"
and "economical" are the sorts of
words one might use to describe the
Coens' style, if one wished to compli
ment them. The fact is, though, that
they neglected to furnish a kernel of
wit or substance to hone the film
down to. The only apparent virtue in
"Blood Simple" besides its nifty labo
ratory effects is its directness, and
that's a collaborative virtue at best.
