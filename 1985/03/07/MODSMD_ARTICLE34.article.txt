# KZSU Picks
## 
### 
KZSU will air the most promising tracks from these albums tonight at 6
The rating scale if from one to five stars.

This is the weakest week we've seen in music in all
our many years as rock critics. No free records at
KZSU for us to use. No promo copy of the new Jagger
album. No promos of Tears For Fears' or Alison
Moyet's upcoming releases. Just the records pictured.
So we're stuck. Either we have to go with this stuff or
fork out big bucks at Tower. Now you know where our
priorities are. Hey, we have to pay tuition too.
Anyway, we found three promos with pretty enough
covers to lure you into reading the column, so now we
can do short reviews of the stuff we found and use the
extra space to review another album, "VU" by the
Velvet Underground, which we could only obtain on a
prerecorded cassette not suitable for photographing.
Prerecorded cassettes sound awful compared to
records. But we listened to it anyway. See how dedi
• cated we are?
The Replacements — Let It Be ★ ★
Not at all like their friendly, danceable single "1 Will
Dare." The rest goes from post-punk to post-gloom
without really going anywhere. End product: one more
depression record you bought for one happy single,
and now you hate yourself. All this non-creative post
stuff is really getting tiring. Where's the PRE?
Yello — Stella * * ★ ir
Complete trash, but the kind of trash you laugh at
and leave on. Like the Flying Lizards. The band
merges strange sound effects, strange vocals and
strange instrumentation that would really stink if it
weren't funny. The album drags at times, but has
enough yuks to keep you listening at least once. And it

probably grows on you after that. Nothing's as trendy
as "I Love You," Yello's previous hit. But the sheer
obnoxiousness of the rest of the album is worth it. A
great moan-along album.
Greg Kihn — Citizen Kihn ★ ix
Okay, we're not going to try to impress you with how
many times we can fit "kihn" into this review. We're
better than that. Greg has the power to generate a few
OK singles, but albums push it. Style is repetitive and
kickless, lyrics are very trite, instruments are played
without any inspiration. The happy popness that opens
the album degenerates into the usual mainstream by
the end. Don't ever buy this.
Velvet Underground — VU ★ ★ ★ ir
All the magazines are getting nostalgic and giving
old Velvet Underground reissues five stars, but we
can't do that because we were 4 years old at the
time they were originally released. Those sufficiently
into psychedelia should find "VU" significant and
meaningful; its progressivity and creativity can be put
into historical perspective and truly appreciated. But
those of us with little or no background in the area will
find little to hold on to, and what makes this album
worthwhile will be lost in the transition. The music
sounds much more primitive — yet conventional —
than it must have originally; time has improved upon
and tamed the style. "VU" is not as easy an introduc
tion to the band's music as is its more commercial, ac
cessible "Loaded"; so if you're not a veteran of the
times, don't feel guilty about not buying this "five
star" release.
