## Oakland A's owner explains the economics of playing ball 
### LARRY GREEN Staff writer 
"There's no such thing as sports
management," said Roy Eisenhardt,
president of the Oakland Athletics
baseball team. "There's nothing
unique about sports management. All
it involves is reducing to a common
denominator what human needs are."
In a speech at the Stanford Law
Forum yesterday, Eisenhard ad
dressed the legal and economic sub
jects involved with administrating a
professional baseball club.
"We'll chat a little about baseball,"
he said, aiming to give a picture of the
relationship between players and
teams on a "contractual" level.
Major league baseball has "a very
complex and long draft," he said.
Ouite often, players are chosen out of
high school or in their first three years
of college. Eisenhardt said, "It's rare
that players will go into baseball after
college."
On being drafted, the players often
sign with the club that choses them.
They can refuse to sign, but if they in
tend to play in the major leagues
there is no alternative but to sign, for
they can't play with another major
league team or its affiliates. Signing
bonuses range anywhere from $5,000
up to $ 150,000.
Once signed, players are required
to play seven years for the team in the
minor leagues, he said. At any time
during those seven years the player
can be called up to the major leagues,

but he must stay with the club, bar
ring injury, for seven years.
Eisenhardt said the top 40 players
in an orga-nization constitute the
"major league roster." The top 25
players in a professional baseball or
ganization are the players most fans
see at the ballpark during the regular
season.
Once a player makes it to the top
25 list, Eisenhardt said, "He must
play for two years at the contract the
team tenders." The minimum salary
for first-year players in the major
leagues is $40,000 per season.
After two years, the player can
negotiate a new contract on his own
or through arbitration. In the case of
arbitration, Eisenhardt said, "The
player has nothing to lose." But for
the owners — the ones paying the
athletes — the cost can be extremely
high. Using the recent Wade Boggs-
Boston Red Sox contract talks as an
example, Eisenhardt explained the
process of arbitration in a contract
negotiation. t
"The arbitrator can't split the
agreement down the middle as most
arbitrators like to do, " Eisenhardt
said. "He must take one or the
other." In the Boggs-Red Sox case,
the player, Wade Boggs, felt that he
was worth $1 million, citing the
salaries of other third basemen as a
reason for his request. The Red Sox
felt that he was worth $600,000. "If
the arbitrator thinks he (Boggs) is
worth $801,000, he's worth

$1 milllion. If the arbitrator thinks
he's worth $799,000, he's worth
$600,000"
After six years under contract in
the majors, a player can enter free
agency. This allows players to sell
their services to the team that bids the
highest. Eisenhardt praised the six
year period as a safety valve that
protects the market. By limiting the
supply of comparable players at one
time, the six-year period "improves
bargaining power" of the free agents.
"It (free agency) actually created a
very powerful market condition,"
Eisenhardt said. It forces the teams
"into an auction mentality, causing
them to pay more than it's worth."
Free agency, combined with arbitra
tion, is not easy for baseball adminis
trators to accept. "The big mistake
owners made in 1976 was not free
agency, but allowing arbitration to
stay in place," he said.
The two negotiating tools, when
combined, allow marginal players to
artificially hike their values. Eisen
hardt explained this phenomenon as a
reason for the A's recent trade with
the New York Yankees for Rickey
Henderson. "Obviously they are two
of the more valuable players . . . but it
didn't make economic sense to pay
$1.8 million when that was one-and
a-half times our attendence last
season," he said
Eisenhardt said some owners are at
least partly to blame for baseball's
skyrocketing salary structure.
