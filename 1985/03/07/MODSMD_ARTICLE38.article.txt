Due to a typographical error, a
March 4 letter to the editor mis
takenly read that "80 percent of Is
real's Jews fled racism. ..." The cor
rect number was 60 percent. The
Daily regrets the error.
Due to an editing error, a letter to

the editor yesterday misstated the au
thor's views. The correct version of
Derek Passarelli's letter reads, "In a
recent article, 'Promoter says student
group blocks concerts' (The Daily,
Feb. 28), a number of misleading
statements were attributed to the
Concert Network and Bill Graham."
The Daily regrets the error.

An article yesterday on the Tues
day night ASSU Senate meeting
stated that University President
Donald Kennedy offered positive
comments on two senate resolutions
concerning University divestment
from Motorola Corp. Kennedy did
not address the two resolutions. The
Daily regrets the error.
