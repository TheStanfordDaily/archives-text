# Faculty affect policy through senate
## 
### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Senior staff writer 
When the Faculty Senate meets this af
ternoon to discuss the proposed 1985-86
operating budget, it will be doing just one
of its many duties.
"The charter of the senate, in effect,
delegates to the senate the full functions of
the Academic Council," according to the
1984 Faculty Handbook.
"The Academic Council is vested with
the authority to discuss and decide upon
matters of policy within the province of the
professoriate, subject to the disapproval of
the Board of Trustees," it states.
ROTC, the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC), admissions policies and
the Hoover Institution are some of the
major issues the senate has faced since its
establishment, according to Bob Beyers,
director of the Stanford University News
Service. The senate also deals with faculty
appointments and curriculum matters,
such as distribution requirements.
The Faculty Senate was established in
September 1968 by the Academic Council,
a deliberative body of all faculty members
here.
The idea was initiated around 1966 be

cause it was believed the faculty needed its
own deliberative body, according to
Beyers.
"It has stood the test of time remarkably
well," Beyers said. The faculty, adminis
tration and Board of Trustees have yet to
overturn or reverse any decision made by
the senate, he said.
"The comments (of the senate) influ
ence the future course of events" at Stan
ford, Beyers said.
"Its influence exceeds its formal
process," he said. "When the Faculty Sen
ate took its position, that was it. . . . That's
power."
Former senate member and English
Prof. Ronald Rebholz, however, disagrees
with Beyers.
The senate "does little except talk about
reports from committees," Rebholz said. It
has some influence in "strictly academic
areas."
He said the senate could increase its
power if it would take on more "touchy is
sues." But the senate is "reluctant" to con
cern itself with the more "crucial areas" at
Stanford, according to Rebholz.
He cited attempts by faculty members to
define the University's relationship with
Hoover as an example of an issue in which

the senate should and did get involved.
Rebholz agreed that a motivating force
behind the senate's establishment was an
increase in efficiency. Even more impor
tant was the inability of the University
president and provost "to manage that
large body when angry," he said.
"The faculty gradually stripped itself of
the power that it had," he said. The large
Academic Council "reduced itself to a rep
resentative body."
"The faculty did it to themselves. . ..
(They) cut off their own power. The ad
ministration.certainly urged them to do it,"
he said.
Beyers said the Faculty Senate is special
because it combines both graduate and un
dergraduate professors into a collective
body, which discusses and votes on issues
relevant to all aspects of the University.
For example, it is highly unusual for rep
resentatives from a graduate school, such
as Stanford Medical School, to deliberate
undergraduate programs, such as distribu
tion requirements, Beyers said.
Harvard University, by contrast,
operates in a much more independent
manner, said Chris Georges, executive
editor of the Harvard Crimson newspaper.
An undergraduate faculty committee

made up of 12 members meets once a
week to discuss prevalent issues, such as
ROTC and the honor system.
The committee goes before the entire
undergraduate faculty, which meets once a
month, Georges said.
"On decisions they (the faculty mem
bers) vote on, they have the final say," he
said. Matters such as divestiture, however,
are out of the faculty's jurisdiction, al
though they make recommendations.
However, the different graduate schools
at Harvard do not have one body, but
make their own decisions, Georges said.
"There is no interchange from any of the
faculty," he said.
At UC-Berkeley, the division of the
Academic Senate is only one segment of a
larger senate made up of all University
of California campuses, said Ray Colvig,
public information officer for the Berkeley
campus. Ballots are sent to all UC faculty
members if their influence and unity are
needed on an issue.
The Berkeley senate is made up of 1,700
members from all the Berkeley schools,
because the professors teach at loth graduate
and undergraduate levels, Colvig said.
