"Fraternities must make a decision — either gov
ern themselves or he governed by the restrictions the
University will place on them. Dean of Student Af
fairs James Lyons told about 15 people in an open
panel discussion on the future of Stanford s fraterni
ties and sororities last night at Yost House.
Joining Lyons on the panel were Rick Hoskins.
president of the Inter-I raternity Council, and Laura
Nelson, president of the Inter-Sorority Council. The
panelists stressed the need for better communication
between fraternal organizations and the University
and the need to change the focus of rush activities.
"Residential Education wouldn't do a good job of
declaring qualifications or guidelines which the fra
ternities should follow," Lyons said. "All we can do
is urge changes and hope the frats make the right
decisions."
Hoskins stressed that many positive changes urged
by Res Ed have already been implemented. One sig
nificant shift has been the attitude of fraternities and
sororities toward rush, he said.
"The atmosphere of rush week is definitely chang
ing," Hoskins said. "We're trying to inform potential
members about fraternities a lot more than in the
past. Instead of drinking games, we want to make the
atmosphere more conducive to meeting people and
finding out what frats are about."
Hoskins said outreach programs, such as explain
ing rush to freshmen with an official letter and be

coming visible to students through extracurricular ac
tivities and community service programs, will greatly
help fraternities change the focus of rush.
This new focus, Lyons believes, is essential to the
future of fraternal organizations here. "Some frater
nities are devoid of organizational substance," Lyons
said. "Rush must be a time to sort out the drifters,
the fraternities which have no real purpose other
than, 'Here's the keg,' and develop a mission of brot
herhood which really embodies what Stanford and
fraternities are supposed to be about."
However, Lyons also said many upperclass
residences are "devoid of meaning and substance,"
and it is therefore not fair to equate the two groups.
And though only 12 of Stanford's 28 fraternal organ
izations are housed, the pride and community that
exists among members of a fraternity is often absent
in dormitories, he said.
Though a good deal of uncertainty on the position
of fraternal organizations remains, the need for com
munication is vital, Lyons said, particularly between
residential and non-residential fraternities. To
facilitate this need, he added, the top item on the
agenda of Fraternal Affairs Adviser Joe Pisano, who
will assume that new position in June, will be to plan
the formation of a lodge or center to meet the needs
of unhoused fraternities. Lyons expects temporary
arrangements for such a place midway through next
year.
