# Yost illness a mystery
## 
### CAMERON KALLER Senior staff writer 
Health officials said yesterday that they still
don't know what caused a 24-hour illness that
struck nearly half the residents of Yost House
over a five-day period recently.
Between last Thursday and Monday, a total of
28 Yost residents suffered from the illness, which
forced students to miss classes and outside activi
ties.
Yost resident Jennifer Wald said students
developed "sudden high temperatures and were
throwing up a lot" because of the sickness.
But Resident Assistant Bill Martin said yester
day that the cause of the illness is still unknown.
"There are two speculations," resident Wayne
Alabardo said. "It seems that it was either food
poisoning or a stomach virus."
According to Martin, students were not able to
get stool samples to Cowell Student Health Cen
ter quickly enough for analyses of possible
causes.
"Whenever that many people get sick within
such a short period of time, it's usually food
poisoning," said Dr. Cathy Stevenson, a Cowell
physician, "but we have no way of knowing for
sure without further evidence."
Martin said, "It is routine procedure, when a
lot of people in one residence become ill, to
notify the (Santa Clara) County Board of Health,
which we did. All they can do is pass out ques
tionnaires asking all about when and what people
ate, and how they felt when they got sick.
Chances are they'll conjecture from that and still
not know what it is."
Dr. De Armond, a Board of Health official,
said yesterday that "no definite diagnosis has
been made."
It is still not known if the illness is a result of
food poisoning or a strong viral infection, Ar
mond said.
"We've sent over an environmental sanitarian
to investigate what the conditions were," she
said. "We'll try to evaluate if there was a product
the kitchen purchased that was defective, or to
determine if a meal wasn't served hot enough or
cold enough. Maybe we'll find that it was not
food-borne at all."
Stevenson said, "It's probably no one's fault.
It's impossible to know how much food is put out
on the table the next day that is from a previous
meal and has possibly gone bad. There really is
no evidence at this point to incriminate one meal
against another."
Some Yost residents speculated that a Chinese
New Year's dinner served the evening before
people became ill might have contributed to the
outbreak. But Armond said the dinner could be
"just a coincidence."
Stevenson said. "The food-handling practices
at Stanford are very good ... despite what
people want to say about campus food."
Martin said that "if the illness had anything to
do with food sickness ... it certainly wasn't the
cook's fault, but, rather, the problem was with
the food itself. It could have been the rice or any
thing.
"Our cook is probably the best
University cook on campus. He's
really conscientious," Martin said.
Some students were incon
venienced, but University Food
Service, which Martin said was
"just wonderful" throughout the
sickness, helped provide supplies
for the ill.

Although most afflicted residents
were able to stay in bed and rest,
one student went to Minneapolis
last Thursday, became ill and was
unable to attend his scheduled job
interview. However, he was able to
reschedule it for Friday.
Another student was supposed to
go to New York for an interview at
Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc., an in
vestment banking firm, but was too
ill to get on a plane, according to
Martin .
