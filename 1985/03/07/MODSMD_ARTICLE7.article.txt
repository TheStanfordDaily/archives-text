DEA agent's body found in Mexico
MEXICO CITY — The bodies of kidnapped U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration agent Enrique Camarena and a Mexican colleague were
found yesterday near the rural home of a family of accused narcotics
traffickers who died last weekend in a police shoot-out, Mexican and
U.S. officials announced.
Positive identification of the bodies was made by U.S. and Mexican
ai/thorities yesterday afternoon in Guadalajara, a U.S. Embassy spokes
man said. TTie two men apparently were killed shortly after their abduc
tion a month ago. Initial reports that the bodies showed signs of torture
could not be confirmed.
Although the discovery represents "the first real breakthrough in the
case" since the abduction, apparent discrepancies in the officially re
ported details of the raid that led to the recovery of the corpses have
caused "confusion" regarding the kidnappers' presumed motives and
identities, U.S. sources said. "There are a lot of inconsistencies, a lot of
holes in the story," according to one source.
Discovered near the city of Zamora in the state of Michoacan, the
badly decomposed bodies were transported for detailed autopsies to
Guadalajara, capital of neighboring Jalisco State. Camarena and
Alfredo Zavala Avelar, a Mexican government pilot who had flown mis
sions for the DEA here, had been kidnapped Feb. 7 in separate incidents
in different parts of Guadalajara.
The corpses were reportedly found at 4 a.m. and were buried in plastic
bags on property behind the home of Manuel Bravo Cervantes, who was
killed on Saturday with his wife and two sons in a confrontation with
Mexican police. A former Michoacan state congressman, Bravo Cer
vantes, w.as said by Mexican federal officials to be involved in drug
running, car theft and highway assaults in the Michoacan-Jalisco region.
According to police reports, all four members of the Bravo family
responded to surrender demands with rifle fire, prompting a prolonged
exchange in which one federal judicial police age/it died after being hit
with 17 bullets from an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle.
Mexican federal police reported the confiscation from the Bravo
home of two pounds of cocaine and several high-powered weapons, in
cluding two AR-15s and three M-ls.
For more than a year before his kidnapping, Camarena was involved
in "Operation Godfather," a joint U.S.-Mexican investigation of
Mexican cocaine smuggling. DEA agent Edward Heath, who runs the
agency's Mexican program, was at the Bravo home Wednesday morning
to assist in the identification of Camarena's body, sources reported.
Thai forces hit Vietnamese
BANGKOK — Thai forces called in air strikes yesterday in a fierce
battle to repel Vietnamese units that crossed the Thai-Cambodian bor
der in a drive to wipe out the last Cambodian guerrilla base along the
embattled frontier, the Thai military reported.
Thai air force fighter-bombers flew missions against about 1,000 Viet
namese who crossed the northern Cambodian border Tuesday in two
places, as Thai ground troops backed by artillery fought to dislodge
them, the army spokesman, Maj. Gen. Narudon Dejpradiyuth, told a
press conference.
• He said more than 60 Vietnamese soldiers were killed in the fighting,
while Thai losses were two killed and 15 wounded. No independent con
firmation was immediately available.
The main Vietnamese incursion, in which about 800 troops were in
volvedi was aimed at surrounding the Cambodian resistance base called
Green Hill on an escarpment about two miles across the border from the
Thai village of Tatum, the Thai military said.
Thai military and resistance sources said the anti-Vietnamese guerril
las continued to hold the Green Hill base, but details of the fighting were
sketchy, and reporters were not allowed to visit the scene.
The base is defended by as many as 5,000 Cambodian guerrillas loyal
to Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who heads a three-party resistance coali
tion recognized by the United Nations as Cambodia's legal government.
The Vietnamese, who invaded Cambodia in December 1978 and in
stalled a protege government in Phnom Penh led by Heng Samrin, are
fighting to complete their most successful dry-season offensive of the
six-year war by wiping out all the resistance bases of the three guerrilla
groups along the 450-mile Thai-Cambodian border.
In Washington, State Department spokesman Bernard Kalb said the
United States strongly condemned the Vietnamese offensives. He said
U.S. military equipment and supplies destined for Thailand have "been
put at the head of the pipeline to expedite the shipment" and are ex
pected to arrive early in April.
Iran offers to halt Iraq shelling
TEHRAN — Iran yesterday threatened renewed counterstrikes
against Iraq but offered at the same time to halt shelling of the riverport
city of Basra if Iraq returns to an earlier agreement not to attack civilian
targets.
The offer was published by Tehran's official news agency shortly after
Iranian President Ali Khameini delivered a threat to hit selected indus
trial targets within Iraq if Baghdad carried out its vow to bomb 30
Iranian cities.
The agerfcy quoted a "high-ranking Iranian foreign ministry official"
as saying Tehran would consider a halt to the shelling of Basra "when
the Iraqi regime once again announces its commitment to the precise im
plementation of the June 12 agreement."
The accord pledged both sides in the 53-month-old Persian Gulf con
flict to refrain from attacks on non-military objectives.
The deal collapsed Tuesday when Iran opened artillery fire on Basra
— allegedly in retaliation for Iraq attacks on the towns of Ahvaz and
Bushehr in which 12 people were killed Monday. Iraq denied the raids
and announced counterstrikes on 30 Iranian cities for Wednesday.
Jordan's king calls for peace talks
HURGHADA, Egypt — King Hussein of Jordan appealed yesterday
for a U.S.-Palestinian dialogue as a first step toward Mideast peace talks.
He called on the United States to seize this "last chance" to settle the
Arab-Israeli conflict.
Hussein and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, meeting in this Red
Sea resort town, made clear the dialogue would have to include mem
bers of the Palestine Liberation Organization or at least Palestinians ac
ceptable to the guerrillas. The Egyptian president's proposal was of
fered as a way to get Middle East peace talks started and provide a
forum to draw the United States' into peace talks.
The United States has refused to negotiate with the PLO unless it
recognizes the existence of Israel. The Israeli government, which also
refuses to meet with the PLO, has opposed preliminary talks that ex
clude Israel.
Mubarak's proposal calls for the dialogue to be followed by talks in
volving Israel, the United States and the joint delegation. Once the
various sides have reached agreement, an international conference in
cluding the five permanent U.N. Security Council members would be
convened to ratify the settlement.
The Egyptian president plans to discuss the proposal when he meets
with President Reagan in Washington next week.
Gandhi's party suffers defeats
BANGALORE. India — Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi yesterday suf
fered his first political defeats since taking over from his mother, assas
sinated Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, as voters installed opposition
governments in two key south Indian states.
Overall, in state elections concluded this week, Gandhi's ruling
Congress-I Party won in eight out of 11 states, including Uttar Pradesh
state, the party's northern India stronghold. But lopsided losses in the
heavily populated southern India states of Andhra Pradesh and here in
the Karnataka, as well as in the smaller state of Sikkim, took the shine
off the victories.
The losses in the south, coupled with a poorer than expected showing
for the ruling party in Maharashtra state, served to revive the opposition,
which had suffered heavy losses in the December elections for the na
tional Parliament.

places, as Thai ground troops backed by artillery fought to dislodge
them, the army spokesman, Maj. Gen. Narudon Dejpradiyuth, told a
press conference.
• He said more than 60 Vietnamese soldiers were killed in the fighting,
while Thai losses were two killed and 15 wounded. No independent con
firmation was immediately available.
The main Vietnamese incursion, in which about 800 troops were in
volvedi was aimed at surrounding the Cambodian resistance base called
Green Hill on an escarpment about two miles across the border from the
Thai village of Tatum, the Thai military said.
Thai military and resistance sources said the anti-Vietnamese guerril
las continued to hold the Green Hill base, but details of the fighting were
sketchy, and reporters were not allowed to visit the scene.
The base is defended by as many as 5,000 Cambodian guerrillas loyal
to Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who heads a three-party resistance coali
tion recognized by the United Nations as Cambodia's legal government.
The Vietnamese, who invaded Cambodia in December 1978 and in
stalled a protege government in Phnom Penh led by Heng Samrin, are
fighting to complete their most successful dry-season offensive of the
six-year war by wiping out all the resistance bases of the three guerrilla
groups along the 450-mile Thai-Cambodian border.
In Washington, State Department spokesman Bernard Kalb said the
United States strongly condemned the Vietnamese offensives. He said
U.S. military equipment and supplies destined for Thailand have "been
put at the head of the pipeline to expedite the shipment" and are ex
pected to arrive early in April.
Iran offers to halt Iraq shelling
TEHRAN — Iran yesterday threatened renewed counterstrikes
against Iraq but offered at the same time to halt shelling of the riverport
city of Basra if Iraq returns to an earlier agreement not to attack civilian
targets.
The offer was published by Tehran's official news agency shortly after
Iranian President Ali Khameini delivered a threat to hit selected indus
trial targets within Iraq if Baghdad carried out its vow to bomb 30
Iranian cities.
The agerfcy quoted a "high-ranking Iranian foreign ministry official"
as saying Tehran would consider a halt to the shelling of Basra "when
the Iraqi regime once again announces its commitment to the precise im
plementation of the June 12 agreement."
The accord pledged both sides in the 53-month-old Persian Gulf con
flict to refrain from attacks on non-military objectives.
The deal collapsed Tuesday when Iran opened artillery fire on Basra
— allegedly in retaliation for Iraq attacks on the towns of Ahvaz and
Bushehr in which 12 people were killed Monday. Iraq denied the raids
and announced counterstrikes on 30 Iranian cities for Wednesday.
Jordan's king calls for peace talks
HURGHADA, Egypt — King Hussein of Jordan appealed yesterday
for a U.S.-Palestinian dialogue as a first step toward Mideast peace talks.
He called on the United States to seize this "last chance" to settle the
Arab-Israeli conflict.
Hussein and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, meeting in this Red
Sea resort town, made clear the dialogue would have to include mem
bers of the Palestine Liberation Organization or at least Palestinians ac
ceptable to the guerrillas. The Egyptian president's proposal was of
fered as a way to get Middle East peace talks started and provide a
forum to draw the United States' into peace talks.
The United States has refused to negotiate with the PLO unless it
recognizes the existence of Israel. The Israeli government, which also
refuses to meet with the PLO, has opposed preliminary talks that ex
clude Israel.
Mubarak's proposal calls for the dialogue to be followed by talks in
volving Israel, the United States and the joint delegation. Once the
various sides have reached agreement, an international conference in
cluding the five permanent U.N. Security Council members would be
convened to ratify the settlement.
The Egyptian president plans to discuss the proposal when he meets
with President Reagan in Washington next week.
Gandhi's party suffers defeats
BANGALORE. India — Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi yesterday suf
fered his first political defeats since taking over from his mother, assas
sinated Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, as voters installed opposition
governments in two key south Indian states.
Overall, in state elections concluded this week, Gandhi's ruling
Congress-I Party won in eight out of 11 states, including Uttar Pradesh
state, the party's northern India stronghold. But lopsided losses in the
heavily populated southern India states of Andhra Pradesh and here in
the Karnataka, as well as in the smaller state of Sikkim, took the shine
off the victories.
The losses in the south, coupled with a poorer than expected showing
for the ruling party in Maharashtra state, served to revive the opposition,
which had suffered heavy losses in the December elections for the na
tional Parliament.
DEA agent's body found in Mexico
MEXICO CITY — The bodies of kidnapped U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration agent Enrique Camarena and a Mexican colleague were
found yesterday near the rural home of a family of accused narcotics
traffickers who died last weekend in a police shoot-out, Mexican and
U.S. officials announced.
Positive identification of the bodies was made by U.S. and Mexican
ai/thorities yesterday afternoon in Guadalajara, a U.S. Embassy spokes
man said. TTie two men apparently were killed shortly after their abduc
tion a month ago. Initial reports that the bodies showed signs of torture
could not be confirmed.
Although the discovery represents "the first real breakthrough in the
case" since the abduction, apparent discrepancies in the officially re
ported details of the raid that led to the recovery of the corpses have
caused "confusion" regarding the kidnappers' presumed motives and
identities, U.S. sources said. "There are a lot of inconsistencies, a lot of
holes in the story," according to one source.
Discovered near the city of Zamora in the state of Michoacan, the
badly decomposed bodies were transported for detailed autopsies to
Guadalajara, capital of neighboring Jalisco State. Camarena and
Alfredo Zavala Avelar, a Mexican government pilot who had flown mis
sions for the DEA here, had been kidnapped Feb. 7 in separate incidents
in different parts of Guadalajara.
The corpses were reportedly found at 4 a.m. and were buried in plastic
bags on property behind the home of Manuel Bravo Cervantes, who was
killed on Saturday with his wife and two sons in a confrontation with
Mexican police. A former Michoacan state congressman, Bravo Cer
vantes, w.as said by Mexican federal officials to be involved in drug
running, car theft and highway assaults in the Michoacan-Jalisco region.
According to police reports, all four members of the Bravo family
responded to surrender demands with rifle fire, prompting a prolonged
exchange in which one federal judicial police age/it died after being hit
with 17 bullets from an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle.
Mexican federal police reported the confiscation from the Bravo
home of two pounds of cocaine and several high-powered weapons, in
cluding two AR-15s and three M-ls.
For more than a year before his kidnapping, Camarena was involved
in "Operation Godfather," a joint U.S.-Mexican investigation of
Mexican cocaine smuggling. DEA agent Edward Heath, who runs the
agency's Mexican program, was at the Bravo home Wednesday morning
to assist in the identification of Camarena's body, sources reported.
