# Reagan vetoes farm aid bill
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Declaring that "someone in
Washington must be responsible," President
Reagan vetoed the emergency farm credit relief bill
yesterday and vowed to keep vetoing legislation
"again and again until spending is brought under
control."
Democratic sponsors of the bill, which won final
passage by the House only Tuesday, immediately
threw in the political towel anu announced they
would not attempt to override the president's veto.
Reagan's ability to sustain the veto was "a foregone
conclusion," House Speaker Thomas "Tip"
O'Neill (D-Mass.) acknowledged.
Reagan has vetoed 40 bills during his presidency,
and all but four have been sustained.
The president previously had threatened to veto
the farm bill — denouncing it as "a budget buster"
— and he carried out the threat in the oval office
with great fanfare and a blistering attack on
Congress, always one of his favorite political tar
gets.
The Democratic-sponsored bill — passed with
the help of 30 Republicans in the House and 16
Republicans in the Senate — would have provided
$1.85 billion in loan guarantees for U.S. farmers,
$100 million to help rural banks lower interest
rates on troubled loans and $7 billion to make
loans at planting time that normally are not made
until harvest. These farm amendments were at
tached to a $175 million African famine relief mea
sure.
"I certainly don't think that tying this to a bill for

food aid for the starving people of Africa was ex
actly the way to go," Reagan said. "As a matter of
fact, it emphasizes the need for a line-item veto."
Under line-item veto authority, which most gover
nors possess, a chief executive can veto certain ele
ments of a bill without scrubbing the whole mea
sure.
"I've pleaded and warned repeatedly," Reagan
said, in remarks prepared for a national television
audience, "that just as your families don't have a
blank check for whatever your needs may be, nei
ther can the government — and that means the tax
payer — bail out every farmer hopelessly in debt,
or every bank which made imprudent or
speculative loans and bet on higher inflation."
Reagan noted his adminsitration already is pro
viding nearly $4.5 billion in farm credits this year.
He also contended that only 4 percent of the na
tion's farmers "have any liquidity problems." Con
gressional experts, however, have estimated that 5
percent of the nation's farmers stand to go bank
rupt this year.
"I (had) asked for help," Reagan said. "I asked
Congress — which just days ago was bemoaning
the size of deficits— to demonstrate courage, hold
the line and match rhetoric with deeds. Congress
failed. In the first major bill since convening in Jan
uary, a majority proved itself incapable of resisting
the very tax-and-spend philosophy that brought
America to its knees and wrecked our economy.
"The bottom line," he continued, "is that some
one in Washington must be responsible. Someone

must be willing to stand up for those who pay
America's bills. And someone must stand up to
those who say,' Here's the key. here's the Treasury,
just take as many of those hard-earned tax dollars
as you want.'
"I hope that Congress will get the message and
work with me to reduce spending in a responsible
way that does not threaten our national security. If
it doesn't, then I'll do what must be done. I will
veto again and again until spending is brought un
der control."
In the hours leading up to the veto, about 200
farmers marched to the White House and held a
rally across the street, guarded by several
policemen mounted on horseback. When six con
gressmen and some of the farmers tried to deliver
the actual bill to be vetoed to the main White
House gate, they were shunted side to a mailroom a
block away. Their requests to see the president also
were rejected.
"If he has time for (Heisman Trophy football
star) Doug Flutie, if he has time for every movie
star from Hollywood, you'd think he'd have time
for six congressman and representatives of Ameri
can family farms," complained Rep. Timothy
Penny (D-Minn.), one of the farm bill sponsors.
O'Neill told reporters. "The president needs to
know that politics is the art of compromise. .. . For
an administration that has added a trillion dollars
to the national debt, this (farm bill) was a
reasonable price for ensuring the survival of an
American way of life."
