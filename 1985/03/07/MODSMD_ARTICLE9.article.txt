# American citizens leave Lebanon
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — U.S. citizens working with
the United Nations have been pulled out of south
ern Lebanon following threats against their lives by
Shiite Moslem guerrillas.
The order from U.N. headquarters in New York
Friday affects 16 U.S. military observers and 17
U.S. civilian employees working for the 10-country
U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), which
has been caught in the middle of the increasingly
violent confrontations between Shiite militias and
departing Israeli troops.
This departure further diminishes the small U.S.
presence left in Lebanon, a country that President
Reagan once described as having vital, strategic im
portance to the United States.
Although State Department officials refused to
discuss the pullout, foreign diplomats in Washing
ton said the United States had asked U.N. officials
to initiate the pullout after receiving information
about two threats against U.S. personnel in south
ern Lebanon. One threat was general and vague, a

diplomat said, but the other named as a target a
U.S. military officer in the U.N. observer force in
the southern Lebanon city of Tyre.
Israeli radio said Shiite extremists had
threatened to attack or kidnap U.S. citizens in
Lebanon and that the radical Hezbaflah Shiite fac
tion had threatened to attack U.S. citizens working
in the U.N. force if the United States carried out its
threat to veto a U.N. Security Council resolution.
The resolution, proposed by the Lebanese, sharply
condemns Israel's "iron fist" policy in southern
Lebanon villages. Israel has said it adopted the
policy to protect its troops as they withdraw.
Similar warnings preceded the suicide car bomb
attack last September on the U.S. Embassy annex
outside East Beirut, the third such attack against a
U.S. installation in Lebanon in less than two years.
"It was only prudent advice and a safety precau
tion," UNIFIL spokesman Timor Goksel said of
the decision to keep the U.S. citizens in the north
ern Israeli town of Nahariyya, where they live when
they are off duty.

"It was a temporary measure for the lime being
and no decision has been taken to reassign them,"
he added.
Foreign diplomats here said yesterday that at the
request of U.S. officials, the Security Council has
delayed consideration of the Lebanese resolution.
They said U.S. officials are lobbying behind the
scenes at the United Nations to get the resolution
watered down, apparently in an effort to avoid
having to veto it.
Even moderate Shiite leaders in Lebanon have
threatened reprisals if the United States does veto
it. The top Shiite religious leader in Lebanon,
Mohammed Mehdi Chamseddine, said in a state
ment published in Beirut newspapers Tuesday he
would lead a drive to cut diplomatic relations with
the United States if that happened.
At the height of U.S. involvement in Lebanon
two years ago, there were more than 1,200 Marines
stationed on the outskirts of Beirut, and a large
diplomatic mission.
