Chrysler won't expand
NEW YORK — Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee
lacocca said yesterday his company is abandon
ing plans for hundreds of millions of dollars in
domestic expansion in favor of foreign purchases,
largely because >112 the Reagan administration's
decision not to n quest a fifth year of quotas on
Japanese auto exports to this country.
In all, lacocca said Chrysler was cutting $2 bil
lion from plans to invest $12.5 billion in new
plants and products in North America over the
next five years. Analysts estimated the change
would cost the nation up to 20,000 new jobs.
"Our job now is to see that we keep the pro
duction capacity and the jobs that we already
have here ... to keep Chrysler strong and
profitable. We can't be thinking about expansion
now," lacocca said.
Reagan, Soviet meet
WASHINGTON — President Reagan and a
senior member of the Soviet Politburo held "a
lively give and take" in the Oval Office yester
day, warming up for the resumption of arms talks
next Tuesday by arguing over "Star Wars."
Reagan emphasized to Vladimir Shcherbitsky,
according to White House spokesman Larry
Speakes, that the Kremlin should not regard his
space-based missile defense program as
"threatening."

For now, Star Wars is only in the research
stage, Reagan was said to have told Shcherbitsky,
and if a system is ever developed, "we would sit
down and discuss ways to deploy it in a stabilizing
manner."
Afterward in the White House driveway,
Shcherbitsky told several dozen reporters that he
"tried to prove" to Reagan that the $26 billion
research program was "not worthwhile."
"Today such a system could be defensive, but
tomorrow it could become offensive," the high
ranking Kremlin official asserted. "If the United
States pursues this line, the Soviet Union will
have to take adequate measures." Asked what
kind of measures, he replied, "Offensive, defen
sive, but adequate to the measures of the United
States."
Heart patient stays alive
TUCSON, Az. — While an auto mechanic
clinged to life after receiving three hearts — one
artificial — within 48 hours, federal health offi
cials indicated yesterday they would not take
punitive action against the hospital that used the
man-made device without their approval.
The patient, Thomas Creighton, 33, is in criti
cal condition at the University of Arizona Health
Sciences Center here where the surgeries were
performed by a team headed by Dr. Jack
Copeland with the assistance of doctors from St.
Luke's Hospital in Phoenix.

After Creighton's first transplanted heart
failed Wednesday, doctors used the artificial
heart to keep the patient alive for 11 hours until a
second organ was obtained and transplanted.
The surgeons said they used the artificial heart
because it was Creighton's "only chance of sur
vival."
Officials of the federal Food and Drug Admin
istration on Wednesday had expressed concern
about use of the device without their approval or
knowledge. But yesterday, FDA spokesman
William Grigg said in Washington that it was
"unlikely" the agency would take action against
the Arizona hospital.
The chief threat to Creighton's life now is the
accumulation of fluids in his lungs, Dr. Allan
Beigel, a university spokesman, said yesterday.
