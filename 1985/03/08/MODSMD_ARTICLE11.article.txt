Scriptwriters negotiate
LOS ANGELES — Striking scriptwriters
headed back to the bargaining table yesterday for
the first time since launching a strike that is forc
ing some live TV shows into reruns and scuttling
the final three episodes of television's top-rated
show.
"It is terrific that both sides are back at the
bargaining table," said Joseph Sutton, spokes
man for the 9,000-member Writers Guild of
America, which began its strike against
moviemakers and TV producers Tuesday.
"Both sides are returning in all seriousness to
try to work out a settlement," Sutton said. "Both
sides appear to be willing to give."
However, Sutton, producers' spokesman
Charles Weisenberg and Commissioner Leonard
Farrell of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation
Service declined to speculate on possible conces
sions or a timetable for agreement.
The writers' last strike lasted 13 weeks in
1981.
Three TV shows that are produced live and
need writers for new material daily have become
quick victims of the walkout.
NBC officials said Wednesday that they would
begin airing reruns of "Saturday Night Live,"
"The Tonight Show" and"The David Letterman
Show" because they couldn't count on writers to
produce fresh material.
NBC also said it intends to cancel the final

three episodes of its top-rated comedy, "The
Cosby Show," starring Bill Cosby.
Ag leaders back veto
SACRAMENTO — California agriculture
leaders yesterday supported President Reagan's
veto of the emergency farm credit bill as a neces
sary move in line with plans to reduce the federal
budget deficit.
"The bill is a short-term band-aid approach
that wouldn't have much impact on California
farmers," said Jack King, a California Farm
Bureau Federation spokesman. "We have to deal
with the real problem: the high dollar and the
budget deficit."
But Wednesday's veto must be followed by
budget tightening across the board, including
defense, he added.
"We view President Reagan's veto as sym
bolic. If he didn't hold the line for farming, he
wouldn't be able to hold the line on any other
programs," King said.
The California Farm Bureau considers the
emergency bill largely a "farm bailout" for the
Midwest, King added.
Many small, rural Midwest banks with large
percentages of their loans out to farmers need
government loan guarantees provided in the
emergency bill. But most California banks have a
much larger asset base and a more diversified
loan portfolio, he said.

Aid record released
LOS ANGELES — "We Are the World," an
anthem flowing with the voices of 45 American
superstars, was released on radio and in record
stores yesterday, with its proceeds targeted for
the hungry in Africa and the United States.
The tune, written by Michael Jackson and
Lionel Richie and produced by Quincy Jones, is
layered with some of the most recognizable
voices in American pop music: Richie, Jackson,
James Ingram, Willie Nelson, Ray Charles,
Kenny Rogers, Dionne Warwick, Diana Ross,
Bob Dylan and Cyndi Lauper are among those
who have small solo parts.
The song, which is projected to raise $50 mil
lion, includes a powerful duet with Stevie
Wonder and Bruce Springsteen.
"There's never been a record of this type ever
produced ... no one can express yet how big this
record is going to be," said Harriet Sternberg, a ,
spokeswoman for United Support of Artists for
Africa, the name given the supergroup.
Today's weather
Rain is likely to return today, with high tem
peratures in the 50s. Winds will increase, in a
southerly direction; the rain will continue into
the night with lows in the 40s. Look for more of
the same tomorrow.
