"I think that being a university professor is the ultimate
profession. I'm doing what I love with my science," says
chemist Richard Zare, who recently received the National
Medal of Science.
Zare, a Shell Distinguished Professor of Chemistry at
Stanford, says he enjoys the opportunity to teach as well
as conduct research. "I love teaching. I really get a big
kick out of it. ... I get a great feeling of excitement and
enthusiasm out of talking with people about things I'm in
terested in."
Zare has taught numerous courses, ranging from physi
cal chemistry for freshmen to advanced quantum mechan
ics for graduate students. "My favorite course is freshman
chemistry," he says. "What excited me so much about that
course is that that was the chance to interest people, to
say, 'Ah! I am interested in chemistry.'
"What good is teaching? Do you actually teach to trans
mit facts?" he asks. "I claim that books do much better at
transmitting facts. ... I think in teaching you're inspiring
people to read and learn the facts themselves and to dis
cuss it, to go on in the field. . . . What you're trying to do is
tell people why you find this so exciting and why they
should and how it fits into what they're thinking."
Zare's committment to teaching is evident in Chemistry
123, an introductory course for non-science majors that
fulfills the University's undergraduate science require
ment. "I'm really trying to get people to appreciate the
very complex technological world we live in, that they're
going to have to be involved with all their lives," he ex
plains.
"Have you heard the phrase that war is too important
to be left to the generals?" he asks. "I think science is too
important to be left only to the scientists. I think there are
non-scientists who will be making the decisions about
what type of society we will have. ... It is important that
people have an understanding of what's technically possi
ble and what's not technically possible.
"Also, it's a real pity to feel that you're not involved

with that part of the world that 'is technical or scientific.' I
think this understanding and involvement is a very impor
tant part of a full education. This is called a liberal arts
education."
Students and colleagues agree that Zare's enthusiasm is
evident when he teaches. "He is a very good teacher. He
always stayed after class to talk and answer your ques
tions," says Sarah Williams, a graduate student in
chemistry and a former TA for Zare.
"He's turned on, he's excited, he's committed. 1 think
that comes through in his teaching. He doesn't treat it as a
chore," says Chemistry Prof. John Brauman. The
Chemistry 123 course especially "has been a labor of love.
He really put his heart into it."
Steve Harris, professor of applied physics and electrical
engineering, calls Zare "a dynamic lecturer. ... I have
seen him literally put on comedy acts to illustrate his
lectures."
Zare says teaching benefits his research. "Teaching is
the secret weapon of academic researchers because it al
ways forces you to go back to basics and fundamen
tals. ... It forces you again to ask yourself questions."
Zare is especially adept at asking questions, says
Brauman. " He is open and receptive to crazy ideas and at
the same time he has a penetrating intellect that gets right
to the heart of the things."
Zare believes that "you need flexibility and nimbleness
of mind to put together all the data you gather. You start
by making up simple pictures or theories and you have to
dare to be different. That means you expose yourself.
That makes you very vulnerable. But you need that. If you
aren't different you can't make the new type of discovery.
"Knowledge starts by understanding that which you
don't know. That sounds corny enough," he laughs. "1
think it's true, though. You've got to be able to not be
afraid of making mistakes. No mistakes, no progress.
Being able to correct them is what's essential."
Science is a humanistic activity, Zare says."I believe
