## Chemistry prof. displays humor and probing mind Features 
### MARY YUH Editorial staff 
"I think that being a university professor is the ultimate
profession. I'm doing what I love with my science," says
chemist Richard Zare, who recently received the National
Medal of Science.
Zare, a Shell Distinguished Professor of Chemistry at
Stanford, says he enjoys the opportunity to teach as well
as conduct research. "I love teaching. I really get a big
kick out of it. ... I get a great feeling of excitement and
enthusiasm out of talking with people about things I'm in
terested in."
Zare has taught numerous courses, ranging from physi
cal chemistry for freshmen to advanced quantum mechan
ics for graduate students. "My favorite course is freshman
chemistry," he says. "What excited me so much about that
course is that that was the chance to interest people, to
say, 'Ah! I am interested in chemistry.'
"What good is teaching? Do you actually teach to trans
mit facts?" he asks. "I claim that books do much better at
transmitting facts. ... I think in teaching you're inspiring
people to read and learn the facts themselves and to dis
cuss it, to go on in the field. . . . What you're trying to do is
tell people why you find this so exciting and why they
should and how it fits into what they're thinking."
Zare's committment to teaching is evident in Chemistry
123, an introductory course for non-science majors that
fulfills the University's undergraduate science require
ment. "I'm really trying to get people to appreciate the
very complex technological world we live in, that they're
going to have to be involved with all their lives," he ex
plains.
"Have you heard the phrase that war is too important
to be left to the generals?" he asks. "I think science is too
important to be left only to the scientists. I think there are
non-scientists who will be making the decisions about
what type of society we will have. ... It is important that
people have an understanding of what's technically possi
ble and what's not technically possible.
"Also, it's a real pity to feel that you're not involved

with that part of the world that 'is technical or scientific.' I
think this understanding and involvement is a very impor
tant part of a full education. This is called a liberal arts
education."
Students and colleagues agree that Zare's enthusiasm is
evident when he teaches. "He is a very good teacher. He
always stayed after class to talk and answer your ques
tions," says Sarah Williams, a graduate student in
chemistry and a former TA for Zare.
"He's turned on, he's excited, he's committed. 1 think
that comes through in his teaching. He doesn't treat it as a
chore," says Chemistry Prof. John Brauman. The
Chemistry 123 course especially "has been a labor of love.
He really put his heart into it."
Steve Harris, professor of applied physics and electrical
engineering, calls Zare "a dynamic lecturer. ... I have
seen him literally put on comedy acts to illustrate his
lectures."
Zare says teaching benefits his research. "Teaching is
the secret weapon of academic researchers because it al
ways forces you to go back to basics and fundamen
tals. ... It forces you again to ask yourself questions."
Zare is especially adept at asking questions, says
Brauman. " He is open and receptive to crazy ideas and at
the same time he has a penetrating intellect that gets right
to the heart of the things."
Zare believes that "you need flexibility and nimbleness
of mind to put together all the data you gather. You start
by making up simple pictures or theories and you have to
dare to be different. That means you expose yourself.
That makes you very vulnerable. But you need that. If you
aren't different you can't make the new type of discovery.
"Knowledge starts by understanding that which you
don't know. That sounds corny enough," he laughs. "1
think it's true, though. You've got to be able to not be
afraid of making mistakes. No mistakes, no progress.
Being able to correct them is what's essential."
Science is a humanistic activity, Zare says."I believe

lampooning various chemistry professors.
that in part what actually makes me do science is that it's
an art form. I'm an artist. 1 create things and I show pretty
things, by so-called discoveries or experiments, to other
people."
However, Zare explains that "a lot of what I've been
doing is, in the last analysis, not original at all. It's all built
on everything that everyone else has done before. I mean,
what is it that's originality?
"What I try to do is take things that I've known and
merge them and meld them in new ways."
Such attempts appear to be highly successful for Zare,
who has made landmark discoveries and developments.
"He introduced the laser to chemistry," says Harris. "He
jumped fields (chemistry and physics) and that's really
hard to do. He uses lasers to delineate the specifics of
chemical reactions on a level of detail never before
touched."
Zare says he has a physics approach to understanding
the process of a chemical reaction. "If 1 can identify all the
variables before a collision (of molecules) — how much
energy they have, what direction they're moving in and
stuff like that — and if I can then measure all the variables
after collision, then I know everything there is to know
about what happened during the collision."
In order to do that, Zare cross-fires beams of
molecules. Sometimes they collide and sometimes they
even react, he says. The laser is used to look at this event.
"Lasers are our eyes, our detectors," he says. "We
shine laser light in (to the reaction chamber) and capture,
like the snapshot of a camera, the chemical reaction by

making the molecules light up or flouresce."
Zare is perhaps best known for this technique, called
laser-induced flourescence.
He has also developed a technique called laser
flourimetry that can follow a particular molecule through
a series of reactions. This procedure is a great improve
ment over the currently used procedure of tagging a
molecule with a radioactive isotope and has important bi
ological uses, according to John Frost, assistant professor
of chemistry.
The diversity found in Zare's research is also found in
the experiments being performed by his research group of
more than 20 graduate and post-doctoral students. The
projects range from bioanalytical chemistry to hard-core
physics, according to graduate student and group member
Bill Conaway. The theme that ties these together is "the
use of the laser to ask and answer some of the fundamen
tal questions in science," he says.
For his pioneering work, Zare has received numerous
awards and honors. In 1976, before he reached the
relatively young age of 40, he was elected a member of the
National Academy of Science. Just this year he was
awarded the National Medal of Science, the nation's high
est science award, and the prestigious Irving Langmuir
Prize in Chemical Physics by the American Physical Soci
ety.
Zare seems to take such recognition in stride. "I think it
means that we've been able to do things that matter to
other people and that other people can even use in their
own research. ... It pleases me to think that I've been
able to help other people that way.
"I really see the whole process (of acquiring knowl
edge) as a bunch of people standing on the shoulders of
other people, peering out. I like to contribute to that, to

see it building," he says.
The praise, although enjoyable, has little influence on
his science, according to Zare. "Artists want to be appre
ciated. too. but if no one likes their art, will they stop
painting?" he asks. "If no one bought their art. they
would stop at some point. And if no one (financially) sup
ported my research. I would stop at some point as well.
But if no one puts a high value on the art, you'd still do the
art. In your own self, you know you have to."
Zare says his "obsession" with the process of chemical
reactions was evident fairly early in his life. "I really want
to know about certain things. I'm curious about how
things happen in the world."
Graduated from Harvard with a double major in
chemistry and physics, Zare ventured to UC-Berkeley for
graduate studies. He later returned to Harvard, where he
received a doctorate in chemistry.
At the age of 29, he was offered a full professorship at
Columbia University in New York. Eight years ago, he
left Columbia for Stanford.
One of the things he particularly likes about Stanford is
that 'there are no artificial barriers between depart
ments. .. . Many, many other schools wall themselves off
into enclaves. And Stanford is free, much freer that
way. ... It allows all this cross-fertilization of ideas. ... I
often find that what's well known in one discipline is un
heard of to another, and by putting them together, you can
achieve something which no one ever thought of before.
That's worth something," Zare says.
Zare is not merely a fantastic scientist, say students and
colleagues. His work wins awards and praise, but it ap
pears to be his personal character that endears him to
those who know him.
"He wants to know what's going on with you as a per

son, not just what is coming out of your lab," says Rich
Blake, a graduate student in chemistry.
"Dick (Zare) is brilliant, but many people are brilliant.
What sets him head and shoulders above the great sea of
brilliance is that he's human," Frost says."He deals wit(i
people on a one-to-one basis. .. . He's incredibly accessi
ble and very easy to get along with.'"
Zare also possesses a "wild sense of humor," Brauman
says.
At the annual Chemistry Department Christmas party,
the students traditionally lampoon various faculty mem>
bers in skits and slide shows called "Chemwipes." Not
only has Zare often been the brunt of many jokes, he has
also been a willing participant, says Blake.
Several years ago in a spoof on Mutual of Omaha's
"Wild Kingdom," Zare went out in a dinghy in search of a
wild fish in the middle of a dry Lake Lagunita, relates
Conaway. The entire episode was shot for a "Chemwipes"
slide show.
Last year, Zare, costumed as a secret agent and
"playing" a guitar, posed in front of the Claw in White
Plaza and the Hoop in front of Green Library, says Blake.
This event was also staged and shot for the annual affair.
"He's not a person who lets his professorial dignity
stand in the way of his interactions with people, 1 '
Brauman says. "He's the kind of person you'd like to have
as a friend."
Although he has been deluged by nearly every award
available in his field and is personally highly regarded by
his colleagues and students, Zare's own assessment of
himself is quite modest. "1 wish I were a great intellect,"
he says. "I'm not. I really know there are smarter people.
I've met them and they're around this campus and some
of them are undergrads."

the students traditionally lampoon various faculty mem>
bers in skits and slide shows called "Chemwipes." Not
only has Zare often been the brunt of many jokes, he has
also been a willing participant, says Blake.
Several years ago in a spoof on Mutual of Omaha's
"Wild Kingdom," Zare went out in a dinghy in search of a
wild fish in the middle of a dry Lake Lagunita, relates
Conaway. The entire episode was shot for a "Chemwipes"
slide show.
Last year, Zare, costumed as a secret agent and
"playing" a guitar, posed in front of the Claw in White
Plaza and the Hoop in front of Green Library, says Blake.
This event was also staged and shot for the annual affair.
"He's not a person who lets his professorial dignity
stand in the way of his interactions with people, 1 '
Brauman says. "He's the kind of person you'd like to have
as a friend."
Although he has been deluged by nearly every award
available in his field and is personally highly regarded by
his colleagues and students, Zare's own assessment of
himself is quite modest. "1 wish I were a great intellect,"
he says. "I'm not. I really know there are smarter people.
I've met them and they're around this campus and some
of them are undergrads."
"I think that being a university professor is the ultimate
profession. I'm doing what I love with my science," says
chemist Richard Zare, who recently received the National
Medal of Science.
Zare, a Shell Distinguished Professor of Chemistry at
Stanford, says he enjoys the opportunity to teach as well
as conduct research. "I love teaching. I really get a big
kick out of it. ... I get a great feeling of excitement and
enthusiasm out of talking with people about things I'm in
terested in."
Zare has taught numerous courses, ranging from physi
cal chemistry for freshmen to advanced quantum mechan
ics for graduate students. "My favorite course is freshman
chemistry," he says. "What excited me so much about that
course is that that was the chance to interest people, to
say, 'Ah! I am interested in chemistry.'
"What good is teaching? Do you actually teach to trans
mit facts?" he asks. "I claim that books do much better at
transmitting facts. ... I think in teaching you're inspiring
people to read and learn the facts themselves and to dis
cuss it, to go on in the field. . . . What you're trying to do is
tell people why you find this so exciting and why they
should and how it fits into what they're thinking."
Zare's committment to teaching is evident in Chemistry
123, an introductory course for non-science majors that
fulfills the University's undergraduate science require
ment. "I'm really trying to get people to appreciate the
very complex technological world we live in, that they're
going to have to be involved with all their lives," he ex
plains.
"Have you heard the phrase that war is too important
to be left to the generals?" he asks. "I think science is too
important to be left only to the scientists. I think there are
non-scientists who will be making the decisions about
what type of society we will have. ... It is important that
people have an understanding of what's technically possi
ble and what's not technically possible.
"Also, it's a real pity to feel that you're not involved

with that part of the world that 'is technical or scientific.' I
think this understanding and involvement is a very impor
tant part of a full education. This is called a liberal arts
education."
Students and colleagues agree that Zare's enthusiasm is
evident when he teaches. "He is a very good teacher. He
always stayed after class to talk and answer your ques
tions," says Sarah Williams, a graduate student in
chemistry and a former TA for Zare.
"He's turned on, he's excited, he's committed. 1 think
that comes through in his teaching. He doesn't treat it as a
chore," says Chemistry Prof. John Brauman. The
Chemistry 123 course especially "has been a labor of love.
He really put his heart into it."
Steve Harris, professor of applied physics and electrical
engineering, calls Zare "a dynamic lecturer. ... I have
seen him literally put on comedy acts to illustrate his
lectures."
Zare says teaching benefits his research. "Teaching is
the secret weapon of academic researchers because it al
ways forces you to go back to basics and fundamen
tals. ... It forces you again to ask yourself questions."
Zare is especially adept at asking questions, says
Brauman. " He is open and receptive to crazy ideas and at
the same time he has a penetrating intellect that gets right
to the heart of the things."
Zare believes that "you need flexibility and nimbleness
of mind to put together all the data you gather. You start
by making up simple pictures or theories and you have to
dare to be different. That means you expose yourself.
That makes you very vulnerable. But you need that. If you
aren't different you can't make the new type of discovery.
"Knowledge starts by understanding that which you
don't know. That sounds corny enough," he laughs. "1
think it's true, though. You've got to be able to not be
afraid of making mistakes. No mistakes, no progress.
Being able to correct them is what's essential."
Science is a humanistic activity, Zare says."I believe

lampooning various chemistry professors.
that in part what actually makes me do science is that it's
an art form. I'm an artist. 1 create things and I show pretty
things, by so-called discoveries or experiments, to other
people."
However, Zare explains that "a lot of what I've been
doing is, in the last analysis, not original at all. It's all built
on everything that everyone else has done before. I mean,
what is it that's originality?
"What I try to do is take things that I've known and
merge them and meld them in new ways."
Such attempts appear to be highly successful for Zare,
who has made landmark discoveries and developments.
"He introduced the laser to chemistry," says Harris. "He
jumped fields (chemistry and physics) and that's really
hard to do. He uses lasers to delineate the specifics of
chemical reactions on a level of detail never before
touched."
Zare says he has a physics approach to understanding
the process of a chemical reaction. "If 1 can identify all the
variables before a collision (of molecules) — how much
energy they have, what direction they're moving in and
stuff like that — and if I can then measure all the variables
after collision, then I know everything there is to know
about what happened during the collision."
In order to do that, Zare cross-fires beams of
molecules. Sometimes they collide and sometimes they
even react, he says. The laser is used to look at this event.
"Lasers are our eyes, our detectors," he says. "We
shine laser light in (to the reaction chamber) and capture,
like the snapshot of a camera, the chemical reaction by

making the molecules light up or flouresce."
Zare is perhaps best known for this technique, called
laser-induced flourescence.
He has also developed a technique called laser
flourimetry that can follow a particular molecule through
a series of reactions. This procedure is a great improve
ment over the currently used procedure of tagging a
molecule with a radioactive isotope and has important bi
ological uses, according to John Frost, assistant professor
of chemistry.
The diversity found in Zare's research is also found in
the experiments being performed by his research group of
more than 20 graduate and post-doctoral students. The
projects range from bioanalytical chemistry to hard-core
physics, according to graduate student and group member
Bill Conaway. The theme that ties these together is "the
use of the laser to ask and answer some of the fundamen
tal questions in science," he says.
For his pioneering work, Zare has received numerous
awards and honors. In 1976, before he reached the
relatively young age of 40, he was elected a member of the
National Academy of Science. Just this year he was
awarded the National Medal of Science, the nation's high
est science award, and the prestigious Irving Langmuir
Prize in Chemical Physics by the American Physical Soci
ety.
Zare seems to take such recognition in stride. "I think it
means that we've been able to do things that matter to
other people and that other people can even use in their
own research. ... It pleases me to think that I've been
able to help other people that way.
"I really see the whole process (of acquiring knowl
edge) as a bunch of people standing on the shoulders of
other people, peering out. I like to contribute to that, to

see it building," he says.
The praise, although enjoyable, has little influence on
his science, according to Zare. "Artists want to be appre
ciated. too. but if no one likes their art, will they stop
painting?" he asks. "If no one bought their art. they
would stop at some point. And if no one (financially) sup
ported my research. I would stop at some point as well.
But if no one puts a high value on the art, you'd still do the
art. In your own self, you know you have to."
Zare says his "obsession" with the process of chemical
reactions was evident fairly early in his life. "I really want
to know about certain things. I'm curious about how
things happen in the world."
Graduated from Harvard with a double major in
chemistry and physics, Zare ventured to UC-Berkeley for
graduate studies. He later returned to Harvard, where he
received a doctorate in chemistry.
At the age of 29, he was offered a full professorship at
Columbia University in New York. Eight years ago, he
left Columbia for Stanford.
One of the things he particularly likes about Stanford is
that 'there are no artificial barriers between depart
ments. .. . Many, many other schools wall themselves off
into enclaves. And Stanford is free, much freer that
way. ... It allows all this cross-fertilization of ideas. ... I
often find that what's well known in one discipline is un
heard of to another, and by putting them together, you can
achieve something which no one ever thought of before.
That's worth something," Zare says.
Zare is not merely a fantastic scientist, say students and
colleagues. His work wins awards and praise, but it ap
pears to be his personal character that endears him to
those who know him.
"He wants to know what's going on with you as a per

son, not just what is coming out of your lab," says Rich
Blake, a graduate student in chemistry.
"Dick (Zare) is brilliant, but many people are brilliant.
What sets him head and shoulders above the great sea of
brilliance is that he's human," Frost says."He deals wit(i
people on a one-to-one basis. .. . He's incredibly accessi
ble and very easy to get along with.'"
Zare also possesses a "wild sense of humor," Brauman
says.

One of the things he particularly likes about Stanford is
that 'there are no artificial barriers between depart
ments. .. . Many, many other schools wall themselves off
into enclaves. And Stanford is free, much freer that
way. ... It allows all this cross-fertilization of ideas. ... I
often find that what's well known in one discipline is un
heard of to another, and by putting them together, you can
achieve something which no one ever thought of before.
That's worth something," Zare says.
Zare is not merely a fantastic scientist, say students and
colleagues. His work wins awards and praise, but it ap
pears to be his personal character that endears him to
those who know him.
"He wants to know what's going on with you as a per

son, not just what is coming out of your lab," says Rich
Blake, a graduate student in chemistry.
"Dick (Zare) is brilliant, but many people are brilliant.
What sets him head and shoulders above the great sea of
brilliance is that he's human," Frost says."He deals wit(i
people on a one-to-one basis. .. . He's incredibly accessi
ble and very easy to get along with.'"
Zare also possesses a "wild sense of humor," Brauman
says.
At the annual Chemistry Department Christmas party,
the students traditionally lampoon various faculty mem>
bers in skits and slide shows called "Chemwipes." Not
only has Zare often been the brunt of many jokes, he has
also been a willing participant, says Blake.
Several years ago in a spoof on Mutual of Omaha's
"Wild Kingdom," Zare went out in a dinghy in search of a
wild fish in the middle of a dry Lake Lagunita, relates
Conaway. The entire episode was shot for a "Chemwipes"
slide show.
Last year, Zare, costumed as a secret agent and
"playing" a guitar, posed in front of the Claw in White
Plaza and the Hoop in front of Green Library, says Blake.
This event was also staged and shot for the annual affair.
"He's not a person who lets his professorial dignity
stand in the way of his interactions with people, 1 '
Brauman says. "He's the kind of person you'd like to have
as a friend."
Although he has been deluged by nearly every award
available in his field and is personally highly regarded by
his colleagues and students, Zare's own assessment of
himself is quite modest. "1 wish I were a great intellect,"
he says. "I'm not. I really know there are smarter people.
I've met them and they're around this campus and some
of them are undergrads."
"I think that being a university professor is the ultimate
profession. I'm doing what I love with my science," says
chemist Richard Zare, who recently received the National
Medal of Science.
Zare, a Shell Distinguished Professor of Chemistry at
Stanford, says he enjoys the opportunity to teach as well
as conduct research. "I love teaching. I really get a big
kick out of it. ... I get a great feeling of excitement and
enthusiasm out of talking with people about things I'm in
terested in."
Zare has taught numerous courses, ranging from physi
cal chemistry for freshmen to advanced quantum mechan
ics for graduate students. "My favorite course is freshman
chemistry," he says. "What excited me so much about that
course is that that was the chance to interest people, to
say, 'Ah! I am interested in chemistry.'
"What good is teaching? Do you actually teach to trans
mit facts?" he asks. "I claim that books do much better at
transmitting facts. ... I think in teaching you're inspiring
people to read and learn the facts themselves and to dis
cuss it, to go on in the field. . . . What you're trying to do is
tell people why you find this so exciting and why they
should and how it fits into what they're thinking."
Zare's committment to teaching is evident in Chemistry
123, an introductory course for non-science majors that
fulfills the University's undergraduate science require
ment. "I'm really trying to get people to appreciate the
very complex technological world we live in, that they're
going to have to be involved with all their lives," he ex
plains.
"Have you heard the phrase that war is too important
to be left to the generals?" he asks. "I think science is too
important to be left only to the scientists. I think there are
non-scientists who will be making the decisions about
what type of society we will have. ... It is important that
people have an understanding of what's technically possi
ble and what's not technically possible.
"Also, it's a real pity to feel that you're not involved

with that part of the world that 'is technical or scientific.' I
think this understanding and involvement is a very impor
tant part of a full education. This is called a liberal arts
education."
Students and colleagues agree that Zare's enthusiasm is
evident when he teaches. "He is a very good teacher. He
always stayed after class to talk and answer your ques
tions," says Sarah Williams, a graduate student in
chemistry and a former TA for Zare.
"He's turned on, he's excited, he's committed. 1 think
that comes through in his teaching. He doesn't treat it as a
chore," says Chemistry Prof. John Brauman. The
Chemistry 123 course especially "has been a labor of love.
He really put his heart into it."
Steve Harris, professor of applied physics and electrical
engineering, calls Zare "a dynamic lecturer. ... I have
seen him literally put on comedy acts to illustrate his
lectures."
Zare says teaching benefits his research. "Teaching is
the secret weapon of academic researchers because it al
ways forces you to go back to basics and fundamen
tals. ... It forces you again to ask yourself questions."
Zare is especially adept at asking questions, says
Brauman. " He is open and receptive to crazy ideas and at
the same time he has a penetrating intellect that gets right
to the heart of the things."
Zare believes that "you need flexibility and nimbleness
of mind to put together all the data you gather. You start
by making up simple pictures or theories and you have to
dare to be different. That means you expose yourself.
That makes you very vulnerable. But you need that. If you
aren't different you can't make the new type of discovery.
"Knowledge starts by understanding that which you
don't know. That sounds corny enough," he laughs. "1
think it's true, though. You've got to be able to not be
afraid of making mistakes. No mistakes, no progress.
Being able to correct them is what's essential."
Science is a humanistic activity, Zare says."I believe

that in part what actually makes me do science is that it's
an art form. I'm an artist. 1 create things and I show pretty
things, by so-called discoveries or experiments, to other
people."
However, Zare explains that "a lot of what I've been
doing is, in the last analysis, not original at all. It's all built
on everything that everyone else has done before. I mean,
what is it that's originality?
"What I try to do is take things that I've known and
merge them and meld them in new ways."
Such attempts appear to be highly successful for Zare,
who has made landmark discoveries and developments.
"He introduced the laser to chemistry," says Harris. "He
jumped fields (chemistry and physics) and that's really
hard to do. He uses lasers to delineate the specifics of
chemical reactions on a level of detail never before
touched."
Zare says he has a physics approach to understanding
the process of a chemical reaction. "If 1 can identify all the
variables before a collision (of molecules) — how much
energy they have, what direction they're moving in and
stuff like that — and if I can then measure all the variables
after collision, then I know everything there is to know
about what happened during the collision."
In order to do that, Zare cross-fires beams of
molecules. Sometimes they collide and sometimes they
even react, he says. The laser is used to look at this event.
"Lasers are our eyes, our detectors," he says. "We
shine laser light in (to the reaction chamber) and capture,
like the snapshot of a camera, the chemical reaction by

making the molecules light up or flouresce."
Zare is perhaps best known for this technique, called
laser-induced flourescence.
He has also developed a technique called laser
flourimetry that can follow a particular molecule through
a series of reactions. This procedure is a great improve
ment over the currently used procedure of tagging a
molecule with a radioactive isotope and has important bi
ological uses, according to John Frost, assistant professor
of chemistry.
The diversity found in Zare's research is also found in
the experiments being performed by his research group of
more than 20 graduate and post-doctoral students. The
projects range from bioanalytical chemistry to hard-core
physics, according to graduate student and group member
Bill Conaway. The theme that ties these together is "the
use of the laser to ask and answer some of the fundamen
tal questions in science," he says.
For his pioneering work, Zare has received numerous
awards and honors. In 1976, before he reached the
relatively young age of 40, he was elected a member of the
National Academy of Science. Just this year he was
awarded the National Medal of Science, the nation's high
est science award, and the prestigious Irving Langmuir
Prize in Chemical Physics by the American Physical Soci
ety.
Zare seems to take such recognition in stride. "I think it
means that we've been able to do things that matter to
other people and that other people can even use in their
own research. ... It pleases me to think that I've been
able to help other people that way.
"I really see the whole process (of acquiring knowl
edge) as a bunch of people standing on the shoulders of
other people, peering out. I like to contribute to that, to

see it building," he says.
The praise, although enjoyable, has little influence on
his science, according to Zare. "Artists want to be appre
ciated. too. but if no one likes their art, will they stop
painting?" he asks. "If no one bought their art. they
would stop at some point. And if no one (financially) sup
ported my research. I would stop at some point as well.
But if no one puts a high value on the art, you'd still do the
art. In your own self, you know you have to."
Zare says his "obsession" with the process of chemical
reactions was evident fairly early in his life. "I really want
to know about certain things. I'm curious about how
things happen in the world."
Graduated from Harvard with a double major in
chemistry and physics, Zare ventured to UC-Berkeley for
graduate studies. He later returned to Harvard, where he
received a doctorate in chemistry.
At the age of 29, he was offered a full professorship at
Columbia University in New York. Eight years ago, he
left Columbia for Stanford.
One of the things he particularly likes about Stanford is
that 'there are no artificial barriers between depart
ments. .. . Many, many other schools wall themselves off
