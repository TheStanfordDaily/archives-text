## The
						Stanford Daily A
						not so funny joke 
### 
When a Feb. 24 Times Tribune article quoted a
Stanford student claiming that he receives $723
per quarter in financial aid but drives a BMW,
goes skiing every weekend and could "get along
fine" without the aid, journalistic credibility
dropped a substantial notch.
The blame for the outlandish article rightfully
lies with the person(s) who lied to Times Tribune
reporter Ruthann Richter. One of those students
is almost certainly Andrew Beyer, who, though
he denied telling Richter he was senior Huntley
Castner, has been accused of the act by the Uni
versity.
But University officials appear to consider the
incident trivial. Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said the University is taking no action
against Beyer. Asked whether Beyer's providing
false information constitutes a violation of the
fundamental standard — the University's official
code of conduct — Lyons said, "It certainly
doesn't meet all the tests of honorable, respec
table behavior." But he said that because nobody
has filed a complaint and Beyer has made the
proper apologies, the University considers the
matter closed.
What Beyer did undermines journalists' at
tempts to print the truth. Reporters and editors

trust an interviewee to give them accurate infor
mation. They can check only so many facts in a
given story; seldom do they have reason to doubt
the stated identity of an interviewee. Thus, it is
largely Beyer's fault that the Times Tribune
printed inaccurate information.
In addition to a drop in journalistic credibility,
the article may have other adverse effects: It may
hurt Castner, the University and even the finan
cial aid system itself.
Castner said the article protrays him as a "rich
jerk" and expressed concern that it might give
firms he is interviewing with a poor impression of
him. A university with students like the one
portrayed in the Times Tribune article looks bad
as well.
Finally, making light of financial aid at a time
that many programs are in a precarious position
is no laughing matter. In this respect, the article
does serious damage.
The University does not plan to punish Beyer,
and the Times Tribune at this point has no plans
to take action against him either. Beyer should be
held accountable for a grave injustice, however,
and the incident should not be glossed over with
out proper reproach.
