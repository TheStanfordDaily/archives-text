# The 						Big Bad Wolf and the three little big-wig pigs
## JAMES SHERMAN 
### 
Once upon a time there were three little
pigs.
The first pig, Eric Berg pig, was a kind
hearted chap, and a firm believer in the dem
ocratic system. He insisted that everything be
done exactly correctly, and did all that he
could to see that this be done. With this in
mind, Eric Berg pig built his house. He tried
to do things right, but instead everything
turned out wrong. The house that he built ini
tially appeared strong, but soon it began to
deteriorate. In no time, pieces were falling off
everywhere. But Eric Berg pig was not
dismayed. He knew that he had tried his best.
And so merrily he marched on to see how his
brother pigs were doing.
When he reached the home of his brother
pig, Konstantin Chernenko pig, Konstantin
was suntanning on his front porch, relaxing in
his wheelchair and sipping a tall, cold glass of
Stolichnaya vodka. Behind him stood two
houses; one a fortress of stone equipped with
all the latest in technology and large enough
to house the whole Politburo; the other house
was not completely finished.
"What a beautiful house!" the first pig
remarked. "How were you able to build such
a palace in so short a time?"
"I had the workers of my state build it,"
Konstantin replied. "They work quickly and,
best of all, free of charge."
"What a bargain!" Eric Berg pig
responded. "If only we could get them for the
Coffee House!"
As Eric's eyes shifted to the other, un
finished house, he questioned his brother as
to its purpose.

"I'm afraid the builders took ill," Konstan
tin replied. "But I sent them off to Siberia so
that they could recover quickly."
"How kind you are!" Eric commended.
And with that they happily took off to see
their third brother, and how he was doing.
Pig No. 3, Ronald Reagan pig, was working
hard when his two brothers arrived. His
house, a large white colonial, loomed spec-

tacularly over the horizon. On its base stood a
plaque which read, "This house is better off
now than it was four years ago." Still, Ronnie
struggled furiously to don his cowboy hat and
boots for his traditional morning horseback
ride.
"Why is it that you continuously work and
never leave any time for play?" his first
brother questioned.
"Why play among yourselves, when you
can play with the American public?" Ronnie
responded. "Besides," he added, "somebody
has to look out for the big bad wolf!"
"Oooh .. . the Big Bad Wolf!" his brother
mimicked as they darted off quickly, dancing

and laughing all the way. "Who's afraid of the
Big Bad Wolf?" they began singing as the sun
began to set and nighttime approached. But
Eric pig and Konstantin pig were enjoying
themselves too much to notice any distrac
tions as they frolicked joyously through the
meadows.
But then all of a sudden, from behind a big
fat tree appeared an ominous feature, the Big
Bad Wolf. When they first glimpsed the Wolf,
both pigs dashed off furiously. The Wolf in no
time was near full stride, and was within
inches of catching Eric pig when he entered
his house and slammed his door forcibly.
"Let me in," cried the wolf, as he gasped to
replenish the air he had expired in his chase.
"Not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin,"
Eric pig replied, as he fell to his knees and
began to pray.
"Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow
your house in," the wolf responded, and at
tempted to do just that with breath after
breath after breath. But no matter how hard
he tried, he could not make it budge.
And Eric Berg pig began to smell victory.
But then — just as the wolf was about to
throw in the towel — the COP came and let
the wolf in.
But Eric pig was no slouch — he escaped
through the back door. And the wolf did the
same as he chased him again.
This time, however, Eric pig outdistanced
the wolf easily (what do you expect with all
that huffing and puffing?) and arrived at
Konstantin's house quickly. Using his ability
to make a split-second decision, he decided to

hide out in the unfinished house — to throw
the wolf off.
And it did.
When the wolf finally arrived, he assumed
Eric pig had already informed Konstantin pig
of his imminent arrival, and decided that he
was going to have to resort to trickery to gain
entry into Konstantin's home.
After hours of contemplation, the wolf
dressed himself up in a bull's hide (because he

in Ronnie pig's house, afraid to even open the
door for fear of the Big Bad Wolf. And

knew Konstantin always liked a little bull)
and knocked gently at the front door.
Konstantin pig, however, was obedient to his
doctor's orders and did not leave his bed.
This angered the wolf immensely and again
he began to huff and puff, but again to no
avail. Finally, with nothing left to resort to,
the tired wolf decided to try the front door.
However, his excitement at finding it open
was so great that while swinging the door
open wide, he unlatched the brakes on
Konstantin pig's bed and propelled him out
the door.

Eric pig, fearing danger to his helpless
brother, hopped on the bed as it passed him
and guided it safely to the luxurious home of
their third brother.
The wolf again followed devotedly. Upon
reaching Ronnie pig's house, he was awe
struck with its complexity. Again, he
reasoned, he need devise a plan to attain
entry inside the house. Dressed as an Avon
lady, the wolf knocked politely on the door.

Ronnie pig, attempting to show off his acting
skills, blurted, "There's nobody here.'.' The
wolf, assuming that this silly comment must
have been an insult to his intelligence, was in
furiated once again. One more time, he con
templated his situation intensely. Moments
later, he stood up and walked away.
To this day, the three pigs remain cooped
up in Ronnie pig's house, afraid to even open
the door for fear of the Big Bad Wolf.
And everyone else lived happily ever after.
