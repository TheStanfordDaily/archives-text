# New Zealand's position on nuclear ships imperils ANZUS
## 
### 
The recent Stanford Daily condemnation of Reagan ad
ministration policy toward New Zealand's refusal to allow
docking privileges to U.S. nuclear-armed warships il
lustrates a naive interpretation of U.S. alliances (The
Daily, Feb. 28). The edit board stated, "If arguments can
be decided by morality and virtue rather than pragmatism.

VIEWPOINT

New Zealand's policy (not to admit nuclear weapons in
New Zealand) is commendable and correct." In fact, New
Zealand's policy is irrational and dangerous.
Given the hostile world we live in, public policy
founded only upon morality and virtue — however one
may define these — does not ensure security; pragmatism
or a realist approach does. Let us face facts. The United

States pays for New Zealand's defense by extending the
U.S. deterrent umbrella down under.
It is the U.S. taxpayer who subsidizes New Zealand's
defenses. Like all pacts negotiated after World War 11, the
United States expects and demands mutual commitment.
When New Zealand reneges upon its commitment, the
ANZUS treaty loses force and its continuation becomes
dubious.
I do not contest Prime Minister Lange's right to dis
tance his country from a superpower nuclear exchange by
refusing to accommodate the U.S. Pentagon. But he can
not have it two ways. hopes to enforce a U.S. com
mitment to defend New Zealand in times of crisis while, at
the same time, initiating his country's withdrawal of com
mitments to ANZUS. The two are incongruous. The West
European governments faced a similar dilemma prior to

the deployment of Pershing II and cruise missiles in
Europe. On the one hand, they wished to strengthen the
linkage between West European and U.S. defenses.
Helmut Schmidt correctly perceived a decline in Wash
ington's willingness to defend Western Europe, ever since
the advent of strategic parity between the superpowers.
By the mid 19705, no U.S. president could confidently say
he would risk New York for Bonn. The solution was the
installation of intermediate-range nuclear missiles to
defend Western Europe and to maintain coupling be
tween the United States and Europe.
On the other hand, many West Europeans wished to
prevent the deployment of those missiles which would
promote the U.S.-West European linkage. Eventually,
West European governments accepted the missiles,
strengthened NATO and displayed — long overdue —

allied harmony.
New Zealand, unfortunately, has taken steps to un
dermine the linkage between itself and the United States.
Washington's response to Lange should be measured and
moderate, without sanctions, hoping that some mutually
satisfactory arrangement can be agreed upon. Perhaps our
most prudent policy is simply to wait and see.
Hopefully, Lange's views will converge with those of
the West Europeans who, despite their legitimate interest
in complete independence, recognize and accept their mil
itary dependence upon the United States nuclear deter
rent. Our allies must cooperate with, not torpedo, U.S.
efforts to minimalize the Soviet threat. The United States
can accept nothing less.
