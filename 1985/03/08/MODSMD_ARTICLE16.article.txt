Super Bowl leftovers
Anybody still remember the Super
Bowl? It doesn't look like it, but it
looks as if other things have sunk
into oblivion too at Stanford, and by
"sunk"' I literally mean it.
The Super Bowl was a megabuck
event, wasn't it? And the University
got some money out of it. And re
member all those nice tents and huge
refrigerated food trucks and mobile
sanitary units, etc.? Quite a bit of
luxury there.
Some of these things were put up
on Angell Field, remember — and
one can still see it and feel it, right
under one's feet when running at the
track, and for almost two weeks after
the Super Bowl you could even smell
it before they eventually removed
the dump of garbage sacks; it was
obvious that there was something
rotten at Stanford.
Now there are only some bottle
tops left, the wooden rim around
the field and the outside of the track
is broken in many places, and
recently it has started to look as if
somebody had begun to fill in the
largest potholes and tire scars with
some kind of rubble.
It is all right that the big names in
sports get everything laid on nicely;
they are doing a great job and a
tough one. But I think it would only
be fair if we, the nobodies in sport
who do our workout for fitness or for
fun. got a little treat, too — or at
least do not have to suffer in the

aftermath of a big event.
Stanford basked in the limelight of
nationwide publicity for hosting big
sports and that's fine; but instead of
having a positive and stimulating
effect on everybody, this event has
left us with a facility that is positively
dangerous.
The state of the Angell Field track
is a disgrace and it literally looks like
a scar on the Stanford campus.

Pose for Playboy!
Why not pose for Playboy?
It's your own choice.
In fact, the only choice you have is
the first choice — whether to pose.
Playboy decides on the camera an
gle, they choose one picture from
several and they do what they want
with your picture because they own
it. And you don't get to choose
which men look at your pictures and
masturbate over them
Think of the money!
Then think how much you will
earn after you graduate. According
to a Playboy ad, more businessmen
read Playboy than Time, Newsweek
and U.S. News and World Report
together. Do you really want your
prospective employer to see you in a
magazine for "the entertainment of
men?"
You are beautiful.
This is your chance to show off
your beauty You are also smart.

talented and articulate. These
qualities got you into Stanford. A
Playboy photo is not a good way to
show off your intelligence. Why not
write for Playboy instead and earn
several thousand dollars?
It is easy for Playboy to laugh at a
protest of the pictorial by a small
group of feminists with pickets. But
wouldn't it be an elegant protest if
absolutely no one from Stanford
showed up?

Inappropriate pinup
Monday in my Physics 51 class.
Prof. Dick Bond raised a chalkboard
to reveal a nude pinup, beside which
were the words "harmonic motion"
and "oscillation." Prof. Bond obvi
ously thought it was a good joke —
he had been surprised by the picture
in his 9 a.m. class and thought it was
worth a repeat performance at 11
a.m.
When I stated in class that I was
offended and felt that the issue
should be addressed before the
lecture ended, I received a lot of
jeering and hostility from many men
in the class.
In my opinion, whether out of
ignorance, insensitivity or a poor
sense of humor. Bond acted inap
propriately. He should have removed
the picture when he first discovered
it. However, the response of my

classmates is equally disturbing.
The men who laughed at and
derided me this morning are the
same men who will not care when I
object to their pinup calendars in the
offices that we will share at work.
They are the same men whose fath
ers do not care when I object to the
use of a woman's body to sell
whatever they are peddling. They are
the same men who see no harm in
women being harassed at campus
parties.
Is it so difficult for a man to see
why a woman would object to the
display of a perfectly manicured doll
that is primed for mounting? A doll
that is painted, preened and posi
tioned to appeal to domineering
men? Can these men not see why I
must challenge them when they try
to reduce my existence as a woman
to that of a mindless toy whose only
purpose is to please them?
I hate that image — some man's
distorted version of what it is to be a
woman. A version of woman that lies
buried in make-up and mirrors and
photography touch-ups and beneath
the total negation of the strength and
beauty that is really in women.
I hear things are changing for
women. I cannot help but question,
how? How, if you will not listen to
me as a classmate? How, if you will
not listen to me as a co-worker?
How, if you will not listen to me as a
person who is hurt by what you do?
