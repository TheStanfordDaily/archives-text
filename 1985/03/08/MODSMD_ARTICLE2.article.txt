# Streleski remains embittered

### BAIE NETZER Senior staff writer 
Theodore Streleski, who is up for parole
today after having served six-and-one-half
years in prison for killing a Stanford math
ematics professor, reportedly said yester
day that he will use his notoriety to "bad
mouth" the University and its treatment of
graduate students.
Streleski, a former Stanford doctoral
candidate in mathematics, said last year,
when he first came up for parole, that he
was "absolutely noncommittal" on
whether he would return to campus to kill
again, but he apparently has backed down
from that threatening stance.
After an hour-long interview with
Streleski at the Vacaville State Medical
Facility, KGO-TV reporter Andy Good
man said last night that Streleski "fell short

of a denial" that he would kill again, but
implied that, "in terms of life and limb,"
Stanford faculty members are probably
safe.
Streleski, who is expected this morning
to refuse to sign papers granting him con
ditional freedom, said, however, that he
will use the notoriety he has gained to
point out Stanford's mistreatment of
graduate students, Goodman said.
"Very specifically, he said he is angry at
Stanford, that Stanford mistreats its
graduate students, and that he will use the
notoriety to 'bad-mouth' Stanford at every
opportunity," Goodman said.
Goodman said Streleski compared him
self favorably to math professors who
reacted without compassion when two
graduate students committed suicide here

in 1969. Streleski said his compassion
equalled or surpassed that of those profes
sors, Goodman said.
Goodman said Streleski still does not
regret killing Mathematics Prof. Karel
deLeeuw. "He basically draws a line be
tween remorse and regret," Goodman
said. Although Streleski told Goodman he
feels sorry that he killed deLeeuw, he said
he would do the same thing if he had it to
do over again. "He sort of said as a hypo
thetical situation that if he [were] faced
with similar circumstances, he may very
well commit the same act again," Good
man said.
Late last month, Streleski indicated he
will refuse to sign a parole agreement that
restricts his entering the Bay Area. Ac
cording to Les Johnson, spokesman for the
State Department of Corrections, Streleski

has not given any further indication of his
intention to refuse parole, but Johnson
said he believes Streleski has not changed
his mind.
The offer of a parole agreement was
originally scheduled for yesterday after
noon, but the Board of Prison Terms
decided to delay it until 9 a.m. today.
Johnson said there was no significance in
the delay.
"Sometimes they offer it the day before
release, sometimes they offer it the day
of," Johnson said. "It's no big deal either
way."
