## Loss to WSU leaves Card in cellar 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
, Stanford may not be the worst bas
ketball team in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence, but the Cardinal certainly
played like it last night.
. And after a 78-68 loss to eighth
place Washington State last night,
Stanford has the record to match.
The Cardinal dropped to 11-16
overall, 3-14 in the Pac-10, and
guaranteed itself at best a last-place
tie with California, which is 4-13 in
conference play. Unless Cal loses to
Washington State and Stanford up
sets Washington tomorrow, the Card
inal will have the Pac-10 basement to
itself.
"It's getting awfully long," said a
frustrated Andy Fischer, who fouled
out with 48 seconds left last night.
"We've got one more game to go, and
we'll give it our best shot."
Then it's over. Thank God for
small favors.
After a scintillating home victory
over league-leading USC two weeks
ago and two solid road performances
in Oregon last weekend, Stanford
reverted to mid-season form, when it
was in the throes of a six-game losing
streak.
'■ The Cardinal played an adequate
• first half, and even led 22-13 at the
.8:31 mark. Stanford would have even
]led at intermission had John
•! v Scooter" Williams not missed an un
contested five-footer at the halftime
I buzzer.
! Williams' miss was an omen of
; missed shots to come — lots of them —
■and Stanford played a second half
. with seemingly as many missed shots as
"there were no shows in the crowd of
•3,970 — the smallest for a Pac-10
laame in Maples Pavilion this season,
j. "There wasn't a problem with ef
• fort," Stanford Coach Tom Davis
isaid. "We just didn't make the
• shots."
As has been the case in nearly all
.'the Cardinal's losses, the key statistic
■ was shooting percentage, especially in
.'the second half. After outshooting
,the Cougars 48 to 44 percent in the
•first half, Stanford couldn't buy one
!in the second and shot 32 percent
■ (12-for-37). Washington State,
meanwhile, couldn't miss and hit 65
! percent (16-for-21).
\ "We weren't in bad shape (at
• halftime), but we just couldn't make a
]shot," Davis lamented. "And we had
so many easy shots. It was incredible.
! We need somebody that we can go to
'for a few quick buckets and we
haven't had that all ye#r."
. Washington State, which improved
to 13-14 overall and 5-12 in the Pac
-10, had more than its share of those
somebodies last night, as four
Cougars scored at least 13 points and
a fifth finished with nine. And it was
that double-figured foursome — Joe
Wallace (23 points), Keith Morrison
(14), Brian Quinnett (14) and Otis
Jennings (13) — that blew the game
open midway through the second
half.
After Cardinal forward Earl
Koberlein hit a 17-foot jumper to cut
Washington State's lead to 50-48
" with 12:17 remaining, each of those
« four Cougars scored a basket over the
! next three minutes to turn a two

point game into an 11-point one, 59-
48.
Jennings started the nine-point run
with a three-point play with 12:04
left. Just over a minute later, Mor
rison banked in a five-footer, and
then Quinnett, who hit all 14 of his
points from long range, pumped one
in from the right corner.
Davis called a time-out to calm his
team down, hut it was to no avail. On
the very next trip down court, Novian
Whitsitt lost the ball, Washington
State picked it up and Wallace made
the breakaway layup at the other end.
Fischer finally ended the Cardinal
scoring drought at the 8:49 mark with
a free throw, but Quinnett hit another
bomb from the right corner and the
Cougars had their biggest lead of the
evening, 61-49.
Stanford did manage to narrow it
to six at 72-66. However, that was
with 26 seconds left and the game
well in the Cougars' control.
"We got into foul trouble early (in
the second half), and it was a situa
tion where we had to go into a 2-3
zone," Washington State Coach Len
Stevens said. "That changed the
tempo of the game. It slowed their of
fense down, and we were fine once
we did that."
The Cougars we able to stay in the
game in the first half not because of a
zone, but because of the play of All-
Pac-10 point guard Keith Morrison.
The 6-foot-3 Morrison, who leads the
team in rebounding, pulled down
seven of his game-high nine boards
and scored 12 of his 14 points in the
first half.
"There's no way we should have
been ahead after the first half,"
Stevens said. "But Morrison erased
the mistakes we were making, and we
would have been behind if it hadn't
been for him."
Davis also passed out the plaudits
to Morrison, the only player from the
Pac-10's bottom four teams to be se
lected to the all-league squad.

The Cardinal dropped to 11-16
overall, 3-14 in the Pac-10, and
guaranteed itself at best a last-place
tie with California, which is 4-13 in
conference play. Unless Cal loses to
Washington State and Stanford up
sets Washington tomorrow, the Card
inal will have the Pac-10 basement to
itself.
"It's getting awfully long," said a
frustrated Andy Fischer, who fouled
out with 48 seconds left last night.
"We've got one more game to go, and
we'll give it our best shot."
Then it's over. Thank God for
small favors.
After a scintillating home victory
over league-leading USC two weeks
ago and two solid road performances
in Oregon last weekend, Stanford
reverted to mid-season form, when it
was in the throes of a six-game losing
streak.
'■ The Cardinal played an adequate
• first half, and even led 22-13 at the
.8:31 mark. Stanford would have even
]led at intermission had John
•! v Scooter" Williams not missed an un
contested five-footer at the halftime
I buzzer.
! Williams' miss was an omen of
; missed shots to come — lots of them —
■and Stanford played a second half
. with seemingly as many missed shots as
"there were no shows in the crowd of
•3,970 — the smallest for a Pac-10
laame in Maples Pavilion this season,
j. "There wasn't a problem with ef
• fort," Stanford Coach Tom Davis
isaid. "We just didn't make the
• shots."
As has been the case in nearly all
.'the Cardinal's losses, the key statistic
■ was shooting percentage, especially in
.'the second half. After outshooting
,the Cougars 48 to 44 percent in the
•first half, Stanford couldn't buy one
!in the second and shot 32 percent
■ (12-for-37). Washington State,
meanwhile, couldn't miss and hit 65
! percent (16-for-21).
\ "We weren't in bad shape (at
• halftime), but we just couldn't make a
]shot," Davis lamented. "And we had
so many easy shots. It was incredible.
! We need somebody that we can go to
'for a few quick buckets and we
haven't had that all ye#r."
. Washington State, which improved
to 13-14 overall and 5-12 in the Pac
-10, had more than its share of those
somebodies last night, as four
Cougars scored at least 13 points and
a fifth finished with nine. And it was
that double-figured foursome — Joe
Wallace (23 points), Keith Morrison
(14), Brian Quinnett (14) and Otis
Jennings (13) — that blew the game
open midway through the second
half.
After Cardinal forward Earl
Koberlein hit a 17-foot jumper to cut
Washington State's lead to 50-48
" with 12:17 remaining, each of those
« four Cougars scored a basket over the
! next three minutes to turn a two

point game into an 11-point one, 59-
48.
Jennings started the nine-point run
with a three-point play with 12:04
left. Just over a minute later, Mor
rison banked in a five-footer, and
then Quinnett, who hit all 14 of his
points from long range, pumped one
in from the right corner.
Davis called a time-out to calm his
team down, hut it was to no avail. On
the very next trip down court, Novian
Whitsitt lost the ball, Washington
State picked it up and Wallace made
the breakaway layup at the other end.
Fischer finally ended the Cardinal
scoring drought at the 8:49 mark with
a free throw, but Quinnett hit another
bomb from the right corner and the
Cougars had their biggest lead of the
evening, 61-49.
Stanford did manage to narrow it
to six at 72-66. However, that was
with 26 seconds left and the game
well in the Cougars' control.
"We got into foul trouble early (in
the second half), and it was a situa
tion where we had to go into a 2-3
zone," Washington State Coach Len
Stevens said. "That changed the
tempo of the game. It slowed their of
fense down, and we were fine once
we did that."
The Cougars we able to stay in the
game in the first half not because of a
zone, but because of the play of All-
Pac-10 point guard Keith Morrison.
The 6-foot-3 Morrison, who leads the
team in rebounding, pulled down
seven of his game-high nine boards
and scored 12 of his 14 points in the
first half.
"There's no way we should have
been ahead after the first half,"
Stevens said. "But Morrison erased
the mistakes we were making, and we
would have been behind if it hadn't
been for him."
Davis also passed out the plaudits
to Morrison, the only player from the
Pac-10's bottom four teams to be se
lected to the all-league squad.
