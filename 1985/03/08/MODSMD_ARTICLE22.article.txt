# Tomorrow is finale for UW's Harshman
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
Washington Basketball Coach
Marv Harshman, the nation's win
ningest active Division I coach, will
make his final regular-season appear
ance tomorr >v when his Huskies visit
Stanford at 1 p.m. in Maples Pavilion.
But if Stanford beats Washington,
Harshman's final season could end on
a very sour note. No, Washington's
season isn't over tomorrow. At 21-9
overall and 12-5 in the Pacific 10
Conference, the Huskies will play in
someone's post-season tournament.
It just might not be the NCAA's.
After a trip to the NCAA tourna
ment last season, this year's team —
the retiring Harshman's last — has
been gearing up for a return engage
ment. With four starters and most of
the bench returning, who would have
thought the Huskies would even be in
a battle for the Pac-10 crown heading
into the final game of the season?
Everyone thought they would have
had their second-straight title
clinched by now.
Harshman, 67, has found out the
hard way that without a solid point
guard, stock in the biggest, strongest
and quickest of front lines goes down.
Washington has the center — 7-foot
Christian Welp — and it has the for
wards — 6-9 dribbling and shooting
Detlef Schrempf and 6-9 Paul For
tier.
It doesn't have the point guard.
Still, after falling from top-five
ratings, Washington is in the Pac-10
hunt. A 41-38 victory over California
last night kept it one game behind
first-place USC. And a win in tomor
row's game, which will be televised
live by NBC, could virtually assure it
an NCAA tournament bid when the
bids are handed out Sunday after
noon.

A loss, and Harshman and his
Huskies sweat it out next to the
phone Sunday.
Knocking a team out of the
NCAAs by beating it in the last
game of the regular season is nothing
new to Stanford in recent years. The
Cardinal did it almost two years ago
to the day, when it routed Oregon
State 88-75 in both teams' regular
season finale. Oregon State played
again that season, but it was in the
National Invitational Tournament,
where the Huskies could be headed if
they lose tomorrow.
One doesn't have to look far back
to find the last time Stanford beat
Washington at Maples Pavilion,
either. The Cardinal did that last
season, defeating the Huskies 78-74
and ruining their 7-0 Pac-10 start.
Years from now, the winner of to
morrow's game probably will be for
gotten. Harshman, however, won't
be.
In Harshman's 27-year tenure in
the Pac-10 (13 at Washington State
and 14 at Washington), he has seen
39 different coaches come and go,
and has seen the league change its
name twice. When he arrived at
Washington State in 1959, the league
was the Pacific Coast Conference.
Then it became the Pacific 8 Confer
ence before adding the two Arizona
schools and its present name.
Harshman has 641 career victories,
making him the seventh all-time win
ningest Division I coach. Ahead of
him on the list are names like Adolph
Rupp (Kentucky), Ray Meyer (De
Paul) and John Wooden (UCLA).
"I suppose I'm trying to win, but
that isn't all," Harshman has said
about his final season. "I'm hoping to
get the guys to play as close to poten
tial as possible, as a team. If they do
that, we are going to win."
