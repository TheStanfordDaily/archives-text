# USC clinches title tie with win
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
When the dust settled after last night's four Pacific 10
Conference basketball games, about the only thing that
was settled was, well, dust.
The Pac-10 title remained undecided, although the field
of five that entered last night's play still with a chance at
least to tie for it was narrowed to two. However, a four
way tie for second is a distinct possibility on the eve of the
season's final day of play.
USC remained in first place with a 65-62 victory over
Oregon at the Los Angeles Sports Arena. The win upped
the Trojans' league record to 13-5 and assured them at
least a share of the Pac-10 crown. Washington's 41-38
victory over California, coupled with UCLA's 59-51 tri
umph over Oregon State, left the Huskies alone in second
place at 12-5, making them the only team with a chance of
catching USC.
In the event of a tie, Washington would receive the con
ference's sole automatic bid to the NCAA tournament on
the basis of the Pac-10's tie-breaking system.
Because Washington and USC split their two regular
season games, it would go to the second tiebreaker — the
teams' overall record within the continental United

States. If Washington wins and USC loses tomorrow, the
Huskies would finish 20-8 on the continent and the
Trojans 19-9.
As for Oregon State, Arizona and UCLA — all 11-6
and two games off the pace — the best they can hope for is
some sort of logjam in second place. And if Stanford beats
Washington, Oregon State beats USC, Arizona beats
Arizona State, and UCLA beats Oregon, USC would take
first at 13-5 and the other four teams would tie for second
at 12-6.
In other conference news yesterday, the league named
the nine-man All-Pac-10 team, selected by its coaches.
USC forward Wayne Carlander, who was named Pac-10
Player of the Year Wednesday, headed a squad that
featured three unanimous selections.
Joining Carlander as unanimous picks were forwards
A.C. Green of Oregon State, last season's Player of the
Year, and Detlef Schrempf of Washington.
Filling out the squad were centers Blair Rasmussen of
Oregon, Pete Williams of Arizona and Christian Welp of
Washington; forward Eddie Smith of Arizona; and guards
Nigel Miguel of UCLA and Keith Morrison of Washing
ton State.
