## Card battles for Six-Pac lead at UCLA 
### TOM SENF Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford baseball team travels
to Los Angeles this weekend to battle
UCLA for the early season lead in
the Pacific 10 Southern Division.
The Cardinal has a 3-0 Si\-Pac
record. 15-4 overall, but it still trails
the 5-1 Bruins by one half-game.
UCLA is 16-6-1 overall.
In the latest ESPN/Collegiate
Baseball poll, Stanford is ranked sixth
with UCLA right behind at No. 7.
The Cardinal's current success has
come as a surprise to no one. Stan
ford has been in the top 10 all season.
However, the Bruins' fast start has
shocked everyone, including Coach
Gary Adams.
"Gloomy. Real gloomy," was how
Adams described his team's
preseason outlook. UCLA was com
ing off a miserable 8-22 conference
season — bad enough for last place in
the Six-Pac. Worse, the Bruins were
hurt by graduation. "The heart of our
team was gone," Adams said.
In particular, UCLA was without
the services of Olympic outfielder
Shane Mack and All Pac-10 infielder
Pete Beall.
Adams has no such stars this year.
"We've had a different hero every
game," he said. "We have great
depth, and the team has blended
well."
The Bruin coach has no secret
strategy in store for the Cardinal.
"We'll have to do what we've been
doing," Adams said. "We need the
timely hit, the timely pitching and the
timely defensive play.
"We don't blow people out," he
said. "To beat a team like Stanford,
we'll have to come through in the
clutch."
Playing at home will be a distinct
advantage for UCLA. The Bruins are
12-0-1 at Jackie Robinson Stadium.
Adams suggested that a change of
scenery may be responsible for his

team's home-field success.
"We've switched our dugout from
the first-base side to the third-base
side. Maybe that's it,"he said.
Last weekend at Stanford,
managers were coming out of dugouts
from both sides, usually to replace
pitchers. In the Cardinal's three
games with Arizona State, there were
52 runs and 83 hits.
Stanford Coach Mark Marquess
was at a loss to explain the batters'
dominance. "1 hope it was good hit
ting, not weak pitching," he said.
"But we'll find out next week."

Marquess doesn't think this
weekend's series is more important
than any other. "They're all big," he
said. "Everyone is just as capable of
beating you. Just when you think
you've got it figured out, something
happens you didn't expect. Look at
what happened (last week). Arizona
was rolling, but then UCLA beats
them three straight."
Today and tomorrow, Stanford
will start its usual tandem of Rob
Wassenaar and Jeff Ballard. In Sun
day's game. Marquess will go with
either Kevin Kunkel or Jack

McDowell. Kunkel and McDowell
are competing for the final starting
slot.
UCLA's scheduled starters are
Eric Nolte, Dana Ridenour and Alex
Sanchez. Sanchez has been the ace of
the staff so far this year. He has a 3-1
record and a 2.57 ERA with 39
strikeouts in 35 innings. However, he
is questionable for this weekend be
cause of a tender elbow.
The Cardinal will take next week
off, but will be back in action next
weekend with a three-game series
against USC at Sunken Diamond.
