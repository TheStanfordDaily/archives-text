## 
### INGRID SEYER Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford men's swimming team didn't
take long to start leading the pack yesterday as
it jumped out to an early lead in the Pacific 10
Conference Championships being held in
Tualitin Hills, Ore., through tomorrow.
The Cardinal racked up 169 points during
the first day of competition, followed by USC
with 145 points, California with 132, UCLA
with 126.5, Arizona State with 94, Arizona
with 73.5, Washington with 28 and Oregon
with 26.
Stanford, currently ranked No. 1 nation
ally, won two of yesterday's four events,
placed second in another, and placed swim
mers in every event.
The Cardinal went one-two in the 200-yard

individual medley with John Moffet (1:48.14)
and Dave Bottom (1:48.89). Pablo Morales
(1:49.40) placed seventh in the event, fol
lowed by David Lundberg (1:49.7) in eighth.
All four of the swimmers met the NCAA cut
off time (1:50.56) in the event.
Stanford's 400 medley relay team was also
victorious last night, winning the event with a
time of 3:12.93. The team of Bottom, Moffet,
Morales and Dave Louden beat its previous
national best time of 3:18.17 by more than
five seconds.
In the 500 freestyle, Stanford's Louden
qualified for the NCAAs with an eighth-place
time of 4:22.28. Mike O'Brien (4:16.34) of
USC won the event, followed by teammate
Allan Alarab (4:19.83).
No Stanford swimmers finished in the top

six of the 50 freestyle, which was won by
UCLA's Tom Jager in a time of 19.86.
Stanford Swimming Coach Skip Kenney is
very confident about the team's stroke events
and therefore is expecting to score well both
today and tomorrow.
"One of our team's top advantages is that
we have several quality swimmers in all of our
stroke events and can therefore count on
placing more than one swimmer in the top
places," Kenney said.
The finals for the 100 butterfly,
breaststroke and backstroke events, the 200
freestyle, the 400 individual medley and the
400 freestyle will be held today.
Morales is the defending Pac-10 champion
in the 100 butterfly, as is Kostoff in the 400
IM and Bottom in the 100 backstroke.
