### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
After two matches on the road
last weekend, the Stanford
women's tennis team is back on it
today and tomorrow.
The No. 1-ranked Cardinal will
put its 10-0 overall record, 3-0
WCAA record and 36-match win
ning steak on the line against
lOth-ranked Arizona today and
'inranked Arizona State tomor
row.
And although Stanford has
played and defeated two teams
ranked higher than Arizona —
seventh-ranked San Diego State
7-2 and ninth-ranked California
7-0 — Coach Frank Brennan has
every reason to believe that this
afternoon's match may be the
Cardinal's toughest yet.
"Arizona is really the surprise

team of the year," Brennan said.
"They've beat San Diego State,
Pepperdine and Cal. So they're
going to be interesting. And we
have to play them down there,
where they've always given us
trouble."
Arizona is led by Jill Smoller,
who at No. 15 is the Wildcats' only
singles player ranked in the top 50
nationally. Smoller is also ranked
19th in doubles. The only other
ranked netter the Cardinal will
face is Arizona State's Sherri Nor
ris, who is 14th in singles.
After the Arizona schools, Stan
ford returns home to face Long
Beach State Monday at 1:30 p.m.
Then the Cardinal takes a two
week exam break before returning
to action March 25, when it hosts
Harvard.
