# Men host UNM if there's no rain
## 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
When Coach Dick Gould said he
would like to wind down preseason
play this week, he got more than he
wished for. Two Stanford men's ten
nis team matches have been canceled
due to rain, with one left today
against New Mexico.
The Cardinal planned to play San
Jose State on Tuesday and Foothill
College — the No. 1-ranked junior
college team in the nation — on Wed
nesday. Rain prevented both
matches.
Today's home match is the last
Stanford will play before spring
break. New Mexico is 9-7 overall and
1-1 in Western Athletic Conference
competition, having defeated San
Diego State 7-2 for the one league
win thus far.
Three players for New Mexico —
Tim Cass, Galen Garcia and Steve
Otero — have been switching among
the three top singles positions in the
last couple of matches.
Apparently most of New Mexico's
seven losses of the season are due to
unsuccessful doubles-team arrange
ments. Several recent changes have
been made, however, and in the last
four matches. New Mexico's top two
doubles teams have gone 3-1 in their
matches.

The three newly found and success
ful doubles teams are those of Cass
and Garcia at No. 1, Steve Bickham
and Otero at No. 2 and Jack Griffin
and Jerry Gunther playing in the No.
3 spot.
Gunther and Griffin have been
playing with each other for most of
the season, and have an 8-2 overall
record.
Gould said he would like to play a
full lineup in this last match before
finals, and "get his team playing to
gether again."
He is not implying, however, that
Stanford, as the No. 1-ranked team in
the country, needs to get its playing
together. The Cardinal has had a pro
ductive preseason, winning the ITCA
National Team Indoor Championship
in early February along with Dan
Goldie's ITCA Individual Indoor
Championship title.
Don't forget Stanford's No. 1 finish
in the Northern California Intercol
legiates, either, followed by Grabb
and Letts' Pacific Coast Doubles
Championship win over teammates
Pat McEnroe and Derrick Rostagno
on March 3.
It would be difficult, in fact, to do
better than the Cardinal has done up
to this point, and there's still a whole
season of matches left to play.
