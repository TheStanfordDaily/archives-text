## Gates: an unassuming leader 
### BETH KLEID Senior sportswriter 
As far as Head Coach Frank Bren
nan is concerned, team captain Linda
Gates is in the "driver's seat" on the
Stanford women's tennis team.
"As a leader, Linda is doing all the
things she is supposed to do. She's
handling it exceptionally well, "
Brennan said. "She's the type of
player who has all those intangibles.
Besides being a great player, she is
the kind of player that everyone
wants to be around."
It seems that Gates, the only senior
on the team, is a natural leader, but
she is practically unaware of it.
"I've never been in the position of
having to be a leader," Gates said. "I
just felt that I was a team member,
until sometime last quarter. Then I
felt as if there was some responsibility
on me."
Now that Gates is fully aware of
her position, she doesn't give herself
enough credit for it."I like to think
that they (her teammates) look up to
me," she said in her typical unassum
ing way.
And what a role model she is.
Gates has accomplished just about
everything that a collegiate tennis
player could dream of accomplishing.
She is a three-time All-American, has
been a member of two undefeated
NCAA Championship teams (in
1982 and 1983), won the NCAA
doubles title last year with Elise Bur
gin and was runner-up in the individ
ual singles competition.
The list goes on. Last summer she
won three tournaments in the Pro
Satellite Circuit. And she was
honored with the 1984 Arthur Ashe
Sportsmanship Award.
Gates' array of achievements was
quite unexpected.
She was not heavily rccruited com
ing out of Hillsborough. "I almost
didn't give her a scholarship," said
Brennan. "She was almost a walk
on."
Once she came to the Farm, Gates
proved that her scholarship was well
deserved. She started out playing No.
4 for the Cardinal and was named to
the All-America team her first year.
From then on, her tennis career has
gone nowhere but up.
Gates underestimates herself when
she talks about her growth as a
player. "Frank (Brennan) says there
have been some improvements," she
said.
Brennan says it a little more
strongly: "Linda has improved more
than anyone I've ever had here."
Gates admits that specific things in
her game have improved. She said

that she used to be much more
"erratic."
"I had good groundstrokes, but
now they are much better," she said.
"I guess everything has gotten bet
ter." She calls herself a "power
player" whose serve is her strong
point. Eventually, she wants to per
fect her serve-and-volley game.
Gates' natural athletic ability,
combined with persistence, has
allowed her to come this far. "I
worked pretty hard — I can pick
things up pretty easily, but I have to
work at them to gain confidence.
"Confidence is really important to
me," she said. "Now I feel pretty
confident, but it still has its ups and
downs."
The senior recalls that last year her
confidence helped to get her to the
finals of the NCAAs.
"At first, I was kind of freaking
out, but then I started playing better
and better each day — and getting
more and more confident. Everything
just came together," she said.
Gates notes that her performance
at last year's NCAAs surprised some
people. "I think people were saving
to themselves, 'Linda Gates is capa
ble of doing well here,' but they never
thought I could really do it."
Gates said that this year's relatively
young team is as good as last year's
squad — "better than last year" —
and if it stays healthy, it has
a good chance at a command NCAA
performance.
The senior is having fun with her
team during her last year as a Card
inal. In fact, having fun was one of the
reasons Gates starting playing tennis
in the first place.
"I had a coach who always made it
fun. We would win Cokes for doing
certain things."
Gates began her tennis career be
cause her older brother was involved
in the sport. "When I was 14 I would
go along with my mom to watch him
play tournaments, and then I just
started playing in them.
"At 14 I could get away with not
practicing just because of iny athletic
ability, but after a while it caught up
with me. I had to decide if I wanted
tennis only, or if I wanted to be
average at all sports," she said.
"Well, I chose to toss all the other
sports out the window.
She does not regret that choice, but
sometimes tennis is not always as
"fun" as it used to be for Gates. "For
example, a couple of months ago I
was very unmotivated. It's hard be
cause you want to take time off, yet
you feel pressure to practice because
others are. And if you don't practice,

others will pass you."
The way that Gates fights a bout of
"unmotivation" is by "trying to get
new ideas from different people on
tennis." She said, "It helps to do
something to expand my game so I'm

not doing the same old thing, it makes
it more fun." The last time she felt
burned out, she worked on her vol
leys.

Linda Gates, the only senior on the Stanford women's tennis team, won
last year's NCAA doubles championship with Elise Burgin and was
runner-up in the singles.
Gates said that tennis has enhanced
her life. "I've met so many people.
Going to different parts of the
country, and different parts of the
world, has opened up my mind," she
said.
Gates will continue to travel when
she turns pro after this year's
NCAAs. She is planning to play Pro
Satellite Circuit tournaments in Japan
and Australia. "They'll give me a
chance to move my way up."
Gates said that she would "love to
go to Wimbledon next year," as well
as "make some money."
"One side of me shies away from
the fame and glory part of tennis, but
it's all part of the dream," she said.
"In the dream, fame and glory go
along with being good."
The political science major said
that after she is ready to leave the pro
circuit, she wants to work for the gov
ernment in Washington.
Gates is at the point where her
dreams and plans for the future are
soon-to-be realities. "It's kind of
strange. I've always had these goals.
People were always asking, 'Are you
gonna turn pro?' and I would say yes,
but I never really thought it would
happen.
"It's strange that things seem to be
going as planned — It would be great
if they kept going that way." She does
feel a little sad about leaving Stanford
tennis, but "it's time to go on, and I'm
excited about it."
