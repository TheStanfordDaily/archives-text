## Anderson frosh All- America pick 
### JOHN LIS Editorial staff 
Though the Stanford women's bas
ketball team has not enjoyed the best
of seasons, carrying a 9-17 record
into this weekend's games at San
Diego State and USC, the Cardinal
received a boost yesterday when for
ward Kami Anderson was named
first-team Freshman All-American
by the Women's Basketball News
Service.
"Oh my gosh, I didn't expect it in a
million years," Anderson said. "It
was totally a surprise.
"I was very stunned."
"I think it's well deserved," Coach
Dotty McCrea said. "I really do think
she's one of the best freshmen
players."
Anderson, a 6-foot-1 native of
Valley City, N.D., is averaging 14.5
points per game so far this year to
lead the Cardinal. She also leads
Stanford in field-goal percentage (48
percent), free-throw percentage (78
percent) and minutes played (933).
Anderson was the only player from
the West on the 10-player first team.
San Diego State guard Penny Toler
was a second-team selection — the
only other Western Collegiate Ath
letic Association player honored.
"It's a goal that I've wanted to
reach, being an All-American," An
derson said, "but I want to keep im
proving, to reach my peak. Today, I
was thinking of what I wanted to
work on this summer — like
penetrating and going to the basket."
"Teams in the conference have
been trying to stop her," McCrea
said. "I think people see the impact
she has on our team and that we've
improved."
Anderson's high game this season
was a 30-point effort in an 81-77 win
at Pacific. She has scored 20 points or
more in seven games, and is averag
ing 5.7 rebounds a game.
The Cardinal will be looking for

the same kind of performance this
weekend, as it hopes to end the
season on a winning note against two
top-20 teams — No. 15-ranked San
Diego State tonight and No. 11 USC
Sunday.
The games will be the last in a
Stanford uniform for forward Mary
Bradach, the team's only senior.
The Aztecs have last year's WCAA
scoring leader, Tina Hutchinson, on
the roster, but a knee injury has kept
her out of action for much of this
campaign. She averaged 29.3 points
per game in 1983-84.
The burden has fallen on Toler,
and she has responded by averaging
15.9 points per game, including 30
points against Stanford in a 73-59
Aztec win at Maples Pavilion a month
ago.
"We don't know whether Hutchin
son will play," McCrca said. "We've
heard about four different reports.
It's kind of hazy."
San Diego State is fourth in the
WCAA, with an 8-5 mark, and 19-8
overall. Stanford is 2-10 in the confer
ence in a tie for sixth. The Aztecs
have a tough road to the NCAA
tournament, though, as only three
teams from the WCAA have gone to
the tournament in past years.
USC will likely be one of those
teams. Though the two-time defend
ing champions were all but eliminated
from the WCAA race when they lost
to conference-leader Long Beach
State, they aie in second place with a
9-3 league mark.
The Trojans, 19-7 overall before
last night's game against third-place
UCLA, feature Olympian Cheryl
Miller, arguably the finest woman
ever to play the game. Miller is
averaging 27.1 points and 16.6
rebounds an outing.
She scored 36 and pulled down 22
boards in USC's 80-68 victory against
the Cardinal at Maples two weeks
ago.
