# Fencers off to regionals

### ERIK ESELIUS Staff sportswriter 
Riding the wake of an impressive 14-2 season, the
eighth-ranked Stanford men s fencing team will try to
successfully defend last year's title this weekend at the
Western Regionals. The tournament will be held at
Long Beach State.
In the meet's round-robin format, the team with the
best overall record after seven dual matches wins the
team championship. However, regardless of team per
formance, only the top four individuals in the saber
and foil and top three in epee go on to the NCAAs.
Last year, despite winning the team championship,
Stanford did not qualify anyone for the NCAAs.
Based on the final regular-season standings and
overall technical ability. Stanford, San Jose State and
Air Force should be the top three teams vying for the
championship.
Hurst considers Air Force "the dark horse" of the
tournament, a team that fences on "75 percent enthus
iasm" and is "always very strong by the start of the
regionals." In the only regular-season meeting be
tween the two schools, Stanford came away with a 18-9
decision.
The Cardinal split its two dual matches with San Jose
State, the only West Coast team to have defeated the
Cardinal this year. Nevertheless, Hurst saw the 14-13
loss as a "fluke," attributable to the Spartan's very en
thusiastic and somewhat intimidating home crowd.
"On paper, 1 think we're the stronger technical
team. This time they (San Jose State) won't have the
home-crowd advantage. . . . Stanford has to be consid
ered the favorite to win."
Hurst quickly qualified that prediction, however.
"I've been proved wrong before," he said.
Hurst also feels positive about the chances of the saber
and epee teams winning their respective events. The
loss of third-seeded Russel Hulstondue to an injury
may put a damper on the foil team's first-place aspira
tions, placing a lot of pressure on Chris McConnell and
Elliott Cheu.
The maximum number of fencers a team may qualify
for the NCAAs is six, a goal which the Cardinal has
a "reasonably good shot of obtaining," added Hurst,
who viewed last year's disappointment at non
qualifying as quite atypical.
