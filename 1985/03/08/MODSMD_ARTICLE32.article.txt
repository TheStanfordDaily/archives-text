After six months of grueling training, the Stanford
men sand women's crew teams will be opening the
1985 racing season tomorrow at the third annual
River City Regatta on the Sacramento Deep Water
Channel.
Stanford has entered two men's varsity eight-man
boats, one men's varsity four, one men's novice four,
two women's novice eights, two men's novice eights,
and two men's freshman eights.
The women's varsity will not be racing at Sacramento,
but instead will begin its racing schedule in a dual meet
against Oregon State March 30 at Redwood Shores.
In addition to Stanford, crews representing Califor
nia Maritime Academy, Humboldt State, Pacific, St.
Mary's, University of San Francisco, Mills College,
UC-Davis and California will also be racing.
Jim Flawwell, the frosh/novice men's coach, said that
all of the crews are looking very strong this year and
Stanford expects to do well tomorrow.
"The novice women are going to blow everyone up.
The varsity men, it's hard to tell, but if they win it will
be a real feather in their cap. As for frosh/novice, we'll
be very competitive."
Cal will be the school to beat, according to Flawwell.
"Cal's No. 1. So as far as the varsity is concerned,
Cal for sure. For frosh/novice, Cal, of course. Hum
boldt State has a fast novice boat, and UC- Davis is ex
pected to be competitive early on in the season."
The race is 3,400 meters long and lies on a section of
the almost laser-straight 10-mile stretch of the Deep
Water Channel connecting Sacramento and Stockton.
It is used during the year by Davis for training.
Race times are expected to be about 12 minutes for
the eights and 14-and-a-half minutes for the fours.
The shells reach speeds over 15 miles per hour and are
the fastest unpowered vessel on water.
