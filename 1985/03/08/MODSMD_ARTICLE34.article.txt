# Men's gymnastics vs. UC-Davis
## Card can earn NCAA berth 
### CAROLYN TARKINGTON Staff sportswriter 
With only two meets left that will count
toward NCAA qualification, the Stanford
men's gymnastics team has a very important
task ahead tonight. In the last home meet of
the season, against UC-Davis, the Cardinal
men need to score at least 280 points in or
der to nail down an NCAA spot, according
to Head Coach Sadao Hamada.
In the NCAA qualification process, two
home-meet scores and three away-meet
scores are averaged to determine the top 10
teams in the nation. Currently, Stanford is
ranked 10th.
"Right now our average is about 276
points," Hamada said. "That won't get us

into the NCAAs. What we need is a score
very close to 280 or better in the next two
meets to bring up our average, and this will
almost guarantee that we'll qualify."
When asked if he thought the team could
get the scores tonight, Hamada said the po
tential is there. "I'm concerned about a
couple minor injuries bothering two of the
gymnasts, but I think if we have a lot of sup
port tonight, we will hit and get the scores
we need," he said.
Stanford's opponent, UC-Davis, is an
NCAA Division II team.
"We won't be competing against a real
strong team, although Davis is third or
fourth in the Division II rankings," Hamada
said. "Winning this meet is not what is im
portant to us. What we need to do is hit our

routines and score well."
This season — Hamada's 13th at Stanford
— is the first one in which the Cardinal has
been ranked in the top 10 and is a national
contender. "We have always had individual
NCAA qualifiers but never have we had a
team as strong as this one," Hamada said.
"It's really a unique team, too. There are
only six members and they are all all-around
competitors."
"We're an exciting team-to watch,"
Hamada said. "I hope that a lot of the stu
dent body who haven't seen us yet this
season come out and cheer for us tonight.
We really need all of the support we can
get."
Tonight's competition starts at 7:30 in
Maples Pavilion.
