Remember Billy Joel's song
"Scenes from an Italian Restaurant"
from a few years back? You know,
with Brenda and Eddie and a bottle
of red, a bottle of white. If you've
been in a neighborhood family-run
Italian restaurant, you knew the kind
of place he was singing about.
Rudolfo's, on El Camino Real a
couple miles south of campus, is such
a place. It has the red-and-white
tablecloths, the red lighting and the
kitchen placed in the middle so you
can watch the pizzas being flipped as
you wait for dinner. Pictures of opera
singers, symphony musicians and
other celebrities who have eaten
there are hung on the wall.
Art Alfinito, who owns Rudolfo's
with his two brothers, said that his
business is between 85 and 90 per
cent repeat. Rudolfo's has only 85
seats, which contributes to the atmos
phere, and the restaurant is totally
family-run. Alfinito said they'll prob
ably begin serving outside next
month.
If you go on a weekend, make sure
you've got time to wait, for it can take
more than an hour. On a Monday
night, though, we had no trouble get
ting a seat and taking our time.
Rudolfo's has been in Palo Alto for
29 years. Alfinito said he started
working in his uncle's restaurant in

San Francisco more than 40 years
ago. Everything listed on the menu
is made on the premises, and
"everything we use is fresh." stated
Alfinito.
We both started with a cup of
minestrone soup ($1.50), which was
spicy and filled with vegetables.
When the deluxe seafood antipasto
($7.95) came, we faced serious
doubts about whether a main course
would be necessary. For a couple that
enjoys vegetarian and seafood dishes,
the antipasto should be enough food
by itself. It was'topped with shrimp
and tuna, but underneath were
tomatoes, carrots, broccoli, beets,
lettuce and undoubtedly some other
things we never got to before the
entrees arrived.
The veal scallopini ($9.50) was
smothered in mushrooms, covered
with tomato sauce and wine that
made the meal — just spicy enough
without overpowering the veal. The
same was the case with the chicken
cacciatore ($8.50), which was made
with herbs with tomato sauce and
wine and also topped with a generous
helping of mushrooms.
If you plan to have a full meal at
Rudolfo's, make sure to leave room
for desert. The selection features
homemade pastries and cakes, "made
with all pufe ingredients," Alfinito
said.
We didn't have a chance to try the
pizza, which is made according to an
80-year-old recipe. Though

Rudolfo's doesn't deliver, the pizzas
are available for takeout. Prices range
from $6.95 for a small cheese pizza to
$14.50 for one "with the works."
The prices at Rudolfo's are
reasonable for this area. All entrees
are less than $10, and the check for a
larger-than-usual meal came to less
than $40 with a liter of a good house
rose wine ($5.95). It's possible for
two people to eat at Rudolfo's for
$25 and still have more than enough.
One gets more than good Italian
food and atmosphere at Rudolfo's —
Alfinito's market predictions are up
on the wall in front of the kitchen.
He's predicting that everything — in
cluding interest rates — will fall while
the stock market continues rising.
If you invite him over to your table,
he'll also give you a few stock tips. He
sees the pay phone industry as a
growing industry, and he'll tell you
where to invest the money you don't
have. Alfinito will also tell you why
1988 presidential election will see
Lee lacocca running for the
Democrats against Republican
nominee George Shultz.
Make sure you've got time to spend
there. After all, an Italian restaurant
is more than a place to eat — it's
somewhere to spend an evening with
good friends and good conversation.

How many local Italian restaurants
have you been to that have some
amount of atmosphere, some good,
no-nonsense food and relatively
decent prices, but that just don't/iave
it? Quite a few, I would imagine.
Some places have definitely come
closer to the ranks of memorable Ital
ian food than others, but Palo Alto
Joe's is unfortunately not one of
them.
Though advertised as having "great
Italian food," this establishment
seems to be having an identity crisis
in terms of atmosphere. Its decor
could easily fool one into believing
he were dining in a family-style
steak house, rather than a fine Italian
restaurant.
Upon glancing through the menu,
we were reassured, however, that
it did offer the standard fettucini,
tortellini and other assorted "ini's,"
in addition to a variety of other
dishes.
At the start, I think it's fair to say
that the best thing about Palo Alto
Joe's is its wide selection of entrees.
There are several selections in each of
the fish, chicken, veal and steak
categories that instantly inspired our
taste buds.
The restaurant has a full bar, but
because we were seated immediately, we
opted for a glass of house wine and a

beer at our table instead.
After much deliberation in trying
to assemble the perfect meal, we fi
nally ordered several appetizers,
along with one pasta and one fish
entree.
The host and waitresses were all
very attentive, but unlike those at so

Palo Alto Joe's
serves a wide se
lection of entrees,
but falls short of
distinguishing it
self as a great Ital
ian restaurant.

many popular restaurants, they didn't
push themselves on us, which was a
refreshing change.
The appetizers, Mozarella
Marinara ($3.75) and Tortellini
Alfredo ($6.75 for two), came only
minutes after the waitress had taken
our order. We were both famished, so

anything would have tasted good at
first, but after the initial hunger wore
off we discovered that they tasted just
like any other basic fried mozzarella
cheese and tortellini drowned in their
respective sauces.
Again, we didn't have to wait long
for the entrees to follow. Having
taken the advice of a Palo Alto Joe's
fan. we had chosen the Fettuccini
Aurora with scallops ($8.95) and one
of the evening's specials, broiled
halibut ($8.95).
Hoping that the entrees would
boost our sagging opinions, we had
very high expectations. They weren't
completely met.
The pasta simply didn't measure up
to our imagination. The halibut,
however, was notably good; very
tender and flavorful just as I'd hoped.
It was far and away the best dish we
were served.
Since both of us are gelato
aficionados, we couldn't get out the
door without a small taste. Vanilla
bean and caramel fudge were the
choices, so we ordered one of each
($2 a serving). Both were extremely
delicious, so we concluded the meal
with a good taste in our mouths.
All in all, 1 would say that if some
body invites you to Palo Alto Joe's,
by all means go. It might turn into a
favorite of yours, but it left my search
for the perfect Italian restaurant sadly
incomplete.

of red, a bottle of white. If you've
been in a neighborhood family-run
Italian restaurant, you knew the kind
of place he was singing about.
Rudolfo's, on El Camino Real a
couple miles south of campus, is such
a place. It has the red-and-white
tablecloths, the red lighting and the
kitchen placed in the middle so you
can watch the pizzas being flipped as
you wait for dinner. Pictures of opera
singers, symphony musicians and
other celebrities who have eaten
there are hung on the wall.
Art Alfinito, who owns Rudolfo's
with his two brothers, said that his
business is between 85 and 90 per
cent repeat. Rudolfo's has only 85
seats, which contributes to the atmos
phere, and the restaurant is totally
family-run. Alfinito said they'll prob
ably begin serving outside next
month.
If you go on a weekend, make sure
you've got time to wait, for it can take
more than an hour. On a Monday
night, though, we had no trouble get
ting a seat and taking our time.
Rudolfo's has been in Palo Alto for
29 years. Alfinito said he started
working in his uncle's restaurant in

San Francisco more than 40 years
ago. Everything listed on the menu
is made on the premises, and
"everything we use is fresh." stated
Alfinito.
We both started with a cup of
minestrone soup ($1.50), which was
spicy and filled with vegetables.
When the deluxe seafood antipasto
($7.95) came, we faced serious
doubts about whether a main course
would be necessary. For a couple that
enjoys vegetarian and seafood dishes,
the antipasto should be enough food
by itself. It was'topped with shrimp
and tuna, but underneath were
tomatoes, carrots, broccoli, beets,
lettuce and undoubtedly some other
things we never got to before the
entrees arrived.
The veal scallopini ($9.50) was
smothered in mushrooms, covered
with tomato sauce and wine that
made the meal — just spicy enough
without overpowering the veal. The
same was the case with the chicken
cacciatore ($8.50), which was made
with herbs with tomato sauce and
wine and also topped with a generous
helping of mushrooms.
If you plan to have a full meal at
Rudolfo's, make sure to leave room
for desert. The selection features
homemade pastries and cakes, "made
with all pufe ingredients," Alfinito
said.
We didn't have a chance to try the
pizza, which is made according to an
80-year-old recipe. Though

Rudolfo's doesn't deliver, the pizzas
are available for takeout. Prices range
from $6.95 for a small cheese pizza to
$14.50 for one "with the works."
The prices at Rudolfo's are
reasonable for this area. All entrees
are less than $10, and the check for a
larger-than-usual meal came to less
than $40 with a liter of a good house
rose wine ($5.95). It's possible for
two people to eat at Rudolfo's for
$25 and still have more than enough.
One gets more than good Italian
food and atmosphere at Rudolfo's —
Alfinito's market predictions are up
on the wall in front of the kitchen.
He's predicting that everything — in
cluding interest rates — will fall while
the stock market continues rising.
If you invite him over to your table,
he'll also give you a few stock tips. He
sees the pay phone industry as a
growing industry, and he'll tell you
where to invest the money you don't
have. Alfinito will also tell you why
1988 presidential election will see
Lee lacocca running for the
Democrats against Republican
nominee George Shultz.
Make sure you've got time to spend
there. After all, an Italian restaurant
is more than a place to eat — it's
somewhere to spend an evening with
good friends and good conversation.
Just ask Brenda and Eddie.

How many local Italian restaurants
have you been to that have some
amount of atmosphere, some good,
no-nonsense food and relatively
decent prices, but that just don't/iave
it? Quite a few, I would imagine.
Some places have definitely come
closer to the ranks of memorable Ital
ian food than others, but Palo Alto
Joe's is unfortunately not one of
them.
Though advertised as having "great
Italian food," this establishment
seems to be having an identity crisis
in terms of atmosphere. Its decor
could easily fool one into believing
he were dining in a family-style
steak house, rather than a fine Italian
restaurant.
Upon glancing through the menu,
we were reassured, however, that
it did offer the standard fettucini,
tortellini and other assorted "ini's,"
in addition to a variety of other
dishes.
At the start, I think it's fair to say
that the best thing about Palo Alto
Joe's is its wide selection of entrees.
There are several selections in each of
the fish, chicken, veal and steak
categories that instantly inspired our
taste buds.
The restaurant has a full bar, but
because we were seated immediately, we
opted for a glass of house wine and a

beer at our table instead.
After much deliberation in trying
to assemble the perfect meal, we fi
nally ordered several appetizers,
along with one pasta and one fish
entree.
The host and waitresses were all
very attentive, but unlike those at so

Palo Alto Joe's
serves a wide se
lection of entrees,
but falls short of
distinguishing it
self as a great Ital
ian restaurant.

many popular restaurants, they didn't
push themselves on us, which was a
refreshing change.
The appetizers, Mozarella
Marinara ($3.75) and Tortellini
Alfredo ($6.75 for two), came only
minutes after the waitress had taken
our order. We were both famished, so

anything would have tasted good at
first, but after the initial hunger wore
off we discovered that they tasted just
like any other basic fried mozzarella
cheese and tortellini drowned in their
respective sauces.
Again, we didn't have to wait long
for the entrees to follow. Having
taken the advice of a Palo Alto Joe's
fan. we had chosen the Fettuccini
Aurora with scallops ($8.95) and one
of the evening's specials, broiled
halibut ($8.95).
Hoping that the entrees would
boost our sagging opinions, we had
very high expectations. They weren't
completely met.
The pasta simply didn't measure up
to our imagination. The halibut,
however, was notably good; very
tender and flavorful just as I'd hoped.
It was far and away the best dish we
were served.
Since both of us are gelato
aficionados, we couldn't get out the
door without a small taste. Vanilla
bean and caramel fudge were the
choices, so we ordered one of each
($2 a serving). Both were extremely
delicious, so we concluded the meal
with a good taste in our mouths.
All in all, 1 would say that if some
body invites you to Palo Alto Joe's,
by all means go. It might turn into a
favorite of yours, but it left my search
for the perfect Italian restaurant sadly
incomplete.
