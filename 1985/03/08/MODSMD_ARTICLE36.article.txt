China First Restaurant

In an area rich in Chinese cuisine,

taurant is conveniently located on El
Camino Real, making it accessible to
both bikers and pedestrians. It offers
a wide variety of Mandarin and Szec
huan cooking. The service and the
quality of the dishes, however, are
average at best.
China First, like many other Penin
sula Chinese restaurants, is guilty of
Americanizing its appearance and its
food. Although this phenomenon
may not necessarily be bad, the merg
ing of the two cultures compromises
the styles of both.
China First opens for dinner at
6:30 p.m. and is busiest until 8 p.m.,

but even then tables are available.
The restaurant offers lunch from
11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. Monday through
Friday as well.
The atmosphere during dinner
hours in this well-lit eating establish
ment is informal, not designed as the
place for a romantic interlude. Al-

though it does not inspire a feeling of
being whisked to the Orient, China
First is well suited for a casual altern
ative to food service.
One of the strengths of the restau
rant lies in the appetizers. The spring
rolls (two for $1.80) and kuo teh —
pot stickers — (six for $3.25) were
excellent. Served with superb sauces,
the appetizers were easily the most
memorable course of the meal.
The main dishes were somewhat of
a letdown following the opening
course.The menu does offer a wide
array of reasonably priced dishes.
Most of the main courses cost be

tween $5 and $7. A "complete din
ner" ($8.50 per person), featuring a
variety of favorites, is also available.
The Szechuaii-style diced chicken
($5.95), advertized as hot and spicy,
was not particularly flavorful. Al
though the helping was generous, the
dish itself was little more than ordi
nary. The Mandarin beef ($5.95) was
also rather bland. The meat was not
particularly tender, while the sauce
was little more than generic.
If there was to be any redemption,
it came in the form of the shrimp a la
Shanghai ($6.75). Of the three
entrees, it emerged as the most en
joyable. The flavoring was tasty but
not overbearing, easily besting the
flavorings added to the other dishes
we tried.
The dishes arrived fairly quickly
but the service in general was rather
bleak. The waiters were certainly not
an intrusion on our conversation.
They appeared quite infrequently to
perform their assigned duties: filling
water glasses, bussing the tables and
bringing the check. The manager was
forced to bus our table in the absence
of our assigned waiter.
China First specializes in average
but not superior Chinese cuisine.
While the restaurant offers nothing
that could be considered truly excep
tional, it has the potential for provid
ing its patrons with a good evening.
Armed with lively dinner conversa
tion, one can easily overlook the res
taurant's faults and focus on the
stronger points of the menu.

Pasquinelli's Farm House
386 Convention Way
Redwood City
369-3337
Pasquinelli's Farm House knows its
market and caters to it very well. This
is a restaurant where the family can
go. Dad gets a steak. Mom gets fish
and the kids get hamburgers off
the children's menu. Everyone goes
home stuffed and not a whole lot
poorer.
As one would expect, the exterior
looks like a farm house. It's large and
yellow. You've probably seen it in
Redwood City while driving down
Highway 101. It's off the Whipple
Exit.
The interior is huge. There are
hardwood floors, a wooden staircase
and a series of wooden ceiling fans.
The way the fans were designed and
the way they are spinning works to
push air up, not down, so we assumed
they are there for atmosphere. The
place has an air conditioner anyway.
The bar is the Farm House's most
visible attraction for students. Live
bands play four nights a week and
there are great happy-hour (is t still
legal to say that?) offerings. For ex
ample, one night 99 cent murgaritas
and Mexican hors d'oeuvres are the
specialty. On a normal Saturday night
you get free popcorn and can sit and
watch strange news items flash by on
an overhead screen until the band
comes out. We stopped back in the
bar after our meal, and a large crowd,
made up mostly of people in their
20s, had gathered to listen to the
band.

We waited about 20 minutes
before being seated. On the way to
our table we both noticed an un
pleasant fishy smell, but it seemed to
go away after about 10 minutes.
The tables have paper placemats
with the menu printed on them. A
note on the bottom of the menu

The portions of
fered are large
enough to feed a
farm hand or a
football player. If
you're a bargain
hunter, you'll be
in heaven.

reads, "In Newark, Redwood City,
and soon throughout the Bay Area."
The restaurant makes no real
pretense at being a small, homey type
of place.
The portions, however, are large
enough to please a farm hand or a
football player. All the meals come
with minestrone soup, bread, salad,
vegetables, a baked potato or pasta
and ice cream. This makes the lower
priced items on the menu a real bar
gain.

The bargain of the night on Satur
day appeared to be the prime rib spe
cial for $6.95. With all the included
freebies, this makes a lot of food for
$6.95. Other items on the lower end
of the price scale were the roasted
chicken ($4.95), veal steak ($5.95)
and pot roast ($6.95). There is a fresh
fish special every day ($7.95) and
fried prawns ($8.95). A half-pound
steak is $8.95 and a three-quarter
pound slab of prime rib is $9.95.
We ordered steak and lobster
($14.95) and prime rib. The steak
was fine and came as ordered, but the
lobster was not quite hot or
tender enough. It was by far the most
expensive item on the menu, and it
seemed clear that it was not the Farm
House specialty. One doesn't often
hear of farm hands sitting down to a
nice lobster tail after a hard day in the
fields, so 1 guess this should be ex
pected.
The minestrone soup was good, but
the salad arrived with a lot more
dressing than lettuce. The rest of the
included items were fine, although
the only ice cream offering was rain
bow sherbet, which we skipped.
Red, white and rose house wine is
available for $5.25 for a large carafe
or $3.25 for a small one, and two se
lections of bottled wine are available
for $8.85.
Overall the meal was enjoyable
and the service was good. If you're a
bargain hunter you'll be in heaven,
but if you're a cordon bleu chef you
won't.
