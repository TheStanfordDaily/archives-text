The "interview" is an odd literary
genre in that it so often has nothing to
do with literature at all. and more of

ten to do with gossip, politics and the
commerce of self-promotion. But it is
ideally suited tor an age which values
Lipton's Cup-A-Soup; it can be
swallowed in a sitting that lasts no
longer than the time span dividing
"Cheers" from "Hill Stret Blues."
And the wit one gains from them can
easily he spilt at cocktail parties (or.
perhaps more often, ranting beer
binges).
The most famous forum for the
literary interview is The Paris

Review. C ollected in five or six hooks
by now. these interviews resemble a
huge yapping party: there are as
main interviewers as interviewees,
and some writers look at what they
are saying with less sobriety than
others. For example, now we all know
that Joan Didion must sleep in the
same room with the manuscript of the
novel she is working on. and that
Gore Vidal has a coffee and poop
each morning before he writes I have
to admit that this stuff has held me
rapt — so does "Divorce Court"
(with Judge William Keane. after the
David Letterman Show) — and I'm
not proud of it. On the other hand,
some interviews are more rewarding.
William Ciass employs his interview
as an opportunity to hold forth in full
complexity on a number of fiction's
more technical and philosophical
matters — in a way that, due to the
give and take with his interviewer,
stamps out Gass' tendency to be
tricky and cov. And it does seem to
me that any discussion with a writer
as important (but usually silent and
hidden) as Henry Green is immensely
worthwhile.
Charles Ruas. whose interviews
have appeared in The Paris Review,
can improve on the latter's format by
tying together a group of interviews
with his own personality and con
cerns. Unfortunately, neither ap
pears, in this book anyway, to be at
all striking. (He is too singlemindedly
interested in the writers' so-called
"development" and "themes.")
Ruas interviews novelists almost
exclusively, and mostly from that old
bunch you've come to appreciate or
despise as the New York Literary Es

tablishment — so there's Susan Son
tag. Norman Mailer. Joseph Heller.
E. 1.. Doetorow and. coming out of
the bathroom. Gore Vidal again
the '•stars.'' together for another mar
keting event. Although his face ap
pears on the cover, William Bur
roughs is not in fact at all interviewed
by Ruas; we get instead tired talk
from Allen Ginsberg and some un
derground publishers on the subject
of books banned nearly 30 years ago.
Burroughs' face on the jacket to
help sell the book, no more.

I cannot imagine Capote, even at his
most bitchy or wiped-out, having
allowed this whining and mean
spirited book to reach print.

These reservations aside,
"Conversations With American Writ
ers" is remarkably successful: most of
the writers respond to his pablummy
questions with startling intensity and
seriousness. Robert Stone talks about
his work in the context of the '60s,
when he and fellow Stanford writer
Ken Kesey took off around
the nation in their magic bus spread
ing the gospel of LSD. "Another
thing that' Dog Soldiers' is about,"' he
says, "is that nothing is free. There
was America having this party at the
same time as a war was going on. We
were going to do three thint>s at once

— we were going to tight a successful
war in Asia, we were going to reform
Asia, and we were going to have a
terrific party at the same time. I hat
just wasn't so."
And Susan Sontag contends that
hei work can't he interpreted from
any feminist slant: "What I've written
has been in no sense a rebellion
against anything 1 know of. I never
felt, consciously or unconsciously,
that there was any conflict between
my voeation and being a woman."
One writer for whom the interview

form is ideal is Norman Mailer —
whose books have always seemed to
me hacked out and strained, but
whose off-the-cuff pronouncements
bubble with verve. Here, Mailer
spends the bulk of Ins time explaining
his relationship with Jack Abbott, the
convict-writer Mailer helped get
released from prison, only to see him
commit murder almost immediately.
"My feeling is. if anything is ever
going to be salvaged from this ab
solutely wasteful business that was a
disaster all around, it's if Abbott ends
up able to do some truly serious
writing. . . . It's much better to get

something out of a disaster than noth
ing. Again, this is a mystical equation
I have."
Ruas' talk with Truman Capote has
taken on an ironic aspect since
Capote's demise in Joanna Carson s
guest bedroom recently. For exam
ple, Capote claims that drugs never
interfered with his work; cocaine can
hurt other people, he says, but that s
only because theirs isn't as high-grade
as his. This interview concludes by
Capote noting, "1 have this feeling
I'm going to win this race (with
Mailer. Vidal. William Styron, J.D.
Salinger). Because I have a big ace up
my sleeve which 1 don't think any of
those gentlemen have."
His big ace certainly wasn t
"Conversations with Capote,' by
Lawrence Grobel, frequent inter
viewer for Playboy magazine. I can
not imagine Capote, even at his most
bitchy or wiped-out, having allowed
this whining and mean-spirited book
to reach print. He attacks everybody
from Jacqueline Onassis to Jaspar
Johns and Robert Rauschenberg
("You call them artists?"), from
Henry Moore (his sculptures "bore
me") to Mick Jagger ("a bore").
About Yoko Ono: "I couldn't stand
her. The Jap. She was always
paranoid. The most unpleasant per
son that ever was, in my opinion.
She's a bore."
His masterpiece, "Answered
Prayers," never completed, his talent
wrecked by alcohol, drugs and stupid
publicity, Truman Capote finally
treated himself as perfunctorily as he
did everybody else.
