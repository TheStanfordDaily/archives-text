## Louise Bogan's psychic barriers to success 
### 
"Louise Bogan: A Portrait"
By Elizabeth Frank
Alfred A. Knopf, 1985
$24.95, 460 pp.
Elizabeth Frank contemplated the
poetry and papers of Louise Bogan
for 10 years before publishing this
biography, trying to solve the moral
and practical questions in telling the
life story of a passionately private
woman. As Frank writes in her
foreward, "privacy that is violated for
the sake of literary and cultural his
tory remains violated," but she
proceeds from this apology to an em
pathetic examination of a fascinating
woman's struggle with the vagaries of
the literary profession and with her
own psychic barriers to success.
Frank insists too hard on this prob
lem of privacy. At her death, Bogan
left 70 pages of autobiography,
several parts of which were published
in her lifetime. The impulse to record
her life arose even before she began
her first psychotherapy sessions,
which necessarily made memory ver
bal. While her early poetry is reticent
to the point of obscurity, and while
she only later sought the modest
limelight available to American
poets, clearly she saw the literary pos
sibilities of her life and recorded them
for publication. Even if, as Frank
says, much of the art of Bogan's
poetry was "devoted to the task of
dissembling confession through sym
bol and form," the poems became
easier to reassemble as she grew older

and realized that memory is all the
poet really has, and even that is slip
pery.
Louise Bogan was chief poetry
critic and a contributor to The New
Yorker magazine for 38 years. From
that position, she passed twice-yearly
judgment on particular poets and
trends in the most interesting period
of American poetry. From the heyday
of modernism to the reaction of post
modernism, she felt and assimilated
the changes in her own poetry and ar
ticulated them for her New Yorker
audience, as well as for those of The
New Republic, Partisan Review and
Nation. She was a central and attrac
tive figure in a circle that included,
early, Arthur Kreymborg and Mar
garet Mead, and later Rolfe
Humphries, Edmund Wilson, Morton
Zabel and William Maxwell.
The "problem" of Louise Bogan's
life is "Why not more?" Her col
lected poems, "The Blue Eateries,"
contains only 103 poems, all but 14 of
which were published before she was
45 years old. An excellent critic, why
did she not go beyond her life-long
vocation of professional book
reviewer? And most important, what
was it that caused her to pull back
violently from the verge of success
and recognition, and then resent bit
terly her isolation?
Bogan and Frank both locate the
barriers, imprecisely, in Bogan's diffi
cult childhood. The daughter of a
fiery Irish millworker and his doubly
passionate wife, Bogan was born in

1897 and spent her early years in a
series of hotels and rooming houses in
miserable New England milltowns,
witness to bitter quarrels between her
parents and, worse, to the pathetic
extramarital affairs of her mother.
Eager to escape, the brilliant high
school student married after one year
of college and immediately had a
daughter by her severe German hus
band, who died soon after, saving her
the trouble of a divorce.
This freed her to make her way in
the literary world. Frank's account
spends a great deal of time on this
period, when the supposedly
frivolous '20s became the politically
committed '30s, explaining how
Bogan secured her New Yorker posi
tion, how from this podium she dis
dained, indeed ridiculed, the many
writers who made political commit
ments, and her temperamental dis
trust of ideology in poetry and life.
This was also the most interesting
period of Bogan's personal life.
In 1923, she had begun living with
Raymond Holden, and had married
him in 1925. The relationship was
difficult from the first, but increas
ingly Bogan's pathological jealousy
and paranoia collided violently with
Holden's weakness and romantic
delusions. In 1931 and again in 1934,
Bogan voluntarily entered psychiatric
hospitals in attempts to define her
childhood traumas and to understand
the failure of her marriages. Chapter
six of this book, "The Flawed Light of
Love and Grief," is an especially

good account of the second of these
recoveries and the way in which treat
ment interacts with the creative
process. Frank sees this episode, from
which Bogan emerged "as cured as
she was ever liki ly to be," as the
watershed in her personal and crea
tive life, and a touchstone for her ma
ture consciousness.
Bogan divorced Holden and never
married again, though she carried on
a secret, eight-year love affair with a
man who remains unnamed in this
book. This relationship, the first un
neurotic sexual attachment in the life
of a woman who believed in the value
of sexual passion, was made possible
by the 1934 therapy, which centered
on an understanding of time and
memory and which ended in a ca
tharsis of forgiveness.
Periods of sadness and personal
crisis continued to trouble Bogan,
though the lessons of her therapy
made it possible for her to endure
them and to keep working at the
reviews,- lectures and teaching by
which she made her very modest
living. But when they returned full
force in 1969, neither therapy nor
drugs nor electroshock treatments
were able to banish them, and she
died in 1970, a fearful and lonely
woman.
The book is a moving account of
this brilliant woman's struggle to rec
oncile love and ambition, and the
demons of the past with those of the
creative spirit. Its flaws are those
common to biographies, which must

make linear lives which are anything
but. The book is redundant at times,
but often this can be attributed to the
biographer's attempt to keep in the
mind of her reader what was certainly
in the mind of her subject. Frank's
treatment of the poems, which
succeeds in reading them
autobiographically without making
them documents, seems awkwardly
placed as she pauses in her accounts
of the years in which Bogan published
books to explicate nearly all the

poems in them. The result is huge
chunks of close reading, which might
have been better done at intervals,
perhaps as the poems were written.
Frank's forward to the book admits
defeat; the "something (that] stopped
Louise Bogan dead in her tracks, not
once, but many times" cannot be
winnowed from poems or documents.
Nevertheless, this record of the
struggle is interesting and valuable.
