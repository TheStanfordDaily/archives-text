# Reagan OKs library site
## 
### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
President Reagan has accepted a
Stanford Board of Trustees recom
mendation to locate his presidential
library on a 20-acre site in the foot
hills overlooking campus.
In a March 6 letter to University
President Donald Kennedy, Reagan
said the site, which lies just west of
Junipero Serra Boulevard near the
Center for Advanced Study in the
Behavioral Sciences and the Stanford
Golf Course, "is an excellent choice."
"I approve the site and look for
ward to the construction of a library
facility at Stanford University that
will be a valuable academic resource
for the nation and especially for the
Stanford community," Reagan said in
the letter.
"Based on the maps and

photographs I have seen, my personal
knowledge of the campus and the dis
cussions I have had with (Attorney
General) Ed IV .ese, (Hoover Institu
tion Director) Glenn Campbell and
(former Reagan aide) Marty Ander
son, I believe it is an excellent
choice," Reagan said.
The Board of Trustees unani
mously agreed to recommend the
Junipero Serra site to Reagan at its
Feb. 5 meeting. That site is the closest
to the center of campus of more than
20 locations considered by a Stanford
planning committee.
Reagan's official acceptance of the
site means that attention can now
turn to the library itself. The first
task, according to Robert Freelen,
Stanford vice president for public af
fairs, is to establish the Ronald
Reagan Foundation, an independent

group that will raise funds for the
facility, choose an architect and over
see most of the planning.
The actual building will probably
be 80,000 to 100,000 square feet,
and the total project will cost "in the
$20 million range," Freelen said. He
said construction will probably not
begin until 1987, after both the Uni
versity and Santa Clara County ap
prove the design.
Freelen said planners hope to "get
it done so the facility would be
operative when the president gets out
of office" in January 1989.
Reagan said he backs the Junipero
Serra site in part because of its prox
imity to the center of campus.
"It will be close enough to the cen
ter of campus to allow easy access by
students and faculty, but will not
cause any parking or traffic problems
for the University," Reagan said.
Opponents of the site, however,
say congestion will increase, espe
cially at the intersection of Campus
Drive West and Junipero Serra. But
University planners say that because
the library will not be open during
peak morning and evening traffic
hours, the library will not contribute
to the commuter gridlock that already
snarls traffic on Junipero Serra.
Regarding the library's design,
Meese, in a Jan. 18 letter to
Campbell, said Reagan "would be fa
vorable to a building design that

blended into the Stanford hillsides
and complemented the natural set
ting."
Meese said both he and Anderson
had visited the site, and wanted "to
preserve the trees, the hiking and jog
ging trails that currently exist, and as
much of the natural environment as
possible."
Meese said Reagan "strongly
prefers the kind of architecture that
predominates on the Stanford
campus, including red-tile roofs."
Anderson, a senior fellow at
Hoover and Reagan's campus liaison
for library matters, has worked
closely with both Meese and Freelen
ever since the board accepted
Reagan's bid for a library and small
museum in February 1984.
