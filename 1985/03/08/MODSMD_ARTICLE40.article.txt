## Senate views new budget 
### DEBBIE RUBENSTEIN Senior staff writer 
Provost James Rosse forecast a $ 10 million budget defi
cit by 1989, given current trends in the University's
income and spending, during his presentation of the 1985-
86 University budget at the Faculty Senate meeting yes
terday.
But Rosse added that despite the anticipated deficits,
Stanford will continue to make admissions on a "need
blind" basis.
Rosse cited consolidation and improvement costs, as
well as operation and management on new buildings, as
primary causes of the estimated deficit. Generally, the
conditional budget, part of the overall budget, is used to
offset unforeseen expenditures over the year, Rosse said.
However, at projected levels, expenditures will soon
exceed the estimated conditional income, such as tuition
and fees.
The entire 1985-86 budget of approximately $704.9
million is composed of the operating budget ($270.3 mil
lion), which deals with much of the overhead costs of the
University; the restricted budget ($234.8 million), made
up of sponsored research and other restricted areas; auxil
iary enterprises ($54.4 million), such as dorm and food
services; the faculty practice plan ($47.4 million); and
operating costs lor the Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter ($9B million).
Rosse will submit the budget for approval to the Board
of Trustees on Tuesday.
1 he proposed guidelines include provisions for salary
increases for faculty and staff members above the
projected 5 percent inflation rate, an increase of almost
$500,000 in support for undergraduate financial aid and a
$1.5 million increase for support of academic computing.
Rosse does expect a balanced operating budget for next
year, with an overall increase of 9.5 percent over this
year's budget.
Salaries, benefits and similar costs make up about 75
percent of operating budget expenses.
The proposed guidelines include provisions for an ap
proximately 7 percent faculty and staff salary increase,
which falls under instruction costs in the operating budget.
"There is a continuing pattern of Peninsula salaries
growing at a faster pace than elsewhere in the state and
nation," the proposed guidelines state.
Rosse said staff benefits will rise from 24.1 to 24.9 per
cent of salaries. This increase can be attributed to higher
costs and rates in such items as social security, health in
surance and new retirement options.
Rosse said that Stanford, excluding SLAC, allocates ap
proximately the same percentage of its overall budget

funds to research as it does to instruction. He said this is
comparable to Yale, the University of Pennsylvania and
Columbia.
Student aid accounts for 5.9 percent of the operating
budget. It includes tuition aid provided directly to the stu
dents. Scholarships and grants for undergraduates will in
crease around 6.7 percent, totaling approximately $26
million.
University President Donald Kennedy said that tuition,
as a source of University income, is not rising faster than
the average family income. Last year's ratio of tuition to
disposable family income was within one-fourth of 1960's
ratio.
In reference to the proposed Guaranteed Student Loan
cuts by the Reagan administration, Rosse said, "If and
when the cuts come about, we (the University) might have
to dip into the conditional (reserve) budget. Estimates are
all over the map."
Expansion of the Low Overhead Time-Sharing (LOTS)
program to four machines, completion of the SUNet sys
tem and an increase of support for computing applications
throughout the University is also provided for under the
proposed budget. In addition, the budget calls for the de
velopment of educational software.
A 9.1 percent increase in allocations of funds for library
expenses is recommended, due to a rise in book prices and
associated costs.
Rosse cited many trends that have occurred during the
past 10 years.
Since 1976, the consolidated budget has risen from
$250 million to $700 million, with uniform increases in all
budget categories.
Rosse said that Stanford has increased its percentage of
tenured professors over the past 10 years from 55 to 59
percent of the total faculty.
Rosse also said that faculty changes over the past five
years have included an increase of 17 members in the
humanities, four in engineering, three in business, in earth
sciences, in natural sciences and in law and an increase of
two in all other areas. The social sciences department has
decreased by three faculty members, and education by
one.
Student enrollment has seen an increase in the number
of both undergraduate and graduate women since 1975.
Overall enrollment here has increased slightly from ap
proximately 11,050 students to near 12,500 students.
Applications in both the graduate and undergraduate
schools have shown a similar steady increase over the past
10 years. There were slightly fewer than 10,000 applica-
tions for undergraduate positions in
1975. The number of undergraduate
applicants peaked this year at more
than 17,000. Graduate applications
have increased from approximately
18,000 in 1975 to almost 23,000 last
year.

year, with an overall increase of 9.5 percent over this
year's budget.
Salaries, benefits and similar costs make up about 75
percent of operating budget expenses.
The proposed guidelines include provisions for an ap
proximately 7 percent faculty and staff salary increase,
which falls under instruction costs in the operating budget.
"There is a continuing pattern of Peninsula salaries
growing at a faster pace than elsewhere in the state and
nation," the proposed guidelines state.
Rosse said staff benefits will rise from 24.1 to 24.9 per
cent of salaries. This increase can be attributed to higher
costs and rates in such items as social security, health in
surance and new retirement options.
Rosse said that Stanford, excluding SLAC, allocates ap
proximately the same percentage of its overall budget

funds to research as it does to instruction. He said this is
comparable to Yale, the University of Pennsylvania and
Columbia.
Student aid accounts for 5.9 percent of the operating
budget. It includes tuition aid provided directly to the stu
dents. Scholarships and grants for undergraduates will in
crease around 6.7 percent, totaling approximately $26
million.
University President Donald Kennedy said that tuition,
as a source of University income, is not rising faster than
the average family income. Last year's ratio of tuition to
disposable family income was within one-fourth of 1960's
ratio.
In reference to the proposed Guaranteed Student Loan
cuts by the Reagan administration, Rosse said, "If and
when the cuts come about, we (the University) might have
to dip into the conditional (reserve) budget. Estimates are
all over the map."
Expansion of the Low Overhead Time-Sharing (LOTS)
program to four machines, completion of the SUNet sys
tem and an increase of support for computing applications
throughout the University is also provided for under the
proposed budget. In addition, the budget calls for the de
velopment of educational software.
A 9.1 percent increase in allocations of funds for library
expenses is recommended, due to a rise in book prices and
associated costs.
Rosse cited many trends that have occurred during the
past 10 years.
Since 1976, the consolidated budget has risen from
$250 million to $700 million, with uniform increases in all
budget categories.
Rosse said that Stanford has increased its percentage of
tenured professors over the past 10 years from 55 to 59
percent of the total faculty.
Rosse also said that faculty changes over the past five
years have included an increase of 17 members in the
humanities, four in engineering, three in business, in earth
sciences, in natural sciences and in law and an increase of
two in all other areas. The social sciences department has
decreased by three faculty members, and education by
one.
Student enrollment has seen an increase in the number
of both undergraduate and graduate women since 1975.
Overall enrollment here has increased slightly from ap
proximately 11,050 students to near 12,500 students.
Applications in both the graduate and undergraduate
schools have shown a similar steady increase over the past
10 years. There were slightly fewer than 10,000 applica-
tions for undergraduate positions in
1975. The number of undergraduate
applicants peaked this year at more
than 17,000. Graduate applications
have increased from approximately
18,000 in 1975 to almost 23,000 last
year.
