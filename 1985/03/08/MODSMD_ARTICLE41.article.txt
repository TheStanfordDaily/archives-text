## Cinema Scope 
### 
Morocco (1930)
Cedar, San Francisco
Cinephiles who take Josef von
Sternberg's American movies seriously
have a lot of explaining to do when it
comes to this one, which Jules Furthman
wrote in a very light, very silly mood.
Marlene Dietrich (in her first film in this
country) plays a cabaret singer who fol
lows her man, Gary Cooper, a Legion
naire, into the desert. (She first removes
her high heels.) Terrific fun.
Plays Tuesday with "Shanghai Ex
press."
The Lion in Winter (1968)
Kresge Auditorium
"Every family has its ups and downs,"
admits Eleanor of Aquitaine (Katharine
Hepburn) after a colossal Christmas row
with her husband, King Henry U (Peter
O'Toole), who keeps her imprisoned in a
castle far from his own the rest of the
year and only tolerates her presence —
for the sake of appearances — at

Yuletide. Medieval England has never
seemed so drab and dirty as in this point
lessly cynical, reductionist historical
melodrama by James Goldman (adapting
his own Broadway play), directed by An
thony Harvey with excessive attention to
uninteresting detail. If it weren't for the
sour tone and the tastefully boring style
of the production, Goldman's depiction
of the royal family as petty, squabbling
egotists might be amusing. Katharine
Hepburn's power is diminished by a
slightly depressing sentimentality (as it
has been in almost all of her subsequent
appearances, too), but Peter O'Toole
gives a near-great performance as King
Henry. (He had played a much younger,
randier Henry in "Becket" four years
earlier.) Anthony Hopkins, Nigel Terry
and Timothy Dalton play the sibling
princes.
Plays tonight at 9.
Live and Let Die (1973)
Memorial Auditorium

Roger Moore began his tenure in the
James Bond pictures with this particu
larly silly, pretty enjoyable adventure
about voodoo; after Sean Connery, he
seemed distinctly declasse, but at least he
was less inept than George Lazenby
(who had played Bond in "On Her
Majesty's Secret Service"). The plot
placed Bond squarely in the territory of
the race war movies so popular in 1972
and 1973, but the film is far from offen
sive. Guy Hamilton directed a cast that
included Yaphet Kotto, Jane Seymour,
Clifton James, David Hedison and Ber
nard Lee; the best part of the movie is
the intriguing title sequence featuring the
theme song (performed by Paul
McCartney and Wings).
Plays Sunday at 7 and 9:30.
Sweet Smell of Success (1956)
Cedar, San Francisco
As J.J., the vicious gossip columnist,
and Sidney Falco, the desperately am
bitious publicity agent, Burt Lancaster

and Tony Curtis do some of the best
work of their respective careers. (Curtis
has probably never been better — not
even in "Some Like It Hot") The film is
superb, and supremely entertaining; Al
exander Mackendrick, a tight, con
trolled, underrated director, provides
exactly the right scorched urban milieu
for the extravagant, mock-poetic
dialogue by Clifford Odets and Ernest
Lehman (out of Lehman's novelette) —
certainly Odets' most successful dialogue
since his heyday with the Group Theatre
in the mid-19305. ("What's this kid
got?" J.J. asks about the earnest young
hero, played by Martin Milner.
"Integrity. Acute. Like indigestion," Sid
ney replies.) Milner and Susan Harrison
are insipid as the young lovers, but noth
ing else in the movie rates that descrip
tion. With Sam Levene and, memorably,
Barbara Nichols as Rita, the cigarette
girl; shot by James Wong Howe; jazz
music scored by Elmer Bernstein and
played by the Chico Hamilton Quintet.
Plays today v and tomorrow with

"Scandal Sheet."
Swing Time (1936)
U.C. Theater, Berkeley
Perhaps the best of all the Astaire-
Rogers musicals, though the script (by
Howard Lindsay and Allan Scott) sags a
little. This time Fred is a famous dancer
who pretends to have two left feet so that
he can take lessons from Ginger, a dance
instructor at Eric Blore's school. The
magnificent songs (by Jerome Kern and
Dorothy Fields) are, in several cases,
more dramatically integrated than in
most of the series, and one triumphant
number follows another: "Pick Yourself
Up," "The Way You Look Tonight"
(which Fred sings to Ginger from an ad
joining room as she washes her hair),
"Waltz in Swing Time," "A Fine
Romance" (the duet in the snow),
"Bojangles of Harlem" (Astaire's tribute
to Bill "Bojangles" Robinson), and best
of all the pas de deux on the twin stair
ways, "Never Gonna Dance." ("The
Way You Look Tonight" took the Oscar
for Best Song.) George Stevens directed;
with Victor Moore in the Edward
Everett Horton part, Georges Metaxa in
the Erik Rhodes part and Helen
Broderick in the Helen Broderick part.
Plays Sunday with "The Band
Wagon."

sour tone and the tastefully boring style
of the production, Goldman's depiction
of the royal family as petty, squabbling
egotists might be amusing. Katharine
Hepburn's power is diminished by a
slightly depressing sentimentality (as it
has been in almost all of her subsequent
appearances, too), but Peter O'Toole
gives a near-great performance as King
Henry. (He had played a much younger,
randier Henry in "Becket" four years
earlier.) Anthony Hopkins, Nigel Terry
and Timothy Dalton play the sibling
princes.
Plays tonight at 9.
Live and Let Die (1973)
Memorial Auditorium

Roger Moore began his tenure in the
James Bond pictures with this particu
larly silly, pretty enjoyable adventure
about voodoo; after Sean Connery, he
seemed distinctly declasse, but at least he
was less inept than George Lazenby
(who had played Bond in "On Her
Majesty's Secret Service"). The plot
placed Bond squarely in the territory of
the race war movies so popular in 1972
and 1973, but the film is far from offen
sive. Guy Hamilton directed a cast that
included Yaphet Kotto, Jane Seymour,
Clifton James, David Hedison and Ber
nard Lee; the best part of the movie is
the intriguing title sequence featuring the
theme song (performed by Paul
McCartney and Wings).
Plays Sunday at 7 and 9:30.
Sweet Smell of Success (1956)
Cedar, San Francisco
As J.J., the vicious gossip columnist,
and Sidney Falco, the desperately am
bitious publicity agent, Burt Lancaster

and Tony Curtis do some of the best
work of their respective careers. (Curtis
has probably never been better — not
even in "Some Like It Hot") The film is
superb, and supremely entertaining; Al
exander Mackendrick, a tight, con
trolled, underrated director, provides
exactly the right scorched urban milieu
for the extravagant, mock-poetic
dialogue by Clifford Odets and Ernest
Lehman (out of Lehman's novelette) —
certainly Odets' most successful dialogue
since his heyday with the Group Theatre
in the mid-19305. ("What's this kid
got?" J.J. asks about the earnest young
hero, played by Martin Milner.
"Integrity. Acute. Like indigestion," Sid
ney replies.) Milner and Susan Harrison
are insipid as the young lovers, but noth
ing else in the movie rates that descrip
tion. With Sam Levene and, memorably,
Barbara Nichols as Rita, the cigarette
girl; shot by James Wong Howe; jazz
music scored by Elmer Bernstein and
played by the Chico Hamilton Quintet.
Plays today v and tomorrow with

"Scandal Sheet."
Swing Time (1936)
U.C. Theater, Berkeley
Perhaps the best of all the Astaire-
Rogers musicals, though the script (by
Howard Lindsay and Allan Scott) sags a
little. This time Fred is a famous dancer
who pretends to have two left feet so that
he can take lessons from Ginger, a dance
instructor at Eric Blore's school. The
magnificent songs (by Jerome Kern and
Dorothy Fields) are, in several cases,
more dramatically integrated than in
most of the series, and one triumphant
number follows another: "Pick Yourself
Up," "The Way You Look Tonight"
(which Fred sings to Ginger from an ad
joining room as she washes her hair),
"Waltz in Swing Time," "A Fine
Romance" (the duet in the snow),
"Bojangles of Harlem" (Astaire's tribute
to Bill "Bojangles" Robinson), and best
of all the pas de deux on the twin stair
ways, "Never Gonna Dance." ("The
Way You Look Tonight" took the Oscar
for Best Song.) George Stevens directed;
with Victor Moore in the Edward
Everett Horton part, Georges Metaxa in
the Erik Rhodes part and Helen
Broderick in the Helen Broderick part.
Plays Sunday with "The Band
Wagon."
