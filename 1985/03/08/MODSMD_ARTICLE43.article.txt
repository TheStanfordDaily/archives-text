## Forum examines Oregon's Rajneesh cult 
### SCOTT PARKER 
The philosophy of the Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh
is an "attempt to blend Eastern spiritual values and
Western material values," a former religious
studies professor told an audience of about 70 last
night in Roble Hall.
For example, while the residents of the Eastern
Oregon commune led by the Bhagwan live in
simple trailers or tents, the Bhagwan tours Raj
neeshpuram once daily in one of his 70 Rolls
Royces, said Michael O'Sullivan, formerly of the
San Diego State religious studies department.
The Rajneeshees are a group ot followers of the
Bhagwan. The Bhagwan established the central
Oregon commune in 1981 on a ranch which he
renamed Rajneeshpuram. The Rajneeshees also
took over political control of a small town near the
commune, formerly known as Antelope, which
they renamed Rajneesh.
O'Sullivan, granted a personal interview with the
Bhagwan in 1983 when he was an associate profes

sor at San Diego State, now works for the Voice of
America radio network.
The Bhagwan's philosophy is taken from various
traditions, according to O'Sullivan. "He took the
Indian term 'sannyasin," which means one who
renounces the world, and coined the word 'neo
sannyasin,' which he calls his follower, a new san
nyasin, who does not reject the world but embraces
it,"he explained.
"I think he's most influenced by Buddhism and is
especially rooted in the Zen tradition," O'Sullivan
said. O'Sullivan referred to the Bhagwan's rejec
tion of all previous religious traditions as evidence
of the influence of Zen in his philosophy.
The Rajneeshees themselves are not average
Oregonians. O'Sullivan cited a University of
Oregon study which found that Rajneeshees were,
on the average, more highly educated than the state
norm, with 64 percent of them possessing univer
sity degrees, 12 percent of which were doctorates.
Rajneeshees also shared another trait: "Over 90

percent were searching for a more meaningful exis
tence" before joining the following, according to
O'Sullivan.
O'Sullivan avoided calling the group a "cult," at
least in the popular, pejorative sense. "I think it is a
religion," he said.
Allegiance to the group is maintained by four
promises a new Rajneeshee makes when he or she
becomes a neo-sannyasin. or a member of the
group. The recruit promises to wear red clothing,
take a new name, wear a mola — a beaded
necklace with the Bhagwan's picture hanging from
it — and meditate every day.
The three Rajneeshees in attendance also gave
their views on the Rajneesh philosophy. Sonya
Triendl described it as "freedom, taking things
easy."
Sonya's husband, Ernest, was more explicit.
"Your own direct experience is what counts," he
said. "Everything else is bullshit."
