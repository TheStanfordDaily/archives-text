# Coffee and cholesterol
## Stanford study finds a correlation between the two 
### PATRICK LIN Editorial staff 
Stanford researchers have found a correlation between
coffee consumption and cholesterol levels, according to a
study released yesterday.
Men who drink more than three cups of coffee a day
were found to have significantly elevated levels of choles
terol and apolipoprotein B, a cholesterol-associated
protein, according to the researchers.
Elevated cholesterol levels are believed to be an impor
tant factor in getting arteriosclerosis and heart disease, the
No. 1 cause of death in the United States.
The research was conducted by Paul Williams, director
of data management for the Stanford Center for Research
in Disease Prevention, and his colleagues. Their findings
are published in today's issue of the Journal of the
American Medical Association.
At a press conference yesterday, Williams stressed that
the study "doesn't prove a causal relationship" between
drinking large quantities of coffee and high cholesterol
levels.
However, the study did show a striking correlation that
was not related to other factors, such as diet, exercise, cig
arette smoking and obesity.
According to Williams, previous European studies have
also demonstrated a relationship between coffee and
cholesterol. However, said Williams, these studies have
been criticized in this country because they did not rule
out those other factors.
The motivation for the Stanford study, said Williams,
was to take into account these other factors and to deter
mine whether coffee by itself correlated with cholesterol
levels.
Indeed, Williams and his colleagues reported that "the
significant association observed between coffee and
lipoprotein concentrations .., could not be attributed to
effects caused by age, cigarette smoking, adiposity,
aerobic fitness or other dietary factors or to any of the
psychological variables."
The Stanford study contradicts previous U.S. studies
which have claimed that no relationship exists between
coffee consumption and cholesterol levels.
Williams attributed the discrepancy to a number of fac
tors. For example, the Stanford study looked at individual
components of blood cholesterol whereas other studies
merely assessed total blood cholesterol.
Two components — low density lipoprotein (LDL)
cholesterol and apolipoprotein B — were found by Wil
liams and his co-workers to be significantly elevated in
men who drank more than three cups of coffee a day.
These two components are believed to be more directly
related to arteriosclerosis than total cholesterol, and they
are good indicators for the risk of heart disease.

Williams' study also differed from previous studies in
that the Stanford study carefully recorded coffee intake
and other factors — such as dietary intake — over a three
day period. In contrast, other studies tended to use ques
tionnaires that broadly categorized intake.
The study done by Williams involved 77 men, ranging
in age from 30 to 55. All led sedentary lives — that is,
none of the men took part in an active exercise program.

According to Dr. Peter Wood, a medical school profes
sor and one of the investigators in the project, the average
cholesterol level of men who drank more than three cups
of coffee reached sufficiently high levels that steps should
be taken to lower the blood cholesterol.
Williams and his colleagues are currently planning
follow-up studies they hope will answer some important
questions.
One question is whether coffee actually causes high
cholesterol levels, rather than just being associated with
elevated blood cholesterol.
Another question is whether caffeine or some other

substance in coffee is associated with
high cholesterol. In particular, the
planned study will try to determine
whether drinking decaffeinated cof
fee has an effect on cholesterol levels.
When asked whether people
should alter their coffee-drinking be
havior in light of the new study,

Wood replied, "I would suggest that
people be moderate and drink two
cups or less a day."
But Wood added that "we've got to
look at the overall picture" and
realize that a number of factors con
tribute to an individual's cholesteral
level.
"It's a matter of balancing the dif
ferent influences" on cholesteral.
Wood said, "and we're just saying
that coffee is an independent one."
