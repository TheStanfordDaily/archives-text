# Panel decries Reagan's policy in Nicaragua
## 
### CLAY CALVERT Senior staff writer 
Charging that the United States is led by
"a lawless president," Leonard Boudin,
the self-proclaimed father of Nicaragua's
World Court lawsuit against U.S. action in
that country, blasted the Reagan adminis
tration's Central American policy last
night before a.crowd of more than 250.
The visiting professor of law, along with
Political Science Prof. Richard Fagen and
Gretchcn Neumann, a family practitioner
who recently returned from Nicaragua,
were the featured speakers at the Cubber
ley Auditorium forum, "U.S. versus
Nicaragua: The Case Against the
'Contras.' "
Sponsored by several organizations in
cluding the Stanford Central America Ac
tion Network (SCAAN) and the Faculty
Committee on Nicaragua, the meeting
featured heated argument against U.S. in
tervention in the affairs of the embattled
Central American nation.
"The executive branch of the govern

ment, with a compliant Congress, (began]
engaging in military and paramilitary
operations in Nicaragua within six weeks"
of Reagan's 1981 inauguration, Boudin
said, adding that CIA support and action
in the country "is real, sometimes covert."
On April 6, 1984, three days before
Nicaragua brought charges against the
United States for the mining of Nic
aragua harbors, the Reagan administra
tion called for U.S. withdrawal from the
World Court.
Boudin said U.S. withdrawal from the
court is an admission "of the serious
charges made against it" by the
Nicaraguan government. Calling the U.S.
withdrawal from the court "a pre-emptive
legal strike," Boudin asked the audience,
"What kind of anarchy is the United States
turning the world into?"
Boudin said U.S. action in Nicaragua vi
olates U.N. charters against military ag
gression and internal intervention in the
affairs of other countries.
"The law is so damninc aeainst what the

United States is doing," Boudin said, call
ing the mining of Nicaraguan harbors "an
act of war."
There is an "essential dishonesty and
lack of foundation that is being offered in
our name" by the president, Boudin said,
encouraging audience members to write
letters to and speak with congressmen
about the administration's actions.
"Since when is it our role to bring
democracy to other countries?" Boudin
asked the crowd. He pointed to the failed
versions of democracy the United States
tried to establish in Chile and Iran as ex
amples of the futility of past government
intervention policies.
Boudin said there is a "deadly parallel"
between the current action in Nicaragua
and the 1954 U.S.-backed overthrow of
the Guatemalan government. The United
States "ended democracy in Guatemala 30
years ago," he added.
Fagen. speaking on the history of U.S.
relations with Nicaragua, said U.S. inter
vention in that country dates back to 1555.

when William Walker led an overthrow of
the country's government. In 1912, for "a
variety of excuses," Marines bega.i occu
pation of the country before turning over
control to the U.S.-backed government of
Anastosia Somoza Garcia in 1933, he said.
The Somoza government lasted until the
1979 overthrow by the Sandinista National
Liberation Front, Fagen said. The United
States' secret war on the Sandinista gov
ernment began in March 1981 when the
Reagan administration began "clandestine
operations" to stop the alleged arms flow
from Nicaragua to El Salvador.
Fagen said the United States is involved
in "a full-scale boarder war" with
Nicaragua, adding that $300 million in
"U.S.-sponsored aid" goes to support the
contras and action against Nicaragua.
"This is no penny-ante skirmish," Fagen
said.
Fagen said Reagan's views of Central
America appeal to a "very widely shared
