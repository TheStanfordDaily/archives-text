Salvadoran rebels kill army officer
SAN SALVADOR — Gunmen shot and killed the Salvadoran armed
forces* chief spokesman here yesterday in an action tfiat apparently was
part of a recent increase in left-wing guerrilla attacks in the capital.
The gunmen shot Lt. Col. Ricardo Cienfuegos, director of the Armed
Forces Press Committee, on a tennis court at a sports club at about mid
day. They draped a red banner over his body, marked with large yellow
letters reading "FPL." Those are the Spanish initials of the Popular
Liberation Forces, one of the two largest factions in the left-wing guer
rilla alliance called the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front.
Cienfuegos was the first prominent victim to die in the capital in an
apparent attack by left-wing guerrillas since a U.S. military adviser was
gunned down in May 1983. Salvadoran and U.S. officials have said
recently that the guerrillas were moving some of their combatants into
San Salvador because of their lack of success in the countryside in the
past year.
Although the FPL flag pointed to the guerrillas as the killers, there so
far have been no public claims by any group.
"The left has adopted a policy of urban destabilization," President
Jose Napoleon Duarte said moments after learning of Cienfuegos' mur
der. He cited both a recent spate of political killings by the left and a se
ries of strikes by government employees' unions sympathetic to the left.
El Salvador's left-wing guerrillas were active in the capital in the late
1970s and in 1980, but they shut down most of their operations begin
ning in 1981 because of stepped-up countermeasures, including killings
of numerous suspected leftist sympathizers. Until late last year, the
Farabundo Marti front concentrated almost all of its fighting in the
countryside north of the capital and in the eastern part of the country.
In recent months, however, both government officials and guerrilla
leaders have said that the left was seeking to rebuild its urban base. This
appeared to be a reaction to the Army's improved performance in the
countryside, where the government has had the military initiative for
more than a year.' ,
Soviets express sincerity on talks
MOSCOW — The ruling Soviet Politburo yesterday approved
directives for Soviet negotiators at nuclear arms control talks with the
United States opening Tuesday in Geneva, Switzerland, saying the
Soviets would be sincere in seeking an end to the arms race, the Tass
news agency said.
"The Soviet side will act energetically and Constructively, proceeding
from the principle of equality and equal security. ..the official news
agency reported after the regular weekly meeting of the Politburo.
The Geneva conference can provide an opportunity to prevent the
spread of the arms race to outer spce and halt it on earth, the Tass
statement said, if both sides are prepared to achieve this.
Meantime, U.S. sincerity was challenged anew by Georgi Arbator,
director of the U.S.A. and Canada Institute, in an interview with the
Communist youth newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda.
"We have now come to a point in the history of Soviet-U.S. relations
when it is clear . .. that a resolute turn must be taken towards their nor
malization, towards stopping the arms race and easing tensions," Ar
batov said.
"On the other hand, there exists a great danger that such a turn may
not take place and, if so, a serious threat to the international situation
will arise," he added.
Even U.S. delay in making decisions, Arbatov said, may make it diffi
cult if not impossible to reach agreement, thus creating a "serious threat
to the international situation." Arbatov charged that recent American
accusations of nculear arms violations by the Soviet Union were de
signed to raise doubts about its trustworthiness, lessening the chances for
an accord at Geneva.
Israeli and Lebanese forces clash
BEIRUT — Israeli and Lebanese forces fought a three-hour battle
with tanks and light weapons yesterday at the edge of Israel's occupation
zone in southern Lebanon.
One Israeli soldier was killed and five Lebanese were reported
wounded in the exchange.
The clash, the second between the two armies in about two weeks,
took place at the village of Kawthariet Assayad, which is about 10 miles
south of the Lebanese seaport of Sidon.
The two sides gave differing accounts of the battle.
A Lebanese army communique said the Israelis advanced on the vil
lage, which is the Lebanese army's forward line in the south, behind a
screen of tank cannon fire at about 8:15 a.m.
The Lebanese returned the fire "with all available weapons," accord
ing to the communique. One report said that regular Lebanese army
troops were joined by Druse and Shia Moslem militiamen.
The fighting blazed for nearly three hours, according to Beirut radio
stations, and the Israelis finally pulled back to their front line positions in
the town of Sharqiyeh to the south.
The Israelis said the fighting began after patroling Israeli troops
pursued a Lebanese car containing suspects after it did not stop at a
checkpoint.
"In the course of the pursuit," an Israeli military statement said, "a
Lebanese army force stationed in the area . . . opened fire on our sol
diers." Military sources confirmed that the Israelis had returned the fire,
and an Israeli military spokesman reported that one Israeli soldier had
been killed.
At one point, according to Beirut radio reports, the Israelis brought in
heliopter gunships to coordinate the artillery fire. Altogether, the
Lebanese said, about 25 Israeli shells hit the village of Kawthariet As
sayad, heavily damaging several houses in addition to wounding four
militiamen and one Lebanese soldier.
South African oil freeze called for
LUSAKA, Zambia — Africa People's Organization
and the banned African National Congress announced here yesterday a
worldwide campaign aimed at persuading world governments, organiza
tions and individual investors to impose oil sanctions against South
Africa.
At ceremony at the United Nations institute for Namibia to launch the
campaign, Sam Nujoma president of the Namibia-based SWAPO and
Oliver Tambo president of the South African-base ANC, said they were
convinced the South African regime could be forced to abandon apar
theid if the world denied it oil.
They expressed disappointment that although the U.N. General As
sembly had adopted a resolution in 1979 calling for an oil embargo
against South Africa, no action had as yet been taken.
"To this day, Pretoria continues to meet its oil needs with the aid of
governments, companies j'.nd individuals who permit and facilitate the
supply and transport of crude oil" and who provide financing, capital
equipment and technology for South Africa's oil industry and for
prospecting and development of resources in South Africa and Namibia,
they said.
Thais fight to repulse Vietnamese
BANGKOK, Thailand — Thai forces fought for a third day to repulse
Vietnamese troops who crossed the Thai-Cambodian border in an as
sault on a Cambodian resistance camp, and lightly armed guerrillas
defending the cliff-top camp continued to hold out against their rein
forced attackers; Thai military officials and Western diplomats said yes
terday.
Thai authorities said 14 Thai soldiers had been killed in the three days
of fighting, three others were missing and 35 were wounded. In addition,
they said, 15 Thai civilians were killed by Vietnamese shelling or
gunfire.
Thai military officials said more than 70 Vietnamese troops had been
killed in the cross-border operation.
In their most successful dry-season offensive along the border since
invading Cambodia in December 1978, the Vietnamese have overrun all
but one of about 20 guerrilla bases on the Cambodian side of the 450-
mile frontier since November.

will arise," he added.
Even U.S. delay in making decisions, Arbatov said, may make it diffi
cult if not impossible to reach agreement, thus creating a "serious threat
to the international situation." Arbatov charged that recent American
accusations of nculear arms violations by the Soviet Union were de
signed to raise doubts about its trustworthiness, lessening the chances for
an accord at Geneva.
Israeli and Lebanese forces clash
BEIRUT — Israeli and Lebanese forces fought a three-hour battle
with tanks and light weapons yesterday at the edge of Israel's occupation
zone in southern Lebanon.
One Israeli soldier was killed and five Lebanese were reported
wounded in the exchange.
The clash, the second between the two armies in about two weeks,
took place at the village of Kawthariet Assayad, which is about 10 miles
south of the Lebanese seaport of Sidon.
The two sides gave differing accounts of the battle.
A Lebanese army communique said the Israelis advanced on the vil
lage, which is the Lebanese army's forward line in the south, behind a
screen of tank cannon fire at about 8:15 a.m.
The Lebanese returned the fire "with all available weapons," accord
ing to the communique. One report said that regular Lebanese army
troops were joined by Druse and Shia Moslem militiamen.
The fighting blazed for nearly three hours, according to Beirut radio
stations, and the Israelis finally pulled back to their front line positions in
the town of Sharqiyeh to the south.
The Israelis said the fighting began after patroling Israeli troops
pursued a Lebanese car containing suspects after it did not stop at a
checkpoint.
"In the course of the pursuit," an Israeli military statement said, "a
Lebanese army force stationed in the area . . . opened fire on our sol
diers." Military sources confirmed that the Israelis had returned the fire,
and an Israeli military spokesman reported that one Israeli soldier had
been killed.
At one point, according to Beirut radio reports, the Israelis brought in
heliopter gunships to coordinate the artillery fire. Altogether, the
Lebanese said, about 25 Israeli shells hit the village of Kawthariet As
sayad, heavily damaging several houses in addition to wounding four
militiamen and one Lebanese soldier.
South African oil freeze called for
LUSAKA, Zambia — Africa People's Organization
and the banned African National Congress announced here yesterday a
worldwide campaign aimed at persuading world governments, organiza
tions and individual investors to impose oil sanctions against South
Africa.
At ceremony at the United Nations institute for Namibia to launch the
campaign, Sam Nujoma president of the Namibia-based SWAPO and
Oliver Tambo president of the South African-base ANC, said they were
convinced the South African regime could be forced to abandon apar
theid if the world denied it oil.
They expressed disappointment that although the U.N. General As
sembly had adopted a resolution in 1979 calling for an oil embargo
against South Africa, no action had as yet been taken.
"To this day, Pretoria continues to meet its oil needs with the aid of
governments, companies j'.nd individuals who permit and facilitate the
supply and transport of crude oil" and who provide financing, capital
equipment and technology for South Africa's oil industry and for
prospecting and development of resources in South Africa and Namibia,
they said.
Thais fight to repulse Vietnamese
BANGKOK, Thailand — Thai forces fought for a third day to repulse
Vietnamese troops who crossed the Thai-Cambodian border in an as
sault on a Cambodian resistance camp, and lightly armed guerrillas
defending the cliff-top camp continued to hold out against their rein
forced attackers; Thai military officials and Western diplomats said yes
terday.
Thai authorities said 14 Thai soldiers had been killed in the three days
of fighting, three others were missing and 35 were wounded. In addition,
they said, 15 Thai civilians were killed by Vietnamese shelling or
gunfire.
Thai military officials said more than 70 Vietnamese troops had been
killed in the cross-border operation.
In their most successful dry-season offensive along the border since
invading Cambodia in December 1978, the Vietnamese have overrun all
but one of about 20 guerrilla bases on the Cambodian side of the 450-
mile frontier since November.
Salvadoran rebels kill army officer
SAN SALVADOR — Gunmen shot and killed the Salvadoran armed
forces* chief spokesman here yesterday in an action tfiat apparently was
part of a recent increase in left-wing guerrilla attacks in the capital.
The gunmen shot Lt. Col. Ricardo Cienfuegos, director of the Armed
Forces Press Committee, on a tennis court at a sports club at about mid
day. They draped a red banner over his body, marked with large yellow
letters reading "FPL." Those are the Spanish initials of the Popular
Liberation Forces, one of the two largest factions in the left-wing guer
rilla alliance called the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front.
Cienfuegos was the first prominent victim to die in the capital in an
apparent attack by left-wing guerrillas since a U.S. military adviser was
gunned down in May 1983. Salvadoran and U.S. officials have said
recently that the guerrillas were moving some of their combatants into
San Salvador because of their lack of success in the countryside in the
past year.
Although the FPL flag pointed to the guerrillas as the killers, there so
far have been no public claims by any group.
"The left has adopted a policy of urban destabilization," President
Jose Napoleon Duarte said moments after learning of Cienfuegos' mur
der. He cited both a recent spate of political killings by the left and a se
ries of strikes by government employees' unions sympathetic to the left.
El Salvador's left-wing guerrillas were active in the capital in the late
1970s and in 1980, but they shut down most of their operations begin
ning in 1981 because of stepped-up countermeasures, including killings
of numerous suspected leftist sympathizers. Until late last year, the
Farabundo Marti front concentrated almost all of its fighting in the
countryside north of the capital and in the eastern part of the country.
In recent months, however, both government officials and guerrilla
leaders have said that the left was seeking to rebuild its urban base. This
appeared to be a reaction to the Army's improved performance in the
countryside, where the government has had the military initiative for
more than a year.' ,
Soviets express sincerity on talks
MOSCOW — The ruling Soviet Politburo yesterday approved
directives for Soviet negotiators at nuclear arms control talks with the
United States opening Tuesday in Geneva, Switzerland, saying the
Soviets would be sincere in seeking an end to the arms race, the Tass
news agency said.
"The Soviet side will act energetically and Constructively, proceeding
from the principle of equality and equal security. ..the official news
agency reported after the regular weekly meeting of the Politburo.
The Geneva conference can provide an opportunity to prevent the
spread of the arms race to outer spce and halt it on earth, the Tass
statement said, if both sides are prepared to achieve this.
Meantime, U.S. sincerity was challenged anew by Georgi Arbator,
director of the U.S.A. and Canada Institute, in an interview with the
Communist youth newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda.
"We have now come to a point in the history of Soviet-U.S. relations
when it is clear . .. that a resolute turn must be taken towards their nor
malization, towards stopping the arms race and easing tensions," Ar
batov said.
"On the other hand, there exists a great danger that such a turn may
not take place and, if so, a serious threat to the international situation
will arise," he added.
