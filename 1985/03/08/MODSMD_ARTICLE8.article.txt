# Panel rejects student aid cuts
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Senate Budget Com
mittee yesterday rejected many of President
Reagan's most controversial proposed spending
cuts, including the elimination of Amtrak and mass
transit subsidies and curbs on federal student loans.
And the committee reached a stalemate over
whether to deny cost-of-living increases to Social
Security recipients next year, which is an impasse
that threatens to sabotage the Senate's entire effort
to put together a deficit reduction package.
As the committee voted down one after another
of Reagan's proposed cuts — opting in most cases
to freeze spending at current levels — it also
slipped further away from Budget Committee
Chairman Pete Domenici's goal of reducing the
projected 1986 deficit by $60 billion from the level
it would reach if spending growth continued un
checked.
During its fourth day of putting together its
budget recommendation for fiscal 1986, which
begins Oct. 1, the committee:
• voted 11 -10 to leave the federal student loan pro
gram virtually intact. The committee approved a
plan by Sen. Lawton Chiles (D-Fla.) to reject the
administration's proposal to cap loans and grants at
$4,000 a year and exclude families earning more
than $25,000 from the grant program and $32,500
from the loan program.
• rejected 13-9 the administration's proposal to
abolish Amtrak, opting instead to freeze spending
for the government-operated railroad and other
federal transportation programs. It also froze tran

sit subsidies.
• voted unanimously to reject an administration
proposal that would have required Medicare
recipients to pay greater out-of-pocket medical ex
penses — both premiums and deductibles — al
though the committee would allow a freeze on
federal reimbursement levels to hospitals, doctors
and others who provide health care to the elderly
under the program.
• voted 13-5 to allow the Medicaid health care pro
gram for low-income people to continue to operate
at its present level, with growth for projected infla
tion and caseload. The Reagan administration had
recommended capping Medicaid at $1 billion lower
than that amount.
• voted 10-8 to freeze a wide range of community
and regional programs, rather than end such
popular subsidies as urban development action
grants as the administration had asked.
Domenici (R-N.M.) said after the Social Security
vote that Senate liberals will apparently accept cuts
in Social Security and other benefit programs only
if the Senate also approves a tax increase or addi
tional defense spending cuts. But other committee
members said the prospects are dim that con
servatives would accept either of those alternatives.
On Social Security, the committee rejected all
the choices before it: freezing Social Security
benefits next year; freezing them for all but the
poor; and allowing them to grow with inflation for
everyone.
Domenici said, "That told me that, contrary to

what I had thought, there is substantial support for
freezing the (cost-of-living increase) if we come up
with the right package at the end." That packager
he said, would probably contain either tax increases
or defense spending cuts. I
The committee already has voted to let defense;
spending grow only with inflation in fiscal 1986»
compared with the nearly 6 percent after-inflatioi{
growth sought by Reagan. Even one of the
strongest advocates of tightening further — forbid-*
ding even inflation-driven growth — conceded tha{
even that would not guarantee sufficient liberal
support for corresponding domestic spending cuts.,
"If you really want to nail it down and get
enough votes from the Democrats," said Sen»
Charles Grassley (R-Iowa), the only answer would
be "probably a little tax increase."
But a tax hike remains appears to be only a
remote possibility. Budget Committee member
Bob Kasten (R-Wis.) predicted that Reagan would
veto any tax increase and that Congress would lack
the two-thirds majorities needed to override him:
Referring to Walter Mondale, last year's Demo
cratic presidential candidate, Kasten said, "It was a
tax increase statement that lost 49 states for the
Democrats."
The Budget Committee does not have the power
to engineer a tax package, but its final recommen
dation could contain a tax-increase target that, if
approved by the full Senate, would instruct the
Finance Committee to decide which taxes should
be raised.
