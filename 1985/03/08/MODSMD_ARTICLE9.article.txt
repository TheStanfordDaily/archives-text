# Shultz moves to deny Nicaragua loan
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Secretary of
State George Shultz has personally
intervened with the president of the
Inter-American Development Bank
to block a vote on a $58 million loan
to Nicaragua in what bank officials
and Latin American diplomats des
cribed yesterday as an unprecedented
Reagan administration effort to pres
sure the institution.
In a Jan. 30 letter to bank Presi
dent Antonio Ortiz Mena, Shultz ex
pressed the administration's "strong"
opposition to the loan, and the "hope
that the Bank's management will be
able to defer the release of the
documentation" compiled by the
bank's technical staff in support of
the loan.
Detailing the administration's
belief that Nicaragua is "not credit
worthy," Shultz also noted "concern

about the possible misuse by
Nicaragua of the proceeds from such
a loan." He said the money would
"relieve financial pressures on
(Nicaragua) and free up other monies
that could be used to help consolidate
the Marxist regime and finance
Nicaragua's aggression against its
neighbors, who are members in good
standing of the Bank."
The letter went on to point out that
bank approval of the loan would
make administration efforts to pro
vide new financial contributions to
the bank "even more difficult" and
would "undercut" more general ef
forts to expand the institution's
resource base.
The Shultz letter, which sources
said yesterday was preceded by a per
sonal telephone call to Ortiz Mena,
follows more than two years of con
troversy over the loan to Nicaragua.

The $58 million would provide finan
cial credits for small and medium
farmers and purchase supplies
needed for the production of basic
foods.
Usually, a senior bank officer said
yesterday, member opposition to a
loan for whatever reason is expressed
by one of the 12 directors, represent
ing 43 member countries, "on the
basis of the loans not being techni
cally justified. There has never been
anything like this."
A copy of the letter was obtained
by The Washington Post, and its con
tents were verified both by bank offi
cials and by the State Department. A
department statement yesterday said
that the letter was a "reiteration of
longstanding U.S. policy to weigh
heavily when evaluating loans pro
posed by multilateral development

banks the macroeconomic policies
pursued by the benefiting countries."
For the past four years, the admin
istration has maintained a policy of
economic, political and military pres
sure against the Sandinistas on
grounds that they have attempted to
"export" their leftist revolution to
neighboring Central American;
countries. In international lending in
stitutions, U.S. officials have argued!
that the Nicaraguan economy is in;
such bad shape, and its leftist eco
nomic policies so destined to failure,,
that lending is unadvisable.
A State Department official who
declined to be identified said yester
day of the Shultz letter that it
"shouldn't come as a great surprise tcj
anybody that we favor loans to
friendly countries and discourage
them to unfriendly countries."
