## Soviet leader Chernenko dies 
### TROY EID Editorial staff With wire reports 
Konstantin Chernenko, the third
Soviet leader in as many years, is
dead, the Soviet news agency Tass re
ported this morning.
There was no immediate word of a
successor, although Western experts
have said Mikhail Gorbachev and
Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko —
both members of the Communist
Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU)
Central Committee's ruling Politburo
— may attempt to forge a power
sharing arrangement. Other possible
candidates include Politburo mem
bers Viktor Grishin and Gregori
Romanov.
Chernenko, 73, CPSU general sec
retary and president of the Presidium
of the Supreme Soviet, became the
oldest person ever to lead the Krem
lin when he assumed power 13
months ago amid rumors of failed
health. Observers said he suffered

from emphysema.
At 4 a.m. Washington time. Na
tional Security Adviser Robert
McFarlane awakened President
Reagan, saying Tass was preparing to
make a "major announcement"
about Chernenko, according to a
White House official who requested
anonymity. McFarlane told Reagan
that foreign news media in Moscow
were reporting the Soviet announce
ment would be of Chernenko's death,
the official said. _
Speculation on Chernenko's death
was triggered early last night when
the highest ranking Soviet delegation
to visit the United States in more than
a decade, in San Francisco and sched
uled to visit Stanford today, canceled
its engagements and asked to return
to Moscow.
That delegatus, which arrived in
the Bay Area yesterday afternoon,
has been in the United States since
March 3 and is under the leadership
of Vladimir Shcherbitsky, secretary

of the Ukrainian Republic Commu
nist Party and a member of the Polit
buro. It was to stop in New York
before returning to Moscow on a spe
cial Aeroflot flight departing at 5 a.m.
today, according to senior U.S. offi
cials speaking on the condition they
not be named.
The Soviet plane is flying from
Havana to New York to meet the
delegation, the officials said.
A spokesman for the U.S. mission
to international organizations based
in Geneva said that Vice President
George Bush, who is in the Swiss city
to make a speech today, had received
unconfirmed reports yesterday even
ing that Chernenko is dead.
A State Department spokesperson,
Vivienne Ascher, declined to spec
ulate yesterday evening that the
Shcherbitsky delegation's sudden
departure was prompted by the death
or critical illness of Chernenko. State
Department officials were un
available for comment early this

morning.
But a U.S. official, speaking on the
condition he not be identified, said,
"The speed with which the group is
returning indicates that Chernenko is
either dead or is expected to die
within a matter of hours."
McFarlane briefed Reagan yester
day evening on the Soviet delega
tion's request for U.S. assistance in
arranging a quick flight home. Dep
uty White House Press Secretary
Robert Sims said.
Politburo member Vitaly Vorot
nikov also returned to Moscow from
Yugoslavia yesterday, but it was not
immediately clear whether he came
back earlier than planned. Vorot
nikov reportedly flew directly to
Moscow from Titograd instead of
going back through the capital city,
Belgrade.
