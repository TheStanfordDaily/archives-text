## Soviet leader Chernenko dies 
### TROY EID Editorial staff With wire reports 
Konstantin Chernenko, the third
Soviet leader in as many years, is
dead, the Soviet news agency Tass re
ported this morning.
There was no immediate word of a
successor, although Western experts
have said Mikhail Gorbachev and
Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko —
both members of the Communist
Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU)
Central Committee's ruling Politburo
— may attempt to forge a power
sharing arrangement. Other possible
candidates include Politburo mem
bers Viktor Grishin and Gregori
Romanov.
Chernenko, 73, CPSU general sec
retary and president of the Presidium
of the Supreme Soviet, became the
oldest person ever to lead the Krem
lin when he assumed power 13
months ago amid rumors of failed
health. Observers said he suffered

from emphysema.
At 4 a.m. Washington time. Na
tional Security Adviser Robert
McFarlane awakened President
Reagan, saying Tass was preparing to
make a "major announcement"
about Chernenko, according to a
White House official who requested
anonymity. McFarlane told Reagan
that foreign news media in Moscow
were reporting the Soviet announce
ment would be of Chernenko's death,
the official said. _
Speculation on Chernenko's death
was triggered early last night when
the highest ranking Soviet delegation
to visit the United States in more than
a decade, in San Francisco and sched
uled to visit Stanford today, canceled
its engagements and asked to return
to Moscow.
That delegatus, which arrived in
the Bay Area yesterday afternoon,
has been in the United States since
March 3 and is under the leadership
of Vladimir Shcherbitsky, secretary

of the Ukrainian Republic Commu
nist Party and a member of the Polit
buro. It was to stop in New York
before returning to Moscow on a spe
cial Aeroflot flight departing at 5 a.m.
today, according to senior U.S. offi
cials speaking on the condition they
not be named.
The Soviet plane is flying from
Havana to New York to meet the
delegation, the officials said.
A spokesman for the U.S. mission
to international organizations based
in Geneva said that Vice President
George Bush, who is in the Swiss city
to make a speech today, had received
unconfirmed reports yesterday even
ing that Chernenko is dead.
A State Department spokesperson,
Vivienne Ascher, declined to spec
ulate yesterday evening that the
Shcherbitsky delegation's sudden
departure was prompted by the death
or critical illness of Chernenko. State
Department officials were un
available for comment early this

morning.
But a U.S. official, speaking on the
condition he not be identified, said,
"The speed with which the group is
returning indicates that Chernenko is
either dead or is expected to die
within a matter of hours."
McFarlane briefed Reagan yester
day evening on the Soviet delega
tion's request for U.S. assistance in
arranging a quick flight home. Dep
uty White House Press Secretary
Robert Sims said.
Politburo member Vitaly Vorot
nikov also returned to Moscow from
Yugoslavia yesterday, but it was not
immediately clear whether he came
back earlier than planned. Vorot
nikov reportedly flew directly to
Moscow from Titograd instead of
going back through the capital city,
Belgrade.

The Soviet Union announced this morning that President Konstantin
Chernenko has died.
the past signaled a death in the lead
ership. In December, Gorbachev, cut
short a visit to Great Britain by one
day. He then broke precedent by an
nouncing Defense Minister Dmitri
Ustinov's death before the official an
nouncement in Moscow.
Earlier yesterday evening, officials
of the British Broadcasting Corp. re
ported program changes in Soviet
domestic radio broadcasts, saying
"fairly somber classical music is being
played." An official at the U.S. Em
bassy in Moscow later confirmed that
Radio Moscow had switched from a
comedy program to classical music,
according to an administration
spokesman.
An abrupt switch to classical music
also preceeded the announcement of
the deaths of Chernenko's predeces
sors — Yuri Andropov in February
1984 and Leonid Brezhnev in No
vember 1982.
Sources in Moscow said half a
dozen large black cars assigned to top
officials were parked in front of the
headquarters of the Central Commit
tee before 8 a.m. local time. In addi
tion, some of the bigger Chaika
chauffeured limousines were cruising
in the area. Before dawn, a passing
journalist spotted lights in Kremlin
buildings that would normally be
dark over the three-day holiday
weekend held in observance of Inter
national Women's Day.
By yesterday evening, reports circ
ulated in Geneva, where nuclear arms
talks with the Soviets are to open to
morrow, and in Washington that
Chernenko was dead. One report
quoted a member of the Soviet
delegation in San Francisco as saying
flatly that Chernenko had died, but
U.S. officials would not comment on
that report.
During Chernenko's last public ap
pearance, on Feb. 28 when he
received his credentials to the Rus
sian Republic's parliament, he
struggled for breath while giving a
speech.
Earlier that week, Chernenko was
seen voting during elections for seats
in the Supreme Soviet, the national
parliament.
Western diplomats speculated that
the ballot box seen in the film footage
was brought to Chernenko in a hospi
tal.
At a Moscow reception Wednesday
honoring International Women's
Day, Chernenko's wife, Anna, of

fered a toast and danced with the wife
of Andrei Gromyko, New York
Times correspondent Seth Mydans
reported Saturday. "She impressed
her guests as motherly, intelligent and
in control," Mydans said.
The next day, however, the Cher
nenkos missed a Women's Day gala
at the Bolshoi Theater traditionally
attended by members of the Polit
buro.
Chernenko also dropped out of
sight for two months during the
spring of 1984, and among the events
he missed then was the May 1 Inter
national Worker's Day parade on
Red Square — traditionally a must
for high-ranking officials — because
of what officially was stated to be
pneumonia.
Chernenko rose through the party
ranks alongside his longtime ally,
Brezhnev.
He was born to Russian peasants in
the central Siberian city of Kras
noyarsk, more than 2,000 miles east
of Moscow, on Sept. 24, 1911. A
communist propagandist at 18 near
his native Krasnoyarsk, he later
became a border guard.
Chernenko became chief of a
Komsomol, or Young Communist
Youth League, department in 1929,
joined the CPSU in 1931 and 10
years later was a local party secretary.
He graduated from the Higher Farty
School in Moscow in 1945 and from
the Kishniev Pedagogical Institute in
1953.
His association with Brezhnev
began in the 19505, when he served
with Brezhnev as propaganda chief in
the southern republic of Moldavia.
In 1965, a year after Brezhnev
helped oust premier Nikita
Khrushchev from power, Chernenko
returned to Moscow to head the
CPSU general department. The post,
which he held until 1983, gave him
direct and constant contact with party
officials across the country.
Chernenko's rise occurred rapidly
by Soviet standards. In 1971, he
became a member of the Central
Committee, by 1976 a CPSU national
secretary and in 1978 was named to
the Politburo.
The Shcherbitsky delegation had
been scheduled to take a yacht cruise
on the San Francisco Bay yesterday
afternoon. But Darcy Fallon, a
reporter for the San Francisco Ex
aminer, said the group, consisting of
30 ranking Soviet officials, eluded the
press during a tour of the city and
never arrived for the scheduled
cruise.
