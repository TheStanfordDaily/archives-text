Defense firm criticized
WASHINGTON — Vice Adm. Earl Fowler,
chief of naval shipbuilding, has charged General
Dynamics Corp. with a "blatant disregard for and
breach of security regulations" after the unauth
orized release in an internal company financial
report of 19 highly sensitive photographs of the
Trident ballistic-missile submarine.
In a letter to General Dynamics Chairman
David Lewis, Fowler accused the company and
its submarine building division, Electric Boat, of
showing a "cavalier attitude" and losing control
of information "damaging to the national secur
ity."
Fowler told Lewis that a Navy assessment of
the photographs determined that they "reveal
technical information about production methods
and hull and internal structural features as well as
nuclear propulsion plant machinery arrange
ment. Information of this nature is important in
the analysis of a submarine's speed, propulsion
plant characteristics, survivability and vul
nerability."
The color photographs were included in a
dozen or more copies of a quarterly financial
report on Electric Boat. The quarterly reports
were used in presentations to Lewis and the com
pany's corporate headquarters staff at meetings
normally attended by all company division
managers and their support staffs.
A copy of the financial report containing the
photographs was provided to the Justice Depart
ment by P. Takis Veliotis, former general
manager of Electric Boat and later an executive
vice president and General Dynamics corporate
board member. He now is under indictment for
allegedly taking kickbacks on ship construction

while he worked for General Dynamics.
Veliotis, who lives in Greece and is considered
a fugitive by the Justice Department, is also
cooperating with a federal investigation of Gen
eral Dynamics.
Veliotis said Gary Grimes, his former deputy,
gave him a copy of the report containing the
photographs 10 months after Veliotis left Gen
eral Dynamics and at a time when Veliotis was
considering making a hostile takeover bid to win
control of the company.
The Trident, along with U.S. land-based
missiles and bombers, is considered the most se
cure and survivable component of the U.S.
nuclear force. It was specifically designed
with the most advanced quieting features in its
engine room and reactor compartment to foil de
tection by Soviet anti-submarine forces.
Heart patients improve
LOUISVILLE, Ky. — Artificial heart patient
William Schroeder spent 30 minutes of a sunny
afternoon riding through Louisville neighbor
hoods on his first trip away from Humana Hospi
tal, a spokeswoman said yesterday.
Schroeder became the first of the world's three
human recipients of a permanent mechanical
heart to leave hospital grounds.
"He greatly enjoyed being outside and spend
ing time with his grandchildren, who were with
him" for Saturday's spur-of-the-moment ride in
a customized van, spokeswoman Linda Broadus
said.
Schroeder, 53, of Jasper, Ind., had been in the
$45,000 van once before but the vehicle did not

leave the hospital parking lot. The van has its
own "Utah drive" equipment to provide the
pulses of air that power his heart. A portable unit
was used during the wheelchair ride to the van.
Meanwhile, Schroeder's only living peer,
retired Louisville autoworker Murray Haydon,
was upgraded from critical to serious condition
yesterday for the first time since his Feb. 17 im
plant operation, Broadus said.
Haydon — who is healing from emergency sur
gery in which doctors plugged a tiny hole in his
right atrium, to which the artificial heart is at
tached — is well enough to get a wheelchair ride
through hospital hallways and will move into a
private room soon, she said.
Bleak farm report
WASHINGTON — An unreleased
Agriculture Department report says 93,000 mid
sized U.S. farms, holding $47 billion in debt, are
technically insolvent or on the verge of going
broke — a 45 percent increase from earlier fig
ures.
The figure, amounting to 13.7 percent of such
farms that form the backbone U.S. commercial
agriculture, is considerably higher than the 4 per
cent rate cited last week by President Reagan
when he vetoed legislation intended to provide
emergency credit to farmers.
Then, Reagan said, "The truth of the matter is,
in need of immediate help are less than 4 percent
or around 4 percent at best of all the farmers in
the United States." Agriculture Secretary John
Block, questioned later about the president's
statement, said Reagan "misspoke" and really
knows the situation is far worse.
