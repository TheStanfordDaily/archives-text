CMA chief: a warning
SAN DIEGO — The outgoing president of the
California Medical Association said yesterday
the government's efforts to control health care
costs are causing more harm than good, and he
urged delegates to take an active roll in the
"battle to control the practice of medicine."
David Horner, an orthopedic surgeon from In
glewood, said flat-fee payment plans and fee
freezes that have been applied to Medicare are
ineffective and have hampered the quality and
accessiblility of health care.
"The future holds serious implications con
cerning the quality of care all Californians may
expect to receive," Horner said in his farewell
address at the 114 th annual CMA convention
being held at the Town & Country Hotel.
Clarence Avery, a surgeon from San Leandro,
will take over Horner's post as president of the
34,000-member association when the convention
adjourns Wednesday.
Meanwhile, Gladden Elliott, a La Mesa
radiologist, was chosen president-elect of the
CMA yesterday, putting him in position to head
the society in 1986.
Elliott, a clinical professor of radiology at UC-

San Diego, is past president of the California
Radiological Association and the San Diego
County Medical Society.
The CMA convention, the largest medical gat
hering in the West, is expected to attract 6,000
physicians and speakers during its six-day run,
which began Friday.
Kurt Benirshke, the research director of the
San Diego Zoo, told delegates in yesterday's
keynote address that physicians must work to
maintain the existence of endangered species,
since knowledge of human medicine can be ob
tained through caring for plants and animals.
"The loss of numerous plants and smaller
animal species is bound to have a serious impact
on man's existence," said Benirshke.
"Physicians should be particularly concerned,
since much of our medical knowledge has been
obtained by the use of animals, and most of our
drugs have a plant origin," he said.
The San Diego Zoo has established a Center
for Endangered Species, one of two such full
time research laboratories in the world.
Animal rights attack
ARCADIA — Red paint was splattered on the
house and car of a Los Angeles County animal

ler said it was a "warning" to the county to stop
selling animals for research.
"Unless the practice is changed, further
reprisals will occur," a woman who identified
herself as a member of the Animal Liberation
Front told City News Service. "This practice has
gone on for far too long in this county."
The woman, who gave her name as Patty,
telephoned the local wire service after the 2 a.m.
incident at the home of Brian Berger, director of
the county Animal Control and Care Depart
ment.
However, another woman who said she was a
spokeswoman for ALF told the Los Angeles
Times her group wasn't involved.
"We are not affiliated with the raid on Brian
Berger's house," said the woman who identified
herself only as Sydney. "We do not attack per
sonal property."
Today's weather
Continued cloudy, with a chance of showers
this afternoon. Highs in the 70s, lows in the 40s.
