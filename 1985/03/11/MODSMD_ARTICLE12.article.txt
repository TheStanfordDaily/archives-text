### INGRID SEYER Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford men's swimming team easily made it four
straight this weekend as it captured the Pacific 10 Confer
ence title at Beaverton, Ore.
The Cardinal, the No. 1 team in the nation, racked up
593 points during the three days of competition. Califor
nia was second with 547, followed by USC with 480 and
UCLA with 453.
Stanford was sparked by eight victories, five second
place finishes and numerous finishers in the top 16.
Stanford jumped out to an early 37-point lead
Thursday, increasing that lead to 61 points by the end of
Friday's competition.
The Cardinal received strong scoring from Dave Bot
tom, John Moffet, Pablo Morales, Matt Nance and Jeff
Kostoff.
Bottom, Moffet, Morales and Dave Louden swam on
the 400-yard medley relay team that set a new school
record and a national-best time, winning the event in
3:12.93.
In the breaststroke events, there was no stopping Mof
fet, the defending NCAA champion in both the 100 and
200 breaststrokes. Moffet not only won the events but
also set a meet record, a school record and a national-best
time in the process.
Moffet's time in the 100 breaststroke, 53.89, set a new
Stanford record. Moffet, a junior, set the previous record
(54.09) two years ago. Moffet swam a personal-best 53.84
earlier that same day during the time trials of that event.
In the 200, Moffet came through with a meet record

and a national-best time to boot as he swam the event in
1:57.73.
Cardinal David Lundberg followed Moffet into the
finish with a second-place time of 2:00.32 in the 200
breaststroke, came in third in the 100-yard breaststroke
(55.15) and placed eighth in the 200 individual medley
(1:49.70).
Stanford captured both of the individual medley events
with victories by Bottom and Nance.
Bottom, a senior, was victorious in the 200 IM and the
200 backstroke and placed second in the 100 butterfly
and the 200 IM.
Bottom's time in the 200 backstroke, 1:47.02, is a new
Pac-10 meet record. Freshman Sean Murphy placed
second in the event for the Cardinal with a time of
1:47.62.
In the 400 IM, another freshman came on fast for the
Cardinal. Nance captured the title in that event with a
time of 3:52.51. Kostoff, a sophomore, followed Nance
into the finish with a time of 3:53.02.
Kostoff placed fifth in the 1,650 freestyle (15:09.42)
and 10th in the 500 freestyle.
Morales, who swam the butterfly leg of the winning 400
medley relay on Thursday night, went on to win the 100
butterfly on Friday. Morales' time, 47.45, set a new
national-best time in that event. Morales also placed
seventh in the 200 IM (1:49.40).
Freshman Anthony Mosse placed sixth in the 100 but
terfly for Stanford with a time of 49.16.
The Cardinal will travel to Austin, Texas, March 28-30
to Compete in the NCAA Championships.
