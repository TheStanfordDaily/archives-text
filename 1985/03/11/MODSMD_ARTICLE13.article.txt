# Cardinal sweeps UCLA for Six-Pac lead
## 
### TOM SENF Staff sportswriter 
LOS ANGELES — At times this season,
the Stanford baseball team has shown over
powering pitching, explosive hitting and
stingy defense. Yesterday at Jackie Robinson
Stadium against UCLA, it put all three of
those elements together.
The result was a 9-0 thrashing of the
Bruins, completing the Cardinal's second con
secutive series sweep. Stanford now leads the
Pacific 10 Southern Division by two-and-onc
half games over UCLA and California with a
6-0 record. UCLA fell to 5-4 in the Six-Pac.
"That was nice," Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess said of yesterday's game. "That's
the way we like it. I don't think there's any
question it was our best game of the year."
The fact that Stanford is now the team to
beat doesn't bother Marquess. "They coU:.. -s
much now as they do in May," he said. "I'd
rather be a front-runner than behind."
Yesterday's game figured to be a great
matchup of freshman standouts — UCLA's
Alex Sanchez and Stanford's Jack McDowell.
However, Sanchez, who entered the game
with a 3-1 record and a 2.57 ERA, left by the
fourth inning.
McDowell never left. The 6-foot-5
right-hander threw a four-hit shutout, raising
his record to 4-2. He struck out seven and
allowed only one man to reach second base.
"I had a good forkball today, so I could
keep them off balance," McDowell said.
"That made my fastball that much better."
McDowell had a lot of incentive to preserve
his shutout. Many friends from his Sherman
Oaks high school were in attendance. "I tried
to keep it going," he said. "I was really up for
this game."
Rick Lundblade and Mark Davis put Stan
ford ahead 2-0 in the second with solo homers
to right-center — Lundblade's ninth and
Davis' sixth of the year.
The Cardinal extended its lead to 5-0 in the
fourth. RBI singles by Walt Harris and Davis
finished Sanchez, and Toi Cook drove in the
fifth run with a fielder's choice.
The onslaught continued in the fifth. After

an intentional walk to Lundblade loaded the
bases, Mike Deßenon made the Bruin strat
egy look bad with a two-run single to center
that ended the day for reliever Scott Marsh.
The final two runs came across in the sixth
against Eric Nolte. Cook walked and went to
third on a double by John Verducci. Cook
then scored on a balk by Nolte, and Verducci
came home after center fielder Sean Berry
dropped Pete Stanicek's long fly ball.
With his teammates scoring in bunches,
McDowell had to keep from losing his con
centration. "When you get a lead like that, it
can be hard to stay up," he said. "I just had to
keep throwing strikes." He did, walking only
one batter.
"McDowell really dominated them," said
Marquess.
On Saturday, it was Jeff Ballard's turn to
dominate as Stanford pulled out game two of
the series, 3-2.
Ballard's eight-hit, eight-strikeout com
plete game performance upped his record to
5-0. The win was the 28th of his career, tying
him with Brian Mignano for the most career
victories in Stanford history.
The senior left-hander, who walked only
one man, called the game his best of the
season. "I had a rough second inning," Bal
lard said. "But throughout the game, I
thought it was my best so far."
A mixture of fastballs and breaking balls
kept the Bruins off balance. "I had a lot of
things working today," he said. "I could get
my curve over on 2-1 or 3-2. They couldn't
just sit on one pitch."
The Cardinal offense was hardly over
powering, but it managed to squeeze three
runs out of eight hits — which was just
enough for Ballard.
Ruben Amaro got Stanford started right
away with a walk and a stolen base in the first.
Amaro then scored the game's first run on a
single to center by John Ramos.
The Cardinal scored in similar fashion in
the second. This time. Harris drew the walk
and stole the base. He was driven home by
Cook, who went 3-for-4 on the day.
As Ballard said, the bottom of the second

was rough for Stanford. Steve Hisey started
the inning with a triple off the wall in right
and scored on a wild pitch. One our later.
Todd Zeile tied the game with a home run t<>
left. Jeff Osborn followed with a double, bu
Ballard escaped the inning without furlh »
damage.
Both teams had scoring chances in !h
middle innings, but Ballard and his Biui:
counterparts Scott Kershaw and Bill Wenrid
dodged the bullet each time. Kershav
worked out of a two-on, none-out jam in tht
fourth by coaxing a double-play ball out of
Cook and striking out Verducci. In tht
seventh, Wenrick struck out Ramos with men
on second and third.
Ballard's big challenge came in the sixth
With men on second and third with two outs
Bruin Coach Gary Adams sent Vince Lope/
a .325 hitter, up to pinch hit for Gary Gorski.
On a 2-2 pitch, Ballard fanned Lopez with a
wicked slider. "I hit that one real good," Bal
lard said.
Stanford scored the game-winner in the
eighth with a familiar formula — a walk, a
steal and a single. After Deßenon drew the
free pass, Fred Laningham ran for him and
promptly stole second. Harris then lined a
Wendrick delivery into right-center, scoring
Laningham easily.
Although it did not control the game as
dramatically as it did on Sunday. Stanford
outhit, outpitched and outplayed UCI.A en
route to a 5-2 win on Friday.
The hitting stars for the Cardinal were
Cook and, as usual, Davis. Davis showed his
amazing versatility once again with a homer, a
triple, a walk and a stolen base. However, his
2-for-3 day actually lowered his batting
average in Six-Pac play — from .750 to .727.
After the series, it still stood at .579 through
six games.
Cook continued his recent surge at the
plate with two singles and a long sacrifice ll>
to center. He attributed his current success to
patience.

Center fielder Mark Davis hit his sixth home run of the season here to stake the Card
inal to a 2-0 lead yesterday.Stanford went on to defeat UCLA 9-0 and complete the se
ries sweep.
he said "If I stiiclc too soon, my
hands are too slow and it throws mc
of I.
Hitting behind the torrid Davis
doesn't hurt either, "lie's been on
b all the time, and they don't want
i throw a curve when he's there be
cause he can -.teal," Cook said. "So I
ret more fastballs to hit."
I ho Cardinal jumped out to a 1-0
U id in the lirst without hitting the
ball. Stanicek walked and moved to
second on a wild pitch. He then stole
third and scored when Zeile threw
the ball into left field.

After Davis homer to left-center
in the second made it 2-0, Bruin
starter Neal Newns shut the door on
the Cardinal. Ncwns didn't allow an
other hit unitl Deßenon's two-out
single in the sixth.
That single, though, caused Adams
to decide that Newns had had enough
— which was fine with Stanford. "I
don't know why they took him out,"
said Lundblade, who accounted for
two of Newns' nine strikeouts.
"I was happy to see him go,"
Marquess said.
Hisey got the Bruins even with a
two-out, two-run single off Cardinal
starter Rob Wassenaar in the sixth,
but Stanford put the game away with
three in the seventh.

After Harris walked, Davis drove
his triple to right-center and scored
on Cook's sacrifice fly. Stanicek
doubled to left-center, and Amaro
gave the Cardinal its final run with an
RBI single off Jeff Hirsch.
Wassenaar breezed through the
final three innings, ending the game
by getting Hector Cano to hit into a
slick around-the-horn double play —
the fourth twin-killing of the day for
Stanford.
Wassenaar's impressive five-hitter
raised his record to 4-0. His perfor
mance was an improvement over his
last outing against Arizona State,
when he was tagged for four homers.

I ho Cardinal jumped out to a 1-0
U id in the lirst without hitting the
ball. Stanicek walked and moved to
second on a wild pitch. He then stole
third and scored when Zeile threw
the ball into left field.

After Davis homer to left-center
in the second made it 2-0, Bruin
starter Neal Newns shut the door on
the Cardinal. Ncwns didn't allow an
other hit unitl Deßenon's two-out
single in the sixth.
That single, though, caused Adams
to decide that Newns had had enough
— which was fine with Stanford. "I
don't know why they took him out,"
said Lundblade, who accounted for
two of Newns' nine strikeouts.
"I was happy to see him go,"
Marquess said.
Hisey got the Bruins even with a
two-out, two-run single off Cardinal
starter Rob Wassenaar in the sixth,
but Stanford put the game away with
three in the seventh.

After Harris walked, Davis drove
his triple to right-center and scored
on Cook's sacrifice fly. Stanicek
doubled to left-center, and Amaro
gave the Cardinal its final run with an
RBI single off Jeff Hirsch.
Wassenaar breezed through the
final three innings, ending the game
by getting Hector Cano to hit into a
slick around-the-horn double play —
the fourth twin-killing of the day for
Stanford.
Wassenaar's impressive five-hitter
raised his record to 4-0. His perfor

LOS ANGELES — At times this season,
the Stanford baseball team has shown over
powering pitching, explosive hitting and
stingy defense. Yesterday at Jackie Robinson
Stadium against UCLA, it put all three of
those elements together.
The result was a 9-0 thrashing of the
Bruins, completing the Cardinal's second con
secutive series sweep. Stanford now leads the
Pacific 10 Southern Division by two-and-onc
half games over UCLA and California with a
6-0 record. UCLA fell to 5-4 in the Six-Pac.
"That was nice," Stanford Coach Mark
Marquess said of yesterday's game. "That's
the way we like it. I don't think there's any
question it was our best game of the year."
The fact that Stanford is now the team to
beat doesn't bother Marquess. "They coU:.. -s
much now as they do in May," he said. "I'd
rather be a front-runner than behind."
Yesterday's game figured to be a great
matchup of freshman standouts — UCLA's
Alex Sanchez and Stanford's Jack McDowell.
However, Sanchez, who entered the game
with a 3-1 record and a 2.57 ERA, left by the
fourth inning.
McDowell never left. The 6-foot-5
right-hander threw a four-hit shutout, raising
his record to 4-2. He struck out seven and
allowed only one man to reach second base.
"I had a good forkball today, so I could
keep them off balance," McDowell said.
"That made my fastball that much better."
McDowell had a lot of incentive to preserve
his shutout. Many friends from his Sherman
Oaks high school were in attendance. "I tried
to keep it going," he said. "I was really up for
this game."
Rick Lundblade and Mark Davis put Stan
ford ahead 2-0 in the second with solo homers
to right-center — Lundblade's ninth and
Davis' sixth of the year.
The Cardinal extended its lead to 5-0 in the
fourth. RBI singles by Walt Harris and Davis
finished Sanchez, and Toi Cook drove in the
fifth run with a fielder's choice.
The onslaught continued in the fifth. After

an intentional walk to Lundblade loaded the
bases, Mike Deßenon made the Bruin strat
egy look bad with a two-run single to center
that ended the day for reliever Scott Marsh.
The final two runs came across in the sixth
against Eric Nolte. Cook walked and went to
third on a double by John Verducci. Cook
then scored on a balk by Nolte, and Verducci
came home after center fielder Sean Berry
dropped Pete Stanicek's long fly ball.
With his teammates scoring in bunches,
McDowell had to keep from losing his con
centration. "When you get a lead like that, it
can be hard to stay up," he said. "I just had to
keep throwing strikes." He did, walking only
one batter.
"McDowell really dominated them," said
Marquess.
On Saturday, it was Jeff Ballard's turn to
dominate as Stanford pulled out game two of
the series, 3-2.
Ballard's eight-hit, eight-strikeout com
plete game performance upped his record to
5-0. The win was the 28th of his career, tying
him with Brian Mignano for the most career
victories in Stanford history.
The senior left-hander, who walked only
one man, called the game his best of the
season. "I had a rough second inning," Bal
lard said. "But throughout the game, I
thought it was my best so far."
A mixture of fastballs and breaking balls
kept the Bruins off balance. "I had a lot of
things working today," he said. "I could get
my curve over on 2-1 or 3-2. They couldn't
just sit on one pitch."
The Cardinal offense was hardly over
powering, but it managed to squeeze three
runs out of eight hits — which was just
enough for Ballard.
Ruben Amaro got Stanford started right
away with a walk and a stolen base in the first.
Amaro then scored the game's first run on a
single to center by John Ramos.
The Cardinal scored in similar fashion in
the second. This time. Harris drew the walk
and stole the base. He was driven home by
Cook, who went 3-for-4 on the day.
As Ballard said, the bottom of the second

was rough for Stanford. Steve Hisey started
the inning with a triple off the wall in right
and scored on a wild pitch. One our later.
Todd Zeile tied the game with a home run t<>
left. Jeff Osborn followed with a double, bu
Ballard escaped the inning without furlh »
damage.
Both teams had scoring chances in !h
middle innings, but Ballard and his Biui:
counterparts Scott Kershaw and Bill Wenrid
dodged the bullet each time. Kershav
worked out of a two-on, none-out jam in tht
fourth by coaxing a double-play ball out of
Cook and striking out Verducci. In tht
seventh, Wenrick struck out Ramos with men
on second and third.
Ballard's big challenge came in the sixth
With men on second and third with two outs
Bruin Coach Gary Adams sent Vince Lope/
a .325 hitter, up to pinch hit for Gary Gorski.
On a 2-2 pitch, Ballard fanned Lopez with a
wicked slider. "I hit that one real good," Bal
lard said.
Stanford scored the game-winner in the

that ended the day for reliever Scott Marsh.
The final two runs came across in the sixth
against Eric Nolte. Cook walked and went to
third on a double by John Verducci. Cook
then scored on a balk by Nolte, and Verducci
came home after center fielder Sean Berry
dropped Pete Stanicek's long fly ball.
With his teammates scoring in bunches,
McDowell had to keep from losing his con
centration. "When you get a lead like that, it
can be hard to stay up," he said. "I just had to
keep throwing strikes." He did, walking only
one batter.
"McDowell really dominated them," said
Marquess.
On Saturday, it was Jeff Ballard's turn to
dominate as Stanford pulled out game two of
the series, 3-2.
Ballard's eight-hit, eight-strikeout com
plete game performance upped his record to
5-0. The win was the 28th of his career, tying
him with Brian Mignano for the most career
victories in Stanford history.
The senior left-hander, who walked only
one man, called the game his best of the
season. "I had a rough second inning," Bal
lard said. "But throughout the game, I
thought it was my best so far."
A mixture of fastballs and breaking balls
kept the Bruins off balance. "I had a lot of
things working today," he said. "I could get
my curve over on 2-1 or 3-2. They couldn't
just sit on one pitch."
The Cardinal offense was hardly over
powering, but it managed to squeeze three
runs out of eight hits — which was just
enough for Ballard.
Ruben Amaro got Stanford started right
away with a walk and a stolen base in the first.
Amaro then scored the game's first run on a
single to center by John Ramos.
The Cardinal scored in similar fashion in
the second. This time. Harris drew the walk
and stole the base. He was driven home by
Cook, who went 3-for-4 on the day.
As Ballard said, the bottom of the second

was rough for Stanford. Steve Hisey started
the inning with a triple off the wall in right
and scored on a wild pitch. One our later.
Todd Zeile tied the game with a home run t<>
left. Jeff Osborn followed with a double, bu
Ballard escaped the inning without furlh »
damage.
Both teams had scoring chances in !h
middle innings, but Ballard and his Biui:
counterparts Scott Kershaw and Bill Wenrid
dodged the bullet each time. Kershav
worked out of a two-on, none-out jam in tht
fourth by coaxing a double-play ball out of
Cook and striking out Verducci. In tht
seventh, Wenrick struck out Ramos with men
on second and third.
Ballard's big challenge came in the sixth
With men on second and third with two outs
Bruin Coach Gary Adams sent Vince Lope/
a .325 hitter, up to pinch hit for Gary Gorski.
On a 2-2 pitch, Ballard fanned Lopez with a
wicked slider. "I hit that one real good," Bal
lard said.
Stanford scored the game-winner in the
eighth with a familiar formula — a walk, a
steal and a single. After Deßenon drew the
free pass, Fred Laningham ran for him and
promptly stole second. Harris then lined a
Wendrick delivery into right-center, scoring
Laningham easily.
Although it did not control the game as
dramatically as it did on Sunday. Stanford
outhit, outpitched and outplayed UCI.A en
route to a 5-2 win on Friday.
The hitting stars for the Cardinal were
Cook and, as usual, Davis. Davis showed his
amazing versatility once again with a homer, a
triple, a walk and a stolen base. However, his
2-for-3 day actually lowered his batting
average in Six-Pac play — from .750 to .727.
After the series, it still stood at .579 through
six games.
Cook continued his recent surge at the
plate with two singles and a long sacrifice ll>
to center. He attributed his current success to
patience.
"Just waiting on the ball is the key for me "

Center fielder Mark Davis hit his sixth home run of the season here to stake the Card
inal to a 2-0 lead yesterday.Stanford went on to defeat UCLA 9-0 and complete the se
ries sweep.
he said "If I stiiclc too soon, my
hands are too slow and it throws mc
of I.
Hitting behind the torrid Davis
doesn't hurt either, "lie's been on
b all the time, and they don't want
i throw a curve when he's there be
cause he can -.teal," Cook said. "So I
ret more fastballs to hit."
I ho Cardinal jumped out to a 1-0
U id in the lirst without hitting the
ball. Stanicek walked and moved to
second on a wild pitch. He then stole
third and scored when Zeile threw
the ball into left field.

After Davis homer to left-center
in the second made it 2-0, Bruin
starter Neal Newns shut the door on
the Cardinal. Ncwns didn't allow an
other hit unitl Deßenon's two-out
single in the sixth.
That single, though, caused Adams
to decide that Newns had had enough
— which was fine with Stanford. "I
don't know why they took him out,"
said Lundblade, who accounted for
two of Newns' nine strikeouts.
"I was happy to see him go,"
Marquess said.
Hisey got the Bruins even with a
two-out, two-run single off Cardinal
starter Rob Wassenaar in the sixth,
but Stanford put the game away with
three in the seventh.

After Harris walked, Davis drove
his triple to right-center and scored
on Cook's sacrifice fly. Stanicek
doubled to left-center, and Amaro
gave the Cardinal its final run with an
RBI single off Jeff Hirsch.
Wassenaar breezed through the
final three innings, ending the game
by getting Hector Cano to hit into a
slick around-the-horn double play —
the fourth twin-killing of the day for
Stanford.
Wassenaar's impressive five-hitter
raised his record to 4-0. His perfor
mance was an improvement over his
last outing against Arizona State,
when he was tagged for four homers.
"I got ahead early today, and that
