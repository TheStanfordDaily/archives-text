# Card finishes with loss to UW
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
They flew in the seniors' parents
for Saturday's basketball season
finale at Maples Pavilion. Maybe they
should have suited them up, too.
Stanford mercifully ended its
season with a whimper, not a bang, as
it bowed to the mighty and heighty
Washington Huskies, 67-47.
It was a fitting end to a forgettable
season. Everything the Cardinal had
done wrong all season it did wrong
again Saturday, only this day it did
everything worse. Stanford was out
shot from the floor, 51 to 29 percent.
It was out-rebounded 46-24.
In the space of one 40-minute
game, the Cardinal showed why it
finished the season 11-17 overall, 7-
17 against Division I opponents, and
in last place in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence at 3-15 — a full two games be
hind eighth-place Washington State
and California, and 10 games behind
conference co-champions Washing
ton and USC.
Still, Cardinal Coach Tom Davis
had something positive to talk about
after the game.
Next year.
Stanford loses a total of 12.4 points
per game from this year's graduating
class, which includes Neil Johnson,
Charles Hunt and Kent Seymour. It
gains five freshmen — two guards,
two forwards and a center — all of
whom come to Stanford garnished
with the highest of prep accolades.
"We did the best we could with
what we had," Davis said. "But it
wasn't enough.
"It isn't bad to bring along fresh
men if you have experienced upper
classmen to bring them along with."
he continued. "But if you have to
bring along freshmen with upper
classmen who are also playing for the
first time — like we had to do this
year— that's tough "
"We need help all over . . . and
hopefully, some of our freshmen
(recruits) can step in and help. They'll
have to."

While yesterday's game marked
the first losing season of Davis'
coaching career, it was the last
regular-season game of retiring
Washington Coach Marv Harshman's
career.
The 67-year-old Harshman, who
with 622 career wins is the winningest
active Division I coach and whose
team finished 22-9 this year, was
honored in a pre-game ceremony
with gifts from Davis and his staff.
After the game, however. Harshman
neglected to return the favor.
"I don't like the way they play," he
said of Stanford's running and press
ing style. "I think it's not exactly bas
ketball.
"Basketball is a game of skill. They
run and jump into you. If you want to
do that, you should put on pads. The
object of the game is to put the brown
thing into the round thing, not to sec
if you can disable your opponent."
Davis, ever the tactician, politely
refuted Harshman's contentions.
"I'd rather have them try hard and
make aggressive mistakes," Davis
said. "We may play ugly, but we don't
play soft. I know opposing coaches
would like IStanford players) to quit,
to let them have another win over
Stanford. But that's not the way I
coach. If we're going to lose, we're
going to lose coming at you.
"Our style of play is a lot like
Georgetown's and a lot like North
Carolina's, but we just don't have
that type of talent," he continued.
"As we get better players, we'll play
more like they play. We'll be smooth
er, we won't foul as much."
Smooth definitely was something
the Cardinal wasn't Saturday, espe
cially when it came to shooting. In the
second half alone, Stanford shot a
horrendous 24 percent from the floor
(7-for-29) compared to Washington's
54 percent (14-for-26).
Most of the Cardinal misses came
after the 15:55 mark of the second
half, just after Novian Whitsitt made

Washington Saturday, but Shag Williams and the Huskies had no trou
ble holding on for the victory.
i free throw to narrow a 29-19
ii.iiftime deficit to 35-26. Then the
Cardinal suffered a scoring drought
of Ethiopian proportions.
Stanford went scoreless eight
seconds short of eight minutes and
field goal-less for upwards of nine
minutes By the time Whitsitt hit a
1 2-foot jumper with 6:47 to go, it was
too late lor comebacks. The Huskies
led 50-31 and the only thing on their

minds was who they would play in the
first round of the NCAA tournament.
Davis said Stanford's biggest prob
lem was the result of injuries to two
of his starters — Seymour and Andy
Fischer. Seymour has been bothered
by a broken nose and Fischer broke
his jaw in the opening minutes of Sat
urday's game.
"We don't need much to upset us
— sometimes we don't need any
thing," Davis said. "Having Kent not
at his peak and having Fischer hurt
really upset us."
As it was, Fischer finished the

game — "That's typical of Andy to
want to keep playing," Davis said —
and was 4-for-7 from the floor — the
only Cardinal to shoot better than 50
percent. Besides Fischer, only two
others — Keith Ramee and Whitsitt
— shot better than 29 percent indi
vidually.
"We got the shots," Davis said.
''We just didn't make them."

Stanford honored four seniors
before the game Saturday —
Seymour, Hunt, Johnson and Dave
Patzwald. Patzwald, a walk-on who

really helps," he said. "Plus, ASU is a
better mistake-hitting team."
Although his curveball is usually
his best pitch, Wassenaar basically
relied on his fastball, especially with a
three-run lead. "Later in the game, I
wasn't throwing my curve well," he
said. "1 didn't want to walk anyone,
so I went with the fastball."
According to Marquess, winning
the first game of any series is crucial.
"The first one is the key one," he said
Friday. "It sets the tone for the whole
series."
The Cardinal has Dead Week off,
but will host USC this weekend for
another three-game Six-Pac series
beginning Friday.
missed most of the season with a knee
injury that required arthroscopic sur
gery, suited up and took warm-ups.
However, his knee had not recovered
enough to allow him to play, much to
the disappointment of students who
chanted "Patzwald, Patzwald" in the
waning minutes Saturday.
Fischer's jaw injury did nothing to
hold back his usual aggressive style of
play. Midway through the second
half, Fischer dove for a loose ball and
landed directly on top of an NBC
television monitor. The monitor went
out and soon after was removed from
the announcer's table.

thing into the round thing, not to sec
if you can disable your opponent."
Davis, ever the tactician, politely
refuted Harshman's contentions.
"I'd rather have them try hard and
make aggressive mistakes," Davis
said. "We may play ugly, but we don't
play soft. I know opposing coaches
would like IStanford players) to quit,
to let them have another win over
Stanford. But that's not the way I
coach. If we're going to lose, we're
going to lose coming at you.
"Our style of play is a lot like
Georgetown's and a lot like North
Carolina's, but we just don't have
that type of talent," he continued.
"As we get better players, we'll play
more like they play. We'll be smooth
er, we won't foul as much."
Smooth definitely was something
the Cardinal wasn't Saturday, espe
cially when it came to shooting. In the
second half alone, Stanford shot a
horrendous 24 percent from the floor
(7-for-29) compared to Washington's
54 percent (14-for-26).
Most of the Cardinal misses came
after the 15:55 mark of the second
half, just after Novian Whitsitt made

Cardinal suffered a scoring drought
of Ethiopian proportions.
Stanford went scoreless eight
seconds short of eight minutes and
field goal-less for upwards of nine
minutes By the time Whitsitt hit a
1 2-foot jumper with 6:47 to go, it was
too late lor comebacks. The Huskies
led 50-31 and the only thing on their

minds was who they would play in the
first round of the NCAA tournament.
Davis said Stanford's biggest prob
lem was the result of injuries to two
of his starters — Seymour and Andy
Fischer. Seymour has been bothered
by a broken nose and Fischer broke
his jaw in the opening minutes of Sat
urday's game.
"We don't need much to upset us
— sometimes we don't need any
thing," Davis said. "Having Kent not
at his peak and having Fischer hurt
really upset us."
As it was, Fischer finished the

game — "That's typical of Andy to
want to keep playing," Davis said —
and was 4-for-7 from the floor — the
only Cardinal to shoot better than 50
percent. Besides Fischer, only two
others — Keith Ramee and Whitsitt
— shot better than 29 percent indi
vidually.
"We got the shots," Davis said.
''We just didn't make them."

really helps," he said. "Plus, ASU is a
better mistake-hitting team."
Although his curveball is usually
his best pitch, Wassenaar basically
relied on his fastball, especially with a
three-run lead. "Later in the game, I
wasn't throwing my curve well," he
said. "1 didn't want to walk anyone,
so I went with the fastball."
According to Marquess, winning
the first game of any series is crucial.

injury that required arthroscopic sur

However, his knee had not recovered
enough to allow him to play, much to
the disappointment of students who
chanted "Patzwald, Patzwald" in the
waning minutes Saturday.
Fischer's jaw injury did nothing to
hold back his usual aggressive style of
play. Midway through the second
half, Fischer dove for a loose ball and
landed directly on top of an NBC
television monitor. The monitor went
out and soon after was removed from
the announcer's table.

finale at Maples Pavilion. Maybe they
should have suited them up, too.
Stanford mercifully ended its
season with a whimper, not a bang, as
it bowed to the mighty and heighty
Washington Huskies, 67-47.
It was a fitting end to a forgettable
season. Everything the Cardinal had
done wrong all season it did wrong
again Saturday, only this day it did
everything worse. Stanford was out
shot from the floor, 51 to 29 percent.
It was out-rebounded 46-24.
In the space of one 40-minute
game, the Cardinal showed why it
finished the season 11-17 overall, 7-
17 against Division I opponents, and
in last place in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence at 3-15 — a full two games be
hind eighth-place Washington State
and California, and 10 games behind
conference co-champions Washing

had something positive to talk about
after the game.

Stanford loses a total of 12.4 points
per game from this year's graduating
class, which includes Neil Johnson,
Charles Hunt and Kent Seymour. It
gains five freshmen — two guards,
two forwards and a center — all of
whom come to Stanford garnished
with the highest of prep accolades.
"We did the best we could with
what we had," Davis said. "But it
wasn't enough.
"It isn't bad to bring along fresh
men if you have experienced upper
classmen to bring them along with."
he continued. "But if you have to
bring along freshmen with upper
classmen who are also playing for the
first time — like we had to do this
year— that's tough "
"We need help all over . . . and
hopefully, some of our freshmen
(recruits) can step in and help. They'll
have to."

While yesterday's game marked
the first losing season of Davis'
coaching career, it was the last
regular-season game of retiring
Washington Coach Marv Harshman's
career.
The 67-year-old Harshman, who
with 622 career wins is the winningest
active Division I coach and whose
team finished 22-9 this year, was
honored in a pre-game ceremony
with gifts from Davis and his staff.
After the game, however. Harshman
neglected to return the favor.
"I don't like the way they play," he
said of Stanford's running and press
ing style. "I think it's not exactly bas
ketball.
"Basketball is a game of skill. They
run and jump into you. If you want to
do that, you should put on pads. The
object of the game is to put the brown
