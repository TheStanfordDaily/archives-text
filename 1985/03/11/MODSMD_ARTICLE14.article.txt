# Card finishes with loss to UW
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
They flew in the seniors' parents
for Saturday's basketball season
finale at Maples Pavilion. Maybe they
should have suited them up, too.
Stanford mercifully ended its
season with a whimper, not a bang, as
it bowed to the mighty and heighty
Washington Huskies, 67-47.
It was a fitting end to a forgettable
season. Everything the Cardinal had
done wrong all season it did wrong
again Saturday, only this day it did
everything worse. Stanford was out
shot from the floor, 51 to 29 percent.
It was out-rebounded 46-24.
In the space of one 40-minute
game, the Cardinal showed why it
finished the season 11-17 overall, 7-
17 against Division I opponents, and
in last place in the Pacific 10 Confer
ence at 3-15 — a full two games be
hind eighth-place Washington State
and California, and 10 games behind
conference co-champions Washing
ton and USC.
Still, Cardinal Coach Tom Davis
had something positive to talk about
after the game.
Next year.
Stanford loses a total of 12.4 points
per game from this year's graduating
class, which includes Neil Johnson,
Charles Hunt and Kent Seymour. It
gains five freshmen — two guards,
two forwards and a center — all of
whom come to Stanford garnished
with the highest of prep accolades.
"We did the best we could with
what we had," Davis said. "But it
wasn't enough.
"It isn't bad to bring along fresh
men if you have experienced upper
classmen to bring them along with."
he continued. "But if you have to
bring along freshmen with upper
classmen who are also playing for the
first time — like we had to do this
year— that's tough "
"We need help all over . . . and
hopefully, some of our freshmen
(recruits) can step in and help. They'll
have to."

While yesterday's game marked
the first losing season of Davis'
coaching career, it was the last
regular-season game of retiring
Washington Coach Marv Harshman's
career.
The 67-year-old Harshman, who
with 622 career wins is the winningest
active Division I coach and whose
team finished 22-9 this year, was
honored in a pre-game ceremony
with gifts from Davis and his staff.
After the game, however. Harshman
neglected to return the favor.
"I don't like the way they play," he
said of Stanford's running and press
ing style. "I think it's not exactly bas
ketball.
"Basketball is a game of skill. They
run and jump into you. If you want to
do that, you should put on pads. The
object of the game is to put the brown
thing into the round thing, not to sec
if you can disable your opponent."
Davis, ever the tactician, politely
refuted Harshman's contentions.
"I'd rather have them try hard and
make aggressive mistakes," Davis
said. "We may play ugly, but we don't
play soft. I know opposing coaches
would like IStanford players) to quit,
to let them have another win over
Stanford. But that's not the way I
coach. If we're going to lose, we're
going to lose coming at you.
"Our style of play is a lot like
Georgetown's and a lot like North
Carolina's, but we just don't have
that type of talent," he continued.
"As we get better players, we'll play
more like they play. We'll be smooth
er, we won't foul as much."
Smooth definitely was something
the Cardinal wasn't Saturday, espe
cially when it came to shooting. In the
second half alone, Stanford shot a
horrendous 24 percent from the floor
(7-for-29) compared to Washington's
54 percent (14-for-26).
Most of the Cardinal misses came
after the 15:55 mark of the second
half, just after Novian Whitsitt made

Earl Koberlein (40) and his Stanford teammates didn't let down against
Washington Saturday, but Shag Williams and the Huskies had no trou
ble holding on for the victory.
