KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) —
The Big Ten and Big East confer
ences put a record six teams apiece
in the 64-team NCAA men's bas
ketball tournament field yester
day. One official said the field, the
largest ever, also is the best ever.
"We are very excited about the
very difficult job we have done,"
said Vic Bubas, chairman of the
Division 1 basketball committee
which spent three days and nights
drawing the pairings and seedings.
Georgetown, St. John s, Mic
higan and Oklahoma — the top
four teams in The Associated
Press Top 20 — were named No. 1
seeds in the four regions.
First-round competition begins
Thursday around the nation, and
the tournament will end with the
championship game April 1 in
Lexington, Ky.
The committee picked 35 at
large teams to go with 29 which
qualified automatically as cham
pions of their conference or con
ference tournament.
"The first 20 or 21 at-large
teams were easy. It was no trou
ble." Bubas said. "The last 15 got
difficult, and I'm telling you. the
last six or eight, we could have
stayed there a week. It was an
agonizing experience."
Kentucky, a Final Four team
last season and host of the finals
this year, made the field with the
worst record among at-large
entries, 16-12. •
Among the missing were In
diana, NCAA champion in 1976
and 1981 but a loser in six of its
last seven games this season;
Louisville, which won in 1980 and

had been in the last eight NCAA
tournaments; Houston, which had
been in the Final Four the last
three years, and UCLA, which
won 10 titles in a 12-year stretch
ending in 1975 and which hail not
missed the tournament two years a
row since 1961.
Only three independents made
the field — Notre Dame,.Dayton
and DePaul. Among others left
out, despite the addition of 1 1
teams this year, were 20-12
Creighton, 20-10 Richmond and
20-8 West Virginia, the regular
season Atlantic 10 champion.
Lehigh, at 12-18, is the only
tournament team with a losing
record. Lehigh got in by winning
its East Coast Athletic Conference
tournament.
The previous record for most
teams from one conference in the
tournament was five by the Atan
tic Coast in 1980 and 1984, the
Big East in 1983 and the Big Ten
in 1983.
I he ACC and the Southeastern
Conference both had five teams
this year.
Sixteen teams who won at least
20 games this season were left out
of the tournament. Besides West
Virginia, Richmond and
Creighton, they were 22-7 Mon
tana, 20-9 Weber State, 20-9
Canisius, 22-7 Siena, 21-8
