## Four Pac-10 teams make NCAAs 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
l iv e teams entered the Pacific 10 Conference's
final weekend of play hunched at the top of the
sUuiditms. all no worse than two games off the
pact . And when the final bu/zcr of the final
i« u I a i tcason game had sounded, those five
teams were still there, only closer together.
With two teams finishing at 13-5 and three
teams at 12-6. about the only thing this
weekend's games did was confuse the issue.
But apparently it also confused the NCAA
tournament Selection Committee enough that
instead ot deciding which two or three teams to
take, it took four. And the fifth team in the log
jam at the top is National Invitational
I ournament-bo'und.
l'ac-10 co-champions Washington and USC
re joined by third-place finishers Oregon
State, which defeated L'SC 60-58 in overtime
Saturday, and Arizona, whose athletic director
conveniently was on the selection committee, in

the 64-team NCAA tournament which begins
Thursday.
UCLA, which was 12-6 in the Pac-10 but only
16-12 overall, was snatched up by the NIT just
hours after the NCAA pairings were announced.
In all, it was a great day for the Pac-10, a con
ference desperately in need of basketball
recognition anywhere west of the Rockies.
However, getting into the NCAA tournament
is only half the task of regaining face for the
league. Now the four teams have to back it up
with victories.
Washington and Arizona probably have the best
chance of advancing because both are in the West
Region, far and away the weakest of the four
regions.
The Huskies, who received the Pac-10's auto
matic berth in the tournament because they had a
better overall record in the continental United
States than USC, are seeded fifth and meet 12th
seeded Kentucky tomorrow night in Salt Lake

City. Arizona is seeded l()th and plays
seventh-seeded Alabama Friday night in Albu
querque, N.M.
USC and Oregon State, however, face tougher
times. Eighth-seeded USC plays No. 9 Illinois
State Thursday at Tulsa, Okla., in the first round
of the Midwest Regional. Should the Trojans
win, they would probably meet Oklahoma, the
region's top seed.
Oregon State, the 1 Oth seed in the Southeast,
plays Notre Dame Thursday on the Fighting
Irish's home floor in South Bend, Ind. And if the
Beavers can find a way to knock off Notre Dame,
they will most likely face No. 2 seed North
Carolina next.
UCLA, meanwhile, plays its first-round game
at home tomorrow against Montana (22-7), as
the 32-team NIT has only one set site — New
York City's Madison Square Garden for its semi
finals and finals. Otherwise, all the games are
played on someone's home court.
