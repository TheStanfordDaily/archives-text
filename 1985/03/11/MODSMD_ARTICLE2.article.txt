International relations experts
here agree that Soviet President
■Konstantin Chernenko's death
will have no immediate effect on
Soviet foreign policy and U.S.-
Soviet relations.
The death "probably won't
make any difference for foreign
policy," according to Political Sci
ence Prof. Jan Triska. The new
Soviet leader "will try to maintain
a line that is already set," he said.
There will be "no immediate ef
fects on U.S.-Soviet relations," ac-

cording to Asst. Political Science
Prof. Condoleezza Rice. "The
Soviets have a thing about unity of
leadership. They will want to play
down the personality issue — that
one person matters that much."
she said.
Indeed, the primary issue seems
to he whether the new Soviet
leader will he able to consolidate a
central, directing leadership of the
party and country. "The Soviets
haven't had a strong central figure
in leadership since (former Soviet
President Leonid) Brezhnev," said
Rice, the assistant director of the
Center for International Security
and Arms Control here. "They
have relied on collective leader
ship. There is no reason to expect
that to chance immediately."

"I can't see any change (in
policy) partly because the first sec
retary will not have all control.
Policy will be decided by the Polit
buro," -said Robert Conquest, a
senior research fellow at the
Hoover Institution. He predicted
no change except "to the degree
that if they are having trouble it
. . . makes them less able to
produce clear, immediate and
well-directed tactical moves."
The experts also agree that the
change in leadership will have no
significant effect on the approach
ing round of arms control negotia
tions. "They will proceed as
scheduled and nothing will happen
for quite some time anyway,"
Triska said.
"Most people assess that the
negotiation is (Soviet Foreign
Minister Andrei) Gromvko's show
anyway, so it could conceivably go
on," Rice said. She expects a short
recess in the negotiations only as
an appropriate gesture of mourn
ing.
Alexander Dallin. professor of
history and political science,
agrees that the change in leader
ship will not affect the negotia
tions. "Frankly, 1 don't think there
is much chance of the negotiations
succeeding" in any case, he said.
"The successor will he chosen
from the Politboro, where there is
not much disagreement on the
pursuit of arms control negotia
tions."
Speculation on who will be cho
sen to succeed Chernenko was
only slightly mixed, with Politburo
member Mikhail Gorbachev the
likely candidate.
"Gorbachev has been prepped
for the position for some time,"
Rice said. "We've had surprises
before, hut he would be the logical
choice," Dallin agreed.
Conquest said he believes that
the chances are about even be
tween Gorbachev and fellow
Politburo member Viktor Grishin,
with many others remaining as
secondary possibilities. "Some
claim that Gorbachev doesn't have
the drive or the killer instinct to
take over," Conquest said.
Gorbachev is the youngest
member of the Politburo and his
selection as the Soviets' leader
could have important implications.
"It has been something of an em
barassment for the Soviets to have
a succesion of sickly, over-aged
leaders, Dallin said. "A lot of
people over there would
welcome" a young leader.
Triska said he feels that the So
viet Union may experience many
shifts in domestic policy with a
young leader. "Reform is badly
needed to bring coherence to the
Soviet economic system." he said.
The choice of a younger man to
succeed Chernenko might
facilitate the risk-taking necessary
to reform the Soviet economy, ac
cording to Triska.
