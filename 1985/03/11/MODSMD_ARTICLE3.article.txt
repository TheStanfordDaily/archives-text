### CLINT HIGHFILL Editorial staff 
A planned Stanford visit by 30 high-ranking So
viet leaders was canceled yesterday as abruptly as
it was scheduled, according to Maria Bun, assistant
director of the Bechtel International Center in
charge of international visitors.
The delegation, led by a member of the Soviet
Politburo, was the most prominent group from the
Soviet Union to come to the United States in 12
years. It was to tour the Center for Integrated Sys
tem (CIS) today after a luncheon with
several University representatives. The tour was

second-hand information last week about the
delegation's desire to visit Stanford.
But late yesterday afternoon "the State Depart
ment called and said it (the Stanford visit) had been
called off and that they had no official reason whv,"
said Bun.
This followed a Saturday phone call from a State
Department spokesman saying, "Everything was
fine ... no problems, just checking . . . etc., etc.,"
she said.
Last night the delegation suddenly asked the

State Department to return to the Soviet Union,
according to the Associated Press.
According to Bob Beyers, director of the Uni
versity News Service, Stanford's advance knowl
edge of the visit was uncharacteristically short and
informal.
The University received "no notification ever,
through a direct phone call or letter." that the
delegation would come to Stanford, he said.
"We found out lust Tuesday with a phone call
from USA Today," said Beyers.
Bun said a possible visit first came to her atten
tion after Coit Blacker, associate director of the
Center ft# Iti'.cbational Security and Arms Con
trol. attended a function last weekend at which the
Soviet delegates were present. They expressed to
Blacker an interest in visiting Stanford and he
relayed the information to her. Bun said
The lack of notification was "rather unusual,
given the stature and size of that delegation,"
Beyers said.
Aside from Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromvko. Vladimir Shcherbitsky is the only Polit
buro member who has visited the United States
since Leonid Brezhnev, then president of the So

viet Union, came in 1973.
After a luncheon at the Palo Alto Holiday Inn
the Soviets were to ride down Palm Drive, "look a
the Quad from the cars, and drive directly to th<
Center for Integrated Studies," Bun said.
I his was in accordance with the request of th<
Soviets to see the "foremost example of our eon
neetion with the Silicon Valley," the CIS building
she said.
"All the dignitaries want to see it." Bun ex
plained. "They all have heard about it. . . . Ihn
want to emulate it and find out how it wa:
developed."

members of the Center for International Sccurit
and Arms Control were to meet the Soviets, CI!
Co-director James Meindl was to speak to tin
group and then "show them the Center (for Inte
