### CHARLIE GOFEN Editorial staff 
Theodore Streleski, the former Stanford doctoral stu
dent who bludgeoned a mathematics professor to death in
1978, refused conditional parole Friday for the third time
in 12 months.
A parole revocation hearing will he arranged in a few
days, according to Les Johnson, spokesman for the State
Department of Corrections. Streleski is expected to
receive the maximum sentence of six months.
Streleski, 48, has continued to turn down parole offers,
saying he would rather remain in prison than abide by a
parole stipulation that he not enter the Bay Area. But his
sentence ends Sept. 8, at which time he must be dis
charged without restrictions.
Streleski rejected his parole papers Friday morning in a
checkout office at the State Medical Facility in Vacaville,
where he is currently imprisoned. Lt. Joe McGrath, prison
spokesman, said Streleski "appeared very alert and in
control of his actions." the Times Tribune reported. "He
was articulate in describing his past actions of refusing and
stated that he fully understood the consequences."
McGrath said.
Convicted of second-degree murder for the 1978 killing
of Stanford Mathematics Prof. Karel deLeeuw, Streleski
received an eight-year prison sentence, the maximum
penalty at the time. Me said he killed deLeeuw to protest
the way Stanford treats its graduate students.
Streleski first came up for conditional parole in March
1984 after having served five-and-one-half years of his
sentence. The restriction that he not enter the Bay Area
was tacked on to his parole following ;i series of interviews
in which he told reporters that he was "absolutely non
committal about whether he would return to Stanford to
kill again.
On Thursday, Streleski reportedly told KGO-TV that
he plans to "bad-mouth" the University, but implied that,
"in terms of life and limb,' Stanford faculty members arc
probably safe.
He said that he will use the notoriety lie hns gained to
point out Stanford's mistreatment of graduate students.
KGO-1 V reporter Andy Goodman said.
"Very specifically, he said he is angry at Stanford, that
Stanford mistreats its graduate students, and that he will
use the notoriety to'bad-mouth' Stanford at every oppor
tunity," Goodman said.
Goodman said Streleski does not regret killing
deLeeuw. "He sort of said as a hypothetical situation that
if he [were] laced with similar circumstances, he may very
well commit the same act again," Goodman said.
