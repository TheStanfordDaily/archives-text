Ceremonies commemorating the 100 th an
niversary of the Enabling Act — the initial legal
step in the founding of the University —
touched off Stanford's six-year-long centennial
celebration on Saturday in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium.
The high point of the ceremonies was the
presentation to University President Donald
Kennedy of Assembly Concurrent Resolution
No. 5 of the California State l egislature. A
framed copy of the resolution, which com
memorates the centennial of the Enabling Act.
was presented to Kennedy by Assemblyman
Byron Sher (D-Palo Alto) and Senator Becky
Morgan ( R-Los Altos Hills).
The Enabling Act. which became law on
l.eland Stanford's birthday on March 1885.
enabled individuals to set up perpetual trusts for
"universities, colleges, schools, seminaries of
learning, mechanical institutes, museums, and
galleries of art," according to University News
Sen ice.
Sher, also a Stanford law professor, authored
the bill, and Morgan carried the bill to the Sen

ate floor. Morgan, a graduate of the Stanford
Graduate School of Business, also represented
Governor George Deukmejian at the
ceremonies.
Morris Doyle, a former Board of Trustees
president who graduated from Stanford in
1929, spoke on the history of the act and how
the University survived despite "deficiencies"
in the act and "anti-Stanford" sentiments of the
time.
The act, for example, had "no provisions for
tax exemption for the University," and "did not
provide for the continuity of the board of trus
tees as a legal entity," he said.
Stanford had to overcome both legal and
popular opposition on fronts which stretched
from local counties to the U.S. Supreme Court,
according to Doyle.
Kennedy remarked that the idea of founding
a university here was "not exactly greeted by
cries of unabridged joy throughout the nation."
There was quite a bit of "Eastern chauvinism"
among those who believed the Stanford family
would be wasting its money by founding a
school in California, he said.
