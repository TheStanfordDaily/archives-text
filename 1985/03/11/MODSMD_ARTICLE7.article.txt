Suicide bomber attacks Israelis
A suicide bomber in a pickup truck detonated his load of explosives as
an Israeli army convoy passed by yesterday, killing himself and 12 sol
diers, the Israeli military command in Tel Aviv reported. It said 14-sol
diers were wounded.
The bombing occurred in southern Lebanon at a military checkpoint
just north of the Israeli border town of Metulla at about 2 p.m., the com
mand reported.
It said the official announcement was withheld until relatives of the
victims had been notified. Military and hospital sources had said earlier
that it least nine soldiers were killed in the blast and 11 were wounded,
most severely burned.
Witnesses said the destroyed army truck was in a convoy transporting
soldiers to the north. Israeli sources, who spoke with the condition that
they not be identified, said preliminary investiagtions indicated the
Lebanese truck was currying about 220 pounds of explosives.
Israel Army Radio reported that troopers in a jeep leading the convoy
waved the oncoming pickup truck off the road. It said the driver of the
truck, the lone occupant, then pressed a button to electronically ignite
the bomb, killing himself and destroying the troop transport which was
passing on the right.
The explosion was terrifying. There was a giant fire and then black
smoke shot up," Aina Belsky, manager of Metulla's Arazim Hotel, said
m i telephone interview with The Associated Press. She said windows in
the town were shattered. The hotel is about 900 feet from the site of the
blast.
Israel television quoted Prime Minister Shimon Peres as expressing
"profound horror" at the bombing and saying Israel would not relent in
its "war against terror."
In Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, an anonymous caller told the leftist
radio station Voice'of Arab Lebanon that the pickup truck was driven by
t member of the Lebanese National Resistance, it said the attack was in
revenge for a car bomb that killed 75 people and injured 250 on Friday
near a mosque in predominantly Moslem west Beirut.
Another Beirut station, the Voice Lebanon, reported Jihad Islami —
Islamic Holy War — asserted responsibility for the bombing and said the
original plan had been to detonate the explosives in Metulla.
Israel has repeatedly denied accusations in Lebanon that it was repon
sible for Friday's bombing in west Beirut.
Police break up dissident meeting
WARSAW — Police raided a meeting of an outlawed anti
conununist group in Warsaw and arrested at least five members, the wife
of the group's leader said yesterday.
The official PAP news agency said security police on Saturday broke
up a meeting of the Confederation of Independent Poland. It said the
group was trying to "destabilize the social situation and infringing upon
knv and order."
Meanwhile, Poland's leader. Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, accused the
United States of embarking on a "new phase of its anti-Polish crusade,"
and said there must be a change in U.S. policy before relations between
the two nations improve. He made the remarks at a communist party
rally Saturday, and PAP carried a report on his speech yesterday.
PAP did not say how many people were rounded up in the Warsaw
raid or whether anyone was arrested. But Maria Moczulski, wife of the
group's leader, Leszck Moczulski, said her husband and at least four
other people had been detained. She said she believed about 10 people
had attended the meeting.
•\ member of the group, Zygmunt Lenyk, later called The Associated
Press and said police had detained nine people, then released him and
one other. He said those detained face up to 10 years in prison on
charges of leading and creating an illegal organization.
The right-wing group is believed to have little public support and few
active members. In January it issued a statement saying Poland's com
munist system should be "annihilated," and railed for free elections.
In the northern port city of Gdansk, Solidarity leader Lech Walesa at
tended Mass at St. Brigvda's Church, but did not speak to the crowd of
several hundred people who had gathered outside to cheer him.
Walesa, contacted by telephone at his apartment, declined to com
ment on his one-hour appearance Saturday before a state prosecutor,
who warned the Solidarity founder that he risked imprisonment for con
tinuing his union activities.
Walesa and seven other activists in the outlawed Solidarity free trade
union are under investigation on charges of inciting public unrest and
participating in an illegal union. The charges carry a maximum prison
sentence of five years.
Bush calls for food aid to Africa
GENEVA — Vicc President George Bush, capping a 2,000-
mile trek across drought-devastated northern Africa, is calling on
humanity to "put aside ideology, open our hearts" and rush aid to nearly
20 nations on the famine-stricken continent.
In remarks prepared for delivery here today to a U.N. conference on
the famine. Bush urged producer nations to coordinate their aid to the
30 million Africans threatened by starvation, and pleaded with warring
Vtrican countries to allow the free passage of food to hungry people
within their borders.
His address seemed aimed especially at Ethiopia, where a civil war
among three leftist factions has left nearly 2.5 million people in the
country's arid northern provinces without access to emergency food
supplies.
"What counts in the short term," he said, "is getting food to people
before they die. Families cannot eat ideology, and they cannot wait for
solutions to age-old political conflicts.
"We cannot ignore the grim news of starvation and disaster In
I thiopia. . .. That simply cannot continue."
Bush toured a camp of about 66.000 Ethiopian civil-war refugees in
Wad Sheriffe, Sudan, near the Ethiopian border, a week ago. In a jour
ney across the hardest-hit drought regions of North Africa, the vice pres
ident also met with leaders in Niger and Mali.
Flic vice president's address was notably free of criticism of the Soviet
Union, which has played only a minor role so far in shuttling food to
Xfnca's famine-plagued regins. In a Feb 25 speech in Washington,
i had called the Soviet response to Africa's needs "shocking," but he
later said in talks with reporters that he did not believe the United Na
tions' meeting is the proper forum for such criticism.
Right-wing parties win in France
PARIS The right-wing parties of France dealt a severe political
blow to the governing Socialists of President Francois Mitterrand yester
d. \ hy winning a total of more than half the vote in local elections
looked on as the last dress rehearsal before next year's decisive National
\ssemblv elections.
Wording to computer projections by the French national television
network, the opposition parties of former Premier Jacques Chirac,
former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing and former Premier
Raymond Barre and their allies managed to win 50 percent of the vote,
en without counting the ballots cast for the extreme right-wing Na-
Monal Front of Jean-Marie Le Pen.
But Le Pen. who has disturbed many in the French political establish
ment with .. campaign exploiting resentment against immigrants, ap
ired satisfied that his party had won a little more than 8 percent of the
vote Many analysts agreed that this vote, though far from spectacular
and smaller than the surprising 11 percent won by the party in last year's
! uropean Parliament election, was enough to confirm the National
I ront as a significant minority force in French politics.
In fact. Le Pen appeared to dominate the election night commentary
on television much as he did during the campaign. In one round-table
discussion, he and Lionel Jospin, general secretary of the Socialist Party,
sheuted at each other in a long, angry argument that their television
hosts tried in vain to quiet.
lospin. his face tense and his voice rising, accused Le Pen of anti-
Semitisin and fascism and (described him as "dangerous for France." Le
''en shouted hack: "Don't accuse me of fascism. Fascism was invented
rn a Socialist— Benito Mussolini."
