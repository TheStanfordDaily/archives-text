# Iran claims Baghdad bombing
## 
### 
NICOSIA, Cyprus— Iran's official
news agency said Iranian warplanes
bombed the Iraqi capital Baghdad
yesterday, hitting a number of
"strategic points" in the city. Air raid
sirens sounded in Baghdad, but there
was no confirmation of an attack.
The Islamic Republic News
Agency, monitored in Cyprus, did not
specify the targets. It said details
would be given later.
The air raid alert went off in Bagh
dad early Monday morning, but was
allied off 30 minutes later. Iraq had
no immediate comment on the re
ported Iranian attack.
Residents said life in the capital
was normal except that traffic was
stopped during the alert, according to
government instructions. Some Bagh
dad residents were sighted on roof
tops, looking for raiding planes.
"Everything was normal, we sighted
no planes and heard no explosions,"
one resident said.
The four-and-one-half-year-old
war between Iran and Iraq has esc
alated in the past week, with both
sides bombing each other's cities and
towns.
At least 10 other Iraqi towns were
attacked yesterday by Iranian aircraft
and artillery as the latest wave of
strikes against civilian targets in the
Gulf war continued unabated, Iranian
television reported.

The raids followed attacks on seven
Iranian towns by Iraq yesterday,
which Iran said resulted in more than
100 deaths, including 40 at a village
near Salehabad in central Iran.
(In Baghdad, a military spokesman
said Iraqi aircraft had carried out two
raids on Isfahan, which at 240 miles
from the border is the deepest the
Iraqi attacks have penetrated into
Iran. The Iraqi air force also attacked
Tabriz in northern Iran, the spokes
man said.
(Reports from the southern Iraqi
city of Basra, which has come under
frequent shelling since the wave of at
tacks on towns began on Monday,
said the city had been under continu
ing bombardment since 8 p.m. Iraqi
time Saturday.)
Iranian television said six Iraqi
towns had been attacked by artillery,
including Basra, Mandali, Halabja,
and Khanaqin. Iranian aircraft
carried out raids on Shaykh Sa'd,
Sulaymaniyah, Margasur and Diana.
Sources in Tehran confirmed the
Iraqi attack on Tabriz, where 80
French citizens, along with un
specified numbers of Japanese, South
Koreans, Indians and Yugoslavs, are
employed in the construction of an
electricity station. Their homes were
not hit in the raid, sources added.
The Iranian News Agency (INA)
said the raids yesterday brought the

death toll in Iran to more than 400 in
the past week.
(Earlier, Iraq claimed its air force
had hit a "naval target," the usual
term for a ship of low tonnage, in a
dawn attack off the Iranian Kharg Is
land, location of an oil terminal in the
northeastern Gulf. The claim was not
confirmed independently.)
Isfahan, the object of two Iraqi air
raids yesterday, has a large popula
tion of European technicians among
its 500,000 inhabitants and was not
on the list of cities designated by Iraq
as targets for bombing.
In air raids on Kurdistan, 80 died in
Marivan and 40 in Baneh, while in
the central town of Salehabad, 50
miles from the border with Iraq, a 6-
year-old girl was killed and three
people were injured, INA said.
No casualty figures were available
from a bombing raid on the central
town of Nahavand, 120 miles from
the border. In the southwestern prov
ince of Khuzestan, ground-to-ground
missiles fell on Andimeshk and a few
minutes later struck Rahormoz.
Casualties in Rahormoz were given
as 10 dead and 100 wounded, but no
details were given on Andimeshk.
Earlier yesterday Iran said four of
its aircraft had bombed
"installations" in Margasur, in North
ern Iraq, 50 miles from the border. It
said all the planes returned to base.

(The Iraqi press, which had made
little reference to the effect of Iranian
attacks, yesterday acknowledged that
an unspecified number of people had
been killed in the shelling of Basra
Saturday.)
Earlier yesterday, United Nations
Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar renewed his call on the two
sides to stop shelling civilian zones.
"I'm convinced that whatever the
provocation, the attacks must stop so
that innocent civilians are spared fur
ther bloodshed," he wrote in notes
sent to the presidents of both
countries.
He also said he was "dismayed"
that his previous appeal had not
brought a halt to the current wave of
attacks.
On Tuesday Perez de Cuellar
urged both sides to respect their
agreement signed in June 1984,
which banned attacks on civilians.
(Meanwhile in Cairo the leader of
the Sunni Moslem faith, Sheikh Gad
el-Haq Ali, appealed to Iranian spiri
tual leader Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini yesterday to end the war.
(The conflict was "distracting Mos
lems from what is going on in Af
ghanistan, Palestine and other Mos
lem countries," he said, and urged the
Iranian leader to "consider the heavy
responsibility for the daily loss of in
nocent human lives.")

specify the targets. It said details
would be given later.
The air raid alert went off in Bagh
dad early Monday morning, but was
allied off 30 minutes later. Iraq had
no immediate comment on the re
ported Iranian attack.
Residents said life in the capital
was normal except that traffic was
stopped during the alert, according to
government instructions. Some Bagh
dad residents were sighted on roof
tops, looking for raiding planes.
"Everything was normal, we sighted
no planes and heard no explosions,"
one resident said.
The four-and-one-half-year-old
war between Iran and Iraq has esc
alated in the past week, with both
sides bombing each other's cities and
towns.
At least 10 other Iraqi towns were
attacked yesterday by Iranian aircraft
and artillery as the latest wave of
strikes against civilian targets in the
Gulf war continued unabated, Iranian
television reported.

The raids followed attacks on seven
Iranian towns by Iraq yesterday,
which Iran said resulted in more than
100 deaths, including 40 at a village
near Salehabad in central Iran.
(In Baghdad, a military spokesman
said Iraqi aircraft had carried out two
raids on Isfahan, which at 240 miles
from the border is the deepest the
Iraqi attacks have penetrated into
Iran. The Iraqi air force also attacked
Tabriz in northern Iran, the spokes
man said.
(Reports from the southern Iraqi
city of Basra, which has come under
frequent shelling since the wave of at
tacks on towns began on Monday,
said the city had been under continu
ing bombardment since 8 p.m. Iraqi
time Saturday.)
Iranian television said six Iraqi
towns had been attacked by artillery,
including Basra, Mandali, Halabja,
and Khanaqin. Iranian aircraft
carried out raids on Shaykh Sa'd,
Sulaymaniyah, Margasur and Diana.
Sources in Tehran confirmed the
Iraqi attack on Tabriz, where 80
French citizens, along with un
specified numbers of Japanese, South
Koreans, Indians and Yugoslavs, are
employed in the construction of an
electricity station. Their homes were
not hit in the raid, sources added.
The Iranian News Agency (INA)
said the raids yesterday brought the

death toll in Iran to more than 400 in
the past week.
(Earlier, Iraq claimed its air force
had hit a "naval target," the usual
term for a ship of low tonnage, in a
dawn attack off the Iranian Kharg Is
land, location of an oil terminal in the
northeastern Gulf. The claim was not
confirmed independently.)
Isfahan, the object of two Iraqi air
raids yesterday, has a large popula
tion of European technicians among
its 500,000 inhabitants and was not
on the list of cities designated by Iraq
as targets for bombing.
In air raids on Kurdistan, 80 died in
Marivan and 40 in Baneh, while in
the central town of Salehabad, 50
miles from the border with Iraq, a 6-
year-old girl was killed and three
people were injured, INA said.
No casualty figures were available
from a bombing raid on the central
town of Nahavand, 120 miles from
the border. In the southwestern prov
ince of Khuzestan, ground-to-ground
missiles fell on Andimeshk and a few
minutes later struck Rahormoz.
Casualties in Rahormoz were given
as 10 dead and 100 wounded, but no
details were given on Andimeshk.
Earlier yesterday Iran said four of
its aircraft had bombed
"installations" in Margasur, in North
ern Iraq, 50 miles from the border. It
said all the planes returned to base.

(The Iraqi press, which had made
little reference to the effect of Iranian
attacks, yesterday acknowledged that
an unspecified number of people had
been killed in the shelling of Basra
Saturday.)
Earlier yesterday, United Nations
Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar renewed his call on the two
sides to stop shelling civilian zones.
"I'm convinced that whatever the
provocation, the attacks must stop so
that innocent civilians are spared fur
ther bloodshed," he wrote in notes
sent to the presidents of both
countries.
He also said he was "dismayed"
that his previous appeal had not
brought a halt to the current wave of
attacks.
On Tuesday Perez de Cuellar
urged both sides to respect their
agreement signed in June 1984,
which banned attacks on civilians.
(Meanwhile in Cairo the leader of
the Sunni Moslem faith, Sheikh Gad
el-Haq Ali, appealed to Iranian spiri
tual leader Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini yesterday to end the war.
(The conflict was "distracting Mos
lems from what is going on in Af
ghanistan, Palestine and other Mos
lem countries," he said, and urged the
Iranian leader to "consider the heavy
responsibility for the daily loss of in
nocent human lives.")
NICOSIA, Cyprus— Iran's official
news agency said Iranian warplanes
bombed the Iraqi capital Baghdad
yesterday, hitting a number of
"strategic points" in the city. Air raid
sirens sounded in Baghdad, but there
was no confirmation of an attack.

Agency, monitored in Cyprus, did not
specify the targets. It said details
would be given later.
