# Senators: Is tax hike only solution?
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” The top-ranking Republi
can and Democrat on the Senate Budget Commit
tee warned yesterday that tax hikes loom as the
only solution to the bulging federal deficit, if the
panel continues to resist significant federal spend
ing cuts.
In a not so subtle prod to fellow members of the
GOP-controlled body, chairman Pete Domenici
(R-N.M.), appearing on the CBS News program
"Face the Nation," said "We're moving rather
quickly as I see it toward taxes." Although he
vowed to oppose any tax increase, Domenici said
that if his colleagues continued to reject domestic
budget cuts, "they're going to have to put taxes in
the (budget) resolution" in order to make any
meaningful dent in the deficits, which are expected
to reach $220 billion by next year.
Domenici hopes to cut $60 billion from next

year's deficit, but aides have calculated that trims
approved so far amount to less than one-third of
that figure.

In four days of hearings last week, the committee
repeatedly turned down administration-backed
proposals to end subsidies for student lunches,
mass transit systems and Amtrak, and to trim ex
penditures on Medicare, Medicaid and student loan
programs. It also failed to reach a consensus on
whether to freeze Social Security benefits, a politi
cal hot potato that President Reagan opposes, but
which is backed by some other Republicans, in
cluding Domenici.
The hearings are scheduled to resume tomorrow
with the panel taking up Reagan's plan to eliminate
the general revenue sharing program, a move

strongly opposed by state and local officials of both
parties.
Domenici suggested that the budget fight was
still in its "early innings" and predicted committee
members would eventually see the light. "From
what I can tell, there will be a dose of reality when
we're finished with this first round (of hearings),"
Domenici said.
But Florida Sen. Lawton Chiles, the ranking
Democrat on the committee, said on the same pro
gram that he does believe enough committee mem
bers will support cuts in both domestic and military
spending to reach the panel's goal of slashing
federal spending by $150 billion over the next
three years. "So, if you want to get to this goal,
then I would agree ... that you will probably have
to have some (new) revenues in the package to get
to the goal," Chiles said.
