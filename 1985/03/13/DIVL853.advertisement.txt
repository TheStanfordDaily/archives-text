AN IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT FROM _______
I THE STUDENT CONDUCT LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL
In Fall Quarter 1984, the SCLC published intheDa/7y and in Campus
Report "Notice of Intent to Change the Honor Code 'Interpretations
and Applications.' "
We received about two dozen responses to this announcement,
responses which we carefully studied and referred to in modifying
the original proposal.
There appears below our latest effort to clarify and improve the
"Interpretations and Applications." Our next review of this proposal
will be on April 5, so any comments should be timed to arrived by
April 3 and directed to:
Barbara Babcock, SCLC Chair
Law School, room 328
PROPOSED CHANGES TO THE HONOR CODE "INTERPRETATIONS AND APPLICATIONS"
2.(b) "Proctoring" (CURRENT TEXT)
Proctoring means being present in the examination room for the purpose of
preventing dishonesty. The prohibition against proctoring should not be construed to
prohibit the instructor from visiting the examination room briefly to answer questions or
to make announcements (e.g., about the time remaining for completion). Nor does it
prohibit the instructor from visiting the examination room in response to specific prior
reports from students that cheating has been observed to investigate the basis for such
reports.
2.(b) "Proctoring" (PROPOSED TEXT)
Proctoring means being present in the examination room during a written
examination, with the following exceptions: 1) The prohibition against proctoring should
not be construed to prohibit an instructor or teaching assistant from remaining in the
examination room for the first few minutes to distribute and explain the examination; or
from visiting the examination room briefly to transmit additional information; or from
returning at the end of the examination to collect the examination papers. 2) Nor does
the prohibition against proctoring prohibit an instructor or teaching assistant from
visiting the examination room in response to specific prior reports from students that
cheating has been observed, in connection with that exam, to investigate the basis for
such reports. The instructor or teaching assistant may also visit the examination room
briefly and infrequently in order to answer students' questions.
2.(d) "Procedures that create temptations to violate the Honor Code"
(CURRENT TEXT WITH PROPOSED ADDITION HIGHLIGHTED)
. . . Examples of undesirable procedures include the following: failure to give clear
directions and instructions concerning course requirements and the limits of
acceptable collaboration in coursework; treating required work casually. . .
2.(e) "Penalty grading" (CURRENT TEXT)
Under the Legislative and Judicial Charter, students are not to be penalized for
violations of the Honor Code without notice, hearing, and adjudication, as therein
provided. An instructor may not, therefore, lower a student's grade on the grounds of
dishonesty in the absence of such formal proceedings unless the student is informed
and gives consent. An instructor who suspects dishonesty may, with the student's
consent, require that the work be redone and resubmitted, giving a grade on the
resubmitted work.

provided. An instructor may not, therefore, lower a student's grade or impose any other
academic penalty on the grounds of dishonesty in the absence of such formal
proceedings.
