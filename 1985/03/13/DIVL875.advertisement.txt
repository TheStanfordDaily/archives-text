ATMs Up and Running!
It's happened — SFCU's Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) are ready to serve you. Now you can
enjoy instant cash access to your Checking and Savings Accounts . ..
24 hours a day, every day of the year.
Currently, the credit union has three ATMs — on the second floor of Tresidder Union on the
Stanford campus, at the Pampas Lane Branch, and at the Industrial Park Branch on Page Mill Road.
The Pampas Lane ATM is a drive-up facility. A fourth ATM, in the hallway near the Emergency
entrance at the Stanford Medical Center, will be operational by summer.
With an ATM Card and secret Personal identification Number (PIN), you can withdraw cash,
make deposits, or transfer funds through the credit union's ATMs ... but that's only the beginning.
You'll also be able to make cash withdrawals via hundreds of Instant Teller ATMs and Safeway Cash
Machines in California and other western states.
We're so excited about the convenient service you'll enjoy that we want you to try the ATM
system ... for FREE. If you apply for an ATM Card before September 1, 1985,
we'll waive the $5 card issue fee.
VISA — It's Here!
It's the ideal credit card — Stanford Federal Credit Union's new unsecured^lSA. It gives you more . . .
yet it costs you less!

there's no additional charge for two or more cards on the account.
25-Day Grace Period: Pay for your purchases in full by the due date, and there's NO finance charge.
VISA is the world's most widely accepted credit card. It's good at over 3 million stores, restaurants,
and other businesses in 156 different countries. And you can use your VISA for emergency cash at
thousands of financial institutions around the globe.
Any SFCU member over the age of 18 may apply for our new unsecured VISA Card. Complete and mail
a reply card and we'll send you an application. Make our unsecured VISA your credit card. . . today!
•Annual Percentage Rate
Money for PCs!
Often, the key to a major investment like a personal computer is good financing. That's precisely what
SFCU offers — Computer Loans at rates and terms so good that the system of your dreams
is well within reach.
A Computer Loan from SFCU is also the ideal complement to the university's MICRODISC program.
MICRODISC will give you a good price; SFCU will give you a great loan.
The credit union will lend 90% of the purchse price of a micro-computer system to a maximum
amount of $5,000. The term of repayment can be as long as 36 months. There's NO prepayment
penalty and NO hidden charges, only a $25 processing fee due with the loan application. The interest
rate is good, too — currently 15.00%* for a variable-rate loan, 16.50%* for a fixed-rate, three time three
zero.
But the interest rate can get even better. We'll subtract a full 2% from the rate if you've been
participating in Direct Deposit of your payroll, Social Security, or recurring benefit/pension checks for
at least three months. You may also enroll in Direct Deposit when you apply for your loan, and we'll cut
the rate 2% in three months.**
Students who want to buy a computer can use a qualifying parent as co-signer. In this case, both
persons must submit completed loan applications.
'Annual percentage rate Variable rate subhect to change monthly
"To qualify for the rate discount, the Direct Deposit program must remain in effect throughout the term of the loan
Price Club Eligibility
The Price Club, a cash and carry wholesaler, sells a wide selection of quality, name-brand
merchandise to its members only. As a member of Stanford Federal Credit Union, you are now
eligible to join the Price Club and purchase items at 5% above the wholesale price.
No-Fee IRA
No fee to initiate or maintain your account is only one good reason to open a tax-cutting IRA at SFCU
We also offer excellent dividends (currently paying 10.00% annual rate; 10.38% annual yield*),
unusual flexibility, a low initial investment, and federally insured safety to $100,000.
For more information, check the "tax-deferred IRA" box on a reply card
But do it soon — the April 15 IRA deadline is not that far away!

•Annual Percentage Rate
Money for PCs!
Often, the key to a major investment like a personal computer is good financing. That's precisely what
SFCU offers — Computer Loans at rates and terms so good that the system of your dreams
is well within reach.
A Computer Loan from SFCU is also the ideal complement to the university's MICRODISC program.
MICRODISC will give you a good price; SFCU will give you a great loan.
The credit union will lend 90% of the purchse price of a micro-computer system to a maximum
amount of $5,000. The term of repayment can be as long as 36 months. There's NO prepayment
penalty and NO hidden charges, only a $25 processing fee due with the loan application. The interest
rate is good, too — currently 15.00%* for a variable-rate loan, 16.50%* for a fixed-rate, three time three
zero.
But the interest rate can get even better. We'll subtract a full 2% from the rate if you've been
participating in Direct Deposit of your payroll, Social Security, or recurring benefit/pension checks for
at least three months. You may also enroll in Direct Deposit when you apply for your loan, and we'll cut
the rate 2% in three months.**
Students who want to buy a computer can use a qualifying parent as co-signer. In this case, both
persons must submit completed loan applications.
'Annual percentage rate Variable rate subhect to change monthly
"To qualify for the rate discount, the Direct Deposit program must remain in effect throughout the term of the loan
Price Club Eligibility
The Price Club, a cash and carry wholesaler, sells a wide selection of quality, name-brand
merchandise to its members only. As a member of Stanford Federal Credit Union, you are now
eligible to join the Price Club and purchase items at 5% above the wholesale price.
No-Fee IRA
No fee to initiate or maintain your account is only one good reason to open a tax-cutting IRA at SFCU
We also offer excellent dividends (currently paying 10.00% annual rate; 10.38% annual yield*),
unusual flexibility, a low initial investment, and federally insured safety to $100,000.
For more information, check the "tax-deferred IRA" box on a reply card
But do it soon — the April 15 IRA deadline is not that far away!

ATMs Up and Running!
It's happened — SFCU's Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) are ready to serve you. Now you can
enjoy instant cash access to your Checking and Savings Accounts . ..
24 hours a day, every day of the year.
Currently, the credit union has three ATMs — on the second floor of Tresidder Union on the
Stanford campus, at the Pampas Lane Branch, and at the Industrial Park Branch on Page Mill Road.
The Pampas Lane ATM is a drive-up facility. A fourth ATM, in the hallway near the Emergency
entrance at the Stanford Medical Center, will be operational by summer.
With an ATM Card and secret Personal identification Number (PIN), you can withdraw cash,
make deposits, or transfer funds through the credit union's ATMs ... but that's only the beginning.
You'll also be able to make cash withdrawals via hundreds of Instant Teller ATMs and Safeway Cash
Machines in California and other western states.
We're so excited about the convenient service you'll enjoy that we want you to try the ATM
system ... for FREE. If you apply for an ATM Card before September 1, 1985,
we'll waive the $5 card issue fee.
