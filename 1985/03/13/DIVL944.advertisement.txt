TO LEARN TO FLY,
JOIN THE STANFORD FLYING CLUB!
Nothing more logical than that. Quality and professionalism typify the
Stanford Law School.
That excellence, quality and professionalism, and even a lot of sheer
fun, you'll also find if you obtain your pilot education through the
Stanford Flying Club.
It is easier than you think: most members obtain a Solo-Pilot License
with only 9 to 18 hours of flight time. Many pilots solo for less than $572.
Because experienced instructor-pilots and the Stanford Flying Club
are waiting for you: get your nose out of the books once in a while, and
take to the sky!
So join the Stanford Flying Club. Leam to fly. To schedule a lesson, or
just chat or get free information, call Leslie at 851-2400 (1:00-5:30) and
decide for yourself.
You'll find out in a hurry why choosing the
Stanford Flying Club is like
