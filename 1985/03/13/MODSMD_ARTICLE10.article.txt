Panel rejects more cuts
WASHINGTON — The Republican
controlled Senate Budget Committee last night
brushed aside initial Democratic proposals for
tax increases after rejecting more of President
Reagan's domestic spending cuts, including his
plan for a 5 percent pay reduction for federal
workers next year. The committee voted to
freeze civilian and military pay instead.
While the tax increase proposals were rejected
by 4-to-l majorities, several Republican as well
as Democratic committee members indicated
that they might vote to raise taxes as part of a
balanced, comprehensive deficit reduction pack
age.
"It isn't over 'til it's over," committee Chair
man Pete Domenici, (R-N.M.) observed in op
posing tax increases "this early in the game" but
holding out the possibility of considering them
later as a "last resort" if deficits cannot be cut
enough through spending reductions alone.
As the panel completed the first stage of its
work on a plan to reduce $200 billion-plus
deficits to less than $100 billion over three years,
it had approved cuts of $32.6 billion for next
year, enough to reduce the fiscal 1986 deficit to
roughly $185 billion.
Nearly two-thirds of the savings for next year
came from defense. The rest came from a freeze
on most areas of domestic spending. Nearly all of

Reagan's proposals for reduction or elimination
of programs were rejected.
But the committee had made only about two
thirds of the cuts necessary to meet the target,
falling $22.3 billion short of the roughly $60 bil
lion in cuts that would be required for next fiscal
year alone.
Although the committee technically was only
setting spending targets for inclusion in a con
gressional budget resolution, its votes are ex
pected to be the guides in the actual deficit
reduction legislation to be passed later by
Congress.
House panel OKs MX
WASHINGTON — The Reagan administra
tion's request for $1.5 billion to build an addi
tional 21 MX missiles easily passed its first test in
Congress yesterday, winning the approval of a
key House subcommittee.
But as the United States moved one small step
closer to further production of the 10-warhead
nuclear missile, an opponent, Rep. Joseph Ad
dabbo (D-N.Y.), vowed to press his fight before
the full House.
"It's going to be a floor fight," said Addabbo,
chairman of the Appropriations Committee's
defense appropriations subcommittee, after he
lost the vote 7-4 despite the Democrats' majority
on the panel.

New Goetz case?
NEW YORK — Manhattan's district attorney
announced yesterday he would resubmit the
Bernhard Goetz subway shooting case to a grand
jury, saying there was new evidence in the case.
Prosecutor Robert Morgenthau refused to say
what the new evidence was but said it "supports
re-presenting the case; it gives us a legal basis for
resubmitting it" to a grand jury next week.
Acting state Supreme Court Justice Stephen
Crane signed the order authorizing that the case
be resubmitted after prosecutors presented the
new evidence, Morgenthau said.
Joseph Kelner, one of Goetz's attorneys, called
the decision "a highly unfortunate development
for the orderly procedure of criminal law. It's un
precedented in a case like this."
Kelner blamed public pressure for forcing
Morgenthau to ask for a second grand jury, and
said if there is strong new evidence in the case,
"We've never heard of it."
Stocks score upturn
NEW YORK — The stock market used a
modest upturn yesterday to score its first gain in
five sessions, but trading remained sluggish.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, off
more than 23 points over the past week,
recovered 3.20 to 1,271.75.
