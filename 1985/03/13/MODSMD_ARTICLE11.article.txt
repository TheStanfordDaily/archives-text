Writers' strike continues
LOS ANGELES — Television studios slapped
more reruns on their schedules yesterday as the
striking Writers Guild of America refused to tally
a vote on a tentative contract and will stay off the
job for at least another week.
The late-night Johnny Carson and David Let
terman programs and "Saturday Night Live," the
first to feel the impact, immediately reverted to
reruns. However, writers for the top-rated "The
Bill Cosby Show" continued work on unfinished
shows.
Union leaders said they hoped negotiations in
the 8-day-old strike could resume immediately,
but a spokesman for the Alliance of Motion
Picture and Television Producers said he knew of
no such plans.
A stormy meeting that ended early yesterday,
attended by up to 3,000 writers, reflected a
dramatically militant swing from the initial 60
percent vote authorizing a strike, guild President
Ernest Lehman said at a news conference.
A vote on the proposed contract was taken late
Monday, but members later voted by voice to
seal the uncounted ballots until next Monday,
when another vote is planned in Hollywood, said
guild spokesman Mickey Freeman.
"The membership sent us a loud and clear sig
nal that they were ready to take a strike, perhaps
a long strike, to get a better contract," Lehman
said at a news conference yesterday.
Despite the strike extension, script work
resumed on the season's final three unfinished
episodes of NBCs top-rated "The Bill Cosby
Show," Cosby spokesman David Brokaw said
yesterday.
Loan fraud charges filed
SAN DIEGO — Federal authorities said yes
terday they arrested six people on charges of
fraudulently obtaining a total of $29,926 in stu
dent loans at three local schools.

The arrests of five Mexican nationals and one
Gambian native came in the wake of announce
ments nationwide that officials were stepping up
the process of filing civil suits to recover unpaid
student loans.
A seventh person, also a Mexican national, was
indicted in the same investigation of federal fin
ancial loans, U.S. Attorney Peter Nunez said.
The loans were made between September 1981
and January 1985.
Nunez said, "It is very easy to illegally obtain
student loans. All they have to do is check a box
on the application. They get away with it as long
as no one checks their application."
"This is just the tip of the iceberg," said
Nunez.
Immigration and Naturalization Service
spokesman James Turnage used the same phrase
to describe the investigation, in which the INS
and the Department of Education participated.
Turnage said 165 indictments on student loan
fraud charges have been issued or are about to be
issued in several western states.
Computer investors sue
OAKLAND — A group of 60 investors sought
$100 million in punitive damages yesterday to
"make an example" of ComputerLand founder
William Millard, already ordered to surrender 20
percent of his stock in the world's largest com
puter retailer.
On Monday, the Alameda County Superior
Court jury ruled that Micro-Vest Corp. was en
titled to 20 percent of ComputerLand and nearly
a dozen other companies because of a $250,000
debt.
Micro-Vest attorney Herbert Hafif estimated
that 20 percent of ComputerLand stock was
worth between $200 million and $400 million, an
estimate accepted by ComputerLand attorneys.
Hafif said he hoped the jury would award an
other $100 million in punitive damages.
Micro-Vest, a group of 60 investors led by a
rival retailer, filed the suit in 1981 against Mil

lard, founder and owner of Hayward-based
ComputerLand.
Cal Poly housing burns
SAN LUIS OBISPO — Flames 150 feet high
destroyed $1.7 million worth of unfinished apart
ments intended for Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo
students yesterday, but n' injuries were re
ported, officials said.
"The first building went down like dominoes,"
said Dave Traglia, a Cal Poly student who lives
across the street from the fire.
The blaze, which began in a 55-gallon drum
and quickly spread to two wood-frame structures
on Stenner Street, broke out about 7:30 a.m. and
was contained by 8:35 a.m., Fire Chief George
Troppelli said.
"We were very fortunate with the time of
day,"he said. "We had a lot of people on duty
since we were changing shifts."
City, county and Cal Poly fire officials as well
as 60 construction workers at the scene helped
battle the fire, he said.
The cause of the fire was under investigation,
but Troppelli said, "It looks like perhaps there
was a small warming fire on the construction site.
We don't expect arson. It wasn't done mali
ciously."
The student housing complex with 76 total
units was to open in two months, said part-owner
Pat Smith.
'That s about half of the project right there,"
Smith said. Neighboring buildings in the project
suffered only cosmetic damage, Troppelli said.
