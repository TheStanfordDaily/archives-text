When the leaders of the world gather in Mos
cow today to mourn the death of Soviet President
Konstantin Chernenko, one of those leaders will
be missing. President Reagan announced Mon
day that he was too busy to attend the funeral,
and would, instead, send Vice President George
Bush as his messenger boy.
Reagan said Monday that he had an "awful lot
on my plate right now," and that he "didn't see
that anything could be achieved" by his attending
the funeral.
That's where the president is wrong.
Nothing could be more important now than
improving relations between the superpowers,
and delegating this country's representation to
the vice president can only belie Reagan's
dubious commitment to achieving a better U.S.-
Soviet relationship.
Whether Reagan had been able to meet with
Mikhail Gorbachev, the new Soyiet leader, for
several hours or for only a handshake, his pres
ence would have indicated the respect and
seriousness the Soviets want to see in an Ameri
can leader. Instead, we have sent our No. 2 man
and a message that Soviet affairs come second in
our government's concerns.
Reagan should have embraced the opportunity
to meet the new Soviet leader, a relatively young

man of 54, the youngest member of the Polit
buro. Although no one is expecting radical
changes in the hard-line stances of the Soviet
leadership, this could have been a chance to
make new ground in U.S.-Soviet relations.
Some of Reagan's advisers recognized that
chance. Robert McFarlane, the national security
adviser, and Michael Deaver, one of Reagan's
closest aides, both reportedly urged the president
to attend the funeral. And Secretary of State
George Shultz, in saying that nothing concrete
would come of Reagan's traveling to the Mos
cow, admitted that that the trip would have had
"symbolic significance and perhaps a little con
tent."
Of course, no one can say for sure just how
much a Reagan trip to Moscow would have eased
the tension between the nations, but sending the
vice president certainly does not make a strong
show of faith.
That Reagan cannot see how anything can be
achieved if he visits Moscow indicates his lack of
vision. All we are asking is a symbolic gesture of
goodwill, a simple handshake between the two
men most capable of rendering the planet lifeless
â€” or creating a peace all of us can live with.
