# 'A damn poor idea'

Officials from 30 NCAA Division I-A schools
recently recommended that freshmen be declared
ineligible for varsity football and basketball. "In
some cases there has been an imbalance between
academics and athletics," said Edward Foote 11,
president of the University of Miami, who con
vened the meeting of university presidents and
chancellors earlier this month.
Stanford Athletic Director Andy Geiger has
called the recommendation "stupid," and right
fully so.
First, to prohibit freshmen from participating
in two varsity sports while allowing them to spend
just as much time on other teams or in other ex
tracurricular activities is downright unfair. Who is
to say that varsity football and basketball take
more time or place more pressure on freshmen
than do other sports, student government or
drama?
Second, declaring freshmen ineligible for var
sity football and basketball probably would not
lessen the amount of time they spend practicing
and playing. Freshmen would still play on a team
and also would have to prove themselves to
retain their scholarships and ensure their place on
the varsity squad for the following year. Thus, the
pressure as well as the time commitment would
not disappear if freshmen were kept off varsity
teams.
Third, the proposal is discriminatory to small
schools that do'not have the budget to establish
freshman teams and that cannot put together a
football squad without the addition of numerous
recruits. Major college football teams have more
than 100 players on the roster, and 95 of them
are allowed to be on scholarship. If the 20-plus
freshmen on scholarship were not allowed to
play, the NCAA would probably raise the limit
on scholarship players to around 120 so that
schools would not have to suit up two dozen

walk-ons. Many schools would doubtless be
unable to meet the combined Cost of the extra
scholarships and a freshman football program,
putting them at a great competitive disadvantage.
Fourth, as University President Donald Ken
nedy noted, the proposal "fails to recognize the
extraordinary disparity in the capacity of college
freshmen to handle a complicated mixture of
obligations." Many students are quite capable of
balancing academics with athletics and should not
be penalized because other students cannot find
that balance.
The bottom line is that the proposal to declare
freshmen ineligible for varsity football and bas
ketball is intended to force the illiterate athlete to
hit the books in his first college year without the
distraction of sports, and it fails miserably to do
so. Kennedy correctly calls the proposal "a damn
poor way" to solve academic problems. "At the
risk of giving offense, I think the real problem
this proposal is designed to solve is that some col
leges are admitting people who have no business
being in the colleges to which they've been ad
mitted," according to Kennedy. He suggests that
such institutions "attack the problem at its roots
instead of trying to make it go away in this fas
hion."
An already approved NCAA rule scheduled to
take effect in 1986, though still failing to ex
tirpate the underlying problem, offers a better
plan than across-the-board freshman ineligibility.
The rule requires all freshmen to have earned a
2.0 high school grade-point average, to have
completed 11 specific core courses in high school
and to have scored at least a combined 700 on the
Scholastic Aptitude Test in order to compete on
the varsity football or basketball team. These
laudable regulations will keep the freshmen who
cannot balance academics and athletics out of the
lockerroom and in the library, while allowing
those who can achieve that balance to do so.
