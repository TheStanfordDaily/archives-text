# Civil rights ironies

### 
It is ironic that if the civil rights movement is to
continue to break down barriers, build bridges
and work toward the America Martin Luther
King Jr. dreamed of, it will have to do so despite the
efforts of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission. It is
even more ironic that King's birthday was finally
recognized as a national holiday during the ten
ure of the Reagan administration
Under the Reagan administration, the Civil
Rights Commission has become a hindrance
rather than a help in furthering the ideals which it
was created to promote. As a result, relations be
tween civil rights leaders and the administra
tion have deteriorated. A new low point was
reached last week when black civil rights leaders
walked out on the commission's hearings on af
firmative action in employment.
In part, the walkout was a response to the
outlandish comments made by Clarence
Pendleton, the commission's chairman.
Pendleton accused contemporary black leaders of
being "immoral" and said they are promoting "a
new racism." Equally disturbing were his intima
tions that civil rights is a dead issue. But regard
less of the administration's claims to the
contrary, civil rights is not a dead issue. At a time
when unemployment among blacks approaches

14 percent and Reagan's proposed budget cuts
threaten the position of minorities even more,
civil rights loom as an issue of ever greater im
portance in American politics.
Morris Abram, the vice chairman of the Civil
Rights Commission, said the boycott by civil
rights groups of his commission's hearings
represented "a historic division point" and "a sad
manifestation of the state of a once glorious
movement." The integrity of the movement itself
has not diminished. What is sad is the historical
insensitivity of Pendleton and the Reagan admin
istration. The policy implications of the adminis
tration's distorted views on civil rights are that
certain remedies for discrimination, like goals,
timetables and quotas, are to be abandoned.
As we mark the 20th anniversary of the his
toric civil rights march from Selma to
Montgomery, Ala., it seems an appropriate time
to reflect on the state of civil rights in America. A
statement issued by the National Urban League,
the NAACP, the National Organization for
Women and other groups says that recent events
make it evident "that a majority of the Civil
Rights Commission has become a public advocate
against the remedies for discrimination." This
should be cause for concern for all of us.
