# Goodbye, GPB
## 
### 
The ASSU Senate's decision last week to elim
inate the Guest Professorship Bureau (GPB)
merits applause.
We commend the ASSU for relinquishing the
responsibility of attracting qualified guest profes
sors. funding them and organizing everything
from departmental approval of their courses to
their housing arrangements. Due in part to the
complexity of the task and the limitations of stu
dent organizations, the GPB has brought only
two guest professors here since its 1982 reorgani
zation.
But we hope this praise for the

death of the GPB will not become a eulogy for
having guest professors at the University.
Now the responsibility for bringing guest pro
fessors lies where it should — with the Univer
sity. Students should still be involved in the
process, but bringing outside experts here to
teach is part of the University's duty to organize a
quality educational program. In addition, the
University should be able to attract more out
standing outsiders than would a group run solely
by students. The University has greater adminis
trative and financial capabilities than the ASSU
and should have more credibility in dealing with
potential professors.
