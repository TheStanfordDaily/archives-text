# Tax policy ended Demo coalition
## 
### 
The right is allowed to set the terms of the economic
debate. In the elections last year, the Republicans were
able to claim the high ground of What Works; the
Democrats were left with the poor second choice of What
Would Be Fair. By letting the choices get set up that way,
Walter Mondale took a sucker bet: Americans will take
prosperity over morality any day.
The limits of discussion are still being defined by the
business end of the political spectrum: Incentives for the
rich will create wealth that trickles down. Cutting big gov
ernment will reduce the deficit. The free market will
produce permanent prosperity.
By acting as if these conservative articles of faith were
Commandments XI, XII and XIII, the opposition can

only play the role of pleading
for "special interests" (like
poor people), against the in
terests of "the average Ameri
can" (who usually turns out to
be Chrysler chairman Lee
lacocca).
The dilemma of the left — if
you can call the Democrats
"the left" with a straight face
— is simple. While the
Republicans are the party of
corporate America, and act

like it, the Democrats want the money of the rich and the
votes of the poor at the same time. Their solution is to
hang on to a vision of America more illusory than Presi
dent Reagan's, where there are no conflicts of interest and
no problems that can't be worked out by discussing them:
The lion lies do\»n with the lamb and the AFL-CIO goes
to bed with General Motors.
In a couple of years' time, when the roller coaster ride
of modern capitalism takes another stomach-churning
drop and the word " Reaganomics" re-enters the lang
uage, people will be receptive, even desperate, for altern
ative ideas. But unless these ideas are worked out in ad
vance, the next crisis will just give the right time to
retrench and perhaps even to take uglier forms.
While the nation is still convinced that 7.5 percent un
employment is a recovery, we have to seize back the issues
that Reagan has expropriated, and redefine them so that
they have an answer that makes sense for the vast
majority of the American people.
One of these issues is taxes. The battle lines have been
drawn — by Reagan — between maintaining our present
awful tax structure or introducing a flat tax, which would
be even worse. Income distribution is now more unequal
than at any time since World War 11. This country doesn't
need a flat tax, it needs a re-progressivized one. putting
the burden of taxes back on those with the most dis
posable income.
There is precedent for this. In the early '60s, the income
tax rate was basically flat for the middle 70 percent of the
income curve, with a marginal rate of 20 to 22 percent. In
today's dollars, this would be the rate for everyone
making less than $50,000 a year. While the poorest fifth
of the population paid no tax, the top 10th paid sharply

progresive rates, ranging from 26 to 91 percent, for
income over $400,000 — almost $2 million in 1985
money.
What happened to this tax code? Nothing — it's the sys
tem we have today, with some minor modifications. The
big change, obviously, was inflation. An income that
would have put you in the top 1 percent then — $24,000
— is now the median. Presidents Johnson and Nixon
decided to finance their adventure in Vietnam through
bracket creep — taxing a worker's salary at a rich person's
rate. When tax relief came, it was brought about by bring
ing the top rate down — not by moving the brackets back
up.
The Democrats went along with this so as not to

alienate their financial back
ers. Instead, they alienated the
salaried working-class
Americans (misleadingly
called the "middle class"),
who felt, rightly, that they
were shouldering too heavy a
tax burden.
The right has capitalized on
. this, with all its talk about big
government and welfare
cheats. (Never mind that 90
percent of the budget is Social

' ,
Security, the military and interest.) The issue of taxes has
been successfully manipulated to begin a major
redistribution of income from the poor to the rich.
The working class, once broadly supportive-of social
programs, has become hostile to the poor and the un
employed. (This dynamic is more fully explored in
Thomas Edsall's "New Politics of Inequality.") Tax
policy, more than any other factor, destroyed the New
Deal coalition and brought people to elect an aging actor
when he rode into town hollering about cutting taxes.
So how to rebuild that coalition?
1. Return to the 1961 tax rates, adjusted for inflation.
2. Index those rates to make them permanent.
3. Put Social Security taxes on the same progressive rate
scale.
4. Make corporations pay something like the 43 percent
rate that they are supposed to pay, rather than the 7 per
cent rate that they actually pay.
These moves — if you could get them through a
Congress brought to you by the U.S. Chamber of Com
merce — would change the rules of the game of American
politics.
The same thing can be done with nearly every issue
facing this country — from the military budget to environ
mental protection. Any successful opposition to
Reaganism needs to adopt the perspective that it is
defending the interests of all the working people — from
the ghetto to white-collar suburbia — against the interests
of business and capital.
Whether the Democratic Party is willing to be that kind
of opposition — this will determine what kind of future
America will have.
