## Provide incentives for campus safety 
### 
(This is on open letter to University President
Donald Kennedy.)
Pursuant to the article "Hazardous duty on the
Farm (Ihe Daily, March 5), lam writing to ask your
assistance in ensuring the physical safety of Stan
ford students, staff and faculty while campus con
struction is in progress. I believe that you are the
best-qualified person to address this issue because
no single University official currently has complete
jurisdiction over safety assurance and, as a result,
the campus environment is more dangerous at
present th,an at any time in the recent past.
I have a strong interest in campus safety because
I was recently injured as a result of unsafe con
struction activities on campus.
On Feb. 15 at 8 a.m., I was riding my bicycle to
campus from my home in Menlo Park. As I turned

VIEWPOINT

from Sam Morris Way toward Terman Engineering
Center, I passed over a patch of loose, dry sand that
had been left by a construction crew on Panama
Street. I skidded and fell from the bike, hitting my
head on the pavement. While I lay on the ground,
several kind bystanders called the emergency
services and I was transported by ambulance to
Stanford Medical Center for X-rays and treatment.
During the ambulance trip and while waiting in
the emergency room, I had a lot of time to think
about what had happened. 1 had ridden my bicycle
to campus from my home dozens of times along the
same route to Terman Engineering Center, but this
time, sand from an abandoned sand pile had drifted
across Panama Street, turning the road bed into a
slick, ice-like surface unsafe for bicyclists.
This was not a case in which greater care on my
part could have prevented the accident. The sand
was "an accident waiting to happen," and 1 was the
unlucky victim who happened to encounter the
waiting hazard.
There are several ironies in my being injured as I
was. The first is that I had spent several days con
tacting campus officials in order to bring construc
tion safety hazards to their attention during fall
quarter. 1 had contacted the campus police, the Of
fice of Health and Safety, the Risk Management
Office and the campus construction coordinator on
at least three different occasions. First, I had ob
served a four-foot deep trench dug in front of Ter
man Engineering Center and left unfilled for
several days with no barricades or markers other
than some yellow "caution" tape strung hap
hazardly around it. As much of a hazard as this was

by day, the absence of any safety flashers made it
even more dangerous at night. Several days after
my complaint, the trench markings were improved
somewhat.
On another occasion, I observed a deep hole in
Santa Teresa Street in front of Bowman Alumni
House. The hole was partially covered by two steel
plates, but a gap about 1.5 inches wide had been
left between the plates, potentially allowing a
bicycle tire to drop into the hole and sending the
rider head first onto the pavement. This hazard was
removed about a week after I reported it to campus
officials.
The recent Daily article reminded me that I am
not the only concerned party who has tried to im
prove the safety of the campus environment. After
speaking with Civil Engineering Prof. Raymond
Levitt, I came away with a sense of frustration be
cause, despite our efforts and those of others at
Stanford, campus safety is not being adequately en
forced.
Moreover, real steps to improve the situation are
still months away, at best. Since September, 1 have
seen and heard of at least half a dozen campus acci
dents related to construction activity: bicycle
crashes due to unmarked debris, people tripping
over unmarked hoses and Cables spread across
streets and slipping on mud generated by concrete
cutting operations. 1 suspect that my accident will
be repeated in a more drastic manner in the future,
perhaps paralyzing or killing a member of the
campus community this year unless safety is im
proved substantially.
1 see three areas where campus safety can be im
proved.
• Marking and covering of construction hazards on
campus must be brought into conformity with stan
dard public works and industrial procedures.
Today, you can travel two miles off campus and
compare the manner in which a trenching opera
tion is carried out on Alameda de las Pulgas to that
in which the SUNet project is being carried out. On
public property, equipment and irregular pavement
are marked with barricades and safety flashers, all
debris is swept up and all trenches are covered or
filled before work ends each day. On-campus
procedures should be similar.
• Reporting of and response to campus safety
hazards must be expedited. Removal of the sand
pile that caused my accident took five days and
some leftover debris was still present in Panama
Street at the beginning of this week. Most staff, fac
ulty and students have no idea who is responsible
for safety hazard abatement. When 1 first called the

campus police department to ask who had jurisdic
tion over public safety hazard investigation, I
learned that the sergeant on duty had no idea
where to refer my call. Even within the campus
offices that deal with construction and safety, juris
diction is not clear and, consequently, our safety
suffers.
• Policing of construction operations must be
carried out by campus representatives. While 1
have heard the argument that construction supervi
sion by University employees may increase the
University's liability, it is clear that some construc
tion workers believe that they are in a free-fire
zone where pedestrians and bicyclists are expected
to fend for themselves. Stanford must either place
its own employees in a position to assure that
public safety is respected, or else Stanford must in
clude contractor-paid safety-enforcement person
nel in contractual agreements.
I would like to conclude with several general
concerns about the campus safety issue. First, I
cannot accept the notion that concerned individuals
like me must be injured in order to create interest
in a safe campus environment. I pay thousands of
dollars each year to study here and I resent the idea
that I must expose myself to unusual risks due to
campus construction while I am here. I am here to
study, but I find instead that I am missing classes
and running up hundreds of dollars in emergency
medical care bills because of an accident caused by
circumstances that I virtually predicted in con
versations with campus officials five months ago.
Second, I believe that new campus facilities and
services such as the SUNet system are of great
value to Stanford and must be installed ex
peditiously. It is reasonable to expect some incon
veniences along the way. It is not reasonable to
expect the inconveniences to include perilous and
potentially life-threatening hazards scattered
around the campus. How could we judge the merit
of the SUNet system if a member of the campus
community were killed as a result of its construc
tion?
Last, I believe that Stanford is well-prepared to
meet the challenge of providing a safe environment
for all of us in the campus community. We have
staff and faculty with the expertise to strengthen
existing safety programs and to design new ones if
needed. I believe that all that we need to produce a
safe environment at Stanford is an incentive from
higher up in the University administration. I hope
that you will provide that incentive.
