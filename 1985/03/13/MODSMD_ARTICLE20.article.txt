## Daily search clarified 
### 
As a former editor of The Daily
who was involved in the litigation fol
lowing the search of The Daily's
offices, I'd like to make a few com
ments concerning the story on Palo
Alto Police Chief James Zurcher
(The Daily, March 1):
• Only Palo Alto police officers
searched The Daily. Two Stanford se
curity guards were present but did not
participate in executing the search
warrant.
• Palo Alto Police Chief James Zur
cher was the first named defendant;
other defendants were the law en
forcement and judicial officers in
volved in issuing and executing the

VIEWPOINT

warrant. When the Supreme Court
accepted the case for review, the
name changed from Stanford Daily v.
Zurcher to Zurcher v. Stanford Daily.
Some legal commentators still refer
to it as the Stanford Daily decision.
• Zurcher's comments concerning his
"alternatives" and consultations are
interesting. Palo Alto argued that
Zurcher should never even have been
sued because he had no prior knowl
edge or involvement with the search.
University News Service Director
Bob Beyers' statements are correct:
He informed Zurcher after the Medi
cal Center riot that only a University
photographer had pictures of the riot.
Zurcher, however, never told this to
his subordinates, and they never told
him of their planned search.
• If police spent so much time con
sulting over the warrant, it should be
asked why the police officers and the
District Attorney's Office (it was not
the Palo Alto City Attorney's Office)
showed up in front of a judge at the
close of court late Monday afternoon,
three days after the riot, urged the
judge to quickly sign the warrant and
then raced to The Daily to begin
searching before sunset — when the
warrant would have become invalid.
• Zurcher argued to the Supreme
Court that California law didn't per

mil his using a subpoena, since sub
poenas could be used only after
charges were filed. In this case, no
suspects had been identified, let alone
arrested. Hence the need to find
photographs that might identify
suspects.
• After The Daily sued Zurcher and
the other defendents, they began to
use The Daily's photo policy as a
defense for their actions. (The policy
was not included in the search war
rant application presented to the
judge who signed the warrant.) The
Daily initiated the photo policy 14
months before the search, after the
Santa Clara County District Attor
ney's Office subpoenaed The Daily's
photo files. While The Daily pub
lished photos "regardless of their po
tential for incrimination" as part of
this same policy, The Daily believed
that journalists shouldn't become
agents of the state or private defense
attorneys.
The Los Angeles Times has a
similar policy. No one has ever
branded the Times as irresponsible or
criminal sympathizers, nor has
anyone searched the offices of the
Times. Indeed, the Los Angeles
County District Attorney didn't even
bother to subpoena the Times follow
ing a 1979 violent demonstration
because of that policy. But then, the
Los Angeles Times isn't run by col
lege students.
• Sgt. Nick Bruno is now with the
Santa Clara County Sheriff s Patrol at
Stanford; he was a University em
ployee at the time he photographed
student demonstrations.
• Following the Supreme Court's
1978 decision in Stanford Daily,
some 51 searches and possibly as
many as 75 have occurred nationwide
against people who either weren't
suspected of crime or who held con
fidential information from non
suspects. Some seven news media
organizations were targets; the rest
were lawyers, physicians, psyc
hiatrists, psychologists and hospitals.
