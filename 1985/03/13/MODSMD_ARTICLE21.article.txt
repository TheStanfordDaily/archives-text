## I pledge $100 to create a Stanford student museum 
### 
Todd Kerr is my hero. So are Lorissa,
Brandi, Bill, Wade and yes, even "the Sip."
They are probably heroes of yours, too, if
you had the good fortune to stroll Thursday
through the Branner Hall Lounge to see the
Stanford T-Shirt Museum.

VIEWPOINT

On display were 300 student-designed T
shirts, mostly from the past five years; just the
tip of the iceberg of decades of student ex
pression and creativity at this university.
While Kerr and his fellow Brannerites
showed their dedication to celebrating stu
dent life and achievement by displaying a vast
collection of student work, the shirts that
hung in the Branner Lounge told a small part
of the story of the tens of thousands of student
heroes who have contributed their talents to
this great place we call Stanford.

Bob Honeycutt is a hero in this story, too.
He is the founder of the first Stanford under
graduate historical society and an articulate
spokesperson for a student role in the ex
amination and display of student history as
the University celebrates its centennial.
There are others who have contributed,
too, to the growing list of ideas for celebrating
student achievement, displaying student tal
ents and recognizing how Stanford alumni
have inspired generations of students who
have followed them in shaping this university
into the place it is today.
Calls have come from all corners — for
news of great student pranks in the Stanford
Observer, for protection and preservation of
student wall murals, for plaques to com
memorate famous alumni and for outdoor
pedestals to display student sculpture.
Not only students and alumni have contrib
uted to this cause.

Kennell Jackson, a professor of history, is
building his own collection of student
mementos and is painstakingly documenting
aspects of student life in the residences. He
has displayed interesting fragments of student
residential life and has sought to institution
alize special qualities of student life within the
residences.
Roxanne Nilan, University archivist, has
taken initiative as well, building a vast collec
tion of student documents and artifacts in the
crowded storage rooms of the University Ar
chives.
It is clear that Stanford is ready for the next
step, a bold and exciting move; creation of a
student museum, the first of its kind
anywhere, to be operated and financed jointly
by alumni and students, with advice from the
archives and the historical society.
This will be a museum unlike any other on

campus. This will be a museum with perman
ent exhibits of model student rooms from the
1890s, the 19205, the '40s, the '60s and the
'80s. It will be a museum with exhibits of
memorabilia from the student days of famous
alumni, adding to the one display which the
University currently has for Herbert Hoover,
'95.
This will be a museum which will exhibit
student T-shirts, class doodles, student inven
tions, student posters and student artwork. It
will provide models of student pranks, dis
plays of materials placed in time capsules (to
be opened beginning in 1990) and
photographs of student wall murals.
It will bring an increased sense of pride and
inspiration to this university's students and
alumni. It will be a place where old ideas can
be examined anew. It will be another feather
in the plume of this university.

In the meantime, plans are already under
way for a University-wide display of model
student rooms from various areas. Welcoming
student and alumni support, Roxanne Nilan is
already searching for extra rooms (even tem
porarily available storage closets) in several of
Stanford's current and former student
residences — Encina Hall, Branner, Roble
and the co-ops and fraternities — and for old
University furniture and alumni artifacts, for
creation of a University-wide, week-long dis
play, late this spring or next fall, with one his
torical room in each of several campus
residences.
A permanent Stanford student museum
cannot be far off.
I pledge $100 of my own if the University
will help organize and proceed with this
worthwhile effort.

creation of a University-wide, week-long dis
play, late this spring or next fall, with one his
torical room in each of several campus
residences.
A permanent Stanford student museum
cannot be far off.
I pledge $100 of my own if the University
will help organize and proceed with this
worthwhile effort.
