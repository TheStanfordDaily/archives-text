Kenneth Fenyo's viewpoint, "In
support of the 'freedom fighters' "
(The Daily, March 4), displayed the
usual depressing Reagan propaganda
line on the subject of the Nicaraguan
revolution and current Sandinista
government. Our president is ig
norant of Nicaraguan history and of
the achievements gained in that
country through the efforts of a state
apparatus dedicated to far-reaching
social reforms in agricultural policy,
the elimination of illiteracy and,
most important, health care for all
Nicaraguans.
I would recommend to Fenyo that
he make the effort, when it next
comes to the area, to see the film
"Missing." I was fortunate to see this
movie a second time last weekend.
The locale, of course, is Santiago,
Chile, the year 1973, the subject the
destruction of another earlier Latin
American revolution by another set
of "freedom fighters" supported by
the United States.
The film is profoundly moving
because of the extraordinary and
brilliant characterization of Ed Hor
man by Jack Lemmon. Again, I felt
close to tears watching Ed Horman
plead with the American officials for
news of his missing son. Horman, a
deeply religious man, underwent a
sort of conversion as he doggedly
pursued any clue, any trace of
evidence that might reveal his son's
fate.
What was most horrifying to me
was not so much the savage anarchy
of a great city under seige by Pino
chet's fascist troops, but more one's
realization that the* American ambas
sador and all his staff knew of
Charlie's death, three days after his
arrest on Sept. 16, but continued to
pretend to Charlie's dad that the boy
might still be alive. The suffering of
the father and the grief of Beth, his
daughter-in-law. played beautifully
by Sissy Spacek. generated the really
tremendous emotional and dramatic
force of the movie. As one of my
friends in the audience put it. "One
/eels so angry "

Yes, one is angry, and the fatuous
ignorance and complacent incom
prehension of a comfortable Ameri
can 18-year-old can make me angry,
too, but I reserve the full force of my
fury for those who really deserve
removal from office for their lying,
their hypocrisy, their destruction of
something really beautiful appearing
in a small, weak country, a country
which has decided it will try
genuinely to help the poor and which
must now waste its precious re
sources in its struggle to expel las
bestias: "the beasts," the contras.

I am writing in response to Melissa
Fischer's letter concerning the nude
pin-up in Physics 51.1 was disturbed
to hear of the male reaction to her
protests: laughing and jeering. Those
same men who laughed at the pin-up
were probably "outraged" by Noel
Hanrahan's viewpoint (The Daily,
Jan. 14) in which she made no dis
tinction between good men and
rapists. As I read about the pin-up
and the reaction it evoked, I won
dered how many similar incidents
Hanrahan must have experienced to
cause her to become so embittered
toward men.
You men who refuse her classifica
tion of rapist should look at the
attitudes of so many of your broth
ers. No. you don't have to look at
truck stops or the Tenderloin. These
crude, insensitive men are right here
at Stanford — it's the guy who sits
next to you in physics.
And to the men who ridiculed
Melissa: What were you thinking?
"Big deal. It's just a naked woman.
These feminists are so extreme."
Wrong. It is a big deal — to half the
human race. Can't you understand
the anger and the humiliation and
the frustration that women face
every day because we can't go jog
ging at night, or walk home from the
library alone, or protest the exploita
tion of women without being sneered
at?

If you can't understand how we
feel, at least have some respect for
the feelings of a fellow human being.

Hurrah for Bill Evers' column
(The Daily, March 4) on reducing
the scope of U.S. military efforts.
Besides reducing the bloated military
budget, restricting the use of U.S.
troops to our shores would have
several advantages.
First, the politicians and the
generals would have no more oppor
tunity to squander American lives
and money fighting for "freedom" in
places like Vietnam, Lebanon and
Central America.
Second, we would no longer be
tricked into confusing national secur
ity with multi-national (corporate)
security. Let's face it: Big business
has a lot of power in political deci
sions and will not hesitate to send
18-year-old draftees (slaves) to
godforsaken jungles to fight for its
profits.
Remember "Hell no, we won't go,
we won't fight for Texaco?" And did
you know that J.P. Morgan spent a
lot of time persuading President
Wilson to enter World War I? I
don't think he was interested in
"keeping the world safe for
democracy," but rather in protecting
the billions of dollars in outstanding
loans to Britain that he would have
lost had the Germans won.
If a corporation wants to do busi
ness outside the United States to
take advantage of lower wages and
fewer regulations, it should not be
able to count on the support of the
U.S. military when it meets the
disadvantages of political unrest that
plague the unstable societies in
which multinationals seek their
profits.
Let's keep the United States
militarily neutral in international
events. Let's stop making the
average American taxpayer pay
more for the defense of West Ger
many and Japan than the average

taxpayers of those countries do. Let's
adopt a policy of free trade with all
and political entanglements with
none that will best protect American
lives and security.
We don't think the United States
has ever warred with a country with
which it had open trading relations.
Let's keep the military from being a
tool of the paranoids, the politicians
and the international profit-mongers
and save it for its proper function of
defending our shores from aggres
sion.

I'd like to respond to Jason Math
erly's column "Put the senate on the
ballot" (The Daily, March 5) be
cause, as usual, he has chosen exactly
one set of facts to present and com
pletely ignored all the others.
What is he suggesting about the
senate? That it does nothing?
This year the senate gave out
$660,000 — that's two-thirds of a
million dollars — to more than 100
student groups on campus. Students
voted to have us collect that money
from them and we paid it out to
those organizations to get things
done on campus. Probably half the
activities advertised around campus
are paid for in some way by the
senate.
Would it happen just as easily
without the senate?
What if there were no one to
control where that two-thirds of a
million dollars went? We go through
a line-by-line check of every budget
of every group that comes to us for
money. We leave in only those things
that benefit as many students as
possible. If we left in everything,
we'd have to tax students $2 million
or $3 million.
Would Matherly prefer that we
just ladle out money? Is that what
his "committee of five concerned
students meeting once a month''

would do? I guarantee that's all
they'd have time to do.
Why do we need to give any or
ganization any money? I don't know
about Matherly, but I came to Stan
ford for the diversity of opportunities
— the different things happening all
the time. That's what the senate
funds.
There's nothing wrong with telling
people to abolish the senate as long
as you come out with the truth to
them about what they would lose.
Until Matherly comes up with an
alternate system where groups could
get the money they need, he's doing
the same thing all the senators who
resigned did: He's complaining
loudly and offering no solution.
It's interesting that Matherly chose
for his prime witness former senator
Jay Alter, who simply wasn't willing
to do the work it took to accomplish
his goals. Alter's most memorable
contributions to the senate this year
were: 1) trying to remove people
from the senate who knew more
about it than he did; 2) asking if he
could chair the meeting when he
mistakenly felt that Eric Berg's
authority might be slipping; and 3)
wasting 30 minutes of the senate's
time moving his favorite business to
the front of the agenda. When it was
completed, he quit and walked out.
I'd like to remind the people of
Stanford that there is still a full
voting complement of senators who
are working hard. If you're ever
unsure of what we do or are un
satisfied with us, come in and talk to
us. We know there are problems.
And the people who are willing to do
more than complain will be the
people who help solve them.

James Sherman does less than
justice to the people and government
of New Zealand (The Daily, March
8). For more than 30 years the
ANZUS treaty has been the linchpin

of New Zealand (and Australian)
foreign policy, a foreign policy
largely based upon faith. As Sher
man will be aware, the treaty does
not commit the United States to
bring its military power to the assis
tance of either country in a crisis.
However, we have regarded ANZUS
as an insurance policy and paid our
dues by fighting and dying in your
Asian wars. And for many years, we
have allowed important U.S. com
munications bases in Australia and
port facilities in New Zealand for
nuclear-armed warships — even
though such actions make us certain
Soviet targets — because, on bal
ance, we believed that a strong
United States deterred the Soviet
Union from initiating a war.
However, in rccent years many
academics, politicians and ser
v;cemcn have come to feel that New
Zealand security is no longer best
served by a total reliance on such a
vague declaration of U.S. good in
tentions as given in the ANZUS
treaty. Even before Prime Minister
David Lange was elected last year,
there was a great deal of agitation
for a renegotiation of ANZUS
which would indicate a much greater
commitment by the United States. If
such a redrafting of ANZUS was not
possible — and indeed, as New
Zealand has always been fairly irrel
evant as far as the United States is
concerned, this didn't seem very
likely — radical new approaches
gained acceptance.
Sherman's suggestion — that the
United States wait and see — is one
with which I totally agree. However,
I fear that the temptation to bully a
small country will prove too strong.
But if New Zealand is threatened in
such a way by the United States, the
voices in Australia calling for a
nuclear free zone will be
strengthened, the demands for the
removal of vital bases will bccomc
irresistible and your troubles will be
much greater.

James Sherman does less than
justice to the people and government
of New Zealand (The Daily, March
8). For more than 30 years the
ANZUS treaty has been the linchpin

of New Zealand (and Australian)
foreign policy, a foreign policy
largely based upon faith. As Sher
man will be aware, the treaty does
not commit the United States to
bring its military power to the assis
tance of either country in a crisis.
However, we have regarded ANZUS
as an insurance policy and paid our
dues by fighting and dying in your
Asian wars. And for many years, we
have allowed important U.S. com
munications bases in Australia and
port facilities in New Zealand for
nuclear-armed warships — even
though such actions make us certain
Soviet targets — because, on bal
ance, we believed that a strong
United States deterred the Soviet
Union from initiating a war.
However, in rccent years many
academics, politicians and ser
v;cemcn have come to feel that New
Zealand security is no longer best
served by a total reliance on such a
vague declaration of U.S. good in
tentions as given in the ANZUS
treaty. Even before Prime Minister
David Lange was elected last year,
there was a great deal of agitation
for a renegotiation of ANZUS
which would indicate a much greater
commitment by the United States. If
such a redrafting of ANZUS was not
possible — and indeed, as New
Zealand has always been fairly irrel
evant as far as the United States is
concerned, this didn't seem very
likely — radical new approaches
gained acceptance.
Sherman's suggestion — that the
United States wait and see — is one
with which I totally agree. However,
I fear that the temptation to bully a
small country will prove too strong.
But if New Zealand is threatened in
such a way by the United States, the
voices in Australia calling for a
nuclear free zone will be
strengthened, the demands for the
removal of vital bases will bccomc
irresistible and your troubles will be

Hurrah for Bill Evers' column
(The Daily, March 4) on reducing

Besides reducing the bloated military

several advantages.
First, the politicians and the

and money fighting for "freedom" in
places like Vietnam, Lebanon and
Central America.
Second, we would no longer be
tricked into confusing national secur

security. Let's face it: Big business
has a lot of power in political deci
sions and will not hesitate to send
18-year-old draftees (slaves) to
godforsaken jungles to fight for its
profits.
Remember "Hell no, we won't go,
we won't fight for Texaco?" And did
you know that J.P. Morgan spent a
lot of time persuading President
Wilson to enter World War I? I
don't think he was interested in
"keeping the world safe for
democracy," but rather in protecting
the billions of dollars in outstanding
loans to Britain that he would have
lost had the Germans won.
If a corporation wants to do busi

take advantage of lower wages and
fewer regulations, it should not be
able to count on the support of the
U.S. military when it meets the
disadvantages of political unrest that
plague the unstable societies in

Let's keep the United States
militarily neutral in international

average American taxpayer pay
more for the defense of West Ger
many and Japan than the average

taxpayers of those countries do. Let's
adopt a policy of free trade with all
and political entanglements with
none that will best protect American
lives and security.
We don't think the United States
has ever warred with a country with
which it had open trading relations.
Let's keep the military from being a

I'd like to respond to Jason Math
erly's column "Put the senate on the
ballot" (The Daily, March 5) be
cause, as usual, he has chosen exactly
one set of facts to present and com
pletely ignored all the others.
What is he suggesting about the
senate? That it does nothing?
This year the senate gave out
$660,000 — that's two-thirds of a
million dollars — to more than 100
student groups on campus. Students
voted to have us collect that money
from them and we paid it out to
those organizations to get things
done on campus. Probably half the
activities advertised around campus
are paid for in some way by the
senate.
Would it happen just as easily
without the senate?
What if there were no one to
control where that two-thirds of a
million dollars went? We go through
a line-by-line check of every budget
of every group that comes to us for
money. We leave in only those things
that benefit as many students as
possible. If we left in everything,
we'd have to tax students $2 million
or $3 million.
Would Matherly prefer that we
just ladle out money? Is that what
his "committee of five concerned
students meeting once a month''

would do? I guarantee that's all
they'd have time to do.
Why do we need to give any or
ganization any money? I don't know
about Matherly, but I came to Stan
ford for the diversity of opportunities
— the different things happening all
the time. That's what the senate
funds.
There's nothing wrong with telling
people to abolish the senate as long
as you come out with the truth to
them about what they would lose.
Until Matherly comes up with an
alternate system where groups could
get the money they need, he's doing

I'd like to respond to Jason Math
erly's column "Put the senate on the
ballot" (The Daily, March 5) be
cause, as usual, he has chosen exactly
one set of facts to present and com
pletely ignored all the others.
What is he suggesting about the
senate? That it does nothing?
This year the senate gave out
$660,000 — that's two-thirds of a
million dollars — to more than 100
student groups on campus. Students
voted to have us collect that money
from them and we paid it out to
those organizations to get things
done on campus. Probably half the
activities advertised around campus
are paid for in some way by the
senate.
Would it happen just as easily
without the senate?
What if there were no one to
control where that two-thirds of a
million dollars went? We go through
a line-by-line check of every budget
of every group that comes to us for
money. We leave in only those things
that benefit as many students as
possible. If we left in everything,
we'd have to tax students $2 million
or $3 million.
Would Matherly prefer that we
just ladle out money? Is that what
his "committee of five concerned
students meeting once a month''

would do? I guarantee that's all
they'd have time to do.
Why do we need to give any or
ganization any money? I don't know
about Matherly, but I came to Stan
ford for the diversity of opportunities
— the different things happening all
the time. That's what the senate
funds.
There's nothing wrong with telling
people to abolish the senate as long
as you come out with the truth to
them about what they would lose.
Until Matherly comes up with an
alternate system where groups could
get the money they need, he's doing
the same thing all the senators who
resigned did: He's complaining
loudly and offering no solution.
It's interesting that Matherly chose
for his prime witness former senator
Jay Alter, who simply wasn't willing
to do the work it took to accomplish
his goals. Alter's most memorable
contributions to the senate this year
were: 1) trying to remove people
from the senate who knew more
about it than he did; 2) asking if he
could chair the meeting when he
mistakenly felt that Eric Berg's
authority might be slipping; and 3)
wasting 30 minutes of the senate's
time moving his favorite business to
the front of the agenda. When it was
completed, he quit and walked out.
I'd like to remind the people of
Stanford that there is still a full
voting complement of senators who
are working hard. If you're ever
unsure of what we do or are un
satisfied with us, come in and talk to
us. We know there are problems.
And the people who are willing to do
more than complain will be the

James Sherman does less than
justice to the people and government
of New Zealand (The Daily, March
8). For more than 30 years the
ANZUS treaty has been the linchpin

of New Zealand (and Australian)
foreign policy, a foreign policy
largely based upon faith. As Sher
man will be aware, the treaty does
not commit the United States to
bring its military power to the assis
tance of either country in a crisis.
However, we have regarded ANZUS
as an insurance policy and paid our
dues by fighting and dying in your
Asian wars. And for many years, we
have allowed important U.S. com
munications bases in Australia and
port facilities in New Zealand for
nuclear-armed warships — even
though such actions make us certain
Soviet targets — because, on bal
ance, we believed that a strong
United States deterred the Soviet
Union from initiating a war.
However, in rccent years many
academics, politicians and ser
v;cemcn have come to feel that New
Zealand security is no longer best
served by a total reliance on such a
vague declaration of U.S. good in
tentions as given in the ANZUS
treaty. Even before Prime Minister
David Lange was elected last year,
there was a great deal of agitation
for a renegotiation of ANZUS
which would indicate a much greater
commitment by the United States. If
such a redrafting of ANZUS was not
possible — and indeed, as New
Zealand has always been fairly irrel
evant as far as the United States is
concerned, this didn't seem very
likely — radical new approaches
gained acceptance.
Sherman's suggestion — that the
United States wait and see — is one
with which I totally agree. However,
I fear that the temptation to bully a
small country will prove too strong.
But if New Zealand is threatened in
such a way by the United States, the
voices in Australia calling for a
nuclear free zone will be
strengthened, the demands for the
removal of vital bases will bccomc
irresistible and your troubles will be

Kenneth Fenyo's viewpoint, "In
support of the 'freedom fighters' "
(The Daily, March 4), displayed the
usual depressing Reagan propaganda
line on the subject of the Nicaraguan
revolution and current Sandinista
government. Our president is ig
norant of Nicaraguan history and of
the achievements gained in that
country through the efforts of a state
apparatus dedicated to far-reaching
social reforms in agricultural policy,
the elimination of illiteracy and,
most important, health care for all
Nicaraguans.
I would recommend to Fenyo that
he make the effort, when it next
comes to the area, to see the film
"Missing." I was fortunate to see this
movie a second time last weekend.
The locale, of course, is Santiago,
Chile, the year 1973, the subject the
destruction of another earlier Latin
American revolution by another set
of "freedom fighters" supported by
the United States.
The film is profoundly moving
because of the extraordinary and
brilliant characterization of Ed Hor
man by Jack Lemmon. Again, I felt
close to tears watching Ed Horman
plead with the American officials for
news of his missing son. Horman, a
deeply religious man, underwent a
sort of conversion as he doggedly
pursued any clue, any trace of
evidence that might reveal his son's
fate.
What was most horrifying to me
was not so much the savage anarchy
of a great city under seige by Pino
chet's fascist troops, but more one's
realization that the* American ambas
sador and all his staff knew of
Charlie's death, three days after his
arrest on Sept. 16, but continued to
pretend to Charlie's dad that the boy
might still be alive. The suffering of
the father and the grief of Beth, his
daughter-in-law. played beautifully
by Sissy Spacek. generated the really
tremendous emotional and dramatic
force of the movie. As one of my
friends in the audience put it. "One
/eels so angry "

Yes, one is angry, and the fatuous
ignorance and complacent incom
prehension of a comfortable Ameri
can 18-year-old can make me angry,
too, but I reserve the full force of my
fury for those who really deserve
removal from office for their lying,
their hypocrisy, their destruction of
something really beautiful appearing
in a small, weak country, a country
which has decided it will try
genuinely to help the poor and which
must now waste its precious re
sources in its struggle to expel las
bestias: "the beasts," the contras.

Wrong. It is a big deal — to half the
