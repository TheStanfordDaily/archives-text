## Feminism here emphasizes academic inquiry 
### BARBARA SCHULER Staff writer 
"Some feminists at Stanford are
thriving. I wouldn't exactly say
feminism is thriving," says Patricia
Brandt Polhemus, director of Escon
dido Village and assistant dean of
Student Affairs, as she looks at the
aftermath of an era. For some
women, like Polhemus, who spent
their 20s in the '70s, the current low
tide of the women's movement stands
in stark contrast to the flood of
excitement and energy that marked
the movement's early years.
Left with the legacy of a radical so
cial movement, many undergraduate
feminists today feel frustrated by the
1980s "reaction" against the 1970s
feminist. Out of touch with their
forebears, they cannot escape assoca
tion with the image of these "radical
feminists" in the popular imagina
tion.
Although many campus women's
organizations face these stereotypes,
not all have found their goals as lim
ited by them as has the Stanford
Women's Center.
The locus of much of the radical ac
tivism that colors perceptions of
today's campus feminists, the
women's center is now trying to par
tially dissociate itself from that past.
According to Jennifer Watson of the
women's center collective, it is a
"frustrating" task.
"We're really trying so hard to
make the women's center a place for
all women, and to make that part of
our feminism. It's really hard for
people not to be noticing that we're
making this effort. And still I'm

hearing, 'The women's center is just
that bunch of lesbian-feminists. ... I
can't be there because they're differ
ent from me.' "
Feminist union
Viewed variously as "militant,"
"man-hating," "unfeminine,"
"lesbian" or "women who don't
shave their legs and don't wear make
up," members of the women's center
collective have over the past year
made attempts to broaden their base
of support within the campus main
stream and to alter a reputation that
they see as undeserved and inac
curate.
The charge "lesbian," which Wat
son says is still, "like 'feminist,' a

dirty word," has been met by the
women's center with great sensitivity,
according to Noel Hanrahan, mem
ber of the Women's Collective of the
Gay and Lesbian Alliance at Stanford
(GLAS).
"We're all conversant about the
issue of lesbianism in our community
and there is no fear that anyone will
be blamed for being gay because we
(the women's community) don't hold
that as a negative," she explains. "I
realize that it does create a problem
in marketing the women's center,
however." To counter some of its
image problems, the women's center
last fall spun off a separate organiza
tion — the Stanford Feminist Union
— to represent feminist concerns and
organize politically inspired program
ming, thus stripping the women's cen
ter of any explicit political affiliation
with the feminist movement.
The move acknowledges a "tension
between the desire to make some
statements and get some things said
and, on the other hand, not wanting
to misrepresent the population of
Stanford women in general," says
Francesca Flynn, one of the founding
members of the union.
According to Watson, there is a
"difference in spirit" between the two
organizations. The feminist union has
funneled some of the more "radical
energy" away from the women's cen
ter, which can now function unham
pered as a service organization, she
said.
In addition to this structural
change, the women's center has also
been negotiating with Dean of Stu
dent Affairs James Lyons to get Uni-

versity support and funding for a full
time staff person to maintain regular
hours at the center and to handle ad
ministrative and office work.
Currently staffed by student volun
teers, the center consumes a lot of en
ergy from a few women merely to
stay open. "You don't realize how
much time it takes ... to do behind
thc-scencs administrative stuff that
has nothing to do with programming
but just keeps the center alive and
going," says Watson. The reliance on
volunteers likewise affects the com
position of the center because people
with a real commitment to women's
community will more likely serve as
staff members. That sets a tone which
may make some women uncomfort
able, according to Flynn.

She acknowledges, "Everyone's
time is limited so ... it (often) turns
out that the people who get involved
in the women's center are really in
terested in women's issues. More of
ten than not, they tend to be
feminists. That puts a feminist slant in
participation."
No endorsement
Of recent defeats suffered by the
women's community, the loss of the
women's center fee assessment al
location last spring looms largest.
Having requested $10,800 to cover
programming, newsletters and ad
ministrative functions, the women's
center received one of three "Vote
no" recommendations by The Daily
Editorial Board.
Many members of the center
believe The Daily's recommendation
determined the outcome of the elec
tion. "I'd like to know how 10 white
men can decide whether the women's
center does or doesn't provide a ser
vice of value to the women's commu
nity," said one woman involved with
the center.
According to Flynn, "Part of the
momentum for the split between the
women's center and the feminist
union was sort of a rebound from the
fee assessment being voted down last
spring." The 'conciliatory move ap
pears to have gained support from
Lyons and other University adminis
trators, but it hasn't yet substantially
broadened participation at the center.
A look at the current composition
of the women's center collective and
those who use the facility makes the

minimal representation of minorities
and the lack of interaction with
sorority women very clear.
While this is something collective
members would like to see change,
neither of these groups has been very
responsive to their overtures. Ac
cording to Inter-Sorority Council
President Laura Nelson, the
sororities are "pretty self-sufficient"
and "don't really need to use the
women's center."
Nelson does say, however, that she
"would love to see more politically
inclined, more feminist-inclined
women go through rush this year.
They could make a real difference in
the direction sororities are going to
take in the next couple of years."

Feminism and racism
Currently boasting about 400
members, "Sororities have the poten
tial of being a very powerful force in
promoting women's issues," accord
ing to Nelson.
Polhemus acknowledges that al
though there is some concern about
racial mixes in the sororities and their
methods of selection, they provide
many women the chance to challenge
traditional roles. "You see women
taking leadership, wanting to be in
control of their own organiza
tions. . . . They're starting something,
questioning authority in a certain way
— you know they weren't very
welcome here when they first started,
by any means. 'Push, push, let's see
what happens.' Well, that's good."
Several women active in the black
and Chicana communities explain
their absence from the women's cen
ter's ranks by saying their racial
agendas currently supercede feminist
activism.
Rachel Bagby, program coordina
tor of Afro-American Studies, says
that feminism has been seen as pe
ripheral to the movement for black
liberation. "In the community, his
torically, the feminist question has
been seen as a divisive sort of thing.
Like, 'We'll deal with that as soon as
we get some basic needs taken care
of, like education and food and
housing and voting rights:' 1 see that
reflected here at Stanford, too.
"Personally, it's important to me as
a woman to identify with other
women in a way that transcends racial
lines. I think there are things we share
as women that if we could join to
gether would strengthen us all. 1 also
know that there are value conflicts,
there is racism, and memories of that
on both sides sometimes make it diffi
cult," Bagby says.
Cecilia Burciaga, associate dean for
Graduate Studies and Research, says
she used to be troubled by "the insis
tence (of white women) that it was
worse to be a woman than it was to be
a minority, 'isn't it, you guys?' As if
we could separate the two." Unless
the feminist movement makes a real
commitment against racism, it will be
very difficult for minority women to
see what's in it for them, Burciaga
says.
Rape education
Raising the dual issues of racism
and sexism, and addressing connec
tions between them, has been a major
focus of Stanford's Residential Edu
cation program over the past decade,
says Polhemus.
Strongly supported by Res Ed, the
work of the Rape Education Project
(REP) in facilitating dorm talks, or
ganizing Rape Awareness Week each
fall and presenting the REP
produced tapes, "Speaking of Sex,"
and the film "Working Against
Rape" encourages awareness and dis
cussion of these concerns. Polhemus
explains, "There are a lot of racist at
titudes about rape. And everybody's
against rape, men and women. The
most conservative man on campus is
against rape, so you have a point of
allegiance."
According to Pilar Ossorio, an
REP facilitator who has worked with
the project for nearly three years, this
allegiance is crucial to the success of
REP. "One of the premises of REP is
that rape is not just a woman's prob
lem. And since men are doing the
raping, it's very much men's responsi
bility to start exploring the social
forces going into making ours the
kind of society where rape is an
epidemic."
Ossorio says REP — whose active
membership is about half women and
half men — is not seen as "a strongly

feminist organization," but she ad
mits that the group's analysis of rape
is more consistent with feminist
politics than many students who en
dorse REP may realize.
"A lot of people who will support
us haven't really gotten to where we
are. They've gotten as far as rape is
bad, but they don't recognize it as a
political issue . . . or as part of a much
broader spectrum of social be
haviors," she says.
REP has not been alone in working
to increase awareness of issues relat
ing to communication between men
and women, coercion in relationships
and violence against women.
No joke
A more recent development, the
SWOPSI course, "Issues in Self-
Defense for Women," has begun to
gain a real hold in the women's com
munity. Offered once each quarter
since the spring of 1982, its
popularity has spread, mostly through
word-of-mouth recommendations,
says Pam Maes, one of the course's
instructors. As a result, two sections
of the class are being offered both this
quarter and next.
Maes describes the evolution that
occurs in the course over the length of
the quarter. "It essentially teaches
women to defend themselves, but so
much else is going on. . . . It's a
process of each woman rediscovering
her own power, discovering her voice
and being able to take control. The
women begin to see themselves as
being valid in what they think and

how they feel and who they are."
Assoc. History Prof. Estelle Freed
rnan gives these groups a lot of credit
for increasing campus sensitivity to
the issue of rape. She recalls the con
trast of her early years at Stanford:
"When I first came here, rape was a
joke. 1 remember, the only time I've
ever written a letter to The Daily in
my life was around 1977 because they
ran this cartoon about women wan
ting rape. ... I mean, people hardly
responded.
"Rape was still a joke. It was
legitimate to joke about. And over
the years, the level of consciousness
among both men and women — I
know there is a huge exception to
this, and I know there is still that
group within which it is still a joke —
but compared to when I came here,
the level of consciousness has really
changed."
Pace too slow
Alice Supton, assistant dean of Res
Ed, acknowledges that progress has
been made, but her tone belies dis
couragement with the pace of change.
"In terms of campus awareness and
dorm environment as a whole, I think
that some people are quite aware and
some people are clueless. For the
sake of the health of the women and
the sake of the health of the men, I
think it's important that more people
be concerned about genuine, true
equal opportunity for women and
genuine valuing of women as individ-


'I've learned very
painfully that the
administration is a
litle uncomfort
able with political
activism. They're
all for political in
quiry. .. . It's very
important that
women get in
volved in that sort
of structured in
quiry.'

'Many scholars must now learn how to
listen to and be conversant in feminist
criticism. It has become one of the
basic ways of looking at literature and
symbol systems.'
