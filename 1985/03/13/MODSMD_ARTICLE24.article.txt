Dear Bug Me,
Who the hell are Vicki and Thomas
and why will he hate her forever if she
doesn't call him in Denver? - Mark
Carmichael
1 called Thomas in Denver, just
like a lot of other Stanford students
who had nothing better to do when
they read his quarter-page ads in The
Daily a few weeks ago, and he doesn't
want you to know who he is.
"It's very embarrassing," he said.
People at work have been kidding
him about all the strange calls he's
gotten, and he doesn't want it to af
fect his job any more.
1 would have called Vicki for you,
but he doesn't know her last name.
That's why he ran the ad.
They met when he flew out to ski at
Squaw Valley one weekend. They
spent the whole day on the slopes to
gether, and she was going to write
down her address and phone number
for him, but he didn't have any pock
ets to hold a piece of paper in.
"She was funny and nice and
charming and 1 kick myself in the
head now for not getting her phone
number," said the 30-year-old during
the phone interview.
All he knows is that she's a pre

med at Stanford and she lives in Mill
brae. He hoped she would respond
to the ad so he could fly out and have
dinner in San Francisco with her,
probably at Ondine's.
"I use pianes like other people use
cars," he said to explain that he

doesn't want to marry her, just "get
to see if we could get together for din
ner one night."
He's already spent $1,278 on five
days' worth of eye-catching ads and
says,"I would like to find her again,
but on the other hand, she hasn't
called."
Others have been calling, though.
Thomas' secretary told him someone
named Victor was trying to find out

who he is and a woman named Vicki
from Menlo Park saw the ad and
called, thinking it was the Thomas
from Denver she dated a year ago,
only to be disappointed again.
Thomas labels himself as a hope
less romantic, but around the office
he's inspiring all sorts of jokes and
advice. His accountant thinks he
should buy billboards on the major
streets from Stanford to Millbrae,
while his secretary counsels that
skywriting is probably the most effec
tive method of getting her attention.
1 was going to suggest that since
she's a pre-med, he should probably
train bacteria cultures to spell out his
phone number for her next lab, but
then I realized he might just do it.
1 figure she's already under a lot of
pressure, and I don't want to develop
a "Dear Abby" complex anyway.
Someone's been running ads in the
personal column urging her to call the
guy. Everyone loves an underdog.
Look for next week's installment of
"Ads The World Turns" to find out
the answers to those gripping ques
tions. Will Vicki call Thomas? Will
Mark call Vicki? Will Thomas hate


BUG
ME

Mark for asking this question? If
someone gets shot, will he come out
of the coma in time to stop the wed
ding? Will I ever stop asking these
questions?
I know the answer to that one.
Dear Bug Me,
For all the people who saw "The
Gods Must Be Crazy," one truly im
portant question arises: Do rhinos
really stamp out brush fires? - WCM
They do in the movie. I have to
thank you for getting me to go see
this movie. It was fun, and now I can
be glad you didn't ask me to explain
anything else about its themes like
whether God really put evil into the
world or how the bushmen make that
clicking noise when they talk.
I'm afraid I wouldn't have had time
this week to write a philosophical es
say with any sort of quality, much less
learn a new language. I have enough
trouble with French r's.
I must admit I didn't call Marlin
Perkins of Mutual of Omaha fame for
this question, but I did the very next
best thing and talked to Harold
Francis, manager of hoofstock at
Marine World Africa USA, who said
that he's never seen a rhino stomp out
any fire on Rhino Island but that
they "don't really throw matches at
them that often."
He said he did recall hearing some
thing to the effect that they have been
known to stomp fires, but he didn't
check up on it, never expecting to
need that information for the reason
mentioned above.
He did explain that rhinos have
very thick skin padding on the bot

toms of their feet, hut that it would
probably still hurt them some to go
pyro.
I tried to get him to explain why a
rhino might hate to see an innocent
little marshmallow roaster out on the
Calahari.
He divulged that rhinos have very
poor eyesight and that they re protec
tive of their young. I guess it they
mistook a campfire as a menace to
junior, there might be some tire flat
tening.
Dear Bug Me,
What's the hole in the middle of the
Quad? - anonymous
I've gotten about three questions to
this effect, so it must be a burning
campus issue nowadays. My guess
was a wading pond for migrant geese,
but it turns out that it's a rosette that
hasn't quite bloomed yet.
Roger Cairns, the project manager
for the University, said that the con
tractor has'been swamped with jobs
and the new ornate bellybutton tor
the Quad which should have been
done by this time is now hoped to be
in place by the end of March.
The completed rosette will be
about 30 feet across in a pattern like
that on the walls of the Memorial
Court in front of the Quad.
Originally, the Quad had such a
rosette, but it had become faded.
The new design will be done in red,
beige and brown slabs of concrete
that have to be transported carefully
to avoid breakage in the trip from
their production site in Fremont.
Then they will be laid out in the
proper pattern, a process taking
about a week.
1 couldn't find out anything more
concrete than that.

want you to know who he is.
"It's very embarrassing," he said.
People at work have been kidding
him about all the strange calls he's
gotten, and he doesn't want it to af
fect his job any more.
1 would have called Vicki for you,
but he doesn't know her last name.
That's why he ran the ad.
They met when he flew out to ski at
Squaw Valley one weekend. They
spent the whole day on the slopes to
gether, and she was going to write
down her address and phone number
for him, but he didn't have any pock
ets to hold a piece of paper in.
"She was funny and nice and
charming and 1 kick myself in the
head now for not getting her phone
number," said the 30-year-old during
the phone interview.
All he knows is that she's a pre

med at Stanford and she lives in Mill
brae. He hoped she would respond
to the ad so he could fly out and have
dinner in San Francisco with her,
probably at Ondine's.
"I use pianes like other people use
cars," he said to explain that he

doesn't want to marry her, just "get
to see if we could get together for din
ner one night."
He's already spent $1,278 on five
days' worth of eye-catching ads and
says,"I would like to find her again,
but on the other hand, she hasn't
called."
Others have been calling, though.
Thomas' secretary told him someone
named Victor was trying to find out

who he is and a woman named Vicki
from Menlo Park saw the ad and
called, thinking it was the Thomas
from Denver she dated a year ago,
only to be disappointed again.
Thomas labels himself as a hope
less romantic, but around the office
he's inspiring all sorts of jokes and
advice. His accountant thinks he
should buy billboards on the major
streets from Stanford to Millbrae,
while his secretary counsels that
skywriting is probably the most effec
tive method of getting her attention.
1 was going to suggest that since
she's a pre-med, he should probably
train bacteria cultures to spell out his
phone number for her next lab, but
then I realized he might just do it.
1 figure she's already under a lot of
pressure, and I don't want to develop
a "Dear Abby" complex anyway.
Someone's been running ads in the
personal column urging her to call the
guy. Everyone loves an underdog.
Look for next week's installment of
"Ads The World Turns" to find out
the answers to those gripping ques
tions. Will Vicki call Thomas? Will
Mark call Vicki? Will Thomas hate


BUG
ME

Mark for asking this question? If
someone gets shot, will he come out
of the coma in time to stop the wed
ding? Will I ever stop asking these
questions?
I know the answer to that one.
Dear Bug Me,
For all the people who saw "The
Gods Must Be Crazy," one truly im
portant question arises: Do rhinos
really stamp out brush fires? - WCM
They do in the movie. I have to
thank you for getting me to go see
this movie. It was fun, and now I can
be glad you didn't ask me to explain
anything else about its themes like
whether God really put evil into the
world or how the bushmen make that
clicking noise when they talk.
I'm afraid I wouldn't have had time
this week to write a philosophical es
say with any sort of quality, much less
learn a new language. I have enough
trouble with French r's.
I must admit I didn't call Marlin
Perkins of Mutual of Omaha fame for
this question, but I did the very next
best thing and talked to Harold
Francis, manager of hoofstock at
Marine World Africa USA, who said
that he's never seen a rhino stomp out
any fire on Rhino Island but that
they "don't really throw matches at
them that often."
He said he did recall hearing some
thing to the effect that they have been
known to stomp fires, but he didn't
check up on it, never expecting to
need that information for the reason
mentioned above.
He did explain that rhinos have
very thick skin padding on the bot

toms of their feet, hut that it would
probably still hurt them some to go
pyro.
I tried to get him to explain why a
rhino might hate to see an innocent
little marshmallow roaster out on the
Calahari.
He divulged that rhinos have very
poor eyesight and that they re protec
tive of their young. I guess it they
mistook a campfire as a menace to
junior, there might be some tire flat
tening.
Dear Bug Me,
What's the hole in the middle of the
Quad? - anonymous
I've gotten about three questions to
this effect, so it must be a burning
campus issue nowadays. My guess
was a wading pond for migrant geese,
but it turns out that it's a rosette that
hasn't quite bloomed yet.
Roger Cairns, the project manager
for the University, said that the con
tractor has'been swamped with jobs
and the new ornate bellybutton tor
the Quad which should have been
done by this time is now hoped to be
in place by the end of March.
The completed rosette will be
about 30 feet across in a pattern like
that on the walls of the Memorial
Court in front of the Quad.
Originally, the Quad had such a
rosette, but it had become faded.
The new design will be done in red,
beige and brown slabs of concrete
that have to be transported carefully
to avoid breakage in the trip from
their production site in Fremont.
Then they will be laid out in the
proper pattern, a process taking
about a week.
1 couldn't find out anything more
concrete than that.
