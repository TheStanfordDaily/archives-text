Dear Bug Me,
Who the hell are Vicki and Thomas
and why will he hate her forever if she
doesn't call him in Denver? - Mark
Carmichael
1 called Thomas in Denver, just
like a lot of other Stanford students
who had nothing better to do when
they read his quarter-page ads in The
Daily a few weeks ago, and he doesn't
want you to know who he is.
"It's very embarrassing," he said.
People at work have been kidding
him about all the strange calls he's
gotten, and he doesn't want it to af
fect his job any more.
1 would have called Vicki for you,
but he doesn't know her last name.
That's why he ran the ad.
They met when he flew out to ski at
Squaw Valley one weekend. They
spent the whole day on the slopes to
gether, and she was going to write
down her address and phone number
for him, but he didn't have any pock
ets to hold a piece of paper in.
"She was funny and nice and
charming and 1 kick myself in the
head now for not getting her phone
number," said the 30-year-old during
the phone interview.
All he knows is that she's a pre

med at Stanford and she lives in Mill
brae. He hoped she would respond
to the ad so he could fly out and have
dinner in San Francisco with her,
probably at Ondine's.
"I use pianes like other people use
cars," he said to explain that he

doesn't want to marry her, just "get
to see if we could get together for din
ner one night."
He's already spent $1,278 on five
days' worth of eye-catching ads and
says,"I would like to find her again,
but on the other hand, she hasn't
called."
Others have been calling, though.
Thomas' secretary told him someone
named Victor was trying to find out

who he is and a woman named Vicki
from Menlo Park saw the ad and
called, thinking it was the Thomas
from Denver she dated a year ago,
only to be disappointed again.
Thomas labels himself as a hope
less romantic, but around the office
he's inspiring all sorts of jokes and
advice. His accountant thinks he
should buy billboards on the major
streets from Stanford to Millbrae,
while his secretary counsels that
skywriting is probably the most effec
tive method of getting her attention.
1 was going to suggest that since
she's a pre-med, he should probably
train bacteria cultures to spell out his
phone number for her next lab, but
then I realized he might just do it.
1 figure she's already under a lot of
pressure, and I don't want to develop
a "Dear Abby" complex anyway.
Someone's been running ads in the
personal column urging her to call the
guy. Everyone loves an underdog.
Look for next week's installment of
"Ads The World Turns" to find out
the answers to those gripping ques
tions. Will Vicki call Thomas? Will
Mark call Vicki? Will Thomas hate
