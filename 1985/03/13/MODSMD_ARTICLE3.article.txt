# Profs. unsure about Gorbachev's course
## 
### MARK LAWRENCE Staff writer 
Soviet specialists here agree that the selection of 54-
year-old Mikhail Gorbachev to lead the Soviet Union
represents a significant break in that country's political
tradition, but they are uncertain whether the move will
mean improved relations with the United States.
Gorbachev, the youngest member of the Politburo, the
primary Soviet governing body, was elected General Sec
retary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in a
special meeting of the party's Central Committee
on Monday following the death of Soviet President
Konstantin Chernenko. Chernenko is the third elderly So
viet leader to die in 28 months.
"Certainly we're dealing with a much more energetic
man," said Richard Staar, a senior fellow at the Hoover
Institute. "Those (former) leaders were very narrow
minded, blinded by Marxist-Leninist theory," he added.
Political Science Prof. John Lewis said, "The most ob
vious change is from one generation to another. This
means creative leadership in tune with the Soviet state.
Gorbachev is an able, young, educated administrator who
has had considerable experience in the Soviet hierarchy."
However, Soviet experts are careful to point out that
very little can be determined about the new leadership. "1
would be optimistic at this point, but we can't tell," said
Staar. He added that it is a good sign that Gorbachev was
elected rather than Politburo member Grigori Romanov,
a "hard-line police-user" and one of the candidates for

the top post. Gorbachev "may turn out to he as bad —
we'll just have to wait and see," cautioned Staar.
"It's difficult to know. We don't know very much what
positions are being taken up by the leadership" said
Robert Conquest, senior research fellow at the Hoover
Institute. The basis of any speculation at this point is "a
few facts and a little guesswork," he said.
Coit Blacker, associate director of the Center for Inter
national Security and Arms Control here, said, "1 think it is
unlikely that there will be great changes in Soviet foreign
or domestic policy in the near term. It will take a long time
before he can put his people into (important) positions . . .
We think he's interested in economic reform, but we don't
know if he's innovative or not," he said.
Conquest agreed that it will be necessary for Gorbachev
to incorporate "his own people" into the government "to
make any radical reforms. ... It's difficult to know how
far a leader can go unless he has a powerful leadership" he
said.
However, Blacker said of any speculation on the spe
cific path of the new government: "We just don't know,
and anyone who says otherwise is making it up."
With leadership change in Moscow, Soviet experts are
not optimistic about the arms reduction talks which began
yesterday in Geneva.
Conquest said that, in principle, the change in leader
ship should not greatly effect the arms talks, but that, in
practice, it may. Soviet leaders may not be able to corn-
municate their decisions easily and,
the change in leadership may "slow
things up," he said.
Staar said that changes in leader
ship have inhibited arms-reduction
talks in the past. "If you look back,
since Jan. 1981, (the United States)
has had to deal with three different
Soviet leaders and each has been in
capacitated. This (inconsistency) did
have a very definite impact on arms
control talks," he said.
With a new Soviet leader who
could lead the nation for the next 25
years or more, Staar said, "There's a
chance that the Politburo will get
serious about these talks and we can
make some headway."
At this point, however, CISAC
Director Lewis said Gorbachev "is
going to be tough."
He said he believes Gorbachev is
"more interested in Europe and the
future of that relationship," than the
relationship between the Soviet
Union and the United States.
The ramifications of President
Reagan's decision not to attend Cher
nenko's funeral today and meet the
new Soviet leader is an issue on which
Soviet experts disagree.
Staar agrees with Reagan's deci
sion: "I don't think it would make
any sense for Mr. Reagan to go to the
funeral of a man under whose leader
ship he was compared to Hitler.
Conquest said that an appearance
by Reagan might be interpreted in
Moscow as a detrimental "political
signal."
HI acker called the decision
"unfortunate." He said, "If I were an
adviser to him, I would have advised
him to go.
"It's a big mistake," said Lewis.
"It's a chance to make contact not
only with a new leader but with a new
generation. He may be leader for the
next 25 years," he said.

new Soviet leader is an issue on which
Soviet experts disagree.
Staar agrees with Reagan's deci
sion: "I don't think it would make
any sense for Mr. Reagan to go to the
funeral of a man under whose leader
ship he was compared to Hitler.
Conquest said that an appearance
by Reagan might be interpreted in
Moscow as a detrimental "political
signal."
HI acker called the decision
"unfortunate." He said, "If I were an
adviser to him, I would have advised
him to go.
"It's a big mistake," said Lewis.
"It's a chance to make contact not
only with a new leader but with a new
generation. He may be leader for the
next 25 years," he said.
Soviet specialists here agree that the selection of 54-
year-old Mikhail Gorbachev to lead the Soviet Union
represents a significant break in that country's political
tradition, but they are uncertain whether the move will
mean improved relations with the United States.
Gorbachev, the youngest member of the Politburo, the
primary Soviet governing body, was elected General Sec
retary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in a
special meeting of the party's Central Committee
on Monday following the death of Soviet President
Konstantin Chernenko. Chernenko is the third elderly So
viet leader to die in 28 months.
"Certainly we're dealing with a much more energetic
man," said Richard Staar, a senior fellow at the Hoover
Institute. "Those (former) leaders were very narrow
minded, blinded by Marxist-Leninist theory," he added.
Political Science Prof. John Lewis said, "The most ob
vious change is from one generation to another. This
means creative leadership in tune with the Soviet state.
Gorbachev is an able, young, educated administrator who
has had considerable experience in the Soviet hierarchy."
However, Soviet experts are careful to point out that
very little can be determined about the new leadership. "1
would be optimistic at this point, but we can't tell," said
Staar. He added that it is a good sign that Gorbachev was
elected rather than Politburo member Grigori Romanov,
a "hard-line police-user" and one of the candidates for

the top post. Gorbachev "may turn out to he as bad —
we'll just have to wait and see," cautioned Staar.
"It's difficult to know. We don't know very much what
positions are being taken up by the leadership" said
Robert Conquest, senior research fellow at the Hoover
Institute. The basis of any speculation at this point is "a
few facts and a little guesswork," he said.
Coit Blacker, associate director of the Center for Inter
national Security and Arms Control here, said, "1 think it is
unlikely that there will be great changes in Soviet foreign
or domestic policy in the near term. It will take a long time
before he can put his people into (important) positions . . .
We think he's interested in economic reform, but we don't
know if he's innovative or not," he said.
Conquest agreed that it will be necessary for Gorbachev
to incorporate "his own people" into the government "to
make any radical reforms. ... It's difficult to know how
far a leader can go unless he has a powerful leadership" he
said.
However, Blacker said of any speculation on the spe
cific path of the new government: "We just don't know,
and anyone who says otherwise is making it up."
With leadership change in Moscow, Soviet experts are
not optimistic about the arms reduction talks which began
yesterday in Geneva.
Conquest said that, in principle, the change in leader
ship should not greatly effect the arms talks, but that, in
practice, it may. Soviet leaders may not be able to corn-
municate their decisions easily and,
the change in leadership may "slow
things up," he said.
Staar said that changes in leader
ship have inhibited arms-reduction
talks in the past. "If you look back,
since Jan. 1981, (the United States)
has had to deal with three different
Soviet leaders and each has been in
capacitated. This (inconsistency) did
have a very definite impact on arms
control talks," he said.
With a new Soviet leader who
could lead the nation for the next 25
years or more, Staar said, "There's a
chance that the Politburo will get
serious about these talks and we can
make some headway."
At this point, however, CISAC
Director Lewis said Gorbachev "is
going to be tough."
He said he believes Gorbachev is
"more interested in Europe and the
future of that relationship," than the
relationship between the Soviet
Union and the United States.
The ramifications of President
Reagan's decision not to attend Cher
nenko's funeral today and meet the
