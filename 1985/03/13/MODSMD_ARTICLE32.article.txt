## Research supports psychic phenomena 
### NIKO SCHIFF Editorial staff 
Researchers in the field of para
psychology seem to be making prog
ress in the documentation and study
of anomalous phenomena. Russell
Targ and Keith Harary of Delphi As
sociates, a private research group
based in San Mateo, are investigating
the group of phenomena such as
clairvoyance, precognition and
telepathy that falls into the category
of anomalous phenomena.
Most of their research concerns the
phenomena they and other research
ers have termed "remote viewing."
Remote viewing is where one person
views an object or a location un
known to him; the distance over
which this viewing takes place may be
great, and the process may also in
volve "seeing" into the future.
In their most recent experiment,
Targ and his daughter Elisabeth, a
third-year Stanford medical student
and certified Russian translator,
traveled to the Soviet Union to con
duct a remote viewing experiment. In
the experiment, a Soviet woman who
had never been outside the U.S.S.R. was
apparently able to "see," through the
process of remote viewing, an un
known site in San Francisco where
Harary would stand six hours after
her viewing.
Targ, who was trained as a
physicist, has been involved in psy
chic research for the last 20 years. He
worked at GTE Sylvania until 1972
building state-of-the-art lasers while
keeping up with current research in
psychic phenomena.
Harary, a psychologist, did re
search at Duke University and
Maimonides Medical Center before
working with Targ at SRI Interna
tional, formerly Stanford Research
Institute.
Targ began research at SRI in
1972, conducting experiments in
remote viewing and other
phenomena with funding from the
federal government. In 1982, he and
Harary decided to leave SRI and, to
gether with San Franciso busines
sman Anthony White, a graduate of
the Graduate School of Business with JLS
years experience as a financial con
sultant and venture-capital specialist,
formed Delphi Associates.
Targ and Harary left SRI because
they felt they wanted to put more ef
fort into pure research instead of
defense applications. "There would
be a new project for an application al
most everyday we arrived at work,"
Targ said. In 1982, the U.S. govern
ment "decided to no longer support
research-only applications," he ex
plained. "As scientists, Keith and 1
felt there were many unanswered
questions left."
The experiment conducted in the
Soviet Union in October was done in
collaboration with colleagues in the
Theoretical Problems Department at

the Soviet Academy of Sciences in
Moscow.
The experiment involved a woman
•named Djuna Davitashvili, a famous
Soviet healer, who was asked to
describe the location in San Francisco
where Harary would be hiding. The
experiments were videotaped and
witnessed by scientists from the So
viet academy.
"Djuna had not previously at
tempted or experienced anything that
would resemble clairvoyance and was
not chosen because we thought she
was especially psychic," said Targ.
The experiment took place in
Djuna's apartment at 2 p.m. Moscow
time, when Elisabeth Targ began to

interview Djuna in Russian, ques
tioning her about the place Harary
would be located six hours later. She
was asked to describe images and
impressions she had in connections
with the place and to make drawings
of what she saw.
Six hours later, 10 a.m. in Califor
nia, Harary awoke and activated a
random number generator to choose
one of the six target locations in San
Francisco that he had previously se
lected. The sites were selected to be
interesting but not famous places
which were significantly different
from one another. Each place was
represented by a postcard sealed in
an envelope. The envelopes were

given to Targ, who had no knowledge
of the target locations, to take to the
Soviet Union.
Harary went to the selected site —
the merry-go-round at Pier 39 — and
remained there for a half an hour.
The researchers in Moscow called
Harary at midnight Moscow time to
find out where he had been and then
opened the appropriate envelope
which contained the postcard.
" Djuna's description of the site had
many unique and striking correspon
dances with the target location" Targ
said. "She described a 'small plaza'
containing a round structure with a
