# Targ employs physics to explain the psychic

The most curious aspect of re
search in the field of parapsychol
ogy seems to be how these
phenomena could be accounted
for given the current views of sci
ence and causality. Guesswork in
modern physics and theoretical
philosophy seems to be offering
some clues to these anomalous
phenomena.
Many theories have been of
fered, including the possibility that
this kind of perception is a form of
telepathy and the proposal the
origin of psychic phenomena is a
signal in the form of a low fre
quency electromagnetic wave.
Russell Targ and Keith Harary of
Delphi Associates, a private re
search group based in San Mateo,
actually tested the electromagnetic
radiation hypothesis by conduct
ing remote viewing experiments
from a submarine.

Sea water is known to be an ex
cellent shield for the extremely
low frequency waves that are
hypothesized. The test concluded
that the effect of electrical shield
ing is apparently insignificant.
However, not enough is known to
discount the hypothesis.
Targ feels at this time that the
answer will probably come from
the principles of physics. "The an
swer will probably arise out of a
reassessment of the geometry of
space and time rather than elec
tromagnetic theory."
Rather than a cause and effect
view of time and space, an obser
ver could conceivably receive in
formation from the future. To im-

agine this the viewer can be seen
"as situated at the origin of the
coordinate axis with the ability to
focus his attention where ever he
may choose to, this would be a
way to reintegrate the metric of
space and time," said Targ.
The diagram shows a mapping
of an event in space and time, the
origin represents the present with
the vertical axis representing space
and the horizontal axis represent
ing time. Moving from left to right
along the time axis, -t represents
the past and -f-t represents the
future.
The event in this theory sends
out signals to the past and future.
If all the events happening in
space and time could be
represented on a graph with the
observer at the center than the
idea of precognition would involve
the observers recognition of a
wave of information from a future
event that he encounters as he

moves from -t to t. His precogni
tion would be the awareness of the
event before he was colinear with
its origin.
Tracing the history of these
developments, Targ said, "In the
'60s there were new results in
modern physics that seemed to be
related to things in parapsychol
ogy research." There was a move
ment to "understand the physics
and psychology of psychic
phenomena," he said.
However, research in psychic
phenomena has mainly focused on
documenting and confirming the
existence of the phenomena rather
than developing explanations, said
Targ.
