# Space test for general relativity theory

### PATRICK LIN Editorial staff 
"Einstein's theory of general
relativity is simultaneously one of the
most important theories in physics
today and one of the least tested
theories in physics."
Those are the words of Francis
Everett, professor of research in the
High Energy Physics Laboratory here.
Everett is currently in charge of a
project designed to test Einstein's
theory critically. The project will in
volve a very novel idea — the use of
orbiting gyroscopes which will be
launched from the Space Shuttle.
Putting the gyroscopes into
orbit will not only mark
the attainment of Everett's goals but
also the realization of Leonard
Schiff s dreams.
Schiff, a former chairman of the
Stanford Physics department, con
ceived the ingenious idea of the orbit
ing gyroscopes in 1960. Unfortun
ately, however, he did not live to see
his idea implemented.
In 1989 and 1991, when the gyro
scopes are scheduled for launch,
Schiff s ideas — as well as those of
Einstein, Everett and many others —
could bear long-awaited fruit.
During Einstein's lifetime he pro
posed two theories of relativity. One
was the theory of special relativity
and the other was the theory of gen
eral relativity.
The theory of special relativity
deals with the "properties of objects
moving at speeds appreciable to the
the speed of light," said Everett. The
theory makes many predictions —
such as increase in mass, dilation of
time and contraction of distance —
when objects approach the speed of
light.
According to Everett, the theory of
special relativity is an "extremely
well-tested theory" of physics. Parti
cle accelerators, such as that at
the Stanford Linear Accelerator Cen
ter, have made it possible to observe
the behavior of subatomic particles as
they reach the velocity of light.
One important prediction of the
theory of special relativity is that no

particle or signal could travel faster
than the speed of light.
This prediction, in fact, was the
motivation for Einstein's theory of
general relativity. In classical or New
tonian physics, gravity is propagated
instantaneously.
Two objects in the presence of each
other immediately exert gravitational
forces on each other. If one object is
shaken, the gravitational force on the
other object instantaneously changes.
However, if the theory of special
relativity is correct, then it is
impossible for gravity, or any other
force, to be propagated instan
taneously, because nothing could
travel faster than light.
Einstein's theory of general

relativity addresses this problem. A
simple way to view the theory is that
it is "Einstein's theory of gravity,"
said Everett.
The theory of general relativity
proposes that gravity is transmitted as
a wave, much like electromagnetic ra
diation such as light.
In contrast to the well-tested the
ory of special relativity, the general
theory of relativity has proven intrac
table to thorough verification.
Einstein himself was able to suggest
only two ways of testing the theory,
said Everett.
One test was planet Mercury,
which Einstein predicted to move a
little differently than was com
monly thought. The other was a beam

of light shone from behind the sun.
Einstein predicted that this beam
should be bent.
In 1960 Schiff "suggested two
completely new tests" of Einstein's
theory. Both entailed the use of gyro
scopes, which essentially are any
spinning objects.
According to classical phys
ics, a gyroscope in a vacuum
"will go on pointing in the
same direction for all time," said
Everett. That is, a gyroscope in space
will have an axis of spin that never
changes direction.
Indeed, since gyroscopes do not
perceptibly change their direction,
they have been extensively used to
aid in the navigation of airplanes,

spacecraft and missiles.
According to Einstein's theory,
however, a gyroscope orbiting the
earth will slowly change its direction
or axis of spin, albeit by a minute
amount.
Two effects account for the gyro
scope's change of direction. One is a
warping of space around the earth.
According to Einstein, the circum
ference of a satellite's orbit around
the earth will be somewhat less than
that calculated from simple geometry.
Because of the curvature of space,
the gyroscope's axis of rotation will
change a little with every orbit
around the earth.
The other effect that causes the
gyroscope to change direction is that

"as the earth rotates, space and time
get dragged around the earth, said
Everett. The earth's rotation sets up a
"gravito-magnetic field" which would
act on the gyroscope and exert a pull
on its axis of rotation.
The changes in the gyroscope's di
rection that Everett hopes to measure
are very small. He has calculated a
change of 6.9 arc sec, to be exact, in
the angle of the gyroscope. According
to Everett, this is the angle subtended
by a human hair held 10 miles away
from an observer.
However, said Everett, it is
believed that the tiny effects seen
with the gyroscopes become enor
mous when one deals with massive
objects in outer space, such as col
lapsed stars and black holes.
One astrophysical phenomenon
that could possibly be accounted for
by the theory of general relativity is
the radio-jets emitted by certain
quasars, said Everett. These enor
mous jets are thought to be generated
by the gravito-magnetic field, accord
ing to Everett.
Although the launch date for the
gyroscopes is set for 1989, Everett
and his colleagues have already
developed much of the hardware for
the project.
Most notably, a working gyroscope
has been built and tested. This was
largely the work of John Lipa,
who is currently working on another
project to be flown on the Space
Shuttle.
The gyroscope is composed of a
fused-quartz ball about the size of a
ping-pong ball. The gyroscope is
suspended electrically in a perfect
vacuum, and it will rotate at 10,000
revolutions per minute.
In 1989, a test run of all the hard
ware will be held aboard the space
shuttle. According to Everett, the
great advantage of the shuttle is that
one could do a rehearsal of the ex
periments and then bring back the
hardware to refurbish it and make
any necessary modifications.
The date for launching the gyro
scopes from the space shuttle into or
bit has tentatively been set for 1991.
