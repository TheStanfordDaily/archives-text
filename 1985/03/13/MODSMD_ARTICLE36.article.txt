## Groups sue to stop Sand Hill Road project 
### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
If you ask Palo Alto Council Member Mike Cobb, the
Bard put it best.
"The lady doth protest too much, methinks," said
Cobb, quoting Shakespeare to illustrate what he perceives
is one community's overreaction to a proposed 2,400-foot
connection that would link Sand Hill Road with El
Camino Real.
"The lady" is Menlo Park, whose citizens are pursuing
three separate lawsuits that might block Stanford's con
struction of the Sand Hill Road extension, a project ap
proved by the Palo Alto City Council last September after
10 years of discussion between Palo Alto and Stanford.
The suits — two of which were filed by special-interest
groups and one by the city council on behalf of all resi
dents of Menlo Park — differ in scope but share a belief
that the extension project, as currently planned, would be
harmful to the town's citizens by increasing traffic, noise
and other inconveniences.
The result is a power struggle pitting Menlo Park
against Palo Alto and Stanford in a town-gown soap opera
that has lawyers for all three communities scurrying about
filing briefs, analyzing environmental impact documents
and trying to determine exactly what Stanford is up to in
the so-called Sand Hill (formerly Willow) corridor.
"The cities of Menlo Park and Palo Alto have problems
just between them, and whenever Stanford steps in there
are bound to be more problems," said Nancy Watt, proj
ect coordinator in the Stanford Real Estate Office.
Stanford officials say the extension is necessary to alle
viate the rush-hour traffic jams that pile up near the Stan
ford Medical Center. The connection would allow traffic
in this area access to Menlo Park, Palo Alto and, ulti
mately, the Bayshore Freeway. Sand Hill Road currently
feeds into the Stanford Shopping Center parking lot.
The proposed extension would be built just north of the
shopping center along the San Francisquito Creek, which
serves as the boundary between Palo Alto and Menlo
Park, as well as Santa Clara County and San Mateo
County. Stanford would foot the whole bill for the project
— nearly $3 million for the actual road and other im
provements, and an additional $650,000 for related im
provements to be completed in the near future.
But the Menlo Park lawsuits question the legality of the
entire project. Specifically, action is being taken by:
• The city of Menlo Park, in a suit that claims Palo Alto
and Stanford are guilty of not considering alternate plans
before approving the project;
• The Citizens For Sensible Planning Committee, in a suit
that alleges the Palo Alto City Council failed to assess the
impact of the "mitigation measures" it attached to the ex
tension;
• The Citizens For a Safe and Sensible San Francisquito
Creek Area Routing, in a series of suits that maintain
Stanford is developing the west side of campus in
"piecemeal" fashion, and is thus ignoring the cumulative
impact of its actions.
Most of the controversy surrounds the project's envi
ronmental impact report (EIR), paid for by Stanford and
ultimately approved by Palo Alto after consultants
worked on it for more than two years. State law requires
that all major developments be accompanied by an EIR,
which is supposed to analyze the environmental effects of
a proposed project.
Jack Cosgrove, attorney for Menlo Park, said the EIR
that was drafted for the Sand Hill Road extension project
is "deficient" because Palo Alto officials did not ade
quately consult with Menlo Park city staff members
during its preparation.
"We are a sister entity affected by the project,"
Cosgrove said. "Palo Alto has a legal duty of consultation

with Menlo Park. We want them to go back and do this
right."
The Menlo Park suit specifically asks that the traffic
from the extension have access east of El Camino to Alma
Street, Cosgrove said. The city also requests a sound wall
be built to protect Menlo Park homes along the corridor.
A similar wall is already planned for Palo Alto, a result ot
one of many conditions Palo Alto placed upon the exten
sion before approving it.
Cosgrove said access to Alma is necessary to avoid
excess traffic on El Camino in Menlo Park.
"We feel Palo Alto has perhaps inadvertantly
structured this thing to try to divert its traffic north to
Menlo Park," Cosgrove said.
But Palo Alto Council Member Cobb said he and

others could never accede to Menlo Park's demand.
"Our constituents don't want a lot of traffic flowing to
the north part of town," Cobb said. He said he would not
have voted for the extension last year if access to Alma
was one of its features.
Cobb added that Menlo Park has "created a great deal
of problems through its own actions" — actions that in
clude avid development along El Camino which only
"exacerbates their traffic problems," he said.
Kathryn Dickson, an attorney representing the Citizens
For Sensible Planning Committee, agrees that the EIR for
the Sand Hill Road extension project is "inadequate," but
for reasons different from Cosgrove's.
Dickson, who filed briefs in Santa Clara County Friday
and expects a judge to hear both this case and the city's
suit in May, said her clients object not to the actual exten
sion, but to the stipulations placed upon the project by
Palo Alto.
These conditions — part of the September agreement
between Palo Alto and Stanford — include building a

third lane along Sand Hill from Pasteur Drive to Santa
Cruz Avenue and erecting a sound wall, frontage road and
"unspecified stream crossings" elsewhere in the corridor,
according to Dickson.
"Even if you want to call them mitigation measures,'
Dickson said, "you better analyze them too." She said the
EIR does not adequately takes these measures into ac
count.
"That's a fair amount of construction and they haven't
even analyzed how this would affect the community,'
Dickson said. "The EIR process was really flawed.
Clearly they (Palo Alto) have to go back and start again."
She said if the judge demands that a second EIR be
prepared, the Palo Alto City Council would scrutinize and
reject it this time around.

"We think a full-scale EIR might tip the balance,"
Dickson said.
But Palo Alto and Stanford officials steadfastly — and
often indignantly — maintain that the EIR is more than
adequate. Some imply that Menlo Park failed to speak out
during the critical planning stages of the EIR, when their
input was sought.
"The city of Palo Alto sent copies of the EIR (to Menlo
Park) and informed them of the meetings, and there-was
not a good deal of response from the city of Menlo Park
during the EIR process," said Watt, a Stanford real estate
official. "They were included as fully as is required and
even more so."
Marlene Prendergast, assistant city attorney for Palo
Alto, said, "We had ample public comment and we
prepared an extensive Environmental Impact Report. . . .
We think our processes are correct."
Stanford attorney Rodney Johnson echoed these state
ments; "We feel like the environmental review is ade

quate, and we will put on a very strong defense on why it
was adequate."
Cobb not only stands by the validity of the EIR. but he
questions basing lawsuits on "a subjective document."
"It seems to me that EIRs are often used as legal whip
ping boys," Cobb said. "But what else are they going to
attack? That's a good way to try to slow the process
down."
The third suit over the road extension was tiled by
Nancy Jewell Cross, a Menlo Park resident and environ
mentalist. Protesting not what Stanford develops but how
it goes about it. Cross names Stanford, Palo Alto. Menlo
Park, Santa Clara County and San Mateo County as par
ties in the suit.
"We're trying to make sense of this very polluted and
congested corridor," Cross said. "The suit doesn't say
Stanford can't do these things, it says the process isn't
right."
In addition to the extension, Stanford is pursuing or has
indicated a desire to pursue several other projects in this
area: the Stanford West housing project, the Hospital
Modernization Project, the ll 00 Welch Road housing
complex and development of 86 acres of University land
on Sand Hill Road across from the Stanford West site.
"Each one of these is of concern, but if you take the ac
cumulated impact of them all, that's going to change the
character of the Willow Road corridor," Dickson said.
She admitted one of the "real concerns" of her clients is
"what the plans are for the west side of campus."
Andy Doty, Stanford director of community relations,
said the University recognizes this concern. As evidence.
Doty said Menlo Park officials have been invited to par
ticipate in the bi-monthly "liaison committee" meetings
that up until now have been exclusively for Palo Alto and
Stanford representatives.
Doty said all three communities should be represented
at these meetings because "so much of what the Univer
sity is doing these days is in that Sand Hill corridor.' He
calls communication at these meetings the "DEW line,"
because officials use the opportunity to offer "Distant
Early Warnings" to their neighbors about "potential
problems that may be on the horizon."
Despite the flurry of legal activity, most officials from
Stanford, Palo Alto and Menlo Park say there is no bitter
ness among them.
"I know there's some ill will along San Francisquito
Creek about the way Stanford would like to use its land,
but I don't think that transfers out to Menlo Park as a
whole," Doty said.
Peg Gunn and Ted Sorensen, Menlo Park council mem
bers, agree. Gunn said she treats "this all in an objective
manner, and I maintain an excellent rapport with the
council members in Palo Alto and the people at Stan
ford."
Although Gunn, former mayor of Menlo Park, stands
by the legality of the city's suit, she said, "I don't feel any
bitterness toward anyone" involved.
Sorensen said Menlo Park wants to avoid returning to
"an adverserial relationship." He said, "We do not have a
beef with Stanford. Our beef is with Palo Alto because we
want to cross the street to Alma."
Cosgrove complained that neither Palo Alto nor Stan
ford has "evinced the slightest willingness to discuss any
resolution of this."
"How can you bargain with somebody who doesn't
want to bargain?" he asked.
Cobb, on Palo Alto's behalf, said, "We're not trying to
do anything to Menlo Park, but we have to be responsive
to our constituents."
Meanwhile, Stanford officials are moving ahead with
design plans for the Sand Hill Road extension, hoping that
the lawyers will be gone before the bulldozers arrive.
