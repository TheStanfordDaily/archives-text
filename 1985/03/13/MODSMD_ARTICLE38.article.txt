## Students now eligible to join credit union 
### CAMERON KALLER Senior staff writer 
For the first time in history, all
Stanford students and members of
the alumni association are able to
join the Stanford Federal Credit
Union. Previously, only those on the
University payroll were eligible for
credit union loans and allowed to
hold accounts.
The Credit Union Board of Direc
tors recently amended its bylaws to
include "undergraduate, graduate
and post-graduate students enrolled
in the Palo Alto campus of Stanford
University" as members, according to
Adele Gonzalez, vice president of
marketing for the credit union.
In the Dec. 26, 1984 meeting, the
directors also approved an amend
ment that makes loans available for
purchasing microcomputers ordered
through the University Microdisc
program or directly from other ven
dors.
Normal credit procedures will ap
ply to the loans, although students
,who do not meet credit guidelines
may still qualify with a parent as a
cosigner, said Gonzalez.
"Membership will give students the
chance to apply for a Visa card, a
computer loan, even a car loan if they
wish," Gonzalez said. "People are
still asking what a credit union is, how
it is different from a bank and what it
will do for them, but it is basically
very similar to a bank."
Credit unions offer the same
services as banks do, "only at much
better rates," according to Gonzalez.
Charles Dawes, credit union pres
ident, explained that "a couple of
years ago the credit union had some
problems, but we've tried not to dwell
on them. What counts is that we came
out of them, and we're offering many
new services," he said.
Fast-Tel, a system that allows
home banking via telephone, is one
such new service.

According to Dawes, people can
dial their account to check their bal
ance, transfer funds or just check to
see if and when a check has cleared.
Fast-Tel has already received more
than 3,000 calls a month.
To join the union, one must pay an
initial $5 membership fee and deposit
a minimum of $50 into a checking or
savings account.
"Our rates are very, very good,"
Gonzalez said. "First of all, we pay
interest on any checking or savings
accounts that maintain a $500 bal-

ance, and if you fall below the $500
minimum, no matter how many times
in one month, we only charge $3 for
the entire month."
"Essentially, if a minimum balance
is kept, there are no fees, unlimited
checking and free quarterly checks,"
she said.
Another benefit is the deposit of
University paychecks directly into
checking accounts the day before
payday. "This way, you simply
receive the check stub of how much
went into your credit union account,
and if you're on vacation or some
thing, you'll know your money is
safely deposited, not just sitting

around in a drawer," Gonzalez said.
For the first time ever, the credit
union will also be offering automated
teller machine cards for all members.
"There is an ATM machine
in Tresidder, located right next
to the Wells Fargo and Bank of
America machines. However, there
are many other locations that have
recently joined our instant-teller net
work. For example, many Safeway
stores, American Express and First
Interstate offices will allow a Credit
Union member to withdraw cash on
the spot," Gonzalez said.
She added, "1 have [more than] 45
pages of listings for our instant tel
lers."
Another service the credit union
offers is eligibility to join the Price
Club in Redwood City, a wholesale
outlet that sells everything from
electronic instruments, such as
stereos and video cassette recorders,
to groceries at greatly reduced prices.
The credit union was chartered in
December 1959 by the National
Credit Union Association. The union
currently has $40 million in assets
and accounts are insured to
$ 100,000, similar to other banks and
savings and loans, according to credit
union officials.
"It is a cooperative, essentially,"
Dawes said. "People put money in,
we manage it and loan it back to
others. The main difference between
us and a bank is that all our earnings
go back to members in the form of
dividends or lower loan rates."
Gonzalez indicated that she has
planned different kinds of marketing
procedures aimed toward students
before they return to campus next
fall. "We want to let them know
about our expanded services, and to
let them know that Wells Fargo is no
longer the only option for on-campus
financial services." The new mem
bership rules allow all Stanford stu
dents to join the union, whereas in

the past only about 50 percent of
them were eligible, Dawes said. He
said he hopes the new rules will
translate into increased membership
in the fall, he added.
Jeff Wolfe, customer service
manager for Wells Fargo branch at
Tresidder, said he "hadn't heard of
the changes" in the credit union
services, but that he didn't feel the
changes "would significantly affect"
Wells Fargo.

"Most customers bank with us be
cause of our .name and the Wells
Fargo system. We might lose some
accounts, but 1 don't see that the
majority of our customers will leave,"
Wolfe said.
Upon joining the credit union,
people are considered members for as
long as their account remains open.
"It doesn't matter if you graduate or
leave the area," Gonzalez said.
"Once a member, always a member."

safely deposited, not just sitting

around in a drawer," Gonzalez said.
For the first time ever, the credit
union will also be offering automated
teller machine cards for all members.
"There is an ATM machine
in Tresidder, located right next
to the Wells Fargo and Bank of
America machines. However, there
are many other locations that have
recently joined our instant-teller net
work. For example, many Safeway
stores, American Express and First
Interstate offices will allow a Credit
Union member to withdraw cash on
the spot," Gonzalez said.
She added, "1 have [more than] 45
pages of listings for our instant tel
lers."
Another service the credit union
offers is eligibility to join the Price
Club in Redwood City, a wholesale
outlet that sells everything from
electronic instruments, such as
stereos and video cassette recorders,
to groceries at greatly reduced prices.
The credit union was chartered in
December 1959 by the National
Credit Union Association. The union
currently has $40 million in assets
and accounts are insured to
$ 100,000, similar to other banks and
savings and loans, according to credit
union officials.
"It is a cooperative, essentially,"
Dawes said. "People put money in,
we manage it and loan it back to
others. The main difference between
us and a bank is that all our earnings
go back to members in the form of
dividends or lower loan rates."
Gonzalez indicated that she has
planned different kinds of marketing
procedures aimed toward students
before they return to campus next
fall. "We want to let them know
about our expanded services, and to
let them know that Wells Fargo is no
longer the only option for on-campus
financial services." The new mem
bership rules allow all Stanford stu
dents to join the union, whereas in

the past only about 50 percent of
them were eligible, Dawes said. He
said he hopes the new rules will
translate into increased membership
in the fall, he added.
Jeff Wolfe, customer service
manager for Wells Fargo branch at
Tresidder, said he "hadn't heard of
the changes" in the credit union
services, but that he didn't feel the
changes "would significantly affect"
Wells Fargo.

"Most customers bank with us be
cause of our .name and the Wells
Fargo system. We might lose some
accounts, but 1 don't see that the
majority of our customers will leave,"
Wolfe said.
Upon joining the credit union,
people are considered members for as
long as their account remains open.
"It doesn't matter if you graduate or
leave the area," Gonzalez said.
"Once a member, always a member."

Charles Dawes, president of the Stanford Federal Credit Union, stands
beside one of the tools of his trade — an automated teller machine at
Tresidder Union. The credit union recently expanded its operations to
include all University students and staff members.
For the first time in history, all
Stanford students and members of
the alumni association are able to
join the Stanford Federal Credit
Union. Previously, only those on the
University payroll were eligible for
credit union loans and allowed to
hold accounts.
The Credit Union Board of Direc
tors recently amended its bylaws to
include "undergraduate, graduate
and post-graduate students enrolled
in the Palo Alto campus of Stanford
University" as members, according to
Adele Gonzalez, vice president of
marketing for the credit union.
In the Dec. 26, 1984 meeting, the
directors also approved an amend
ment that makes loans available for
purchasing microcomputers ordered
through the University Microdisc
program or directly from other ven
dors.
Normal credit procedures will ap
ply to the loans, although students
,who do not meet credit guidelines
may still qualify with a parent as a
cosigner, said Gonzalez.
"Membership will give students the
chance to apply for a Visa card, a
computer loan, even a car loan if they
wish," Gonzalez said. "People are
still asking what a credit union is, how
it is different from a bank and what it
will do for them, but it is basically
very similar to a bank."
Credit unions offer the same
services as banks do, "only at much
better rates," according to Gonzalez.
Charles Dawes, credit union pres
ident, explained that "a couple of
years ago the credit union had some
problems, but we've tried not to dwell
on them. What counts is that we came
out of them, and we're offering many
new services," he said.
Fast-Tel, a system that allows
home banking via telephone, is one
such new service.

According to Dawes, people can
dial their account to check their bal
ance, transfer funds or just check to
see if and when a check has cleared.
Fast-Tel has already received more
than 3,000 calls a month.
To join the union, one must pay an
initial $5 membership fee and deposit
a minimum of $50 into a checking or
savings account.
"Our rates are very, very good,"
Gonzalez said. "First of all, we pay
interest on any checking or savings
accounts that maintain a $500 bal-

ance, and if you fall below the $500
minimum, no matter how many times
in one month, we only charge $3 for
the entire month."
"Essentially, if a minimum balance
is kept, there are no fees, unlimited
checking and free quarterly checks,"
she said.
Another benefit is the deposit of
University paychecks directly into
checking accounts the day before
payday. "This way, you simply
receive the check stub of how much
went into your credit union account,
and if you're on vacation or some
thing, you'll know your money is
safely deposited, not just sitting

around in a drawer," Gonzalez said.
