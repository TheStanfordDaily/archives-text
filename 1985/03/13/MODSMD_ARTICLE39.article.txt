# UNICEF director to open spring hunger conference
## 
### BARBARA SCHULER Staff writer 
A coalition of Stanford students
and campus political organizations
has chosen James Grant, executive
director of UNICEF, as the keynote
speaker for the spring quarter hunger
conference to begin April 8.
Grant was the "first choice" not
only because "he's reputed to be an
excellent speaker," but also because
UNICEF (the United Nations Inter
national Children's Emergency Fund)
"is one of the best-known multi
lateral relief organizations," accord
ing to Sarah von der Lippe, director
of the conference.
Von der Lippe said, "Because most
people feel the issue of hunger and
famine is much more poignant when
they are looking at pictures of
children," it is an "ideal shoot-off
point for a first-time conference" and
"a good area to start coalition
building."
Another reason conference or
ganizers chose to put Grant in the
spotlight is UNICEFs multilateral
status. "It's not just U.S. aid, which
can get very political," von der Lippe
said.
The week-long conference, "You
Can Make a Difference 1985: World
and Local Hunger," will run from
April 8-13, and will include more
than 40 speakers from both private
and governmental aid organizations,
as well as several prominent
politicians, educators and authors.
Included in the present line-up are

Rep. Leon Panetta (D-Monterey),
AFTRICARE Executive Director C.
Payne Lucas and Dr. J. Larry Brown,
head of the Physicians' Task Force on
Hunger and a faculty member at the
Harvard School of Public Health.
University President Donald Ken
nedy and Walter Falcon, director of
the Food Research Institute, will be
among the participants from Stan
ford.
Senator Edward Kennedy (D-
Mass.) and the Rev. Jesse Jackson
have yet to accept their invitations,
according to von der Lippe. Regard
ing their appearances, she said, "I'm
hopeful about it. It would be fantastic
if it could happen."
Carolyn Del Gaudio, assistant
director of the conference, said she is
concerned about a focus on big
names. "I'd like to see the real sub
stance and spirit of the conference
come together. It has great potential.
I think what's most important is that
we emphasize the content and not
just talk about the important
speakers who are coming," she said.
In addition to a wide range of
speakers, organizers have also
planned a "Hunger Fair," modeled
after the annual career fair, at which
representatives of local, national and
international relief organizations will
set up tables with information on how
interested students can get involved.
There will also be an exhibit of po
litical cartoons highlighting the
hunger issue and a symposium on
"The Multi-National Corporation

and Poverty" held at the Graduate
School of Business.
Catherine Milton, special assistant
to University President Donald Ken
nedy for public service, said, "I think
we've pulled together some of the
most knowledgeable people in the
whole world to come in and speak.
It's going to be the biggest event of its
kind in the country."
Funded by contributions from
more than 30 campus groups, includ
ing the Stanford Volunteer Network,
Barrio Assistance and the Delta
Foundation (of Delta Sigma Theta
sorority), the conference received a
real boon on Feb. 26 when the
ASSU approved funding from the
Guest Professorship Board (GPB) for
at least five of the week's speakers.
Currently $3,000 short of their
total budget, conference organizers
have already raised $17,000. Accord
ing to Nathan Brostrom, a member of
the student committee working on
fundraising, a $2,000 proposal to the
California Humanities Council
"looks pretty promising." Other re
quests have been made of the Office
of the Dean of Student Affairs and to
the Dean of Humanities and
Sciences.
According to von der Lippe, "the
whole process of planning the confer
ence has been a real educational ex
perience for all of us. ... I would
think that it must be very satisfying
for the faculty, staff and administra
tion to see a need for education arise
from the student community â– "
