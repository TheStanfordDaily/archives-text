# Board defers Law Student Center
## 
### BOB COHN Senior staff writer 
The Stanford Board of Trustees
deferred a decision on the Law Stu
dent Center yesterday but approved
four other campus construction and
renovation projects, including the
design for a four-story computer cen
ter on a plot of grass near Meyer Li
brary.
Trustees also passed an assistance
program that should make it easier
for Stanford faculty to buy homes in
the high-priced Stanford-Palo Alto
area, and accepted the University's
proposed $270 million operating
budget for 1985-86, a 9.5 percent in
crease over this fiscal year.
Two trustee committees considered
design and project approval for the
proposed Law Student Center, a one
story building that would be located
in the courtyard between Crothers
Hall and Crothers Memorial Hall.
The building would include a com
mon room and a fitness area. After
questions were raised concerning the
facility's design and usefulness, board
members agreed to postpone action
on the issue until a later meeting.
That decision was influenced in
part by the dissatisfaction that some
Cro Mem residents have expressed
with the project. In a March 1 letter
to board members, the president and
resident assistant of that dorm said
the proposed site for the facility is
"unacceptable" because it robs stu
dents of valuable courtyard space.
According to Cro Mem President
Nelson Tamplin. residents — the
majority of whom are graduate stu
dents in engineering — responded 2-
to-1 against the project in a survey.
Barbara Dray, associate dean of
the law school for development and
alumni contacts, countered that law

students living in Crothers have dem
onstrated a need for the facility. She
remains optimistic despite the board's
postponement.
"I don't get the impression we're
talking life and death here — that the
whole thing should he scrapped,"
Dray said.
Dray said the anonymous donor
who agreed to put up $1 million to
"make life better for law students" is
convinced that a center like the one
proposed would be the best use of
that money.
The trustees did approve the design
of an $8.75 million computer center,
as well as smaller construction and
renovation projects for the Knoll, the
Human Anatomy Program and the
Stanford Shopping Center.
The Academic Resources Center
will be the base for two computer sys
tems — Low Overhead Time Sharing
(LOTS) and the Instructional and
Research Information Systems
(IRIS) — and will house five existing
academic service programs: the Un
dergraduate Advising Center, Under
graduate Research Opportunities,
Stanford Overseas Studies, the Cen
ter for Teaching and Learning and
the Extradepartmental Education
Center.
According to the trustees agenda,
"This center is envisaged as a magnet
— students will be attracted by the
services of a particular program, yet
once inside the building they will dis
cover many valuable opportunities
nearby."
The four-story, L-shaped structure
will be located in the center of
campus on a small plot of land be
tween Meyer Library, Stern Hall and
the Center for Educational Research
at Stanford (CERAS). Construction
is scheduled to beein in May, with

completion a year later.
Trustees approved $1.2 million to
refurbish the Knoll, former home of
the Music Department and future site
for the Center for Computer Re
search in Music and Acoustics, a
renowned facility currently located
on Arastradero Road.
Beyond construction, the board
agreed to a down payment assistance
program designed to attract faculty
who arc considering Stanford but are
deterred by the cost of housing. The
program, which will supplement an
existing housing aid plan, will lend
potential homeowners up to half the

down payment, an amount that banks
usually require in cash.
"This is the highest-priced housing
market in the country, and it's the
highest-priced by far among our com
petitors," said Robin Hamill, project
coordinator. "We have a very diffi
cult time attracting faculty because of
these high prices."
Hamill said the average house in
this area costs $300,000, and most
banks require a 20 percent down pay
ment, plus special fees.
"Most faculty members don't have
$66,000 in cash," she said.

facility's design and usefulness, board
members agreed to postpone action
on the issue until a later meeting.
That decision was influenced in
part by the dissatisfaction that some
Cro Mem residents have expressed
with the project. In a March 1 letter
to board members, the president and
resident assistant of that dorm said
the proposed site for the facility is
"unacceptable" because it robs stu
dents of valuable courtyard space.
According to Cro Mem President
Nelson Tamplin. residents — the
majority of whom are graduate stu
dents in engineering — responded 2-
to-1 against the project in a survey.
Barbara Dray, associate dean of
the law school for development and
alumni contacts, countered that law

students living in Crothers have dem
onstrated a need for the facility. She
remains optimistic despite the board's
postponement.
"I don't get the impression we're
talking life and death here — that the
whole thing should he scrapped,"
Dray said.
Dray said the anonymous donor
who agreed to put up $1 million to
"make life better for law students" is
convinced that a center like the one
proposed would be the best use of
that money.
The trustees did approve the design
of an $8.75 million computer center,
as well as smaller construction and
renovation projects for the Knoll, the
Human Anatomy Program and the
Stanford Shopping Center.
The Academic Resources Center
will be the base for two computer sys
tems — Low Overhead Time Sharing
(LOTS) and the Instructional and
Research Information Systems
(IRIS) — and will house five existing
academic service programs: the Un
dergraduate Advising Center, Under
graduate Research Opportunities,
Stanford Overseas Studies, the Cen
ter for Teaching and Learning and
the Extradepartmental Education
Center.
According to the trustees agenda,
"This center is envisaged as a magnet
— students will be attracted by the
services of a particular program, yet
once inside the building they will dis
cover many valuable opportunities
nearby."
The four-story, L-shaped structure
will be located in the center of
campus on a small plot of land be
tween Meyer Library, Stern Hall and
the Center for Educational Research
at Stanford (CERAS). Construction
is scheduled to beein in May, with

completion a year later.
Trustees approved $1.2 million to
refurbish the Knoll, former home of
the Music Department and future site
for the Center for Computer Re
search in Music and Acoustics, a
renowned facility currently located
on Arastradero Road.
Beyond construction, the board
agreed to a down payment assistance
program designed to attract faculty
who arc considering Stanford but are
deterred by the cost of housing. The
program, which will supplement an
existing housing aid plan, will lend
potential homeowners up to half the

down payment, an amount that banks
usually require in cash.
"This is the highest-priced housing
market in the country, and it's the
highest-priced by far among our com
petitors," said Robin Hamill, project
coordinator. "We have a very diffi
cult time attracting faculty because of
these high prices."
Hamill said the average house in
this area costs $300,000, and most
banks require a 20 percent down pay
ment, plus special fees.
"Most faculty members don't have
$66,000 in cash," she said.
