# Stanford works to save aid
## Lobbying campaign launched here and in Washington 
### TODD RAMMING Staff writer 
The University has launched an
intense lobbying effort here and in
Washington to protect the more
than $8.6 billion in federal funds
for student financial aid that the
Reagan administration has
threatened to cut in its recent
budget proposals.
Stanford officials — including
Vice President Robert Freelen
and Assoc. Vice President Larry
Horton, both from the Office of
Public Affairs, and Tom Mcßride,
associate dean of the law school —
have been at the forefront of the
fight to protect government funds
for direct student grants and to
subsidize the interest on student
loans. The three have lobbied in
Washington, circulated letters and
testified at hearings in their ef
forts.
After a series of votes last week,
the Senate Budget Committee
continues to work on budget
proposals that would satisfy the
demands of President Reagan and
yet avoid undermining the finan
cial foundation of necessary insti
tutions.
After advising the Stanford
Board of Trustees yesterday
morning to "be helpful" toward
protecting federally funded stu
dent aid, University President
Donald Kennedy is bound for Los
Angeles, where he will address ap

proximately 800 alumni Saturday
on the need to protect the finan
cial soundness of higher educa
tion, Freelen said.
Kennedy also serves as chair
man of the board for the Consor
tium on Financing Higher Educa
tion, a research and lobby group
that includes more than 30 private
educational institutions.
In an effort to reduce the
projected 1986 deficit by $60 bil
lion, the Reagan administration —
which has criticized student-aid
programs since 1981 — has pro
posed to cut more than $1 billion
from both the loan and grant pro
grams next year.
Groups at Stanford and
throughout the country are
gearing up for congressional ac
tion next year when the basic laws
governing college aid programs
come up for renewal. By incorpo
rating proposals for a shift in col
lege aid into the budget process,
the administration has taken "the
debate out of the hands of the
education committees, which gen
erally favor the aid programs, and
moved it into the budget and
finance committees, where the
education lobby has generally had
less influence," according to a
March 2 article in The New York
Times.
"I don't think that's a serious
disadvantage," Freelen said.

"Since 1981, we've had to work in
the budget committees and the ap
propriations committees," he said.
Although the education lobby en
joys no special place with the
budget committee, whose overrid
ing aim is to reduce the federal
deficit, "we're no more disad
vantaged than lots of people,"
Freelen said.
Taking the lead over the House
of Representatives, the Senate has
undertaken to establish its own
budget proposal. In 1974, the Sen
ate established an in-house law
that a budget must be passed. The
budget, however, is not of legal
necessity, and the Senate has, in a
number of years, failed to concur
on a plan.
On the other hand, 13 appropri
ations bills are necessary to keep
the government going. These are
the bills which actually control the
flow of federal money and which
must be signed by the president in
addition to passing both houses.
"If the Republicans (in the Sen
ate) can get a good budget, it will
put a lot of pressure on the presi
dent" when he must decide
whether to sign a given appropria
tions bill, said Carolyn Fulton,
legislative aide to Sen. Alan
Cranston (D-Calif.). The appropria
tions bills are supposed to be
passed by Sept. 30 for the govern
ment's fiscal year, which begins
Oct. 1, Fulton said.
