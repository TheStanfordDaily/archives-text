# No charges yet for attempted break-in
## 
### STEPHEN KASIERSKI Staff writer 
No criminal charges have been
filed yet against the 15-year-old
Homestead High School student
accused of trying to access a com
puter account maintained by Stan
ford's Information Technology
Services (ITS), according to Patricia
Vorreiter, the youth's attorney.
Doug Southard, Santa Clara
County district attorney in charge of
technical crime, said the case has
been transferred to the District At
torney's Juvenile Division. DA Boh
Masterson, now in charge of the case,
could not be reached for comment.
Vorreiter said she thinks the matter
should be dropped by the DA's of
fice.
"There has been no evidence
shown that my client made any
repeated efforts to break into that
system," she said.
"I hope that the district attorney
would review the circumstances and
deem it appropriate not to file any
criminal charges," Vorreiter said.
Despite the lack of criminal
charges against the hacker, the
Fremont Union School District's
school board formally expelled him
last week "for possession of a coun

terfeit master key which allowed him
to trespass in the school's office after
hours," the Homestead High newspa
per reported.
The hacker, who attended Home
stead High before being suspended
on Jan. 18, has not been identified
because of his age and refuses to
speak to any other media.
In addition, the hacker now claims
he made only 12 of the access at
tempts, according to articles in the
school's newspaper. Stanford Police
Investigator Ron Levine said last
month that 183 attempts to access the
system were made from Jan. 3 to Jan.
29.
The hacker has revealed his side of
the story to reporters Pat Farley and
Bob Korn of the high school's news
paper.
The hacker told Korn he was called
into an assistant principal's office on
Jan. 18 when another student who
was caught with a master key re
ported that the hacker also had a
copy.
He used his master key on Friday,
Jan. 1 1, to enter a school office to use
a copy machine, the hacker said.
While there, he found what appeared
to be the correct password to access
the school's ITS account.

He admitted to using his own home
computer later that evening to make
about 12 unsuccessful log-on at
tempts, but insisted those were the
only calls he made to the Stanford
computer.
On Monday, Jan. 14, the hacker
again used his key to use the office
copy machine, and there found what
he.believed was the correct eight
digit password, he told Korn.
The next day he talked with a
friend about the Stanford computer.
The hacker said his friend made all
the access attempts that began that
Tuesday evening.
Dennis Green, a computer lab
technician at the high school, told
Korn he overheard the hacker's
friend talking about getting into the
Stanford computer on Wednesday,
Jan. 17. Green was told the next day
that Stanford officials were aware of
the hacking attempts, and Green told
the hacker to tell his friend to "cool
it." That evening, the hacking at
tempts stopped.
The hacker also told Korn his
friend came to school the next day
with seven letters written on his hand
and asked if that was the correct pass
word. Later that day, an assistant
principal called the accused hacker

into the office and he recited this
story.
Dudley McFadden, a student lab
technician in the Homestead High
computer department, substantiates
the hacker's charge that another stu
dent was involved. Long before the
incidents went public, the hacker told
McFadden of his friend's attempts to
illegally access Stanford's computer,
McFadden told The Daily.
The hacker told reporter Farley
that he regretted his actions.
"Up to the point of entering the of
fice, everything 1 did was justified."
he said. "When 1 did go into the of
fice, I felt I was seriously doing
wrong. 1 deserve what I have com
ing."
"I'm a programmer, not a hacker,"
he said. "I'm only one person. I really
wasn't a threat."
The hacker also told Farley he
couldn't believe "the administration
will turn its back on teachers' loaning
students keys and pretend not to see
(it), [ and] . . . when it came into the
light, then they go by the book."
"I've learned a few things from get
ting caught," he said. "First of all, I
don't think honesty is always the best
policy anymore.

No criminal charges have been
filed yet against the 15-year-old
Homestead High School student
accused of trying to access a com
puter account maintained by Stan
ford's Information Technology
Services (ITS), according to Patricia
Vorreiter, the youth's attorney.
Doug Southard, Santa Clara
County district attorney in charge of
technical crime, said the case has
been transferred to the District At
torney's Juvenile Division. DA Boh
Masterson, now in charge of the case,
could not be reached for comment.
Vorreiter said she thinks the matter
should be dropped by the DA's of
fice.
"There has been no evidence
shown that my client made any
repeated efforts to break into that
system," she said.
"I hope that the district attorney
would review the circumstances and
deem it appropriate not to file any
criminal charges," Vorreiter said.
Despite the lack of criminal
charges against the hacker, the
Fremont Union School District's
school board formally expelled him
last week "for possession of a coun

terfeit master key which allowed him
to trespass in the school's office after
hours," the Homestead High newspa
per reported.
The hacker, who attended Home
stead High before being suspended
on Jan. 18, has not been identified
because of his age and refuses to
speak to any other media.
In addition, the hacker now claims
he made only 12 of the access at
tempts, according to articles in the
school's newspaper. Stanford Police
Investigator Ron Levine said last
month that 183 attempts to access the
system were made from Jan. 3 to Jan.
29.
The hacker has revealed his side of
the story to reporters Pat Farley and
Bob Korn of the high school's news
paper.
The hacker told Korn he was called
into an assistant principal's office on
Jan. 18 when another student who
was caught with a master key re
ported that the hacker also had a
copy.
He used his master key on Friday,
Jan. 1 1, to enter a school office to use
a copy machine, the hacker said.
While there, he found what appeared
to be the correct password to access
the school's ITS account.

He admitted to using his own home
computer later that evening to make
about 12 unsuccessful log-on at
tempts, but insisted those were the
only calls he made to the Stanford
computer.
On Monday, Jan. 14, the hacker
again used his key to use the office
copy machine, and there found what
he.believed was the correct eight
digit password, he told Korn.
The next day he talked with a
friend about the Stanford computer.
The hacker said his friend made all
the access attempts that began that
Tuesday evening.
Dennis Green, a computer lab
technician at the high school, told
Korn he overheard the hacker's
friend talking about getting into the
Stanford computer on Wednesday,
Jan. 17. Green was told the next day
that Stanford officials were aware of
the hacking attempts, and Green told
the hacker to tell his friend to "cool
it." That evening, the hacking at
tempts stopped.
The hacker also told Korn his
friend came to school the next day
with seven letters written on his hand
and asked if that was the correct pass
word. Later that day, an assistant
principal called the accused hacker

into the office and he recited this
story.
Dudley McFadden, a student lab
technician in the Homestead High
computer department, substantiates
the hacker's charge that another stu
dent was involved. Long before the
incidents went public, the hacker told
McFadden of his friend's attempts to
illegally access Stanford's computer,
McFadden told The Daily.
The hacker told reporter Farley
that he regretted his actions.
"Up to the point of entering the of
fice, everything 1 did was justified."
he said. "When 1 did go into the of
fice, I felt I was seriously doing
wrong. 1 deserve what I have com
ing."
"I'm a programmer, not a hacker,"
he said. "I'm only one person. I really
wasn't a threat."
The hacker also told Farley he
couldn't believe "the administration
will turn its back on teachers' loaning
students keys and pretend not to see
(it), [ and] . . . when it came into the
light, then they go by the book."
"I've learned a few things from get
ting caught," he said. "First of all, I
don't think honesty is always the best
policy anymore.
