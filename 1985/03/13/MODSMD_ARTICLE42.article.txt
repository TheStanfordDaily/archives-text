# Med Center researchers feel grant cuts

### LYNN MARCUS Staff writer 
Researchers at the Stanford Medical Center may
already be starting to feel the effects of tougher
policies on grant awards which have been adopted
by the Reagan administration this year, according
to Fred Bentley, the associate director of sponsored
projects at the medical center.
Funding awarded to medical center faculty for
sponsored research by the National Institutes of
Health dropped nearly 30 percent the first five
months of this fiscal year compared with the same
period in fiscal 1983-84. Figures covering Septem
ber through January of both fiscal years show an
overall decline in funding awards from $63.3 mil
lion to $55.5 million and a drop in NIH funding
from $24.9 million to $17.8 million.
"The HHS (Health and Human Services)/NIH
decrease is consistent with the policy decisions
being made in Washington," Bentley said. "The
Office of Management and Budget has undone
what Congress intended."
Congress had appropriated funds for 6,500 re
search grants by the NIH, but policy makers at the
OMB issued a directive in late December which set

a 5,000-grant limit for this fiscal year. The remain
ing 1,500 are to be awarded over the next few
years.
The decision was a cost-cutting measure which
Reagan administration officials estimate will save
$280 million this year and the same amount or
more in each of the next two years. The policy has
provoked criticism from medical school administra
tors throughout the country.
Medical School Dean David Korn contends that
the policy bypasses congressional intent and under
cuts medical research efforts at a time when re
searchers are making important breakthroughs.
Bentley said the administration's new NIH
policy, which he called "certainly unexpected and
certainly unfair," m|jy not have a significant effect
011 overall research efforts at the medical center but
may have a negative impact on younger faculty
members.
He explained that while researchers conducting
ongoing projects have been awarded money for
grants extending over a period of several years, re
searchers seeking awards for new projects will have
a harder time obtaining funds.
The OMB directive, besides drawing harsh

criticism by faculty members and administrators at
the medical center, has prompted officials there to
begin an assessment of the current and potential ef
fects of the cuts on Stanford and to launch a letter
writing campaign in an attempt to counter the
directive.
"It (the directive) has far-reaching effects and
we're working hard to try to turn it around," said
Pamela Perkins, administrative assistant to the vice
president of medical affairs.
The Dean's Office at the medical center, which is
coordinating the letter-writing campaign, is urging
faculty members to write members of Congress in
support of a resolution sponsored by Rep. Henry
Waxman (D-Los Angeles) that would override the
PMB directive.
The decline in government funding this fiscal
year comes on the heels of what Elwood Pierce,
director of operations at the medical school, called
an "absolutely great, tremendous" season of
awards for sponsored projects.
Stanford medical researchers received grants and
contracts totalling $80.9 million in fiscal 1983-84, a
rise of 14 percent from the previous year. NIH sup
port accounted for $66 million of those funds.
