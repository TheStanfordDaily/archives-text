# Cardinal will battle Florida at NCAAs
## 
### INGRID SEYER Staff sportswriter 
Stanford Men's Swimming Coach Skip
Kenney may have four Pacific 10 Conference
title trophies in his office, but he would trade
them ail in for one NCAA Championship
trophy. This year, on the strength of his No.
1-ranked swimming corps, Kenney might be
able to bring that elusive NCAA trophy home
without having to make a trade.
The Cardinal, third at last year's NCAAs
and this year's Pac-10 champion, will travel to
Austin, Texas, March 28-31 to compete in the
NCAA Championships. Although Stanford
was ranked No. 1 nationally following the
dual-meet season, Kenney feels that Florida,
the defending champion, is the favorite to win
the title.
"1 think everyone will agree that Florida is
the all-around favorite to win the NCAAs,
but that doesn't mean we don't have a chance
at the title, too," Kenney said. "Stanford and
Texas will both be battling Florida for first
place and California shouldn't be far behind."
Florida won the Southeast Conference title
this weekend while Texas took home the
Southwest Conference trophy. Because Texas
will have the home-pool advantage, Kenney
thinks the Longhorns' chances of victory are a
little stronger than usual.
"Texas has only won the NCAAs once and
that was when it swam at home," Kenney
said. "The advantage of 3,000 screaming
Longhorn fans is certainly not one to be over
looked."
According to Kenney, Stanford has three

priorities heading into the meet.
"Our first priority is to swim well," Kenney
said. "If we do that, we can be proud of our
selves and our efforts.
"Our second priority is to have some other
school counter Florida's points in the freestyle
events, because we just don't have anybody
that can dominate Florida in those events.
"Our final goal is to have some Stanford
swimmers step up and do something unex
pected for us. In order for us to win the
NCAAs, we are going to need some very spe
cial athletes, the kind that can go above and
beyond what they ever expected they can do.
We have those kind of athletes on our team
and we will be looking for them to really show
their stuff."
As Kenney said, the freestyle events are the
Cardinal's biggest worry. Florida fields the
strongest freestyle corps in the nation and
could easily dominate the individual and relay
freestyle events.
"In order for us to win the championships,
we are going to have to get some really heroic
swims from our men, especially in the
freestyle relays," Kenney said. "The relays
count for double the points of an individual
event, so if we place low in the relays, we can
really fall behind."
Stanford has qualified 13 swimmers in 32
individual events. Senior Dave Bottom has
qualified in four events (100- and 200-yard
backstroke, 100-yard butterfly and 200-yard
individual medley), and David Lundberg, Jeff
Kostoff, John Moffet, Pablo Morales and

Matt Nance have qualified in three events
each.
Ricky Bodor, Mike Conaton, David
Louden, Anthony Mosse, Sean Murphy and
Mike Reynolds have qualified in two events
and John Denney has qualified in one.
Here are Kenney's predictions for each of
the swimming events in the NCAA finals.
• 50-yard freestyle: UCLA's Tom Jager is the
favorite to win the event. Stanford did not
qualify anyone.
• 100-yard freestyle: Jager, the event's
defending champion, is favored to win this
one, but "Matt Biondi of California will be
the guy to beat," Kenney said.
• 200-yard freestyle: Florida's Mike Heath
swam a 1:34.09 in his conference champion
ships and holds the second fastest time ever in
the event, but Biondi also has a strong shot at
winning it.
• 500-yard freestyle: Mike O'Brien of USC
has a good chance of taking this one, though
Arizona's George DeCarlo should be a solid
contender. Stanford's Kostoff will also be in
the thick of this event if he is feeling good.
The sophomore has been bothered by a throat
infection for much of the season.
• 1,650-yard freestyle: Kostoff is the defend
ing champion in this event and has a very
good chance of claiming the title once again.
Matt Setlinsky of Florida currently holds the
nation's fastest time in the event, but should
also be challenged by O'Brien.
• 100-yard butterfly: Stanford's Morales

should take this event hands down.
• 200-yard butterfly: Florida's Heath
has the nation's top time in the event
(1:43.09), but Morales (1:46.06) has
not yet swum the event with hK legs
shaved.
• 100-yard backstroke: Stanford's
Bottom has a very good chance of
winning the event.
• 200-yard backstroke — Stanford's
Bottom and Murphy will probably
battle it out for the victory.
• 200-yard breaststroke: Stanford's
Moffet holds the national-best time in
this event and should take home the
title easily.
• 100-yard breaststroke: Moffet also
holds the nation's No. 1 time in this
event.
• 200-yard individual medley:
Florida's Paul Wallace holds the
national-best time in this event but
"whoever wins this race will have to
beat Pablo Morales first."
• 400-yard individual medley: Stan
ford's Kostoff is highly favored here.

qualified in four events (100- and 200-yard
backstroke, 100-yard butterfly and 200-yard
individual medley), and David Lundberg, Jeff
Kostoff, John Moffet, Pablo Morales and

Matt Nance have qualified in three events
each.
Ricky Bodor, Mike Conaton, David
Louden, Anthony Mosse, Sean Murphy and
Mike Reynolds have qualified in two events
and John Denney has qualified in one.
Here are Kenney's predictions for each of
the swimming events in the NCAA finals.
• 50-yard freestyle: UCLA's Tom Jager is the
favorite to win the event. Stanford did not
qualify anyone.
• 100-yard freestyle: Jager, the event's
defending champion, is favored to win this
one, but "Matt Biondi of California will be
the guy to beat," Kenney said.
• 200-yard freestyle: Florida's Mike Heath
swam a 1:34.09 in his conference champion
ships and holds the second fastest time ever in
the event, but Biondi also has a strong shot at
winning it.
• 500-yard freestyle: Mike O'Brien of USC
has a good chance of taking this one, though
Arizona's George DeCarlo should be a solid
contender. Stanford's Kostoff will also be in
the thick of this event if he is feeling good.
The sophomore has been bothered by a throat
infection for much of the season.
• 1,650-yard freestyle: Kostoff is the defend
ing champion in this event and has a very
good chance of claiming the title once again.
Matt Setlinsky of Florida currently holds the
nation's fastest time in the event, but should
also be challenged by O'Brien.
• 100-yard butterfly: Stanford's Morales

should take this event hands down.
• 200-yard butterfly: Florida's Heath
has the nation's top time in the event
(1:43.09), but Morales (1:46.06) has
not yet swum the event with hK legs
shaved.
• 100-yard backstroke: Stanford's
Bottom has a very good chance of
winning the event.
• 200-yard backstroke — Stanford's
Bottom and Murphy will probably
battle it out for the victory.
• 200-yard breaststroke: Stanford's
Moffet holds the national-best time in
this event and should take home the
title easily.
• 100-yard breaststroke: Moffet also
holds the nation's No. 1 time in this
event.
• 200-yard individual medley:
Florida's Paul Wallace holds the
national-best time in this event but
"whoever wins this race will have to
beat Pablo Morales first."
• 400-yard individual medley: Stan
ford's Kostoff is highly favored here.
Stanford Men's Swimming Coach Skip
Kenney may have four Pacific 10 Conference
title trophies in his office, but he would trade
them ail in for one NCAA Championship
trophy. This year, on the strength of his No.
1-ranked swimming corps, Kenney might be
able to bring that elusive NCAA trophy home
without having to make a trade.
The Cardinal, third at last year's NCAAs
and this year's Pac-10 champion, will travel to
Austin, Texas, March 28-31 to compete in the
NCAA Championships. Although Stanford
was ranked No. 1 nationally following the
dual-meet season, Kenney feels that Florida,
the defending champion, is the favorite to win
the title.
"1 think everyone will agree that Florida is
the all-around favorite to win the NCAAs,
but that doesn't mean we don't have a chance
at the title, too," Kenney said. "Stanford and
Texas will both be battling Florida for first
place and California shouldn't be far behind."
Florida won the Southeast Conference title
this weekend while Texas took home the
Southwest Conference trophy. Because Texas
will have the home-pool advantage, Kenney
thinks the Longhorns' chances of victory are a
little stronger than usual.
"Texas has only won the NCAAs once and
that was when it swam at home," Kenney
said. "The advantage of 3,000 screaming
Longhorn fans is certainly not one to be over
looked."
According to Kenney, Stanford has three

priorities heading into the meet.
"Our first priority is to swim well," Kenney
said. "If we do that, we can be proud of our
selves and our efforts.
"Our second priority is to have some other
school counter Florida's points in the freestyle
events, because we just don't have anybody
that can dominate Florida in those events.
"Our final goal is to have some Stanford
swimmers step up and do something unex
pected for us. In order for us to win the
NCAAs, we are going to need some very spe
cial athletes, the kind that can go above and
beyond what they ever expected they can do.
We have those kind of athletes on our team
and we will be looking for them to really show
their stuff."
As Kenney said, the freestyle events are the
Cardinal's biggest worry. Florida fields the
strongest freestyle corps in the nation and
could easily dominate the individual and relay
freestyle events.
"In order for us to win the championships,
we are going to have to get some really heroic
swims from our men, especially in the
freestyle relays," Kenney said. "The relays
count for double the points of an individual
event, so if we place low in the relays, we can
really fall behind."
Stanford has qualified 13 swimmers in 32
individual events. Senior Dave Bottom has
qualified in four events (100- and 200-yard
backstroke, 100-yard butterfly and 200-yard
individual medley), and David Lundberg, Jeff
Kostoff, John Moffet, Pablo Morales and

Matt Nance have qualified in three events
