# Five form Pac West Conference
## 
### JOHN LIS Editorial staff 
Stanford's women's athletics have suf
fered from an identity problem. At a
school that is associated with the Pacific 10
Conference, the women's teams have been
a part of the Western Collegiate Athletic
Association, an eight-team league
composed of five Pac-10 schools —
UCLA, USC, Arizona, Arizona State and
Stanford — and three others — San Diego
State, Long Beach State and Fullerton
State.
The WCAA is regarded as one of the
top overall conferences in women's ath
letics, but will be dissolved at the end of
this year. The five Pac-10 schools will be
forming a new league — the Pacific West
Athletic Conference. The three other
schools will join the Pacific Coast Athletic
Association.
"I think this is a move toward a Pac-10
for women's athletics," Stanford Athletic
Director Andy Geiger said. "That's some
thing that this university has advocated for
a long time.
"There's been a lot of conversation in
the Pac-10 about placing our athletic pro
grams under one umbrella. It's long been
our policy here to have one authority for
all our intercollegiate athletic programs."
The move into the Pac West is widely re
garded as a prelude to a Pac-10 for
women's sports. The women's programs of
the other five teams in the Pac-10 — Cali
fornia, Washington, Washington State.
Oregon and Oregon State — are in the
Northern Pacific Athletic Conference with
San Jose State and Fresno State.
Currently, women's teams in basketball,
swimming, tennis, volleyball, track, gym
nastics and golf are in the WCAA.
The official formation of the Pac West
took place on May 9. 1984, when the five
schools informed the WCAA of their in

tention. Most conferences require one
year's notice when a school leaves because
schedules are made a year in advance, so
the live schools are competing in the
WCAA this year.
"The time appeared to be right," Stan
ford Assoc. Athletic Director Pam Strat
hairn said. "The notion of having women's
sports programs in the Pac-10 — or
whatever it was called back then — goes
back to the mid '505."
Prior to joining the WCAA for the
1982-83 year, Stanford had been a part of
the Northern California Athletic Confer
ence, basically the NorPac without the
Washington and Oregon schools and in
cluding the University of San Francisco
and Santa Clara.
It is believed that California will join the
Pac West in 1986, making the league the
equivalent of the Pacific 10 Southern Divi
sion. The so-called Six-Pac is the league
that Stanford's men's tennis and baseball
teams compete in.
Luella Lilly, the director of women's
athletics at Cal, was noncommittal on this
possibility. "At this point, the best confer
ence for us is the one we're in," she said.
"We support the NorPac organization."
Asked about joining a full Pacific 10
Conference, Lilly said, "There isn't such a
thing. It's not an option. To go with the
Pac West — we've made our commitment.
There's always the possibility for discus
sion."
George Haines, the women's swimming
coach here, sees Cal joining the Pac West
in 1986, despite what Lilly said. "They feel
loyalty toward the NorPac," he said. "It
was a tough decision here, but we got the
coaches together and voted for it." Haines
also sees the Washington and Oregon
schools joining in 1987 to complete the
transformation to the Pac-10.
Sylvia Moore, the athletic director at

Oregon State, was open to the possibility,
although Oregon State is committed to the
NorPac through next year.
"We will be meeting with women's ad
ministrators in the next few weeks to dis
cuss the possibility of a Pac-10," Moore
said. "There's no possibility through 1985-
86. After that, we're going to have a
meeting and see what's possible.
"Obviously the Pac-10 will have input
on whether they want to have a conference
championship for women. As someone re
sponsible for both men's and women's pro
grams, it would alleviate some of our prob
lems.
"I don't have a strong stand on it either
way."
Officials at the three schools that were
left out in the formation of the Pac West
said they aren't upset about the move, al
though they said they feel it may have been
done hastily.
"They felt they had to do what they had
to do," said John Kasser, the athletic
director at Long Beach State. "I think it
was done in haste, but it was their
prerogative if they wanted to. We under
stand that if those schools felt it was best
for them, they had to do it.
"We have a very good situation. This
conference (the PCAA) is strong."
Leanne Grotke, the acting athletic
director at Fullerton State, said, "There
was not much advance notice. It came as a
surprise. I read that as having been taken
without a great amount of planning and
foresight.
"We're very pleased to be able to join
the PCAA. It will be a very competitive
conference for us. I think it's going to be a
strong conference."
Stanford players and coaches said they
are are also generally pleased by the move,
though reasons vary from sport to sport.
"I think it's going to be a positive

move," Tennis Coach Frank Brennan said.
"The WCAA was a good conference —
the problem with the league was that we
had to play Long Beach and Fullerton,
teams that I wouldn't schedule otherwise.
That means I've got to travel down there,
and that can get tricky."
Brennan said he doesn't see tennis going
to a full Pac 10 setup, citing the men's pro
gram that competes in the Six-Pac.
Sophomore Leigh Anne Eldredge also
said she thought the move was a good one
for the tennis program. "From what I've
heard, it sounds pretty good. It might cut
out some really weak matches, which
would be great. I don't see why we
shouldn't have the same setup as the
guys."
Haines said he thinks the Pac West will
be good for the swimming program, espe
cially if it becomes the Pac-10. "I think it's
going to be real good two or three years
from now (when the other schools are ex
pected to join)."
Haines said that Long Beach was the
only WCAA school with a swim team that
won't be in the Pac West, and Long Beach
finished last at the conference meet this
year.
Senior swimmer Marybeth Linzmeier
said, "In all reality, if girls are of national
caliber, they try to pick a school compara
ble with their talent. The Cal State schools
haven't shown they are in that class. It
shouldn't make a difference.
"I think it's crazy that they (Cal) haven't
joined. I think Cal would be a positive ad
dition. Bringing in more competition
would definitely help."
Basketball Coach Dotty McCrea said
she likes the change, though initially for a
different reason — Long Beach and San
Diego are both top-15 basketball teams
and both are going to the NCAA
tournament. Fullerton also has a top
-20 caliber basketball program.
"I think for a year it will be easier,*
she said, "but we're working toward
the Pac-10, and that won't be easier."
