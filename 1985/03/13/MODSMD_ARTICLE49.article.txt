### PETER CASTILLO Staff sportswriter 
This has been the Stanford wrestling team's finest
season ever, and the team hopes to cap it oft in style at the
NCAA Championships tomorrow through Saturday in
Oklahoma City.
Making the trip for the Cardinal will he Pacific 10 Con
ference champions Jeff Bradley (134 pounds) and Dave
Lee (167), plus second-place qualifier Scott Wiggen
(142). Tom Mullen (177) finished third at the Pac-lOs.
but was selected to go to the NCAA Championships after
the tournament concluded. Both Bradley and Wiggen
qualified for the NCA A Championships last year.
"The first objective is to win matches in order to score
points. It's possible to have a champion, but I'm not
counting on it." Stanford Coach Chris Horpel said. "We
have a chance to crack the top 20. It we have a good
tournament it is a realistic goal. It's also dependent on
whether we win the close matches and have good draws.

The Cardinal has had an All-American on the team for
the past two years, and Horpel believes that Bradley and
Lee have good shots at earning national honors by placing
in the top eight.
' Bradley is a very consistent winner. He has beaten
some of the top-eight wrestlers," Horpel stated.
"Technically he is good enough to place and is feeling
good after the Pac-10 Championships."
Horpel characterized Lee as a well-rounded competitor
who has competed well at all levels of competition. Lee
has had a few problems in the bigger tournaments, and ac
cording to Horpel, Lee has to be able to win the close
matches to do well.
Horpel also gave Wiggen a good chance of succeeding
in Oklahoma City.
"Wiggen is the kind of wrestler who can upset others
because of his unorthodox style. If his style is not stymied
by his opponent, he can do well. It is important how he
matches up against his opponent," Horpel said.
Horpel noted that Mullen has made a tremendous

amount of progress this season. He has extra incentive to
wrestle well: He is a senior and this will he his last col
legiate outing.
Horpel has been working a lot with the wrestlers to
prepare them for the shock they will face upon entering
the wrestling heartland of the United States. He has
practiced with them on the importance of focusing on
their matches instead of the tremendous distractions
around them.
The Stanford wrestlers faced some of the Midwestern
wrestlers in the Caesar's Palace Invitational and the Mid
west Invitational in December. This gave the athletes ex
posure to the top seeds and a chance to see how other
wrestlers did against them.
In the Pac-10 Championships, other third-place finis
hers were Neil Wartnik (126) and Kurt Kassulke (190).
Taking fourth were B.G. Porter (118), Jeff Hazard (150)
and Pete Rogers (158). Terry Mclntyre (HWT) did not
place.
