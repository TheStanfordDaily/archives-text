# Gambling game generates big bucks
## 
### DAVID RISSER Senior staff writer 
Many Stanford residences have
small gambling pools when a major
sporting event takes place, and every
one has a friend who occasionally
wagers a few dollars on his favorite
team. But "Calcutta," a game being
run in Toyon Hall and. on a smaller
scale, by residents of the Sigma Alpha
Epsilon (SAE) house this year, can
involve large amounts of money in a
complicated game based on the an
nual NCAA basketball tournament.
In years past, many other residences
have organized similar games.
Law enforcement officials
however, have a more somber view of
such games. Conviction can even lead
to a maximum penalty of three years
imprisonment for both the organizers
and the participants.
People playing Calcutta "buy" one
of the f>4 teams participating in the

championship at an auction where
groups of friends often pool their
money to buy a preferred team. At
Toyon, a team like the Georgetown
Hoy as, for example, may be auc
tioned for more than $600. and the
total pot may reach well into the
thousands of dollars.
If a team reaches a certain round in
the tournament, the lucky purchaser
is guaranteed to win some amount of
money. The percentage of the total
pot won depends on how far a team
advances after making it to a certain
cut-off round. The purchaser of the
team that prevails in the April 1
championship game stands to win up
wards of $ 1.500 in the Toyon pool.
Many residents of Toyon agree that
the Calcutta game is thrilling, espe
cially during the auctioning of teams.
"It's a real blast; when the teams start
going it's really fun." said sophomore
Mike Reynolds, who participated last

year with a group of friends.
"We went for smaller teams we
hoped would upset a ranked team.
We bought a low-ranked feam for
$ 125 between six or seven guys, and
four of us bought another one for
about $NO. We broke even or came
out a little below," he said.
According to Bob McHeffev. one
of four residents listed on a flyer ad
vertising the game in Toyon. said
Toyon "doesn't get a cent'" from the
game.
Other residents listed on the flyer
were not available for comment last
night.
"It's just done by a bunch of guys
who enjoy it," Reynolds said. It's a
dorm tradition without the dorm in
volved in the monetary end."
But according to law enforcement
officials, the game is illegal despite
the fact that the sponsor makes no
money.

Rocky Mullin. deputy district at
torney for Santa Clara county, con
fronted hypothetically with a Calcutta
scheme, said, "It sounds like the
wagering of money on the outcome of
a sporting contest. That is illegal."
Mullin. a specialist in gambling
legality, has never before heard of a
game structured like Calcutta.
In a matter such as this. Mullin said
his office would file a complaint and
prosecute if it was confident it had a
case.
Such an offense may be prosecuted
as a misdemeanor or as a felony
based on a defendant's prior record
and the seriousness of the offense, ac
cording to Mullin. Maximum
penalties for organizers and partici
pants are the same, although the wor
ding of the charge may vary slightly.
A person convicted of the mis
demeanor offense would face up to
one year in jail and a $1,000 fine or
up to three years in prison if found
guilty of the felony charge. "If people
are paying $500 for a team, let's say,
it might be in the felony category,"
Mullin said.
Law enforcement officials stressed
that gambling cases, especially ones
of the office-pool type, are difficult to
discover, and legal action is rarely
taken in such cases.
The University has little interest in
alleged gambling unless University
resources, time or money is involved

in the activity. Otherwise, gambling is
viewed as a private matter aptly cov
ered by state law. "That's the kind of
thing that falls under private activity.
It's not the kind of thing we've ever
been involved in," said Norm Robin
son, associate dean of Student Affairs
for Residential Education.
"I'm not aware that we have any
policy on gambling except that the
University does not get involved,"
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons
said. Neither Lyons nor Robinson
had heard of Calcutta games here.
Robinson said, however, that the
University would be very concerned
if an R.A. was abusing his position to
organize a Calcutta game.

Robinson said, however, that the
University would be very concerned
if an R.A. was abusing his position to
organize a Calcutta game.
Many Stanford residences have
small gambling pools when a major
sporting event takes place, and every
one has a friend who occasionally
wagers a few dollars on his favorite
team. But "Calcutta," a game being
run in Toyon Hall and. on a smaller
scale, by residents of the Sigma Alpha
Epsilon (SAE) house this year, can
involve large amounts of money in a
complicated game based on the an
nual NCAA basketball tournament.
In years past, many other residences
have organized similar games.
Law enforcement officials
however, have a more somber view of
such games. Conviction can even lead
to a maximum penalty of three years
imprisonment for both the organizers
and the participants.
People playing Calcutta "buy" one
of the f>4 teams participating in the

championship at an auction where
groups of friends often pool their
money to buy a preferred team. At
Toyon, a team like the Georgetown
Hoy as, for example, may be auc
tioned for more than $600. and the
total pot may reach well into the
thousands of dollars.
If a team reaches a certain round in
the tournament, the lucky purchaser
is guaranteed to win some amount of
money. The percentage of the total
pot won depends on how far a team
advances after making it to a certain
cut-off round. The purchaser of the
team that prevails in the April 1
championship game stands to win up
wards of $ 1.500 in the Toyon pool.
Many residents of Toyon agree that
the Calcutta game is thrilling, espe
cially during the auctioning of teams.
"It's a real blast; when the teams start
going it's really fun." said sophomore
Mike Reynolds, who participated last

year with a group of friends.
"We went for smaller teams we
hoped would upset a ranked team.
We bought a low-ranked feam for
$ 125 between six or seven guys, and
four of us bought another one for
about $NO. We broke even or came
out a little below," he said.
According to Bob McHeffev. one
of four residents listed on a flyer ad
vertising the game in Toyon. said
Toyon "doesn't get a cent'" from the
game.
Other residents listed on the flyer
were not available for comment last
night.
"It's just done by a bunch of guys
who enjoy it," Reynolds said. It's a
dorm tradition without the dorm in
volved in the monetary end."
But according to law enforcement
officials, the game is illegal despite
the fact that the sponsor makes no
money.

Rocky Mullin. deputy district at
torney for Santa Clara county, con
fronted hypothetically with a Calcutta
scheme, said, "It sounds like the
wagering of money on the outcome of
a sporting contest. That is illegal."
Mullin. a specialist in gambling
legality, has never before heard of a
game structured like Calcutta.
In a matter such as this. Mullin said
his office would file a complaint and
prosecute if it was confident it had a
case.
Such an offense may be prosecuted
as a misdemeanor or as a felony
based on a defendant's prior record
and the seriousness of the offense, ac
cording to Mullin. Maximum
penalties for organizers and partici
pants are the same, although the wor
ding of the charge may vary slightly.
A person convicted of the mis
demeanor offense would face up to
one year in jail and a $1,000 fine or
up to three years in prison if found
guilty of the felony charge. "If people
are paying $500 for a team, let's say,
it might be in the felony category,"
Mullin said.
Law enforcement officials stressed
that gambling cases, especially ones
of the office-pool type, are difficult to
discover, and legal action is rarely
taken in such cases.
The University has little interest in
alleged gambling unless University
resources, time or money is involved

in the activity. Otherwise, gambling is
viewed as a private matter aptly cov
ered by state law. "That's the kind of
thing that falls under private activity.
It's not the kind of thing we've ever
been involved in," said Norm Robin
son, associate dean of Student Affairs
for Residential Education.
"I'm not aware that we have any
policy on gambling except that the
University does not get involved,"
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons
said. Neither Lyons nor Robinson
had heard of Calcutta games here.
Robinson said, however, that the
University would be very concerned
if an R.A. was abusing his position to
organize a Calcutta game.
