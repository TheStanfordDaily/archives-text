# Men's hoops
## Not as bad as it seems 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
It wasn't a particularly good time or place for
Coach Tom Davis to talk about the past, present
and future of Stanford basketball. Only 20 minutes
separated him from the conclusion of a forgettable
season and only a wall separated him from a locker
room of distraught players.
"We did the best we could with what we had,"
Davis said of his team, which finished 11-17 overall,
7-17 against Division I opponents and dead last in
the Pacific 10 Conference at 3-15. "But it wasn't
enough."
What there wasn't enough of was talent. Relative
to the rest of the Pac-10, which sent four teams to

the NCAA tournament and a fifth to the National
Invitational Tournament, Davis had none. Zero.
Zilch. Nada.
What Davis had was a team full of team players.
He had plenty of guys who do the little things on the
court. The guys who take a charge or dive on the
floor for a loose ball or make the pass that sets up
the pass that sets up the basket.
As for the guys who put the ball in the hoop —
the money men — they either had graduated, had
stress fractures or were still in high school.
Wherever they were, they weren't playing for
Stanford this season. No Cardinal player averaged
more than 11 points per game. Two, Earl Koberlein
and Novian Whitsitt, averaged just over 10 points
per game, but by the end of the season, neither of
them started.
"We've got a lot of good team players, but we
don't have the standout," Davis said. "We had two
of them last year — Keith Jones and John Revclli.
This year, we didn't have a guy who could get it
going two nights in a row."
Besides talented players, Davis was lacking expe
rienced ones. Three starters from last year's 19-12
team graduated, and a fourth — Steve Brown —
missed the entire season with a stress fracture in his
leg.
So after a miserable season marked by an obvious
lack of talent and experience — the stuff champion
ship teams are made of — where does this leave the
program?
It's easy to look at Stanford's records during the
three-year Davis Era — 14-14, 19-12 and 11-17 —
and say Cardinal hoops has been mediocre, then up,
and now down.
It's also wrong.
Records aside, Stanford basketball has been im
proving, albeit slowly and inconspicuously, in
Davis' tenure. The building's foundation is laid.
There's just no roof yet.
When Davis took over for Dick Dißiaso three
years ago, he took over one of the most unsuccess
ful major college basketball programs in the land.
His plan was to rebuild it and give it something it
hadn't had in 40 years — a legitimate basketball
team. Not a team whose middle name was
mediocre, but a team that was good. A team that
