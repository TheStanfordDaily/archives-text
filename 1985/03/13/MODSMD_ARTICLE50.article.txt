# Men's hoops
## Not as bad as it seems 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
It wasn't a particularly good time or place for
Coach Tom Davis to talk about the past, present
and future of Stanford basketball. Only 20 minutes
separated him from the conclusion of a forgettable
season and only a wall separated him from a locker
room of distraught players.
"We did the best we could with what we had,"
Davis said of his team, which finished 11-17 overall,
7-17 against Division I opponents and dead last in
the Pacific 10 Conference at 3-15. "But it wasn't
enough."
What there wasn't enough of was talent. Relative
to the rest of the Pac-10, which sent four teams to

Commentary

the NCAA tournament and a fifth to the National
Invitational Tournament, Davis had none. Zero.
Zilch. Nada.
What Davis had was a team full of team players.
He had plenty of guys who do the little things on the
court. The guys who take a charge or dive on the
floor for a loose ball or make the pass that sets up
the pass that sets up the basket.
As for the guys who put the ball in the hoop —
the money men — they either had graduated, had
stress fractures or were still in high school.
Wherever they were, they weren't playing for
Stanford this season. No Cardinal player averaged
more than 11 points per game. Two, Earl Koberlein
and Novian Whitsitt, averaged just over 10 points
per game, but by the end of the season, neither of
them started.
"We've got a lot of good team players, but we
don't have the standout," Davis said. "We had two
of them last year — Keith Jones and John Revclli.
This year, we didn't have a guy who could get it
going two nights in a row."
Besides talented players, Davis was lacking expe
rienced ones. Three starters from last year's 19-12
team graduated, and a fourth — Steve Brown —
missed the entire season with a stress fracture in his
leg.
So after a miserable season marked by an obvious
lack of talent and experience — the stuff champion
ship teams are made of — where does this leave the
program?
It's easy to look at Stanford's records during the
three-year Davis Era — 14-14, 19-12 and 11-17 —
and say Cardinal hoops has been mediocre, then up,
and now down.
It's also wrong.
Records aside, Stanford basketball has been im
proving, albeit slowly and inconspicuously, in
Davis' tenure. The building's foundation is laid.
There's just no roof yet.
When Davis took over for Dick Dißiaso three
years ago, he took over one of the most unsuccess
ful major college basketball programs in the land.
His plan was to rebuild it and give it something it
hadn't had in 40 years — a legitimate basketball
team. Not a team whose middle name was
mediocre, but a team that was good. A team that
wasn't mathematically eliminated for
the Pac-10 title midway through the
season. A real, honest-to-god basket
ball team.
But Davis, who has a master's
degree and a Ph.D., isn't a stupid
man. He made no promises.
"1 knew how hard it was," he said.
"It's as hard as I thought it would be
at the worst. If it was easier to win at
Stanford, it would have been done
long ago. Hey, they've had some
good coaches here. Howie Dallmar
(1955-75) — he was a great coach."
Still, Davis has made more head
way in three years than anyone else
lias done in twice as long. It's just that
he's chosen to do the dirty work first,
to do the stuff that no one notices un
til a team has won its league or is in a
post-season tournament.
Davis realizes that it takes more
than a few talented basketball players
to build a contender. You can't put
the roof on a building before the walls
are up.
Davis has already laid the founda
tion for a soon-to-be contender. He's
raised fan support to the point where

he came a few hundred seats shy of
selling out 7,500-seat Maples
Pavilion, even though the team that
played there was 3-15 in the Pac-10.
Besides fan support, Davis also has
players with the proper attitude. They
get along with each other. They give
no less than 100 percent every time
they step on the court. Certainly no
team in the Pac-10 and probably no
team in the nation works harder than
Stanford.
And in Davis, Stanford has the
coaching. When basketball notables
mention Davis' name in the same
breath as the Deam Smiths and
Bobby Knights, they're not being
polite. They're just telling the truth.
Now all Stanford needs is the
players. Or rather, the talented
players to complement the team
players already here.
"I'd like to get the talent right
away," Davis said. "At some schools,
you can do that. You bring in a
couple of JC (junior college) stars
and a few freshmen, and you turn it
around in a year.
"You can't do that here. It's more
of a grind-it-out process. The pool of
(basketball) athletes that can get into
this place is so small. The basketball
player is a different kid than the gol

fer or the tennis star.
"The basketball player is more ofr
ten a middle class kid or even an
inner-city kid. They might be bright,
but often they don't take the right
courses(in high school)."
But the talent is coming. If Davis'
five freshmen-to-be — one player at
each position — live up to their prep
accolades, it will be without a doubt
the best basketball recruiting classin
Stanford history.
Add that talent to the base Davis
quietly has been building and what
you've got is a contender. A team
that won't have to upset teams to win,
but will have to be upset to lose:
Maybe not next year or the year after.
But soon.
Which is a whole hell of a lot better
than never.

to the rest of the Pac-10, which sent four teams to

the NCAA tournament and a fifth to the National
Invitational Tournament, Davis had none. Zero.
Zilch. Nada.
What Davis had was a team full of team players.
He had plenty of guys who do the little things on the
court. The guys who take a charge or dive on the
floor for a loose ball or make the pass that sets up
the pass that sets up the basket.
As for the guys who put the ball in the hoop —
the money men — they either had graduated, had
stress fractures or were still in high school.
Wherever they were, they weren't playing for
Stanford this season. No Cardinal player averaged
more than 11 points per game. Two, Earl Koberlein
and Novian Whitsitt, averaged just over 10 points
per game, but by the end of the season, neither of
them started.
"We've got a lot of good team players, but we
don't have the standout," Davis said. "We had two
of them last year — Keith Jones and John Revclli.
This year, we didn't have a guy who could get it
going two nights in a row."
Besides talented players, Davis was lacking expe
rienced ones. Three starters from last year's 19-12
team graduated, and a fourth — Steve Brown —
missed the entire season with a stress fracture in his
leg.
So after a miserable season marked by an obvious
lack of talent and experience — the stuff champion
ship teams are made of — where does this leave the
program?
It's easy to look at Stanford's records during the
three-year Davis Era — 14-14, 19-12 and 11-17 —
and say Cardinal hoops has been mediocre, then up,
and now down.
It's also wrong.
Records aside, Stanford basketball has been im
proving, albeit slowly and inconspicuously, in
Davis' tenure. The building's foundation is laid.
There's just no roof yet.
When Davis took over for Dick Dißiaso three
years ago, he took over one of the most unsuccess
ful major college basketball programs in the land.
His plan was to rebuild it and give it something it
hadn't had in 40 years — a legitimate basketball
team. Not a team whose middle name was
mediocre, but a team that was good. A team that
wasn't mathematically eliminated for
the Pac-10 title midway through the
season. A real, honest-to-god basket
ball team.
But Davis, who has a master's
degree and a Ph.D., isn't a stupid
man. He made no promises.
"1 knew how hard it was," he said.
"It's as hard as I thought it would be
at the worst. If it was easier to win at
Stanford, it would have been done
long ago. Hey, they've had some
good coaches here. Howie Dallmar
(1955-75) — he was a great coach."
Still, Davis has made more head
way in three years than anyone else
lias done in twice as long. It's just that
he's chosen to do the dirty work first,
to do the stuff that no one notices un
til a team has won its league or is in a
post-season tournament.
Davis realizes that it takes more
than a few talented basketball players
to build a contender. You can't put
the roof on a building before the walls
are up.
Davis has already laid the founda
tion for a soon-to-be contender. He's
raised fan support to the point where

he came a few hundred seats shy of
selling out 7,500-seat Maples
Pavilion, even though the team that
played there was 3-15 in the Pac-10.
Besides fan support, Davis also has
players with the proper attitude. They
get along with each other. They give
no less than 100 percent every time
they step on the court. Certainly no
team in the Pac-10 and probably no
team in the nation works harder than
Stanford.
And in Davis, Stanford has the
coaching. When basketball notables
mention Davis' name in the same
breath as the Deam Smiths and
Bobby Knights, they're not being
polite. They're just telling the truth.
Now all Stanford needs is the
players. Or rather, the talented
players to complement the team
players already here.
"I'd like to get the talent right
away," Davis said. "At some schools,
you can do that. You bring in a
couple of JC (junior college) stars
and a few freshmen, and you turn it
around in a year.
"You can't do that here. It's more
of a grind-it-out process. The pool of
(basketball) athletes that can get into
this place is so small. The basketball
player is a different kid than the gol

fer or the tennis star.
"The basketball player is more ofr
ten a middle class kid or even an
inner-city kid. They might be bright,
but often they don't take the right
courses(in high school)."
But the talent is coming. If Davis'
five freshmen-to-be — one player at
each position — live up to their prep
accolades, it will be without a doubt
the best basketball recruiting classin
Stanford history.
Add that talent to the base Davis
quietly has been building and what
you've got is a contender. A team
that won't have to upset teams to win,
but will have to be upset to lose:
Maybe not next year or the year after.
But soon.
Which is a whole hell of a lot better
than never.
It wasn't a particularly good time or place for
Coach Tom Davis to talk about the past, present
and future of Stanford basketball. Only 20 minutes
separated him from the conclusion of a forgettable
season and only a wall separated him from a locker
room of distraught players.
"We did the best we could with what we had,"
Davis said of his team, which finished 11-17 overall,
7-17 against Division I opponents and dead last in
the Pacific 10 Conference at 3-15. "But it wasn't
enough."
What there wasn't enough of was talent. Relative
