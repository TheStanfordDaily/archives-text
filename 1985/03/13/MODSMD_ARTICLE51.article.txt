## Women swimmers aim for second place 
### INGRID SEYER Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford women's swimming
team won't be looking for a national
title at the NCAA Championships,
but it will be looking to do the abso
lute best it can. This year, Stanford's
"absolute best" will probably mean
no more than second place.
"No one is going to come within
100 points of Texas this year, but
there will be one big battle going on
for the second and third spots,"
Haines said. "Our team goal is to
swim well and to do the best we can
with what we have.
"This year, our best will have to
mean placing behind Texas, but we
are still going to go for all we have."
The Cardinal will travel to Bir
mingham, Ala., March 21-23 to com
pete in the championships. Nine
Stanford swimmers qualified in 24 in
dividual events and five relays.
Senior Marybeth Linzmeier and
junior Patty Gavin qualified in four
events each while Liza Hazen, Stacy
Shupe and Kathy Smith qualified in
three apiece.

Jenny Rapp, Jennifer Pokluda and
Diana Zock qualified in two events
each and Stephanie Norton met the
NCAA cut-off time in one event.
All five of the Stanford relay teams
have qualified.
"All of our relays should be top
contenders in the championships,"
Haines said.
Haines' predictions for all of the
NCAA events are as follows:
• 50-yard freestyle: Connie Van
Bentum of California and Sue Haber
nigg of USC will be the swimmers to
beat, but Stanford's Zock and Smith
will be strong contenders.
• 100-yard freestyle: Habernigg and
Van Bentum will once again be the
top contenders.
• 200-yard freestyle: Stanford's
Linzmeier is the defending champion
in this event and has won it for the
past three years. "Marybeth has a
real shot at winning the 200," Haines
said. "I think she has pretty much set
her mind on winning it."
• 500-yard freestyle: Cohen holds
the national-best time in this event
(4:41), but Linzmeier and Shupe will

contend.
• 1,650-yard freestyle: Cohen is the
odds-on favorite, but once again,
Linzmeier and Shupe will be the
swimmers to watch.
• 100-yard backstroke: Torrie Trees
and Debbie Risen of Texas are "far
and away the favorites," said Haines,
but Stanford's Pokluda should place
in the top four or five.
• 200-yard backstroke: Trees, Risen
and Stanford's Gavin are expected to
be the leaders in this event. "Patty
Gavin has a real shot at winning this
event," Haines said.
• 200-yard butterfly: "Meagher is far
and away the best swimmer in this
event," Haines said. Nonetheless,
Stanford's Norton should place well.
• 100-yard breaststroke : Texas' Kim
Rhodenbaugh holds the national-best
time in this event, but Stanford's
Smith is only three-tenths of a second
behind her.
• 200-yard breaststroke: Smith holds
the No. 1 time in this event (2:16.11),
but Rhondenbaugh isn't too far be
hind (2:16.6).
• 200-yard individual medley:
"Gavin should be in the top three or
four in this one," Haines said.
• 400-yard individual medley:
Florida's Mary Wayte is the nation's
fastest qualifier (4:14) in this event,
but Gavin and Cohen should both be
top contenders.
• 200-yard medley relay: Stanford's
relay of Pokluda, Smith, Norton and
Zock is expected to be right at the
top. Texas and Florida will both be
tough.
• 400-yard medley relay: Texas holds
the fastest time in the nation, with
California following in second and
USC in third. Stanford holds the na
tion's fourth-fastest time but could be
tough if the relay "pulls together,"
Haines said.
• 200-yard freestyle relay: Texas also
has the No. 1 time in this relay.
• 400-yard freestyle relay: Texas
once again holds the fastest time, but
Stanford is expected to do well. "We
won't be in there battling at the
finish, but we will place fairly well,"
Haines said.
• 800-yard freestyle relay: "Cal is
really hot in this relay," Haines said.
"We look really good on paper, and if
all the legs swim their best, we have a
chance of being right in there at the
finish."
