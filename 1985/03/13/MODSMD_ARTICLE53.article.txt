# Tennis teams coast to easy victories
## Women slam Long Beach 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
Even the rigors of the road couldn't
ruin the Stanford women's tennis
[team's undefeated season and match
yinning streak that is approaching
monstrous proportions.
Stanford played two matches in
two days in Arizona, its second road
trip; in as many weeks, and then
returned home to play again a day
latei Three more matches, three
mOre victories.
"We traveled two weekends in a
row and that's tough," Coach Frank
Brennan said. "But we survived
pretty well."
•''•Survived" in Stanford women's
tennis terminology means a 6-3 vic
tory at lOth-ranked Arizona Friday, a
7-2 win at No. 14 Arizona State Sat
urday, and a 7-2 decision at home
over Long Beach State Monday. The
trio of triumphs upped the Cardinal's
record to 13-0 overall and 6-0 in the

WCAA. They were also the Card
inal's 37th, 38th and 39th straight
victories dating back to last season.
Stanford's next milestone will be
breaking the school — and NCAA —
record of 40 consecutive wins set by
the Cardinal men's team when a fel
low named John McEnroe was in uni
form. Barring the unforeseen, 20th
ranked Harvard will become the vic
tim No. 40 for the women when the
Crimson visits Stanford Tennis
Stadium March 25.
But to break the record for con
secutive victories, the Cardinal will
have to defeat none other than
second-ranked USC — at USC.
"That will be the first team we
won't be an overwhelming favorite
against," Brennan said of the March
27 date with the Trojans. "Everyone
in the country will be watching for
that score, since both teams are unde
feated."
In the meantime, Stanford has a

two-week break to take final exams
and prepare for USC. And for sopho
more Patty Fendick's knee to heal.
Fendick, ranked-sixth nationally in
singles, fell on her knee in the second
set of her first match on the Arizona
trip and was forced to default her No.
2 singles match to Arizona's Susan
Russo. Fendick was losing 6-3, 5-2 at
the time.
"It was hurting a little bit before,
but the match did it in," Brennan
said. "It was really sore and she
wasn't able to run down balls like she
usually can.
"I don't think it's that serious,
though, and 1 think she'll be back
after the (two-week) break in time
for USC," he continued. "If we don't
have Patty against USC, our chances
go way down because right now, we
are even with USC. But I'd be
surprised if Patty's not ready by
then."
Against Arizona, Stanford won
four of the six singles matches, all in
straight sets. Fendick defaulted at No.
2 and Stephanie Savides lost in three
sets to Tina Rimer at No. 5. Stanford
won at No. 1 doubles to clinch the
victory, and then split the remaining
two matches, winning at No. 2 and
losing at No. 3.
Against Arizona State Saturday,
the Fendick-less Cardinal still was
able to clinch the match before the
doubles by winning five singles
matches. "Linda Gates had a great
win over Sherri Norris (at No. 1
singles)," Brennan said. "Norris was
an All-American last year and has
beaten Linda three or four times in a
row. So that was the highlight of the
match for me."
Stanford had even less trouble
Monday with Long Beach State,
which fell to 12-8 overall and 1-6 in
the WC'AA. Again, the Cardinal
decided the issue early by winning
five singles matches.
The Harvard match marks the
beginning of a four-matches-in-five
days stint for Stanford, with the last
three of those matches on the road.
After USC March 27, the Cardinal
plays at eighth-ranked UCLA March
28 and has a rematch against Long
Beach State March 29.
