# Men outclass New Mexico
## 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
It was an almost perfect finish of
preseason play for the Stanford men's
tennis team, as the No. 1-ranked
Cardinal defeated New Mexico 8-1
on Friday to raise its overall dual
match record to 11 -0.
The match with New Mexico
marked the first time the Cardinal has
played a full lineup since going
against No. 7 Louisiana State on Feb.
14. Coach Dick Gould said he wanted
to get his team playing together one
last time before the break for Dead
Week and finals.
What was unusual about the lineup
was the split of Stanford's No. 1
doubles team of Jim Grabb and John
Letts. Gould moved his No. 2 doubles
team, consisting of Pat McEnroe and
Derrick Rostagno, to fill in at No. 1.
"I think we'll play with this lineup
at least through our Arizona match.
After that, we'll look at how we've
done and go from there," Gould said.
As the doubles teams stand,
McEnroe and Rostagno will play at
No. 1, with Grabb playing with Dan
Goldie at No. 2, and Letts playing
with Scott Moody in the third doubles
matches.
Gould said he hopes the diffusion
of good players will give the Cardinal
a balanced "offense." Instead of
having one great doubles team of
Grabb and Letts, Gould would like to
have three very good teams with
which to compete.
Gould will have to see more
playing time, however, from the new
doubles arrangements than he wit
nessed against New Mexico. He sat
between the No. 2 and No. 3 courts
keeping a close eye on the new teams,
but the matches didn't last too long.
Goldie and Grabb defeated Galen
Garcia and David Ramirez, 6-1, 6-3.
Letts and Moody also took no time in
defeating New Mexico's Jerry Gun
ther and Jack Griffin, 6-1, 6-2.
Gunther was impressed with Stan
ford's play. He also played No. 6
singles, losing to McEnroe, 6-4, 6-1.
"We've played some teams in the
top 20 and lost 5-4, but that doesn't
look like it's the case today," he said
while watching a match Friday.
"We're getting blown out."

Gunther said his team came into
the match "pretty psyched up" but
"there's not much you can do"
against players such as McEnroe.
"His backhand is incredible. The
only way 1 can describe it is that it's
like a two-handed, left-handed
forehand â€” really powerful," Gun
ther said.
McEnroe also played well in his
doubles match with Rostagno.
Both players fed the ball success
fully down the middle throughout the
match on the way to a 6-2, 6-2 win.
Occasionally/ Rostagno would let go
and slam a crosscourt return of a
serve winner. Midway through the
first set. opponent Tim Cass turned to
partner Steve Bickham and said,
"These guys are unbelievable."
New Mexico did have one moment
to celebrate after Bickham defeated
Letts, 7-5, 6-3, in the No. 5 singles
match. The first five matches had
alreadv finished in little over an hour.

leaving full attention on what turned
out to be New Mexico's one win of
the afternoon.
"Everyone has (his] off days, and
I'm sure John (Letts) will bounce
back," Gould said.
Bickham seemed to have deter
mination on his side, however. After
a forehand volley of Letts went long
to give Bickham the win. New
Mexico's coach and players came out
to congratulate him.
Letts still had his doubles match to
play. New Mexico's Gunther and
Griffin, perhaps assuming frustration
on Letts' part, kept the pressure on
him throughout the match, aiming
volleys and smashes in his direction.
Stanford's next match is at Califor
nia on March 27. After that, the
Cardinal will head south to play both
Arizona State and Arizona before re
turning for two important home
matches against USC and No. 4
UCLA on April 5 and 6, respectively.
