# Women's basketball ends season
## Card loses at SDSU, USC 
### JOHN LIS Editorial shift 
The breakup of the Western Collegiate Athletic
Association is coming none to soon for the Stan
ford women's basketball team. The Cardinal
finished its season with a 2-12 conference record as
it dropped games to USC 77-60 on Sunday and San
Diego State 76-60 on Friday.
After having gone 7-7 in non-conference games
and 2-2 in its first four WC'AA contests, Stanford
dropped 10 straight to close the year. The 9-19
record was an improvement on last season's 5-23
mark, and Coach Dotty McCrea didn't forget that.
"1 felt it was a good year." she said. "You have
to go 5-23 to appreciate 9-19. We have a good atti
tude, and I see improvement. That's a prelude to
better things next year."
But in the meantime there was this year.
The Cardinal has had two problems: It has 10
conference games against more talented teams, and
it has a tendency to hit scoring droughts when it
does manage to stay even with those teams.
The loss to San Diego State was a case in point.
"We played pretty well at San Diego," said
senior forward Marv Bradach, who ended her Stan

ford career Sunday with eight points and 10
rebounds. "We just went down five or six times and
didn't score, they did, and we were down 10 or 12
points."
"1 think it's the same thing that's been happening
all season," guard Virginia Sourlis said. "We've
been playing real well, but we run out of gas in the
second half. Against San Diego we had one stage
where we needed someone to put the ball in the
basket, and at that stage we went down by 10."
Stanford led 31-30 at halftime, but San Diego
outscored the Cardinal 46-29 in the second halt to
raise its record to 20-8 overall, 9-5 in the WCAA,
and gain a berth in the NCAA tournament.
The Aztecs' Tina Hutchinson, the leading scorer
in the nation last season, remained sidelined with a
knee injury. The scoring burden fell on the
shoulders of second-team Freshman All-America
guard Penny Toler, and she responded with a 27-
point effort.
"We did a good job on Toler in the first halt,
McCrea said. "She got a lot of her points on transi
tion when we were tired."
Stanford's own first-team freshman Ail-
American, forward Kami Anderson, led the Card

inal with 17 points. Sourlis added 12, and center
Karen Goedewaagen had nine.
At USC Sunday it was an encore performance of
the Cheryl Miller show. The three-time junior All-
American scored 30 points and pulled down 15
rebounds to pace the Trojans, who also will be ir
the NCAA tournament.
USC led 36-29 after the first half and pulled
awav in the second.
"She had her 30 points and 15 rebounds,
Bradach said of Miller. "She always takes the game
under control when they need it. They played
sloppy, but they played well when they needed to."
Anderson led Stanford again with 19 points and
11 rebounds. Sourlis had 10, and Bradach, forward
Sue Sebolt and guard Judy Griffith each had six.
So ended what some would call a disappointing
season. And what some wouldn't.
"It wasn't as disappointing as people might say,"
Sourlis said. "We've progressed so much. Mary's
going to be gone, and we'll miss her a lot, but the
program's been growing since 1 ve been here.
"It would've been nice if we had done better,"
Bradach said, "but I see a lot of potential for those
guys next year."
