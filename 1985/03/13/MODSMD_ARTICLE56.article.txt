After a 10-day layoff, the Stan
ford men's volleyball team will be
back in action Friday evening
against St. Mary's in a match that
begins at 7:30 in Maples Pavilion.
The Cardinal, ranked fifth na
tionally. enters the match with a 6-
4 league record and an 18-5 overall
mark. Friday's contest with St.
Mary's, a club team that was
elevated to varsity status just last
year, is not a league match.
Three weeks ago the two squads
met in Moraga. After the Card
inal's 15-8. 15-4. 15-10 triumph,
Stanford Co-coach Don Shaw was
surprised by the Gaels off-season
improvement. "They're well
schooled in the fundamentals, but
they don't have the personnel," he
said.
Team captain Craig l.auchner
said, "It was a quick match, and not
too exciting." Explaining his team's
listless plav, Lauchner said: "You
can't expect a stellar performance

against a team like St.Mary's."
Stanford will be in need of a
number of stellar performances,
though, when it embarks on its last
road trip of the season next week.
On Monday the men will visit
Malibu for a rematch with league
leader Pepperdine. The Cardinal
will seek revenge for last Wednes
day's four-set defeat at the hands of
the Waves.
Wednesday's and Friday's con
tests with Loyola-Marymount and
Cal State-Northridge pit the Card
inal against two teams it has already
beaten this year. The matches with
Pepperdine, Loyola-Marymount
and Northridge all begin at 7:30
p.m.
After that, it's up the coast to
meet UC-Santa Barbara, a team
that thrashed the Cardinal here in
four sets a month ago, for the road
trip's culmination. That match,
which starts at 5 p.m., should be a
battle for fourth place in the Cali
fornia Intercollegiate Volleyball
Association. Currently, Stanford is

in that fourth spot, a half-game
ahead of the Gauchos, 5-4.
Hawaii, winner of three straight
matches, is in sixth at 3-5. They
could push the Cardinal or the
Gauchos for fifth place, the last
spot that would qualify for an
NCAA tournament bid.
CIV A matches over the weekend
saw Peppetdine solidify its league
lead with a victory over San Diego
State. The Waves, now 8-0, are a
game up on second-place teams
USC (7-1), which squeaked by
Northridge in five sets, and UCLA
(8-2).
Stanford, Santa Barbara and
Hawaii reside in the fourth through
sixth spots, and SDSU (3-7),
Northridge (2-6), Cal State-Long
Beach (1-7) and Loyola-
Marymount (0-7) round out the
rest of the ClVa\ slate.
The Cardinal returns to Maples
after spring break tor a season
ending home stand.
