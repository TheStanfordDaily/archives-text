# Fencers stumble at Western Regionals
## Card fades, places 3rd 
### ERIK ESELIUS Staff sportswriter 
Gpiiig into the final day of the three-day
Western Regional tournament Sunday, the
Stanford men's fencing team had a perfect 6-0
record and needed to win only one of its last
two matches against either Air Force or San
Jose State to finish first. They lost both, and
dropped to third behind first-place San Jose
and runner-up Air Force.
"I really thought we were the strongest
team," Head Coach Buzz Hurst said. "For
that matter, I still think we are. We just didn't
prove it — it takes more than just doing it on
paper."
Stanford opened the first two days of the
tournament with consecutive victories over
UC-San Diego, Fullerton State, Texas-San
Antonio, Cal Tech, the University of San
Francisco and Long Beach State. Then the
problems began.

The Cardinal entered the Air Force match
with a convincing 18-9 victory over the Fal
cons earlier this year under its belt. This time
around, however, Air Force came away with a
15-12 upset.
The loss mystified a disappointed Hurst.
"The saber team went 8-1, rolling along like
normal. The foil team, frankly, came unglued.
They went 2-7 after going 6-3 the first time,"
Hurst said. "I just can't put my finger on it."
The shaken Cardinal could not rebound
against the Spartans, losing 15-12. Down 12-
6 after the saber and foil portions of the
match, the Stanford epee team made things
more tense by streaking to a quick 5-0 lead.
However, the Spartans came back to win two
straight bouts, clinching the Regional Cham
pionship.
Though Stanford did not fare as expected
on the team level, the Cardinal did manage to
qualify three fencers to the NCAA tourna
ment. Andy Goorno and Steve Levitan will

represent the Stanford saber team, while the
Cardinal foil team wjll send Elliott Cheu.
Goorno, the saber team captain, finished in
first place, posting an outstanding 23-0
record. His undefeated record was high
lighted by his defeat of last year's defending
saber champion and All-America selection,
Tarek Yassir.
Cheu, who finished in second place, also
racked up impressive credentials,, finishing
20-3 and earning the prestigious "Fencer of
the Tournament" award. The award is an
nually given to the fencer who best ex
emplifies good sportsmanship and conduct.
Hurst said he feels confident about Cheu's
and Goorno's chances in the NCAAs but does
not expect a rousing team finish, "Frankly, I
think Andy and Elliott can make it to the
finals. ... I don't anticipate much as far as a
team showing — not enough qualifiers."
The NCAA tournament will held at Notre
Dame Tuesday and Wednesday.
