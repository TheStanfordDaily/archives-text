# Golfers win at Rancho Murieta
## Robinson triumphs again 
### KEN STEVENS Staff sportswriter 
Two streaks continued for the Stanford
men's golf team last week — senior Tim Rob
inson captured his second consecutive indi
vidual championship while the Cardinal won
the Sacramento State Invitational at Rancho
Murieta for the third straight year.
Stanford was able to tame two difficult
courses on its way to posting a 902 54-hole
total. Finishing in second place was San Jose
State with a 906 three-round total. Nevada-
Reno and Oregon tied for third place at 921.
Robinson picked up where he had left off in
Hawaii when he won the John Burns Invita
tional. He combined scores of 74, 70 and 71
at Rancho Murieta to record a tournament
record 215.
Stanford Coach Tim Schaaf, who had said
before the tournament that the team needed
to play well at Rancho Murieta, was obviously
delighted with the weekend's results.
"I was pleased with the win and very
pleased with [Robinson's] play," Schaaf said,
adding that the team's performance "was not
brilliant. . . but it was real solid."
In addition to Robinson, both Don
Walsworth and Scott Erickson finished
among the leaders at Rancho Murieta.

Walsworth, who had not qualified for the
tournament but was called on to compete
when Rich Marik came up with a muscle
spasm iti his neck, tied for seventh place with
a 226 total.
Erickson finished one shot back of
Walsworth at 227, which was good for a tie
for ninth place. Other Cardinal finishes in
cluded Doug Thompson at 234 and Carl
Wagner at 240.
Stanford will be looking for another cham
pionship at the NorCal Championships on
Friday and Saturday at the Alcorn Country
Club in Stockton. The tournament, which is
being hosted by the University of the Pacific,
should provide the Cardinal with a stiffer
challenge than the Sacramento State Invita
tional did, according to Schaaf.
"It should have fairly good competition,"
Schaaf said. "It won't have UCLA and USC
but it will have the rest of them (the Western
contenders)." Included in the teams sched
uled to appear at Stockton are Fresno State
and San Jose State. The Spartans have chal
lenged the Cardinal golfers in the last two
tournaments, defeating them at the John
Burns Invitational and finishing just four
strokes back of Stanford at Rancho Murieta.
Erickson, Robinson and Thompson will

definitely he competing at Stockton for the
Cardinal. If Marik's neck has recovered he
will occupy the fourth spot on the roster, and
Walsworth will probably fill the remaining
position.
The Cardinal men will also play in two
other tournaments over the spring break. On
Monday, March 25, they will compete in the
Cal Invitational, hosted by California. This
marks the first time that Cal has hosted a
tournament, which, according to Schaaf, is a
great step up for the golf program of Stan
ford's rival across the Bay.
Following the Cal Invitational, Stanford
will compete in the Fresno Pepsi Intercol
legiate March 29-30. With this tournament
commences the all-important spring season
for the Cardinal.
"It (the Fresno Intercollegiate) is the first
one of five real biggies in a row," Schaaf said.
Included in those big tournaments is the Stan
ford U.S. Intercollegiate which will be played
on the Cardinal's home course April 13-14.
While the Cardinal men are busy playing
the next two weeks, the women golfers have a
fairly light schedule — their next tournament
is the Lady Mustang in Dallas, March 27-29.
