### CAROLYN TARKINGTON Staff sportswriter 
The Stanford men's gymnastics team made history in
Friday's home competition against UC-Davis, setting a
new team record and three event records. Four of the six
Cardinal men set personal records in the all-around com
petition.
The Cardinal totaled 283.30 team points, nearly four
points higher than the record set two weeks ago at the
UC'LA Invitational. Friday's meet was the third time the
Cardinal men have set a new team record this season.
"Since two home scores are averaged with three away
scores for NCAA qualification, we knew this meet would
be a crucial one for us since it was our last home competi
tion," Head Coach Sadeo. Hamada said. "Our aim was to
score around 280 and we went way ahead of that. I'm very
satisfied, to say the least."
Hamada said that with only the Pacific 10 Conference
Championships left before the NCAAs, he feels fairly cer
tain that the team will qualify for the nationals. The Stan
ford gymnastics team has never been in the NCAA tourn
ament.
After Friday's record-breaking performance, the Card

inal moved up three positions in the national rankings,
from No. 9 to No. 6.
Along with the record total, team records were also set
in the pommel horse, rings and parallel bar events. Gym
nasts Jon Levy, Randy Besosa, Gary Smith and Mike
Matzek set personal all-around records of 57.85, 57.35
and 55.85, respectively, taking the top three spots in the
all-around with Smith and Matzek tying for third.
In the individual events, Stanford swept the top three
placings in each of the six events.
"I think one of the biggest surprises of the evening was
freshman Mike Matzek," Hamada said. "He has been
scoring about 54 points all season and really made a consi
derable jump in this meet. 1 was also proud of Gary Smith
and Mark Arnold for doing such an excellent job despite
injuries."
"We really didn't have any major mess-ups last night
and I think that is the key to why we did so well." Matzek
said.
"The crowd was small but very supportive," added
Levy. "They really cheered for us and even held up a sign
that said 'Splendid.' I think the support really helped us
out."
