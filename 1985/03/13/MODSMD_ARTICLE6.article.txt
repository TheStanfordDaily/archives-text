# Comp Sci expert sues Weinberger
## 
### DAVID S. GOLDSTEIN Staff writer 
A University computer expert is
suing Secretary of Defense Caspar
Weinberger over the use of
computer-control led nuclear
missile launch systems.
Clifford Johnson, a manager at
the University's Information
Technology Services office, filed
the lawsuit in February 1984,
claiming that launch-on-warning
capability — allowing a computer
to decide to launch a counterat
tack if it senses incoming missiles
— is unconstitutional.
Johnson lost the first round in
San Francisco's federal court in
mid-1984, but filed a 50-page
brief Feb. 20 in the 9th U.S. Cir
cuit Court of Appeals.
Weinberger's attorneys have not
yet responded.
"It's undoubtedly the most
worthwhile thing I've ever done,"
Johnson said.
Johnson said he could not find
an attorney who would handle the
case the way Johnson wanted, so
he is pursuing the case himself on
his own time and at his own ex
pense. He estimated that he has
spent at least 2,000 hours working
on the ease since he began early
last year and said he has already
spent more than $1,000 this year
on costs relating to the suit.
The crux of Johnson's argument
is that the Constitution states,
"The Congress shall have power
. . . to declare war," and,"The
president shall be . . . commander
in chief o f the armed forces."
Johnson said launch-on
warning capability (LOWC) sys
tems, such as might be imple
mented in the proposed "Star
Wars" defense system, place the
burden of decision on a computer
and denies government branches
the decision to go to war.
Johnson said he bases his argu
ment on a ruling by U.S. Attorney
General Homer Cummings, who
in 1936 told President Roosevelt
that he could not delegate the job
of choosing an acting governor of
Puerto Rico because "the presi
dent cannot delegate a discretion
ary duty, so that the duty when
performed will not be his act."
Johnson said he believes that
delegating the decision to launch
missiles is similarly unconstitu
tional.
Johnson said he is avoiding a
"left-wing" approach which would
imply arguing that the intentional
launch of nuclear missiles violates

the Constitution. He said he does
not question the legality of a presi
dential decision to trigger a
launch, but believes that the presi
dent cannot legally hand the deci
sion to a computer. He also fears a
computer malfunction resulting in
an accidental launch.
Although the judge ruled
against Johnson in the suit's first
round, he did not dismiss the case.
He determined that because
Johnson stands a greater risk of
nuclear annihilation because he
works at a likely Soviet target,
Johnson has "standing" to sue.
"I might get vaporized,"
Johnson said.
The judge said he decided

against him, however, because he
felt the suit was a political matter
outside his purview, hut suggested
that Johnson appeal it to a court
with "greater wisdom" in such
matters.
Lt. Col. Don Brownlee, a
spokesman for the Defense De
partment, declined to comment on
a case still in litigation, hut said he
believes Weinberger is personally
following the suit.
Johnson, a British citizen, said
he was motivated to sue when the
United States placed two Pershing
missiles in his native London.
He said he expects the appeal to
be heard by the end of the month.
If he loses there, he said he will
appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Johnson said winning the law
suit would force the Defense De
partment to scrap the Star Wars
proposal. "Star Wars cannot work
without automatic launch on
wirninc," he said.
