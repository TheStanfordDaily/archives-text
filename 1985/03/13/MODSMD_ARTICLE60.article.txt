## Victory at sea for Card 
### INGRID SEYER Staff sportswriter 
Despite one day of complete calm
and another of squalls, the Stanford
sailing team came out on top this
weekend in the North Series 3 and 4
regatta at Santa Cruz. Eight teams
competed in the regatta.
All of Saturday's races were can
celed due to a lack of wind, but on
Sunday, the wind made up for lost
time and came on extra strong for the
sailors.
"The day started out really windy
with heavy squalls but eventually
settled into a nice heavy air day,"
Stanford Coach Joe Petrucci said.
Five races were held in the Varsity
competition, with the Cardinal win
ning both the A and B divisions.
"I was very pleased with our
sailing," Petrucci said. "Basically, we
blew the rest of the teams out of the
water."

Skipper Tom Kuhnle won the A
divison for Stanford with Erma
Rodriguez and Liz Egan alternating
as crew.
Albert Boyce and crew Kristen
Boyles placed third for the Cardinal
in the A division.
In the B division, Stanford's Doug
Hagan and crew Liz Egan captured
first place. Skipper Kim Thompson
and crew Oscar Brock placed fifth in
the B competition for the Cardinal.
Although Stanford definitely won
the regatta, the final scores are un
available due to a race protest cur
rently under review.
Stanford will travel to Annapolis,
Md., this weekend to compete in the
Trux-Umstead Regatta, featuring 22
of the nation's top collegiate sailing
squads.
Stanford will be taking a team of
eight to compete in the regatta's four
divisons.

"Our main goal during the upcom
ing regatta will be to improve our tal
ent," Pctrucci said. "We really want
to raise our level of talent up to that
of the top national teams."
Skipper Rich Bergsund and crew
Sheri Lipman will compete in the A
division and Doug Hagan and crew
Liz Egan will compete in the B divi
sion.
Both the A and B division compete
in 4205. Hagan is a past non
collegiate champion in 420 competi
tion and is world-ranked in that class.
In the single-handed divisions,
Stanford will enter Kuhnle in the C
division and Gordon Wanlass in the
D division.
Senior Rod Turner will be traveling
as the team alternate due to his ex
treme versatility in both light- and
heavy-wind sailing.
