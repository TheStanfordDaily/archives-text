### 
Cycling
As the Stanford cycling team
prepares for its first race March 23,
the team's captains are optimistic
about the 1985 season.
Led by a strong core of returning
riders, the team promises to do at
least as well as last year, when it
placed second in the prestigious
United States Cycling Federation
(USCF) Western Section.
The team's first race is Santa
Clara's Chesborough/Uvas Dam
Road Race March 23. USCF scoring
allows a team to submit its five best
races — out of a possible 16 — to
arrive at its season total. Because
many of the early races axe located in
the Bay Area, Stanford is hoping to
swamp these races with riders.
The women's team's "prospects are
excellent," according to Katrin
Tobin, the team's co-captain. The
team will have at least six women
competing — compared to only three
last year.
Tobin should be one of the best
collegiate women in the nation.
"Katrin probably wouldn't say this
herself, but I don't think there's a col
legiate woman racer who can touch
her," says Topp of Tobin. "And if

Cini is able to race, we'll have an un
beatable women's team."
Judo
After suffering a 50-23 defeat to
San Jose State last month, the Stan
ford judo club will be looking for
revenge Saturday when it fights San
Jose State, Hayward State and San
Francisco State in a four-way meet.
The meet will be held at noon at
Hayward State.
Cardinal Judo Coach Willy Cahill
attributes last month's loss to the
team's inexperience in dual-meet
competition. The bout with San Jose
was the first dual meet in the Card
inal's history.
"My people are used to competing
in tournaments, where they fight four
or five matches," Cahill said. "In a
dual meet, it is all or nothing, you
have one chance and you have to ex
plode when you get it."
JoAo Azvedo (189 pounds, black
belt) and James Arnmine (172
pounds, brown belt) put in strong
performances in the last meet with
San Jose. Arnwine has since placed
second in the Pacific Area Judo Asso
ciation's Brown Belt Championship.

Women's rugby

successful week, finishing league play*
in first place with a 5-1 record.
On Thursday, the team traveled to
Santa Cruz minus two key players

week road trip. Santa Cruz scored
first to take a 4-0 lead, but Stanford
came right back when Ann Latham
intercepted the ball from a Santa
Cruz line-out and took it in for the
try.
The final score came on a powerful
surge form the forward pack created
by the excellent play of Alex Rankin
and Ann Casscells. Casscells was
credited with the try, and Joan Saun
ders with the conversion kick which
gave Stanford the winning margin of
10-4
On Saturday, playing on their
home field and at full strength, the
ruggers easily defeated Sacramento
32-0. Ann Latham scored the first
three tries, the third coming on an as
sist by scrum-half Belinda Kremer,
who scored the next try herself.
Christina Ravello ended up with two
tries, and Suzie Shimeck took in the
final score of the game.
