Under nearly perfect rowing conditions, the Stanford
men's and women's crew teams stroked their way to
strong finishes in Saturday's opener at the River City
Regatta in Sacramento.
As expected, the novice women completely dominated
their event by finishing first and second, 28 seconds ahead
of third-place UC-Davis and 68 seconds ahead of fourth
place St. Mary's.
"It was a great race. We knew if we could just get it to
gether we could do it. We rowed really well," said fresh
man rower Wendy Allen.
The surprise of the day was how easily the Stanford-A
freshman eight were able to hold on to the lead ahead of
California to win their event.
"They (Cal) hung with us for so long we thought they
were toying with us. But every power-10 we'd move
ahead. It was very comfortable to feel the boat respond,"
said freshman Jay Finny.
Cal men won every other event, and Cal fans on the

race sidelines were especially surprised by the upset.
In the men's novice eight event, Stanford-A pulled to a
close second place, five seconds behind Cal, and Stanford-
B came in fourth behind Sacramento State.
The Stanford-B men's varsity eight placed third and
Stanford-A fourth behind Cal-A and Cal-B with the fast
est times of the day despite headwinds and tides that grew
stronger throughout the day.
The men's varsity four finished fourth in a boat that suf
fered from equipment problems during the day, behind
Cal, UOP and St. Mary's.
The same boat was used by the men's novice four in
their third-place finish behind Cal and St. Mary's.
When asked what he thought of Stanford's showings at
River City, Coach Flowwell said, "All of our boats rowed
a very aggressive race. They're well on their way to the
performance that I know that they're capable of that puts
them up on a national level."
Stanford's next major race will be March 30 against
Oregon State at Redwood Shores.
