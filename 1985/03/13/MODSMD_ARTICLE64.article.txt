It was a proud beginning for the Stanford men's basketball
team. Andy Fischer beamed with pleasure as he and the
workman-like Cardinal opened the season with an 8-2
record and a victory in the Apple Invitational. Keith Ramee
passed his way to the school's all-time record for assists and
John Paye passed from the football field to the hardwood.
But the Pacific 10 Conference was a slightly different story
for the team. Coach Tom Davis looked hard, but couldn't
find any way to avoid the first losing season of his coaching
career. The players kept putting their noses to the
grindstone, but ended up breaking them. In the end, the
Cardinal was backed into the conference cellar and ended
up 11-17.
