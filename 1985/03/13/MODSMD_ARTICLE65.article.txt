The Idea of Poverty:
England in the Early Industrial
Age
By Gertrude Himmelfarb
Vintage, 595 pp., $10.95
When one is a student at a col
legiate Club Med like Stanford, it is
very easy not to have any ideas about
poverty at all. Consequently, I began
reading Gertrude Himmelfarb's ac
count of the English working class
during the period 1750-1850 by
hoping that her book would, in a
healthy way, jolt me out of my
middle-class complacency. I quickly
discovered that this was not Himmel
farb's intention. "The Idea of
Poverty" is an (often fascinating)
analysis of the extent to which semi
nal economic, political and im
aginative writings of the "early indus
trial age" were pervaded by con
tradiction, ambiguity and ideology
masqueraded as scientific objectivity.
Curiously, though, the text that is
notorious in these respects is "The
Idea of Poverty" itself.
Accompanying the technological
changes of the Industrial Revolution
were equally revolutionary changes in
the way the economically com
fortable viewed the economically des
titute: Himmelfarb asserts that the
poverty preceding generations had
taken for granted as a condition or
dained by God or Nature suddenly
became a problem, a problem that
could or would no longer be relieved
by sporadic acts of private charity but
only by a state system of support.
Adam Smith's "The Wealth of Na
tions" is the first of Himmelfarb's
"revolutionary" books. Reading it in
tandem with Smith's earlier "Theory
of Moral Sentiments," Himmelfarb
attempts to defend the founding
father of capitalism against the charge
that his notion of the world-as
marketplace made for an amoral and
mechanistic world-view. Instead,
Himmelfarb argues, "The Wealth of
Nations" should be seen as a
response to this new "problem" of
poverty. It imagines a "moral eco
nomy," which through unfettered ex
pansion would increasingly benefit
just those laborers who were most
disadvantaged by the old mercan
tilism.
Himmelfarb sets up this paradisal
moral economy only to indicate in her
next section that, with the publication
of Malthus' "Essay on Population,"
this paradise was lost. English eco
nomic history — as Himmelfarb
reconstructs it — takes a wrong turn
when Malthus "demoralizes" politi
cal economy. Malthus mixed natural
science with economics: He pointed
out that, while the economy of
capitalism expanded and the pop
ulation of the labor force, as a conse
quence, increased, the food supply
remained constant. For Malthus, only
a limited number of seats were
available at nature's banquet, and to
let in the hungry would be to spoil
the party for everybody. To speak
without using Malthusian metaphors,

poverty was inevitable in every eco
nomy, and well-meaning efforts to
remedy the condition of the poor
would only end in insupportable in
creases in the population the eco
nomy sustained.
The impact of the essay was tre
mendous. Himmelfarb gives a grisly
account of a plan advanced by the
fanatical Malthusians to gas every
fourth child born in a poor family:
"The infants whose lives were to be
so mercifully extinguished were to be
buried in a park . . . [which would]
serve as a place of recreation and
edification for all classes ... a
veritable 'infant's' paradise." Thank
fully, no proto-Nazis came forward to
put this plan into practice. But the
politicians who drew up the New
Poor Law of 1834 did take seriously
Malthus' warning that dire conse
quenes would result from attempts to
do away with what he saw as the per
manent and necessary poverty of the
working class. The New Poor Law
was their attempt to ensure that the
poor that were recipients of parish
relief would live under conditions
"less eligible" than those they would
endure as independent laborers, no
matter how near starvation-level the
wages they would receive might be.
The "less eligible" conditions were
imprisonment in sexually-segregated
workhouses —institutions that can
easily be seen as anticipating 20th
century concentration camps and Or
well's "1984."
For Himmelfarb, England's mis
fortune was to have entered the In
dustrial Age with an economics
derived not from Smith, for whom
labor was a source of wealth, but
from Malthus, for whom poverty was
a necessary cause of labor.
Nineteenth-century society was thus
deprived of a morally accep
table economic theory.
(Unfortunately, Himmelfarb gets al
most as carried away as the designer
of the "infant's paradise" when she
claims in one passage that the English
literati — Coleridge, Hazlitt,
South, etc. — were culpable for the
inhumanity of 19th-century econom
ics — since, she argues, in attacking
Malthusianism they identified it with
capitalism per se.)
Himmelfarb devotes about half of
"The Idea Of Poverty"to assessing
the flurry of response Malthus and
Malthusian social policies provoked.
She discusses the writings of Cobbett
and Carlyle, who, though from their
respective standpoints of radicalism
and conservatism, both pressed for a
return to a quasi-feudal "golden
age," when charity was the right of
the poor and the duty of the rich; she
examines the loaded language of
Chadwick's "Sanitary Report,"
which, when discussing the unsanitary
conditions thought to have caused
cholera outbreaks, managed to talk
about sewage waste and the working
class in identical terms of
"residuum," "refuse" and "offal."
And, much less thoroughly, Himmel

farb discusses the political writings of
the radical working class, which at
tacked the very inequality — the
propertylessness of the laborer— that
gave (and gives) capitalism its foun
dation. (I should point out that for all
Himmelfarb's talk of returning to pri
mary texts and viewing the period on
its own terms, her selection of these

texts is arbitrary, incomplete and sus
piciously biased in favor of
capitalism.)
All these texts, regardless of their
political biases, were concerned with
what the Poor Law Report called the
"mischievous ambiguity of the word
'poor.' " The formulators of the New
Poor Law tried, in using the designa

tion "pauper," to separate semanti
cally those who labored from those
who wouldn't or couldn't, both
groups having been covered formerly
by the general rubric "poor." The
radicals of the 1830s, the Chartists of
the 1840s, redefined poverty as a po
litical as well as social problem; de
manding universal (male) suffrage.

calling themselves "the people," not
"the poor," they asserted the
centrality — not the marginality — of
their position in the polity. In the
1850s, the journalist Henry Mayhew
— still troubled by the generality of
the term "poor"— wrote an elabo
rate "Classification of the Workers
and Non-Workers of Great Britain";
he almost unconsciouslly suggested
the futility of attempts to eradicate
inequality, when, speaking of London
street-folk as "a race of nomads," he
redefined poverty as something
deeply rooted, natural, as innate.
The most mischievous of all am
biguities are, however, those in "The
Idea of Poverty" itself. Even the title
is mystifying: Whose idea of poverty
are we concerned with here? As I dis
covered, not the poor's idea of their
own poverty — because, for the most
part, the opinions Himmelfarb
reproduces are those of middle-class
men. In some sense, "The Idea of
Poverty" isn't about poverty at all,
but about historical method: Him
melfarb devotes much space to at
tacks on the "anti-intellectuahsm" of
practitioners of the new social history
(in England, populist historians like
E.P. Thompson; in France, scholars
of mentalite collective, such as
Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie) — his
torians who do try, as Himmelfarb
does not, to describe the experiences
of labor, hunger, illiteracy. Al
ternately, "The Idea of Poverty"
could be seen as an exercise in re
establishing and even laundering the
reputations of the economic theorists
ignored or maligned by these new his
torians. To the extent that poor
people are dealt with at all, it is as a
problem that the rich tried to solve.
Nowhere does Himmelfarb consider
that it might as truly be said that it is
the rich who constitute a problem for
the poor.
Though good reading, "The Idea of
Poverty" is finally troubling because
it offers consolation and com
placency: Himmelfarb really seems to
be saying that all the Victorians
worked earnestly and altruistically to
solve the problem of poverty. Our
tendency to see the early industrial
age — and our own capitalist times —
as periods of economic selfishness is
merely characteristic of a modern
sensibility which "can only register
failure not success." Conservatives'
self-congratulation is particularly
perturbing when it masquerades as
empathy for the poor. While 1 was
preparing this review. National Public
Radio broadcast a report that a group
of doctors has determined that there
are 20 million hungry people in the
United States. As I said, this book
didn't make me think about poverty;
that broadcast did.
This is a work for people who like
their history "Western Civilization
style" — that is, written by middle
class white men more interested in
"ideas" than poverty.

remedy the condition of the poor
would only end in insupportable in
creases in the population the eco
nomy sustained.
The impact of the essay was tre
mendous. Himmelfarb gives a grisly
account of a plan advanced by the
fanatical Malthusians to gas every
fourth child born in a poor family:
"The infants whose lives were to be
so mercifully extinguished were to be
buried in a park . . . [which would]
serve as a place of recreation and
edification for all classes ... a
veritable 'infant's' paradise." Thank
fully, no proto-Nazis came forward to
put this plan into practice. But the
politicians who drew up the New
Poor Law of 1834 did take seriously
Malthus' warning that dire conse
quenes would result from attempts to
do away with what he saw as the per
manent and necessary poverty of the
working class. The New Poor Law
was their attempt to ensure that the
poor that were recipients of parish
relief would live under conditions
"less eligible" than those they would
endure as independent laborers, no
matter how near starvation-level the
wages they would receive might be.
The "less eligible" conditions were
imprisonment in sexually-segregated
workhouses —institutions that can
easily be seen as anticipating 20th
century concentration camps and Or
well's "1984."
For Himmelfarb, England's mis
fortune was to have entered the In
dustrial Age with an economics
derived not from Smith, for whom
labor was a source of wealth, but
from Malthus, for whom poverty was
a necessary cause of labor.
Nineteenth-century society was thus
deprived of a morally accep
table economic theory.
(Unfortunately, Himmelfarb gets al
most as carried away as the designer
of the "infant's paradise" when she
claims in one passage that the English
literati — Coleridge, Hazlitt,
South, etc. — were culpable for the
inhumanity of 19th-century econom
ics — since, she argues, in attacking
Malthusianism they identified it with
capitalism per se.)
Himmelfarb devotes about half of
"The Idea Of Poverty"to assessing
the flurry of response Malthus and
Malthusian social policies provoked.
She discusses the writings of Cobbett
and Carlyle, who, though from their
respective standpoints of radicalism
and conservatism, both pressed for a
return to a quasi-feudal "golden
age," when charity was the right of
the poor and the duty of the rich; she
examines the loaded language of
Chadwick's "Sanitary Report,"
which, when discussing the unsanitary
conditions thought to have caused
cholera outbreaks, managed to talk
about sewage waste and the working
class in identical terms of
"residuum," "refuse" and "offal."
And, much less thoroughly, Himmel

farb discusses the political writings of
the radical working class, which at
tacked the very inequality — the
propertylessness of the laborer— that
gave (and gives) capitalism its foun
dation. (I should point out that for all
Himmelfarb's talk of returning to pri
mary texts and viewing the period on
its own terms, her selection of these

texts is arbitrary, incomplete and sus
piciously biased in favor of
capitalism.)
All these texts, regardless of their
political biases, were concerned with
what the Poor Law Report called the
"mischievous ambiguity of the word
'poor.' " The formulators of the New
Poor Law tried, in using the designa

tion "pauper," to separate semanti
cally those who labored from those
who wouldn't or couldn't, both
groups having been covered formerly
by the general rubric "poor." The
radicals of the 1830s, the Chartists of
the 1840s, redefined poverty as a po
litical as well as social problem; de
manding universal (male) suffrage.

calling themselves "the people," not
"the poor," they asserted the
centrality — not the marginality — of
their position in the polity. In the
1850s, the journalist Henry Mayhew
— still troubled by the generality of
the term "poor"— wrote an elabo
rate "Classification of the Workers
and Non-Workers of Great Britain";
he almost unconsciouslly suggested
the futility of attempts to eradicate
inequality, when, speaking of London
street-folk as "a race of nomads," he
redefined poverty as something
deeply rooted, natural, as innate.
The most mischievous of all am
biguities are, however, those in "The
Idea of Poverty" itself. Even the title
is mystifying: Whose idea of poverty
are we concerned with here? As I dis
covered, not the poor's idea of their
own poverty — because, for the most
part, the opinions Himmelfarb
reproduces are those of middle-class
men. In some sense, "The Idea of
Poverty" isn't about poverty at all,
but about historical method: Him
melfarb devotes much space to at
tacks on the "anti-intellectuahsm" of
practitioners of the new social history
(in England, populist historians like
E.P. Thompson; in France, scholars
of mentalite collective, such as
Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie) — his
torians who do try, as Himmelfarb
does not, to describe the experiences
of labor, hunger, illiteracy. Al
ternately, "The Idea of Poverty"
could be seen as an exercise in re
establishing and even laundering the
reputations of the economic theorists
ignored or maligned by these new his
torians. To the extent that poor
people are dealt with at all, it is as a
problem that the rich tried to solve.
Nowhere does Himmelfarb consider
that it might as truly be said that it is
the rich who constitute a problem for
the poor.
Though good reading, "The Idea of
Poverty" is finally troubling because
it offers consolation and com
placency: Himmelfarb really seems to
be saying that all the Victorians
worked earnestly and altruistically to
solve the problem of poverty. Our
tendency to see the early industrial
age — and our own capitalist times —
as periods of economic selfishness is
merely characteristic of a modern
sensibility which "can only register
failure not success." Conservatives'
self-congratulation is particularly
perturbing when it masquerades as
empathy for the poor. While 1 was
preparing this review. National Public
Radio broadcast a report that a group
of doctors has determined that there
are 20 million hungry people in the
United States. As I said, this book
didn't make me think about poverty;
that broadcast did.
This is a work for people who like
their history "Western Civilization
style" — that is, written by middle

"ideas" than poverty.

The Idea of Poverty:
England in the Early Industrial
Age
By Gertrude Himmelfarb
Vintage, 595 pp., $10.95
When one is a student at a col
legiate Club Med like Stanford, it is
very easy not to have any ideas about
poverty at all. Consequently, I began
reading Gertrude Himmelfarb's ac
count of the English working class
during the period 1750-1850 by
hoping that her book would, in a
healthy way, jolt me out of my
middle-class complacency. I quickly
discovered that this was not Himmel
farb's intention. "The Idea of
Poverty" is an (often fascinating)
analysis of the extent to which semi
nal economic, political and im
aginative writings of the "early indus
trial age" were pervaded by con
tradiction, ambiguity and ideology
masqueraded as scientific objectivity.
Curiously, though, the text that is
notorious in these respects is "The
Idea of Poverty" itself.
Accompanying the technological
changes of the Industrial Revolution
were equally revolutionary changes in
the way the economically com
fortable viewed the economically des
titute: Himmelfarb asserts that the
poverty preceding generations had
taken for granted as a condition or
dained by God or Nature suddenly
became a problem, a problem that
could or would no longer be relieved
by sporadic acts of private charity but
only by a state system of support.
Adam Smith's "The Wealth of Na
tions" is the first of Himmelfarb's
"revolutionary" books. Reading it in
tandem with Smith's earlier "Theory
of Moral Sentiments," Himmelfarb
attempts to defend the founding
father of capitalism against the charge
that his notion of the world-as
marketplace made for an amoral and
mechanistic world-view. Instead,
Himmelfarb argues, "The Wealth of
Nations" should be seen as a
response to this new "problem" of
poverty. It imagines a "moral eco
nomy," which through unfettered ex
pansion would increasingly benefit
just those laborers who were most
disadvantaged by the old mercan
tilism.
Himmelfarb sets up this paradisal
moral economy only to indicate in her
next section that, with the publication
of Malthus' "Essay on Population,"
this paradise was lost. English eco
nomic history — as Himmelfarb
reconstructs it — takes a wrong turn
when Malthus "demoralizes" politi
cal economy. Malthus mixed natural
science with economics: He pointed
out that, while the economy of
capitalism expanded and the pop
ulation of the labor force, as a conse
quence, increased, the food supply
remained constant. For Malthus, only
a limited number of seats were
available at nature's banquet, and to
let in the hungry would be to spoil
the party for everybody. To speak
without using Malthusian metaphors,

poverty was inevitable in every eco
nomy, and well-meaning efforts to
remedy the condition of the poor
would only end in insupportable in
creases in the population the eco
nomy sustained.
The impact of the essay was tre
mendous. Himmelfarb gives a grisly

propertylessness of the laborer— that
gave (and gives) capitalism its foun
dation. (I should point out that for all
Himmelfarb's talk of returning to pri
mary texts and viewing the period on
its own terms, her selection of these

texts is arbitrary, incomplete and sus
piciously biased in favor of
capitalism.)
All these texts, regardless of their
political biases, were concerned with
what the Poor Law Report called the
"mischievous ambiguity of the word
'poor.' " The formulators of the New
Poor Law tried, in using the designa

tion "pauper," to separate semanti
cally those who labored from those
who wouldn't or couldn't, both
groups having been covered formerly
by the general rubric "poor." The
radicals of the 1830s, the Chartists of
the 1840s, redefined poverty as a po
litical as well as social problem; de
manding universal (male) suffrage.

calling themselves "the people," not
"the poor," they asserted the
centrality — not the marginality — of
their position in the polity. In the
1850s, the journalist Henry Mayhew
— still troubled by the generality of
the term "poor"— wrote an elabo
rate "Classification of the Workers
and Non-Workers of Great Britain";
he almost unconsciouslly suggested
the futility of attempts to eradicate
inequality, when, speaking of London
street-folk as "a race of nomads," he
redefined poverty as something
deeply rooted, natural, as innate.
The most mischievous of all am
biguities are, however, those in "The
Idea of Poverty" itself. Even the title
is mystifying: Whose idea of poverty
are we concerned with here? As I dis
covered, not the poor's idea of their
own poverty — because, for the most
part, the opinions Himmelfarb
reproduces are those of middle-class
men. In some sense, "The Idea of
Poverty" isn't about poverty at all,
but about historical method: Him
melfarb devotes much space to at
tacks on the "anti-intellectuahsm" of
practitioners of the new social history
(in England, populist historians like
E.P. Thompson; in France, scholars
of mentalite collective, such as
Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie) — his
torians who do try, as Himmelfarb
does not, to describe the experiences
of labor, hunger, illiteracy. Al
ternately, "The Idea of Poverty"
could be seen as an exercise in re
establishing and even laundering the
reputations of the economic theorists
ignored or maligned by these new his
torians. To the extent that poor
people are dealt with at all, it is as a
problem that the rich tried to solve.
Nowhere does Himmelfarb consider
that it might as truly be said that it is
the rich who constitute a problem for
the poor.
Though good reading, "The Idea of
Poverty" is finally troubling because
it offers consolation and com
placency: Himmelfarb really seems to
be saying that all the Victorians
worked earnestly and altruistically to
solve the problem of poverty. Our
tendency to see the early industrial
age — and our own capitalist times —
as periods of economic selfishness is
merely characteristic of a modern
sensibility which "can only register
failure not success." Conservatives'
self-congratulation is particularly
perturbing when it masquerades as
empathy for the poor. While 1 was
preparing this review. National Public
Radio broadcast a report that a group
of doctors has determined that there
are 20 million hungry people in the
United States. As I said, this book
didn't make me think about poverty;
that broadcast did.
This is a work for people who like
their history "Western Civilization
style" — that is, written by middle

"ideas" than poverty.

The Idea of Poverty:
England in the Early Industrial
Age
By Gertrude Himmelfarb
Vintage, 595 pp., $10.95
When one is a student at a col
legiate Club Med like Stanford, it is
very easy not to have any ideas about
poverty at all. Consequently, I began
reading Gertrude Himmelfarb's ac
count of the English working class
during the period 1750-1850 by
hoping that her book would, in a
healthy way, jolt me out of my
middle-class complacency. I quickly
discovered that this was not Himmel
farb's intention. "The Idea of
Poverty" is an (often fascinating)
analysis of the extent to which semi
nal economic, political and im
aginative writings of the "early indus
trial age" were pervaded by con
tradiction, ambiguity and ideology
masqueraded as scientific objectivity.
Curiously, though, the text that is
notorious in these respects is "The
Idea of Poverty" itself.
Accompanying the technological
changes of the Industrial Revolution
were equally revolutionary changes in
the way the economically com
fortable viewed the economically des
titute: Himmelfarb asserts that the
poverty preceding generations had
taken for granted as a condition or
dained by God or Nature suddenly
became a problem, a problem that
could or would no longer be relieved
by sporadic acts of private charity but
only by a state system of support.
Adam Smith's "The Wealth of Na
tions" is the first of Himmelfarb's
"revolutionary" books. Reading it in
tandem with Smith's earlier "Theory
of Moral Sentiments," Himmelfarb
attempts to defend the founding
father of capitalism against the charge
that his notion of the world-as
marketplace made for an amoral and
mechanistic world-view. Instead,
Himmelfarb argues, "The Wealth of
Nations" should be seen as a
response to this new "problem" of
poverty. It imagines a "moral eco
nomy," which through unfettered ex
pansion would increasingly benefit
just those laborers who were most
disadvantaged by the old mercan
tilism.
Himmelfarb sets up this paradisal
moral economy only to indicate in her
next section that, with the publication
of Malthus' "Essay on Population,"
this paradise was lost. English eco
nomic history — as Himmelfarb
reconstructs it — takes a wrong turn
when Malthus "demoralizes" politi
cal economy. Malthus mixed natural
science with economics: He pointed
out that, while the economy of
capitalism expanded and the pop
ulation of the labor force, as a conse
quence, increased, the food supply
remained constant. For Malthus, only
a limited number of seats were
available at nature's banquet, and to
let in the hungry would be to spoil
the party for everybody. To speak
without using Malthusian metaphors,

poverty was inevitable in every eco
nomy, and well-meaning efforts to
remedy the condition of the poor
would only end in insupportable in
creases in the population the eco
nomy sustained.
The impact of the essay was tre
mendous. Himmelfarb gives a grisly
account of a plan advanced by the
fanatical Malthusians to gas every
fourth child born in a poor family:
"The infants whose lives were to be
so mercifully extinguished were to be
buried in a park . . . [which would]
serve as a place of recreation and
edification for all classes ... a
veritable 'infant's' paradise." Thank
fully, no proto-Nazis came forward to
put this plan into practice. But the
politicians who drew up the New
Poor Law of 1834 did take seriously
Malthus' warning that dire conse
quenes would result from attempts to
do away with what he saw as the per
manent and necessary poverty of the
working class. The New Poor Law
was their attempt to ensure that the
poor that were recipients of parish
relief would live under conditions
"less eligible" than those they would
endure as independent laborers, no
matter how near starvation-level the
wages they would receive might be.
The "less eligible" conditions were
imprisonment in sexually-segregated
workhouses —institutions that can
easily be seen as anticipating 20th
century concentration camps and Or
well's "1984."
For Himmelfarb, England's mis
fortune was to have entered the In
dustrial Age with an economics
derived not from Smith, for whom
labor was a source of wealth, but
from Malthus, for whom poverty was
a necessary cause of labor.
Nineteenth-century society was thus
deprived of a morally accep
table economic theory.
(Unfortunately, Himmelfarb gets al
most as carried away as the designer
of the "infant's paradise" when she
claims in one passage that the English
literati — Coleridge, Hazlitt,
South, etc. — were culpable for the
inhumanity of 19th-century econom
ics — since, she argues, in attacking
Malthusianism they identified it with
capitalism per se.)
Himmelfarb devotes about half of
"The Idea Of Poverty"to assessing
the flurry of response Malthus and
Malthusian social policies provoked.
She discusses the writings of Cobbett
and Carlyle, who, though from their
respective standpoints of radicalism
and conservatism, both pressed for a
return to a quasi-feudal "golden
age," when charity was the right of
the poor and the duty of the rich; she
examines the loaded language of
Chadwick's "Sanitary Report,"
which, when discussing the unsanitary
conditions thought to have caused
cholera outbreaks, managed to talk
about sewage waste and the working
class in identical terms of
"residuum," "refuse" and "offal."
And, much less thoroughly, Himmel

farb discusses the political writings of
the radical working class, which at
tacked the very inequality — the
propertylessness of the laborer— that
gave (and gives) capitalism its foun
dation. (I should point out that for all
Himmelfarb's talk of returning to pri
mary texts and viewing the period on
its own terms, her selection of these

texts is arbitrary, incomplete and sus
piciously biased in favor of
capitalism.)
