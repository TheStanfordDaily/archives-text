"Not in Our Genes"
By R.C. Lewontin, Steven Rose
and Leon Kamin
Pantheon, 322 pp., $8.95.
Are Stanford students genetically
superior to waitresses at Taco Bell?
Are schizophrenics, panhandlers,
bank executives and manic
depressives born and not made?
Ever since Darwin, scientists and
sociologists have been arguing
whether humans are the product of
heredity or environment. For biologi
cal "determinists," our destiny is in
our genes. Determinists argue that
genetic makeup determines one's in
telligence, social status and even
sanity. Carried to its extremes, deter
minism rationalizes not only the bio
logical status quo, but the structure of
society as well; we are predetermined
products, determinists argue, so there
is no use quibbling about the result.
"Not In Our Genes," a book co
written by R.C. Lewontin, Steven
Rose and Leon Kamin, tries to show
how determinism evolved and where
determinists went wrong. The authors
argue that anyone who believes that
genes or environment alone
determines one's future is being
simplistic. They suggest that man is a
product of a combination of heredity,
environment and forces which
modern science rationalizes but does
not understand.
The argument is not a new one, but
the book's approach is fresh. Instead
of tracing the origins of determinism
to Darwin, "In Our Genes" pushes
back even farther. In a chapter called
"Bourgeois Identity and The Origin
Of Determinsm," the authors suggest
that determinism is an outgrowth not
of 19th-century thought, but of early
bourgeois ideology.
When feudal society dissolved, so
cial mobility became possible for the
first time. Instead of "artificial" social
structures, the middle class relied on
the "natural" social structure of the
free market. Here, for the first time,
it became possible for men to think
that all men had equal opportunity.
The fact that there still was sortie so
cial inequality suggested that those
who climbed to the top of the ladder
were somehow superior to those who
remained on the bottom.
After Darwin, the authors say, sci
entists, philosophers, businessmen
and literati had an ideology to sup
port the status quo of 19th-century
society. "Social Darwinism," the idea
that everday life imitates the evolu
tionary process, found its way into
Emile Zola's novels, Fuerbach's phil
osophy and John Rockefeller's wit
ticisms.
In the 20th century, "Social Dar
winism" gradually evolved into deter
minism. By the mid-20th century,
determinists could claim that the race
riots of the 1960s were the products
of a few genetically "damaged"
ringleaders inciting the public, and
their claims would be legitimized, if
not validated, by a century of
"science" behind them.

After givng a historical perspective,
Lewontin, Rose and Kamin turn to
contemporary issues. The majority of
the book is devoted to disputing a se
ries of determinist "myths" concern
ing the relevance of intelligence test
ing, the role of gender in society and
the treatment of the mentally ill with
pyschoactive medication.
The authors contradict deter
minists by showing that studies scien
tists have conducted to prove the
heritability of intelligence and schizo
phrenia have often been misleading,
misrepresented or just plain wrong.
For example, the English scientist
Cyril Burt conducted a series of ex
periments with identical twins, at
tempting to prove that twins
separated from each other at birth
and placed in different social settings
performed the same on intelligence
tests. These studies, which were for
years "the most satisfactory attempt"
to prove the heritability of intelli
gence, were discovered to be largely a
forgery; it was proved later that Burt
made up a lot of his data and that his
"separated" twins were often raised
by relatives in the same town.
Besides arguing with the idea that
certain traits are hereditary, the aut
hors claim that it is difficult, if not
impossible, to prove that psychologi
cal problems can be cured by
" repairing" damaged genes or chemi
cal imbalances. The theory that the
chemical balance of the brain controls
man's emotions and actions has led to
the belief that behavior can be
modified with corrective drugs.
Ritalin. Valium, lithium and other
pyschoactive drugs are the biggest
sellers for pharmaceutical companies.
Lithium and Valium are staples for
psychiatrists and doctors, and Ritalin
has been used widely since the mid
'6os to "control" hyperactive
children in public schools.
The authors cite statistics that show

just how widely these drugs are used;
in the United Kingdom, psychoactive
drugs are so popular that there is one
prescription in existence for every
member of the population. They then
assert that these drugs may seem to
correct MBD (minimal brain dys
function) disorders, but they actually
do not. Patients may seem to be
"cured," but the disappearance of
symptoms does not mean the disap
pearance of the disease. Attempting
to control a person's behavior by con
trolling certain chemicals in his mind,
the authors claim, is like "the work of
a saboteur pulling out random
printed circuit boards from a com
puter."
"Not In Our Genes" is billed as a
combination of "biology, ideology
and human nature." The prose style
of the book suggests that, for these
authors at least, it is a queer combina
tion. The first few chapters (the ideol
ogy part) are filled with generaliza
tions, name-drops and cursory des
criptions of contemporary social
crises. But when the authors turn
from social to scientific issues, they
inevitably become more detailed and
specific; they begin to discuss studies

by various scientists, dispute them
with charts, diagrams and appropriate
jargon. In the final two chapters of
the book, Lewontin, Rose and Kamin
return to discussing ideology and the
prose "vagues out" once again.
After attacking various claims of
determinists, the authors warn the
reader against the claims of a new sci
ence — sociobiology. Sociobiology
first came to light in 1975, they say,
when E.O. Wilson published
"Sociobiology: The New Synthesis."
An attempt to combine biology, an
thropology and sociology, sociobiol
ogy gathers all disparate determinist
ideology under the comfortable hood
of a new science. Sociobiologists
claim that there are cultural
"universals" as diverse as cooking,
athletics and religion, which have
been established through natural se
lection during human evolution.
These universals are coded for in the
human genotype.
Wilson's book is treated with
holier-than-thou sarcasm. The aut
hors remark:
A 600-page book filled with such
subjects as mathematical population
genetics, neurobiology, and primate
taxonomy . . . does not often make the
pages of House and Garden, Reader's
Digest, and People Magazine.
After the book was published, they
explain, "Sociobiological explana
tions began to appear in the literature
of economics and political science,
and Business Week offered 'a genetic
defense of the free market.' "
It is clear why Lewontin, Rose and
Kamin disagree with the determinist
element of sociobiology. However,
some of their conclusions about the
science are drawn from doubtful
evidence. For example, they imply
Wilson's book was unscientific be
cause it was mass-marketed. The aut
hors' tendency to suggest that a sci
ence may be illegitimate because it is
so readily accessible hinders their
arguments against sociobiology. In the
same way, their argument that an
idea is false because its application
may be unethical works against the
rhetoric in other parts of the book.
One can be concerned that, "in the
late 1970s there were still women in
British hospitals who had been
confined since the 1930s for the
'madness' of having illegitimate
children," but it does not follow that
since this is the result of the
"medicalized ideology of biological
determinism," the ideology itself
must be wrong.
Although the authors go a long way
in disproving determinist theory, they
offer very little proof to support what
they themselves believe. In fact, there
are only one or two sentences in "Not
In Our Genes" that explain what, if
anything, should take the place of
determinist theory. After 300 pages
of negation, the authors merely con
clude that we are "the outcomes of an
extraordinary multiplicity of inter
secting causal passageways."

prose "vagues out" once again.
After attacking various claims of
determinists, the authors warn the
reader against the claims of a new sci
ence — sociobiology. Sociobiology
first came to light in 1975, they say,
when E.O. Wilson published
"Sociobiology: The New Synthesis."
An attempt to combine biology, an
thropology and sociology, sociobiol
ogy gathers all disparate determinist
ideology under the comfortable hood
of a new science. Sociobiologists
claim that there are cultural
"universals" as diverse as cooking,
athletics and religion, which have
been established through natural se
lection during human evolution.
These universals are coded for in the
human genotype.
Wilson's book is treated with
holier-than-thou sarcasm. The aut
hors remark:
A 600-page book filled with such
subjects as mathematical population
genetics, neurobiology, and primate
taxonomy . . . does not often make the
pages of House and Garden, Reader's
Digest, and People Magazine.
After the book was published, they
explain, "Sociobiological explana
tions began to appear in the literature
of economics and political science,
and Business Week offered 'a genetic
defense of the free market.' "
It is clear why Lewontin, Rose and
Kamin disagree with the determinist
element of sociobiology. However,
some of their conclusions about the
science are drawn from doubtful
evidence. For example, they imply
Wilson's book was unscientific be
cause it was mass-marketed. The aut
hors' tendency to suggest that a sci
ence may be illegitimate because it is
so readily accessible hinders their
arguments against sociobiology. In the
same way, their argument that an
idea is false because its application
may be unethical works against the
rhetoric in other parts of the book.
One can be concerned that, "in the
late 1970s there were still women in
British hospitals who had been
confined since the 1930s for the
'madness' of having illegitimate
children," but it does not follow that
since this is the result of the
"medicalized ideology of biological
determinism," the ideology itself
must be wrong.
Although the authors go a long way
in disproving determinist theory, they
offer very little proof to support what
they themselves believe. In fact, there
are only one or two sentences in "Not
In Our Genes" that explain what, if
anything, should take the place of
determinist theory. After 300 pages

"Not in Our Genes"
By R.C. Lewontin, Steven Rose
and Leon Kamin
Pantheon, 322 pp., $8.95.
Are Stanford students genetically
superior to waitresses at Taco Bell?
Are schizophrenics, panhandlers,
bank executives and manic
depressives born and not made?
Ever since Darwin, scientists and
sociologists have been arguing
whether humans are the product of
heredity or environment. For biologi
cal "determinists," our destiny is in
our genes. Determinists argue that
genetic makeup determines one's in
telligence, social status and even
sanity. Carried to its extremes, deter
minism rationalizes not only the bio
logical status quo, but the structure of
society as well; we are predetermined
products, determinists argue, so there
is no use quibbling about the result.
"Not In Our Genes," a book co
written by R.C. Lewontin, Steven
Rose and Leon Kamin, tries to show
how determinism evolved and where
determinists went wrong. The authors
argue that anyone who believes that
genes or environment alone
determines one's future is being
simplistic. They suggest that man is a
product of a combination of heredity,
environment and forces which
modern science rationalizes but does
not understand.
The argument is not a new one, but
the book's approach is fresh. Instead
of tracing the origins of determinism
to Darwin, "In Our Genes" pushes
back even farther. In a chapter called
"Bourgeois Identity and The Origin
Of Determinsm," the authors suggest
that determinism is an outgrowth not
of 19th-century thought, but of early
bourgeois ideology.
When feudal society dissolved, so
cial mobility became possible for the
first time. Instead of "artificial" social
structures, the middle class relied on
the "natural" social structure of the
free market. Here, for the first time,
it became possible for men to think
that all men had equal opportunity.
The fact that there still was sortie so
cial inequality suggested that those
who climbed to the top of the ladder
were somehow superior to those who
remained on the bottom.
After Darwin, the authors say, sci
entists, philosophers, businessmen
and literati had an ideology to sup
port the status quo of 19th-century
society. "Social Darwinism," the idea
that everday life imitates the evolu
tionary process, found its way into
Emile Zola's novels, Fuerbach's phil
osophy and John Rockefeller's wit
ticisms.
In the 20th century, "Social Dar
winism" gradually evolved into deter
minism. By the mid-20th century,
determinists could claim that the race
riots of the 1960s were the products
of a few genetically "damaged"
ringleaders inciting the public, and
their claims would be legitimized, if
not validated, by a century of
"science" behind them.

After givng a historical perspective,
Lewontin, Rose and Kamin turn to
contemporary issues. The majority of
the book is devoted to disputing a se
ries of determinist "myths" concern
ing the relevance of intelligence test
ing, the role of gender in society and
the treatment of the mentally ill with
pyschoactive medication.
The authors contradict deter
minists by showing that studies scien
tists have conducted to prove the
heritability of intelligence and schizo
phrenia have often been misleading,
misrepresented or just plain wrong.
For example, the English scientist
Cyril Burt conducted a series of ex
periments with identical twins, at
tempting to prove that twins
separated from each other at birth
and placed in different social settings
performed the same on intelligence
tests. These studies, which were for
years "the most satisfactory attempt"
to prove the heritability of intelli
gence, were discovered to be largely a
forgery; it was proved later that Burt
made up a lot of his data and that his
"separated" twins were often raised
by relatives in the same town.
Besides arguing with the idea that
certain traits are hereditary, the aut
hors claim that it is difficult, if not
impossible, to prove that psychologi
cal problems can be cured by
" repairing" damaged genes or chemi
cal imbalances. The theory that the
chemical balance of the brain controls
man's emotions and actions has led to
the belief that behavior can be
modified with corrective drugs.
Ritalin. Valium, lithium and other
pyschoactive drugs are the biggest
sellers for pharmaceutical companies.
Lithium and Valium are staples for
psychiatrists and doctors, and Ritalin
has been used widely since the mid
'6os to "control" hyperactive
children in public schools.
The authors cite statistics that show

just how widely these drugs are used;
in the United Kingdom, psychoactive
drugs are so popular that there is one
prescription in existence for every
member of the population. They then
assert that these drugs may seem to
correct MBD (minimal brain dys
function) disorders, but they actually
do not. Patients may seem to be
"cured," but the disappearance of
symptoms does not mean the disap
pearance of the disease. Attempting
to control a person's behavior by con
trolling certain chemicals in his mind,
the authors claim, is like "the work of
a saboteur pulling out random
printed circuit boards from a com
puter."
"Not In Our Genes" is billed as a
combination of "biology, ideology
and human nature." The prose style
of the book suggests that, for these
authors at least, it is a queer combina
tion. The first few chapters (the ideol
ogy part) are filled with generaliza
tions, name-drops and cursory des
criptions of contemporary social
crises. But when the authors turn
from social to scientific issues, they
inevitably become more detailed and
specific; they begin to discuss studies

by various scientists, dispute them
with charts, diagrams and appropriate
jargon. In the final two chapters of
the book, Lewontin, Rose and Kamin
return to discussing ideology and the
prose "vagues out" once again.
After attacking various claims of
determinists, the authors warn the

tists have conducted to prove the
heritability of intelligence and schizo
phrenia have often been misleading,
misrepresented or just plain wrong.
For example, the English scientist
Cyril Burt conducted a series of ex
periments with identical twins, at
tempting to prove that twins
separated from each other at birth
and placed in different social settings
performed the same on intelligence
tests. These studies, which were for
years "the most satisfactory attempt"
to prove the heritability of intelli
gence, were discovered to be largely a
forgery; it was proved later that Burt
made up a lot of his data and that his
"separated" twins were often raised
by relatives in the same town.
Besides arguing with the idea that
certain traits are hereditary, the aut
hors claim that it is difficult, if not
impossible, to prove that psychologi
cal problems can be cured by
" repairing" damaged genes or chemi
cal imbalances. The theory that the
chemical balance of the brain controls
man's emotions and actions has led to
the belief that behavior can be
modified with corrective drugs.
Ritalin. Valium, lithium and other
pyschoactive drugs are the biggest
sellers for pharmaceutical companies.
Lithium and Valium are staples for
psychiatrists and doctors, and Ritalin
has been used widely since the mid
'6os to "control" hyperactive
children in public schools.
The authors cite statistics that show

just how widely these drugs are used;
in the United Kingdom, psychoactive
drugs are so popular that there is one
prescription in existence for every
member of the population. They then
assert that these drugs may seem to
correct MBD (minimal brain dys
function) disorders, but they actually
do not. Patients may seem to be
"cured," but the disappearance of
symptoms does not mean the disap
pearance of the disease. Attempting
to control a person's behavior by con
trolling certain chemicals in his mind,
the authors claim, is like "the work of
a saboteur pulling out random
printed circuit boards from a com
puter."
"Not In Our Genes" is billed as a
combination of "biology, ideology
and human nature." The prose style
of the book suggests that, for these
authors at least, it is a queer combina
tion. The first few chapters (the ideol
ogy part) are filled with generaliza
tions, name-drops and cursory des
criptions of contemporary social
crises. But when the authors turn
from social to scientific issues, they
inevitably become more detailed and
specific; they begin to discuss studies

by various scientists, dispute them
with charts, diagrams and appropriate
jargon. In the final two chapters of
the book, Lewontin, Rose and Kamin
return to discussing ideology and the
prose "vagues out" once again.
After attacking various claims of
determinists, the authors warn the
reader against the claims of a new sci
ence — sociobiology. Sociobiology
first came to light in 1975, they say,
when E.O. Wilson published
"Sociobiology: The New Synthesis."
An attempt to combine biology, an
thropology and sociology, sociobiol
ogy gathers all disparate determinist
ideology under the comfortable hood
of a new science. Sociobiologists
claim that there are cultural
"universals" as diverse as cooking,
athletics and religion, which have
been established through natural se
lection during human evolution.
These universals are coded for in the
human genotype.
Wilson's book is treated with
holier-than-thou sarcasm. The aut
hors remark:
A 600-page book filled with such
subjects as mathematical population
genetics, neurobiology, and primate
taxonomy . . . does not often make the
pages of House and Garden, Reader's
Digest, and People Magazine.
After the book was published, they
explain, "Sociobiological explana
tions began to appear in the literature
of economics and political science,
and Business Week offered 'a genetic
defense of the free market.' "
It is clear why Lewontin, Rose and
Kamin disagree with the determinist
element of sociobiology. However,
some of their conclusions about the
science are drawn from doubtful
evidence. For example, they imply
Wilson's book was unscientific be
cause it was mass-marketed. The aut
hors' tendency to suggest that a sci
ence may be illegitimate because it is
so readily accessible hinders their
arguments against sociobiology. In the
same way, their argument that an
idea is false because its application
may be unethical works against the
rhetoric in other parts of the book.
One can be concerned that, "in the
late 1970s there were still women in
British hospitals who had been
confined since the 1930s for the
'madness' of having illegitimate
children," but it does not follow that
since this is the result of the
"medicalized ideology of biological
determinism," the ideology itself
must be wrong.
Although the authors go a long way
in disproving determinist theory, they
offer very little proof to support what
they themselves believe. In fact, there
are only one or two sentences in "Not
In Our Genes" that explain what, if
anything, should take the place of
determinist theory. After 300 pages
of negation, the authors merely con
clude that we are "the outcomes of an
extraordinary multiplicity of inter
secting causal passageways."
