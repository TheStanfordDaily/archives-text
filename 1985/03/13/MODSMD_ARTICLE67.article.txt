## '42nd Street' dazzles with sheer entertainment 
### JUJU CHANG 
I've never been to New York or
seen a Broadway show for that mat
ter, but "42nd Street," complete with
dancing girls, gave me a good feel for
the glamour of a grandstand Broad
way production. The curtain rises on
40 pairs of legs (better known as
hoofers) all tap dancing madly. The
Golden Gate Theatre is flooded with
what sounds like hailstones on a tin
roof. The goosebumps start there
and have little opportunity to go
away as the show gives you much of
the same throughout.
"42nd Street" is a Cinderella story
of an ambitious chorus girl's lucky
break to stardom. But the storyline is
simply the showcase for glitzy
costumes, cutesy props and spectacu
lar dancing. The flashy dance num
bers evoke a spirited tribute to the
high-stakes, fast-action pace of
Broadway in the post-Depression
'30s.
"42nd Street's" song and dance
numbers like "We're in the Money"
and"The Lullaby of Broadway"»are
classics that are enthusiastically
recreated for a new generation of
theater-goers. These numbers have
all the charm of old Busby Berkely or
Fred Astaire movies, the kind that
Hollywood only has in archives.
The action is live; it's right there in

front of you to gaze and wonder at.
That's the magic of stage, how
movies fall short. Shows can do what
period books or films cannot: give a
live presentation of a bygone era.
Shows like "42nd Street" bring back
earlier traditons with added vitality.
The grandeur can be felt full-force
and it brings with it an all too often
forgotten idea of optimism.

plays the new-found starlet, is the
story line of "42nd Street" per
sonified. She was the understudy for
the role last year in it Los Angeles
run. She puts in a strong performance
as Peggy Sawyer in the San Francisco
showing.
The acting is theatrical in the sense
that it's often exaggerated for the
benefit of the back row. The cast,
however, reflects a certain im
balance. The players lack an inter

personal chemistry that may simply
belie the perfunctory nature of
nightly performances.
Regardless, the show's focus is on
the ensemble dance routines that can
only be called "grand." In addition,
the show employs lighting techniques
with a very unique flair. In one dance
number, a screen projects shadows of
the dancers that grow large and small
as they twirl and leap across the
stage.
Along with lighting effects, the sets
were ingeniously designed to use
both vertical and horizontal space.
One scene showed a confrontation on
the second floor of a hotel with a
party in progress below. Another
scene had draped traincar sleepers
that opened to reveal the chorus girls
in doubler-deckered compartments.
And still another scene used 40
screened windows, like the ones used
on "Hollywood Squares," that would
light up as a singer or group of singers
performed "Sunny Side to Every Sit
uation."
With the minor exception of the
acting, "42nd Street" is a wonderful
entertainment piece. No heavy
message, no psychological inquiry,
just good old-fashioned fun.
"42nd Street" plays through April
28 at the Golden Gate Theatre in San
Francisco.
