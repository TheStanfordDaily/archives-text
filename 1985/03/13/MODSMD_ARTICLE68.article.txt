# Sculpture show worth a trip
## 
### MARILYN WANN 
If the Burghers of Calais are old,
too-familiar friends, and San Fran
cisco art galleries are too far away for
a convenient browse, the Palo Alto
Cultural Center's sculpture exhibit
entitled "By Design" has an answer.
There are three shows currently on
exhibit. A jubilantly colorful two
piece neon work entitled "Monit Au
Lumio" and a playful collection of 14
contemporary artists working on the
theme "Unity of Opposites: Art
About Architecture" are both spa
ciously displayed for serious viewers.
In a side room, the show
"Sculpture/Structure/Space" creates
an interactive environment that ed
ucates its participants about new ap
proaches to technique and media. It's
more fun than Tinker Toys and you
won't be carded if you look over 12
years old.
The center's doors open to "The
Passage of Euydice, Part One," an 8-
by-10-foot latticework archway em
bellished with snail trails and sonic
booms of colorful light. It hums softly

to its viewers, evoking images of the
electricity crackling up wires in a mad
scientist's lab, a mood of free ex
perimentation.
Its companion piece, "Orpheus
Descending, Part Two," is a comple
mentary opposite, sliding down the
back wall in charcoal tones, a study in
the bulk of a stick figure and the ap
peal of a jittering, frenzied line.
Cathy and David Stone, the
husband-wife team from Sacramento
who created this piece, call their art
"non-representational, romantic." It
is also daring, whimsically challenging
the viewer to try to give it a static
meaning.
"We don't find many people of any
uncertainty about it," Cathy Stone
said about the reactions neon art
receives. Curator Diana Chadwick
recalled one incident in which some
of the center's volunteers witnessed a
young man silently dancing around
the pieces as he viewed them. "He
was definitely transformed," she said.
The artists are succeeding at
evoking the strong reactions they

seek. Cathy Stone listed her goals as
"breaking down traditional barriers,
causing people to question."
She is careful to maintain the divi
sion between her neon art and doing
commercial neon signs. "It's very
tempting," she said, explaining that
since she's been showing her work,
people have started asking her to do
pieces for their store windows. "It's a
fine line." She is grateful for the com
mercial side, though, because it
makes neon art less alien when
people do see it for the first time.
"Every boutique and restaurant has a
hunk of neon in it," she mused.
The Stones actually employ a
signmaker to craft their sculpture.
Their designs are converted into
molds around which the heated glass
tubes can be bent and then filled with
mixtures of four gases and coated
with phosphorescent powders to
achieve the different hues.
After acclimating to the newness of
these pieces, the rest of the exhibit is
a logical outgrowth of artistic ideas.
Remember losing your fear of

roller coasters, when you could finally
raise your arms and scream at each
surprising new twist? The center's
largest collection recreates that
feeling.
The ride starts its slow ascent to a
plateau of new ideas and perceptions
with Tom Loeser's "Chair" and
"Chest," two more creations in shape
and color. The chair is a green and
pink confection of right angles and
hinged flaps, and the chest is a stack
of shoebox drawers supported by a
stable tripod quilted in squares of 64-
pack Crayola Crayon colors.
A little girl, on stopping at this first
display a moment, announced,
"That's a chair!?" before drifting
away. She missed the artist's renova
tion of our dilapidated everyday per
ception.
The show continues with 25 more
pieces of varying joviality and fan
tasy.
Douglas Moran seemingly carves a
plywood-jutting, foam-filled slice out
of a house under construction to
bring "Diplomat" to witty life.

Other works seem like miniature
models for much larger structures.
Christopher Lee's "Great Curve"
stacks about two feet of green glass in
a sparkling semicircle shard, while
Louis Lieber raises towers that look
like monumental wedding cake tops
floating amid pastel cloud layers, airy
pillars of speculation.
Another, "Sculpture To Span A
Passageway," is a finished structure
by George Sugarman that does just
what it says it will, in such a fitting
way that the aluminum, carnation
like form with cauliflower tendencies
seems the only shape that could exist
in that space.

Other pieces stick to the walls and
reveal small corners of the world un
der glass. Laddie John Dill's "Untitled
Cement Reliefs" capture the worlds
of a parking lot gas puddle, while
down the wall a bit Barbara Rogers
paints science fiction gardens for your
imagination's strolling pleasure.
The wall and floor space of this
show is limited, but it is just the right
size for an hour's contemplation, and
a more dietetic study break can't be
found.
The "By Design" shows will run
through April 14 and the neon pieces
will remain on display until March 24.

theme "Unity of Opposites: Art
About Architecture" are both spa
ciously displayed for serious viewers.
In a side room, the show
"Sculpture/Structure/Space" creates
an interactive environment that ed
ucates its participants about new ap
proaches to technique and media. It's
more fun than Tinker Toys and you
won't be carded if you look over 12
years old.
The center's doors open to "The
Passage of Euydice, Part One," an 8-
by-10-foot latticework archway em
bellished with snail trails and sonic
booms of colorful light. It hums softly

to its viewers, evoking images of the
electricity crackling up wires in a mad
scientist's lab, a mood of free ex
perimentation.
Its companion piece, "Orpheus
Descending, Part Two," is a comple
mentary opposite, sliding down the
back wall in charcoal tones, a study in
the bulk of a stick figure and the ap
peal of a jittering, frenzied line.
Cathy and David Stone, the
husband-wife team from Sacramento
who created this piece, call their art
"non-representational, romantic." It
is also daring, whimsically challenging
the viewer to try to give it a static
meaning.
"We don't find many people of any
uncertainty about it," Cathy Stone
said about the reactions neon art
receives. Curator Diana Chadwick
recalled one incident in which some
of the center's volunteers witnessed a
young man silently dancing around
the pieces as he viewed them. "He
was definitely transformed," she said.
The artists are succeeding at
evoking the strong reactions they

seek. Cathy Stone listed her goals as
"breaking down traditional barriers,
causing people to question."
She is careful to maintain the divi
sion between her neon art and doing
commercial neon signs. "It's very
tempting," she said, explaining that
since she's been showing her work,
people have started asking her to do
pieces for their store windows. "It's a
fine line." She is grateful for the com
mercial side, though, because it
makes neon art less alien when
people do see it for the first time.
"Every boutique and restaurant has a
hunk of neon in it," she mused.
The Stones actually employ a
signmaker to craft their sculpture.
Their designs are converted into
molds around which the heated glass
tubes can be bent and then filled with
mixtures of four gases and coated
with phosphorescent powders to
achieve the different hues.
After acclimating to the newness of
these pieces, the rest of the exhibit is
a logical outgrowth of artistic ideas.
Remember losing your fear of

roller coasters, when you could finally
raise your arms and scream at each
surprising new twist? The center's
largest collection recreates that
feeling.
The ride starts its slow ascent to a
plateau of new ideas and perceptions
with Tom Loeser's "Chair" and
"Chest," two more creations in shape
and color. The chair is a green and
pink confection of right angles and
hinged flaps, and the chest is a stack
of shoebox drawers supported by a
stable tripod quilted in squares of 64-
pack Crayola Crayon colors.
A little girl, on stopping at this first
display a moment, announced,
"That's a chair!?" before drifting
away. She missed the artist's renova
tion of our dilapidated everyday per
ception.
The show continues with 25 more
pieces of varying joviality and fan
tasy.
Douglas Moran seemingly carves a
plywood-jutting, foam-filled slice out
of a house under construction to
bring "Diplomat" to witty life.

Other works seem like miniature
models for much larger structures.
Christopher Lee's "Great Curve"
stacks about two feet of green glass in
a sparkling semicircle shard, while
Louis Lieber raises towers that look
like monumental wedding cake tops
floating amid pastel cloud layers, airy
pillars of speculation.
Another, "Sculpture To Span A
Passageway," is a finished structure
by George Sugarman that does just
what it says it will, in such a fitting
way that the aluminum, carnation
like form with cauliflower tendencies
seems the only shape that could exist
in that space.

Other pieces stick to the walls and
reveal small corners of the world un
der glass. Laddie John Dill's "Untitled
Cement Reliefs" capture the worlds
of a parking lot gas puddle, while
down the wall a bit Barbara Rogers
paints science fiction gardens for your
imagination's strolling pleasure.
The wall and floor space of this
show is limited, but it is just the right
size for an hour's contemplation, and
a more dietetic study break can't be
found.
The "By Design" shows will run
through April 14 and the neon pieces
will remain on display until March 24.

If the Burghers of Calais are old,
too-familiar friends, and San Fran
cisco art galleries are too far away for
a convenient browse, the Palo Alto
Cultural Center's sculpture exhibit
entitled "By Design" has an answer.
There are three shows currently on
exhibit. A jubilantly colorful two
piece neon work entitled "Monit Au
Lumio" and a playful collection of 14
contemporary artists working on the
theme "Unity of Opposites: Art
About Architecture" are both spa
ciously displayed for serious viewers.
