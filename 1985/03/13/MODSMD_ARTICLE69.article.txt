By CHRISTOPHER NERNEY
The Sure Thing,' Rob Reiner's second
directorial effort, is a heartwarming romantic
comedy about an unlikely pair of New En
gland college students who fall in love while
traveling cross-country to Los Angeles during
Christmas break.
The tilm is part campus comedy and part
"road" picture. Indeed, some critics see plot
similarities between "Sure Thing" and Frank
Capra's "It Happened One Night." This isn't
bad company to keep — the 1934 Capra road
classic is one of only two films ever to have

Despite the usual col
lege pranks — flashing
moons, wild dorm
parties and lots of
beer drinking — 'The
Sure Thing' portrays
the lives and loves of
teenagers with unus
ual depth and emo
tional maturity.

swept Oscars for Best Picture-Actor-Actress-
Director (the other is "One Flew Over The
Cuckoo's Nest").
While "Sure Thing" isn't likely to duplicate
that feat, it should solidify Rob Reiner's
reputation as one of the brightest new direc
torial talents. The former co-star of "All in
the Family" first gained the attention of
filmgoers last year with "This Is Spinal Tap,"
a hilarious parody of rock-group documen
taries that has become a favorite on campuses
nationwide.
In "Sure Thing," Reiner is able to mine the
vein of campus hijinks made popular in recent
years, without relying on the gross-out tech
niques of "Animal House" and its descen
dants for laughs. Sure, there are the usual col
lege schticks — flashing moons, wild dorm
parties and lots of beer drinking — but the
film portrays the lives and loves of teenagers
with unusual depth and emotional maturity.
The real message here is that college students
aren't necessarily interested in sex itself; love
and caring are just as important.

The story concerns the cross-country ad
ventures of two Ivy League freshmen, fun
loving, carefree Walter Gibson (played by
John Cusack) and prim-and-proper Alison
Bradbury (Daphne Zuniga). Early in the film,
"Gib" tries to win Alison's affections, but she
finds him immature and irresponsible. She
can't stand him, and despite his attraction to
her, Walter becomes increasingly irritated by
her intolerance.
The fun really begins when they find them
selves sharing a ride to Los Angeles — she to
reunite with her drippy law-student
boyfriend, and he to meet a gorgeous, tanned
Californian blonde who his friend Lance
assures him is "a sure thing." The conserva
tive couple who offers them transportation
quickly tire of their incessant bickering and
refusal to sing show tunes. Walter and Alison
are banished from the car after one of their
battles causes their enraged driver to collect a
handful of traffic tickets.
Left to finish the trip on their own, the pair
runs into the standard road calamities — bad
weather, no money and no food. As they help
each other overcome mutual disasters, the an
tagonism transforms into affection, and even
tually love. By the time they reach Los An
geles, neither wants what each was going
after. But it isn't until they return to school
that they reveal their true feelings.
There are dozens of comic moments in the
film, most generated by Cusack as the quick
witted, cavalier Walter. But the real highlights
are the scenes in which their growing affection
is dramatized in small acts. One of these oc
curs when they share a motel bed in the Mid
west. Up until then, Walter had been forced
to sleep on the floor. When Alison wakes up
in the morning, she finds Walter sleeping with
his arm cradled tenderly around her. She
smiles sweetly at this gesture of caring, even
as he wakes up and pulls away in embarrass
ment, assuring her that "nothing happened."
Though Cusack provides the bulk of the
laughs, it is the gradual change in Zuniga's
character which really drives the story. An
important symbolic moment comes when
Alison forgets her schedule book in a motel
room. This causes big problems because all
her money was in the book, but the point of
the incident is that she is beginning to shed
her rigid attitudes and is no longer the person
who believes "spontaneity" has its time and
place."
Viveca Linfors is charming as Professor
Taub, an eccentric, elderly English professor
who encourages her students to live life to its
fullest.
Solid performances are also turned in by
Boyd Gains as Jason, Alison's compulsively
neat, preppy boyfriend whose idea of a good
time is to spot her 50 points in a game of gin
rummy, and Nicollette Sheridan as "the true
thing." Rather than being portrayed as a sex
object. Sheridan comes across as a real person
whose insecurities cause her to seek accep
tance through promiscuity.


In a fantasy segment from"The Sure Thing," Gib (John
Cusack), a carefree college freshman, floats in sheer content-

ment while his dream girl (Nicollette Sheridan), the'sure thing"
who awaits him in California, sits by closely in adoration.
