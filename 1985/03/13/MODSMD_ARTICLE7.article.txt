U.S., Soviets open Geneva talks
GENEVA — U.S. and Soviet negotiators met here yesterday
for the first time in 15 months in arms control talks that U.S. Am
bassador Max Kampelman characterized as "serious and businesslike."
The session lasted two hours and 45 minutes. Another meeting was
scheduled for tomorrow.
'The talks began after the surprise disclosure by Soviet chief delegate
Viktor Karpov that his negotiating instructions had been approved by
Mikhail Gorbachev, the new Soviet leader, even before President
Konstantin Chernenko had died.
Karpov's remarks were apparently intended to tell the West that the
leadership transition in Moscow will not change the Soviet position and
should not affect the pace of the three sets of talks here on strategic in
tercontinental nuclear weapons, intermediate-range nuclear weapons,
and on space and defensive arms.
Karpov, in a talkative mood with reporters before Kampelman
arrived, said Gorbachev had "presided over the meeting of the Politburo
that approved the instructions last Thursday."
Pressed on why the Kremlin might have acted in this fashion, Karpov
abruptly cut off the subject. "That's quite enough," he said.
He also brushed off suggestions that the arms talks should be recessed
• for the Soviet negotiators to return to Moscow for Chernenko's funeral,
scheduled for today. "I am not going," he said. "We are not going to
recess."
In contrast to the Soviet chief negotiator, Kampelman spoke with
reporters only very briefly. He wrote a short statement but answered no
questions afterwards, claiming that the "principle of confidentiality" to
which he and Karpov had agreed barred him from saying anything more.
But in the remarks of the two men and in the conditions surrounding
their first session, differences immediately emerged that presage difficult
negotiations on both procedural and substantive issues in coming
months.
In particular, the Soviets want curbs on space arms as a first priority
and are expected to hold up progress on offensive weapons for some
space agreement. In contrast, the United States maintains that progress
in one forum should not be arbitrarily held back because of a slower
pace in another.
Reagan wants Palestinians at talks
WASHINGTON — Palestinians must be represented "at all stages"
of Middle East peace negotiations, President Reagan said yesterday, but
he stopped well short of endorsing Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's
call for U.S. talks with a Jordanian-Palestinian delegation approved by
the Palestine Liberation Organization.
Mubarak, making his third visit to Washington since he succeeded the
latcPresident Anwar Sadat, warned that unless the United States takes a
more active role in trying to mediate an agreement between Israel and
its Arab neighbors, the world is in danger of missing "a golden opportu
nity for peace."
Although Reagan and Mubarak spiced their public comments with
phrases like "my dear friend," U.S. officials left little doubt that the
Egyptian president failed to win much support for either of his two
major requests: for a new U.S. peace effort and for $870 million in
emergency foreign aid.
However, a senior U.S. official said the door was left open for addi
tional discussion on both matters.
Reagan hinted that Egypt eventually would get some of the aid in
crease that it seeks. "Egypt faces economic difficulties.. .. We'll be
giving sympathetic consideration to what we can do to help," he said.
Mubarak, meanwhile, urged the United States to offer encouragement
to the "framework" agreement signed last month b"y Jordan's King Hus
sein and PLO chief Yasser ArafajUfisJUng fpr a joint Jordanian-PLO
peace initiative. He called on U.S." officials to meet with a Jordanian-
Palestinian delegation as a prelude to direct talks with Israel.
Iran launches ground attack in Iraq
BAGHDAD — Iran launched yesterday its first ground offen
sive against Iraq in more than a year as the two warring gulf nations en
tered a second week of their "war of cities," despite U.N. appeals for a
cease-fire.
Iraq admitted that Iranian forces had penetrated its territory in the
southern marshland area of Huwaiza in a pre-dawn offensive that began
shortly after Iraqi planes bombed six Iranian towns, including Tehran.
The Iraqis said its forces were "annihilating" the invaders, but only
scant information was made available by both Iran and Iraq about the
actual course of the fighting.
An Iraqi military spokesman, meanwhile, denied claims that Iranian
surface-to-surface missiles had hit the northern oil area of Kirkuk, but
he did say Iranians had placed time bombs at vital installations in Kirkuk,
although he was vague on whether these had been detonated.
An official Iraqi source told the Gulf News Agency that Iraq had
rejected an appeal for a cease-fire at midnight Monday by Javier Perez
de Cuellar, the secretary general of the United Nations.
Iran suspended its week-long shelling of Basra, Iraq's second largest
city, in compliance with the cease-fire call.
The Iraqi spokesman said Iraq's adhearence to the U.N. proposal was
contingent on Iranian acceptance of negotiations under U.N. auspices
that would bring the two countries to face-to-face peace talks for the
first time since the gulf war began in September 1980.
"Without this, the situation will remain as it is and escalate with graver
consequences than at present," the Iraqi spokesman warned.

Terrorists seize Turkish embassy
.OTTAWA — Three Armenian terrorists pursuing a 70-year-old
grievance seized the Turkish Embassy here yesterday morning, killed a
security guard and held 13 people hostage for more than four hours
before surrendering to police.
As of early last night, the three men had not been identified by police.
However, one of the terrorists earlier had told reporters over the tele
phone that they are members of the Armenian Revolutionary Army, an
organization associated with other terrorist groups that have attacked
Turkish diplomats and facilities around the world.
In a telephone conversation with a Canadian Broadcasting Corp.
reporter during the embassy takeover, one of the terrorists said they
would hold the hostages and the building until the Turkish government
gave up its occupation of what once was Armenia and acknowledged
murdering more than a million Armenians in 1915.
However, the terrorists surrendered their arms and released the
hostages— embassy staff members and relatives — after more than 100
police officers and soldiers using armored personnel carriers circled the
embassy in the Sandy Hill section of the city about a mile east of the
Canadian Parliament buildings.
The dramatic events began about 7 a.m. when a truck that had been
stolen in Montreal was driven up to the front of the embassy. The three
men. police said, pushed open the gates of the iron picket fence that sur
rounds the embassy, shot Brunclle and blew open the front door with
some type of explosive.
Israel considers speedier withdrawal
JERUSALEM — Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin suggested for the
first time yesterday that Israel is considering accelerating its withdrawal
from southern Lebanon in the face of mounting Israeli casualties there.
Speaking to Israeli soldiers at an army base outside the Lebanese port
city of Tyre, Rabin said the Israeli Cabinet may be asked to authorize an
early pullout from the predominantly Shiite Moslem areas of southern
Lebanon that have been the center of resistance to the Israeli occupa
tion.
Nachman Shai, Rabin's spokesman, who accompanied the defense
minister to Lebanon, confirmed last night that Rabin raised this possibil
ity while talking to the Israeli unit that Monday stormed the Shiite vil
lage of Zrariyeh and killed 34 suspected guerrillas,
"This option is being considered." Shai said of the deliberations
within the Israeli army and Defense Ministry.
