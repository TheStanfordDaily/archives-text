# '1984' allows gloom to erode Orwell's classic
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG Editorial staff 
In a cover story on Yuppies in
December, a Newsweek reporter in
terviewed a young woman about her
political convictions. She said she had
voted for Mondale in the fall because
*he opposed the Republican stand on
abortion and several other issues, but
candidly she wanted Reagan to win
"for financial reasons." However, she
was so certain of Reagan's victory
-that she felt she could safely cast her
own vote for the Democrats — in her
;own words, she could "vote my con
science."
It is a measure of the ingenuity,
pervasiveness and enduring appeal of
George Orwell's "1984" that the
word that best describes this woman's
consciousness, perhaps the only word
we could employ to describe it, is one
that he gave us — "doublethink."
"1984," published in 1949 and im
mediately acclaimed as a classic, was
not so much a prediction of the future
— in retrospect it seems less prescient
than Aldous Huxley's "Brave New
World" — as a satire of Orwell's
present: of Stalin's Soviet Union in
1948 (the reversal of the last two
digits is a satirist's trick) and of the
possibility for England to embrace
the kind of bureaucratically ordered
existence Oceania suffers in the
novel.
The pink and white schoolboys
singing their patriotic hymns in
castrati sopranos, the hippy masculine
women leading exercise classes on
national television, the radical jin
goism were all extensions of elements
of British society Orwell detested and
in the scheme of a distopian novel
could isolate as potentially fascist in
nature. Moreover, he was the first
writer to investigate the power of the
media as instruments for propaganda,
and the first to express horror at the
standardization of life in the postwar
world— the tyranny of the mediocre.
The possibly insurmountable diffi
culty that faces a director starting out
to film "1984" is the familiarity of
Orwell's vision. Thanks to him, we
have a vocabulary to speak of the
erasing of the past (the reduction of
people into "unpeople"), the om
nipresence of the media and the justi
fied paranoia of contemporary life
("Big Brother"), and the mind's
capacity for maintaining two conflict
ing points of view simultaneously, as
the Yuppie in the Newsweek article
illustrates. No movie based on this

material can hope to startle us with a
new perspective; the best it can do is
render an old one faithfully. Visconti
had this problem when he filmed the
first great existential novel, Camus'
"The Stranger," in 1967; any director
who chose to adapt "Lady Chatter
ley's Lover" would confront it as
well. Moreover, the strength of the
second half of "1984," the depiction
of the hero Winston's life in prison,
has diminished to some degree since
the world has read Koestler's and
then Solzhenitsyn's more authentic
accounts of Stalinist and post-
Stalinist atrocities.
And yet it was impossible that
1984 should have come and gone
without a tribute to Orwell in the
form of a new movie version of his
most celebrated book. (Edmond
O'Brien starred in the last one, in
1954.) Michael Radford, the writer
director of the new "1984," which
premiered in England last fall, has
made no effort to freshen the vision
by updating it (and that probably
wouldn't have worked anyway); in
stead, he has done something very
curious — he has actually pre-dated
it, stylistically.
The newsreel that opens the
picture, displaying the courage of
young Oceania soldiers battling sub
human foreigners, betrays the influ
ence of Leni Riefenstahl's "Triumph
of the Will," and the scrubbed
cherubs in chorus on public con
veyances have the unmistakable look
of Hitler youth. Furthermore, the
images of collective patriotism — the
rows and rows of Walker Evans faces
in the movie house, their mouths a
mass of open wounds, their screams
in protest against the numberless
crimes of invented traitors a gro
tesque exaggeration of human emo
tion; the war rally, with its twin
screens projecting enlarged copies of
the rabblerousing speaker dwarfed on
the platform between them — suggest
the agit-prop expressionistic theater
of the 1920s and '30s. Even Win
ston's pastoral dream, the single note
of tranquility in the film, is conceived
visually in pre-Orwellian terms: It
looks like an imitation of a Max Ernst
collage.
The familiarity — almost, by now,
the banality — of Orwell's world
wasn't the only reason 1 hesitated to
seek out this movie. The novel's
portrayal of men and women beaten
down by a force that intuits and fi
nally controls their thoughts is so

total that the most perilous trap it
poses for an adaptor is the temptation
to make a film of unrelenting grim
ness. Radford hits the trap with a dis
mal thud; the movie is lugubrious. He
is the most single-minded of direc
tors, protecting his one screeching
note with such fervor that the viewer
never gets a moment's relief.
If isn't just the landscape that is
bombed out here, but an entire im
agination; Radford and his photog
rapher, Roger Deakins, seem in
capable of humor or beauty. Surely
they might have tried mining a few
laughs out of the fatuously robust
woman on Winston's TV screen who
leads him (and the rest of the
country) in calisthenics every morn
ing, censuring him for slouching, or
those monstrous children — it's pos
sible to suggest danger and even
despair without losing sense of
humor. (Orwell never lost his.) And
without the occasional glimpses of
beauty, this life of Victory gin and
Victory cigarettes and ceaseless
chauvinistic drivel seems less horrific;
there is nothing to hold up in contrast
to it.
When Winston enters Char
rington's second-hand shop, where he
and Julia, his lover, rent the upstairs
room to steal afternoons of illicit pas
sion (sexual enjoyment being offi
cially disapproved of by the Party), a
smart director would create an at
mosphere unlike anything else in the
picture — a remnant of a forgotten
past, like the flea market David
Bowie stumbles across in "The Man
Who Fell to Earth," with "Blueberry
Hill" playing on an ancient Victrola,
or (to be more fanciful) like the no
man's land between the underworld
anc! the mirrors bordering the land of
the living in Cocteau's "Orpheus."
Cyril Cusack brings a touch of nos
talgia — something sweet and sad —
to the role of Charrington, but his
store has the same trashed, post
apocalyptic look as Winston's apart
ment building and the streets he
hobbles through on his way home
from work. And the "prole" who
sings a popular song as she hangs out
her wash outside his and Julia's win
dow does not convey the purity that
Winston ascribes to her when he asks
Julia, "How can anyone make a song
written by a machine sound so beauti
ful?"
Worse, Radford extends his gloom
to the two central characters. A
directing teacher I once had warned

us never to forecast the end of a play
at the beginning, that an audience
greeted with a blood-red backdrop at
a production of "Macbeth" can turn
around and go home again because
they've already seen the outcome of
the drama. Winston's and Julia's
rebellion against the strictures of a
Party existence only makes emotional
sense if they derive some pleasure
from it and if it fuels their hope —
whatever they may say — that a bet
ter life is possible; in terms of the au
dience, the more joy their relation
ship brings them, the more poignant
is their fate.
But in this filmed " 1984," the hero
and heroine couple joylessly in slow
motion, like a couple in a soft-core
porno film, their fa'ces damaged
beyond repair, incapable of sensual
excitement. Suzanna Hamilton as
Julia at least reaches for some varia
tion, but John Hurt's Winston is so
monotonous that it finally expresses
nothing at all: He looks so ravaged
from the first shot that we don't want
to watch his rebellion — we can see in
his eyes that it's foredoomed.
The third significant role in Or
well's book is that of O'Brien, the In
ner Party official who, presenting
himself to Winston as a renegade,
plays on Winston's own antipathy to
the Party and eventually arrests him

for "thoughtcrime." The role is at
once the most difficult in the movie
and the most promising for a good ac
tor, because in order for O'Brien's
betrayal of Winston to work dramati
cally, he must personify all the
humanistic thought that Winston
hungers after; the shock for Winston
(and for us) in the revelation of
O'Brien's true position as chief tor
turer is that it represents the irrevoca
ble perversion of humanism in this
society.
Richard Burton, whose last film
performance this was, has received
considerable praise for it, but really
it's a sad display from a great actor
who once had the capability to play so
complex a part. He looks exhausted
and his acting is deficient in spirit and
range; there's something un
pleasantly (and inevitably) eerie
about seeing Burton this way in his
final cinematic moments. (Were that
not the case, he would be just another
lifeless body in a morgue of a movie.)
He doesn't begin to suggest what
O'Brien is about, or why Winston was
ever drawn to him; I can only assume
that the reviewers who have endorsed
this performance have forgotten what
Burton was like at the height of his
powers, in something like "Who's
Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" or that
they never heard that mellifluous

voice in full flower, reading Dylan
Thomas. Burton had a tragic waste of
a career, but there are more fitting
memorials to him than working up ar
tificial enthusiasm over a late perfor
mance best passed over quickly.
One moment between Winston and
Julia may provoke a kind of rebellion
in some viewers — at least a revul
sion. When the lovers tryst in their
concealed bedroom for the first time,
Julia brings Winston a few precious
commodities purchased on the black
market — tins of real coffee, milk and
sugar — and, asking him to turn his
back, changes her sexless Party uni
form for a frivolous print dress and
puts on bright lipstick. The effect is to
make her more desirable — more
glamorous — but in Radford's ver
sion the dress is ugly and Suzanna
Hamilton smears her lipstick on in
two crooked bumps.
Couldn't Radford have made his
point about this wretched society
without cheapening the taste of the
few characters we're meant to care
about — without flinging Julia into
the morass before her torturers pum
mel her into betraying her love for
Winston? Somehow, by making this
woman's notion of romance so pa
thetic, Radford not only short-circuits
Orwell's tragedy; he also demeans all
of us.

complex a part. He looks exhausted
and his acting is deficient in spirit and
range; there's something un
pleasantly (and inevitably) eerie
about seeing Burton this way in his
final cinematic moments. (Were that
not the case, he would be just another
lifeless body in a morgue of a movie.)
He doesn't begin to suggest what
O'Brien is about, or why Winston was
ever drawn to him; I can only assume
that the reviewers who have endorsed
this performance have forgotten what
Burton was like at the height of his
powers, in something like "Who's
Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" or that
they never heard that mellifluous

voice in full flower, reading Dylan
Thomas. Burton had a tragic waste of
a career, but there are more fitting
memorials to him than working up ar
tificial enthusiasm over a late perfor
mance best passed over quickly.
One moment between Winston and
Julia may provoke a kind of rebellion
in some viewers — at least a revul
sion. When the lovers tryst in their
concealed bedroom for the first time,
Julia brings Winston a few precious
commodities purchased on the black
market — tins of real coffee, milk and
sugar — and, asking him to turn his
back, changes her sexless Party uni
form for a frivolous print dress and
puts on bright lipstick. The effect is to
make her more desirable — more
glamorous — but in Radford's ver
sion the dress is ugly and Suzanna
Hamilton smears her lipstick on in
two crooked bumps.
Couldn't Radford have made his
point about this wretched society
without cheapening the taste of the
few characters we're meant to care
about — without flinging Julia into
the morass before her torturers pum
mel her into betraying her love for
Winston? Somehow, by making this
woman's notion of romance so pa
thetic, Radford not only short-circuits
Orwell's tragedy; he also demeans all
of us.

In a cover story on Yuppies in
December, a Newsweek reporter in
terviewed a young woman about her
political convictions. She said she had
voted for Mondale in the fall because
*he opposed the Republican stand on
abortion and several other issues, but
candidly she wanted Reagan to win
"for financial reasons." However, she
was so certain of Reagan's victory
-that she felt she could safely cast her
own vote for the Democrats — in her
;own words, she could "vote my con
science."
It is a measure of the ingenuity,
pervasiveness and enduring appeal of
George Orwell's "1984" that the
word that best describes this woman's
consciousness, perhaps the only word
we could employ to describe it, is one
that he gave us — "doublethink."
"1984," published in 1949 and im
mediately acclaimed as a classic, was
not so much a prediction of the future
— in retrospect it seems less prescient
than Aldous Huxley's "Brave New
World" — as a satire of Orwell's
present: of Stalin's Soviet Union in
1948 (the reversal of the last two
digits is a satirist's trick) and of the
possibility for England to embrace
the kind of bureaucratically ordered
existence Oceania suffers in the
novel.
The pink and white schoolboys
singing their patriotic hymns in
castrati sopranos, the hippy masculine
women leading exercise classes on
national television, the radical jin
goism were all extensions of elements
of British society Orwell detested and
in the scheme of a distopian novel
could isolate as potentially fascist in
nature. Moreover, he was the first
writer to investigate the power of the
media as instruments for propaganda,
and the first to express horror at the
standardization of life in the postwar
world— the tyranny of the mediocre.
The possibly insurmountable diffi
culty that faces a director starting out
to film "1984" is the familiarity of
Orwell's vision. Thanks to him, we
have a vocabulary to speak of the
erasing of the past (the reduction of
people into "unpeople"), the om
nipresence of the media and the justi
fied paranoia of contemporary life
("Big Brother"), and the mind's
capacity for maintaining two conflict
ing points of view simultaneously, as
the Yuppie in the Newsweek article
illustrates. No movie based on this

material can hope to startle us with a
new perspective; the best it can do is
render an old one faithfully. Visconti
had this problem when he filmed the
first great existential novel, Camus'
"The Stranger," in 1967; any director
who chose to adapt "Lady Chatter
ley's Lover" would confront it as
well. Moreover, the strength of the
second half of "1984," the depiction
of the hero Winston's life in prison,
has diminished to some degree since
the world has read Koestler's and
then Solzhenitsyn's more authentic
accounts of Stalinist and post-
Stalinist atrocities.
And yet it was impossible that
1984 should have come and gone
without a tribute to Orwell in the
form of a new movie version of his
most celebrated book. (Edmond
O'Brien starred in the last one, in
1954.) Michael Radford, the writer
director of the new "1984," which
premiered in England last fall, has
made no effort to freshen the vision
by updating it (and that probably
wouldn't have worked anyway); in
stead, he has done something very
curious — he has actually pre-dated
it, stylistically.
The newsreel that opens the
picture, displaying the courage of
young Oceania soldiers battling sub
human foreigners, betrays the influ
ence of Leni Riefenstahl's "Triumph
of the Will," and the scrubbed
cherubs in chorus on public con
veyances have the unmistakable look
of Hitler youth. Furthermore, the
images of collective patriotism — the
rows and rows of Walker Evans faces
in the movie house, their mouths a
mass of open wounds, their screams
in protest against the numberless
crimes of invented traitors a gro
tesque exaggeration of human emo
tion; the war rally, with its twin
screens projecting enlarged copies of
the rabblerousing speaker dwarfed on
the platform between them — suggest
the agit-prop expressionistic theater
of the 1920s and '30s. Even Win
ston's pastoral dream, the single note
of tranquility in the film, is conceived
visually in pre-Orwellian terms: It
looks like an imitation of a Max Ernst
collage.
The familiarity — almost, by now,
the banality — of Orwell's world
wasn't the only reason 1 hesitated to
seek out this movie. The novel's
portrayal of men and women beaten
down by a force that intuits and fi
nally controls their thoughts is so

total that the most perilous trap it
poses for an adaptor is the temptation
to make a film of unrelenting grim
ness. Radford hits the trap with a dis
mal thud; the movie is lugubrious. He
is the most single-minded of direc
tors, protecting his one screeching
note with such fervor that the viewer
never gets a moment's relief.
If isn't just the landscape that is
bombed out here, but an entire im
agination; Radford and his photog
rapher, Roger Deakins, seem in
capable of humor or beauty. Surely
they might have tried mining a few
laughs out of the fatuously robust
woman on Winston's TV screen who
leads him (and the rest of the
country) in calisthenics every morn
ing, censuring him for slouching, or
those monstrous children — it's pos
sible to suggest danger and even
despair without losing sense of
humor. (Orwell never lost his.) And
without the occasional glimpses of
beauty, this life of Victory gin and
Victory cigarettes and ceaseless
chauvinistic drivel seems less horrific;
there is nothing to hold up in contrast
to it.
When Winston enters Char
rington's second-hand shop, where he
and Julia, his lover, rent the upstairs
room to steal afternoons of illicit pas
sion (sexual enjoyment being offi
cially disapproved of by the Party), a
smart director would create an at
mosphere unlike anything else in the
picture — a remnant of a forgotten
past, like the flea market David
Bowie stumbles across in "The Man
Who Fell to Earth," with "Blueberry
Hill" playing on an ancient Victrola,
or (to be more fanciful) like the no
man's land between the underworld
anc! the mirrors bordering the land of
the living in Cocteau's "Orpheus."
Cyril Cusack brings a touch of nos
talgia — something sweet and sad —
to the role of Charrington, but his
store has the same trashed, post
apocalyptic look as Winston's apart
ment building and the streets he
hobbles through on his way home
from work. And the "prole" who
sings a popular song as she hangs out
her wash outside his and Julia's win
dow does not convey the purity that
Winston ascribes to her when he asks
Julia, "How can anyone make a song
written by a machine sound so beauti
ful?"
Worse, Radford extends his gloom
to the two central characters. A
directing teacher I once had warned

us never to forecast the end of a play
at the beginning, that an audience
greeted with a blood-red backdrop at
a production of "Macbeth" can turn
around and go home again because
they've already seen the outcome of
the drama. Winston's and Julia's
rebellion against the strictures of a
Party existence only makes emotional
sense if they derive some pleasure
from it and if it fuels their hope —
whatever they may say — that a bet
ter life is possible; in terms of the au
dience, the more joy their relation
ship brings them, the more poignant
is their fate.
But in this filmed " 1984," the hero
and heroine couple joylessly in slow
motion, like a couple in a soft-core
porno film, their fa'ces damaged
beyond repair, incapable of sensual
excitement. Suzanna Hamilton as
Julia at least reaches for some varia
tion, but John Hurt's Winston is so
monotonous that it finally expresses
nothing at all: He looks so ravaged
from the first shot that we don't want
to watch his rebellion — we can see in
his eyes that it's foredoomed.
The third significant role in Or
well's book is that of O'Brien, the In
ner Party official who, presenting
himself to Winston as a renegade,
plays on Winston's own antipathy to
the Party and eventually arrests him

for "thoughtcrime." The role is at
once the most difficult in the movie
and the most promising for a good ac
tor, because in order for O'Brien's
betrayal of Winston to work dramati
cally, he must personify all the
humanistic thought that Winston
hungers after; the shock for Winston
(and for us) in the revelation of
O'Brien's true position as chief tor
turer is that it represents the irrevoca
ble perversion of humanism in this
society.
Richard Burton, whose last film
performance this was, has received
considerable praise for it, but really
it's a sad display from a great actor
who once had the capability to play so
complex a part. He looks exhausted
and his acting is deficient in spirit and
range; there's something un

they've already seen the outcome of
the drama. Winston's and Julia's
rebellion against the strictures of a
Party existence only makes emotional
sense if they derive some pleasure
from it and if it fuels their hope —
whatever they may say — that a bet
ter life is possible; in terms of the au
dience, the more joy their relation
ship brings them, the more poignant
is their fate.
But in this filmed " 1984," the hero
and heroine couple joylessly in slow
motion, like a couple in a soft-core
porno film, their fa'ces damaged
beyond repair, incapable of sensual
excitement. Suzanna Hamilton as
Julia at least reaches for some varia
tion, but John Hurt's Winston is so
monotonous that it finally expresses
nothing at all: He looks so ravaged
from the first shot that we don't want
to watch his rebellion — we can see in
his eyes that it's foredoomed.
The third significant role in Or
well's book is that of O'Brien, the In
ner Party official who, presenting
himself to Winston as a renegade,
plays on Winston's own antipathy to
the Party and eventually arrests him

for "thoughtcrime." The role is at
once the most difficult in the movie
and the most promising for a good ac
tor, because in order for O'Brien's
betrayal of Winston to work dramati
cally, he must personify all the
humanistic thought that Winston
hungers after; the shock for Winston
(and for us) in the revelation of
O'Brien's true position as chief tor
turer is that it represents the irrevoca
ble perversion of humanism in this
society.
Richard Burton, whose last film
performance this was, has received
considerable praise for it, but really
it's a sad display from a great actor
who once had the capability to play so
complex a part. He looks exhausted
and his acting is deficient in spirit and
range; there's something un
pleasantly (and inevitably) eerie
about seeing Burton this way in his
final cinematic moments. (Were that
not the case, he would be just another
lifeless body in a morgue of a movie.)
He doesn't begin to suggest what
O'Brien is about, or why Winston was
ever drawn to him; I can only assume
that the reviewers who have endorsed
this performance have forgotten what
Burton was like at the height of his
powers, in something like "Who's
Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" or that
they never heard that mellifluous

voice in full flower, reading Dylan
Thomas. Burton had a tragic waste of
a career, but there are more fitting
memorials to him than working up ar
tificial enthusiasm over a late perfor
mance best passed over quickly.
One moment between Winston and
Julia may provoke a kind of rebellion
in some viewers — at least a revul
sion. When the lovers tryst in their
concealed bedroom for the first time,
Julia brings Winston a few precious
commodities purchased on the black
market — tins of real coffee, milk and
sugar — and, asking him to turn his
back, changes her sexless Party uni
form for a frivolous print dress and
puts on bright lipstick. The effect is to
make her more desirable — more
glamorous — but in Radford's ver
sion the dress is ugly and Suzanna
Hamilton smears her lipstick on in
two crooked bumps.
Couldn't Radford have made his
point about this wretched society
without cheapening the taste of the
few characters we're meant to care
about — without flinging Julia into
the morass before her torturers pum
mel her into betraying her love for
Winston? Somehow, by making this
woman's notion of romance so pa
thetic, Radford not only short-circuits
Orwell's tragedy; he also demeans all
of us.

In a cover story on Yuppies in
December, a Newsweek reporter in
terviewed a young woman about her
political convictions. She said she had
voted for Mondale in the fall because
*he opposed the Republican stand on
abortion and several other issues, but
candidly she wanted Reagan to win
"for financial reasons." However, she
was so certain of Reagan's victory
-that she felt she could safely cast her
own vote for the Democrats — in her
;own words, she could "vote my con
science."
It is a measure of the ingenuity,
pervasiveness and enduring appeal of
George Orwell's "1984" that the
word that best describes this woman's
consciousness, perhaps the only word
we could employ to describe it, is one
that he gave us — "doublethink."
"1984," published in 1949 and im
mediately acclaimed as a classic, was
not so much a prediction of the future
— in retrospect it seems less prescient
than Aldous Huxley's "Brave New
World" — as a satire of Orwell's
present: of Stalin's Soviet Union in
1948 (the reversal of the last two
digits is a satirist's trick) and of the
possibility for England to embrace
the kind of bureaucratically ordered
existence Oceania suffers in the
novel.
The pink and white schoolboys
singing their patriotic hymns in
castrati sopranos, the hippy masculine
women leading exercise classes on
national television, the radical jin
goism were all extensions of elements
of British society Orwell detested and
in the scheme of a distopian novel
could isolate as potentially fascist in
nature. Moreover, he was the first
writer to investigate the power of the
media as instruments for propaganda,
and the first to express horror at the
standardization of life in the postwar
world— the tyranny of the mediocre.
The possibly insurmountable diffi
culty that faces a director starting out
to film "1984" is the familiarity of
Orwell's vision. Thanks to him, we
have a vocabulary to speak of the
erasing of the past (the reduction of
people into "unpeople"), the om
nipresence of the media and the justi
fied paranoia of contemporary life
("Big Brother"), and the mind's
capacity for maintaining two conflict
ing points of view simultaneously, as
the Yuppie in the Newsweek article
illustrates. No movie based on this

material can hope to startle us with a
new perspective; the best it can do is
render an old one faithfully. Visconti
had this problem when he filmed the
first great existential novel, Camus'
"The Stranger," in 1967; any director
who chose to adapt "Lady Chatter
ley's Lover" would confront it as
well. Moreover, the strength of the
second half of "1984," the depiction
of the hero Winston's life in prison,
has diminished to some degree since
the world has read Koestler's and
then Solzhenitsyn's more authentic
accounts of Stalinist and post-
Stalinist atrocities.
And yet it was impossible that
1984 should have come and gone
without a tribute to Orwell in the
form of a new movie version of his
most celebrated book. (Edmond
O'Brien starred in the last one, in
1954.) Michael Radford, the writer
director of the new "1984," which
premiered in England last fall, has
made no effort to freshen the vision
by updating it (and that probably
wouldn't have worked anyway); in
stead, he has done something very
curious — he has actually pre-dated
it, stylistically.
The newsreel that opens the
picture, displaying the courage of
young Oceania soldiers battling sub
human foreigners, betrays the influ
ence of Leni Riefenstahl's "Triumph
of the Will," and the scrubbed
cherubs in chorus on public con
veyances have the unmistakable look
of Hitler youth. Furthermore, the
images of collective patriotism — the
rows and rows of Walker Evans faces
in the movie house, their mouths a
mass of open wounds, their screams
in protest against the numberless
crimes of invented traitors a gro
tesque exaggeration of human emo
tion; the war rally, with its twin
screens projecting enlarged copies of
the rabblerousing speaker dwarfed on
the platform between them — suggest
the agit-prop expressionistic theater
of the 1920s and '30s. Even Win
ston's pastoral dream, the single note
of tranquility in the film, is conceived
visually in pre-Orwellian terms: It
looks like an imitation of a Max Ernst
collage.
The familiarity — almost, by now,
the banality — of Orwell's world
wasn't the only reason 1 hesitated to
seek out this movie. The novel's
portrayal of men and women beaten
down by a force that intuits and fi
nally controls their thoughts is so

total that the most perilous trap it
poses for an adaptor is the temptation
to make a film of unrelenting grim
ness. Radford hits the trap with a dis
mal thud; the movie is lugubrious. He
is the most single-minded of direc
tors, protecting his one screeching
note with such fervor that the viewer
never gets a moment's relief.
If isn't just the landscape that is
bombed out here, but an entire im
agination; Radford and his photog
rapher, Roger Deakins, seem in
capable of humor or beauty. Surely
they might have tried mining a few
laughs out of the fatuously robust
woman on Winston's TV screen who
leads him (and the rest of the
country) in calisthenics every morn
ing, censuring him for slouching, or
those monstrous children — it's pos
sible to suggest danger and even
despair without losing sense of
humor. (Orwell never lost his.) And
without the occasional glimpses of
beauty, this life of Victory gin and
Victory cigarettes and ceaseless
chauvinistic drivel seems less horrific;
there is nothing to hold up in contrast
to it.
When Winston enters Char
rington's second-hand shop, where he
and Julia, his lover, rent the upstairs
room to steal afternoons of illicit pas
sion (sexual enjoyment being offi
cially disapproved of by the Party), a
smart director would create an at
mosphere unlike anything else in the
picture — a remnant of a forgotten
past, like the flea market David
Bowie stumbles across in "The Man
Who Fell to Earth," with "Blueberry
Hill" playing on an ancient Victrola,
or (to be more fanciful) like the no
man's land between the underworld
anc! the mirrors bordering the land of
the living in Cocteau's "Orpheus."
Cyril Cusack brings a touch of nos
talgia — something sweet and sad —
to the role of Charrington, but his
store has the same trashed, post
apocalyptic look as Winston's apart
ment building and the streets he
hobbles through on his way home
from work. And the "prole" who
sings a popular song as she hangs out
her wash outside his and Julia's win
dow does not convey the purity that
Winston ascribes to her when he asks
Julia, "How can anyone make a song
written by a machine sound so beauti
ful?"
Worse, Radford extends his gloom
to the two central characters. A
directing teacher I once had warned

us never to forecast the end of a play
at the beginning, that an audience
greeted with a blood-red backdrop at
a production of "Macbeth" can turn
around and go home again because
they've already seen the outcome of
the drama. Winston's and Julia's
rebellion against the strictures of a
Party existence only makes emotional
sense if they derive some pleasure
from it and if it fuels their hope —
whatever they may say — that a bet
ter life is possible; in terms of the au
