# U2's fire warms the Cow Palace
## 
### ANDREW CROWELL 
Only a few days after Prince's
purple onslaught at the Cow Palace,
the Irish quartet U2 presented its
uplifting brand of Christian rock to an
eagerly receptive audience. Instead of
purple paraphernalia, the sold-out
arena was filled mostly with black
leather, denim and boots. No baths
were taken on stage and no purple
rain fell, but the cleansing effect of
the music and the sea of emotion that
surrounded the event were more than
sufficient to produce a spirited and
meaningful show.
"11 o'clock Tick Tock," which
started U2's approximately two-hour
show, set the tone for the evening. As
Bono sang "It's cold outside, but it
gets so hot in here / And the boys and
girls collide to the music in my ear,"
thousands of sardine-packed, sweaty
fans on the floor of the auditorium
swayed back and forth to the music.
The anti-war protest song "Seconds"
was "a message to the president."
Bono emphasized the sincerity of his
statement and encouraged the audi
ence, saying, "Let's make enough
noise so Ronald Reagan can hear us
in Washington." No doubt, the
responsive listeners yelled their sup
port.
Though all of the songs seemed to
carry the same weight of importance,
the new pieces from the recent
"Unforgettable Fire" album were
indeed some of the more featured
tunes and added additional flavor to
the show. Bono introduced and ex
plained the new songs saying,
"Welcome to the Unforgettable Fire
... a place where good can come out
of bad." Bono's voice and the Edge's
support vocals on "The Unforget
table Fire" and "A Sort of
Homecoming" were so brilliantly
polished and harmonious that one
might have mistaken the two works
for studio recordings rather than live
performances.
The dreamy "MLK" was the first
of two songs dedicated to the memory
of Martin Luther King, Jr. and dis
played not only Bono's great voice
but also the emotion for which this
singer is known. In explaining the
song "Bad," Bono remarked that the
song was inspired by one of his
friends who had become addicted to
heroin, which is now so rampant in
Dublin City, the band's home town.
Lest the listeners should think that
heroin was the only subject of the
song, Bono then explained the song's
universality: "It's about me, and it's
probably about a lot of you, too." No
doubt, these latter remarks were not

in reference to drug addiction neces
sarily but more to people's addictions
to external things to provide their
sustenance.
Toward the end of the song, Hew
son was so overcome with emotion
that he seemed on the verge of tears.
He motioned for a woman in the au
dience to come on stage, and the two
embraced for what seemed like a few
minutes as the singer sought a release
for this flood of emotion. Bono
unified all music fans as he asked the
audience to sing the song in memory
of Elvis, Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendricks,
Bob Marley, Brian Jones and others
— all musicians who allegedly died as
a result of drugs.
"Sunday Bloody Sunday" and
"New Year's Day" were two big
crowd-pleasers that showed off the
Edge's guitar virtuosity. As a friend
of mine remarked, "That guy can
make a lot of music with only one

guitar!" Chants of "No more!" and
"No war!" emphasized the fervent
desire for peace that the band
promotes. At one point, Bono
received an Irish flag and a white
peace flag from members of the audi
ence. Holding up first the Irish flag
and next the white flag, Hewson
revealed the attitude of the band
toward its still bitterly divided
country. His voice pleaded, "We're
so sick of it. . . . How long, how long
must we sing this song. . . . For
tonight, we can be as one. ..."
Yet one more surprise was the
rendition of Bob Dylan's (Dylan was
the writer, wasn't he?) song,
"Knocking On Heaven's Door."
Bono reminisced that when the band
members were only 16, they played
to about 10 or 20 people at a time,
and he expressed his gratitude that
they could now play to so many
thousands of people. Encouraging
young musicians, he explained that
fancy equipment and advanced

playing ability are not the necessities
behind writing meaningful songs.
During the tune. Bono asked if
anyone in the crowd played guitar,
and amid a sea of hands, he selected
Louis Adamo from Stanford, who
proceeded to play for the duration of
the song (see article at right). The
talented and poised young man
played to a wildly supportive audi
ence as all of the band members ex
cept Mullen temporarily left the
stage. Truly, U2 does its utmost to
break down the traditional audience
performer wall that stands so high
and firm in some of today's popular
rock bands.
The spirited "Pride (In the Name
of Love)" inspired some audience
members as they waved their "Pride
In The Name Of Jesus" banner. One
of the many other memorable mo
ments was the improvisational singing
of the hymn, "Amazing Grace,"
during "The Electric Co." The
praise-filled "Gloria" began an
encore set, and after yet another call
back, the band closed with "40," the
group's rendition of the 40th Psalm
— even inserting a chorus from the
recent Band-Aid single, "Do They
Know It's Christmas?" Even after
the band had left the stage, the crowd
continued to sing, "How long to sing
this song?" — really rounding off a
spirited and inspirational show.
As its performances so vividly
demonstrate, U2 continues to fight
against mediocrity — mediocrity in
music and mediocrity in values. The
group presents accesible rock with in
tegrity that uplifts and inspires.
The Red Rockers opened the show
with their politically conscious brand
of rock. Though the audience clearly
came to see U2 perform, the Rockers
did gather a healthy response at times
— most specifically for their hit,
"China."

purple paraphernalia, the sold-out
arena was filled mostly with black
leather, denim and boots. No baths
were taken on stage and no purple
rain fell, but the cleansing effect of
the music and the sea of emotion that
surrounded the event were more than
sufficient to produce a spirited and
meaningful show.
"11 o'clock Tick Tock," which
started U2's approximately two-hour
show, set the tone for the evening. As
Bono sang "It's cold outside, but it
gets so hot in here / And the boys and
girls collide to the music in my ear,"
thousands of sardine-packed, sweaty
fans on the floor of the auditorium
swayed back and forth to the music.
The anti-war protest song "Seconds"
was "a message to the president."
Bono emphasized the sincerity of his
statement and encouraged the audi
ence, saying, "Let's make enough
noise so Ronald Reagan can hear us
in Washington." No doubt, the
responsive listeners yelled their sup
port.
Though all of the songs seemed to
carry the same weight of importance,
the new pieces from the recent
"Unforgettable Fire" album were
indeed some of the more featured
tunes and added additional flavor to
the show. Bono introduced and ex
plained the new songs saying,
"Welcome to the Unforgettable Fire
... a place where good can come out
of bad." Bono's voice and the Edge's
support vocals on "The Unforget
table Fire" and "A Sort of
Homecoming" were so brilliantly
polished and harmonious that one
might have mistaken the two works
for studio recordings rather than live
performances.
The dreamy "MLK" was the first
of two songs dedicated to the memory
of Martin Luther King, Jr. and dis
played not only Bono's great voice
but also the emotion for which this
singer is known. In explaining the
song "Bad," Bono remarked that the
song was inspired by one of his
friends who had become addicted to
heroin, which is now so rampant in
Dublin City, the band's home town.
Lest the listeners should think that
heroin was the only subject of the
song, Bono then explained the song's
universality: "It's about me, and it's
probably about a lot of you, too." No
doubt, these latter remarks were not

in reference to drug addiction neces
sarily but more to people's addictions
to external things to provide their
sustenance.
Toward the end of the song, Hew
son was so overcome with emotion
that he seemed on the verge of tears.
He motioned for a woman in the au
dience to come on stage, and the two
embraced for what seemed like a few
minutes as the singer sought a release
for this flood of emotion. Bono
unified all music fans as he asked the
audience to sing the song in memory
of Elvis, Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendricks,
Bob Marley, Brian Jones and others
— all musicians who allegedly died as
a result of drugs.
"Sunday Bloody Sunday" and
"New Year's Day" were two big
crowd-pleasers that showed off the
Edge's guitar virtuosity. As a friend
of mine remarked, "That guy can
make a lot of music with only one

guitar!" Chants of "No more!" and
"No war!" emphasized the fervent
desire for peace that the band
promotes. At one point, Bono
received an Irish flag and a white
peace flag from members of the audi
ence. Holding up first the Irish flag
and next the white flag, Hewson
revealed the attitude of the band
toward its still bitterly divided
country. His voice pleaded, "We're
so sick of it. . . . How long, how long
must we sing this song. . . . For
tonight, we can be as one. ..."
Yet one more surprise was the
rendition of Bob Dylan's (Dylan was
the writer, wasn't he?) song,
"Knocking On Heaven's Door."
Bono reminisced that when the band
members were only 16, they played
to about 10 or 20 people at a time,
and he expressed his gratitude that
they could now play to so many
thousands of people. Encouraging
young musicians, he explained that
fancy equipment and advanced

playing ability are not the necessities
behind writing meaningful songs.
During the tune. Bono asked if
anyone in the crowd played guitar,
and amid a sea of hands, he selected
Louis Adamo from Stanford, who
proceeded to play for the duration of
the song (see article at right). The
talented and poised young man
played to a wildly supportive audi
ence as all of the band members ex
cept Mullen temporarily left the
stage. Truly, U2 does its utmost to
break down the traditional audience
performer wall that stands so high
and firm in some of today's popular
rock bands.
The spirited "Pride (In the Name
of Love)" inspired some audience
members as they waved their "Pride
In The Name Of Jesus" banner. One
of the many other memorable mo
ments was the improvisational singing
of the hymn, "Amazing Grace,"
during "The Electric Co." The
praise-filled "Gloria" began an
encore set, and after yet another call
back, the band closed with "40," the
group's rendition of the 40th Psalm
— even inserting a chorus from the
recent Band-Aid single, "Do They
Know It's Christmas?" Even after
the band had left the stage, the crowd
continued to sing, "How long to sing
this song?" — really rounding off a
spirited and inspirational show.
As its performances so vividly
demonstrate, U2 continues to fight
against mediocrity — mediocrity in
music and mediocrity in values. The
group presents accesible rock with in
tegrity that uplifts and inspires.
The Red Rockers opened the show
with their politically conscious brand
of rock. Though the audience clearly
came to see U2 perform, the Rockers
did gather a healthy response at times
— most specifically for their hit,
"China."


The Irish quartet U2, with its unique brand of Christian rock, filled The Cow Palace Thursday night.
Only a few days after Prince's
purple onslaught at the Cow Palace,
the Irish quartet U2 presented its
