# Freshman joins U2 on stage
## 
### RONALD CHRISLEY 
The essence of U2's success at
giving its audiences a truly
memorable experience is its ability
to create and sustain a tangible re
lationship, an emotional dialogue,
with the crowd. And what could
be more symbolic and illustrative
of this quality to us, the Stanford
community, than the story of our
own Louis Adamo.
Biking over to Madera to inter
view Adamo, I replayed the events
of Thursday night in my
mind, concentrating specifically on
the band's encore performance of
Bob Dylan's "Knocking on
Heaven's Door." Bono had intro
duced the song with an emphasis
on the universality of music, point
ing out that its simplistic precious
ness was something we all can
share, not just a commodity to be
dispensed at the behest of rock
stars and their Bill-Grahamish
promoters. The interplay between
band and crowd during the song
peaked when Bono asked his
14,000-plus fans if any of them
played the guitar, a question which
illicited an eager response of
14,000-plus people raising their
hands, straining to touch the hem
of his garments.
One of those people was Louis
Adamo. Bono saw his raised hand,
and all of us saw him beckon
Adamo onstage. Adamo later told
me that at that moment he prayed
Bono wouldn't ask him to play the
guitar, but that is exactly what he
did. The crowd went wild —
Adamo was realizing the dream of

thousands. Adamo's initial reluc
tance soon faded as the necessity
of the situation confronted him —
the cheerful frenzy of thousands
with an excitement that over
shadowed any jealousy; Bono's
unswerving desire for him to play,
to perform; Adamo's own realiza
tion of the special quality of this
once-in-a-lifetime experience.
After strapping his guitar on
Adamo, Bono showed the
Maderan the three simple chords
of the Dylan classic, staying with
him only long enough to make
sure he was playing it, and then
returned up front to finish the
song, now backed by four
bandsmen, not three.
* The most fantastic moment
came when, one-by-one, Bono,
The Edge and Adam Clayton left
Adamo and Larry Mullen, Jr. to
face the crowd alone. Eventually
the stage was dark except for one
spotlight on the understandably
stunned Stanford student. The au
dience roared, delighting in his
fortune. The fans roared for
Adamo, themselves and the music
— not for U2. This was the fruit of
Bono's homily — music as a bond
of the many, not a possession of
the few.
Approaching Adamo's first
floor room three nights later, I was
immediately confronted with the
inevitable side-effects of his
cameo stardom. Someone had
transformed his door into a
dressing-room door by affixing to
it a celebrity's star with Adamo's
name on it, and below that was a

sign proclaiming that "You, too,
can play with U2!" His friends
cooperatively told me that Adamo
was at yet another concert, but
that they would return shortly.
Leaving briefly to collect my
thoughts, I returned half an hour
later to find a concert-shirt
adorned Adamo in his room.
After greeting him, I noticed a
jazzy cutaway guitar on a chair
and instinctively asked him if it
was his — it wasn't. I recognized
the freshman from my memory of
his performance — the lanky
build, the angular, tanned face, the
close-cropped hair. It didn't take
long for our excitement with
Thursday's show to dominate our
discussion. With a shy modesty,
Adamo cheerfully relayed the ex
perience of playing onstage with
U2. "It felt really good, I feel ex
tremely lucky. ... He was pointing
specifically at me." Gesturing
toward the backstage pass proudly
attached to his loft, he mentioned
that at the after-party, a supposed
relative of one of the band mem
bers told him that it was probably
his purple shirt that caught the
Irishman's eye.
When I asked him to describe
the backstage event, Adamo men
tioned that Bono, after playing a
game of ping-pong with a fan,
sauntered over and exchanged a
few words with him. Adamo said
he thanked him for the "greatest
time" of his life, to which the wry
Bono replied, "Don't thank me —
you stole my guitar, my audience
and my stage!"

The essence of U2's success at
giving its audiences a truly
memorable experience is its ability
to create and sustain a tangible re
lationship, an emotional dialogue,
with the crowd. And what could
be more symbolic and illustrative
of this quality to us, the Stanford
community, than the story of our
own Louis Adamo.
Biking over to Madera to inter
view Adamo, I replayed the events
of Thursday night in my
mind, concentrating specifically on
the band's encore performance of
Bob Dylan's "Knocking on
Heaven's Door." Bono had intro
duced the song with an emphasis
on the universality of music, point
ing out that its simplistic precious
ness was something we all can
share, not just a commodity to be
dispensed at the behest of rock
stars and their Bill-Grahamish
promoters. The interplay between
band and crowd during the song
peaked when Bono asked his
14,000-plus fans if any of them
played the guitar, a question which
illicited an eager response of
14,000-plus people raising their
hands, straining to touch the hem
of his garments.
One of those people was Louis
Adamo. Bono saw his raised hand,
and all of us saw him beckon
Adamo onstage. Adamo later told
me that at that moment he prayed
Bono wouldn't ask him to play the
guitar, but that is exactly what he
did. The crowd went wild —
Adamo was realizing the dream of

thousands. Adamo's initial reluc
tance soon faded as the necessity
of the situation confronted him —
the cheerful frenzy of thousands
with an excitement that over
shadowed any jealousy; Bono's
unswerving desire for him to play,
to perform; Adamo's own realiza
tion of the special quality of this
once-in-a-lifetime experience.
After strapping his guitar on
Adamo, Bono showed the
Maderan the three simple chords
of the Dylan classic, staying with
him only long enough to make
sure he was playing it, and then
returned up front to finish the
song, now backed by four
bandsmen, not three.
* The most fantastic moment
came when, one-by-one, Bono,
The Edge and Adam Clayton left
Adamo and Larry Mullen, Jr. to
face the crowd alone. Eventually
the stage was dark except for one
spotlight on the understandably
stunned Stanford student. The au
dience roared, delighting in his
fortune. The fans roared for
Adamo, themselves and the music
— not for U2. This was the fruit of
Bono's homily — music as a bond
of the many, not a possession of
the few.
Approaching Adamo's first
floor room three nights later, I was
immediately confronted with the
inevitable side-effects of his
cameo stardom. Someone had
transformed his door into a
dressing-room door by affixing to
it a celebrity's star with Adamo's
name on it, and below that was a

sign proclaiming that "You, too,
can play with U2!" His friends
cooperatively told me that Adamo
was at yet another concert, but
that they would return shortly.
Leaving briefly to collect my
thoughts, I returned half an hour
later to find a concert-shirt
adorned Adamo in his room.
After greeting him, I noticed a
jazzy cutaway guitar on a chair
and instinctively asked him if it
was his — it wasn't. I recognized
the freshman from my memory of
his performance — the lanky
build, the angular, tanned face, the
close-cropped hair. It didn't take
long for our excitement with
Thursday's show to dominate our
discussion. With a shy modesty,
Adamo cheerfully relayed the ex
perience of playing onstage with
U2. "It felt really good, I feel ex
tremely lucky. ... He was pointing
specifically at me." Gesturing
toward the backstage pass proudly
attached to his loft, he mentioned
that at the after-party, a supposed
relative of one of the band mem
bers told him that it was probably
his purple shirt that caught the
Irishman's eye.
When I asked him to describe
the backstage event, Adamo men
tioned that Bono, after playing a
game of ping-pong with a fan,
sauntered over and exchanged a
few words with him. Adamo said
he thanked him for the "greatest
time" of his life, to which the wry
Bono replied, "Don't thank me —
you stole my guitar, my audience
and my stage!"
