# 'Birdy' flies despite pop psychology
## 
### STEVE VINEBERG Editorial staff 
"Birdy" is a good movie in spite of
itself. The screenplay Sandy Kroopf
and Jack Behr culled from William
Wharton's novel, which has ap
parently gathered a cult following
(and which I found impenetrable),
focuses on the intimate friendship of
two high school kids — Al Colum
bato (Nicolas Cage), an athletic,
charismatic boy, and a strange, in
tense outsider Al nicknamed "Birdy"
(Matthew Modine) because of his
passionate interest in birds. The film
tells us that this camaraderie is the
only strong human connection Birdy
maintains as his loving and empathic
relationship with the birds he keeps
and trains carries him farther and far
ther away from the world he lives in;
and that despite Al's attempts to

"socialize" his pal (to initiate him
into sex, mostly) A 1 too feels
threatened by other people — the
consequence of a long-suppressed
rebellion against his tyrannical,
brutalizing father (Sandy Baron). The
story, told in a series of flashbacks,
takes the boys to Vietnam — first Al,
whose departure Birdy sees as an
abandonment, and then Birdy. When
they reunite, dt the suggestion of an
army psychiatrist (John Harkins), Al
has survived a mine explosion and is
wearing a face bandage and a wire to
keep his jaw intact, and Birdy, who
was missing in action for a month, sits
mute in a hospital cell on his
haunches, staring ahead in space —
having retreated into a fantasy of
himself as a bird. The psychiatrist
hopes that these two shattered souls,
these walking war casualties, can

once again bring each other salvation.
The screenwriters, taking their cue
from Wharton but updating the story
to the Vietnam era, mean us to read
the friendship between A 1 and Birdy
metaphorically. These alienated
young men — their state a result
mostly of familial tensions — are
tossed into the cauldron of Vietnam
and return stripped to the psychic
bone. The writers have prepared their
own cauldron, a bubbling brew of
1950s Freudianizing and 1960s
depressive rhapsodizing about the
fate of the square peg in the round
hole and the impossibility of the true
lyrical flight in modern American so
ciety. Birdy is a cross between Rima
the Bird Girl from "Green Man
sions" and Peter Pan, and A 1 has
more than a trace of McMurphy from
"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest."
(He sees Birdy's psychiatrist as an
other example of the military author
ity he's been bucking since he entered
the army, and he refuses to cooperate
with him.) "Birdy" could have been a
cult movie 10 years ago: It cross
hatches several countercultural
layers, and there's enough pop psy
chology in it to satisfy everyone.
(Birdy's avian passion brings him
sexual fulfilment, as Al's "normal"
adolescent gropings do not, and
there's a strong hint of unrealized
homosexual attachment in the boys'
relationship.) And Birdy's "flights"
— some actual attempts to fly, and
some mental journeys that leave him
breathless— have a preciousness that
Saint-Exupery would envy.
To put it gently, "Birdy" is not my
kind of material, and yet 1 must con
fess to liking the film quite a bit.
Something almost miraculous hap
pens in director Alan Parker's treat
ment of it that redeems all the psy
chological and metaphysical weight
loaded onto its back. He and his two
leading actors do such a superb job
with the Al-Birdy scenes that the
friendship becomes the essential
theme of the movie rather than just a
useful metaphor for all those other
themes. Parker is probably the most
peculiar of gifted American directors;
he has a taste for cheap, derivative
pop (look at '"Pink Floyd: The
Wall"), and he has no compunctions
about employing his talents to manip
ulate the audience ("Midnight Ex
press"), but when he chooses to sen
sitize rather than numb us, he can be
absolutely extraordinary. His hand
ling of the actors in "Shoot the
Moon" was Renoiresque, and,
working once again with photog
rapher Michael Seresin, he ap
proaches "Birdy" in a "Shoot the

Moon" mood, with attention to deli
cate modulations of rhythm and
quicksilver tonal shifts. When Nicolas
Cage and Matthew Modine are on
screen together you don't think of
Kesey and Saint-Exupery, of Freud
and Laing, or even of the Vietnam
War; you think of the beauty and
comedy of two boys struggling to
wriggle out of the manacles of adoles
cence and forge identifies that aren't
defined by the world that shaped
those manacles. Though "Birdy" isn't
a romance (at least not on the
surface), the film it most reminded
me of was Alan Pakula's 1969 "The
Sterile Cuckoo," with Liza Minnelli
and Wendell Burton as a pair of
young lovers whose dialogue
(courtesy of Alvin Sargent) had a
Salinger-like ironic tenderness. At its
best, "Birdy" has the same authen
ticity of feeling, the same sustained
mood of melancholy and unspecified
nostalgic longing. And Nicolas Cage

(who has been badly served by the
Coppola pictures he's made recently)
and Matthew Modine (who can be
seen in another fine performance as
Mel Gibson's brother in "Mrs. Sof
fel") give graceful, complimentary
performances.
Despite his finesse, and his un
canny way of making a cliche seem
fresh, Parker doesn't score as well
with the sequences that involve other
characters — the boys' parents, the
girls they date and the other adults
whose paths cross theirs. But he tries
something original that sometimes
comes off: He stylizes all of these
scenes, lending them a comic absur
dity, as if only the friendship between
the two boys were real. In interludes
involving a dogcatcher who hires the
boys on (until, in a recognizably '60s
reversal, they liberate his animal
prisoners) and a dotty lady who sells
Birdy a canary, Parker has the char
acter actors to make the experiment

work, and even when he doesn't,
Modine and Cage are sometimes suf
ficient. When Modine dances with a
prom date (to"Rockin' Robin"!), his
distracted movements are so funny,
and so eerily fixed on something in
his head (we can almost catch the
strains of the music he hears), that the
moment is a small epiphany. Parker
sweats to find ways to film the unfil
mable, and really, the fluid transitions
from present to past, and the
transcendent lyricism of Birdy's im
aginary flight after he returns from
the prom, are triumphs of technique
over content. Watching "Birdy," you
feel drawn to the two central charac
ters at first without comprehending
what the movie is about; once you
begin to work that out, you may dislike
the material (as I did) but continue to
feel pulled in. I'm not sure exactly
what Alan Parker intended, but the
film that resulted is perhaps last
year's most pleasurable oddity.

physically wounded Al (Nicholas Cage) comforts Birdy (Matthew
Modine), who was left emotionally scarred by his own experiences in
the war.

young men — their state a result
mostly of familial tensions — are
tossed into the cauldron of Vietnam
and return stripped to the psychic
bone. The writers have prepared their
own cauldron, a bubbling brew of
1950s Freudianizing and 1960s
depressive rhapsodizing about the
fate of the square peg in the round
hole and the impossibility of the true
lyrical flight in modern American so
ciety. Birdy is a cross between Rima
the Bird Girl from "Green Man
sions" and Peter Pan, and A 1 has
more than a trace of McMurphy from
"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest."
(He sees Birdy's psychiatrist as an
other example of the military author
ity he's been bucking since he entered
the army, and he refuses to cooperate
with him.) "Birdy" could have been a
cult movie 10 years ago: It cross
hatches several countercultural
layers, and there's enough pop psy
chology in it to satisfy everyone.
(Birdy's avian passion brings him
sexual fulfilment, as Al's "normal"
adolescent gropings do not, and
there's a strong hint of unrealized
homosexual attachment in the boys'
relationship.) And Birdy's "flights"
— some actual attempts to fly, and
some mental journeys that leave him
breathless— have a preciousness that
Saint-Exupery would envy.
To put it gently, "Birdy" is not my
kind of material, and yet 1 must con
fess to liking the film quite a bit.
Something almost miraculous hap
pens in director Alan Parker's treat
ment of it that redeems all the psy
chological and metaphysical weight
loaded onto its back. He and his two
leading actors do such a superb job
with the Al-Birdy scenes that the
friendship becomes the essential
theme of the movie rather than just a
useful metaphor for all those other
themes. Parker is probably the most
peculiar of gifted American directors;
he has a taste for cheap, derivative
pop (look at '"Pink Floyd: The
Wall"), and he has no compunctions
about employing his talents to manip
ulate the audience ("Midnight Ex
press"), but when he chooses to sen
sitize rather than numb us, he can be
absolutely extraordinary. His hand
ling of the actors in "Shoot the
Moon" was Renoiresque, and,
working once again with photog
rapher Michael Seresin, he ap
proaches "Birdy" in a "Shoot the

Moon" mood, with attention to deli
cate modulations of rhythm and
quicksilver tonal shifts. When Nicolas
Cage and Matthew Modine are on
screen together you don't think of
Kesey and Saint-Exupery, of Freud
and Laing, or even of the Vietnam
War; you think of the beauty and
comedy of two boys struggling to
wriggle out of the manacles of adoles
cence and forge identifies that aren't
defined by the world that shaped
those manacles. Though "Birdy" isn't
a romance (at least not on the
surface), the film it most reminded
me of was Alan Pakula's 1969 "The
Sterile Cuckoo," with Liza Minnelli
and Wendell Burton as a pair of
young lovers whose dialogue
(courtesy of Alvin Sargent) had a
Salinger-like ironic tenderness. At its
best, "Birdy" has the same authen
ticity of feeling, the same sustained
mood of melancholy and unspecified
nostalgic longing. And Nicolas Cage

(who has been badly served by the
Coppola pictures he's made recently)
and Matthew Modine (who can be
seen in another fine performance as
Mel Gibson's brother in "Mrs. Sof
fel") give graceful, complimentary
performances.
Despite his finesse, and his un
canny way of making a cliche seem
fresh, Parker doesn't score as well
with the sequences that involve other
characters — the boys' parents, the
girls they date and the other adults
whose paths cross theirs. But he tries
something original that sometimes
comes off: He stylizes all of these
scenes, lending them a comic absur
dity, as if only the friendship between
the two boys were real. In interludes
involving a dogcatcher who hires the
boys on (until, in a recognizably '60s
reversal, they liberate his animal
prisoners) and a dotty lady who sells
Birdy a canary, Parker has the char
acter actors to make the experiment

work, and even when he doesn't,
Modine and Cage are sometimes suf
ficient. When Modine dances with a
prom date (to"Rockin' Robin"!), his
distracted movements are so funny,
and so eerily fixed on something in
his head (we can almost catch the
strains of the music he hears), that the
moment is a small epiphany. Parker
sweats to find ways to film the unfil
mable, and really, the fluid transitions
from present to past, and the
transcendent lyricism of Birdy's im
aginary flight after he returns from
the prom, are triumphs of technique
over content. Watching "Birdy," you
feel drawn to the two central charac
ters at first without comprehending
what the movie is about; once you
begin to work that out, you may dislike
the material (as I did) but continue to
feel pulled in. I'm not sure exactly
what Alan Parker intended, but the
film that resulted is perhaps last
year's most pleasurable oddity.


Following his return to the United States after fighting in Vietnam, a
physically wounded Al (Nicholas Cage) comforts Birdy (Matthew
Modine), who was left emotionally scarred by his own experiences in
the war.


Alan Parker, the director of "Birdy," talks to the films co-stars, Nicholas Cage and Matthew Modine, at the
filming site in Philadelphia.
"Birdy" is a good movie in spite of
itself. The screenplay Sandy Kroopf
and Jack Behr culled from William
Wharton's novel, which has ap
parently gathered a cult following
(and which I found impenetrable),
focuses on the intimate friendship of
two high school kids — Al Colum
bato (Nicolas Cage), an athletic,
charismatic boy, and a strange, in
tense outsider Al nicknamed "Birdy"
(Matthew Modine) because of his
passionate interest in birds. The film
tells us that this camaraderie is the
only strong human connection Birdy
maintains as his loving and empathic
relationship with the birds he keeps
and trains carries him farther and far
ther away from the world he lives in;
and that despite Al's attempts to

"socialize" his pal (to initiate him
into sex, mostly) A 1 too feels
threatened by other people — the
consequence of a long-suppressed
rebellion against his tyrannical,
brutalizing father (Sandy Baron). The
story, told in a series of flashbacks,
takes the boys to Vietnam — first Al,
whose departure Birdy sees as an
abandonment, and then Birdy. When
they reunite, dt the suggestion of an
army psychiatrist (John Harkins), Al
has survived a mine explosion and is
wearing a face bandage and a wire to
keep his jaw intact, and Birdy, who
was missing in action for a month, sits
mute in a hospital cell on his
haunches, staring ahead in space —
having retreated into a fantasy of
himself as a bird. The psychiatrist
hopes that these two shattered souls,
these walking war casualties, can

once again bring each other salvation.
The screenwriters, taking their cue
from Wharton but updating the story
to the Vietnam era, mean us to read
