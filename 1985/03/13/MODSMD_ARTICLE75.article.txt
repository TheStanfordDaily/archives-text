# 'Berlin, Jerusalem, and the Moon' explores ethnic conflict

### NANCY HENRY 
The Middle East seems simply too
complex to confront. History,
morality, ethnicity, religion, politics,
emotions merge and interact; the
easiest solution is either to take a firm
stand or refuse to — in deference to a
seemingly insoluble problem. For
Jews the issue is infinitely more com
plicated; however, with increasing as
similation in American culture and
the increased desire to assimilate, the

bond the Jews outside of Israel,

tenuous.
"Berlin, Jerusalem, and the
Moon," a unique and moving play
created by "A Traveling Jewish
Theatre," offers a dramatic, emo
tional, occasionally humorous
presentation of a time in world his
tory when Jews were forced to ad
dress their Judaism. Forced to choose
between the German and Jewish
cultures which were both so much a
part of them. Walter Benjamin,
"Germany's most famous obscure
literary critic" and Else Lasker-
Schuler, "Germany's most famous
forgotten poet," were two figures
who struggled and suffered with their

torn identities as Hitler rose to power
and it became impossible for them to
"disappear" in German culture. In
thir. play, the obsessive, tormented in
tellectual and the sensitive, im
aginative and determined poet meet
on stage. Their individual and shared
sentiments form the focal point of a
production which also combines
traditional, ritualistic and modern
theatrical techniques to broaden the
theme and significance of this power
ful production.
Lasker-Schuler, played with im
agination and sincerity by Naomi
Newman, and Benjamin, played with
studied expertise by Corey Fischer

represent two alternatives for many
of the Weimar Jews — flee to Israel
or commit suicide. The two other
characters, Izzie the K (Albert Louis
Greenberg) and Edie (Naomi New
man) represent contemporary atti
tudes toward the conflict of identities.
Izzie is a stand-up comic. He is also
an American Jew. He provides comic
relief, but like that offered by a sick
joke, it is an awkward relief and an
uncomfortable laugh that rises from
his remarks about the ambivalence of
American Jews; one senses he hits
very close to home. It is through his
fantasy of introducing Walter and
Else that he hopes to define the prob

lem, and this is the play's device for
introducing the audience to the
specifics of a greater theme.
Edie covers her internal conflict
less successfully than Izzie. For her,
being a woman adds a dimension that
makes coming to a comfortable posi
tion on the question of her identity
even more difficult. She is a singer.
She is a mother. She is a Jew. She is a
woman. These aspects of her charac
ter cannot exist in harmony, and her
struggle, like that of the Jewish
people, is a constant struggle for a
meaningful existance. Her fight to
overcome the oppression inherent in
their culture without renouncing that

culture, links her to her mother, to
Else, and to women in general. Her
situation is particularly moving and
important to modern audiences.
Technically and stylistically, this
play is a rare and innovative triumph.
The music is performed on stage. It
ranges from the ritualistic beating of
drums to accompany a physical and
engaging re-enactment of the biblical
and primal struggle of Israel with his
soul and with a more powerful spirit,
to the beautiful, lyrical voice of New
man as she breaks the stillness of the
theater with the plaintive strains of
Mahler, to traditional Jewish folk
music. The set is stark, bare, accord

ing to the lighting either chillingly
bleak or warmingly simple. The only
props are suitcases which blend with
the set and each other. A character
seldom moves without a suitcase.
Where the suitcase is, the scene is.
Where the Jews go: Berlin,
Jerusalem, the moon or America,
they are Jews and must wrestle with
the same spirit their ancestors did and
their children will.
The acting is similarly outstanding.
Mime, puppetry and masks are all
devices that enhance the sheer human

emotion and energy this play
manages to rouse. It speaks to
but it is important for non-Jews, of
fering insight into Jewish culture and
an attempt to foster an understanding
which must go beyond sympathy or
guilt. ' >
It is, unfortunately, rare to find a
theatrical group whose commitment
to a cause — heightening awareness
of a question which is both eternal
and immediate — is so strongly evi
dent. This is theater at its most signif
icant, and it is professionally and en
tertainingly produced. The questions
are not new, but they are real and
persistent; it would be impossible io
leave this play without ethnic, cul
tural, and spiritual identity, Judaism,
and Israel on your mind.
"Berlin, Jerusalem, and the Moon"
will run through March 31 at t&e
Theatre at Intersection in San Fran
cisco.
