Horse Feathers (1912)
U.C. Theater, Berkeley
The Marx Brothers produced their
purest, most unrestrained comedies at
Paramount in the early days of the
talkies. This send-up of collegiate musi
cals was their fourth picture and, except
for "Duck Soup," it is probably their
best. This is the one in which Harpo
brings a fish with a sword stuck through it
to the door of a speakeasy in order to
gain admittance (the password is
"swordfish") and Groucho sings,
"Whatever it is, I'm against it." He plays
Professor Quincy Adams Wagstaff, pres
ident of Huxley College; Chico and
Harpo sign up as students so they can
play in the big football game against Dar
win. and Zeppo plays Wagstaffs son (!).
With Thelma Todd. David Landau,
Robert Greig. James Pierce and Nat
Pendleton; screenplay by Bert Kalmar,
Harry Ruby, S.J. Perelman and Will B.
Johnstone; songs by Kalmar and Ruby;
directed by Norman McLeod.
Plays Saturday with "The Cocoanuts"
and "Room Service."
Airplane! (1980)
Memorial Auditorium
Many people have found this parody
of the "Airport" movies unreasonably
uproarious, but it suffers in comparison
with the (considerably shorter) send-up
Carol Burnett did on her TV show five
years earlier. All of the gags are dumb as
hell, and they are not cleverly staged or
shot. The two young leads, Julie Hagerty
and Robert Hays, don't seem to have a
clue about how to play this kind of broad
comedy; it's a relief when the older pros
— Lloyd Bridges, Robert Stack, Leslie
Nielsen and Peter Graves, all in self
parodying roles — step in.
Plays Sunday evening at 7 and 9:30.
Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936)
Festival, Palo Alto
Frank Capra and Robert Riskin
(adapting Clarence Budington Kelland's
"Opera Hat") prove that honesty is the
best policy when a small-town joe (Gary
Cooper) inherits a large sum of money.
This is the last helping of Capracorn one
could enjoy thoroughly while realizing
what utter nonsense it was; the later ex
amples of his populist hogwash — his
radically altered "You Can't Take It with
You," "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,"
"Meet John Doe," "It's a Wonderful
Life" — infuriate you if you listen care
fully to what they're saying. Much of the
fun in this comedy derives from the
spirited cast (Jean Arthur, principally,
Margaret Seddon and Ruth McWade as
the "pixilated sisters," Raymond Wal
burn, Lionel Stander, Walter Catlett,
George Bancroft, Douglass Dumbrille,
H.B. Warner and Ruth Donnelly). Gary
Cooper, however, is not well served by
the Capra sweetness and light; it reduces
him to something coyly and blandly all-
American. And though his career was to
span another two-and-a-half decades, in
a sense he never recovered from what
Capra turned him into; all his triumphs
— "A Farewell to Arms," "Lives of a
Bengal Lancer," "Desire" — were
already in the past. Photographed by
Joseph Walker.
Plays tomorrow through Wednesday
with "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington."
Sunset Boulevard (1950)
Castro, San Francisco
The perverse, acidic screenplay which
director Billy Wilder fashioned with
Charles Brackett and D.W. Marshman,
Jr. includes the famous meeting between
the two central characters, down-and-out

scriptwriter Joe Gillis and silent movie
star Norma Desmond, which every film
buff can recite from memory ("You're
Norma Desmond. You used to be big."
"I am big. It's the pictures that got
small"), as well as a truly inspired
flourish: The narration is delivered by a
corpse. (Apparently the preview print
opened with a scene in the morgue in
which the cadavers exchange introduc
tions, but the first audiences reacted
badly and the scene was struck.) The
picture, one of Wilder's two or three
best, combines Gothic extravagance with
an insider's view of Hollywood — the
fact that Gloria Swanson and Erich von
Stroheim play characters who are filled
out with slightly autobiographical detail
lends them a certain gossipy allure — and
maintains a cynical tone that distin
guishes it from the usual self
congratulatory tripe Hollywood serves
up about itself. Gloria Swanson's perfor
mance has received much praise, and she
is good, but next to William Holden's Joe
Gillis, she seems hyperbolic and obvious.
This was the film in which Holden came
of age: He gives us Joe's opportunism,
emotional generosity, desperation, self
disgust and self-pity, sometimes in a
single scene. With Nancy Olsen and Jack
Webb, and, as themselves, Cecil B.
DeMille, Buster Keaton, H.B. Warner,
Anna Q. Nilsson and songwriters Ray
Evans and Jay Livingston, who sing a
parody of their own Oscar-winning song
"Buttons and Bows" in the New Year's
Eve party scene.
Plays Saturday with "Queen Kelly."
Doctor Zhivago (1965)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
David Lean's stately epic, adapted (by
Robert Bolt) from the Boris Pasternak
novel, is very long — and seems even
longer. Omar Sharif, who has rarely
proven himself capable of carrying an
entire scene by himself, is asked to bear
the burden of a complicated narrative
spanning several decades (beginning in
Czarist Russia and ending after the
Revolution); not surprisingly, he walks
through it looking handsome but quizzi
cal, as if he had no more idea what he
was doing there than we do. He plays a
doctor who is really a poet; he gets into
trouble with the new regime because he
insists on putting a non-partisan, non
ideological reality down in his verse.
Geraldine Chaplin, ravishing in blue and
pink furs, plays his loyal (and rather
stupid) wife; we can understand his pref
erence for his mistress, Julie Christie,
who injects some life into the movie
whenever she's on screen. The only sus
tained first-rate acting is done by Rod
Steiger, however, as Komarovsky;
Steiger turns a cliche — the seducer —
into a vivid, complex character. With
Ralph Richardson, who has a couple of
grand moments, Siobhan McKenna, Alec
Guinness (it is a David Lean movie, after
all), Rita Tushingham, Adrienne Corri,
Tom Courtenay, Jack MacGowran,
Klaus Kinski and many, many others.
Freddie Young earned the credit for the
photography, Maurice Jarre the blame
for the musical score. (You walk away
wanting to smash every balalaika in the
world.)
Plays Wednesday, March 20.

Body and Soul (1947)
Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley
As early as 1939 ("They Made Me a
Criminal"), Warner Brothers cast John
Garfield as a fighter who becomes en
tangled with mobsters; by the time he
made "Body and Soul," nearly a decade
later, the role no longer seemed fresh, al
though Garfield aficionados generally
see it as his finest performance. It cer
tainly covers all the old "Golden Boy"
ground: A charmingly nervy youngster
who is sore at the world makes a con
quest of a sophisticated woman (Lilli Pal
mer); his boxing brings him in contact
with unsavory types, and going into part
nership with them-corrupts his values; he
hurts an opponent (Canada Lee) badly
and the man eventually dies. Garfield has
done better work than he does here, but
in a Hollywood sense it is his con
summate performance because it is the
quintessential statement of the John
Garfield persona. It's not a very good
movie, though. Robert Rossen directed
an Abraham Polonsky script and James
Wong Howe shot it. With Anne Revere
as Garfield's mother. Hazel Brooks,
William Conrad and Joseph Pevney.
Plays Sunday with "The Quiet Man"
and"He Ran All the Way."
Way Down East (1920)
Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley
D.W. Griffith and Lillian Gish — as al
ways, a magnificent combination. She
plays the innocent orphan in love with
the hero (Richard Barthelmess) and
seduced by the villain (Lowell Sherman);
her fate — the last-minute rescue as she
floats down the river on an ice floe,
headed for the falls — is, of course,
movie history. (Gish came close to
drowning when the scene was filmed, and
her personal "touch" — dragging her
beautiful hair, Ophelia-style, in the water
— impaired her health.) The best scene is
the one cribbed most shamelessly from
Thomas Hardy's "Tess of the
d'Urbervilles": Gish baptizes her ailing
illegitimate child, nursing it through the
long night until the doctor arrives in the
morning; he tells her gently that the child
died hours before, and she cries out — a
cry that you feel you can hear through
the silence of the medium. This is one of
Gish's most exquisite performances, in a
splendid setting.
Plays Saturday, March 23, and Sun
day, March 24, in a new restored print,
including footage not seen since the
film's original release.
The Wild Bunch (1969)
York, San Francisco
In 1967 Arthur Penn's "Bonnie and
Clyde" burrowed beneath the gangster
myth, revealing its underpinnings, ex
amining its implications. Sam Peckin
pah's "The Wild Bunch" accomplishes
the same thing in the Western genre, but
he went further than Penn's death ballet
finale into an agonized, rapturous orgy of
violence. The combination of slow mo
tion and excess has a point: Peckinpah
wants us to understand how final and ir
revocable death is, to demythify it — the
rain of gunfire that cuts down the Wild
Bunch suffices to kill off the legend of
the old West. Slow motion both
preserves the last moment of a dying
man's freedom and accentuates its loss; it
reminds us of the evanescence of our
existence by prolonging the passage out
of it. But Peckinpah, as complex a sen
sualist as Renoir or Ophuls, confuses our
responses; first his camera renders the
actual violence abstractly beautiful, and
then he jolts us out of our esthetic ap
preciation for what he has done by
punctuating it with a horrific thud as each
body collides with the ground. The movie
is a near-masterpiece. Peckinpah and
Walon Green wrote the script; Lucien
Ballard photographed; Lou Lombardo
supervised the editing; Jerry Fielding
wrote the music. William Holden and
Robert Ryan give memorable perfor
mances as friends turned adversaries (a
Peckinpah motif); with Ernest Borgnine,
Edmond O'Brien, Jaime Sanchez, War
ren Oates, Ben Johnson, L.Q. Jones and
Albert Dekker.
Plays today with "Pat Garrett and
Billy the Kid."
Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (1973)
York, San Francisco
This is the oddest, most difficult to
classify of Sam Peckinpah's films. On one
level it fits easily into the Peckinpah
iconography; Billy (clean-shaven Kris
Kristofferson, looking amazingly fresh,
callow and chubby-faced) is the loner
hero and James Coburn is the friend

turned-enemy. On another level it is one
more elegy for the old West, like "Ride
the High Country" and"The Wild
Bunch." But when we hear Bob Dylan's
score, in the Mexican-western style of his
"Desire" album, and we see him on
screen with that other symbol of the late
-1960s /early '70s counterculture, Kris
tofferson, it's hard to believe we're really
in the 19th century. The film seems to
have got its legends mixed. Dylan, cast as
a non-character named Alias, plays the
Dyten enigma, Kristofferson tells him
that "there are going to be some hard
times comin' down," and the film moves
at a druggy, deliberate pace — highly un
usual in a Peckinpah movie. Billy's
friends look like hippies and live in a
(traveling) commune; Pat Garrett has
sold out to the establishment. And the
mood suggests that Peckinpah Viet
namized this Western: There is little
comedy in the film (Chill Wills, as a
profane bartender, supplies all of it), and
no joy at all; instead we get a succession
of dying old men. It's easy to see why
"Pat Garrett" is no one's favorite Peck
inpah, but it has a hypnotic quality — it
lingers in the mind years after you've
seen it, because of the heavy, dreamy
texture and some magnificent imagery.
With Slim Pickens and Katy Jurado (in
the most affecting scene); written by
Rudolph Wurlitzer; shot by John Coquil
lon.
Plays today with "The Wild Bunch."
Independence Day(l9B2)
York, San Francisco
The cast of Robert Mandel's film in
cludes a number of actors who have
proven themselves elsewhere — David
Keith, Kathleen Quinlan, Josef Sommer,
Frances Sternhagen. But the only
memorable performance, and it's an as
tonishing one, is given by the newcomer
Dianne Wiest, as the battered wife
driven to a nervous breakdown by the
brutality of her psychopathic husband.
Aside from her unsettling concentration
and Charles Rosher's photography, the
movie (written by Alice Hoffman) has
nothing much to recommend it except a
lurid intensity that makes it impossible to
turn away or walk out, even when the
material makes you feel a little queasy.
Begins Wednesday, March 20.
One Eyed Jacks (1961)
U.C. Theater, Berkeley
Marlon Brando, sounding a little
mealymouthed in a funny western drawl
with hard "r"s, plays the Rio Kid, who
escapes from prison to take revenge on
his old partner (Karl Maiden), now a
sheriff. Brando took over the direction
when Stanley Kubrick bowed out, and
some of it is rather good, but on the
whole the film seems misshapen and aim
less— compelling but puzzling. (It's hard
to know what Brando intended, or if his
intentions were at odds with those of the
screenwriters, Guy Trosper and Calder
Willingham.) Brando's personality
dominates the movie, though he appears
— perhaps deliberately? — to be an
anachronism in this setting. Pina Pellicer,
a lovely young actress who later commit
ted suicide, plays the woman who loves
him — Maiden's stepdaughter — and
Katy Jurado gives a fine, muted perfor
mance as her mother. With Slim Pickens
and Ben Johnson.
Plays Tuesday with "Once Upon a
Time in the West."
My Darling Clementine (1946)
Cedar, San Francisco
John Ford's third best movie (after
"Young Mr. Lincoln" and
"Stagecoach") is this magnificent
looking Western (shot by Joe Mac-
Donald) about Wyatt Earp and Doc
Holliday — played by two of the most
photogenic actors ever to grace a shot,
Henry Fonda and Victor Mature. The
movie seems to be set at an hour that
belongs to neither day nor night; the sky
is always light, the actors forever in
shadow. And — perhaps because of Ford
— we have come to think of the old West
as caught in this constant dusk. The best
sequences (the campfire scene and the
square dance), with their Remington
lighting, have a mythic quality that the
film cannot sustain — that's the differ
ence between "Clementine" and " Young
Mr. Lincoln"; and it's not quite as enjoy
able as "Stagecoach" (though it comes
close). The cast includes Walter Brennan
(in a rare good performance), Linda
Darnell, Tim Holt, Ward Bond, Alan
Mowbray, John Ireland, Roy Roberts,
Jane Darwell, Grant Withers, Russell
Simpson and Cathy Downs as

Clementine, the (boring) girl from the
East. Sam Peckinpah has paid tribute to
this film on several occasions, notably in
"Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid."
Screenplay by Samuel G. Engel and
Winston Miller.
Plays Friday, March 22, and Saturday,
March 23, with "Stagecoach."
Greed (1923)
Castro, San Francisco
A masterful film, and a legend. Erich
von Stroheim, the most fanatical of
naturalists, shot every page of Frank
Norris's novel "McTeague" for M-G-M;
Irving Thalberg, appalled by the length,
had the results slashed to less than a
quarter, and Stroheim disowned the
release print. What remains is amazing,
though — even in its truncated form it's
one of the landmarks of American silent
film. (John Huston's "Treasure of the
Sierra Madre" is the most famous exam
ple of a film influenced by it.) No one has
ever been able to duplicate Stroheim's
distinctive tone — gleeful yet grim and
ironic. Gibson Gowland plays
McTeague, Jean. Hersholt his partner,
and Zasu Pitts his grasping, avaricious
wife; she gives some kind of a great per
formance, though it's difficult to say ex
actly which kind. Ben Reynolds, William
Daniels and Ernest B. Schoedsack (who
went on to co-direct "King Kong") all
had a hand in the photography.
Plays Sunday with "Queen Kelly."
As You Desire Me (1932)
Castro, San Francisco
One of the most unusual commercial
films ever made in this country. The ma
terial is a play by Luigi Pirandello about
a woman with amnesia (Greta Garbo);
living as the mistress of one man, she
finds when she recovers her memory that
she is married to another. Except for
Garbo, no one involved in this peculiar
enterprise — not the screenwriter, Gene
Markey, or the director, George
Fitzmaurice, or the two leading men,
Meivyn Douglas and Erich von Stroheim
— appears to have any comprehension of
its implications. But Garbo, with her
brooding intensity, her gift for serving
each moment with every fiber of her
being, is the ideal Pirandellian heroine;
she's astonishingly modern, and she turns
so many faces to the camera that she's a
one-woman show. William Daniels is the
cameraman and Cedric Gibbons the
designer.
Plays Wednesday, March 20, with
"Queen Kelly."
The Merry Widow (1925)
Castro, San Francisco
Erich von Stroheim made this version
of the Franz Lehar operetta after the
"Greed" debacle; it's rarely shown but
quite remarkable. Mae Murray plays the
revue dancer who becomes the playmate
of a prince. In the most outrageous (and
most typically Stroheimian) scene, her
three suitors watch her dance through
opera glasses, and the focus of their at
tention determines their characters: One
concentrates on her head, one on her
breasts, and the third on her feet. Only
Stroheim would introduce a foot fetishist

into a Viennese farce.
Plays Thursday, March 21, with
"Queen Kelly."
Stagecoach (1939)
Cedar, San Francisco
John Ford made this hugely satisfying
soap opera Western — perhaps, along
with Howard Hawks' "Red River," the
best traditional Western ever released.
The cast of characters includes a whore
with a heart of gold, a sheltered bride, an
amiable outlaw, a drunken doctor, etc.,
etc., and the cast of actors features Claire
Trevor, Donald Meek, John Carradine,
George Bancroft, Andy Devine, Berton
Churchill, Louise Piatt, Tim Holt,
Thomas Mitchell (who won a Supporting
Oscar for his energetic, boisterous — and
overstated — performance) and an
amazingly young, handsome John
Wayne, well within his range as the
Ringo Kid. Dudley Nichols adapted the
Ernest Haycox story "Stage to
Lordsburg"; Bert Glennon and Ray
Binger photographed.
Plays Fri, March 22, and Sat., March
23, with "My Darling Clementine."
Mr. Smith Goes to Washington
(1939)
Festival, Palo Alto
Frank Capra's homespun whimsy con
tained an insistent populist message that
could be discomfiting — even creepy —
but in this preposterous political fantasy
about the forces of good defeating the
forces of evil in the Senate, it isn't both
ersome enough to completely spoil the
entertainment. Jimmy Stewart gives a
hugely appealing performance as the
small-town hero, Jean Arthur plays the
cynic he softens and the large, impressive
cast features Claude Rains, Thomas
Mitchell, Edward Arnold, Guy Kibbee,
Eugene Pallette, Beulah Bondi, Harry
Carey, H.B. Warner and Porter Hall.
Sidney Buchman wrote the screenplay.
Plays tomorrow through Wednesday
with "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town."
Beauty and the Beast (1946)
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Jean Cocteau directs what is perhaps
the greatest of all fairy tale films. Josette
Day, appropriately, is Beauty, and Jean
Marais is her superb Beast. His castle,
with live heads in bas-relief on the walls
and hands that grow out of tables to pour
wine for his guests, is a cross between
Gustave Dore and Salvador Dali.
Plays Monday and Tuesday with
"Black Orpheus."
The Cocoanuts (1929)
U.C. Theater, Berkeley
George Kaufman, Morrie Ryskind and
Irving Berlin wrote this musical comedy
for the Marx Brothers in 1925; it was
their second Broadway show (after "I'll
Say She Is") and it became their first
movie. Robert Florey and Joseph Santley
directed it, but (as in almost all of the
musicals of the early talkie years) that
meant, chiefly, that they held the camera
approximately fifth-row center of the or
chestra and let it run. It's a dreadful
movie, with a drippy love story and end
less reprises of what must surely be Ir
ving Berlin's worst ballad, "When My
Dreams Come True," but it's full of clas
sic Marxian exchanges. ("Why a duck?"
comes from this picture.) With the indis
pensable Margaret Dumont, Kay Francis
in flapper gowns, Mary Eaton, Oscar
Shaw and Basil Ruysdael.
Plays Saturday with "Horse Feathers"
and "Room Service."
