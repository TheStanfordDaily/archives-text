# World watches a new Soviet leader
## 
### 
MOSCOW — With domestic and international
attention increasingly focused on the new leader of
the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, world
leaders began arriving here yesterday for today's
Red Square funeral of his predecessor, Konstantin
Chernenko, who died Sunday at the age of 73 after
only 13 months in office
Gorbachev's picture was on the front pages of
yesterday's Soviet newspapers, along with accounts
of his acceptance speech Monday to the Central
Committee of the Communist Party after his rapid
selection as party general secretary.
The announcement of Chernenko's death was at
the bottom of the front page and his obituary and
picture were on the second page of yesterday's edi
tions.
Vice President George Bush, who arrived tonight
along with Secretary of State George Shultz, said in
an arrival statement that he would convey Presi
dent Reagan's hopes for improved relations with

the Soviet Union as Gorbachev takes charge.
"We have no greater hope and no greater goal
than to create a more stable and constructive rela
tionship with the Soviet Union," said Bush.
"We recognize that the United States and the
Soviet Union do differ on many important ques
tions," he said. "Nevertheless, we are ready to
bridge those differences and we hope the new So
viet leader is equally committed to finding solutions
to the problems that confront us."
Bush, who has attended the funerals of the two
previous Soviet leaders in the last 28 months, hopes
to meet with Gorbachev this afternoon.
Other dignitaries arriving for the funeral in
cluded heads of East Bloc states, British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher, French President
Francois Mitterrand, Italian President Sandro Per
tini, Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Japanese

Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone.
Preparations for today's funeral, which began at
2 a.m. Pacific Standard Time, have gone ahead
quickly and smoothly, reflecting the speed of the
transition of power from Chernenko to Gorbachev.
After the deaths of Leonid Brezhnev and Yuri
Andropov, their obituaries occupied the front
pages, but in both cases, the succession in the lead
ership was not announced until the next day.
This time, the mourning period has been more
subdued, the lying in state period shorter, and more
attention — both here and abroad — is focused on
the new leader who, at 54, is the youngest man to
take charge in the Kremlin since Joseph Stalin took
over in 1924 at the age of 45.
With the exception of Thatcher, who met Gor
bachev last December during his tour of Britain,
this will be the first recent opportunity Western
leaders have had to meet privately with Gorbachev.
