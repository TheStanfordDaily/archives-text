# U.S. invites Gorbachev to summit
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Seizing
on the sudden turnover of power in
Moscow, President Reagan is urging
newly installed Communist Party
chief Mikhail Gorbachev to come to
the United States for the first super
power summit in six years, officials
said.
Reagan's invitation was carried to
Moscow by Vice President George
Bush, who hoped to meet with Gor
bachev following today's funeral for
Soviet President Konstantin Cher
nenko, who died Sunday.
An administration official who
spoke on condition he not be identi
fied said yesterday that the Reagan
letter proposed a meeting in the
United States, but did not specify a
time.
The official said the president
didn't list any conditions for a summit
in the letter.
On the record, the White House
reacted warmly to Gorbachev's first

speech as leader and made it clear
that Reagan was willing to take part
in a U.S.-Soviet summit whenever he
believed a meeting "would be benefi
cial to the cause of world peace."
Although officials insisted the pres
ident has not backed away from the
conditions he has said must be met
before a summit could take place, the
administration's tone was far more
conciliatory than in earlier years.
Speakes acknowledged that there has
been a change in the "atmospherics"
of the two countries' relations in
recent months.
"If the opportunity presents itself,
we will weigh all the factors, pro and
con, and then the president will make
a decision whether it would be bene
ficial to the cause of world peace to
participate in a meeting with the So
viet president," Speakes told
reporters.
In his speech, Gorbachev called for
a "real and major reduction in arms

stockpiles, and not the development
of ever-new weapons systems, be it in
space or on Earth."
The prospects of a Reagan-
Gorbachev meeting were a major
subject of conversation as the Soviet
Union prepared to bury Konstantin
Chernenko.
Appearing yesterday on NBC-TV's
"Today" program. National Security
Adviser Robert McFarlane said he
believed the Soviet government was
taking a serious interest "that has
been missing in the past" in such a
meeting.
During Reagan's first term in of
fice, the adminstration insisted not
only that a U.S.-Soviet summit be
carefully prepared but also that there
be the prospect of solid results. As re
lations deteriorated following the So
viet downing of a South Korean pas
senger plane and the breakup of arms
control negotiations, administration
officials further conditioned a summit

on a turnabout in Soviet deeds.
Speakes acknowledged yesterday
that over the last year, the adminis
tration had stopped using specific
"pre-conditions" such as the
withdrawal of Soviet troops from Af
ghanistan.
Though he acknowledged a "slight
change" in the administration stance,
he was cautious in discussing the out
look for a top-level meeting. "You
would be doing yourself a disservice if
you run with it much farther than I
am telling you to run with it,"he said.
In a carefully prepared statement,
Speakes said the White House
welcomed "the tone" of Gorbachev's
speech Monday to the Communist
Party's Central Committee.
"We are pleased," Speakes said,
"that he expressed a readiness ... to
participate in a continuation of the
process of establishing peaceful,
mutually beneficial cooperation."
