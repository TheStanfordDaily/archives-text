S WHAT'S
COOKING?
An introductory cooking course focusing on ENTERTAINMENT
MENUS. Each session will begin with "sacred rules" about the
foods being used, followed by group participation in the preparation
of the food.
Attendance is required at each class because techniques learned
each week will be used in the following week's sessions. The
course instructor is Mary Lou Allen, Director of Stanford's
Instructional Television Network and chef extraordinaire.
Enrollment is limited to 10 students. Individual sign-ups will be in
the Governor's Corner Office on a first-come, first-served basis. An
enrollment fee of $20 (to help pay for the cost of the food) will be
collected when you sign up.
Classes will be on six consecutive Wednesdays, beginning on
Wednesday, April 10, from 5:30-7:30 p.m. in the Elliott Program
Center Kitchen.
