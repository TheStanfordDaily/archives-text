STUDENTS
Interested in an internship in Germany?
Beginning Winter Quarter 1985-86, the Krupp Foundation Internship Program
will offer a limited number of internships to undergraduates in the humanities
and social sciences.
Internships can focus on areas such as:
government transportation
public management media
public health psychology
economic policy social work
This is an excellent and exciting program and promises to offer Stanford students a
challenging opportunity to study, work, and live in Germany while continuing to develop
professional skills.
The program will consist of studying at the Berlin center Winter Quarter followed by a 3 month
internship. During the Spring Quarter internship, students will "stop out" from Stanford and
receive a stipend for participation in the internship program.
To apply: complete Berlin application for Winter Quarter and submit it, along with an unofficial
transcript, to Oveseas Studies by May 24. Note that students must have two quarters of
German prior to leaving for Berlin.
An information meeting will be held on
WEDNESDAY, APRIL 10 at 12:00 NOON
in Florence Moore Hall, in Alondra Lounge.
