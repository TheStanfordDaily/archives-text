Thirty-one candidates will fight for
20 seats in the ASSU Senate during
the annual spring elections to be held
April 16 and 17. according to
Graduate Senator Jim McGrath.
In addition, three slates will com
pete for the Council of Presidents. Of
these, one is the Hammer and Coffin
slate associated with the Chaparral,
which often fields less-than-serious
COP slates.
The two remaining slates — the
usual number of serious slates — are
the Four C slate, headed by Senator
Eugene Chen and including Hubert
Cheng, Laura Corser and Randy
Cribs, and the Blue Chip slate con
sisting of three sophomore members
of the Sigma Chi fraternity. Brad
Hinrichs, Noah Croom and Kenneth
Ramberg, along with sophomore Mi
chael Schenkman.
Thirty-six undergraduates filed
declarations of intent for the 20 regu
lar and alternate scats in the senate.

but only 31 qualified. Twenty-five
candidates ran last year.
However, this year again saw the
perennial lack of interest in graduate
senator seats. The engineering district
has two candidates for six regular and
alternate seats. The business, law and
medicine district, meanwhile, has no
candidates declared for six seats.
In contrast, the humanities and sci
ences district recorded an unusually
high eight candidates for eight regular
and alternate seats. This is the first
time in several years that the number
of candidates has equaled the number
of seats in any of the graduate senate
districts.
Of the eight candidates for this dis
trict. six are incumbents and one is
the current senate chair, Eric Berg.
Several of the undergraduates run
ning are also current senators.
"We usually have much older un
dergraduates." McGrath said. Many
