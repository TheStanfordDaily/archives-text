# Petition tests jostle ASSU
## 
### JOYA WESLEY Staff writer 
Senate Chair Eric Berg called a special meeting of the
ASSU Senate last Monday to handle complications arising
from the validation of special fee request petitions.
The petitions of Tuesday Films and ASSURE, an ASSU
project to extend the routes and hours of service of the
Marguerite shuttle, were initially called invalid by Elec
tions Commissioner Kevin Gross. Both, however, were
eventually judged valid and placed on this quarter's ballot.
In order to have her petition re-verified, Graduate
Senator Brita Jaffee, coordinator of ASSURE,
Council of Presidents member Melissa Auchard to post*
the bond for ASSURE because it did not have any money. v *
to do so on its own. Upon learning this, Eric Diesel, coord
inator of Tuesday Films, also requested that the COP post„
a bond for its recount, to which the COP agreed.
Once a group submits a petition, the elections commis
sioner takes a random sample of 50 of the signatures and*«
checks them against the registrar's list to see if the names
match the student numbers. From the percentage of valid
signatures he finds in the sample 50, he infers the
percentage of valid signatures in the entire petition.
Should the petition be found invalid, as in the case of
Tuesday Films and ASSURE, the group has the right to
appeal. To do this, a group must post a $250 bond to have
the petition recounted. If the petition proves to be valid,
the group gets its money back. If it proves to be invalid,
the money is not returned.
Berg and Graduate Senator Jim McGrath expressed
reservations with the COP action for several reasons. First,
since the COP was allocating this money from the
"miscellaneous" portion of its budget, which was
originally $500 but had already been used for other
purposes, the two $250 bonds would put it over budget.
Second, McGrath said, if the COP posts bonds for
recounts, then the element of risk is eliminated and groups
will be more likely to request more frivolous reverifica
tions.
