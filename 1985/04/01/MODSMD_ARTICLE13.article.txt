# University plans for Centennial
## 
### MARC PEYSER 
Stanford will be 100 years old in six years, but
University officials and numerous others have
already started work that will make the 1991
celebration only one of a long line of events com
memorating the University's beginnings.
The March 9 ceremony marking the 100 th an
niversary of the Enabling Act — the first legal step
toward establishing the University — was only the
first of many intellectual, historical and social hap
penings coinciding with key events in the Univer
sity's evolution.
In fact, the official Centennial celebration
doesn't start until Nov. 10. when members of the
Board of Trustees, the Executive Board of the
Alumni Association and the Faculty Senate will
meet here to celebrate the 100 th anniversary of the
University's founding.
In addition to a dinner-dance in San Francisco,
there will be a wide range of on-campus speeches.
Pulitzer Prize-winning History Prof. Don Fehren
bacher will speak on the times of Senator I.eland
Stanford and his founding of the Universitv. The

current dean of Cornell University — the school
that supplied Stanford with 40 percent of its
original faculty — will also address the group.
"We would like to use the occasion of the Cen
tennial to bring to our campus some intellectual
excitement and activity," said Communication
Prof. Lyle Nelson, a member of the University
Committee for the Centennial Celebration.
Although the next major event won't occur un
til May 14, 19K7 — the 100 th anniversary of the
laying of the cornerstone, located in front of the
Quad — there will be many important happenings
taking place between the major historical dates, ac
cording to junior Robert Honeycutt, president of
the Stanford Undergraduate Historical Society and
a member of both the ASSU and University Cen
tennial committees.
Looking to the Centennial as "a symbolic oppor
tunity to engage in an optimal level of debate" on
the role of higher education in American society,
Honeycutt said that he expects many of the events
to be ongoing, and thus not specifically tied to a
historically important date.

The ASSU committee is hoping to generate ideas
and support from the student body through a quar
terly newsletter scheduled to appear April 9. dorm
discussions and University-published papers.
"This is an opportunity to look at the intellectual
tradition of the American universities," Honeycutt
said.
Honeycutt said he hopes to take the lead from
the Carnegie Foundation, which earlier in the year
set up a number of projects aimed at engaging uni
versities to help resolve social and political prob
lems.
The Development Office also hopes to capitalize
on the heightened interest in the University over
the next six years. Provost James Rosse reported
last year that he expects the University to receive
an extra $360 million in gift money over the four
years preceding the 1991 Centennial.
Rosse said the University plans to use the funds
in a number of different areas, from improvement
of facilities and science buildings west of the Ouad
to endowment of financial aid and professorships.
