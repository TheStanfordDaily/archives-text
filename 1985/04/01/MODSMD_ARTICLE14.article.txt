Fighting in Lebanon continues
SIDON, Lebanon — Artillery shelling and automatic gunfire shook
this south Lebanon port city yesterday as Christian fighters battled Mos
lem militiamen and Palestinian guerrillas for a third straight day.
The clashes continued a weekend of violence in which at least 51
people died and more than 140 were wounded, according to police
reports.
The heaviest casualty toll was in Sidon, but a battle also raged in the
hills outside Beirut, and Israeli forces carried out another raid beyond
their occupation zone in south Lebanon.
In Jerusalem, a senior Israeli official said the Cabinet will decide
within three weeks on the final stage of the army's withdrawal from
south Lebanon.
Lebanese police said four more people were killed and six wounded
during yesterday's battles pitting Lebanese army troops, Moslem
militiamen and Palestinians against Christian fighters of the Lebanese
Forces militia in the hills east of Sidon.
Shortly before dark, 15 artillery shells crashed into Ein El-Hilweh, a
Palestinian refugee camp.
The battles brought the toll from the three days of fighting to 40 dead
and more than 130 wounded by official police count. But Sidon's mayor,
Ahmed Kalash, said at least 40 died on Saturday alone.
The Israeli official in Jerusalem, speaking after the weekly Cabinet
meeting, said the Cabinet would set a date for the final stage of
withdrawal within three weeks but gave no indication when the Israeli
' army would actually end its nearly three-year-old occupation.
Iran hits Baghdad in missile attack
BAGHDAD, Iraq — A powerful explosion shook Baghdad early
yesterday, seconds after Iran announced that it had fired two missiles at
the Iraqi capital.
Residents contacted by telephone in various sections of the city re
ported hearing only one blast, but the cause, location and damage could
not be determined immediately. Ambulance sirens could be heard in this
city with a population of 4 million.
The attack followed Iraqi air raids on four Iranian cities Saturday, and
an Iraqi claim that an Iranian warplane had bombed an elementary
school in the southern border town of Jassan, wounding 70 children.
In Tehran, the Iranian capital, the official Islamic Replublic News
Agency — IRNA — said two surface-to-surface missiles were fired at
Baghdad from bases in Iran at 1:59 a.m. yesterday.
The report, monitored in London, also quoted Iranian President Ali
Khomeini as saying in a speech Saturday that Iran would not bow to
Iraqi pressures with its attacks on Iranian cities, but would "end these
pressures with greater pressures."
Yesterday's explosion in Baghdad was the seventh in 17 days. The
Iraqi government has refused to confirm they were caused by missiles, or
listed casualties.
But President Saddam Hussein said in a speech Thursday, "Some
Arabs have given the Iranians some missiles to terrorize the Iraqis. But
the Iraqis, who have been fighting for five years, cannot be terrorized by
10, or 20, or 30 missiles."
Baghdad-based foreign diplomats said last week the Iranians have ac
quired some Soviet-made Scud-B missiles from Libya. Pro-Soviet Libya
and Syria are the two Arab states that have sided with Persian Iran
against Arab Iraq in the 54-month-old war.
South Africa bans indoor meetings
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — The government on Friday
imposed a three-month ban on indoor meetings of 29 opposition groups
in one of the most far-reaching moves against anti-apartheid activists in
years.
The ban followed a month of fierce rioting in black townships that has
left more than 80 blacks dead.
Outdoor meetings have been banned since 1977. Opposition leaders
said the new ban was intended to muzzle the United Democratic Front,
the nation's chief anti-apartheid alliance, and that it would lead to more
conflict.
Minister of Law and Order Louis le Grange said the ban on indoor
meetings covered 18 areas where violence has occurred in recent
months.
Most of the regions affected are in the eastern Cape Province, where
police on March 21 fired into a crowd of black protesters, killing 19. The
shootings in a black township near Uitenhage set off a wave of rioting.
In Washington, State Department deputy spokesman Edward
Djerejian said, "We continue to believe that measures aimed at silencing
legitimate and peaceful opposition to apartheid are not conducive t6 fin
ding a solution to the country's major problem."
The Rev. Allan Boesak, a vocal opponent of the national system of ra
cial segregation, said, "If people cannot meet to voice their protest, and
if open discussion of important issues is banned, the South African gov
ernment will drive the people to other measures in order to express their
feelings."
Israel controls half of West Bank
JERUSALEM — Israel has achieved direct or indirect control of
more than half the land in the West Bank in the last 18 years, and is at
tempting to isolate the area's 800.000 Palestinians, according to a report
released yesterday.
The report said 7 percent of the occupied West Bank lias been set
aside for Jewish settlements, enough to house up to 1 million people.
About 45,000 Jews now live in the territory captured from Jordan in the
1967 Middle East war, not including East Jerusalem, which Israel unilat
erally annexed.
The 98-page report was prepared by the West Bank Data Base Proj
ect, an independent body funded by the Rockefeller and Ford founda
tions. It was supervised by Meron Benvenisti, an Israeli who abandoned
leftist politics in 1982 to monitor demographic developments in the
West Bank.
The report said 567,125 acres of the West Bank's 1,375,000 acres
were seized for military purposes. Jewish settlements, road building and
nature reserves, or were declared unused property of the state.
Severe restrictions were placed on Palestinian development in another
142,500 acres, putting a total of 51.6 percent of the area under direct or
indirect control, said the report, which was compiled from figures offi
cially listed by government.
The report said Israel's policy was designed to "force the Palestinian
population into rigid boxes which prevent natural expansion."
' The legitimate requirements of 800,000 people and their communal
needs are consciously ignored," the report said. The Israelis created a
system "segregated on ethnic lines, a patchwork of hostile, alienated and
severed regions."
Elias Freij, mayor of the Palestinian city of Bethlehem, called the
report "frightening." and said the West Bank should be reserved for the
Palestinians in a political resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
Nakasone reacts to tariff resolution
TOKYO — Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, reacting to a U.S.
Senate resolution urging the Reagan administration to impose tariffs or
quotas on Japanese goods, said Saturday that Japan "must recognize the
seriousness of such a resolution and adopt measures accordingly."
"It is the first time for the U.S. Senate to adopt a unanimous resolu
tion asking us for restraint," Nakasone noted.
He also disclosed his intention to release a special statement on April
9 on frictions between Japan and its trading partners.
Gaston Sigur, a U.S. presidential adviser, will meet Nakasone and
Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe in Tokyo yesterday to convey Reagan's
concern that Congress will enact protectionist measures if Japan does
not remove barriers to American goods.
The Senate approved a non-binding resolution on Thursday, 92-0,
that called on the administration to impose tariffs or quotas unless
Tokyo allows more American goods to be sold in Japan.
It followed Japan's announcement that it will increase auto exports to
the United States 25 percent to 2.3 million vehicles in the year starting
April I.

But President Saddam Hussein said in a speech Thursday, "Some
Arabs have given the Iranians some missiles to terrorize the Iraqis. But
the Iraqis, who have been fighting for five years, cannot be terrorized by
10, or 20, or 30 missiles."
Baghdad-based foreign diplomats said last week the Iranians have ac
quired some Soviet-made Scud-B missiles from Libya. Pro-Soviet Libya
and Syria are the two Arab states that have sided with Persian Iran
against Arab Iraq in the 54-month-old war.
South Africa bans indoor meetings
JOHANNESBURG, South Africa — The government on Friday
imposed a three-month ban on indoor meetings of 29 opposition groups
in one of the most far-reaching moves against anti-apartheid activists in
years.
The ban followed a month of fierce rioting in black townships that has
left more than 80 blacks dead.
Outdoor meetings have been banned since 1977. Opposition leaders
said the new ban was intended to muzzle the United Democratic Front,
the nation's chief anti-apartheid alliance, and that it would lead to more
conflict.
Minister of Law and Order Louis le Grange said the ban on indoor
meetings covered 18 areas where violence has occurred in recent
months.
Most of the regions affected are in the eastern Cape Province, where
police on March 21 fired into a crowd of black protesters, killing 19. The
shootings in a black township near Uitenhage set off a wave of rioting.
In Washington, State Department deputy spokesman Edward
Djerejian said, "We continue to believe that measures aimed at silencing
legitimate and peaceful opposition to apartheid are not conducive t6 fin
ding a solution to the country's major problem."
The Rev. Allan Boesak, a vocal opponent of the national system of ra
cial segregation, said, "If people cannot meet to voice their protest, and
if open discussion of important issues is banned, the South African gov
ernment will drive the people to other measures in order to express their
feelings."
Israel controls half of West Bank
JERUSALEM — Israel has achieved direct or indirect control of
more than half the land in the West Bank in the last 18 years, and is at
tempting to isolate the area's 800.000 Palestinians, according to a report
released yesterday.
The report said 7 percent of the occupied West Bank lias been set
aside for Jewish settlements, enough to house up to 1 million people.
About 45,000 Jews now live in the territory captured from Jordan in the
1967 Middle East war, not including East Jerusalem, which Israel unilat
erally annexed.
The 98-page report was prepared by the West Bank Data Base Proj
ect, an independent body funded by the Rockefeller and Ford founda
tions. It was supervised by Meron Benvenisti, an Israeli who abandoned
leftist politics in 1982 to monitor demographic developments in the
West Bank.
The report said 567,125 acres of the West Bank's 1,375,000 acres
were seized for military purposes. Jewish settlements, road building and
nature reserves, or were declared unused property of the state.
Severe restrictions were placed on Palestinian development in another
142,500 acres, putting a total of 51.6 percent of the area under direct or
indirect control, said the report, which was compiled from figures offi
cially listed by government.
The report said Israel's policy was designed to "force the Palestinian
population into rigid boxes which prevent natural expansion."
' The legitimate requirements of 800,000 people and their communal
needs are consciously ignored," the report said. The Israelis created a
system "segregated on ethnic lines, a patchwork of hostile, alienated and
severed regions."
Elias Freij, mayor of the Palestinian city of Bethlehem, called the
report "frightening." and said the West Bank should be reserved for the
Palestinians in a political resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
Nakasone reacts to tariff resolution
TOKYO — Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, reacting to a U.S.
Senate resolution urging the Reagan administration to impose tariffs or
quotas on Japanese goods, said Saturday that Japan "must recognize the
seriousness of such a resolution and adopt measures accordingly."
"It is the first time for the U.S. Senate to adopt a unanimous resolu
tion asking us for restraint," Nakasone noted.
He also disclosed his intention to release a special statement on April
9 on frictions between Japan and its trading partners.
Gaston Sigur, a U.S. presidential adviser, will meet Nakasone and
Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe in Tokyo yesterday to convey Reagan's
concern that Congress will enact protectionist measures if Japan does
not remove barriers to American goods.
The Senate approved a non-binding resolution on Thursday, 92-0,
that called on the administration to impose tariffs or quotas unless
Tokyo allows more American goods to be sold in Japan.
It followed Japan's announcement that it will increase auto exports to
the United States 25 percent to 2.3 million vehicles in the year starting
April I.
Fighting in Lebanon continues
SIDON, Lebanon — Artillery shelling and automatic gunfire shook
this south Lebanon port city yesterday as Christian fighters battled Mos
lem militiamen and Palestinian guerrillas for a third straight day.
The clashes continued a weekend of violence in which at least 51
people died and more than 140 were wounded, according to police
reports.
The heaviest casualty toll was in Sidon, but a battle also raged in the
hills outside Beirut, and Israeli forces carried out another raid beyond
their occupation zone in south Lebanon.
In Jerusalem, a senior Israeli official said the Cabinet will decide
within three weeks on the final stage of the army's withdrawal from
south Lebanon.
Lebanese police said four more people were killed and six wounded
during yesterday's battles pitting Lebanese army troops, Moslem
militiamen and Palestinians against Christian fighters of the Lebanese
Forces militia in the hills east of Sidon.
Shortly before dark, 15 artillery shells crashed into Ein El-Hilweh, a
Palestinian refugee camp.
The battles brought the toll from the three days of fighting to 40 dead
and more than 130 wounded by official police count. But Sidon's mayor,
Ahmed Kalash, said at least 40 died on Saturday alone.
The Israeli official in Jerusalem, speaking after the weekly Cabinet
meeting, said the Cabinet would set a date for the final stage of
withdrawal within three weeks but gave no indication when the Israeli
' army would actually end its nearly three-year-old occupation.
Iran hits Baghdad in missile attack
BAGHDAD, Iraq — A powerful explosion shook Baghdad early
yesterday, seconds after Iran announced that it had fired two missiles at
the Iraqi capital.
Residents contacted by telephone in various sections of the city re
ported hearing only one blast, but the cause, location and damage could
not be determined immediately. Ambulance sirens could be heard in this
city with a population of 4 million.
The attack followed Iraqi air raids on four Iranian cities Saturday, and
an Iraqi claim that an Iranian warplane had bombed an elementary
school in the southern border town of Jassan, wounding 70 children.
In Tehran, the Iranian capital, the official Islamic Replublic News
Agency — IRNA — said two surface-to-surface missiles were fired at
Baghdad from bases in Iran at 1:59 a.m. yesterday.
The report, monitored in London, also quoted Iranian President Ali
Khomeini as saying in a speech Saturday that Iran would not bow to
Iraqi pressures with its attacks on Iranian cities, but would "end these
pressures with greater pressures."
Yesterday's explosion in Baghdad was the seventh in 17 days. The
Iraqi government has refused to confirm they were caused by missiles, or
listed casualties.
But President Saddam Hussein said in a speech Thursday, "Some
Arabs have given the Iranians some missiles to terrorize the Iraqis. But
the Iraqis, who have been fighting for five years, cannot be terrorized by
10, or 20, or 30 missiles."
