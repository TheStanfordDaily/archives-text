# Salvadorans turn out for elections
## 
### 
SAN SALVADOR. El Salvador — Salvadorans
defied leftist guerrilla threats and turned out in
large numbers yesterday to vote in national elec
tions that were a referendum on President Jose
Napoleon Duarte's government.
One independent exit poll indicated Duarte's
moderate Christian Democrats were running
strongly and might win a majority in the National
Assembly.
At stake were the 60 assembly seats and the
mayoral offices in all 262 communities of this small
Central American country, which has suffered
through five-and-a-half years of of civil war be
tween rebels and the U.S.-backed government.
Only scattered incidents of violence were reported
yesterday.
Vote counting began immediately after the polls
closed at 6 p.m., but official results were not ex
pected before midweek.
An exit poll commissioned by Spanish Interna
tional Network, a Miami-based Spanish-language
television service, indicated that the Christian
Democrats could win 32 or 33 assembly seats for a
majority. It gave the right-wing coalition from 22
to 25 seats, with the others going to minor parties.
In the outgoing assembly, the Christian
Democrats held 24 seats, the largest single bloc,
but the conservative coalition had 34, with two held
by a small party not allied with either side. The
richtists. who were able to block many of Duarte's

reform proposals, had hoped to win 40 seats for the
required two-thirds to overide a presidential veto.
A spokesman for Spanish International Network
said the poll was conducted by 300 interviewers
who took opinions by secret ballot from some
12,000 voters as they left the polls around the
country. The network's exit poll in the presidential
runoff election last May came within four-tenths of
1 percent of the official results. Network officials
said yesterday's poll had a margin of error of 4 per
cent.
In the May election, official results were not
known for three days. There are 2.7 million eligible
voters.
Scattered incidents of violence were reported,
but there were no major clashes between the op
posing forces. Military officials and witnesses gave
these reports:
A Roman Catholic seminary student, Juan Rene
Miranda, was shot and killed and another student
was wounded as they drove to San Gerardo, 110
miles northeast of the capital. A church official said
the attack was by rebels.
In Usulutan province, a Treasury Police agent
died when a mine he was trying to deactivate ex
ploded near Jucuapa, 65 miles east of the capital.
Guerrillas blew up several utility poles north of
San Salvador, leaving some towns without
electricity. Snipers in hills overlooking El Paisnal,

24 miles north ot the capital, fired into the town but
voting was not interrupted and there were no
casualties.
Leftists boycotted the elections, as they have in
the past, saying their candidates would not be safe
from right-wing death squads.
Last week, the guerrillas threatened to mine the
roads, and traffic was light on many high
ways, especially in the eastern third of the country
where rebel activity is high.
The main political fight was between Duarte's
moderate Christian Democrats and a coalition of
the two largest rightist parties, the Republican
Nationalist Alliance, or ARENA, and the National
Conciliation Party. Six smaller parties also fielded
candidates for the three-year assembly terms.
ARENA is led by Roberto d'Aubuisson, who
was defeated by Duarte in last years presidential
election. The more entrenched Conciliation Party
governed for 18 years until 1979.
Duarte's party holds 24 assembly seats, rightists
control 34 and the other two are held by a small
party not allied with either side. Christian
Democrats lack enough votes to pass legislation
and the rightists do not have the 40 votes needed to
override a presidential veto.
The makeup of the assembly after the new mem
bers take office May 1 will decide whether Duarte
can break the rightist hold and implement some of
his programs that have been blocked there.
