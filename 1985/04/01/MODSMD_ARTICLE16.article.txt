# Audit planned for defense contractors
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The House
Armed Services Committee will audit
billings by seven major defense con
tractors — including General
Dynamics and the Boeing Co. — to
discover the extent to which ques
tionable costs are being added to the
price the Pentagon pays for weapons,
the panel announced yesterday.
The audit is being organized by two
subcommittee chairmen who urged
the contractors to follow the lead of
General Dynamics — which recently
withdrew $23 million in questioned
overhead charges — "before our
auditors find unallowable items
among their claims."
Rep. William Nichols (D-Ala.),
chairman of the panel's Investigations
subcommittee, said a team of 14
auditors from the General Account
ing Office and the Defense Contract
Audit Agency will examine the con
tractors' billings over the next 45
days.
Nichols and Rep. Charles Bennett
(D-Fla.) chairman of the Seapower
subcommittee, said the findings will
form the basis for public hearings and
that any evidence of wrongdoing will
be turned over the Justice Depart
ment for "appropriate action."
The auditors will examine billings
by General Dynamics, of St Louis;
Boeing, of Seattle; the Sperry Corp.,
of New York City; the Newport News

Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co., of
Newport News, Va.; Bell Helicopter,
of Ft. Worth, Texas; the McDonnell
Douglas Corp., of St. Louis; and the
Rockwell International Corp., of
Pittsburgh.
"These seven contractors will be
the initial focus of our examination of
allowable overhead expenses," Nic
hols said.
Bennett said the seven were chosen
as a representative cross section of
the defense industry and not on the
basis of any suspicion of wrongdoing.
"We are not pointing fingers at
anyone," Bennett said.
However, many of the companies
already have been identified by Pent
agon auditors as charging question
able public relations overhead costs
to their government contracts.
According to estimates by the
Pentagon audit agency, defense con
tractors have been charging the De
partment of Defense some $140 mil
lion a year in public relations costs,
some of which are allowable under
government regulations while others
are not.
But the audit agency already has
pinpointed millions of dollars of
questionable billings, some for pro
motional "giveaways," some for par
ties, dinners and receptions, and
some for political contributions.
