# Teamsters agree on new contract
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” The
Teamsters and major companies
in the trucking industry an
nounced yesterday they had
reached tentative agreement on a
national contract covering some
180,000 union members.
Negotiations were continuing
between the union and a group of
regional trucking companies,
Regional Carriers Inc. of Kansas
City, who refused to agree to all
the provisions of the pact reached
with the industry's biggest truck
ing firms.
The new three-year agreement
contains wage increases and job
security protection, according to a
statement issued by the
Teamsters.
The statement said the contract
does not contain a two-tier wage
structure. But union spokesman
Duke Zeller, at a news confer
ence, declined to say whether the
agreement contains a lower start
ing wage for new employees which
eventually would be boosted to
the regular wage.
The old contract, which was to
expire at midnight yesterday, pays
Teamsters an average $13.26 an
hour.
"We are pleased that, as our

members asked, we were able to
successfully address au ol tin
greatest concern to them, namely
wage increases, increased health
and welfare and pension contribu
tions, and perhaps most impor
tantly, job security," said
Teamster President Jackie Pres
ser.
The old contract was an aus
terity package that froze wages for
some 300,000 drivers and ware
house, office and maintenance
shop employees.
The union has been negotiating
since Jan. 15 with TMI. The union
announced Feb. 15 that the Motor
Carrier Labor Advisory Council
and Regional Carriers Inc. were
joining the talks.
MCLAC and RCI generally
represent regional, short-haul and
specialized carriers.
The negotiations came at a time
of rapid change in the industry,
which has been trying to adapt to
deregulation which began in 1980.
Deregulation for the first time
turned the industry into a compet
itive free market, making it easier
for companies to expand to new
routes and to change rates quickly.
