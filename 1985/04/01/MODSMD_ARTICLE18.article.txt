MGM hotel case settled
LAS VEGAS — A $76 million settlement was
announced yesterday in a lawsuit stemming from
the fatal MGM Grand Hotel fire, avoiding what
could have been one of the most complex trials in
legal history involving 63 insurance companies.
Alvin Benedict, chairman of the board and
chief executive officer of MGM Grand Hotels
Inc., said in a prepared statement that he was
pleased by the settlement.
The dispute between the hotel and its insur
ance carriers arose in January 1983 after the in
surance carriers refused to reimburse the hotel
for $75 million.
The money sought by the hotel was for all
remaining liability cases filed as a result of the
Nov. 21, 1980 hotel fire, which killed 87 people
and injured hundreds of others.
The insurance companies had argued that the
resort hotel had settled too early and for too
much money with the 1,357 plaintiffs who had
filed suit against the hotel following the disaster.
The only major lawsuit that remains from the
hotel fire is the hotel's $90 million property
damage suit against the Kemper Insurance Co.
and another carrier.

According to the terms of the settlement,
which is to be reviewed by the court for approval,
the insurance companies will pay the hotel $67
million on April 15, 1985. A balance of $9 mil
lion is to be paid in two installments at 12 percent
interest in 1986 and 1987.
The settlement was announced just three days
before the trial was scheduled to begin before
Judge Paul Goldman of the Bth Judicial District
Court of Nevada, who has presided over this
massive litigation since March 1983.
Democrats make plans
SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. — Democratic
senators concluded weekend discussions yester
day on ways to revive their party's winning tradi
tion as Sen. Edward Kennedy dropped hints
about running for president in 1988.
With a speech in New York on Friday and an
unscheduled address here, the Massachusetts
Democrat said he was only trying to participate
in the effort to redirect the party in the wake of
the 1984 election defeats.
But the longtime spokesman for the liberal
wing of the party admitted his continuing interest
in the presidency — calling that "the least well

kept secret of public life."
"The speech I made was directed to the Demo
cratic Party, offering what I would hope would be
positive and constructive suggestions about posi
tions our party should take in the U.S. Senate
and across the country," he told reporters yester
day.
"I would hope that at a time that many in the
Democratic Party are considering future direc
tions that we'll reclaim our legacy as the party of
responsible economic policy, the party of strong
defense, but not one that is over-bloated," Ken
nedy said.
Even as speculation about Kennedy's 1988
presidential aspirations overshadowed the
meeting, Kennedy joined in the praise for the
weekend meeting and for Sen. Robert Byrd, the
Senate minority leader who organized the ses
sion.
"I think this has been an extraordinary experi
ence for all of us here," Kennedy said.
Sen. Lawton Chiles of Florida called the
meeting a "kind of fertilization process."
"Our heads are ringing with all the ideas we've
heard," he said. "The seeds planted here have to
be cultivated and watered."
