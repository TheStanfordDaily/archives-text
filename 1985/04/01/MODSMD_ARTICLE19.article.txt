Parole system flawed
LOS ANGELES — Hundreds of California
felons avoided parole supervision last year by
giving authorities phony addresses that were not
checked before the convicts were released, ac
cording to parole officials.
Other parolees who repeatedly violated parole
and broke new laws were allowed to remain free
on parole.
The failures are symptomatic of a conflict —
and some critics say mutual incompatibility —
between two state agencies that have jurisdiction
over parolees.
The agencies are the state Board of Prison
Terms, an independent body with the power to
revoke paroles and send convicts back to prison
for up to a year, and the state Department of
Corrections' Parole Division, whose agents mon
itor parolees' progress and refer troublesome
cases to the board.
"We march to two different drummers," said
James Hoover, a former member of the board
and now one of its revocation hearing officers.
"The Parole Division is hearing the governor say
we have too many people in prison . .. and so

they're not reporting everything to the board. . . .
The Board of Prison Terms is hearing the gover
nor say public protection comes first — if they
commit a crime, lock them up."
Some Board of Prison Terms officials contend
the Parole Division is not referring all cases that
it should to the board for decisions on whether to
hold parole revocation hearings.
Critics say Parole Division management, ac
countable to the Department of Corrections as
well as to the board, may fail to refer serious
violators — including parolees who evade super
vision. abuse drugs or commit minor crimes —
because they fear the board would send them
back to prison and intensify prison overcrowding.
Parole Division officials deny being influenced
by such concerns or any pattern of leniency. They
referred more than 11,000 parolees to the board
for disciplinary action in 1984.
In recent years, the board has returned to cus
tody more than 95 percent of all violators
referred to it. California's prisons house 50 per
cent more inmates than they were designed to
hold.

400 march for peace
SACRAMENTO — About 400 people, some
of them carrying a huge multicolored cross,
marched 13 miles from the state Capitol to
Mather Air Force Base over the weekend to
demonstrate for peace.
Saturday s walk was the fourth staged in recent
years by the Sacramento Religious Community
for Peace, an interfaith, educational organization
founded in 1979.
Helen l eeley, a spokeswoman for the group,
said the cross was used in the march "to help us
reflect on our personal responsibility for the
weapons stored (at Mather) and the hope which
Easter gives us all."
The Rev. George Zebelka, chaplain to the
Army Air Corps crew that dropped an atomic
bomb on Hiroshima, was the featured speaker at
a rally near the air base.
