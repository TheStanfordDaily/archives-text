# SF Giants to play at Stanford in '86
## 
### TIM GRIEVE Editorial staff 
The San Francisco Giants have signed a 10-year agree
ment to play at a 51,000-seat baseball stadium on the
Stanford campus beginning with the 1986 season, Palo
Alto Mayor Leland Levy and Giants owner Bob Lurie an
nounced at a joint news conference in Palo Alto yester
day.
"This is a great day for Palo Alto, a great day for the
Peninsula, and a great day for the entire Bay Area," Levy
said in a prepared statement. "I'm looking forward to an
exciting future with the Giants, a team that, like sour
dough bread and cable cars, is a mainstay of Bay Area
life."
But University officials are angry about the plan, al
though they say there is little they can do to stop it. Palo
Alto is exercising its legal right of eminent domain, which
allows a municipal government to appropriate private
land for public-good purposes.
The proposed site, a 1,100-acre parcel in the foothills
adjacent to both the Center for Advanced Study in the
Behavorial Sciences and the planned Ronald Reagan
Presidential Library, is completely unacceptable to Stan
ford and may jeopardize plans for the Reagan library,
University President Donald Kennedy said yesterday.
Kennedy, who said he had not been informed of the
plan until Saturday, said: "Stadia attract large crowds and
not a small amount of noise and traffic. This is ill-advised
and ill-conceived, hut our hands are completely tied.
Eminent domain is Palo Alto's legal right, but I had
thought our relations with our neighbors were such that
this could never happen."
Kennedy said he would have no further comment on
the move before a speech and press conference at Kresge
Auditorium today at noon. Spokesmen tor Menlo Park,
which has opposed previous efforts to develop parts of the
Stanford campus, will join Kennedy at the press confer

ence, which will be open to the public.
Traditionally, private owners such as Stanford have had
little luck in fighting eminent domain moves, and it is
unlikely the University will take Palo Alto or the Giants
to court, according to an official from the University's le
gal office who spoke on the condition he not be identified.
Levy said construction will begin on the stadium in
June. Designed by Hale, Irvin & Hendricks, a San Fran
cisco architecture firm, the stadium will cost Palo Alto
"$6O to 70 million, in ballpark figures," Levy said yester
day.
He said informal polling in Palo Alto has revealed
widespread support for a $H million bond proposal that
would be placed on the June ballot, and funds from Santa
Clara County could provide an additional $15 million.
Other funds, Levy said, will come from private donors and
firms wishing to purchase one of 50 "luxury boxes" which
will be built on the second level of the three-deck stadium
and would be priced near $500,000 each. The cities of San
Jose and San Francisco have also expressed interest in
contributing $3 million each.
Lurie was enthusiastic about the deal at yesterday's
Hyatt Rickey's news conference. "1 said all along that we
would leave Candlestick Park after this season, and, to be
perfectly frank, I feared that would mean leaving the Bay
Area entirely. But Leland (Levy) and his staff have put
together a first-rate package, and 1 can't tell you how
pleased I am."
Lurie said he has not decided if the Giants will keep the
San Francisco name. "Clearly there's a certain tradition to
the San Francisco Giants, but we're going to look at this
very closely." When asked if the team might be called the
Stanford Giants, or if cut-rate tickets would be available
to students and faculty here, Lurie said, "I'm just not
ready to comment on those ideas. I haven't had a chance
to talk to Don Kennedy, but I'm sure we'll be getting to
gether soon and discussing ali of this."
