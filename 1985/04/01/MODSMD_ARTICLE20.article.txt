## Poland faces economic crisis, internal strife 
### 
Kathleen Moloney is a Stanford stu
dent who recently attended a week
long seminar on "Youth and Dis
armament" in Warsaw. As the
recipient of the U.N. Disarmament
Fellowship awarded by the Mid-
Pen insula Peace Center, she is cur
rently working in Geneva as a foreign
correspondent for disarmament and
international affairs. Her stay in
Poland inspired some of the following
observations and reflections.
By KATHLEEN MALONEY
Warsaw ... the smell of soft coal
burning. A thick haze made the hush
seem natural The metal tread of the
train station, filled with long, thin,
Giacometti-like men, surrendered to
a pace padded with snow. The cold
night air of my arrival brushed stoic
stares onto the faces that passed.
Poland, strangely enough, reminded
me of Ireland.
A people forged 36 million strong
and deep by the heat of centuries of
war. A land wounded with past occu
pations — a tripartite scar imposed by
the 18th century Russian, Prussian
and Austrian empires. A nation-state
squirming for the independence it of
ficially gained in 1918. An orthodox
Catholic faith born of secular foreign
oppression. High emigration rates,
mostly to the United States, with one
million in Chicago alone. But most of
all, a music in the language, a light
ness of eye, an ironic sense of humor
and potatoes at every meal.
Warsaw is a city of contrasts. The
steel tramway squeaks its way from
the austere, functional blocks of
modern apartment buildings to the
warm earth tones of the Old Town.
Dr. Zhivago seems to hide beneath
the sea of fur caps. Lovely peacocks
spread their colors against the ice of
Park Lazienkowski, where a statue
pays tribute to Chopin and his
Polonaise. A flame is kept forever lit
by the guards chapped with cold at

the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier of
World War 11.
Poland suffered the greatest human
and material losses of all the nations
on earth caught in the winds of the
Second World War. For every 1,000
inhabitants, Poland lost 220, the
USSR 112, Holland 22, France 15,
the United Kingdom 8 and the
United States 2.9 in the Allied
struggle against the Nazis. Material
losses totaled $626 for every Polish

citizen, while two-and-a-half million
Poles were sucked into slave labor.
Another two-and-a-half million were
forcibly resettled, and a total of six
million Poles perished, many of them
in concentration camps.
Any mention of these camps,
whether it be Auschwitz/Brzezinka —
where four to five million died — or
Zagan — where the "Great Escape"
took place — or Treblinka, elicits a
sober and reverent response even in

the young people of Poland today.
On the other hand, any reference to
"The Day After," an American TV
film depicting a hypothetical nuclear
holocaust, provokes little reaction at
all. "Polish adults thought this film
was abstract and exotic, for the scenes
portrayed were less gory or horrifying
than what they themselves saw and
experienced during the Second World
War," explains one Polish friend.
Daily reminders of such atrocities

and devastation render fears of a
future war, nuclear or not, un
thinkable to most Poles. The meticu
lous reconstruction of bombed-out
buildings in the Old Town was made
possible by the precision of the
tableaux of an Italian painter, Can
nelletto. This fidelity to historical
detail and accuracy symbolizes the
tenacity of the Polish spirit and their
pride in their cultural heritage.
A statue of the poet Bolestaw Prus

looms large in front of Gen.
Jaruzelski's palace and spurs two
Polish acquaintances to recall
numerous scientific and artistic
achievements of their compatriots.
They lead me past the museum of the
Polish physicist Marie Sklodowska-
Curie, the first woman to win a Nobel
Prize and the first person to ever
receive two. Over a cup of hot honey,
a Polish specialty, they boast of the
works of Wajda, the famous film
director, and of Nobel Prize winner
Crestaw Mitosz, a poet now living in
Berkeley.
Except for an occasional queue for
food, visible traces of the "hardships"
pressing on the Polish economy are
hard to find. There are still shortages
of tobacco, meat, sweets, alcohol and
flour, but there appears to be no real
hunger here. Food coupons are ra
tioned at schools and workplaces so
that basic items are evenly distributed
among the population by need.
My friend Monika elaborates: "Oh
yes, we still feel the effects of the
1981-82 U.S. and Western economic
boycotts, because we couldn't feed
our chickens for a while — you see,
we import our grain from the U.S. —
or run our butter-making machines,
but now we get along." She adds,
"The nuisance is mostly for the
women, who must stand in lines for
the food and then go home and do all
the rest of the family's chores too
after a long day's work."
Unemployment officially does not
exist today in Poland, but as one stu
dent wryly points out, "Everyone can
find a job, but not necessarily the one
they want." The big economic
picture, however, looks dismal. Much
like the so-called "developing" na
tions, Poland exports primarily raw
materials, such as copper, sulfur, zinc

and coal. At the same time, the
country is aiming to achieve food self
sufficiency by improving agircultural
efficiency and food-processing in
dustries to enhance Poland's foreign
trade.
During the '70s, in spite of
Gierek's pro-Western industrializa
tion investment strategy, the
percentage of highly processed goods
produced in Poland declined. One of
the reasons that the dynamism of
Polish industry collapsed during this
period was that the Gierek govern
ment made such outlandish faux pas
as purchasing British and Phillips
made tractors and even whole fac
tories from the West that were based
on inches, not on the indigenous
metric system. This artificial capital
intensive growth kept inflation down
for a while, but it could not be main
tained as equipment fell into disrepair
and the debt load grew to the bloated
total of $28 billion.
With the coming to power of first
Babiuch, Kania, and then Gen.
Jaruzelski in the infamous coup of
December 1981, Polish trade took an
about-face. Before 1981 over 50 per
cent of Poland's trade was tied to the
West, 30 percent to the USSR and 20
percent to other partners. Now, more
than 50 percent of Polish goods are
traded with the USSR and the West
captures only 30 percent. -
Debt payments came to a complete
halt in 1981, whereas now Poland is
paying off interests on its guaranteed
loans to other governments. Com
mercial loans will soon be tackled, es
pecially as the decision on Poland's

possible re-entry into the Interna
tional Monetary Fund (IMF) draws
near. According to Witold Lipski, co
chair of the Ministry of Foreign Af
fairs in the Sejm (Polish Diet), this
decision will take place this summer.
A severe economic problem in
Poland, as in many "Third World"
countries, stems from the fact that its
currency, the zloty, is non-convertible
and extremely devalued. While the
official exchange rate is $158 zloty to
the dollar, one dollar can buy $500 to
$600 zloty on the black market.
Demand for dollars is especially high
these days because if the Polish eco
nomy is to survive, the government
must pay off its debt in hard currency.
Now, with the dollar so strong and
American interest rates so high, the
Polish government cannot trade fast
enough to pay off even the skyrocket
ing interest rates on its outstanding
loans.
Recent plans announced by the
government to raise food prices
across the board — for the third time
since it seized power — met with
popular discontent and a call by the
underground Free Trade Union,
Solidarity (TKK), for a 15-minute
general strike on Feb. 28. My visit
happened to fall during this week of
planned protest, but most of the Poles
1 questioned were either not aware of
the plans or of the opinion that
it would be an untimely and fruitless
event.
At any rate, the strike was called
off at the last minute by Lech Walesa
and Zbigniew Bujak, leaders of the
clandestine TKK, on the condition
proposed by Jaruzelski that prices be
raised gradually in phases. In just the
time that it took my crowded train to
creak from East to West, prices of 10
basic food products were hiked by 75

percent in the first "phase."
Solidarity, as well as the official
trade unions, condemned this latest
government move as inflationist and
detrimental to workers' interests. Al
though "blue-collar" workers in
Poland receive, for the most part,
higher salaries than do the intel
ligentsia and "white-collar" cadre,
this unified opposition to the price in
creases stems from the fact that
everyone's standard of living is ulti
mately diminished by the higher costs

of such essential items.
When it comes to economic mat
ters in Poland today, such a uniform
response is exceptional. Although
Solidarity enjoyed the support of
around 10 million Poles at the peak
of its activity in 1980 and 1981, its
popularity has greatly eroded in the
face of internal power sturggles, cor
ruption and differing programs of
reform within the banned trade union
and among its five or six major fac
tions.

Moreover, many Poles recognize
the irony in the fact that Solidarity
and other underground groups such
as NOVA and KOS (the Commitee
of Social Resistance) are now advo
cating economic policies very similar
to the ones that they condemned the
previous government for pursuing.
The original reforms Solidarity pro
posed to counter the capital-intensive
development policies of Gierek's
times, seen as having negative conse
quences for all except those running

the state apparatus, have actually
been implemented by the official
trade unions of the Party.
The continuing economic crisis and
the bankruptcy of attempted alterna
tives has led to a situation where "no
one knows what to do, so they are all
fighting against something and the
struggle has become a purely
ideological and political one,' ob
serves the head of the Polish Interna
tional Student Movement for the
United Nations.
Solidarity's emphasis on economic,
political and cultural ties as a reaction
to the repressive social apparatus of
the current military regime is hardly
greeted as a real and lasting solution
to their country's dilemma by most
Poles. Although Solidarity is lauded
as the symbol of detente and the
champion of human rights by the
Western media and in Western
circles, its popularity within Poland
today is tempered by the period of
martial law that just ended in 1983 as
well as the country's economic part
nership in COMECON and military
participation in the Warsaw Pact. The
proximity of the Soviet Union also
helps to explain a certain Polish
prudence that Monika summed up
when she sighed, "We call the Soviet
Union our brother, not our friend,
because when you are little, you must
live in the same house as your
brother, but you choose your
friends."
The roots of resistance are sewn
deep into the fabric of Polish society.
When the Russian, Prussian and
Austrian giants carved the Polish ter
ritory into three parts in 1795, they
laid the groundwork, ironically, for
the rise of the Catholic Church and its

ment for the United Nations.
present-day hold on the Polish
people. Not only did the Church
preserve Polish language, culture and
cohesion through the Catholic school
system and community reunions, but
it fostered a kind of fervent faith that
still pervades Poland today. Ninety
five percent of the population are
practicing Catholics. Each year, mil
lions join in the 300-kilometer, 10-
day pilgrimage from Warsaw to the
shrine of the Holy Mother. Flowers
and candles cover the tomb of Priest
Popieluszko. Recent attacks by the
state against the Church and its

leaders are seen as grave indeed.
What hope do Poles hold today for
their brand of socialism, for a future
of "bread and freedom" as the now
popular song goes? Many take heart
in the continuity of the long Polish
struggle against external domination
and economic oppression. They recall
the Poznam uprising of 1956 against
inequalities rampant in the poorer
cities of the otherwise rich, in
dutrialized "Prussian" part of Poland.
Women take pride in the prominence
of female resisters figuring at the
forefront of Polish history. They cite
the little known fact that it was actu
ally a woman, Anna Walentynowicz,
who inspired the mass movement,
Solidarity. A crane operator at
Gdansk shipyard, she led strikes in

1970 against food price increases and
was arrested in 1980 for laying a
wreath on the graves of those killed in
the 1970 uprising, thus triggering the
formation of Solidarity. The name of
the trade union movement comes
from the call by women workers for
"solidarity strikes" across the country
at the time of her arrest.
The resurgence of the Rapacki
Plan also serves as a symbol of fresh
hope vis a vis Polish possibilities and
the peace movement. This plan was
initiated by the Polish minister for
foreign affairs at the United Nations
in 1956 and calls for the nuclear dis
engagement of Central Europe,
meaning that Poland, Germany and
now Czechoslovakia would be estab
lished as a Nuclear-Free Zone.

Still others are encouraged by the
general amnesty granted to political
prisoners last summer and the local
and parliamentary elections to be
held next October. Many young
people, however, dream of leaving
the country but mention how difficult
it is to obtain the necessary visa and
money. For every 20 Poles who leave
their homeland, only five return. This
enormous rate of emigration indi
cates the deep tears in the social
fabric of Poland.
Alcoholism is a huge problem.
"Some people drink shampoo, eau de
cologne, window-washing liquid or
anti-freeze," states Krzystof
solemnly, "because it is cheaper and
the new law forbids the sale of alco
hol before 1 p.m."

Drugs, especially heroin, permeate
the adolescent social scene, and de
pression is high among adults. As
Dorota, 24, quietly told me one night
in the Winter Palace of Zabrow
where our "Youth and Disarmament
Conference" was held:
"Kasia, you know, the most difficult
thing for me to endure is the psychic
aspect of it all. 1 can bear the physical
annoyances of not being able to get
enough office supplies, for example,
and 1 don't need that much in a ma
terial sense. But the hard part is not
having any hope or action growing
out of me. 1 do not see how I can
change anything on the social or poli
tical levels. Sure, I can always shut
myself up in my room and paint the
walls, but there are so many blocks to

organizing a community function that
young people nowadays say to them?
selves, 'Why bother?' "
Or as the head of the Women's
Commission of the Polish Students
Association said to me over a bowl of
Batsch, "Oh. my life is too short for
all of this. 1 have so much to do, to
see, to dream. ..."
Their voices echoed in my ears as
the train screeched to a halt on the
border of East and West Berlin and
the dogs sniffed under the cars for
possible stowaways. The next day, as
1 stood on the ramp overlooking the
Berlin Wall and its grafitti, 1 threw a
wave to them over the wasteland just
beyond and dreamt of the day when
we would visit each other free of
guards and guns in between.

observations and reflections.
By KATHLEEN MALONEY
Warsaw ... the smell of soft coal
burning. A thick haze made the hush
seem natural The metal tread of the
train station, filled with long, thin,
Giacometti-like men, surrendered to
a pace padded with snow. The cold
night air of my arrival brushed stoic
stares onto the faces that passed.
Poland, strangely enough, reminded
me of Ireland.
A people forged 36 million strong
and deep by the heat of centuries of
war. A land wounded with past occu
pations — a tripartite scar imposed by
the 18th century Russian, Prussian
and Austrian empires. A nation-state
squirming for the independence it of
ficially gained in 1918. An orthodox
Catholic faith born of secular foreign
oppression. High emigration rates,
mostly to the United States, with one
million in Chicago alone. But most of
all, a music in the language, a light
ness of eye, an ironic sense of humor
and potatoes at every meal.
Warsaw is a city of contrasts. The
steel tramway squeaks its way from
the austere, functional blocks of
modern apartment buildings to the
warm earth tones of the Old Town.
Dr. Zhivago seems to hide beneath
the sea of fur caps. Lovely peacocks
spread their colors against the ice of
Park Lazienkowski, where a statue
pays tribute to Chopin and his
Polonaise. A flame is kept forever lit
by the guards chapped with cold at

the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier of
World War 11.
Poland suffered the greatest human
and material losses of all the nations
on earth caught in the winds of the
Second World War. For every 1,000
inhabitants, Poland lost 220, the
USSR 112, Holland 22, France 15,
the United Kingdom 8 and the
United States 2.9 in the Allied
struggle against the Nazis. Material
losses totaled $626 for every Polish

citizen, while two-and-a-half million
Poles were sucked into slave labor.
Another two-and-a-half million were
forcibly resettled, and a total of six
million Poles perished, many of them
in concentration camps.
Any mention of these camps,
whether it be Auschwitz/Brzezinka —
where four to five million died — or
Zagan — where the "Great Escape"
took place — or Treblinka, elicits a
sober and reverent response even in

the young people of Poland today.
On the other hand, any reference to
"The Day After," an American TV
film depicting a hypothetical nuclear
holocaust, provokes little reaction at
all. "Polish adults thought this film
was abstract and exotic, for the scenes
portrayed were less gory or horrifying
than what they themselves saw and
experienced during the Second World
War," explains one Polish friend.
Daily reminders of such atrocities

and devastation render fears of a
future war, nuclear or not, un
thinkable to most Poles. The meticu
lous reconstruction of bombed-out
buildings in the Old Town was made
possible by the precision of the
tableaux of an Italian painter, Can
nelletto. This fidelity to historical
detail and accuracy symbolizes the
tenacity of the Polish spirit and their
pride in their cultural heritage.
A statue of the poet Bolestaw Prus

looms large in front of Gen.
Jaruzelski's palace and spurs two
Polish acquaintances to recall
numerous scientific and artistic
achievements of their compatriots.
They lead me past the museum of the
Polish physicist Marie Sklodowska-
Curie, the first woman to win a Nobel
Prize and the first person to ever
receive two. Over a cup of hot honey,
a Polish specialty, they boast of the
works of Wajda, the famous film
director, and of Nobel Prize winner
Crestaw Mitosz, a poet now living in
Berkeley.
Except for an occasional queue for
food, visible traces of the "hardships"
pressing on the Polish economy are
hard to find. There are still shortages
of tobacco, meat, sweets, alcohol and
flour, but there appears to be no real
hunger here. Food coupons are ra
tioned at schools and workplaces so
that basic items are evenly distributed
among the population by need.
My friend Monika elaborates: "Oh
yes, we still feel the effects of the
1981-82 U.S. and Western economic
boycotts, because we couldn't feed
our chickens for a while — you see,
we import our grain from the U.S. —
or run our butter-making machines,
but now we get along." She adds,
"The nuisance is mostly for the
women, who must stand in lines for
the food and then go home and do all
the rest of the family's chores too
after a long day's work."
Unemployment officially does not
exist today in Poland, but as one stu
dent wryly points out, "Everyone can
find a job, but not necessarily the one
they want." The big economic
picture, however, looks dismal. Much
like the so-called "developing" na
tions, Poland exports primarily raw
materials, such as copper, sulfur, zinc

and coal. At the same time, the
country is aiming to achieve food self
sufficiency by improving agircultural
efficiency and food-processing in
dustries to enhance Poland's foreign
trade.
During the '70s, in spite of
Gierek's pro-Western industrializa
tion investment strategy, the
percentage of highly processed goods
produced in Poland declined. One of
the reasons that the dynamism of
Polish industry collapsed during this
period was that the Gierek govern
ment made such outlandish faux pas
as purchasing British and Phillips
made tractors and even whole fac
tories from the West that were based
on inches, not on the indigenous
metric system. This artificial capital
intensive growth kept inflation down
for a while, but it could not be main
tained as equipment fell into disrepair
and the debt load grew to the bloated
total of $28 billion.
With the coming to power of first
Babiuch, Kania, and then Gen.
Jaruzelski in the infamous coup of
December 1981, Polish trade took an
about-face. Before 1981 over 50 per
cent of Poland's trade was tied to the
West, 30 percent to the USSR and 20
percent to other partners. Now, more
than 50 percent of Polish goods are
traded with the USSR and the West
captures only 30 percent. -
Debt payments came to a complete
halt in 1981, whereas now Poland is
paying off interests on its guaranteed
loans to other governments. Com
mercial loans will soon be tackled, es
pecially as the decision on Poland's

possible re-entry into the Interna
tional Monetary Fund (IMF) draws
near. According to Witold Lipski, co
chair of the Ministry of Foreign Af
fairs in the Sejm (Polish Diet), this
decision will take place this summer.
A severe economic problem in
Poland, as in many "Third World"
countries, stems from the fact that its
currency, the zloty, is non-convertible
and extremely devalued. While the
official exchange rate is $158 zloty to
the dollar, one dollar can buy $500 to
$600 zloty on the black market.
Demand for dollars is especially high
these days because if the Polish eco
nomy is to survive, the government
must pay off its debt in hard currency.
Now, with the dollar so strong and
American interest rates so high, the
Polish government cannot trade fast
enough to pay off even the skyrocket
ing interest rates on its outstanding
loans.
Recent plans announced by the
government to raise food prices
across the board — for the third time
since it seized power — met with
popular discontent and a call by the
underground Free Trade Union,
Solidarity (TKK), for a 15-minute
general strike on Feb. 28. My visit
happened to fall during this week of
planned protest, but most of the Poles
1 questioned were either not aware of
the plans or of the opinion that
it would be an untimely and fruitless
event.
At any rate, the strike was called
off at the last minute by Lech Walesa
and Zbigniew Bujak, leaders of the
clandestine TKK, on the condition
proposed by Jaruzelski that prices be
raised gradually in phases. In just the
time that it took my crowded train to
creak from East to West, prices of 10
basic food products were hiked by 75

percent in the first "phase."
Solidarity, as well as the official
trade unions, condemned this latest
government move as inflationist and
detrimental to workers' interests. Al
though "blue-collar" workers in
Poland receive, for the most part,
higher salaries than do the intel
ligentsia and "white-collar" cadre,
this unified opposition to the price in
creases stems from the fact that
everyone's standard of living is ulti
mately diminished by the higher costs

of such essential items.
When it comes to economic mat
ters in Poland today, such a uniform
response is exceptional. Although
Solidarity enjoyed the support of
around 10 million Poles at the peak
of its activity in 1980 and 1981, its
popularity has greatly eroded in the
face of internal power sturggles, cor
ruption and differing programs of
reform within the banned trade union
and among its five or six major fac
tions.

Moreover, many Poles recognize
the irony in the fact that Solidarity
and other underground groups such
as NOVA and KOS (the Commitee
of Social Resistance) are now advo
cating economic policies very similar
to the ones that they condemned the
previous government for pursuing.
The original reforms Solidarity pro
posed to counter the capital-intensive
development policies of Gierek's
times, seen as having negative conse
quences for all except those running

the state apparatus, have actually
been implemented by the official
trade unions of the Party.
The continuing economic crisis and
the bankruptcy of attempted alterna
tives has led to a situation where "no
one knows what to do, so they are all
fighting against something and the
struggle has become a purely
ideological and political one,' ob
serves the head of the Polish Interna
tional Student Movement for the
United Nations.
Solidarity's emphasis on economic,
political and cultural ties as a reaction
to the repressive social apparatus of
the current military regime is hardly
greeted as a real and lasting solution
to their country's dilemma by most
Poles. Although Solidarity is lauded
as the symbol of detente and the
champion of human rights by the
Western media and in Western
circles, its popularity within Poland
today is tempered by the period of
martial law that just ended in 1983 as
well as the country's economic part
nership in COMECON and military
participation in the Warsaw Pact. The
proximity of the Soviet Union also
helps to explain a certain Polish
prudence that Monika summed up
when she sighed, "We call the Soviet
Union our brother, not our friend,
because when you are little, you must
live in the same house as your
brother, but you choose your
friends."
The roots of resistance are sewn
deep into the fabric of Polish society.
When the Russian, Prussian and
Austrian giants carved the Polish ter
ritory into three parts in 1795, they
laid the groundwork, ironically, for
the rise of the Catholic Church and its

ment for the United Nations.
present-day hold on the Polish
people. Not only did the Church
preserve Polish language, culture and
cohesion through the Catholic school
system and community reunions, but
it fostered a kind of fervent faith that
still pervades Poland today. Ninety
five percent of the population are
practicing Catholics. Each year, mil
lions join in the 300-kilometer, 10-
day pilgrimage from Warsaw to the
shrine of the Holy Mother. Flowers
and candles cover the tomb of Priest
Popieluszko. Recent attacks by the
state against the Church and its

leaders are seen as grave indeed.
What hope do Poles hold today for
their brand of socialism, for a future
of "bread and freedom" as the now
popular song goes? Many take heart
in the continuity of the long Polish
struggle against external domination
and economic oppression. They recall
the Poznam uprising of 1956 against
inequalities rampant in the poorer
cities of the otherwise rich, in
dutrialized "Prussian" part of Poland.
Women take pride in the prominence
of female resisters figuring at the
forefront of Polish history. They cite
the little known fact that it was actu
ally a woman, Anna Walentynowicz,
who inspired the mass movement,
Solidarity. A crane operator at
Gdansk shipyard, she led strikes in

1970 against food price increases and
was arrested in 1980 for laying a
wreath on the graves of those killed in
the 1970 uprising, thus triggering the
formation of Solidarity. The name of
the trade union movement comes
from the call by women workers for
"solidarity strikes" across the country
at the time of her arrest.
The resurgence of the Rapacki
Plan also serves as a symbol of fresh
hope vis a vis Polish possibilities and
the peace movement. This plan was
initiated by the Polish minister for
foreign affairs at the United Nations
in 1956 and calls for the nuclear dis
engagement of Central Europe,
meaning that Poland, Germany and
now Czechoslovakia would be estab
lished as a Nuclear-Free Zone.

Still others are encouraged by the
general amnesty granted to political
prisoners last summer and the local
and parliamentary elections to be
held next October. Many young
people, however, dream of leaving
the country but mention how difficult
it is to obtain the necessary visa and
money. For every 20 Poles who leave
their homeland, only five return. This
enormous rate of emigration indi
cates the deep tears in the social
fabric of Poland.
Alcoholism is a huge problem.
"Some people drink shampoo, eau de
cologne, window-washing liquid or
anti-freeze," states Krzystof
solemnly, "because it is cheaper and
the new law forbids the sale of alco
hol before 1 p.m."

Drugs, especially heroin, permeate
the adolescent social scene, and de
pression is high among adults. As
Dorota, 24, quietly told me one night
in the Winter Palace of Zabrow
where our "Youth and Disarmament
Conference" was held:
"Kasia, you know, the most difficult
thing for me to endure is the psychic
aspect of it all. 1 can bear the physical
annoyances of not being able to get
enough office supplies, for example,
and 1 don't need that much in a ma
terial sense. But the hard part is not
having any hope or action growing
out of me. 1 do not see how I can
change anything on the social or poli
tical levels. Sure, I can always shut
myself up in my room and paint the
walls, but there are so many blocks to

observations and reflections.
By KATHLEEN MALONEY
Warsaw ... the smell of soft coal
burning. A thick haze made the hush
seem natural The metal tread of the
train station, filled with long, thin,
Giacometti-like men, surrendered to
a pace padded with snow. The cold
night air of my arrival brushed stoic
stares onto the faces that passed.
Poland, strangely enough, reminded
me of Ireland.
A people forged 36 million strong
and deep by the heat of centuries of
war. A land wounded with past occu
pations — a tripartite scar imposed by
the 18th century Russian, Prussian
and Austrian empires. A nation-state
squirming for the independence it of
ficially gained in 1918. An orthodox
Catholic faith born of secular foreign
oppression. High emigration rates,
mostly to the United States, with one
million in Chicago alone. But most of
all, a music in the language, a light
ness of eye, an ironic sense of humor
and potatoes at every meal.
Warsaw is a city of contrasts. The
steel tramway squeaks its way from
the austere, functional blocks of
modern apartment buildings to the
warm earth tones of the Old Town.
Dr. Zhivago seems to hide beneath
the sea of fur caps. Lovely peacocks
spread their colors against the ice of
Park Lazienkowski, where a statue
pays tribute to Chopin and his
Polonaise. A flame is kept forever lit
by the guards chapped with cold at

the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier of
World War 11.
Poland suffered the greatest human
and material losses of all the nations
on earth caught in the winds of the
Second World War. For every 1,000
inhabitants, Poland lost 220, the
USSR 112, Holland 22, France 15,
the United Kingdom 8 and the
United States 2.9 in the Allied
struggle against the Nazis. Material
losses totaled $626 for every Polish

citizen, while two-and-a-half million
Poles were sucked into slave labor.
Another two-and-a-half million were
forcibly resettled, and a total of six
million Poles perished, many of them
in concentration camps.
Any mention of these camps,
whether it be Auschwitz/Brzezinka —
where four to five million died — or
Zagan — where the "Great Escape"
took place — or Treblinka, elicits a
sober and reverent response even in

the young people of Poland today.
On the other hand, any reference to
"The Day After," an American TV
film depicting a hypothetical nuclear
holocaust, provokes little reaction at
all. "Polish adults thought this film
was abstract and exotic, for the scenes
portrayed were less gory or horrifying
than what they themselves saw and
experienced during the Second World
War," explains one Polish friend.
Daily reminders of such atrocities

and devastation render fears of a
future war, nuclear or not, un
thinkable to most Poles. The meticu
lous reconstruction of bombed-out
buildings in the Old Town was made
possible by the precision of the
tableaux of an Italian painter, Can
nelletto. This fidelity to historical
detail and accuracy symbolizes the
tenacity of the Polish spirit and their
pride in their cultural heritage.
A statue of the poet Bolestaw Prus

looms large in front of Gen.
Jaruzelski's palace and spurs two
Polish acquaintances to recall
numerous scientific and artistic
achievements of their compatriots.
They lead me past the museum of the
Polish physicist Marie Sklodowska-
Curie, the first woman to win a Nobel
Prize and the first person to ever
receive two. Over a cup of hot honey,
a Polish specialty, they boast of the
works of Wajda, the famous film
director, and of Nobel Prize winner
Crestaw Mitosz, a poet now living in
Berkeley.
Except for an occasional queue for
food, visible traces of the "hardships"
pressing on the Polish economy are
hard to find. There are still shortages
of tobacco, meat, sweets, alcohol and
flour, but there appears to be no real
hunger here. Food coupons are ra
tioned at schools and workplaces so
that basic items are evenly distributed
among the population by need.
My friend Monika elaborates: "Oh
yes, we still feel the effects of the
1981-82 U.S. and Western economic
boycotts, because we couldn't feed
our chickens for a while — you see,
we import our grain from the U.S. —
or run our butter-making machines,
but now we get along." She adds,
"The nuisance is mostly for the
women, who must stand in lines for
the food and then go home and do all
the rest of the family's chores too
after a long day's work."
Unemployment officially does not
exist today in Poland, but as one stu
dent wryly points out, "Everyone can
find a job, but not necessarily the one
they want." The big economic
picture, however, looks dismal. Much
like the so-called "developing" na
tions, Poland exports primarily raw
materials, such as copper, sulfur, zinc

and coal. At the same time, the
country is aiming to achieve food self
sufficiency by improving agircultural
efficiency and food-processing in
dustries to enhance Poland's foreign
trade.
During the '70s, in spite of
Gierek's pro-Western industrializa
tion investment strategy, the
percentage of highly processed goods
produced in Poland declined. One of
the reasons that the dynamism of
Polish industry collapsed during this
period was that the Gierek govern
ment made such outlandish faux pas
as purchasing British and Phillips
made tractors and even whole fac
tories from the West that were based
on inches, not on the indigenous
metric system. This artificial capital
intensive growth kept inflation down
for a while, but it could not be main
tained as equipment fell into disrepair
and the debt load grew to the bloated
total of $28 billion.
With the coming to power of first
Babiuch, Kania, and then Gen.
Jaruzelski in the infamous coup of
December 1981, Polish trade took an
about-face. Before 1981 over 50 per
cent of Poland's trade was tied to the
West, 30 percent to the USSR and 20
percent to other partners. Now, more
than 50 percent of Polish goods are
traded with the USSR and the West
captures only 30 percent. -
Debt payments came to a complete
halt in 1981, whereas now Poland is
paying off interests on its guaranteed
loans to other governments. Com
mercial loans will soon be tackled, es
pecially as the decision on Poland's

possible re-entry into the Interna
tional Monetary Fund (IMF) draws
near. According to Witold Lipski, co
chair of the Ministry of Foreign Af
fairs in the Sejm (Polish Diet), this
decision will take place this summer.
A severe economic problem in
Poland, as in many "Third World"
countries, stems from the fact that its
currency, the zloty, is non-convertible
and extremely devalued. While the
official exchange rate is $158 zloty to
the dollar, one dollar can buy $500 to
$600 zloty on the black market.
Demand for dollars is especially high
these days because if the Polish eco
nomy is to survive, the government
must pay off its debt in hard currency.
Now, with the dollar so strong and
American interest rates so high, the
Polish government cannot trade fast
enough to pay off even the skyrocket
ing interest rates on its outstanding
loans.
Recent plans announced by the
government to raise food prices
across the board — for the third time
since it seized power — met with
popular discontent and a call by the
underground Free Trade Union,
Solidarity (TKK), for a 15-minute
general strike on Feb. 28. My visit
happened to fall during this week of
planned protest, but most of the Poles
1 questioned were either not aware of
the plans or of the opinion that
it would be an untimely and fruitless
event.
At any rate, the strike was called
off at the last minute by Lech Walesa
and Zbigniew Bujak, leaders of the
clandestine TKK, on the condition
proposed by Jaruzelski that prices be
raised gradually in phases. In just the
time that it took my crowded train to
creak from East to West, prices of 10
basic food products were hiked by 75

percent in the first "phase."
Solidarity, as well as the official
trade unions, condemned this latest
government move as inflationist and
detrimental to workers' interests. Al
though "blue-collar" workers in
Poland receive, for the most part,
higher salaries than do the intel
ligentsia and "white-collar" cadre,
this unified opposition to the price in
creases stems from the fact that
everyone's standard of living is ulti
mately diminished by the higher costs

of such essential items.
When it comes to economic mat
ters in Poland today, such a uniform
response is exceptional. Although
Solidarity enjoyed the support of
around 10 million Poles at the peak
of its activity in 1980 and 1981, its
popularity has greatly eroded in the
face of internal power sturggles, cor
ruption and differing programs of
reform within the banned trade union
and among its five or six major fac
tions.

Moreover, many Poles recognize
the irony in the fact that Solidarity
and other underground groups such
as NOVA and KOS (the Commitee
of Social Resistance) are now advo
cating economic policies very similar
to the ones that they condemned the
previous government for pursuing.
The original reforms Solidarity pro
posed to counter the capital-intensive
development policies of Gierek's
times, seen as having negative conse
quences for all except those running

the state apparatus, have actually
been implemented by the official
trade unions of the Party.
The continuing economic crisis and
the bankruptcy of attempted alterna
tives has led to a situation where "no
one knows what to do, so they are all
fighting against something and the
struggle has become a purely
ideological and political one,' ob
serves the head of the Polish Interna
tional Student Movement for the
United Nations.
Solidarity's emphasis on economic,
political and cultural ties as a reaction
to the repressive social apparatus of
the current military regime is hardly
greeted as a real and lasting solution
to their country's dilemma by most
Poles. Although Solidarity is lauded
as the symbol of detente and the
champion of human rights by the
Western media and in Western
circles, its popularity within Poland
today is tempered by the period of
martial law that just ended in 1983 as
well as the country's economic part
nership in COMECON and military
participation in the Warsaw Pact. The
proximity of the Soviet Union also
helps to explain a certain Polish
prudence that Monika summed up
when she sighed, "We call the Soviet
Union our brother, not our friend,
because when you are little, you must
live in the same house as your
brother, but you choose your
friends."
The roots of resistance are sewn
deep into the fabric of Polish society.
When the Russian, Prussian and
Austrian giants carved the Polish ter
ritory into three parts in 1795, they
laid the groundwork, ironically, for
the rise of the Catholic Church and its

ment for the United Nations.
present-day hold on the Polish
people. Not only did the Church
preserve Polish language, culture and
cohesion through the Catholic school
system and community reunions, but
it fostered a kind of fervent faith that
still pervades Poland today. Ninety
five percent of the population are
practicing Catholics. Each year, mil
lions join in the 300-kilometer, 10-
day pilgrimage from Warsaw to the
shrine of the Holy Mother. Flowers
and candles cover the tomb of Priest
Popieluszko. Recent attacks by the
state against the Church and its

leaders are seen as grave indeed.
What hope do Poles hold today for
their brand of socialism, for a future
of "bread and freedom" as the now
popular song goes? Many take heart
in the continuity of the long Polish
struggle against external domination
and economic oppression. They recall
the Poznam uprising of 1956 against
inequalities rampant in the poorer
cities of the otherwise rich, in
dutrialized "Prussian" part of Poland.
Women take pride in the prominence
of female resisters figuring at the
forefront of Polish history. They cite
the little known fact that it was actu
ally a woman, Anna Walentynowicz,
who inspired the mass movement,
Solidarity. A crane operator at
Gdansk shipyard, she led strikes in

1970 against food price increases and
was arrested in 1980 for laying a
wreath on the graves of those killed in
the 1970 uprising, thus triggering the
formation of Solidarity. The name of
the trade union movement comes
from the call by women workers for
"solidarity strikes" across the country
at the time of her arrest.
The resurgence of the Rapacki
Plan also serves as a symbol of fresh
hope vis a vis Polish possibilities and
the peace movement. This plan was
initiated by the Polish minister for
foreign affairs at the United Nations
in 1956 and calls for the nuclear dis
engagement of Central Europe,
meaning that Poland, Germany and
now Czechoslovakia would be estab
lished as a Nuclear-Free Zone.

Still others are encouraged by the
general amnesty granted to political
prisoners last summer and the local
and parliamentary elections to be
held next October. Many young
people, however, dream of leaving
the country but mention how difficult
it is to obtain the necessary visa and
money. For every 20 Poles who leave
their homeland, only five return. This
enormous rate of emigration indi
cates the deep tears in the social
fabric of Poland.
Alcoholism is a huge problem.
"Some people drink shampoo, eau de
cologne, window-washing liquid or
anti-freeze," states Krzystof
solemnly, "because it is cheaper and
the new law forbids the sale of alco
hol before 1 p.m."

Drugs, especially heroin, permeate
the adolescent social scene, and de
pression is high among adults. As
Dorota, 24, quietly told me one night
in the Winter Palace of Zabrow
where our "Youth and Disarmament
Conference" was held:
"Kasia, you know, the most difficult
thing for me to endure is the psychic
aspect of it all. 1 can bear the physical
annoyances of not being able to get

their homeland, only five return. This
enormous rate of emigration indi

fabric of Poland.

observations and reflections.
By KATHLEEN MALONEY
Warsaw ... the smell of soft coal
burning. A thick haze made the hush
seem natural The metal tread of the
train station, filled with long, thin,
Giacometti-like men, surrendered to
a pace padded with snow. The cold
night air of my arrival brushed stoic
stares onto the faces that passed.
Poland, strangely enough, reminded
me of Ireland.
A people forged 36 million strong
and deep by the heat of centuries of
war. A land wounded with past occu
pations — a tripartite scar imposed by
the 18th century Russian, Prussian
and Austrian empires. A nation-state
squirming for the independence it of
ficially gained in 1918. An orthodox
Catholic faith born of secular foreign
oppression. High emigration rates,
mostly to the United States, with one
million in Chicago alone. But most of
all, a music in the language, a light
ness of eye, an ironic sense of humor
and potatoes at every meal.
Warsaw is a city of contrasts. The
steel tramway squeaks its way from
the austere, functional blocks of
modern apartment buildings to the
warm earth tones of the Old Town.
Dr. Zhivago seems to hide beneath
the sea of fur caps. Lovely peacocks
spread their colors against the ice of
Park Lazienkowski, where a statue
pays tribute to Chopin and his
Polonaise. A flame is kept forever lit
by the guards chapped with cold at

the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier of
World War 11.
Poland suffered the greatest human
and material losses of all the nations
on earth caught in the winds of the
Second World War. For every 1,000
inhabitants, Poland lost 220, the
USSR 112, Holland 22, France 15,
the United Kingdom 8 and the
United States 2.9 in the Allied
struggle against the Nazis. Material
losses totaled $626 for every Polish

citizen, while two-and-a-half million
Poles were sucked into slave labor.
Another two-and-a-half million were
forcibly resettled, and a total of six
million Poles perished, many of them
in concentration camps.
Any mention of these camps,
whether it be Auschwitz/Brzezinka —
where four to five million died — or
Zagan — where the "Great Escape"
took place — or Treblinka, elicits a
sober and reverent response even in

the young people of Poland today.
On the other hand, any reference to
"The Day After," an American TV
film depicting a hypothetical nuclear
holocaust, provokes little reaction at
all. "Polish adults thought this film
was abstract and exotic, for the scenes
portrayed were less gory or horrifying
than what they themselves saw and
experienced during the Second World
War," explains one Polish friend.
Daily reminders of such atrocities

and devastation render fears of a
future war, nuclear or not, un
thinkable to most Poles. The meticu
lous reconstruction of bombed-out
buildings in the Old Town was made
possible by the precision of the
tableaux of an Italian painter, Can
nelletto. This fidelity to historical
detail and accuracy symbolizes the
tenacity of the Polish spirit and their
pride in their cultural heritage.
A statue of the poet Bolestaw Prus

looms large in front of Gen.
Jaruzelski's palace and spurs two
Polish acquaintances to recall
numerous scientific and artistic
achievements of their compatriots.
They lead me past the museum of the
Polish physicist Marie Sklodowska-
Curie, the first woman to win a Nobel
Prize and the first person to ever
receive two. Over a cup of hot honey,
a Polish specialty, they boast of the
works of Wajda, the famous film
director, and of Nobel Prize winner
Crestaw Mitosz, a poet now living in
Berkeley.
Except for an occasional queue for
food, visible traces of the "hardships"
pressing on the Polish economy are
hard to find. There are still shortages
of tobacco, meat, sweets, alcohol and
flour, but there appears to be no real
hunger here. Food coupons are ra
tioned at schools and workplaces so
that basic items are evenly distributed
among the population by need.
My friend Monika elaborates: "Oh
yes, we still feel the effects of the
1981-82 U.S. and Western economic
boycotts, because we couldn't feed
our chickens for a while — you see,
we import our grain from the U.S. —
or run our butter-making machines,
but now we get along." She adds,
"The nuisance is mostly for the
women, who must stand in lines for
the food and then go home and do all
the rest of the family's chores too
after a long day's work."
Unemployment officially does not
exist today in Poland, but as one stu
dent wryly points out, "Everyone can
find a job, but not necessarily the one
they want." The big economic
picture, however, looks dismal. Much
like the so-called "developing" na
tions, Poland exports primarily raw
materials, such as copper, sulfur, zinc

and coal. At the same time, the
country is aiming to achieve food self
sufficiency by improving agircultural
efficiency and food-processing in
dustries to enhance Poland's foreign
trade.
During the '70s, in spite of
Gierek's pro-Western industrializa
tion investment strategy, the
percentage of highly processed goods
produced in Poland declined. One of
the reasons that the dynamism of
Polish industry collapsed during this
period was that the Gierek govern
ment made such outlandish faux pas
as purchasing British and Phillips
made tractors and even whole fac
tories from the West that were based
on inches, not on the indigenous
metric system. This artificial capital
intensive growth kept inflation down
for a while, but it could not be main
tained as equipment fell into disrepair
and the debt load grew to the bloated
total of $28 billion.
With the coming to power of first
Babiuch, Kania, and then Gen.
Jaruzelski in the infamous coup of
December 1981, Polish trade took an
about-face. Before 1981 over 50 per
cent of Poland's trade was tied to the
West, 30 percent to the USSR and 20
percent to other partners. Now, more
than 50 percent of Polish goods are
traded with the USSR and the West
captures only 30 percent. -
Debt payments came to a complete
halt in 1981, whereas now Poland is
paying off interests on its guaranteed
loans to other governments. Com
mercial loans will soon be tackled, es
pecially as the decision on Poland's

possible re-entry into the Interna
tional Monetary Fund (IMF) draws
near. According to Witold Lipski, co
chair of the Ministry of Foreign Af
fairs in the Sejm (Polish Diet), this
decision will take place this summer.
A severe economic problem in
Poland, as in many "Third World"
countries, stems from the fact that its
currency, the zloty, is non-convertible
and extremely devalued. While the
official exchange rate is $158 zloty to
the dollar, one dollar can buy $500 to
$600 zloty on the black market.
Demand for dollars is especially high
these days because if the Polish eco
nomy is to survive, the government
must pay off its debt in hard currency.
Now, with the dollar so strong and
American interest rates so high, the
Polish government cannot trade fast
enough to pay off even the skyrocket
ing interest rates on its outstanding
loans.
Recent plans announced by the
government to raise food prices
across the board — for the third time
since it seized power — met with
popular discontent and a call by the
underground Free Trade Union,
Solidarity (TKK), for a 15-minute
general strike on Feb. 28. My visit
happened to fall during this week of
planned protest, but most of the Poles
1 questioned were either not aware of
the plans or of the opinion that
it would be an untimely and fruitless
event.
At any rate, the strike was called
off at the last minute by Lech Walesa
and Zbigniew Bujak, leaders of the
clandestine TKK, on the condition
proposed by Jaruzelski that prices be
raised gradually in phases. In just the
time that it took my crowded train to
creak from East to West, prices of 10
basic food products were hiked by 75

percent in the first "phase."
Solidarity, as well as the official
trade unions, condemned this latest
government move as inflationist and
detrimental to workers' interests. Al
though "blue-collar" workers in
Poland receive, for the most part,
higher salaries than do the intel
ligentsia and "white-collar" cadre,
this unified opposition to the price in
creases stems from the fact that
everyone's standard of living is ulti
mately diminished by the higher costs

of such essential items.
When it comes to economic mat
ters in Poland today, such a uniform
response is exceptional. Although
Solidarity enjoyed the support of
around 10 million Poles at the peak
of its activity in 1980 and 1981, its
popularity has greatly eroded in the
face of internal power sturggles, cor
ruption and differing programs of
reform within the banned trade union
and among its five or six major fac
tions.

Moreover, many Poles recognize
the irony in the fact that Solidarity
and other underground groups such
as NOVA and KOS (the Commitee
of Social Resistance) are now advo
cating economic policies very similar
to the ones that they condemned the
previous government for pursuing.
The original reforms Solidarity pro
posed to counter the capital-intensive
development policies of Gierek's
times, seen as having negative conse
quences for all except those running

the state apparatus, have actually
been implemented by the official
trade unions of the Party.
The continuing economic crisis and
the bankruptcy of attempted alterna
tives has led to a situation where "no
one knows what to do, so they are all
fighting against something and the
struggle has become a purely
ideological and political one,' ob
serves the head of the Polish Interna
tional Student Movement for the
United Nations.
Solidarity's emphasis on economic,
political and cultural ties as a reaction
to the repressive social apparatus of
the current military regime is hardly
greeted as a real and lasting solution
to their country's dilemma by most
Poles. Although Solidarity is lauded
as the symbol of detente and the
champion of human rights by the
Western media and in Western
circles, its popularity within Poland
today is tempered by the period of
martial law that just ended in 1983 as
well as the country's economic part
nership in COMECON and military
participation in the Warsaw Pact. The
proximity of the Soviet Union also
helps to explain a certain Polish
prudence that Monika summed up
when she sighed, "We call the Soviet
Union our brother, not our friend,
because when you are little, you must
live in the same house as your
brother, but you choose your
friends."
The roots of resistance are sewn
deep into the fabric of Polish society.
When the Russian, Prussian and
Austrian giants carved the Polish ter
ritory into three parts in 1795, they
laid the groundwork, ironically, for
the rise of the Catholic Church and its

has become a purely ideological and political one," says the head of the Polish International Student Move
ment for the United Nations.
present-day hold on the Polish
people. Not only did the Church
preserve Polish language, culture and
cohesion through the Catholic school
system and community reunions, but
it fostered a kind of fervent faith that
still pervades Poland today. Ninety
five percent of the population are
practicing Catholics. Each year, mil
lions join in the 300-kilometer, 10-
day pilgrimage from Warsaw to the
shrine of the Holy Mother. Flowers
and candles cover the tomb of Priest
Popieluszko. Recent attacks by the
state against the Church and its

leaders are seen as grave indeed.
What hope do Poles hold today for
their brand of socialism, for a future
of "bread and freedom" as the now
popular song goes? Many take heart
in the continuity of the long Polish
struggle against external domination
and economic oppression. They recall
the Poznam uprising of 1956 against
inequalities rampant in the poorer
cities of the otherwise rich, in
dutrialized "Prussian" part of Poland.
Women take pride in the prominence
of female resisters figuring at the
forefront of Polish history. They cite
the little known fact that it was actu
ally a woman, Anna Walentynowicz,
who inspired the mass movement,
Solidarity. A crane operator at
Gdansk shipyard, she led strikes in

1970 against food price increases and
was arrested in 1980 for laying a
wreath on the graves of those killed in
the 1970 uprising, thus triggering the
formation of Solidarity. The name of
the trade union movement comes
from the call by women workers for
"solidarity strikes" across the country
at the time of her arrest.
The resurgence of the Rapacki
Plan also serves as a symbol of fresh
hope vis a vis Polish possibilities and
the peace movement. This plan was
initiated by the Polish minister for
foreign affairs at the United Nations
in 1956 and calls for the nuclear dis
engagement of Central Europe,
meaning that Poland, Germany and
now Czechoslovakia would be estab
lished as a Nuclear-Free Zone.

Still others are encouraged by the
general amnesty granted to political
prisoners last summer and the local
and parliamentary elections to be
held next October. Many young
people, however, dream of leaving
the country but mention how difficult
it is to obtain the necessary visa and
money. For every 20 Poles who leave
their homeland, only five return. This
enormous rate of emigration indi
cates the deep tears in the social
fabric of Poland.
Alcoholism is a huge problem.

cologne, window-washing liquid or
