## Poland faces economic crisis, internal strife 
### 
Kathleen Moloney is a Stanford stu
dent who recently attended a week
long seminar on "Youth and Dis
armament" in Warsaw. As the
recipient of the U.N. Disarmament
Fellowship awarded by the Mid-
Pen insula Peace Center, she is cur
rently working in Geneva as a foreign
correspondent for disarmament and
international affairs. Her stay in
Poland inspired some of the following
observations and reflections.
By KATHLEEN MALONEY
Warsaw ... the smell of soft coal
burning. A thick haze made the hush
seem natural The metal tread of the
train station, filled with long, thin,
Giacometti-like men, surrendered to
a pace padded with snow. The cold
night air of my arrival brushed stoic
stares onto the faces that passed.
Poland, strangely enough, reminded
me of Ireland.
A people forged 36 million strong
and deep by the heat of centuries of
war. A land wounded with past occu
pations — a tripartite scar imposed by
the 18th century Russian, Prussian
and Austrian empires. A nation-state
squirming for the independence it of
ficially gained in 1918. An orthodox
Catholic faith born of secular foreign
oppression. High emigration rates,
mostly to the United States, with one
million in Chicago alone. But most of
all, a music in the language, a light
ness of eye, an ironic sense of humor
and potatoes at every meal.
Warsaw is a city of contrasts. The
steel tramway squeaks its way from
the austere, functional blocks of
modern apartment buildings to the
warm earth tones of the Old Town.
Dr. Zhivago seems to hide beneath
the sea of fur caps. Lovely peacocks
spread their colors against the ice of
Park Lazienkowski, where a statue
pays tribute to Chopin and his
Polonaise. A flame is kept forever lit
by the guards chapped with cold at

the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier of
World War 11.
Poland suffered the greatest human
and material losses of all the nations
on earth caught in the winds of the
Second World War. For every 1,000
inhabitants, Poland lost 220, the
USSR 112, Holland 22, France 15,
the United Kingdom 8 and the
United States 2.9 in the Allied
struggle against the Nazis. Material
losses totaled $626 for every Polish

citizen, while two-and-a-half million
Poles were sucked into slave labor.
Another two-and-a-half million were
forcibly resettled, and a total of six
million Poles perished, many of them
in concentration camps.
Any mention of these camps,
whether it be Auschwitz/Brzezinka —
where four to five million died — or
Zagan — where the "Great Escape"
took place — or Treblinka, elicits a
sober and reverent response even in

the young people of Poland today.
On the other hand, any reference to
"The Day After," an American TV
film depicting a hypothetical nuclear
holocaust, provokes little reaction at
all. "Polish adults thought this film
was abstract and exotic, for the scenes
portrayed were less gory or horrifying
than what they themselves saw and
experienced during the Second World
War," explains one Polish friend.
Daily reminders of such atrocities

and devastation render fears of a
future war, nuclear or not, un
thinkable to most Poles. The meticu
lous reconstruction of bombed-out
buildings in the Old Town was made
possible by the precision of the
tableaux of an Italian painter, Can
nelletto. This fidelity to historical
detail and accuracy symbolizes the
tenacity of the Polish spirit and their
pride in their cultural heritage.
A statue of the poet Bolestaw Prus

looms large in front of Gen.
Jaruzelski's palace and spurs two
Polish acquaintances to recall
numerous scientific and artistic
achievements of their compatriots.
They lead me past the museum of the
Polish physicist Marie Sklodowska-
Curie, the first woman to win a Nobel
Prize and the first person to ever
receive two. Over a cup of hot honey,
a Polish specialty, they boast of the
works of Wajda, the famous film
director, and of Nobel Prize winner
Crestaw Mitosz, a poet now living in
Berkeley.
Except for an occasional queue for
food, visible traces of the "hardships"
pressing on the Polish economy are
hard to find. There are still shortages
of tobacco, meat, sweets, alcohol and
flour, but there appears to be no real
hunger here. Food coupons are ra
tioned at schools and workplaces so
that basic items are evenly distributed
among the population by need.
My friend Monika elaborates: "Oh
yes, we still feel the effects of the
1981-82 U.S. and Western economic
boycotts, because we couldn't feed
our chickens for a while — you see,
we import our grain from the U.S. —
or run our butter-making machines,
but now we get along." She adds,
"The nuisance is mostly for the
women, who must stand in lines for
the food and then go home and do all
the rest of the family's chores too
after a long day's work."
Unemployment officially does not
exist today in Poland, but as one stu
dent wryly points out, "Everyone can
find a job, but not necessarily the one
they want." The big economic
picture, however, looks dismal. Much
like the so-called "developing" na
tions, Poland exports primarily raw
materials, such as copper, sulfur, zinc
