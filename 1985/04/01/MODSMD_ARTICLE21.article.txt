## The 						Stanford Daily A 						time for action 
### 
Even in relaxing vacation spots around the
country and in Mexico, the brutal and violent
reality of apartheid in South Africa last week
would have been hard to ignore. The fierce
rioting between blacks and the country's military
and police has resulted in the deaths of at least 80
blacks in the last month. The televised beatings
were, at the very least, grim reminders of the
Vietnam War.
Despite these cruel reminders, President
Reagan seems nearly oblivious to what is going in
both South Africa and this country. During a
recent news conference, Reagan showed a feeble
understanding of the situation and said he would
maintain a policy of quiet diplomacy that runs
contrary to what many Americans want.
Reagan tried to downplay the violence by ex
plaining that some members of the South African
military are black. But worse than Reagan's ef
fort to confuse the issue is his effort to continue
an ineffectual policy.
On this campus, as well as others, the disgust
for the actions of the South African government

has burgeoned into calls for divestment from cor
porations that sell to that country.
On Wednesday, the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee approved a bill introduced by Charles
Mathias (R-Md.) that would put more pressure
on the president to take harsher action. The bill
states that if the president determines that signifi
cant improvements in South African are not
made by March 1, 1986, he should do one or
more of the following:
• Ban commercial investment in South Africa.
• Ban bank loans to the South African govern
ment.
• Ban imports of gold Krugerrands from South
Africa.
• Ban sales of computers to the South African
government.
The president could easily sidestep the bill,
but he cannot avoid the demands of the Ameri
can public. The violence in South Africa must
end, and the Reagan administration must realize
that a stronger policy is both necessary and ex
pected.
