# Why do we pay so much to go here?

### 
I asked myself why. That's all I needed to do. And off I
went in search of an answer. I filled my backpack with an
assortment of health foods, including apples, diet Pop
Tarts, diet candy bars and Diet Coke and departed from
my dorm to find the answer.
Before I go further into my story, I should tell you the
question I was seeking to answer. "Why," I asked myself,
"am I paying so much money to go to school at Stanford?"
That was my question, and I won't bore you with the
numerous answers that filled my head before I realized
that I would need outside help to find satisfaction.
Leaving my dorm, I headed for the hill. I knew that the
answer to my question was to be found on that hill; I had
been there before. Indeed I had been there several times
before, and each time I had visited the Master on the hill I
had been rewarded with the truth.
I first met the Master one afternoon as I jogged by the
Dish Temple. I was trotting along at a five-minute-mile
pace along the dirt path near the top of the hill when I
noticed a funny-looking cow standing under a tree. I
wiped the sweat from my eyes and saw that the cow was
actually a man. He was sitting with his legs crossed and his
hands resting on his knees. I ran over to him.
He filled me in on the meaning of life and then sent me
back down the hill as the sun was setting.

I had hours before the sun would set on me today. As I
walked across campus, I couldn't help asking myself how
all these people could pay so much money to be here. And
where did all the money go? Crews that clean up the poli
tical flyers outside the post office? Yellow construction
tape? The Coffee House? It obviously didn't go to the

Athletic Department or to the Music Department, where
one has to plunk out extra fees to take many of the classes.
The more I thought, the more confused I became, and I
quickened my step to sooner reach the hill. And before
long I was there.
"Stephen," he said without moving, "it has been long."
"Yes, Master, it has indeed."
"Sit," he directed, "and tell me why this question of
money is plaguing you."

"It's hard to give up so much money," I said. "I have
trouble justifying to myself spending a large amount of
money, much of which isn't even mine, for three or four
classes."
"Money," he sighed. "So important. Let me take you
on a voyage, Steve. Imagine you were a dollar bill, and we
lived in a world where there was no computer trans
ference of money. One day in Maples Pavilion you would
be torn from the warmth of a leather wallet and slapped
onto a counter where a strange hand would grab you and
stuff you into a stack of hopeless bills. You would talk to
other bills and be comforted by the fact that they, too,
were frightened. Where were you bound? Days pass.
"Suddenly, light. You're stuffed into a bag and thrown
around for what seems hours — you lose your sense of
time. Then, a hand wrests you from your companions and
plops you down on a table. Another hand immediately
grabs you and stuffs you into a cold, stiff wallet.
"You overhear that the wallet belongs to Sadie Hist, a
Freshman English professor. Within minutes you're again
pulled from your companions and placed on yet another
counter. You hear the hum of a cash register and the
muffled cries of dozens of bills pinned mercilessly beneath
a spring-loaded bar. Your Washington head spins and just
before you pass out you see what you were being traded

for: a half-dozen red pens.
"When you wake, you can see nothing. You call out.
Another bill, sounding like a hundred, quickly tells you to
be quiet, for you are in a bank. And there you remain.
"Finally, many years later, you are again placed in a bag
and whisked away. From within the bag you could read
writing on a sticker stuck to the sack — 'IBM.' And then
it happened. A hand took you from the bag and dangled
you in the air where another hand hugged you. That hand,
you knew that hand. You were placed into a wallet....
No, not a wallet: your old, warm, leather wallet. You were
home."
I looked at the Master for several seconds to make sure
he was finished. He was.
"I understand," I told him. "I'm not wasting or need
lessly spending my money — I am investing it in my
future."
"No, you don't understand at all," he said. "The impor
tance lies not in the intelligence of your investment. What
is important to see is the role of money in your life. A bill
is moved. You are a mover."
He turned toward the remaining sun and I knew it was
time to leave. And I smiled as I descended the hill, for I
knew why.
