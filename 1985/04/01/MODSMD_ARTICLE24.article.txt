## University should retaliate for budget cuts 
### 
It is time to re-evaluate the Reagan library.
When Stanford accepted the library, ad
ministration policies were causing belt
tightening in higher education. But the
country was deep in a recession, and belts
were being tightened in all government pro-

grams. Since then, the economy has
recovered, but the Reagan administration has
not restored the education funding it cut. In
stead, it has chosen to make an unprece
dented new attack on aid to higher education.
This attack is specifically and deliberately
meant to harm institutions like Stanford even
more than most universities. Stanford has a
unique opportunity to strike a blow for educa
tion in this country. Stanford should withdraw
its approval for the Reagan library here until
the Reagan administration withdraws its edu
cation budget cuts.
Make no mistake, the budget cuts are enor
mous. Almost one million students will lose
their GSLs, 100,000 will lose NDSLs. Two
hundred thousand work study jobs and
400,000 SEOG grants will go. A million Pell
grants will be affected. All in all, 25 percent of
the federal aid to education will be cut.
The effect on Stanford will be even worse.

The eligibility criteria and loan ceilings are
designed to hurt institutions like Stanford.
The University as a whole has not released
final figures, but several graduate and profes
sional schools will lose almost half their
federal funding. The figure for the whole Uni
versity will be similar.
At the same time, tax law changes will
choke off at least 20 percent of the Univer
sity's annual alumni giving. Stanford will face
a catastrophic financial emergency; other uni
versities will go bankrupt. Many people who
now go to college will not be able to continue.
Ronald Reagan, like his know-nothing
wing of the Republican party, has always
disliked the nation's best universities. Such
schools are not ideologically pure enough for
the radical right. Reagn was elected governor
of California largely by running against UC-
Berkeley, them probably the best university
in the country.
Reagan failed in his attempt to make UC-
Santa Cruz the state's "academic" state uni
versity instead of Berkeley, but he did do un
told damage to Berkeley. Even today, while
Berkeley still has many outstanding graduate
programs, much of the university, especially
at the undergrad level, has never quite
recovered from the Reagan governorship.
Reagan opposes liberal arts schools. His

son went to one a solid Republican youth
leader and came out a ballet dancer. Reagan's
model for education is the Cal State system.

Students commute and learn a trade. But the
students live at home, surrounded by subur
ban Republican family values.

Only a few exceptional students ever ques
tion their basic assumptions and values in the
way one is almost forced to at a liberal arts
school like Stanford. Reagan wants to
produce people like himself and his friends:
Republican businessmen and professionals
who have little contact with the dangerous
world of ideas.
The disproportionate impact of the Reagan
cuts on private liberal arts schools is no acci
dent. When Education Secretary William
Bennett was asked about this on the MacNeil-
Lehrer Report, his suggestion for the schools
was cruelly appropriate for this administra
tion: deficit spending. Spend the endow
ments. Universities should mortgage their
futures just as the administration is mortgag
ing the country's future.
Education is important. America has the
best higher education in the world, and it is
our margin for competition in the world eco
nomy. The Stanford-Silicon Valley connec
tion demonstrates the importance of quality
education for economic growth.
Allowing access to education on the basis of
merit regardless of ability to pay creates social
mobility. It is simply a waste of educational
resources for the best universities to become
the exclusive province of the rich. And it is ec
nomic suicide to cut our education spending

while Japan and Germany raise theirs.
Stanford's mission is education. Any blow
Stanford can strike against the Reagan educa
tion budget raises Stanford's national stature.
A dramatic act by Stanford will galvanize na
tional opinion against the education cuts. It
will also jolt the members of the Reagan ad
ministration; perhaps they will realize the
folly of their ways.
There could be no more dramatic act than
to withdraw approval of the Reagan library
until the administration withdraws the educa
tion cuts. Stanford has no duty to memorialize
the most anti-education president of this cen
tury, especially when his program specifically
targets institutions like Stanford. Any educa
tional value of the library is surely outweighed
by the harm of the budget cuts to education.
Duke earned the respect of the academic
community and the nation when it stood up
for its principles and rejected the Nixon li
brary. Oxford got world attention when it
denied Margaret Thatcher a traditional honor
in protest of budget cuts less dramatic than
Reagan's. Unless Stanford is similarly willing
to stand up for its principles, it will never
achieve the stature of the Ivy League univer
sities it so eagerly emulates.

the federal aid to education will be cut.
The effect on Stanford will be even worse.

The eligibility criteria and loan ceilings are
designed to hurt institutions like Stanford.
The University as a whole has not released
final figures, but several graduate and profes
sional schools will lose almost half their
federal funding. The figure for the whole Uni
versity will be similar.
At the same time, tax law changes will
choke off at least 20 percent of the Univer
sity's annual alumni giving. Stanford will face
a catastrophic financial emergency; other uni
versities will go bankrupt. Many people who
now go to college will not be able to continue.
Ronald Reagan, like his know-nothing
wing of the Republican party, has always
disliked the nation's best universities. Such
schools are not ideologically pure enough for
the radical right. Reagn was elected governor
of California largely by running against UC-
Berkeley, them probably the best university
in the country.
Reagan failed in his attempt to make UC-
Santa Cruz the state's "academic" state uni
versity instead of Berkeley, but he did do un
told damage to Berkeley. Even today, while
Berkeley still has many outstanding graduate
programs, much of the university, especially
at the undergrad level, has never quite
recovered from the Reagan governorship.
Reagan opposes liberal arts schools. His

son went to one a solid Republican youth
leader and came out a ballet dancer. Reagan's
model for education is the Cal State system.

Students commute and learn a trade. But the
students live at home, surrounded by subur
ban Republican family values.

Only a few exceptional students ever ques
tion their basic assumptions and values in the
way one is almost forced to at a liberal arts
school like Stanford. Reagan wants to
produce people like himself and his friends:
Republican businessmen and professionals
who have little contact with the dangerous
world of ideas.
The disproportionate impact of the Reagan
cuts on private liberal arts schools is no acci
dent. When Education Secretary William
Bennett was asked about this on the MacNeil-
Lehrer Report, his suggestion for the schools
was cruelly appropriate for this administra
tion: deficit spending. Spend the endow
ments. Universities should mortgage their
futures just as the administration is mortgag
ing the country's future.
Education is important. America has the
best higher education in the world, and it is
our margin for competition in the world eco
nomy. The Stanford-Silicon Valley connec
tion demonstrates the importance of quality
education for economic growth.
Allowing access to education on the basis of
merit regardless of ability to pay creates social
mobility. It is simply a waste of educational
resources for the best universities to become
the exclusive province of the rich. And it is ec
nomic suicide to cut our education spending

while Japan and Germany raise theirs.
Stanford's mission is education. Any blow
Stanford can strike against the Reagan educa
tion budget raises Stanford's national stature.
A dramatic act by Stanford will galvanize na
tional opinion against the education cuts. It
will also jolt the members of the Reagan ad
ministration; perhaps they will realize the
folly of their ways.
There could be no more dramatic act than
to withdraw approval of the Reagan library
until the administration withdraws the educa
tion cuts. Stanford has no duty to memorialize
the most anti-education president of this cen
tury, especially when his program specifically
targets institutions like Stanford. Any educa
tional value of the library is surely outweighed
by the harm of the budget cuts to education.
Duke earned the respect of the academic
community and the nation when it stood up
for its principles and rejected the Nixon li
brary. Oxford got world attention when it
denied Margaret Thatcher a traditional honor
in protest of budget cuts less dramatic than
Reagan's. Unless Stanford is similarly willing
to stand up for its principles, it will never
achieve the stature of the Ivy League univer
sities it so eagerly emulates.
