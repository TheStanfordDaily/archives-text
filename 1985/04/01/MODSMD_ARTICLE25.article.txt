Safety policy
The following is the text of a letter
sent to Jonathan Livingston of Menlo
Park.)
Dear Mr. Livingston:
University President Donald Ken
nedy has asked that 1 respond to
your letter to him dated Feb. 22, in
which you express a serious concern
about the safety hazards resulting
from campus construction projects.
First. I would like to express my
regret about your accident and em
phasize that I and all senior members
of the administration share your
concern about construction safety.
The level of construction activity on
campus is at an all-time high. In
addition, many of these projects —
such as the underground communi
cations conduit project — are the
type of projects which impact a large
area of the campus, including most
of the major circulation routes used
by the campus community. This, of
course, significantly increases the
overall risk of accidents and puts a
much greater burden on all of us
associated with the construction
process to assure that all reasonable
measures are taken to reduce the
risk of accidents to a minimum.
While you may feel that not
enough is being done, let me assure
you that construction safety has a
very high priority at Stanford and
significant measures are being taken
to rcduce the risk of accidents. A few
of the measures we are taking are

summarized below:
• University staff has been working
with the contractor on the conduit
project on a daily basis to improve
his safety performance. There has
been a marked improvement in the
areas you cited in your letter among
others. We still do not feel that his
performance is at the desired level,
however, and the scope of work in
his contract has been reduced as a
result.
• On a regular basis, information on
the location and scope of campus
construction projects has been pub
lished in Campus Report, including
phone numbers of people to contact
in case unsafe situations are ob
served. Reports of unsafe conditions
are followed up immediately.
• We are making safety a key part of
the selection process for contractors
being considered for work on
campus.
• We are preparing an orientation
package for all contractors which will
describe the unique aspects of per
forming construction on the campus.
• We are preparing a new, more
comprehensive University policy on
construction safety which will em
phasize that the University is com
mitted to provide a safe environment
for all members of the Stanford
community and will provide addi
tional guidance to staff who have the
responsibility for implementing this
policy.
Again, let me say that we take the
concerns expressed in your letter

very seriously and believe that the
efforts currently underway will result
in a much safer environment for all
of us.

Nicaragua struggle
The struggle in Nicaragua for
freedom from foreign intervention
still looms in the hearts of many. For
42 years, while the people of
Nicaragua were living under a brutal
military dictatorship, they were
stripped of the right to live their lives
freely.
And now it is a deeply divided
faction, referred to as "freedom
fighters" in a Daily opinion by Ken
neth Fenyo (The Daily, March 4),
that threatens to unleash a wave of
violence that could cripple the
Nicaraguan people.
Almost from the beginning Fenyo
cites the Sandinista views as
"tyrannical," but he fails to cite
specific instances where such views
have been implemented. Does a
government that received recogni
tion by the United Nations in 1983
for having almost no human rights
violations seem tyrannical? Is the
government stealing from the people
when it focuses on decreasing il
literacy in the country from 50 per
cent to 10 percent in four years?
Just three weeks ago the Stanford
Medical School showed a film on the

medical advances made by
Nicaragua. The results were as
tonishing for a Third World country.
Let's focus now on the political
arena. President Reagan's rhetoric
on Nicaragua demonstrates his un
willingness to seek a peaceful settle
ment. How can the United States sit
down and talk when its leader
refuses to do so?
Fenyo prioritizes the situation in
Nicaragua by saying that America's
security is probably the most impor
tant factor to consider. What about
the needs of the people engaged in a
senseless war?
Apparently innocent people, who
live far from our borders, must pay a
steep price to ensure American
security. It is very easy to hire mer
cenaries to take care of the dirty
work. In return, U.S. interests are
left intact. Violence, then, seems to
justify U.S. security in Central
America.
I realize the Sandinista govern
ment must deal with many domestic
conflicts. But the government will
never be able to solve its domestic
problems when the threat of an
invasion is imminent.
The Sandinista government must
be given time to mature and to learn
from its mistakes. Obviously five
years of government rule is too much
for the Reagan administration. Yet
our government is 200 years old and
is still learning from its mistakes.
