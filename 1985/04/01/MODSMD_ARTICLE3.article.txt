# Mexico campus gets OK
## 
### MARK WILSON Editorial staff 
The Stanford Board of Trustees
voted Friday to accept an offer from
the government of Mexico to lease a
restored Spanish mission for use in
the Overseas Studies program.
The site, Mission San Sergio Zawa,
is located on Baja California, 50
miles north of the capital city of La
Paz. The main building and grounds
were abandoned in the early decades
of this century and have been used
since 1965 as a minimum-security
federal detention center.
Negotiations on the 12-year lease,
set to begin in January 1986, have in
volved representatives from Stanford,
the State Department and the
Mexican government.
The plans to create a campus in
Mexico began in June 1979, three
months after Arlen Lipley, a senior in
chemical engineering, was arrested in
La Paz for possession of narcotics.
Lawrence Lipley, professor of physics
and a member of the Board of Trus
tees, made initial contact with the
Mexican authorities in hopes of
working out a reasonable exchange
for his son.
"Arlen was traveling at the time
with two friends from Berkeley, both
of whom were also detained," the
elder Lipley told I he Daily.
By January 19N0. four more stu
dents, two from Stanford, had joined
the group at the mission.
"By then I had formulated my idea
and had submitted it to the Commit
tee on Overseas Studies, the presi
dent and the Board of Trustees,"
Lipley said.
By January of this year, the num
ber of students had increased to the
point where it was no longer
economical to maintain the facility.
"The students are tearing the place to
hell," a government official told
Lipley.
After Friday's meeting of the
board. University President Donald
Kennedv stated, "We knew we were
close. We were hopeful that this week
would put us over the top. Ihe
Mexican authorities offered the lease
on Wednesday morning after the ar
rest on Monday of two Stanford stu
dents for speeding.
Contacted Friday. Arlen Lipley
was philosophical about his ordeal,
calling it a "real learning experi
ence."
Asked about his plans lor the
future, he replied, "I'm changing my
major to linguistics, and might return
here in the fall."
