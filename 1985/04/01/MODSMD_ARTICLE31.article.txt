## Card takes two at UA to widen lead 
### JOHN LIS Editorial staff 
TUCSON, Ariz. — It may too early in the season
to be thinking about pennant fever for the Stanford
baseball team, but the Cardinal took a couple of
steps closer to that goal a week ago. The Stanford
nine swept a double-header from Arizona here
March 23, 20-5 and 10-6, but dropped the finale
the next day, 13-8.
"I like to win two of three," Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess said after the loss. "I'd like to win
the third, but we didn't."
The weekend had given the Cardinal a two-and
one-half-game lead over California, but the Bears
defeated USC 4-3 yesterday to complete a three
game sweep of the slumping Trojans and cut Stan
ford's lead to a single game. The Cardinal, which
was idle this weekend, is 10-2 in the Pacific 10
Conference Southern Division, while Cal is 9-3.
Stanford and Cal square off in a three-game se
ries this weekend. Saturday's game is at Sunken
Diamond, while Friday's and Sunday's games are in
Berkeley.
The games in Arizona marked the full-fledged
coming out of the Stanford hitting attack. The
Cardinal bats pounded out 43 runs and 43 hits in
the three games.
If the weekend was a coming out, the opener was
the debutante ball.
After falling behind 1-0 in the second inning, the
Cardinal scored three runs in the third when second
baseman Pete Stanicek dribbled a roller down the
third-base line that refused to go foul and allowed
catcher John Ramos to score from third, and Mike
Deßenon and Walt Harris drew bases-loaded
walks from Wildcat starter Joe Magrane.
Stanford followed with five in the fourth. With
the bases loaded, center fielder Mark Davis hit a
ground ball that Arizona shortstop Tommy Hinzo
booted. Center fielder Charles Johnson then
misplayed the same ball, and, when the fun was
over, three runs had scored and Davis was standing

at third.
First baseman Rick Lundblade doubled home
Davis, and Deßenon scored Lundblade with a
single to right.
The Wildcats scored two more in the fourth off
Cardinal starter Jeff Ballard, but three runs in the
Stanford fifth put the game out of reach. Davis
tripled home two runs and scored on a sacrifice fly
to center by Lundblade.
Stanford scored two more in the seventh and
then put the finishing touches on this one with a
seven-run ninth.
Ballard scattered 14 hits ingoing the distance for
the win, striking out seven.
Stanicek led the offensive onslaught, going 5-for
-6 on the afternoon. Lundblade was 4-for-5, and
shortstop John Verducci went 3-for-5. Lundblade
had four RBIs, and Stanicek, Davis, Deßenon and
Harris each drove in three runs.
The nightcap was a little different story. Call it
the John Ramos Story. The Cardinal catcher killed
the Wildcats' hopes with two powerful swings of
the bat.
In the second inning, Ramos followed walks to
Harris and Toi Cook with a blast over the trees be
hind the left-field fence, giving Stanford a 3-0 lead.
In the eighth, with the Cardinal trailing 6-4, Ramos
took Wildcat starter Mike Young over the 400-foot
sign in center with Harris and Fred Laningham
aboard. That shot put Stanford ahead 7-6.
Ramos said that his first round-tripper came off a
high curveball. The second was "a curve, down low.
It was a pretty good pitch. I hit it well, but I wasn't
sure it was out."
He wasn't the only one not sure. Johnson, the
Arizona center fielder, took off after the ball and
didn't stop until he ran out of ballpark and ran into
the fence. He was shaken up and had to leave the
game.
"1 know I'm capable of hitting home runs,"
Ramos continued. "I'm happy I hit them. I wasn't
trying to hit them, I just hit them. It didn't surprise

me, hut I didn't expect it."
"He could hit more," Marquess said. "His swing
hasn't been what it can be. He's starting to swing
the bat like he can."
The Cardinal got three more in the ninth.
Lundblade launched a two-run double to right
center that scored Stanicek, and Mark Machtolf ran
through third-base coach Dean Stotz's stop sign,
ran over Arizona catcher Steve Strong, and scored
to make it 9-6.
"1 had a lot of momentum," Machtolf said, "and
I was thinking to score. He (Stotz) said to stop, but
1 didn't want to get hung up between third and
home. 1 figured there'd be a collision." Machtolf is
also a linebacker on the Cardinal football team.
That was followed by Ballard, pinch-hitting for
Laningham, doubling Lundblade home.
In the meantime, Stanford starter Rob Was
senaar had his problems with the Wildcats. He gave
up five runs in the fourth inning and was lifted in
favor of reliever Lee Plemel.
After a shaky beginning, Plemel settled down
and shut out the Wildcats through five innings in
picking up the victory.
"He hasn't been real sharp," Marquess said of
Wassenaar. "You go through stages like that. The
other guys pick you up. Plemel pitched well out of
the bullpen.
"He's a freshman. We knew he's a good pitcher,
but we didn't expect this. To shut those guys down
for five innings, that's a pretty good job."
The party was over on Sunday, though. Arizona
sent 15 hitters to the plate in a 10-run third inning
that chased starter Jack McDowell and reliever
Kevin Kunkel and coasted to the 13-8 victory.
Stanford made six errors in that loss, three of
them by third baseman Ruben Amaro. McDowell
walked six and hit one batter in two innings of
work, and Kunkel surrendered three runs without
retiring a batter.

Catcher John Ramos hit a pair of three-run homers to power Stanford
to a 10-6 victory in the nightcap of last Saturday's double-header at
Arizona.
Rick Dietz got the Cardinal out of
the third, and after that nightmare
gave up two runs and six hits the rest
of the way.
It was the second series in a row the
Cardinal won two of three. The

weekend before finals, Stanford
dropped a Friday game to USC
before rebounding to win the next
two.
In non-conference play, the Card
inal was rained out last week against
UC-Santa Barbara and Sonoma
State. Stanford did get in one game
against Santa Barbara, but it was
called after six innings and went into

the books as a 4-2 win for the
Gauchos.
Stanford had scored three in the
top of seventh to take a 5-4 lead, but
then the rain came. The game was
called after a 45-minute delay,
reverted back to the sixth, and
became Stanford's seventh loss
against 22 victories.

He wasn't the only one not sure. Johnson, the
Arizona center fielder, took off after the ball and
didn't stop until he ran out of ballpark and ran into
the fence. He was shaken up and had to leave the
game.
"1 know I'm capable of hitting home runs,"
Ramos continued. "I'm happy I hit them. I wasn't
trying to hit them, I just hit them. It didn't surprise

me, hut I didn't expect it."
"He could hit more," Marquess said. "His swing
hasn't been what it can be. He's starting to swing
the bat like he can."
The Cardinal got three more in the ninth.
Lundblade launched a two-run double to right
center that scored Stanicek, and Mark Machtolf ran
through third-base coach Dean Stotz's stop sign,
ran over Arizona catcher Steve Strong, and scored
to make it 9-6.
"1 had a lot of momentum," Machtolf said, "and
I was thinking to score. He (Stotz) said to stop, but
1 didn't want to get hung up between third and
home. 1 figured there'd be a collision." Machtolf is
also a linebacker on the Cardinal football team.
That was followed by Ballard, pinch-hitting for
Laningham, doubling Lundblade home.
In the meantime, Stanford starter Rob Was
senaar had his problems with the Wildcats. He gave
up five runs in the fourth inning and was lifted in
favor of reliever Lee Plemel.
After a shaky beginning, Plemel settled down
and shut out the Wildcats through five innings in
picking up the victory.
"He hasn't been real sharp," Marquess said of
Wassenaar. "You go through stages like that. The
other guys pick you up. Plemel pitched well out of
the bullpen.
"He's a freshman. We knew he's a good pitcher,
but we didn't expect this. To shut those guys down
for five innings, that's a pretty good job."
The party was over on Sunday, though. Arizona
sent 15 hitters to the plate in a 10-run third inning
that chased starter Jack McDowell and reliever
Kevin Kunkel and coasted to the 13-8 victory.
Stanford made six errors in that loss, three of
them by third baseman Ruben Amaro. McDowell
walked six and hit one batter in two innings of
work, and Kunkel surrendered three runs without
retiring a batter.

Catcher John Ramos hit a pair of three-run homers to power Stanford
to a 10-6 victory in the nightcap of last Saturday's double-header at
Arizona.
Rick Dietz got the Cardinal out of
the third, and after that nightmare
gave up two runs and six hits the rest
of the way.
It was the second series in a row the
Cardinal won two of three. The

weekend before finals, Stanford
dropped a Friday game to USC
before rebounding to win the next
two.
In non-conference play, the Card
inal was rained out last week against
UC-Santa Barbara and Sonoma
State. Stanford did get in one game
against Santa Barbara, but it was
called after six innings and went into

the books as a 4-2 win for the
Gauchos.
Stanford had scored three in the
top of seventh to take a 5-4 lead, but
then the rain came. The game was
called after a 45-minute delay,
reverted back to the sixth, and
became Stanford's seventh loss
against 22 victories.
TUCSON, Ariz. — It may too early in the season
to be thinking about pennant fever for the Stanford
baseball team, but the Cardinal took a couple of
steps closer to that goal a week ago. The Stanford
nine swept a double-header from Arizona here
March 23, 20-5 and 10-6, but dropped the finale
the next day, 13-8.
"I like to win two of three," Stanford Coach
Mark Marquess said after the loss. "I'd like to win
the third, but we didn't."
The weekend had given the Cardinal a two-and
one-half-game lead over California, but the Bears
defeated USC 4-3 yesterday to complete a three
game sweep of the slumping Trojans and cut Stan
ford's lead to a single game. The Cardinal, which
was idle this weekend, is 10-2 in the Pacific 10
Conference Southern Division, while Cal is 9-3.
Stanford and Cal square off in a three-game se
ries this weekend. Saturday's game is at Sunken
Diamond, while Friday's and Sunday's games are in
Berkeley.
The games in Arizona marked the full-fledged
coming out of the Stanford hitting attack. The
Cardinal bats pounded out 43 runs and 43 hits in
the three games.
If the weekend was a coming out, the opener was
the debutante ball.
After falling behind 1-0 in the second inning, the
Cardinal scored three runs in the third when second
baseman Pete Stanicek dribbled a roller down the
third-base line that refused to go foul and allowed
catcher John Ramos to score from third, and Mike
Deßenon and Walt Harris drew bases-loaded
walks from Wildcat starter Joe Magrane.
Stanford followed with five in the fourth. With
the bases loaded, center fielder Mark Davis hit a
ground ball that Arizona shortstop Tommy Hinzo
booted. Center fielder Charles Johnson then
misplayed the same ball, and, when the fun was
over, three runs had scored and Davis was standing

at third.
First baseman Rick Lundblade doubled home
Davis, and Deßenon scored Lundblade with a
single to right.
The Wildcats scored two more in the fourth off
Cardinal starter Jeff Ballard, but three runs in the
Stanford fifth put the game out of reach. Davis
tripled home two runs and scored on a sacrifice fly
to center by Lundblade.
Stanford scored two more in the seventh and
then put the finishing touches on this one with a
seven-run ninth.
Ballard scattered 14 hits ingoing the distance for
the win, striking out seven.
Stanicek led the offensive onslaught, going 5-for
-6 on the afternoon. Lundblade was 4-for-5, and
shortstop John Verducci went 3-for-5. Lundblade
had four RBIs, and Stanicek, Davis, Deßenon and
Harris each drove in three runs.
The nightcap was a little different story. Call it
the John Ramos Story. The Cardinal catcher killed
the Wildcats' hopes with two powerful swings of
the bat.
In the second inning, Ramos followed walks to
Harris and Toi Cook with a blast over the trees be
hind the left-field fence, giving Stanford a 3-0 lead.
In the eighth, with the Cardinal trailing 6-4, Ramos
took Wildcat starter Mike Young over the 400-foot
sign in center with Harris and Fred Laningham
aboard. That shot put Stanford ahead 7-6.
Ramos said that his first round-tripper came off a
high curveball. The second was "a curve, down low.
It was a pretty good pitch. I hit it well, but I wasn't
sure it was out."
He wasn't the only one not sure. Johnson, the
Arizona center fielder, took off after the ball and
didn't stop until he ran out of ballpark and ran into
the fence. He was shaken up and had to leave the
game.

Ramos continued. "I'm happy I hit them. I wasn't
