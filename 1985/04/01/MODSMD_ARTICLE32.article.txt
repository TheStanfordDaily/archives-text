### INGRID SEYER Staff sportswriter 
TUSCALOOSA, Ala. â€” The Stanford women's
swimming team may not have won any champion
ships or titles at the NCAA Championships here
March 21-23, but it did win a lot more, as Stanford
Coach George Haines will testify.
"All of our swimmers swam as well as they could
and they won their events in their own ways,"
Haines said. "Heading into the meet I didn't feel
like we would place higher than fourth or fifth, so
our third-place finish was a victory in itself."
Stanford finished third with 340 points behind
Texas (643 points) and Florida (400).
Stanford was followed by California with 283
points, Southern Illinois with 281, USC with 229
and Alabama with 170.
From the very start of the championships, it was
the Longhorns all the way, as Texas, en route to its
second consecutive national title, set an NCAA
record for total number of points scored. Texas
racked up 10 of the 20 championship titles, includ
ing seven individual titles and three relay titles.
During the three days of competition, Stanford
had three second-place finishes, three third-place
finishes, three fourth-place finishes and two fifth
place finishes.
Overall, Stanford placed swimmers in the top 16
places 20 times during the meet.
The Cardinal's top placers included senior
Marybeth Linzmeier, junior Kathy Smith and
freshmen Jennifer Pokluda and Stacy Shupe.
Linzmeier, last year's NCAA champion in the
200-, 500-, and 1,650-yard freestyles, once again
was a strong force for the Cardinal. Linzmeier
finished fourth in the 200 (1:47.02), fifth in the 500
(4:45.52), sixth in the 1,650 (16:22.91) and ninth
in the 100, with a lifetime best of 50.58.
"In a way. this year's NCA As are a little difficult
for me since this is my last year of swimming for
Stanford. Overall, though, 1 am fairly happy with
my own swimming, " Linzmeier said. "I think this
is a sort of in-between year for the team, in general,
especially since we are missing some key individ
uals, but our team is doing well here with what we
have."
Smith placed second in the 200 breaststroke with
a time of 2:15.81. Smith entered the championship
final with the top qualifying time (2:16.47), but fell
to Texas' Kim Rhodenbaugh (2:14.92).
Smith also entered the 100 breaststroke with the
top qualifying time (1:03.11), but placed third in
the final behind Texas' Tracey McFarlance
(1:02.50) and Rhodenbaugh (1:02.70).
Pokluda claimed one of Stanford's second-place
finishes as she followed Texas' Debbie Risen
(55.44) to the finish in the 100 backstroke in a time
of 56.23.
Pokluda also placed in the 200 backstroke, win
ning the consolation final with a time of 2:01.91 to
claim ninth place. Pokluda's time would have
placed her sixth in the championship final.
"I have always known that Jennifer had extreme

talent, but I didn't expect it to start showing so
much so quickly," Haines said. "She has started to
blossom into a fabulous swimmer and she has really
only just begun."
Shupe is another Cardinal swimmer who is just
beginning her college swimming career, but her
performance in the championships belied her lack
of NCAA experience.
Shupe paced herself to a second-place finish in
the 1,650 freestyle with a time of 16:11.08, follow
ing Texas freshman Tiffany Cohen to the finish
(15:53.85).
"I am very happy with my time and my place.
Finishing behind a swimmer like Tiffany Cohen is
quite an honor," Shupe said. "To finish so high in
my first NCAA meet is pretty exciting, as is just
being here and competing for Stanford."
Shupe finished fourth (4:44.87) in the 500
freestyle, an event that Cohen also won.
Cohen's time in the 1.650 broke Linzmeier's
NCAA record of 16:02.34, set in 1982. Cohen cur
rently holds the U.S. Open and American records
(15:46.54) in that event.
"I took the race out like I wanted to, swam it like
I wanted to, and won it like I wanted to," Cohen
said. "I knew I had to come out fast and swim hard,
but once I got going, the rest of the race just
seemed to come for me."

Cohen, a gold medalist in the 400- and 800-
meter freestyles in the 1 984 Olympics, was one of
seven Texas swimmers to figure in at least two
championships events.
Rhodenbaugh, the winner of the 200
breaststroke, also won the 200 individual medley
(2:01.93) and swam legs on the Longhorns' vic
torious 200 and 400 medley relays.
Risen, winner of the 100 backstroke, also swam
legs on the 200 medley and 200 freestyle relays for
Texas.
Risen finished second (1:59.35) in the 200 back
stroke behind teammate Tori Trees (1:59.11), who
also swam on the 400 medley relays.
Three Longhorn swimmers, Jodi Eyles, Kirsten
Wengler and Ann Drolson, swam legs on two of
Texas' three victorious relays.
Although Texas won half of the 20 championship
events, several teams had swimmers win titles in in
dividual and relay events.
Florida, second in the championships, won both
the 400 and 800 freestyle relays and claimed two
individual titles.
Mary Wayte, a sophomore at Florida and a gold
medalist in the 200-meter freestyle last summer,
won titles in the the 400 IM (4:13.27) and the 100
