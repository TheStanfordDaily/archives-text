# McCrea out as women's coach
## 
### JOHN LIS Editorial staff 
Dotty McCrea has resigned her
position as head coach of the Stan
ford women's basketball team
after nine years as the Cardinal
mentor.
Athletic Director Andy Geiger
said that McCrea resigned under
pressure and her contract would
not have been renewed. "They're
annual appointments, but she did
submit a letter of resignation. We
obviously discussed this," he said.
McCrea was not home yester
day and could not be reached for
comment.
In addition to McCrea, Asst.
Coaches Mike Kehoe and Eileen
Roche will not return next season.
Kehoe said that Geiger has yet
to talk to Roche and him about the
circumstances surrounding the
move. "Regardless of the nature
of the profession, I don't feel it
was handled well.
"No one has talked to me di
rectly."
Geiger, who is in Lexington,
Ky., for the finals of the NCAA
men's basketball tournament, said
he will talk to both assistant
coaches when he returns to Stan
ford.
"It's the nature of the profes
sion where if the head coach goes,
the assistants go with them,"
Kehoe said. "I understand clean
ing house, but there's still some
measure of respect â€” dignity, per
haps."
Earlier, players had privately
expressed dissatisfaction over
McCrea as a coach. Often, players
who are not seeing as much court
time as they feel they deserve will
complain about a coach, but
several of those who logged a good
deal of playing time had privately
complained about McCrea as well.
No one would discuss the effect
this had on McCrea's firing.
Geiger responded by saying, "I
have no comment," and players
declined to discuss the issue.
"The general team feeling is
that it is good for the program,"
one player said. "I think it's best
for all involved."
The team has suffered through

two back-to-back losing seasons.
Stanford was 9-19 this year after
going 5-23 in 1983-84. Geiger
declined to discuss the team's
record as a cause for McCrea's
leaving. The record only came up
once in conversations with players,
and is likely not a major factor in
the decision.
McCrea finished with a 128-126
record in nine seasons here.
The move comes as the April 10
date for signing national letters of
intent draws near. Players were
quick to inform three high school
seniors who have verbally commit
ted to Stanford about the situa
tion.

"We called them to reassure
them that we were getting a new
coach and everything was fine,"
one player said.
The three are Emily Wagner, a
5-foot-8 guard from Detroit,
Yvon Asforis, a 6-2 forward from
Queens, N.Y., and Jill Yanke, a 6-
5 center from Boise, Idaho. The
Cardinal players said that all three
are still planning to attend Stan
ford next year.
Geiger said that when he
returns to Stanford he will begin
the process of selecting a new head
coach. Though setting no
timetable, he expects to name a
new coach before the end of the
school year.
