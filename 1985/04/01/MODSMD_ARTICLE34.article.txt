# USC ends women netters' streak at 40
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter 
I.OS ANGELES — On a cold, windy even
ing under the lights at USC's Marks Tennis
Stadium, the Stanford women's tennis team
did something it hadn't done in nearly two
years. It lost a match.
Stanford's 5-4 loss to USC here Wednesday
soured spring break victories over Harvard
(K-l), l()th-ranked UCLA (8-1) and Long
Beach State (9-0). The week's events left
Stanford 16-1 overall and 8-1 in the Western
Collegiate Athletic Association.
Amazingly enough, USC's victory over the
Cardinal, which entered the match with a 14-
0 record and a 40-match winning streak,
wasn't an upset. As if the Intercollegiate Ten
nis Coaches Association pollsters had looked
into their crystal ball and seen USC winning,
the most recent ITCA poll had the 23-0
Trojans ranked No. 1 and Stanford No. 2.
If it wasn't an upset, it was a shock.
The loss was Stanford's first since the con
solation match of the 1983 NCAA tourna
ment and it snapped a 40-match winning
streak that tied the school — and NCAA Di

vision I — record for men and women.
"I thought our team played very well," said
Cardinal Coach Frank Brcnnan. "But USC
played really well and I thought they deserved
to win. Hopefully, it was'really well' for them
and they don't play that way every day."
But it wasn't so much the who and the what
of the loss that left a bitter taste in the Card
inal's mouth. It was the how and why.
USC entered the match without Heliane
Steden, its No. 2 singles player, who was
sidelined with a stress fracture in her leg. And
just minutes into the match. Caroline
Kuhlman. the Trojans' top netter. sprained
her right ankle and was forced to default her
No. 1 singles match against Linda Gates at 1-
1 in the first set.
Meanwhile, Stanford won the first sets
handily in the three other singles matches
being played in the four-court stadium and
looked like it would destroy USC just like it
had its 14 previous opponents this season. As
USC Coach Dave Borelli said later, "After
that, I was just hoping we would win one
match."'
Then something happened to Stanford. Or,

rather, something happened to USC.
"I think we're very scrappy," Borelli said of
the Trojans' comeback that approached
miraculous. "We've been pulling matches out
because we just compete very hard."
USC's Claudia Hernandez stepped on the
court vacated by Kuhlman and Gates, and
took the first set from Stanford's Kay Tittle at
No. 5. Then at No. 4, USC's Stephanie
Harges recovered from a 6-0 blanking in the
first set and took the second set from Leigh
Anne Eldredgc.
Cardinal freshman Anna Ivan dusted off
Cecilia Fernandez, 6-1, 6-2, at No. 3, but
Patty Fendick lost the second set to Mary
Norwood at No. 2.
Ivan's win gave Stanford an early 2-0 lead,
but the tide had already turned. USC
prevailed at second, fourth and fifth singles to
take a 3-2 advantage with only the No. 6
singles match between Stephanie Savides and
USCs Dcna Levy still in progress.
"Her match at No. 6 was crucial," Borelli
said of Levy, who was inserted into the lineup
when Steden couldn't play. "With Kuhlman
(and Steden) out. I knew we had to be 4-2

after the singles. That was the key. That was
the match right there."
With both teams and a few hundred vocal
Trojan fans watching intently, Savides won
the first set 6-2, then lost the second 6-1.
Savides came from behind in the third to send
the match into a 12-point tiebreaker, but
Levy didn't let Savides win two straight points
and won the tiebreaker 7-3, giving the
Trojans a 4-2 advantage after the singles.
The match was easily the day's best, and
was accentuated by exciting rallies and fine
net play. But it was also easily the day's most
emotional match. Levy raised her fists and
glared over the net at Savides after every big
point she won.
"Generally, the Stanford and USC teams
have a history of getting along quite well,"
Brennan said. "But that match (between
Savides and Levy), to be quite honest, was
embarrassing for USC. I think that girl (Levy)
was clearly trying to bait Stephanie. . . . She
was obnoxious."
Savides' loss forced Stanford to sweep the
doubles if the six underclassmen on the eight
player traveling squad hoped to avert the first

dual-match defeat in their collegiate careers.
The Cardinal's No. I and No. 2 doubles
duos held up their end of the deal, hut at No.
3, USCs pair of Levy and Hernandez was too
much for Savides and Tittle, and their 6-3, 6-
4 win clinched the match for the Trojans.
The victory raised USC's record against
Stanford since 1976 to 16-5 overall and 9-1 at
home. It also was sweet revenge for the
Trojans, who fell 6-0 to Stanford in the
NCAA finals last May.
"I think in the 250 or so matches that I've
coached in my 11 years here, this has to he
one of the biggest wins," Borelli said. "I'm
still pinching my butt to see if we really won
this match."
Stanford seemed to completely forget
about the previous day's events Thursday,
when it routed lOth-ranked UCLA 8-1 by
winning all six singles matches and No. 1 and
No. 2 doubles.
"I think it was important to win all the
singles matches," Brennan said after the
UCLA match. "The people that needed to
win today won today. Against USC, I
think our confidence was at a ques
tionable level and that's why we
couldn't finish out our matches."
Nonetheless, Brennan spoke of the
USC match optimistically. "We left
there with the feeling that it won't
happen again," he said decisively.
"That's kind of a strange feeling to

have after a loss, but I think we're the
better team. The pressure's on them
now. They're supposed to beat us
from now on in."
Stanford and USC could meet as
many as three more times this season.
The teams are scheduled to play
April 20 at Stanford, but could meet
in the eight-team Longhorn Invita
tional April 12-14 and in the NCAA
championships in mid-May. The
Cardinal's next match is Thursday
against California in Berkeley.
