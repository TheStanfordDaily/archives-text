## Men's tennis Stanford rolls to easy wins 
### VIRGINIA PEARSON Staff sportswriter 
In preparation for competition this weekend
against UCLA and USC, the Stanford men's tennis
team hoped to do well in its matches against Cali
fornia and the Arizona teams over spring break.
The Cardinal got its wish, with a good start in a
rained-out match against California, a shutout of
Arizona State Friday and a 7-2 defeat of Arizona
Saturday.
Stanford is now 2-0 in Pac-10 competition.
Coach Dick Gould hoped the road trip would clear
up any questions he might have concerning the
Cardinal's lineup against tougher teams. The lineup
he used in Arizona won 16 out of 18 matches, and
that kind of success will likely keep most of the
players where they are.
"Frankly, I think everyone is playing very well
right now, and I am pleased with where everyone
is," Gould said. "It was a good start."
Although Stanford lost only two individual
matches in a week, one of those losses involved the
Cardinal's top player and the No. 1-ranked player
in the country, Dan Goldie.

Benji Papal of Arizona — an unranked freshman
— broke Goldie's 15-match winning streak Satur
day 6-4, 6-4.
"He (Papal) got red hot and served very well. It
was Danny's first loss in 11 dual matches, not in
cluding four other tournament-match wins," Gould
said. "I think there was a little pressure playing No.
1, but I don't think he will have trouble rebound
ing. It will be interesting to see."
Because of the great disparity between the
players' records, it is unlikely that the loss will af
fect Goldie's No. 1 Intercollegiate Tennis Coaches
Association ranking. Papal will receive more atten
tion, however, especially when Arizona comes to
play Stanford a second time April 13.
Gould, citing Goldie's rebound in his doubles
match against Arizona, seems to think his top
player will get his game together in time to compete
against players like USC's Todd Witsken and Jorge
Lozano, ranked No. 4 and No. 11 in the Head In
tercollegiate Tennis Standings, and UCLA's Mi
chael Kures and Jeff Klaparde, ranked 11th and
15th.

Goldie's doubles partner in both Arizona
matches was Eric Rosenfeld. Playing in the No. 1
spot, they defeated Arizona's Rob Howard and
Shaun Austin, 6-3, 6-4,
The match with Cal has been rescheduled for
Wednesday at 1:30 p.m. at Berkeley. The singles
matches will recommence where they were called
when the rain came.
As the match stands, Stanford has won the first
set in two matches, and is serving for the first set in
two other matches. Goldie is serving at 4-5 in the
first set against Steve DeVries, ranked No. 87.
"I think we're off io a very good start with Cal.
The key at this point is to sustain the intensity and
keep the good playing going," Gould said.
Gould would also like to see good play continue
through this weekend's indoor matches. UCLA,
ranked No. 4, defeated the No. 2 team in the
country, USC, 5-4, over break. Gould predicts the
Bruins' ranking will rise from No. 4 in the next ITCA
polls. The Bruins are the defending NCAA Cham
pions, having defeated Stanford 5-4 in the finals of
the 1984 tournament.
