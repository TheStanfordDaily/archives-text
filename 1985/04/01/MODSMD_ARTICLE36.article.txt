Stanford Head Football Coach
Jack Elway announced March 20
that Sonny Lubick, the offensive
coordinator at Colorado State, has
been appointed the outside
linebacker coach at Stanford.
Lubick, 47, replaces Greg

League after the end of last
season.
"Sonny is a mature, all-around,
excellent football coach and
teacher," Elway said.
"This is certainly a dream come
true to coach at Stanford," Lubick
said. "As a teenager in Montana, I
heard the Stanford games on the

radio and grew to love the Univer

ward to the challenge."
Lubick is a 1960 graduate of
Western Montana. He received his
master's degree in physical educa
tion from Montana State in 1978.

a conference championship and a
second-place finish in four
seasons.
Lubick was an assistant at Mon
tana State from 1970 to 1977, ser
ving as defensive coordinator for
seven of those seasons.
