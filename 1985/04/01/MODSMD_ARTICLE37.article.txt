### PETER CASTILLO Staff sportswriter 
For the third straight year, the
Stanford wrestling team has an Ail-
American, as Scott Wiggen captured
eighth place at 142 pounds at the
NCAA championships in Oklahoma
City March 16.
In the team competition, the Card
inal took 34th place, as favored lowa
won the championship. Oklahoma
was second and lowa State placed
third.
"We accomplished all our goals
that we set for this season," Stanford
Coach Chris Horpel said. "We had a
winning dual meet season, placed
wrestlers at the Pac-10 champion
ships and had an Ail-American.
"We achieved everything we were
capable of doing and are setting
higher goals for next season, like win

ning a tournament. I am glad that it
was not just Wiggen who won
matches.
"Stanford's first Ail-American was
in 1967, then to 1973 when I placed,
then 1983 and then last year and this
year for three in a row," Horpel said.
"It is becoming more evident that we
can compete at this level."
In the first round, Wiggen defeated
Rob Yoos of Lafayette, 17-6. In the
second round Wiggen faced the No. 2
seed from lowa, Kevin Dresser, and
lost 16-4. For Wiggen to continue in
the tournament, Dresser had to reach
the semifinals, which he did.
Wiggen went on to defeat B.
Swierczewai of Northern Illinois, 9-3,
and Dan Panteleo of Olivet College,
4-2. Against Panteleo, Wiggen had to
rally back and was able to score two
points to win the match and guaran

tee a finish in the top eight, which is
what he needed to earn All-America
honors.
Wiggen then lost to sixth-seeded
Pete Yozzo of Lehigh, 4-2, and then
to John Giura of Wisconsin, to finish
eighth.
Horpel said of Wiggen's perfor
mance, "I was pleasantly surprised,
but knew he was capable because of
his unorthodox style. He matched up
well against his opponents and was
mentally tough."
Twelfth-seeded Jeff Bradley (134)
won his first-round match against
Scott Rardin of Wyoming 10-7.
Bradley proceeded to lose to the No.
2 seed from Wisconsin, Jim Jordan,
15-3. Jordan made the semifinals,
and Bradley continued, beating Vince
McCullough of South Dakota State,
6-2.

Bradley was only one match away
from also earning All-American
status, but was defeated by eighth
seeded John Fisher of Michigan, 15-
5.
Dave Lee (167), seeded eighth, ran
into some familiar foes along the way.
He first defeated Howard Lawson of
Cal State-Bakersfield, 4-1.
In the next round, Lee faced Fred
Little of Fresno State, with whom he
had split their four previous
encounters. Little won the rubber
match 6-4 and then lost his next
match, which prevented Lee from
continuing in the tournament.
The only Cardinal not to win a
match was senior Tom Mullen, who
lost to Johnathan Hampton of Ap
palachian State by a technical pin at
the 5:38 mark.
