### ERIK ESELIUS Staff sportswriter 
During spring break, the Stanford
men and women's fencing teams
competed at the NCAA fencing
tournament at Notre Dame. The
Cardinal women captured eighth
place while the Stanford men finished
12th.
The Stanford men's team sent
saber fencers Andy Goorno and
Steve Levi tan along with foil special
ist Elliott Cheu. Each qualified for
the NCAAs by virtue of his individual
performance at the Western
Regionals.
At the NCAAs, foil captain Elliott
Cheu led the Stanford trio with his
seventh-place showing out of a field
of 30, thus achieving All-America
status. Cheu finished with an overall
tournament record of 11 -6.
Saber captain Goorno, figured to
finish as high as third by Stanford
Coach Buzz Hurst, finished a disap
pointing 17th. stumbling in the third
round, preceding the final 16, single
elimination phase of the tournament.
"1 should have been in the top 16,
definitely. 1 had a tough time in the
third round â€” fenced really poorly in
that round," said Goorno, who

defeated this year's second-place
saber finisher, Terrick Yassir of Long
Beach State, earlier at the Western
Regionals. Goorno racked up eight
victories against five defeats during
tournament play.
Levitan, though finishing with a 4-
9 record, came away only two slots
behind Goorno, claiming an unex
pectedly high 19th place.
In contrast to the men's tourna
ment format, the women fence in
both team and indivivdual categories.
Out of twelve teams, the Stanford
women's fencing squad secured
eighth, headed by Jennifer Yu who
only lost once during the team foil
competition.
Yu, however, did not meet with the
same success in the individual compe
tition. Hampered by a bad cold, Yu
placed only 16th out of 24 competi
tors after finishing seventh last year.
Holly Taylor, the other Cardinal
qualifier, earned the 21st position.
Yale captured first place, followed
by Pennsylvania, which narrowly
defeated the Cardinal women 9-6.
In the men's competition, Wayne
State, a school in Detroit, won the
overall championship while host
Notre Dame came in second.
