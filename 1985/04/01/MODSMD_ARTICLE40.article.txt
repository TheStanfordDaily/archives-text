# Villanova looks to Hoyas
## 
### MARK ZEIGLER Senior sportswriter With wire reports 
In a recent interview, Georgetown's all
everything center Patrick Ewing said he came to
college intending to win four NCAA titles.
Ewing, a senior, will get a chance to fulfill half
that goal tonight when Georgetown defends its
national championship against Villanova at 6
p.m. PST in Lexington, Ky.
Ewing, Coach John Thompson and company
defeated Big East foe St. John's, 77-59, Saturday
afternoon at the University of Kentucky's Rupp
Arena to set up tonight's final with — what else?
— another Big East team. Villanova, 10 regular
season losses and all, disposed of Memphis State,
52-45, to become the only obstacle in the Hoyas'
path to join the elite of schools to win back
to-back championships.
Georgetown will be playing in its third title
game in the four-year Ewing era, but Thompson
said he will settle for nothing less than a victory
tonight.
"It's a little early to be pleased," Thompson
said after his team had routed St. John's Saturday
for the third straight time this season. "There is
one more ballgame to be played. I get pleased
after we are out of here."
Meanwhile, Villanova, which has been handed
the scripts of Cinderella, David and Underdog all

rolled into one, is just happy to he in the Final
Four. Anything else is icing on the icing on the
cake.
Although Villanova finished behind St. John's
in the Big East, the Wildcats may very well stand
a better chance of beating the Hoyas than did the
Redmen. In both games against the Hoyas, the
Wildcats raced to big leads before dropping a 52-
50 overtime decision at home and a 57-50 deci
sion at Georgetown.
"Definitely we would have a better mental at
titude going into the game than St. John's be
cause we were able to play them close," Vil
lanova forward Dwayne McClain said. "We're
very confident. We know we can play with
them."
And this time, Villanova has an added advan
tage — no shot clock. However, Wildcat Coach
Rollie Massimino said no clock won't mean his
team will hold the ball against Georgetown.
"We wouldn't try and take the air out of the
ball, but hold the ball just to try and get a good
shot, to control the tempo," Massimino said.
"We'll just be able to make that extra pass to get
the ball where we want to without having to
shoot."
Georgetown is a heavy favorite to beat Vil
lanova for a third time, and the feeling among
Stanford basketball players and coaches does not
stray from the betting line.

"I think it's everbody chasing Georgetown and
no one will catch them," said Kermit Washing
ton. an assistant coach at Stanford and former
National Basketball Association player. "Even it
Ewing gets in foul trouble, they have enough
other talented players to pull it out.
"Then again, some team might get lucky,'' he
continued. "It's possible, but improbable. It I was
a betting man, I certainly wouldn't bet on Vil
lanova."
Senior center Kent Seymour agreed that
Georgetown will win, but said he feels the game
"will be closer than most people think. Villanova
plays such tough defense and they keep changing
defenses, so it's tough to come at them with one
offense. They keep you off balance."
Seymour said that for Villanova to upset
Georgetown, the Wildcats should not concen
trate on Ewing, but worry about the rest of the
Hoyas. "1 think the key is to neutralize everyone
else," he said. "I think you have to concede him
his points and just try to keep him off the boards.
"But at the same time, they (the Hoyas) are so
deep. It's almost impossible to stop them."
Still, Thompson is not counting his chickens or
his national championship rings. "Somebody for
got to tell Villanova they don't belong here," he
said. "I don't expect to walk out on the floor and
pick up a trophy."
