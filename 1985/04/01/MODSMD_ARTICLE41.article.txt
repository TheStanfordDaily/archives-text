AUSTIN, Texas (AP) â€” Old
Dominion's rich women's basket
ball tradition wouldn't let the Lady
Monarchs down yesterday when
things looked bleak against Geor
gia.
All-Americans Medina Dixon
and Tracy Claxton rallied the Lady
Monarchs to a 70-65 victory over
Georgia in the NCAA Women's
Basketball Championship game.
"It was a great win for our univer

sity," said Old Dominion Coach
Marianne Stanley.
"Part of our game plan was to get
Teresa Edwards and Katrina
McClain into foul trouble," she
said. "We did that, then we
rebounded well. I didn't know we
could rebound as well as we did.
The kids hit the boards hard."
Old Dominion outrebounded the
Lady Bulldogs 57-30 with Dixon
getting 15 caroms and Claxton

hauling down 20.
No. 4-ranked Old Dominion, 31-
3, overcame a nine-point deficit to
earn its first NCAA title after taking
two AIAW championships in 1979
and 1980.
Dixon scored 18 points and Clax
ton added 17 points as the Lady
Monarchs of the Sun Belt Confer
ence shook off a rash of turnovers to
defeat the No. 8-rated Southeast
ern Conference champions who

finished 29-5.
The Lady Bulldogs suffered a
double blow when Olympian Teresa
Edwards fouled out with 8:10 to
play and Katrina McClain went out
three minutes later.
The Lady Bulldogs won the
Buckeye Classic earlier this season
in Columbus, Ohio, by defeating
Rutgers and Ohio State. Stanford
lost to both those teams in finishing
fourth in that tournament.
