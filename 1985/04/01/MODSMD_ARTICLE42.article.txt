## 
### CAROLYN TARKINGTON Staff sportswriter 
This season has been the best
ever for the Stanford men's and
women's gymnastics teams. The
women ended the season with a
fifth-place finish in Saturday's
regional competition and a 15-6
season record, while the men took
third at the Pacific 10 Conference
championships and gained a berth
in the NCAAs.
This is the first time in the history
of Stanford gymnastics that a team
will represent the Cardinal in the
NCAAs.
A finish in the top three in last
weekend's Pac-lOs was also a Stan
ford first. The Cardinal placed third
behind Arizona State and UCLA.
Ranked third and fourth,
respectively, ASU totaled 284.50

points and UCLA totaled 283.30
points. Stanford scored a 280.85
total.
"We knew we had to beat New
Mexico and Fullerton in order to
better our average and have a
chance at the NCAAs," Coach
Sadao Hamada said. "We did what
we needed to do. We hit our
routines and had an excellent
meet."
Hamada said that the strategy
used throughout the season was the
key to the team's consistency and
success. "Throughout the season
we concentrated on our weak
events," Hamada said. "This extra
attention paid off because our
weaknesses turned into strengths.
We didn't really have a weak event
at the Pac-lOs."
Stanford's top all-arounders, Jon

Levy and Randy Besosa, placed
fifth and sixth in the all-around
with scores of 57.50 and 57.30,
respectively. In the individual
events, Levy placed fourth on rings
with a 9.60 and Besosa placed
fourth on vault with a 9.60. Besosa
and Levy also tied for second on
parallel bars and fourth on pommel
horse.
The Cardinal women placed fifth
in the region, with a total of 177.15
points, behind top finishers Fuller
ton State, Oregon State, Washing
ton and UCLA.
"This meet ended what was a
fairly strong season," Coach
Homer Sardina said. "We had a
few misses in this meet and it was
unfortunate to end the season on a
bit of a downer, but all in all we had
a good season."
