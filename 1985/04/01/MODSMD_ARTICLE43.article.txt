# Golfers slump over break
## 
### KEN STEVENS Staff sportswriter 
Spring break was anything but enjoyable for the Stan
ford men and women golfers as the two teams finished
well back of the leaders at important tournaments.
The Cardinal men suffered through their worst tourna
ment of the season, finishing 14th out of 20 teams at the
Fresno Pepsi Classic Friday and Saturday. They ended the
two-day tournament with a 1,146 total, a whopping 50
shots behind champion UCLA. Fresno State and USC
tied UCLA at 1,096, but the Bruins won the tiebreaker to
capture the tournament championship.
Men's Coach Tim Schaaf, who has prided himself in the
Cardinal's consistency this season, was disappointed with
the team's play in Fresno. "We've given back much of
what we gained (earlier) this year," he said.
In individual competition at Fresno, USC's Sam Ran
dolph shot a blistering three-round 200, which not only
gained him the tournament championship but broke the
tournament record. Randolph, a junior for the Trojans,
was last year's runner-up in the U.S. Amateur Champion
ships.
UCLA's Duffy Waldorf finished 10 strokes back of
Randolph at 210 to take second place.
Stanford's top finish was senior Tim Robinson, who
carded a 71, 73 and 76 for a 220 total. Senior Scott Erick

son finished at 232.
While the Stanford men were having their problems at
Fresno, the Cardinal women were struggling at the Lady
Mustang in Dallas last week, finishing in fifth place, 38
shots behind tournament champion Florida.
The Florida women fired a 905 three-day total, two
shots better than runner-up Arizona State. Tulsa, a peren
nial national power, finished well back in third place at
931. The Cardinal's three-round total was 943.
All of the news was not so gloomy, however, as Card
inal junior Kathy Kostas returned from an injury, which
has forced her to miss much of the season, to capture fifth
place in the Lady Mustang. Her 227 total was just six
shots behind tournament champion Dannielle Ammac
catane of ASU. Florida's Deb Richard and Karen Davies
took second and third place with respective scores of 223
and 224.
The Cardinal men will look to return to the form which
gained them the No. 2 ranking on the West Coast last
month as they open play in the three-day Far West Inter
collegiate tomorrow at Santa Cruz.
The women will take this week off but will return to
competition next Monday as they host the California In
tercollegiate Championships, a two-day tournament at the
Stanford Golf Course.
