# Card spikers lose to UCSB
## 
### ROB GRAHAM Staff sportswriter 
While splitting four contests on the road over the
break, the fifth-ranked Stanford men's volleyball
team slipped into fifth place in the California Inter
collegiate Volleyball Association.
The Cardinal, now 21-7 overall and 8-5 in CIV A
play, fell for the second time this season to Pep
perdine, 17-2, Monday, 15-10, 15-7, 13-15, 15-6.
The night's statistic sheet showed why the Wave
crashed the Cardinal. Pepperdine posted an im
pressive team hitting percentage of .421 while
Stanford managed a collective .197.
The Cardinal rebounded from Monday's loss
with convincing victories over league doormats
Loyola Marymount and Cal State-Northridge on
Wednesday and Friday.
The Cardinal pounded Loyola Marymount in

straight sets, 15-10, 15-7, 17-15, and Northridge in
four, 19-17, 15-8, 10-15, 15-5. Team hitting per
centages were again telltale as Stanford dominated
Loyola, .339 to .239, and Northridge, .464 to .259.
The wins gave Stanford season sweeps over both
schools.
The Cardinal left for UC-Santa Barbara Satur
day for the culmination of this season's final road
trip. With the teams entering the match dead
locked, the contest would determine the fourth and
fifth spots in the CIV A. The Cardinal was hot,
having won nine of its last 11, and appeared to be
coming together.
But things fell apart against the Gauchos.
Whether fatigue set in (the Cardinal played four
matches in six days) or whether the Gauchos
were just too good (they had beaten Stanford in
four sets in Maples earlier this year), Stanford was

outclassed. The 7-15, 15-13, 15-4, 15-9 loss
dropped the Cardinal into fifth place, a half game
behind Santa Barbara, 8-4.
Both teams trail league leaders Pepperdine (14-
0), USC (10-3), and UCLA (9-3). With four games
remaining on its CIV A slate, Stanford is looking to
hang on and earn the last invitation to postseason
tournament play. Only the top five teams in the
CIV A receive invitations. Stanford's prime chal
lenger for the final playoff bid, Hawaii, stands two
and-a-half games behind.
The key statistic in Saturday's match with the
Gauchos was once more team-hitting percentage.
Stanford's .248 compared poorly with the
Gaucho's .292.
The Cardinal returns to action Wednesday with a
CIV A match against No. 2 USC that begins at 7:30
p.m. in Maples Pavilion.
