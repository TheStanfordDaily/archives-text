Stanford crew swept all but one
race in a dual meet against Oregon
State at Redwood Shores last Satur
day. Stanford took first places in the
men's varsity eight, varsity four,
junior varsity eight, freshman eight,
novice eight, and the women's varsity
and novice eight events. OSU's only
win was in the men's junior varsity
four race.
Under Coach Ken Dreyfuss' lead
ership, the men's varsity eight beat
OSU with a time of 6:01.4, followed
by OSU's time of 6:05.8. The men's
junior varsity eight finished in 6:10.6
with OSU trailing with a time of
6:14.4. Stanford's varsity four time of
7:29.3 squeeked past OSU by only
seven-tenths of a second. The junior
varsity four finished with a 7:38.7,
trailing OSU's time of 7:35.8.
Coach Dreyfuss was heartened by

the performance of the team. "We're
awfully encouraged," he said. "It's a
good start for the program this year.
We really felt that Oregon was going
to be a formidable team. It was a
good race at a good time."
Stanford oarswomen completely
dominated their events. The Stanford
women's varsity and junior varsity
eights both prevailed over OSU's var
sity eight with times of 6:48.1, 6:55.9,
and 6:58, respectively.
The novice women also finished
well with the Novice A boat over
powering OSU in a time of 7:19.6 to
7:39.3, with the Novice B boat close
behind at 7:42.3.
Varsity women's coach John Davis
was very pleased with the results, es
pecially the junior varsity boat,
though he cautioned, "The varsity
will have to do better next weekend
when they race the top three teams in
the country at the San Diego Crew

classic.
The men's freshman and novice
eights cleaned up as well by taking
first places in their races. Stanford's
Frosh A and B eights finished first
and second with times of 6:17.9 and
6:53.3 against OSU's 6:57.9 and the
Novice A eight finished first with
6:30.0 ahead of OSU's novice time of
6:32.1.
Frosh/Novice Coach Jim Flywell
said, "We raced up to our potential
and showed glimmerings of champi
onship form."
Stanford's next race will be the San
Diego Crew Classic next weekend,
one of the perennial highlights of the
crew racing season.
According to Coach Dreyfuss,
some of best crews in the country are
going to be there. "There will be a
wealth of racing experience and im
measurable opportunity for achieve
ment. We're gonna go for it."
