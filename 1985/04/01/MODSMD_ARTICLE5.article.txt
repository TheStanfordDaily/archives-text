# A 						new Kesterson solution
## Lagunita endangered in San Francisquito Creek plan 
### MIKE HALE 
WASHINGTON — Federal plans
for dealing with the drainage crisis in
California's Central Valley may put
Stanford students — especially those
living near Lake Lagunita — in the
soup.
According to a Department of the
Interior study that will be made
public today, one alternative being
considered would involve the tempo
rary dumping of millions of gallons of
selenium-contaminated water into
San Francisquito Creek. From there
most of the water would flow into
Lake Lagunita. where it would be left
to evaporate.
According to the report, authored
by Bureau of Reclamation Irrigation
Specialist Donna Helliwell, "Lake
Lagunita is the ideal site for a tempo
rary evaporation pond — everything
flows into it.and nothing flows out."
The dumping could begin as early
as next year.
University officials were reluctant
to comment on the plan. Spokesman
Alain Decleve said, "We've been
aware of the possibility for a long
time . . . but until we actually sec a
plan in writing. I wouldn't want to
judge it one way or another.
"I can say that we would be very
concerned with the presence of toxic

chemicals yards away from student
residences." he added.
Decleve said that if the plan went
through, it would mean the end of
swimming and windsurfing in the
lake. The lake bottom would he lined
to prevent contamination of the local
watcrtable, and the lake would be
surrounded by a fence. "If the water
comes here, we'll do everything we
can to keep people out of it,"he said.
Selenium is a trace element neces
sary for normal function of the liver,
but deadly when it occurs in high
concentrations. High levels of
selenium in irrigation drain water
from San Joaquin Valley farms are al
leged to have killed and deformed
thousands of birds at the Kesterson

National Wildlife Refuge, leading to
Interior Secretary Donald Model's
recent decision to shut off federal ir
rigation water to the farms.
The plan that would involve Stan
ford calls for piping drain water from
the Central Valley to the Pacific
Ocean, using pipes originally huilt for
the Hetch Hetchy Aqueduct, which
runs through the foothills behind
Stanford. Construction would take a
minimum of three years, and as it
progressed the water would he
diverted into various natural holding
ponds along the route. Other sites
mentioned in the study include the
I.os Banos Reservoir, the Santa Clara
County Fairgrounds and Cast de
Fruta.
