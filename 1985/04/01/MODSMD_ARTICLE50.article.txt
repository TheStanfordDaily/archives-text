## Business School moves on expansion plans 
### MARK LAWRENCE Staff writer 
The Graduate School of Business is in the
process of raising money for the planned con
struction of a new $ 15 million building to adjoin
its current structure.
Fund raising "is moving along reasonably on
schedule," said Paul Johnson, associate dean for
administration of the business school and head
of the building advisory committee for the proj
ect.
"We've got some requests out right now, and
if they hit what we asked, then we're OK. ... It
the fund raising goes as planned, we hope to

break ground in February or March of 1986,"
he said.
The Board of Trustees, which gave final ap
proval of the site in December, approved the
project in late 1983.
The plan, developed by New York architect
Kohn Pederson Fox, calls for a U-shaped,
three-story building to be constructed on the
land north of the existing school near the inter
section of Memorial Way and Lasuen Street. A
narrow corridor will connect the two buildings
— a feature which will enable the school to
"function as one complex rather than two build
ings," according to Johnson.

The new building, scheduled to be completed
in the fall of 1987, will house two classrooms
and four smaller seminar rooms on its ground
floor and office space for the school's tenure
track faculty on the upper two floors, said
Johnson.
The new building will also allow the school's
Office of Career Planning and Placement and
40 doctoral students to move their offices from
the modular buildings located north of the exist
ing school back into the building.
According to the plan. Memorial Way will be
rerouted closer to Frost Amphitheatre, and the
available parking on Lausen Street will be

greatly reduced. An archway through the base
of the new building will allow bicycle and
pedestrian traffic to pass underneath.
Since the existing four-story building was
completed in l l )66, increases in the size of the
faculty and the student body, the addition of
computers and "more in the way of student
services" have strained available space, accord
ing to Johnson.
The existing facility is currently used by about
775 students, 125 faculty and 154 staff mem
bers during the academic year. The existing
