# Changes coming in housing Draw
## 
### CHARLIE GOFEN Editorial staff 
Last April, a freshman living in
Florence Moore's Alondra dormitory
pulled number 0004 out of the bin in
Stanford's annual Undergraduate
Housing Draw, marking both the
lowest number picked in the 19K4
Draw and the "loudest, most disgust
ing shriek of delight" that Norm Rob
inson said he has ever heard.
"Never again," said an irate Rob
inson, who is associate dean of Stu
dent Affairs for Residential Educa
tion at Stanford.
Robinson announced Friday that
Res Ed has instituted a new policy
that will prohibit students from
knowing immediately whether their
Draw numbers are good or bad. "The
shrieking is going to stop," he said
solemnly.
Under the new system, students
with guaranteed housing will piek
from a bin of cards numbered 0001 to
3,000, but will not know whether the
low or high numbers are more
desirable. Res Ed will announce two
weeks after the Draw whether
housing assignments will begin with
number 0001 and work up, as is the
tradition, or begin with number 3,000
and work down.
"In the past you'd have a situation
where a group of freshmen would
pick a number under 1,000 and
would immediately be in seventh
heaven, gloating smugly at other stu
dents as they headed for the Suites,"
said Robinson. "It occurred to me
one day over the summer, why not
keep it a secret whether the numbers
will be considered top to bottom or
vice versa? That way I'll be the only
one at the Draw who can gloat
smugly at students. I'll be the only
one who knows whether number
0004 means Storey or Burbank."
But according to Asst. Dean of Res
Ed Rodger Whitney, not even Robin
son will know whether number 0004
means Storey of Burbank. "As direc
tor of the Housing Center, I'm actu
ally the only one who will know what
0004 means."
Whitney said he supports the new
policy "only because it adds a little
spice to the Draw." He denied that
Res Ed came up with the idea to get
back at a small group of students who
were rumored last spring to be plot
ting against the administration. The
students allegedly planned to have
the entire student body draw to
gether and thus force Res Ed to as
sign all housing by an elaborate tie
breaking system.
"The one thing I really want to
make clear is that the new Draw svs

tem is not intended to put students in
agony after they pick their Draw
cards," said Whitney.
"I'd like to see students agonize a
little after they pick their Draw
cards." said Robinson. "I'm sick of
seeing eager freshmen crowding
around the Draw chest, holding
hands, bickering over who gets to
pick the envelope out of the chest,
and then squealing about the result
like it's all part of some idiotic game
show. I'll tell you something:-The
Draw should be treated properly. It's
no game."

The Draw actually was a game last
year, as Res Ed played up the Trivial
Pursuit theme with a trivia-packed
Draw book, 5,000 Draw game cards
and special Trivial Pursuit T-shirts for
student helpers.
"It's important to maintain a game
atmosphere that makes the whole
event pleasant." noted Whitney,
citing Res Ed's new policy of having
students gamble on residences in the
Draw. The proposed gambling system
for the 1985 Draw will indeed be
complex.
First. Terra House, a co-op, will be
transformed into a U-op if more than
five spaces in the house remain un
filled after the Draw. Also, Storey
House, a U-op, will be transformed
into a co-op if more than five spaces
in that house remain unfilled after the
Draw. In addition. Burbank, a four
class dorm, will be transformed into
an all-frosh dorm if too many of next
year's entering freshmen want to live
with each other.
"We're working to improve the
system, to streamline the housing
process so that it is easy to under
stand," said Whitney.
"The bottom line," concluded
Robinson, "is that Rodger Whitney is
the only one who really understands
the Draw at all. and he works each
year to make it more complex so he
can continue to gloat smugly at
puzzled students."
