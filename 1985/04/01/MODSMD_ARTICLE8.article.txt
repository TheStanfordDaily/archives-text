AUSTIN, Texas â€” Stanford won the NCAA Men's
Swimming Championship for the first time in 18 years
Saturday, amassing 403.5 points and defeating Florida, its
closest challenger, by more than 74 points.
Following Florida's second-place finish of 329 points
were Texas with 306, California with 294, USC with 230
and UCLA with 224.
How does a team feel after accomplishing an honor
such as this? Only the Cardinal swimmers and Stanford
coach Skip Kenney can say:
"It feels like flying," "the ultimate natural high," "the
greatest," "awesome," "the culmination of everything,"
"totally psyched," "perfect."
The list goes on. Perhaps the only lists that are longer
are those containing the number of NCAA, U.S. Open
and American records that were set during the three-day
meet, the number of Cardinal swimmers who claimed
championship titles and, most important, the number of
dreams that finally came true.
"There is no possible way to put this feeling into
words," senior co-captain Dave Bottom said. "To be able
to share this honor with a team like ours is like a dream
come true."
"1 feel like I'm living in a dream, and I could care less if
I never come out of it," Kenney said. "I think what means
the most, rather than the actual title itself, is being able to
see the awesome glow on our swimmers' faces after we
won. . . . It's a glow I'll never forget for as long as I live."
The Stanford swimmers had every reason to be glowing,
considering their record-setting performances throughout
the three days of competition. En route to seven individ
ual titles and one relay title, the Cardinal set three NCAA
records, three U.S. Open records, four American records
and numerous Stanford records.
The Cardinal started off its record-breaking streak

during the first day of preliminary races as the 400-yard
medley relay of Bottom, John Moffet, Pablo Morales and
Rick Bodor broke all four records with a time of 3:11.93
to claim the No. 1 qualifying time for the evening's finals.
The previous record, 3:12.63, was held by Southern
Methodist.
During Thursday night's finals, the team, with David
Lundberg swimming the final leg, broke the morning's
records with a winning time of 3:10.92.
"This medley relay team is absolutely the best of all
time," Kenney said. "When you take four great athletes
like we have and put them together on one team, the
results are awesome."
Even excluding the remarkable finish of the medley
relay, Stanford's total team scoring during the first day
was proof that the Cardinal "was really on," according to
Kenney.
Stanford opened the meet with a sixth-place finish by
Jeff Kostoff in the 500 freestyle and followed with a first
place finish by Morales in the 200 individual medley
(1:46.08).
"Throughout the event 1 was considering my place and
not my time," Morales said. "All 1 wanted to do was hit
the wall first so I could give my team as many points as I
could."
In the same event, Moffet finished sixth (1:48.05), Bot
tom finished ninth (1:47.58) and Lundberg finished 11th
(1:48.4) for the Cardinal.
To finish Stanford's almost perfect day of competition,
the Cardinal received an extra scoring boost from diver
Thor Johnson, who finished seventh in the 1-meter com
petition.
"It is a fine accomplishment for Thor to finish so well
among such a strong field of divers," Diving Coach Rick
Shavone said. "Thor has come a long way since he first
